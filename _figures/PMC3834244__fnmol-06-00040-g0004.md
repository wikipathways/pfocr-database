caption: Autophagy inhibition causes dysregulated miRNA processing and function. (A)
  The canonical pathway of miRNA biogenesis is shown leading to the two best characterized
  actions of miRNA to cause degradation of mRNA targets and interfere with mRNA translation.
  (B) Recent findings demonstrate that autophagy inhibition leads to break-down of
  miRNA-free Dicer and AGO2, causing downstream miRNA instability and overexpression
  of untargeted transcripts (Gibbings et al., , ). *, antisense miRNA strand, which
  is degraded during processing.
