caption: 'Examples of the highest-scoring pathways. a. One of the highest-scoring
  pathways in Query 3, which is involved in biotin metabolism. b. One of the highest-scoring
  pathways in Query 2, but not in Query 1 or Query 4. The last building block is a
  "dg", which contains one unique reaction in E. coli, and constitutes an alternative
  pathway (see text). Involved KEGG maps include: phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan
  biosynthesis; benzoxazinone biosynthesis; tryptophan metabolism; nitrogen metabolism.
  c. One of the highest-scoring pathways in Query 5, but not in Query 2. Involved
  KEGG maps include: urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups; alanine and aspartate
  metabolism; arginine and proline metabolism.'
