caption: Involvement of dWAT in Hair Follicle (HF) Synchronization.Synchronous cycling
  of HFs is connected with long-range paracrine signaling. High PPARγ activity is
  associated with high megalin expression, which is an endocytic sonic hedgehog receptor
  (Shh). High megalin reflects high Shh sensitivity, translating into a long-range
  signaling activity of the Shh pathway. As a result, the mesenchymal remodeling processes
  in neighboring HFs synchronized, which is typical for the first two postnatal hair
  cycles in rodents. In contrast, low PPARγ activity can reduce the effective range
  of Shh paracrine signaling, thereby resulting in seemingly asynchronous cycling
  of HFs, which is typical for HF cycling in humans and beyond the third postnatal
  HF cycling in rodents. PPARγ activity is connected with local morphology and the
  physiological state of dWAT, which in turn can be regulated by different factors,
  among them by Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) signaling. On the other hand, PPARγ activity
  correlates through dWAT with the phase of HF cycle.
