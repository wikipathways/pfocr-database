caption: Potential interactions between retinoid signaling and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  on the cellular level for growth plate chondrocytes during endochondral ossification.
  The inactive retinol is transported to the cell by retinoid binding protein and
  translocated into the cytoplasm by the transporter STRAT6, where it is transformed
  into the active retinoic acid (RA) [,,]. The retinoic acid is translocated into
  the nucleus by the cellular retinoic acid binding protein II (CRABP II) [,]. Binding
  of retinoic acid (RA) to the RA receptor would activate gene expression of Wnt proteins,
  receptors, and coreceptors which leads to an increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling followed
  by hypertrophic conversion []. RBP, retinoid binding protein; STRAT6, ”stimulated
  by retinoic acid“, receptor/Vit. A transporter; RDH, retinol dehydrogenase; RALDH,
  retinaldehyde dehydrogenase; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR retinoic X receptor;
  CRABP II, cellular retinoic acid binding protein; RARE, retinoic acid response element;
  GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3 CoA co-activator; LRP, lipoprotein receptor related
  protein; LEF/TCF, lymphoid enhancer binding factor/transcription factor, ↑, upregulation,
  ↓, downregulation.
