caption: The sketch map demonstrated the mechanism involved in liraglutide alleviated
  hepatic steatosis and liver injury. GLP-1 agonist liraglutide could directly act
  on hepatic GLP-1R to stimulate the expression of PPARα through activating the PKA-AMPK
  signaling pathway. PPARα could stimulate the β-oxidation to relieve hepatic steatosis
  through stimulating the expression of CPT1a and decreasing that of ACC. Meanwhile,
  PPARα could also decrease the intracelluar ROS level to alleviate the liver injury.
  On the other hand, insulin could suppress the expression of GLP-1R to inhibit its
  downstream signaling, while the administration of GLP-1 could recover the insulin
  aggravated hepatic steatosis.
