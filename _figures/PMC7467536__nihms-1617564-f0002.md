caption: (A) Transcription factors serve as ON/OFF switches of target gene expression
  in a binary fashion. (B) PRC2 based gene regulation can modulate the expression
  of transcription activators and repressors that can subsequently modulate target
  genes in a feed-forward manner. (C) In conditional knockouts of PRC2 core components,
  simultaneous change in expression of numerous PRC2 target genes can serve as a “dimmer
  switch” of gene expression in GRN networks.
