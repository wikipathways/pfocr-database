caption: Schematic representation of the relationship between apoptosis signal regulating
  kinase 1 (ASK1) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)/p38 pathway activated by various
  stresses. Various stresses including oxidative stress, ER stress, and bacterial
  infection, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). ASK1 activates by forming ASK1
  signalosome with TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)2/TRAF6. The ASK1 signalosome
  induces the JNK/p38 pathway and regulates a variety of cellular signal pathways
  including cell death, cell survival, and the cell differentiation pathway.
