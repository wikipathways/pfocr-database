caption: (A) Metabolic pathways for anabolism and catabolism of DAG in model yeast
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Major lipid metabolites are highlighted in blue boxes
  and the enzymes are represented in pink font. Green and red arrows indicate multiple
  anabolic and catabolic pathways, respectively, that converge on DAG. CDP-DAG, Cytidine
  diphosphate diacylglycerol; CoA, Coenzyme A; Lyso-PA, Lysophosphatidic acid; Inositol
  phosphoceramide, IPC; and Mannosyl-di-(inositol­phosphoryl)-ceramide, M(IP)2C. (B)
  DAG as the central metabolite at the crossroad of cell growth (membrane biogenesis)
  and energy storage (TAG-based LD production). Enzymes involved in the processes
  are indicated in blue
