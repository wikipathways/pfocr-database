caption: 'Mechanosignaling in the VEGFR-2 pathway. The VEGFR-2 receptor (red) dimerizes
  when bound by the VEGF ligand, spans the cell membrane (blue) and possesses multiple
  phosphorylation sites in the intracellular domain (orange). Downstream signaling
  initiated by VEGFR-2 includes several known mechanotransductive proteins and enzymes
  (green) including the MEK/ERK, Rho/ROCK, Src, and YAP/TAZ pathways. Crosstalk between
  related pathways, i.e., ERK/p38, are not shown for the sake of clarity. The primary
  target of each pathway is identified with a dashed gray line (light blue region)
  and includes cytoskeletal regulation, focal adhesion regulation, and VE-cadherin
  signaling. Finally, resulting cellular phenotypes for each mechanosignaling pathway
  are indicated with a solid blue arrow in the lowest region of the figure. Figure
  was derived based on the following references: (, , –).'
