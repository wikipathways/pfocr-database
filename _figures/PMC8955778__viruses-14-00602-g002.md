caption: Glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway in metabolic reprogramming.
  (A) Upregulated glycolysis in metabolic reprogramming including the transcriptional
  regulation and increased expression of glucose transporters as well as the consequences
  of increased glycolysis. (B) Mechanisms leading to pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
  upregulation during metabolic reprogramming include both branches and transcriptional
  regulation of critical enzymes.
