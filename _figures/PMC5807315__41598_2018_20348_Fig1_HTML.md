caption: 'Simplified glucose metabolism with multienzyme complexes. Seven metabolic
  intermediates are involved in the pathway: S1 represents glucose, S2 is fructose-6-phosphate,
  S3 is fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, S4 is 3-phosphoglycerate, S5 is phosphoenolpyruvate,
  S6 is pyruvate, and S7 is oxaloacetate. Four rate-limiting enzymes are E1 (phosphofructokinase
  1, PFK), E2 (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, FBPase), E3 (pyruvate kinase M2 dimer,
  PKM2), and E4 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, PEPCK1). Pyruvate kinase M2
  catalyzes conversion from S5 to S6 when it becomes a tetramer (). On the other hand,
  phosphofructokinase 1 is inactivated after post-translational glycosylation (E1gly).
  PFK forms three differently sized clusters: ES, EM, and EL represent small-, medium-
  and large-sized clusters, where EM and EL are multienzyme complexes. To measure
  the direction of glucose flux, we denote three metabolic products as P1, P2, and
  P3, which represent metabolic outcomes of the pentose phosphate pathway, serine
  biosynthesis and the downstream of glycolysis. All the used parameters are summarized
  in Tables  and .'
