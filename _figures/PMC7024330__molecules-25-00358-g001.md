caption: 'Mechanisms of AR mediated gene transcription in different subtypes of breast
  cancer. In ER-α-negative/HER 2-positive breast cancer, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  is implicated and facilitates the transcriptional activity of AR promoting tumor
  growth. In TNBC, androgens seem to initiate second-messenger signaling cascades,
  which often results in a feedback loop, leading to the progression of the tumor.
  In the ER-positive, BC subtype, there is a dynamic relationship between ER and AR,
  where the two receptors can transcriptionally regulate each other through heterodimerization
  and binding to the same DNA sequence. Abbreviations: AR—androgen receptor; ARE—androgen
  receptor element; DHT—dihydrotestosterone; TF—transcription factor.'
