  Fe3+. The Y. pestis circuit, where the pbgP promoter harbors binding sites for the

  is shared by all depicted species, which differ in the activation of the pbgP gene

  PmrD protein activates the PmrA protein post-translationally, enabling it to bind
  to the pbgP promoter and express pbgP in low Mg2+. There is no PhoP binding site
  in the S. enterica pbgP gene promoter. A PmrA binding site in the pmrD promoter
  mediates a negative feedback by the PmrA protein on the PhoP-promoted transcription
  of the pmrD gene. This feedback is believed to prevent the accumulation of the active
  (i.e., phosphorylated) form of the PmrA protein. K. pneumoniae’s circuit includes
  both direct pbgP control by the PhoP protein, like the Y. pestis’ circuit, as well
  as the indirect PmrD-mediated pathway operating in S. enterica. Yet, the PmrA protein
  does not exhibit negative feedback on pmrD transcription in K. pneumoniae. A hypothetical
  circuit lacking the latter negative feedback (shown to the left of the other circuits)
  is a hypothesized intermediate in the evolution from the circuit present in K. pneumoniae
  to the circuit operating in S. enterica. The pmrD gene was acquired (or invented)
  by the ancestral organism giving rise to K. pneumoniae, S. enterica and E. coli.
  Despite harboring a PhoP-activated pmrD gene, E. coli does not express PmrA-activated
  genes in low Mg2+ because it encodes a highly divergent PmrD protein. The E. coli
  PmrD protein may interact with and affect the activity of other regulatory protein(s).
