caption: 'Tetrahydrofolate (THF)-mediated one-carbon metabolism is required for the
  synthesis of purines, thymidylate and the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine.
  The hydroxymethyl group of serine is the major source of one-carbon units which
  are generated in the mitochondria in the form of formate, or in the cytoplasm through
  the activity of SHMT1. Mitochondrial-derived formate can enter the cytoplasm and
  function as a one-carbon unit for folate metabolism. 5,10-methyleneTHF can be generated
  in the cytoplasm from formate or serine, and the sources of 5,10-methyleneTHF exist
  in equilibrium. The SHMT1 enzyme also inhibits homocysteine remethylation by sequestering
  5-methylTHF in the cytoplasm. The de novo thymidylate synthesis pathway involves
  the three enzymes, SHMT1, TYMS and DHFR, while the salvage pathway involves TK1.
  Abbreviations: MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; SHMT1, cytoplasmic serine
  hydroxymethyltransferase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; TK1, cytoplasmic thymidine
  kinase; TYMS, thymidylate synthase; MS, methionine synthase, AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine;
  AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine; THF, tetrahydrofolate. The one-carbon is labeled
  in bold.'
