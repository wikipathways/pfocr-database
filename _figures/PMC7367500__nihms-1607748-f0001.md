caption: The elimination of cellular β-catenin depletes its pool to translocate to
  the nucleus; thus, Wnt target gene expression is repressed (Wnt-OFF). Upon Wnt ligand
  binding to Frz and LRP5/6, the activation of the adaptor protein disheveled (Dvl)
  and recruitment of Axin complex to the LRP coreceptor are initiated. The decreased
  proteasomal degradation of phosphorylated β-catenin leads to the accumulation and
  nuclear translocation of β-catenin, subsequently forming molecular complexes with
  TCF-1/LEF-1. This interaction eliminates transcriptional repressors (e.g., Groucho),
  initiating the expression of Wnt target genes (Wnt-ON). Wnt signaling is enhanced
  by R-spondin binding to its receptor LGR-5 and RNF43. (B) In the Wnt/Ca2+pathway,
  Wnt ligands induce the release of intracellular calcium. The Wnt/Ca2+pathway involves
  activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and turnover of phospholipid membranes in the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the release of intracellular Ca2+. The increased
  Ca2+ levels result in the activation of Ca2+-dependent signaling molecules such
  as protein kinase C (PKC), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamKII), and
  the calcineurin-dependent transcriptional nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT).
  In the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, Wnt ligands stimulate activation of the
  small GTPases Rho and Rac, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell motility.
  Ca2+–NFAT signaling plays crucial roles in lymphocyte activation. Signaling crosstalk
  between the Wnt/Ca2+pathway and the canonical Wnt pathway to regulate NFAT translocation
  via GSK-3β has been proposed.
