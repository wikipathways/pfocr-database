caption: 'Carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. Enzymes are in bold face. Abbreviations
  for enzymes and substrates are: BCH, β-carotene hydroxylase; CCS, capsanthin/capsorubin
  synthase; CRTISO, carotene isomerase; CYP, cytochrome P450; DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; GGPPS, GGPP synthase; IPP, isopentenyl
  diphosphate; LCYB, lycopene β-cyclase; LCYE, lycopene ε-cyclase; NSY, neoxanthin
  synthase; PDS, phytoene desaturase; PSY, phytoene synthase; VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase;
  ZEP, zeaxanthin epoxidase; ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase; and Z-ISO, ζ-carotene isomerase.
  Pigments analyzed in this study are indicated: the β,β-branch and β, ε-branch carotenoids
  are boxed in yellow and orange, respectively; capsanthin and capsorubin are boxed
  in red; and chlorophylls are boxed in green. Question mark and dashed arrow indicate
  that the conversion of violaxanthin to neoxanthin in chili pepper was catalyzed
  by a presumed NSY.'
