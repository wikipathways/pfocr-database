caption: Different levels of HDAC-mediated control in the p53 pathway. In unstressed
  cells, HDACs may facilitate p53 turnover by removal of acetyl groups from lysines
  in p53. Those amino acids become ‘visible’ to ubiquitin ligases that are now able
  to attach ubiquitin particles destining p53 protein to proteosomal degradation.
  In stressed cells, p53 becomes acetylated, increasing its half-life and leading
  to accumulation of p53 protein in the cell. The nature of stress stimuli determines
  the acetylation site and subsequently the type of p53-controled transcriptional
  response. Although some genes are induced, others are repressed via HDAC-mediated
  histone deacetylation in the region of corresponding promoters.
