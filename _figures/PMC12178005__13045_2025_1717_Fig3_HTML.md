caption: ECM remodeling facilitates the formation of immunosuppressive TME. Tenascin-C
  (TNC) and SPARC are both intricate proteins in the matrix associated with dysregulated
  tumor immunity and tumor metastasis. In breast cancer, TNC, inducing CXCL12 through
  TLR4, not only promoted the activation of M2-polarised macrophages, but also inhibited
  the infiltration of CD8 + T cells into tumor cell islet. Higher SPARC mRNA levels
  correlated with the expression of macrophage-related pro-tumor genes in colorectal
  cancer (CRC), indicating the central role of M2-like macrophages in SPARC-driven
  matrix remodeling. Additionally, expressed SPARC in breast cancer cells were found
  to induce EMT and formation of MDSCs hindering the proliferation of CD4+T cells
  and CD8+T cells. Additionally, collagen in the ECM, primarily produced by CAFs,
  can influence cancer cell proliferation by activating the DDR signaling pathway
