caption: CCM3 interacts with multiple signaling complexes. The pathway identified
  by He et al. is highlighted. At low stoichiometric amounts, CCM3 preferentially
  interacts with CCM1 and CCM2, which inhibits RhoA signaling. In addition, CCM3 also
  promotes VEGF signaling, and it is unknown whether it associates with other proteins
  while complexed with VEGFR2. At high stoichiometric amounts, CCM3 binds to serine-threonine
  kinase 25 (STK25) and then to either CCM2 or the striatin-interacting phosphatase
  and kinase (STRIPAK) complex. However, the equilibrium between all of these pathways
  is currently unknown. Dashed arrows, unknown equilibrium; P, phosphate group. ROCK1/2,
  Rho-associated, coiled-coil–containing protein kinase 1/2; MLC2, myosin light chain
  2; TRAF3, tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3. [Adapted from (, ,
