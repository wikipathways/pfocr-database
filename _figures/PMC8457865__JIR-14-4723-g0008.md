caption: Proposed effects and signaling pathways by OSM in bone cells. OSM increases
  bone resorption by inducing the expression of osteoclastogenic RANKL by osteoblasts.
  We, here, show that OSM also induces the expression of WNT16 that act as a negative
  feedback regulator of osteoclast formation in calvarial periosteal cells. The induction
  of Wnt16 by OSM is dependent on gp130 and OSM receptor (OSMR), and downstream signaling
  by the SHC1/STAT3 pathway. The inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by WNT16, together
  with a stimulatory effect on bone formation by OSM, and WNT16,, will cause an OSM-dependent
  increase of bone mass.
