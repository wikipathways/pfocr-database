caption: Schema of TNF-α signaling pathway that induces apoptosis. TNF-α is capable
  of inducing apoptosis when NF-κB signaling is blocked (, , ). Upon binding to TNF
  receptor I, a protein complex, complex I, forms rapidly; this complex activates
  NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways. Complex I undergoes ligand-dissociated internalization
  with formation of complex II. Complex II is composed of FADD and procaspase 8 and
  triggers apoptosis if NF-κB signaling fails to induce expression of antiapoptotic
  genes. JNK is an important regulator of TNF-α-mediated apoptosis () and is activated
  via the sequential activation of protein kinases, including two MAP kinase kinases
  (MKK4 and MKK7) and multiple MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAP3Ks). MKK7 is an essential
  component of the JNK signaling pathway activated by TNF-α. RACK1 is a scaffold protein
  that facilitates phosphorylation of MKK7 by upstream MAP3Ks (). It is widely reported
  that sustained JNK activation mediates TNF-α-induced cell death, although in hepatocytes
  JNK has both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic aspects (, ). We propose that HBc (red)
  disrupts interactions between MKK7 and RACK1, rendering cells susceptible to TNF-α-mediated
  apoptosis.
