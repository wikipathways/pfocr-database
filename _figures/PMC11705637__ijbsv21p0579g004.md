caption: 'The main pathways involved in INPP5E activation. Shh signaling pathway.
  In the unstimulated state, patched (PTCH) localizes in the cilium membrane, inhibiting
  SMO entry. GLI family zinc finger (GLI) proteins are suppressed by SuFu at the ciliary
  tip. Upon SHH binding to PTCH, SMO repression is released, allowing its entry while
  PTCH remains in the cilium. SMO then represses SuFu, enabling GLI activation. Activated
  GLI (GLIA) translocates to the nucleus, driving target gene expression. During Hh
  pathway activation, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase E (INPP5E)
  helps regulate SMO and GLI2/GLI1 translocation. Moreover, INPP5E regulates GLI3
  processing, possibly due to increased PI(3,4,5)P3. PIP2 and PIP3 activate the SHH
  signaling pathway to control downstream target gene expression. INPP5E may also
  influence GLI3 processing by impacting the transition zone (TZ). TKR signaling pathway:
  INPP5E can mediate tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR) pathway activation by regulating
  Aurora kinase A (AURKA) via phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) control
  and PIP3 conversion, activating signaling cascades, including protein kinase B (AKT),
  glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)β, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1.
  Subsequently, INPP5E expression is upregulated. Created in BioRender. Hakeem, A.
