caption: Schematic representation of signal transduction of necroptosis and inflammation
  caused by the overexpression of RIP3 in HK-2 cells. RIP3 was upregulated in patients
  with chronic TA/IF. This upregulation of RIP3 can produce excessive ROS and activate
  the NF-κB signaling pathway to induce necroptosis, and ultimately lead to inflammation.
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; RIP3, receptor-interacting protein 3; TA/IF, tubular
  atrophy and/or interstitial fibrosis; MLKL, mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein;
  p-, phosphorylated.
