caption: In MCs, Ang II generates ROS by activating NADPH oxdiases (NOX) through AT1
  receptor signaling pathway. ROS subsequently raises [Ca2+]i either by stimulating
  Ca2+ release from endoplastic reticulum (ER)/sarcoplastic reticulum (SR) or by acutely
  activating Ca2+ permeable channels in the plasma membrane or both. An elevation
  of intracellular Ca2+ level triggers MC contraction and eventually results in a
  decrease in GFR. Synthetic triterpenoids bind to Keap1 in the cytoplasm of MC, which
  activates the Nrf2 transcription factor. In the nucleus of MCs, activated Nrf2 then
  promotes transcription of a variety of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes. The increased
  abundance of antioxidant enzymes reduces intracellular ROS produced by the Ang II
  signaling pathway, and consequently maintains an intracellular redox balance during
  Ang II stimulation (for simplicity, a classical Ang II-AT1 receptor signaling pathway
  was omitted).
