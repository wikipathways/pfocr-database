caption: ONE induces strong ERK activation at an early time point, which is subsequently
  followed by p53-mediated apoptosis. In this model, ERK, but not JNK or p38, plays
  as an upstream regulator of ONE-induced cytotoxicity. While the mechanisms for ERK
  activation by ONE are unclear and require further study, we hypothesize that either
  direct interaction of ONE and ERK or ONE-mediated generation of reactive oxygen
  species might be an important factor in this regulatory mechanism.
