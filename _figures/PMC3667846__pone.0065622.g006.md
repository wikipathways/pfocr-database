caption: 'Enzymes for which information about cDNAs is not known are shown by broken
  arrows. Enzymes in red show up-regulation in pap1 in comparison to BR086, whereas
  in green (7OMT) shows down-regulation. Transcripts with no change in expression
  are shown in black. Transcripts identified through comparative transcriptome analysis
  with putative involvement in papaverine are underlined. Abbreviations: TYDC, tyrosine
  decarboxylase; NCS, norcoclaurine synthase; 6OMT, (S)-norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase;
  CNMT, (S)-coclaurine N-methyltransferase; NMCH, (S)-N-methylcoclaurine 3′-hydroxylase;
  3′OHase, 3′-hydroxylase; 4′OMT, (S)-3′-hydroxyN-methylcoclaurine 4′-O-methyltransferase;
  N7OMT, norreticuline 7-O-methyltransferase; 7OMT, reticuline 7-O-methyltransferase;
  3′OMT, 3′-O-methyltransferase; deHase, dehydrogenase; LNdeMT, laudanosine N-demethylase.'
