caption: 'An example for the DTT approach via parallel inhibition. As DNA damage checkpoint
  and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway represent two separate mechanisms for maintaining
  genomic integrity and survival of tumor cells under intracellular and extracellular
  stresses (e.g., genotoxic insults caused by conventional DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics).
  Treatment with Chk1 (or Wee1) inhibitors promotes DNA damage by abrogating checkpoints
  via Cdc25-mediated dephosphorylation of Cdk1 at inhibitory sites, an effect that
  could be potentiated by HDAC inhibitors via down-regulation of multiple genes involving
  DNA damage checkpoint and repair (linear inhibition). However, they also triggers
  activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway via a not-yet-defined crosstalk between
  these two pathways, which most likely accounts for non-genetic resistance to Chk1
  (or Wee1) inhibitors. Thus, a DTT approach via parallel inhibition of both DNA damage
  checkpoint (pathway #1) and its complementary Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade
  (pathway #2; e.g., by inhibitors of Src, Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK, which act to prevent
  phosphorylation and degradation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bim, thus priming
  tumor cells for death induced by targeted agents like Chk1/Wee1 inhibitors), leads
  to unfixable DNA damage and thus triggers robust apoptosis. DSB, double-stranded
  break; P, phosphorylation.'
