caption: The figure shows selected subnetwork of the differential network for Heart
  tissue in Diabetes. In detail, starting from the differential network, we highlighted
  the genes involved in the pathways resulted from enriched analysis in different
  colours, whereas the genes not involved in pathways are identified in grey. In particular,
  the genes involved Toll-like receptor signaling pathway are coloured in blue, the
  genes involved in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway are coloured in red, the genes
  involved in Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction are coloured in pink, and the
  genes involved in Inflammatory bowel disease are coloured in yellow
