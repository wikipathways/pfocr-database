caption: An overview of types of DNA damage and repair pathways with the Immediate-Early,
  Early, and Late stage indicated. The Immediate-Early, Early, and Late stages of
  the DSB response are indicated in the boxes. (A) Mismatched nucleotides or DNA damage
  (orange boxes) can be divided into five categories and directed towards the repair
  pathways as indicated (yellow). Any form of damage can become SSBs or DSBs if not
  repaired correctly. (B) Strand breaks, either SSBs or DSB, have a PARP/PARylation
  response. In the Immediate-Early response, the PARP/PARylation can facilitate recruitment
  of KU70/80 and MRN to some DSBs. If the break is easily ligatable, fast-kinetic
  cNHEJ (blue) repairs the damage within the Immediate-Early response without any
  requirement for PARylation, processing or ATM-dependent signalling. (C) If the break
  requires processing prior to repair, the Early response is activated. This includes
  ATM-dependent signalling which requires dynamic chromatin remodelling. The Early
  response culminates in the ubiquitination of H2A(X)K15. How chromatin events and
  CK2 activation tie into these processes remains unclear. (D) The Late response includes
  53BP1 and BRCA1-BARD1 as ‘readers’ of the H2A(X) ubiquitin mark as well as the methylation
  state of H4K20. The Late response occurs prior to pathway choice and includes an
  intricate balance of end-resection vs. end-protection machinery. (E–I) Downstream
  repair pathways (blue) with decision points between pathways (green). Slow-kinetic
  cNHEJ and GC are high-fidelity repairs, while Alt-EJ, BIR, and SSA, are mutagenic
  and result when repair machinery is not available. Key proteins discussed are in
  grey.
