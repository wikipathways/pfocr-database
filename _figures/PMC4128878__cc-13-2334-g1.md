caption: 'Figure 1. α-catenin signaling in cancer. In addition to maintaining the
  integrity of the cadherin-catenin complex and linking adherens junctions to the
  actin cytoskeleton, α-catenin can: (1) inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by preventing
  β-catenin nuclear translocation or formation of the β-catenin-TCF-DNA complex, by
  promoting β-catenin degradation, or by recruiting APC to the β-catenin-TCF complex;
  (2) regulate the Hippo-YAP pathway by blocking YAP dephosphorylation and nuclear
  localization; and (3) suppress the NF-κB pathway by inhibiting IκB ubiquitination
  and its association with the proteasome, in a tissue type-specific manner. The Hedgehog
  pathway is not shown, as it is unknown how this pathway is regulated by α-catenin.'
