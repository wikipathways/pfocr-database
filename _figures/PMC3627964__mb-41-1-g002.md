caption: The proposed roles of Msi1-like (MSIL) proteins as regulators of the nutrient-
  and stress-sensing signaling pathways in fungi. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cac3/Msi1
  likely acts downstream of protein kinase A (PKA) in the presence of functional Bcy1.
  In response to certain environmental cues (such as glucose addition), adenylyl cyclase
  (Cyr1/Cdc35) is activated by either activated GTP-bound Ras proteins or activated
  GTP-bound Gpa2 Ga subunit through the Gpr1 G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) to
  produce cAMP, which is a secondary messenger. Synthesized cAMP either is degraded
  to AMP by phosphodiesterases (Pde1/2) as a negative feedback regulation or binds
  to the regulatory subunit (Bcy1) of PKA, which normally suppresses the activation
  of the catalytic subunits (Tpk1/2/3) of PKA. Released and activated Tpks, which
  have redundant and unique roles, phosphorylate or activate diverse target genes.
  Downstream of PKA, nitrogen permease reactivator 1 (Npr1) activates downstream effector
  proteins, mediating heat shock sensitivity or stabilization of nutrient transporters,
  which otherwise are degraded by ubiquitination. Cac3/Msi1 normally sequesters Npr1
  and inhibits its activation. At this step, it is unclear how Bcy1 acts on the Cac3/Msi1
  (depicted as dotted arrow). Activated PKA also phosphorylates and inhibits yet another
  kinase 1 (Yak1), which antagonizes the Ras/cAMP signaling, although the YAK1 transcription
  itself is also activated by PKA, perhaps as an autoregulatory loop. Interestingly,
  Yak1 stabilizes the interaction between Cac1 and Cac3/Msi1 in the nucleus without
  affecting other CAF-1 interactions. Under non-fermentable carbon sources, Yak1 inhibits
  the nuclear localization of Cac3/Msi1 without phosphorylation, whereas Yak1 phosphorylates
  a nuclear-localized Bcy1 and facilitates its export to the cytoplasm. Conversely,
  Msi1 can also control Yak1. Overexpression of YAK1 confers growth arrest only in
  the presence of Msi1. In Cryptococcus neoformans, however, the regulatory mechanism
  of the Msl1 MSIL protein in terms of the Ras and cAMP/PKA pathways is rather different
  from that in S. cerevisiae. First, the Ras signaling pathway is less functionally
  connected to the cAMP pathway and instead governs thermotolerance and other stress-related
  phenotypes by controlling an additional GTPase protein Cdc42 and a Cdc24 guanine
  nucleotide exchange factor protein. All of the Msl1-related phenotypes appear to
  be independent from the Ras-signaling pathways. Second, there is no evidence showing
  that Msl1 acts downstream of PKA in C. neoformans. In fact, the negative role of
  Msl1 in melanin and mating efficiency is abolished by the loss of Cac1, indicating
  that Msl1 may act on Cac1 or its upstream factors (depicted dotted lines). In C.
  neoformans, Yak1-like or Npr1-like kinases have not been identified or functionally
  characterized. Therefore, physical and functional relationships between Msl1 and
  other PKA downstream kinases remain to be elucidated in future studies (in gray
  symbols and dotted arrows). CAF-1, chromatin assembly factor 1. Zds1, zillion different
  screens 1.
