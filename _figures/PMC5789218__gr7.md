caption: 'A role for proteasome inhibition in the modulation of fibrogenic mechanisms
  mediated by RPE cells. TGFβ activates multiple pathways, including the Smad, Rho-like
  GTPase, PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, resulting in the transcription of several pro-fibrogenic
  genes such as CTGF, FN, FN EDA, VEGF and down-regulation of PPARγ transcription.
  These effects contribute to epithelial-mesenchymal transition processes in RPE cells
  and initiation of fibrosis. Proteasome inhibition halts cell cycle progression and
  downregulates transcription of FN, FN EDA, TGFβ, VEGF and TIMP-1 whilst transcription
  of the anti-fibrogenic factor PPARγ is up-regulated, also upon exposure to TGFβ.
  Effects of proteasome inhibition are depicted as dotted lines. Abbreviations: connective
  tissue growth factor (CTGF); fibronectin (FN); fibronectin EDA (FN EDA); MAP kinase
  pathway (MAPK); phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathway (PI3K/AKT); retinal pigment
  epithelium cells (RPE); Rho-like GTPase pathway (RhoA/ROCK); tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1
  (TIMP-1); transforming growth factor β (TGFβ); transforming growth factor receptor
  (TGFR); vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).'
