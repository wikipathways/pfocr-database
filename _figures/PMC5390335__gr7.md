caption: Regulatory signaling of osteocyte phenotypes mediated by extracellular DMP1.
  DMP1 binds to integrins and successively activates FAK. The FGF23 expression is
  down-regulated by the FAK-MAPK pathway, while the FAK-ROCK pathway is positively
  involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and osteocytic cellular process formation.
