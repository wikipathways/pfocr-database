caption: Model of the redox-dependent organization of the ALA synthesizing enzyme
  complexes. In light, the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway is actively channeling
  substrates from GluTR to GSAT and ensures high activity of the ALA synthesizing
  enzymes and allocation of sufficient amounts of the precursors for the synthesis
  of different end products. In darkness, GluTR interacts with FLU, which is assembled
  with CHL27 and POR. This protein complex represses ALA synthesis. It is assumed
  that the reduction of target cysteine residues in intramolecular disulfide bonds
  of GluTR are the pre-condition for the formation of a heterotetrameric GluTR2GSAT2
  complex or for high activity of ALA synthesizing enzymes in light. Oxidation of
  cysteine residues or formation of intra-/intermolecular disulfide bonds in darkness
  could additionally participate in the deactivation of GluTR (e.g., by stabilizing
  the interaction with FLU) and thus mediating the dark repression of ALA synthesis.
  Spatial separation of GluTR for heme synthesis by the GluTR-binding protein (GluBP)
  ensures ALA synthesis for the heme-synthesizing branch, although the bulk of ALA
  synthesizing activity is repressed by FLU.
