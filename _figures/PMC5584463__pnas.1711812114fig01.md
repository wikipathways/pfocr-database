caption: Zebra finch juveniles hearing song during a known sensitive period for the
  formation of the memory of conspecific tutor song (posthatch day 30) exhibit a significant
  increase in the mTOR signaling pathway in auditory areas critical for song memory
  formation related to song development. This increase does not occur in an adjacent
  auditory area, Field L, which is involved in general auditory processing. The increase
  is noted by the dark shading in the CMM and NCM. Males hearing silence do not exhibit
  this increase. In addition, juvenile females who do not go on to develop species-typical
  song do not exhibit this increase during the same time of development. Neither males
  nor females hearing song at an earlier age (posthatch day 23) exhibit any induction
  of the mTOR signaling pathway in response to song at this time (result not illustrated
  in this figure). Ahmadiantehrani and London () in subsequent experiments manipulated
  the expression of mTOR and found significant effects to song tutor copying (see
  text for more detail). Cb, cerebellum; D, dorsal; Hp, hippocampus; P, posterior.
