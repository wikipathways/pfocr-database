caption: Involvement of ubiquitin in the key signaling pathways important for IFN
  production and IFN responses. Illustrated on the left side of the grey dashed line,
  abnormal presence of vDNA (in dark blue) or viral dsRNA (in light blue) is detected
  by DNA sensor cGAS (Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) or RNA sensor RIG-I (Retinoic acid-inducible
  gene I), which triggers the activation of their respective signaling to induce IFN
  production as described in the text. On the right side of the grey dashed line,
  secreted IFN interacts with IFN receptor depicted in green Y-shaped line. IFN and
  receptor work in either autocrine or paracrine fashion to induce the activation
  of JAK/STAT pathway and promote ISG expression. Steps of IFN production and responses
  involving ubiquitination and viral regulations of the ubiquitination process are
  discussed in the text.
