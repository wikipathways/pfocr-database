caption: 'The mTOR signaling pathway and its important regulatory functions are shown.
  Activated mTORC1 results in increased protein synthesis via downstream effectors
  S6K1 and 4EBP1. AKT-mediated activation of NF-κB increases gene expression followed
  by cytokine and chemokine production. Rapamycin acts as the inhibitor of mTORC1
  (acute inhibition) and mTORC2 (chronic inhibition) that is crucial for affecting
  of the downstream pathway. Abbreviations: 4EBP1, eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 4E-binding protein 1; AKT, protein kinase B; AMPK, 5’-adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase; CaMKKβ, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-β; DEPTOR,
  DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein; FKBP12, FK506-binding protein of
  12 kDa; GF, growth factors; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; LKB1, liver kinase
  B1; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; mLST8,
  mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8; mSIN1, mammalian SAPK interacting protein
  1; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4,5)-trisphosphate; PKC-α, protein kinase C alpha; PRAS40, proline-rich AKT substrate
  of 40 kDa; PROTOR, protein observed with rictor; RAPTOR, regulatory associated protein
  of mTOR; Rheb, ras homolog enriched in brain; RICTOR, rapamycin-insensitive companion
