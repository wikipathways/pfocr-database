caption: Model of the control mechanisms acting on the transcriptional control of
  GNC and GNL. GNC and GNL expression is repressed by ARF2 (red) and ARF7 (blue).
  In addition, the abundance of their transcripts is under the direct repression control
  of the GA signaling cascade and the PIF repressors as well as indirect GA control
  by the stabilization of ARF2 (green). Other genes that are under ARF and PIF control
  may also be regulated in a manner similar to GNC and GNL. In addition, gene expression
  events that are under control of the auxin pathway may also be regulated by GA signaling
  because of the control of ARF2 abundance by GA. The individual pathways are shown
  in distinct colors.
