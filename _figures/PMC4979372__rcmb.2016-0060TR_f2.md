caption: Roles of apoE in normal lung health and respiratory disease. An apoE/low-density
  lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) pathway modulates developmental alveologenesis
  in male mice, mucous cell metaplasia, and airway hyperresponsiveness in experimental
  house dust mite–induced asthma, and internalization of mycobacterial lipids for
  presentation by antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells. Hypercholesterolemia
  in Apoe-deficient mice fed a high-fat or Western diet induces lung remodeling responses
  that may be relevant for the pathogenesis of emphysema, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis,
  and pulmonary hypertension. Increased inflammation and oxidative stress in Apoe-deficient
  mice augments cigarette smoke–induced emphysema and acute lung injury with a variety
  of causative factors. BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase;
  SIRT1, sirtuin 1.
