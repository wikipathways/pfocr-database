caption: 'Many molecules regulate apoptosis and Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. Anti-apoptotic
  molecules are indicated in blue, whereas pro-apoptotic molecules are indicated in
  green. Most anti-apoptotic molecules, such as metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma
  transcript 1 (MALAT1), serine/threonine kinase 38 like (STK38L), inhibitor of nuclear
  factor kappa B kinase subunit epsilon (IKBKE), Itch, S100 calcium-binding protein
  A1 (S100 A1), Ajuba, transcription factor AP-2 Gamma (TFAP2C), WW domain binding
  protein 5 (WBP5), lncRNA PCGEM1, Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA), usually
  allow YAP to enter the nucleus to interact with TEA domain (TEAD) family transcription
  factors and to activate the expression of anti-apoptotic genes. Some molecules,
  such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and forkhead box protein A1
  (FoxA1) inhibit cell apoptosis by inducing the transcription of the YAP gene. In
  addition, deltaNp63 can suppress YAP gene expression to impair p73-mediated apoptosis.
  However, the role of deltaNp63 in YAP gene expression is still a matter of controversy.
  Moreover, Calcium-binding tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated protein (CABYR-a and
  CABYR-b, CABYR-a/b) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)
  signaling lead to phosphorylation of YAP at serine 127 and attenuate nuclear YAP/p73-mediated
  apoptosis. Additionally, PI3K/AKT signaling can also suppress apoptosis by upregulate
  CD166 expression. Most of the pro-apoptotic molecules, such as G-protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCRs), cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), Crumbs-3 (CRB-3), Ras
  association domain family member 6 (RASSF6), AMP-activation protein kinase (AMPK),
  enhance apoptosis by inducing phosphorylation of YAP and thereby impairing nuclear
  accumulation of YAP. In addition, some pro-apoptotic molecules, such as Fbxw7, miR520c-3p,
  miR132, and hsa-miR-138-2-3p enhance the degradation or block the expression of
  YAP. In addition, RAS association domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) and early
  growth response-1 (EGR-1) can induce pro-apoptotic genes via the YAP-p73-p300-PML
  complex. T bar: Inhibition. Arrow: Increase.'
