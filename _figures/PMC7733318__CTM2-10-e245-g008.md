caption: The proposed working model. TGF‐β1 transcriptionally activates PSG9 expression
  through the canonical TGF‐β receptor‐Smad pathway. In turn, PSG9 enhances the stability
  of Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 by blocking their proteasomal degradation. As a result,
  PSP9 contributes to TGF‐β1‐induced epithelial‐mesenchymal transition, breast cancer
  cell migration and invasion, and the expression levels of TGF‐β target genes
papertitle: Pregnancy‐specific glycoprotein 9 acts as both a transcriptional target
  and a regulator of the canonical TGF‐β/Smad signaling to drive breast cancer progression.
