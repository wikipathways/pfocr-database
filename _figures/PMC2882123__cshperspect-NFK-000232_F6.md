caption: Toll pathway in adult Drosophila melanogaster. Signaling through Toll involves
  the receptor/adaptor complex, composed of three death-domain-containing proteins,
  MyD88, Tube, and Pelle. The trimeric complex assembles around the bipartite DD of
  Tube. It is unclear how the signal is transduced from the complex to Cactus, a homolog
  of IkB. Phosphorylated Cactus is degraded after polyubiquitination by the proteasome.
  The liberated DIF is translocated to the nucleus and binds to NF-κB response elements,
  inducing the expression of hundreds of genes, namely those encoding antimicrobial
  peptides, such as drosomycin.
