caption: Regulation of hepcidin and iron homeostasis. (a) Under conditions of iron
  repletion, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) is upregulated. Binding of BMP to the
  BMP receptor (BMPR)/hemojuvelin (HJV) complex activates phosphorylation of Caenorhabditis
  elegans SMA/Drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD), which then activates
  transcription of hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (HAMP) gene. Under inflammatory
  conditions, interleukin-6 (IL-6) activates the Janus kinase/signal transducer and
  activator of transcription (STAT) pathway that also activates transcription of HAMP.
  Hepcidin is then secreted by the liver and is able to bind ferroportin (FPN), a
  key exporter of iron into the circulation, on the surface of iron exporting cells
  such as macrophages and enterocytes. The binding of hepcidin to FPN results in the
  internalization and subsequent degradation of FPN, reducing iron export into the
  circulation. This then reduces the amount of transferrin-bound iron within the circulation,
  limiting the availability of iron for key biological processes, including erythropoiesis.
  (b) Under conditions of hypoxia or iron deprivation, transcription of HAMP is inhibited
  in hepatocytes via multiple mechanisms that are regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor,
  including furin-mediated conversion of membrane-bound HJV to soluble HJV (s-HJV),
  which can interfere with BMP signaling; erythroferrone (ERFE) produced during erythropoiesis
  signaling; and activation of the Ras rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (Ras/RAF-MAPK)–mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.
  In the absence of hepcidin, iron is able to mobilize from cells to be used in heme
  formation during erythropoiesis. DCytB, duodenal cytochrome B; DMT1, divalent metal
  transporter 1; IL-6R, IL-6 receptor; TF, transferrin; TFR1, TF receptor 1.
