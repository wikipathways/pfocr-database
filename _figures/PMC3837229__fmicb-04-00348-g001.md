caption: 'Simplified representation of “selfish” and “cooperative” energetic behaviors
  in lactic acid bacteria. The key characteristics of “selfish” and “cooperative”
  energetic behaviors are indicated. The dotted red line separates the metabolic reactions
  that confer a “selfish” or a “cooperative” behavior. In lactic acid bacteria (LAB),
  mono- or disaccharides are catabolized: (i) to pyruvate via glycolysis, with the
  production of ATP and NADH, or ii) trough the exose monophosphate pathway (EMP),
  the heterofermentative pathway. The yellow arrow shows the regeneration of NAD+
  that occurs during heme-dependent respiration. In Lactococcus lactis and in other
  LAB, the excess pyruvate can be metabolized by pyruvate formate lyase (Pfl), pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (Pdh) giving a mixed-acid fermentation with production of acetate.
  Ygf is the operon involved in heme homeostasis, and cydA is the gene for the cytochrome
  bd oxidase subunit I as described for L. lactis (). Arrows show the metabolic fluxes.'
