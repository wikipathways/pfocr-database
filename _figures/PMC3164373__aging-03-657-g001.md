caption: Mitochondrial creatine kinase (CKMT1) phosphorylates creatine (Cr) and converts
  it to phosphocreatine (PCr), while brain-type creatine kinase (CKB) regenerates
  ATP from PCr. Because the stereocilia contain no mitochondria, the PCr-CK system
  plays a critical role in hair bundles of hair cells. Expression of mutant Huntingtin
  (Htt) in hair cells impairs the functioning of mitochondria, suppresses the expression
  of CKB, and elevates levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Creatine supplementation
  in HD mice ameliorates the reduced expression of CKB via an unidentified pathway,
  and subsequently improves the hearing impairment in HD mice.
