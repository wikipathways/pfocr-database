caption: Signal transduction pathways for Ras/Raf-mediated growth inhibition and differentiation.
  The potential growth-inhibitory signaling by Ras/Raf is depicted. The autocrine-paracrine
  signaling diverges from the intracellular signaling distal to MEK/ERK. The extracellular
  pathway mediates its effect through LIF expression and activation of JAK-STAT3.
