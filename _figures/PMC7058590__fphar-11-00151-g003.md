caption: Hypothetical mechanisms of NRF2 activation by NDGA. (A) The E3 ligase adapter
  KEAP1 recognizes the Neh2 domain of NRF2, leading to its ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation. NDGA might inhibit KEAP1 by making adducts with specific cysteines
  of KEAP1, including Cys151. (B) The Neh6 domain of NRF2 is a target for phosphorylation
  by the Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3). This phosphorylation creates a site for
  recognition by the E3 ligase adapter beta-TrCP, leading to its ubiquitination and
  proteasomal degradation. GSK-3 is inhibited by phosphorylation at its N-terminus
  by several kinases including AKT. NDGA might inhibit GSK-3 indirectly through adduct
  formation with the catalytic Cys124 of PTEN. Inhibition of PTEN results in sustained
  activation of AKT and inhibition of GSK-3, therefore allowing NRF2 to escape this
  degradation pathway. See text for details of both mechanisms.
