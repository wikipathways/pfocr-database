caption: 'Enrichment of fixed SNPs and Indels in an extended Notch pathway. The Notch
  pathway was adapted from KEGG () by adding Notch interactors from the literature
  to create an expanded Notch signaling pathway. Genes differentially expressed in
  larva (expression levels from Zhou et al.) () are cyan (up-regulated) or yellow
  (down-regulated), genes showing no change in expression are gray, and untested genes
  are white. Genes for which one more SNP and/or indels became fixed are indicated
  with stars: red for genes located within a hypoxia-selected region and blue for
  all others.'
