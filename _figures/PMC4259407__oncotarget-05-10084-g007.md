caption: In the steady state, cIAPs lead to poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation
  of NIK via their RING domain together with TRAF2 and TRAF3. The degradation of NIK
  results in the suppression of the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. Binding
  of HAX1 to the cIAPs results in the auto-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation
  of cIAPs. Consequently, reduced cIAP levels leads to the stabilization of NIK, which
  induces activation of the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway.
