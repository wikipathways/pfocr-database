caption: 'The initial step of PGE2synthesis is the stimulus-induced liberation of
  AA from the membrane phospholipids by PLA2 enzymes. AA is then sequentially metabolized
  into PGG2 and then to PGH2 by either COX-1 or COX-2. PGH2 is an unstable intermediate
  prostanoid, which is rapidly converted into various prostanoids by specific terminal
  prostaglandin synthases, of which prostaglandin E synthases (mPGES-1, mPGES-2 and
  cPGES) generate PGE2 from PGH2. The other synthases include PGIS that forms PGI2,
  PGDS for PGD2, PGFS for PGF2α and TXS for TXA2. PGI2 is non-enzymatically metabolized
  to the more stable 6-keto PGF1α. PGE2 mediates inflammation, stimulates cell growth
  and angiogenesis, and also inhibits apoptosis.†Upregulated in cancers.AA: Arachidonic
  acid; PGDS: Prostaglandin D synthase; PGE2: Prostaglandin E2; PGFS: Prostaglandin
