caption: 'ERM structure and function in immune cells. (A) Domain organization of ERM:
  X-ray crystallographic studies reveal that the N-terminal FERM domain contains a
  globular clover leaf-shape (), classified into 3 distinct subdomains (blue box indicates
  residue numbers that make up each F subdomain). The FERM domain contains multiple
  interaction sites: a cryptic ITAM (sequence shown), which can recruit Syk, a PIP2
  binding site and a region responsible for binding to L-selectin. The tyrosine kinase
  Lck is responsible for phosphorylating Y145 of the FERM domain in T-cells (). Src
  phosphorylation of Y353 in the central coiled-coil domain of ezrin can lead to the
  recruitment of class I PI3K, via the p85 regulatory subunit (). Although originally
  identified in columnar epithelial cells, confocal microscopic colocalisation of
  PI3K with phospho-Y353-ezrin is witnessed in T-cell receptor-stimulated T-cells
  (). These observations suggest that a PI3K/ezrin interaction is possible in leukocytes.
  (B) ERM proteins reside in the cytosol as inactivate parallel homodimers or in an
  autoinhibited conformation. Binding of ERM to PIP2 within the inner leaflet of the
  plasma membrane (purple circles) alleviates the inactive conformation, allowing
  the C-terminal domain to interact with filamentous actin (F-actin). In this manner,
  ERM are typically classified as membrane/cytoskeleton cross-linkers. The kinase
  activity of serine/threonine kinases (e.g., ROCK, PKC, or LOK) target a conserved
  threonine residue in all unfolded ERM (T567 in ezrin, T564 in radixin, and T558
  in moesin), stabilizing the open conformation. Recent evidence suggests that ezrin
  might be involved in regulating intracellular signaling, whereas moesin regulates
  the clustering of L-selectin prior to its ectodomain shedding by ADAM17 (). One
  pathway in which ERM are inactivated has been shown in T-cells, where binding of
  CXCR4 to CXCL12 leads to the rapid dephosphorylation and microvillar collapse of
  ERM (). Although not fully understood, Rac is known to act upstream of the ERM phosphatase
  (, ).'
