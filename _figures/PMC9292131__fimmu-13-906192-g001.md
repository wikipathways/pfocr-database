caption: 'Schematic illustration of the proposed Imd pathway in Tenebrio molitor and
  its possible cross-talks. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs; PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE)
  are triggered by DAP-type PGN of the bacterial cell wall. Recognition of Gram-negative
  bacteria further triggers the recruitment of intracellular proteins TmIMD, TmFADD,
  and TmDREDD. TmTAK1/TmTAB2, activated by TmIMD, further activates TmIKK complex.
  TmRelish is subsequently phosphorylated by the TmIKK complex and then cleaved by
  TmDredd. Eventually, it leads to the translocation of TmRelish into the nucleus,
  where it binds to the relevant transcription response elements and triggers AMP
  production. Solid black arrows indicate the identified interactions between Imd
  signaling compartments. Blue dashed arrows indicate putative cross-talks between
  Imd and other signaling pathways via TmIKKs complex, TmRelish, and ligand Spaetzle
  in T. molitor. Red dashed arrows indicate the putative cross-talks identified in
  other insects. Abbreviations: PGRP; Peptidoglycan recognition protein, IMD; Immune
  deficiency, FADD; Fas-associated protein with death domain, DREDD; death-related
  ced-3/Nedd2-like protein, TAK1; Transforming growth factor-activated kinase1, TAB2;
  TAK binding protein 2, IKK; Inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (IκB) kinase, AMP; Antimicrobial
  peptide, JNK; c-Jun N-terminal kinase.'
