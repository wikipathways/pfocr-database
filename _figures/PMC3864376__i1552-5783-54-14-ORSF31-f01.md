caption: Scheme of proposed relationship between chronic stress, protective capacities,
  proteolytic editing machinery and age-related disease. When young, proteins are
  intact and cell and tissue functions are retained. Upon exposure to various stresses
  (red) including consuming higher glycemic index diets the proteins are damaged and
  become dysfunctional and cytotoxic. Adequate levels of antioxidants and antioxidant
  enzymes (yellow) ameliorate these stresses (dashed lines) and preserve proteolytic
  function. If sufficient proteolytic capacity exists, damaged proteins can be removed
  and function retained (upper right). If, however, the proteolytic machines (ubiquitin
  proteolytic pathway and autophagic lysosomal pathways) are rendered insufficient,
  proteins will aggregate and cytotoxicity will ensue, resulting in compromised tissue
  function, including cataracts, AMD, and glaucoma (lower right).
