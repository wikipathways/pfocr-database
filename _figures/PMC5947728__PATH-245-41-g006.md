caption: Proposed positive feedback loop for the regulation of PI3K/Akt and GnT‐V
  to promote HCC metastasis. During EMT, transcription factors (TFs) accumulate in
  the nuclei of cancer cells to activate GnT‐V expression. GnT‐V then leads to global
  alteration of β1,6‐branched glycans on cell surface molecules, including CD147/basigin,
  altering the response of cancer cells to their microenvironment, which consequently
  promotes metastasis. When the PI3K/Akt pathway is inhibited, GnT‐V expression decreases;
  furthermore, PI3K signaling is suppressed when the synthesis of β1,6‐GlcNAc‐branched
  N‐glycans catalyzed by GnT‐V is interrupted.

  of CD147/basigin with integrin β1 and promotes HCC metastasis.
