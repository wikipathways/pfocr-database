caption: A, hypothetical model of d-glucose-dependent NO-mediated iron mobilization
  from cells. Studies using a variety of metabolizable and non-metabolizable sugars
  demonstrated that NO-mediated iron mobilization from cells is dependent on the transport
  of d-glucose into cells and its metabolism (). Glucose is used by the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle for the production of ATP and by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
  for the generation of NADPH, which is involved in the synthesis of GSH (). NO either
  diffuses or is transported into cells by protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) (). Once
  within cells, NO intercepts and binds iron bound to proteins or iron that is en
  route to ferritin. The high affinity of NO for iron results in the formation of
  DNICs (represented here as GS-Fe-NO). GSH may either be involved as a reductant
  to remove iron from endogenous ligands and/or complete the iron coordination shell
  along with NO in the DNIC. This complex as an intact entity or its separate components
  can be released from the cell by an active process requiring MRP1. This model has
  been modified from Ref. . G-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate. B, schematic illustrating
  the respective roles of GST P1-1 and MRP1 in NO storage and transport. NO can diffuse
  through the membrane or may be actively transported into cells by protein-disulfide
  isomerase (). Because of the ability of NO to act as a ligand, it can bind iron
  transported into cells and released from Tf. GSH completes the coordination sphere
  of the NO-iron complex to form a DNIC. DNICs can be bound by GST P1-1 or effluxed
  out of cells via MRP1 (, ).
