caption: The ROCK signaling pathway with focus on survival and regeneration. Nogo,
  MAG, OMgp present on the surface of oligodendrocytes confer their inhibitory activity
  via a trimeric receptor complex comprising NgR1, LINGO-1, and p75NTR to activate
  RhoA. Sema5A and several Ephrins can also contribute to RhoA activation via their
  plexin or Eph receptors, respectively. Additionally, G protein-coupled receptor
  (GPCR) stimulation by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P)
  results in the activation of the small GTPase RhoA. GTP-bound RhoA further activates
  ROCK to phosphorylate several substrates that are involved in regulation of cell
  shape and motility but also in survival pathways. Caspase-3 and granzyme B are able
  to proteolytically cleave and thus activate ROCK. Myosin light chain (MLC) is a
  substrate of activated ROCK and its phosphorylation results in actomyosin contraction.
  In addition ROCK can inactivate MLC phosphatase (MLCP) and thus indirectly regulate
  MLC phosphorylation. Being a serine/threonine kinase, ROCK can activate LIM kinase-1
  (LIMK1) that then inactivates cofilin/actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) by phosphorylation
  promoting actin filament stabilization. The phosphorylation of ERM proteins leads
  to Actin-membrane linkage. Adducin is a protein that after activation binds to f-actin
  promoting the association of spectrin and f-actin and thus assembling the actin
  network. Another downstream target of ROCK is PTEN, which negatively regulates Akt/PKB
  signaling by antagonizing PIP3. If active, Akt in turn activates Rheb because of
  inhibition of Tsc1/2, and subsequently stimulates mTORC1, which finally leads to
  an enhancement of general translation with an increase in protein synthesis and
  cell. ROCK1 may also physically interact with Tsc2.
