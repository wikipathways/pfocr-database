caption: 'Acidosis triggers TGF-β2 upregulation/activation in a TSP1-dependent manner
  (1) and promotes an autocrine signaling pathway through TGF-βRI receptor and subsequent
  Smad2/3 phosphorylation (2) in cancer cells. TGFβ2-mediated signaling pathways induce
  a partial EMT gene programme (3) as well as a PKCζ-dependent translocation of CD36
  fatty acid translocase to the plasma membrane (4). TGF-β2 autocrine signaling, in
  acidosis-adapted cancer cells, favors the uptake of long-chain fatty acids (5),
  the latter being oxidized in mitochondria for energy production (6) but also stored,
  as neutral lipids (triacylglycerols) in lipid droplets, in a DGAT1-dependent manner
  (7); the resulting increase in the cellular acetyl-CoA pool accounts for an overall
  increase in the acetylation of proteins, including Smad2 (thereby increasing its
  transcriptional activity). Both TGFβ2-induced partial EMT and lipid storage participate
  to increase survival (i.e., anoikis resistance) and invasion capacities that support
  in vivo metastatic spreading, ATP needs being fulfilled by FAO upon preferred hydrolysis
  of TG stored into LD (8). Inhibitors able to block different steps of the acidosis-induced
  TGF-β2/DGAT1 axis are indicated in red. ACSL1: acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family
  member 1; ATGL: adipose triglyceride lipase; CPT1: carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  1; DAG: diacylglycerol; endo: endosomes; FA: fatty acids; PKCζ: protein kinase C
  ζ; PLIN2: perilipin 2; TAG: triacylglycerol; TSP-1: thrombospondin-1.'
