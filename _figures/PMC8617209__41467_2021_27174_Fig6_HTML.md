caption: a A structural overview of the two proton transfer pathways. The K and D-pathway
  are defined by their respective amino acids. Several water molecules could be assigned
  in each pathway and an accumulated water cluster could be seen near the A-ring propionate
  of heme a3, presumably the proton-loading site (PLS). b A redox-dependent positional
  change of the side chain of the key residue Lys354.I, located in the K-pathway,
  was observed. It looks as the reduction of the BNC leads to an electrostatic attraction
  of the potentially positively charged side chain of Lys354.I. The corresponding
  density map is illustrated as a white surface. Illustrated map densities are filtered
  to equal contour levels of 1.
