caption: Ozone antiviral intracellular mechanism. The 4-HNE formed following ozone
  (O2-O3) treatment interacts in the cytoplasm directly with the nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), which freed from inhibition with the Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1 (Keap-1), inhibits the activity of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-kβ) also after its translocation into the nucleus. Here,
  Nrf-2 acts as a second messenger binding to the musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma
  transcription factor (MAF) and to the antioxidant responsive elements (ARE) regions.
  This process allows transcription of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase
  (Sod), catalase (Cat), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST),
  glutathione reductase (GR), and the system thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase (Trx/TrxR),
  NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and hemeoxygenase (HO-1), all aimed at counteracting
  reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species overproduction and restoring the
  physiological redox balance. The formation of the complex Nrf2/MAF/ARE also results
  in the inhibition of the transcription of pro-oxidant enzymes, such as cycloxygenase
  (COX) and the inducible isoform of the nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), or pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α. NQO1 is a detoxificant enzyme that
  protects cells from oxidative stress by lowering reactive oxidizing species, protecting
  DNA, proteins and lipids from hyperoxia damage. HO-1 synthesis is boosted by the
  4-HNE-mediated increase of Nrf2 levels. HO-1 lowers oxidative stress by inhibiting
  the high level of expression of HIF-1α, a molecular O2 sensor which is activated
  during inflammation, and protecting epithelium damage from apoptosis and thrombosis
  by downregulating platelet activation. Through the activation of Nrf2, 4-HNE inhibits
  the activity of the inflammasome, a pro-inflammatory complex formed by the nucleotide-binding
  domain leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing receptor 3 (NLRP3), the adaptor
  apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) and the caspase 1 effector protein.
  The inflammasome inhibition blocks the activation of caspase 1 and inflammatory
  interleukins, favoring in turn the anti-inflammatory cytokines production and consequently
  the downregulation of the apoptotic pathways. The IL-10 pathway anti-inflammatory
  response, stimulated by the ozone antioxidant reaction, contributes to the decrease
  of the thrombotic activity and prevents vascular injury.
