caption: Proposed mechanism by which PSD-95 interferes with D1–NMDA receptor interaction
  and uncouples modulation of D1 function by the NMDA receptor. A, When activated
  by DA, stand-alone D1 receptor stimulates adenylate cyclase, increases the production
  of cAMP, and signals through the PKA/DARPP-32/PP1 cascade to modulate various downstream
  effectors and substrates, including NMDA receptors. D1 receptors also undergo agonist-induced
  internalization via the classical dynamin-dependent, vesicle-mediated endocytic
  pathway (not shown) to regulate the surface availability and responsiveness of the
  receptor. B, Association with activated NMDA receptors can enhance D1 surface availability
  and signaling through multiple mechanisms, e.g., inhibition of D1 endocytosis, facilitation
  of D1 exocytosis (not shown), or allosteric trapping by NMDA receptors (not shown),
  leading to a reciprocal facilitation of the NMDA receptor through the PKA/DARPP-32/PP1
  cascade. C, Presence of PSD-95 in the D1/NMDA receptor complex places a physical
  as well as a functional (dotted line) barrier between these receptors, weakening
  their interaction. This barrier could in theory abolish NMDA receptor-dependent
  D1 surface recruitment, regardless of the mechanisms involved. As a result, D1-mediated
  cAMP signaling is dampened, NMDA receptor potentiation is suppressed, and the positive
  D1–NMDA receptor feedback is ultimately antagonized. PSD-95 also promotes constitutive
  D1 endocytosis, adding another level of inhibition on D1signaling. Line thickness
  and arrowhead size indicate signaling strength. Red and blue colors indicate stimulation
  and inhibition, respectively.
