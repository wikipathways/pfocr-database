caption: ncRNAs function as integral components of the heat shock response in mammals.
  The heat shock response is typically characterized by the rapid trimerization/activation
  of HSF1 and subsequent transcriptional induction of heat shock proteins (e.g., HSPA1A,
  HSPA6, etc.). ncRNAs including lncRNAs and miRNAs are often overlooked regulators
  of the heat shock response pathway. This model illustrates the diverse functional
  roles that ncRNAs play or likely play in heat stress. Select examples of lncRNA
  (black boxes) and miRNA (white boxes) involved in the heat shock response are delineated
  by solid lines. Dashed lines define putative functional interactions of ncRNA not
  yet examined/reported
