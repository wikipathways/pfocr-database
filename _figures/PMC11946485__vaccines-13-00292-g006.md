caption: Nanoparticle or liposome encapsulation provides a promising strategy to improve
  the delivery and effectiveness of PI3K inhibitors and cancer vaccines within the
  tumor microenvironment. Encapsulation protects the PI3K inhibitors from premature
  degradation and ensures targeted release at the tumor site, improving drug bioavailability
  and reducing off-target effects. The nanoparticles are engineered to deliver their
  payload near tumor cells, enabling the inhibitors to effectively interfere with
  the PI3K signaling pathway by targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and downstream
  signaling molecules such as PIP3, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. This approach
  not only enhances the therapeutic efficacy of PI3K inhibitors but also provides
  a platform for co-delivery with cancer vaccines, synergistically modulating the
  immune response and improving antitumor efficacy
