caption: 'Advanced glycation end products (AGE)-induced regulation of glycemic homeostasis
  and glycemic homeostasis: participation of inflammatory and endoplasmic reticulum
  stress. In adipose and muscle tissues, AGE/CML binding to AGER and TLR activate
  the ER-stress response, including increased expression and/or activation of BIP,
  ENPL, XBP1, DDIT3, IRE1 and TRAF2. XBP1 and BIP activate ATF6, which is a repressor
  of the transcription factor PRGC1A and MEF2A (enhancers of Slc2a4 gene), thus decreasing
  Slc2a4 expression. On the other, IRE1/TRAF2 activation overlap the inflammatory
  pathway phosphorylating IKKA/B, and promoting NFKB dissociation and migration into
  the nucleus, where it plays a potent repressor effect upon Slc2a4 gene expression.
  Besides, intracellular MGO can contribute to the increase in the activity of proinflammatory
  cytokines, reinforcing this pathway. These effects on the Slc2a4 gene expression
  decreases GLUT4 synthesis and plasma membrane content, eventually decreasing insulin-induced
  glucose uptake, and establishing IR. In turn, IR leads to hyperglycemia, which can
  cause T2D or worsen preexisting DM. Symbols are: AGE, advanced glycated end product;
  AGER, advanced glycation end product-specific receptor, alias RAGE; ATF6, cyclic
  AMP-dependent transcription factor ATF; BIP, endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BIP,
  alias GRP78; CEBPA, CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; CML, carboxymethyl-lysine;
  DM, diabetes mellitus; DDIT3, DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 protein, alias CHOP10/GADD153;
  DM, diabetes mellitus; ENPL, endoplasmin, alias GRP94; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  GLUT4, solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member 4; IKKA/B,
  inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunits alpha/beta; IR, insulin resistance;
  IRE1, inositol requiring enzyme-1; MGO, methylglyoxal; MEF2A, myocyte enhancer factor
  2A; NFKB, nuclear factor NF-kappa-B; PRGC1A, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  gamma coactivator 1-alpha, alias PGC1A; Slc2a4, solute carrier family 2 member 4
  gene; T2D, type 2 diabetes mellitus; TLR, toll-like receptors; TRAF2, TNF receptor-associated
