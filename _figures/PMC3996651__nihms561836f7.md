caption: A schematic representation of the anticancer activity of clotrimazole using
  data presented herein and earlier published. The mitochondrial-bound hexokinase
  II enzyme converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate in the first step of the glycolysis
  pathway. Clotrimazole disrupts the glycolysis pathway by the translocation of hexokinase
  II from the voltage-dependent anion channel on the outer mitochondrial membrane
  to the cytoplasm [,,]. Bax is now capable of binding to the voltage-dependent anion
  channel and inducing the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, thereby inducing
  apoptosis []. The translocation of hexokinase II interferes with the glycolysis
  pathway and reduces ATP production []. The cell responds by arresting in late G1,
  thereby preventing the cells from progressing into the DNA synthesis phase []. The
  arrested cells are sensitive to radiation and cisplatin treatments, with an enhancement
  of apoptosis [].
