caption: Network of gene interactions among genes differentially expressed using STRING.
  Genes used in the analysis were previously classified within the phenylpropanoid
  metabolic pathway and a series of TFs differentially expressed. Each node represents
  the interaction, described in the literature, between the proteins differentially-expressed
  in Arabidopsis over-expressing PrMADS10.
