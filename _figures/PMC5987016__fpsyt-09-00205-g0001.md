  leading to psychiatric manifestations. Image generated using Servier Medical Art.
  1: Various detrimental factors compromising intestinal barrier lead to increased
  intestinal permeability. 2: Increased intestinal permeability is as a source of
  food derived and microbial, bacterial, parasitic antigens, and subsequent activation
  of inflammatory response with production of immunoglobulins against those antigens.
  Other markers of increased intestinal permeability. 3: Detrimental for the brain
  immune consequences of gut derived antigens modulate neuro-psychiatric symptomatology.
  4: Peripheral autoimmunity (via molecular mimicry, covalent binding) due to various
  gut derived antigens and further activation of inflammatory response detrimental
  to CNS via e.g., pro-inflammatory cytokines, activation, and changes in kynurenic
  pathway metabolism. 5: Factors compromising blood-brain-barrier contribute to the
  periphery-derived activation of inflammatory response and its psychiatric and neurological
  manifestations. CRH, corticoliberin; SIBO, small intestine bacterial overgrowth;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; IgA,
  IgE, IgG, IgM, immunoglobulin A, E, G, M; LPS, bacterial lipopolysaccharide; LBP,
  lipopolysaccharide binding protein; sCD14, soluble CD14; NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartate
  glutamate receptor; MBP, myelin basic protein; MAG, myelin-associated glycoprotein;
  GM1, ganglioside; SULF, sufatide; CONSO4, chondroitin sulfate; MOG, myelin oligodendrocyte
  glycoprotein; α,β-CRYS, α,β-crystallin; NAFP, neurofilament proteins; CPP, Chlamydia
  pneumoniae; STM6P, streptococcal M protein; BTN, milk butyrophilin; DPP IV, dipeptidyl
  peptidase IV (synonym of CD26); 51Cr-EDTA, chromium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid;
  ASCA, IgG to Saccharomyces cerevisiae; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4.'
