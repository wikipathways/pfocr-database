caption: A genetic model for sex determination, controlled by a balance of antagonistic
  pathways. In XY gonads, Sry triggers upregulation of Sox9, leading to Sertoli cell
  commitment and testicular differentiation. Sertoli cell differentiation is a result
  of the establishment of a positive feedback loop between Sox9 and secretion of Fgf9
  (and also PGD2; not shown), which act in a paracrine manner to recruit additional
  Sertoli cells. In XX gonads, two independent signaling pathways involving the Rspo1/Wnt4/β-catenin
  pathway and Foxl2 tilt the balance towards the female side and silence Sox9 and
  Fgf9. Arrows indicate stimulation; T bars indicate inhibition.
