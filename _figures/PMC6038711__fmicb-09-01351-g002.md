caption: 'Different mechanisms of multidrug resistance adopted by fungal cells. The
  main mechanisms of drug resistance against azoles, polyenes, echinocandins, and
  flucytosine include: (a) alteration of the enzyme target (genes encoding ergosterol
  biosynthetic pathway enzymes – AZOLES, glucan synthases – ECHINOCANDINS, cytosine
  deaminase or uracil phosphoribosyltransferase – FLUCYTOSINE) leading to poor binding
  of toxic drugs to its enzyme target sites, (b) overexpression of drug efflux proteins
  leading to increased efflux – AZOLES, (c) changes in membrane property/composition
  affecting normal drug import – FLUCYTOSINE, (d) Reduction of sterols in plasma membrane
  – POLYENES. Colored balls mean antifungal molecules.'
