caption: Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 activate the STAT6 signaling cascade, leading
  to downregulated expression of epidermal differentiation proteins, induction of
  the eosinophilic chemoattractant CCL26, and histopathological features such as spongiosis
  and apoptosis. Under normal conditions, PTPN1 dephosphorylates STAT6, resulting
  in a regulatory feedback loop. However, oxidative stress caused by Th2 cytokines
  inactivates PTPN1, leading to sustained STAT6 signaling. Coal tar–mediated activation
  of the AHR signaling pathway leads to enhanced epidermal differentiation and possible
  improvement of epidermal barrier function, thereby attenuating allergen exposure
  and reducing inflammatory cues. Importantly, coal tar activates the AHR/NRF2 signaling
  pathway, enabling detoxification of reactive oxygen species. This may prevent the
  oxidative inactivation of PTPN1 and lead to decreased STAT6 signaling, normalization
  of skin barrier protein expression, and downregulation of CCL26 expression.
