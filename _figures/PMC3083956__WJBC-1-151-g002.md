caption: Local (cellular) and systemic anti-viral response in Drosophila. In local
  anti-viral response, the viral particle infects host cell via endocytosis or is
  taken up by host receptor yet to be identified. Upon infection, viral RNA is processed
  to dsRNA[], which evokes RNAi pathway response. The activation of the RNAi pathway,
  specifically small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway, leads to the RNA-induced silencing
  complex (RISC)/siRNA-mediated degradation of viral RNA. It appears that the viral
  dsRNA can be taken up by un-infected neighboring cells to spread protective RNAi.
  The other systemic anti-viral mechanism is mediated by the JAK/STAT pathway. The
  infected cells produce signals that activate the JAK/STAT pathway by currently unknown
  mechanisms and lead to production of antiviral factors.
