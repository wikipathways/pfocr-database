caption: The protective role of the SIRT pathway in aging and AD pathogenesis. Briefly,
  low energy-induced SIRT could deacetylate various downstream transcriptional factors
  including PGC1, FOXO, p53 or p65 to govern the biological processes including autophagy
  and apoptosis. Where indicated, red arrow indicates positive regulation, and black
  line suggests negative regulation.
