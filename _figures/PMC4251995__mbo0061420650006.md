caption: Working model of DesK-DesR allosteric regulation. (A) Superposition of the
  active (blue) and inactive (yellow) conformations of the REC domain of DesR, illustrated
  in cartoon representations. BeF3− is bound to Asp54. Mg2+ is shown as a purple sphere.
  The direct link between the α1 shift and the competent position of Mg-coordinating
  Asp9 is highlighted. (B) Same orientation as in panel A, showing in solid colors
  the superposition between the active (cyan) and inactive (green) conformations of
  VraR (). Note the side chain of Asp10, which, in concert with the movement of helix
  α1, shifts its side chain away from the cation coordination sphere. In a transparent
  representation (red), the equivalent Asp14 of inactive NarL () is highlighted adopting
  a similar distant position. RR468 () displays the same Asp10 rearrangement (not
  shown for clarity). (C) The calculated model of DesK-DesR complex is shown in the
  same orientation as in the previous panels. DesK is green, and the color code for
  the active and inactive forms of DesR are identical to those in panel A. Note the
  predicted favorable interactions between the active state of DesR and the kinase
  with contacts between the α1 helices of both partners (DesK Leu200 is predicted
  to occupy a position similar to that of/ DesR Met12 in the DesR homodimer). Phosphorylatable
  His188 is shown as a reference. (D) The cell membrane is shown at the top. Depicted
  is the three-state conformational transition of DesK based on the structural data
  we have previously reported (); the 3D structure of its transmembrane domain is
  still not known. The asymmetric structure adopted by P-DesK forms a phosphotransfer
  complex with DesR, shifting the conformational equilibrium of the RR population
  toward the active state (preactivation) and transferring the phosphate. P-DesR increases
  the half-life of the active conformation, allowing for functional dimers to form.
  In the absence of phosphorylation (e.g., nonphosphorylatable DesR mutant variants),
  a higher DesR concentration is essential for stabilization of the activated conformation
  (see  in the supplemental material). The pathway is shut down by DesK in its phosphatase
  state, forming a complex with monomeric P~DesR. The DesR dimer binds first the high-affinity
  (RA) and then the lower-affinity (RB) DNA-binding site (). DesR dimer-dimer interactions
  through the α4β6α6 interface seem crucial to the achievement of full RB occupancy.
