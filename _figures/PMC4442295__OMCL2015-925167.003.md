caption: 'Different signaling pathways activated by H2S showing the cardioprotective
  effects. H2S can protect heart against diseases via different mechanisms: H2S prevents
  inflammatory response mediated by inflammatory cytokines. H2S stimulates angiogenesis
  by increasing the expression of VEGF and activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K) and Akt. H2S activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and augments
  NO bioavailability. H2S significantly protects against cardiomyocyte apoptosis by
  suppressing the activation of caspase-3 and upregulating the expression of glycogen
  synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3β). H2S plays its role by regulating the expression of miRNA.
  H2S also protects mitochondrial function via inhibition of mitochondrial respiration.
  H2S exerts antioxidative action by activating nuclear-factor-E2-related factor-2
  (Nrf2) dependent pathway and scavenging of ROS. H2S opens KATP channels, increases
  Na+ channels (Nav) current, and inhibits L-type Ca2+ channels and chloride channels,
  to produce cardioprotective effects.'
