  Genes.Infection by a biotrophic pathogen results in the accumulation of  and monomerization
  of NPR1 through -mediated redox changes in the cell. Monomeric NPR1 is then translocated
  into the nucleus where it interacts with TGA transcription factors, ultimately leading
  to the activation of -responsive genes. Expression of a large set of WRKY genes
  is induced by , some of which can regulate -responsive gene expression. Wounding,
  such as that caused by insect feeding or infection by a necrotrophic pathogen, results
  in the accumulation of . Binding of  to the SCFCOI1-E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex
  leads to degradation of JAZ transcriptional repressor proteins via the proteasome,
  which results in the release of transcriptional activators, such as MYC2, 3, and
  4, and EIN3 and EIL1. Subsequently, AP2/ERF transcription factors, such as ORA59
  and ERF1, are induced that activate the ERF branch of the  pathway. Binding of ERFs
  to the GCC-box induces -responsive gene expression, which can be suppressed by  in
  an SCFCOI1-JAZ–independent manner. The GCC-box is sufficient for -mediated suppression
  of -induced gene expression.  can negatively affect ORA59 protein accumulation,
  which provides an explanation for the antagonistic effect of - on -responsive gene
  expression in wild-type plants. Since mutations in certain TGAs and WRKYs impair
  / crosstalk, TGAs and WRKYs may play a direct or indirect regulatory role in this
  process. Solid arrows and inhibition lines indicate established activities or accumulation
  of compounds; dashed arrows represent hypothesized connections. Red lines indicate
  activities mediated by the  pathway; green lines indicate activities mediated by
  the  pathway.
