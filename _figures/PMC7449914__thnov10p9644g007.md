caption: 'Proposed mechanism: HDAC3 regulates the transcription of cGAS by deacetylating
  p65 at K122, which plays a role in ischemic/reperfusion-induced neuroinflammation
  and brain injury. Briefly, mtDNA released from dead cells in the ischemic core is
  engulfed by microglia in the penumbra. Toxic mtDNA then activates the microglial
  cGAS-STING-IRF3 pathway and potentiates neuroinflammation, which in turn aggravates
  ischemia-induced neuronal cell death. Within microglia, HDAC deacetylates p65, which
  promotes its nuclear translocation and induces cGAS expression and cGAS-STING pathway
  activation. Abbreviations: cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; HDAC, histone deacetylase;
  IRF3, interferon regulatory factor 3; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; STING, simulator
  of interferon genes.'
