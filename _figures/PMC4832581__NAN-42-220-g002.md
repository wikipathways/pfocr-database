caption: Cellular iron homeostasis and putative involvement of NBIA‐associated genes.
  Iron is taken up via transferrin‐mediated endocytosis and a theorized cytoplasmic
  pool of free iron is termed the LIP. Free iron is safely stored within Ferritin
  macromolecules, via Ferritin heavy chain and FTH. Cellular iron export is facilitated
  via the ferroxidase activity of Ceruloplasmin. High iron concentration is required
  in mitochondria; however, no mitochondrial iron exporter has been found. Mitophagy
  is one potential mechanism for iron recycling, and several NBIA‐related genes may
  alter the rate of mitophagy, PANK2, COASY, C19orf12 and PLA2G6. Autophagy and mitophagy
  are intrinsically related, and WDR45 mutations may alter the rate of these recycling
  processes. FA2H and PLA2G6 may impinge on autophagy via membrane remodelling and
  vesicle formation. ATP13A2 has a role in divalent ion transport into the lysosome
  compartment, and this could include/affect iron transport into the iron‐rich lysosomal
  compartment. DCAF17 has not been linked to iron homeostasis. Mitochondrial‐rich
  vesicles have been described to be exocytosed and, together with theorized lysosomal‐derived
  exosomes, may represent another cellular iron secretory mechanism. Grey arrows represent
  theorized steps in the pathway. Black circles represent iron.
