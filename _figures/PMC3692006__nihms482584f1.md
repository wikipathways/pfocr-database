caption: Jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated response pathway involves the degradation of
  two master transcriptional repressors, JAZ and JAV1. Necrotrophic pathogens, herbivorous
  insects and wounding induce the synthesis of JA, which binds to the F-box E3 ligase
  COI1 to promote interaction with and ubiquitination of JAZ and other JAZ family
  members. The ubiquitination causes the JAZs to be degraded by the 26S proteasome,
  thus releasing target transcription factors to activate defense and developmental
  responses. Part of the defense response is hypothesized to include the induction
  of an as yet unidentified ubiquitin E3 ligase that may interact with JAV1 to cause
  JAV1 to be ubiquitinated and degraded, thus de-repressing defense-specific transcription
  factors such as the WRKYs.
