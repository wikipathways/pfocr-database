caption: Schematic diagram of the role of liraglutide in regulating hCMSC paracrine
  and SPC expression. Liraglutide bound to GLP-1R with a consequent of cAMP production.
  Then, the PKAc activation induces β-catenin Ser675 phosphorylation, which results
  in β-catenin nuclear translocation and subsequent promotion of TCF-4 bounding to
  downstream DNA promoter SPC, Ang-1, and FGF-10 genes in hCMSCs. Finally, hCMSCs
  SPC, Ang-1, and FGF-10 expressions are enhanced and subsequently attenuate lung
  repair in the ALI model
