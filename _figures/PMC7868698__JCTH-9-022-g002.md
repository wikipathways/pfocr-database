caption: (A) Preservation of growth modules between different datasets. Each module
  is represented by the color-code and label. The left panel shows the composite statistic
  of preservation median rank. High median ranks indicated low preservation. The right
  panel shows preservation of the Zsummary statistic. (B) Enrichment of KEGG pathways
  in the green module. (C) The cell cycle pathway (hsa04110). The upper panel indicates
  the comparison between slow tumors and the adjacent cirrhotic tissues. The lower
  panel compares the fastest tumors with the slow tumors. Genes in red represent genes
  that were up-regulated, and blue represents genes that were down-regulated. The
  right panel highlights five effector circuits for the function output.
