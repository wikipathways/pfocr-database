caption: Schematic representation of the molecular mechanism of BaP exposure-induced
  CVDs. Numerous pieces of evidence show that the caveolin-1 can facilitate entry
  of the BaP into vessel-wall cells. The AhR complex is translocated into nuclear
  after binding with intracellular BaP. And then the BaP-AhR complex could activate
  the AhR/ARNT/XRE, MEK/c-Jun, and MAPK/NF-kB/AP-1 signaling pathway which can up-regulate
  the gene of CYPs, cell adhesion molecules, pro-inflammatory factors, and peroxidase.
  Besides, the activated CYP1A1 actually increased the metabolism of BaP into BPDE,
  which can form DNA adducts and induce mutation. As a result, BaP exposure increases
  the ECs dysfunction and VSMC phenotypic switch which accelerates the pathological
  progress of CVDs.
