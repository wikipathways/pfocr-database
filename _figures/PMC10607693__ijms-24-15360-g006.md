caption: Fatty acid β-oxidation pathway reconstruction. The map shows proteins (uppercase)
  and metabolites (lowercase) involved in the metabolic pathway at flower stages (A)
  and at fruit stages (B). Relative abundance of proteins was averaged over three
  biological replicates (n = 3). LACS, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase; ACX, acyl-CoA
  oxidase; ECH, enoyl-CoA hydratase; HADH, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase; KAT, ketoacyl-CoA
  thiolase.
