  COGRIM modeling was performed by integrating four data sources, including microarray
  analysis of genes differentially expressed by cancer cells, the promoter sequences
  extracted from genomic databases, NF-κB binding activity in cancer cells, and the
  NF-κB PWMs from Transfac. The predicted NF-κB target genes were subjected to Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis, and NF-κB-associated networks and signaling pathways were identified.
  The predicted NF-κB target genes were validated by real time RT-PCR, gene knocking
  down by siRNA, and NF-κB specific binding assays.
papertitle: Systems biology-defined NF-κB regulons, interacting signal pathways and
  networks are implicated in the malignant phenotype of head and neck cancer cell
  lines differing in p53 status.
