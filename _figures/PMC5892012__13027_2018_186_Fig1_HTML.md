caption: 'TERT levels affect EBV latent/lytic status. A, cross-talk between EBV and
  TERT to sustain viral latency program: in EBV-infected primary B lymphocytes, activation
  of TERT occurs concomitantly with induction of latent EBV proteins and down-regulation
  of EBV lytic gene expression. EBV-encoded LMP-1 activates TERT at transcriptional
  level via NF-κB and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways. In turn, TERT expression activates NOTCH2
  at transcriptional level via NF-κB pathway. NOTCH2 activates BATF, which negatively
  affects the expression of BZLF1, a master regulator of viral lytic cycle, thus favouring
  induction and maintenance of EBV latency program, essential for EBV-driven transformation.
  Immunohistochemical image: TERT (a, b) and BZLF1 (c, d) protein expression in early-
  (a, c) and late- (b, d) infected B lymphocytes (X40). B, TERT or NOTCH inhibition
  triggers EBV lytic cycle: TERT silencing by shRNA (shTERT) or inhibition of NOTCH
  signaling by γ-secretase inhibitors lead to NOTCH2-dependent down-regulation of
  BATF and up-regulation of BZLF1, inducing a complete EBV lytic cycle. Immunohistochemical
  image: EBV lytic gp350 protein expression in EBV-positive BL cells untreated (a)
  and treated (b) for 72 h with shTERT (X20). Scale bar, 100 μm. See the text for
