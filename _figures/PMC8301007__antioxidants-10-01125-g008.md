caption: 'Proposed mechanism for the regulation of mtROS homeostasis by quercetin
  through the Sirt1 signaling pathway in NaIO3-induced retinal damage. Quercetin triggers
  the Nrf2-PGC-1α-Sirt-1 signaling pathway, which is required for Nrf2-PGC-1α-dependent
  Sirt1 transcription and subsequent enrichment within the mitochondria, thereby leading
  to deacetylation and activation of mitochondrial enzymes (SOD2) involved in mtROS
  regulation as well as stimulating mitochondrial H2O2synthesis, finally contributing
  to mtROS homeostasis in the retina, and then alleviating NaIO3-induced autophagic
  cell death, including the upregulation of LC3B, Beclin-1, and p62, as well as downregulation
  of Bcl-2. Quercetin treatment decreased the levels of related factors, which controlled
  the quality of mitochondria. Ac: acetyl.'
