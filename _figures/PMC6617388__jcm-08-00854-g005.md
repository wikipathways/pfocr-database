caption: 'Adipose tissue-derived exosomal microRNAs. Recipient organs and target mRNAs
  of exosomal microRNAs. Brown fat-derived miR-99b suppresses Fgf-21 expression in
  the liver, which regulates the systemic homeostasis. The circulating mIR-130b is
  correlated with BMI. In a mouse obesity model, adipose tissue-derived miR-130b downregulated
  Pgc-1α expression in the muscle cell. The expression and secretion of miR-200a are
  increased by rosiglitazone treatment. Exosomal miR-200a derived from adipocytes
  stimulates mTOR signaling by decreasing TSC1 expression, which leads to cardiomyocyte
  hypertrophy. Exosomal miR-450a functions in an autocrine manner to increase adipogenesis
  through the downregulation of WISP2. Abbreviations: FGF21, fibroblast growth factor
  21; BMI, body mass index; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma
  coactivator-1 alpha; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; TSC1, tuberous sclerosis
  1; WISP2, WNT1-inducible-signaling pathway protein 2.'
