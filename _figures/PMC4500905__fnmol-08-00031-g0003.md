caption: Cell-cell signaling in brain iron uptake. Illustrated is the signaling pathway
  from blood to BMVEC (A) and then through the abluminal space (B) to astrocytes neighboring
  BMVEC (C). Circulating inflammatory signals stimulate interleukin expression and
  secretion from BMVEC. These cytokines stimulate astrocyte expression and secretion
  of sCp into the interstitium (D). This sCp supports an increase of iron efflux from
  the adjacent BMVEC (McCarthy and Kosman, ).
