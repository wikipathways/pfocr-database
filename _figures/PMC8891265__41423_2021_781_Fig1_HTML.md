caption: Overview of lipid metabolism. Lipid metabolism consists of two distinct arms,
  namely, fatty acid oxidation (β-oxidation) and lipid synthesis. The peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor (PPAR) family of transcription factors regulates the expression of genes
  involved in β-oxidation, as depicted in blue. However, the sterol regulatory element
  binding protein (SREBP) family of transcription factors controls the expression
  of enzymes and transport proteins required for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis,
  as shown in red. Briefly, cytosolic fatty acids (FAs) are activated by fatty acyl-CoA
  synthetase (FACS), which introduces a CoA adduct, yielding fatty acyl-CoA. Long-chain
  fatty acyls enter the mitochondria for oxidation via the carnitine shuttle system.
  Carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1 (Cpt1), located on the outer mitochondrial membrane,
  exchanges the CoA adduct for a carnitine molecule, forming acylcarnitine. Acylcarnitines
  are transported into the mitochondrial matrix through carnitine acyl-carnitine translocase
  (CACT), where they are reconverted back to fatty acyl-CoA by the action of Cpt2.
  Once inside the matrix, fatty acyl-CoA undergoes a series of dehydration, hydration
  and thiolysis reactions (β-oxidation), which generate NADH and FADH2 reducing equivalents
  and acetyl-CoA. NADH and FADH2 donate electrons to complexes 1 and 2 of the electron
  transport chain and acetyl-CoA enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In the
  TCA cycle, acetyl-CoA is converted into citrate, which may be exported to the cytosol
  through Slc25a1. The enzyme ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) catalyses the conversion of
  cytosolic citrate to acetyl-CoA, which is an important step in endogenous lipid
  synthesis. Cytosolic acetyl-CoA is converted to malonyl-CoA through the action of
  acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which together form the major substrates for fatty
  acid synthesis by the multienzyme complex fatty acid synthase (FASN). FASN catalyzes
  the synthesis of palmitic acid, a 16 carbon saturated fatty acid, which may be converted
  into palmitoleic acid, a 16-carbon unsaturated fatty acid through the action of
  stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). In addition, cytosolic acetyl-CoA may enter the mevalonate
  pathway, resulting in the production of cholesterol and other steroids. Together,
  fatty acids and cholesterol play an important role in membrane synthesis and signaling
  and can also be stored in lipid droplets to be later used as a fuel source
