caption: Proposed model of the mechanism by which cilostazol increases cAMP accumulation
  and ATP release from type 2 diabetes erythrocytes. Exposure of healthy human erythrocytes
  to reduced extracellular oxygen (O2) tension results in release of O2 from hemoglobin
  (desaturation) and activation of a signaling pathway for ATP release. This pathway
  requires an increase in cAMP that is regulated by PDE3 activity. The conduit for
  ATP release is pannexin 1 (). In erythrocytes of humans with type 2 diabetes, expression
  of Gi and ATP release in response to exposure to reduced O2 are decreased. Cilostazol,
  by inhibiting the degradation of cAMP in this pathway, enhances low O2-induced ATP
  release. AC, adenylyl cyclase; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator;
  (+)activation; (−)inhibition.
