caption: Disease-specific mutations in B-cell lymphoid neoplasms. V-raf murine sarcoma
  viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that mediates
  the MAPK pathway. B-cell receptor signaling triggers activation of BRAF. Activated
  BRAF phosphorylates MEKs, which, in turn, leads to activation of ERKs. The V600E
  BRAF mutant in hairy cell leukemia possesses constitutive kinase activity, resulting
  in overactivation of downstream targets. Myeloid differentiation primary-response
  gene 88 (MYD88) is an adaptor protein that plays an essential role in signaling
  by the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R). On cell stimulation,
  MYD88 is directly recruited to the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain in TLRs/IL-1R, binds
  to Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and acts to recruit IL-1R-associated protein kinases.
  This leads to activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling. The L265P MYD88
  mutant in Waldenström macroglobulinemia contributes to constitutive activation of
  the NF-κB signaling by preferential binding to BTK. Inhibitor of DNA binding (ID3)
  is a member of the Id helix–loop–helix proteins, which lack a DNA-binding region
  and function as dominant negative antagonists of basic helix–loop–helix transcription
  factors, including transcription factor 3 (TCF3). TCF3 plays a role in germinal
  center B-cell development and promotes cell growth by activating the B-cell receptor
  signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, and positive
  cell cycle regulator cyclin D3 (CCND3). Gain-of-function mutations in TCF3 and loss-of-function
  mutations in ID3, the negative regulator of TCF3, in Burkitt lymphoma enhance the
  TCF3 pathway. NOTCH2 is a single transmembrane receptor. Following NOTCH ligand
  binding, NOTCH receptor is cleaved in the transmembrane region, resulting in the
  release of the intracellular domain (ICD) from the plasma membrane. Then ICD is
  translocated to the nucleus, and activates the transcription of target genes. This
  signal is terminated by phosphorylation (P) of the proline, glutamate, serine, and
  threonine (PEST) domain of the ICD, followed by proteasomal degradation. NOTCH2
  mutants in splenic marginal zone lymphoma lack the degradation signals in the PEST
  domain and act in a gain-of-function manner. AKT, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene
