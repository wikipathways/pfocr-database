caption: TGF-β pathway signaling in MFS. FBN1 has a role in regulating TGF-β. (A)
  FBN1 binds to a large latent complex composed of LAP, LTBP and TGF-β and regulates
  the concentration of activated TGF-β in the matrix. Upon activation of the complex,
  TGF-β binds TGF-β receptors and signals. This signal can be transmitted from the
  cell membrane to the nucleus via Smad-dependent or Smad-independent pathways. (B)
  Mutations in FBN1 cause the release of large amounts of active TGF-β1 from the extracellular
  matrix, leading to over-activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway and accelerating
  the destruction of the extracellular matrix
