caption: Fatty acid uptake and oxidation. Free fatty acids in circulation enter the
  cardiomyocytes through either passive diffusion or a carrier protein-facilitated
  pathway, which involves fatty acid binding protein (FABP), fatty acid translocase
  (CD36/FAT), or fatty acid transporter protein (FATP). Cytosolic fatty acids are
  esterified to become fatty acyl CoA by fatty acyl CoA synthase (FACS). The acyl
  group of fatty acyl-CoA is transferred to carnitine to form acylcarnitine by carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). The acylcarnitine enters the mitochondrial inner
  matrix via the carnitine shuttle and is converted to fatty acyl CoA by CPT2. The
  fatty acyl CoA goes through several cycles of β-oxidation producing NADH, FADH2,
  and acetyl CoA, which enters the TCA cycle for ATP production. CAT, carnitine translocase.
