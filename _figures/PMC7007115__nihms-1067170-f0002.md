caption: Mechanism of Dietary Restriction. During DR there is a reduced energy status
  within the organism, resulting in corresponding decreases in blood glucose, insulin,
  IGF-1, growth hormones, sex hormones, and T3 thyroid hormones. Also, DR induces
  a reduction in both oxidative stress and inflammation. Following DR, there are increases
  in free fatty acids, adiponectin, and cortisol. A lower cellular energy status will
  lead to reduced mitochondrial activity and aerobic respiration, increasing the AMP:ATP
  ratio and NAD+ levels. Two major cellular nutrients and energy sensors, AMPK and
  SIRT1, will be then be activated, respectively. Activated AMPK will inhibit glycogen
  synthesis, ACC1, ACC2, and HMG-CoA to drive a reduction in fatty acid synthesis,
  oxidation, and cholesterol synthesis. Activated SIRT1 can enhance ketogenesis and
  lipolysis, and downregulate glycolysis and glutaminolysis. These effects may be
  also due to an activation of PPARα, reflecting direct and indirect functions of
  SIRT1. Activated SIRT1 can also repress the activity of PPARγ to modulate lipid
  metabolism and enhance fat mobilization in white adipose tissue during DR. Activated
  SIRT1 can inhibit NF-κB activity, inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory genes.
  SIRT1 activation is dependent on the increased interaction between FOXO3a and p53
  at SIRT1 promoter sites. The physical interaction between FOXO3a and p53, and the
  subsequent activation of SIRT1, play important roles in repressing cell growth and
  proliferation. Notably, SIRT1 activation can activate LKB1, which will further activate
  AMPK, thus creating a positive feedback loop. Reduced levels of insulin, glucose
  and growth hormone downregulates insulin and IGF-R signaling pathways, inactivating
  the RAS/MAPK axis, repressing cell growth and proliferation and promoting apoptosis.
  Repression of IGF-R signaling will include the PI3K pathway, and inhibit downstream
  mTORC1, promoting autophagy. Inhibition of mTORC1 can also occur via activated AMPK
  in response to DR. Decreased mTORC1 function can promote ketogenesis and lipolysis,
  and repress glycolysis and glutaminolysis. Moreover, the corresponding decreased
  function of mTORC1 also inhibit HIF-1α, which downregulates key biological processes
  such as glucose metabolism, angiogenesis, and cell cycle progression. The NRF2 pathway
  is also triggered by DR, which helps to increase production of protective antioxidant
  enzymes and mitochondrial biogenesis to reduce ROS activity. With lower levels of
  ROS, there will be reduced DNA damage and a maintained genome stability. Lower energy
  status will prime cells to low-intensity stress, and this hormetic mechanism will
  stimulate better management of stress, upregulate DNA repair genes, as well as shifting
  towards a preferred setting of maintenance and repair (not shown). Overall, DR can
  act via these mechanisms to counter age-associated diseases and induce longevity.DR,
