caption: A brief overview of the TLR2 signaling pathway in mammals [,]. TLR2 or its
  heterodimers are located on the cell membranes. The TLR2 signaling activation through
  TLR2/1 requires the participant of accessory molecule CD14, while TLR2/6 requires
  CD36. The TLR2 signaling pathway is activated after TLR2 ligand recognition (PAMPs
  or DAMPs). Subsequently, the adaptor proteins, MYD88 and TIRAP/MAL, are recruited.
  After a series of cascades involving NF-κB and MAPKs, various transcription factors
  are activated to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines. Of note, the shown TLR2 signaling
  components are not exclusive for this TLR receptor, and the phosphorylation and
  ubiquitination processes are not mentioned in this Figure. The expansion of gene
  symbols and more gene information can be found in the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee
  website (HGNC, www.genenames.org) or the Mouse Genome Database (MGD, www.informatics.jax.org).
