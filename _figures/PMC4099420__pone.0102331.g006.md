caption: The pathway depicted includes the 27 genes of the of the 'antimicrobial response'
  pathway that showed increased activation following IFN-β exposure of LCLs (activation
  score Z = 2.779) by Ingenuity analysis. In addition, genes outlined in blue were
  manually added to the pathway based on their known participation in the innate response
  in B cells or other leukocytes, and include TLR7 and TLR9  , TRIM21 and TRIM5 –.
  Only direct connections are featured, and subcellular location of gene products
  is as suggested by Ingenuity knowledge base. In green- down-regulated genes; in
  red- up-regulated genes, color intensity is proportional to the fold change in expression
  levels following IFN-β exposure.
