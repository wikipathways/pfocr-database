caption: Upstream regulators predicted to be activated in breast muscle (based on
  expression of downstream molecules) of high FE pedigree broilers shown in orange
  included progesterone, triiodothyronine (T3), insulin receptor (INSR), insulin-like
  growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha
  (PPARA), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha gamma coactivator 1-alpha
  (PGC1α) and nuclear factor, erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2). Upstream regulators predicted
  to be inhibited in breast muscle of the high FE phenotype shown in blue include
  rapamycin-insensitive companion of target of rapamycin (RICTOR), serum response
  factor (SRF), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MAP4K4). Orange and blue arrows
  indicate activation or inhibition, respectively of downstream targets. Orange lines
  with a bar and the end indicate the downstream target molecule would be inhibited
  or down-regulated in the high FE phenotype. Blue lines with a bar at the end indicate
  that inhibition of downstream targets would be down-regulated or diminished in the
  high FE phenotype. Light green arrows indicate that the expression of a downstream
  molecule is inconsistent with literature based results in the Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis program. Proteins up-regulated in the high FE phenotype are shown in red
  whereas down-regulated proteins are shown in green with the complete name and fold
  difference in expression shown in .
