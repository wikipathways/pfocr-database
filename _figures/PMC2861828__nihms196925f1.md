caption: 'Schematic diagram of the signaling pathway that connects store-operated
  Ca2+ entry with NFAT-dependent gene transcription in T cells. (a) Resting T cells
  have a membrane potential (maintained primarily by Kv1.3 K+ channels) of approximately
  −50 mV and intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) of 50–100 nM that are
  maintained by the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA), the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum
  Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) that pumps Ca2+ into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), and electrogenic Na+-Ca2+ exchangers (NCX, not shown). Immunoreceptors include
  antigen receptors on T and B cells (TCR, BCR), Fcε receptors on mast cells, or Fcγ
  receptors on NK cells. The concentration of free Ca2+ in the ER ([Ca2+]ER) is several
  hundred μM; hence the EF-hand of STIM1 is saturated with Ca2+, and STIM1 does not
  form higher-order oligomers (dimers are depicted, but the oligomerization state
  of STIM1 in resting cells is not fully defined). The transcription factor NFAT is
  heavily phosphorylated and localized to the cytoplasm. (b) Activated T cells. T
  cell receptors assemble into signaling complexes that contain scaffold proteins
  such as LAT and SLP-76, tyrosine kinases such as Lck, ZAP70, and Itk, and phospholipase
  C (PLC)γ (not all of which are shown). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) produced
  by PLCγbinds to IP3 receptors in the ER membrane, causing the release of Ca2+ from
  the ER. As a result of the depletion of ER Ca2+ stores, Ca2+ dissociates from EF-hand
  1 of STIM1 and causes a conformational change (unfolding of the EF-SAM domain in
  the ER lumen) that leads to oligomerization (tetramers are depicted, but the oligomerization
  state of STIM1 in activated cells is not fully defined). The STIM oligomers move
  to sites of ER–plasma membrane apposition, recruit ORAI proteins to these sites,
  and cause CRAC channels to open. The resulting increase in [Ca2+]i causes the universal
  and abundant cytoplasmic Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM) to bind to many channels and
  enzymes and modulate their activity. Among the targets of CaM are the phosphatase
  calcineurin, which dephosphorylates NFAT and causes its nuclear translocation, thus
  activating NFAT-dependent transcription; the PMCA pump whose activity is increased
  by CaM binding; and the KCa3.1 K+ channel that maintains membrane potential and
  the driving force for Ca2+ entry. Activated cells also show relocalization of mitochondria
  toward the plasma membrane, a process expected to maintain CRAC channel activity
  by diminishing Ca2+-dependent inactivation. MCU: mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter. CK1,
