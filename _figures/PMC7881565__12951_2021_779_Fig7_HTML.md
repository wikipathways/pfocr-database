caption: 'Functionally grouped network of enriched biological pathways: The proteins
  networks were generated with high confidence interaction (overall 0.90 scores) in
  Cytoscape platform together in combination with Reactome database. Using the kappa
  score based statistics model, it provides the degree of relationship among the pathways
  associated with significant relevant overlapping proteins and Gene Ontology (GO)
  terms. The threshold 0.4 Kappa statistics was set, and above that, all the terms
  connections were selected to illustrate the significant interactome. The analysis
  uses the following parameters minimum three and maximum eight-level for GO tree,
  minimum 3% of genes of GO term/pathway, Benjamini and Hochberg test with the two-sided
  hypergeometric distribution of corrected FDR level < 0.05 significance. The protein–protein
  interaction maps represents the Akt/mTOR pathway, Map/Erk pathway, DNA damage responsive
  pathway and Ca2+signaling cascade and endolysosomal machinery that include ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation'
