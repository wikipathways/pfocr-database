caption: Pathways linking mitochondrial dysfunction to the activation of multidrug
  resistance genes. In dysfunctional mitochondria, changes in the membrane association
  characteristics of the mitochondrial inner membrane protein Psd1 create a signal
  for activation of the transcription factors ScPdr3 and CgPdr1 (indicated by Pdr
  in the figure). This results in upregulation of genes encoding efflux pumps (which
  mediate drug resistance and have additional roles in phospholipid homeostasis),
  as well as genes required for sphingolipid metabolism. Dysfunctional mitochondria
  have an effect on membrane lipid homeostasis (depicted by the red “T”). This could
  be compensated by activation of phospholipid and sphingolipid homeostasis genes
  via the Pdr pathway (green arrow). Additionally, sphingolipid biosynthesis intermediates
  can feed into the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine by nonmitochondrial pathways,
  thereby compensating for aberrant lipid composition of mitochondrial membranes in
  cells with dysfunctional mitochondria.
