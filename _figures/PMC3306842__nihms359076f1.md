caption: 'APP processing and Aβ accumulation. Mature APP (center and inside the dashed
  box) is metabolized by 2 competing pathways: the α-secretase pathway, which generates
  sAPPα and C83 (also known as C-terminal fragment α; left), and the β-secretase pathway,
  which generates sAPPβ and C99 (right). Some β-secretase cleavage is displaced by
  10–amino acid residues and generates sAPPβ′ and C89. All carboxy-terminal fragments
  (C83, C99, and C89) are substrates for γ-secretase, which generates AICD, and the
  secreted peptides p3 (not shown), Aβ (right), and Glu11 Aβ. Aβ aggregates into small
  multimers (dimers, trimers, etc.) known as oligomers. Oligomers appear to be the
  most potent neurotoxins, whereas the end-stage senile plaque is relatively inert.
  Abbreviations: Aβ, amyloid-β peptide; AICD, amyloid precursor protein intracellular
  domain; APP, amyloid precursor protein; sAPP, soluble amyloid precursor protein.
