caption: (1) FTIs, particularly tipifarnib, is currently under FDA fast track designation
  for HRAS-mutant HNSCC treatment; (2) HNSCC with KRAS germline variants are druggable
  with cetuximab addition; (3) MAPK1 mutations are targetable by EGFR inhibitors;
  (4) BRAF p.V600E-mutated ameloblastoma are exceptionally sensitive to and could
  be subject to BRAF monotherapy or BRAF/MEK combination therapy; (5) Treatment de-intensification
  or potentially “not-to-use” of ErbB3 inhibitors may need to be considered in MAPK-mutatedp-ErbB3
  downregulated HNSCC. (6) CD8+ T cell infiltration in MAPK-mutant HNSCC may constitute
  better clinical outcome to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment.
