caption: Activation of various receptor tyrosine kinases (VEGFR, C-KIT, C-MET, FGFR,
  IGF1R, and others) by their cognate ligands (VEGF, SCF, HGF, FGF, and IGF1/2, respectively)
  leads to proliferation and survival of melanoma cells through two interacting signal
  transduction pathways. Ligand availability through autocrine loops (eg, VEGF), paracrine
  secretion (eg, IGF1), as well as IGFBPs can modulate activation of these pathways.
  Within the MAPK pathway, activated receptors lead to SHC-mediated activation of
  RAS and propagation of signaling through RAF, MEK (also known as MAP2K), and MAPK
  (also known as ERK). Activated MAPK transduces signals that regulate multiple cell
  processes including proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and survival.
  Isolated activation of the MAPK pathway by oncogenic stimuli, such as mutated BRAF,
  results in expression and secretion of IGFBP7, which, in turn, suppresses MAPK activity
  and induces senescence, as seen in benign nevi. Melanomas seem to circumvent this
  negative feedback loop by blocking the expression of IGFBP7 through yet unidentified
  mechanisms. The second essential signaling pathway stimulated by receptor tyrosine
  kinases is the PI3K/AKT pathway. PI3K, a lipid kinase, catalyzes the phosphorylation
  of phosphatidylinositol (PI). Triple phosphorylation of PI is necessary for the
  association of AKT with the cell membrane and its subsequent activation by PDK1.
  The key regulatory component is PTEN, a phosphatase that regulates PI3K and SHC
  phosphorylation. RAS may also regulate PI3K activity. Through activated AKT, a number
  of key mitogenic processes are activated including inhibition of apoptosis, survival
  gene transcription, cell cycle progression, protein translation, and cell growth
  and proliferation. The balance between AKT activation and PTEN regulatory activity
  is a key determinant in cell cycle progression. FGF = fibroblast growth factor;
  HGF = hepatocyte growth factor; IGF = insulinlike growth factor; P = phosphate;
  VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor; ? = mechanism unknown. For expansion
  of other abbreviations, see Glossary on page 846.
