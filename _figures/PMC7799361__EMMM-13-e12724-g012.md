caption: Gut surgical manipulation and trauma cause inflammation and increase ATP
  release that activates P2X2 receptors on enteric glia and induces a reactive glial
  phenotype termed “enteric gliosis”. In the context of inflammation, ATP activates
  a P2X2/p38 MAPK pathogenic signaling pathway associated with an increased expression
  in gliosis markers GFAP, NESTIN, and the release of cytokines like IL‐6 and CXCL2.
  Enteric gliosis exacerbates neuroinflammation, contributes to immune cell infiltration
  and that causes postoperative motility disturbances and POI. P2X2 antagonism by
  ambroxol prevents the ATP‐triggered enteric gliosis and protects against POI.
