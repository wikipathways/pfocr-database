caption: Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) modify several enzymes in the glycolytic
  pathway. This diagram shows the metabolism of carbohydrates in glycolysis and summarizes
  existing knowledge on RNS-driven modifications in glycolytic proteins. Relevant
  enzymes are highlighted. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is the
  most sensitive protein. Modifications that have been linked to the inhibition of
  enzymatic activities are indicated by number within a circle. When reported chemical
  alterations have not been linked to changes in enzymatic activities, they are represented
  by an underlined number. See text for details and references. (To see this illustration
