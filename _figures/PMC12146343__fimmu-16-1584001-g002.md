caption: Signals from the gut microbiota lead to the differentiation of T cells into
  various subtypes. Many of these signals are mediated through epithelial cells or
  DCs. The gut microbiota promotes Treg generation through the presentation of antigens
  by goblet cells and CD103+ DCs, along with the secretion of high levels of TGF-β
  and IL-2. CD11c+ DCs detect gut microbiota and secrete TGF-β and IL-6, which drive
  Th17 polarization, leading to the secretion of TNF-α and IL-22. The gut microbiota
  also initiates TFR cell differentiation through mTOR-mediated activation of the
  TCF-1-Bcl-6 axis. Furthermore, the microbiota regulates the expression of microRNAs,
  which in turn regulates TFR cell differentiation and function. In AIH, elevated
  levels of LPS inhibit TFR cells and activate TFH cells via the TLR4/MyD88 signaling
  pathway, promoting the production of high-affinity antibodies by secreting IL-4
  and IL-21. Gut microbiota is phagocytosed by DCs or stimulates them to release pro-inflammatory
  cytokines like IL-6 and TNF, leading to Th1 polarization. DCs produce IL-4 and TGF-β
  to facilitate Th2 cell differentiation. Th2 cells release cytokines such as IL-4,
  IL-5, and IL-13, which are associated with AIH. DC, dendritic cell; Treg, regulatory
