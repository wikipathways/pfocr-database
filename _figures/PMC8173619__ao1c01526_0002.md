caption: 'Flow chart of drug repurposing by omics data mining: We retrieved information
  on AD risk genes from GWAS, transcriptomics, and metabolomics approaches. We found
  2914 AD risk genes from which 58 genes were extracted from GWAS, 229 genes were
  extracted from GEO transcriptomics data, and 2627 genes were related to 128 metabolites
  from the HMDB database. After functional enrichment analysis, we filtered out 49
  AD-associated targets. The PPI network analysis resulted in 641 PPI interactions.
  We performed drug target mapping to find candidate drugs from DrugBank and TTD databases.
  Out of 641, 25 PPI interactions were found to be associated with 36 approved anticancer
  drugs. We excluded the information related to investigational and experimental drugs.
  We analyzed gene–gene and gene–drug interactions and selected the top 10 PPI interactions
  that correspond to 30 anticancer compounds. These 30 drugs were then analyzed by
  the CoDReS web tool that proposes 10 candidate drugs for AD. These drugs were then
  compared with the available Alzheimer’s therapeutics for structural and functional
  similarities, where six drugs have shown to be hierarchically clustered. ADMET analysis,
  pathway analysis, and functional similarity with miRNAs resulted in potential repurposing
  anticancer drugs against AD.'
