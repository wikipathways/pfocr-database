caption: Schematic outline of the main extracellular and intracellular pathways catalyzing
  the breakdown of ATP/NAD to adenosine. During normoxic conditions, most cells within
  a tissue release ATP and NAD into the interstitial space, particularly when stimulated.
  This involves various transmembrane transporters. Adenosine formed by CD73 can be
  removed by cellular reuptake (equilibrative and concentrative nucleoside transporter
  proteins ENTs and CNTs, respectively) and deamination to inosine (ADA = ecto-adenosine
  deaminase bound to CD26) and further to hypoxanthin. Note, that aside of CD39, ATP
  can be directly degraded to AMP by action of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase
  I (ENPP1). CD38 is transmembrane glycoprotein that hydrolyzes extracellular NAD
  to adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR) which is further converted to AMP by ENPP1
  (alternative adenosine forming pathway). During tissue hypoxia, intracellular adenosine
  becomes strongly elevated by the concerted action of elevated substrate AMP levels
  and inhibition of adenosine kinase (AK) which interferes with the “futile” metabolic
  cycle between AMP and adenosine involving cytosolic 5′-ncleotidase (5′-NT). Adenosine
  can also be formed by the cellular transmethylation pathway [S-adenosyl-methionine
  (SAM) → S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) involving SAH-hydrolase (SAHH)]; however,
  the input of this pathway to adenosine formation is generally only small. Cellular
  crosstalk refers to the fact that within an intact tissue, the extracellular concentration
  of various purine compounds is finally determined by the release of ATP and ectoenzyme
  activities of all cell types, which form the interstitial fluid space in a living
  tissue
