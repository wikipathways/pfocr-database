caption: Mechanism of multidrug resistance and its reversal on treatment with NP-drug
  conjugates. MDR may occur as a result of reduced binding affinity of receptor with
  the drug. Hyper-activation of efflux transporters also leads to MDR causing rapid
  efflux of drug which results in reduced drug uptake and hence less intracellular
  drug accumulation takes place. MDR may also be caused due to defective apoptotic
  machinery or due to hypoxia which is responsible for overexpression of Hif-1 gene
  and Hsp90 gene. Other than this, the expression of tumor suppressor gene (p53) and
  pro-apoptotic genes (Bax, Bak and Bid) is reduced while the expression of anti-apoptotic
  genes (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-W) is increased. For MDR reversal, drug-loaded NPs are
  used that have higher binding affinity with receptors on a cancer cell which facilitates
  rapid uptake of drugs and its increased intracellular accumulation. The drug is
  afterwards released in the tumor cell due to low pH at the perinuclear surface which
  prevents the normal cells from system cytotoxicity, thereby resisting MDR. NP-loaded
  drug targets the genetic machinery and results in inhibition of Hsp90 gene, which
  further causes suppression of Hif-1 gene. Furthermore, the released drug also enhances
  the expression of p53, Bax, Bak, Bid and inhibits the action of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and
  Bcl-W genes, which induce apoptotic machinery. The drug also targets P13K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway and mitochondrial DNA repairing machinery, resulting in mitochondrial DNA
  damage and release of Cyt-c, thereby inducing apoptosis.
