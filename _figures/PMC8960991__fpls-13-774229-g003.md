caption: 'The regulation pathway of Pti1 in defense response and ROS signal in plant.
  (A) In tomato, the pathogen Pst injected the effector protein AvrPto into cell through
  type III secretion system. The Pto protein kinase can specifically recognize and
  interact with AvrPto, being activated through autophosphorylation, and then phosphorylated
  SlPti1a for triggering the programmed cell death in plant ETI response. Besides,
  SlPti1a and SlPti1b regulated ROS production and the downstream MAPK signaling pathway
  during the PTI process. (B) In rice, OsPti1a negatively regulated disease resistance
  by suppressing the expression of OsRAR1 in ETI during the infection of pathogenic
  bacteria. The pathogen infection also caused the independent ROS signal and PA signal
  and activated OsPDK1-OsOXI1-OsPti1a phosphorylation cascade in PTI. (C) In Arabidopsis,
  similar AtPDK1-AtOXI1-AtPti1-2/AtPti1-4 phosphorylation cascades also existed in
  response to PA signal. AtMPK3/AtMPK6 phosphorylated AtPti1-4 and OXI1, forming a
  feedback loop. AtPti1-2 promoted the expression of GST6 and HSP18.2 to scavenge
  ROS under oxidative stress. AvrPto, avirulence Pto; ETI, effector-triggered immunity;
