  cerevisiae. Palmitoyl-CoA is synthesized from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA by soluble
  FAS. Palmitoyl-CoA is elongated to a C26 VLCFA by a membrane-associated fatty acid
  elongating system (A, left branch). Each cycle of elongation requires four successive
  reactions and lengthens the growing fatty acid by two carbon units; condensation
  of malonyl-CoA with the acyl-CoA substrate, reduction of the 3-ketoacyl-CoA, dehydration
  of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, and reduction of the trans-2,3-acyl-CoA. Although the
  intermediates and the product of the elongation cycle are shown as CoA derivatives,
  this has not yet been experimentally confirmed. The organization of the elongating
  enzymes with respect to each other is unknown. The LCBs are synthesized by the pathway
  shown in the right branch of panel A; the pathway for the conversion of ceramide
  to mature sphingolipids is shown in panel B.

    in S. cerevisiae. Palmitoyl-CoA is synthesized from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA
    by soluble FAS. Palmitoyl-CoA is elongated to a C26 VLCFA by a membrane-associated

    condensation of malonyl-CoA with the acyl-CoA substrate, reduction of the 3-ketoacyl-CoA,

    of the elongating enzymes with respect to each other is unknown. The LCBs are
