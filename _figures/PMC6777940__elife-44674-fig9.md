caption: Under basal conditions, NHR-14 represses smf-3, specific DAF-16/FoxO-Class
  II genes and innate immune response genes to promote growth and development. Upon
  exposure to P. aeruginosa, NHR-14 function/activity is reduced, leading to PQM-1
  nuclear localization and transcriptional activation of smf-3 and DAF-16/FoxO-Class
  II through the GATA-like DAE. SMF-3 mediates Fe(II) uptake after the reduction of
  Fe(III) by an unknown membrane associated ferrireductase (yellow oval). Increased
  cellular iron activates ftn-1 transcription through a HIF-1-dependent mechanism
  (; ), leading to the sequestration of iron within FTN-1. We suggest that increased
  iron uptake by SMF-3 and sequestration by FTN-1 may provide a strategy to limit
  P. aeruginosa acquisition of intestinal luminal iron and serves as a component of
  the host innate immune response. How NHR-14 senses pathogen stress and the identity
  of NHR-14 downstream effectors remain to be determined.
