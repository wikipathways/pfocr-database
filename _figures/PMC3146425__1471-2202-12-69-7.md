caption: Model of the transcriptional regulation of bim expression by prosurvival
  signalling pathways in sympathetic neurons. The MEK-ERK pathway negatively regulates
  bim expression at the level of transcription via the 3' UTR by an unknown mechanism.
  PI3-K-Akt signalling inhibits FOXO transcription factors which can bind to two conserved
  FOXO sites in the bim promoter [,]. Both prosurvival pathways are activated following
  the binding of NGF to TrkA and act independently of each other to reduce bim mRNA
  levels.
