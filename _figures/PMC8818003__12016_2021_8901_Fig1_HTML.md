caption: Mechanism of IgE-mediated upper and lower airway disease. In response to
  allergen exposure, dendritic cells present allergen-specific antigens to naïve T
  cells, which are activated and differentiate into Th2 cells. These Th2 cells produce
  key cytokines (IL-4, IL-13), prompting B cells to produce allergen-specific IgE.
  Alternatively, exposure to external stimuli such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and
  particulates promotes epithelial release of IL-25, TSLP, and IL-33. These factors
  stimulate ILC2 cells to produce IL-5, IL-13, and to a lesser extent, IL-4, which
  in turn promote B cell production of IgE. Finally, superantigens, including Staphylococcal
  enterotoxins, can directly cross-link antigen-presenting cells with naïve T cells,
  bypassing the antigen presentation step, yielding polyclonal IgE. Once produced,
  local IgE acts on the FcεRI receptors of tissue-resident mast cells and basophils,
  prompting the release of histamine, leukotrienes, tryptase, and prostaglandin, which
  manifest as edema, vasodilation, and bronchoconstriction as part of the early response.
  IgE also binds to FcεRII receptors on B cells for enhanced antigen presentation.
  Later release of key cytokines recruits proinflammatory cells, including eosinophils
  and basophils, to the site of inflammation, and additionally promotes the overexpression
  of mucus-producing goblet cells and contributes to airway hyperresponsiveness. Crosstalk
  within the inflammatory pathway promotes a self-propagating cycle of chronic inflammation.

  the supporting connective tissue of the nasal cavity, while the lower right side
