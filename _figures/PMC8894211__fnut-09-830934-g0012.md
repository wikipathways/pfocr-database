caption: A hypothetical integrated metabolic network of key differential metabolites
  and genes in significant pathways identified by multiomics analysis after ingestion
  of krill oil as a phospholipid source of feed based on the KEGG pathway database.
  The yellow frame represents the metabolism of amino acids. The purple bottom frame
  represents the metabolism of lipids. The gray bottom box indicates another accessory
  pathway metabolism. The pink bottom frame represents hormones. The gene symbol represents
  the hub gene of the pathway. The green arrow indicates the regulation of the downstream.
  The blue arrow indicates the path direction.
