caption: Role of RA in Seahorse Brood Pouch Formation and PregnancyDetailed gene expression
  data are shown in  and .(A) Role of RA synthesis and signaling during pregnancy
  of two seahorse species, H. erectus and H. abdominalis. RA synthesis and signaling
  pathway is simplified from Duester. Upward and downward arrows indicate upregulation
  and downregulation of genes and metabolites during pouch pregnancy, respectively.
  Each arrow represents one gene.(B) Summarized functions of RA target genes in seahorse
  brood pouch formation and pregnancy. RA might function upstream of testosterone
  and progesterone by regulating the expression of fshr and cyp7a1. Oval circles indicate
  RA target genes that were significantly differentially expressed during pouch formation
  or pregnancy and three rectangles indicate diverse functions that may be regulated
  by RA.
