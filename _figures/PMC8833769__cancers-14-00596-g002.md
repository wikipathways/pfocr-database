caption: 'Overview of metabolic pathways most consistently reported to be altered
  in PCa in the multi-omics studies reviewed in this article, including: hexosamine
  biosynthesis pathway [,], purine metabolism [], fatty acid synthesis [,,], amino
  acid metabolism [], TCA cycle [,], glutathione metabolism [], glutaminolysis [,]
  and polyamine metabolism [,]. Thick lines highlight the metabolic pathways found
  to be upregulated in PCa tumors when compared with benign prostate tissue. References
  corresponding to the multi-omic studies describing alterations in each metabolic
  pathway are included. α-KG: alpha-ketoglutarate, Fructose-6P: fructose-6-phosphate,
  Glucosamine-6P: glucosamine-6-phosphate, Glucose-6P: glucose-6-phosphate, IMP: inosine
  monophosphate, PRPP: phosphoribosyl diphosphate, Ribose-5P: ribose-5-phosphate.'
