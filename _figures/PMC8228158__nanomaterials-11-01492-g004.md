caption: 'Metabolic network of PGA metabolism in model bacteria B. subtilis 168. Exogenous
  glu can serve as a direct precursor of PGA synthesis. Alternatively, sugars are
  metabolized via the Embden Meyerhof (EM) pathway, PPP and TCA. αKG from TCA is then
  converted to L-glu (the PGA monomer) by two different enzymes—glutamine oxoglutarate
  aminotransferase (GOGAT), which transfers the amino group from a glutamine molecule,
  and Glu dehydrogenase (GluDH), which incorporates the amino group from an ammonium
  molecule. In the species producing L/D-PGA (such as B. subtilis), a racemization
  reaction to produce the D-isomer takes place. This can be produced by means of two
  different enzymatic reactions: the Glu racemase (RacE) directly interconverting
  the isomers and a 3-enzymatic-step reaction by L-glu-pyruvate aminotrasnferase (L-Glu-AT),
  alanine racemase (Alr), and D-glu-pyruvate aminotransferase (D-Glu-AT). D/L glu
  monomers are then polymerized in the active site formed by membrane-bound PgsB (B)
  and PgsC (C), and the elongated chain is then removed from the active site by PgsA
  (A). The role of PgsE (E) is still under debate, while PgdS (S) is a secreted peptidase
  that releases the PGA to the medium. The main metabolic pathways, TCA, GNG, and
  PPP, are indicated in green. The pathway leading to PGA synthesis is indicated in
  blue. Key enzymes, glucokinase (GK), GOGAT, GluDH, glutamine synthetase (GS), L-Glu-AT,
  Alr, D-Glu-AT, and RacE are indicated.'
