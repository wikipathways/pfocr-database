caption: Time course metabolomics of aerobically growing wild-type C. glutamicum ATCC
  31831 (black diamonds) and recombinant strains overexpressing pyruvate kinase in
  the absence or presence of araR deletion (31831/pCHpyk, blue triangles; ΔaraR/pCHpyk,
  red circles). Relative abundances of metabolic intermediates in cells during aerobic
  growth in BT medium containing a mixture of d-glucose and l-arabinose are shown.
  The X-axis indicates cultivation time (h). For the profiling experiment, three strains
  were grown aerobically to late log phase in A medium containing 20 g/L of l-arabinose
  and 20 g/L of d-glucose, and the culture was then inoculated to an initial OD600
  of 0.2 into BT medium containing a mixture of d-glucose and l-arabinose as the carbon
  sources (15 g/L each). The cells were harvested at 11, 17, and 23 h of cultivation
  and subsequently subjected to metabolome analysis. Data are presented as average ± standard
  deviation calculated from the results of triplicate individual experiments. The
  concentration of erythrose-4-phosphate was below the detection limit
