caption: miRNA and lncRNA interaction analysis of THBS2. Based on the miRWalk database,
  miRNA interaction analysis was performed. miR-4677-5p has the strongest interaction
  with the 3′UTR area of THBS2. In addition, lncRNAs LINC01215, TSIX, and BAIAP2-AS1
  have direct interaction with THBS2 mRNA, based on the lncRNA interaction analysis
  using lncRRIsearch database. However, there is no interaction between miRNAs and
  lncRNAs in this network.
