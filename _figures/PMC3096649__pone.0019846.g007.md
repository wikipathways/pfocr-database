caption: Globally, after ligand binding IGF1R can signal directly from the membrane
  (IGF1R signaling internalization-independent), with a major degree of IRS1/PI3K/AKT
  signaling activation and a smaller enhancement of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling
  pathway, or, when internalized either by clathrin and/or caveolin-dependent mechanisms,
  it can signal from vesicles. In the case of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, IGF1R
  is recruited to CCPs through interaction of its cytoplasmic tails with the protein
  adaptor AP2, which in turn recruits clathrin to the plasma membrane and promotes
  its assembly into a lattice network. Through protein-protein interaction, clathrin
  and AP2 also bind several proteins of the endocytic machinery, such as dynamin,
  which regulates the fission of the CCPs with the consequent formation of CCVs, and
  GRB2, which recruits and binds the SOS protein and the IGF1R-phosphorylated protein
  Shc, activating the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and p38MAPK signaling pathways. To a lesser
  extent, it also activates the IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In the case of caveolin-dependent
  endocytosis, IGF1R is recruited to caveolae, promoting caveolin phosphorylation
  and the subsequent recruitment of dynamin, which promotes caveolar budding and the
  formation of cavicles. Cav-1 phosphorylation phosphorylates IRS-1, enhancing the
  activation of thePI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The thickness of the arrows indicates
  the prevalence of signaling pathway activation. CPMZ treatment inhibits the formation
  of CCP by inhibiting clathrin-heavy-chain conformations and MCB inhibits the formation
  of cavicles by depleting cholesterol, disrupting the caveolae.
