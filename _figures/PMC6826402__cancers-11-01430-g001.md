caption: (A) Proteomic workflow for the investigation of molecular determinants of
  acquired resistance to cetuximab. For Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) isobaric labelling,
  proteins have been extracted from sensitive and cetuximab-resistant GEO cells, digested
  into peptides and labelled with TMT isobaric stable isotope tags. After mixing,
  in MS1, the peptides appear as a single precursor. When fragmented during MS2, in
  addition to the normal fragment ions, the reporter regions dissociate to produce
  ion signals which provide accurate quantitative information regarding the relative
  amount of the peptide in the samples. (B) Protein interaction network including
  a subset of proteins identified in GEO colon cancer cells mapping on EGFR1 pathway.
  Proteins mapping on EGFR1 pathway were identified in both sensitive and cetuximab-resistant
  GEO cell lines by performing an enrichment analysis against the human cancer and
  immune signaling pathways “NetPath” (). These proteins were then mapped on the EGFR1
  interaction network by the FunRich software. Up- and down-regulated proteins are
  colored in red and green, respectively. Proteins identified in both sensitive and
  cancer-resistant GEO cells by LC-MS/MS with no changes in their expression levels
  are reported in blue. For the network construction clusters with more than two nodes
  were only included. Interactions from outside the experimental dataset were excluded
  from the network. Molecules are named according to Funrich software.
