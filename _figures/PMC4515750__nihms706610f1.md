caption: 'Drosophila gene names are used.a) miRNA pathway: Canonical miRNAs are processed
  from long primary transcripts by Drosha/Pasha complex in nucleus to produce pre-miRNAs.
  Processed pre-miRNAs are then processed by Dcr-1/loqs complex after exported to
  cytoplasm. One strand of a small RNA duplex of miRNA is preferentially incorporated
  into AGO1 complex to regulate target expression. Mirtron pathway is an alternative
  pathway to produce pre-miRNAs. Mirtrons are directly produced by splicing reactions
  followed by de-branching of the intron lariats. Thus mirtrons are produced by a
  Drosha/Pasha independent manner. Several mirtron genes are predicted to have single
  stranded extensions (tailed mirtrons). Although the first tailed mirtron found in
  Drosophila has a 3′ tail, the tails appeared to be located on 5′ sides of hairpins
  in vertebrates. Endo-shRNAs (only found in mouse so far) are proposed to directly
  produce pre-miRNAs by RNA polymerase III transcription. Small regulatory RNAs from
  tRNAs and snoRNAs are also found in mammalian large scale libraries.b) Exogenous
  siRNA pathway. The exogenous siRNA pathway was originally found during studies on
  molecular mechanisms of artificial RNA interference using synthetic dsRNAs. Later
  this pathway was found to play roles in anti-viral response. siRNAs are processed
  from exogenous dsRNAs (such as those derived from viral genomes or their replication
  intermediates, or artificial dsRNAs) by the complex containing Dcr-2 and its cofactor,
  R2D2. Resulting siRNAs are loaded to the effector AGO2 by the Dcr-2/R2D2 loading
  complex.c) Endogenous siRNA pathway. siRNAs are endogenously generated from dsRNAs
  produced from various sources including transcripts containing inverted-repeat (hairpin-RNAs),
  sense-antisense transcript pairs (cis- or trans-Natural Antisense Transcripts) and
  dsRNAs produced from transposons. Endogenously produced dsRNAs are cleaved by the
  Dcr-2/Loqs-PD complex to produce endogenous siRNAs, and siRNAs are loaded into AGO2.
  Endogenous siRNAs play roles in transposon repression and gene regulation.'
