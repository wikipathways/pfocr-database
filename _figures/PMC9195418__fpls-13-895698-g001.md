caption: Degradation of ABA core components by the 26S ubiquitin-proteasome system
  and endosomal-vacuole pathway. PYR1/PYLs are degraded by RSL1, RFA1/RFA4, and CRL4DDA1
  through ubiquitin-proteasome system. RSL1 ubiquitinates PYR1/PYL4 on the plasma
  membrane (PM), after that ubiquitinated substrates are degraded by ESCRT components,
  FIVE1/VPS23A/ALIX via endosomal-vacuole pathway. RFA1- and RFA4/CRL4DDA1-mediated
  ubiquitination processes occur in the cytosol and nucleus, respectively. PP2Cs are
  degraded by PUB12/13, CRL3BPM3/5(BTB-MATH), PIR1/2, and RGLG1/5 through 26S proteasome.
  PUB12/13 degrade ABI1 by ubiquitination in the PM. RGLG1/5 ubiquitinate PP2CA/ABI2/HAB2,
  CRL3BPM3/5(BTB-MATH) ubiquitinate PP2CA/ABI1/HAB1, and PIR1/2 ubiquitinates PP2CA
  in the nucleus. This figure has been modified from .
