caption: Glycolytic pathway and targets of anticancer drugs in CSCs. Glucose is first
  imported into CSCs through a glucose transporter (GLUT) and then metabolized by
  multiple glycolytic enzymes to generate ATP. Besides, glycolysis also provides precursors
  for biosynthesis of amino acids and nucleotides. Several factors, such as hypoxia-inducible
  factor (HIF), MYC, OCT4, MEIS1 affect the flux of the glycolytic pathway. HIF promotes
  glycolysis by upregulation of GLUT and glycolytic enzymes, which are also targets
  of some anticancer drugs, such as WZB117, fasentin, phlorstin, silybin/silibinin,
  2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), ionidamine, and the BET inhibitor.
