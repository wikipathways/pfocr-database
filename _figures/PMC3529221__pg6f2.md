caption: Effects of glutamate receptor activation on APP processing. The APP is cleaved
  via (A) nonamyloidogenic and (B) amyloidogenic pathways. (A) The nonamyloidogenic
  pathway precludes amyloid β production due to (1) α-secretase cleavage, by ADAM10
  or ADAM17, of APP within the amyloid β domain, which (2) results in production of
  soluble APPα and α-CTF. (3) Short-term N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation
  increases the trafficking of ADAM10 to the cell membrane via interactions with SAP-97
  and (4) metabotropic glutamate receptor activation of ADAM17 via PKC, thus increasing
  nonamyloidogenic APP processing. (B) The main β-secretase, BACE1, (5) initiates
  the production of amyloid β peptide, which occurs partly within the late-endosomes,
  by (6) cleaving APP into soluble APPβ and β-CTF. Prolonged NMDA receptor activation
  results in high Ca2+ levels and activation of CaMK-IV, which in turn enhances transcription
  of more amyloidogenic APP751 and APP770 isoforms. (7) The high Ca2+ levels also
  increase vesicle binding to the plasma membrane and subsequent transport of APP
  via endocytosis to late-endosomes, where it can be processed by BACE1. Thus, increased
  NMDA receptor activation enhances amyloidogenic processing of APP. The α- and β-CTFs
  generated from nonamyloidogenic and amyloidogenic pathways are further processed
  by the γ-secretase complex, leading to the formation of (8) AICD fragment, and the
  P3 or (9) amyloid β peptides, respectively. Activation of mGluRs 2 and 5 is also
  thought to increase generation of amyloid β peptide.
