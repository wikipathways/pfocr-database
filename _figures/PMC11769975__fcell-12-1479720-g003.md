caption: 'Possible molecular mechanisms of Fusobacterium nucleatum in tumor progression
  [This figure was created using MedPeer (www.medpeer.cn)]. (A) Esophageal dysbiosis
  promotes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) progression: NOD-RIPK 2 is activated
  when esophageal cells are infected by Fusobacterium nucleatum. Once NOD-RIPK 2 is
  activated, NF-κB is triggered, resulting in DNA damage and gene mutation. Furthermore,
  via activating NLRP3, Fusobacterium nucleatum generates MDSC. This environment may
  encourage tumor proliferation, metastasis, and chemical resistance, all of which
  can result in a poor prognosis. (B) Fusobacterium nucleatum accelerates breast cancer
  progression: Fusobacterium nucleatum promotes the colonization of breast cancer
  patients by identifying overexpressed GalNAc from Fap 2. In human breast cancer
  tissue, the entry of nucleated Fusobacterium cells into the underlying tissue was
  facilitated by the overexpression of MMP-9 and other matrix metalloproteinases.
  FadA adhesins also trigger the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which speeds up
  the development of breast cancer. Furthermore, F. nucleatum stimulates TLR4/MyD88
  to enhance NF-κβ activation, which advances CRC. Breast cancer cell invasion and
  metastasis are facilitated by TLR 4/MyD 88 signaling. Furthermore, BIRC3 prevents
  apoptosis by blocking the caspase cascade, which causes tumors to develop and spread'
