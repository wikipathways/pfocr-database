caption: 'Activation of the β 2AR with isoproterenol increases cAMP which then activates
  PKA. PKA then phosphorylates and activates CFTR which controls the activity of an
  ATP conduit in the erythrocyte membrane. Increases in cAMP associated with activation
  of the β 2AR are regulated by the activities of both PDE2 and PDE4. Similarly, activation
  of the IPR by iloprost results in increases in cAMP which activate ATP release from
  the erythrocyte. However, in the case of the IPR signaling pathway, increases in
  cAMP are regulated by the activity of PDE3.Abbreviations: β 2AR = β 2 adrenergic
  receptor; Gs = the heterotrimeric G protein, Gs; α, β and γ = G protein subunits,
  PDE = phosphodiesterase; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; cAMP = cyclic adenosine monophosphate,
  AMP = adenosine monophosphate; AC = adenylyl cyclase; PKA = protein kinase A; CFTR
  = cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; ? = unknown ATP conduit;
  + = activation; IPR = prostacyclin receptor.'
