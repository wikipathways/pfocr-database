caption: Activating and inhibitory receptors on NK cells and their signaling pathway.
  NK cells express various activating and inhibitory receptors. Upon interaction with
  their cognate ligands on the target (tumor) cell surface, they initiate a downstream
  signaling pathway that ultimately dictates the effector and cytotoxicity function
  of NK cells. The interaction of the activating receptor with their ligand initiates
  primarily mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide-3 kinase
  (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway that
  activates nuclear factor- κB (NFκB) transcription factor. Activating receptors also
  activate the Ca2+signaling pathway through phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)-protein kinase
  C (PKC) axis that further activates the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT)
  transcription factor. Activated NF-κB and NF-AT drive the production of cytokines
  and regulate the cytotoxic functions of NK cells. In contrast, the interaction of
  inhibitory receptors with their ligand activates the Src homology region 2 domain-containing
  phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) that inhibits the functions of downstream signaling kinases
  and inhibits the activation of transcription factors like NF-κB and concurrently
  inhibits NK cell effector and cytotoxic function.
