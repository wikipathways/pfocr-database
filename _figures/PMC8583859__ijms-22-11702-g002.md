caption: 'The interaction between α-syn and neuroinflammation in PD. (a) Activation
  of glial cells by pathological α-syn aggregates; (b) Signaling pathways in microglia
  and astrocytes triggered by interaction with the different aggregation patterns
  of α-syn; (c) Neuronal and BBB dysfunction triggered by the neuroinflammatory environment.
  Dash lines indicate the signaling pathway activated by CD36; Question marks and
  faded green lines indicate the proposed mechanism for oligomeric and fibrillar α-syn
  interaction with astrocytes, and thick red lines indicate the proinflammatory molecules
  that lead to dysfunction of the BBB and neural degeneration. Abbreviations: AKT,
  Protein kinase B; BBB, Blood-brain barrier; C1q, complement component 1q; CD, cluster
  of differentiation; COX, cyclooxygenase; EP2, E prostanoid receptor 2; ERK2, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase 2; FcγR, the gamma chain subunit of Fc receptor; H2O2, hydrogen
  peroxide; IL, interleukin; MCP-1, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1; MHC, Major
  Histocompatibility Complex; MMP-9, Matrix metallopeptidase 9; NF-κB, nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; NLRP3, NLR family pyrin domain
  containing 3; P2X7R, P2X7 receptor; PGE2, Prostaglandin E2; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TLR, Toll-like receptors; TNF-α, tumor necrosis
  factor-alpha. Created with BioRender.com.'
