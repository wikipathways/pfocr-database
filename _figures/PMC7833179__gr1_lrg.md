caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathways involved in the mechanism
  of actions of PDE5i that act by inhibiting PDE5, the cGMP degrading enzyme, leading
  to increased intracellular cGMP that acts by activating many kinases, customarily
  PKG, but it also triggers the activation of PKC/Akt and GSK-3, PKC can be activated
  by NO, in a cGMP-independent manner. cGMP inhibits MPTP formation and Cyto C release.
  cGMP activation can, alone/through PKG, suppress the function of molecules associated
  with ERS and thus prevents ERS and ERS-mediated apoptosis. Besides, PKG stimulates
  proteasome activity, autophagy and increases angiogenesis resulting in the inhibition
  of cellular apoptosis and promotion of cell survival. The PKG pathway inhibits many
  cytokines, and inflammatory mediators leading to cell survival. PDE5i could induce
  HO-1 expression through Nrf2. HO-1 enzyme has the affinity to inhibit cytokine and
  chemokine responses such as IL-1β, IL-8, IL-33, MCP-1, MIP-1β, and apoptotic markers.
  The pro-inflammatory chemokine IL-6 upregulates HO-1, which in turn inhibits IL-6
  to limit the inflammatory responses. There is a positive feedback loop between HO-1
  and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) and a negative feedback loop between HO-1 and TNF-α
  (pro-inflammatory). HO-1 enzyme also produces biliverdin, CO that antagonizes ROS
  and stimulates autophagy that antagonizes apoptosis with the ultimate cell survival.
  In addition, PDE5i induces H2S production, stimulated by CSE and CBS enzymes, with
  an affinity to inhibit inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6), apoptotic markers (NF.kB,
  Bcl2, caspase-3) and antagonizes ROS with the ultimate cell survival. Akt = protein
