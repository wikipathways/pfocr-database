caption: IL-17A-mediated immunity. IL-17A (IL-17) is produced by a variety of cells
  including Th17 cells, γδ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T (NKT)
  cells and group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3). IL-17 binds to the IL-17 receptor
  (IL-17R)A and IL-17RC complex, expressed by a variety of cells including macrophages,
  fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and epithelial and endothelial cells. This initiates
  two primary IL-17 signalling pathways which mediate the essential functions of IL-17.
  The canonical pathway activates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) pathways, that
  trigger transcriptional activation of downstream target genes, including pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, chemokines and anti-microbial peptides, as well as genes related to tissue
  remodeling. The non-canonical pathway leads to the stabilization of mRNA transcripts.
  Together, these pathways mediate immune responses which contribute to the pathogenesis
  of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, neutrophil recruitment and are important
  for host defence against pathogens including bacteria, viruses and fungi. Created
  with BioRender.
