caption: Extracellular vesicle biogenesis and secretion in donor cells as well as
  its interaction with and intracellular fate in recipient cells. Microvesicles directly
  shed from the plasma membrane, where budding microdomains undergo phosphatidylserine
  translocation and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. By contrast, exosomes originate
  from endosomal pathway. Deriving from endocytosis, early sorting endosomes accumulate
  ILVs within the endosomal lumen and then mature into MVEs, where ESCRT components,
  ceramide, tetraspanins and syntenin could act in parallel or separately to recruit
  exosomal cargoes and generate ILVs. At this checkpoint, the MVEs can either enter
  into autophagy-lysosome pathway or exosomal secretion pathway. of note, amphisomes
  can either fuse with lysosomes or the plasm membrane. Upon secretion into extracellular
  space, exosomes and microvesicles can bind to the recipient cell surface via ligand-receptor
  or glycoprotein interactions and initiate signaling, uptake and fusion processes,
  contributing to transfer functional messages and cellular phenotypes. MVE (multivesicular
  endosome), EV (extracellular vesicle), PM (the plasma membrane), Ub (ubiquitin),
  ECM (extracellular matrix), ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport),
  SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor)
