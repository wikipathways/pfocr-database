caption: a | Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 2 (NOD2) detects bacterial
  peptidoglycans and triggers the ubiquitylation of receptor-interacting protein 2
  (RIP2), which leads to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  cascade and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). b | In the retinoic acid-inducible gene I
  (RIG-I)-mediated pathway that senses viral RNA, K63-linked polyubiquitylation and
  the E3 ligases triparite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) and riplet are important
  for RIG-I activation. RIG-I transduces the signal to mitochondrial antiviral signalling
  protein (MAVS) on mitochondria, and this induces the activation of the IκB kinase
  (IKK) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) complexes through NF-κB essential modulator
  (NEMO). Ubiquitylation of NEMO and TBK1 by TRIM23 and mindbomb (MIB) proteins, respectively,
  has been suggested to mediate TBK1 activation. IKK and TBK1 activate NF-κB and interferon
  regulatory factors (IRFs) to induce the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and type I interferons (IFNs), respectively. c | Activation of the stimulator of
  interferon genes (STING)-mediated pathways that sense intracellular DNA also involves
  ubiquitylation (for example, by TRIM56). cIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein;
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TANK, TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator.
