caption: 'The basic modules of mitochondrial function and major toxicity targets in
  cardiomyocytes. Substrate catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), redox
  homeostasis, mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore (mPTP), and mitochondrial quality control (MQC) constitute the major functional
  units and toxicity targets in cardiomyocytes. (A) Substrate catabolism. Fatty acids,
  esterificated by fatty acyl-CoA synthase enzymes, are taken up through CPT I, CPT
  II, and CAT, and are then oxidized into acetyl-CoA inside the mitochondrion. Pyruvate
  from glycolysis is also oxidized into acetyl-CoA by PDH in the mitochondrion. Acetyl-CoA
  then goes through TCA cycle to generate reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH2), which
  fuel OXPHOS to produce ATP. This bioenergetic process can be disturbed by downregulated
  expression or decreased activities of carriers and enzymes for the TCA cycle and
  fatty acids β-oxidation. (B) OXPHOS. Electrons are extracted by complex Ⅰ and II
  from reducing equivalents, and move through ETC complexes, pumping protons into
  the IMS to generate MMP. MMP in turn drives proton flow back into the mitochondrial
  matrix through complex V, releasing this energy to generate ATP. Mitochondrial toxicants
  can reduce the expression and/or activity of ETC complexes, uncouple ETC from ATP
  synthesis, and impair MMP. (C) Redox homeostasis. mtROS produced in physiological
  state can be cleared by series antioxidant enzymes, such as GSH, SOD, and CAT. Drugs
  with mitochondrial toxicity can overproduce mtROS by inhibiting ETC complexes (especially
  complex Ⅰ and III) or decreasing the levels or activity of antioxidant enzymes,
  or there may be a combination of both mechanisms. (D) Map of mtDNA. The mitochondrion
  possesses its own genome, mtDNA, within the matrix, which can be replicated, transcribed,
  and translated into some of the MRC complexes. mtDNA, topoisomerase II for mtDNA
  repair, and DNA polymerase for mtDNA replication are all reported targets for toxicants.
  (E) mPTP. mPTP is a channel whose components have not been fully elucidated. The
  normal closed state can be triggered into an open state by a series of stresses,
  especially Ca2+ overload and oxidative stress. mPTP opening induces cytochrome c
  releasing into the cytoplasm, resulting in the initiation of apoptosis. (F) MQC.
  Defective mitochondria can be regulated by MQC, mainly including mitochondrial biogenesis
  and mitophagy. Damaged mitochondria can be cleared by mitophagy though ubiquitin-dependent
  or -independent pathways. In cardiomyocytes, ubiquitin-dependent pathway (Pink1-Parkin-mediated
  mitophagy) is induced by MMP depolarization, while the ubiquitin-independent pathway
  can be directly induced by LIR containing mitophagy receptors located on OMM in
  cardiomyocytes. Energy depletion after mitophagy activates genome-encoded transcriptional
  elements, which directly express mitochondrial proteins or regulate mtDNA to express
  related proteins for the assembly of new mitochondria. Toxicants may influence mitophagy
  or biogenesis to disturb MQC. Abbreviations: ANT: adenine nucleotide transporter;
