caption: Control of MBF-regulated transcription by the DNA replication checkpoint.
  The influence of the DNA replication checkpoint on the MBF transcriptional regulatory
  circuit is depicted. MBF-regulated promoters are normally repressed as cells progress
  into S phase as a consequence of the expression of the NRM1 gene and the accumulation
  of its product, the MBF-specific repressor, Nrm1 (dashed line, graph). When the
  DNA replication checkpoint is activated as a consequence of stalling of DNA replication
  forks, the DNA replication checkpoint pathway leads ultimately to the activation
  of the Rad53 protein kinase, which can phosphorylate the downstream protein kinase
  Dun1 and the Nrm1 protein. Phosphorylation activates Dun1, which can then phosphorylate
  the transcriptional repressor Crt1, leading to the activation of DNA damage response
  (DDR) genes. Phosphorylation of Nrm1 inactivates it as a transcriptional repressor,
  leading to persistent activation of MBF target genes (solid line, graph) to support
  repair of DNA and restoration of DNA replication. The color of subunits and arrows
  is as in .
