caption: Effects of cell growth on autophagy. Growth-dependent import of nutrients,
  such as amino acids and glucose, generates multiple signals that influence the induction
  of autophagy through their effects on pH, osmotic pressure (Π) and the electrochemical
  gradient (ΔΨ), as well as through several key signaling molecules such as Gcn2 (EIF2AK4
  in mammals), TOR (or mTOR) and AMPK. The eIF2α kinase Gcn2 senses reduced amino
  acid levels through the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs, and activates autophagy-related
  gene expression through the transcription factor Gcn4 (ATG4 in mammals). Amino acids
  activate the mTOR pathway, in part, by recruiting mTOR complexes to the lysosomal
  surface through factors such as the Rag GTPases and p62, and through effects on
  intracellular lysosomal positioning. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) responds
  to glucose uptake, and regulates multiple downstream targets that have effects on
  autophagy, including mTOR, Atg1 (ULK1 in mammals) and CDKs (through cyclin kinase
  inhibitors; CKIs). The induction of autophagy can also be suppressed by the presence
  of actively translating ribosomes on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, which
  might limit the availability of sites for autophagosome nucleation. Additional components
  of TOR, Atg1 and Vps34 complexes are indicated. Please refer to the text for details.
