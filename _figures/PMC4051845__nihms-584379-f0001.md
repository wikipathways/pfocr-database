caption: The three major modalities of DSB repair (NHEJ, HDR and MMEJ/SSA) are depicted.
  NHEJ can process ligatable DNA ends but is inhibited by modified/damaged DNA ends.
  In contrast, MMEH or HDR, which both initiate by resection, can process both types
  of ends. Competition between NHEJ and HDR takes place directly on DNA ends between
  KU and MRN, as well as in the vicinity of the break between 53BP1 and BRCA1. HDR
  is not operating in G1 due to the absence of a sister chromatin as homologous template.
  NHEJ in S-phase is toxic. See text for details.
