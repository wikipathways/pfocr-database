caption: Schematic illustration of the possible neuroprotective mechanisms of ω-3
  PUFA supplementation after TBI. As illustrated, TBI-induced microglial activation
  initiates a neuronal-glial neuroinflammatory response by producing a wide array
  of pro-inflammatory factors or mediators such as TNF, ILs, and IFN. Under inflammatory
  conditions, activation of the HMGB1/NF-κB pathway is closely related to its acetylation
  levels, which is regulated by SIRT1. Supplementation with ω-3PUFA attenuates the
  inflammatory response by modulating microglial polarization through SIRT1-mediated
  deacetylation of HMGB1/NF-κB pathway, leading to neuroprotective effects following
  experimental traumatic brain injury
