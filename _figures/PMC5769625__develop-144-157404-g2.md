caption: Layers of gene expression control in primed human PSCs. Overview of the major
  determinants of global gene expression in hPSCs cultured under conventional (primed)
  culture conditions. (A) The core transcription factors OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG form
  an autoregulatory network and repress distinct lineage fates in hESCs (; ). (B)
  Crosstalk among the major signaling pathways in hESCs as proposed by . According
  to this model, activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by IGF1 or FGF2 promotes the self-renewal
  of hESCs via two mechanisms. First, PI3K/AKT modulates the threshold of SMAD2/3
  activity, allowing for the activation of NANOG but not mesendoderm-associated genes.
  As shown in A, the activation of NANOG stimulates the expression of core pluripotency
  genes and blocks neuroectoderm differentiation. Active PI3K/AKT also inhibits MEK/ERK
  and maintains GSK3β activity, which blocks β-catenin-mediated stimulation of pro-differentiation
  genes. Note that Wnt/β-catenin signaling has a distinct role in mESCs, where it
  functions to promote self-renewal instead of differentiation (; ; ). (C) Chromatin-modifying
  enzymes with functional significance in hESC self-renewal include EZH1/2, which
  deposit H3K27me3 (; ), and enzymes that control the levels of H3K4me3 (; ). (D)
  Various non-coding RNAs regulate the human pluripotent state. Transposon-derived
  lncRNAs, including HERVH and HPAT5, contribute to the self-renewal of hESCs (; ),
  as does miR-302/367 (; ; ). However, let-7 miRNA blocks the processing of pluripotency
  transcripts and is inhibited by LIN28 (; ; ). (E) Other major determinants of gene
  expression in hPSCs. (Left) Metabolites, such as methionine (Met) and glucose (Gluc),
  generate substrates for histone modifications in hPSCs (; ). (Middle) The spliceosome
  produces a pluripotency-specific isoform of the transcription factor FOXP1, while
  SON ensures the accurate splicing of OCT4 and PRDM14 (; ). (Right) Insulated neighborhoods
  established by cohesion-associated CTCF loops constrain enhancer-promoter interactions
  at human pluripotency loci ().
