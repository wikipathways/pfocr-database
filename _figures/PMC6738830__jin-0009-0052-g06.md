caption: Proposed model for impaired apoptotic response to hMPV infection in NECs
  from asthmatics. HMPV induced sustained ER stress and activated the maladaptive
  UPR through the PERK pathway. GADD34 maintained the ER burden and the pro-apoptotic
  BH3-only proteins NOXA and PUMA altered mitochondrial integrity. However, downstream
  formation of the apoptosome was compromised by hMPV-induced HSP70, which impaired
  caspase-9 and caspase-3/7 activation. This defect in the execution of intrinsic
  apoptosis resulted in elevated infection in NECs from asthmatic subjects.
