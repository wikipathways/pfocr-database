caption: 'Schematic model of effects of curcumin in the p53 stabilization. Curcumin
  activates the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-nuclear factor (erythroid-derived
  2)-like 2 pathway (Keap1/Nrf2) pathway; Nrf2 is translocated into the nucleus and
  binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) sequences increasing the expression
  of NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). NQO1 is translated and binds to p53
  promoting the loss of interaction between p53 and its negative regulators. Curcumin
  also stabilizes the interaction between NQO1-p53. In cells with wild-type p53 (WT
  p53) the p53 pathway is activated and has an effect on cell viability whereas in
  cells with mutated p53 (MT p53) there is only accumulation of p53 without effect
  on cell viability.'
