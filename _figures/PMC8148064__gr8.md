caption: The graphic illustration of the mechanism of celastrol ameliorating metabolic
  syndrome. In obesity, adipose tissue generates resistin, which binds to CAP1 on
  macrophages and activates the PKA‒NF-κB pathway and promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. These pro-inflammatory factors further promote inflammation and insulin
  resistance of adipose tissue on the one hand, and also aggravate liver insulin resistance
  and hepatic steatosis on the other hand. Celastrol effectively prevents inflammatory
  response through binding to CAP1 and inhibiting the interaction between resistin
  and CAP1. Created in BioRender.com.
