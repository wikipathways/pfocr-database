caption: A schematic representation of the HO in the present case. Although the primary
  tumor did not produce BMP-2 nor show HO, the metastasized tumor cells acquired the
  ability to express BMP-2 and TGF-β1. TGF-β1 stimulated the expression of BMP-2 and
  Gli2, and Gli2 stimulated the expression of BMP-2. BMP-2 induced the production
  of bone material, such as osteonectin or osteocalcin. BMP-2 and TGF-β1 were secreted
  outside the tumor cells and transformed fibroblasts and, probably, pluripotent stem
  cells into osteocytes. In addition, Gli2 stimulated the Smad pathway in the nucleus
  and induced bone formation through the RUNX2 pathway. Chemotherapy might contribute
  to Gli2 overexpression by activating the Hedgehog pathway. These findings provide
  evidence that HO can occur independently, without the transformation of pluripotent
  stem cells into osteoblast-like cells, and that the present case resulted from osteogenesis
  via the EMT. In contrast, most previously reported cases resulted from the metaplasia
  of stromal cells into osteoblasts
