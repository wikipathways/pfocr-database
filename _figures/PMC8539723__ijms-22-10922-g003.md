caption: Signaling cascade of IL-6. Interleukin (IL)-6 activates a signal cascade
  via three modes of receptor–ligand interaction. (A) Classical signaling. IL-6 binds
  to its receptor, IL-6Rα, then activates an intracellular signal transduction pathway
  via glycoprotein130 (gp130) dimerization. (B) Trans-signaling. IL-6R also exists
  as a secreted form (sIL-6Rα). sIL-6Rα binds to IL-6, and the resulting complex binds
  to gp130 on endothelial cells or synovial fibroblasts. (C) Trans presentation. Circulating
  IL-6 binds to IL-6Rα expressed on dendritic cells, and then the IL-6/IL-6Rα complex
  binds to gp130 expressed on CD4+ T cells. The IL-6/IL-6Rα complex binds gp130 to
  form a gp130 homodimer, thus activating Janus kinase (JAK). JAK activates the signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family transcription factors, mainly
  STAT3, and src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP-2). JAK phosphorylates
  STAT3 to form a homodimer, which then translocates to the nucleus where it functions
  as a transcription factor. JAK also activates the extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway through SHP-2. STAT3
  induces suppressor of cytokine signaling1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3; SOCS1 inhibits JAK
  directly, and SOCS3 inhibits gp130. Promising therapeutic targets are indicated
  with an asterisk. In addition to a JAK inhibitor, an inhibitor of STAT, and a substrate
  that would regulate the level of SOCS expression could be therapeutic targets.

  description: Signaling cascade of IL-6. Interleukin (IL)-6 activates a signal cascade
