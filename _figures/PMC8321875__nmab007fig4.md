caption: Neuroprotective effect of EA against 6-OHDA–induced neuropathy and diabetic
  encephalopathy. 6-OHDA, by the process of auto-oxidation, enhances oxidative stress
  in brain cells and consequently decreases ATP formation, which in turn leads to
  free radical production. EA inhibits the overproduction of free radicals and reduces
  the levels of MDA and hydroxyl radicals as well as DNA damage with an increase in
  GSH, SOD, and tyrosine hydroxylase concentrations in the brain. EA also upregulates
  the Nrf2 signaling pathway. In diabetic complications, EA reduces oxidative stress
  and oxidation of lipid membranes, but increases the cellular antioxidant response
  (enhances SOD, CAT, and GSH activities). EA also alters signaling pathways associated
  with diabetes, such as Akt pathways. Akt, protein kinase B; CAT, catalase; EA, ellagic
  acid, eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; GSH, reduced glutathione; HO-1, heme
  oxygenase-1; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; Keap1, Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1; MDA, malondialdehyde; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
  2; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase;
  PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PKC, protein kinase C; PTEN, phosphatase
  and tensin homolog; SOD, superoxide dismutase; STZ, streptozotocin; 6-OHDA, 6-hydroxydopamine.
