caption: Mechanisms of SUMOylation and deSUMOylation by transcription factors in renal
  fibrosis and therapeutic targets of natural products against renal fibrosis via
  SUMOylation. Mechanisms of SUMOylation and deSUMOylation by transcription factors
  in renal fibrosis are including TGF-β/Smad signaling, HIF-1α signaling, p53 pathway,
  ER/ERK pathway, NF-κB signaling, and β-catenin pathway. Smad4 is SUMOylated by SUMO1
  and SUMO2/3. HIF-1α is SUMOylated by SUMO1. P53 is SUMOylated by SUMO1 and SUMO2/3,
  and also is upregulate by HDAC2 and COX-2 SUMOylated by SUMO1. ER/ERK is SUMOylated
  by SUMO2/3. NF-κBp65 is SUMOylated by SUMO1, SUMO2/3 and SUMO4, and also is upregulate
  by NEMO SUMOylated by SUMO2/3. PPARγ activated by SUMO ligase E3 could inhibit NF-κB
  signaling. β-catenin is SUMOylated by SUMO1. SNEP1 deSUMOylates HIF-1α and p53.
  Additionally, SNEP6 deSUMOylates NEMO. Ginkgolic acid promotes the expression of
  Smad4 by upregulating SUMO1, while inhibits the expression of p53 by downregulating
  SUMO2/3. Astragaloside IV promotes the expression of HIF-1α by upregulating SUMO1
  and downregulating SENP1. Gallic acid also promotes the expression of HIF-1α by
  downregulating SENP1. Resveratrol induces SUMOylated COX-2 by SUMO1, thus enhancing
  the expression of p53. In addition, Resveratrol inhibits the expression of β-catenin
  by downregulating SUMO1. Puerarin activates ER/ERK pathway by upregulating SUMO2/3.
  Ginsenoside Rg3 inhibits NF-κB by upregulating PPARγ via activating E3.
