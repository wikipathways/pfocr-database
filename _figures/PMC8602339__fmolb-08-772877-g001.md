caption: NER pathways in mammals and prokaryotes. (A) The mammalian NER pathway. Damage
  is recognized by UV-DDB and XPC-Rad23b (blue) in global-genome NER (GG-NER). Stalling
  of RNA polymerase (blue) initiates transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER). Then, damage
  verification is performed by TFIIH, XPA, RPA, ERCC1, XPB, and XPD (gold). XPF incises
  on the 5′ side of the damage and XPG incises on the 3′ side following DNA synthesis
  (both shown in green). Lastly, the repair is performed by DNA polymerase δ/ε/κ and
  sealed by ligase (red). (B) Prokaryotic NER is performed by UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, UvrD,
  Pol I, and ligase. As in mammalian NER, RNA polymerase stalling initiates TC-NER,
  but GG-NER is initiated by UvrA2-UvrB2. For simplicity, CSA, CSB, CSA, XAB2, and
  HMGN1 are not shown in mammalian TC-NER, and Mfd not shown in bacterial TC-NER.
  A 24–32 nucleotide region (A) and 12–13 nucleotide region (B) is replaced in each
  pathway (not to scale). To show functional overlap across the pathways, proteins
  are color-coded with damage detection in blue, verification in gold, incision in
  green, and repair in red.
