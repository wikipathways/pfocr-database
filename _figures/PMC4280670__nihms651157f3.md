caption: Simplified schematic of the crosstalk between UPR and proteasome-mediated
  protein degradation is shown. “S” represents substrate proteins being targeted to
  the 26S proteasome. Viral proteins that modulate or interact with these pathways
  at various stages are shown in green. Compounds or antibodies that were reported
  to inhibit CMV replication by targeting specific steps in a given pathway are shown
  in red. Cellular proteins appear in gray. CMV, cytomegalovirus; UPR, unfolded protein
  response.
