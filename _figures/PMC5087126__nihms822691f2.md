caption: TLR3 recognizes dsRNA [and analogs, such as poly(I:C)] derived from viruses
  or virus-infected cells and induces the antiviral immune response by promoting the
  production of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines (for example, IL-6 and IL-12p40)
  through the TRIF-dependent pathway. TLR7 recognizes ssRNA (and analogs, such as
  R848) and induces the production of type I IFNs and cytokines through the MyD88-dependent
  pathway. IRF3 and IRF5/7, which are activated by the TLR3 and TLR7 pathways, respectively,
  lead to the production of type I IFNs. The activation of both NF-κB and AP-1 by
  both pathways leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines. The detailed reaction
  schemas are shown in .
