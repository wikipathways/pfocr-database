caption: P. gingivalis interacts with the TLR2/1 receptor complex, whereas it evades
  or antagonizes TLR4 by expressing atypical lipopolysaccharide structures (with non-phosphorylated
  tetra-acylated lipid A or mono-phosphorylated tetra-acylated lipid A, respectively).
  The TLR2 response is proactively modified through crosstalk with other receptors
  that are under P. gingivalis control, C5aR and CXCR4. P. gingivalis induces C5aR
  activation by virtue of its Arg-specific gingipains (HRgpA and RgpB) which attack
  C5 and release biologically active C5a. C5a stimulates Gαi-dependent intracellular
  Ca2+signaling which synergistically enhances the otherwise weak cAMP responses induced
  by TLR2 activation alone. Maximal cAMP induction is achieved through the participation
  of CXCR4, which is activated directly by the pathogen’s FimA fimbriae and coassociates
  with both TLR2 and C5aR in lipid rafts. The ensuing activation of the cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase A (PKA) pathway inactivates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) and
  impairs the inducible nitrogen synthase (iNOS)-dependent killing of the pathogen
  in macrophages. The expression of evasive or antagonistic lipid A moreover allows
  internalized P. gingivalis (possibly entering via complement receptor 3 [CR3] which
  promotes its intracellular survival) to prevent caspase 11–dependent non-canonical
  activation of the inflammasome. This mechanism is normally triggered by LPS of intracellular
  gram-negative bacteria and leads to pyroptosis, a proinflammatory mode of lytic
  cell death that protects the host against bacterial infection. P. gingivalis also
  inhibits F. nucleatum-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cytokine secretion
  by inhibiting its endocytosis, although it is uncertain whether this is mediated
  by extracellular or intracellular P. gingivalis.

  description: P. gingivalis interacts with the TLR2/1 receptor complex, whereas it
