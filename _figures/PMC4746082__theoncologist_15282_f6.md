caption: 'The IDO pathway effects to slow the immune response, anti-CTLA-4 blocks
  CTLA-4 from binding CD80. When CTLA-4 binds to CD80 (B7), it starts a series of
  pathway steps. One of these is activation of the IDO pathway, which converts tryptophan
  to kynurenine. The lowering of available tryptophan and elevation of kynurenine
  levels slow the immune reaction of the dendritic cell, T cells, and perhaps other
  immune system cells. If a cancer cell increases its internal IDO pathway, by “Darwinian
  revolution,” it will produce similar environmental levels of tryptophan and kynurenine;
  thus, the environment will tell the immune system to slow or stop, allowing the
  cancer cell to grow unchecked. Treatment with anti-CTLA-4 will stop the binding
  to CD80 and allows the T cell to remain activated.Abbreviations: CTLA-4, cytotoxic
  T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4; IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; MHC, major
  histocompatibility complex; TCR, T-cell receptor surface complex.'
