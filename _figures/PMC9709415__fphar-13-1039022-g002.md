caption: Mechanism of excessive inflammation and oxidative stress in ALI/ARDS. When
  lung endothelial cells are damaged, NADPH oxidase promotes the production of the
  superoxide anion (O2−), and xanthine oxidase (XO) catalyzes the oxidation of purine
  substrates to produce uric acid and O2−. In addition, NO derived from endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) forms highly reactive peroxynitrite with O2− (ONOO-),
  exacerbating nitrification and oxidative damage in the lungs. Under the stimulation
  of various inflammatory and oxidative factors, macrophages polarize into M1 and
  M2 types. M1 macrophages secrete pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-6, MCP-1, and
  TNFα and aggravate neutrophil infiltration, leading to severe acute inflammatory
  injury of the lung. M2 macrophages secrete IL-10, TGFβ, and other factors conducive
  to inflammatory control, but the excessive production of these factors will aggravate
  the process of pulmonary fibrosis. In conclusion, the vicious cycle formed by excessive
  inflammation and oxidative stress intensifies the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS.
