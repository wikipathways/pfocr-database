caption: A. Schematic summary of the nitric oxide signaling system in HeLa cells.
  NO acts through two distinct pathways, one depending on the activity of guanylyl
  cyclase and the other independent of this activity. The pathways converge to uncouple
  Cx35 gap junctions through a mechanism that requires PKA activity. cGMP can either
  activate or inhibit different isoforms of phosphodiesterase (PDEs), thereby regulating
  local cAMP concentration. The cGMP-inhibited PDE3 could account for uncoupling (but
  see discussion). Activation of PKG by cGMP could result in phosphorylation of small
  polypeptide inhibitors of protein phosphatases (PPase) such as G-substrate (GS)
  or DARPP-32, and subsequent inhibition of phosphatase activity. PKG could also activate
  PKA through an unknown mechanism. It is unclear if PKG phosphorylates Cx35 directly.
  In the cGMP-independent pathway, NO may activate PKA directly, may inhibit a protein
  phosphatase activity, or may sensitize Cx35 to the action of PKA.B. Summary of the
  phosphorylation sites on Cx35 that regulate its coupling. Ser110 in the intracellular
  loop and Ser276 in the C-terminal domain are key targets of phosphorylation that
  uncouple the gap junctions. Both PKA and PKG can phosphorylate these sites. Other
  sites in the outer half of the C-terminus such as Ser289 have weaker effects, but
  may modulate the effects of phosphorylation on the two major sites.
