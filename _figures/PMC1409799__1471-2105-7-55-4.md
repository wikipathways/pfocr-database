caption: MAPK signaling pathways produced by PathSys in comparison with the canonical
  KEGG MAPK signaling pathways. a). MAPK signaling pathways in Yeast reproduced by
  KEGG.b). Pathways generated by PathSys for (b1) Pheromone response, (b2) Cell Wall
  modeling and (b3) Filamentation of MAPK signaling pathways, with the proteins as
  red ovals, complexes as blue ovals; processes (binary and multiple) and interaction
  types as small colored circles, squares, diamonds, etc.; pathways (Cell Cycle pathway)
  as yellow triangles, compartments as grey boxes. Network graphs are produced by
  BiologicalNetworks client software.
