caption: The MAPK family with its classical cascades, the ERK 1 and 2,p38 and JNK.
  (A) The MAPK family of signalling pathways is characterized by a central motif of
  three kinases, which activate each other in a sequential order by phosphorylation
  of specific residues. Classically, 3 distinct pathways are included in the MAPK
  family (the ERK 1 and 2, p38 and JNK),the activation of which leads to different
  cellular outcomes. (B) The activation of the ERK pathway depends on a variety of
  membrane bound receptors,including growth factor receptors, G protein coupled receptors
  (GPCRs), the estrogen receptor and ionic channels. In some cases, binding of certain
  cytokines to their specific receptor may also lead to the activation of this pathway.
  Once active (that is, phosphorylated) ERK can target a variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic
  elements.
