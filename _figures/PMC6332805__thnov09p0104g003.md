caption: Selective Autophagy degrades cell cycle proteins. (A) Selective autophagy,
  cooperated with UPS, acts as an on-off switch of cell cycle progression via controlling
  the stability of several cell cycle regulators. Selective macroautophagy receptor
  p62 selectively recognizes CDK1, cyclin D1 and p27 (not shown), recruits them into
  autophagosome through its interaction with LC3. In contrast, CHK1 and RND3 are degraded
  via CMA pathway. Green ovals denote ubiquitin ligases. (B) Hif-1α undergoes lysosomal
  degradation through its interaction with HSC70, LAMP2 and STUB1. p62-mediated recognition
  also promotes Hif-1α degradation in selective macroautophagy. (C) Cell cycle-related
  degradation of Hif-1α. Hypoxia prevents the VHL-mediated proteasomal degradation
  of Hif-1α, resulting elevated levels of Hif-1α and subsequent cell cycle arrest
  at G1/S phase. CDK2 physically interacts with Hif-1α and promotes its degradation
  whereas CDK1 protects HIF-1α from lysosomal degradation through unclarified mechanism.
