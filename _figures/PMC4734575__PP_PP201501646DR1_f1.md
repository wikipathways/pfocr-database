caption: Metabolic pathways leading to volatile C6-C1, C6-C2, and C6-C3 compounds
  in petunia petals. The phenylpropene pathway is shaded gray, and the CCoAOMT reaction
  is illustrated in boldface letters. 4-Coumaryl-CoA is the precursor for flavonoid/anthocyanin
  biosynthesis. Solid arrows indicate established biochemical steps, while broken
  arrows represent hypothetical steps. Stacked arrows illustrate the involvement of
  multiple enzymatic reactions. 4CL, 4-Coumarate-CoA ligase; BPBT, benzoyl-CoA:benzyl
  alcohol/phenylethanol benzoyltransferase; BSMT, S-adenosyl-l-Met:benzoic acid/salicylic
  acid methyltransferase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydrolase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase;
  CFAT, coniferylalcohol acetyltransferase; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase; EGS, eugenol
  synthase; IGS, isoeugenol synthase; PAAS, phenylacetaldehyde synthase.
