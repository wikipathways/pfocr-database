caption: A scheme of host genes that may mediate recessive and dominant resistance
  and an explanation of the R protein-mediated signaling pathway. (A) Recessive resistance
  results from a host factor, the loss or mutation of which causes an incompatible
  interaction between a viral protein and a host protein. (B) Dominant resistance
  results from a compatible interaction between a viral effector and plant R proteins.
  Pvr9-mediated hypersensitive response requires several proteins, like NDR1 and the
  SGT1-HSP90 complex. Pvr9-mediated HR might also involve the SA pathway. NBS, nucleotide-binding
  site; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; CC, coiled-coil motif; HR, hypersensitive response;
  SA, salicylic acid.
