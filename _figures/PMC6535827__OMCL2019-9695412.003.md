caption: Neuroprotective effects of resveratrol in AD. The precursor of amyloid protein
  APP is cleaved sequentially by β- and γ-secretases leading to the production of
  Aβ and their aggregation. Resveratrol increases the clearance of Aβ peptides through
  the activation of AMPK. Resveratrol plays an important role in the neuroprotective
  properties as it reduces Aβ neurotoxicity by phosphorylating PKC-δ. Damaged mitochondria
  generate ROS which are implicated in apoptosis. iNOS and COX-2 also enhance the
  production of ROS. Resveratrol exerts antioxidant properties and attenuates oxidative
  damage by decreasing iNOS and COX-2 levels. Resveratrol also protects mitochondria
  by increasing the expression of ROS-inactivating enzymes GPx1 as well as SOD1 and
  by reducing the expression of the ROS-producing enzyme Nox4. Resveratrol also influences
  the Aβ-induced apoptotic signalling pathway by inhibiting the expression of caspace-3,
  Bax, FOXO, and p53 by blocking the activation of JNK and by restoring the decrease
  of Bcl-2 expression, as well as by inhibiting the increase of NF-κB DNA binding.
  Mitochondrial biogenesis is induced by resveratrol through SIRT1 activation and
  deacetylation of PGC-1α. Resveratrol was also able to protect hippocampal neurons
  by alleviating cognitive impairment and reducing neuronal loss via modulating the
  janus kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and signal transducers, as
  well as the signalling pathway of the activators of transcription (JAK/ERK/STAT).
