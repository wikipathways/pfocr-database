caption: 'HFD activates genes involved in inflammation and tumorigenesis. (A) Heatmap
  gene analysis of the transcripts significantly elevated in HFD colon and tumors
  (RD and HFD) indicated leptin and Wnt as the top expressed genes (FDR < 0.05, IPA).
  (B) qPCR confirmed upregulation of leptin and Wnt expression from colon and tumors
  of mice on RD and HFD (n = 3, *P < 0.05 relative to RD colon). (C) Pathway analysis
  of differentially expressed transcripts from HFD colon or tumors indicated that
  additional dysregulated transcripts were connected with leptin and with Wnt (activation
  color score: red: ↑ expression, green: ↓ expression) (FDR < 0.05, IPA). (D) Alterations
  in expression of leptin pathway members: leptin (LEP), leptin receptor (LEPR), janus
  kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in
  human colorectal cancer. Individual genes are represented as rows, whereas individual
  colon cancer cases are shown as columns (cBioPortal.org). (E) Network analysis indicated
  additional transcripts associated with leptin signaling as consistently upregulated
  in human colon cancer patients (cbioportal.org). (F) Survival analysis of colon
  cancer patients with leptin pathway alterations (cbioportal.org).'
