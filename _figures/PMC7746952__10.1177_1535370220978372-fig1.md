caption: PAR1 functions in thrombotic and inflammatory processes in the vascular endothelium.
  (a) PAR1 activation by thrombin and factors VIIa and Xa induces an intracellular
  response in endothelial cells and platelets through the ERK1/2 on the canonical
  pathway, producing a series of proinflammatory and prothrombotic mediators such
  as P-selectin and vWF that lead simultaneously to thrombosis and tissue inflammation
  in a crosslink process. (b) PAR1 therapeutic blockage through Vorapaxar® and/or
  modulation via APC-induced activation produces a non-canonical pathway signaling
  which impairs inflammatory and prothrombotic endothelial outcomes. Moreover, APC
  directly participates in the anticoagulatory processes by binding to protein S,
  further inactivating TF, Va, and VIIIa. (A color version of this figure is available
  in the online journal.)
