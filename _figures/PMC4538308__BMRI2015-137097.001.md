caption: Schematic illustration of the mechanism by which DHA may interfere with the
  molecular signalling by activating glycolytic phenotype. The PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway
  promotes the glycolytic phenotype, principally activating the transcription factor
  HIF-1α. HIF-1α is activated also by hypoxia, as well as by mutations of its regulator
  VHL. The accumulation of HIF-1α in the cytosol determines its heterodimerization
  with the subunit HIF-1β, forming the active HIF-1 complex. HIF-1 upregulates a wide
  network of genes by binding to hypoxia response elements (HRE). DHA interferes at
  various sites of this pathway, and then it is able to attenuate bioenergetic function
  and Warburg metabolism. DHA treatment increases the LKB1 protein expression and
  AMP cytosolic levels, necessary events to activate the AMPK pathway. Active AMPK
  inhibits mTORC1 signalling, via phosphorylation of TSC protein. Moreover, DHA alters
  cancer cell metabolism by interfering with the processes implicated in the stabilization
  of HIF-1α. Indeed, the reduction of cytosolic ATP levels induced by DHA prevents
  the proper functioning of HSP90, molecular chaperon necessary for folding of HIF-1α.
  Moreover, DHA destabilizes HIF-1α promoting its proteolytic degradation via PPARα
  activation.
