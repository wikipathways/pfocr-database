caption: De novo nucleotide synthesis pathways. (A) De novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway
  produces UMP via six steps catalyzed by three enzymes and is further processed to
  UTP, CTP, or dTMP. (B) De novo purine synthesis pathway produces IMP via ten steps
  catalyzed by six enzymes. IMP is further processed to AMP or GMP through two more
  steps. (C) Purine salvage synthesis utilizes adenine (Ade), hypoxanthine (Hx), or
  guanine (Gua) to generate phosphorylated nucleotides in a single step. Enzymes noted
  in pink while small molecules are in black.
