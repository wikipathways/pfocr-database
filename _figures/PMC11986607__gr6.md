caption: Important KEGG pathways for DEGs enrichment between treated (linalool-treated
  group) and control (not linalool-treated) groups. (A) C5-Branched dibasic acid metabolism
  pathway. (B) Valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis pathway. Up-regulated
  genes were indicated by red arrows and down-regulated genes by blue arrows. Square
  heat maps showed the expression of the relevant DEGs
