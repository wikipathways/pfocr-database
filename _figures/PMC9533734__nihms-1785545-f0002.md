caption: Glucose enters the brain cell via glucose transporters (GLUT) and enters
  the glycolytic pathway to produce pyruvate which is converted to acetyl coenzyme
  A (Acetyl-CoA) as mitochondrial fuel. The pentose-phosphate pathway metabolizes
  Glc-6-P produced in glycolysis and utilizes the glutathione pathway to mitigate
  oxidative stress (see details in []). NADH oxidase (NOX), a major contributor to
  oxidative stress, can be activated in neurons (and potentially astrocytes) by NMDA
  receptors as well as by amyloid-β (Aβ1–42). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) depress
  glycolysis via inhibition of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and
  via overactivation of Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) (discussed in [,]).Nuclear
  factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response elements (ARE) signaling
  regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins. Exogenous pyruvate and ketones
  (e.g. β-hydroxybutyrate, BHB) enter the cell via monocarboxylate transporters (MCT).
  Both substrates can substitute glucose for mitochondria fueling, and in addition,
  in pathological conditions pyruvate restores depressed glycolysis and prevents overactivation
  of PARP-1, while the ketogenic diet activates the Nrf2 pathway.Figure created with
