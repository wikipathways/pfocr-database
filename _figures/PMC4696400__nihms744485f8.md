caption: A working model for PQ-induced lung fibrosis and protection by Res through
  Nrf2. Within lung cells, PQ undergoes one-electron redox cycling, leading to the
  production of PQ radicals and ROS (, H2O2, and -OH), and depletion of reducing equivalents
  (NADPH, GSH), both damaging the mitochondria and further increasing ROS production
  to result in a vicious cycle of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress and epithelial
  damage stimulate macrophages as well as epithelial and fibroblast cells to produce
  inflammatory and profibrogenic cytokines and growth factors to induce myofibroblast
  transformation and, ultimately, fibrosis. Res inhibits both the oxidative damage
  and fibrogenic reactions by PQ. Nrf2 is required for both defense against PQ oxidative
  and fibrogenic toxicity in normal cells and protection by Res against PQ through
  upregulating cytoprotective gene expression.
