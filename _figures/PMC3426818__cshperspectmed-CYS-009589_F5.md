caption: MUC5B gene expression is transcriptionally regulated by various mediators
  and pathways. (Red) IL1β and IL17A induce MUC5B gene expression by activation of
  the NFκB cis-site at −2921/−2909 bp in the MUC5B promoter. Direct binding of the
  NFκB p50 subunit was observed by ChIP in HBE1 cells (). (Orange) PMA activates PKCδ,
  which signals through Ras to activate MEKK1, which then signals through either a
  p38 pathway or the JNK pathway to phosphorylate Sp1, which binds to the Sp1 site
  at −184/−196. The Sp1 cis-site (−144/−122) functions to maintain basal regulation
  of MUC5B in differentiated HBE cells and in HBE1 cells (). (Purple) NRG1β1 increases
  MUC5B gene expression in differentiated HBE cells by signaling through the ErbB2/ErbB3
  heterodimer receptor, which then signals through three different pathways including
  p38, ERK1/2, and PI3k. PI3k goes on to activate Akt ().
