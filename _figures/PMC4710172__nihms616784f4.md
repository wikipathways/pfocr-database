caption: Inhibition of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway at multiple levels. Increase in
  intra-cellular calcium levels causes calmodulin (CaM) and calcineurin B (CnB) to
  bind Ca+2 ions and activate calcineurin via a conformational change. Activated calcineurin
  binds to NFAT via the PxIxIT and the LxVP motifs of NFAT and dephosphorylates it.
  Dephosphorylation unmasks the nuclear localization sequence of NFAT. Then NFAT is
  translocated into the nucleus, where it is transactivated in co-operation with other
  transcription factors (TF). Different steps in this pathway are targeted by certain
  compounds to finally suppress NFAT-dependent gene expression. Some prototype inhibitors
  of calcineurin-NFAT signaling axis are depicted. Dicholoroacetate (DCA) decreases
  mitochondrial membrane potential to cause translocation of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) translocation to cytoplasm. Cytosolic ROS activates Kv1.5 potassium ion channels,
  preventing intracellular calcium entry through VGC. CsA, Tacrolimus, and ISA247
  inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity. ST-1959 increases nuclear export of NFAT.
  Genistein reduces mRNA and protein expressions of NFAT1. CnA, calcineurin A; SOC,
  store-operated calcium channels; TCR, T cell receptor; VGC, voltage gated calcium
  channels.
