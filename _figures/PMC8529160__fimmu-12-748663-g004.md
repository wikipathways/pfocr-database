caption: 'Neuroinflammation downstream of IL-6 in stroke. IL-6 binds its receptor
  and proceeds two separate but related pathways: the classical and trans-signaling
  pathways. The classical pathway begins when IL-6 binds with IL-6R-α chain subunit
  assisted by gp130, an intra-cellular signal transducer. This binding allows intracellular,
  receptor-associated JAKs to phosphorylate each other on respective tyrosine domains.
  Phosphorylated JAKs further phosphorylate related tyrosine residues on the receptor,
  creating binding sites for proteins possessing SH2 domains. Cytoplasmic STATs then
  bind to these SH2 domains to be phosphorylated by respective JAKs, making them dissociate
  from the receptor. The dissociated STATs form dimers, which act as transcription
  factors. The dimers translocate to the cell nucleus to induce gene expression for
  subsequent protein signaling outcomes. STATs may also be tyrosine-phosphorylated
  directly by receptor tyrosine kinases - but since most receptors lack built-in kinase
  activity, JAKs are usually required for signaling. The trans-signaling pathway begins
  when IL-6 ligands with sIL-6R-α in the extracellular matrix. The high affinity drives
  this complex to bind with gp130 expressed overly on glial and neuronal cells following
  ischemic insult. This trio-binding results in the activation of intracellular tyrosine-associated
  JAKs. Phosphorylated tyrosine-sited allow the adaptor proteins (SoS and Grb-2) to
  bind and convert inactive cytoplasmic RAS to an active one, initiating a series
  of phosphorylations of a variety of molecules like Raf, MEK, and ERK. The activated
  ERK acts as a transcriptional factor. It enters the nucleus to express targeted
  genes for inflammatory protein signaling.'
