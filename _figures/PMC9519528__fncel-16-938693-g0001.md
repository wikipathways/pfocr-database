caption: Sphingolipid biosynthetic and degradative pathways. Sphingolipid biosynthesis
  is initiated by the multi-subunit enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) which
  catalyzes the condensation of serine and palymitoyl CoA to form 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine
  (3-keto-DHS). The reduction of 3-keto-DHS by 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase
  (KDSR) results in formation of the long chain amino base, dihydrosphingosine (DHS),
  which is subsequently acylated at its free amino group by one of five ceramide synthases
  (CerS), forming dihydroceramide (DH-Cer). The reversibility of this and subsequent
  steps is indicated by a dotted line and arrow. Alternatively, DHS can be directly
  phosphorylated to DHS1P by sphingosine kinases (SK) in the degradative pathway,
  as indicated by the long dashed line and arrow. The delta 4-desaturase (DES) encoded
  by DEGS1 then introduces a double bond into the DHS backbone, forming ceramide,
  the central building block of all sphingolipids. From ceramide, there are three
  possible directions, namely biosynthesis of sphingomyelin and glycosyl sphingolipids,
  phosphorylation, or degradation. Ceramide can be modified by addition of a phosphocholine
  group at the C1 position by sphingomyelin synthase, yielding sphingomyelin (SM).
  It can be glycosylated with either a glucose or galactose moiety to form glucosylceramides
  or galactosylceramides, followed by subsequent addition of sugars to form the complex
  array of glycolipids, the glycosylated sphingolipids. Each of these steps is reversible,
  thus routing higher order sphingolipids into the degradative pathway. Ceramide can
  be phosphorylated to the bioactive lipid ceramide-1-phosphate (Cer-1-P) by ceramide
  kinase (CerK), a step that can be reversed by ceramide phosphate phosphatase (C1PP).
  Alternatively, ceramide can enter the common degradative pathway that breaks down
  sphingolipids derived from de novo biosynthesis and from the recycling of higher
  order sphingolipids. The degradative pathway begins with ceramide being deacylated
  by ceramidase (Cer’ase), generating sphingosine. Sphingosine may be reutilized by
  CerS to regenerate ceramide in the salvage pathway, or it may continue through the
  degradative pathway, being phosphorylated by SK, generating the bioactive sphingolipid
  S1P. S1P can activate its five cognate G protein-coupled receptors (S1P1-S1P5).
  Sphingosine can be regenerated from S1P by S1P-specific phosphatases (SGPP) and
  nonspecific lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPP). Ultimately, all cellular S1P and
  DHS1P is irreversibly cleaved by sphingosine phosphate lyase (SPL), yielding two
  nonsphingolipid products, the long chain aldehyde hexadecenal (or hexadecanal, if
  DHS1P is the substrate) and phosphoethanolamine (PE).
