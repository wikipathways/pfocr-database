caption: Model of LTA causes mammary gland injury in dairy cows. Analysis of the structure
  of LTA on the left side. LTAs are mainly composed of poly (GroP) chains, which are
  connected to the bacterial membrane via a glycolipid anchor. Glc2-DAG is synthesized
  by the YpfP enzyme and transferred to the outside of the membrane by the LtaA enzyme.
  Then, Glc2-DAG uses lipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG) as a substrate to repeatedly
  add GroP residues to the end of the growing chain through the LtaS enzyme to produce
  polyglycerol phosphate chains. The right picture shows that after LTA enters the
  cell, it invades the cell in the form of vesicles, passes through the ER to be processed
  in the nucleus, and triggers an inflammatory response, releasing the inflammatory
  factors IL-1β, TNF-α, and PTGS2. Inflammatory factors act on the endoplasmic reticulum,
  affecting the steroid synthesis pathway by reducing the expression of SREBF2 and
  FASN, and decreasing milk quality. At the same time, LTA-induced elevation of PTGS2
  and GRP78 leads to ER stress and activates the expression of related factors such
  as PERK and ATF6, which trigger an apoptotic cascade with a decrease in Bcl-2 expression
  and an increase in caspase expression, leading to cell apoptosis
