caption: 'Flux of Se compounds from plants to humans. Top: metabolic pathway of Se
  in plants. Bottom: assimilation of Se compounds in human cells and specific mechanism
  of SeCys insertion in selenoproteins. In blue are compounds produced by all plants,
  in green are those specifically produced by Se-hyperaccumulators and in yellow are
  those generated in plant species belonging to Brassicaceae, Capparidaceae, and Euphorbiaceae
  families. Enzymes are indicated in red. All acronimous are given in the text.'
