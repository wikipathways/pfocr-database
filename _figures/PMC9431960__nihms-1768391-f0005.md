caption: a, Control experiments revealed that borylation likely occurs, affording
  observed intermediate 11g’, prior to C=C bond migration. b, A tentative mechanistic
  pathway involving formation of a putative nickel-boryl species IX to promote boryl-Heck
  reaction. Under typical circumstances where catalytic amounts of LiOt-Bu were used,
  DMPU likely served as a hydride acceptor to afford the corresponding Ni-alkoxide
  VIII and turn over the catalytic cycle. In other instances, more base might be needed
  to regenerate the active Ni-tert-butoxide species (VIII, R = t-Bu). G, functional
  group; pin, pinacolato; DMPU, N,N’-dimethylpropyleneurea; IPr, 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene.
