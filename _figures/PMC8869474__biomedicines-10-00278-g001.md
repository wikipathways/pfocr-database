caption: The chosen candidate genes’ involvement in the vitamin D cascade are displayed.
  Vitamin D is mostly obtained through sunlight or food sources in humans. UVB light
  from the sun penetrates the skin and converts 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) to pre-vitamin
  D, which is rapidly transformed to vitamin D. DHCR7/NADSYN1 removes 7DHC from the
  vitamin D pathway. D is hydroxylated in the liver to 25(OH)D3, primarily by CYP2R1.
  Following that, 25(OH)D is delivered to the kidney by vitamin D binding protein
  (VDBP), which is encoded by GC, where it is converted by CYP27B1 to its active form,
  1,25(OH)2D. Finally, CYP24A1 catabolizes both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D to calcitroic
  acid, which is physiologically inactive and water soluble. The active form of vitamin
  D bound to VDBP is delivered in blood to its target cells, where it acts as a ligand
  for the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a nuclear transcription factor that regulates
  transcription and translation of messenger RNA, leading to the synthesis of vitamin
  D-dependent proteins.
