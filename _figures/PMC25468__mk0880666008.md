caption: 'Model of the Dpp signaling pathway: cascades of phosphorylation and dynamic
  rearrangement of protein interactions. Dpp induces hetero-oligomerization of Punt
  and Tkv. Punt activates Tkv by transphosphorylating the juxtamembrane region. Activated
  Tkv phosphorylates Mad. Mad forms homo-oligomeric complexes and/or hetero-oligomeric
  complexes with Medea. It is not known whether Mad homo-oligomers have specific activity
  in vivo. Hetero-oligomers of Mad and Medea translocate into the nucleus where they
  transactivate target genes such as vestigial. Dad is one such target, and its expression
  is induced by Dpp. Dad stably binds to Tkv and interrupts phosphorylation of Mad
  by Tkv. The numbers of each Smad molecule in the homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes
  remain to be determined.'
