caption: 'In addition to glycolysis, glycogen synthesis and pentose phosphate pathway,
  glucose metabolism generates UDP-GlcNAc via the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway
  (HBP). The HBP utilizes a series of enzymes and substrates, which integrates glucose
  metabolism to amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism.
  Dynamically regulated by the two enzymes, OGT and OGA, that catalyze the addition
  and removal of GlcNAc moiety on proteins respectively, O-GlcNAcylation affects a
  variety of cellular functions under physiological and pathological conditions. (HK:
