caption: TCR-signaling and co-stimulatory pathways affected in AITL. Peptides/antigens
  bind to the MHC-class molecules and engage the TCR. The TCR signaling strength depends
  on the co-stimulatory molecules, e.g., CD28 or CTLA-4. This is followed by a series
  of events leading to the phosphorylation of the different components of the TCR
  complex. Genes mutated in the TCR-signaling pathway in AITL are indicated in red
  and mostly lead to antigen-independent hyper-activation of TCR signaling. Aberrant
  fusion proteins of the TCR signaling pathway are often encountered in AITL and are
  indicated in the box. Figure generated by Biorender.com.
