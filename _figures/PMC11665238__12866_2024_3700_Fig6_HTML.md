caption: Functions of 16 differentially expressed genes and corresponding pathways.
  (A) Arginine and proline metabolism; (B) phosphotransferase system; (C) glycolysis/gluconeogenesis;
  (D) starch and sucrose metabolism; (E) oxidative phosphorylation; (F) nitrogen metabolism;
  (G) biosynthesis of secondary metabolites; (H) porphyrin metabolism; (I) degradation
  of aromatic compounds; (J) 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism. The expression of differentially
  expressed genes is represented by a heatmap; each column in the figure represents
  a sample, and different colours represent different amounts of expression of genes
  in the sample, with blue representing downregulation and red representing upregulation
