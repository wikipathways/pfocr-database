caption: GPA-12 is a fourth G-protein pathway acting through RHGF-1 and RHO-1 to regulate
  ACh release in C. elegans cholinergic motor neurons. Our data suggest that GPA-12
  (Gα12) acts within motor neurons to stimulate ACh release as do EGL-30 (Gαq) and
  GSA-1 (Gαs) (underlined), whereas GOA-1 (Gαo) acts to inhibit release (shaded).
  EGL-30, GOA-1, and GPA-12 pathways converge to regulate levels of diacylglycerol
  (DAG), GSA-1 appears to act downstream of DAG. DAG recruits UNC-13 to release sites
  and the accumulation of UNC-13 at release sites correlates with increases in ACh
  release. RHO-1 is also able to increase ACh release by inhibiting DGK-1 and by a
  second presynaptic pathway independent of DGK-1 inhibition and of DAG binding to
  UNC-13. The UNC-13-independent pathway is not activated by GPA-12, suggesting two
  distinct pools of RHO-1 may exist. This model is derived from data from the following
  papers (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ).
