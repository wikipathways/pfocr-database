caption: Illustration of molecular mechanisms involved in response to compound 7b
  treatment in HCC cell lines. 7b blocks cell proliferation through induction of ROS
  accumulation and JNK pathway activation which further stimulates transcription of
  genes related to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. As a result, G2/M arrest (through
  the regulatory effect of p53 and p21), and apoptosis (through intrinsic pathway)
  are observed. 7b is also a potent compound acting on cancer stemness and migration
  capacity of HCC cell lines. This figure was created with BioRender.com.
