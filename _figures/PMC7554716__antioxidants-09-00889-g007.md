caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed pathway by which exercise regulates plasma
  bilirubin levels. Exercise upregulates hepatic biliverdin reductase-A (BVRA) and
  suppresses UDP Glucuronosyltransferase Family 1 Member A1 (UGT1A1) resulting in
  increased plasma levels of bilirubin. Bilirubin then activates hepatic peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) and its target genes to enhance glycogen
  synthesis and mitochondrial β-oxidation.
