caption: The proposed mechanism for the activation of the NRF2-mediated oxidative
  stress pathway in response to PFESA-BP2 exposure at all tested concentrations [49].
  The interaction of PFESA-BP2 molecules with membrane-bound NADPH oxidase might have
  increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The elevation in ROS levels
  might have activated NRF2-mediated oxidative stress, resulting in the overexpression
  of NQO1 (as indicated in green). This response facilitates the neutralization of
  ROS and oxidative damage repair
