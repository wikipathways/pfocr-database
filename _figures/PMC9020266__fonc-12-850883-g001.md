caption: 'The two major pathways of DNA double-strand break repair: During NHEJ, the
  DNA double strand sites are initially recognized by heterodimeric Ku70/80. This
  is followed by recruitment of DNA-PKcs and Artemis, DNA end processing by Artemis,
  polymerase λ and μ, TDP and PNKP and finally ligation of DSB breaks by Ligase IV/XRCC4/XLF
  complex for completion of the repair pathway. The other accessory proteins like
  APLF, PAXX and XLF also participate in the repair functions. During HDR/HR, DSBs
  are recognized and resected by the MRN complex to generate a 3’ overhang. BRCA2/RAD51,
  along with other RAD51 paralogs, binds to the RPA coated ssDNA tails after which
  RAD51 replaces RPA in a BRCA1-and BRCA2-dependent process, forming a presynaptic
  filament. Upon strand invasion, D-loop formation and DNA repair synthesis can be
  resolved through Holliday junction, after which distinct independent pathways can
  operate to complete the HDR repair pathway. NHEJ is available throughout interphase
  while HDR is restricted to S/G2 phases of the cell cycle.'
