caption: 'Platelet-derived growth factor-β (PDGF-β)-activated pathways mediating vascular
  smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration. After platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β
  (PDGF-R ββ ) activation, NADPH oxidase-1 (Nox1)-released peroxide (H2O2) activates
  Slingshot1L (SSLH1) and LIM kinase (LIMK), cofilin phosphatase and kinase, respectively.
  The net result is cofilin.dephosphorylation leading to actin reorganization and
  ultimately migration. Furthermore, PDGF-induced H2O2 activates the Src/ (phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase-1) PDK1/ (p21-activated protein kinase) PAK1 signaling pathway mediating
  VSMC migration. Additionally, Src activation increases L-type voltage-dependent
  calcium channel (CaV1.2) activity leading to increased intracellular calcium (Ca2+)
  concentration, and consequently VSMC migration. In addition, ERK1/2, JNK and p38
  mediate PDGF-induced migration. Whether the activation of these MAPKs is ROS-dependent
  is yet to be determined. Figure key: arrow: activation, question mark: potential
  crosstalk.'
