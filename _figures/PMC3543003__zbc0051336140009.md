caption: Theoretical model of the dual function of PAK in regulating intestinal smooth
  muscle myosin light chain phosphorylation. A, under physiologic conditions, PAK
  positively regulates MLC phosphorylation through phosphorylation of MYPT1 at the
  Thr-696 site. B, under pathologic conditions, overstimulated PAK switches its signaling
  to a different pathway, which negatively regulates MLC phosphorylation via decreased
  MYPT1 phosphorylation at both the Thr-696 and Thr-853 sites.
