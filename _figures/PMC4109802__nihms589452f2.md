caption: Activation of FGFR leads to enhanced CD200 expression, which leads to subsequent
  activation of anti-inflammatory pathways via microglial CD200 receptor (CD200R)
  activation. This pathway may be disturbed in AD patients due to CD200 decrease by
  amyloid-β (Aβ), pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), or damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) recognized by microglia, leading to neuroinflammation-induced
  suppression of LTP, synaptic transmission and neuronal viability in AD brain.
