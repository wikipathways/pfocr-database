caption: '(A) Structure of dihydrosphingosine, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and inositol
  phosphorylceramide (IPC). The sugar and the long-chain base in GlcCer are highlighted
  in green and blue, respectively. The C8-unsaturation and C9-methyl group, present
  in the fungal but not in the mammalian GlcCer, are shown in gray. (B) The sphingolipid
  synthesis pathway in fungi. Inhibitors of SL production are highlighted in red and
  include: myriocin (targets Spt); fumonisin B1 and australifungin (targets ceramide
  synthases); aureobasidin A, khafrefungin and galbonolide A (targets the Ipc synthase);
  PDMP analogs and acylhydrazones (targets GlcCer synthase).'
