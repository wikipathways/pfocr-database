caption: Key elements of RANK signaling. Receptor ligation is followed by recruitment
  of adaptor molecules, including TRAF6, which, interacting with c-src, stimulates
  the PI-3 K/Akt pathway. The TRAF proteins that activate MEK and TAK have not been
  identified conclusively, but these kinases initiate signaling cascades that activate
  AP-1 transcription factors (consisting of c-fFos and c-jun) and promote the proteasomal
  degradation of the NFκB inhibitor IκB. Akt plays a role in phosphorylation of the
  IKK complex (). AP-1 and NFκB serve as key activators of osteoclast formation and
  function.
