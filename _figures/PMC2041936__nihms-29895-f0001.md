caption: Newly synthesized GLUT4 traffic through a GGA-dependent and trans-Golgi Network
  (TGN) sorting into the insulin-responsive storage compartment (IRC). In the basal
  state, GLUT4 is mainly sequestered into the IRC and translocates to the plasma membrane
  (PM) after insulin stimulation. Exit from the IRC is prevented by AS160 that function
  to maintain a putative Rab in an inactive state (left). However, following insulin
  stimulation, AS160 is phosphorylated and inactivated by Akt-dependent phosphorylation
  (right). Several Rab proteins and effectors that have been implicated endocytosis
  (Rab4 and 5), recycling back and forth between endosome and TGN (Rabip4/Rab4, Rab11
  and 14) are indicated.
