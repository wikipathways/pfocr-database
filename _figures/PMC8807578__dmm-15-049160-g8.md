caption: Intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of PG growth and developmental timing
  by JAK/STAT. Schematic model of the function of JAK/STAT signaling in the PG. Intrinsic
  expression of Upd3 in the PG activates basal levels of JAK/STAT activity in an autocrine
  way. Basal JAK/STAT activity is required for correct development of the PG, its
  loss reducing PG size and slightly advancing the onset of metamorphosis (larva–pupa
  transition). Levels of JAK/STAT activity are controlled through SUMOylation, involving
  SUMO E3 ligase Su(var)2-10 (PIAS), thus preventing excessive pathway activation.
  In conditions producing tumors and tissue damage, Upd cytokines secreted from the
  damaged tissues and amplified by other tissues () activate JAK/STAT signaling in
  the PG, which increases expression of JAK/STAT targets Apontic and bantam, and differentially
  contributes to strong autophagy induction and inhibition of metamorphosis.
