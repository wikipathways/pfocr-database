caption: a Three reactions presumably catalyzed by CYP728B70 to convert miltiradiene
  to dehydroabietic acid. b Establishing the metabolic pathways in yeast for production
  of diterpene alcohols and acids. In module 1, rox1, ypl062w, yjl06w4 were knocked
  out, and ERG9 was down-regulated, and tHMG1, ERG20, BTS1, SaGGPPS were overexpressed
  to improve the production of GGPP. In module 2, double SmMS-SmCPS1 fusion modules
  were introduced into the yeast chromosome for the production of miltiradiene. Co-expression
  of TwCYP728B70 and TwCPR3 leads to the observed production of the derived alcohols
  and acids.
