caption: Pathway diagram for IL-2 family signaling showing the increase in detail
  level as zoom level increases. A, Lowest zoom level, with colored boxes enclosing
  shaded regions representing subpathway locations. B, Appearance of labels for molecular
  objects (eg, proteins and complexes). C, Fade-in appearance of trivial molecules
  and interactor labels (red circles). D, Display of interactors in radial layout
  around the pathway molecule. E, Three-dimensional structure appearance.
