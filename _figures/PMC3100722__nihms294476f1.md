caption: The neuroendocrine (a), limbic (b), and brainstem (c) inter-related, stress-activated
  corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) loops. (a) Stress-conveying signals rapidly
  activate immediate early genes in CRH-expressing neurons of the central nucleus
  of the amygdala (ACe). Rapid CRH release in the ACe is is thought to activate CRH
  expressing neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to secrete
  CRH into the hypothalamo-pituitary portal system, inducing ACTH and glucocorticoid
  secretion from the pituitary and adrenal, respectively. In response to stress, CRH
  expression is also activated rapidly in these neurons. Glucocorticoids exert a negative
  feedback on PVN (directly and via hippocampus), yet activate CRH gene expression
  in the amygdala, potentially promoting further CRH release in this region. (b) Stressors
  involving ‘psychological’ or multi-modal elements activate the limbic circuit. This
  consists of ACe, which conveys information both to the hypothalamus and to the hippocampal
  formation via pathways that likely do not utilize CRH as a neurotransmitter. Within
  the hippocampus, CRH-expressing GABAergic interneurons (in purple) in the principal
  cell layers of the hippocampal CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus (DG) are positioned
  to control information flow in the major, tri-synaptic hippocampal pathway. (c)
  Sensory information regarding physical, somatic and visceral elements of stress
  is conveyed from sensory organs via a neuroanatomically defined brainstem pathway.
  Within this general circuit, a chemically defined loop, utilizing CRH (or a similar
  ligand) as a neurotransmitter which activates the CRF2 receptor may be considered.
  This afferent pathway contributes to the integration of stress signals, resulting
  in behavioral and neuroendocrine responses. For panels (a) and (b), red and blue
  arrows denote established or putative potentiating and inhibitory actions, respectively.
  Thick arrows do not imply monosynaptic connections. For panel (c), blue frames indicate
  CRF2 mRNA expression. Red shading over a region indicates the presence of CRH-expressing
  neurons. Red arrows denote established CRH-containing pathways. CEA = ACe-bed nucleus
  of the stria terminalis continuum; NTS = nucleus of the solitary tract; PBN = parabrachial
  nucleus; SCN = suprachiasmatic hypothalamic nucleus; PVT = thalamic paraventricular
