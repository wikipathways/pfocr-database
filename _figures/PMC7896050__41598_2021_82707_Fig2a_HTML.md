caption: 'Clustering analysis and metabolic pathway mapping of lipid mediators in
  lung and plasma. (a) Clustering analysis in lung. A–D show specific clusters of
  lipid mediators that were altered by maoto (MT) relative to IVI. (b) Pathway mapping
  of lipid mediators in lung. Log2 fold changes (log2FC) in detected lipid mediators
  for IVI/NI (left column) and IVI + MT/IVI (right column) were mapped on the metabolic
  pathway. The percentage of increased or decreased lipid mediators for IVI/NI and
  IVI + MT/IVI is summarized in the table. (c) Clustering analysis in plasma. A–D
  show the specific cluster of lipid mediators that were altered by MT relative to
  IVI. (d) Pathway mapping of lipid mediators in plasma. The log2FC in detected lipid
  mediators for IVI/NI (left column) and IVI + MT/IVI (right column) were mapped on
  the metabolic pathway. To show the related pathway of specialized pro-resolving
  mediators (SPMs), undetected SPMs were included on the pathway as hexagons. The
  percentage of increased or decreased lipid mediators for IVI/NI and IVI + MT/IVI
  is summarized in the table. For clustering analysis, the data were normalized and
  standardized by autoscale for metabolites. Euclidean distance was used for the distance
  measure, and Ward’s method was used for the clustering algorithm. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01
