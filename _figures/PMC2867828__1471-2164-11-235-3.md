caption: Regulation of transcripts, proteins and metabolites of the polyamine biosynthetic
  pathway following cyclohexylamine inhibition. The relative expression (to untreated
  control samples) of each transcript and its encoding protein is indicated at each
  time point sampled. Increased/decreased levels of selected metabolites are indicated.
  Additionally, regulation of transcripts in purine metabolism and various methyltransferases
  are indicated.
