caption: The role of PDHC in the metabolism of sepsis. During the process of glycolysis,
  one molecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. Inactivation
  of PDHC results into anaerobic glycolysis, which is the primary metabolic pathway
  in sepsis. By contrast, activation of PDHC leads to pyruvate translocation to mitochondrial
  and the consequent acceleration of aerobic oxidation. A group of drugs that target
  PDHC activation, including dichloroacetate (DCA), thiamine, amrinone, ciprofloxacin,
  and TNF-binding protein (TNFbp), have been shown to ameliorate the symptoms of sepsis.
