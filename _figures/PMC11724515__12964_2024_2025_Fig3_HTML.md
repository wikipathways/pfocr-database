caption: 'Mechanisms by which the FTO and TBX15 genes regulate obesity and osteoporosis.
  Overexpression of SIRT6 down-regulates TNF-α, inhibits NF-κB activation, and decreases
  osteoclasts. FTO down-regulates Hspa1a through Hspa1a-NF-κB axis and reduces osteoclasts.
  FTO promotes BMSCs adipogenesis through demethylation of PPARγ mRNA. The overexpression
  of FTO inhibited the demethylation of Runx2 gene and hindered the osteogenic differentiation
  of BMSCs. SIRT1 inhibits the adipogenic differentiation of BMSC by acetylating PPARγ,
  and promotes the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by deacetylating Runx2. TBX15
  is involved in adrenergic signaling pathway to induce adipose tissue “browning”
  and up-regulate the number of MSCs, thereby regulating bone development. High levels
  of SIRT1 promote the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts, thereby affecting
  bone development. Abbreviation: Hspa1a, Heat Shock Protein Family A (Hsp70) Member
