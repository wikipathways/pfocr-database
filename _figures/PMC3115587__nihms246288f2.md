caption: A proposed pathway for cholesterol catabolism with relevant gene products
  has recently been published for the soil bacterium Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1 (Ref.
  ). M. tuberculosis possesses homologues for almost all of the genes involved in
  cholesterol degradation, several of which are important for intracellular growth.
  However, definitive M. tuberculosis use of cholesterol as a sole source of carbon
  and energy was reported only recently, and in this study radioactive labelling was
  used to demonstrate the differential fates of cholesterol carbons. A labelled side-chain
  carbon (shown in red) was incorporated into the virulence lipid phthiocerol dimycocerosate,
  presumably by conversion of side-chain-derived propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA,
  a precursor to phthiocerol dimycocerosate and other virulence lipids. Successive
  oxidation of the remaining side chain produces an acetyl-CoA and an additional propionyl-CoA
  moiety (not shown). Conversely, a labelled ring carbon (shown in green) was released
  as CO2, indicating that this carbon enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and
  is mineralized. Some aspects of M. tuberculosis cholesterol catabolism remain unclear,
  including the fates of the degradation product 9,17-dioxo-1,2,3,4,10,19-hexanorandrostan-5-oic
  acid (DOHNAA) and propionyl-CoA moieties produced through ring cleavage and successive
  side chain degradation.
