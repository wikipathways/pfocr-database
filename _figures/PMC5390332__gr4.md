caption: PRIP regulates thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Sympathetic nerve stimulation
  enhances receptor-mediated PKA activation in brown adipocytes. PKA induces UCP1
  activation through at least two pathways. (i) PKA facilitates the phosphorylation
  of HSL and perilipin, which promotes lipolysis. The resulting FFAs enhance UCP1
  enzymatic activation and Ucp1 gene expression through PPAR-mediated PGC1α activation
  (the pathway represented by the solid arrows). (ii) PKA also induces phosphorylation
  of CREB and p38 MAPK, which activate PGC1α and DIO2. Consequently, Ucp1 gene expression
  and activity are elevated. Prip gene ablation (dotted line) leads to elevation of
  HSL phosphorylation-mediated lipolytic cascades followed by FFA-mediated UCP1-induced
  heat production. CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; DIO2, type II iodothyronine
  5′-deiodinase; Encircled Ps, phosphoproteins; FFA, free fatty acid; HSL, hormone-sensitive
  lipase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; p38-MAPK, p38 mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; PGC1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1α; PPase,
  protein phosphatase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PRIP, phospholipase
  C-related catalytically inactive protein; TAG, triglyceride; UCP1, uncoupling protein
