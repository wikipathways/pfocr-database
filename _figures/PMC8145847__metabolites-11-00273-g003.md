caption: The replication cycle of HCV. Lipo-viral particle binds to the host cellular
  receptors such as LDLR, SRB1, CD81, claudin1 and others (please refer to the main
  text). Following attachment, the virus enters the target cell via clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis. Upon entry, HCV RNA is released into the cytoplasm and is directly
  translated via an IRES at the ER. A polyprotein precursor is then processed by both
  viral and host proteases. Non-structural viral proteins and host factors form a
  membranous web and replication complexes that are used for synthesis of multiple
  HCV RNA copies. Viral progenies are packed, forming nucleocapsid that is enriched
  by viral envelope glycoprotein. The access to the lipoprotein pathway provides conditions
  for incorporation of neutral lipids and apolipoproteins and formation of the mature
  lipo-viral particle released from hepatocytes by exocytosis.
