caption: MYC target genes in the polyamine pathway. Polyamines derive from the amino
  acid arginine through ornithine. Putrescine is the decarboxylation product of ornithine.
  S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) is decarboxylated by adenosylmethionine decarboxylase
  (AMD1). Decarboxylated SAM (dcSAM) is the propyl amine donor for the formation of
  spermidine by SRM. Spermidine is the substrate for the posttranslational modification,
  which converts a lysine residue to the novel amino acid hypusine in the eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) protein. Two unique chromosomal loci encode
  related forms of eIF5A (eIF5A1 and eIF5A2). MYC target genes in the polyamine pathway
  include ODC, AMD1, SRM, and eIF5A2. These genes may mediate MYC-dependent oncogenesis.
