caption: 'Schematic diagram of regulation of TRP channels by phospholipids and lipid
  rafts. TRP channels can be modulated by various phospholipids, including arachidonic
  acid (AA) generated by PLA2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and lipids
  in the lipid rafts. AA can be metabolized through 3 enzymatic pathways: 1) the cyclooxygenase
  (COX) pathway produces prostaglandins; 2) the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway yields
  monohydroxy compounds and leukotrienes; and 3) the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) epoxygenase
  pathway generates hydroxyleicosatetraenoic acids (HETES) and epoxyeicosatrienoic
  acids (EETs). PIP2 is a co-activator of many TRP channels. Diaglycerol (DAG) generated
  by hydrolyzing PIP2 via Gq-linked receptor stimulation activates TRPC3 and TRPC6.
  Lipid rafts are specific microdomains orchestrating various signaling pathways,
  including GPCR, ion channels, and caveolin-1 (endothelial cells), or caveolin-3
  (myocytes). Caveolae are a special type of lipid raft. Lipid rafts are enriched
  with cholesterol and sphingolipids. Disruption of lipid rafts by depletion of cholesterol
  or knockdown of caveolin alters TRP channel function within the rafts. Modified
  from Yue et al. ().'
