caption: 'Working model of EGFL6-mediated signaling, illustrating the coupling of
  angiogenesis and osteogenesis in the rat DO model. During the consolidation phase
  of bone remodeling, type H vessels form alongside newly developing bone and extend
  toward the distraction gap. In the bone marrow microenvironment, multiple cell types
  secrete angiogenic factors to support type H vessel formation. Osteoblast-lineage
  cells and ECs secrete VEGF-A. EGFL6 secreted by osteoblasts enhances VEGF-A expression
  in ECs to promote cell migration, tube formation, and branching, which further stimulates
  the formation of type H vessels during early consolidation phase. As a key regulatory
  factor, EGFL6 also promotes osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblast-lineage
  cells, activated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. EGFL6 also increases expression
  of the osteogenic proteins RUNX2, BMP2, and OCN, leading to faster restoration of
  the bone defect in the DO model. Abbreviations: ECs, endothelial cells; BMSCs, bone
  marrow mesenchymal stem cells; EGFL6, epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing
  protein 6; VEGF-A, vascular endothelial growth factor; RUNX2, Runt-related transcription
  factor 2; BMP2, bone morphogenetic protein 2; OCN, osteocalcin'
