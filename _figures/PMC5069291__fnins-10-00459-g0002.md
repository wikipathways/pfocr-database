caption: A schematic model of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in Alzheimer disease. In
  AD, the “on state” of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is interrupted at two potential
  levels. Firstly, extracellular Aβ activates DKK1 which inhibits the interaction
  between Wnt and LRP 5/6. Binding of Wnt to Fzd is suppressed and Dsh dissociates
  from Fzd/Axin and migrates to the cytosol. The recruitment of the destruction complex
  to the plasma membrane is suppressed. Inactivation of Dsh leads to stimulation of
  GSK-3β. Thus, APC and AXIN interact with GSK-3β and beta-catenin (Wnt “off state”).
  Beta-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK-3β. The destruction complex AXIN/APC/GSK-3β
  is activated and enhances the destruction process of beta-catenin in the proteasome.
  Secondly, PPAR gamma which is activated by agonists can inhibit the beta-catenin/TCF/LEF
  complex in the nucleus, thus inhibiting the transcription of Wnt target genes. Amyloid
  precursor protein (APP) can be cut into various fragments by α, β, and γ secretases.
  PPAR α activates the transcription of α secretase. Abbreviations APC, adenomatous
  polyposis coli; Dsh, Disheveled; Fzd, Frizzled; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta;
  LRP5/6, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6; TCF/LEF, T-cell factor
  /lymphoid enhancer factor; sAPPα, soluble APPα ectodomain; sAPPβ, soluble APPβ ectodomain;
  APP, Amyloid precursor protein; α, β, and γ, α, β, and γ secretases; Aβ, amyloid
