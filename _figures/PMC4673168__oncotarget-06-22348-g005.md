caption: A. Class I pan-negative melanomas are primarily driven by the MAPK pathway
  and express generally robust levels of the ERK1/2 phosphatase, DUSP4, but have no
  endogenously active ERBB receptors. Class I melanomas behave similarly to BRAF V600-mutant
  melanomas in that they are highly sensitive to MEK1/2 inhibition. B. Class II pan-negative
  melanomas are activated by ERBB receptors, which activate both MAPK and PI3K/AKT
  signaling, making them less susceptible to MEK1/2 inhibition than Class I melanomas,
  but more susceptible to combined inhibition of ERBBs and MEK1/2. A potential mechanism
  for the ERBB activity in Class II's is the relative lack of DUSP4 expression, presumably
  allowing ERK1/2-mediated transcription of ERBB ligands such as amphiregulin (AREG).
  C. This pie chart displays the breakdown of driver events that sustain melanoma.
  Our study has shown that 4 pan-negative melanomas display ERBB activation (25%),
  but only 3 of those (18.8%) were sensitive to ERBB inhibition which can be extrapolated
  to ~6% of all melanomas.
