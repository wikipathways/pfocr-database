caption: The Ras/MAPK signaling cascade and small molecule inhibition. Ras genes exist
  as a multigene family that encodes small GTPases. Ras is a critical signaling hub
  in the cell that is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), G-protein-coupled
  receptors, cytokine receptors, and extracellular matrix receptors. Receptor activation
  recruits Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), an adaptor protein, which
  recruits Son-of-sevenless homolog (SOS1) and Shp2 (the protein product of PTPN11,
  which encodes a non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase). Ras activation results in the
  activation of Raf (BRAF, CRAF, ARAF), the first MAPK kinase of the cascade. Raf
  phosphorylates and activates MEK (MEK1 and MEK2), which in turn phosphorylates and
  activates ERK (ERK1 and ERK2). Phosphorylated ERK is the ultimate effector of the
  MAPK cascade and exerts its function on several downstream molecules. Feedback loops
  (solid lines) exist within the pathway whereby activated ERK can inhibit at the
  level of the receptor, SOS and Raf. Potential therapeutics for CS (caused by heterozygous
  activating missense HRAS mutations) and CFC (caused by heterozygous mutations in
  BRAF, MEK1, or MEK2) include FTIs, BRAF inhibitors, and MEK inhibitors (dashed lines;
  ).
