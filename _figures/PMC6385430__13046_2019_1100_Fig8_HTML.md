caption: LINC00968 was lowly expressed, whereas WNT2 was highly expressed in breast
  cancer tissues and cells. LINC00968 targeted and negatively regulated WNT2 via the
  transcriptional repressor HEY1. Overexpressed LINC00968 reduced drug resistance,
  migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells
  through inhibiting the activation of the Wnt2/β-catenin signaling pathway via suppression
  of WNT2

  cells through inhibiting the Wnt2/β-catenin signaling pathway by regulating WNT2.
