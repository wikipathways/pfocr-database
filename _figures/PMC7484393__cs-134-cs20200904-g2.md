caption: SARS-CoV-2 infection down-regulates ACE2 expression and leads to the production
  of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6 []. Angiotensin-I (Ang-I) is converted
  into Ang-II by the ACE in the extracellular space. ACE2 is able to further cleave
  Ang-II to Ang(1-7), which binds MasR receptors on the cell surface and promotes
  anti-inflammatory, vasodilation and anti-fibrotic effects []. Since ACE2 is down-regulated
  during viral infection, this event will lead to the accumulation of Ang-II and binding
  to AT1R receptors on cellular membrane. AT1R signals through JAK-STAT and induces
  fibrosis, pro-inflammatory gene expression and vasoconstriction [,]. Multiple organs
  express ACE2 and are target for SARS-CoV-2. As they lose ACE2-mediated protection,
  Ang-II signaling contributes to the pathological findings observed in COVID-19 patients,
  such as disseminated coagulopathy and acute tissue damage [].
