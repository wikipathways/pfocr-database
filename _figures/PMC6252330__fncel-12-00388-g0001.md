caption: Molecular mechanisms underlying entrance and quite G0-phase of cell cycle
  by cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). Conventional four phases of the cell cycle are
  regulated by a specific complex of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). The
  regulatory machinery of G1 progression overlaps with decision mechanism about the
  commitment to quiescence or proliferation. In case of GFs/mitogens availability,
  CDK4/6/cyclin D complex phosphorylates Rb causing E2F release, which in turn activates
  cyclin E. CDK2/cyclin E complex drives G1 to S phase transition. CDK4/6/cyclin D
  complex also removes p21 and p27 inhibition on CDK2. Cells in G1 phase can exit
  the cell cycle and enter G0 phase as quiescent, senescent, or differentiated cells.
  In case of nutrition withdraw or hypoxia, Rb renders E2F bound and as a result CDK2/cyclin
  E complex is inhibited by p21/p27. Alternatively, activation of non-canonical Wnt
  (ncWnt) signaling causes quiescence induction via Rho-GTPase/Cdc42 complex. PTEN
  causes G0 entrance by inhibiting CDK4/6/cyclin D complex or Akt pathway. As a result,
  cells are driven into quiescence. CDK3/cyclin C complex, Notch, canonical Wnt (cWnt)
  signaling, or Akt/mTORC1 pathway can drive cells to enter cell cycle again. In response
  to mTORC1 signaling, quiescent cells can transit into the GAlert phase and become
  poised for rapid cell cycle entry.

  description: Molecular mechanisms underlying entrance and quite G0-phase of cell
    cycle by cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). Conventional four phases of the cell cycle
    are regulated by a specific complex of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK).
    The regulatory machinery of G1 progression overlaps with decision mechanism about
    the commitment to quiescence or proliferation. In case of GFs/mitogens availability,
    CDK4/6/cyclin D complex phosphorylates Rb causing E2F release, which in turn activates
    cyclin E. CDK2/cyclin E complex drives G1 to S phase transition. CDK4/6/cyclin
    D complex also removes p21 and p27 inhibition on CDK2. Cells in G1 phase can exit
    the cell cycle and enter G0 phase as quiescent, senescent, or differentiated cells.
    In case of nutrition withdraw or hypoxia, Rb renders E2F bound and as a result
    CDK2/cyclin E complex is inhibited by p21/p27. Alternatively, activation of non-canonical
    Wnt (ncWnt) signaling causes quiescence induction via Rho-GTPase/Cdc42 complex.
    PTEN causes G0 entrance by inhibiting CDK4/6/cyclin D complex or Akt pathway.
    As a result, cells are driven into quiescence. CDK3/cyclin C complex, Notch, canonical
    Wnt (cWnt) signaling, or Akt/mTORC1 pathway can drive cells to enter cell cycle
