caption: 'Model of laminin-induced FGFR5 expression leading to enhanced beta-cell
  glucose metabolism. (A) Islet vasculature: Endothelial cells (ECs) and pericytes
  form the islet vasculature, and deposit and remodel islet basement membrane. Varied
  localization and/or phenotype of EC/pericytes establishes the beta-cell microenvironment.
  Our data show upregulation of beta-cell FGFR5 induced by binding to laminin matrix.
  (B) Heterocomplex formation: Upregulation of FGFR5 protein at the cell membrane
  results in formation of a 2:1 heterocomplex of FGFR5:FGFR1 previously shown to depend
  on the C-terminus of FGFR5. (C) Glycolysis and maturation: FGFR5/FGFR1 signaling
  induces expression of the functional maturity marker UCN3 as well as rate-limiting
  enzymes of glycolysis (PKM2, GCK). (D) Multiple studies done by our lab have now
  highlighted the role of ECM in regulating FGFR expression. Future studies will focus
  on examining the mechanism underlying this signaling pathway. (E) To develop this
  model in greater detail, future studies will also look at the signaling pathways
  underlying the intracellular transcriptional and metabolic changes we have observed
  with FGFR5 expression. (F) Lastly, more work must be done to understand how changes
  in the microenvironment impact beta-cells. This includes how ECM remodeling by ECs
  and pericytes affects beta-cell metabolism and maturity and the specific mechanisms
  of FGFR-regulated intracellular signaling. (Made in ©BioRender—biorender.com).'
