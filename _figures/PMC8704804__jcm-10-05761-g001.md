caption: Schematic representation of the L-arginine—dimethylarginine—nitric oxide
  pathway. L-arginine is the substrate for endothelial NO synthase and arginases,
  resulting in the formation of NO and L-citrulline or L-ornithine, respectively.
  L-arginine residues within specific proteins are subject to methylation by protein
  arginine N-methyltransferases (PRMTs). After protein hydrolysis, asymmetric (ADMA)
  and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) are released. ADMA is a competitive inhibitor
  of nitric oxide synthases (NOS). ADMA, but not SDMA, is degraded by dimethylarginine
  dimethylaminohydrolases (DDAH1 and DDAH2) into L-citrulline and dimethylamine (DMA).
  Both dimethylarginines may be cleaved by an alternative pathway through alanine
  glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2), resulting in the formation of symmetric or
  asymmetric dimethylguanidinovaleric acid (DMGV and DM’GV). Genes in which single
  nucleotide polymorphisms were studied in the present study are highlighted in red.
