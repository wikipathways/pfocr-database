caption: The canonical miRNA processing pathway includes the production of the primary
  miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA) by RNA polymerase II and cleavage of the pri-miRNA
  by the microprocessor complex Drosha in the nucleus. The resulting precursor hairpin,
  the pre-miRNA, is exported from the nucleus by Exportin-5. In the cytoplasm, the
  RNase Dicer cleaves the pre-miRNA hairpin to its mature length. The functional strand
  of the mature miRNA is loaded together with Argonaute (Ago2) proteins into the RNA-induced
  silencing complex (RISC), where it guides RISC to silence target mRNAs through mRNA
  cleavage, translational repression, whereas the passenger strand is degraded [].
