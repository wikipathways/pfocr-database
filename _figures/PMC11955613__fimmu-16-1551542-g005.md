caption: Pyroptotic osteocytes promote osteoclastogenesis. Osteocytes undergo pyroptosis
  by either canonical pathway or noncanonical pathway, both of which lead to the activation
  of GSDMD. GSDMD form pores in cell membrane, leading to cell membrane rupture and
  cell death. Pyroptotic osteocytes release pro-inflammatory cytokines, which act
  on immune cells to trigger the immune response and secretion of pro-osteoclastogenic
  cytokines. Additionally, pyroptotic osteocytes might release cellular contents (i.e.
  DAMPs) and thereby trigger the osteoclastogenesis. DAMPs, damage associated molecule
  patterns; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; PRRs, pattern recognition
  receptors; NLRP3, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family
  pyrin domain containing 3; ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing
  a CARD; casp, caspase; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; GSDMD, gasdermin
  D; RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand
