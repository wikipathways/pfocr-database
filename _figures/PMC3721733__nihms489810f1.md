caption: Therapeutic targeting of caspase activation signaling.Ligand binding to death
  receptors (extrinsic pathway) results in death initiation signaling complex activation
  and signaling through initiator caspase 8. Numerous external signals cause the cytochrome
  c release from mitochondria (intrinsic pathway), resulting in apoptosome formation
  and signaling through initiator caspase 9. Initiator caspases amplify the apoptotic
  signal via cleavage of downstream, effector caspases that induce irreversible damage
  to DNA and vital cellular machinery. Apoptin’s subcellular localization might be
  driven by its phosphorylation status. Once in the nucleus, apoptin binds to several
  protein partners and DNA through a highly inconsistent secondary and tertiary structure.
  Novel therapeutic compounds, such as shepheridin, LY2181308 (an antisense oligonucleotide),
  EM-1421, and YM155, exhibit anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy in the clinical management
  of cancer patients by directly targeting survivin and/or inducing caspase expression
  and activity, ultimately resulting in apoptosis mediated via both intrinsic and
  extrinsic apoptotic pathways.
