caption: Neuroprotective effect of RES in PD pathogenesis via reversal of mitochondrial
  impairment by (A) activation of AMPK and (B) inhibition of mTOR and ULK1 leads to
  autophagy/mitophagy by recruiting autophagosomes followed by inhibition of mitochondrial
  dependent apoptosis; (C) activation of SIRT-1-AMPK signalling pathway enhances the
  process of mitochondrial biogenesis by persuading PGC-1α, Nrf1/2, and TFAM; (D)
  reduction in aggregation of α-syn aggregation; (E) scavenging action on cellular
  ROS and activation of endogenous antioxidant enzymatic activities. Normal physiology
  of mitochondrial bioenergetics comprises the mitochondrial OXPHOS system, exist
  on the inner membrane, which generates ATP to fulfil the cellular energy requirements.
  During the OXPHOS process, leakage of electrons takes place from mitochondrial complexes
  I and III, and generates the O2 •− byproducts. These radicals disrupt the Ca2+ homeostasis,
  induces damaging effect on mtDNA and, increases oxidative stress as well as apoptosis
  associated with mitochondria. Antioxidant mechanisms of mitochondria involves ROS-scavenging
  enzyme SOD2, GPx and PRx. AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase;
