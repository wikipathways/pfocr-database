caption: The cholesterol synthesis pathway and protein prenylation. Statins inhibit
  the conversion of HMGCoA to L-mevalonate through competitive inhibition of the rate
  limiting enzyme HMGCoA reductase. This inhibition results in a decrease in the downstream
  biosynthesis of cholesterol and other intermediate metabolites including the isoprenoids
  farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. These isoprenoid pyrophosphates
  serve as essential adjuncts in the posttranslational modification of numerous key
  proteins that act as molecular switches including the small GTPases Ras, Rac and
  Rho. The posttranslational modification enables these signaling proteins to associate
  with membranes which are requisite for most of their biological function.
