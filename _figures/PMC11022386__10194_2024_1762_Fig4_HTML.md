caption: Proposed Mechanisms and Sites of Action of Cilostazol-Induced Migraine-Like
  Headache in Persons with PPTH. The illustration delineates a hypothesized mechanism
  and site of action whereby diverse pharmacological triggers contribute to the genesis
  of migraine-like headache in people with persistent post-traumatic headache (PPTH).
  In this proposed model, the neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)
  and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP-38) engage with their
  respective G protein-coupled receptors situated on vascular smooth muscle cells
  within the walls of meningeal arteries. Both peptides instigate adenylate cyclase
  (AC) activation via their transmembrane receptors, leading to an augmented intracellular
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. Cilostazol, a selective inhibitor
  of phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE-3), impedes cAMP breakdown, resulting in its accumulation.
  The cAMP signaling pathway is postulated to activate and open ATP-sensitive potassium
  channels (KATP) and large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BKCa)
  channels. These subsequent events lead to potassium efflux, accompanied by the vasodilation
  of meningeal arteries. Modified from Al-Khazali et al., 2023.[19, 23]
