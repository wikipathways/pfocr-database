figtitle: Bacterial effector targets the TRAF6-NFKB pathway to modulate the acute
  inflammatory response to bacterial invasion of epithelial cells

- Escherichia coli
- Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium
- Listeria monocytogenes
- Pseudomonas syringae
- Shigella flexneri
- Pasteurella multocida
- Mus musculus
- Cavia porcellus

caption: Figure 2. Shigella inhibits acute inflammatory responses at the initial stage
  of infection. Shigella invades the host cell by macropinocytosis and quickly escapes
  from the phagosome into the cytoplasm. The phagosome membrane fragments are produced
  by Shigella upon escape in the host cytoplasm. DAG accumulates around the bacterial
  entry site. This accumulation activates the diacylglycerol-CBM complex-TRAF6-NFκB
  signaling pathway. Shigella OspI is delivered via the type III secretion system
  during bacterial invasion. OspI acts as a glutamine deamidase and selectively deamidates
  Gln100 to Glu100 in UBc13, severely impairing the E2 ubiquitin conjugating activity
  of Ubc13, which is required for the activation of the TRAF6-NFκB pathway.
