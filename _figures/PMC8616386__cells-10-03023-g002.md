caption: NLRP3 inflammasome priming and activation pathway. Activation of the NLRP3
  inflammasome signaling pathway requires two signals. The signal ① or priming (left)
  is triggered by the stimulation of cytokine receptors (TNFR and IL-1R) or TLRs via
  several activators, such as LPS, DAMPs or PAMPs. This interaction with their respective
  receptors will then lead to the upregulation of several inflammasome components
  (NLRP3, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18) via the NF-κB pathway as well as to posttranslational
  modifications of ASC and NLRP3 protein. Signal ② or activation (right) is triggered
  by numerous PAMPs or DAMPs including virus, crystals, protein aggregates, LPS, bacterial
  toxins, or ATP, which will, in turn, activate multiple signaling cascades. The latter
  involves, among others, K+ efflux, ROS production, lysosomal dysfunction, and the
  release of mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol. These signals lead eventually to the
  interaction between NLRP3, ASC and pro-caspase-1, allowing the formation of the
  NLRP3 multiprotein inflammasome complex. Once activated, caspase 1, the head of
  the canonical activation, cleaves the pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18 and Gasdermin D (GSDMD)
  into their mature forms, triggering pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokines release.
  In addition, another way leading to pyroptosis is the noncanonical pathway, where
  cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), via caspases 4, 5 and 11, can also cleave GSDMD
  and form pores into the cellular membrane. IL-1R1, IL-1 receptor type 1; PANX1,
  pannexin 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor;
  TRX, thioredoxin.
