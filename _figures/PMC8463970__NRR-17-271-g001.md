caption: 'A highly simplified diagram of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, showing
  key intermediates and enzymes described in text.Consecutive arrows indicate undefined
  number of steps involving metabolites not shown. The rate-limiting step of this
  pathway is catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase, which could be inhibited by statins.
  Statins will thus block the production of not only cholesterol, but also mevalonate-derived
  farnesyl pyrophosphate and genarylgenaryl pyrophosphate that are substrate for protein
  prenylation. The final step of conversion of 7-Dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol
  is catalysed by Δ7-sterol reductase. Ay9984 and BM15766 are inhibitors of this enzyme.
  See text for more details. HMG-CoA: 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA.'
