caption: The functional regulation of active small molecules on KATP channels. (A)
  H2S participates in KATP channel regulation. H2S acts on the corresponding organ/tissues/cytochemical
  small molecules in the oval through KATP channels to produce physiological effects
  in a rectangular box. The black up and down arrows inside the ellipse represent
  increasing and decreasing, respectively. (B). NO participates in KATP channel regulation.
  The relative drugs in the ellipses produce physiological effects in the rectangular
  boxes through the KATP channels and NO/CGMP signaling pathways, which the reaction
  goes in the direction of the arrows in the same color. (C). O2 participates in KATP
  channel regulation. Hypoxia results in a decrease in ATP/ADP acting on KATP channels
  to prevent action potential generation and cell contraction; The KATP channel acts
  on skeletal muscle and affects O2 transport to sustain submaximal exercise tolerance;
  The KATP channel affects anterior cerebral circulation and total cerebral perfusion
  through O2 transport to prevent action potential generation and cell contraction.
  The black up and down arrows inside the ellipse represent increasing and decreasing,
  respectively. (D). Other small active molecules. CORM-3 can mimic the HO-1/CO pathway,
  activate mitoKATP channels and elicit cardioprotection against hypoxia-reoxygenation
  injury by inhibiting the Na+/HCO3− transporter; CORM-2 alleviates gastric lesions
  at the systemic level via KATP channels, reducing gastric DNA oxidation and inflammatory
  responses; SO2 plays a vasodilatory role through KATP channel activation in the
  peripheral cardiovascular system at high concentrations (>500 μmol/L).
