caption: NAMPTi, PARPi and immunotherapy. Under IFN-γ stimulation, JAK/STAT/ interferon
  regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) signal axis positively mediates PD-L1 expression. Inhibition
  of NAMPT can reduce the expression of downstream STAT1 molecules, indicating the
  prospect of NAD complementary therapy and immune checkpoint blocking therapy. Under
  the action of PARP inhibitors, the content of dsDNA in the cytoplasmic is increased,
  which activates the cGAS/STING pathway and leads to the generation of type 1 interferon
  (IFN) reaction, which on the one hand, enhances the relevant chemokines and leads
  to the accumulation of T cells; on the other hand, increases the expression of PD-L1
  and leads to the depletion of T cells. This adverse effect can be eliminated by
  PD-1/PD-L1 blockade
