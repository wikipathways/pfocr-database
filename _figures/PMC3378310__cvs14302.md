caption: PKA-dependent signalling pathway is activated by various stimuli (e.g. mechanical
  forces and chemical ligands) regulating vessel growth. PKA signalling interacts
  with other intracellular pathways such as Akt and AMPK, converging onto the activation
  of eNOS that exerts multiple cellular functions synergistically leading to vessel
  growth. It should be pointed out that the actions of eNOS/NO on the phenotypes of
  ECs and SMCs may be context-specific dependent on several physiological and pathological
  conditions.
