caption: Schematic demonstration of the current regulatory model. Expression of Claudin-18
  is decreased in lung tissue of rat model of hyperoxia-induced BPD. Then the WNT
  classical pathway is inhibited. And the destruction ability of β-catenin degradation
  complex was increased. As a result, the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm
  is reduced and its entry into the nucleus is reduced. Activating WNT pathway promotes
  transdifferentiation of AECs, which leads to the interruption of alveolar and capillary
  development.
