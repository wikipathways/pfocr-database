caption: The potential mechanism of biphasic action of CORT-related changes in both
  (A) and only SOL (B) muscles during the CSR. (A) The BST stimulation mimics the
  CSR condition and activates the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenocortical (HPA) axis,
  which results in CORT secretion. Increased circulating CORT level triggers signaling
  cascades, including the action of GR (thereby arising in HSD11B1 and fibronectin
  type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5)/irisin expression), and MR (which might
  activate NADPH oxidase, causing the ROS generation). Furthermore, GR induces skeletal
  muscle atrophy in a direct (through FOXOs), and indirect (through HSD11B1-dependent
  atrogin-1/MURF) mechanism. Additionally, the oxidative damage of macromolecules
  (decreased level of SH groups, increased lipids peroxidation) occurs with simultaneous
  activation of enzymatic defense mechanisms (increased activity of SOD, CAT, and
  GPx). (B) In contrast to the adverse changes triggered by the CSR, the level of
  IGF-1 increased in red muscle and possibly induced the mitochondrial biogenesis
  through the IGF/PI3K/AKT pathway. Additionally, we observed increased irisin flux,
  and that protein traditionally is supposed to be a PGC-1α-dependent myokine; however,
  GR is also a positive regulator of FNDC5 gene expression. We suggest that irisin
  acts not only in an endocrine but also in an autocrine manner. Hence, irisin also
  promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in (red) skeletal muscle (manifested, i.e., by
  increased CS activity) and could be a part of the protective mechanism in red muscle.
