caption: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) associates with distinct sets of
  adaptor proteins to form the mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling complexes. Growth factors,
  cytokines and comstimulation activate mTORC1 via PI3K activation, while amino acids
  activate the Ragulator complex (RagA–D). Oxygen and energy availability control
  mTORC1 via the regulation of AMPK. mTORC1 in turn promotes glycolysis, glutaminolysis,
  lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis, and the oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate
  pathway. The canonical downstream targets of mTORC1 include 4E-BP1 and S6 Kinase.
  While 4E-BP1 regulates the transcription factors HIF-1α and Myc, it appears that
  S6 Kinase regulates SREBP1/2. mTORC2 is activated by its association with ribosomes
  and inhibited by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Akt is activated downstream
  of mTORC2, but Akt also negatively regulates TSC1/2 upstream of mTORC1. Akt phosphorylates
  and negatively regulates the Foxo transcription factors, which have been implicated
  in cell survival and migration. Akt also activates key enzymes in the glycolytic
  pathway, while simultaneously inhibiting gluconeogenesis through regulation of Foxo
  transcription factors.
