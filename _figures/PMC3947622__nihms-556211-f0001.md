caption: a | Local protein vaccination induces dendritic cell (DC) maturation and
  migration to the T cell zones of draining lymph nodes. DCs that express peptide–MHC
  class II complexes engage naive, antigen-specific CD4+ T cells to induce their proliferation
  and differentiation into effector T helper (TH) cells. In the B cell zone, whole
  antigen is trapped by subcapsular sinus (SCS) macrophages and presented to naive
  follicular B cells. Antigen-specific B cells become activated, take up, process
  and present antigenic peptides and migrate towards the B cell–T cell borders of
  the draining lymph node. Effector TH cells emerge in multiple forms; emigrant TH
  cells exit the lymph node to function at distal tissue sites and T follicular helper
  (TFH) cells relocate to B cell–T cell borders and interfollicular regions. Cognate
  contact between pre-germinal centre (pre-GC) TFH cells and antigen-primed B cells
  is required for multiple programming events in the pathway to B cell memory. b |
  Clonal expansion, antibody class switching and non-GC plasma cell development proceeds
  in the extrafollicular regions of the lymph nodes. Secondary follicle formation
  and antibody class switching precede the initiation of the GC reaction, which forms
  the dominant pathway for the generation of memory B cells. c | Polarization of the
  secondary follicle anatomically signifies the initiation of the GC cycle. The dark
  zone supports GC centroblast proliferation, class-switch recombination and B cell
  receptor (BCR) diversification through somatic hypermutation. Non-cycling GC centrocytes
  move to the light zone and continually scan follicular DC networks. Centrocytes
  that lose the ability to bind to the presented antigen undergo apoptosis, while
  those that express a variant BCR with a higher affinity can compete for binding
  to antigen-specific GC TFH cells. Cognate contact with GC TFH cells requires peptide–MHC
  class II expression by the GC centrocytes. This contact can promote B cell re-entry
  into the dark zone and the GC cycle or exit from the GC and entry into the affinity-matured
  memory B cell compartments of non-secreting memory B cells and post-GC plasma cells.
  d | Following antigen re-challenge, memory B cells present antigens to memory TFH
  cells to promote memory B cell clonal expansion with rapid memory plasma cell generation
  and the induction of a secondary GC reaction. Although related to the cellular and
  molecular activities of the primary response, as depicted, the memory-response dynamics
  remain poorly resolved. TCR, T cell receptor.
