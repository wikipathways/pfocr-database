caption: Acylceramide biosynthesis pathway. Metabolites and final products are marked
  in blue and the catalytic enzymes of each reaction are shown in black. The ω-O-acylation
  prior to ceramide synthesis remains uncertain. This figure tentatively shows that
  ω-O-acylation occurs after ω-OH ceramide production.
