caption: Glycation in Parkinson’s disease. Hyperglycemia and oxidative stress may
  up-regulate the Maillard reaction with increased formation of AGEs in brain cells
  (1). AGEs can either bind to membrane RAGE (mRAGE) at the cell surface of microglia
  and/or neurons, triggering NF-κB activation and subsequent expression of pro-inflammatory
  mediators and RAGE (2). Glycation can also directly affect the function of proteins,
  namely α-synuclein favoring its accumulation and aggregation (3). On the other hand,
  circulating AGEs may bind to soluble RAGE receptors (sRAGE) that do not control
  any intracellular pathway, acting as a neuroprotective strategy (4). Additionally,
  cells are endowed with efficient endogenous systems for detoxication against AGEs,
  namely glyoxalase-I and -II that constitute the main systems responsible for the
  metabolization of AGEs in a pathway dependent on glutathione (5).
