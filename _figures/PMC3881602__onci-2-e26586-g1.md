caption: Figure 1. Impact of metabolism and mTOR signaling on the abundance and immunosuppressive
  activity of regulatory T cells. The T-cell receptor (TCR) and interleukin-2 (IL-2)
  receptor transduce two major immune inputs that activate the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1),
  which promotes cholesterol/lipid biosynthesis. In particular, the mevalonate pathway
  stimulates the proliferation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the expression of
  effector molecules on their surface, hence establishing their functional competence.
  mTORC1 also negatively regulates the activity of mTORC2 to modulate Treg function.
  The leptin-dependent activation of mTOR maintains the anergic status of Tregs through
  an unknown mechanism. Blocking the leptin receptor (OBR) or reducing the levels
  of leptin enhances Treg proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Amino acids also activate
  mTOR, which limits the generation of inducible Tregs (iTregs) through an undefined
  mechanism. Tregs preferentially accumulate in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT),
  where they exhibit increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)
  expression levels. The activation of PPARγ by either endogenous ligands or exogenous
  agonists stimulates fatty acid metabolism, hence promoting Treg proliferation as
  well as the expression of GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3),
  which sustain the immunosuppressive activity of these cells.
