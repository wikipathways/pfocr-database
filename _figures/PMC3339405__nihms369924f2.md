caption: The Wnt/Ctnnb1 signaling pathway is involved in self-renewal of leukemic
  stem cells. In the absence of Wnt, Ctnnb1 (beta-catenin) associates with an inhibitory
  complex including axin (axis inhibitor) and APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) and
  GSK3β (glycogen-synthase kinase 3β). Ctnnb1 is phosphorylated in this complex by
  CK1 (casein kinase 1) and GSK3β. This phosphorylation leads to its ubiquitylation
  and degradation by the proteasome. Members of the TCF/LEF transcription factor family
  are bound in the nucleus by repressors that belong to the GRG (groucho-related gene)
  family and are therefore inactive. Wnt is known to bind to its receptor (Frizzled),
  through the cysteine-rich domain of the receptor, and co-receptors such as LRP5
  (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5) or LRP6. Binding of WNT to
  the receptor complex results in the inactivation of GSK3β by dissheveled. The unphosphorylated
  version of Ctnnb1 is able to migrate to the nucleus, where it binds TCFs to activate
  target genes. Prostaglandin signaling has been shown to negatively regulate Wnt-Ctnnb1
  via PKA/cAMP signaling in normal and leukemic stem cells
