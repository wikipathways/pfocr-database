caption: Schematic representation of GC mitotic partitioning and its functional connections
  with the regulation of mitosis. During the cell cycle, the GC undergoes sequential
  and reversible disassembly steps. During G2, the Golgi complex is unlinked process
  thanks to the action of BARS and the phosphorylation of GRASP65 by JNK2 and GRASP55
  by ERK1. The G2-specific unlinking is required to activate a Src/Aurora-A mediated
  pathway to induce centrosome maturation and enter mitosis. After mitosis onset,
  the Golgi stacks are further disassembled into dispersed vesicles and clusters.
  Stack disassembly removes a steric hindrance that could hamper spindle formation;
  the GM130/TPX2/Aurora-A pathway is activated to aid in spindle formation and orientation.
  In addition, a set of Golgi-structural proteins relocates to the spindle and is
  repurposed for its proper formation. In turn, the spindle mediates the inheritance
  of ribbon factors for GC reformation at mitotic exit.
