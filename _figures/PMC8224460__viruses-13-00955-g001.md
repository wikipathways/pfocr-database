caption: A tentative model showing possible mechanisms determining susceptibility
  or resistance of potato plants to PVY. (A) Schematic representation of the methionine
  cycle (MTC) in healthy cells. Metabolite (shown in pink) flow directions are presented
  by arrows, while the enzymes involved in their bioconversion are marked in blue.
  CBL, cystathionine β-lyase; HCY, homocysteine; MET, methionine; MS, methionine synthase;
  THF, tetrahydrofolate; 5-MTHF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; 5,10-MTHF, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate;
  MTHFR, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase; SAH, S-adenosyl-homocysteine; SAHH,
  S-adenosyl-homocysteine hydrolase; SAM, S-adenosyl methionine; SAMS, S-adenosyl
  methionine synthetase; SHM, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; (B) Schematic representation
  of the changes in expression of key MTC-related enzymes and MTC metabolites in response
  to PVY. Black arrows show enzyme pathway and metabolite flow directions. Blue and
  red arrows indicate down- and up-regulation, respectively. PVY infection in Chicago
  plants at higher temperature causes down-regulation of key MTC (MS, SAMS, SAHH)
  and MTC-related folate cycle (SHM, MTHFR) enzymes, leading to the decrease of SAM
  and increase of SAH []. This would suppress SAM-dependent methylation reactions
  and decrease ethylene production, leading to a great increase in plant susceptibility
  to PVY. At normal temperature, PVY infection did not affect expression of MTC enzymes,
  and plants display much lower susceptibility to PVY compared with high temperature.
  PVY infection in Gala plants at higher temperature causes up-regulation of MS, SAMS
  and SHM, leading to the increase of SAM levels and SAM:SAH ratio (at 8 dpi). At
  higher temperature, Gala plants responded to PVY by up-regulation of CBL and SHM,
  also leading to increased SAM levels and SAM:SAH ratio. Gala plants remain resistant
  to PVY at both normal and high temperatures.
