caption: (1) Genome expansion leads to the appearance of (2,3) tRNA isodecoders which
  are used in different canonical and non-canonical functions, of which tRNAThr(G4•U69)
  is (4) mischarged by AlaRS, to give the tRNA misselection product L-Ala-tRNAThr(G4•U69). (5)
  in vitro these misselection products are cleared by ThrRS and ATD. 6) In multicellular
  animals, ROS acts as an important cellular metabolite performing various physiological
  functions by triggering the appropriate signaling pathway. 7) ROS generated internally
  in cells oxidizes the active site cysteine of ThrRS editing domain thereby affecting
  its proofreading activity on L-Ala-tRNAThr. 8) To avoid mistranslation ATD is recruited
  in Animals and Choanoflagellates as it is inert towards ROS and robustly proofreads
  L-Ala-tRNAThr to avoid (9) Thr-to-Ala mistranslation at the proteome level followed
  by cell death. 10) The tRNA isodecoders that are deacylated by ATD can either go
  for fresh aminoacylation or can be rerouted for other non-canonical functions.
