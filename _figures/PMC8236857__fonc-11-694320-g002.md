caption: Overview of current strategies targeting MYCN at different levels, from signalling
  receptors to downstream regulation, as well as epigenetics, and synthetic lethality.
  Specific modalities (highlighted in red) have been developed to target the mechanistic
  components of each pathway. BRD4, Bromodomain-containing protein 4; GF, Growth Factor;
  HDAC, Histone deacetylases; MAX, MYC-associated factor X; P-TEFb, Positive transcription
  elongation factor b; PTCH1, Patched 1; RNA pol II, RNA polymerase II; SF, Survival
  factor; WNT, Wingless.
