caption: 'Bcl-2 family-regulated pathway and phenotypes in Bcl-2 knockout mice after
  status epilepticus. Cartoon depicts the relationship between the activated Bcl-2
  family proteins after status epilepticus, the signaling pathways they drive toward
  cell death, and possible consequences of such cell death on epileptogenesis. Multiple
  BH3-only proteins are activated by epileptogenic insults which may promote mitochondrial
  dysfunction via Bax or other mechanisms, a step that can be blocked by anti-apoptotic
  members of the Bcl-2 family. The cell death controlled by this pathway may promote
  tissue repair or drive epileptogenesis via disruption of neuronal networks. The
  phenotype of Bcl-2 family protein knockout mice is indicted in the boxes linked
  by a stalk. For each, the key shows how deletion of the gene impacts convulsive
  thresholds (e.g., to kainate), hippocampal injury after status epilepticus or emergent
  spontaneous seizures. Not represented: The figure does not include other intracellular
  compartments in which Bcl-2 family proteins are commonly found such as the endoplasmic
  reticulum. SE, status epilepticus.'
