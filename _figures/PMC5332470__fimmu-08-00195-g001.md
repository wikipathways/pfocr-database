  Memory T cell differentiation is regulated by intracellular and extracellular factors.
  Mechanisms of memory development upon naïve T cell activation (antigen stimulation)
  are the subject of ongoing discussion. Since it has been reported that CD4+ T cell
  memory development resembles that of CD8+ T cells (), we assumed that both T cell
  subsets follow similar pathways. However, transitional memory subsets sitting between
  central memory T cells (TCM) and effector memory T cells (TEM) have been described
  in the CD4+ T cell compartment. Several memory T cell subsets have been defined
  but their lineage relationship has remained unclear. Some models describe a linear
  origin of memory T cells directly from effector T cells; other models propose a
  divergent differentiation where naïve T cells give rise to memory and effector T
  cells through asymmetrical division. More recently a progressive differentiation
  pathway has been proposed, depending on stimulus intensity and duration (represented
  inside the box). According to this model, T cell fate depends on the duration of
  signaling and presence/absence of cytokines. Brief stimulation leads to the generation
  of TCM whereas sustained stimulation plus presence of cytokines generates TEM. Therefore,
  in the progressive model, a single naïve T cell will give rise to different memory
  T cell subsets that are the precursors of terminally differentiated effector T cells.
  Progression into these differentiated memory subsets relies on the gradual response
  to cytokines, acquisition of tissue homing receptors, resistance to apoptosis, and
  gain of effector functions while gradually losing lymph node homing receptors, proliferative
  capacity, and the ability to produce IL-2 production, to self-renew, and survive
  [for review, see Ref. (–)]. Although the exact origin of the CD28− T cell phenotype
  is not clear, based on the literature, we hypothesize that these cells arise from
  terminally differentiated effector memory T cells (TEMRA) as well as TEM after exposure
  to CMV. Abbreviations: Th, T-helper cell; CTL, cytotoxic T cell; TSCM, stem cell
  memory T cell; TCM, central memory T cell; TEM, effector memory T cell; TEMRA, terminally
  differentiated (CD45RA reexpressing) effector memory T cell.'
