caption: Overview of Snail signaling pathway that regulates cell migration in prostate
  cancer cells. Our data supports a signaling pathway in which Snail promotes cell
  migration via repression of maspin expression which allows for PI3K/AKT activation
  and subsequently Rac1 activation. An alternate pathway involves Snail activation
  of MAPK signaling pathway that leads to increased cell migration independent of
  Rac1. There may also be a positive feedback loop by which PI3K/AKT and MAPK activity
  can increase Snail expression.
