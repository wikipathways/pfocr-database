caption: Experimental workflow of the N-terminomics/TAILS protocol using dimethylation
  isotopic labeling in a cancer mouse model treated with a protease inhibitor or a
  vehicle control. Tumors are lysed, reduced and alkylated before being isotopically
  labeled with light (+28 Da) or deuterated (+34 Da) formaldehyde. Proteins are then
  digested with trypsin and a pre-enrichment TAILS sample is collected. The remaining
  peptides are subjected to the TAILS polymer and N-termini are added to a size exclusion
  filter. Samples are subjected to liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry
  (LC-MS/MS). The proteomics data is analyzed by bioinformatics software (e.g., MaxQuant).
  Data interpretation is analyzed with pathway enrichment tools (Metascape, STRING)
  or protease analysis software (TopFIND).
