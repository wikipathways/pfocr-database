caption: Relationship between the four main cytoskeletons and the JNK signaling pathway.
  JNK preferentially phosphorylates microtubule-associated and actin-binding proteins
  (MAPs, ABPs), as well as intermediate filament (IF) building blocks (black arrows).
  For IF-associated proteins (IFAPs) and septin-associated proteins (SeptAPs) only
  the ones also associating with MTs or F-actin filaments are known as putative substrates
  of JNK (dashed arrows). All the cytoskeletons can regulate the JNK signaling pathway
  (colored arrows).
