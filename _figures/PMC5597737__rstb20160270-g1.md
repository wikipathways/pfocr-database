caption: Activation of NF-κB and IL6/STAT3 signalling pathways in NPC cells by multiple
  EBV-encoded latent gene products. Through binding with TLR3, abundant EBERs could
  strongly activate both NF-κB and IFN3 signalling pathways. However, the inactivation
  of TRAF3 by either LMP1 expression or somatic mutation will inhibit IFN3 signalling,
  thus protecting the cells from the EBER-induced innate immune response. LMP1 also
  activates the NF-kB signalling pathways through interacting with multiple TRAFs.
  Distinct NF-κB signals, including p50/p50/BCL3 and p50/RelB, will induce multiple
  survival genes (A20, survivin) and inflammatory cytokines (IL6). EBNA1 induces the
  ubiquitous expression of IL6R in NPC cells. The binding of highly expressed IL6
  with IL6R results in constitutive activated STAT3 signalling. The activated STAT3
  pathway might crosstalk with the altered NF-κB signalling by the upregulation of
  BCL3 in NPC cells. The common somatic mutations in NPC targeting the NF-κB pathways
  are also shown.
