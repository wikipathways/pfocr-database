caption: Overview of the transport pathway of vitamin A and the important proteins
  involved from its entrance through the enterocytes, to its influx and efflux from
  storage in hepatocytes, and its entrance to peripheral tissues. Questions about
  RBPR2 function in the intestines, probable efflux capability, and signaling mechanism
  for vitamin A release into serum are included. ROL—All-trans Retinol; CRBP1—Cellular
  Retinol Binding Protein 1; CRBP2—Cellular Retinol Binding Protein 2; STRA6—Stimulated
  by Retinoic Acid 6; RBPR2—Retinol Binding Protein 4 Receptor 2; RBP4—Retinol Binding
  Protein 4; TTR—Transthyretin; atRA—All-Trans Retinoic Acid; 11-Cis-RAL—11-Cis-Retinal;
  Apo—Unbound state; Holo—Bound state. Created with BioRender.com.
