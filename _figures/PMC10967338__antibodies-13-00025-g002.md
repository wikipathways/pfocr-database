caption: 'EGFR wild type and EGFRvIII mutated comparison. (a) The epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR) comprises three domains: an extracellular domain, a transmembrane
  domain (hydrophobic), and an intracellular domain (distinctive of EGFRs from the
  TKI family and highly conserved). The extracellular domain comprises four smaller
  domains (DI-DIV). DI and DII are essential to ligand binding. EGFRvIII was obtained
  because the 801 bp in-frame deletion of 2–7 exons of the EGFR gene. (b) The extracellular
  domain interacts with numerous ligands, including epidermal growth factor (EGF)
  protein, EGFR-like growth factors, epiregulin (EPR), transforming growth factor-alpha
  (TGF-α), and betacellulin (BTC). EGFR is activated by ligand binding followed by
  dimerization, which provokes a conformational shift that further supports EGFR intracellular
  triggering by specific phosphorylated tyrosine residues (Y845, Y992, Y1068, Y1086,
  and Y1173) at the carboxyl-terminal domain, followed by activation of a complex
  program of downstream intracellular signals within the cytoplasm and nucleus, including
  RAS-MAPK, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways. These downstream signaling cascades prompt
  cell proliferation, loss of differentiation, invasion, angiogenesis, and inhibition
  of apoptosis. EGFRVIII maintains intact transmembrane and intracellular kinase domains,
  granting EGFRvIII independence of ligand binding to support further growth signaling
  in GBM cells and malignancy'
