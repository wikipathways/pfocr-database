caption: Summary of the role of DDAH/ADMA in vascular function and homeostasis. Increased
  ADMA levels are associated with cardiovascular disorders, which are related to dysfunctional
  endothelial cell responses and may be reversed by modulating DDAH activity. ADMA
  inhibits NO production, resulting in activation of RhoA and stress fibres though
  inhibition of PKG activity and reduction of RhoA phosphorylation at Ser188. This
  pathway results in reduced endothelial cell motility and angiogenesis, which is
  reversed by DDAH activation.
