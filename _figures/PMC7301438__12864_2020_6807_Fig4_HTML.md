caption: Schematic metabolism of RFN20 and RF39. We depicted the metabolic models
  based on gene annotation results of four representative genomes of RFN20 and RF39
  (see Table ). Solid squares indicate presence of the genes responsible for a step
  or a pathway. The products depicted in the MEP/DOXP pathway are 1-deoxy-xylulose
  5-P, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-P, 4-(Cytidine 5′-PP)-2-C-methyl-erythritol, 2-P-4-(cytidine
  5′-PP)-2-C-methyl-erythritol, 2-C-methyl-erythritol 2,4-PP, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl
  4-PP, dimethylallyl-PP, isopentenyl-PP, and farnesyl-PP
papertitle: Phylogenomics of expanding uncultured environmental Tenericutes provides
  insights into their pathogenicity and evolutionary relationship with Bacilli.
