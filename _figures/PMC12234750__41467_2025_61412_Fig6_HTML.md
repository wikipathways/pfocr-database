caption: A Heme biosynthesis occurs partially in the mitochondria, requiring iron
  that must be obtained from the extracellular environment. Exported heme is used
  as a cofactor by lanosterol-14α-demethylase (Erg11), the target of FLC, which performs
  a critical step in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. The FLC-resistant C. neoformans
  strain maintains ergosterol content under FLC stress, supported by increased abundance
  of Erg11 levels and elevated heme content compared to the FLC-susceptible WT strain.
  B Deletion of clpX in the FLC-resistant strain  reduced ergosterol content, as well
  as lowered abundance of Erg11, decreased in heme content, and increased susceptibility
  to FLC. ClpX has known roles in heme biosynthesis and mitochondrial protein homeostasis.
  We propose that disruption of ClpX impairs these pathways that are essential for
  C. neoformans to maintain resistance, supporting restoration of susceptibility to
  FLC. Created in BioRender. Geddes-McAlister, J. (2025) https://BioRender.com/1h42nuz
