caption: Left, prevalent model based on spatial hierarchy. TRAIL initially stimulates
  assembly of a membrane‐localized apoptosis‐inducing signaling complex comprising
  TRAIL death receptors, FADD, and procaspase‐8 filaments. After release into the
  cytoplasm, the latter two secondarily form an NF‐κB‐activating complex together
  with RIP and TRAF2. Notably, models of TNFR1 signaling invoke the opposite order
  of events. Right, revised model with pathway bifurcation at the receptor level.
  Proteins required for apoptosis induction and NF‐κB activation are concomitantly
  recruited to the membrane‐localized TRAIL death receptor signaling complex prior
  to eventual release in the cytoplasm. Although FADD is an essential part of the
  revised model, it is no obligate component of the cytosolic complex—while FADD‐deficient
  cells lack cell death induction or NF‐κB activation after TRAIL stimulation, they
  are still able to activate NF‐κB and necroptosis in response to TNF. The asterisk
  indicates fully matured heterotetrameric caspase‐8.
