caption: Proposed model of Co-stimulatory and Co-inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules
  in AML. The mechanism is activated by the presentation of antigen (Red circle) by
  MHC-II of the APC/tumour cells to the TCR of T cell. Other co-regulatory interactions
  occur simultaneously as depicted. The down regulated genes are labelled white (CD28,
  CD226 and TLT2) and red label denotes those which show deleterious mutation in the
  domain region. CTLA-4 competes with CD28, thereby sending negative signals. Mutation
  in the domain regions of B7-H3 might disrupt its interaction with TLT2. Hence all
  the positive signals might be prohibited and activation of negative signals resulting
  in inhibition of immune response.
