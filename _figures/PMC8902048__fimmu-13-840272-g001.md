caption: 'Conserved regulatory pathways associated to immunometabolism in C. elegans.
  These include the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), the p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor
  signaling (IIS) pathway, the forkhead box transcription factor O (FoxO)-mediated
  signaling, the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway, the nuclear
  factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, the hypoxia-Inducible factor
  (HIF)-1 regulatory pathway, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.
  The C. elegans protein names are provided followed by the corresponding human homolog.
  *The mTOR pathway is regulated by two complexes, TORC1 and TORC2. The main proteins
  composing these complexes, which are conserved between C. elegans and humans, are
  the following: LET-363/TOR, DAF-15/Raptor, and RICT-1/Rictor ().'
