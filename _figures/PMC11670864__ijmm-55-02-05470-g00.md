caption: Generation of B10 cells via in vitro stimulation of TLR pathways. LPS, CpG
  ODN and other stimulants added in vitro activate the TLR/MyD88 signaling pathway
  through TLR4 and TLR9 receptors, promoting the activation of MAPK pathway, NF-κB
  and STAT3 phosphorylation, causing transcription factors to enter the nucleus. After
  binding promoter sequences of suppressor genes such as IL-10, molecules such as
  NF-κB and AP-1, can promote their expression and exert immunosuppressive function.
  Cytokines such as IL-6, which are expressed as a result of TLR activation, cause
  STAT3 phosphorylation through the JAK/STAT pathway. Phosphorylated STAT3 promotes
  the expression of Blimp-1 and other factors, leading to the differentiation of B
  cells into Bregs. In addition, TLR3, 4 and 5 activate the Myd88-independent pathway
  and cause B cell differentiation toward Bregs. Futher, BCR and CD19 signaling pathways
  work together to promote production of IL-10. LPS, lipopolysaccharide; CpG ODN,
  Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine oligodeoxynucleotide; TLR, toll-like receptor; Blimp,
  B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein; Breg, regulatory B cell; BCR, B cell receptor;
  IRAK, Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor;
  BLNK, B cell linker protein; Btk, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing
  adapter-inducing interferon-β; AP, activator protein; IRF, interferon regulatory
  factor; IKK, IκB kinase; TBK, TANK-binding kinase
