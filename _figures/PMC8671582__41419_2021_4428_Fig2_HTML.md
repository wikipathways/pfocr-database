caption: The role of each pathway in the network was measured by counting its connections
  to upstream and downstream pathways. A pathway with a high degree value likely plays
  an important role in the signaling network. Circles indicate mRNAs and triangles
  indicate lncRNAs. Red represents upregulated pathways and green represents downregulated
  pathways. Baby blue lines indicate the interaction between lncRNAs and mRNAs, and
  gray lines indicate interactions between pathways.
