caption: (A) Simplified schematic of the Hippo signaling pathway. MST1/2 phosphorylates
  LATS1/2, which in turn phosphorylates YAP/TAZ. Phosphorylated TAP/TAZ is retained
  in the cytoplasm by the 14-3-3 proteins. (B) Structure of TEAD (green) and YAP (blue)
  showing the 3 interfaces of interaction and the central hydrophobic pocket in grey.
