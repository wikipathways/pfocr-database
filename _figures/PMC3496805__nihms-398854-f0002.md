caption: During allograft rejection, alloantibodies, inflammatory cytokines and growth
  factors mediate activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. Assembly of the mTORC2
  complex facilitates the phosphorylation and activation of Akt, which alone is sufficient
  to mediate EC activation responses and the transcriptional activation of VEGF. pAkt
  is well established to facilitate cell survival responses but also mediates growth,
  proliferation and migration and protein synthesis via mTORC1-dependent responses
  including two substrates S6K1 and 4EBP1. In EC these events are critical for proliferation
  and the neoangiogenesis reaction. mTORC1-mediated signals also enhance the expression
  of HIF-1 (a hypoxia response transcription factor), which induces the expression
  of VEGF. These signals are regulated by cell intrinsic proteins including PRAS40
  and Deptor, and can be targeted therapeutically by rapalogs.
