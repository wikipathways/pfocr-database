caption: Effects of gut microbiota and their metabolites on HCC progression. (A) In
  HCC patients, the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria is reduced. Butyrate
  supplementation activates calcium signaling pathways in HCC tumor cells, disrupting
  calcium homeostasis and increasing ROS production, ultimately inhibiting HCC tumor
  cells proliferation and migration. (B) Depletion of gut microbiota leads to increased
  tryptophan levels, which activate the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor. This activation
  suppresses SREBP2 expression, thereby inhibiting HCC development. (C) Acetate produced
  by Bifidobacterium pseudolongum binds to GPR43 receptors on HCC tumor cells, activating
  GPR43 and inhibiting the IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway, thus impeding MASLD-HCC
  progression. (D) The valeric acid produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus binds to
  the liver cell surface receptor GPR41/43, thereby exerting inhibitory effects on
  Rho-GTPase signaling and suppressing the development of MASLD-HCC. (E) EPP intervention
  increases the abundance of propionic and butyric acid-producing gut microbiota.
  This increase effectively inhibited the leakage of LPS, which subsequently led to
  the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway of HCC tumor cells and further reduced
  the expression of IL-16 and MMP-2, ultimately destroying HCC tumor cells survival
