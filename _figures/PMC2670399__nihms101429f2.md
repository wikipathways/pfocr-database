caption: Macroautophagy occurs at a basal level and can be induced in response to
  environmental signals including nutrients and hormones, and also microbial pathogens.
  The best-characterized regulatory pathway includes a class I PI3K and TOR, which
  act to inhibit autophagy, although the mechanism is not known. A class III PI3K
  is needed for activation of autophagy. TOR activity is probably regulated in part
  through feedback loops to prevent insufficient or excessive autophagy. For example,
  p70S6 kinase is a substrate of TOR that may act to limit TOR activity, ensuring
  basal levels of autophagy that are critical for homeostasis. Proteins in green and
  pink are stimulatory and inhibitory for autophagy, respectively. Dashed lines indicate
  possible regulatory effects.
