caption: CL deficiency causes an increase in mitochondrial ROS. CL is required for
  the structural assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. CL deficiency causes
  a decrease in respiratory performance and an increase in ROS generation. Major pathways
  implicated in ROS signaling are shown. Hypoxia, TNFα signaling and activation of
  the PI3K/Akt pathway are associated with an increase in ROS levels. HIF-1α stabilization,
  and activation of AMPK, NF-κB and many MAPKs are dependent on ROS signaling.
