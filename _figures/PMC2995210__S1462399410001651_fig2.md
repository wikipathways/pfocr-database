caption: Intracellular processing of vitamin B12 showing sites of defects in                 complementation
  groups. Complementation groups are in blue and are positioned               at sites
  of metabolic blocks (shown in red). Cobalamin intermediates are in red.               Excreted
  metabolites due to genetic defects are in shaded boxes. Pathway details are               described
  in the text. In the lysosome, cobalamin is released from transcobalamin (TC)               through
  its degradation (arrow pointing to dots). In the cytosol, R groups are               released
  by the cblC protein with the cob(II)alamin [Cob(II)] product               remaining
  bound (dotted line emanating from the cblC protein denotes               complex
  with cobalamin forms). The three versions of the cblD protein                 (cblD,
  cblD-1, cblD-2) illustrate               the role of the protein in directing cobalamin
  to the mitochondrial or cytosolic               pathway. In the mitochondrion, the
  cblB protein adds the               5′-deoxyadenosyl group, generating the active
  cofactor [adenosylcobalamin               (AdoCbl)], which is transferred to the
  mut [methylmalonyl-CoA mutase               (MCM)] protein. The cblA protein is
  proposed to act as a gatekeeper to ensure that the               cofactor form that
  is accepted and retained by MCM is AdoCbl. In the cytosolic               pathway,
  cob(II)alamin is bound to the cblG [methionine synthase               (MS)] protein.
  The cblE [methionine synthase reductase (MSR)] protein               catalyses generation
  of the active cofactor, methylcobalamin (MeCbl), or its               regeneration
  if oxidised to cob(II)alamin during reaction cycles.
