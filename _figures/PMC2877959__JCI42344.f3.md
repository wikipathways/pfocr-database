caption: In humans (upper left panel), the urate reabsorption pathway involves the
  apical exchanger proteins URAT1, OAT4, and OAT10; intracellular urate is released
  through basolateral Glut9. Urate uptake by URAT1 and OAT10 is accelerated by intracellular
  monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyrazinoate, and nicotinate and by dicarboxylates
  for OAT4. Several apical monocarboxylate transporters are required to favor urate
  reabsorption, such as MCT9 and SMCT1 and -2 (see text). The excretion pathway (blue
  box) involves the basolateral urate/dicarboxylate exchangers OAT1 and OAT3 and the
  apical ATP-binding cassette proteins MRP4 and ABCG2, as well as the sodium/phosphate
  cotransporters NPT1 and NPT4. Functional organization of the apical transporters
  is regulated by interactions with PDZ domains present in URAT1, NPT1, OAT4, and
  the sodium/monocarboxylate cotransporter SMCT1 and with PDZK1 and NHERF1; and influenced
  by changes in actin polymerization regulated by the protein CARMIL, as determined
  by biochemical and genetic studies (see text). Urate transport in the mouse kidney
  involves both the proximal and distal convoluted tubules (middle and lower left
  panels). The same urate-transporting proteins present in humans are found in the
  mouse proximal tubules, except for Glut9, which is present at an extremely low levels.
  In mice, in contrast to humans, Glut9 is present at very high levels in both the
  apical and basolateral poles of distal convoluted tubule cells. However, it is not
  known which isoform of Glut9 is present in the apical and basolateral membranes.
