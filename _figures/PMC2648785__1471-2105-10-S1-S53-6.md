caption: 'The JAK/STAT pathway. Each node indicates the component involving the transduction
  signaling or negative regulation of the pathway (R: receptor, JAK: JAK2, RJ: receptor-JAK2
  complex, Ligand: Epo or Tpo, LRJ: ligand bound RJ, Pc: cytoplasmic phosphatase,
  Pn: nuclear phosphatase, SOCS: negative regulator). * and D denote a phosphorylation
  and a dimerization, respectively. According to the location in a cell, each molecule
  is tagged by c (cytoplasm) or n (nucleus). The system output was calculated by the
  level of nuclear phosphorylated STAT dimers (STAT*Dn).'
