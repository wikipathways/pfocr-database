caption: An overview of the innate response to LV vectors. (A) LV RNA genome can activate
  TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8, resulting in production of IFN-I and activating innate immunity
  []. (B) In certain cell types, reverse transcription gives rise to cytoplasmic HIV
  DNA, thereby leading to the activation of the cGAS-STING innate immune signaling
  pathway []. (C) The secondary structure of HIV-1 genome RNA can elicit innate immune
  responses similar to those triggered by full-length genome RNA, activating the RNA
  sensor RIG-I in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages.
  The secondary structure of HIV-1 genome RNA can activate the RNA sensor RIG-I in
  primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages. Thus, RIG-I-MAVS
  innate immune signaling pathway is activated [,].
