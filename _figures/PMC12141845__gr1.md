caption: Canonical Wnt signalling pathway with osteokine and pro-inflammatory marker
  inhibitors. Note. Typically, Wnt proteins bind to their co-receptor complex (Frizzled
  and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5/6), this triggers a
  cascade of events resulting in osteoblast differentiation and increased OPG and
  decreased RANKL. Dickkopf (Dkk-1) and sclerostin (SOST) inhibit this pathway by
  binding to LRP5/6. Pro-inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and
  interleukin (IL)-1β upregulate Dkk-1 and sclerostin, and IL-6 upregulates Dkk-1.
  Together, these pro-inflammatory markers inhibit the canonical Wnt signalling pathway
  via their effects on Dkk-1 and sclerostin, with the downstream effect inhibiting
  osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Adapted from Cici D, Corrado A, Rotondo
