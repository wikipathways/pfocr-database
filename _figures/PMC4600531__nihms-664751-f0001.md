caption: A. Canonical signaling pathways are typically defined as those that are dependent
  on the stabilization of the β-catenin protein. In this context, Wnt ligands bind
  to a receptor complex that includes a member of the Frizzled family of seven transmembrane
  proteins and either Lrp5 or Lrp6. The engagement of this receptor complex leads
  to the phosphorylation of serine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of Lrp5/6 creating
  a binding site for the Axin protein. Axin is a component of a multi-protein complex
  which also includes the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein and the serine/threonine
  protein kinase, Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). In the absence of an upstream
  Wnt signal, this multiprotein complex facilitates the GSK3-dependent phosphorylation
  of β-catenin, targeting it for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. When Axin is recruited
  to the plasma membrane via its association with phosphorylated Lrp5/6, GSK3-mediated
  phosphorylation of β-catenin is inhibited, leading to increased levels of cytoplasmic
  β-catenin. β-catenin then can undergo nuclear translocation and lead to target gene
  activation. B. Non-canonical signaling pathways refer to the group of pathways induced
  by Wnt ligands that act via β-catenin-independent mechanisms. These include a pathway
  that activates the small GTPases, RhoA and Rac1, resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangement
  and activation of Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) and a pathway that induces PI3K and
  subsequent activation of Akt. Adapted from [].
