caption: Schematic representation of the proposed model. (A) The E3 ubiquitin ligase
  Cbl-b is expressed at low levels in high-invasive MDR gastric cancer and breast
  cancer cells. EGFR-activated ERK/Akt enhanced the expression of the E-cadherin transcription
  repressor ZEB1 through the downregulation of miR-200c. Downregulation of E-cadherin
  led to EMT and tumor metastasis. (B) Overexpression of Cbl-b inhibited EGFR and
  the downstream ERK/Akt signal by the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR. Inactivation
  of the EGFR pathway decreased the expression of the E-cadherin transcription repressor
  ZEB1 through the upregulation of miR-200c. E-cadherin is upregulated, and EMT and
  tumor metastasis are repressed.
