caption: Mechanism of action of the cholera toxin. CT binds to the ganglioside receptor
  on the host epithelial cells, triggers endocytosis of the holotoxin. The internalized
  CT moves from the endosomes to the Golgi complex and endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
  The catalytic CT-A1 polypeptide transfers from the ER to the cytosol by retro-translocation
  through the action of the ER-linked degradation pathway to activate the Gsα subunit
  of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory (Gαs) protein. Activation of Gαs-protein
  leads to increased adenylate cyclase (AC) activity, which cleaves ATP to cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and subsequently activates protein kinase-A (PKA).
  Activation of PKA inhibits NaCl absorption through Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE transporters)
  and phosphorylate the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
  chloride channel proteins, which leads to ATP-mediated efflux of chloride ions and
  induce secretion of , Na+, K+, and H2O. Loss of chloride ions induces massive fluid
  secretion in the small intestine, deposing the resorptive ability of the large intestine,
  which results in severe watery diarrhea.
