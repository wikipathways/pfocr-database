caption: Therapeutic mechanisms of nanomaterials in the intestine. A In the intestine
  of IBD patients, inflammatory regions accumulate large amounts of ROS produced by
  goblet cells (H2O2, O2·−, ·OH, 1O2). This signal activates Toll-like receptor-mediated
  NF-κB signaling pathway. At the same time, macrophages produce large amounts of
  TNF-α and activate more monocytes as well as Th1 cells, resulting in large levels
  of pro-inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α. Nanomaterials with antioxidant
  effect remove overexpressed ROS and convert them into water and oxygen. Meanwhile,
  the nano drug delivery system can release anti-inflammatory drugs in a targeted
  position, which inhibit TNF-α expression and induce Treg cells, Th2 cells to secrete
  IL-10, IL-25, TGF-β and other anti-inflammatory factors to relieve inflammation.
  B Mucosal damage is a sign of the intestinal tract in IBD patients. When goblet
  cells secrete insufficient amounts of AMP, MUC, the mucosal layer border is thinned
  or gapped. Pathogenic bacteria and their product LPS cross the mucosal barrier to
  induce an innate immune response. Immune cells such as dendritic cells produce pro-inflammatory
  factors IFN-γ and IL-6 in response to the inflammatory environment, resulting in
  mislocalization and reduced expression of tight junction proteins, further weakening
  the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Related functional nanomaterials
  or drug delivery systems increase the relative abundance of probiotics and contribute
  to the recovery of the mucosa and mucus layer by upregulating the expression of
  tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin). IL-1β interleukin-1β, IL-6 interleukin-6,
