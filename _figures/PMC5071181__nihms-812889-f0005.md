caption: Scheme of the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) signaling pathway modulated
  by ketamine. Prior to ketamine exposure, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity
  maintains GSK3 active, which phosphorylates post-synaptic density-95 (PSD-95) to
  promote intracellular trafficking of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic
  acid (AMPA) receptors. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptors, causing increased inhibitory
  serine-phosphorylation of GSK3, inhibiting its phosphorylation of PSD-95, leading
  to increased cellular membrane levels of the glutamate receptor (GluA)1 subunit
  of AMPA receptors. Dashed lines indicate signaling blocked by inhibition of GSK3
  after ketamine treatment.
