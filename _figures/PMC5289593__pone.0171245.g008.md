caption: 'During the day, photosynthetically fixed carbon is either exported to the
  cytosol as triose phosphates by means of TPT to be subsequently converted into sucrose,
  and/or retained within the chloroplast to fuel starch biosynthesis. Starch is then
  degraded to maltose and glucose molecules that are either exported to the cytosol
  via MEX1 and pGlcT, respectively, or recycled back to starch. This interpretation
  of leaf starch metabolism previews that (i) hexose-phosphates and/or ADPG occurring
  in the cytosol enter the chloroplast for subsequent conversion into starch, (ii)
  CBC and the pPGM-AGP-SS starch biosynthetic pathway are not connected by pPGI, and
  (iii) pPGM and AGP play important roles not only in the de novo synthesis of starch
  from the CBC, but also in the scavenging of starch breakdown products. The enzyme
  activities involved are numbered as follows: 1, pPGI; 2, pPGM; 3, AGP; 4, SS; 5,
  β-amylase; 6, AMY; 7, debranching enzymes; 8, DPE1; 9, SP; 10, hexokinase. Enzymatic
  reactions involved in starch cycling are indicated with red arrows.'
