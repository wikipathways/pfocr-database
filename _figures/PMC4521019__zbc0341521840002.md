caption: Regulation of hepcidin expression by iron and inflammation. Increasing saturation
  of TF, and subsequent binding to TFR1, causes HFE to be released from a complex
  with TFR1. HFE is postulated to interact with TFR2 and HJV, a BMP co-receptor, to
  stimulate SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, dimerization with SMAD4, and elevation of hepcidin
  transcription. The ligand BMP6 is thought to play a key role in this process. HFE
  also interacts with ALK3, a type I BMP receptor, and stabilizes it on the cell membrane.
  During periods of inflammation or infection, the cytokine IL-6 is produced, activating
  the STAT3 signaling pathway to promote transcription of hepcidin through a gp130-,
  JAK1/2-mediated pathway. Both the phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8-SMAD4 heterodimer and
  the STAT3 transcription factors have known binding sites in the hepcidin promoter,
  and the two pathways are believed to work together in hepcidin regulation. Other
  inflammation-mediated stimulatory signals may act to positively stimulate hepcidin
  expression.
