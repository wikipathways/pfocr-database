caption: Lipids as signaling molecules that regulate metabolism. Several signaling
  lipids, including fatty acids, fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs),
  diacylglycerol (DAG), and ceramides, regulate insulin sensitivity. (a) Saturated
  fatty acids (SFAs) activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), possibly via its co-receptor,
  myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2), which, through the adaptor proteins TIR
  domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) and myeloid differentiation
  primary response protein MYD88, increases the activity of pro-inflammatory transcription
  factors. TRIF activation promotes the nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) to increase the expression of cytokines. MYD88 activation increases
  phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) kinase (IKKβ), which further
  phosphorylates inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB), leading to nuclear translocation of NF-κB
  to increase pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. MYD88 also activates Jun N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) to increase the activity of transcription factor activator protein
  1 (AP1), thereby altering the expression of cytokines. Proinflammatory cytokines,
  through their receptors, further activate these proinflammatory transcription factors
  to establish a positive feedback loop for sustained inflammation. SFA-activated
  TLR4 and cytokine production impair insulin signaling through IKKβ and JNK activation.
  SFA-mediated activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the SRC–JNK pathway,
  and the incorporation of SFAs into DAG and ceramides also impair insulin signaling
  by inhibiting phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate
  1 (IRS1) or AKT. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) exert anti-inflammatory effects
  by activating G-protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120), which recruits β-arrestin
  2 and sequesters TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) to inhibit the TAK1-mediated activation
  of JNK and IKKβ. PUFA, FAHFAs, and resolvins may exert anti-inflammatory effects
  by activating G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in antigen-presenting cells such
  as macrophages to inhibit cytokine production. (b) DAG and ceramide may induce insulin
  resistance. DAG accumulates ectopically in insulin-resistant muscle and liver. In
  muscle, DAG-activated protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ) promotes the phosphorylation of IRS1
  on Ser1101 in mice, impairing IRS1 phosphorylation on tyrosine and attenuating insulin
  signaling. In the liver, DAG-activated PKCε promotes phosphorylation of IR on Thr1160
  to suppress insulin signaling. Elevated DAG impairs glucose uptake via reduced insulin-responsive
  glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in muscle, and glucose output via GLUT2 from the liver
  is increased; these changes induce hyperglycemia. Ceramides contribute to hyperglycemia
  by activating protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A), which dephosphorylates AKT, stimulating
  PKCλ and PKCζ, which prevent AKT membrane association, thereby inhibiting AKT activity.
