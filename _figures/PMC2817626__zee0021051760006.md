caption: Key signaling pathways involved in testosterone-mediated mitigation of sarcopenia
  in aging. Testosterone, though suppression myostatin, inhibits JNK but stimulates
  Akt signaling. Suppression of JNK promotes muscle growth by not only inhibiting
  muscle cell apoptosis but also stimulating cellular proliferation by attenuating
  myostatin-induced up-regulation of p21. Akt can promote muscle growth through direct
  activation of Notch signaling () as well as through modulation of multiple signaling
  molecules involved in both apoptotic and survival pathways in muscle remodeling
  (). Akt can also restrain caspase-2-mediated death pathway and promote muscle growth
  by stimulation of cellular metabolism (). Thus, testosterone through stimulation
  of survival pathway together with the inhibition of death pathway possibly restores
  the microenvironment and promotes muscle growth in aging.
