caption: Proposed model of cell signaling associated with the ALK5-SMAD2/3 tumor-suppressive
  arm identified by Monsivais et al. () and Kriseman et al. () in the uterus. TGF-βs
  and activins signal through TGFBR2/ALK5 and ACVR2A/ACVR2B/ALK4 receptor complexes,
  respectively. In contrast, BMPs signal through BMPR2/ACVR2A/ACVR2B and ALK1/2/3/6
  receptors, which impinge on SMAD1/5/8. Because cell signaling initiated both by
  activins and TGF-βs converges on SMAD2/3, ALK4 and ALK5 may play redundant roles
  in endometrial cancer development. The existence of antagonisms between tumor-suppressive
  TGF-β and oncogenic BMP signaling is supported by increased expression of BMP target
  genes in Smad2/3 cKO uteri (). It should be pointed out that the ligand-induced
  cell signaling, receptor utilization, and pathway interactions shown in this model
  require further experimental testing.
