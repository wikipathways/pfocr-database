caption: Rate diagram of transcription initiation. This figure was previously described
  in Ref. . The sequential pathway of transcription initiation shows RNA polymerase
  (R) first binds the promoter (P) to form a closed complex (RPc) with an equilibrium
  constant KB. RPc next isomerizes to form the open complex (RPo) with a forward rate
  constant k2 and a reverse rate constant k−2. The open complexes are competent at
  de novo initiation, and in the presence of NTP, forms initial transcribing complexes
  (designated by the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to indicate the position of the ITC) which
  abortively release their nascent RNAs to different degrees (as indicated by the
  length of the downward arrow). After some rounds of abortive initiation, all ITCs
  eventually escape with a rate constant kE to form ternary elongation complex (TEC)
  which can be processively elongated to form the full-length (FL) RNA. Here, kE,
  the rate constant of escape, is measured from pre-formed open complexes under single-cycle
  transcription condition as the rate of (short) FL RNA synthesis. As such, kE represents
  a composite constant which encompasses the rates of all of the abortive initiation
  steps before escape, the escape step itself, and the rates of all of the elongation
  steps (~20 steps) after escape. The sequential pathway predicts that every RNA polymerase
  molecule eventually escapes to synthesize the full-length RNA. The branched pathway
  model of transcription initiation shows the formation of productive and unproductive
  open complexes (RPo and RPo’, respectively) at a promoter. In the presence of NTP,
  RPo forms productive ITC which is capable of escape after some rounds of obligate
  abortive initiation. RPo’, however, forms unproductive ITCs (ITC’) that cannot escape
  and are trapped to perform continual abortive synthesis.
