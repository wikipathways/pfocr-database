caption: ROS in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cell death. ER stress induces
  an unfolded protein response (UPR), enhancing transcriptional activation of C/EBP-homologous
  protein (CHOP) and its target ER oxidation 1α (ERO1α). ERO1α activates IP3 receptor
  1 (IP3R1) and calcium release, which activates the calcium-/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase IIγ (CAMKIIγ)-JNK cascade and transcriptional upregulation of NOX2.
  NOX2 is also activated in an acidic compartment by signals derived from activation
  of pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, heterodimerizing
  with scavenger receptor CD36, and activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase(s).
  NOX2-derived ROS further activate CAMKIIγ-JNK, to enhance the UPR signal, thus contributing
  to the mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and induction of apoptosis. The CAMKIIγ-JNK
  cascade also induces Fas transcription, activating the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
