caption: 'Major subcategories of complex (glyco)sphingolipids produced by mammals
  from ceramides, organized by pathway of origin. Starting with ceramides (Cer) to
  the left of the diagram, each arrow depicts a headgroup addition by enzymes named
  in the text or cited references to produce the shown subcategories of complex sphingolipids,
  named (clockwise); GlucosylCer (GlcCer) and more complex glycosphingolipids as described
  below; GalactosylCer (GalCer) and others; the phosphosphingolipids Sphingomyelin
  (SM), Ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CerPE) and Ceramide 1-Phosphate (Cer1P); and
  1-O-Acyl-Cer. For the more complex glycosphingolipids, the position and type of
  linkage is also given (eg, formation of a glycosidic bond between Gal and the 4-hydroxyl-
  of GlcCer in beta-linkage produces Galβ4GlcβCer, which has the common name LactosylCer,
  LacCer). Depending on the next addition, the products are subcategorized as shown
  in the various polygons. LacCer can also undergo sulfation to "SM3) as shown at
  the bottom (note: the abbreviation does not designate it is a sphingomyelin), as
  shown at the bottom, and subcategorized as a "sulfatide," with other sulfated glycosphingolipids,
  such as sulfated GalCer, SM4. In the "Ganglio" subcategory, "Gangliosides" are generally
  named as compounds with one or more sialic acids (mainly N-acetylneuraminic acid
  for humans). Also given are some of the common names for these complex glycosphingolipids
  (eg, gangliosides GM3, GD2, etc.). When fucose is added to a glycosphingolipid,
  the term "Fucosyl-" can be added to the parent glycosphingolipid (as shown for Fucosyl-GM1
  in the lower right corner), or the compound might be referred to by a historically
  assigned name, such as Lewisx in this example. The symbols for these carbohydrates
  are given at the bottom (glucosyl-, Glc; N-acetylglucosamine, GlcNAc; galactosyl-,
  Gal; N-acetylgalactosylamine, GalNAc; N-acetylneuraminic acid, NeuAc; and Fucosyl-,
  Fuc) and have been adopted by the international glycan community; others (such as
  for SM, CerPE, etc.) are for illustrative purposes in this review'
