caption: Carbon fluxes, expressed in micromoles of carbon per gram per hour, operating
  during growth of L. lactis NCDO 2118 in minimal synthetic medium MS14. Carbon substrates
  present in the culture medium are in boldface roman type, identified excreted products
  are in boldface italic type, supposed excreted products are in lightface italic
  type, and dashed arrows show possible pathways which could lead to glycine formation
  (maximum and minimum carbon flux values are given for the concerned products, depending
  on the operative pathway for glycine synthesis). P, phosphate; diP, diphosphate;
  PRPP, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate.
