caption: The M. tuberculosis mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway. The C48–C54 meromycolate
  chain is biosynthesized by FAS-II through the processive addition of multiple malonate
  units onto C16–C26 precursors generated by FAS-I. The initial substrates of FAS-II
  are thus medium length keto-acyl-ACP resulting from the condensation by the M. tuberculosis
  FabH protein of the acyl-CoA products of FAS-I with malonyl-ACP. After reduction
  by the β-keto-acyl-ACP reductase MabA, dehydration by the (3R)-hydroxyacyl dehydratases
  HadAB and HadBC, and reduction by the enoyl-CoA reductase InhA, either the β-ketoacyl-ACP
  synthase KasA or KasB catalyzes the condensation of the resulting product with malonyl-ACP
  units, thereby initiating the next round of elongation. The products of FAS-II may
  undergo further elongation and functional modifications of the meromycolic acid
  chain, catalyzed in part by S-adenosyl methionine-dependent methyltransferases (MmaA1,
  MmaA2, MmaA3, MmaA4, CmaA1, CmaA2, PcaA, UmaA), prior to the Pks13/FadD32-mediated
  condensation of the activated α-branch with the meromycolic acid chain to yield
  the full-size mycolic β-ketoester. Pks13 transfers mycolic β-ketoester to trehalose
  prior to reduction by the CmrA reductase yielding mature TMM. TmaT acetylates the
  mycolic acid in TMM prior to its export by MmpL3 and other potential components
  of a translocation machinery spanning the mycobacterial cell envelope. The mycolyltransferases
  encoded by fbpA, fbpB and fbpC catalyze the transfer of mycolic acids from TMM to
  arabinogalactan (AG), or to another TMM molecule generating TDM. Proteins in red
  font were tested individually for interaction with MmpL3 by BATCH two-hybrid system.
