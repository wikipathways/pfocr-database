caption: Insulin signaling pathway schematic. Insulin binds to the extracellular IR
  domain, inducing autophosphorylation of the intracellular domain, leading to recruitment
  and phosphorylation of IRS1. Regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85α, gets recruited to
  the bound IRS1, and activates the catalytic subunit, p110. Active PI3K converts
  PIP2 into PIP3 thereby recruiting PDK1 and Akt, resulting in phosphorylation of
  Akt on Thr308. Full activation of Akt occurs after phosphorylation on Ser473 by
  mTORC2. Active Akt inhibits GSK3β by Ser9 phosphorylation, therefore relieving the
  inhibition on Glycogen synthase (GS). Active Akt also leads to translocation of
  the glucose transporter GLUT4 from intracellular pools towards the membrane, where
  it allows glucose uptake. The stress response proteins, JNK and p38 MAPK, are activated
  by mitochondrial-generated ROS and result in inhibition of the insulin signaling
  pathway. Schematic created by Rabab Al-Lahham in BioRender.com
