caption: Bile acids activate the EGF receptor leading to activation of Src. This in
  turn activates the PERK pathway as part of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR).
  BiP dissociates from PERK which dimerises and become phosphorylated which in turn
  phosphorylates eIF2α. This suppresses protein translation to reduce the burden on
  the ER, but also facilitates the translation of genes associated with ER stress
  recovery such as BiP, ATF3 and CHOP. DCA CDCA and LCA also induce Golgi fragmentation
  via activation of Src. Activation of the UPR may occur initially and subsequently
  cause Golgi fragmentation but once affected Golgi fragmentation would result in
  impaired protein glycosylation resulting in misfolded proteins that have to be sent
  back to the ER for re-processing. This could result in a sustained perturbance of
  the protein secretory pathway. Induction of ER stress could lead to Golgi fragmentation
  by either suppressing translation of a protein crucial for maintenance of Golgi
  structure via peIF2, or as a consequence of ER stress-induced apoptosis, if ER homeostasis
  is not restored. Bile acid disruption of normal cell homeostasis through their effects
  on the protein secretory pathway may lead to the selection of apoptotic resistant
  cell populations that have adapted to survive with a sustained UPR and fragmented
  Golgi. This suggests a novel mechanism for bile acid contribution to tumourigenesis,
  which could be exploited as novel therapeutic strategy.
