caption: Simplified schema showing how genes might affect clinical responses to targeted
  therapies. Various genes with associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
  could be generally categorized into various pathogenic mechanisms (for example,
  tumor necrosis factor (TNF), T cells, B cells, others in this version). A particular
  individual might only inherit a subset of each of these SNPs. If the majority of
  inherited SNPs cluster in one mechanism, such as TNF blocker (see bottom rows),
  then the individual would have a response to the agent that targets this pathway.
  If the SNPs are not enriched for any particular pathway, then the patient would
  be a nonresponder. This schema only focuses on SNPs, but would be integrated with
  pathways that are enriched for epigenetic marks or other regulators of gene expression/function.
