caption: Comparison of chloroethylmalonyl-CoA and ethylmalonyl-CoA biosynthetic pathways.
  (A) Proposed pathway to chloroethylmalonyl-CoA as a PKS extender unit in salinosporamide
  A biosynthesis. (B) The corresponding ethylmalonyl-CoA moiety in salinosporamide
  B is derived from acetate (). Crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase (CCR) is a key
  enzyme in the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway ().
