caption: 'Selection of expression patterns and activities of members of the cadherin
  superfamily in cancer. Three cell types are partly depicted: a cancer cell, an endothelial
  cell, and another type of stromal cell. Protein domains in green are strongly homologous
  to those in the prototypic E-cadherin/CDH1. Domains in other colors deviate substantially
  in structure and function. Black dots represent Ca2+ ions. Arrows with minus sign
  symbols refer to direct or indirect inhibitory influences. Cadherins shown at the
  cancer cell surface are expressed at the apical membrane (T-cadherin/CDH13 above
  the tight junction, TJ), or at lateral membranes (E-cadherin/CDH1, N-cadherin/CDH2,
  cadherin-11/CDH11). The latter three probably occur as cis-homodimers. CDH1 is frequently
  inactivated in cancer cells, whereas the “mesenchymal” cadherins CDH2 and CDH11
  are often up-regulated. CDH2 can interact with fibroblast growth factor receptor
  (FGFR), potentiating its signaling through the enzymes MAPK, PLCγ, and PI3K. Cadherins
  are prone to proteolytic processing (scissors symbols), which releases either the
  ectodomain or a carboxy-terminal fragment (CTF). In the case of CDH2, this CTF has
  been shown to enter the nucleus and inhibit the CREB binding protein (CBP). On neural
  activation, CDH2 and CDH11 associate with protocadherin-8 (PCDH8 or Arcadlin), which
  results in activation of the MAPKKK TAO2β, eventually leading to endocytosis of
  the cadherins. PCDH8 is often silenced in cancer cells, but it is unclear whether
  this is causally linked to up-regulation of mesenchymal cadherins. The transcriptional
  activity of β-catenin (β-ctn) in a nuclear complex with LEF/TCF, leads, amongst
  other effects, to androgen receptor (AR)-independent prostate cancer growth. This
  phenomenon is inhibited by sequestration of β-ctn by E-cadherin or by degradation
  of β-ctn after phosphorylation (-P) by GSK3β. Degradation of β-ctn occurs in a cytoplasmic
  degradation complex with APC (adenomatous polyposis coli protein), Axin, and Disheveled
  (DSH). However, nuclear β-ctn-LEF/TCF activity is stimulated by an unknown mechanism
  by a cytoplasmic variant of protocadherin-11Y (PCDH11Y) lacking a signal peptide
  because of a truncated aminoterminus (ΔN). Tumor-associated endothelial cells express
  VE-cadherin/CDH5, CDH2, and T-cadherin/CDH13. The latter is linked to the PM via
  a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and signals via secreted Grp78/BiP to
  an anti-apoptotic PI3K-AKT pathway. Dachsous-1 (DCHS1) and FAT4 are both huge cadherin-related
  proteins, interacting with each other in heterophilic (different protein types)
  and heterotypic (different cell types) ways. Silencing of human FAT4 is seen in
  breast cancer and its activation is linked in an unresolved way to the Hippo-YAP
  pathway, which controls organ size in Drosophila and is affected in several human
  cancers. See text for details and references. (a.o.) Amongst others; (EC) extracellular
  cadherin repeat; (PM) plasma membrane; (TK) tyrosine kinase domain.'
