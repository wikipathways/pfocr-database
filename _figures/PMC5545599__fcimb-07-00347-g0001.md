caption: Overview of the purinergic pathway. From the cytoplasm to the extracellular
  space, ATP can be released via pannexin 1 (PanX1) or connexin hemichannels present
  on the cell membrane. Once in the extracellular environment, ATP is rapidly converted
  to ADP and AMP by alkaline phosphatases (AP), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatases/phosphodiesterases
  (ENPPs) or ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases which includes the ectonucleoside
  triphosphate diphosphorylase 1 (CD39). AMP is then converted to adenosine via the
  ecto-5′-nucleotidase CD73. Finally, adenosine is metabolized into inosine by the
  adenosine deaminase (ADA). Adenosine can be reversely converted into AMP by adenosine
  kinase (AK). In terms of receptors, ATP binds P2 receptors (either the membrane
  ion-channels P2X or the G protein-coupled receptors P2Y), ADP preferentially binds
  the P2Y receptors and adenosine binds the G protein-coupled receptors P1 also known
  as ADORAs. Asterisks correspond to enzymes that can be extracellular or at the surface
  of the cell membrane (Velasquez and Eugenin, ).
