caption: 'Phagocytosis mediated by receptors. Microglial phagocytosis needs principally
  two type receptors: TREM2 and TLRs. TREM2 recognizes apoptotic cell debris and,
  through the binding to DAP12, induces F-actin reorganization and ERK phosphorylation,
  resulting in apoptotic neuron clearance. TLRs recognize structurally conserved molecules
  of microbes, DAMPs and α-synuclein. The activation of TLRs results in the induction
  of the MyD88-dependent pathway that, through IRAK-4 and p38 phosphorylation, induces
  the upregulation of scavenger receptors. TLRs also contribute to phagocytosis through
  a MyD88-independent actin-Cdc42/Rac pathway. However, P2Y6 receptor also contributes
  to UDP-evoked microglial phagocytosis through the activation of phospholipase C
  (PLC) that in turn triggers InsP3 synthesis-dependent Ca2+ release from InsP3-receptor-sensitive
  stores. In addition, P2Y6-receptor-dependent signaling promotes actin cytoskeleton
  polarization facilitating the engulfment of cell debris.'
