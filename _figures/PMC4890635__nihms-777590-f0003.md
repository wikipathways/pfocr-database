caption: SOX9 is downstream effector of ERG and AR in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion-positive
  PCa. SOX9 expression can be stimulated by extracellular signals including FGFs and
  HGF (mediated by their receptors and downstream ERK), and by WNTs though the canonical
  WNT/β-catenin pathway. AR in fusion-negative cells binds weakly to a site 5′ of
  the SOX9 gene (S1 site) and can weakly repress basal SOX9 expression (possibly by
  displacing positive transcription factors). In fusion-positive cells, ERG binds
  to a cryptic ARE 3′ of the SOX9 gene, with subsequent binding of FOXA1 and strong
  androgen-stimulated SOX9 expression.
