caption: Polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) activates
  the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and causes the release of norepinephrine (NE)
  from the sympathetic fibers in the gut. The NE then enters into the circulation
  and travels through the portal vein into the liver. While in the liver, NE binds
  to the α2A-adrenoceptors (α2A-AR) and activates the signaling pathway(s) responsible
  for the production and release of TNF-α, IL-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines
  from Kupffer cells and thereby produces hepatic dysfunction. Ghrelin, a stomach-derived
  peptide, reaches the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) in the brain by crossing the blood-brain
  barrier, stimulates GHSR-1a receptors, activates the vagus nerve and in turn, through
  the cholinergic pathways, downregulates TNF-α and IL-6 release from macrophages
  such as Kupffer cells in the liver possibly by increasing cAMP levels and restoring
  MKP-1. While activating the cholinergic pathway, ghrelin can inhibit the SNS, decrease
  the release of the sympathetic neurotransmitter, NE, and cause the downregulation
  of TNF-α and IL-6 from the macrophages. Therefore, ghrelin’s beneficial effect in
  sepsis by inhibiting the TNF-α and iL-6 release from Kupffer cells in the liver
  is mediated by the concerted efforts of the sympathetic and the parasympathetic
  nervous systems.
