caption: A) IFN-γ binds to the IFN-γ receptor (IFNGR) leading to JAK1/2 phosphorylation.
  JAK1/2 phosphorylates STAT1 which translocates to the nucleus and cooperates with
  other transcription factors, like IRF-1 to activate promoter IV of CIITA. CIITA
  is then translated and returns to the nucleus (not shown) where it acts as a scaffold
  for RFX family members and drives transcription of MHC-II related genes such as
  HLA-DR, DP, DQ, invariant chain (Ii), and HLA-DM. MHC-II alpha and beta chains are
  assembled and complexed with Ii in the endoplasmic reticulum. MHC-II bound to Ii
  and associated with HLA-DM bud off in a vesicle. Ii targets this vesicle to the
  acidic endosomal compartment. In the acidic environment, Ii is degraded to CLIP.
  HLA-DM catalyzes the release of CLIP and binding of antigen. Stabilized peptide:MHC-II
  complexes translocate to the cell surface where MHC-II can present antigen to CD4
  T cells. B) MHC-I is generally constitutively expressed. Cytosolic proteins are
  degraded by the proteasome into peptide antigens. These antigens are loaded into
  the ER by TAP1/TAP2 transporter proteins where they can be loaded onto the assembled
  MHC-I alpha chain and β2M complex. This complex is transported through the Golgi
  (not shown) to the cell surface where it can present peptide antigens to CD8+ T
  cells.
