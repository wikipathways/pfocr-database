caption: A model for wingless actions presynaptically and postsynaptically at the
  NMJ of Drosophila. a, Without a wingless signal, presynaptic dishevelled remains
  in an inactive state, and shaggy remains active, thereby preventing assembly of
  microtubule loops, probably by phosphorylation of futsch. Terminals therefore contain
  punctate futsch and depolymerized or disordered microtubules. The formation of additional
  boutons is blocked. b, Wingless signaling at the Drosophila NMJ activates two different
  intracellular cascades. Postsynaptically, the C-terminal cleavage of the receptor
  frizzled2 takes place, possibly after wg binds to its receptor-coreceptor complex
  frizzled2/arrow. The C terminus translocates to the muscle nucleus in a process
  requiring GRIP (; ). At the presynaptic arbor, wingless binds to the frizzled2/arrow
  complex and activates dishevelled. The glycogen synthase kinase shaggy is thereby
  blocked, which permits futsch to promote the organization of microtubules into loops,
  the budding of new boutons, and synaptic growth.
