caption: Schematic shows the regulation of CCK-BR on IA and the involvement of CCK-8/CCK-BR
  in pain sensitivity. CCK-8 stimulates the Go-protein coupled CCK-BR and thereafter
  releases the βγ subunits (Gβγ). The released Gβγ subsequently activates PI3K, which
  decreases the IA and induces neuronal hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity.
  PI3K catalyzes the conversion of PtdIns(4,5)P2 (PIP2) to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3),
  which serves as a second messenger that helps to activate Akt. However, neither
  PKA/PKC/Akt nor the direct binding of Gβγ with A-type channels contributes to the
  CCK-BR-mediated IAresponse. In mouse DRG neurons, PI3K signaling may activate Src,
  which then phosphorylates JNK to modulate IA. Whether the activated p-JNK would
  phosphorylates Kv channels encoding IA or in turn stimulated intermediate molecules
  still needs further examined
