caption: 'Potential therapeutic roles of LXR activation in MS. (A) Intracellular cholesterol
  levels in the brain are tightly regulated by two transcription factors (): 1. Liver-X-receptor
  (LXR) and sterol response element binding-protein 2 (SREBP-2). SREBP2 upregulates
  genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol in the brain is produced
  de novo mainly by glial cells such as astrocytes using the Bloch pathway. Neurons
  which have a high cholesterol requirement produce less cholesterol via the Kandutsch-Russell
  pathway. 2. LXR is activated by by-products of cholesterol synthesis (oxysterols).
  3. LXR activation promotes cholesterol export via intracellular cholesterol transporter
  Niemann Pick Type C1 and 2 (NPC1/NPC2), and ATP binding cassette (ABC) A1 and ABCG1
  which efflux cholesterol from the plasma membrane to high density lipoprotein (HDL)-like
  lipoproteins including apolipoprotein-E (Apo-E). 4. Cholesterol is taken up by cells
  via lipoprotein receptors. Excess cellular cholesterol (potentially generated by
  neurodegeneration processes) is stored in lipid droplets or converted into oxysterols.
  24-S hydroxycholesterol is the most abundant oxysterol in the brain and its production
  is catalyzed by the enzyme Cyp46A1 (cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase). 24-S hydroxycholesterol
  is able to cross the blood brain barrier to the periphery where it is degraded in
  the liver. 5. LXR also promotes fatty acid synthesis through its target genes SREBP1c,
  fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). Plasma membrane levels
  of cholesterol and fatty acids can influence lipid rafts-membrane microdomains important
  for immune synapse formation and immune cell activation and function. Fatty acid
  (glycosphingolipid) abundance and composition can also influence plasma membrane
  fluidity (). (B) LXRβ expression is elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
  from MS patients potentially due to increased levels of oxysterols including 24S-hydroxycholesterol.
  Increased LXR activation can also be triggered by myelin uptake by glial cells in
  the central nervous system (CNS). LXR activation induces reverse cholesterol transport
  (A, 4). Patients with MS have altered lipoprotein profiles which may reflect defects
  in the efficacy of this process. MS progression is associated with reduced levels
  of high density lipoproteins (HDL)- responsible for effective cholesterol efflux.
  LXR activation also induces fatty acid and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis (A, 5).
  Changes in cellular cholesterol and glycosphingolipids can alter immune cell function
  by altering cell signaling and downstream functions including proliferation and
  cytokine production. In T-cells LXR activation reduces T-cell infiltration into
  the CNS () and inhibits naïve CD4+ T-cell differentiation towards an inflammatory
  Th17 phenotype () and suppressed IL-9 producing CD8+ T cells during anti-tumor responses
  (). LXR activation is crucial for Treg function (). LXR activation stimulates oligodendrocyte
  myelin production and remyelination processes (). Mechanisms include stimulation
  of reverse cholesterol transport and fatty acid synthesis. LXR activation leads
  to the repression of inflammatory responses through the downregulation of pro-inflammatory
  genes including inducible nitric oxide synthase (NO), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6
  and tumor necrosis factor-α. Myelin uptake by macrophages activates LXR and suppresses
  the production these pro-inflammatory mediators These myelin-laden macrophages,
  express high levels of anti-inflammatory IL-1-receptor-α, IL-10, CC-chemokine ligand-18
  and transforming growth factor-β ().'
