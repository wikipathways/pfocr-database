caption: Graphical abstract. Note that less pulmonary surfactant secretion leads to
  exposed TLR4 receptors on alveolar cells. HMGB1 released from lysed cells can also
  activate TLR4 causing excessive inflammation and fibrosis. The same model applies
  to a cardiac cell, except that there would be no pulmonary surfactants, and instead
  of the outside air, it would be the extracellular matrix. In the heart, TLR4 activation
  by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and/or DAMPs released from infected, necrotic cells or even
  upregulated at sites of injury may also cause abnormal signalling towards the canonical
  proinflammatory pathway rather than the alternative anti-inflammatory pathway. This
  would cause viral myocarditis. TLR4 activation also decreases the contractility
  of cardiomyocytes. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 may activate TLR4 to increase PI3K/Akt
  signalling in infected cells, preventing apoptosis and thus increasing time for
  viral replication. Aberrant inflammatory signalling could also be extended to other
  tissues expressing TLR4, such as the skin and kidney, where the virus would therefore
  cause multiple-organ injury.
