caption: Schematic representation of putative roles of 5-HT receptor modulation of
  neuronal properties in Aplysia californica. The sensory neuron to motor neuron synapse
  involved in withdrawal reflexes is used as an example. After stimulation, facilitatory
  serotonergic interneurons release 5-HT that binds 5-HT receptors (5-HTGPCR). The
  final effect of 5-HT may depend on the specific expression patterns of 5-HT receptors
  and signaling molecules within different cells. Binding of 5-HT to a Gs-coupled
  receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase (AC; pink pathway). Activation of the cyclase
  increases the cAMP concentration and induces activation of the cyclic AMP-dependent
  protein kinase A (PKA; activation is indicated by an arrow). Activation of PKA can
  phosphorylate and covalently modify a number of target proteins, including components
  of the exocytotic machinery of release, to enhance transmitter availability and
  release. With repeated stimulation, PKA can recruit the extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK, MAPK), and can translocate to the nucleus where it phosphorylates the
  cyclic AMP response element binding proteins (CREBs). Phosphorylation by ERK of
  the repressor isoform CREB-2 removes its inhibition on CREB-1a. Phosphorylation
  of CREB-1a induces transcription of early/late genes containing cyclic AMP response
  elements, leading to growth of new synaptic connections and potentially transmitter
  release. Gs-coupled receptor might also activate ERK (blue pathway) by transactivation
  of receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., Trk, which can be activated by neurotrophins),
  or by direct activation of the ERK cascade. To turn down the release of 5-HT from
  interneurons, Gi-coupled receptors might act as presynaptic autoreceptors (inhibition
  is indicated by ⊣). When expressed at the surface of sensory neurons, Gi-coupled
  receptors can inhibit the Gs-dependent activation of the cyclase and turn down the
  cascade (red pathway). Under sustained release of 5-HT, Gi-coupled receptors might
  complement the activation of the ERK pathway by transactivation of Trks or direct
  activation of ERK components. Besides the PKA-signal pathway, there is a phospholipase
  C-PKC signaling pathway activated by 5-HT receptors (beige pathway). Gq-coupled
  receptor-activated phospholipase C (PLC) produces diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol
  triphosphate (IP3) by cleaving the phosphatidyl inositol PIP2. IP3 is water-soluble,
  and can diffuse into the cytoplasm. There it binds to a receptor on the endoplasmic
  reticulum to release Ca2+ from internal stores. DAG remains in the membrane, where
  it activates the protein kinase C (PKC). Gq-coupled receptors might also be capable
  of enhancing the activation of the ERKs. For clarity only, two different sets of
  Trk receptors and ERK appear on the figure; there is no evidence that Gi-, Gs-,
  or Gq-activated pathways modulate distinct pools of ERK. Transmitter availability
  and release can also be dependent on activation of other signaling molecules (e.g.,
  PKC, Ca2+) as shown by gray arrows. Speculative interactions are represented by
  (- - -). The molecular mechanisms underlying serotonergic modulation of MNs are
  still poorly understood and were omitted on this diagram.
