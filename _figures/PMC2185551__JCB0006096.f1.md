caption: Apoptotic pathways leading to caspase activation, loss of plasma membrane
  lipid asymmetry, and sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Two pathways for apoptosis are shown.
  In Pathway 1, activation of death receptors, such as Fas/CD95, recruits a complex
  composed of adapter molecules (FADD) and the proform of an initiator caspase. This
  activates the caspase, which in turn cleaves and activates executioner caspases.
  These, or possibly the initiator caspase itself (see text) trigger scrambling of
  the plasma membrane via an unknown mechanism. This brings sphingomyelin to the inner
  leaflet, where it is hydrolyzed by sphingomyelinases in the cell. This results in
  ceramide generation and in a loss of sphingomyelin from the membrane. The latter,
  in turn, causes a loss of cholesterol, which alters plasma membrane fluidity. Ceramide
  may also perform signaling functions, although the importance of this aspect is
  untested. In Pathway 2, cellular stress (or other proapoptotic signals) trigger
  proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members to target mitochondria and cause the release of
  cytochrome c. The latter catalyzes the activation of adapter molecules (Apaf-1)
  which recruit and activate initiator caspases. These, in turn, cleave and activate
  executioner caspases. Again, the caspases trigger lipid scrambling, sphingomyelin
  internalization and hydrolysis, and the resultant membrane changes.
