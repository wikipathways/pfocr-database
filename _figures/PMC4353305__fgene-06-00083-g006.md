caption: 'Synthesis and metabolism of glutathione and its regulation by the circadian
  system. GSH synthesis occurs via two sequential reactions: (i) ligation of l-glutamate
  and l-cysteine is catalyzed by the activity of GCL, and (ii) the addition of glycine
  to γ-glutamylcysteine by the activity of glutathione synthetase. GCL is a heterodimer
  composed of a catalytic subunit (GCLc) and a modulatory subunit (GCLm). Degradation
  of GSH involves cleavage by trans-peptidase, followed by the cleavage of cysteinyl-glycine
  by a dipeptidase, forming Cys-Gly and cysteine respectively. Cysteine is supplied
  via trans-sulfuration pathway and as a product of GSH degradation. GSH is oxidized
  by H2O2 to its disulphide, GSSG. Methionine is the precursor for cysteine synthesis,
  in which homocysteine is an intermediate. GSH is also used for detoxification in
  reactions catalyzed by GSTs, which expression is also rhythmic (). A clock image
  denotes genes regulated by the circadian clocks. Cycling components of the glutathione
  synthesis and utilization systems are shown in gray.'
