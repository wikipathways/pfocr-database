caption: Proposed model of the molecular mechanism leading to the high accumulation
  of resveratrol after treatment with UV-C in Polygonum cuspidatum leaf. Deamination
  of phenylalanine ammonia by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first step
  in the resveratrol biosynthesis pathway. Then, the conversions of cinnamic acid
  into p-coumaric acid and subsequently into 4-coumarate-CoA are catalyzed by cinnamic
  acid 4-hydroxylase (C4H) and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), respectively. The last
  step in the pathway consists of the conversion of one 4-coumarate-CoA and three
  malonyl-CoA units into resveratrol or naringenin chalcone by stilbene synthase (STS)
  or chalcone synthase (CHS), respectively. Later, resveratrol is converted into pterostilbene
  by resveratrol O-methyltransferase (ROMT). PAL, C4H, 4CL and STS were found strongly
  up-regulated in PC6H and PC12H as compared to PC, while CHS displayed the opposite
  trend. STS and CHS share the same substrate. P. cuspidatum tends to prioritize resveratrol
  accumulation by diverting the substrate “one 4-coumarate-CoA and three malonyl-CoA
  units” to the resveratrol synthesis pathway over the naringenin chalcone synthesis
  pathway through up-regulation of STS genes and down-regulation of CHS genes in response
  to UV-C exposure. High induction of ROMT also suggests that pterostilbenes may also
  be accumulated. PC, PC6H and PC12H represent samples collected before, 6 h and 12
  h after UV-C treatment, respectively.
