caption: Model of ER alpha nuclear export in breast cancer cells. A model of ER alpha
  nuclear export in breast cancer MCF-7 cells based on experimental evidence from
  our laboratory is shown. Estradiol-stimulated PI3K/Akt pathway leads to FKHR phosphorylation
  at Ser 256, thus triggering the associated export of FKHR/ER. Export of FKHR/ER
  removes the transcriptional repressor activity of FKHR and triggers DNA synthesis
  (Lombardi et al. ). This model is compatible with findings showing that methylation
  of ER alpha by PRMT1 tethers the receptor in cytoplasm of MCF-7 cells, where it
  recruits and activates Src, PI3-K and FAK (Le Romancer et al. )
