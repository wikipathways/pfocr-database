caption: A) Schematic representation of major cellular degradation pathways. Many
  ALS/FTD-linked proteins are involved in protein clearance pathway, including B)
  ubiquilin-2 (UBQLN2) and p62/SQSTM1 (which bind to polyubiquitinated proteins and
  transport them to proteasome for degradation) and C) p62/SQSTM1 and optineurin (OPTN)
  (which serve as adaptor proteins to bind simultaneously the substrates that are
  targeted for autophagy and LC3, a component of autophagosomes). D) Fig4 is a lipid
  phosphatase that converts PI(3,5)P into PI3P. Autophagy is impaired in the neurons
  and astrocytes missing Fig4, with the disturbance of PIPs expected to disrupt formation
  or recycling of autolysosomes. E) ALS/FTD-linked mutations in CHMP2B, a core component
  of endosomal sorting complexes (ESCRT) required for transport, disrupt the normal
  endosome-lysosome-autophagy morphology and function. ESCRT complexes bind to ubiquitinated
  cargos and initiate clustering of ubiquitinated cargos and membrane invagination.
  The internalized cargos, which are cell membrane proteins, are transported into
  autophagosomes for degradation. F) VCP interacts with a large number of cofactor
  proteins that act as ubiquitin adaptors, allowing VCP to interact with a large number
  of ubiquitinated proteins to enable degradation or recycling, including extraction
  of misfolded proteins from the ER and subsequently targeting them for degradation.
  G) VAPB is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) by modulating activities
  of different arms of the UPR.
