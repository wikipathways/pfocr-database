caption: 'Pathway 1: VV infects immature and/or mature DCs which travel to draining
  lymph nodes and express co-stimulatory proteins and MHC class I/PSA (1a) where they
  trigger activation and proliferation of PSA-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes (1b), which
  then circulate to tumor sites and kill tumor cells through programmed cell death
  (PCD) (1c). Pathway 2: VV infects somatic cells (2a) which then directly activate
  PSA-specific CTLs (2b), and NK cells (2b’) , which then induce PCD of somatic cells
  (2c and 2c’) which are then taken up by DCs that are activated by viral components
  to mature and cross-present PSA (2d). These DCs further stimulate PSA-specific CTL
  activation (2e) that cause PCD of tumor cells (2f).'
