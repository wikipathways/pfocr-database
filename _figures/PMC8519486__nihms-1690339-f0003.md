caption: NO signaling from VEC stimulates VIC quiescence through activation of GC/cGMP
  pathway and subsequent downregulation of RhoA pathway. It also prevents calcification
  through assisting with Notch1 translocation to the nucleus. eNOS uncoupling causes
  endothelial dysfunction, such that there is little to no NO signaling to VIC, increasing
  myofibroblastic activation and calcification. ROS is known to induce cell damage,
  Superoxide can further cause oxidative stress in VEC and VIC. Thick arrows are VIC-VEC
  signaling, thin are intracellular or autocrine VEC effects.
