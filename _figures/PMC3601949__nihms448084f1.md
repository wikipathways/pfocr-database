caption: a | Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Shown here
  are 12 membrane-spanning segments of CFTR plus two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs
  1 and 2) and a regulatory R domain. CFTR activation involves cyclic AMP-dependent
  phosphorylation and binding of ATP molecules at the NBDs. b | The overall organization
  of voltage-gated chloride (ClC) channels is depicted, showing 18 segments (labelled
  A to R) most of which span the plasma membrane partially and in a strongly tilted
  configuration. Fast gating involves flipping of a pore-lining glutamate side chain
  into and out of the chloride pathway. Channels are arranged as dimers with a slow
  gate controlling the activity of both channels simultaneously. c | The calcium-activated
  chloride channel (CaCC) TMEM16A (anoctamin-1), with predicted topology showing eight
  transmembrane segments with cytosolic amino and carboxy termini. The mechanism of
  calcium activation is unknown. d | GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) and glycine-gated
  chloride channels, showing pentameric channels formed by α, β and γ subunits. Each
  subunit has four transmembrane segments, with a large extracellular N terminus.
  The second transmembrane segment of each subunit contributes to the formation of
  the central pore. The N termini of the α and β subunits form the ligand binding
  site. Volume-sensitive chloride channels (not shown) have an unknown molecular structure.
  They activate upon cell swelling. CBS, cystathione β-synthase-related domain.
