caption: '[LM4] Designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs)-based
  tools aimed at G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) allosterism. (A) Engineered-functionally
  selective DREADDs can provide valuable information regarding the complexity of GPCRs
  in relation to their signaling and pharmacology. (B) After determining which signaling
  pathway has potential clinical properties, these DREADD variants could directly
  be applied to in vivo systems. (C) The results of this approach would provide insights
  into new therapeutic possibilities and novel profiles of drugs against GPCR targets.'
