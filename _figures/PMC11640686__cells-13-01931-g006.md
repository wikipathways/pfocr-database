caption: 'Schematic representation of chemically induced reprogramming of RPE into
  neural stem cells and into neurons in the brain and retina [12,27,46,93]. Chemically
  induced reprogramming utilized small molecules that acted on the cellular epigenome
  (Epi) and on various signaling pathways that control cellular identity (TGFβ, GSK3β,
  WNT, BMP, NOTCH, PKC, and others). Fh—fetal human; Mn—cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca
  fascicularis); MPTP hydrochloride—induced Parkinson’s disease model; PPI—implantation
  into posterior putamen; sphere—free floating conditions; for other abbreviations,
  refer to Figure 3 and Figure 5. Pathway activators: green color; pathway inhibitors:
  red color'
