caption: (a) Bipartite graph representation for the three reactions, HEX1, PGI and
  PFK, in the glycolytic pathway. In the figure, reactions are depicted as rectangles
  and metabolites as ovals. Reversible reactions are shown in grey and irreversible
  reactions in yellow. The primary or other metabolites (cyan ovals) are distinguished
  from currency metabolites (pink ovals) in each reaction. If a reaction is reversible,
  then the links connecting the reaction to its reactant and product metabolites have
  arrows in both directions. (b) Unipartite metabolite graph representation for the
  three reactions in the glycolytic pathway. Note that before constructing the directed
  unipartite graph from the bipartite graph, we remove the currency metabolites.
