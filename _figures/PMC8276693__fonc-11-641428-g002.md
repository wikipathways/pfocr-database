caption: CTLA-4 and PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor pathways. (A) CTLA-4 pathway. In this
  pathway strong TCR-HMC and CD28-B7 binding signals initiate the exocytosis of the
  CTLA-4 from the intracellular vesicles to the T cell surface. As CLTA-4 has a higher
  binding affinity then CD28 for B7, this results in a net negative signal that results
  in reduced T cell proliferation, survival and a decrease in growth cytokines such
  as IL-2. (B) In the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway TCR-HMC signalling up regulates both PD-1
  and interferon-​γ (IFNƴ) expression. The increased of IFNƴ in the tumor microenvironment
  activates the signalling pathway of Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator
  of transcription (STAT) which activates the transcription factor interferon regulatory
  factor 1 (IRF1), which in turn induces PD-L1 expression. PD-1/PD-L1 interaction
  results in in a net negative signal and ultimately reduced T cell survival, proliferation
  and cytotoxic production. Possible antibody drug targets in both pathways are indicated
  showing antibody-target interaction (within black boxes).

    In this pathway strong TCR-HMC and CD28-B7 binding signals initiate the exocytosis
    of the CTLA-4 from the intracellular vesicles to the T cell surface. As CLTA-4
    has a higher binding affinity then CD28 for B7, this results in a net negative

    up regulates both PD-1 and interferon-​γ (IFNƴ) expression. The increased of IFNƴ
    in the tumor microenvironment activates the signalling pathway of Janus kinase
    (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) which activates
    the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), which in turn
    induces PD-L1 expression. PD-1/PD-L1 interaction results in in a net negative
