caption: Signal transduction and targets in psoriasis. (A) Fumaric acid esters (FAEs)
  lead to the release of NRF2, which induce and repress the expression of cytoprotective
  and proinflammatory cytokine genes, respectively. Also, FAEs directly inhibit NF-κB,
  and indirectly through induced HO-1 or inhibition of MSK1. (B) PDE4 inhibition results
  in increased cAMP, activating PKA and subsequent phosphorylation of the transcription
  factors CREB and ATF-1, which lead to increased gene expression of anti-inflammatory
  cytokines, and inhibition of NF-κB due to competition of the coactivators (CBP or
  p300). (C) TNF-α binds to TNFR, then complex 1 assembles and TAK1 activates the
  IKK complex and MAPKs (JNK and p38). The IKK complex phosphorylates IκBα, leading
  to the release of NF-κB. JNK and p38 activate AP1. Both AP1 and NF-κB increase proinflammatory
  gene expression. (D) IL-17A/F stimulates the IL-17 receptor complex leading to the
  recruitment of Act1 followed by TRAFs. The TRAF6 activates the TAK1 pathway with
  activation of NF-κB and AP1. TRAF2/5 recruits RNA binding proteins (eg, HuR, Arid5a)
  that promote mRNA stabilization of proinflammatory transcripts. Inhibition of the
  chaperone HSP90 results in reduced function of Act1 (E) Upon binding of IL-23 to
  its receptor complex, TYK2 and JAK2 activate and phosphorylate STAT3, which dimerizes
  and promotes the expression of proinflammatory genes and RORγt. JAKi may disrupt
  the signaling by targeting TYK2/JAK2. The inhibition of RORγt results in decreased
  Th17 differentiation and response. (F) Upon binding of piclodenoson to A3AR, the
  activity of PKB/Akt is inhibited, leading to reduced NF-κB activity. (G) Tapinarof
  binds to AhR, the AhR-Tapinarof complex heterodimerizes with ARNT leading to downregulation
  of inflammatory cytokines and upregulation of skin barrier proteins. Created with
