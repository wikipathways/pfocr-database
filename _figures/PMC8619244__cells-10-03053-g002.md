caption: TGF-β signaling fibroblasts differentiation into myofibroblasts. TGF-β is
  the major soluble factor implicated in fibroblast differentiation. The canonical
  pathway includes binding of TGF-β to the TGF-β receptors resulting in the activation
  of SMAD2/3, which forms a complex with SMAD4, translocates to nucleus, and induces
  fibrotic gene expression. In contrast, non-canonical pathway includes p38 MAPK/JNK
  pathway, which activates Jun/Fos-dependent fibrotic gene expression. α-SMA = α-smooth
  muscle actin; TGF-β = transforming growth factor β; TGFβR = transforming growth
  factor β receptor.
