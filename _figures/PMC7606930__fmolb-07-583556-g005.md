caption: IRAP regulates TCR ζ chain trafficking and signaling. The full TCR comprises
  the clonotypic αβ chains, the γε and δε heterodimers and a ζζ homodimer. (1) While
  the αβ, γε and δε heterodimers assemble in the ER and are transported via the Golgi
  stacks to the plasma membrane, the majority of the ζζ homodimer is stored in IRAP
  intracellular vesicles. (2) In basal conditions, the ζ chain recycles between plasma
  membrane and the intracellular pool by a recycling pathway involving the clathrin
  adaptor AP2, the DnM2 and IRAP. Inhibition of this recycling pathway by AP2, DnM2
  or IRAP depletion increases the levels of ζ chain at plasma membrane. (3) Under
  T cell activation, the ζζ homodimer is internalized in IRAP vesicles, from where
  it is able to trigger signaling cascades, as demonstrated by its interaction with
  several signalosome components, such as ZAP-70, Lck and LAT. AP2, adaptor protein-2;
  DnM2, dynamin-2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IRAP, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase;
  LAP, linker for activation of T cells; TCR, T cell receptor.
