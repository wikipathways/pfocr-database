caption: 'FAO signaling pathway and ferroptosis in BC. 1) FAs are catalyzed by ACSLs
  to produce acyl-CoA, which is subsequently converted to CPT1 on the outer mitochondrial
  membrane. The cleavage of acyl-CoA into acetyl CoA in mitochondrion is aided by
  β-oxidation. FAO is involved in various facets of malignant behaviors in BC, encompassing
  energy production and redox equilibrium for cancer cell proliferation, drug resistance,
  metastasis, and the EMT. 2) Transcription factors such as Myc, AR, and STAT3 serve
  as significant regulators in BC. Modifications in these genes subsequently enhance
  the expression of crucial enzymes implicated in fatty acid oxidation and ferroptosis.
  Furthermore, acyl-CoA generated by fatty acid oxidation serves as a crucial cofactor
  in the post-translational acetylation of histones. Transcriptional and posttranscriptional
  regulatory mechanisms result in lipid metabolic changes in BC. 3) Ferroptosis is
  an acknowledged kind of programmed cell death induced by reactive oxygen species-mediated
  lipid peroxidation, which directly leads to cell death characterized by the degradation
  of lipid membranes. Ferroptosis inducers erastin and RSL3 elevate ROS and iron levels
  and induce the mortality of BC cells. In TME, oleic acid released from adipocytes
  prevented lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Interferon-γ generated by CD8 + cytotoxic
  T lymphocytes causes the downregulation of SLC7A11, resulting in lipid peroxidation
  and ferroptosis in BC. Abbreviations: FAs, fatty acids; TME, tumor microenvironment;
  BC, breast cancer; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids;
  FAO, fatty acid oxidation; EMT, epithelial–mesenchymal transition'
