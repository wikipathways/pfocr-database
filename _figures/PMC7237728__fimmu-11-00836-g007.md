caption: The effect of DFX on Mtb-infected macrophages. DFX supports immune function
  by enhancing transcript and protein levels of IL1β and TNFα in hMDMs infected with
  Mtb. DFX enhanced glycolytic metabolism in hAMs and hMDMs infected with Mtb. Moreover,
  DFX differentially affects alternative metabolic pathways, decreasing pentose phosphate
  pathway activity and fatty acid oxidation. DFX modulates its effect in Mtb-infected
  human macrophages through the stabilization of HIF1α. Image produced with the aid
