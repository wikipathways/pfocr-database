caption: 'Schematic overview of glycolytic and fermentative pathways in plasma-treated
  yeast cells. The enzymes that were tested are shown in blue circles with an arrow
  representing upregulation after plasma treatment and absence of an arrow representing
  no observed change between treated or untreated cells. Similarly, the three tested
  metabolites are shown in purple squares. RNS: reactive nitrogen species; Hxk: hexokinase
  2; Glu6P: glucose 6-phosphate; Fru1,6P2: fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; GA3P: D-glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate; NAD+ and NADH: oxidized and reduced
  forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, respectively; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Gro3P: glycerol-3-phosphate; 1,3BPG: 1,3-bisphosphoglyceric
  acid; 3PG: glycerate 3-phosphate; PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate; PYK: pyruvate kinase;
  NADPH: reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; PPP: pentose
  phosphate pathway; RNS: reactive nitrogen species; UV: ultraviolet; ATP: adenosine
  triphosphate.'
