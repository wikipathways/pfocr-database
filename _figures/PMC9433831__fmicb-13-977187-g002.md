caption: Mechanisms of gut microbiota in regulation of intestinal barrier integrity.
  During T2DM and the relate complication, disturbed gut microbiota result in overgrowth
  of pathogenic bacterium, increased LPS and aberrant metabolites. The microbe-associated
  molecular patterns (MAMPs) and detrimental metabolites activate TLRs or NODs signaling
  pathway, change intestinal immune landscape toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype
  by overproducing of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α
  (TNFα), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interferon (IFN)-γ, coupled with a loss in barrier
  protective cytokines interleukin (IL)-17, IL-22 and epithelial mucin. All these
  contribute to the degradation of epithelial tight junction proteins and increased
  intestinal permeability. Compromised intestinal barrier leads to abnormal influx
  of immune-stimulatory microbial products and systemic spread of enteric pathogens
  and LPS in metabolic tissues.
