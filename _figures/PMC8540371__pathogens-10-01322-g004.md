caption: Intersection between polyamine metabolism, stress responses, carbohydrate
  metabolism, and CPS/PG production in S. pneumoniae. Multi-step reactions are shown
  as dotted arrows, (blue represents upregulated while red represents downregulated
  reactions). Deletion of the polyamine transporter results in reduced intracellular
  polyamine levels (red oval), impairing the redox system (light green rectangle),
  rendering the pneumococci susceptible to NO and H2O2 stress (dark green oval). The
  stressful conditions alter gene regulation (orange rectangle) to limit processes
  (grey square; glycolysis, pyrimidine, and amino sugar nucleotide synthesis) that
  yield precursors for CPS and PG synthesis (yellow vertical rectangle). A shift to
  the PPP could be to limit production of precursors for synthesis of CPS and PG,
  to save energy for redox homeostasis (dark blue vertical rectangle; ADS, PPP, and
  GSH metabolism) and cation inflow. Influx of carbohydrates via phosphotransferase
  systems (PTS) that promote synthesis of glycolysis is inhibited in favor of inflow
  of carbohydrates which favor the Leloir pathway and tagatose pathways (light blue
  rectangle), probably to provide PPP intermediates.
