caption: lncRNAs and transcription factors related to the development of IR. (a) Lipogenic
  activity is associated with elevated levels of H19, MALAT1, MEG3, and MIAT and their
  interaction with nuclear proteins, such as element-binding transcription factor
  1c (SREBP-1c), proliferator-activated receptor gamma PPARγ, and forkhead box O1
  (FoxO1), and in consequence, the expression of lipogenic genes is promoted, e.g.,
  acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and cytochrome C oxidase
  (SCO1), as well as other proteins such as lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) by MIAT,
  which leads to the accumulation of lipids. (b) MEG3 upregulation activates CREB-regulated
  transcriptional coactivator (CRTC2), which in turn activates (cAMP response element-binding
  protein) CREB by binding to activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and FoxO1;
  in addition, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) and FoxO1 are activated by
  H19 overexpression, which induces gluconeogenesis. In contrast, H19 downregulation
  promotes the transcription of FoxO1 and the gluconeogenic genes. (c) MALAT1 overexpression
  induces the expression of zeste polycomb homolog 2 (EZH2)/polycomb repressive complex
  2 (PRC2), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and serum amyloid antigen
  3 (SAA3), which in turn promote the elevation of interleukins 6 and 1β, and tumor
  necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Additionally, the expression of H19 induces the dephosphorylation
  of protein kinase B (AKT) and nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate oxidase (NADPH) and TNF-α levels increase as a result of the expression
  of c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNK) due to MIAT. (d) MEG3 downregulation promotes
  miR-140-5p expression, which is related to cellular senescence. Overexpression of
  MALAT1 activates polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBPI), which is involved
  in pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. MIAT downregulation affects the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway signaling, decreasing insulin sensitivity
  and cell viability.
