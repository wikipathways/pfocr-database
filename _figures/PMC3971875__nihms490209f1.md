caption: 'Main effect neural activation during sucrose taste processing. Taste pathway:
  Chemoreceptors on the tongue detect the sweet taste. This signal transmits through
  the spinal cord and into the brainstem. The thalamus (purple) relays this information
  to the primary gustatory cortex, which is interconnected with the anterior insula
  (green). The anterior insula is a vital component of the ventral neurocircuit, or
  limbic system, through its connections with the amygdala (blue), the anterior cingulate
  cortex (ACC; turquoise) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; yellow). Afferents from
  cortical structures involved in the ventral neurocircuit are directed to the ventral
  striatum (VS); cortical structures more involved in cognitive strategies, forming
  a dorsal neurocircuit that includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; pink),
  send inputs to the dorsal striatum (DS).'
