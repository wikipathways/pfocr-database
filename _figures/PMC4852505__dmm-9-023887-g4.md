caption: 'Insulin resistance and feedback in the Drosophila fat body. Schematic depiction
  of a Drosophila fat body cell illustrating gene products that might contribute to
  primary (blue text) and secondary (magenta text) mechanisms of insulin resistance.
  Primary mechanisms: alterations of insulin receptor (InR) or any downstream components
  of the insulin/IGF-like signaling (IIS) pathway lead to insulin resistance. Target
  of rapamycin (TOR) and Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways are proposed to negatively
  regulate IIS signaling and thus contribute to insulin resistance. Lipid accumulation
  [which occurs when flies are fed a high-sugar diet (HSD); see main text] leads to
  PKC activation, which contributes to insulin resistance through negative feedback
  on IIS. Secondary mechanisms: the secreted insulin-binding proteins Imp-L2, Secreted
  decoy of InR (SDR) and Acid-labile subunit (ALS) cause insulin resistance by interfering
  with the binding of insulin to its receptor. IIS triggers membrane localization
  of an unknown Drosophila glucose transporter (Glut?) through membrane fusion of
  lipid rafts to facilitate removal of hemolymph glucose, and defects in this glucose
  transporter or its trafficking might lead to insulin resistance. AKH stimulates
  lipolysis (involving AkhR and PKA), and defects in this pathway lead to obesity.
  AKH also increases hemolymph glucose through unknown mechanisms that likely involve
  gluconeogenesis and breakdown of glycogen, and might contribute to hyperglycemia
  in diabetic states. Fat body secreted factors (endocrine, lower right) Unpaired2
  (Upd2) and insulin-like peptide 6 (Ilp6) might contribute to insulin resistance
  in certain nutritional states. PKA, Protein kinase A; AKH, Adipokinetic hormone;
  AkhR, Adipokinetic hormone receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SVs, secretory vesicles;
  MT, mitochondrion. Positive pathways are shown by black arrows; inhibitory pathways
  are shown by red lines. Limited data exists for pathways indicated by hatched lines.
  See main text for additional discussion.'
