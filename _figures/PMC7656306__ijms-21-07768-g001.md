caption: Mechanism of action of non-oncological drugs in ovarian cancer (OC). Statins
  inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) leading to the blocking
  of cholesterol biosynthetic pathway though a mevalonate-dependent mechanism. Moreover,
  statins can block drug efflux pumps by a mevalonate-independent mechanism. Bisphosphonates
  block farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, located downstream HMGCR, leading to the
  impairment of cholesterol biosynthesis. Metformin inhibits insulin signals and glucose
  synthesis via respiratory-chain complex I blockage. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor
  that inhibits the production of phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT) leading to
  the impairment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K)-Akt pathway. Itraconazole
  can inhibit Hedgehog, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and Wnt signalling pathway.
  Moreover, itraconazole can inhibit angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, and promote
  the overexpression of P-glycoprotein. Ivermectin interferes with several cellular
  mechanisms, including multidrug resistance proteins (MDR) inhibition, Akt/mTOR,
  and Wnt signalling pathways modulation, p21–activated kinase (PAK-1) and yes-associated
  protein 1 (YAP1). Moreover, ivermectin promotes the increase of intracellular reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) levels leading to the downregulation of stemness genes. Adenosine
  diphosphate (ADP); adenosine monophosphate (AMP); adenosine triphosphate (ATP);
  3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA).
