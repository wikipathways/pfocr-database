caption: Oxidative stress induced by viral infection has been shown to play a critical
  role in activating innate immunity through the NF-κB production of cytokines to
  defend against pathogenic microorganisms (Narayanan et al. ). NF-κB regulates inflammatory
  responses and cellular injury by inducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α), COX-2, iNOS, and vascular adhesion molecules. Nrf2 can negatively
  control the NF-κB signaling pathway through multiple mechanisms, as well as inhibit
  oxidative stress-mediated NF-κB activation by reducing intracellular ROS levels
  (Cecchini and Cecchini ). On the other hand, lowers free CBP, a transcriptional
  coactivator of Nrf2, by competing with the CH1-KIX structural domain of CBP, and
  also increases p65 phosphorylation at Ser276, which hinders CBP binding to Nrf2
  (Saha et al. ).
