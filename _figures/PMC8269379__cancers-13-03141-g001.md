caption: 'Melatonergic and kynurenine pathways. The activation of TDO by stress and
  cortisol, and IDO by pro-inflammatory cytokines, leads to an increase in the kynurenine
  pathway which implies the conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine and kynurenic
  acid, which can activate the AhR, leading to important changes in breast cancer
  cells, including a marked increase in mitochondrial CYP1B1. Mitochondrial CYP1B1
  drives melatonin conversion to NAS, increasing the NAS in the NAS/melatonin ratio,
  which is implicated in an increased risk of breast cancer. Conversely, SCFA, produced
  by gut microbiota, directly or indirectly stimulates the production of melatonin
  by stimulating the production of serotonin which is then converted into melatonin.
  Gut dysbiosis and gut permeability decrease butyrate levels and increase LPS levels,
  favouring the appearance of breast cancer. Melatonin can counteract this effect
  caused by dysbiosis, preventing breast cancer. Abbreviations: AANAT: aralkylamine
  N-acetyltransferase; AhR; aryl hydrocarbon receptor; ASMT: acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase;
