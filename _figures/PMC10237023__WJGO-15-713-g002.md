caption: 'The intratumour microbiome-immune-pancreatic cancer axis. The intratumour
  fungi can activate the complement 3 (C3) complement cascade through the "lectin
  activation pathway". And C3a, as a fragment after C3 complement cascade reaction,
  promotes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells proliferation by binding
  to C3a receptors on the surface of cancer cells. Moreover, the intratumour fungi
  (Malassezia globosa or Alternaria alternata) and their cell-free extracts facilitate
  interleukin (IL)-33 secretion through activation of the dectin-1 receptor-mediated
  Src-Syk-CARD9 pathway. And IL-33 secretion promotes T helper 2 cell, group 2 innate
  lymphoid cells and Tregs enrichment in tumour microenvironment (TME), thus promoting
  PDAC progression. The intratumour bacteria promotes the secretion of neutrophil
  chemokines in the TME of PDAC thereby promoting tumour-associated neutrophils 2
  (TAN2) enrichment in the TME. A portion of the effect of TAN2 may be through neutrophil
  extracellular traps. The PDAC intratumour bacteria also reduces the TAM1 polarization
  and decreased the antigen-presenting ability of TAM1 though through activation of
  toll-like receptors (TLR)2 and TLR4 on the surface of cells. TAM1 inhibition is
  accompanied by an increase in TAM to TAM2 conversion. It also promotes the secretion
  of IL-1β through TLR4 on the surface of PDAC cells. And IL-1β secretion promotes
  TAM2 activation through an indirect pathway that activates pancreatic stellate cells.
  Finally, the high diversity of intratumour microbiome promotes the activation of
  CD8+ T cells, which inhibits PDAC. C3: Complement 3; PDAC: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma;
  Th2: T helper 2 cell; ILC2: Group 2 innate lymphoid cells; TME: Tumour microenvironment;
  TAN2: Tumour-associated neutrophils 2; NETs: Neutrophil extracellular traps; TAM:
  Tumour-associated macrophages; TLR: Toll-like receptors; PSCs: Pancreatic stellate
  cells.'
