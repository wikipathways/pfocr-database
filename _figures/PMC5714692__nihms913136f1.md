caption: Glucose enters the β cell via GLUT transporters and is converted to glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P) by glucokinase (GK), the first, committed step of glycolysis. Downstream,
  the stimulus-secretion coupling pathway, culminating in the accumulation of intracellular
  Ca2+, regulates insulin secretion but also contributes to β-cell proliferation via
  calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and the carbohydrate-responsive
  element-binding protein (ChREBP). ChREBP is retained in the cytoplasm by Sorcin
  at low glucose concentrations but translocates to the nucleus upon glucose stimulation.
  In parallel, glucose metabolism regulates LKB1/AMPK/mTOR signaling to promote cell
  cycle activation.
