caption: 'Increasing ROS triggers mitochondrial damage related to ferroptosis under
  cysteine starvation. The pathways correlated with reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  accumulation are as follows. (1) Cystine turns into cysteine after entering the
  cytoplasm by system xC−; the latter involves glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis with
  the catalysis of γ-glutamylcysteine ligase (GCL), glutathione synthetase (GS), and
  glycine; and GSH as a cofactor further facilitates the scavenging of ROS by glutathione
  peroxidase 4 (GPX4). (2) Ferric irons transferred by transferrin (Tf) become ferrous
  irons after entering the cytoplasm by the transferrin receptor (TFR); the ferrous
  irons enrich the labile iron pool (LIP), which facilitates the generation of ROS
  via the Fenton reaction and enzymatic reaction (e.g., LOXs). (3) L-Glutamine (L-Gln)
  becomes ketoglutaric acid (α-KG) via glutaminolysis after entering the cytoplasm
  by solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5), and α-KG supplies a carbon source
  for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which activates the electron transfer chain
  (ETC) to generate ETC-ROS. (4) The coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone/CoQ10) derived from
  the mevalonate pathway (MVA pathway) and its reduced form ubiquinol (CoQ10-H2) generated
  via the NADH-FSP1-CoQ10pathway and the GCH1-BH4-phospholipid axis participate in
  the scavenging on lipid ROS. The increase in ROS triggers ROS-induced ROS release
  (RIRR), which promotes proapoptotic protein BID translocation into the mitochondria.
  Then, the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the sustained opening
  of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) cause mitochondrial damage,
  inducing ferroptosis. Inducers of ferroptosis are in red; inhibitors of ferroptosis
  are in green. Relevant abbreviations: NADH: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; FSP1:
  ferroptosis suppressor protein 1; GCH1: GTP cyclohydrolase-1; BH4: tetrahydrobiopterin.'
