caption: Possible applications of the programmed cell death GLuc PCA library. Functionally
  related genes or pathway-based libraries can be screened against the library for
  protein–protein interaction (PPI) mapping. Detected interactions can be further
  developed as quantitative reporters for specific PPIs or can be used as readouts
  for drug screening.
