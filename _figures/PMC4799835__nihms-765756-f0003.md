caption: TRAF6 in T lymphocyte activation and differentiation. (A) Upon TCR stimulation,
  TRAF6 negatively regulates PI3K-Akt activation and restrains IL-2 production and
  proliferation by enforcing a requirement for costimulation. Absence of TRAF6 expression
  results in T cells that are refractory to Treg-mediated suppression, and that resist
  anergy induction in a manner associated with decreased expression of the pro-anergy
  factor Cbl-b. TCR-dependent activation of NFκB is critical for both T cell activation
  and differentiation, and currently conflicting evidence exists regarding the requirement
  for TRAF6 for activation of this pathway. (B) OX40-triggered TRAF6-dependent non-canonical
  NFκB activation, in combination with TGF-β and IL-4, is important for Th9 cell differentiation.
  TRAF6 activates NIK, which mediates the processing of p100 to p52, leading to generation
  of p52-RelB complexes. OX40-OX40L-dependent Th9 polarization is independent of PU.1,
  a key transcription factor for Th9 cells. (C) TRAF6 is an important regulator of
  IL-17R signaling as well as Th17 differentiation. TRAF6 is recruited to IL-17 receptor
  and activated through Act1, an adaptor protein and E3 ubiquitin ligase, and subsequently
  transduces signals to activates NFκB and MAPK pathways. TRAF6 also functions as
  an inhibitor of TGF-β-induced Smad2/3 activation, and TRAF6ΔT T cells cultured under
  Th17 conditions with TGF-β and IL-6 exhibit increased Th17 differentiation due to
  enhanced TGF-β-mediated inhibition of expression of IL-2. (D) TRAF6 is essential
  in memory CD8+ T cell differentiation in response to listeria infection. TRAF6ΔT
  CD8+ T cells fail to differentiate into memory cells following normal primary expansion.
  This defect can be mitigated by pharmacologically enhancing AMPK activity, or by
  inhibiting mTOR activity. As a process regulated downstream of AMPK, fatty acid
  oxidation levels may function as cellular rheostat for determining memory precursor
  potential.
