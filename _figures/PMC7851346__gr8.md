caption: Model of URA-mediated EAE Mitigation by Directly Targeting Aryl Hydrocarbon
  Receptor. URA derived from berries or medical plants rich in ellagitannin and ellagic
  acid achieved molecular docking with AhR, and regulated AhR downstream genes in
  IL-17 Family Signaling Pathway and dendritic cells developmental lineage pathway,
  and ultimately inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination in EAE
  mice.
