caption: Implication of ncRNAs in cellular signaling pathways related to cancer immune
  resistance. NcRNAs can affect the efficacy of immunotherapy through modulation of
  cancer cell ferroptosis. miR-21-3p accelerates IFN-γ-mediated ferroptosis by downregulating
  TXNRD1 to impel lipid peroxidation. NEAT1 increases MIOX expression by sponging
  miR-362-3p. This event enhances ROS production and decreases the intracellular levels
  of NADPH and GSH, eventually leading to cancer cell ferroptosis. Moreover, NEAT1
  reinforces the anticancer potency of ferroptosis activators erastin and RSL3. LINC01085
  inhibits the phosphorylation of TBK1 by abating its interaction with GSK3β. Accordingly,
  LINC01085 blocks the activation of the STING/MAVS/IRF3 signaling pathway, resulting
  in downregulation of NF-κB and PD-L1 and decreased production of type I/III IFNs.
  LINC01085 can act in synergy with anti-PD-L1 treatment. PD-L1, programmed cell death-ligand
