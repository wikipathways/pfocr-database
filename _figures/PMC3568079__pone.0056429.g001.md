caption: 'Sterol biosynthesis starts preferentially with cycloartenol in plants and
  lanosterol in animals and fungi. Main biosynthetic steps and sterols accumulating
  in the mutant lines considered in this study are indicated in colors: red, ste1;
  green, dwarf5; blue, dim1. The major observed enzymatic activity of the YFP-fused
  enzymes generated is also indicated by the same color code. LAS1 = lanosterol synthase,
  CAS1 = cycloartenol synthase. The dashed arrows are indicating more than one enzymatic
  step. Accurate sterol nomenclature can be found at IUPAC http://www.iupac.org/'
