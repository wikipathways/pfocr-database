caption: GPX4 regulates necroinflammation by inhibiting TNF-α-mediated NF-κB signaling.
  TNF-α regulates cell survival and death by activating the key transcription factor
  of NF-κB. NF-κB signal activation, as a downstream promoter element of TNF-α, is
  negatively suppressed in intracellular survival signaling. Inversely, TNF-α-mediated
  NF-κB signaling can be markedly activated when ROS is produced in mitochondria.
  GPX4 can attenuate the necroinflammatory response and suppress the inflammatory
  cytokines by down-regulating TNF-α-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway. ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; GSH, glutathione; GSSG, glutathione
  disulfide; FAD/FADH, flavin adenine dinucletide; NADP/NADPH, nicotinamide adenine
