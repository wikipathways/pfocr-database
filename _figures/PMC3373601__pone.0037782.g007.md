caption: ER stress-induced apoptosis is mediated by the activation of BAX and BAK
  at the mitochondria through upregulation of the upstream BH3-only proteins (i.e.
  BIM and PUMA) leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, cytochrome
  c release, and subsequent apoptosome assembling. Under certain conditions such as
  mitochondrial calcium overload and oxidative stress, cytochrome c release can occur
  independently of BAX and BAK through opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore (PTP), which is form by several components including CypD and VDAC. Opening
  of the PTP leads to the expansion of the mitochondrial matrix, resulting in sufficient
  swelling to rupture the outer mitochondrial membrane and cytochrome c release. Stimulation
  of ER stress in conjunction with mild serum withdrawal triggers apoptosis in a BAX/BAK
  and CypD-independent manner. This alternative death pathway is mediated by the activation
  of caspase-9. Under normal conditions growth factor signaling may inhibit this alternative
  cell death pathway at the level of (i) mitochondria, or by (ii) blocking the activation
  of a specific ER-dependent event.
