caption: Figure 2. A putative model for JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Upon binding ligand
  (IL-10), receptor-associated JAKs become activated and mediate phosphorylation of
  specific receptor tyrosine residues. This leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation
  of STAT3. Activated STAT3 is released from the receptor, dimerize, translocate to
  the nucleus, and bind with transcription factors to regulate expression of many
  cardio-protective, anti-inflammatory or growth related genes. As a feedback loop
  it also regulates expression of suppressor of cytokines signaling genes (SOCS).
  Many protein inhibitors (PIAS) can also regulate the transcriptional activity of
  STAT3. In addition to JAKs, PTKs and MAPK, activated by Ang II, may participate
  in phosphorylation of STAT3. Activated STAT3 translocate to the nucleus to activate
  genes, such as c-fos, c-myc, α2-macroglobulin and tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1
  (TIMP-1) by binding to the sis-inducible element (SIE) of the promoter.
