caption: In addition to the known pathways that activate hepcidin expression, we show
  that Ras/RAF-triggered signals and the mTOR pathway are involved in hepcidin suppression.
  This finding links the control of iron homeostasis with enhanced cell proliferation
  and anabolic growth under nutrient-rich and growth-stimulating conditions. Furthermore,
  we identify new components of the transcriptional machinery that control steady-state
  levels of hepcidin expression and hepcidin induction upon IL-6 stimulation. Among
  these, 3 factors (STAT6, CREBBP, and SRF) are additionally required for the BMP-triggered
  hepcidin response.
