caption: Diagram summarizes the effects of PAE on microvessel morphology and function.
  Microvessel dilation, constriction, and degeneration have all been reported as the
  consequences of PAE. PAE exposure upregulates receptor for vascular endothelial
  growth factor 1 (VEGF1), yet downregulates receptor for VEGF2. In addition, upregulation
  of endothelial autophagy following PAE has been reported. The increase in autophagy
  vacuole number following alcohol exposure is triggered by acetaldehyde (MeCHO) and
  is accompanied by a down-regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.
