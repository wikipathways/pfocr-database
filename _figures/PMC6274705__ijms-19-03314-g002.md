caption: Model of the feedback regulation of AMPK by protein acetylation. AMPK phosphorylates
  and inhibits ACC, thus increasing acetyl-CoA cellular level and promoting KAT-mediated
  protein acetylation. Acetylation of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) inhibits the ability
  of LKB1 to activate AMPK. AMPK also promotes synthesis of NAD+, thus activating
  SIRT1 and other sirtuins and promoting protein deacetylation. SIRT1 deacetylates
  and activates LKB1, resulting in AMPK activation. Arrows denote activation, t-bars
  denote inhibition, and dashed arrow indicates multistep pathway.
