caption: Model of the pathways involved in polycystic kidney disease. Upon mechanical
  stimulation of the primary cilium, Ca2+ enters the cell via polycystin-2 (PC-2),
  which forms a complex with polycystin-1 (PC-1) and fibrocystin (FC). In addition,
  Ca2+ is released from the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). Disruption of the polycystin/fibrocystin
  pathway results in decreased cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Reduced Ca2+ levels stimulate
  adenylate cyclase (AC) and inhibit phosphodiesterase (PDE), resulting in increased
  cAMP levels. Subsequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA) stimulates cell proliferation
  by sequential activation of Ras, B-Raf, MEK, and ERK. Furthermore, in polycystic
  kidney disease, cAMP-PKA signaling increases the permeability and expression of
  CFTR Cl− channels, resulting in Cl− extrusion. This increases the movement of Na
  and, subsequently, water into the lumen of the cyst
