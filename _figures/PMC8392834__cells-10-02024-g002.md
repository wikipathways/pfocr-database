caption: Schematic diagram of mito-calpain mediated mitochondrial damage in the diseased
  heart. In the diseased heart, cardiac stress leads to activation of both cyto-calpain
  and mito-calpain. Cyto-calpain can further translocate into mitochondria. Activated
  mito-calpain (1) cleaves subunits of complex I and complex V, leading to impairment
  of mitochondrial respiratory chain. On one hand, the resultant overproduction of
  ROS serves as a signaling molecule triggering the proinflammatory pathway; on the
  other hand, mitochondrial respiratory chain defects directly lead to ATP depletion.
  Moreover, mito-calpain degrades PDH, a critical enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid
  cycle, further dampening mitochondrial energy metabolism; (2) cleaves OPA1 and leads
  to decreased mitofussion and imbalance of mitochondrial dynamics; (3) mediates cleavage
  of AIF and its release from mitochondria to cytoplasm, where it interacts with cyclophilin
  A and further transfers to the nucleus. After entering the nucleus, tAIF binds to
  genomic DNA and promotes DNA fragmentation; (4) sensitizes mPTP opening, leading
  to mitochondrial swelling and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, which further
  contributes to apoptosis.
