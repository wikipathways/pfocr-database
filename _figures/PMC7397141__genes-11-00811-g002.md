caption: 'Homocysteine metabolism, folate cycle and methyl transfer reactions. Methionine
  is supplied by the diet; in that it is an essential amino acid. Homocysteine is
  generated from methionine through three subsequent reactions: (I) the expensive
  biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) by the consumption of all phosphate bonds
  of ATP; (II) Methyl transfer from SAM to over fifty different acceptors, including
  small molecules and macromolecules (nucleic acids and proteins); (III) Hydrolysis
  of SAM demethylated product: S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) yielding adenosine and
  homocysteine. SAH is a powerful competitive inhibitor of SAM-dependent methyltransferases,
  therefore its enzymatic disposal is crucial to prevent its buildup within the cell
  thus creating the conditions for such inhibition to actually take place. (IV) homocysteine
  in turn can be re-methylated to methionine, though a couple of “rescue” reactions,
  dependent on either 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5 -CH3-THF), as the major reaction
  also requiring cobalamine (vit. B12) as well, or betaine as a secondary reaction.
  Reactions, from reaction I to IV, define the methionine–homocysteine cycle. Alternatively,
  homocysteine can be transsulfurated to cysteine in a pyridoxal phosphate (vit. B6)
  -dependent pathway. One of the major products of further cysteine metabolism is
  the biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH) a major intracellular scavenger for reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). An alternative product of transsulfuration is hydrogen sulfide
  (H2S), the third gaseous vasodilator, after NO and CO. Interestingly enough, folates
  are involved in both DNA methylation, though the replenishment of the methionine–homocysteine
  cycle, and DNA biosynthesis, in that 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10 -CH2-THF)
  and formyl-THF are needed for the biosynthesis of important DNA nucleotide building
  blocks. In case of homocysteine remethylation, the CH3-THF cosubstrate for this
  methionine rescue pathway is generated by the catalytic activity of the enzyme methylenetetrahyfolate
  reductase (MTHFR; EC 1.5.1.20) (not shown).'
