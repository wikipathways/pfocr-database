caption: Dual functions of IFITM3 in the innate antiviral immune response. Cellular
  sensors, such as RIG-I and MDA5, detect virus infection. These proteins recognize
  viral products, including RNA bearing uncapped 5′-phosphates. Subsequently, the
  transcription factor IRF3 is activated and is translocated to the nucleus for induction
  of IFN-β. Secreted IFN-β signals through its receptor via STAT proteins and induces
  production of IFITM3 and other IFN-stimulated genes. IFITM3 blocks the membrane
  fusion of endocytosed viruses, such as influenza virus (function 1), and is newly
  shown to promote IRF3 degradation in autophagosomes, providing feedback inhibition
  of the IFN-β induction pathway (function 2).
