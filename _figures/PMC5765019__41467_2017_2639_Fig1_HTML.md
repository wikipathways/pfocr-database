caption: 'RNA nucleoside formation pathway. A geothermal environment provides the
  right set up for the depicted transformations by establishing wet–dry cycles. The
  prebiotic starting materials are produced from a prebiotic atmosphere and washed
  into an aqueous environment (e.g. by rain). Major atmospheric components are written
  in larger letters, whereas minor components are written in smaller letters. Transformations
  are taking place in different environments, illustrated by various rivers (in light
  blue). Each environment provides the right setup for different chemistries, leading
  to several different chemical transformations. This geochemical setup leads to a
  set of canonical and non-canonical RNA building blocks by continuous synthesis (6a,
