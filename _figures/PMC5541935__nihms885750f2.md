caption: For the interaction between the Wnt/β-catenin and TGF-β pathways, the responsive
  Smads (Smads 2 and 3) can directly associate with lymphoid enhancer binding factor
  1/T cell-specific factor (LEF1/TCF) to synergistically activate target genes [,];
  the tumor suppressor Smad4 is negatively regulated by Wnt/GSK3 phosphorylations
  []; Axin, a core component of the β-catenin destruction complex, may function as
  an adapter, facilitating Smad3 association with the receptor complex thereby promoting
  TGF-β signaling []; FOXQ1, a member of the forkhead transcription factor family,
  can be induced by TGF-β1 and enhance the nuclear translocation of β-catenin [].
  For interaction between Wnt/β-catenin and EGFR pathways, a synergistic interaction
  has been found through various mechanisms at different levels. For example, the
  direct association between β-catenin and EGFR/c-Neu (ErbB1/ErbB2) heterodimers is
  identified in mammary gland tumors []. In intestinal tumor cells, APC and KRAS act
  synergistically in enhancing Wnt signaling, tumor formation and progression [].
  Overexpression of Wnt-1 and Wnt-5a activated EGFR signaling by stimulated EGFR tyrosine
  phosphorylation, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and
  matrix metalloproteinase-mediated release of soluble EGFR ligands through Frizzled
  receptors []. A potent activation of Wnt/β-catenin by EGFR is dependent on ERK MAP
  kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Wnt co-receptor LRP6 which dramatically increases
  the cellular response to Wnt. Moreover, EGFR directly phosphorylate β-catenin at
  Tyr142, which is known to increase cytoplasmic β-catenin concentration via release
  of β-catenin from membranous cadherin complexes []. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K)/AKT pathway inactivates GSK3, via direct AKT-mediated phosphorylation to
  facilitate Wnt signaling pathway []. EGF treatment of human breast cancer cell lines
  MDA-MB-468 can induce a strong tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, that blocks
  the interaction between β-catenin and E-cadherin and increases the invasiveness
  and metastatic potential of cancer cells []. In addition, EGFR/Erk signaling causes
  upregulation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc, and downregulation of caveolin-1 which in turn
  enhances β-catenin-TCF/LEF-1 transcriptional activity [–]. For interaction between
  Wnt/β-catenin and COX-2 pathways, a direct link between two pathways has been found
  through prostaglandin E2, one of the bioactive products of COX-2, which activates
  components of the canonical Wnt signaling system via G protein-coupled receptor
  EP2 and ravious signaling. The G protein α subunits (Gαs) interact with Axin resulting
  displacement of APC and increase of nuclear β-catenin; Gαs can also activate Akt
  through PKA; G protein βᵞ subunits (Gβᵞ) interact with PI3K resulting phosphorylation
  and inactivation of GSK-3β via Akt. In addition, EP2-Gβᵞ can also promote the transactivation
  of EGFR pathway in colon cancer cells through Src, which activates the proteolytic
  release of the EGFR ligands amphiregulin (AR) and transforming growth factor-α (TGFα),
  thereby stimulating the EGFR-signalling network. EP2-Gαs also stimulates expression
  of COX-2 by activating adenylyl cyclase (AC), resulting in increased cyclic AMP
  (cAMP) production, protein kinase A (PKA) activation and the phosphorylation of
  CREB. [,].
