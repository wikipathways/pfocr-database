caption: Selective and non-selective autophagy in CD4 T cells upon T cell receptor
  (TCR) activation. The formation of autophagosomes and autophagic flux in CD4 T cells
  requires the conventional protein complexes and steps described in other cell types,
  i.e., the preinitiation complex formed by Ulk1/2, Atg13, Fip200, and Atg101, the
  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PIK3)C3 complex which comprises Beclin1 and Vps34
  and allows for the formation of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) and finally
  the autophagy lipidation machinery which ensures the conjugation of LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine
  at the forming autophagosome membrane (). Autophagy in CD4 T cells can be pharmacologically
  modulated. While rapamycin may only have a modest impact, PI3K inhibitors such as
  3-methyladenine can reduce autophagosome formation in CD4 T cells. Inhibitors of
  lysosome function such as chloroquine (CQ), leupeptin, or ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)
  impair autophagic flux. Although TCR engagement activates both mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) and autophagy in CD4 T cells, TCR-induced autophagy does not
  seem to depend on mTOR inhibition but may rather be activated by the JAK/signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in response to autocrine/paracrine
  interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 signaling (). While CD4 T cells support bulk and selective
  autophagy (), the selective degradation of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1B/p27Kip1in
  autophagosomes may contribute to TCR-driven CD4 T cell proliferation (). Similarly,
  the exclusion of mitochondria from autophagosome upon TCR activation may contribute
  to TCR signal transduction and metabolic adaptations ().
