caption: Systemic analysis of metabolic changes in acute myocardial infarction pathogenesis.
  Each of the disturbed metabolites detected was searched in the KEGG database, and
  each KEGG pathway was scored according to the influence of the metabolic pathway
  (this map was generated from the KEGG reference map). Green boxes represent currently
  recognized enzymes in human beings.
