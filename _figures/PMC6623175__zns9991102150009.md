caption: Model proposed to explain why BDNF fails to regulate local translation in
  the hippocampus of Ts1Cje mice. Dendritic release of pro-BDNF and BDNF is increased
  in Ts1Cje hippocampal neurons (1). pro-BDNF is converted to mature BDNF extracellularly
  by tPA/plasmin, MMP-7 and other extracellular proteases () (2). BDNF acts presynaptically
  at TrkB receptors (3) to enhance glutamate release (4) (; ). BDNF acts postsynaptically
  at TrkB receptors (5), promoting the phosphorylation of NMDAR subunits (6) (; ),
  increasing the probability of NMDA channel opening (; ) and, hence, increasing excitatory
  activity. Exacerbated glutamatergic activity provokes increased dendritic release
  of pro-BDNF and BDNF (7) (; ). BDNF binding to postsynaptic TrkB receptors (5) also
  results in hyperactivation of the PI3K–Akt–mTOR signaling cascade (8), leading to
  increased local translation of dendritic mRNAs (9) like GluR1(which contributes
  to the increase in postsynaptic excitatory activity) and NMDAR1 (). Increased NMDAR-mediated
  neuronal activity in Ts1Cje hippocampal neurons also enhances CPEB1-mediated local
  translation of dendritic mRNAs such as DSCAM (10) (). As BDNF mRNA is localized
  to dendrites (; ), and its expression is regulated by CPEB1 () and a PI3K-dependent
  pathway (), its local dendritic translation may also increase in trisomic mice,
  contributing to the overexpression of BDNF in dendrites of the Ts1Cje hippocampus
  (11). This glutamatergic positive-feedback loop may explain why hippocampal Ts1Cje
  synapses lose their sensitivity to further increases in BDNF-mediated activity (;
  data herein) and attain a saturated state that impairs the modulation of synaptic
  plasticity.
