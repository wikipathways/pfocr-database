caption: 'T-REX electrophile toolbox enables assessment of downstream signaling strength
  triggered by target-specific delivery of specific bioactive LDEs (1–10) to specific
  proteins in cells (e.g., Keap1) at a precise time. Inset: The simplified model for
  Nrf2–ARE pathway. The downstream phenotypic responses—Nrf2 stabilization and ARE
  upregulation—are observed from whole-cell LDE flooding. Electrophilic modifications
  of various upstream redox-sensitive targets, including Keap1, PTEN, Akt, GSK3, PKC,
  etc., have been implicated to play roles in modulating Nrf2–ARE signaling. Using
  T-REX, this study directly probes the Nrf2–ARE signaling strength selectively elicited
  by LDE-signal-specific and Keap1-protein-specific electrophilic modifications in
  an otherwise unmodified proteome.'
