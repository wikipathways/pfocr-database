caption: Centrosome aberrations trigger an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Centrosome
  aberrations can result in the accumulation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the
  cytosol. The presence of cytosolic dsDNA activates the cGAS–STING pathway. In cancer
  cells with centrosome dysfunction, however, alternative inflammatory STING-dependent
  signaling, such as NF-κB signaling, is activated. Chronic NF-κB activation has been
  shown to mediate the extra centrosome-associated secretory phenotype (ECASP) by
  affecting proteins including IL-8, GDF-15 and ANGPTL4. IL-8 is also one of the components
  of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP); it recruits Th2 cells and
  M2 macrophages to shape the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Additionally, centrosome
  aberrations contribute to decreased tumor neoantigen expression and mutagenesis,
  thereby suppressing MHC class I antigen presentation and decreasing CD8+ T cell
  infiltration to enable evasion of antitumor immune responses. Ultimately, centrosome
  abnormalities can lead to immune escape, distant metastasis and therapeutic resistance

  description: Centrosome aberrations trigger an immunosuppressive microenvironment.
    Centrosome aberrations can result in the accumulation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
    in the cytosol. The presence of cytosolic dsDNA activates the cGAS–STING pathway.
    In cancer cells with centrosome dysfunction, however, alternative inflammatory
    STING-dependent signaling, such as NF-κB signaling, is activated. Chronic NF-κB
    activation has been shown to mediate the extra centrosome-associated secretory
    phenotype (ECASP) by affecting proteins including IL-8, GDF-15 and ANGPTL4. IL-8
    is also one of the components of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
    (SASP); it recruits Th2 cells and M2 macrophages to shape the immunosuppressive
    microenvironment. Additionally, centrosome aberrations contribute to decreased
    tumor neoantigen expression and mutagenesis, thereby suppressing MHC class I antigen
    presentation and decreasing CD8+ T cell infiltration to enable evasion of antitumor
    immune responses. Ultimately, centrosome abnormalities can lead to immune escape,
    distant metastasis and therapeutic resistance
