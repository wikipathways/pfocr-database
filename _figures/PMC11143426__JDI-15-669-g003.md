caption: Mechanisms of thiazolidinedione action on pancreatic β‐cells. Thiazolidinediones
  (TZDs), by activating the peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐gamma (PPARγ)
  receptor, upregulate the transcription of genes that enhance insulin sensitivity
  and β‐cell function. PPARγ activation leads to increased levels of transcription
  factor pancreas duodenum homeobox‐1 (PDX‐1), which is responsible for insulin gene
  transcription, and also elevates glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) and glucokinase expression,
  facilitating glucose metabolism. Furthermore, TZDs engage G protein‐coupled receptor
  40 (GPR40) to enhance insulin transcription in response to free fatty acid (FFA).
  The signaling cascades initiated by TZDs, including extracellular signal‐regulated
  kinase (ERK) 1/2 and p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, are depicted,
  highlighting their roles in β‐cell survival and plasticity, as well as reducing
  oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to preserve β‐cell functionality
