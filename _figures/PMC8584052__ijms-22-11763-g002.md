caption: The importance of the P5C-proline cycle in cancer metabolism. Metabolism
  of P5C depended on specific enzymes establish to the P5C-proline cycle. The activity
  of these enzymes is accompanied by transport of redox equivalents between the mitochondria
  and the cytosol that determine cellular processes—proliferation, survival, apoptosis,
  autophagy. The interconversion of P5C and proline changes the NADP+/NADPH ratio
  in the cell leading to regulation of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) synthesis
  and nucleotide synthesis via pentose phosphate pathway. ATP—adenosine triphosphate,
  FAD—oxidized form of flavin adenine dinucleotide, FADH2—reduced form of flavin adenine
