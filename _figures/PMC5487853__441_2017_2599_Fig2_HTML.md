caption: Representation of cilia-associated molecules that have been implicated in
  DNA damage responses (DDR). DNA damage recruits members of the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase
  (PARP) family and the MRN complex (MRE11, RAD40 and NBS1) to induce cell-intrinsic
  checkpoints, including p53. The ATM/CHK2 module is activated after DNA double-strand
  breaks (DSB), whereas the ATR/CHK1 pathway responds primarily to DNA signal-strand
  breaks. Both pathways converge on CDC25 phosphatase, a positive regulator of cell
  cycle progression upstream of CDK1/Cyclin B1. CEP164 interacts with ATM and ATR
  and is phosphorylated (P) by both kinases. CEP164 facilitates the activation of
  CHK1, MCD1 and PRA. Nek8 inhibits the cyclin-A-dependent activation of CDK1/2, pausing
  cell cycle progression. NPHP7 (Glis2) is associated with the activation of checkpoint
  kinase 1 (CHK1), the stabilization of p53 and the induction of senescence. OFD1
  interacts with NPHP10 (SDCCAG8) and components of the TIP60 histone acetyltransferase
  complex. Cells with defective OFD1 exhibit reduced histone acetylation, impaired
  repair and prolonged arrest at the G2-M checkpoint after DNA DSB. In response to
  H2O2, ATM can undergo auto-phosphorylation to activate LKB1/AMPK and autophagy (for
  abbreviations, see text)
