caption: 'STING pathway activation in DNA repair deficient breast cancer. Stalled
  replication forks or damaged DNA as a result of mutations in Fanconi Anemia/BRCA
  repair pathway genes results in cytosolic DNA, detected by cGAS. 2''3''-cGAMP is
  produced, which then activates STING. STING dimerises or oligomerises, and TBK1
  and IRF3 are phosphorylated. IRF3 then translocates to the nucleus resulting in
  the expression of immune genes including CXCL10 and CCL5. Note: other downstream
  activators of the STING pathway, notably TRAF6 and NFκB, are not shown in this instance.
  CXCL10 and CCL5 are implicated in chemoattraction of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells. However
  the tumor microenvironment may also contain immunosuppressive FoxP3+ CD4+ cells
  which express CTLA4, PD-1, PD-L1, LAG3, and TIM3; tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
  which express PD-1, PD-L1, CD80 and CD86, LAG3, and TIM3. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
  (TILs) may express CTLA4, PD-1, TIM3, and LAG3. Therefore, DNA repair deficiency
  results in activation of the cGAS-STING pathway which has both antitumorigenic and
  protumorigenic effects within the tumor microenvironment.'
