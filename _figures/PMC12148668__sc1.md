caption: 'The schematic diagram illustrates the preparation of IFN-γ treated RAW 264.7 cell
  membrane-coated nano-brake (IMφm@GBn) and elucidates their immunomodulatory actions
  for treating psoriasis. (A) The preparation of IMφm@GBn. (B) The mode of action
  by which IMφm@GBn addressed psoriasis. Part I: In the context of immune dysregulation
  characteristic of psoriasis, T cells experience abnormal activation and differentiation
  towards Th17 cells, resulting in an imbalanced Th17/Treg cell ratio. The dysregulated
  immune response would be regulated by the administered IMφm@GBn through the PD-1/PD-L1
  signaling pathway. Part II: IMφm@GBn could scavenge the overloaded ROS in the inflammatory
  milieu and suppress the activation of the NF-κB pathway, thereby mitigating the
  local inflammation. Part III: IMφm@GBn could adsorb and neutralize proinflammatory
  cytokines, alleviating the continued inflammatory stimulus. Herein, IMφm@GBn acted
  as a nano-brake by presenting triple actions to shut down the excessively aberrant
  immune response and remodel the impaired immune microenvironment in skin lesions
  for psoriasis treatment'
