caption: Model for signalling by the ethylene receptor–CTR1 protein complex. The ethylene
  receptor (blue) contains one ethylene-binding site per homodimer, with ethylene
  binding mediated by a single copper ion (Cu) present in the ethylene-binding site.
  CTR1 (shown in orange) interacts with the soluble domain of the receptor and as
  a result of this interaction is localized to the ER. In air, the kinase domain of
  CTR1 actively represses ethylene responses. Binding of ethylene by the receptor
  leads to a conformational change in CTR1 that reduces its kinase activity, thereby
  relieving repression of the ethylene response pathway. Mutations in CTR1 (indicated
  by a white circle) can result in an ethylene-like response in air by two different
  mechanisms. Mutations such as ctr1-1 eliminate the kinase activity of CTR1 so that
  CTR1 is unable to repress the ethylene responses. Mutations such as ctr1-8 disrupt
  the interaction of CTR1 with the receptor, resulting in mis-localization of CTR1
  to the cytosol. Loss-of-function mutations that eliminate multiple members of the
  ethylene receptor family (receptor Δ) also result in mis-localization of CTR1 to
  the cytosol. In the cytosol, CTR1 may adapt a kinase-inactive conformation (as shown
  here) or may not be proximate to the appropriate phosphorylation substrate (figure
  adapted from ).
