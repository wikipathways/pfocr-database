caption: The role played by various miRNAs in glioblastoma (A) proliferation and (B)
  evading growth suppression. (A) The expression of various ligands that bind to receptor
  tyrosine kinases is promoted by specific miRNAs. The PTEN signaling pathway, which
  inhibits proliferation, is downregulated by three specific miRNAs (miR17-5p, miR-23a-3p
  and miR-26a-5p), while the RAS pathway promoting proliferation is upregulated by
  miR-143-3p, miR-123-3p and let5a-5p. (B) The regulation and signaling of cyclin
  D are controlled through numerous miRNAs. The ability of p53 to downregulate growth
  suppression is downregulated by miR10p-5p and MDM2, whose expression is upregulated
  by various miRNAs.
