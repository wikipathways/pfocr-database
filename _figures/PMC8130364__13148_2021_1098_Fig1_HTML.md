caption: Predictive biomarkers and drug combinations of histone methylation inhibitors.
  Prominent biomarkers and drug combinations of histone methyltransferase (HMT) and
  histone demethylase (HDM) inhibitors are detailed here. However, other biomarkers
  and drug combinations also exist. Histone octamer is the basic unit consisting of
  the nucleosome core particle. Me represents methylation. HMTs can methylate arginine
  or lysine of histone, meantime HDMs demethylates methylated histones. The small
  molecule drugs had been developed to inhibit HMT or HDM to regulate an epigenetic
  process in cancer cells. The application of these inhibitors acts as anticancer
  drugs by targeting individual biomarkers through different pathway in a variety
  of tumors. HMT inhibitors include the PRMT inhibitors GSK3368715 and GSK3326595
  and the EZH2 inhibitors tazemetostat, CPI-1205, and GSK2816126. The predicted biomarkers
  for the two PRMT inhibitors are the MTAP and p53-MDM4 axes, respectively. GSK3326595
  combined with immunotherapy can effectively exert synergistic anticancer effects
  in melanoma. The predicted biomarkers of the three EZH2 inhibitors are INI1, the
  PRC2 complex, and BRAF. The combination of CPI-1205 and an anti-CTL4 antibody can
  effectively exert a synergistic anticancer effect in melanoma. LSD1 inhibitors as
  HDM inhibitors include GSK2879552 and tranylcypromine. The DNA hypomethylation levels
  and ZEB2 status are predictive biomarkers for the selection of GSK2879552 sensitive
  patients. In hepatic carcinoma treatment, the combination of GSK2879552 and sorafenib
  exerts improved anticancer effects. In AML, the combination of tranylcypromine with
  mTORC1 inhibitors effectively exerts synergistic anticancer effects
