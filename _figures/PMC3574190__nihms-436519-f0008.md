caption: Further investigation of the cyclization step using base instead of Lewis
  acid with the reaction mixture from 1d and 5 that contained azo compound 7 demonstrated
  that the enolcarbene-generated vinylogous addition product can be converted to the
  ring-closed product through catalysis by sodium hydroxide in ethanol at room temperature.
  The cyclized pyrazole precursor 14 was formed in 59% isolated yield as only one
  diastereoisomer () and was smoothly converted to pyrazole 8i in high yield under
  the same conditions as was reported with Sc(OTf)3 in . The base-promoted reaction
  is consistent with a mechanism through which the hydrazone anion undergoes intramolecular
  Michael addition, and this pathway differs from that of the conventional pyrazole
  synthsis via the Knorr condensation reaction in which a hydrazine anion directly
  attacks the carbonyl carbon. Support for this proposal - that of Michael addition
  instead of attack on the carbonyl group formed by hydrolysis of the vinyl silyl
  ether - comes from a reaction of a hydazone derivative 15 that was formed as a byproduct
  from the Sc(OTf)3-catalyzed reaction of 7; compound 15 has the same structural framework
  as the intermediate of the Knorr reaction. This byproduct (15) did not form the
  pyrazole product under standard Lewis acid conditions with Sc(OTf)3 () even after
  treatment for 24 hours, and only with trifluoroacetic acid did conversion to 8j
  occur.
