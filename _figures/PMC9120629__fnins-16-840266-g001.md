caption: Overview of the complement system. Complement system consists of three main
  ‘recognition systems’; the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, the lectin
  pathway. Each pathway is initiated by different stimuli, which can be either exogenous
  or endogenous danger signals or pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Activation
  of the classical pathway is triggered by detection of antibody-antigen complexes
  by the initiator molecule of the classical pathway, C1q. C1q is then able to activate
  C1r and C1s, which cleave C4 and C2 to form the C3 convertase, C4b2a. The lectin
  pathway is initiated by the recognition of carbohydrates such as mannose upon pathogen
  surfaces by mannan-binding lectin (MBL), a molecule homologous to C1q of the classical
  pathway. MBL activates two serine proteases, MASP-1 and MASP-2, which then act to
  cleave classical pathway components C4 and C2. Activation then proceeds in the same
  manner as the classical pathway, eventually leading to generation of the C4b2a convertase.
  Unlike the classical and lectin pathways, the alternative pathway does not require
  pathogen recognition to initiate activation. Rather, there exists continuous low-level
  activation termed C3 tickover. In this process, the internal thioester bond of circulating
  C3 molecules is hydrolysed due to nucleophilic attack by H2O. This process occurs
  at a slow yet constant rate, leading to the formation of C3(H2O). After a series
  of interactions with C3b and regulatory molecules (Factor B and Factor D), the alternative
  pathway convertase is formed, C3bBb. Convertase complexes resulting from these distinct
  pathways then cleave C3, generating the main effectors of the complement system;
  C3b and C3a. The latter molecule, which is a small peptide, binds to its canonical
  receptor, the GPCR C3aR. The C3a/C3aR axis is a potent mediator of inflammatory
  and anti-inflammatory responses as well as a chemoattractant for macrophages and
  phagocytic cells. This axis appears to contribute to synaptic pruning in neurodegenerative
  contexts. As for C3b, upon deposition on surfaces of pathogens or host cells, this
  molecule attracts phagocytic macrophages, a process known as opsonisation, via complement
  receptor 3 (CR3). In the healthy developing brain, the C3b/CR3 axis has been shown
  to tag weak synapses for elimination by microglia bearing CR3. Unbound C3b molecules
  can also associate with other complement molecules to form a C5 convertase complex.
  C5 is then cleaved in a similar manner to C3, thereby generating cleavage fragments
  C5a and C5b, the former of which is another small peptide anaphylatoxin and inflammatory
  mediator. The cascade of activation continues with C5b and ultimately leads to assembly
  of the terminal complement effector; the membrane attack complex (MAC). Aggregation
  of MAC molecules on a target cell or pathogen creates pores in the cell membrane,
  leading to death by osmotic cell lysis.
