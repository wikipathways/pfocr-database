caption: 'Model of cyanobacterial metabolism during cyanophage infection. (A) In uninfected
  cells, four interrelated pathways combine to make DNA building blocks (nucleotides):
  the light reactions of photosynthesis, the Calvin cycle (the so-called “dark reactions”
  of photosynthesis), the pentose phosphate pathway, and nucleotide biosynthesis.
  (B) In infected cells, host-like genes (blue ovals) acquired by phage over evolutionary
  time are proposed to augment or inhibit key steps in host metabolism, leading to
  increased nucleotide biosynthesis for phage reproduction.'
