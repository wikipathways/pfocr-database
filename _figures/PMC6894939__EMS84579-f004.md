caption: Besides its gluconeogenic function that opposes glycolysis (canonical function),
  FBP1 inhibits glycolytic gene expression by a direct action on different signaling
  pathways (non-canonical function). In kidney cancer cells FBP1 binds to HIF-1α or
  HIF-2α in the nucleus and reduces HIF-induced expression of glycolytic genes. In
  cancer cells, FBP1 expression is frequently decreased to promote glycolysis and
  the Warburg effect.
