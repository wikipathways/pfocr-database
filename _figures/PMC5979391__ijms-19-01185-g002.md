caption: 'Schematic presentation of the surfactant homeostasis of the alveolar epithelial
  cells. (A) A perivesicular F-actin coating is formed around the fused LBs after
  the initial LB fusion pore has developed. Several types of fusion pore development
  are described []: (1) 80% of the F-actin-coated fused LBs release surfactant and
  the LB membrane becomes part of the plasma membrane (kiss-coat-and-release) followed
  by the disappearance of the F-actin coat; (2) 10% of the F-actin-coated fused LBs
  discontinued the fusion process and returned inside the cell (kiss-coat-and-run);
  (3) In the remaining F-actin-coated LBs the fusion process was arrested for a certain
  time (<20 min) (kiss-coat-and-wait) []. The endocytosis of SAs occurs through a
  clathrin-dependent pathway [] by the activation of several types of SP-A receptors
  [,,,,] and a SP-D receptor []. The SP-D receptor is a GPR116, also known as Ig-Hepta
  that are highly expressed in the lung []. Besides SAs uptake, this process also
  inhibits the surfactant exocytosis and contributes to the control of extracellular
  surfactant homeostasis [,]. (B) The activation of the pro-inflammatory response
  of the innate immune system through the activation of the P2X7Rs by extracellular
  ATP at >300 μM concentrations (ATP molecules at these concentrations act as DAMPs)
  leads to the recruitment and activation of neutrophils. The recruited and activated
  neutrophils cause the degradation of SP-D and SP-A leading to a deficiency of SP-D
  and SP-A [,] preventing the clathrin-dependent recycling of the majority of SAs
  and aborting the above-mentioned inhibition of the trafficking, semi-fusion and
  fusion of the LBs with the cell membrane. AT I: Alveolar epithelial type I cell;
  AT II: Alveolar epithelial type II cell; ER: Endoplasmic reticulum; LB: Lamellar
  body; MVB: multivesicular body; SP-A: Surfactant protein A; SP-D: Surfactant protein
  D; SAs: Surfactant small aggregates; LAs: Surfactant large aggregates; GPR116: G
  protein-coupled receptor 116; DAMPs: danger-associated molecular patterns.'
