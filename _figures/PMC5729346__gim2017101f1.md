caption: The abnormalities in the pathway of tyrosine metabolism in tyrosinemia type
  I. Tyrosine is provided both directly from dietary sources and by direct conversion
  of dietary derived phenylalanine through the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase
  (PAH). The catabolic enzymatic activity deficient in tyrosinemia type I (HT-1) is
  indicated (fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH)). The abnormally accumulated products
  due to FAH deficiency are indicated along with their clinical effects. Keratitis
  is not observed in untreated HT-1 patients but when NTBC therapy is used, it produces
  elevations of blood tyrosine, which can produce ophthalmologic complications, including
  keratitis. Succinylacetone is derived from accumulated succinylacetate and is directly
  associated with renal and neurologic effects (Fanconi renal tubular syndrome, porphyric
  type crises) and directly inhibits the pathway for heme synthesis at the porphobilinogen
  synthase activity step. The accumulation of increased levels of δ-aminolevulinic
  acid is associated with the neurologic (porphyric-like) crises observed in untreated
  HT-1. Fumarylacetoacetate accumulation is felt to be directly associated with the
  observed ongoing hepatic and renal damage.
