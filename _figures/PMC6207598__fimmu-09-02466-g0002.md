caption: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their role in the evasion of the immune response
  induced by hMPV. The figure shows the effect of different TLRs in response to hMPV-infection.
  (1) At the surface of the host cell, TLR4 (green receptor) is associated with the
  inhibition of type-I IFN. (2) In the intracellular space, TLR3 (red receptor) is
  involved in the negative regulation of the MyD88/TRAF6/IKKα pathway. (3) The roles
  of TLRs 7 and 9 (purple and yellow receptor, respectively) in hMPV infection are
  currently unclear.
