caption: The Hippo pathway transcription factor TEAD is autopalmitoylated. Autopalmitoylation
  of TEAD may be regulated by intracellular concentration of palmitoyl-CoA, which
  is controlled by fatty acid metabolism. Palmitoylation of TEAD is required for its
  association with YAP and the regulation of transcriptional output of Hippo signaling.
