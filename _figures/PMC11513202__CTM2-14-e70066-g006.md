caption: Relationships between DNA methylation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
  proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis. (A) DNA promoter hypermethylation results
  in the loss of p16INK4a protein expression, which facilitates the binding of CDK4
  and CCND1, then activating the cell cycle. Meanwhile, DNA promoter hypermethylation
  also reduces p14ARF protein expression, impairs its binding with MDM‐2 and leads
  to the degradation of the tumour suppressor gene p53, failing to inhibit the cell
  cycle finally. (B) Hypermethylation of caspase‐8 (CASP8) promotor results in silencing
  of CASP8 gene expression and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Also, hypermethylation of
  TMS1 promoter leads to reduced TMS1 protein expression and ineffective blocking
  of nuclear factor‐kappa B (NF‐κB) and downstream tumour survival‐related genes’
  transcription, then inhibiting cell apoptosis. (C) Hypomethylation of chymase 1,
  tyrosine kinase nonreceptor 2, transforming growth factor beta receptor II (TGFβR)
  and vascular endothelial growth factors 2 and 3 (VEGF2/3) gene promoters leads to
  increased expression of these genes. Increased expression of these genes affects
  the interaction between tumour cells and vascular endothelial cells and contributes
  to the angiogenesis. Finally, all these above DNA methylation‐related pathways contribute
  to the metastasis and patients’ death in HCC
