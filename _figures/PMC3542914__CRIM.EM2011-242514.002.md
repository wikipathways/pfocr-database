caption: The main metabolic pathway of propofol. In phase I, the metabolism of propofol
  to 2,6-diisopropyl-1,4-quinol by cytochrome P450 is the rate-limiting step in the
  formation of 1-QS, 4-QG, and 4-QS. In phase II, the major metabolite was a glucuronic
  acid conjugate of propofol (propofol-glucuronide) and the minor metabolites were
  quinol derivatives (1-QG, 4-QG, and 4-QS) [].
