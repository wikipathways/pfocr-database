caption: 'Overview of auxin pathways and their expression profiles and content of
  indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in different graft combinations. The value of log2(readcount)
  + 2 was represented using the depth of color, with sea-green representing high expression
  and orange representing low expression. Note: AUX1 represent auxin resistant 1;
  TIR1 represent transport inhibitor response l; AUX/IAA represent auxin/indole acetic
  acid; ARF represent auxin response factors; GH3 represent gretchen hagen 3; SAUR
  represent small auxin upregulated RNA; Arrows with solid and dashed lines represent
  the related pathway and the abbreviated pathway, respectively.'
