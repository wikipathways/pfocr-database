caption: (A) Post-replication repair of ssDNA gaps. Leading strand synthesis arrested
  at DNA lesions (red rectangular shapes) can be reprimed downstream of lesions, leaving
  ssDNA gaps behind the replication fork. Repair of ssDNA gaps is mediated by RAD6
  and RAD18, which are recruited by RPA to ssDNA gaps, where they monoubiquitinate
  PCNA. Monoubiquitinated PCNA associates with translesion polymerases, which promote
  lesion bypass. Alternatively, polyubiquitination of PCNA by SHPRH, HLTF and UBC13
  induces template switching and strand invasion into homologous sequences of the
  sister chromatid. Template switching could possibly involve proteins interacting
  with polyubiquitinated PCNA. Resolution of Holliday junctions formed after strand
  invasion can then result in sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), whereas HJ dissolution
  and SDSA do not generate SCEs. (B) Repair of interstrand crosslinks. Converging
  replication forks blocked by interstrand crosslinks (red rectangle) activate the
  FA pathway. The FA core complex associated to blocked replication forks through
  the FANCM complex promotes the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2/FANCI (ID) complex.
  Phosphorylation of FANCI by ATR regulates the ubiquitination of the ID complex and
  its subsequent relocalization to blocked replication forks. Monoubiquitinated ID
  complex promotes fork cleavage, probably through the interaction with FAN1 and possibly
  other nucleases, translesion synthesis and crosslink excision. DSB resection, which
  could be dependent on FAN1, in addition to CtIP/MRN, BLM and EXO1, leads to strand
  invasion and homologous recombination with or without formation of SCEs as described
  in (A). Post-translational modifications are indicated as in .
