caption: Psoriasis initiation begins with environmental triggers and/or loss of tolerance,
  which leads to activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and IL-23-producing
  dermal DCs. Several pro-inflammatory DC cell populations present psoriasis autoantigens
  and trigger T17 cell polarization and clonal expansion. Activated T17 cells produce
  key cytokines including IL-17, IL-26, IL-29, and TNFα that act on epidermal keratinocytes
  to promote a feed-forward inflammatory response in skin. IL-17 acting alone or synergistically
  with TNFα induces expression of psoriasis-related genes in keratinocytes leading
  to epidermal hyperplasia and the production of antimicrobial peptides (e.g. hBD2,
  S100s, and LL37/cathelicidin). Keratinocyte-derived CCR20 recruits CCR6+ cells (IL-23-producing
  TIP-DCs and IL-17-producing T cells) to further promote inflammation. CXCL1/2/3/5/8
  are also produced by keratinocytes and recruit neutrophils and macrophages into
  inflamed skin. IL-23 promotes the clonal expansion and differentiation of T22 cells
  that produce IL-22, which works together with IL-19/IL-36γ to alter the terminal
  differentiation and proliferation of keratinocytes. IL-12 produced by activated
  DCs as well as keratinocyte-derived CXCL9/10/11 promotes the influx of Th1 cells
  into lesional psoriatic skin. Type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in the skin also
  produce IL-17 and IL-22, which contribute to the development of skin inflammation.
