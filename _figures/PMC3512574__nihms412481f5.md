caption: (A) A TGFβ-activated Smad complex in epithelial cells represses c-MYC expression
  (right panel) and facilitates the induction of CDK inhibitory genes (left panel).
  Smad-FoxO complexes target p15INK4b and p21CIP1 for transcriptional induction, leading
  to CDK inhibition. The resulting surge of p15Ink4b releases p27Kip1 from a latent
  Cdk4-bound state to inhibit CDKs further. FoxO factors can be inhibited by the antagonistic
  family member FoxG1 or by Akt-mediated phosphorylation in tumors with a hyperactive
  PI3K-Akt pathway. Overexpression of the C/EBPβ isoform LIP in metastatic breast
  cancer inhibits C/EBPβ, a common partner of c-MYC and p15INK5b regulatory Smad complexes.(B)
  Different cell types engage different CDK inhibitor in their TGFβ cytostatic response,
  whereas c-MYC downregulation is a general feature of the response.(C) p16INK4a induction
  by endogenous sensors of hyperactive Ras (or other oncogenic signals) collaborates
  with p15INK4b to mediate tumor suppression.(D) ID1 repression creates conditions
  for terminal differentiation and senescence. Differential effects of BMP and TGFβ
  on ID1 expression are based on the ability of TGFβ-activated Smads to recruit the
  transcriptional repression factor ATF3 to the ID1 regulatory region. Expression
  of ATF3 itself is induced by the Smad pathway.
