caption: A summarized pathway for the formation of urolithins from ellagitannin and
  ellagic acid in the gut. Following the ingestion of food containing ellagitannins,
  they are hydrolyzed in the stomach to yield ellagic acid. The ellagic acid then
  undergoes series of transformations by the gut microbiota forming different urolithin
  molecules. Created with ChemSketch and BioRender.com.
