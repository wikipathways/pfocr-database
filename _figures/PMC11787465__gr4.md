caption: The intricate signaling pathways and functional networks of miR-23 in tumor
  cell biology. miR-23a and miR-23b regulate various genes and pathways that affect
  tumor development and progression. Key pathways depicted include the p65/miR-23a/CCL22
  axis, the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,
  and mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by GLS. The isoforms of miR-23 displayed
  different expression patterns in HCC, OC and lymphoma cells, but can all affect
  tumor growth. miR-23a undertake more roles in promotes tumor growth through multiple
  mechanisms, including its regulation of tumor proliferation and metastasis, cell
  cycle progression, and microvascular proliferation. The diagram also highlights
  the involvement of lncRNAs, such as LINC00909 Malat1 and MEG3, in modulating miR-23a/23b
  function and tumor behavior. Moreover, the interactions between miR-23a/23b and
  genes like NF-κB, β-catenin, p16/CDH13, and KEAP1 suggest their importance in tumor
  cell proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance. This figure was drawn by Figdraw
