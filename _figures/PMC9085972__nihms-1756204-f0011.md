caption: BAG3-TBC1D10B-Rab35 signaling axis regulates ESCRT and endosomal tau clearance.
  (A) During normal aging, BAG3 level increases (represented by large green shape),
  promoting the association of TBC1D10B-BAG3-HSP70. This prevents TBC1D10B from inactivating
  Rab35, leading to Hrs recruitment and initiation of ESCRT-mediated endosomal tau
  clearance. (B) In AD brains, however, this increase of BAG3 may be attenuated (represented
  by small green shape) (), which would release TBC1D10B from the TBC1D10B-BAG3-HSP70
  complex. Free TBC1D10B would thus be able to inactivate Rab35 and prevents endosomal
  clearance of tau, leading to accumulation over time.
