caption: Resistance mechanisms in MAPK-inhibitor treated melanoma. Resistance to BRAF
  inhibitors can occur through activating NRAS mutations (*), loss of the RAS suppressor
  NF1, BRAF amplification or alternative splicing leading to BRAF truncations (semicircles
  B*), overexpression or mutation of the MEK activators CRAF, COT/TPL2/MAP3K8 or MLKs
  as well as MEK mutations (*). Addition of a MEK inhibitor can buffer some of these
  resistance mechanisms, but eventually enhanced resistance signaling will overcome
  its effects. While ERK is inhibited -particularly in the initial phases of treatment-
  MITF expression is up-regulated and contributes to drug-tolerance. Solid arrows
  indicate signaling induced by mutant BRAF, dashed arrows indicate signaling brought
  about by the various resistance mechanisms.
