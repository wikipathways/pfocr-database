caption: c-Met activates MAP kinase (Raf/Mek/Erk) and PI3K/Akt signaling to induce
  HCC growth and survival. The PI3K/Akt arm of the c-Met signaling pathway normally
  suppresses EGFR pathway members (i.e. TGF-α and ErbB3), thus suppressing EGFR pathway
  activity. Suppression of c-Met signaling leads to loss of PI3K/Akt activity, and
  thus up-regulation of TGF-α and ErbB3 members of the EGFR signaling pathway. ErbB3
  can heterodimerize with ErbB1 (EGFR), forming a potent EGFR receptor. Additionally,
  EGFR ligand TGF-α stimulates EGFR pathway activation, leading to cancer cell growth
  and survival. Targeting both EGFR and c-Met suppress pathway cross talk and leads
  to greater suppression of tumor growth and survival.
