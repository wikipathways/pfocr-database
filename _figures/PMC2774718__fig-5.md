caption: Downstream effects of Ras glutathionylation in response to exogenous peroxinitrite
  or oxLDL. This figure depicts distinct downstream events resulting from Ras glutathionylation
  in bovine aortic endothelial cells in response to peroxinitrite added exogenously
  (left) or generated endogenously in response to oxLDL exposure (right) as reported
  by Clavreul et al. (, ). In response to ONOO− treatment, Ras glutathionylation leads
  to transient phosphorylation of ERK and Akt; however, subsequent downstream signaling
  events remain unknown. oxLDL exposure (which leads to ONOO− production in situ)
  also caused Ras-SSG-dependent, transient Akt phosphorylation (center); however,
  it induced a sustained time course of ERK phosphorylation (right) as well as diminished
  Akt activation in response to a subsequent stimulus (insulin). The decreased insulin-induced
  Akt activation conferred by oxLDL pretreatmentcould be explained by ERK-induced
  phosphorylation (and inactivation) of IRS, which is upstream of Akt in the insulin
  signaling pathway.

    The decreased insulin-induced Akt activation conferred by oxLDL pretreatmentcould
