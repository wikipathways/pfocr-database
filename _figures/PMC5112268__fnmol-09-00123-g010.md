caption: The Akt-protein phosphatase signaling pathway involved in regulating GSK3β
  phosphorylation. Active Akt (i.e., phosphorylated) inactivates GSK3β by phosphorylation
  at S9. Protein phosphatases can modulate GSK3β phosphorylation at S9 via two routes.
  (1) Protein phosphatases inactivate Akt by dephosphorylation, and (2) protein phosphatases
  activate GSK3β by directly dephosphorylating S9. Inhibition of Akt (with inhibitors
  such as AZD-5363) increases non-phosphorylated GSK3β by suppressing Akt-mediated
  phosphorylation of GSK3β. Inhibition of protein phosphatases (with inhibitors such
  as calyculin A) causes a decrease in non-phosphorylated GSK3β through the Akt pathway
  by increasing active Akt (the grayed portion of the Akt cycle). Protein phosphatase
  inhibition also leads to decreased non-phosphorylated GSK3β independent of Akt by
  directly dephosphorylating S9 in GSK3β. If an Akt inhibitor is applied followed
  by a protein phosphatase inhibitor the Akt-independent pathway can be evaluated.
