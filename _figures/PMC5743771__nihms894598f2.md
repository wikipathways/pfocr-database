caption: The in vivo pathways for disposal of excess cellular – in this case, macrophage
  – cholesterol from the organism, so called ‘reverse cholesterol transport,’ are
  depicted. Proteins in green font are encoded by LXR target genes, and are thus upregulated
  by LXR agonists (note, however, that cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member
  1 [CYP7A1] is an LXR target in mice and not humans, and cholesteryl ester transfer
  protein [CETP] is expressed in humans but not mice). ATP Binding Cassette (ABC)A1
  in enterocytes and hepatocytes generates plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) by
  lipidation of plasma apolipoprotein (apo)A-I. HDL in turn induces cholesterol efflux
  from macrophages via cooperative interactions with ABCA1 and ABCG1. HDL-associated
  cholesterol can then either be cleared via hepatocyte scavenger receptor (SR)-BI,
  or transferred to apoB100-containing lipoproteins via CETP in exchange for triglyceride
  (TG). Finally, apoB100-lipoprotein cholesterol is cleared from the plasma either
  by hepatocyte low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), or by trans-enterocyte transfer
  into the gut lumen, the so-called ‘trans-intestinal cholesterol excretion’ (TICE)
  pathway. Hepatic cholesterol that is not used to assemble very LDL (VLDL) mnplasma
  particles can be excreted into the biliary system (and from there into the gut lumen),
  either via ABCG5/8-dependent transport as free cholesterol, or as bile acids, after
  conversion by CYP7A1. In enterocytes, LXR upregulates ABCA1 (driving HDL production)
  and ABCG5/8 (promoting cholesterol efflux into gut lumen), and downregulates Niemann
  Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) protein (reducing uptake of luminal cholesterol). Taken
  together, enterocyte LXR increases plasma HDL, reduces cholesterol absorption, and
  promotes cholesterol excretion. Hepatic LXR increases plasma HDL and promotes biliary
  cholesterol excretion. Hepatic LXR also induces the lipogenic genes sterol response
  element binding protein (SREBP)-1c, fatty acid synthase (FAS), and stearoyl coA-desaturase
  (SCD)1, as well as inducible degrader of the LDLR (IDOL). In rodent models, treatment
  with LXR agonists drives fecal excretion of macrophage-derived cholesterol (ie,
  RCT). HL, hepatic lipase; IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein; LPL, lipoprotein
  lipase.
