caption: Activation and function of the MEK5/ERK5 pathway in vascular endothelium.
  Laminar shear stress (LSS) induced by the steady blood flow through the vasculature
  results in phosphorylation of MEK5 in ECs, which subsequently phosphorylates ERK5
  at a TEY-motif at threonine 219 and tyrosine 221 [] (highlighted in red color).
  Subsequently, ERK5 autophosphorylates its C-terminus at multiple sites (including
  T733, shown as representative residue in dark orange) [], leading to a change in
  conformation and nuclear localization of ERK5. Within the nucleus, ERK5 induces
  protective gene expression via transcriptional induction of the Krüppel-like factor
  2 and 4 (KLF2/KLF4) transcription factors, thereby inhibiting apoptosis, inflammation,
  focal adhesion turnover, migration, and endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT)
  [,,,,]. Even though KLF2 and KLF4 can act functionally redundant in an overexpression
  situation, some functions may dominantly be controlled by only one of the two KLFs.
  For example, KLF2 induction alone is responsible for PAK1 repression, which contributes
  to the anti-migratory effect of ERK5 activation []. By contrast, BCAR1 suppression,
  which has been implicated in the inhibition of focal adhesion turnover [] requires
  both KLF2 and KLF4 [].
