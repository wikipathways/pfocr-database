caption: Two different NF-κB signaling pathways. The classic (canonical) pathway (left)
  is activated by a large number of agonists, such as TNF-α, IL-1, lipopolysaccharide,
  and T-cell receptors. The activation of this pathway depends on the inhibitor of
  the κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) complex (IKKα/β and NEMO), which phosphorylates IκBα (Ser32,
  36) to induce rapid degradation. This pathway is essential for immune responses,
  inflammation, tumorigenesis, and cell survival. The alternative (noncanonical) pathway
  (right) is activated by a limited number of agonists, which are involved in secondary
  lymphoid organogenesis. This pathway requires NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IKKα.
  These kinases induce the slow processing of p100 to generate p52, resulting in the
  dimerization and activation of the p52/RelB heterodimer. The activation of NF-κB
  signaling stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption and suppresses bone formation.
