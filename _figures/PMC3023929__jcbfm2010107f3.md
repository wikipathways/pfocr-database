caption: Details of GABA synthesis and trafficking. (A) A detail of the metabolic
  pathway showing the reactions in the neuron related to the GABA synthesis. The reported
  values correspond to the experiment summarized in , in which the substrate availability
  is 50% of the reference value for the tissue, the activity level is high, and glutamine
  transport is favored by a prior. (B) A summary of metabolic pathways comprising
  the fate of carbon skeletons related to GABA synthesis and release. The width of
  the arrows is proportional to the value of the corresponding flux; reactions and
  transports strongly positively correlated over the collected ensemble are identified
  by stars. GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid.
