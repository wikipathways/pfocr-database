caption: Cytotoxic pathways of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ExoA). After cleavage of the
  C-terminal lysine (K) by plasma carboxypeptidases (PCPs), ExoA binds to the CD91
  receptor on the cell membrane (CM) and can then exploit different pathways to reach
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). On the one side, ExoA is internalized via clathrin-coated
  pits (CCPs) into the cell. This is followed by furin cleavage in the early endosomes
  (EEs) in cooperation with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and chaperones (Chaps).
  Then, the enzymatic active ExoA fragment travels via late endosomes (LEs) in a Rab9-dependent
  manner to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). After binding to the KDEL receptor (KDEL-R),
  ExoA is transported to the ER under control of the tyrosine kinase Src. On the other
  side, CD91-bound ExoA can associate with detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs)
  and is transported via caveosomes (CSs) to the EE in a Rab5-dependent manner. After
  cleavage in the EE, the toxic ExoA fragment directly travels to the ER via a lipid-dependent
  sorting pathway under the control of Rab6. ExoA fragments in the ER are secreted
  via the translocon Sec61p into the cytosol, where they inhibit the protein synthesis
  by ADP-ribosylating the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) at the ribosomes (Rs).
  This finally leads to apoptosis of the host cell. Figure was taken from reference
