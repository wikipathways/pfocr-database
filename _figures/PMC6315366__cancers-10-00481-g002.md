caption: 'Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway in non-stressed, oxidative stress state and HCC cells.
  Keap1 has three characteristic domains: BTB, IVR and DGR domains. In the unstressed
  condition, Keap1 promotes Nrf2 degradation so that the level of Nrf2 remains very
  low. During oxidative stress, Nrf2 gets activated to maintain redox homeostasis.
  In HCC, sustained Nrf2 activation leads to cellular proliferation and resistance
  against drugs.'
