caption: 'Metabolic consequences of ICL-deficient Mtb when metabolizing fatty acid
  carbon sources. Metabolic state of central carbon metabolism in wild-type Mtb is
  shown in Left. Genetic or chemical inactivation of ICLs in Mtb leads to metabolic
  perturbation when cultured in media containing fatty acids (Right). As shown in
  Right, inactivation of ICLs converts the methylcitrate cycle (red line) into a dead-end
  pathway. Fatty acid-mediated metabolic perturbation in ICL-deficient Mtb is primarily
  due to (i) constitutive depletion of the TCA cycle and gluconeogenic pathway intermediates;
  (ii) secondary accumulation of 2-MC, allosterically inhibiting the gluconeogenic
  enzyme, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase); and (iii) tertiary accumulation of
  propionyl-CoA and/or methylmalonyl-CoA, following broad secondary impact on metabolic
  homeostasis including NAD/NADH, membrane potential (Δψ), and intrabacterial pH,
  which are essential factors for cell viability. TCA cycle (green line); glyoxylate
  shunt (blue line); methylcitrate cycle (red line); VB12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA
  pathway (purple line); gluconeogenic pathway (black line). Mtb ICLs encode a bifunctional
  enzyme: isocitrate lyase activity (blue colored dotted line) and methylisocitrate
  lyase activity (red colored dotted line).'
