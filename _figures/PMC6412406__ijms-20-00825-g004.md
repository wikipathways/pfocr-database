caption: KEGG analysis of identified proteins on chemo-blended Ag NPs’ exposure. Pathway
  of glycolysis mapped by KEGG based on identified proteins treated with chemo-blended
  Ag NPs. Wheat plants were treated with Ag NPs mixed with organic and inorganic chemicals.
  Each square of black and white indicates a decreased or increased response, respectively,
  in ratio compared with untreated plants.
