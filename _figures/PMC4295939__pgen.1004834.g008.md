caption: This atypical interaction perturbs the efficacy of DNA repair, leading to
  the persistent accumulation of DNA damage/strand breaks in SCA3. The wild-type ATXN3
  binds with and stimulates PNKP’s enzymatic activity to repair damaged DNA, contributing
  to genomic DNA sequence integrity and neuronal survival. By contrast, mutant ATXN3
  interacts with and decreases PNKP’s 3’-phosphatase activity, leading to the persistent
  accumulation of DNA damage in the post-mitotic neurons and resulting in chronic
  activation of the DNA damage-response ATM→p53 signaling pathway in SCA3. This triggers
  apoptosis by increasing expression of such p53 target genes as BAX, PUMA and NOXA
  in SCA3. In parallel, activated ATM phosphorylates c-Abl kinase, which in turn phosphorylates
  PKCδ, facilitating nuclear translocation of PKCδ and thus further amplifying the
  pro-apoptotic output in SCA3 ultimately leading to neuronal death in SCA3.
