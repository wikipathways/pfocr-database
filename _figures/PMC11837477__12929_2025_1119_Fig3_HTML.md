caption: 'The EGFR role in the placenta development. This image shows both EGFR role
  in the generation of healthy placenta and in the Preeclampsia disease, due to its
  dysregulation. A, B Healthy placenta: A EGFR leads to a reduction of KISS1, via
  AKT activation and ID3 downregulation, promoting trophoblast cell invasion, essential
  to anchor placental villi to the maternal decidua. B Trophoblast cellular invasion
  and embryo implantation are favored by extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling due
  to activation of different metalloproteases expression, such as MMP9 and MMP2, upon
  EGF/EGFR signaling in trophoblast cells. C, D, Preeclampsia disorder: C The upregulation
  of EGFR, caused by hypoxic condition, leads to the activation of ERK1/2 and STAT3,
  and induces the secretion of the antiangiogenic molecule sFlt-1 (soluble FMS-like
  tyrosine kinase-1) from placenta. sFlt-1 sequesters VEGF and impairs VEGFR activation,
  affecting angiogenesis process in the placenta. D Bisphenol S (BPS) plays a role
  as ligand of EGFR, impairing its downstream signaling pathways activation and causing
  a reduction of proliferation and invasion of extravillous trophoblast cells. These
  events affect the development of placenta'
