caption: A hypothetical model of regulatory links between S− and ethylene sensing
  and signaling. Only the selected metabolites, enzymes and other players are presented.
  The black arrow represents one-step or multiple-step signaling or metabolic pathway
  progress. Colored arrows (gray, red, blue, green, orange) represent regulatory mechanisms
  reported in the published studies. At the current stage, most of these mechanisms
  are obscurely documented and need further research. Additionally, the S status sensor
  is elusive.
