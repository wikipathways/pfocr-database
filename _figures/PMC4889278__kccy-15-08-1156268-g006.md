caption: Upon tumor progression E-cadherin downregulation leads to an increase of
  the proportion of CSCs and acquisition of the ability to form secondary foci of
  tumor growth. E-cadherin repression results in elevation of genes maintaining stemness
  – Oct3/4, SOX2, Nestin and c-Myc playing a role in acquisition of CSCs features.
  A possible mechanism for the enhancement of CSCs properties may be the translocation
  of β-catenin to the nucleus and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (partly
  through c-MYC increased transcription).
