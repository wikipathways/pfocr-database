caption: CSC-Exos play a role in the regulation of the tumor microenvironment (TME).
  Exosomes derived from pancreatic cancer (PaCa) cells are rich of miR-155 and promote
  the differentiation of fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) by
  downregulating the level of TP53INP1 protein in fibroblasts. Proteins carried by
  CSC-Exos, such as HSP72 and HSP70, target downstream Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)
  to activate myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to promote the formation of
  the TME. miR-92a loaded in exosomes derived from K562 tumor cells interacts with
  the proangiogenic protein integrin α5, causing endothelial cell (EC) migration and
  primitive vascular lumen formation. Breast cancer-derived exosomes contain miR-105,
  which downregulates the expression of ZO-1 to increase the permeability of tumor
  blood vessels in the TME. Gastric cancer cell-derived exosomes (GC-Exos) carry TGF-β,
  which induces human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) to differentiate
  into CAFs through the TGF-β/Smad pathway. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-2) riched in CSC-Exos activate the
  MAPK signaling pathway of monocytes and inhibit the cleavage of caspases, which
  contributes to the formation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).
