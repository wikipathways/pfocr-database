caption: 'Rapid degradation of HIF-1α by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, during
  normoxia. Under hypoxic conditions, prolyl-hydroxylase activity is attenuated, which
  decreases the proteasomal degradation of intracellular HIF-1α. 2-OG analogues such
  as ICA can also result in HIF accumulation. The accumulated HIF-1α heterodimerizes
  with HIF-1β [aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator protein (ARNT)] and
  translocates into the nucleus. The HIF-1 complex binds to DNA regulatory sequences
  (HRE), leading to subsequent transcription of target genes including VEGF, EPO and
  NOS (modified after Xia et al. Toxicol Sci. 2009 []). HIF-1α: hypoxia-inducible
  transcription factor-1α; ICA: 2-(1-chloro-4-hydroxyisoquinoline-3-carboxamido) acetate;
