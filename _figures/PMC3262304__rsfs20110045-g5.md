caption: Examples of functional equivalence classes within the process of tRNA synthesis
  and activation from the bacterial operating system. (a) In Escherichia coli, the
  endogenous type A RNase P RNA can be substituted by a type B RNase P RNA []. It
  can also be substituted by PROP1, a proteinaceous RNase P from plant mitochondria
  (Arabidopsis thaliana) []. (b) (i) Lysyl-tRNA synthetases (LysRS) have been found
  in different organisms and are categorized as either class I or class II. Substituting
  a class II bacterial LysRS by a class I archaeal LysRS still allows the bacteria
  to operate the COS []. (ii) The direct pathway of amino acylation of glutaminyl
  tRNA found in E. coli can potentially be substituted by an indirect pathway involving
  first mischarging of tRNAgln with Glu by glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) to form
  glutamyl tRNAGln. Then, glutamyl tRNAGln is converted into glutaminyl tRNAgln by
  Glu-tRNAGln amidotransferase (Glu-AdT) []. (c) The process of maturation of 5′-leader
  pre-tRNA by RNase P does not exist anymore in Nanoarchaeum equitans. Instead, the
  tRNA genes code for tRNA precursors without 5′ leader because transcription starts
  now at the level of the mature 5′ end []. With respect to mature tRNAs production
  for translation, the Nanoarchaeum process is expected to be equivalent to the RNase
  P-dependent one. However, this remains to be tested in vivo. Colour code for reaction
  processes is the same as in c.
