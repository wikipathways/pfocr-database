caption: CircRNAs in NF-κB pathway. NF-κB controls inflammation, cancer cell proliferation
  and survival. There are 4 circRNAs (circGLIS2/miR-671, ciRS‐7/miR-7, cZNF292, and
  circANKRD12) that are significantly upregulated and 2 circRNAs (circRNA-000911/miR-449a
  and circC3P1/miR-4641) that are downregulated. Their functions coupled with miRNAs
  in the pathway are indicated in the figure
