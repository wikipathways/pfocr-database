caption: Multiple mechanisms for regulating TMEM16A expression in inflammation. TMEM16A
  expression is upregulated in epithelial cells by Th2 cytokine IL-4/IL-13/STAT6 signaling
  activation in many inflammatory airway diseases, such as asthma, CRSwNP, eosinophilic
  esophagitis. In acute pancreatitis, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 increases
  TMEM16A expression level in pancreatic acinar cells via the IL-6R/STAT3 signaling
  pathway. EGF promotes TMEM16A upregulation in airway epithelial cells via the PI3K
  signaling pathway. LPS induced TMEM16A expression in intestinal epithelial cells
  via the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, TMEM16A expression is regulated by
  miR-9 in many inflammatory diseases such as CF, IPF, and LPS-induced sepsis.
