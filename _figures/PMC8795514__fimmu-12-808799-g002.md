caption: Synthesis of D-lactate through the methylglyoxal pathway. D-lactate is derived
  from carbohydrate metabolism through the formation of methylglyoxal (MG). Furthermore,
  MG can be derived from protein catabolism with formation of aminoacetone, and lipids
  metabolism, through reactions catalyzed by glycerol kinase and glycerol-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase. In the process of detoxification of MG, D-lactate is produced. MS,
