caption: Scheme of the proposed mechanism by which SFI increases eNOS activity. Administration
  of SFI results in an increase in the gene and protein expression of eNOS and promotes
  the eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 but inhibits the eNOS phosphorylation at Thr
  495 and decreases the Cav-1 content, ultimately resulting in enhanced NO production.
  This effect was antagonized by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibitor LY294002.
  The inhibitor used and its location of action is also indicated.
