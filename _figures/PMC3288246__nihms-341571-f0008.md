caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism for radiation-induced
  EMT in alveolar type II epithelial cells. Radiation-induced generation of ROS leads
  to activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Activated ERK1/2 causes the inactivation
  of GSK3ß by phosphorylation of the serine 9 active site, which leads to the disassociation
  of Snail from GSK3ß. Snail then translocates to the nucleus where it functions as
  a repressor of E-cadherin and initiate EMT in AE2 cells.
