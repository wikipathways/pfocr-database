caption: (I) The seven PKS enzymes (MadAI-MadAVIII) and predicted linear tetromadurin
  intermediates of the mad gene cluster. ATa domains contain the amino acid motifs
  associated with malonyl-CoA (acetate unit) incorporation. ATp domains contain the
  amino acid motifs associated with (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA (propionate unit) incorporation.
  The ATm domain is predicted to recognise (2R)-methoxymalonyl-ACP. ERD domains are
  predicted to create a D-configured α-methyl group. B1 KRs are predicted to create
  D-configured α-methyl and β-hydroxyl groups. The KS domain in MadAI is a KSQ domain.
  The red crosses indicate domains that are predicted to be inactive on the basis
  of their amino acid sequence. (II) The key biosynthetic precursor 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate,
  involved in both tetronate formation and (2R)-methoxymalonyl-ACP biosynthesis. (III)
  Formation of glyceryl-ACP by the FkbH-like enzyme Mad14 and the ACP Mad12. (IV)
  Oxidation of glyceryl-ACP by the dehydrogenase Mad11 to form 2-hydroxy-3-oxopropionyl-ACP.
  (V) Oxidation of 2-hydroxy-3-oxopropionyl-ACP by the dehydrogenase Mad13 to form
  hydroxymalonyl-ACP. (VI) Methylation of hydroxymalonyl-ACP by the O-methyltransferase
  Mad15 to form (2R)-methoxymalonyl-ACP. (VII) The (2R)-methoxylmalonyl-ACP is incorporated
  by the MadAVI_AT_13. (VIII) Synthesis of a second pool of glyceryl-ACP by FkbH-like
  Mad7 and ACP Mad8. (IX) Glyceryl-ACP is a substrate of the FabH-like protein Mad16
  that catalyses tetronate formation and concomitant chain release from the PKS. Bonds/atoms
  have been coloured red to highlight the chemical change.
