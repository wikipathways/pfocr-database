caption: 'path regulates translational capacity. (A) path is required for maximum
  translational output in non-neuronal cells. Luciferase mRNA levels and Luciferase
  activity were assayed in larval body wall extracts of wild type and path mutants
  expressing a UAS-Rluc-Fluc bicistronic reporter transgene in epithelial cells (A58-Gal4).
  mRNA levels reflect ΔΔCt values for Luciferase relative to β-tubulin in larval body
  wall lysates (n=6). For Luciferase activity, the mean and standard deviation from
  6 samples is shown. ns, not significant (>0.05P), *<0.05P, unpaired t-test with
  Welch''s correction. Genotypes: wt, w118;UAS-RLucFluc/+; A58-Gal4/+; path, w118;
  UAS-RLucFluc/+; A58-Gal4, pathdg50/DF(3L)BSC773. (B) Putative pathway (left) and
  model (right) for Path-mediated control of translational capacity. The N-terminal
  intracellular domain of Path plays a critical role in growth control, perhaps by
  linking Path to currently unknown signaling molecules (question mark). Some evidence
  supports a role for TORC1 downstream of Path, but we speculate that additional pathways,
  possibly including eIF2 kinases, contribute to translational control by Path. Though
  a baseline level of translation occurs even in the absence of Path protein, Path
  is required for maximal translational output.'
