caption: 'Crosstalk between UPR and autophagy. The autophagic process involves a molecular
  crosstalk with UPR transducers: (i) PERK/eIF2α pathway induces the expression of
  autophagy-related genes through ATF4; and (ii) the activation of XBP1, downstream
  to IRE1, favors the recruitment of soluble LC3-I to the membranous structures, giving
  rise to the autophagosome, and to its transformation into LC3-II, the membrane-associated
  form of LC3-I. The autophagosome complex, conjugated with LC3-II, captures organelles
  or molecules destined for degradation and merges with lysosome-expressing integral
  membrane proteins, LAMPs (1,2,3), and this leads to the formation of the autolysosome
  complex.'
