caption: The adopted mechanisms for anti-inflammatory effects of GNPs include; (1)
  modulation of MAPK and PI3K pathways in Kupffer cells (liver macrophages) and hepatic
  cells, and the MAPK pathway, a key mechanism of inflammatory signal transduction
  from the cell surface to the nucleus, which leads to activate transcription factors
  and alterations in gene expression following LPS binding to TLRs. The PI3K pathway
  is involved in gene expression, protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and cytokine
  stimulation. GNPs negatively regulate Kupffer and hepatic satellite cells’ activity
  and affect their pro-inflammatory cytokine profile and oxidative stress via the
  modulation of AKT/PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways. In addition, the GNP treatments
  could reduce the activation of NF-κB through ERK1/2MAPK/Akt/tuberin-mTOR pathway-mediated
  targeted inflammatory gene expression and cellular stress responses. (2) Significant
  inhibiting the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines such as LPS-triggered
  TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-17, which can downregulate IL-1β-induced epithelial cells proliferation.
  Moreover, GNPs could decrease the raised level of IL-12 production, which could
  leads to a change in the cell-mediated immune response of pro-inflammatory response
  (TH1) to anti-inflammatory response (TH2). (3) Reducing ROS production; the reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) are oxygen metabolites (OH−, O2−, H2O2) that have potent oxidizing
  features and can oxidize proteins and lipids in the cells and causes DNA damage.
  Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are a combination of superoxide anion (O2−) and
  NO, which induce nitrosative stress and promotes the production of ROS. GNPs could
  lead to satiating and downregulating the phagocyte-produced ROS in a dose-dependent
  manner. Therefore, GNPs act as potential anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agents.
