caption: Model of agonist and antagonist roles for Ang2 on Tie2 function. In quiescent,
  mature vessels, Ang1 promotes strong activation of the Tie2/PI3K/AKT pathway. Ang2
  expression is low because of AKT-mediated inhibition of the FOXO1 transcription
  factor. Low AKT activity, for example, when Ang1/Tie2 signaling is weak, results
  in activation of FOXO1 and increased Ang2 expression. In this setting, Ang2 activates
  Tie2 phosphorylation, thereby compensating for the absence of a strong Ang1 signal.
  As discussed in the text, some evidence indicates that Ang2 promotes tumor angiogenesis
  via activation of Tie2. Expression of Ang2 can also be induced during inflammation,
  perhaps by TNFα or other cytokines. In this setting, Ang2 may cause a decrease in
  Tie2 phosphorylation, by competing with the strong agonist Ang1. Inhibition of Tie2
  signaling appears to make the endothelium more responsive to inflammatory stimuli.
  It should be stressed that only in very few instances have changes in Tie2 phosphorylation
  been directly measured in vivo. Thus, as discussed in the text, models of Ang2 mechanism
  of action are based largely on indirect evidence.
