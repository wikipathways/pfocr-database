caption: An integrated model for the function of TopBP1 in the normal cell cycle and
  in cancer cells. (A) TopBP1 is induced by E2F during G1/S transition. It participates
  in DNA replication and ATR activation. It also restricts p53 activity and E2F1-dependent
  apoptosis to ensure smooth progression of S phase. (B) TopBP1 is upregulated through
  deregulation of the pRb pathway or other mechanisms. Overexpression of TopBP1 in
  some cancer cells then may inhibit both p53 and E2F1 activities in checkpoint or
  apoptosis. In this manner, upregulation of TopBP1 links pRb and p53 pathways in
  cancer.
