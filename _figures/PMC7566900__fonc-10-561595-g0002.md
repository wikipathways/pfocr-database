caption: 'BMAs-derived adipocytokines regulate behavior of metastatic breast cancer
  cells in the bone marrow. A few adipocytokines act on their corresponding receptors
  on breast cancer cell and affect downstream signaling pathways. Specifically, leptin
  binds its receptor on the breast cancer cell, Ob-R, and stimulates the JAK/SATA3
  and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, leptin has activation effects in ERα and
  HER2 independent of their ligands. Adiponectin is recognized by its receptor Adipo-R
  on the breast cancer cell, and two signaling pathway PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK are regulated
  by adiponectin. TNF-α induces signaling cascades in cancer cells mediated by its
  receptor TNFR, including MAPK/ERK and NF-κB activation. IL-1β upregulates NF-κB
  and CREB activation via its receptor IL-1R. IL-6 binds its receptor IL-6R, and resistin
  binds its receptor TLR4 or CAP1. Both of them stimulates the JAK/SATA3 signaling
  pathway. FABP4 enhances three different signaling pathway: JAK/SATA3, PI3K/Akt,
  and MAPK/ERK after its internalization by breast cancer cell. Visfatin binds an
  unknown receptor on the breast cancer cell, and stimulates the MAPK/ERK and Notch
  signaling pathway. Chemerin upregulates RhoA/ROCK activation via its receptor CMKLR1.
  Eventually, these adipocytokines stimulate different signaling pathways including
  JAK/SATA3, PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, NF-κB, CREB, Notch, RhoA/ROCK, ERα, and HER2 to promote
  target genes expression and regulate different tumor biological processes such as
  proliferation, EMT, stemness, and angiogenesis.'
