caption: Evolution of immune responses following supramolecular peptide-based vaccine
  delivery. After vaccine administration (1), tissue resident APCs such as DCs and
  MΦs internalize the constructs and process them through either the exogenous or
  endogenous pathway to present the antigenic epitopes on MHC II or MHC I molecules,
  respectively (2). The antigen-laden APCs then migrate to the dLNs for antigen presentation
  to CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. The interaction between MHC molecules and TCRs is supported
  by costimulatory signals, including ligand–receptor interactions and cytokine signaling,
  which enhance T cell responses and drive differentiation (3). TH cells then direct
  further immune activation through cytokine signaling and interaction with B cells
  and CD8+ T cells. Activated B cells interact with antigen-specific T cells and differentiate
  into plasma cells that produce long-lived antibody responses. Crosstalk between
  CD4+ and CD8+ T cells leads to the production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes that detect
  and eliminate infected cells (4). Created with https://www.BioRender.com.
