caption: 'Transgelin-2 (TG2) induces actin gelation by binding in a high ratio to
  actin (high concentrations of TG2 represented by green ‘gel’ on bundled actin filaments)
  (left). Misregulation of intracellular interactions of TG2 with actin can lead to
  malignant tumor invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. Additionally, TG2 may
  provide a signaling pathway that relaxes the myosin cytoskeleton of the airway smooth
  muscle cells (right). In this pathway, we propose that TG2 may act as a receptor
  for extracellular ligands or agonists, such as metallothionein-2 (MT-2) or TSG12.
  The activation of TG2 binds ezrin to stabilize the membrane receptor complex and
  induces RhoA phosphorylation, thereby inactivating the RhoA-ROCK-MYPT1 pathway.
  Myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), a heterotrimer consisting of MYPT1, PP1Cδ,
  and M20, can be activated by the dephosphorylation of MYPT1. The catalytic activity
  of PP1Cδ is enhanced to dephosphorylate myosin light chains (MLC), causing the relaxation
  of airway smooth muscle cells. Abbreviations: COPD, Chronic obstructive pulmonary
  disease; M20, the 20-kDa subunit of MLCP with unknown function; MYPT1, myosin phosphatase
  target subunit 1; PP1Cδ, phosphatase catalytic subunit of MLCP; ROCK, Rho-kinase.'
