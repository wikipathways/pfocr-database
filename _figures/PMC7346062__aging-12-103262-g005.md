caption: KEGG pathways related to resveratrol-targeted genes. (A) Resveratrol-targeted
  genes related to the Prostate cancer pathway. (1) The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway
  and (2) p53 signaling pathways are associated with impaired G1/G2 arrest, reduced
  apoptosis, and genomic instability. (B) Resveratrol-targeted genes related to pathways
  in cancer. (1) The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is associated with apoptosis evasion
  and proliferation. (C) Resveratrol-targeted genes related to the glioma pathway.
  (2) The p53 signaling pathway and (3) cell cycle pathway are associated with G1/S
  progression, uncontrolled proliferation, increased survival, and genomic instability.
  (D) Resveratrol-targeted genes related to the p53 signaling pathway. (3) The cell
  cycle pathway is associated with cell cycle arrest and p53 negative feedback. (E)
  Resveratrol-targeted genes related to the cell cycle signaling pathway, which is
  associated with biosynthesis of S-phase proteins and CycE DNA.
