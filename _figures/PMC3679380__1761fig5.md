caption: Extranuclear and nontranscriptional effects of RA and vitamin A. (A) A subpopulation
  of RARα is present in membrane lipid rafts and initiates cascades of kinase activations
  upon RA binding. In various epithelial and fibroblast cells, in response to RA,
  RARα localized in lipid rafts interacts with Gαq proteins and activates Rho-GTPases,
  p38MAPK, and MSK1. However, in neuronal cells, in response to RA, RARα activates
  Erks through the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Whether Erks activate downstream
  effectors is unknown, but RSK2 would be an interesting candidate. Strikingly, in
  neuronal cells, RA has been also shown to activate Erks via RARγ in association
  with the Src kinase. (B) Vitamin A bound to RBP binds to the extracellular moiety
  of Stra6 and triggers the phosphorylation of its cytosolic domain. Phosphorylated
  STRA6 recruits and activates JAK2, which in turns phosphorylates STAT5. Then STAT5
  translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression.
