caption: The ISGylation signaling pathway. ISG15 is sequentially transferred from
  UBE1L to UBE2L6, then to HERC5 before its attachment to a viral protein. HERC5 is
  responsible for catalyzing the specific covalent attachment of ISG15 onto viral
  target proteins through the formation of a stable isopeptide bond between the C-terminus
  of ISG15 and the ε-amino group on the lysine viral protein target. This figure was
