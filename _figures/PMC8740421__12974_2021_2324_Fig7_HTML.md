caption: Proposed model for Ago2 regulation of the endothelial and glial crosstalk.
  LPS activation of the p38 signaling pathway promotes VE-cadherin downregulation
  and the transcription of mRNA related to pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines).
  The translation of these transcripts is facilitated by low Ago2 levels and low RISC
  activity. These events trigger the activation of microglia and astrocytes associated
  with blood vessels, and cause neuronal damage. The exogenous application and internalization
  of Ago2, via NRP1, recuperates RISC activity, which is conducive to eNOS degradation
  and low NO, reducing glial activation and protecting neuronal cells. Ago2 argonaute-2,
