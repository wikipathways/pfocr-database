caption: Schematic representation of the glutamate–glutamine cycle between neurons
  and astroglia and the ammonia detoxification pathway (adapted from Sibson et al.,
  ). Released neurotransmitter glutamate (Glu) is transported from the synaptic cleft
  to surrounding astroglial end processes. Once in the astroglia, glutamate is converted
  to glutamine (Gln) by glutamine synthetase. Glutamine is released by the astroglia,
  transported into the neurons, and converted to glutamate by glutaminase, which completes
  the cycle. The net rate of glutamine synthesis reflects both glutamate–glutamine
  neurotransmitter cycling (Vcyc) and anaplerosis (Vana). NH3, ammonia; VNH3, ammonia
  fixation; Vgln, glutamine synthesis; Glc, glucose; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate.
