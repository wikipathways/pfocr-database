caption: CoQ10biosynthetic pathway with eight known biosynthetic enzymes denoted as
  COQ1-8. CoQ10 is composed of a benzoquinone and a decaprenyl side chain. While the
  quinone ring is derived from amino acids tyrosine or phenylalanine, the isoprenoid
  side chain is produced by addition of isopentenyl pyrophosphate molecules to geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate (derived from mevalonate pathway) by decaprenyl diphosphate synthase.
  After para-hydroxybenzoate and decaprenyl pyrophosphate are produced, at least seven
  enzymes (encoded by COQ2-8) catalyze condensation, methylation, decarboxylation,
  and hydroxylation reactions to synthesize CoQ10
