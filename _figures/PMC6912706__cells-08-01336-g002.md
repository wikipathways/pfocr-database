caption: 'SGA-induced impairment in hepatic insulin signaling and glucose metabolism.
  SGAs impact the insulin signaling pathway at two levels: inhibition of IRS-1/2 phosphorylation
  and inhibition of AKT and GSK3 phosphorylation, with H1R antagonism being the proposed
  SGA target in insulin signaling impairment. Antagonism of 5-HT1 and 5-HT2A and inhibition
  of glycogen phosphorylase (GP) would decrease glycogen synthesis, an effect also
  enhanced by inhibition of glycogen synthase (GS). Both inhibition of glycogen synthesis
  and stimulation of gluconeogenesis by SGAs increase the hepatic glucose output (HGO),
  leading to an increase in blood glucose levels. SGAs have been also shown to activate
  both hepatic catabolic (AMPK) and anabolic (mTORC1) pathways and also induce ROS
  production and mitochondrial dysfunction.'
