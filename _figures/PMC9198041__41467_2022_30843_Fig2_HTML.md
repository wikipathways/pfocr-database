caption: CRISPR SWAPnDROP uses a modular assembly system for the pSwap construction.
  It consists of seven modules (five for scarless integration) harbouring sgRNA expression
  cassettes for target sites (T1,T2), homologous regions (Hα, Hβ, H1, H2, HA, HB)
  and insert DNA (INS). a Each of those parts can be cloned into a different entry
  vector using the type-IIS restriction enzyme BsaI. b Each of those seven (five for
  scarless integration) modules are used to assemble the pSwap plasmid. The assembly
  takes place in a one-pot, one-step reaction using the type-IIS restriction enzyme
  BbsI. Therefore, it is possible to combine and recycle different modules for the
  desired approach. c The correct assembly of the pSwap plasmid is ensured by the
  expression of the biosynthetic pathway of deoxyviolacein. Each of the fragments
  (T1, T2, H1α, HA) harbour parts of the deoxyviolacein expression cassettes (vioBEAC).
  Only if assembled correctly, production of deoxyviolacein is possible. Colonies
  appear purple after transformation. d During linearization of the pSwap plasmid
  by sgRNA TS and Cas9, the vioC gene is removed resulting in the formation of prodeoxyviolacein
  after successful recombination. Colonies then appear green. In addition, the tool
  box comprises two pSwap plasmids (CmR/GmR) harbouring either the I-SceI or I-CreI
  meganuclease genes and the opposite recognition site. The removal of the meganuclease
  genes during recombination allows iterative use of the pSwap plasmids and therefore
  consecutive genomic edits. e Shown is the biosynthetic pathway of L-tryptophan to
  deoxyviolacein. If the gene (vioC) for the conversion of protodeoxyviolacein to
  deoxyviolacein, which is a purple pigment, is missing, a metabolic shift takes place
  towards prodeoxyviolacein, which presents a green colour. f The pDrop plasmid harbours
  a partly duplicated, non-functional mScarlet gene. During Drop recombination, the
  pDrop plasmid is cut by the sgRNA TM, which is expressed on the pSwap plasmid and
  subsequently recombined resulting in a functional mScarlet gene. Colonies appear
  red after successful recombination.
