caption: The TGF-β1–Smad pathway. (1) Initiation of the pathway begins after TGF-β1
  is up-regulated by angiotensin II. (2) Once in the extracellular space, TGF-β1 binds
  to a dimerized receptor, consisting of TGF-β1receptor 1 (TGF-β1R1) and TGF-β1 receptor
  2 (TGF-β1R2), found on the surface of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. (3) Ligand-receptor
  binding results in the phosphorylation of Smad2. Smad6, an inhibitory protein in
  the Smad family, impedes this phosphorylation. (4) Once phosphorylated, Smad2 combines
  with Smad 3 and Smad 4 to form a Smad complex that translocates across the nuclear
  membrane. Smad7, another inhibitory Smad protein, interrupts Smad complex formation.
  (5) Within the nucleus, the Smad complex binds to Smad-binding elements found in
  the regulatory regions of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins. This final
  step promotes the expression of collagen type I and type III in the heart and results
  in fibrosis.
