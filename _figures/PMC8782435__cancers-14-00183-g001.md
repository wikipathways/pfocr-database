caption: 'T cell metabolism in the tumor microenvironment. Naïve T cells rely mainly
  on oxidative metabolism. Following activation with an antigen, T cells switch to
  a glycolytic metabolism by activation of the mTOR pathway. This metabolic program
  supports effector T cell functions. If antigen stimulation persists long term, such
  as in the tumor environment, inhibitory receptors such as PD1 and CTLA4 can rewire
  T cell metabolism by reducing glycolysis and glutaminolysis, which weakens effector
  functions. Other factors in the TME contributing to the exhausted state of T cells
  include low levels of oxygen, low levels of tryptophan metabolized into kynurenine
  by IDO, low levels of arginine, high levels of lactate and resulting acidification
  and strong competition of T cells with cancer cells for glucose and glutamine. PD1:
