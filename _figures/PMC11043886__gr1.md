caption: An overview of the 2-stage microfermentation protocols. a) An overview of
  the 2-stage autoinduction microfermentation protocol. (i) Overnight (16 h) cultures
  in LB (Lennox formulation) are used to (ii) inoculate a new microtiter plate containing
  rich Autoinduction Broth at 1% v/v (AB or AB2). (iii) A time course of the autoinduction
  culture. Cells (biomass) grow and consume phosphate, which is depleted upon entry
  into stationary phase. Upon phosphate depletion, low phosphate inducible promoters
  are activated leading to expression of a target protein or metabolic pathway of
  interest, which in turn leads to accumulation of the target protein or metabolite.
  (v) After production cells or supernatants are harvested by centrifugation. b) An
  overview of the 2-stage wash microfermentation protocol. (i) Again overnight (16 h)
  cultures in LB (Lennox formulation) are used to (ii) inoculate a new microtiter
  plate, in this case containing SM10++ media. SM10++ is a minimal media supplemented
  with yeast extract and casamino acids in order to reduce the lag of cell growth
  in LB. (iii) A time course of the SM10 ++ culture. Cells (biomass) grow and consume
  phosphate, which is not depleted. (iv) Cells are grown to mid-exponential phase
  (OD600nm 5–10), which usually takes ∼ 16 h. (v) Cells are harvested by centrifugation
  washed with SM10 No phosphate media to remove phosphate and normalized to a target
  optical density (usually OD600nm ∼ 1), which begins the phosphate depleted production
  phase. (vi) A time course of the SM10 No phosphate culture. Cells usually undergo
  ∼1 doubling, coincident with induction of low phosphate inducible promoters leading
  to expression of a target protein or metabolic pathway of interest, which in turn
  leads to accumulation of the target protein or metabolite. (v) After production
  cells or supernatants are harvested by centrifugation
