caption: 'Cytokines IL-6 and LIF in complexes with the corresponding receptors as
  the initiation of JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Cytokines IL-6 and LIF, upon binding
  to the receptors, can activate JAK/STAT pathway, leading to altered expression of
  some genes. In IgA1-producing cells in patients with IgAN, this signaling process
  is enhanced, leading to dysregulation of specific glycosylation enzymes and overproduction
  of nephritogenic IgA1 glycoforms. IL-6 and LIF bind to receptor complexes composed
  of gp130/IL-6Rα and gp130/LIFR, respectively. The center of the figure illustrates
  the components of each receptor complex. The extracellular portions of gp130, IL-6Rα,
  and LIFR are composed of evolutionarily conserved fibronectin type III (FbnIII)
  β-sandwich domains, the number of which varies for each receptor. FbnIII domains
  that are involved in cytokine binding are denoted as CHR domains. In addition to
  FbnIII domains, each receptor has an Ig-like domain (IgD). IgD and additional FbnIII
  domains can contribute to cytokine binding and receptor complex assembly. The IL-6/gp130/IL-6Rα
  complex is composed of 2 copies of each protein to form a hetero-hexameric complex
  as shown to the left, with IL-6 (yellow), gp130 (magenta, D1-3), and IL-6Rα (light
  blue, D2-3). Individual observed domains are labeled, with D3 of gp130 and D3 of
  IL-6Rα illustrated proximal to the membrane and additional domains leading to the
  membrane schematically illustrated. To the right, the gp130/LIFR/LIF complex is
  shown as the ternary complex with each protein shaded magenta, cyan, and orange,
  respectively. The cytokines, IL-6 and LIF, are formed of α-helical bundles. The
  following protein coordinates were used to generate models in this figure: hexameric
  human IL-6/IL-6Rα receptor/gp130 complex [PDB ID: 1P9M, (Boulanger and others )],
  LIFR [PDB ID:2Q7N, (Huyton and others )], and LIF/gp130 [PDB ID:1PVH, (Boulanger
  and others )]. The composite gp130/LIFR/LIF structure was generated by alignment
  of LIF in the LIF/LIFR and LIF/gp130 according to methods in reference (Huyton and
  others ). CHR, cytokine-binding homology region; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor.'
