caption: 'Liver steatosis observed in offspring of obese father and obese mother is
  possibly the result of different activated pathways, resulting from a framework
  of hyperinsulinemia. It is suggested that the paternal obesity intensifies the lipogenesis
  pathway through increased gene and protein expression of SREBP-1c, which stimulates
  the synthesis of fatty acids by the FAS enzyme. Maternal obesity led to a less intense
  lipogenesis and decreased beta-oxidation showed by a lower gene and protein expression
  of PPAR alpha and CPT-1. Arrow-up (↑) indicates an increase and arrow-down (↓) indicates
  a decrease in both gene and protein expressions. Abbreviations: sterol regulating
  element binding protein (SREBP-1c); fatty acid synthase (FAS); peroxisome proliferator
  activator receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha); carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1);
  free fatty acid (FFA).'
