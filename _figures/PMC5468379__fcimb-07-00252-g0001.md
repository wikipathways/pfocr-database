caption: Viral RNA detection by RLRs and TLRs, signaling pathways and overview of
  FMDV strategies aimed at its supression. Interaction of viral RNA with nucleic acid
  sensing endosomal TLRs or cytosolic RLRs triggers a signaling cascade leading to
  the establishment of an antiviral state based on type-I IFN and proinflammatory
  cytokines induction. TLR7/8 and TLR3 signal through MyD88 (myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88) and TRIF (TIR-domain containing adaptor inducing IFN-β), respectively.
  When the inactive forms of RIG-I or MDA5 bind viral RNA, the helicases undergo ubiquitin-induced
  oligomerization and then interact with the adaptor molecule mitochondrial antiviral
  signaling protein (MAVS) through their caspase activation and recruiting domains
  (CARD). Activation of MyD88, TRIF, or MAVS triggers a signaling cascade including
  TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
  receptor-associated factor 3 and 6 (TRAF3/6). Then, two distinct pathways involving
  IKK-α/β/ɤ (IKK-ɤ also known as NEMO) and TBK1/IKK-ε are activated. TBK1 phosphorylates
  and activates the IFN-regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF-3/7) to induce the expression
  of type-I IFN genes, while the IKK-α/β/ɤ complex leads to activation of the nuclear
  transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) and transcription of proinflammatory cytokines.
  The IFN response is then amplified and spread to surrounding uninfected cells by
  engagement of the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR) through the tyrosine kinases termed Janus
  kinases (JAKs) and their downstream transcription factors (signal transducers and
  activators of transcription, STATs), the JAK/STAT signaling cascade, leading to
  the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) containing IFN-stimulated
  response elements (ISREs) in their promoters. Blockade by FMDV at the different
  steps of the pathway are indicated in red.
