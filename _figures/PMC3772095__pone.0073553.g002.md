caption: 'The gene boxes containing the zebrafish gene short names in italics and
  their relationships were obtained from the corresponding human KEGG-pathway. All
  those genes appearing in the Figure were assayed for transcript expression. Capital
  letters, inputs (black) and outputs (blue) of the pathway. Vertical parallel lines,
  cellular membranes. Continuous black arrows, activation between gene products. Discontinuous
  black arrows, inhibition between gene products. Gray form, main pathway. Folds were
  calculated as described in methods by the formula, fluorescence value 2- or 30-days
  after infection / fluorescence mean value in non-infected controls. Red italic letters,
  downregulated transcripts with folds <0.5. Orange italic letters, downregulated
  transcripts with folds <0.66. Bright green italic letters, upregulated transcripts
  with folds >2. Dark green italic letters, upregulated transcripts with folds >1.5.
  Black italic letters, not differentially expressed. Gene short names surrounded
  by an square, multipath genes. Gray form, downstream pathway beginning with cell
  membrane toll-like receptors (tlr1, tlr2, tlr4, tlr5b and tlr6). Ovoid brown forms,
  tlrs. Gene italic letters were colored as follows: red <0.5, orange <0.66, dark
  green >1.5 and bright green >2 folds. A, 2-days after SVCV infection. B, 30-days
  after SVCV infection (survivors).'
