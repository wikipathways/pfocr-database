caption: Regulation of cell survival and apoptosis by PKCα and PKCδ.A, PKCα predominantly
  promotes cell survival through activation of Bcl-2 family proteins. While PKCδ is
  primarily a proapoptotic kinase, it can drive cell survival by sequestering Smac,
  thus allowing IAPs to inhibit caspase activation. B, PKCδ drives cell death by downregulating
  antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins or by upregulating the proapoptotic BH3 family
  proteins, which allows the formation of Bax/Bak channels, release of cytochrome
  c, and activation of caspase. Upon DNA-damaging signals (yellowlightning bolt),
  PKCδ undergoes noncanonical activation involving sequential phosphorylation of Y155
  and Y64 by c-Abl and c-Src, respectively. These phosphorylation events result in
  a conformational change that releases the C-terminal tail from the C2 and kinase
  domains, revealing a cryptic NLS to allow importin binding and nuclear transport.
  In the nucleus, active caspase-3 cleaves PKCδ to generate active C-terminal catalytic
  domain (PKCδ CF). Potential mechanisms of PKCδ-dependent cell death include suppression
  of the DNA damage response, alterations in chromatin structure, and inhibition of
  DNA repair. The ERK–MSK1 pathway is important for regulation of the proapoptotic
  response of PKCδ. Prosurvival proteins are in green, and proapoptotic proteins are
  in orange. CF, catalytic fragment; ERK, extracellular signal–regulated kinase; IAP,
  inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein; MSK1, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase
  1; NLS, nuclear localization signal.
