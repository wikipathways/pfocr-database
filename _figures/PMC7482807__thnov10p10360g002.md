caption: LncRNAs-mediated endocrine therapy resistance. LncRNA TMPO-AS1 directly interacts
  and stabilizes the mRNA of the ERα encoding gene ESR1, leading to the hyper-proliferation
  of ER+ BC and endocrine resistance. In addition, linc-RoR promotes the degradation
  of the ERK-specific phosphatase DUSP7 thus enhancing ERK phosphorylation. The upregulation
  of MAPK/ERK pathway activates ER signaling independent of estrogen, resulting in
  intrinsic resistance to endocrine therapy. Furthermore, HOTAIR is transcriptionally
  suppressed by ER. Upon blocking ER signaling through endocrine therapy, HOTAIR is
  upregulated and promotes the expression of ER at the protein level, leaing to enhanced
  transcriptional activity of ER and accelerated endocrine resistance.
