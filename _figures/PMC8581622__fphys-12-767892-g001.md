caption: Mechanisms involved in intracellular Ca2+ dysregulation in AD. In this model,
  JVGCC and Jin are Ca2+ influxes from the extracellular space. The two separate mechanisms
  involved in the process of Ca2+ release from the ER via IP3Rs and RyRs are JCICR
  and JRyR, respectively. JSERCA represents the SERCA pump of the ER refilling the
  ER by pumping Ca2+ back from the cytosol. Jleak is the leakage Ca2+ flux from the
  ER into the cytosol. Jout is Ca2+ efflux by Ca2+-ATPase pump. Red lines represent
  the functional pathway of Aβ, and green lines represent the inhibitory effects of
  drugs.
