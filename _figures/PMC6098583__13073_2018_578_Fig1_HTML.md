caption: CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSBs cause apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in a p53-dependent
  manner. Schematic representation of the possible outcomes of CRISPR/Cas9-induced
  genome editing in p53 wild-type (upper panel) or p53-inactivated (bottom panel)
  edited cells (human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)/human retinal pigment epithelial
  cells (RPE1)). In p53 wild-type cells, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) trigger the
  activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway with consequent accumulation
  of p53 and the induction of its target gene p21. Most cells with DSBs undergo apoptosis
  or cell cycle arrest and only a small number of gene-corrected cells are obtained.
  p53 genetic inactivation reduces DSB-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and
  increases the number of gene-edited cells. No DSBs indicate unedited cells
