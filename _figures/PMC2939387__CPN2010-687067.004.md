caption: Diagrammatic representation of brain amyloid-β (Aβ) production/clearance,
  the harmful actions of S100B on Aβ production, and resultant effects on brain and
  plasma Aβ levels. In the amyloidogenic pathway, Aβ is primarily produced in neurons
  from sequential endoproteolytic cleavage of the type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein,
  β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), by β- and γ-secretases. Subsequently, soluble
  Aβ is secreted into the extracellular space, and then enters into a dynamic equilibrium
  between soluble and deposited (insoluble, β-amyloid plaque) forms. Continual transport
  of soluble Aβ occurs into and from the plasma. S100B enhancement of β-secretase
  activity promotes Aβ production, resulting in higher soluble and deposited Aβ in
  the brain. In addition, S100B promotes a damaging glial cytokine cycle through activation
  of astrocytes and microglia, resulting in enhancement of the amyloidogenic pathway.
