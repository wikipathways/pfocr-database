caption: Scheme for the chloroplast retrograde signaling pathway controlling nuclear
  gene expression in PSI-photoinhibited leaves. PSI-PI treatment induces the accumulation
  of electrons on the acceptor side of PSI, which increases ROS production, followed
  by damage to FeS centers in PSI (FeSA, FeSB, FeSX). Damage to FeS centers may lead
  to the release of iron. Iron is scavenged by ferritins (FERs), but when the iron
  content exceeds the binding capacity of FERs, the rise in iron concentration initiates
  a retrograde signaling cascade, activating iron homeostasis genes responding to
  excess iron and repressing iron-deficiency genes. The signal also activates the
  genes encoding PSI-acceptor-side pathways, cyclic electron flow (CEF), the Calvin–Benson–Bassham
  (CBB) cycle, and photorespiration (PR). Alternatively, FeS centers may be released
  from the damaged PSI and transported to the cytosol via NEET protein, transferring
  the signal from the chloroplast to the nucleus. The mediators of the signaling cascade
  are unknown. Furthermore, the expression of CEF, CBB cycle, and PR genes may also
  be regulated by a combination of red-light-induced transcription factors like HY5
  and HYH and Fe signaling.
