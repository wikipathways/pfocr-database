caption: The pathway for the synthesis of prostaglandins, their respective receptors
  and signaling. (Adapted with kind permission from Markovič, T.; et al. 2017; reference
  []). Arachidonic acid acts as the substrate for cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2
  to produce Prostaglandins PGE2, Thromboxane A2, PGI2, PGF2α, and PGD2, all of which
  exert functions by binding to their respective receptors. EP1-EP4 (dashed arrow)
  receptors are further detailed for their G protein coupling.
