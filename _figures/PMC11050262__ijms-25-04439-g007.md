caption: 'Gene expression changes in GO terms: (A) tight junction, (B) arrhythmogenic
  right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), (C) regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and
  (D) Huntington’s disease pathways in response to high–THC extract #18 compared to
  DMSO control in the HT–29 CRC cell line. The genes are coloured according to the
  difference in expression level between treatment and control for each sample. Red
  colour shows upregulation and green downregulation relative to the treatment group.
  Data based on GAGE unidirectional analysis'
