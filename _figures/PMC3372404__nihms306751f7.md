caption: A. Non–cytotoxic pathway. Aβ levels are insufficient to significantly activate
  apoptotic genes such as TP53 and the “cell death pair response” of upregulated ASCL1
  and downregulated OLIG2 through their AβID sequences. These levels maintain APP
  and BACE1 at non–pathogenic levels. B. Cytotoxic pathway. Aβ levels and resulting
  APP and BACE1 production are stimulated by conditions such as metal–induced oxidation
  (ROS), which ultimately results in increased production of Aβ peptides. The levels
  of Aβ are sufficient to significantly increase levels of p53 and induce the “cell
  death pair response” of upregulated ASCL1 and downregulated OLIG2. Additional Aβ
  is produced beyond what is required for physiological function, and the excess Aβ
  becomes deposited as amyloid plaque.
