caption: 'Nuclear receptors and photoreceptor differentiation in mice. Nuclear receptors
  (genes in blue type) act at several early and later stages of photoreceptor differentiation.
  In a current model of photoreceptor differentiation, multipotent, proliferative
  progenitors produce photoreceptor precursors under the control of Otx2 homeodomain
  factor and other poorly understood factors. These photoreceptor precursors are directed
  to a rod fate by leucine zipper factor NRL and nuclear receptors RORβ and NR2E3.
  If the NRL-NR2E3 pathway fails to reach a threshold of activity, the precursor becomes
  a cone by default. In cones, TRβ2 induces M opsin and suppresses S opsin, depending
  on thyroid hormone levels and location of the cone on the retina. In the absence
  of NRL or TRβ2, a photoreceptor precursor differentiates by default as an S cone.
  Many other factors cooperate to promote photoreceptor differentiation, including
  transcriptional cofactors, local extracellular signaling factors, and systemic hormonal
  and vitamin signals. Levels of RA and thyroid hormone can be regulated within the
  retina by ligand-metabolizing enzymes. Note: 1) Gene locations indicate stages where
  functions are reported, not necessarily where a gene is first expressed; 2) Expression
  patterns at early stages are not precisely defined for all genes; some genes may
  be expressed in dividing progenitor cells and/or early postmitotic cells; 3) Some
  genes may act at several stages in a cell lineage.'
