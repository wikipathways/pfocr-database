caption: '(a) The highest score network generated by IPA comprised 23 differentially
  expressed proteins (up-regulated proteins are displayed in red, whereas the down-regulated
  proteins are in green) plus additional interacting molecules that were not identified
  in this study (white). The network revealed 15 proteins in the context of cancer.
  Actin cytoskeleton signaling, integrin signaling and FAK signaling represent canonical
  pathways with 13, 10 and 6 identified proteins of the network, respectively. The
  proteins were grouped according to the canonical pathway or function. Fx: function
  and Cp: canonical pathway. (b) Representation of the top canonical pathway of actin
  cytoskeleton signaling.'
