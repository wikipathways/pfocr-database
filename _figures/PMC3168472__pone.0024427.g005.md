caption: 'The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling pathway, calcium signaling
  pathway, and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation were identified as putative
  affected pathways containing early induced genes after the eyestalk ablation. The
  lighter red boxes represent the genes whose expression levels were induced more
  than 2 fold, whereas the dark red boxes represent the genes whose expression levels
  were induced less than 2 fold at Day 1 after the ablation. Abbreviation: GnRHR:
  gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor; G q/11: guanine nucleotide-binding protein
  G(q) subunit alpha; PLC beta: phospholipase C beta; InsP3: inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate;
  IP3R: inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor; CALR: calreticulin; ER: endoplasmic
  reticulum; Ca2+: Calcium ion; CaM: calmodulin; CaMK: calmodulin kinase; CaN: calcineurinB;
  PMCA: Ca2+ transporting ATPase; GPCR?: G protein-coupled receptor; G: guanine nucleotide-binding
