caption: Autophagy and some of its regulatory pathways Binding of insulin or growth
  factors to the insulin receptor triggers the PI3K pathway, converting PIP2 into
  PIP3 that recruits PDK1 and Akt to the plasma membrane. Activation of Akt by insulin
  binding or direct mTORC2 stimulation inactivates TSC1/2 (tuberous sclerosis 1/2)
  [], resulting in the activation of Rheb and mTORC1. Under starvation or rapamycin
  application, Ulk1 is phosphorylated by AMP-activated protein kinase and detaches
  from mTORC1 complex, rendering it inactive and triggers the autophagy pathway. The
  mTORC1 complex and AMP-activated protein kinase sense the nutrient state of the
  cell and accordingly maintains homeostasis by controlling levels of amino acids
  through various pathways, including autophagy. LC3 mediates selective autophagy
  by recruiting several adapter proteins, including p62, to the autophagosome. The
  activity of PI3K complex can be manipulated by several pharmacological modulators
  such as activators like BH3 mimetics and inhibitors such as spautin-1. Other modulators
  of autophagy are also shown in the figure.
