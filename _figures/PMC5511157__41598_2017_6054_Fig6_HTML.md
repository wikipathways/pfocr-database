caption: Mediation by Menin of milk protein synthesis through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway in mammary epithelial cells. Hormones such as insulin and prolactin that
  acts on epithelial cells modulate the MEN1/Menin expression level in cells, which
  further affects the abundance of the factors involved in mTOR signaling and eventually
  the synthesis of milk protein. Please see the text for further details. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase;
  Akt, also known as protein kinase (B) mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; IR, insulin
  receptor; IRS, IR substrate; PRLR, prolactin receptor; AT, amino acid transporter.
  The solid line represents fluxes; the dotted line represents possible effects or
  fluxes.
