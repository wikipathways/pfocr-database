caption: 'Current understanding of how PKA activity is regulated in the vicinity of
  the cilium. Each pathway is colored coded. Green path: Smo may activate Gαi via
  hitherto unknown mechanisms, which inhibits adenylyl (AC) and reduces cAMP levels
  to inhibit PKA activity. Red path: GPR161 is present at the cilium before Hh activation,
  where it activates Gαs to increase PKA activity. Blue path: High Ca2+ levels in
  the cilium inhibits PIP3-mediated AC activation, and contributes to the reduction
  of cAMP/PKA activity. This path is observed only after prolonged (>24 h) Hh agonist
  stimulation. Yellow path: Neuropilin recruits PDE4D to the cytoplasmic membrane
  to effectively degrade cAMP, and subsequently reduces PKA activity at the centrosome.
  Pink path: Ankmy2 is responsible for the maturation and trafficking of multiple
  ACs to the primary cilium; loss of Ankmy2 leads to marked elevation of Hh signaling
  in vitro and in vivo. Purple path: The Rho GTPase-activating protein ArhGAP36 blocks
  PKA activity by acting as a PKA pseudo-substrate or inducing PKA degradation. Dashed
  lines indicate that activation of this pathway will suppress cAMP production and
  PKA activity.'
