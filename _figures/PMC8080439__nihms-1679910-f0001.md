caption: 'Complement regulation and dysregulation. Complement is activated by three
  pathways: (1) the lectin pathway, (2) the classical pathway, and (3) the alternative
  pathway. Importantly, the alternative pathway of complement (APC) also serves as
  an amplification loop for the lectin and classical pathways, accounting for the
  majority of complement activation products. The magnitude of APC activation depends
  on the amplification (green) and the degradation pathways (red). C3 tickover allows
  C3b to covalently bind to nearby cell surfaces. Once factor B binds to C3b, it is
  cleaved by factor D to generate the APC C3 convertase (C3bBb). C3bBb cleaves C3
  to generate even more C3b setting off the amplification loop. Factor H (H) inhibits
  C3 amplification; it competes with B for binding to C3b, is a cofactor for factor
  I-catalyzed cleavage of C3b to iC3b (an opsonin), and accelerates decay of the C3
  convertase (C3bBb). In the normal state, these pathways are in homeostasis. Dysregulation,
  for example from a loss of function mutation in CFH that reduces degradation (red
  loop), leads to an increase in the amplification loop because degradation of the
  C3 convertase (C3b.Bb) is blocked, resulting in increased production of complement
  effectors C3a, C5a and C5b-9 (the membrane attack complex). Additionally, complement
  amplifying triggers such as infection, surgery, or pregnancy can enhance the activation
  loop (green) and increase complement activation over the threshold required for
  clinical disease. (Figure was created using biorender.com.)'
