caption: PG-recycling pathway of the wild type (A) and trapping of anhMurNAc-tripeptide
  in an ampD mutant (B). In the wild type, [3H]DAP from the medium is incorporated
  into PG via addition to UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu as shown. After degradation of PG,
  the breakdown products containing GlcNAc-anhMurNAc, e.g., GlcNAc-anhMurNAc-tetrapeptide,
  are imported by AmpG into the cytoplasm, where they are further degraded by NagZ,
  AmpD, and LdcA to release the two amino sugars, d-Ala and murein tripeptide. The
  tripeptide directly reenters the PG synthesis pathway (Fig. ) and GlcNAc, anhMurNAc,
  and d-Ala are also available for reuse. In an ampD mutant, PG breakdown products
  are trapped in the cytoplasm principally as anhMurNAc-tripeptide (Fig. ), leaving
  only GlcNAc and d-Ala available for reuse. OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane;
  black squares, radioactive DAP; gray squares, nonradioactive DAP; gray circles,
  GlcNAc; white squares, MurNAc; white squares with triangles, anhMurNAc; white circles,
  d/l-Ala; diamonds, d-Glu.
