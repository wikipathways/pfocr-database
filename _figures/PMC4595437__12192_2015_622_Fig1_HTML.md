caption: Implication of Hsp70 as a mediator of the anti-apoptotic effects of nitric
  oxide. a Cellular stress is associated with protein misfolding and increases in
  intracellular NO. In response to such stresses, HSF trimerises in an NO-dependent
  manner and translocates to the nucleus to transcriptionally activate the expression
  of Hsp70 via interaction with HSEs on the promoter region. The net effect of this
  is an increase in the cellular chaperone capacity which favors cell survival. Additionally
  Hsp70 via its links with WT-1 stabilizes Bcl-2 limiting the potential for Cyt C
  release from the mitochondrion and the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
  Positive feedback on this system is achieved via the activity of iNOS. b Reduced
  cellular NO production decreases WT-1, and Bcl-2 levels. This is associated with
  Cyt C release and the activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Hsp70 expression
  is also reduced and sequestration with Hsf1 prevents the inhibition of APAF-1 which
  promotes the progression of the apoptotic pathway. HSF heat shock factor, NO nitric
  oxide, WT-1 Wilms tumor 1, Bcl-2 B cell lymphoma 2, APAF-1 apoptotic protease activating
