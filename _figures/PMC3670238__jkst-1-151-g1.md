caption: Figure 1. Cytokine signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway. Signaling components
  for STAT3, STAT5 and STAT6 that are utilized in mammary gland in response to IL-4/IL-13,
  prolactin and LIF. A subset of target genes for each of these STATs, at specific
  times in the developmental cycle, are indicated in the boxes. Socs proteins, which
  are direct transcriptional targets of STATs, are negative regulators of STATs, providing
  an exquisite level of regulation of STAT signaling. For a discussion of Socs proteins
  in mammary gland development, see Watson and Neoh. The phenotype of mice with deletions
  of selected STAT target genes is beyond the scope of this review, but is discussed
  elsewhere in the case of GATA3, and whey acidic protein. For a discussion of the
  involution phenotype of selected transgenic mice, see Radisky and Hartmann.
