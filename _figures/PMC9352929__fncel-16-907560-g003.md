caption: Essential components of the protein quality control pathway of NMDARs. (A)
  Nascent polypeptide chains of a GluN subunit enter the ER where chaperone proteins
  and folding enzymes assist its folding and assembly. Furthermore, it is trafficked
  to the Golgi apparatus, where it undergoes post-translational modifications, and
  eventually inserts into the plasma membrane to perform its function. If incorrectly
  folded within the ER, the protein is targeted to a degradation pathway, either through
  ER-phagy or ER-associated degradation (ERAD). (B) NMDARs are organized at synapses
  within the postsynaptic density (PSD). Protein kinase C (PKC) facilitates vesicle
  fusion with the membrane and the receptors laterally diffuse to the synaptic space.
  NMDARs are tethered to the PSD through interactions of their CTD with SAP102 and
  PSD95. These are further linked to Shank and Homer within the PSD. CaMKII binds
  and modulates NMDARs activity and calcium signaling at the synapse. Created with
