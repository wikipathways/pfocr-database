caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of Molecular Activation Based on Gene Expression
  Profiles(A) Gene expression data were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Molecules
  that were activated by DSS treatment are displayed according to Z scores (extent
  of activation based on gene expression profile), which were determined by comparison
  of a non-DSS-treated mouse with a DSS+NC mouse on day 4 (left column). Note that
  sCA-miR-29a (center column) or sCA-miR-29b (right column) reversed the activation
  of the molecules to various extents. Many interferon (IFN) pathway-associated molecules
  were identified (green). (B) An intracellular signaling pathway map shows the production
  of inflammatory cytokines and IFN because of interactions of ligands with Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs). Genes activated by DSS treatment are shown in red. (C) Genes activated
  by DSS treatment are superimposed on known IFN signaling pathways. Orange indicates
  genes that are predicted to be activated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Purple indicates
  upregulated genes according to mRNA array analysis.
