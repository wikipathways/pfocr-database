  enhancer (PEN-2), anterior pharynx-defective 1 (APH1) and nicastrin. Presenilins
  (PS1/PS2) are the catalytic components. (b) The five step canonical Notch pathway:
  (1) ADAM 10/17-mediated cleavage frees the Notch extracellular domain (NECD); (2)
  the receptor-NECD complex is endocytosed by epsin-mediated endocytosis; this initiates
  the Notch cascade; (3) γ-secretase mediated cleavage releases the transcriptionally
  active nuclear bound Notch intracellular domain (NICD); (4) NICD enters into the
  nucleus; and finally (5), NICD forms a complex with the DNA binding protein RBPj
  and a member of the mastermind-like (MAML) family of transcriptional co-activators
  to facilitate the transcription of Notch target genes. (c) Numerous genes are regulated
  by the Notch pathway that could play a role in epithelial–mesenchymal transitions
  (EMTs). CSL, CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, Lag-1 transcription factor.'
