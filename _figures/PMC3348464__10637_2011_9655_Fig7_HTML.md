caption: Proposed model for the cytotoxic effect of antiprogestins in ovarian cancer
  cells. a In normal growing conditions or in the presence of very low doses of antiprogestins,
  the activity of Cdk-2 is elevated and the cell cycle progresses. At certain threshold
  of antiprogestin levels, the activity of Cdk-2 is reduced in association with cytostasis.
  At higher doses of antiprogestins, Cdk-2 activity is blunted leading to cell death.
  b Antiprogestins reduce nuclear and cytoplasmic activity of Cdk-2 in association
  with up-regulation of Cdk-2 inhibitors p21cip1 (p21) and p27kip1 (p27), down-regulation
  of Cdk-2 and cyclin E in the nucleus, and cyclin E redistribution to the cytoplasm
  where it may undergo accelerated proteasome degradation. The inhibition of nuclear
  activity of Cdk-2 leads to G1 cell cycle arrest due to abrogation of Cdk-2 driven
  pathways needed for DNA duplication and S phase progression. The inhibition of cytoplasmic
  Cdk-2 activity, when bypassing certain minimal activity threshold, ultimately leads
  to cell death likely due to abrogation of a Cdk-2 dependent cell survival pathway

  in ovarian cancer cells involves inhibition of cyclin dependent kinase 2.
