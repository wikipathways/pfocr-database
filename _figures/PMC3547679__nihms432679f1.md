caption: Molecular signaling alterations induced by intracellular delivery of CagA.
  Translocation of CagA by the H. pylori cag type IV secretion system leads to activation
  of host signaling pathways that promote epithelial responses with carcinogenic potential.
  CagA is phosphorylated by Src and Abl kinases, which is followed by a decrease in
  levels of phosphorylated-CagA via the inhibitory kinase c-src kinase (Csk). Phosphorylated
  CagA activates SHP2 and Erk leading to morphological changes, such as cellular elongation.
  Additionally, the interaction between phosphorylated-CagA and SHP2 results in inactivation
  of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which can activate Src. Unphosphorylated CagA also
  leads to changes in epithelial cell motility and proliferation through binding Grb/Sos/Ras
  and activation of the Raf/MEK/Erk pathway. Unmodified CagA can also associate with
  the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and JAM-A as well as the adherens junction protein
  E-cadherin, leading to dysregulated junctional complexes.
