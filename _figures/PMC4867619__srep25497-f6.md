caption: Circulating lymphocytes expressed high levels of inflammatory markers (TNF-α,
  NF-κB, IL-1β and SP1). High amounts of innate immune mediators secreted to the bloodstream
  would be reaching the mucosae of the small and large intestine of VLBW infants with
  sepsis. This would activate master regulators TNF-α and IL-1β, inducing the expression
  of pro-inflammatory signaling and innate immune defense systems, such as oxidative
  stress pathway in the gut mucosal cells. The secretion of ROS and NOS would then
  correlate with bacterial profiles richer in Enterobacteriaceae and with the lower
  presence of Bifidobacteriaceae and Bacteroides, due to the lack in the latter of
  the enzymatic armor to survive in the presence of ROS, RNS and derived toxic compounds.
