caption: Schematic representation of the role of the primary cilium in Glis signaling.
  The localization of Glis proteins to the primary cilium suggests that these proteins
  are part of a primary cilium-associated signaling pathway. A hypothetical upstream
  signal (e.g., peptide, mechano-, osmo, or chemosensor)(triangle) through plasma
  membrane-associated receptors (e.g., G-protein coupled receptors) may regulate the
  primary cilium localization and activity of Glis. Intraflagellar transport (IFT)
  proteins may direct anterograde and retrograde movement of Glis proteins within
  the primary cilium. Upon activation, Glis proteins may undergo post-translational
  modifications or proteolytic processing resulting in modified Glis proteins that
  function as transcriptional activators (GlisA) or repressors (GlisR). After their
  translocation to the nucleus, Glis proteins regulate the transcription of target
  genes through interactions with co-activators (CoA) or co-repressors (CoR). Glis-BS,
  Glis-binding site.
