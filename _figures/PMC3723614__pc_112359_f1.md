caption: 'Schematic Representation of Ser Biosynthesis in Plants and Connections with
  the  Cycle.The enzymes participating in each Ser biosynthetic pathway are as follows.
  Photorespiratory pathway (glycolate pathway): GDC, Gly decarboxylase; SHMT, Ser
  hydroxymethyltransferase. Glycerate pathway: PGAP, 3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase;
  GDH, glycerate dehydrogenase; AH-AT, Ala-hydroxypyruvate aminotransferase. Phosphorylated
  pathway: PGDH, 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PSAT, 3-phosphoserine aminotransferase.
  Abbreviations used for metabolites are as follows: THF, tetrahydrofolate; 5,10-CH2-THF,
  5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate; 3-PHP, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate; 3-PS, 3-phosphoserine.'
