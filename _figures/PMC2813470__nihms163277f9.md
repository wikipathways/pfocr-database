caption: The spinosyn biosynthetic pathway highlighting the biosynthesis of TDP-d-forosamine
  (16). Note that compounds 22, 23, and 28 are not intermediates in the native biosynthetic
  pathway. Gtt is the TTP-dependent glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase converting
  8 to 9, Gdh is the TDPd-glucose 4,6-dehydrase converting 9 to 10, SpnO is the TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose
  2,3-dehydratase converting 10 to 11, SpnN is the NAD(P)H-dependent TDP-3,4-diketo-2,6-dideoxy-d-glucose
  3-ketoreductase converting 11 to 12, SpnQ is the PMP-dependent TDP-4-keto-2,6-dideoxy-d-glucose
  3-dehydrase converting 12 to 13, SpnR is the PLP, l-glutamate-dependent TDP-4-keto-2,3,6-trideoxy-d-glucose
  4-aminotransferase converting 13 to 14, and SpnS is the SAM-dependent TDP-4-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-d-glucose
  N,N-dimethyltransferase sequentially converting 14 to 15 and 15 to 16.
