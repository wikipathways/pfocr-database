caption: Regulation of Mcl-1 and Snail by AKT, ERK, and IKK signaling pathway. (A)
  AKT and ERK phosphorylates GSK3β and inhibit it. GSK3β phosphorylates Mcl-1 and
  induces its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via β-TrCP, Mule, and/or FBW7.
  ERK also directly phosphorylates Mcl-1, and phosphorylated Mcl-1 interacts with
  Pin1, resulting in its stabilization. The IKK–NF-κB pathway also contributes to
  Mcl-1 upregulation but the mechanisms are uncertain. (B) AKT and ERK phosphorylates
  GSK3β and inhibit it. GSK3β phosphorylates Snail and induces its nuclear exclusion,
  ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via β-TrCP. ERK also upregulates Snail
  transcription via AP-1 transcription factor. The IKK–NF-κB pathway inhibits Snail
  via upregulation of CSN2, which interferes with the GSK3–Snail interaction and ubiquitination
  of Snail.
