caption: Schematic representation of HCV assembly. Virion assembly is triggered by
  core recruitment on cytosolic lipid droplets (cLDs) by the diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1
  (DGAT-1). In turn, replication complexes are recruited through core-NS5A interactions.
  Nucleocapsid formation is mediated by viral budding into the ER lumen, at the site
  of VLDL production. The immature viral particles fuse or attach to a luminal LD
  (LuLD) through apoE-E1E2 and apoE-NS5A interactions. During VLDL synthesis, apolipoprotein
  B (apoB) is directly produced in the ER lumen and enriched in lipids by the microsomal
  triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) to generate VLDL precursors. Viral particles
  merge with these nascent VLDLs to generate mature lipoviroparticles (LVPs). LVPs
  enter the VLDL maturation and secretion pathway to be released from hepatocytes.
  HCV assembly and egress can be impaired by targeting different steps of these processes
  as highlighted in red.
