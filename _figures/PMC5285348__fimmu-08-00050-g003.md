caption: The canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In the absence of Wnt ligands, β-catenin
  interacts with a degradation complex, which is formed by Axin, APC, GSK3, and CK1.
  In this complex, β-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3 and by CK1 leading to ubiquitylation
  and subsequently degradation of β-catenin in the proteasome. When β-catenin is degraded,
  Groucho, which is a co-repressor protein, interacts with LEF1 and TCF. The Groucho/LEF1/TCF
  complex represses the transcription of target genes (left). Wnt ligands interact
  with the Frizzled receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, and with the co-receptor
  LRP. GSK3 and CK1 induce the phosphorylation of LRP leading to the recruitment of
  axin and disheveled to the LRP/G protein-coupled receptor complex releasing β-catenin.
  Then, β-catenin is accumulated in the nucleus where it binds to LEF1 and TCF to
  induce the transcription of specific genes (right).
