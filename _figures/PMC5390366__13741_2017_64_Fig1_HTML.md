caption: The core components of providing optimal analgesia. Pain after surgery can
  have profound effects on patient recovery. However, the complete elimination of
  pain may also have untoward effects, as listed in the figure. Optimal analgesia
  after surgery is an approach to pain control that facilitates a positive patient
  experience through optimized patient comfort that facilitates functional recovery
  while minimizing adverse drug events
