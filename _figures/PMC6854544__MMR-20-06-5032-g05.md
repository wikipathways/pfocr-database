caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed mechanisms underlying the effects
  of curcumin on PQ-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory response. PQ induces
  excessive production of ROS, which in turn promotes the expression of TXNIP. TXINIP
  not only interacts with Trx and blocks its antioxidative ability, but also activates
  the NLRP3-mediated inflammatory pathway. Curcumin is proposed to inhibit the promoting
  effects of ROS. IL, interleukin; NLRP3, NLR pyrin domain containing 3; PQ, paraquat;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; Trx, thioredoxin; TXNIP, Trx interacting protein.
papertitle: Curcumin relieves paraquat-induced lung injury through inhibiting the
  thioredoxin interacting protein/NLR pyrin domain containing 3-mediated inflammatory
  pathway.
