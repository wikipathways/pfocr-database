caption: (A) Upon virus infection, IE2 is expressed and stimulates heat shock protein
  expression. The elevated levels of heat shock proteins further sustain IE2 transcription
  center formation, most likely by protecting it from degradation. The IE2 transcription
  centers activate or recruit several additional viral factors including IE1, Lef3
  and DBP [], allowing the virus to maximize its amplification in the infected cells.
  (B) In the presence of KNK437-the heat shock response inhibitor-IE2 is rapidly degraded
  through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and fails to form mature transcription
  centers. The lack of IE2 nuclear body formation eventually contributes to lower
  levels of virus titer.
