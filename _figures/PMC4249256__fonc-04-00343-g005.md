caption: Illustration of the proposed crosstalk between insulin/IGF1 and IL-17 signaling
  pathways. IL-17 acts through the IL-17RA:IL-17RC receptor complex to activate Act1–TRAF6–TAK1–IKK
  signaling cascade, thus activating NF-κB transcription factor and subsequently activating
  C/EBPβ transcription factors. NF-κB and C/EBPβ transcription factors are required
  for initiation of transcription of the downstream target genes such as IL-6, Cxcl1,
  and Ccl20. Insulin and IGF1 bind to their receptors and activate PI3K/Akt pathway;
  Akt phosphorylates GSK3B at serine 9 and GSK3A at serine 21 to inhibit GSK3 activity;
  GSK3 phosphorylates C/EBPβ at threonine 179 after a priming phosphorylation at threonine
  188 by ERK1/2, thus inhibiting C/EBPβ’s transcription function. Therefore, insulin/IGF1
  signaling is linked with IL-17 signaling by GSK3 and C/EBPβ. AZD5363 inhibits Akt
  activation, thus enhancing GSK3 activity and subsequently diminishing IL-17-induced
  gene expression by inhibiting C/EBPβ function.
