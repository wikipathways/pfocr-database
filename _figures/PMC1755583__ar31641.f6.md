caption: Hormone, cytokine, and growth factor mediated signalling to regulate HIF-1α
  protein expression and transcriptional transactivation activity. Hormones like insulin,
  cytokines like tumour necrosis factor (TNFα) and interleukin 1ß (IL1ß), as well
  as growth factors like transforming growth factor ß (TGFß) and fibroblast growth
  factor 2 (FGF2) can induce HIF-1 target genes even under normoxic conditions. Binding
  of these factors to their receptors activates intracellular signalling cascades
  by kinase mediated phosphorylation. One activated cascade is the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT (protein kinase B)/FK506 binding protein12-rapamycin associated
  protein leading to an increased HIF-1α mRNA translation, sufficient for its stabilisation.
  A negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT/FRAP cascade is the tumour suppressor protein
  PTEN, a phosphatase, which abolishes AKT activation. A second pathway involved in
  HIF-1 signalling is the RAF/MEK/MAPK pathway, leading to an enhancement of transcriptional
  activity of HIF-1α. Both pathways can be stimulated by the small GTP binding protein
  RAS.
