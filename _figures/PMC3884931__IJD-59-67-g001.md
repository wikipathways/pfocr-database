caption: Schematic representation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling
  pathway regulation. When various ligands such as nerve growth factor (NGF)/epidermal
  growth factor (EGF)/interleukin (IL)-17/IL-22 bind to their receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs) result in phosphorylation of tyrosine sites. The phosphorylated tyrosine
  residues serve as docking sites for downstream pathways including phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT. AKT phosphorylates various downstream substrates like mTORC1
  which involved in the regulation of a range of cellular functions such as proliferation,
  survival, activation, differentiation, and migration
