caption: 'Signaling pathways regulating Müller glia cell dedifferentiation and proliferation
  following retinal injury in zebrafish. A: Dying photoreceptors (light grey) secrete
  TNFα, which triggers Müller cell response to injury. Activated Müller glia cells
  (in blue) are a source of growth factors and cytokines, which impinge on Stat3 and
  Ascl1 genes through the MAPK–Erk, PI3K/Akt, and Jak–Stat signaling cascades. Ascl1
  and Stat3 promote Müller glia dedifferentiation and proliferation (in red). Wnt/ß‐catenin
  signaling pathway is also activated in Müller glia cells following retinal damage
  and promotes Ascl1 expression. On the other hand, Notch inhibits Ascl1/Stat3 expression
  and thereby preserves a pool of quiescent Müller glia in the injured retina. Smad2/3‐mediated
  TGFβ signaling also inhibits the proliferative response of Müller glia following
  photoreceptor destruction. Although an initial increase in TGFβ signaling occurs
  in Müller cells following injury, its subsequent inhibition by the corepressors
  Tgif1 and Six3b promotes Müller glia proliferation. B: Illustration of regulatory
  cascades involving Ascl1 gene in zebrafish Müller cells following injury. i: Wnt
  signaling and ASCL1 are part of a feedback loop: Wnt signaling promotes Ascl1 expression
  in activated Müller cells. ASCL1 is upstream the transcriptional repressor Insm1,
  which inhibits the expression of the Wnt signaling inhibitor Dkk and stimulates
  the expression of Wnt4a ligand. On the other hand, Insm1 also restricts the response
  of Müller cells by negatively regulating hb‐egf expression. ii: ASCL1 acts upstream
  of Lin‐28, which represses the micro‐RNA let‐7, a repressor of regeneration‐associated
  genes. iii: Notch signaling and ASCL1 are part of a negative feedback loop. Notch
  signaling is activated by the HB‐EGF/MAPK/ASCL1‐signalling cascade but inhibits
  Stat3, Ascl1 and hb‐egf expression.'
