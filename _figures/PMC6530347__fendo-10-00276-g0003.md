caption: Perturbation of thyroid hormone (TH)-dependent amphibian metamorphosis by
  xenobiotic and abiotic exposures. Chemical and/or environmental factors can disrupt
  TH action at multiple points along this pathway (red arrows), although little is
  known about the specific mechanism of action for many factors. Due to its absolute
  reliance on proper TH signaling, metamorphic endpoints can be used to reveal the
  TH-disrupting capabilities of these factors. However, a more complete understanding
  of endocrine disruption and insight into modes of action can be achieved through
  the use of advanced techniques to assess alterations in the transcriptome, proteome,
  metabolome, and epigenome within metamorphosing tadpoles. CRF, corticotropin releasing
  factor; TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone; TR, TH receptor; PTU, propylthiouracil;
  ETU, Ethylenethiourea; TBBPA, Tetrabromobisphenol A; PBDE, polybrominated diphenyl
  ethers; PCB, polychlorinated bisphenols; BPA, bisphenol A; NA & PAHs, napthenic
  acid and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; WWE, wastewater effluent; UVBR, ultraviolet
  B radiation.
