caption: 'Deciphering of the molecular mechanisms of the novel copper(II) indenoisoquinoline
  complex WN197. WN197 inhibits topoisomerases I at low doses in a poison mode and
  forms a ternary complex with the topoisomerase and DNA, leading to strand breaks
  accumulation. Phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) localizes at the sites of DNA damage.
  The DNA damage response pathway is activated: ATM and ATR kinases are phosphorylated,
  and subsequently activate Chk1 and Chk2, leading to Cdc25C phosphorylation on serine
  216 (S216), and to its binding to 14-3-3. Consequently, Cdk1 remains phosphorylated
  on tyrosine 15 (Y15), impeding the activation of the MPF (Cdk1/Cyclin B) and the
  phosphorylation of H3 on serine 10 (S10). Cancer cells arrest in the G2 phase of
  the cell cycle. The DDR also leads to an increase in p53 and p21 followed by an
  autophagic cell death characterized by the phosphorylation of RAPTOR on serine 792
  (S792) in the mTORC1 complex, the synthesis of Beclin-1, the formation of LC3-II
  (complex LC3-I/PE (phosphatidylethanolamine)), and the degradation of p62.'
