caption: 'Molecular Mechanisms of mTOR in BCSCs: This figure illustrates the complex
  interactions of the mTOR pathway within breast cancer stem cells, focusing on various
  upstream regulators, co-activators, and signaling pathways that sustain BCSC properties,
  including self-renewal, tumorigenicity, resistance to therapy, and metabolic adaptation.
  PI3K/AKT Pathway: PI3K/AKT activation, driven by growth factors (e.g., IGF-1R, HER2)
  and other proteins (e.g., EMP3, TIPE2, GSK3), stimulates mTOR signaling, which promotes
  BCSC survival, growth, and resistance to therapeutic interventions. Notably, nuclear
  localization of Akt enhances mTOR signaling, further sustaining stem-like characteristics
  in BCSCs. SOX2 and Notch Pathways: Overexpression of SOX2, coupled with Notch signaling
  activation, supports self-renewal and maintenance of BCSC populations. Notch signaling
  also modulates mTOR, amplifying cell survival and metabolic pathways in BCSCs.IGF-1R
  and TGF-β Pathways: IGF-1R signaling upregulates mTOR activity, promoting BCSC proliferation
  and resistance, while TGF-β influences epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
  stem-like properties via SMAD pathways. This interaction contributes to resistance
  to anti-cancer therapies. AMPK and Energy Sensing: AMPK responds to changes in cellular
  energy (e.g., ATP/AMP levels), potentially antagonizing mTOR to inhibit cell cycle
  progression and induce apoptosis. This axis highlights the therapeutic potential
  of AMPK activators in targeting energy-dependent survival mechanisms in BCSCs. Non-coding
  RNAs and Additional Regulators: MicroRNAs (miR-99a, miR-125b) and regulatory proteins
  (e.g., PD-L1, HIF-1α, HIF-2α, ST8SIA1) influence mTOR activity in BCSCs. These regulators
  further impact metabolic and survival pathways, underscoring the therapeutic implications
  of targeting mTOR-related transcriptional and post-transcriptional networks. The
  interconnections between mTOR and these pathways highlight its central role in modulating
  cellular processes critical for BCSC survival and therapeutic resistance. This network
  provides insight into potential targets, such as mTOR inhibitors, AMPK activators,
  and modulators of signaling pathways like IGF-1R and Notch, which could be leveraged
  in breast cancer treatments to effectively target BCSCs and enhance therapeutic
  outcomes'
