caption: Bidirectional interaction between NPs and RAAS with potential implications
  in COVID-19. The RAAS may exert both protective and detrimental effects. Angiotensin
  II, through its receptor AT1, activates signaling pathways involved in fibrosis,
  cellular proliferation, hypertrophy and vasoconstriction. Indeed, AT1 stimulates
  the RAC1/p38/MAPK pathway which is involved in the activation of Akt, mTOR and its
  downstream target p70S6K. Moreover, AT1 activates both Ras/MEK/ERK pathway, which
  leads to an increased expression of c-fos mRNA, and JNK, which increases cJUN activity.
  AT1 also induces c-Src which, through PKC and PyK2, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase,
  stimulates JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. On the other hand, the protective arm of
  the RAAS is driven by ACE2-Ang (1-7)-Mas receptor, which plays complementary functions
  to the Angiotensin II-AT1 receptor. Mas receptor, indeed, reduces the activation
  of the MAPK, ERK and JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathways and increases the eNOS/NO pathway,
  down-regulating the NFAT transcription factor activity. As a consequence, Mas receptor
  activation reduces collagen synthesis, fibroblast activation and thrombosis. Moreover,
  Mas receptor activates PI3K/AKT and consequently CAMKII and NHE-1, increasing ANP
  gene expression, which further contributes to the protective role of ACE2-Ang (1-7).
  NPs indeed counteract the salt-retaining, vasoconstrictive, pro-inflammatory, pro-hypertrophic
  and pro-fibrotic functions of AT1. Through the stimulation of NPR-A and NPR-B and
  the production of cGMP, NPs increase diuresis, natriuresis, endothelial function
  and vasodilatation and reduce aldosterone production, sympathetic tone, inflammation
  and cardiac remodeling. As a consequence of their properties, NPs and Ang (1-7)
  may play a protective role during COVID-19 infection, reducing systemic inflammation,
  thrombosis, myocardial, lung and renal injury and improving prognosis. CAMKII, Ca
