caption: 'Simplified examples of the roles that different classes of ceRNAs play in
  HCC oncogenesis. a LncRNA: HULC functions in HCC by three mechanisms: (1) Transcription
  activation of HULC decreases miR-372 level in HCC, derepresses PRKACB function and
  CREB phosphorylation, hence enhancing chromatin accessibility and transcription.
  (2) HULC exerts a negative regulatory effect on miR-200a-3p and subsequent upregulation
  of ZEB1, which facilitates EMT, tumor growth and metastasis. (3) HULC sponges miR-6825-5p,
  miR-6845-5p and miR-6886-3p, leading to increased expression of USP22 and Sirt1,
  which activates the protective autophagy pathway and attenuates HCC cell sensitivity
  to chemotherapeutic agents. b CircRNA: CircASAP1 decreases miR-326 and miR-532-5p
  level, thus promoting proliferation and invasion of HCC through miR-326/MAPK/ERK1/2
  signaling, and raising TAMs infiltration through CSF-1 activation and secretion.
  c Pseudogene: RACGAP binds to miR-15, enhances the binding of GTP to RhoA and further
  ERK phosphorylation, promoting tumor cell proliferation and migration'
