caption: Differential Expression in the Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation Pathway.
  (A,B) The hepatic stellate cell activation canonical pathway in IPA (edited for
  simpler visualization; for full pathway, see ). Molecule interactions are shown
  as explained in the legend. DEGS are highlighted either in red (upregulated TME
  genes) or green (upregulated HCC tumor genes). Color intensity indicates increasing
  or decreasing degree of fold change. (C) Heatmap of the 22 collagen genes differentially
  expressed in the Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation Pathway for all 6 samples.
