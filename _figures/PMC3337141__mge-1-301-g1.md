caption: 'Figure 1.  Putative model: STF is a central coordinator of metabolic, hormonal
  and developmental signals. In Medicago leaf primordia, STF represses class 1 KNOX
  and LOB domain transcription factors while activating specific types of GRAS and
  TCP transcription factors as well as D-type cyclins to promote cell proliferation
  in the leaf margin controlling blade outgrowth. STF also activates sugar metabolism,
  the phenylpropanoid pathway and phytohormones biosynthesis including auxin, cytokinin,
  ABA and GA. Metabolic sugars and phytohormones in turn interact with each other
  and are known to activate cell division and promote growth. STF may also regulate
  stress response indirectly through metabolites such as proline, alanine, glutamine,
  putrescine or via phytohormones such as ABA. Solid lines indicate our observations
  in Medicago or tobacco based on a combination of microarray analysis, quantitative
  RT-PCR, transgenic analysis, hormone measurements and metabolite profiling. Broken
  lines are inferred by extrapolation from Arabidopsis and other species. Arrows indicate
  activation while blocked lines indicate repression.'
