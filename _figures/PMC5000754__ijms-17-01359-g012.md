caption: Outline of the PKC regulation of COX-2 and IL-8 production and the potential
  acting points of ghrelin (GHRP-2) in ovarian granulosa cells. PKC activates the
  intracellular signaling pathways, including the MAPKs (p38, JNK, ERK) as well as
  the NF-κB pathways, both of which would lead to transcription of COX-2 and IL-8,
  and consequently mediate the output of PGE2 and IL-8. Ghrelin (GHRP-2) may regulate
  MKP-1 and PPA2 to affect the PKC-mediated activation of MAPKs and NF-κB, as well
  as activate the Akt pathway, and subsequently to attenuate the PKC-induced COX-2
  and IL-8 transcription, resulting in reduction of COX-2 and IL-8 protein levels
  as well as PGE2 and IL-8 secretion.
