caption: The role of the Wnt/β-catenin, insulin (IN)/insulin-like growth factor 1
  (IGF-1)/insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1)/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein
  kinase B (Akt), and IN/IGF-1/IRS1/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) signaling pathways in the transcriptional regulation of aspartate β-hydroxylase
  (ASPH). The binding of Wnt ligand to Frizzled (FZD) cell-surface receptors and low
  density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5 and LRP6) leads
  to the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. β-catenin then moves into the
  nucleus where it interacts with T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF)
  proteins to form a transcriptional regulatory complex and activate the transcription
  of target genes such as IRS1. The overexpressed IRS1 relays signals from activated
  IN/IGF-1 receptors to downstream effector cascades such as the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/Akt
  signaling, and thus upregulate the expression of ASPH as a downstream target of
  these pathways. Namely, binding of IN and IGF-1 to insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-1
  receptor (IGF1R), respectively leads to the activation of the intrinsic tyrosine
  kinase. The kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of tyrosine (Y-P) on intracellular
  IRS1 and activates PI3K, which then phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) and generates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 interacts
  with phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), initiating a cascade of phosphorylation
  events and leading to the activation of Akt. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1
  can also result in the activation of the downstream MAPK pathway, i.e., PY-IRS1
  interacts with growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) and synaptophysin (Syp)
  proteins leading to the sequential activation of p21ras, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase (MAPKK), and MAPK [,,,].
