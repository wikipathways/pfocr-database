caption: Sphingolipid imbalance and potential impacts on cardiorenal and vascular
  systems. Sphingolipid imbalance has potential negative cardiac, renal and vascular
  implications. Of particular interest is the non‐reversible conversion of dihydroceramide
  (dhCer) into ceramide (Cer) within the de novo synthesis pathway mediated by Des‐1,
  conceivably making Des‐1 an attractive target to restore sphingolipid (SL) imbalance.
  RAAS, particularly angiotensin II, has been postulated to interact with sphingolipids,
  though mechanisms remain obscure. N.B. the de novo SL synthesis pathway has been
  simplified for illustration purposes
