caption: TSHR mediated signaling induced OF proliferation through Akt signaling and
  induction of miR-146a and miR-155. The model shows that TSHR signaling promotes
  cell proliferation in TED through multiple pathways. The TSHR canonical ligand,
  TSH or stimulatory anti-TSHR antibodies (as detected in the majority of TED patients)
  signal through the receptor and activate downstream G protein signaling inducing
  both PIP3 and cAMP secondary messengers. PIP3 activates the canonical PI3K/Akt pathway
  resulting in phosphorylation of Akt and subsequent cellular proliferation pathways
  (Akt phosphorylation can be blocked by the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002). TSHR signaling
  also upregulates expression of inflammatory cytokines and the inflammation related
  miRNAs, miR-146a and miR-155. These miRNAs in turn regulate cell proliferation inhibitors
  including PTEN and ZNRF3. The resultant downregulation of these target genes leads
  to an enhanced proliferative response, which is a major pathophysiological response
  observed in TED.
