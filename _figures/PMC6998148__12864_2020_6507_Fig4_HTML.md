caption: The pathway of glycolysis and glycerol synthesis. The numbers in the rectangles
  are enzyme codes, all the enzymes are identified in the transcriptome, the arrows
  show the direction of enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the red arrows show the synthesis
  of glycerol from starch; enzymes up-regulated on 0.5-h of stress are highlighted
  by light orange
