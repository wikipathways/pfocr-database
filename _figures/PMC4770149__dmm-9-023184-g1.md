caption: Developmental pathways are frequently activated in cancer. WNT, HH and NOTCH
  pathways are involved in many aspects of embryogenesis, including, but not limited
  to, patterning, cell fate specification, proliferation and stem cell maintenance.
  Dysregulation of each of these signal transduction pathways has been implicated
  in tumor initiation. In each case, the pathway is activated upon binding of a ligand
  to a receptor on the plasma membrane. This sets off a cascade of events allowing
  an effector to translocate to the nucleus and affect gene transcription. Pathway
  genes that are typically inactivated in cancer are highlighted in red; genes that
  are frequently hyperactivated in cancer are shown in green. WNT, wingless-type MMTV
  integration site; FRZ, Frizzled; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein;
  APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; CTNNB, β-catenin;
  P, phosphorylation; TCF, T-cell-specific transcription factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer
  binding factor; HH, hedgehog; PTC, patched; SMO, smoothened; GLI, GLI-family zinc
  finger; DLL, delta-like; JAG, jagged; NICD, notch intracellular domain; γ-sec, γ-secretase;
  RBPJ, recombination signaling binding protein for kappa J region.
