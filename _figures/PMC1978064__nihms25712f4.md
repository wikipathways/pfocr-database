caption: MiR-103/107 and PANKs may constitute coordinated transcription units with
  synergistic cellular effects concerning cellular acetyl-CoA levels and other metabolic
  pathway elements. A. A diagram shows a metabolic pathway that has been previously
  determined, along with some of the metabolic nodes which are predicted to be inhibited
  (red) or stimulated (green; through decrease of inhibitory targets) by miR-103/7.
  MiR-107 may be stimulated coordinately with PANK1. B. Like PANKs, miR-103/7 may
  function to increase cellular acetyl-CoA levels, and miR-103/7 may also inhibit
  the synthesis and metabolism of cellular lipids.
