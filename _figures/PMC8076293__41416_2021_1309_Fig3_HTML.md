caption: NF-κB is made up of both a canonical and non-canonical pathway, consisting
  of p50/RelA and p52/RelB, respectively. In the canonical pathway, TNFR superfamily
  members, as well as other transmembrane receptors, activate TAK1/TAB. TAK1/TAB then
  phosphorylates IKKβ, which in turn phosphorylates IκBα. IκBα acts to block the nuclear
  localisation domains of p50/RelA. However, when IκBα is phosphorylated by IKKβ,
  it dissociates from p50/RelA and is ubiquitinated and degraded. This frees p50/RelA
  to enter the nucleus where they can activate NF-κB1 responsive genes. In the non-canonical
  pathway, TNFR superfamily members deactivate the cIAP–TRAF2–TRAF3 complex. NIK is
  constantly being produced in the cell and is typically maintained in a steady state
  by degradation by cIAP. When cIAP is inactivated, NIK is allowed to accumulate in
  the cell. This causes it to phosphorylate IKKα, which in turn phosphorylates p100.
  This causes p100 to be processed into p52, which exposes the p52/RelB nuclear localisation
  domains. They can then enter the nucleus to activate NF-κB2 responsive genes. These
  pathways can also be activated by sensing other stimuli in the cell, such as dsRNA
  or dsDNA. These are sensed by the RIG-1 pathway or the cGAS-STING pathway, respectively.
