caption: 'The purine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway in H. pylori. Enzymes that have
  been studied in H. pylori by mutant analysis and/or biochemical analysis are shown
  in gray. Enzymes described in this work are shown in red frames. Enzymes with likely
  functions, whose genes have not yet been identified, are shown in green (figure
  adapted from Liechti and Goldberg () and Miller et al. ()). Abbreviations: GuaB,
  IMP dehydrogenase; GuaA, GMP synthetase; GuaC, GMP reductase; PurA, adenylosuccinate
  synthetase; PurB, adenylosuccinate lyase; Gpt, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase;
  Apt, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase; SurE, 5′-nucleotidase; deoD, gene encoding
  purine nucleoside phosphorylase; PunB, purine nucleoside phosphorylase; Ade, adenine
  deaminase; Add, adenosine deaminase; IMP, inosine monophosphate; XMP, xanthosine
  monophosphate; GMP, guanosine monophosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate'
