caption: Schematic representation of fructan metabolism in plants. FEH = Fructan Exohydrolase;
  FFT = Fructan:Fructan Fructosyltransferase; SFT = Sucrose:Fructan Fructosyltransferase;
  SST = Sucrose:Sucrose Fructosyltransferase; VIN = Vacuolar Invertase. 1- and 6-
  prefixes of enzymes refer to the position of the C of the Fru moiety that is attacked
  by the enzyme. The 6G- prefix indicates that the enzyme acts on the C6 of the Glc
  moiety. All the described reactions take place in the vacuole [,]. The biosynthetic
  pathway of agavins are still under investigation. Although fructans are believed
  to be stored in the vacuole, their presence in the apoplast suggested a possible
  vesicular-mediated transport between the vacuole and the apoplast [].
