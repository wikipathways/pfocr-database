caption: Model of endonuclein functions. Endonuclein may modulate several signal transduction
  pathways to the nucleus as well as chaperone activities in the ER. Through interaction
  with TIP-1, endonuclein may interfere with the Rho signaling pathway and the pathway
  leading to oncogenesis by Tax. RhoA, rhotekin and TIP-1 may form a ternary complex
  in the cytosol (indicated with two-way green arrows) that produces a signal in the
  nucleus increasing c-fos transcription (indicated with one-way green arrows). Tax
  may trans-activate a number of genes, e.g. c-fos (red arrows) through interaction
  with a number of cellular proteins. IL-6 stimulation activates two signaling pathways
  one involving the Janus kinases (Jaks) and one involving the MAP kinase cascade.
  The Jaks phosphorylate stat-3, which is then translocated into the nucleus. Usually,
  stat-3 then binds to the IL-6 response element (IL-6 RE), however, this does not
  occur at the Aα fibrinogen promoter that instead binds the transcription factor
  P16 (mt-SSB). The IL-6 induced transcription of Aα fibrinogen may thus be modulated
  by interaction of endonuclein with P16. In the ER endonuclein may modulate chaperone
  activities by interacting with the membrane bound co-chaperone HEJD (DNAJB11) and
  the chaperone BiP. The significance of the interaction of endonuclein with EIP-8
  (SDF2-like protein 1) and PSGs (PSBGs) in the ER is unknown at present. Two-way
  arrows indicate putative protein-protein interactions. Protein motifs or domains
  are indicated on the proteins, MIR, RGD, PDB, J, PDZ, SSB and NLS.
