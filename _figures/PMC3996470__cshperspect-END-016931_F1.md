caption: Receptor-mediated endocytic pathway in nonpolarized mammalian cells. The
  main pathways following clathrin-mediated endocytosis are illustrated. The pH of
  various organelles and the kinetics of passage between organelles are shown. LDL
  and transferrin and their receptors are shown as examples. (Inset) Cholesterol,
  produced by hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters by lysosomal acid lipase, binds to
  NPC2 and then NPC1 as part of the mechanism to facilitate cholesterol exit from
  the digestive organelles.
