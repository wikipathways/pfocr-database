caption: The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). The HBP is posed to act as a “glucose
  sensor” since the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc relies on the incorporation of products
  from glucose, amino acid (glutamine), fatty acid (acetyl-CoA), and nucleotide (uridine)
  metabolism. While the majority of the glucose entering the cell is committed to
  glycogen synthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis, 2 to 5 % of it
  enters the HBP for the formation of UDP-GlcNAc, a precursor for a variety of glycosylations,
  including O-GlcNAc modification. As is typical to metabolic pathways, the first
  and rate-limiting enzyme, GFAT, is negatively regulated by the end product, UDP-GlcNAc.
  Although the HBP requires several enzymatic steps, the two most well-studied enzymes
  (depicted in bold) in terms of insulin resistance are GFAT, the rate-limiting enzyme,
  and Emeg32.
