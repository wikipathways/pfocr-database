caption: Obafluorin protein coding sequences obaA-N are labelled and coloured according
  to related biosynthetic functions, with operons indicated with black arrows beneath
  the gene cluster. The domain architectures of the aryl carrier protein ObaK and
  nonribosomal peptide synthetase ObaI are represented (ArCP=Aryl carrier protein;
  C=Condensation domain; A=Adenylation domain; PCP=Peptidyl carrier protein domain;
  TE=Thioesterase domain; MbtH=MbtH-like domain), and the anticipated mechanism of
  TE-catalysed peptide release and β-lactone ring closure is also illustrated. 6 and
  7 represent breakdown products of 10, and were found to accumulate when either the
  biosynthesis of 5, or the assembly of 1, was disrupted. Compounds 3 and 8 were used
  in chemical feeding experiments in this work, but were not shown to be intermediates
  in the biosynthesis of 1.
