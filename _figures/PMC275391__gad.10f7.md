caption: BMPR-specific functions in limb development and molecular pathways elicited
  by IHH signaling. (Top) We propose that BMPR-IB specifically regulates the intracellular
  pathways that lead to cell death and formation of the initial cartilaginous skeleton
  in response to BMP, whereas BMPR-IA regulates the rate of chondrocyte differentiation.
  Schematic adapted from . (Bottom) Proposed molecular pathway downstream of IHH.
  See Discussion for description. Direct interaction is indicated by an arrowhead.
  Steps indicated by an arrow may be direct or indirect.
