caption: Proposed working model for OsGRF6 enhancing grain yield and bacterial blight
  resistance in rice. Under normal circumstances, OsGRF6 regulates the expression
  of its downstream target gene OsYUCCA1, which in turn modulates genes involved in
  auxin metabolism, promoting the development of rice secondary branches to enhance
  grain yield. However, upon pathogen infection, while the expression level of OsYUCCA1
  remains relatively constant, OsGRF6 transcription significantly increases. This
  upregulation activates OsWRKY82 expression, triggering the activation of disease‐responsive
  genes and accumulation of H2O2. Subsequently, OsGRF6 regulates genes in the JA metabolic
  pathway, thereby participating in the resistance process in rice
