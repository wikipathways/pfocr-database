caption: 'The pathway of pha-siRNAs derived from NBS 10 that is co-regulated by miRC134
  and phased siRNAs, siR2331, is shown as indicated. The blue arrows and lines show
  the regulatory pathway of pha-siRNAs produced from NBS 10, while the dark orange
  arrows and lines show the regulatory pathway of trans-cleavage by pha-siRNA, siR2331,
  which is derived from NBS 60. The colors in the boxes from left to right represent
  the Z-score of expression values of sRNAs in the leaf, flower and boll, respectively,
  while miRC130a5, siR2331, and siR120, are not differentially expressed in the tissues
  exampled. NBS 10 or 60: NBS-LRR disease resistance protein 10 or 60; ZF: Zinc finger
  protein; SuS: sucrose synthase; TRF: Transducin-related family protein; GRAS: GRAS
  family protein; Rib: Ribophorin 1 family protein; NSLT: Non-specific lipid-transfer
  protein; MAF: Mitochondrial carrier family protein; ATPB: ATP binding protein.'
