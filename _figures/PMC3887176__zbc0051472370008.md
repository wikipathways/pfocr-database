caption: Schematic diagram of the regulation of hepatic lipogenesis by the UDCA-AMPK-SMILE
  signaling pathway. UDCA activates AMPK, which leads to the induction of SMILE gene
  expression. LXRα-mediated lipogenic gene expression is subsequently repressed by
  the UDCA-AMPK-SMILE pathway through inhibition of LXRα transcriptional activity.
