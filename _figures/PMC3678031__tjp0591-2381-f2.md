caption: Different activity states of fear-related structures during fear learning
  and extinction evokes a distinct pattern of synaptic activity. In control conditions,
  fear expression is absent and activity in the medial central nucleus (CeM) neurons
  is low. During the acquisition of fear conditioning, conditioned (CS) and unconditioned
  stimulus (US) information converges on neurons in the basolateral group (BLA), leading
  to potentiation of CS inputs to neurons in the BLA. In turn, CeL ‘on’ cells are
  activated with ultimate disinhibition of CeM output neurons and an enhanced fear
  response. In the consolidation phase of fear conditioning, hippocampal (HPC) and
  prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PLPFC) activity increases and is thought to add context
  dependency (HPC) as well as to increase the basolateral amygdala activity for stronger
  fear expression. Extinction leads to suppression of the fear response through an
  additional pathway that suppresses the fear circuit. PLPFC activity not only decreases,
  but infralimbic prefrontal cortex (ILPFC) activity increases, which is thought to
  directly activate intercalated neurons (ITCs). This in turn leads to feed-forward
  inhibition of CeM output neurons and the suppression of the fear response. Interneurons
  are represented as black and white circles, indicating the large variety of interneurons,
  whereas pyramidal cells are shown as triangles. The strength of connections is represented
  by the width of the connecting lines with wider lines representing stronger connections.
  The activity of specific neuronal types is indicated as action potential spikes
  next to the individual regions, with two spikes representing low activity and multiple
  spikes representing increased activity.
