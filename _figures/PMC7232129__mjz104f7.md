caption: Diagram of the HBV-miR-3 activation of innate immunity to restrain HBV replication.
  (A) An HBV-encoded miRNA (HBV-miR-3) decreases the expression of SOCS5 in hepatocytes,
  leading to activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, thus initiating the transcription
  of hundreds of IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and enhancing the IFN-induced
  anti-HBV effect. (B) HBV-miR-3 activates the STAT1 signaling pathway by downregulating
  SOCS5 and thus promotes macrophage differentiation into the M1 type, which allows
  the elimination of physiologically aging, infected, or cancerous cells. (C) In M1
  macrophages, HBV-miR-3 promotes EGFR expression by inhibiting SOCS5, thereby regulating
  IL-6 secretion and inhibiting HBV replication.
