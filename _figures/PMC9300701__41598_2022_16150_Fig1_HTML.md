caption: Partial capsaicin, capsiate, and lignin biosynthetic pathways. Capsicum-specific
  capsaicin and capsiate biosynthetic pathways are branched from the lignin biosynthetic
  pathway in plants. The intermediate products and the main enzymes catalyzing each
  reaction are shown. Examples of varieties producing capsaicin and capsiate are provided
  at the bottom.
