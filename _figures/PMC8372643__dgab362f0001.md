caption: 'Cytopathological stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Left, Health. The
  inner blood-retinal barrier (BRB) consists of tightly connected endothelial cells
  (ECs) to pericytes, astrocytes, and Müller cells. Neurovascular coupling of glial
  cells, ECs, and neurons regulates blood flow and maintains hemodynamic stability
  to match the metabolic demands of the neurons. Middle, Nonproliferative DR is featured
  by thickening of vascular basement membrane, ECs damage with disruption of tight
  and adherent junctions, pericyte loss, occlusion of capillaries, and the subsequent
  capillary nonperfusion/ischemia. Neurodegeneration marked by neuronal apoptosis
  and reactive gliosis precedes microvascular impairments, and results in BRB breakdown,
  vasoregression, and defective neurovascular coupling. Right, Proliferative DR manifests
  with pathological neovascularization triggered by progressive retinal ischemia.
  Diabetic macular edema and proliferative DR are the major causes of blindness in
  DR. Abbreviations: GCL, ganglion cell layer; ILM, inner limiting membrane; INL,
  inner nuclear layer; IPL, inner plexiform layer; NFL, nerve fiber layer; OLM, outer
