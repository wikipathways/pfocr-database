caption: The main component of the Hippo signaling pathway. Current research shows
  that there are six key molecules in the Hippo signaling pathway, namely MST1/2,
  SAV1, LAST1/2, MOB1, YAP and TAZ. In normal cells, the Hippo pathway is activated,
  and YAP/TAZ is retained in the cytoplasm through some cascade reactions. In tumor
  cells, this pathway is closed and YAP/TAZ enters the nucleus to play the role of
  transcriptional regulators and promote the transcription of multiple oncogenes.
  Ultimately, promote the occurrence of tumors.
