caption: 'Evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways. Toll pathway: The virus is
  recognized by an unknown cytoplasmic receptor. Cytokine pro-spleatzle is cleaved
  to active cytokine spleatzle and binds to the Toll receptor. Adaptor proteins are
  recruited to the Toll receptor. A negative regulator of cactus degrades and a free
  Rel1 dimer translocates to the nucleus. The Rel1 dimer acts as a transcription factor
  for Toll regulated genes and produces antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (cecropin and
  defensin). IMD pathway: The virus binds to a transmembrane receptor of the cell
  and splits the pathway into two segments. One segment activates the JNK pathway
  and phosphorylates Rel2. Another segment recruits IMD and other adaptor proteins
  {Immune deficiency (IMD), fas-associated death domain (FADD) and death related ced-3/Nedd2-like
  protein (DREDD)} to cleave the C-terminal phosphorylated domain of Rel2.11. Cleaved
  Rel2 translocates to the nucleus and transcribes AMPs and a secretory protein, Vago.
  JAK/STAT pathway: This pathway is activated either by cytokine-like secretory protein
  from an infected cell or by the conserved JAK-STAT ligand Upd. Vago is secreted
  from nearby infected cells, binds to an unknown receptor, and recruits hopscotch
  (HOP) kinase. Similarly, Dome receptors bind Upd and receptor phosphorylation occurs
  through HOP kinase. The phosphorylated receptor is a docking site for STAT. STAT
  phosphorylation leads to dimerization. STAT dimer translocates to the nucleus and
  transcribes JAK/STAT-regulated genes and dengue virus restriction factor (DVRF).'
