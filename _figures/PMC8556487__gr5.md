caption: Schematic diagram of the metabolic pathway. Red represents the decreased
  metabolites. Green represents the increased metabolites. The metabolites changed
  in the LA group (growing heifers fed a Lys-adequate diet) compared with the LD group
  (growing heifers fed a Lys-deficient diet) from the metabolomics used to draw this
  figure. SUN = serum urea nitrogen; N = nitrogen.
