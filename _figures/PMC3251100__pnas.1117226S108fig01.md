caption: Effects of loss of mitochondrial ISE1 and chloroplast ISE2. (A) Gene expression
  analyses of A. thaliana ise1 and ise2 mutant embryos reveal that genes encoding
  chloroplast-localized proteins are especially affected in either mutant; genes encoding
  products for the light reactions of photosynthesis are almost universally repressed
  (shown in red; details are provided in Table S1 in the full-length text). (B) Consistent
  with abnormal chloroplast development, VIGS of ISE1 or ISE2 results in leaf chlorosis.
  The common phenotypes caused by abnormal mitochondria or chloroplasts are evidence
  for cross-talk between these organelles in plant cells. (C) Because ise1 or ise2
  mutants exhibit increased plasmodesmata formation and increased intercellular transport,
  the data reveal a pathway dubbed ONPS. ONPS is likely important for producing a
  coordinated response to the physiological status of cells in various tissues during
  development and in response to environmental signals.
