caption: A graphic model for the canonical autophagy pathway and roles of autophagy
  in cell survival and death. Under stress (e.g., starvation), autophagy is induced.
  This is followed by the formation of autophagosome, a double-membrane vesicle, which
  fuses with the lysosome to form autolysosome to degrade cargo(s) by lysosomal enzymes.
  Autophagy can be at different levels. In the homeostatic “Goldilocks Zone” condition,
  autophagy promotes cell survival and prevents cell death. When it is deregulated,
  cell death can be induced via two mechanisms. First, when autophagy is highly downregulated,
  the accumulation of damaged cellular organelles, such as dysfunctional mitochondria,
  or other components triggers cell death. Second, when autophagy is highly upregulated,
  it degrades essential cellular compoents or organelles such as mitochondria leading
  to autophagy-induced cell death (AuICD).
