caption: Pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. The hyperglycaemia state prompts the
  kidney to release VEGF and NO to expand afferent glomerular arterioles and AngII
  and ET-1 to contract efferent arterioles, which causes high blood pressure and leads
  to the occurrence of DN. TGF-β upregulation by Ang II promotes the process of glomerular
  fibrosis and aggravates DN. In hyperglycaemia, excessive ROS accumulate and open
  the mPTP, causing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration to increase, activating several
  apoptotic enzymes and inflammatory mediators and inducing glomerular podocyte damage.
  ROS can also activate the P38-MAPK pathway to increase the synthesis of TGF-β, which
  increases the level of ECM proliferation, promoting inflammation and fibrosis of
  the kidneys and ultimately leading to the occurrence of DN. High glucose can activate
  the AKT and Rheb pathways, inhibit the AMPK pathway, and promote the activation
  of mTOR to inhibit podocyte autophagy and promote the progression of DN
