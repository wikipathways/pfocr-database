caption: Schematic diagram to show that knockdown of Akt1 leads to upregulation of
  Akt2 in response to oxidative stress and its regulation of oxidative-stress-induced
  apoptosis through three pathways. Under Akt1 knockdown, oxidative stress induces
  upregulation of Akt2, which contributes to upregulation of the total Akt activity.
  As a result of the increased Akt activity, the MDM2-p53-Bak pathway was attenuated,
  the GSK-3β-MCL-1 pathway was enhanced, and the FOXO3A-Bim pathway was almost blocked.
  Together, these lead to enhanced resistance against oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis.
