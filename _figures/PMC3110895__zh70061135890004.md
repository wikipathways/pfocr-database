caption: 'Modeled miRNA mediated pathways in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. A:
  the mode of miRNAs that regulate apoptosis by modulating the apoptosis-signaling
  pathway is shown. B: an overview of miRNAs regulating the Wnt signaling pathway.
  C: miRNAs regulate the inflammation by mediating the Toll-like receptor pathway.
  D: miRNAs regulate the fibroblast activation and collagen deposition by modulating
  the TGF-β signaling pathway. Downregulated miRNAs are denoted in blue and upregulated
  in red.'
