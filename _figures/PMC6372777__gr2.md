caption: The figure describes the different effects of gut and brain serotonin on
  the osteoblast. The free circulating gut-derived serotonin directly signals the
  osteoblast by binding to the Htr1b receptor. The binding inhibits the phosphorylation
  of CREB by PKA, leading to the reduced expression of cyclin genes and thus decreased
  osteoblast proliferation. Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in the process, binding
  of Wnt to the frizzled receptor induces destabilsation of destruction complex, leading
  to the accumulation of unphosphorylated β-catenin which translocates to nucleus
  to form complex with members of T cells specific transcription factor of DNA binding
  proteins to regulate transcription of osteoblast target genes and osteoprotegrin.
  In contrast, serotonergic neurons signals to VMH neurons via Ht2C receptor inhibit
  synthesis of epinephrine and thus decrease symathetic tone. This decrease is relayed
  in osteoblasts by decreased signaling via β2 adrenergic receptor, which negatively
  controls osteoblast proliferation via a molecular clock gene/cyclin D1 and positively
  regulates bone resorption via activation of a PKA/ATF4-dependent pathway, leading
  to increased synthesis of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand. The
  inhibition of sympathetic activity by brain-derived serotonin thus results in increased
  formation and decreased resorption. 5HT, serotonin; LRP, low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein’ TPH, tyrosine hydroxylase 1; VMH, ventro-medial hypothalamus;
  CREB, cAMP-responsive element binding protein; Adrβ2, adrenergic β2 receptor; APC,
  adenomatous polyposis coli; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; PKA, phosphokinase A;
  ATF4, activating transcription factor 4.
