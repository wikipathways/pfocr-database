caption: The enrichment results of KEGG (a) and GO terms analysis (b) for the 41 candidate
  targets via ClueGO. The AGE-RAGE signaling pathway is the most reliable pathway
  in ClueGO (94.44%), regulation of reactive oxygen metabolism (36.92%) and endothelial
  cell proliferation (26.92%) are top two reliable biological functions.
