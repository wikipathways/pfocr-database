caption: 'Pathomechanisms of LN outside the kidney. (A) Genetic variants of homeostatic
  cell death (i.e., Fas variants) and the rapid clearance of dead cell corpses (e.g.,
  C3/4 variants or DNAses variants) result either in secondary necrosis or incomplete
  chromatin digestion, which both promote the exposure of nuclear particles to the
  immune system. (B) Nuclear particles resemble viral particles and activate the same
  viral nucleic acid recognition receptors on antigen-presenting cells. Genetic variants
  of those signaling elements are recognized to be risk factors for SLE. The activation
  of antigen-presenting cells changes (by costimulation) the immune interpretation
  of concomitantly presented antigens of the same particle. (C) Polyclonal lymphocyte
  expansion has multiple effects on the disease process and genetic variants further
  affect the differentiation of T helper cells. The complex regulation of lymphocyte
  activation and expansion is affected by multiple genetic variants. The susceptibility
  genes and genes/molecules that are involved within each biologic pathway are listed
  to the right: C1q, C2, C4A/B, C-reactive protein (CRP), α-glucoside transporter
  5 (ATG5), three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), B cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2),
  IL-2 receptor α (IL-2Rα), tyrosine-protein kinase receptor 3 (TYRO3), mast/stem
  cell growth factor (MGF), Fcγ receptor (FcGR), HLA IL-1 receptor–associated kinase
  (HLA IRAK), IFN regulatory factor (IRF), signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT), integrin αM (ITGAM), TNF α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), zinc finger protein
  36 (Zfp-36), IL-4, IFN-γ, MHCI, MHCII, TNF, TLR7, single Ig and Toll-IL 1 receptor
  (SIGIRR), B cell scaffold protein with ankyrin repeats 1 (BANK1), B lymphoid tyrosine
  kinase (BLK), IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1), protein tyrosine phosphatase,
  nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22), pituitary tumor-transforming 1 (PTTG1), RAS guanyl
  releasing protein 3 (RASGRP3), TNF (ligand) superfamily, member 4 (TNFSF4), TNFAIP3-interacting
  protein 1 (TNIP1), transmembrane activator and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin
  ligand interactor (TACI), BAFF/BLyS, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4),
  programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1/PDCD-1), and Gadd45 (activated by the stress-inducible
  GADD45).'
