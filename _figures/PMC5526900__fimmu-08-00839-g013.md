caption: Schematic representation demonstrating the role of l-arginine availability
  and transport in the modulation of host immune response and Leishmania survival
  inside macrophages. The model illustrates that the fate of Leishmania parasites
  inside macrophages depend on the availability of extracellular l-arginine and activation
  status of macrophages. If l-arginine is available, it is taken up from the external
  medium by cationic amino acid transporters (CAT-2) and metabolized by arginase and
  other polyamine biosynthetic and thiol metabolic pathway enzymes, such as ornithine
  decarboxylase (ODC), spermidine synthase (SpdS), spermine synthase (Sps) to produce
  l-ornithine, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Leishmania acquires either arginine
  or polyamines by the transporters present on the membrane of the parasitophorous
  vacuole which promotes amastigote proliferation and cell growth. Simultaneously,
  l-arginine can also be utilized by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) to produce
  nitric oxide (NO) that would kill Leishmania parasites. Leishmania infection modulate
  the host to downregulate this pathway for their survival.
