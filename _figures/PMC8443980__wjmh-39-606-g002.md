caption: Schematic diagram showing diet-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in obesity-related
  inflammation and insulin resistance. High-fat diet (HFD) could induce mitochondrial
  dysfunction via diet-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and palmitic acid (PA). Subsequently,
  released mtDNA in the cytosol activates the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING
  pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome, then triggering inflammatory response. In addition,
  downregulated electron transport chain (ETC) component and the altered ratio of
  glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) cause M1 polarization, then produce
  nitric oxide (NO) to prevent mitochondrial biogenesis by diminishing proliferator-activated
  receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α). Mitophagy is activated in obese individual.
  Of note, mitochondrial dysfunction inhibits adiponectin production, resulting in
  reduced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and consequently attenuated
  mitophagy and increased M1 polarization. HFD-induced fission enhances reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) level. All these mitochondrial dysfunctions contribute to obesity-related
  inflammation and insulin resistance.
