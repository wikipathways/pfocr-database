caption: General scheme of a DNA scaffold system. Enzymes of a desired metabolic pathway
  are fused with artificial DNA binding domains consisting of 4 ZFPs. The fused enzymes
  are then bound to their specific target sites on the DNA scaffold to form an artificial
  enzymatic cascade. The number of enzymes bound to the DNA scaffold, order of enzymes,
  relative angles of enzymes to each other, and distance between the binding sites
  for each enzyme can be controlled in a designable manner by simply changing the
  sequence of binding sites on the DNA scaffold.
