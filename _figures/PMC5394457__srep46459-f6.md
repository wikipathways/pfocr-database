caption: (A) Upon activation of Toll signaling by Gram-positive and Gram-negative
  bacteria infection, Cactin in the cytosol binds to Cactus and mediates the release
  of Dif and Dorsal from Cactus, allowing their translocation into the nucleus and
  activation of AMP genes. (B) Depletion of TmCactin mRNA causes Dif and Dorsal to
  be retained in the cytoplasm by Cactus, preventing their entry into the nucleus
  and activation of AMP gene expression.
