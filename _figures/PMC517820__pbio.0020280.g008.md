caption: Pheromone accumulated under the conditions of overcrowding or starvation
  induces the inhibition of gamravali production via the TGF-β pathway. Genes, mutants
  of which produced dauer larvae on lophenol, are shown in blue. Activated by the
  absence of gamravali, DAF-12 initiates the process of dauer larva production. One
  of its activities is to recruit DAF-16 into nuclei of neurons (shown in red). The
  insulin-like pathway has several physiological functions, among them the regulation
  of longevity and thermotolerance, and could be involved in the process of dauer
  formation by regulating the levels of gamravali via DAF-16.
