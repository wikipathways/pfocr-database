caption: Mosquito antiviral immune pathways. An overview of the different antiviral
  defense strategies available to mosquitoes and the potential receptors that act
  as pattern recognition receptors to initiate them. We focus on receptors for which
  there is experimental evidence for their putative role in sensing virus infection,
  including Drosophila melanogaster and mosquitoes. Receptors that are suspected or
  shown to be responsible for sensing viruses directly and initiating an antiviral
  response are colored in red. Protein receptors that may facilitate viral entry are
  colored in blue. Question marks denote strong candidate receptors or signaling pathways
  that so far lack any direct evidence for the receptor function in mosquitoes. Distinct
  pathways are in bold/underlined. Dotted arrows represent canonical pathway crosstalk.
