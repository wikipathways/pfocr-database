caption: Completion of the 6-hydroxymethyl-dihydropterin diphosphate biosynthesis
  I and the tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis pathways in E. siliculosus via the combination
  of annotation (yellow), orthology (green) and gap-filling (blue). The dihydrofolate
  compound with the dotted line is an instance of the dihydrofolate-glu-n class, following
  MetaCyc classes ontology structure. The class compound is the original reactant
  of the dihydrofolatereduct-rxn reaction retrieved with annotation, whereas the previous
  reaction of the pathway (dihydrofolatesynth-rxn) produces the instance dihydrofolate.
  Hence the gap-filling step that, using an extended version of MetaCyc, selects an
  instantiated version of dihydrofolatesynth-rxn that consumes the instance dihydrofolate.
