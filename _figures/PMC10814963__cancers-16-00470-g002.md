caption: The common mechanisms of melanoma progression and treatment resistance. PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways are the most characterized tumor growth/treatment resistance-driving
  signals in melanoma. The activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR is tightly controlled via a
  multistep process that can be initiated through tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs)
  such as IGF-1R. The stimulation of IGF-1R by its ligand triggers the activation
  of PI3K via their catalytic (p110) and regulatory (p85) subunits leading to the
  conversion of phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate (PIP2) lipids to phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) allowing PDK1 to phosphorylate the tyrosine 308 (T308)
  residue and mTORC2 to phosphorylate tyrosine 473 (T473) in the activation loop of
  AKT. Activated AKT then activates mTORC1 that, in turn, enhances the activation
  of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1), and
  ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K). The activation of the Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling
  pathway is mediated by the stimulation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) by its ligand
  for BRAF wild type or by active mutation in the cells bearing a NRAS mutation. The
  treatment of melanoma cells bearing BRAFV600E with specific inhibitors (e.g., dabrafenib)
  stimulates melanoma cells to overcome the inhibitory effect of BRAF through the
  generation of BRAF isoforms via alternative splicing. Treatment of patients with
  a NRAS mutation (NRASQ61R) with MEK inhibitors (e.g., trametinib) generates ERK
  negative feedback effects on RAS, which creates a bypass mechanism through activation
  of ARAF and/or CRAF to replace functional BRAF

    PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways are the most characterized tumor growth/treatment
