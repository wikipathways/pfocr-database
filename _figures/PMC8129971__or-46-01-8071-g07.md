caption: Model of MDM2-mediated B-Raf signaling pathway activation through 14-3-3
  inducing p53-dependent EMT progression and altering cell sensitivities to cancer
  drugs. MDM2 may regulate the transcriptional activity of the EMT transcription factors
  Snail, Slug and ZEB1 through B-Raf and p53-dependent mechanisms, resulting in decreased
  net production of 14-3-3, which can activate B-Raf. Activation of B-Raf induces
  the B-Raf signaling pathway. Subsequently, ERK1/2 activates the EMT transcription
  factors Snail, Slug and ZEB1, which promotes EMT progression. EMT progression induces
  cells to have different sensitivities to drugs in cell lines and tumors. 14-3-3,
  tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activation protein ε; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition;
  MDM2, MDM2 proto-oncogene, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; Slug, Snail family transcriptional
  repressor 2; Snail, Snail family transcriptional repressor 1; ZEB1, zinc finger
  E-box binding homeobox 1.
