caption: Model of PP2A regulation by S67/S62-phosphorylated ENSA/ARPP19 in human platelets
  and the impact of PKA/PKG on it. Human platelets contain the two closely related,
  but distinct proteins ENSA and ARPP19, which are phosphorylated (at S67/62) by MASTL
  (or a MASTL-like kinase) and then potently inhibit certain PP2A variants, leading
  to an increase in protein phosphorylation. PP2A enzymes are heterotrimers and may
  have more than 14 different isozymes in human platelets due to the heterogeneity
  of the B-subunit. One of them, B56δ, is phosphorylated by PKA, which activates the
  corresponding heterotrimer, leading to decreased protein phosphorylation. Both platelet
  PKA and PKG strongly phosphorylate ENSA/ARPP19 at their C-terminus (S109/S104),
  but the functional consequence of this phosphorylation remains to be elucidated.
  Platelet PKA/PKG also antagonize MASTL-mediated phosphorylation of ENSA/ARPP19 (S67/S62),
  but the mechanism needs to be elucidated. PP2A can reduce the phosphorylation of
  the major PKA subtrate VASP (at S157, S239) and thereby antagonize the PKA pathway.
  The PP2A family in platelets, which can be potently inhibited by low-dose okadaic
  acid, dephosphorylates many platelet phosphoproteins as partially shown here. PP2A-mediated
  dephosphorylation antagonizes the effects of many serine/threonine protein kinases
  including MAPKs, PKA, PKG and their substrates.
