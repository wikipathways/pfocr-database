caption: (A) All proteins associated with striated muscle contraction were extracted
  from the Reactome pathway database, and a protein-protein interaction network was
  visualized with STRING (). Each yellow circle represents a unique lysine acetylation
  site identified from rat skeletal or cardiac muscle samples.(B) Correlation plots
  of lysine-acetylated peptide intensities from skeletal muscle samples from three
  human individuals. The Pearson correlation coefficient is provided in each plot.(C)
  Four major mitochondrial metabolic pathways are depicted with the most acetylated
  protein identified in skeletal muscle for each enzymatic step in the pathways. The
  metabolic pathways of amino acid catabolism and fatty acid metabolism generate acetyl-CoA
  that is feeded into the TCA cycle. The TCA cycle generates NADH and FADH2, which
  serve as electron donors in the respiratory chain, ultimately resulting in the formation
  of ATP. All enzymes are represented by their gene names, and below each enzyme the
  number of identified lysine acetylation sites is given for rat and human muscle
  samples, respectively (rat/human).
