caption: a) Systems modeling framework used in this study. Inputs used for constraint-based
  and kinetic modeling are derived from molecular modeling calculations and experimental
  data when available. In order to understand how small-scale changes from enzyme
  variants affect the entire system, we look at the internal system changes (in reaction
  flux and metabolite concentration), differences in metabolite import & export, and
  how the cell handles an increase in oxidative or energy loads. Oxidative load is
  defined as the conversion of NADPH to NADP+, whose rate of reaction is increased
  under states of oxidative stress. Energy load is defined as the use of ATP. For
  all panels, the change in metabolic flux is colored by a difference from the wild-type
  flux state, red being a decreased flux in the mutant state and blue being an increased
  flux. b) Constraint-based modeling for the mutant COMT enzyme. The SNP is predicted
  to decrease the binding affinity of the enzyme in norepinephrine and dopamine metabolism.
  Increasing the Km (predicted) of COMT for the respective reactions leads to decreased
  flux and as a result decreased export of their methylated counterparts. Inhibitors
  tolcapone (TCW) and entacapone (ENT) are also predicted to have a lowered binding
  affinity to COMT, leading to similar effects. c) Kinetic modeling for the mutant
  G6PD enzyme. Decreases of the Km (predicted and experimental) and of the Kcat (experimental)
  lead to major systemic changes of the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis.
  The ratio of NADPH to NADP+ greatly decreases and subsequently the oxidative load
  able to be handled also decreases. d) Kinetic modeling for the mutant GAPDH enzyme.
  The cell is unable to handle the predicted increase in Km (predicted) and results
  in an infeasible state of the model, corresponding to cell lysis.
