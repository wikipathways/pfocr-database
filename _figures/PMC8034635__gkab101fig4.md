caption: Interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair during replication. (A) The mechanism
  of ICLs repair depends on the type of ICL. While the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway
  is the general mechanism to repair most forms of ICLs during replication, other
  repair mechanisms have evolved to repair specific types of ICLs. All ICL repair
  mechanisms require the conversion of replication forks. The E3 ligase, TRAIP, functions
  to regulate different repair pathways by controlling CMG ubiquitination. (B) Extensive
  ubiquitination of CMG by TRAIP lead to the CMG unloading, which is an essential
  step to activate the FA pathway. FA pathway regulates the incision of ICLs by nucleases,
  then activates translesion synthesis (TLS) to bypass the adduct, which is subsequently
  removed by nucleotide excision repair. The double strand break (DSB) at one strand
  is repaired by homologous recombination (HR), using the other strand as the template.
  (C) In the case of abasic (AP)-ICL and psoralen-ICL, TRAIP adds short ubiquitin
  chains on CMG that channels the damage to NEIL3, which incises the ICL without inducing
  a DSB. TLS bypasses the adduct and the AP site. (D) In case of acetaldehyde-ICL
  (AA-ICL), another mechanism has been recently identified that acts to bypass this
  lesion. The role of TRAIP or specific enzymes that incise this type of ICL is unknown.
  This repair pathway does not induce DSB or an AP site intermediate. All ICL repair
  converges through TLS bypass of the adduct to complete the repair in an error-prone
  manner.
