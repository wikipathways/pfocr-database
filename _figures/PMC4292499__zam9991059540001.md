caption: Schematic representation of the CWI pathway and its activation by sensor
  clustering. Wsc1 is depicted as a plasma membrane-spanning sensor that clusters
  upon the application of cell surface stress. Its cytoplasmic tail interacts with
  the GDP/GTP exchange factor Rom2, which activates the small GTPase Rho1 by catalyzing
  nucleotide exchange. Rho1-GTP then interacts with the sole yeast protein kinase
  C (Pkc1), which activates a conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade
  comprising the MAPKKK Bck1, a pair of MAPKKs (Mkk1, Mkk2), and the MAPK Slt2. Target
  transcription factors are the SBF complex, which regulates cell cycle progression,
  and Rlm1, which activates genes whose products are required for cell wall synthesis,
  composition, and remodeling.
