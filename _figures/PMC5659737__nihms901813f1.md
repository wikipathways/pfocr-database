caption: 'A. An increased expression of Dab2 was found in zona glomerulosa (ZG) and
  APA; whether it is due to reduced destruction of the Dab2/clathrin complex is unknown.
  Possible pathways by which Dab2 regulates CYP11B2 expression are indicated with
  dotted lines: a) direct triggering of CYP11B2 transcription; b) activation of TGFβ1
  receptor/Smad-mediated pathways; c) activation of Wnt/β catenin pathway. B and C.
  The canonical (left) and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways (right) are triggered
  by the binding of Wnt to the Frizzled serpentine receptor Fzd. In the canonical
  pathway the complex Wnt/Fzd binds the co-receptor LRP5/6 and, after recruiting the
  dishevelled protein Dsh, induces disassembling of the β-catenin complex formed by
  axin, Gsk3, APC and Ck1. This causes translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus,
  where it binds to the TCF/LEF1 proteins and triggers transcription of genes involved
  in growth and cell fate. In the APA this pathway favours CYP11B2 expression, directly
  via the nuclear receptors NURR1 and NURR7, or indirectly by enhancing the expression
  of AT1 receptors and the conversion of progesterone into 11β deoxycorticosterone
  via CYP21. In the non-canonical, Wnt, after binding to Fzd and recruiting Dsh, activates
  Rho associated kinase pathway and/or phosphokinase C (PKC), thereby regulating cytoskeleton
  and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Involvement of the non-canonical Wnt
  was suggested, but not demonstrated, in APA. D. The SHH glycoprotein binds the 12-transmembrane
  protein patched 1 (PTCH1) that, in turn, inhibits the smoothened receptor (SMO)
  leading to activation of GLI, and downstream of genes involved in cell growth and
  differentiation. SHH is barely detectable in the normal ZG, but markedly, albeit
  heterogeneously, expressed in APAs. E. Ang II, after binding to AT1R receptor, activates
  a variety of intracellular signalling pathways, including phospholipase C (PLC)
  via G protein subunit q/11 (Gq/11), protein kinase C (PKC), calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  kinases (CaMK), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transduction
  and activators of transcription (STAT), which lead to phosphorylation of transcription
  factors (TF) and transcription of genes involved in steroidogenesis and cell growth.'
