caption: 'Comparison of gene expression in immobilized relative to planktonic yeast:
  (A) intermediary metabolism and (B) cell cycle. Differentially expressed transcripts
  identified using GeneSpring were overlayed onto the S. cerevisiae KEGG biological
  pathway maps using GenMapp software. Detailed KEGG pathway cell cycle results are
  presented in Fig. S5. Transcript levels in immobilized well-fed yeast for days 3,
  5, 10, and 17 were averaged across replicate experiments. Red indicates instances
  where those values were at least twofold greater in immobilized cells than in planktonic
  cells. Green indicates instances where those values were at least twofold less in
  immobilized cells than in planktonic cells. White indicates that the gene was not
  found among the significant gene list identified earlier using GeneSpring. Gray
  denotes instances where transcript levels differed by less than twofold.'
