caption: BMPs and TGF-β signaling pathways in osteogenesis. Interaction between TGF-βs
  and BMPs and receptors initiate SMAD-dependent and non-SMAD-dependent signaling
  pathways. In SMAD-dependent signaling pathway, interaction between TGF-β and receptor
  leads to SMAD2/3 (R-SMAD) phosphorylation. Phosphorylated R-SMAD (SMAD2/3-Pi) binds
  SMAD4 protein and migrates to the nucleus of the cell where, alongside P300 and
  CREB-binding protein (CBP) coactivators, it controls RUNX2 expression. In the nucleus,
  SMAD2/3-Pi without SMAD4 recruits HDAC4 and HDAC5 and blocks RUNX2 activity. In
  BMP signaling, R-SMAD (SMAD1/5/8) binds SMAD4 and migrates to the nucleus, inducing
  RUNX2 and OSX expression through DLX5 activation. In the non-SMAD-dependent signaling
  pathway, TAK1 and TAB1 activate the MKKs p38 MAPK or Erk cascades, inducing DLX5,
  RUNX2 and OSX phosphorylation. The interaction between TGF-β and its receptor is
  blocked by the latent TGF-β binding protein (LTBP), which binds to TGF-β. Similarly,
  in order to prevent the BMP–receptor interaction, Gremlin, Chordin, Follistatin
  and Noggin proteins bind to BMP. The translocation of SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/8 into
  the nucleus is prevented by SMAD7 that, along with SMURF1/2, induce their proteasome-mediated
  degradation. In addition, the binding between ARKADIA and SMAD6/7 proteins positively
  regulates osteoblast differentiation.
