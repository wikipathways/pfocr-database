caption: The DEGs expression enriched in ethylene (A), jasmonic acid (JA) (B) and
  salicylic acid (SA) (C) pathway, expression levels are indicated by the heatmap
  at 0h, 24h, 48h, 72h and 7d after CYR34 infection, estimated using log2 (fold change)
  for each transcript. Genes marked with green was down-regulated in CY12.
