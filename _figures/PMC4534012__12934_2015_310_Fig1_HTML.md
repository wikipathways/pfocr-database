  involved in the regulation of ODHC specific activity under Tween 40 addition by
  C. crenatum (Brief). Red thick arrows indicate increased fluxes by overexpressing
  the corresponding genes. Dot-dashed lines represent decreased or cut off fluxes
  by reducing relevant enzyme activity and knocking out relevant genes, respectively.
