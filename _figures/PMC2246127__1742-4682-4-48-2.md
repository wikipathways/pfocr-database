caption: Major metabolic fluxes (μmol/g tissue/min) in neuron-astrocyte coupling for
  resting conditions. The fluxes were calculated with the objective of maximizing
  the glutamate/glutamine/GABA cycle fluxes between the two cell types with subsequent
  minimization of Euclidean norm of fluxes, using the uptake rates given in Table
  1 as constraints. Thick arrows show uptake and release reactions. Dashed arrows
  indicate shuttling of metabolites between the two cell types. Only key pathway fluxes
  are represented here for simplicity. The flux distributions for all the reactions
  listed in Additional File  are given in Additional File :Supplementary Table 3.
