caption: The role of FOXM1 in regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and autophagy
  in pancreatic cancer. FOXM1 is inhibited by FOXO subfamily and its interaction with
  β-catenin can promote the binding of β-catenin to TCF/LEF and activate Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling. For autophagy, overexpression of FOXM1 and nuclear displacement can regulate
  the expression of autophagy-related genes, which is manifested as promoting autophagy
