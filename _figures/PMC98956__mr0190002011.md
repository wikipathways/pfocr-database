caption: P(3HB) metabolism and N2 fixation in Rhizobium. (A) In the bacteroid of R.
  meliloti in symbiosis with alfalfa, the Tme malic enzyme is not expressed while
  Dme is inhibited by excess acetyl-CoA. Consequently, the levels of NAD(P)H are too
  low to pull acetyl-CoA into the P(3HB) pathway. In the free-living state, however,
  both Tme and Dme are active and P(3HB) formation is initiated under the desired
  conditions. (B) A direct link in central metabolism between the TCA cycle, P(3HB)
  formation, and amino acid metabolism is apparent from studies of the R. leguminosarum
  amino acid permease. Mutants that are less sensitive to high levels of aspartate
  have an increased secretion of glutamate. This increased production of glutamate
  is caused by inhibition of the TCA cycle either by a mutation in one of the genes
  encoding a TCA cycle enzyme or by a mutation in the PHA polymerase gene. In the
  absence of P(3HB) synthesis, the TCA cycle cannot function optimally, since increased
  reducing equivalents inhibit α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Both types of mutations
  cause accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, which is directly converted to glutamate.
  (C) Recycling of reducing equivalents in Rhizobium. The TCA cycle is the most important
  pathway for supplying precursors of amino acids. To keep the TCA cycle active in
  the anaerobic bacteroid, P(3HB) biosynthesis and nitrogenase oxidize reducing equivalents.
  Different Rhizobium spp. have evolved different means to regulate the three NAD(P)H-oxidizing
  pathways in the free-living or bacteroid state.
