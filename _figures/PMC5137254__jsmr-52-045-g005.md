caption: 'Proposed signaling pathways leading to ET-1-induced sustained vasoconstriction
  of the renal afferent arteriole. ET-1, acting via ETA receptors, triggers an increase
  in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), largely through Ca2+ entry via voltage-gated
  Ca2+ channels (Cav), leading to binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin (CaM), activation
  of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), phosphorylation of LC20 at Ser19 and cross-bridge
  cycling. Activation of ETA receptors also induces inhibition of myosin light chain
  phosphatase (MLCP) via activation of the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway, leading
  to increased LC20 phosphorylation at Ser19 due to the increase in MLCK: MLCP activity
  ratio. MLCP inhibition unmasks basal activity of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and/or
  zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) that phosphorylate LC20 at both Thr18 and
  Ser19. Activation of ETB receptors in the vascular smooth muscle cells leads to
  activation of ILK and/or ZIPK (or possibly other kinase(s) capable of phosphorylating
  LC20 at Thr18 and Ser19). The rapid increase in Ser19 phosphorylation accounts for
  the initial phase of the contractile response to ET-1, while the slower diphosphorylation
  at Thr18 and Ser19, associated with reduced rates of LC20 dephosphorylation and
  relaxation (), can account for the sustained contractile response to ET-1 and prolonged
  contraction that occurs following removal of the stimulus. This figure was originally
  published in Kidney International. Takeya K et al. Endothelin-1, but not angiotensin
  II, induces afferent arteriolar myosin diphosphorylation as a potential contributor
  to prolonged vasoconstriction. 2015; 87(2): 370–81. © International Society of Nephrology.'
