caption: PrimPol-dependent repriming of stalled replication intermediates. (A) PrimPol-mediated
  repriming can assist in resolving fork stalling after many different kinds of lesions,
  including CTNAs, bulky lesions such as those generated by UV light, G-4 quadruplexes,
  R-loops, and intra/interstrand crosslinks. PrimPol can also be utilised when low
  dNTPs pools cause fork stalling. Additionally, the absence or loss of an alternative
  DDT pathway, such as fork reversal, can lead to the deployment of a PrimPol-dependent
  pathway. (B) Replication fork uncoupling occurs when lesions, or other sources of
  replication stress, transiently stall the replicative polymerase without impeding
  the rest of the replisome. This uncoupling generates stretches of ssDNA onto which
  RPA can bind. (C) PrimPol (pink oval) can be recruited to these tracts of RPA bound
  ssDNA to facilitate the restart of the uncoupled fork by repriming. From here, the
  replicative polymerase will take over to complete synthesis. The repriming depicted
  here occurs on the leading strand, with lagging strand machinery omitted for clarity.
