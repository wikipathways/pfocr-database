caption: Schematic diagram of the Hippo signalling pathway. The canonical core kinase
  cassette is composed of the kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2, the adaptor proteins MOB1
  and SAV and the transcriptional co-factors YAP and TAZ. MST1/2 phosphorylates LATS1/2,
  that in turn phosphorylates and inactivates YAP. Phosphorylated YAP is sequestered
  by the 14-3-3 protein in the cytoplasm and degraded via proteasome facilitated by
  the SCFβTRCP E3 ligase. Other non-canonical regulators have been discovered to modulate
  the Hippo pathway core. The KIBRA–NF2–FERM complex and TOAK has been identified
  to play an activating role on MST1/2. WWC is an adaptor protein that binds and activates
  LATS while MAP4K may phosphorylate LATS directly. ITCH is a E3 ligase that promotes
  ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the LATS. AMOT directly binds to YAP/TAZ
  to promote YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic sequestration and phosphorylation. Integrin signalling
  is another non-canonical pathway that activates YAP through FAK/RhoA and VASP. Additionally,
  VASP can stabilise YAP/TAZ by inducing its dephosphorylation. YAP/TAZ associates
  with transcription factors such as TEAD and SMAD in the nucleus where they initiate
  gene transcription. Activity of the YAP/TAZ–TEAD complex in the nucleus may be inhibited
  by its binding with RUNX3. Created with BioRender.com.
