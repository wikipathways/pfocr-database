caption: 'Immune responses induced by lactic acid bacteria. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB)
  can provoke immune responses via two main pathways: inflammation and anticancer
  immune response. The inflammation pathways involve lipoteichoic acid (LTA) which
  can stimulate T cells to release interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12 and increase effectors
  Foxp3+RORγt- Tregs. In the anticancer immune response pathway, LAB stimulate the
  immune cells, such as T cells, dendritic cell (DC), natural killer (NK) and MHC
  class II cells to induce IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ
  and IL-1β to inhibit tumor growth.'
