caption: 'Key pathogenic effects of autoantibodies in autoantibody production in autoantibodies
  in autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD). Autoantibodies can induce tissue damage
  and create a proinflammatory microenvironment through multiple components of the
  innate and adaptive immune system. Localized tissue damage mediated by autoantibodies
  involves three mechanisms. First, antibody‐dependent cellular cytotoxicity (top
  right): killing of antibody coated target cells by binding of the Fc domain of IgG
  autoantibody by Fcγ receptor (FcγR)‐expressing effector cells, most notably natural
  killer (NK) cells, granulocytes and macrophages. Secondly, through antibody‐induced
  activation of the complement pathway (lower right). Complement activation can cause
  cell lysis through assembly of the membrane‐attack complex, can induce phagocytosis
  of complement C3 proteolytic fragment‐coated (opsonized) damaged cells, and can
  recruit innate inflammatory cells through release of small complement fragments
  C3a and C5a (anaphylatoxins). Thirdly, immunpoglobulin (Ig)G autoantibodies can
  activate various FcγR‐expressing innate immune cells (lower left). For example,
  plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC) that produce type I interferon (IFN), macrophages
  that produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐α and mast cells that release granules
  with degrading enzymes and produce proinflammatory cytokines. Systemic inflammation
  is primarily mediated through deposition of circulating immune complexes (IC) (top
  left). These ICs contain autoantibodies bound to self‐antigens (such as DNA), Toll‐like
  receptor (TLR) ligands and post‐translationally modified proteins. IC deposition
  induces the systemic and synergistic activation of cells of the innate immune system
  via FcγR and TLR ligation. As a result, T helper cell responses are amplified and
  trigger the release of degrading enzymes and production of proinflammatory cytokines
  such as TNF‐α, interleukin (IL)‐1β and IL‐6. Together, these mechanisms contribute
  to a proinflammatory microenvironment with cytokines that further enhance inflammation
  and damage, through activation of parenchymal and immune cells, production of matrix‐degrading
  and proteolytic enzymes and release of reactive oxygen species. Figure created using
