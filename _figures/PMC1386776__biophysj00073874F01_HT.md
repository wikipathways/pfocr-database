caption: (A) The pheromone signaling pathway. Shown are the pheromone receptor (Ste2),
  G-protein α-, β-, and γ-subunits (Gpa1, Ste4, Ste18), the Regulator of G-protein
  signaling (RGS, Sst2) which accelerates Gpa1 GTPase activity, effector kinases including
  the MAPKKK kinase (Ste20), MAPKK kinase (Ste11), MAPK kinase (Ste7), MAP kinases
  (Kss1, Fus3), and nuclear transcription factor (Ste12). Three of the kinases bind
  to a kinase scaffold protein (Ste5). Several other effectors and regulatory components
  are not shown, for clarity. Pheromone-dependent transcriptional induction of SST2
  represents a negative feedback loop. (B) A schematic diagram of Fus3 regulation.
  Fus3 activation and deactivation are assumed to occur through a distributive kinetic
  mechanism in which two collisions with Ste7 (MAPK kinase) and Msg5 (MAPK phosphatase)
  are required. The MAPK Kss1 also activates the pheromone response pathway, and the
  phosphatases Ptp2 and Ptp3 also inactivate kinase activity. However, to simplify
  the models the kinase and phosphatase activities of these proteins are not distinguished
  from those of Fus3 and Msg5.
