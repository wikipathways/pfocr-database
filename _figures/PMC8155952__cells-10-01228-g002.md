caption: The dopamine system. Binding of dopamine to D1 or D5 receptors activates
  PLC signaling pathway that triggers Ca2+ release from the cisterns of endoplasmic
  reticulum and has a stimulatory effect on adenylyl cyclase that induces cAMP increase.
  When acting through D2, D3, or D4 receptors, dopamine exerts an inhibitory effect
  toward adenylyl cyclase leading to decrease in intracellular cAMP.
