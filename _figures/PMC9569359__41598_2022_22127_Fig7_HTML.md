caption: Metabolic pathway map displaying significant metabolite quantity differences
  between the suspended and lawn biofilm cultures. Metabolites with a fold change
  (FC) (biofilm/suspended) > 2 are red indicating higher levels in biofilm and FC < 0.5
  are blue indicating higher levels in suspended culture. Pathways showing significant
  changes between suspended culture and biofilm have the arrows color-coded including
  alanine metabolism (purple), creatine metabolism (brown), glutathione metabolism
  (dark blue), choline metabolism (green), and the TCA cycle (orange). Metabolites
  that were detected but the fold change is less than two-fold are shown in black
  and metabolites not detected are shown in gray (GABA gamma-aminobutyric acid, aKG
  alpha-ketoglutarate, ATP adenosine triphosphate, ADP adenosine diphosphate, NAD
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NADH nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced,
  GPC glycerophosphocholine, G-3-P glycerol-3-phosphate, PC phosphorylcholine, GPE
  glycerophosphoethanolamine).
