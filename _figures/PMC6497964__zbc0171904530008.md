caption: A model of the signaling pathway from EPHB6 to catecholamine biosynthesis
  in AGCCs. This diagram illustrates a hypothetic pathway from cell surface EPHB6
  to CAT biosynthesis in AGCCs. EPHB6 exerts reverse signaling through EFNB1, which
  transduces signals into AGCCs and activates RAC1. RAC1, in turn, activates MKK7.
  MKK7 phosphorylates and activates JNK, which further phosphorylates c-Jun. c-Jun
  phosphorylation leads to increased nuclear AP-1 association with the AP-1 site in
  the 5′ UTR (+ 383/+393) of the Egr1 gene. This augments Egr1 expression at both
  the mRNA and protein levels. EGR1 binds to three EGR1-binding sites in the 5′ upstream
  sequence of the TH gene at −121/−112, −103/−96, and −50/−41 and augments transcription
  and translation of TH, the rate-limiting enzyme in CAT biosynthesis. This pathway
  merges with the signaling pathway of AChR > Ca2+ > RAC1 > MKK7 > JNK > c-Jun/AP1
  > EGR1 > TH > CAT starting from RAC1 and is necessary for optimal function of the
  latter. Deletion of EPHB6 (hence, diminished reverse signaling via EFNB1) compromises
  this signaling pathway, resulting in decreased CAT biosynthesis. The default nongenomic
  effect of testosterone is to augment K+ outflow via the BK channel, leading to a
  faster closure of VGCCs and, hence, lower total Ca2+ influx triggered by ACh. EFNB1
  reverse signaling negatively regulates such a testosterone effect. In the absence
  of EPHB6 (hence, reduced EFNB1 reverse signaling), the augmenting effect of testosterone
  on K+ efflux is now revealed, leading to faster VGCC closure and resulting in a
  negative effect on the Ca2+ > RAC1 > MKK7 > JNK > c-Jun/AP1 > EGR1 > TH > CAT pathway.
  On the other hand, although in the 5′ UTR of Egr1 gene there are five SREs, they
  are not involved in the EPHB6 signaling pathway to TH biosynthesis because the activation
  of ELK1, which forms a complex with serum-responsive factors to become a transcription
  factor binding to SRE, and the activation of ELK1 upstream kinases ERK2 and p38MAPK
  are not affected by EPHB6 deletion. Dark lines with arrows, signaling proven in
  this study; blocked gray lines with arrows, theoretically possible signaling based
  on other studies but not functional in AGCCs according to our study; solid dark
  lines with arrows, signaling proven in this study; dashed gray lines with arrows,
