caption: The BMP-7 protein is a secreted cytokine that normally functions to stimulate
  gene transcription by binding to its receptor and activating the Smad1/5/8 transcription
  factors. The activation of the BMP-7 pathway also suppresses the pro-fibrotic TGF-β
  pathway by sequestering Smad4, a protein necessary for the transcription of many
  TGF-β-dependent genes. These counter-regulatory mechanisms are important for the
  suppression of TGF-β-dependent pro-fibrotic pathways during kidney repair. However,
  chronic urinary tract obstruction results in the HDAC-dependent suppression of Bmp-7
  transcription. The loss of BMP-7 results in the dysregulation of kidney repair along
  with the persistent and inappropriate activation of the TGF-β pathway. Importantly,
  treatment with pharmacologic HDAC inhibitors restores BMP-7 expression, suppresses
  TGF-β-dependent signaling pathways, and prevents renal fibrosis following chronic
  urinary tract obstruction.
