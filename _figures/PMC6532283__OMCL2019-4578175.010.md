caption: Possible mechanisms responsible for the effect of Nox on SAP-associated cardiac
  injury. During pancreatitis, a large number of proinflammatory cytokines and toxic
  substances are released into bloodstream, which can exert stimulation to Nox in
  the myocardial cell. The hyperactivity of Nox results in the overproduction of ROS
  and activates the redox-sensitive MAPK signaling pathways. These events upregulate
  the expression of caspase-associated proteins, which ultimately induces cell apoptosis.
  Pretreatment with apocynin to inhibit the activity of Nox can lead to the decrease
  in ROS production under SAP conditions, thus alleviating the activation of downstream
  signaling pathways and thereby affording beneficial effects.
