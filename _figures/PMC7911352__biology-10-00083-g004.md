caption: 'Other metabolic pathways that regulate ferroptosis. Aside from the main
  metabolic pathways, there are additional pathways that can regulate ferroptosis
  such as the FSP1-CoQ10pathway, glutaminolysis and mitochondria-related pathway,
  and selective autophagy pathways. Ferroptosis inhibiting and inducing factors are
  indicated in green and red, respectively. (Abbreviations: α-KG, α-ketoglutarate;
  ARNTL, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator like; FOXM1, forkhead box
  protein M1; FSP1, ferroptosis suppressor protein 1; GLS2, glutaminase 2; GOT1, glutamate
  oxaloacetate transaminase 1; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; HSP90, heat shock protein
  90; MESH1, metazoan SpoT homologue 1; NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADK,
  NAD kinase; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NEDD4, neuronal precursor
  cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4; SLC1A5, solute carrier family 1
  member 5; SLC38A5, solute carrier family 38 member 5; SQSTM1, sequestosome 1; VDAC2/3,
  voltage-dependent anion channels 2 and 3).'
