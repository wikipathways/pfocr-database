caption: Capecitabine activation and subsequent 5-FU activation, action, transport
  and catabolism. Capecitabine is an oral 5-FU prodrug that is rationally designed
  so that concentrations of the cytotoxic metabolites FdUMP, FdUTP and FUTP are higher
  within malignant cells than within normal cells. After absorption in the gut, most
  of the drug activation occurs via the common pro-drug activation route (a), starting
  in the liver and finishing in the tumour. Additionally, 5-FU can be converted to
  its active compounds via alternate activation routes (b) in colon tumour cells and
  cells from multiple other tissues. Toxicity may occur if non-target tissue is exposed
  to activated capecitabine/5-FU (ie, FdUMP, FdUTP and FUTP), either when 5-FU is
  activated prior to arrival at the tumour or when it exits target tissue and is subsequently
  activated. 5-FU released in circulation may be quickly metabolised (c) in the liver
  by enzymes including DPYD. Gene names for candidate enzymes, provided in circles,
  are defined in online supplementary table S1. Drug catabolites are provided in rectangles.
  Primary (rationally designed) pathway are shown in solid lines, and alternative
  pathways shown in dashed lines.

  cancer identifies new toxicity variants at DPYD and a putative role for ENOSF1 rather
  than TYMS.
