caption: Role of desmosome in head and neck cancer. The inhibitor PKI166 inhibits
  the phosphorylation of EGFR, DSG2, and PG, and upregulates the expression of DSG2
  and DSC2, thereby stabilizing cell-cell adhesion. Cisplatin upregulates β-catenin
  and down-regulated PG, leading to cisplatin resistance in head and neck cancer cells.
  Cetuximab upregulates the expression of EGFR and DSG3 in head and neck cancer cells.
  EGFR enhances ADAM-mediated intracellular hydrolysis of DSG2, resulting in desmosome
  loss. DSG3 enhances PKC-mediated phosphorylation of c-JUN, AP-1, and Ezrin. KLK5
  cleaves DSG1, causing desmosome breakdown. Transcription factor SNAI2 causes desmosome
  breakdown by downregulating DSG3, DSC2, PKP1, and PG. PG inhibits the transcriptional
  regulation of TCF/LEF in the nucleus. When PG is recruited to the cell membrane
  by DSG3, TCF/LEF transcription is activated, and the expressions of target genes
  c-MYC, Cyclin D1, and MMP7 are upregulated. PG interacts with p53 to promote the
  expression of the target gene 14-3-3σ. DSG1 and Erbin inhibit the EGF/EGFR/Erk1/2
  signaling pathway. DSG2 promotes extracellular vesicle secretion by inhibiting CAV1.
  DSG2 palmitoylation stimulates extracellular vesicle secretion. DSG2 C-terminal
  and IL8 are present in extracellular vesicles and encourage the growth of fibroblasts
  and HNC cells. DSC1 upregulates the expression of c-MYC, Cyclin D1, and β-catenin.
  DNP promotes PKP3 expression by inhibiting miR-149. PG can upregulate BCL2.
