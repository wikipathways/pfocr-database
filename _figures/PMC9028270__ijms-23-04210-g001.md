caption: Phases of wound repair and their cellular constituents. The wound restoration
  process starts with the formation of a platelet plug (haemostasis) to prevent blood
  loss through the construction of a fibrin matrix. This is followed by removal of
  debris and prevention of infection (inflammation) by neutrophils and mast cells.
  Macrophages clear the remaining debris. Fibroblast, epidermal stem cell (ESC) and
  keratinocyte migration, and neoangiogenesis, aided by various biological signals,
  contribute to the resurfacing of the epithelium and the formation of granulation
  tissue and wound closure. The final phase involves remodelling of the connective
  tissue.
