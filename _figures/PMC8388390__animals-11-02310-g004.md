caption: GeneMANIA Cytoscape interaction network of known physical interactions, gene
  co-expression, and cytokine pathway with query genes (IFNG, IL4, IL10, IL12B, IL13,
  and TNF) that were expressed in this study were found to be involved with the function
  of cytokine activity (brown nodes), inflammatory response (yellow nodes), leukocyte
  differentiation (blue nodes), leukocyte proliferation (lilac nodes) and lymphocyte
  proliferation (violet nodes). Additional genes are predicted to be involved in the
  network (gray nodes).
