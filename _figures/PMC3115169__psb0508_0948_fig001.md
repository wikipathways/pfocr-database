caption: 'The cold signaling pathway, which involves ICE1 and CBF3/DREB1A. Cold stress
  transiently increases Ca2+ levels and activates protein kinases, including MAP kinases,
  necessary for cold acclimation. ICE1 is activated by cold stress. SIZ1 mediates
  sumoylation of ICE1 to stabilize it and to control CBF3/DREB1A gene expression.
  Phosphorylation may be involved in the activation of ICE1, but no clear evidence
  for this has been demonstrated. HOS1 ubiquitylates ICE1 for proteasome-dependent
  degradation. SIZ1 mediates sumoylation of ICE1 for stabilization. The CBF3/DREB1A
  transcription factor controls cold-responsive genes and cold acclimation. Abbreviations:
  CBF, C-repeat binding factor (an AP2-type transcription factor); COR, cold-responsive
  genes; HOS1, high expression of osmotically responsive genes1 (a RING finger ubiquitin
  E3 ligase); ICE1, inducer of CBF expression1 [a MYC-type bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix)
  transcription factor]; SIZ1, SAP and Miz1 [a SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier)
  E3 ligase]; P, phosphorylation; S, sumoylation; Ub, ubiquitylation.'
