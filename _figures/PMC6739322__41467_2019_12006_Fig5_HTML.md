caption: A model for IL-23 assembly control in the cell. Incomplete folding of IL-23αwt
  is recognized by chaperones along the secretory pathway. IL-23α is incompletely
  structured in isolation, in particular the first out of its four helices, and can
  be recognized by BiP during early biogenesis steps within the ER. ERp44, a member
  of the PDI-family, supports BiP function by retrieving IL-23α from the ERGIC compartment
  to the ER, thus acting downstream of BiP. BiP and ERp44 act together, to maintain
  assembly competency of IL-23α. Upon assembly with IL-12β, IL-23α completes folding
  of its first helix, which inhibits chaperone interaction and results in secretion
  of the heterodimeric IL-23 complex, connected by a disulfide bond. If IL-23α does
  not assemble properly, it is targeted for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). ERAD
  is slowed down by the presence of free cysteines in IL-23α, thus most likely by
  chaperone binding. Stabilization of the first helix renders IL-23α insensitive to
  chaperone interaction and allows independent folding and secretion. Despite independent
  secretion, IL-23αopt is still able to interact with IL-12β. IL-23 induces strong
  signaling upon receptor binding, whereas IL-23αopt shows weak receptor activation.
  Loops within the structure of IL-23α are indicated as dashed lines
