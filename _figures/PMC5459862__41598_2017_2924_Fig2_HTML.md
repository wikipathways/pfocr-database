caption: 'Comparison of metabolites identified by CE-TOF-MS. (a) The metabolites are
  superimposed on a metabolite pathway map involving the metabolism of L-carnitine
  and ketone bodies. (b) The metabolites are superimposed on a metabolite pathway
  map involving the metabolism of glycolysis, TCA cycle and energy carriers. Blue:
  HFD group. Red: HFD + L-carnitine group. The metabolites showing a significant difference
  between groups were indicated with *<0.05.'
