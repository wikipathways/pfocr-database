caption: B-cell tolerance checkpoints and loss of self-tolerance in different forms
  of secondary ITP. Tolerance pathways are denoted by green dashed lines. Solid blue
  lines represent normal B-cell developmental stages. Where failures in central and
  peripheral B-cell tolerance might occur in secondary forms of ITP are shown by the
  solid pink lines. Central B-lymphocyte tolerance checkpoints operate during primary
  cell maturation in the bone marrow and include clonal deletion and receptor editing.
  Cross-linking of membrane-bound antibodies on immature B cells leads to apoptosis.
  Antigen receptor specificity is also revised by receptor editing, that is, the continuation
  or reinitiation of antibody gene rearrangement, usually at light chain loci, in
  lymphocytes that already have functional antibody. Receptor editing can change a
  self-reactive light chain (shown in pink) to a non–self-reactive light chain (shown
  in purple). Peripheral tolerance checkpoints monitor and alter the repertoire in
  lymphocytes that have exited from primary lymphoid organs. Even if central tolerance
  is perfect, there is a need to regulate peripheral tolerance because somatic mutation
  can randomly generate autoreactive specificities. Somatic mutations are shown as
  pink circles on the heavy and light chain V-regions. Heavy chain isotype switching
  (which usually accompanies somatic mutation during an immune response) is shown
  by the change in color of the heavy chain constant region from green to blue. Anergy
  and death of lymphocytes after an immune response also contribute to peripheral
  tolerance. Immune stimulation with a pathogen that mimics self-antigen (molecular
  mimicry) can also lead to a loss of peripheral tolerance and feed into the antiself
  ITP pathway. Peripheral AS cells in ITP can arise either primarily, through a defect
  in central or early tolerance checkpoints, or secondarily as a result of immune
  stimulation. Autoreactive peripheral B lymphocytes in ITP can include memory cells
  and plasma cells. Because of space constraints, only the activated cell arising
  from an immune response for the ITP pathway (not the plasmablast, memory cell or
  plasma cell) is shown. AS indicates antiself (autoreactive); NS, nonself-reactive;
  Ag, antigen. Professional illustration by Paulette Dennis.

  description: B-cell tolerance checkpoints and loss of self-tolerance in different
    forms of secondary ITP. Tolerance pathways are denoted by green dashed lines.
    Solid blue lines represent normal B-cell developmental stages. Where failures
    in central and peripheral B-cell tolerance might occur in secondary forms of ITP
    are shown by the solid pink lines. Central B-lymphocyte tolerance checkpoints
    operate during primary cell maturation in the bone marrow and include clonal deletion

    cells leads to apoptosis. Antigen receptor specificity is also revised by receptor

    usually at light chain loci, in lymphocytes that already have functional antibody.
    Receptor editing can change a self-reactive light chain (shown in pink) to a non–self-reactive
    light chain (shown in purple). Peripheral tolerance checkpoints monitor and alter
