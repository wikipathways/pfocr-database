  MVP14. The black dashed lines frame the corresponding metabolic pathways described
  in black bold text. The red additives represent the promoters of this pathway or
  enzyme. Green additives represent inhibitors of this pathway or enzyme. Red numbers
  mean an increase in astaxanthin cell yield. Green numbers mean reduction of astaxanthin
  content. The arrow points to the pathway or site affected by the corresponding additive.
