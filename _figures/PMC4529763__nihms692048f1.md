caption: '(a) Schematic representation of the transcriptional response of S. cerevisiae
  to oleic acid. The core Pip2-Oaf1 asymmetric network motif is nested within a larger
  network that includes the feedforward action of Adr1 and the dampening action of
  Oaf3. (b) Depending on organism, cell type, or even environmental condition, the
  proliferation of peroxisomes is achieved through two routes: growth and division
  of existing peroxisomes, and de novo biogenesis of preperoxisomal vesicles from
  the ER that mature via fusion into mature organelles. In both cases, peroxisomal
  matrix enzymes and membrane proteins are acquired by the peroxisome posttranslationally,
  either directly from the cytosol (some membrane proteins and all matrix proteins)
  or from the ER (some membrane proteins). Control over either pathway can occur through
  signaling and transcriptional responses to environmental stimuli or intracellular
  signaling and crosstalk from other organelles. In this example, an innate immune
  response is initiated by the detection of viral RNA by RLR that initiates a signal
  cascade by activating MAVS on mitochondria and peroxisomes. Mitochondrial MAVS activates
  a type I interferon response resulting in the upregulation of IFN-β expression and,
  via autocrine signaling, the upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG).
  Peroxisomal MAVS activates a type III interferon response that directly upregulates
  the expression of ISG and IFN-λ. Through an as yet unidentified mechanism, peroxisomal
  genes including PEX11β are also upregulated, resulting in the proliferation of peroxisomes.'
