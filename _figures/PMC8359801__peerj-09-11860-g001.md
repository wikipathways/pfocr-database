caption: Atmospheric CO2 and Oxygen (O2) combines with metabolite ribulose 1, 5 bisphosphate
  (RuBP) in a Rubisco catalyzed reaction. The carboxylation reaction initiates Calvin
  cycle while oxygenation reaction yields phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) and phosphoglycolate
  (2-PG). Catabolism of 2-PG onset the photorespiratory pathway which is distributed
  over three compartments i.e. chloroplast, peroxisome, and mitochondria, respectively.
  2-PG is converted into glycolate (GCA), glyoxylate (GOA), glycine (GLY), serine
  (SER), hydroxypyruvate (HPR), glycerate (GCEA), and 3-PGA, respectively. The photorespiratory
  pathway outputs i.e. CO2 and ammonia (NH3) have also been added in the mitochondria.
  Cyanobacterial glycolate decarboxylation pathway (labelled 1–5) genes integrated
  in chloroplast at GCA level. The cyanobacterial pathway comprises of glycolate dehydrogenase
  (GDH) which produces GOA from GCA, hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (HDH) yields oxalate,
  oxalate decarboxylase produces formate and one molecule of CO2, and formate dehydrogenase
  yields another molecule of CO2. These two molecules of CO2 produced after the catabolism
  of GCA in chloroplast depicts the photorespiratory bypass output and are utilized
  in Rubisco catalyzed carboxylation reaction.
