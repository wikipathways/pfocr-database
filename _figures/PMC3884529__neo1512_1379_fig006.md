caption: Proposed schematic. At the basal level, AKT works to stabilize BCA2 so that
  it is free to ubiquitinate protein substrates, including those controlling phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
  of AMPKα1 at Thr172, targeting them for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway, resulting in inhibition of AMPK signaling in breast cancer cells. The activation
  of AMPK by metformin or AICAR, however, increases BCA2 protein levels, inciting
  a potential cancer cell survival involving PI3K/Akt. Therefore, the balance of AMPK
  and PI3K/AKT/BCA2 might control breast cancer cell sensitivity to metformin therapy
  and the tumor cell life-death switch.
