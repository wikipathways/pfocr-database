caption: 'Multiple sensory pathways in α subgroup of Proteobacteria. The diagram presents
  a composite picture of the current understanding of signaling pathways in these
  bacteria. In R. centenum, CheA and CheY2 are fused into a single gene product. In
  all cases, CheY1 and CheY2 may interact to allow signal termination. R. sphaeroides
  also has a second sensory pathway, shown by the single-headed broken arrows. Abbreviations:
  R, CheR; B, CheB; W, CheW; A, CheA; P, phosphate; YII, CheY2; YI, CheY1; WII, CheW2;
  AII, CheA2; YIII, CheY3.'
