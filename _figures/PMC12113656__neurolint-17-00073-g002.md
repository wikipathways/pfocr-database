caption: Overview of the heat shock response pathway and the potential effects of
  the c.823+6C>T mutation on the capacity of DNAJB2 to manage cellular stress mechanisms.
  1. Stressors such as heat, oxidative stress, etc., can trigger the heat shock response
  pathway. 2. The cell senses stress and initiates the heat shock response. 3. Release
  of Heat Shock Factors (HSFs) from their inactive state in the cytoplasm 4. Activated
  HSFs translocate to the nucleus. 5. HSFs bind to Heat Shock Elements (HSE), initiating
  the transcription of heat shock proteins (HSPs). 6. HSPs, including DNAJB2 (HSP40),
  are synthesized to refold or degrade damaged proteins. 7. DNAJB2 works with HSP70
  to maintain protein homeostasis by refolding proteins or directing damaged ones
  for degradation
