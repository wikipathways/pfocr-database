caption: CDCA biosynthetic and metabolic pathways. In the liver, CDCA are synthesized
  from cholesterol via oxidation catalyzed by CYPs, which occurs in the classical
  and alternative pathways. In the classical pathway, CYP7A1 converts cholesterol
  to 7α-hydroxycholesterol, which is then transformed into CA and CDCA through the
  subsequent actions by CYP8B1 and CYP27A1. The alternative pathway is initiated by
  CYP27A1 and produces CDCA by CYP7B1. Primary BAs CA and CDCA are amidated with glycine
  or taurine to form conjugated bile acids (GCA, GCDCA, TCA and TCDCA) under the actions
  of BACS and BAAT. When secreted into the gut after meals, conjugated bile acids
  are transformed into secondary BAs (LCA and DCA) via biotransformation of GM. Major
  microbial biotransformation reactions include deconjugation mediated by BSH, 7α-dehydroxylation
  and oxidation and epimerization mediated by HSDH. CYP, cytochrome P450; CA, cholic
  acid; GCA, glycocholic acid; GCDCA, glycochenodeoxycholic acid; TCA, taurocholic
  acid; TCDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid; BACS, bile acyl-CoA synthetase; BAAT, bile
  acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase; LCA, lithocholic acid; DCA, deoxycholic acid;
  BSH, bile salt hydrolase.
