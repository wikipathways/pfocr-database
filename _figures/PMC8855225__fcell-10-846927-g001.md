caption: The hedgehog signaling transduction in Drosophila and vertebrates. (A) In
  Drosophila, the 12-span transmembrane protein Ptc represses the GPCR-family protein
  Smo in the absence of Hh ligand, leading to the degradation of Smo by the ubiquitylation
  pathway. Full-length Ci (CiF) forms a complex with the kinesin-like protein Cos2
  and the Ser/Thr kinase Fu, which recruits PKA, GSK3, and CK1 to phosphorylate Ci.
  Phosphorylation of CiF targets it for Slimb-mediated ubiquitination, followed by
  proteasome-mediated proteolysis to generate CiR. Binding of Hh to Ptc releases its
  inhibition of Smo, allowing Smo to be phosphorylated by PKA, CK1 and GRK2. Activated
  Smo not only blocks CiF phosphorylation by PKA/GSK3/CK1 and thus the production
  of CiR but also converts CiF into the activator form (CiA) through activating the
  Fu kinase, which directly phosphorylates CiF to release its inhibition by Sufu.
  (B) Vertebrate Hh signal transduction depends on primary cilia. In the absence of
  Hh, both Ptch1 and Gpr161 (a GPCR coupled to G⍺s) are localized in primary cilia
  where Ptch1 prevents Smo ciliary localization and Gpr161 activates PKA. Full-length
  Gli (GliF; mainly Gli3 and Gli2) is phosphorylated by PKA, GSK3, and CK1, which
  targets it for β-TRCP-mediated ubiquitination, followed by proteasome-mediated proteolysis
  to generate GliR. Binding of Hh to Ptch1 inhibits its activity and promotes its
  ciliary exit, allowing Smo to be phosphorylated by CK1 and GRK2 and accumulated
  in primary cilia. Activated Smo inhibits Ci phosphorylation by PKA and the production
  of GliR in part by promoting Gpr161 ciliary exit. In addition, activated Smo converts
  GliF into GliA at least in part through Ulk3 and STK36, which phosphorylate GliF
  to attenuate the inhibition by Sufu.

  description: The hedgehog signaling transduction in Drosophila and vertebrates.
    (A) In Drosophila, the 12-span transmembrane protein Ptc represses the GPCR-family
    protein Smo in the absence of Hh ligand, leading to the degradation of Smo by
    the ubiquitylation pathway. Full-length Ci (CiF) forms a complex with the kinesin-like

    its inhibition of Smo, allowing Smo to be phosphorylated by PKA, CK1 and GRK2.
    Activated Smo not only blocks CiF phosphorylation by PKA/GSK3/CK1 and thus the
    production of CiR but also converts CiF into the activator form (CiA) through
    activating the Fu kinase, which directly phosphorylates CiF to release its inhibition

    absence of Hh, both Ptch1 and Gpr161 (a GPCR coupled to G⍺s) are localized in
