caption: Regulation of Mef2 is complex. Mef2 expression is induced by myogenin, and
  Mef2 protein induces myogenein and its own expression. Mef2 also regulates genes
  necessary for muscle differentiation and the microRNA miR-1. miR-1, in turn, inhibits
  the histone deacetylase HDAC4 from repressing Mef2, allowing increased Mef2 expression.
  Mef2 also induces HDAC9 and miR-92b, which work to negatively repress Mef2 expression
  and Mef2 activator function, respectively. The upper panel in blue describes known
  Mef2 interactions in other systems. The lower panel in pink highlights a role for
  SmMef2 in the regulation of SmWnt1 and SmWnt2, and in SmMef2 autoregulation in schistosomes
  as described in this report.
