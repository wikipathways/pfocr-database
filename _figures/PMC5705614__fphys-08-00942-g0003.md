caption: Schematic depicting the mechanical regulation of the mammalian Hippo signaling
  pathway. Changes in mechanical tension, shear stress, and cell-cell contact can
  alter YAP and TAZ activity through the F-actin/RHOA/RAC1 axis. Additionally, the
  proteoglycan Agrin modulates YAP and TAZ activity via Integrin/FAK-mediated activation
  of the Hippo core kinases and by modulation of the dystroglyoprotein complex.
