caption: Extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. In the extrinsic pathway,
  Fas ligand or TGF-β binds to its receptor, which is bound by FADD. This activates
  Caspase 8, which activates the effector Caspases 3, 6, and 7. These caspases all
  lead to apoptosis. Caspase 8 also activates Bid, a protein that turns on BAX and
  Bak. The intrinsic pathway also triggers these same proteins by working through
  BH3-only proteins. BAX and Bak increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane,
  releasing Cytochrome C. This protein activates Caspase 9, which activates the same
  effector caspases, causing apoptosis. Bcl-2 inhibits this pathway by blocking the
  activation of BAX and Bak, while IAPs inhibit Caspases 3, 6, 7, and 9.
