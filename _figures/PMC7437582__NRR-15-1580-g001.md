caption: 'Schematic overview of Wnt signaling pathways.(A) In the canonical Wnt pathway,
  the absence of Wnt signal leads to proteasomal degradation of β‐catenin mediated
  by a multiprotein destruction complex including GSK-3β and CK1α kinases, responsible
  of β‐catenin phosphorylation. The binding of the Wnt ligand to its Fz receptor and
  to LRP5/6 co-receptor leads to the recruitment of DVL together with the destruction
  complex to the cell membrane. As a consequence, GSK-3β and CK1α mediated phosphorylation
  of β-catenin is inhibited, and the stabilized β-catenin is translocated to the nucleus
  where it serves as co-activator for Tcf/LEF transcription factors. (B) In the non-canonical
  Wnt/Ca2+signaling pathway, the binding of Wnt ligands to their specific receptors
  activates PLC, leading to intracellular Ca2+ release and the subsequent activation
  of PKC and CaMKII which, in turn, regulate NF-AT transcription factor and gene expression.
  (C) In the non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling pathway, the interaction of Wnt ligand
  with the receptor triggers a signaling cascade that involves small Rho-family GTPases
  and downstream effectors such as JNK and ROCK, which in turn modulate cytoskeleton
  organization and gene expression (modified from Gonzalez-Fernandez et al., 2016a).
