caption: Astrocytes and neuronal activity play distinct, cooperative roles in neuronal
  redox homeostasis. Astrocytes respond to mild oxidative stress and other inducers
  of the Nrf2 pathway by turning on a program of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant gene expression,
  with consequent synthesis of GSH. GSH is exported via Mrp1 and degraded (by Ggt1),
  with one or more degradation products taken up by neurons and fed into their own
  GSH biosynthesis pathway. Thus, while astrocytes provided support in providing the
  building blocks for GSH production, neurons still require the capacity to make use
  of these raw materials. This capacity is controlled by synaptic activity-induced
  signaling pathways, via the transcriptional control of a number of key genes involved
  in GSH synthesis, peroxidation and recycling.
