caption: 'Pathway analysis of the gSkM transcriptome for the comparison of HFD-ED
  and HFD-corn oil fed mice. The illustration is based on the Kegg pathway database
  (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html). (a) Fatty acid β-oxidation: Genes highlighted
  in red are upregulated in gSkM of mice fed HFD-ED compared with HFD-corn oil; (b)
  Electron transport chain: Genes highlighted in red are upregulated in gSkM of mice
  fed HFD-ED compared with HFD-corn oil; (c) Krebs Cycle: Genes highlighted in red
  are upregulated in gSkM of mice fed HFD-ED compared with HFD-corn oil; (d) Relative
  Acc protein levels in HFD-ED (white bars) fed mice was lower than HFD-corn oil (black
  bars) and there was no difference in the phosphorylation of Acc (p-Acc) protein
  after 8-weeks diet intervention. * Different at p < 0.05.'
