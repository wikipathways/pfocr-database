caption: Summary diagram of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3)
  modulation of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway. The lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) activates Stat3 either TLR4 independently or dependently. Activation of Stat3
  inhibits inflammatory and osteogenic changes by decreasing the activity of both
  nuclear factor-KB (NF-κB) and p-38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in aortic
  valve interstitial cells. Activation and inhibition are indicated with arrows and
  blunt-ended arrows, respectively.
