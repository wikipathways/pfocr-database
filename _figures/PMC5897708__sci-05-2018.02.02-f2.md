caption: 'Notch signaling: an emerging therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Diagram—Notch
  receptor activation and therapeutic target in clinical development. Notch signaling
  is initiated by ligand binding to Notch receptor, which undergoes a two-step proteolytic
  cleavage by ADAM family proteases and γ-secretase, releasing the Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD). The NICD translocates to the nucleus where it binds to CSL and converts
  the complex from a repressor to an activator of Notch target genes. Notch signaling
  could be inhibited by two major classes of Notch inhibitors: γ-secretase inhibitors
  and monoclonal antibodies directing against Notch receptors or ligands. Fragment—NEXT,
  Notch extracellular truncated; CSL, C protein binding factor 1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1;
  NEC, Notch extracellular subunit; NTM, Notch transmembrane.'
