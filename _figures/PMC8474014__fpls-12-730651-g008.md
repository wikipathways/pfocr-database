caption: Profile of DEGs involved in photosynthesis and terrapyrrole synthesis pathway.
  (A) DEGs involved in light reaction of photosynthesis. (B) DEGs involved in Calvin
  cycle and photorespiration. (C) DEGs involved in Tetrapyrrole synthesis pathway.
  DEGs were mapped to the photosynthesis diagram according to Log2 fold change (SB/DB).
  Up-regulated DEGs or down-regulated DEGs were shown in red or green, respectively.
  Detailed annotation information of DEGs was shown in .
