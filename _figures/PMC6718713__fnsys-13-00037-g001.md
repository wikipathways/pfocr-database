caption: Microglial signaling pathways determining development of cells with divergent
  abilities. Classical activation of the NF-κB signaling is initiated by TLRs, as
  well as other cell surface receptors, including specific IL-1 and TNF, and provides
  M1 polarization of microglia. PI3K/Akt/mTOR is triggered through the CD74 receptor,
  whose activation is promoted by MIF. There is quite contradictory evidence that
  this pathway affects the shift of the microglia/macrophage phenotype toward M1 or
  M2. Anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4 induce STAT3 and STAT6 phosphorylation,
  respectively, via JAK1, which promotes polarization toward the M2 phenotype. The
  activation of STAT1, in turn, leads to polarization toward a neurotoxic M2 phenotype
  of microglia. Normally, there is a balance between the activation of STAT1 and STAT3/STAT6
  that strictly regulates the microglia polarization and activity.
