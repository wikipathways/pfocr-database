caption: The protein–protein network. The protein–protein interaction (PPI) between
  MMR proteins comprising MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and 22 FA proteins was exported
  from the STRING database (high confidence (0.7)) [] and visualized by using Cytoscape
  software, version 3.8.2 []. The association network shows that FANCS, FANCD1, FANCO,
  and FANCQ are linked with all selected MMR proteins, while FANCM interacts with
  MSH6, MSH2, and MLH1. FANCD2 is connected to MSH2 and MLH1, whereas FANCJ is associated
  with MLH1 and PMS2. The FA proteins without direct association with selected MMR
  proteins have been excluded.
