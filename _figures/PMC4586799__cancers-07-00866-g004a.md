caption: The Hedgehog signaling pathway. (A) The canonical hedgehog signaling components,
  the secreted ligands (Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Indian Hedgehog (Ihh), and Desert Hedgehog
  (Dhh)) and the Patched family hedgehog receptors Patched-1 (Ptch-1) and Patched-2
  (Ptch-2). Both patched receptors antagonize the function of the Smoothened (Smo)
  transmembrane effector protein in the absence of the ligand, therefore inhibiting
  the expression of one or more of the Gli (Glioma-associated oncogene homologue)
  family of transcription factors (Gli-2 or Gli-3) [,,,]. In the absence of ligand,
  Gli is sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding to form a large complex protein with
  the Kinesin-like Costal2 and the serine-threonine kinase Fused [,,,,]; (B) Hedgehog
  signaling can be activated through three known non-canonical pathways, including
  Shh-mediated ERK activation in mammary epithelial cells, Wnt signaling pathway involvement
  in the expression and function of Gli proteins, and the atypical interaction of
  core Hh pathway components with each other [,,].
