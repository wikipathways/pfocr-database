caption: Network analysis of light pathway genes regulated in  but not in phyA-211
  upon prolonged exposure to low /. Light pathway genes regulated in the wild type
  but not in phyA-211 upon prolonged exposure to low / (1 d), extracted from the cluster
  that emerged in the heat map (), were utilized to infer gene networks by means of
  the GeneMANIA server using available genomics and proteomics data. Networks are
  represented as graphs, in which the nodes correspond to genes and the edges correspond
  to interactions between them. Nodes colored with gray show significant differential
  gene expression with respect to the control in our array data (Supplemental Tables
  S3 and S11; for details, see “Materials and Methods”). PPI, Protein-protein interactions.
