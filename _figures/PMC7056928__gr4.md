caption: 'Cholesterol auxotrophic lymphomas accumulate squalene, an antioxidant-like
  metabolite. A) ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALK+ ALCLs) are unable
  to synthesize cholesterol upon the loss of expression of squalene monooxygenase
  (SQLE), which triggers the accumulation of the cholesterol intermediate squalene.
  As a consequence, in order to proliferate, these cancers depend on the uptake of
  cholesterol through the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). B) Mechanisms that
  prevent cellular lipid peroxidation. Certain mevalonate pathway intermediates, such
  as squalene or coenzyme Q, can protect cells from cell death triggered by the peroxidation
  of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Conversely, the functioning of glutathione
  peroxidase 4 (GPX4), the major enzyme involved in detoxification of lipid peroxides,
  depends on the availability of reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. GSH is synthesized
  from three amino acids: glycine, glutamate, and cysteine. Disruption of the uptake
  or utilization of these immediate precursors decreases GSH synthesis and depletes
  the antioxidant capacity of cells.'
