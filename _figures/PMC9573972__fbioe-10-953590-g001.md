caption: Impact of substrate stiffness. (A) Schematic representation of the main changes
  in substrate stiffness and their effects on the corneal epithelium. The central
  region is stiffer than the peripheral region in both the corneal epithelium and
  stroma, and the anterior stroma is stiffer than the posterior stroma. Stiffer substrates
  promote differentiation of limbal epithelial stem cells (LESCs), while softer substrates
  promote the proliferation process. (B) Substrate stiffness affects the behavior
  of LESCs via the YAP-dependent mechanotransduction pathway with involvement of ΔNp63
  and β-catenin. (C) Substrate stiffness and chemical factors influence the behaviors
  of keratocytes. Softer substrates inhibit proliferation of keratocytes and migration
  of fibroblasts. Softer substrates also preserve the phenotype of keratocytes, while
  stiffer substrate promotes keratocyte–fibroblast–myofibroblast (KFM) transformation
  induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). This stiffness-related transformation
  could be suppressed by histone deacetylase inhibitors, hepatocyte growth factor,
  and latrunculin B. Furthermore, extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness also affects
  the response of fibroblasts to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) by the interplay between
  Rho and Rac signaling.

    and migration of fibroblasts. Softer substrates also preserve the phenotype of
    keratocytes, while stiffer substrate promotes keratocyte–fibroblast–myofibroblast
