caption: Diagram of the changes in pathway use in non-metastatic versus metastatic
  CCs, highlighting the metastatic transition and the recapitulation of non-metastatic
  CCs by in vitro conditions and of metastatic CCs by in vivo xenograft conditions.
  WNT-TCF and HH-GLI interactions are highlighted.Model for the proposed role of GLI1
  driving the metastatic transition when its activity levels, enhanced by multiple
  oncogene and loss of tumour suppressor events (the oncogene load), reach a threshold.
  This model recapitulates morphogenetic gradient interpretation resulting in distinct
  cell fates during development. Cancer stem cell reprogramming is proposed to be
  GLI1 driven at the metastatic transition.
