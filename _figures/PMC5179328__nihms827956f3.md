caption: The TLR signaling pathway and ENU-induced mutations that impair TLR-dependent
  TNF or type I IFN secretion. Following receptor activation, the TLRs recruit combinations
  of the adapter proteins MyD88, TICAM-1, TICAM-2, and TIRAP. In the MyD88-dependent
  pathway utilized by all TLRs except TLR3, MyD88 recruits a complex containing the
  IRAK serine kinases, which then recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. TRAF6 adds
  K63-linked polyubiquitin (small white ovals) to itself and to NEMO. The TRAF6 complex
  recruits TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2, and activation of TAK1 leads to activation of MAP
  kinase cascades and the IKK complex. The IKK complex phosphorylates IκB, p105, and
  TPL2, resulting in IκB and p105 ubiquitination and degradation (small pink circles),
  and thereby releasing NF-κB into the nucleus and permitting TPL2 to become activated,
  respectively. Activation of p38, ERK, and JNK kinases leads to CREB and AP1 activation,
  and their subsequent activation of transcription. In plasmacytoid dendritic cells,
  TLR7 and TLR9 activate a pathway resulting in IRF7-dependent production of type
  I IFN. The TICAM-1-dependent pathway is utilized only by TLR3 and TLR4, and activates
  both NF-κB and IRF3 to produce proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFN, respectively.
  In addition, necroptosis may be induced via RIP3 and MLKL. ENU-induced mutations
  (red italics) and the genes they affect (black italics) were identified in our lab
  by forward genetic analysis, first through positional cloning and recently through
  real-time automated genetic mapping.
