caption: Schematic of dopamine postsynaptic signaling pathways. Schematic shows the
  dopamine postsynaptic signaling pathways in cortical neurons. Once combined with
  dopamine released by dopaminergic projections, D1-like receptors stimulate the G
  proteins Gαs and Gαolf, which activates the AC-cAMP-PKA pathway. By contrast, D2-like
  receptors activate Gαi and Gαo proteins, which inhibit AC-cAMP-PKA activation. D2-mediated
  inhibition of AMPAR EPSCs involves inactivation of AC-cAMP-PKA pathway. This pathway
  is activated by D1 signaling to promote upregulation of AMPAR surface expression
  and conductance via phosphorylation. The FMRP interacted with GRK2 and modulated
  D1 signaling pathway. Both the AC-cAMP-PKA pathway and FMRP play significant roles
  in the presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms of chronic pain in pain related cortices.
  When the presynaptic dopamine decreased, the AC-cAMP-PKA pathway would be disinhibited,
  and enhanced the nociceptive transmission. CaM, calmodulin; cAMP, cyclic AMP; CREB,
  cAMP response element-binding protein; FMRP, fragile X mental retardation protein
  (encoded by Fmr1); GRK2, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2; HCN, hyperpolarization-activated
  cyclic nucleotide-gated; L-VGCC, L-type voltage-gated calcium channel; PKA, protein
  kinase A; PKMζ, protein kinase Mζ.
