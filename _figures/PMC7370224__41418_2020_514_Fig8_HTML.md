caption: Hydrophobic triptonide (TN) passes through the cell membrane and directly
  binds to its receptor liver X receptors (LXRα and/or LXRβ), inhibits the transcriptional
  activity of LXRs and reduces the expression of LXR downstream transcription factor
  SREBF1 gene, in turn diminishing SREBF1-downstream PNKP gene expression. The LXRs-SREBF1-PNKP
  signaling axis controls the levels of intracellular DNA single- and double-strand
  breaks (DSBs) and DNA repair in pancreatic cancer (PC) cells. Reduction of the LXRs-SREBF1-PNKP
  axis by triptonide causes a severe defect in DNA repair, marked elevation of intracellular
  DSBs, activation of p53, and induction of PC cell mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis,
  resulting in marked reduction of PC cell tumorigenicity and potent anti-PC effects
  without obvious complications in murine studies.
