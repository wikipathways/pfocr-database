caption: A gene program of neutrophil recruitment and tissue injury based on gene
  expression and in vitro data. Molecules in black text represent those added to the
  pathway based on microarray data, while molecules/genes in blue text have supportive
  inmmunohistochemical and/or in vitro data. Immune complexes and/or mycobacterial
  components may activate FcRs and TLRs to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines such
  as IL-8 and IL-1β. IL-1β in combination with IFN-γ induce E-selectin expression
  on endothelial cells, resulting in the first step of neutrophil recruitment, adhesion
  and rolling along the endothelial wall. These steps are inhibited by thalidomide.
  Neutrophil interaction with ICAM-1 as well as other integrin-mediated activators
  results in arrest and activation. Glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate and
  extracellular proteins such as plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 promote the presentation
  of chemokines such as IL-8 on the surface of the endothelium to mediate neutrophil
  activation and chemotaxis, inhibited by secretory component. As part of the innate
  immune response to microbial infection, the local recruitment of neutrophils may
  lead to tissue injury as host defense pathways are executed.
