caption: '(A) Triglycerides (TAG) are synthetized by lipogenesis in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) by esterification of three fatty acids with one molecule of glycerol.
  Lipids and enzymes (ER panel from left to right): FAs, fatty acids; FA-CoA, fatty-acyl-CoA;
  GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; AGPAT, 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate
  acyltransferase; PA, phosphatidate; PAP-1, phosphatidic acid phosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  DGAT diacylglycerol acyltransferase. (B) Phospholipid synthesis de novo in mammalian
  cells takes place between the endoplasmic reticulum by the cytidine diphosphate
  (CDP)–Kennedy pathway and in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), as discussed
  in the text. Phospholipids and enzymes from upper to bottom panel: P-C, phosphocholine;
  P-E, phosphoethanolamine; Pcyt1, choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; PCyt2,
  ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; PS, phosphatidylserine; PC, phosphatidylcholine;
  PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PSS1, PS synthase-1; PSS2, PS synthase-2; PEMT1, phosphatidylethanolamine
  N(PEN)-methyl transferase; Psid, mitochondrial phosphatidylserine decarboxylase.'
