caption: Induction and subversion of the innate IFN response by HCMV. (A) Sensing
  of HCMV by components of the innate immune response initiates production of IFNs
  and proinflammatory cytokines. HCMV is sensed by PRRs on the cell surface (TLR2)
  and in endosomes (TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9). Signaling from TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 is
  through MyD88 and results in the activation and nuclear translocation NFκB, a transcription
  factor that stimulates expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-8,
  IL-12, and IL-6. TLR9 and TLR4 signal through TRIF which causes activation by phosphorylation
  of IRF3 via TBK1/IKKε, activated IRF3 dimerizes and enters the nucleus to stimulate
  production of type I IFNs. HCMV infection can also be recognized by viral nucleic
  acid detectors in the cytoplasm; DNA sensors ZBP1, IFI16 and cGAS signal through
  ER-resident STING to activate TBK1/IKKε whilst the viral RNA sensor RIG-I activates
  TBK1/IKKε by signaling via MAVS located on the mitochondria or peroxisomes. The
  end result of both of these pathways is IRF3 phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear
  translocation and production of type I IFNs. (B) IFN-dependent and IFN-independent
  pathways of ISG induction during HCMV infection. For IFN-dependent induction of
  ISGs to occur type I, type II and type III IFNs must bind to their cell surface
  receptors. Type I and III IFN receptors signal through various combinations of JAK
  proteins to phosphorylate STAT1 or STAT1 and STAT2 which form a complex referred
  to as ISGF3 with IRF9. ISGF3 then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to
  the ISRE to induce ISG production. The type II IFN receptor utilizes both JAK1 and
  JAK2 to phosphorylate STAT1, leading to its dimerization and nuclear translocation.
  Once in the nucleus, activated STAT1 dimers bind to GAS and stimulate ISG production.
  The three key pathways of HCMV-mediated IFN-independent ISG induction are indicated
  in red. Firstly, HCMV can directly activate IRF3; additionally, HCMV can sequester
  STAT3 and redirect the activated JAK1, created by IL-6 receptor binding, to phosphorylate
  STAT1; and finally peroxisomal MAVS may be able to trigger IFN-independent ISG expression
  at early times following infection. Black line = canonical IFN-dependent ISG induction
  pathway, red line = HCMV-induced, IFN-independent ISG induction pathway.
