caption: Schematic illustrating a range of ncRNAs, encompassing miRNAs, lncRNAs, and
  circRNAs, governing major events within the cell cycleDuring the progression from
  G1 to S, CDK4/6 and cyclin D complexes phosphorylate pocket proteins, such as RB,
  p107, and p130, which release their inhibitory influence on E2F transcription factors,
  including E2F1–3 or activate transcriptional repressors such as E2F4–5. This, in
  turn, induces the transcription of cell-cycle genes such as cyclins A, D, and E,
  promoting G1-S progression. ncRNAs intricately control the expression of CDKs, including
  CDK4 and CDK6; cyclins A, D, and E; and E2Fs to regulate G1-S progression. Additionally,
  positive or negative feedback loops exist where cell-cycle proteins under the regulation
  of ncRNAs control their own transcription by modulating the activity of ncRNAs.
  During the transition from S to M, A-type cyclin levels rise due to E2F-dependent
  transcription and the inhibition of their degradation by the anaphase-promoting
  complex or cyclosome (APC/C). Furthermore, the phosphatase CDC25 dephosphorylates
  CDK1, which associates with A-type or B-type cyclins for activation. CDK1/2 and
  cyclin A/B complexes play pivotal roles in facilitating S to M progression. (A)
  An assortment of ncRNAs regulate the expression of genes involved in various phases
  of the cell cycle by modulating the activity of CDKs, cyclins, and other crucial
  regulators. (B) Several signaling pathways oversee cell-cycle checkpoints, including
  the DNA damage response pathway (G1-S checkpoint) and the SAC pathway (G2/M checkpoint).
  ncRNAs have the capacity to regulate the expression of proteins involved in these
  cell-cycle checkpoint signaling pathways
