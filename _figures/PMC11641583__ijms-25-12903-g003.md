caption: YAP and TAZ interactions with signalling pathways and TFs. EGFR, FGFR2, IL17R,
  and P2RY6 drive YAP and TAZ activation. WNT pathway activation disrupts the cytoplasmic
  YAP sequestration complex, resulting in the release of YAP and β-catenin and their
  nuclear translocation. TGFBR activation transduces the signal to the SMAD2/3 complex,
  which interacts with YAP/TAZ and binds SMAD4 for nuclear shuttling. SMAD7 is a component
  of the cytoplasmic protein complex that suppresses YAP activity. In the nucleus,
  YAP and TAZ are recruited to distant regulatory elements, enhancers and super-enhancers,
  in association with TEADs and AP-1. YAP and TAZ recruit BRD4 and the Mediator complex
  to promote transcription. YAP/TAZ-mediated engagement of the MMB complex initiates
  chromatin looping and transcription of cell cycle-related genes (*). Besides the
  MMB complex, YAP and TAZ could be involved in chromatin remodelling via association
  with the SWI/SNF complex and Hippo-mediated suppression of CTCF activity. LEF/TCF,
  SNAI1/2, SMAD2/3, and ΔNp63 can form transcription complexes with YAP/TAZ, while
  VGLL4 and KLF4 suppress YAP/TAZ-mediated transcription. TAZ can form nuclear condensates
  via LLPS. The FUS protein associates with TAZ in nuclear condensates, maintaining
  their liquid state and thus facilitating TAZ-mediated transcriptional regulation
