caption: Schematic illustration of the ERAD pathway. The first step of ERAD is substrate
  recognition. BiP recognizes and recruits nonglycosylated misfolded or unfolded proteins
  while ER resident lectins recognize glycosylated substrates. Substrate recognition
  is followed by retrotranslocation of substrates from the ER to the cytosol through
  translocon channels. The P97-UFD1-NPL4 complex facilitates the retrotranslocation
  of substrates that bind to P97. This complex serves as a platform for ubiquitination,
  which is carried out by E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzymes, and E3s such as HRD1. The polyubiquitinated protein is then degraded by
  the proteasome in the cytosol. A colored version of the figure is available online.
