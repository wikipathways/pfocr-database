caption: Schematic diagram of PI3K and MAPK cell signaling pathways. Cross-talk of
  PI3K and MAPK pathways influence eventually each other to maintain organ functions
  through moderate expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 ß, IL-6, IL17,
  and TNF-α. During COVID-19 infection, ACE2 receptor interaction may induce the receptor
  signaling. Subsequently, an adaptive immune response initiates through the PI3K,
  thereby increasing MAPK pathway activity and leading to proinflammatory cytokines
  production. ACE2 activation can also induce TLR signaling upon interaction with
  PAMPS, DAMPs, and fungal pathogens resulting in the exaggerated production of proinflammatory
  cytokines (E and F). Across cell membranes, low-dose corticosteroids bind to CRs
  and trigger PI3/Akt signals via downstream MAP kinases to suppress inflammation
  responses (A-D). The steroid binding indeed does interact with FleA, a specific
  receptor site for A. fumigatus and show an inhibitory activity against the entry
  of this fungus into the cell. Long-term and continual administration of high doses
  of corticosteroids in return limit PI3/Akt pathway resulting in the upregulation
  of proinflammatory cytokines but also the robust activation of FleA signaling pathway,
  thereby facilitating the entry of Aspergillus spores into cells (a-d).
