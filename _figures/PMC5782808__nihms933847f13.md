caption: 'While the most reactive exogenous styrenes enabled the desired intermolecular
  radical addition over the competing intramolecular radical addition onto the pendant
  arylsulfonyl group, less reactive radical acceptors like benzofuran required use
  of the N-methanesulfonyl derivative to remove the possibility of intramolecular
  radical cyclization. A surprising effect on enantioselectivity was also observed:
  reaction of N-mesyl-2-allylaniline with 1,1-diphenylethylene gave the carboamination
  adduct in 83% ee while the benzofuran adduct was obtained in 58% ee (). We rationalized
  this by envisioning N–C bond cleavage of the alkyl carbon radical intermediate to
  give an aminyl radical intermediate. Any subsequent ring closure of the resulting
  aminyl radical onto its alkene would give a racemic carbon radical, and this side
  reactivity would be evident in the product enantiomeric excess. The comparatively
  lower reactivity of benzofuran and likely the stability of the arylsulfonyl aminyl
  radical (vide infra) renders the N–C bond-cleavage pathway competitive.'
