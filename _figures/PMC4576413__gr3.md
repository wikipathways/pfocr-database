caption: A. Regulation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1α (HIF-1α).
  HIF-1 is a heterodimer transcription factor that consists of an O2-sensitive α subunit
  and a constitutively expressed β subunit. The level of HIF-1α is determined by the
  relative ratio of its synthesis versus degradation. Under normoxic conditions HIF-1α
  is quickly degraded and exhibits a half-life of just about 5 min. HIF-1α is hydroxylated
  and rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. HIF-1α stability is regulated
  via the activity of a class of oxygen-, 2-oxoglutarate-, and iron-dependent enzymes
  known as prolyl-4-hydroxylases (PDH), which hydroxylate two prolines at locations
  402 or 564. Hydroxylation of HIF-1α created a recognition site VHL, a E3 ubiquitin
  ligase adapter recruits HIF-1α to the VHL-elongin B and C-Cul2 complex. Thus, VHL
  directs ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α. By contrast,
  under oxygen-limiting conditions, HIF-1α is stabilized, and can translocate to the
  nucleus where it dimerizes with HIF-1β and activates transcription of genes containing
  hypoxia response elements (HREs). These genes include those that enhance hypoxia
  tolerance by increasing oxygen delivery to the tissues and anaerobic ATP-generation
  by glycolysis. B, Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a master
  regulator transcription factor of redox homeostasis that functions in association
  with ‘small’ Maf proteins. Under basal redox conditions, NRF2 is localized in cytoplasm
  in association with Kelch ECH associating protein 1 (Keap1) and has a very short
  half life of about 20 min. The Keap1-Cul3-Rbx complex directs polyubiquitination
  of the Nrf2 and its subsequent proteasomal degradation. However, under oxidative
  or electrophilic conditions, specific Cys residues of Keap1 undergo oxidative modification.
  Bound NRF2 is not degraded and newly synthesized NRF2 is able to accumulate, translocate
  to the nucleus and induce the expression of target genes. In the nucleus Nrf2 drives
  the expression of genes containing an enhancer termed Antioxidant Response Element
  (ARE) such NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1, heme oxygenase 1, catalase, CuZn superoxide
  dismutase, glutamate-cysteine ligase, glutathione S-transferases, etc. C, The UPS
  plays also a role in activation of NFκB. According to canonical pathway of NFκB
  activation, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of its inhibitor (IκBα) releases
  NFκB, which now can freely translocate into nucleus. In this way, NFκB can activate
  transcription of genes vital for cellular response to stimuli such as stress, cytokines,
  free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, and bacterial or viral antigens.
