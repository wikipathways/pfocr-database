caption: eIF2Bε Constitutes a Pivotal Node between the Responses to Canonical Stress
  and Sema3ASema3A induces an initial (5 min) wave of local translation independent
  of the eIF2 pathway mediated by ERK-1/2 and mTOR. Simultaneously, eIF2Bε is locally
  translated in an ERK-1/2-mTOR-independent manner. The rapid increase in local protein
  synthesis triggers eIF2α phosphorylation via PERK at 10 min stimulation. Within
  this time course, ERK-1/2 represses GSK-3β and activates PP1, dephosphorylating
  eIF2Bε and increasing eIF2B activity. The engagement of p-eIF2α and increased eIF2B
  GEF activity generates a specific level of ternary complex higher than in the canonical
  stress response, resulting in uORF-independent selective translation of 75 NSPs,
  upregulating global translation. +p, phosphorylation, −p, dephosphorylation, ↑ and
  ↓, axonal translation upregulation and downregulation; dashed lines, indirect activation
  following a rise in local protein synthesis; dotted lines, interaction; dashed circles,
