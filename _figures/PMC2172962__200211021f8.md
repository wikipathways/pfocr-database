caption: Model for recruitment of BMP signals in fate choice decisions. BMP4 causes
  the activation of at least two signaling pathways in neural stem cells. Upon ligand–receptor
  binding, the BMPR receptor complex releases FKBP12 and activates SMAD proteins,
  resulting in smooth muscle differentiation. The released FKBP12 may bind with rapamycin
  to inhibit FRAP or may act in some modified form to activate FRAP. FRAP then catalyzes
  serine phosphorylation (S*) of STAT to augment its prior activation by tyrosine
  phosphorylation (Y*) by another signal. High cell density (described in text) acts
  to promote basal STAT activation and DNA binding by an unknown signaling mechanism.
  This enhanced activation of STAT (Y*S*) causes efficient glial differentiation.
  Levels of activated STAT proteins in the cell dictate whether the STAT or SMAD signal
  acquires precedence in the fate choice between smooth muscle and glia.
