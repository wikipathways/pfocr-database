caption: The ERK signaling pathway. (A) shows that high doses of arsenic for a short
  period of time enhances Ras, Raf, MEK and ERK phosphorylation in normal cells, thereby
  the activated ERK translocates from cytoplasm into nucleus, increases levels of
  Bax protein, decreases levels of Bcl-2 protein and cleaves caspase-3, contributing
  to cell apoptosis. (B) indicates that, in cancer cells, low dose arsenic intervention
  for long period of time suppresses phosphorylation of Ras, Raf, MEK and ERK, blocking
  ERK translocation from cytoplasm into nucleus, thereby increases levels of Bax protein,
  decreases levels of Bcl-2 protein and cleaves caspase-3, contributing to cell apoptosis.
  ERK, extracellular signal-regulated MAP kinases; MEK, mitogen-induced extracellular
  kinase; p-ERK, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Raf, serine/threonine-specific
  protein kinases; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 protein; Bax, Bcl-associated
  X protein; caspase-3, cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease-3; RTKs, receptor tyrosine
  kinases.
