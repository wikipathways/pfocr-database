caption: On the left side, the C1 metabolism is shown comprising the putatively redox-regulated
  proteins SAMS and SAHH identified in the present work. OAT, which is also suggested
  as being redox-sensitive, is involved in the formation of ornithine, an important
  precursor for polyamine synthesis, which is shown on the right side. The trans-sulfuration
  pathway from homocysteine to cysteine has not been included in the figure. See text
  for details.
