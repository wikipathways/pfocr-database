caption: (A) The effects of adipogenic stimulants on adipogenesis. IBMX and dexamethasone
  induce expression of lipid synthesis enzymes. Insulin activates kinase signaling
  pathway leading to glucose import. A product of glycolysis, acetyl CoA, serves as
  a substrate for lipid synthesis enzymes. Akt kinase activates expression of insulin
  degradation enzyme (IDE) which allows recycling of surface insulin receptor. (B)
  3T3-L1 cells as single computing units. Inputs are defined as IBMX/dexamethasone,
  insulin, and glucose. Signal processing is defined as cellular activities induced
  by input signals which include adipogenic gene expression, insulin signaling, and
  insulin-stimulated glucose import. Output is defined as intracellular lipid droplets
  formation.
