caption: 'Mechanistic studies. Mechanistic studies involving the use of a labelled
  additive and a labelled substrate are shown. a, Reaction with SmI2–D2O resulted
  in the formation of deuterated product D2-7a. This observation supports the operation
  of the extended SET mechanistic pathway when 1,5-HAT in V is not possible. Treatment
  of substrate 6d with SmI2–D2O resulted in the formation of non-deuterated product
  7d. This reaction outcome supports the operation of a mechanism involving activation
  of a secondary alkyl group by 1,5-HAT. b, Use of deuterated substrate D-6d in the
  reaction resulted in the formation of products 7p and 7q (product D-7d was not formed):
  The presence of deuterium in D-6d blocked 1,5-HAT and redirected folding'
