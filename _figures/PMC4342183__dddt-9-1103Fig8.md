caption: 'VEGF signaling pathway in the target list of hsa-miR-181a-5p based on miRTarBase
  4.0.Notes: hsa-miR-181a-5p can regulate the VEGF signaling pathway. VEGF is an important
  signaling protein involved in both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. All members
  of the VEGF family stimulate cellular responses by binding to tyrosine kinase receptors
  (the VEGFRs) on the cell surface, causing them to dimerize and become activated
  through transphosphorylation. This triggers a signaling cascade that activates several
  signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt, Erk1/2, Smad, and Notch, and results in endothelial
  cell proliferation and migration. A number of studies have shown that VEGF and its
  associated proteins are aberrant in EC.– These proteins represent useful targets
  in the treatment of EC.Abbreviations: EC, endometrial cancer; VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor.'
