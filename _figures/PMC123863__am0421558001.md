caption: Internal metabolic fluxes of TMB3001 (ZWF1) and of TMB3255 (Δzwf1) (bold)
  in chemostat cultures at a dilution rate of 0.06 h−1 (upper value of each pair)
  and 0.12 h−1 (lower value) with a feed containing 20 g of xylose liter−1 and 20
  g of glucose liter−1. TMB3001 has a wild-type level of G6PDH. TMB3255 is deficient
  in G6PDH. All fluxes are normalized to a total specific sugar consumption of 100
  mmol per g (dry weight) of cells per h. Substances shown inside boxes are substrates
  or products excreted into the medium. P, phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate;
  G-3-P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
