caption: Schematic sagittal section of the brain indicating proposed pathways mediating
  responses to plasma Ang II and CSF [Na+]. An increase in plasma Ang II or CSF [Na+]
  enhances neuronal activity in the SFO and OVLT, and this increased activity is relayed
  to the MnPO and subsequently, to the PVN, leading to increased Ang II release in
  the PVN (top panel). Enhanced angiotensinergic signaling in the PVN decreases local
  GABA release and increases local glutamate release. Increased neuronal activity
  in the PVN is relayed to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), activating a
  similar angiotensinergic signaling pathway. Chronically, increased neuronal activity
  in the SFO and OVLT is also relayed to the SON, enhancing aldosterone production
  in magnocellular neurons (bottom panel). Aldosterone release increases production
  of EO by magnocellular neurons in the SON/mPVN. EO in the pPVN enhances angiotensinergic
  signaling, further increasing and maintaining sympathetic hyperactivity. The clear
  area represents the 3rd ventricle filled with CSF. Dotted arrows represent angiotensinergic
  or glutamatergic excitatory projections. IML, intermediolateral cell column; SNA,
  sympathetic nerve activity; BP, blood pressure.
