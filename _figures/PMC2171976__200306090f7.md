caption: Scheme of proposed tumor cell signaling network to control polarity, proliferation,
  and apoptosis. T4-2 signaling network. PI3K activity is increased in tumor cells
  as a result of aberrant signaling from cell–ECM and cell–growth factor receptor
  interactions. The consequent activation of Akt contributes to the increased cellular
  proliferation through downstream pro-proliferation and anti-apoptotic pathways.
  Increased PIP3 also leads to up-regulation of Rac1 through activation of Rac1-specific
  GEF activity, resulting in altered organization of the actin cytoskeleton, formation
  and maintenance of tight junctions, and directionality of vesicle trafficking, effects
  that combine to disorganize the tissue structure. Thus, each pathway independently
  affects cellular behavior, but the synergistic effect leads to the tumor phenotype.
  (★) Cross-modulation in 3D lrBM. Inhibition at any of these pressure points results
  in normalization of the expression and activity at each of the other points, with
  concomitant normalization of downstream signaling pathways.

  downstream of PI3-kinase in breast epithelial tumor cells.
