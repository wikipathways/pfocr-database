caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathways leading to signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation. Increased levels (indicated
  by red arrows) of IL-6, IL-10, IL-11, VEGF, EGFR, TGF-β, JAK, Abl, or Src lead to
  an increase in the rate of phosphorylated form of STAT3 protein (marked with P)-P-STAT3.
  Moreover, increasing the intracellular JAK level activates the mTOR pathway, which
  can increase the level of STAT3 dimerization both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus.
  Upregulated pSTAT3 levels can lead to increased expression of genes encoding anti-apoptotic
  proteins, cell cycle regulators, or angiogenic factors. All of this, as a consequence,
  can induce the formation of neoplastic cells [,,,].
