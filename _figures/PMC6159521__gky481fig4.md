caption: Schematic drawing of the asymmetric specificity of the EndoMS-dependent MMR
  system and asymmetric occurrence of replication errors. The origin of transition
  mutations was considered (G:C → A:T transitions; upper panel and A:T → G:C transitions;
  lower panel). The cases of C → T and A → G mutations in the leading strand are shown
  on the left side, and the cases of G → A and T → C mutations in the leading strand
  side are shown on the right side. Possible replication errors (mismatches) leading
  to each mutation during lagging (Lg)- and leading (Ld)-strand synthesis are shown
  in the upper and lower parts of each panel, respectively. The direction of DNA synthesis
  is indicated by a red arrow, and the nascent strand is indicated by red letters.
  Replication errors targeted by EndoMS-dependent pathway are indicated by a green
  box.
