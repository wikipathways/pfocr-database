caption: A) Schematic of a cell within a Ds gradient. Characterization of Fat staining
  in discs with clones of cells mutant for or over-expressing Ds indicates that localization
  of Fat at the membrane can be influenced by the levels of Ds in neighboring cells.
  Since every cell in a Ds gradient sees more Ds on one side than it does on the other,
  we suggest that Fat protein could be asymmetrically localized (as indicated). Alternatively,
  Fat might be uniformly localized but asymmetrically activated. If this asymmetric
  localization or activity influenced Fat and Ds in neighboring cells, then the asymmetry
  could be propagated through local cell-cell interactions. The asymmetric localization
  and/or activity of Fat within a cell results in asymmetric localization of Dachs
  to the membrane ()(). We suggest that where Dachs can accumulate at the membrane,
  it locally promotes the degradation and inactivation of Warts (; ). We further suggest
  that Warts locally inhibits the activity of its substrate, Yki (), but where Warts
  is absent active Yki can be produced, which would then enter the nucleus (arrow)
  and regulate gene expression to promote growth (; ). A transcriptional signal in
  this context is thus generated from a side of cell opposite to where Fat and Ds
  are engaged. B) When Ds is uniformly expressed, active Fat would be localized to
  the membrane around the entire circumference of the cell, where it would antagonize
  the localization of Dachs to the membrane (). This in turn would allow accumulation
  of active Warts, and consequently increase inhibition of Yki. C) In the absence
  of Ds or Fat, Dachs would accumulate at the membrane around the entire circumference
  of the cell, resulting in uniformly low levels of active Warts, and thereby allowing
  more Yki to enter the nucleus. By modulating Fat-Ds interactions, a gradient of
  Four-jointed (not shown) could establish a gradient of Ds-Fat binding activity even
  under conditions where Ds expression is relatively uniform.
