caption: 'The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway: Upon growth factor (GF) activation RTKs auto‐phosphorylate
  and recruit the SH2 domain‐containing GRB2, which interacts with the guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor SOS that induces release of GDP from RAS, which subsequently binds
  GTP. RAS recruits RAF to the membrane. Active RAF then acts on MEK dual specificity
  kinase that phosphorylates ERK on both threonine and tyrosine residues. The dimerized
  form of ERK exerts a variety of post‐transcriptional but also nuclear effects by
  phosphorylation of transcription factors. The RAS/ERK pathway is tightly regulated.
  Several phosphatases including PP2A and DUSPs inactivate ERK in the cytoplasm or
  nucleus. Furthermore, endogenous modulators such as SPRY, SPRED, or SEF inhibit
  ERK signaling upstream and downstream of RAS. Activating drugs such as FK506, ALCAR,
  or Geldanamycin enhance ERK signaling. Increased pERK levels promote peripheral
  axon regeneration and neuronal survival but inhibit excitotoxicity. Downregulation
  of ERK inhibitors such as SPRY2 or treatment with ERK activators like FK506 has
  been demonstrated to promote peripheral nerve regeneration as well.'
