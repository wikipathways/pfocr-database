  aeruginosa. A, under iron-depleted conditions, PrrF  represses antABC and catABC,
  sparing anthranilate for PQS  synthesis. The repression of antA by PrrF may occur
  by direct  interaction with the antA mRNA and indirectly via degradation of the  antR
  mRNA. Iron also activates expression of antR, leading  to activation of antA, by
  an unknown, PrrF-independent, mechanism.  Iron may also activate expression of genes
  encoding enzymes in the kynurenine  pathway, providing anthranilate for PQS production
  under high iron conditions.  TCA, tricarboxylic acid. B, AntR, an AraC-type regulator,  activates
  expression of antR, antABC, and possibly catBCA.  Anthranilate increases the ability
  of AntR to bind to the antA  promoter and activates expression of antR and antABC.  Quorum-sensing
  regulators (QscR, LasR, RhlR, and PqsR) also coordinate the  expression of antR
  and antABC.
