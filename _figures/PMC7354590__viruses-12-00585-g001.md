caption: Polyomavirus life cycle and extracellular vesicle formation. Polyomavirus
  (PyV) infection starts with receptor-mediated interactions with specific receptors
  (1). Then, receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs mainly by internalization through
  caveosomes that traffic through the cytoplasm using a microtubule network to the
  late endosome before being delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (2–3). JCPyV
  is internalized through clathrin-coated vesicles. In the ER, virions benefit from
  chaperones, disulfide isomerases, and reductases, which facilitate partial capsid
  uncoating (3). The viral genome is then transported into the nucleus via the nuclear
  pore complex (4). Expression of early genes occurs, and the proteins are translocated
  into the nucleus, where they serve to initiate viral DNA replication (5–6). Late
  genes are then expressed (7). Late proteins are translocated into the nucleus, where
  they self-assemble to form capsids into which newly synthetized viral DNA is packaged
  (8). During viral expression, PyVs also encode microRNAs involved in the regulation
  of early viral gene expression and target host factors. Progeny virions are mainly
  released from infected cells after cell lysis (9). However, a small fraction of
  progeny virions may also be released into the extracellular environment through
  nonlytic egress, which depends on the cellular secretion pathway generating extracellular
  vesicles (10). EVs are formed either (a–b) as early endosomes that accumulate intraluminal
  vesicles within the lumen of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that fuse with the plasma
  membrane to release exosomes or (c) by budding of the plasma membrane (microvesicles).
  Early endosomes can fuse with lysosome to fulfill the degradation pathway (d).
