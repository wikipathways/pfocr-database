caption: CircRNAs in immune responses. Exogenous circRNAs can activate the RIG-1 cellular
  immune response pathway to suppress viral replication. The immune factor NF90/NF110
  can promote circRNA formation by stabilizing the intron complementary sequence.
  Under viral infection, NF90/NF110 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
  to inhibit virus replication. Meanwhile, circRNA expression in the nucleus is decreased.
  Thus, endogenous circRNAs can be used as “molecular indicators” of antiviral proteins
  to prompt antiviral immune responses. circRNAs can also function as “microRNA sponges”
  to increase expression of target proteins involved in antiviral responses or tumor
  immunity, such as PD-L1. mcircRasGEF1B can help to protect cells from bacterial
  infection by enhancing the stability of mature ICAM-1 mRNA. In addition, circRNAs
  can be involved in immune responses by interacting with proteins or their host genes.
