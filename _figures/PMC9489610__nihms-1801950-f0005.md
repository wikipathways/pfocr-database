caption: '(A) Triggers of necroptosis in the context of ALS include aggregated proteins
  such as TDP-43 and mutant SOD1 (ALS), as well as mutations in negative repressors
  of the RIPK1 pathway such as optineurin (OPTN) and TBK1. There is evidence to suggest
  (B) neurons, astrocytes and microglia undergo necroptosis in the context of ALS.
  However, the strongest evidence points to (C) oligodendrocytes as the chief cells
  executing necroptosis in ALS. Stimulation of TNFR1 by TNF promotes the formation
  of an intracellular signaling complex where the death domains (DD) of trimerized
  TNFR1 binds the DD-containing proteins: TRADD and receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
  kinase 1 (RIPK1). TRADD helps to recruit a number of RIPK1 regulators, including
  OPTN and TBK1. In situations of caspase-8 down regulation or inhibition, RIPK1 is
  auto phosphorylated and dimerizes via its C-terminal death domain. This dimerization
  promotes RIPK3 activation and the subsequent formation of the necrosome (complex
  IIb) comprised of RIPK1, FADD, Casp8, RIPK3 and mixed-lineage kinase domain-like
  pseudokinase (MLKL). (D) This complex enables (i) p-MLKL to insert and oligomerize
  in plasma membrane and iii) execute overt necroptotic cell death. As in other forms
  of programmed necrosis, release of DAMPs and intracellular contents serves to recruit
  and activate peripheral immune cells and promote gliosis. In the case of necroptosis
  in oligodendrocytes, this leads to demyelination and perhaps contributing to the
  progressive axon loss observed in ALS.'
