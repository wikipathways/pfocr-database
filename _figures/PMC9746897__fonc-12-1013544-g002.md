caption: 'Molecular mechanism of gasdermins-mediated pyroptosis. In classical pathway,
  PAMPs and DAMPs are recognized by various stimuli and then activate conformational
  change of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and NLRP3 recruits ASC and binds to pro-caspase-1
  to form NLRP3- ASC-pro-caspase-1 protein complex, which then cleaves pro-caspase-1
  into caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 destroys the intramolecular auto-inhibitory
  structure of GSDMD by cleaving GSDMD, which promotes GSDMD-NT generation and induces
  pyroptosis. Caspase-1 can also recognize and catalyze pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, leading
  to maturation of IL-1β, IL-18. In the noncanonical pathway, caspase-4/5/11 are recognized
  by LPS from Gram-negative bacteria in the cytoplasm, which then lead to pyroptosis
  by cleaving GSDMD. Inhibiting TAK1 can stimulate the activation of caspase-8, which
  cleaves GSDMD and causes pyroptosis. An elastase and cathepsin G can also cleave
  GSDMD and activates pyroptosis. ESCRT-III complex repairs the membrane by removing
  the GSDMD pore through exocytosis. Caspase-3, caspase-7 and enterovirus 71 3C cleave
  the GSDMD and generate a nonfunctional N-terminus. Under the action of chemotherapy,
  radiation and GzmB, caspase-3 was activated and cleaves GSDME to liberate the cytotoxic
  N-GSDME, inducing pyroptosis. 2-BP can reverse caspase-3/GSDME-mediated pyroptosis.
  In addition, GSDMB is cleaved by GzmA, while under hypoxia conditions, GSDMC is
  cleaved by TNFα-activated-caspase-8 and transcriptionally upregulated through pSTAT3
  interaction with PD-L1. SpeB directly activates GSDMA and induce pyroptosis. Abbreviations:
  DAMPs, danger-associated molecular patterns; PAMPs, pathogen associated molecular
