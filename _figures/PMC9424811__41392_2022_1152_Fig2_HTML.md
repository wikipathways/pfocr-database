caption: RNF proteins regulate the TLR signaling pathway. TLRs locate at both plasma
  membrane and endosomes. TLRs sense different ligands like viral nucleic acids and
  viral envelope glycoproteins and recruit TRIF and MyD88 to transduce signals, ultimately
  activating IRFs and NF-κB to product IFN-I and proinflammatory cytokines. RNF proteins
  positively (green arrows) or negatively (red T-shaped solid line) regulate multiple
  steps downstream of the TLR signaling pathway. P, phosphate
