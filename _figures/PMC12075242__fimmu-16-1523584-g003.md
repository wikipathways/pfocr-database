caption: ETBF promotes tumorigenesis by distinct mechanisms. BFT can activate the
  STAT3 and NF-κB pathways, increasing the production of cytokines IL-17A and IL-8,
  thereby creating a pro-inflammatory environment. ETBF can upregulate JMJD2B levels
  in the TLR4-NFAT5-dependent pathway. JMJD2B regulates the stemness of tumor cells
  by enhancing NANOG expression through demethylation. ETBF can also promote cancer
  progression by downregulating miR-149-3p through METTL14 methylation. On one hand,
  it facilitates the differentiation of Th17 cells via exosomes; on the other hand,
  it further promotes the RNA selective splicing of KAT2A mediated by PHF5A
