caption: 'The extrinsic coagulation pathway. Tissue Factor (TF), the main initiator
  of the coagulation cascade, complexes with Factor VIIa to activate Factor X, and
  in turn converts prothrombin (PT) to thrombin (Th) and ultimately fibrinogen to
  fibrin, with subsequent clot formation. FXa is inhibited by the direct oral anticoagulant
  Rivaroxaban. Thrombin also binds to protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1), and the
  TF/FVIIa/Xa complex to PAR-2. In cancer cells, this is proposed to result in pro-angiogenic,
  pro-proliferative and pro-invasive gene expression resulting in increased metastases.
