caption: 'Synergistic effect of cyclopamine and rapamycin. C57BL/6N hepatocytes were
  treated with cyclopamine and/or rapamycin for 24 h. The treatment with cyclopamine
  had no effect on mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling, whereas the
  treatment with rapamycin had weak inhibitory effects on p70S6 downstream signalling
  and mitochondrial respiration. However, the simultaneous treatment with cyclopamine
  and rapamycin exhibited strong inhibitory effects on p70S6 downstream signalling
  as well as mitochondrial respiration, revealing an impact of Hh signalling on the
  mTOR pathway. SMO: Smoothened, PTCH: Patched, CK1: Casein kinase 1, FU: Fused, SUFU:
