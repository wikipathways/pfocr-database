caption: 'Platelet receptor/signaling and COVID-19. Low platelet level in some patients
  with COVID-19 can be due to massively activated platelets. Platelets contain alpha,
  delta, T, and lysosomal granules. VAMPs may mediate platelet endocytosis. Fibrinogen
  normally imports into the platelet α-granules and is fused with vWF. Platelets have
  various receptors: integrins; GP Ib/IX/V; TLRs; thrombin receptors of PAR-1 and
  PAR-4; ADP receptor of P2Y12; GPVI. In viral infections, TLRs are activated that
  cause the secretion of complement C3 from alpha granules in platelets. They also
  release GM-CSF. Complement C3 and GM-CSF stimulate NETosis. SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis
  indirectly induces an enhanced capability of VWF to bind to its receptors on platelets.
  VWF binds to GPIb-IX-induced transient platelet adhesion. Thrombin is another ligand
  for GPIb-IX. It stimulates the PKG and MAPK pathway and, ultimately, granule secretion.
  GPVI is known as a collagen receptor. In this pathway, PIP2 hydrolyzes into DAG
  and IP3 by PLC2 mediation. DAG and IP3 are known as secondary messengers. DAG activates
  PKC isoforms. PKCs are involved in integrin activation and platelet granule secretion.
  IP3 increases calcium concentration in cytosol of cells by affecting the dense tubular
  system channel. Calcium elevation is also required for stable platelet adhesion,
  granule secretion, procoagulant activity, and clot retraction and collectively almost
  all platelet functions. PAMPs and DAMPs (such as HMGB1) bind to PRRs, such as TLRs.
  They prompt platelet activation. TLRs activate PLC2. They also activate the PKG
  pathway. Minimally three thrombin receptors on human platelet surface have been
  defined, i.e., GPIb-IX, PAR1, and PAR4. GPIb-IX signaling plays a pivotal role in
  the assembly of NOX subunits and ROS production. It can also activate PLC through
  a ROS-mediated signaling pathway. Then, PLC activation leads to DAG and IP3 formation,
  which has already been described. PAR1 and PAR4 also activate PLC isozymes and have
  an effect on the PKG and MAPK pathway. Integrins are also important platelet molecules
  involved in platelet activity, adhesion, and aggregation, including collagen, fibronectin,
  etc. They are substantial for the stable adhesion and aggregation of platelets.
