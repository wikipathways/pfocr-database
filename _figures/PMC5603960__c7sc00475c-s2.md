caption: '. Proposed biosynthetic pathway for MonAzPs in M. ruber M7. Yellow pigments:
  1, 2, 7–10, 13–17, 19–25, 29, 30, and 33–35. Orange pigments: 3, and 4. Red pigments:
  5, 6, and 36. 36 is a model for amino acid derivatives of red MonAzPs. The spectral
  data is kept in ESI Sections 6 and 9. 12, 18, and 26–28 are too reactive to isolate,
  whereas other compounds in square brackets were detected by MS but were not present
  in high enough concentration for NMR analysis. The main MonAzPs pathway is emphasized
  with bold arrows. Shunt pathways that contribute to the diversity of yellow pigments
  are boxed in color. See text for abbreviations. Red atoms and bonds indicate the
  chemical changes.'
