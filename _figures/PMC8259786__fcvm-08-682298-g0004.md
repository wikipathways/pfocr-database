caption: NOTCH signaling in aortic valve homeostasis and CAVD. RUNX2 is a key regulator
  of osteogenesis, as well as hallmark of CAVD progression. NOTCH represses the transcription
  of Runx2 mediated by HEY proteins. NOTCH also represses the expression of Bmp2 and
  BMP2-regulated osteoblast-like calcification pathway. Inhibition of NOTCH leads
  to calcification via a Sox9-dependent manner. Conversely, matrix Gla protein MGP
  suppresses the calcification of soft tissue through antagonizing the BMP signaling.
  NOTCH positively regulates the transcription of MGP. In human iPSC studies, NOTCH1
  haploinsufficiency causes gene network change involved in osteogenesis, inflammation,
  and oxidative stress through an epigenetic mechanism, which can be reversed by a
  small molecule XCT790. The XCT790 treatment can slow down calcification in the human
  iPSCs and a mouse model of CAVD.
