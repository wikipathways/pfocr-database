caption: Mechanisms underlying the regulation of signaling pathways. Cellular responses
  to a specific ligand (e.g., ligand A) result in changes of the gene expression program.
  Some of the products of ligand A–inducible genes might be capable of inhibiting
  the signaling cascade via negative feedback (exemplified by cytokine-mediated induction
  of tyrosine phosphatases of JAK inhibitors and denoted by a blue solid arrow). However,
  a much more rapid regulation of signaling can occur due to the branching of signaling
  pathways. In this example, “stem” signaling induced by ligand A includes activation
  of receptor A1 followed by activation of a signaling element A2. Subsequent “forward”
  signaling involves activation of A3 and other elements that lead to transcription
  changes. Concurrently, eliminative signaling (involving A2-dependent activation
  of a factor X and effect of X on receptor downregulation denoted by a solid red
  arrow) results in rapid downregulation and degradation of A1, thereby restricting
  the duration and magnitude of cellular responses to ligand A. This pathway could
  be employed by an unrelated signaling pathway via “cross”-signaling initiated by
  ligand B, which can lower the sensitivity of the cell to ligand A via activation
  of factor X.
