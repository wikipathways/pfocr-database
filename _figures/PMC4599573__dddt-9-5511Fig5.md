caption: 'PLB regulates death receptor signaling in SCC25 cells.Notes: SCC25 cells
  were treated with 5 μM PLB for 24 hours and the protein samples were subject to
  quantitative proteomic analysis. Red indicates upregulation; green indicates downregulation.
  The intensity of green and red molecule colors indicates the degree of down- or
  upregulation, respectively. Solid arrows indicate direct interaction and dashed
  arrows indicate indirect interaction. The arrow with white head indicates translocation.
  The arrow with gray head indicates activation, causation, expression, localization,
  membership, modification, molecular cleavage, phosphorylation, protein-DNA interactions,
  protein-RNA interactions, regulation of binding, transcription.Abbreviation: PLB,
  plumbagin.'
