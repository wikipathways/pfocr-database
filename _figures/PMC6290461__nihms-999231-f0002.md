caption: An overview of DNA repair pathways that are impaired in premature ageing
  syndromes, ageing and ageing-associated diseases. Thin arrows indicate the DNA repair
  proteins that are impaired specifically in Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome
  (HGPS). Double-strand breaks are either repaired by homologous recombination through
  RAD51-mediated repair using the sister chromosome as a template, or X-ray repair
  cross-complementing protein 6 (XRCC6)- and DNA protein kinase catalytic subunit
  (PKcs)-mediated non-homologous end joining of the broken ends. Poly(ADP-ribose)
  polymerase 1 (PARP1) promotes ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent DNA
  damage signalling activation. In nucleotide excision repair, bulky DNA adducts are
  excised, and the resulting single-strand DNA breaks are repaired by the indicated
  proteins. The final step of repair for each repair pathway includes DNA ligase-mediated
  joining of the DNA strands at the breakage point. PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear
  antigen.
