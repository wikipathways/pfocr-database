caption: 'Application of nanotechnology in MS and KOA treatment targeting TRPA1 inhibition.
  (a) The use of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) to deliver anti-inflammatory drugs
  with poor bioavailability could improve drug stability and delivery, potentially
  enabling effective MS treatment to prevent demyelination by inhibiting the TRPA1/NF-kB/GFAP
  signaling pathway.; (b) Nanoemulsion (SP-NE) with excellent stability, manufactured
  by extracting essential oil from pickling powder, a herbal medicine for KOA, through
  a high-pressure homogenization process, alleviates KOA synovitis by negatively regulating
  TRPA1 through AMPK-mTOR signaling. Red arrows: Pathway of disease suppression by
  nanoparticles, blue arrows: Pathway of disease development by TRPA1 activation'
