caption: Proposed model for CaSR activation of NCC through a PKC-WNK4-SPAK pathway.
  Increased extracellular Ca2+ leads to CaSR-mediated inhibition of NKCC2 and ROMK,
  halting the transepithelial voltage difference that drags paracellular reabsorption
  of Ca2+ ions. Reduction in Ca2+ reabsorption in the TALH causes increased NaCl and
  Ca2+ delivery to the distal nephron. In the DCT, integration of calcium and NaCl
  homeostasis by the CaSR must respond to prevent unwanted NaCl loss. We propose the
  existence of a mechanism in the DCT where apically expressed CaSR responds to increased
  intratubular Ca2+ concentration, evoking a CaSR-Gαq-PKC-WNK4 signaling transduction
  pathway that promotes NCC activation. Cln-14/16, Claudin 14 and 16 heterodimers.
