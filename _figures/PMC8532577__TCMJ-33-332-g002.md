caption: 'A lot of metastatic factors and cytokines secreted in the tumor microenvironment
  can trigger various metastatic signal pathways most of them can be suppressed by
  Raf kinase inhibitory protein via associating with upstream signal molecules as
  indicated. According to what has been observed in the tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate-triggered
  pathway that activates mitogen-activated protein kinase through mitochondria reactive
  oxygen species-mediated heat shock protein 60 oxidation, Raf kinase inhibitory protein
  may be released upon oxidation of critical upstream signal molecules resulting in
  reactivation of downstream signaling for tumor progression. Solid lines: established
  pathway. Dashed line: a proposed pathway'
