caption: 'Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling in schistosome gonads. (A) Following
  activation by their respective ligands, schistosome RTKs (EGF-R, IR, FGF-R, and
  VKR) expressed in gonads can induce protein synthesis, cell growth and proliferation
  by activating the PI3K/Akt/S6K and Erk MAPK pathways. VKR activation was shown to
  also activate the Jnk MAPK pathway, potentially involved in oocyte migration. (B)
  Morphology of the reproductive organs of S. mansoni females is affected by dsSmvkr
  RNA interference. Worms were treated with control irrelevant (A) or dsSmvkr (B)
  dsRNAs (as described in ). Whole-mount preparations were stained with carmine red
  and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. In control worms (a), we observe
  immature oocytes (io) within the smaller, anterior part of the ovary and big and
  mature oocytes (mo) in the posterior part. The ootype (ot) contains a viable egg
  formed by one oocyte and vitelline cells. Treatment with dsSmvkr (b) induced a strong
  disorganization and size reduction of the ovary, as well as the abortion of egg
  formation. Scale bar: 20 μm.'
