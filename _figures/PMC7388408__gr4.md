caption: Amino acid metabolic pathways in immune cells. Amino acids and their metabolism
  play a vital role in immune function. Glutamine has been demonstrated to be necessary
  for IL-1 induction upon LPS stimulation. Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), is responsible
  for tryptophan catabolism through General control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2). The
  arginine pathway is mainly modulated by Arg-degrading enzymes such as NO synthase.
