caption: Fig. 8. A working hypothesis for PrPSc-induced apoptosis in neuronal cells.
  Interaction of PrPSc with an unknown receptor protein activates a signaling pathway,
  which induces the release of calcium from the ER and ER-stress, as evidenced by
  the up-regulation of ER chaperones (i.e. Grp58, Grp78 and/or Grp94). ER-stress leads
  to activation of caspase 12, which in turn cleaves and activates the executioner
  caspase-3, leading to apoptosis.
