caption: 'Conceptual diagram of the effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and methyl-β-cyclodextrin
  (MβCD) on pigments and terpenes biosynthesis in C. reinhardtii UVM4, based on the
  results of this study. Ergosterol and 7-dehydroporiferasterol are the predominant
  sterols in the cell membrane of C. reinhardtii []. The cell wall is not shown as
  the strain UVM4 is cell-wall deficient. Triterpenes biosynthesis occurs in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). In plants, MeJA triggers a transcriptional re-arrangement in the
  nucleus, which then starts a coordinated transcriptional response leading to an
  up-regulation of the MEP pathway and an oxidative stress. A similar response has
  been observed in C. reinhardtii, although it lacks orthologs of key genes involved
  in MeJA signaling in plants []. The red and blue arrows indicate an increase and
  decrease in metabolites abundance compared to untreated cells, respectively. Dashed
  arrows indicate multiple enzymatic steps. MEP: 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate;
  ROS: reactive oxygen species; Chl: chlorophyll; FPP: farnesyl diphosphate.'
