caption: The signaling protein BMP4 (green) is secreted either as a homodimer made
  up of two identical BMP4 proteins, or a heterodimer comprised of BMP4 and another
  BMP protein, such as BMP7 (pink; top left panel). An enzyme called FAM20C (blue)
  adds a phosphoryl group (yellow circle) to the prodomain of BMP4 before it is secreted
  (top right panel). However, two mutations associated with development defects –
  S91C and E93G – block this phosphorylation (indicated by a red marker), leading
  to disruptions in the BMP signaling pathway. In wild-type (WT) embryos, BMP4 homodimers
  and BMP4/BMP7 heterodimers are generated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; bottom
  left panel). They are then processed for secretion as they exit the ER and head
  towards the plasma membrane, where the prodomain is cleaved, allowing the dimer
  to be exported. Kim et al. found that the prodomain mutations S91C and E93G disrupt
  cleavage and secretion of BMP4 homodimers, but not BM4/BMP7 heterodimers (bottom
  right panel)
