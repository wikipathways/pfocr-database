caption: 'Possible mechanisms of alcohol effects function on the gut-brain axis. Alcohol
  can cause gut dysbiosis and affect brain function through the neural, immune, neuroendocrine,
  metabolic, and inflammatory pathways. Neural pathway: Alcohol leads to gut dysbiosis
  and increased lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which leads to increased release of proinflammatory
  cytokines [Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8] and
  activation of the vagus nerve affecting the brain. The brain affects the gut by
  inhibiting the vagus nerve and exciting sympathetic nerves; Immune pathway: Alcohol
  promotes microbiota translocation, which leads to antigen-presenting cells activating
  the Th2 response and mast cells and releasing proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-4,
  IL-5, and TNF-α). The brain can affect the gut by activating the sympathetic nerve
  and decreasing vagal tone, which causes immune activation. Neuroendocrine pathway:
  LPS causes inflammation and activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA)
  axis to affect the brain. The brain can affect the gut by affecting the HPA axis
  to release adrenocorticotropic hormones, resulting in increased intestinal permeability.
  Metabolic pathway: Alcohol interferes with the metabolism of tryptophan by causing
  inflammation and affects the kynurenine and 5-HT pathways, which affect brain function.
  In addition, the reduction of small chain fatty acids (SCFAs) can affect the brain
  and gut in both directions. Inflammatory pathways: Alcohol directly affects the
  brain and gut in both directions by mediating LPS-induced inflammation and releasing
