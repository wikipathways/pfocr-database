caption: 'Relationship between PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and apoptosis, inflammation,
  autophagy, and oxidative stress. After the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway:
  (1) it can act on the downstream targets such as NF-κB, mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR), and down-regulate the expression of cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-9
  (Caspase-9), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-3 (Caspase-3), and apoptosis-related
  protein B lymphocyte tumor-2 (Bcl-2) associated x protein (Bax), ultimate anti-apoptosis;
  (2) it up-regulates the expression of low complexity communications codec II/I (LC3-II/LC3-I),
  Beclin-1, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to achieve the effect
  of anti-autophagy; (3) it inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory factors induced
  by NF-κB to achieve the effect of anti-inflammation; (4) activated Akt further activates
  Nrf2, to achieve the effect of anti-oxidative stress.'
