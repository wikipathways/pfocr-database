caption: 'a. Molecular signaling pathways included in the core regularity network.
  b. Examples for cross-talks between pathways. Left: Ligated RARα was found to co-immunoprecipitate
  with ligated GR and to physically interact directly and proposed to be a mechanism
  for their mutual transcriptional repression. In addition, in vitro studies confirmed
  that RA abolished GR-mediated glucocorticoid-induced suppression of CRH expression,
  indicating a negative cross-talk between RARα and GR signaling pathways. Middle:
  At enzyme level, estrogen sulfotransferase, an enzyme important for the metabolic
  deactivation of estrogens, is a transcriptional target of GR. Right: Calcium regulates
  glucocorticoid receptor in mouse corticotrope tumor cells by reversible conversion
  of the receptor to a non-binding form. See  for more details. d. The core molecular
  network. Transcriptional upregulation/activation by mechanisms such as phosphorylation
  is represented by activation with green line and arrow. Transcriptional downregulation/deactivation
  is represented by inhibition with red line and dot. f. Calculated attractors for
  the core network using Boolean method. c. and e. Calculated attractive basins for
  the attractors corresponding OVX rats, OVX rats treated with GluSr and control.
  The normal osteoblast phenotype associates with attractor (4), with ESR(1), GR(0),
  RAR(0), PPAR(1), VDR(1), GRP120(1), Ca2+ (1), NCOA(1), according to microarray data
  shown in Figure . The overactive glucocorticoid pathway in OVX is apparent from
  Figure . The OVX osteoporotic osteoblast phenotype associates with attractor (14),
  with ESR(0), GR(1), RAR(0), PPAR(1), VDR(0), GRP120(0), Ca2+ (0), NCOA(1). The GluSr
  treated phenotype associates with attractor (5), ESR(0), GR(0), RAR(1), PPAR(1),
  VDR(1), GRP130(1), Ca2+ (1), NCOA(1). g. Calculated transition stages after GluSr
  treatment, representing shortest path of switching from OVX attractor (14) to treated
  attractor (5). Biologically, Ca2+ activation and GR signaling pathway inhibition
  are targets for GluSr. h. Calculated transition stages after ovariectomization.
  Biologically, it presents loss of estrogen signaling and subsequent GR signaling
  pathway activation. Note that the colors in the barcode of a state used here denote
  different activated signaling pathways, not the difference of their activity levels.'
