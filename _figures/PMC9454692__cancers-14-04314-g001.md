caption: Signaling pathway and molecular mechanisms that activate IRF4 in malignant
  cells. In normal T cells, MHC–TCR interaction activates upstream intracellular signaling
  pathways, which leads to the activation of NF-κB. Similarly, in normal B cells,
  receptor signaling (e.g., BCR) leads to the activation of NF-κB. NF-κB in turn transcriptionally
  upregulates IRF4, which induces critical immune cell responses. This mechanism is
  thought to be stimulus-dependent and, thus, reversible. In contrast, in malignant
  lymphocytes (e.g., DLBCL, ALCL, and ATL), the NF-κB–IRF4 pathway is often constitutively
  activated in a stimulus-independent manner due to several oncogenic mechanisms (red
  arrows). Genetic alterations in the upstream signaling pathway can constitutively
  activate NF-κB. HTLV-1 infection, which is observed specifically in ATL cells, can
  also activate NF-κB and induce the expression of interacting partner of IRF4 (i.e.,
  BATFs). IRF4 gene expression can also be aberrantly induced via chromosomal rearrangements
  (e.g., chromosomal translocation and amplification). IRF4 protein function may also
  be altered due to genetic mutations. These mechanisms lead to the constitutive activation
  of NF-κB and/or IRF4, which induces the oncogenic transcription program. Furthermore,
  NF-κB and IRF4 activate the upstream signaling pathways via a feedback loop and
  also regulate the same targets (e.g., MYC) via a coherent feedforward loop, which
  further enhances the transcription program.
