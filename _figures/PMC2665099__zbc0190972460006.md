caption: Juxtaposition of apical endoplasmic reticulum and mucin secretory  granules.
  A, electron micrograph of the apical membrane region of  a goblet cell, showing
  the juxtaposition of a mucin secretory granule  (SG) and rough endoplasmic reticulum
  (rER). This human lung  specimen was fixed ∼24 h after harvest for transplantation,
  and hence  fixation is not optimal and internal membrane structures are not well  preserved.
  Nonetheless, the arrays of ribosomes reveal the rough ER and show  the intimate
  relationships between the plasma membrane, granule, rough ER, and  mitochondria
  (M). B, pathway for activation of regulated  secretion in airway goblet cells. Extracellular
  ligands in the airway surface  liquid layer (bottom) bind to heptahelical receptors
  in the apical  membrane that activate Gq and phospholipase (PLC) β1,  generating
  the second messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol  trisphosphate (IP3). Diacylglycerol
  activates the exocytic  priming protein Munc13-2 (dotted blue arrow, left fork)
  and the  exocytic regulator protein kinase Cε (data not shown). IP3  induces the
  release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum  (ER) in the vicinity of mucin-containing
  secretory granules,  activating Syt2 on the surface of secretory granules (dotted
  blue arrow,  right fork) and coactivating Munc13 proteins (data not shown).
