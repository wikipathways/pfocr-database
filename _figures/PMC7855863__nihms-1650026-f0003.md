caption: Non-canonical functions of β-arrestins in mouse adipocytes, pancreatic β-cells,
  and AgRP neurons. A) Adipocytes. In brown adipocytes from wild type mice, βarr1
  binding to the PPARγ/RXRα complex is predicted to prevent activation of the myostatin
  (Mstn) promoter [] In the absence of βarr1, the PPARγ/RXRα complex can activate
  the Mstn promoter, leading to increased plasma Mstn levels which cause peripheral
  insulin resistance []. B) β-Cells. The left side of the cartoon shows that βarr2
  is required for the proper function of CAMKII in β-cells. βarr2 is predicted to
  form a complex with CAMKII that stimulates CAMKII activity in β-cells []. Activated
  CAMKII stimulates insulin secretion via phosphorylation of various signaling proteins
  involved in insulin exocytosis and has been shown to facilitate glucose-dependent
  calcium influx by acting on VDCCs []. Impaired CAMKII activity can fully account
  for the metabolic impairments observed with beta-βarr2-KO mice []. The right side
  of the cartoon shows that β-cell βarr1 is required for the proper function of most
  sulphonylurea drugs (SUs). By binding to the SUR1 subunit of the β-cell ATP-gated
  K+ channel, SU drugs cause channel closure, triggering membrane depolarization,
  Ca2+ influx through VDCCs, and eventually insulin secretion. Most SUs also stimulate
  the formation of a βarr1/Epac2a complex, which promotes Rap1-mediated insulin secretion
  []. C) AgRP neurons. In AgRP neurons from wild type mice, insulin induces hyperpolarization
  and reduced firing frequency by activating a pathway that leads to the opening of
  KATP channels. In the absence of βarr1, insulin-mediated inhibition of AgRP neurons
  is abolished, most likely due to reduced stability of IRS1 (IRS1 is stabilized by
  βarr1 in wild type neurons) []. AC, adenylyl cyclase; DAG, diacylglycerol; ER, endoplasmic
