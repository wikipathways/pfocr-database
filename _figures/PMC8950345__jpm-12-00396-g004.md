caption: The FA pathway involvement in CRC treatment. The DNA damages caused by radio-
  and chemotherapy in CRC cells result in cell death. On the other side, up-regulation
  of the FA pathway components such as RAD51, BRCA1/2, XRCC2, and REV7 leads to HR
  restoration and drug resistance. The deficiency in the FA pathway components such
  as BRCA1/2, XRCC2, and RAD51 represents the synthetic lethal relationship with PARP1,
  which might introduce druggable candidates for PARP inhibitors in CRC cells.
