caption: Effects of vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants on coagulation.
  (A) The coagulation cascade can be activated by both the intrinsic and extrinsic
  pathway, which finally results in activation of thrombin and subsequently fibrin
  formation. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) induce anticoagulation via inhibiting activation
  of the coagulation factors depicted in red (factors X, IX, VII, and II). Direct
  oral anticoagulants (DOACs) induce anticoagulation via blocking the activity of
  coagulation factors Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban) and IIa (dabigatran) depicted
  in blue; (B) Vitamin K cycle is required to carboxylate, and thus activate, vitamin
  K dependent proteins. Vitamin K is converted to vitamin hydroquinone (KH2), which
  is oxidized by γ-glutamylcarboxylase (3) to convert glutamate (Glu) residues in
  γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. This reaction results in vitamin K epoxide (K
  > O), which is recycled to vitamin K through vitamin K epoxide reductase (1). VKA
  disrupts the vitamin K cycle by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) leading
  to depletion of vitamin K and uncarboxylated vitamin K dependent proteins. In the
  liver, the inhibition of warfarin can be circumvented via NAD(P)H quinone reductase
  (2), which can convert vitamin K into KH2 even in the presence of VKA. In extra-hepatic
  tissues NAD(P)H quinone reductase activity is ca. 100 fold less, resulting in inactive
  vitamin K dependent proteins in the presence of VKA; (C) DOACs induce anticoagulation
  via inhibiting the activity of FXa and FIIa via binding to the activation site.
