caption: Mechanical pathway for ROS generation during SDT. (1) Application of ultrasound.
  (2) Mechanical force activates the cation channel (Piezo 1). (3) Ca+2 ions enter
  into the cytosol from extracellular space. (4) Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) also releases
  Ca+2 ions into the cytosol. (5) Increase in Ca+2 concentration leads to calcium
  overload. (6) Calcium overload opens the mPTP in the IMM. (7) This leads to the
  release of cytochrome c (Cyt c). (8a) The process results in disruption of the electron
  transport chain or (8b) activates enzymes such as apoptosomes. (9) Disruption of
  the electron transport chain increases electron leakage, and the ROS concentration
  consequently increases. (10 and 11) Caspase 9 is released, which induces programmed
  cell death or apoptosis
