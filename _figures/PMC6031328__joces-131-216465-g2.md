caption: 'Regulatory mechanisms for alternative splicing impact numerous components
  of the CME. CME occurs in multiple steps: (1) clathrin-coated vesicles are formed;
  (2) proteins are recruited to the nucleation site by the AP2 complex, which together
  with other cargo-specific adaptors mediates cargo selection; (3) the clathrin triskelion
  facilitates vesicle assembly and clathrin polymerization stabilizes the curvature
  of the forming vesicle; (4) dynamin, endophilin and BAR-domain proteins drive vesicle
  scission from the membrane; (5) vesicles are uncoated to fuse with target endosomes;
  (6) cargo is transported through early-endosomes into either recycling vesicles,
  or late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation. Alternative splicing regulates
  several of the proteins that control different CME steps, and the known splicing-regulated
  proteins are shown in red. AAK, 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit
  α-1; AP2, adaptor-related protein complex-2; CLTA, clathrin light chain-a; CLTB,
  clathrin light chain-b; CLTC, clathrin heavy chain; DNAJC6, DNAJ heat shock protein
  family (Hsp40) member C6; DAB2, disabled-2; EPN1/2, epsin-1 and epsin-2; EPS15,
  epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate-15; EPS15R, epidermal growth
  factor receptor pathway substrate 15 recombinant; FCHO1/2, FCH-domain only 1 and
  FCH-domain only 2; GAK, Cyclin G-associated kinase; HIP1R, Huntington interacting
  protein 1 related; HSC70, heatshock protein family A (Hsp70) member 8; ITSN1/2,
  intersectin- 1 and intersectin-2; NUMB, endocytic adapter protein; SNAP91, synaptosome-associated
  protein-91; SNX9, sorting nexin 9.'
