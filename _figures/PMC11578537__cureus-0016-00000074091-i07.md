caption: Hepcidin production is transcriptionally regulated in proportion to plasma
  and tissue iron levels. In conditions of overload (HH and PCT), plasma iron concentrations
  exceed the iron-binding capacity of transferrin, and the excess non-transferrin-bound
  iron is taken up by hepatic endothelial cells and upregulates the expression of
  hepcidin to mitigate any further iron absorption, maintaining homeostasis. Extracellular
  iron-sensing (holo-transferrin sensing) is dependent on TFR1, TFR2, and HFE, on
  the surface of hepatocytes. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) produced by liver
  sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) bind to several key hepcidin regulatory molecules
  (BMP receptors, HFE, and HJV) to form a transmembrane complex. This activates downstream
  SMAD signaling, ultimately increasing hepcidin transcription through the HAMP promoter.
  Inflammatory states enhance hepcidin production through IL-6-mediated JAK/STAT signaling,
  working synergistically with the BMP pathway [5,16]HJV, hemojuvelin; IL-6, interleukin
  6; JAK, Janus kinase; SMAD, small mother against decapentaplegic; STAT, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription; TFR1/2, transferrin receptor 1/2; HH, hereditary
  hemochromatosis; PCT, porphyria cutanea tarda
