caption: Schematic of regenerative mechanisms induced by HAps encapsulated in hybrid
  hydrogels. Following the implantation of HA/HAps into the body, neutrophils underwent
  rapid and programmed apoptosis, which facilitated the polarization of M1 macrophages
  towards M2 macrophages. This polarization recruited and activated fibroblasts by
  enhancing the expression of FGF2. Subsequently, the activation of the FGF2/FGFR
  signaling pathway induced the expression of S100A4, thereby modulating the calcium
  ion signaling pathway. This process promoted the expression of integrins and focal
  adhesion-related proteins such as Itg αV, Itg β1, and Vinculin. Concurrently, it
  upregulated the motor protein signaling pathway, leading to increased expression
  of MYH9. Collectively, these mechanisms enhanced cell adhesion, migration, and spreading,
  ultimately facilitating skin regeneration and repair
