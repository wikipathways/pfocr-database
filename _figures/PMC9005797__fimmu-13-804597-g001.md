caption: Schematic representation of immune mechanisms of immune checkpoints and immune
  checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). (A) T cells, particularly CD4+ T cells in the lymph
  node, recognize tumor antigens in the context of MHC molecules or antigen-presenting
  cell (APC) and T cell receptor (TCR) on T cells. The interaction between CD80 (also
  known as B7-1) or CD86 (also known as B7-2) on APC and CD28 mediates T cell co-stimulation
  in conjunction with TCR signals. CTLA-4 on activated T cell interacts with both
  ligands (i.e., CD80 or CD86) with higher affinity and avidity than CD28 and, unlike
  CD28, sends an inhibitory signal to T cell. Monoclonal antibodies anti-CTLA-4 (i.e.,
  ipilimumab) block this inhibitory pathway restoring T cell activity. (B) T cells,
  particularly cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which recognize tumor antigens in the context
  of MHC class, result in the adaptive expression of PD-L1 on the surface of tumor
  cells. The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 negatively regulates the anti-tumor
  T cell response. This interaction is useful in preventing autoimmunity in physiological
  conditions, whereas cancer cells exploit this mechanism to escape from immune system
  upregulating PD-L1 expression. Anti-PD-1 (i.e., pembrolizumab, nivolumab and cemiplimab)
  and anti-PD-L1 mAbs (i.e., atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) block this inhibitory
  pathway restoring T cell activity.
