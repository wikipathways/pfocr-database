caption: The molecular mechanisms of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin
  reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)
  and ketamine. TCAs can inhibit the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway by blocking the
  H1 receptors (H1Rs),351,352 TCAs decreases the reuptake of dopamine (DA) by inhibiting
  dopamine transporters (DATs) in the presynaptic membrane, and increases the DA concentration
  in the synaptic gap, increase the effect of DA on dopamine receptors (DARs) of postsynaptic
  membrane.343 The activated DARs increase Ca2+ dependent CaMKII and CaMK4, as well
  as, the secretion of CREB.498,499 In another way, the stimulated DARs by DA can
  also activate the cAMP-PKA pathway, which in turn activates the levels of CREB and
  BDNF by stimulating MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway.500 TCAs, SSRIs, and SNRIs can all inhibit
  the reuptake of 5-HT by SERTs, specially SSRIs have the selective inhibition on
  SERTs, which increase the concentration of 5-HT in the synaptic gap and play antidepressive
  roles by effecting on 5-HTRs in postsynaptic membrane,343,344 which also activate
  the cAMP-PKA pathway.49,501 Moreover, TCAs and SNRIs can also inhibit the reuptake
  of NE by NETs, which also increase the concentration of NE in the synaptic gap,
  and in turn activate the effect of NE on adrenoceptors (ADRs) and activate the cAMP-PKA
  pathway in postsynaptic membrane.502 Besides of the AC/cAMP/PKA pathway, the effect
  of NE on ADRs can also activate protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation and mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by stimulating TrkB, in order to promote
  the secretion of postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) and glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1).502
  Ketamine works as the antagonist of NMDAR on GABAergic interneurons, it suppresses
  the excitation of subsets of GABAergic interneurons, which reduces the gamma aminobutyric
  acid (GABA) effects on gamma aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR), and relieves
  the inhibition of GABAergic interneurons on the release of glutamate, the latter
  further stimulates AMPAR on postsynaptic membrane and increases the level of BDNF,
  even the release of BDNF stimulates the above TrkB/AKT/mTORC1 pathway.503,504 Adobe
