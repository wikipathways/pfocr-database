caption: 'Scheme for relationships between exercise-associated hemodynamic changes,
  inflammatory response, and Hsp. (a) Low or turbulent flow is associated with leukocyte
  extravasation [] and expression of adhesion molecules [], resulting in intimal hyperplasia,
  cell apoptosis [] and inflammatory signaling []. The associated inflammatory signaling
  leads to increased oxidative stress, induction of inflammatory pathways such as
  c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) [] and NF-κB [], and suppression of endothelial
  nitric oxide (eNOS) and oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) []. (b) In contrast, an exercise
  induced increase in laminar shear stress activates eNOS [] and HSF1 []. HSF1 activation
  leads to increased heat shock proteins 25, 70, and 90 (Hsp25, Hsp70, and Hsp90)
  [] which may inhibit many of these inflammatory processes indirectly via activation
  of eNOS signaling (Hsp90) [] and directly through suppression of oxidative stress
  (Hsps 25, 70, and 90) [] and inflammatory signaling including via the NF-κB pathway
  (Hsps 25 and 70) []. (c) Hsp may also directly reduce apoptosis (Hsps 70 and 90)
  [] and hyperplasia (Hsp 70) []. Hsp70 has further been implicated in decreased expression
  of adhesion molecules [] leading to a reduction of leukocyte extravasation [] and
  expression of inflammatory cytokines []. Hsp70 also suppresses JNK signaling []
  further inhibiting inflammatory signaling and cytokine release. See text for a more
  complete description. →— represents activating role; |— represents inhibitory role;
