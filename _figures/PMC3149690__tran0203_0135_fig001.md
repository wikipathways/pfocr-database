caption: Regulation of sulfur metabolite homeostasis by ubiquitin-controlled transcription
  programs. (A) The ubiquitin ligase SCFMet30 links nutrient availability and heavy
  metal stress to cell cycle control and transcriptional response. The transcriptional
  activator Met4 is maintained in an inactive state by ubiquitylation. Ubiquitin-binding
  domains in the amino-terminal region of Met4 shield the ubiquitin chain from proteasome
  recognition and degradation. Nutrient or heavy metal stress block Met4 ubiquitylation
  and deubiquitylation converts the dormant pool of inactive Met4 into an active transcription
  factor. Met4 together with several co-factors induces a transcriptional program
  to restore sulfur metabolite homeostasis and to protect from heavy metal stress.
  A cell cycle arrest that specifically requires Met32 is also induced to protect
  cellular and genomic integrity during stress. (B) The transcriptional activator
  Met4 is substrate and substrate adapter of the ubiquitin ligase SCFMet30-Met4 and
  controls transcription complex dynamics. The transactivator function of Met4 is
  inhibited by SCFMet30-mediated ubiquitylation. Met4 ubiquitylation does not regulate
  its function as substrate adapter of the ubiquitin ligase SCFMet30-Met4, which leads
  to ubiquitylation and degradation of the DNA-binding co-factors Met31, Met32 and
  Cbf1. Stress signals block SCFMet30 resulting in simultaneous activation of Met4
  and stabilization of the Met4 bound co-factors to assemble the active Met4 complex.
  A constitutive second degradation pathway independent of SCFMet30-Met4 selectively
  removes unbound co-factors. Repression after disappearance of the stress signal
  induces ubiquitin-dependent co-factor degradation and Met4 inactivation.

  description: Regulation of sulfur metabolite homeostasis by ubiquitin-controlled
    transcription programs. (A) The ubiquitin ligase SCFMet30 links nutrient availability
    and heavy metal stress to cell cycle control and transcriptional response. The
    transcriptional activator Met4 is maintained in an inactive state by ubiquitylation.
    Ubiquitin-binding domains in the amino-terminal region of Met4 shield the ubiquitin
    chain from proteasome recognition and degradation. Nutrient or heavy metal stress
    block Met4 ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation converts the dormant pool of inactive
    Met4 into an active transcription factor. Met4 together with several co-factors
    induces a transcriptional program to restore sulfur metabolite homeostasis and
    to protect from heavy metal stress. A cell cycle arrest that specifically requires
    Met32 is also induced to protect cellular and genomic integrity during stress.
    (B) The transcriptional activator Met4 is substrate and substrate adapter of the
    ubiquitin ligase SCFMet30-Met4 and controls transcription complex dynamics. The
    transactivator function of Met4 is inhibited by SCFMet30-mediated ubiquitylation.
    Met4 ubiquitylation does not regulate its function as substrate adapter of the
    ubiquitin ligase SCFMet30-Met4, which leads to ubiquitylation and degradation
    of the DNA-binding co-factors Met31, Met32 and Cbf1. Stress signals block SCFMet30
    resulting in simultaneous activation of Met4 and stabilization of the Met4 bound
    co-factors to assemble the active Met4 complex. A constitutive second degradation
    pathway independent of SCFMet30-Met4 selectively removes unbound co-factors. Repression
    after disappearance of the stress signal induces ubiquitin-dependent co-factor
    degradation and Met4 inactivation.
