caption: 'P3HB, P3HB4HB, and PHBV synthesis pathway in engineered Escherichia coli.
  Genes: acs, acetyl-CoA synthetase; pta, phosphotransacetylase; ackA, acetate kinase;
  phaA, β-ketothiolase; phaB, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase; phaC, PHA synthase; sucD,
  succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase; 4hbD, 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase; orfZ,
  4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA:CoA transferase; sad and gabD, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase
  of E. coli; pct, propionyl-CoA transferase; prpP, propionate permease. The reactions
  and intermediates shown in green are associated with 3HB precursor biosynthesis,
  those in gold with 4HB precursor biosynthesis, those in purple with 3HV precursor
  biosynthesis, and those in blue with acetate assimilation and TCA cycle'
