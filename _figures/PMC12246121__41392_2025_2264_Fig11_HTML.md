caption: Translation regulations in PRRs. a Regulation of translation initiation in
  PRRs. For example, phosphorylation, hyperphosphorylation and dephosphorylation eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor induces regulation of translation, affecting most
  cellular PRR mRNAs’ expression, acting through the TICAM1or mTOR- mediated pathway.
  b Gene-specific regulation in PRRs. For example, TIA1, an ARE-binding protein, can
  repress the translation of TNF and other cytokine mRNAs following TLR stimulation
  by impeding their association with polyribosomes. c Regulation of translation elongation
  and termination in PRRs. For example, MAP3K8 and CLEC4E inhibit the translational
  machinery by dephosphorylating eukaryotic translation elongation factors, thereby
  suppressing PRRs-dependent cytokine production. This figure is created by BioRender
