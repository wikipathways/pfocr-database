caption: Schematic representation of intrahepatic interplays among hepatocytes, non-parenchymal
  cells (NPC) and lymphocytes and illustration of antiviral and immunotherapeutic
  strategies. HBV replication cycle in hepatocytes is illustrated herein and explained
  in details in text. HBV antigens from infected hepatocytes can be captured and cross-presented
  by liver-resident antigen-presentation cells, such as dendritic cells and Kupffer
  cells, to activate HBV-specific T lymphocytes that control HBV infection by either
  cytolytic kill or cytokine-mediated cure of infected hepatocytes. In addition, activation
  of TLRs in NPCs by their cognate ligands induces the production of type I IFNs,
  proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The type I IFNs bind to their receptors
  on hepatocytes to trigger JAK-STAT signaling pathway and induce the expression of
  ISGs, which limit HBV replication via inhibition of cccDNA transcription and encapsidation
  of HBV pgRNA. The molecular or cellular targets of the ten antiviral (Red cross
  with number) and immunotherapeutic (Green arrow with number) strategies currently
  used in clinic or under pre-clinical or clinical development for management of chronic
  hepatitis B are illustrated herein and explained in details in text and  in the
  same numerical fashion.
