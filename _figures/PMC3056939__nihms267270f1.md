caption: The role of impaired brain insulin signaling in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease
  (sAD) pathology. Disturbance of brain insulin signaling has been suggested to be
  a key causative event underlying sAD etiopathogenesis, being linked to the presence
  of the two major pathological features of this neurodegenerative disorder, senile
  plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Indeed, impaired insulin/insulin receptor
  (IR) signaling leads to decreased insulin-mediated activation of phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt signaling activity, resulting in overactivation of glycogen
  synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Consequently, GSK-3β overactivation directly promotes
  tau hyperphosphorylation and formation of NFTs, as well as amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation
  and senile plaques formation. Additionally, disruption of insulin signaling leads
  to a decreased glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) and -3 (GLUT-3) expression, culminating
  in impaired cerebral glucose uptake/metabolism. Moreover, it was recently proposed
  that decreased neuronal glucose metabolism results in decreased level of UDP-GlcNAc
  via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and, consequently, decreased tau O-GlcNAcylation,
  thus potentiating tau hyperphosphorylation. Overall, impaired brain insulin signaling
  seems to be a plausible trigger of neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline in
  sAD.
