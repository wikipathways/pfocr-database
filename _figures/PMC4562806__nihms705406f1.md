caption: PD-1 has both an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif
  (ITSM) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic
  tail. SHP-2 can bind to the phosphorylated ITSM. PD-1 ligation by ligands leads
  to overall inhibition of TCR signaling through inhibition of CD3ζ chain phosphorylation
  and Zap-70 association. PD-1 signaling causes the downregulation of both Ras and
  Bcl-xL which affect proliferation and cell survival, respectively. An increase in
  BATF can be seen which impairs the effector function of T cells. PD-1 also inhibits
  the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway by inhibiting the activation
  of PI3K. This has downstream effects including the downregulation of mechanistic
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) and an increased half-life of FoxO1. PD-1 signaling also
  influences the cell’s metabolism by inhibiting glycolysis and promoting fatty acid
  oxidation. Together, all of these effects cause T cells to become less proliferative,
  lose their effector functions, and take on an exhausted and dysfunctional phenotype.
  The net effect of PD-1 ligation on all of these processes is shown in red with arrow
  direction indicating upregulation and downregulation.
