caption: 'A Schematic diagram of adiponectin-mediated thermogenic regulation in brown
  and “beige” adipocytes. Our data suggest that adiponectin may regulate thermogenesis
  in brown adipocytes via the following 4 independent and complementary cellular/molecular
  mechanisms: 1) Ablation of adiponectin decreases β3-AR expression, which directly
  inhibits UCP-1 gene expression and activity. 2) Ablation of adiponectin inhibits
  insulin signaling, which may reduce UCP-1 activity. 3) Ablation of adiponectin suppresses
  the signaling pathway of AMPK-SIRT1, which may in turn result in reduced mitochondrial
  biogenesis. 4) Ablation of adiponectin impairs mitochondrial dynamics in BAT, which
  may contribute to thermogenic dysfunction. Collectively, adiponectin ablation diminishes
  thermogenic activation by decreasing adrenergic activation, and impairing mitochondrial
  biosynthesis and/or dynamics, thus suppressing thermogenesis in brown and “beige”
  adipocytes'
