caption: 'Comparison of a canonical, cAMP-signaling pathway in the human host cell
  and in Apicomplexan parasites: (A) Activation/reactivation cycle of a heterotrimeric
  G-protein in the context of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling: 1. binding
  of a ligand to the receptor causing a conformational change, 2. GDP bound to the
  alpha-subunit is exchanged to GTP, 3. dissociation of the alpha-subunit from the
  Gβγ-dimer and the receptor, 4. Formation of a complex between the G-alpha subunit
  or the Gβγ-dimer and the effector molecule 5. Activation of a GTPase that hydrolyzes
  GTP to GDP under the control of a regulator of G-protein signaling, 6. Trimer formation
  of the different G-protein subunits. (B) Non-canonical cyclic nucleotide signaling
  pathways in Plasmodium. The exchange protein (EPAC) pathway (left side of the figure):
  1. during egress and invasion of merozoites PfACβ triggers cAMP levels fostering
  the EPAC pathway which in turn leads to phosphorylation of Rap-GDP to Rap-GTP. 2.
  Rap-GTP activates phospholipase C (PLC) to produce inositol triphosphte (IP3) that
  binds to the IP3 receptor. 3. Activation of the IP3 receptor leads to a release
  of calcium ions. Calcium ions bind to calcineurin and activate calcium-dependent
  protein kinase 1 (CDPK1). Middle part of the figure: besides the EPAC pathway cAMP
  activates protein kinase A. Right part of the figure: at low potassium concentrations
  an unknown ligand binds to the SR25 receptor which mediates the signal to a guanylyl
  cyclase that activates protein kinase G. Protein kinase G (PKG) acts in concert
  with a stage specific calcium dependent kinase.'
