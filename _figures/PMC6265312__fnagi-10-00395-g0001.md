caption: 'Role of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) in microglial
  survival and metabolism. TREM2 may mediate microglial cell survival through various
  pathways: TREM2 can promote microglial proliferation by activating the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway and inhibit microglial apoptosis through the Akt/GSK3β pathway;
  TREM2 can regulate the key components of inflammasome, such as NLR family pyrin
  domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and/or gasdermin D (GSDMD) to inhibit microglial pyroptosis;
  TREM2 can also activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, regulating microglial autophagy
  and sustaining cellular energetic and biosynthetic metabolism, therefore promoting
  the survival of microglial cells. Through binding to various ligands, such as amyloid-β
  (Aβ), apolipoproteins, lipoprotein or anionic lipids, TREM2 can be stimulated physiologically
  or pathologically, directing microglia to different fates during normal conditions
  or the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurological diseases.'
