caption: 'Retinoic acid (RA) is the downstream metabolite of retinol, which is initially
  taken up into the cell by STRA6 (1). Once inside, retinol binds to cellular retinol-binding
  protein 1 (CRBP1), initiating a two-step oxidative process that converts it into
  functional RA (2, 3). Excess retinol can follow three alternative pathways: it can
  be stored in the cytoplasm as retinyl ester (8), secreted paracrinally to adjacent
  tissues (7), or degraded via CYP26A1 (4). As carrier proteins, cellular RA-binding
  protein 2 (CRABP2) and fatty acid-binding protein (FABP5) maintain a dynamic balance,
  both binding RA to transport it into the nucleus for downstream gene transcription
  [15,16]. RA transported by CRABP2 binds to the RXR-RAR heterodimer at the PPRE region,
  regulating apoptosis and suppressing cell growth (5) [15,16]. Alternatively, RA
  can activate the FABP5-bound PPARG axis, inducing transcription at the RARE region,
  which is essential for maintaining basic cell functions and promoting cell growth
  (6) [18,21,22]. STRA6: stimulated by retinoic acid 6, SDR: short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase,
  LRAT: lecithin retinol acyltransferase, PPRE: peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor response element, RARE: retinoic acid response element'
