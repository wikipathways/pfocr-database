caption: Schematic representation of δ receptor‐mediated ERK1/2 activation via the
  PKCδ/EGFR/β‐arrestin2 signalling pathway in response to specific agonist stimulation.
  DPDPE binding to δ receptors results in the dissociation of heterotrimeric G‐proteins
  into Gα‐GTP and Gβγ subunits. Gβγ subunit release leads to the recruitment and activation
  of Src, which causes tyrosine phosphorylation of the δ receptors, producing an SH2
  site that might bind to Shc, Grb2 and additional downstream molecules to activate
  the Ras‐dependent ERK cascade, whereas the binding of TIPP or morphine to δ receptors
  activates PKCδ rather than Src, which results in the activation of metalloproteinase
  (MMP), release of heparin‐binding EGF‐like factor (HB‐EGF) and transactivation of
  EGFR. The transactivated EGFR can then activate ERK1/2 by recruiting β‐arrestins
  as a scaffold to assemble component kinases of the ERK cascade. Mutation of the
  Ser363 residue of the δ receptor can switch DPDPE from activation of Src to activation
  of PKCδ and thus allows it gain the ability to appropriate the PKCδ/EGFR/β‐arrestin2
  signalling pathway to activate ERK1/2.
