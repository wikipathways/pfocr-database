caption: Targeted metabolomicss was carried out at Cornell university. All metabolites
  statistically significantly different with a p-value less than .01 were used to
  create a network in STITCH Version 4 with a medium stringency of .40 and no additional
  proteins. All unconnected metabolites were discarded. The network was plotted in
  Cystoscape using Neighborhood Connectivity map. Node color = absolute value of the
  difference between the fold change of 0 vs 24 h with estrogen and without estrogen
  (i.e. if a metabolite increased 2.5-fold with estrogen from 0 to 24 hours, and 1.5
  without, Absolute Fold Change would equal to 1, darker is equivalent to a higher
  change); node size is equivalent to “degree” (the number of connected metabolites).
