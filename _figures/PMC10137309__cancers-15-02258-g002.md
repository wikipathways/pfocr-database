caption: 'Schematic representation of extravasation steps in melanoma brain metastasis.
  (A) Rolling and firm adhesion: During adhesion to BE, melanoma cells express VLA-4(Integrin
  α4β1), TGF-β1 (activate EndMT), and upregulate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway that enhance
  the adhesion of melanoma cells [74,75]. (B) Trans-endothelial migration: Disruption
  of endothelial junctions allows the TEM of melanoma cells. Melanoma cells release
  MMP2, MMP9, S100A4, and TGF-β1 that stimulates EndMT, which in turn reduces the
  expression of claudin-5 and VE-cadherin. Transmigrated melanoma cells trigger astrocytes
  to release IL-23, that in turn upregulates MMP2 in melanoma cells and facilitates
  TEM. Melanoma cells also release proteolytic enzymes to degrade a basement membrane,
  including serine proteases, seprase-uPAR complex, and HPSE-1 [109]. Other TEM mediators
  include PI3K/AKT, S100A4, PLEKHA5, plasminogen, MTf, CCR4, and TGF-β1 that activate
  EndMT, while CXCL10 secreted by activated astrocytes attracts the migration of melanoma
  cells toward astrocytes through the secreted CXCR3 [105,110,117,118]. Photo created
