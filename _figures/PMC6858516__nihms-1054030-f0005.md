caption: Cell cycle machinery is governed by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases
  (CDKs) at different phases. For instance, at the G1 phase, CDK4/6 binds to cyclin
  D to phosphorylate RB1 to release E2F. This enables E2F, a transcription factor,
  to relocate onto DNA to drive gene expression, such as those encoding CDK2, cyclin
  A and cyclin E, to advance cells to S phase. Loss of RB1 and/or amplification of
  CDKs are more common in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)
  than in localized prostate cancer. CDK4/6 inhibitors are being tested in clinical
  trials in RB1 wild-type mCRPC as a monotherapy and in combination with androgen
  receptor pathway inhibitors.
