caption: Schematic diagram illustrating signaling of EZH2 and its upstream activator
  and its downstream effectors in GC. SP1 directly binds to the core promoter of UCA1
  so that it activates the expression of UCA1. UCA1 directly interacts with EZH2 and
  increase the expression of EZH2, which affects the activation of AKT/GSK-3B/cyclin
  D1 axis. EZH2 could also physically interact with the cyclin D1 promoter to promote
  the expression of cyclin D1. In addition, P-AKT could indirectly influence the expression
  of EZH2 so as to form a positive feedback loop with EZH2. With the accumulation
  of cyclin D1, G1/S transition was activated to promote cell proliferation and cancer
  progression
