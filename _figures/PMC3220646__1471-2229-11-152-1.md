caption: Tocopherol biosynthetic pathway in higher plants. Tocopherols consist of
  a polar chromanol ring and a lipophilic prenyl chain derived from homogentisic acid
  and phytyl diphosphate. The shikimate pathway produces the homogentisic acid, whereas
  the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway produces phytyl diphosphate.
  Phytyl transferase (HPT) catalyzes the reaction of phytyl diphosphate addition to
  homogentisic acid, producing the common precursor of the tocopherol biosynthetic
  pathway, methyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinone (MPBQ). MPBQ-methyltransferase (MPBQ-MT)
  adds a methyl alkyl to MPBQ, to produce 2,3-dimethyl-6-phytyl-plastoquinol (DMPBQ).
  MPBQ and DMPBQ are cyclized by tocopherol cyclase (TC) to form δ-tocopherol and
  γ-tocopherol, respectively. The last step of tocopherol biosynthesis is methylation
  of δ-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol, which produces β-tocopherol and α-tocopherol,
  respectively. These reactions are catalyzed by γ-tocopherol methyltransferase (γ-TMT).
