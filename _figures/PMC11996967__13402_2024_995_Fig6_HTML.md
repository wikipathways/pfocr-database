caption: Graphical illustration describing the 2OHOA mechanism of action to inhibit
  Notch2 and Notch3 signaling. Model for activated Notch2/3 signaling (left panel).
  Proposal model for 2OHOA mechanism of action (right panel) where its interaction
  with the furin enzyme prevents Notch2 processing in Golgi. Instead, Notch3 is transcriptionally
  repressed probably by indirect 2OHOA mechanism (indicated as dashed line). In addition,
  HES1 overexpression partially inhibits the 2OHOA effect on viability (narrower dashed
  line). Continuous lines indicate activation while transparent continuous lines represent
  lower activation of the pathway
