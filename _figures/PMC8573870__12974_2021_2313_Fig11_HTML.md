caption: The mechanism by which macrophage polarization modulates the OT signalling
  system. LPS induces M1-like polarization to secrete proinflammatory factors that
  activate the STAT3 and NF-κB pathways to inhibit the OT signalling system in enteric
  neurons. IL4 induces M2-like polarization to secrete anti-inflammatory factors that
  activate the Smad2/3 pathway to upregulate the OT signalling system by inhibiting
  the expression of Peg3 in enteric neurons. OT may be a potent agent for the treatment
  of gastrointestinal disorders caused by immune dysfunction
