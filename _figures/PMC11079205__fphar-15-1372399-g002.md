caption: Effects of the GM and gut hormones on bone metabolism. The GM regulates bone
  homeostasis through multiple pathways, including host metabolism, immunomodulation,
  and hormonal regulation. On the one hand, the GM promotes the production of GLP-1
  and GLP-2 by intestinal cells through SCFAs, thereby promoting bone formation; in
  addition, the increased secretion of IGF-1 is also favorable to bone formation.
  On the other hand, the GM inhibits osteoclast activity by inhibiting Th17 cell differentiation
  and thus inhibiting the release of RANKL
