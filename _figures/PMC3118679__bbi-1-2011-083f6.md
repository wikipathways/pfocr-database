caption: Overall results depicted in the networks of AA and glucose transporters and
  mTOR, Jak2-Stat5, insulin, and AMPK signaling with log2 fold change at 15 relative
  to −15 d postpartum. The overall pathway was built using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  software. Grey-shaded objects denote measured genes with not significant change,
  red-shaded object denote up-regulation, and green-shaded objects down-regulation
  in expression relative to −15 days in milk. The expression of LALBA has been previously
  measured in the same samples. Arrow denote relationships (P = phosphorylation, PP
  = protein-protein interaction, PR = protein-RNA interaction, E = effect on expression,
  A = activation). Dotted lines denote indirect effect. See caption for  for detailed
  explanation.
