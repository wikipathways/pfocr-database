caption: 'Schematic with key elements of the polyol pathway and interaction with glycolysis,
  the pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle. The polyol pathway consists of two
  steps: (1) The conversion of glucose to sorbitol by the enzyme aldose reductase,
  consuming NADPH. (2) The conversion of sorbitol to fructose by the enzyme sorbitol
  dehydrogenase, consuming NAD+. The consumption of NADPH by the first reaction leads
  to decreased amounts of the antioxidant reduced glutathione (GSH), contributing
  to oxidative stress. Fructose can be further metabolized to fructose-3-phosphate
  and 3-deoxyglucosone and the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs).
  NAD+ is a cofactor for the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate
  by the enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Depletion of NAD+, leads
  to increased flux into the pentose phosphate pathway. Multiple arrows indicate multiple
  steps in a pathway. GSSG: Oxidized glutathione. TCA Cycle: Tricarboxylic acid cycle.
  Enzyme names are italicized. Adapted from references [–].'
