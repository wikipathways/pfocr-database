caption: Regulation of NF‐κB signaling pathway by the circadian clock. Circadian clocks
  regulate NF‐κB signaling pathway through diverse aspects including transcription,
  post‐translational modification, and protein–protein interactions. REV‐ERBα regulates
  NF‐κB via modulation of p65 subunit and TLR4. BMAL1 acts as an NF‐κB/NLRP3 repressor
  through REV‐ERBα. CLOCK interacts with the p65 subunit. CRY1 binds to adenylyl cyclase
  to limit cAMP production and inactivates PKA, subsequently resulting in NF‐κB activation
  through phosphorylation of p65. cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; CLOCK, circadian
  locomotor output cycles kaput; CRY, cryptochrome; IKK, IκB kinase; NF‐κB, nuclear
  factor‐κB; PKA, protein kinase A; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; REV‐ERBα,
  nuclear reverse erythroblastosis virus heme receptor α; TLR, Toll‐like receptors
