caption: Regulation of LPS-induced TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway by ubiquitination
  and phosphorylation. When NF-κB is not subjected to external stimulation, it can
  induce the assembly of an inactive IκB/p50/p65 trimer. After LPS stimulation, the
  activated TLR4 firstly forms a complex with MyD88. Then, the MyD88 complex promotes
  the phosphorylation of IRAK4, thereby further phosphorylates TRAF6, while detaching
  from MyD88. Ubiquitination of TRAF6 induces downstream IKK-mediated NF-κB signaling
  pathway, triggering downstream IκB phosphorylation and inactivation, which leads
  to NF-κB dimer breaking away from IκB, thereby entering the nucleus and acting on
  the original NF-κB response element, that is, the gene locus of binding to NF-κB.
  Thereafter, the transcriptional translation process is initiated, which leads to
  the expression of downstream genes related to inflammatory factors and chemokines.
