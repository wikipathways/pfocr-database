caption: 'IFN action is mediated via three receptor complexes: heterodimers between
  IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 bind type I IFNs; IL10R2 associates with IFNLR1 to bind the three
  IFNλ; and a tetramer consisting of two IFNGR2 receptor chains with two IFNG1 receptor
  chains binds dimers of the type II IFNγ. Signal transduction is initiated by pre-associated
  Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK1 and TYK2), which phosphorylate the IFNAR1 receptor
  chain enabling recruitment and phosphorylation of the Signal Transducers and Activators
  of Transcription (STATs). STAT heterodimers associate with the IFN regulatory factor
  9 (IRF9) forming the IFN-stimulated transcription factor (ISGF3), or STAT homodimers
  form the IFNγ activation factor (GAF). These complexes translocate to the nucleus
  to induce IFN-stimulated genes from ISRE or GAS promoter elements, for type I and
  III, or type II IFN responses, respectively. Divergences from this simplified signalling
  pathway occur, for instance, type I IFNs are reported to elicit STAT homodimers,
  and more complicated interplay, with activation of other STAT proteins, occurs than
  is shown here.'
