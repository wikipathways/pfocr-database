caption: Signaling pathways involved in the control of NCC specification and emigration
  during trunk elongation. The FGF signaling (pink), acting through the MAPK pathway,
  prevents the onset of NCC (green) specification in the caudal neural tube and, through
  the regulation of Wnt1 onset of expression (pale red) and Noggin (orange) expression,
  controls the initiation of NCC emigration. The RA signaling (blue) controls the
  initiation of NCC emigration by modulating NCC genes (dashed arrow) or by controlling
  the onset of Wnt1 expression. The BMP signaling gradient (pale green) promotes the
  onset and maintenance of NCC emigration through the control of Wnt1 expression (gray
  lines; data from ).
