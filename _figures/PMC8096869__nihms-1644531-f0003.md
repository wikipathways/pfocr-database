caption: Myometrial stem cells are essential for normal myometrial development and
  growth of the uterus during pregnancy. These cells divide to give rise to progenitor
  cells that subsequently differentiate to mature myometrial cells. In response to
  genetic mutations, epigenetic aberrations, and chromosomal abnormalities, these
  cells can undergo tumorigenesis, transforming to leiomyoma stem cells. These stem
  cells interact with mature myometrial cells through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to
  promote proliferation and ECM formation, characteristic of leiomyoma development.
