caption: HPV18 rather than HPV16 is significantly associated with activation of Wnt/β‐catenin
  signaling in CC specimens. (A) Wnt/β‐catenin signaling activation is positively
  correlated with HPV18 infection in CC specimens. The gene signatures of Wnt/β‐catenin
  signaling activation were enriched in the groups of patients with HPV18 infection.
  The CC samples of HPV18 positive and HPV18 negative were collected from TCGA database,
  and Wnt pathway activation was analyzed by GSEA. (B) The gene signatures of Wnt/β‐catenin
  signaling activation were enriched in the HPV18 E6+ group than that in the HPV16
  E6+ group; the CC data (< 43.5 years old, median age) from TCGA database were analyzed
  by GSEA. (C) Schematic illustration of the mechanism of CC development due to HPV18
  infection via downregulation of MAGI3 and activation of Wnt/β‐catenin signaling.
