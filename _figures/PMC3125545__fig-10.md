caption: Schematic of potential interactions resulting in myelin abnormalities in
  SSADH-deficient mice. Circled dashes represent regions of downregulation, whereas
  upward or downward pointing arrows indicate metabolite concentrations in mutant
  mice. Increased GABA/GHB result in use-dependent effects on GABA receptors and altered
  signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These changes, coupled
  with decreases in brain neuroactive steroids in SSADH-deficient mice (), may provide
  an explanation for low plasmalogen and myelin levels in mutant mice. 3βHSD, 3β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase; GABA, 4-aminobutyrate; GABA(A)R and GABA(B)R, GABA receptors; MAPK,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase. Figure adapted from Donarum et al. ().
