caption: Regulation of sodium transport by PAR2 in the rat cTAL. A,  activation of
  basolateral PAR2, either by cleavage of its N-terminal domain by  trypsin or by
  a synthetic peptide mimicking the ligand domain, is coupled to  the activation of
  PLC. In turn, PLC triggers calcium signaling (↑  [Ca2+]i), which activates cPKc
  and induces the  phosphorylation of ERK. Activation of ERK is responsible both for
  increased  permeability of the tight junction to sodium and for enhanced  Vmax of
  Na,K-ATPase. Because inhibition of this pathway  has no significant effect on the
  transepithelial voltage (PDte), it  is suggested that the opposite effects on PDte
  of increased  Vmax of Na,K-ATPase and increased permeability to sodium  of the paracellular
  pathway (thick arrows) are quantitatively  similar. Activation of PLC also stimulates
  an unidentified  staurosporine-sensitive protein kinase, which mediates an increase
  in the  apparent affinity of Na,K-ATPase for sodium. Because inhibition of this  pathway
  also abolishes PAR2-induced increase in PDte, the increased  sodium affinity of
  Na,K-ATPase is likely a major actor of the change in  PDte and to increased sodium
  reabsorption. B, basolateral  Na,K-ATPase generates a sodium gradient allowing apical
  entry of sodium,  potassium, and chloride via the furosemide-sensitive cotransporter
  NKCC2.  Diffusive exit of potassium by apical ROMK and of chloride by basolateral  ClC-K
  generates a transepithelial voltage (PDte) that drives  paracellular reabsorption
  of sodium. Because the tight junctions are almost  impermeable to chloride, there
  is no back diffusion of chloride toward the  lumen.
