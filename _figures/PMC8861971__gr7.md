caption: 'Mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and response suggested by RPPA(A) Phosphorylation
  and inferred activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway affected by everolimus in Bx2.
  Decreased phosphorylation of S6 downstream of mTORC1 likely resulted from everolimus
  inhibition, but increased phosphorylation of proteins downstream of PI3K and AKT,
  possibly through mutant PI3K E542K activity and/or feedback signaling to mTORC2,
  may have provided continued oncogenic signaling in the presence of this drug. Proteins
  are noted as increased activating phosphorylation (>1.4×, red), increased inhibitory
  phosphorylation (>1.4×, pink), decreased activating phosphorylation (<0.7×, green),
  or unchanged/unknown phosphorylation (yellow). Changes in phosphorylation in Bx2
  versus Bx1: PDK1 = 1.45×, AKT T308 = 1.20×, AKT S473 = 2.69×, TSC2 = 1.43×, GSK3A/B =
  1.71×, MDM2 = 1.75×, p70S6K1 = 0.92×, 4EBP1 = 1.37×, S6 S235/236 = 0.69×, S240/244 =
  0.14×.(B) Activation status for cell cycle regulatory pathways affected by palbociclib
  in Bx2, as inferred from total and phosphoprotein levels. Palbociclib blocks cell
  division in responsive cells by inhibiting CDK4/6 phosphorylation of RB1, but Bx2
  had continued high levels of phospho-RB1 and cell proliferation under treatment
  with this drug (RB1 P-S807/811 = 0.98× versus pre-treatment Bx1). This is possibly
  due to degradation of the CDK2 inhibitor p21 (0.50× versus Bx1) by activated PI3K/AKT
  signaling (see A), which would activate canonical cyclin E/CDK2 complexes to drive
  cells through G1-S. Alternatively, cell division might be proceeding through the
  formation of non-canonical cyclin D1/CDK2 complexes because of amplified CCND1 (B),
  high levels of cyclin D1 protein (1.67× versus Bx1), and low p21. CDK2 activation
  can be countered with the broad-spectrum CDK inhibitor abemaciclib. Inferred activation
  status is based on total protein levels or phosphorylation and is designated as
  relative increases (red), decreases (green), or unchanged/unknown (yellow).See also
