caption: The activities of Nkx3.1. (A) The role of Nkx3.1 in the IL-6-STAT3 signalling
  pathway during iPSC in-duction. Nkx3.1 is a target of STAT3, downstream of IL6r
  activation and is essential during reprogramming. IL-6r deficiency during reprogramming
  is reported to be rescued by Nkx3.1 alone or in cooperation with STAT3. However,
  knockdown of STAT3 decreases Nkx3.1 protein level, whereas knockdown of Nkx3.1 blocks
  iPSC reprogramming (). (B) Nkx3.1 can replace Oct4 in cellular reprogramming, and
  promotes the generation of iPSCs with a similar efficiency to Oct4.
