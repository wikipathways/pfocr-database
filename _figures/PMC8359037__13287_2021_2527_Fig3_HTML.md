caption: The Shh signalling pathway in HFSCs. a In the absence of Shh, the complex
  consisting of Gli and Sufu cannot form, preventing the transcription of the target
  genes. b In the Shh pathway, Shh induces the release of Smo inhibition. Then, Smo
  can translocate into the membrane and initiate the activation and translocation
  of Gli into the nucleus, allowing the transcription of target genes (e.g., Ptch
  and Gli1), creating a feedback loop in this pathway. When the Shh ligand does not
  bind to its receptor, PTCH, this cascade is aborted, and Gli is sequestered in the
  cytoplasm via the interaction with suppressor of fused homologue (Sufu, one of the
  crucial inhibitors of Shh signalling). The T-shaped lines indicate inhibitory interactions
  involved in this pathway, and the solid arrows indicate activating interactions
