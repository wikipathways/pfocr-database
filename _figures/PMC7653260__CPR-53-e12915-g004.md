caption: Signalling pathway of programmed necrosis in hearing loss. When a ligand
  binds to tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), a combination of TNFR‐associated
  death domain (TRADD) and receptor‐interacting protein (RIP) 1 increases the level
  of RIP3 and induces self‐ and transphosphorylation, which is followed by the oligomerization
  of phosphorylated RIP3. Active RIP3 catalyses the phosphorylation of the mixed lineage
  kinase domain‐like protein (MLKL), thus resulting in the formation of MLKL oligomers
  and in translocation to the plasma membrane. Through the reversal mechanism, specific
  phosphatidylinositol phosphates are combined that lead to plasma membrane permeability
  and eventually cell necrosis
