caption: Factors affecting DC maturation and function in NSCLC. (A) The activation
  of NF-κB, STAT3 and MAPK pathways promotes the maturation of DCs. NF-κB signaling
  pathway can be activated by the elevation of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB levels. SHP-1
  binds to STAT3 can mediate its dephosphorylation. MAPK signaling pathway can be
  activated through the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 MAPK. (B) Glycolysis
  promotes STING signal-dependent tumor-infiltrating DC activity in NSCLC, which accelerates
  PKM2 and HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis and establishes a positive feedback loop. (C)
  LncMALAT1 can be transferred to DCs via exosomes released by NSCLC tumor cells.
  Elevated expression of LncMALAT1 has been shown to inhibit the maturation phenotype
  and function of DCs in NSCLC. (D) The release of tumor-derived factors such as VEGF,
  TGF-β, and IL-10 inhibits DC maturation, while the release of CCL19 and TNF-α promotes
  DC migration and maturation. (E) Several pathways can regulate M2 macrophage polarization.
  In THP-1 cells, reduced NOD2 expression and inhibited NF-κB pathway promote M2 macrophages
  polarization. In CD11b+ cells, high STAT6 expression promotes IL-4 secretion, leading
  to M2 polarization. In NSCLC cells, abundant NOX4 expression activates the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway, causing M2 polarization
