caption: FGF-10 stimulated HaCaT to activate FGFR2b signaling which increases IL1α
  expression through PKC-dependent pathway. HaCaT-derived IL1α induces expressions
  of K1, K6 and K16 thereby upregulating differentiation and proliferation of HaCaT.
  ALA-PDT generates ROS which were reversed the FGF-FGFR2b-mediated HaCaT signaling.
