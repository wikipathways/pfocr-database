caption: Schematics of nicotine degradation-related genes and metabolic pathways.
  (a) Genetic organization of gene clusters for modules Nic1, Spm, and Nic2 and for
  the nicotinic acid degradation pathway in the JY-Q genome. (b) Comparative scheme
  for pyridine, VPP, and pyrrolidine pathways found in representative strains capable
  of nicotine degradation. Highlighted is the pyrrolidine pathway of nicotine metabolism
  in JY-Q, which comprises three functional modules (Nic1, Spm, and Nic2, in red,
  blue, and gray shading, respectively) and the nicotinic acid degradation pathway
  (shaded in green). Nic1, nicotine to 3-succinoyl-pyridine (SP); Spm, SP to 6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-pyridine
  (HSP); Nic2, HSP to 2,5-dihydroxypyridine (2,5-DHP) and finally to succinic acid
  and fumaric acid. For nicotinic acid degradation, nicotinic acid (NA) is transformed
  into 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-HNA) by NicAB.
