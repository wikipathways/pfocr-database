caption: Tryptophan metabolism pathway alterations in breast tumor tissues compared
  to normal breast tissues. Log-scale differences in the major Trp metabolites in
  normal and breast tumor tissues are shown in the scatter plot graphs. The Trp metabolism
  pathway begins with the rate-limiting inflammatory cytokines, IDO and TDO, which
  involves cleaving Trp by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1/IDO2) or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase
  2 (TDO2) to form N-formylkynurenine. N-formylkynurenine is further metabolized by
  enzymes to kynurenine. The byproducts of Trp with microbiome metabolic origin or
  contribution, indoleproprionate (IPA) and indoxyl sulfate, are indicated by the
  dotted line. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.0005, **** p < 0.0001 is considered statistically
  significant.
