caption: Modes of MUC1 control of cellular inflammatory signaling pathways. (A) Infection
  causes TLR activation, causing production of inflammatory mediators, such as TNF.
  In turn, MUC1 is upregulated and suppresses TLR signaling, attenuating inflammation.
  Direct binding of pathogen to MUC1-ED induces phosphorylation of the MUC1 cytoplasmic
  tail, increasing MUC1-CT association with TLRs at the cell surface, or within the
  endosome, competitively inhibiting recruitment of MyD88 and/or TRIF to the TLR and
  blocks downstream signaling. (B) Upon detection of PAMPs by PRRs at the cellular
  membrane and within the endosome, the TLR becomes activated and induces the NF-kB
  transcription pathway, resulting in upregulation of pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18 and pro-caspase-1,
  ASC and NLRP3. A second stimulus then causes NLRP3 to nucleate ASC, inducing the
  characteristic speck-like structure and causes caspase-1 activation. Active caspase-1
  cleaves the pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, creating the active cytokines IL-1β and IL-18,
  which are then secreted from the cell. (C) Activation of the MUC1-CT after interaction
  with pathogen causes recruitment to the TLR, and/or subsequent signaling that limits
  TLR activation of the signaling cascade and blocks upregulation of inflammasome
  components. Whether MUC1-CT interacts with NLRP3 directly remains to be determined.
