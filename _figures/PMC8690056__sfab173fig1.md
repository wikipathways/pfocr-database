caption: NAD+metabolic pathways. NAD+ production from NAM or from NR consists of two
  steps, while production from niacin includes three enzymatic reactions and is known
  as the Preiss–Handler pathway. In contrast, NAD+synthesis from tryptophan through
  the kynurenine pathway requires six enzymatic steps to yield quinolinic acid, which
  is then transformed to NAMN that, in turn, is the precursor of NAD+ in the Preiss–Handler
  pathway. NAD+ levels can be decreased by enzyme such as CD38, CD157 and SARM1 (sterile
  alpha and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor motif-containing 1). CD38 also degrades NR
  and NMN []. Tryptophan may also be a source of uraemic toxins, which are either
  metabolites of the kynurenine pathway or of indole, which is generated by bacterial
  tryptophanase in the gut.
