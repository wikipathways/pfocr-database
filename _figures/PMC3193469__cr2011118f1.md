caption: The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for protein degradation. A polyubiquitin
  chain is synthesized via an enzyme cascade including E1, E2 and E3 enzymes, and
  removed by DUBs. The polyubiquitin chain serves as a tag to be recognized by the
  26S proteasome, which mediates the subsequent protein degradation. Both the ubiquitination
  and degradation are ATP-dependent processes.
