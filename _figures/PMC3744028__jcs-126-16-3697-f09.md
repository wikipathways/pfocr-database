caption: Summary of the proposed role of Pak1 in mediating stretch-induced CTGF upregulation.
  Pak1 activation is dependent on TβRI transactivation and activation of Rac1. Pak1
  regulates activation of the complementary signaling mediators Smad3 and RhoA/Erk.
  We previously showed RhoA/Rho-kinase-mediated Raf/MEK/Erk pathway activation through
  its cytoskeletal effects (). Erk contributes to Smad3 transcriptional activation.
  Whether it also enables CTGF upregulation through activation of transcriptional
  cofactors is yet to be determined.
