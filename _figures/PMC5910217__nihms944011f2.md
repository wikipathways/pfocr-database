caption: 'The interferon system. Following flaviviral infection, viral RNA is sensed
  by cellular pattern recognition receptors, including RLRs, which induce multiple
  transcription factors including the IRFs and NF-κB, leading to transcription of
  interferon. Interferon is secreted and binds the type I interferon receptor to activate
  the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway. STAT1 and STAT2 are phosphorylated and
  form a heterodimer that joins IRF9 to form ISGF-3. The ISGF-3 complex then binds
  to ISREs in the genome to promote expression of ISGs. DENV may evade the interferon
  system by multiple mechanisms, including degradation of STAT2, blocking of STAT1
  and STAT2 phosphorylation, suppression of STAT1 signaling, blocking of TBK1 phosphorylation,
  blocking of MAVS binding to RIG-I, induction of mitochondrial elongation linked
  to viral replication complexes, cleavage of mitochondrial fusion proteins, prevention
  of RIG-I translocation to mitochondria, binding of TRIM25, cleavage of STING, degradation
  of cGAS, and inactivation of host RNA-binding proteins. Abbreviations: ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; ISGF, interferon-stimulated gene factor;
  ISRE, interferon-stimulated response element; MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
  protein; RLR, RIG-I-like receptor; sfRNA, subgenomic flavivirus RNA; ssRNA, single-stranded
  RNA.'
