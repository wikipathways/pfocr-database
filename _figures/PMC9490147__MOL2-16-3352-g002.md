caption: 'Premature ageing syndromes associated with defects in DNA repair. This schematic
  shows different human diseases that are associated with defects in the following
  DNA repair pathways: the HR pathway, the NHEJ pathway, the BER, and NER pathways.
  Mutations in genes encoding key components of these repair pathways (highlighted
  in red) and their reduced expression result in a range of progeroid/premature ageing
  syndromes and cancers. Also shown are the clinical features of these disorders,
  some of which are common to different defective DNA repair pathways. Figure created
