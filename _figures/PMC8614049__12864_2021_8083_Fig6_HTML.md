caption: Diclofenac and Tr14 effects in relation to biological pathways of tissue
  homeostasis and repair. The physiological effects of NSAIDs, such as diclofenac,
  are shown schematically in the left panel, compared to the putative actions of Tr14
  in the right panel. NSAIDS have direct inhibitory on the cyclooxygenase enzymes,
  which alters numerous downstream eicosanoid actions on vasoconstriction/vasodilation,
  coagulation, chemotaxis, and inflammation/resolution. Tr14 does not directly inhibit
  COX enzymes, allowing a more natural wound repair process, but it does alter the
  mRNA levels for downstream enzymes in the pathway that might favor inflammation
  resolution
