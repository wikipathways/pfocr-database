caption: 'Molecular organization of the yeast cell wall (adapted from , doi: 10.1128/MMBR.00038-05;
  amended with permission from American Society for Microbiology). Chains of β-1,3-glucan,
  branched through β-1,6-linkages, form a mesh network that provides the mechanical
  strength of the cell wall and also serves as a scaffold for the attachment of cell
  wall proteins (CWPs). Pir-CWPs are attached directly to β-1,3-glucan through a Gln
  residue within their internal repeats that is converted to a Glu (E) residue in
  the linkage. These proteins have the potential to cross-link β-1,3-glucan chains
  through multiple repeat sequences. GPI-CWPs are attached to the network indirectly
  through a linkage between the lipidless GPI remnant (GPIr) and β-1,6-glucan. Chitin,
  a polymer of β-1,4-N-actetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), can be attached either directly
  to β-1,3-glucan on the inner surface or indirectly by β-1,6-glucan to the outer
  surface. The latter attachment is induced in response to cell wall stress. The nature
  of the linkage between β-1,3-glucan and β-1,6-glucan chains is still uncharacterized.'
