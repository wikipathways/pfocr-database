caption: Disruption of miRNA biogenesis by estrogens and cigarette smoke can lead
  to oncogenesis. 1, altered miRNA expression levels. Epigenetic changes/mutations
  in miRNA genes, and in genes responsible for miRNA transcription (insertions, deletions,
  translocations, inversions); 2, miRNA-processing machinery disruption. Alteration
  in the primary sequence of the pri-miRNA & RNAase III enzymes; 3, altered mRNA translation
  efficiency. With point mutation in mature miRNA and mRNA target sequence. The loss
  of tumor suppressor miRNAs may increase the translation of oncogenes and, thus,
  the formation of oncogenic proteins. By contrast, up-regulation of oncogenic miRNAs
  may block tumor suppressor genes that further enhance tumor development; a, in response
  to DNA damage, the p53/miRNA interconnection modifies the expression of miRNA genes
  in the nucleus; b, metabolites of environmental carcinogens bind to nucleophilic
  sites of miRNA precursors thus forming miRNA adducts, which cannot access the catalytic
  pockets of DICER in cytoplasm; c, metabolites of environmental carcinogens bind
  to DICER in the proximity of miRNA catalytic sites thus blocking maturation of miRNA
  precursors; I, Activation of EGFR by ERα or β leads to phosphorylation (P) of the
  adaptor protein Shc, which in turn associates with the GRB2–SOS complex, activating
  the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway. The activated ERK (p44/p42 MAPK) then migrates to the
  nucleus where it activates the transcription of genes that promote proliferation
  and invasion of NSCLC cells. Lung cancer cells predominantly express ERβ (). CSC,
  cigarette-smoke condensate; EGFR, EGF receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; GRB, growth factor receptor-bound protein; SOS, Son of
  Sevenless.
