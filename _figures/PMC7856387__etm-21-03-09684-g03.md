caption: Proposed protective effects of 4-MA against OGD/Rep-induced injury and associated
  mechanism. 4-MA inhibits the production of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6)
  and increased the expression of TJ proteins occluding and claudin-5, ameliorates
  OGD/Rep-induced brain microvascular endothelial barrier dysfunction through activating
  the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. After the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is activated,
  downstream eNOS is phosphorylated to produce a large amount of NO. NO can expand
  blood vessels, increase blood supply in ischemic areas and have a protective effect
  on the brain. BBB, blood-brain barrier; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL, interleukin;
  NO, nitric oxide; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase;
  OGD/R, oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion; 4-MA, 4-methoxybenzyl-alcohol; TJ,
  tight junction; p-, phosphorylated.
