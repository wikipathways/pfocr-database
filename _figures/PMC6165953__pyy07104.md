caption: 'Drug selectivity. (Top) Receptor selectivity is based on differential affinity
  for different receptor subtypes. Affinity of drugs A and B is reflected by the thickness
  of the arrows. As shown, drugs A and B have high affinity for the magenta colored
  receptor and low affinity for the green colored receptor. (Bottom) Functional selectivity
  is based on differential efficacy of a drug to regulate the activity of various
  signaling pathways coupled to a single receptor subtype. Signaling selectivity is
  illustrated as thickness of the arrows between the drug-activated receptor and the
  cellular signaling pathway. As shown, the selectivity profile for drug A is ERK>ß-arrestin>PLA2>PLC,
  whereas that for drug B is PLC>ß-arrestin>PLA2>ERK. If PLC signaling led to a therapeutic
  benefit and/or ERK signaling led to an adverse effect, drug B would be the preferred
  drug. Abbreviations: ß-arr, ß-arrestin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase;
  PLA2, phospholipase A2; PLC, phospholipase C.'
