caption: 'RA development presents four immune-related stages. First the mucosa stage
  with an intake by antigen-presenting cells (APC) of neo-epitopes corresponding to
  peptides post-transcriptionally modified at arginine by citrullinisation or at lysine
  by carbamylation or acetylation in the mouth and/or lung. Second the immunization
  stage, following APC migration to the secondary lymphoid organs, that involves T
  and B cells and leading to the production of anti-modified protein autoantibodies
  targeting mucosal neo-antigens. This step can be completed by the production of
  anti-peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) antibodies, antibody targeting bacteria involved
  in the neo-antigen process, and rheumatoid factors (RF), an anti-immunoglobulin
  G autoantibody. Third and joint step corresponding to an autoimmune arthritis with
  a synovial inflammation, which starts following joint leukocyte recruitment, synovial
  fibrin citrullinisation and fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) proliferation. Finally
  in the fourth step a chronic and systemic inflammation takes place involving the
  pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) and a dysregulation of the IL-6
  signaling pathway to produce joint damage, cartilage destruction, bone erosion and
  extra-articular manifestations. Abbreviations: HLA: human leukocyte antigen; ACPA:
  anti-citrullinated antibodies; aCarP: anti-carbamylated antibodies; aPgA: anti-Porphyromonas
  gingivalis antibodies; AaLtxA: anti-Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin
  A antibodies; PMN = polymorphonuclear granulocyte cells; MLS: macrophage-like synoviocyte;
  APC: antigen presenting cells.'
