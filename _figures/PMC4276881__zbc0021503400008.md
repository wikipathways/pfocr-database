caption: Wnt-5a ligand activates Wnt/Ca2+pathway and induces mitochondrial dynamics
  in post-synaptic regions. The synaptic architecture of the post-synaptic region
  is important for synaptic transmission; remodeling modifications and signaling pathways
  are fundamental for synaptic transmission and plasticity, and therefore the synaptic
  processes require an amount of energy. A, activation of the noncanonical Wnt signaling
  pathway through Wnt-5a ligand results in the release of intracellular calcium with
  the consequent activation of kinases (CaMKII and PKC) and phosphatases (calcineurin),
  calcium-dependent, followed by the modulation (phosphorylation-dephosphorylation
  steps) of Drp-1 protein and its accumulation on mitochondria, initiating the processes
  of mitochondrial fission and mobilization to sites of energy demand. B, increased
  mitochondrial dynamics involve fission-fusion process and mobilization of mitochondria
  to the dendritic spines in the post-synaptic region. The normal function of mitochondria
  ensure adequate energy levels for different cell processes, such as postsynaptic
  transduction. Wnt-5a has proven to be able to activate the Wnt/Ca2+pathway in the
  post-synaptic terminals of the CA1 region in rat hippocampus, and this activation
  appears now to be linked with an increased mitochondrial fission event plus the
  mobilization of small mitochondria to the required dendritic spine sites.
