caption: Upon growth factor and/or chemokine stimulation active PI3K phosphorylates
  phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate
  (PIP3). Duration and strength of the PIP3 signal is regulated by the PTEN or SHIP
  phosphatases that are converting PIP3 back to PIP2. PIP3 production leads to AKT
  recruitment to the membrane where it is phosphorylated atThr308 and Ser473 through
  PDK1 and mTORC2, respectively. Activated AKT inhibits TSC1/2 via TSC2 phosphorylation
  preventing it from bind RAS homolog enriched in brain (RHEB), causing activation
  of mTORC1 at the lysosomal surface and initiating its effect on many downstream
  proteins, including S6K and 4E-BP1. PTEN regulates activity of the PI3K pathway
  by converting PIP3 back to PIP2. Additionally upon the stimulation of the receptor
  tyrosine kinase RAS, RAF, MEK, and ERK are activated by sequential kinase activity
  that induces cell survival and proliferation Upon the growth factor stimulation
  AKT and JNK can be co-activated through RAS through the inhibition of PTEN transcription.
  Activation of either ERK1/2 or AKT leads to the phosphorylation of the FOXO and
  its exclusion from the nucleus which in turn decreases transcription of the FOXO
  target genes.
