caption: The interaction between differentially expressed genes involved in toll-like
  receptor signaling and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways (red—genes
  belonged to NF-kappa-B signaling pathway, and TIR domain; dark blue—I-kappa-B kinase/NF-kappa-B
  signaling, and interleukin-1 receptor binding; yellow—TNFR1-induced NF-kappa-B signaling
  pathway, and TICAM1 deficiency—HSE; purple—innate immunity; green—cytokine; light
  blue—inflammatory responses; String software; detected genes showed no more than
  five interactions).
