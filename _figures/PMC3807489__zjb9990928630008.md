caption: 'Proposed metabolic models for syntrophic growth of D. alaskensis G20 at
  the low growth rate of 0.027 h−1 with either M. maripaludis (A) or M. hungatei (B).
  Colors indicate transcriptional changes in individual genes during coculture growth
  relative to a sulfate-limited monoculture (the main electron transfer pathway in
  respective Desulfovibrio species is highlighted with red arrows); D. alaskensis
  G20 mutants with no growth in coculture on lactate are marked with the symbol “†”
  (the coculture mutant phenotypes with M. maripaludis were determined in an earlier
  study []). Abbreviations used: LctP, lactate permease; Ldh, lactate dehydrogenase;
  R-(SH)2 and R-SS, reduced and oxidized form of unknown thiol/disulfide redox pair
  (probably DsrC) interacting as electron carrier with Ldh; Por, pyruvate:ferredoxin
  oxidoreductase; Fdred and Fdox, reduced and oxidized form of ferredoxin; Qmo, quinone-interacting
  membrane-bound oxidoreductase; MQ, menaquinone; Qrc, quinone reduction complex;
  Pta, phosphate acetyltransferase; Ack, acetate kinease; Aor, aldehyde:ferredoxin
  oxidoreductase; Adh, alcohol dehydrogenase; Hdr-Flox, putative electron-bifurcating
  complex coupling NADH oxidation with reduction of thiol/disulfide redox pair (probably
  DsrC) and ferredoxin and vice versa (electron confurcation); Hmc, high-molecular-weight
  cytochrome c complex; Hyn, [NiFe] hydrogenase; Fdh, formate dehydrogenase; Hyd,
  [Fe] hydrogenase; TpIc3, type I cytochrome c3; Ssc, split-soret cytochrome c; CoA,
  coenzyme A.'
