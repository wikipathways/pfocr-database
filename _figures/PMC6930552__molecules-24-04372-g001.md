caption: Simplified scheme of sterol and BR biosynthesis. In sterol biosynthesis,
  squalene is converted in a series of reactions to 24-methylenelophenol, where the
  pathway splits into the C29-branch leading to β-sitosterol and stigmasterol as end
  products and into the C28-branch with campesterol, the precursor of BR biosynthesis,
  as a final product. In A. thaliana, the early C-22 oxidation pathway seems to be
  the predominant route of BR biosynthesis, which is, however, interconnected with
  late C-6 oxidation at multiple steps. The sterol synthesis pathway was adapted from
  [] and the BR biosynthesis pathway from [,,].
