caption: 'Blue circles symbolize AND connections. Inputs with default value 0 are
  indicated with red diamonds, inputs with default value 1 by green diamonds. Yellow
  diamonds stand for the outputs of the model. Gray hexagons represent the receptors
  (homodimers as well as heterodimers) and green hexagons stand for the 13 different
  ligands. Green ellipses symbolize reservoirs. The remaining species (symbolized
  with rectangles) are colored according to their function: red: kinases; blue: phosphatases;
  yellow: transcription factors; green: adaptor molecules; violet: small G proteins
  as well as GAPs and GEFs; black: other. The box in the upper part of the network
  contains binding of the ligands to the receptor and receptor dimerization, showing
  the high combinatorial complexity. Black arrows indicate activations, red blunt-ended
  lines stand for inhibitions. Dotted lines represent “late” interactions (with attribute
  τ = 2) that are excluded when studying the initial network response. Dashed lines
  indicate connections from reservoirs. Dummy species (see ) are not displayed.'
