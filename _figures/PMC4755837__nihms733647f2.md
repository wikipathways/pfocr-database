caption: A. Under normoxic conditions Ewing sarcoma cells constitutively express NPY
  and its Y1R and Y5R. Paradoxically, this autocrine loop is able to stimulate non-apoptotic
  programmed cell death mediated by the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/apoptosis inducing
  factor (PARP-1/AIF) pathway.B. Functions of NPY in Ewing sarcoma reverse under hypoxic
  conditions. Hypoxia further up-regulates expression of NPY and Y5R, induces expression
  of Y2R and stimulates activity of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), the enzyme converting
  NPY to a selective Y2R/Y5R agonist, NPY3-36. These hypoxia-induced changes lead
  to over-activation of the NPY/Y2R/Y5R pathway, resulting in proliferation and migration
  of Ewing sarcoma cells. Notably, these changes are the most apparent in Ewing sarcoma
  cancer stem cells (CSCs), known to be responsible to the tumor progression to a
  chemoresistant and metastatic phenotypes, implicating a role for the peptide in
  these processes.
