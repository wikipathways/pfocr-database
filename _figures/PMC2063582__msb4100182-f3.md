caption: Proteins involved in the target of rapamycin (TOR) and insulin signaling.
  To demonstrate the usefulness of our database, we compared the already known phosphoproteins
  (left) with our identified phosphoproteins (right). As can be seen, compared to
  the literature in which only 6 out of the 15 proteins were found to be phosphorylated,
  we extended the phosphorylation map to all proteins of the pathway (; ) (phosphorylation
  sites are depicted by the P in a red circle, the number assigns the number of distinct
  phosphorylation sites). The number of identified phosphorylations ranged from 1
  to 20 (CHICO). Peptides with P>0.8 and a defined phosphorylation site (dCn>0.1)
  were considered.
