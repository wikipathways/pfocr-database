caption: (I) FSH regulates induction of several WNT ligands, any of which may contribute
  to negative feedback regulation. Recent data provide evidence that FSH regulates
  transduction of a WNT signal which in turn upregulates Axin2 and FSH target genes
  via the β-catenin /TCF pathway. (II) Axin2 induction may subsequently exert an inhibitory
  effect on β-catenin to effectively shut down β-catenin/TCF gene transcription. Alternative
  negative modulators including FOXO1/3A and Chibby can prevent β-catenin transcriptional
  activity by binding it in the nucleus. (III) FSH binding to the G-protein coupled
  FSH receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase and promotes cAMP dependent PKA activity.
  This active kinase phosphorylates CREB to regulate expression of PKA target genes
  in granulosa cells. (IV) PKA also enhances the activity of PI3K leading to AKT phosphorylation.
  AKT phosphorylates FOXO leading to its export from the nucleus and releasing its
  inhibition on transcriptional activity of genes regulating granulosa cell proliferation
  and steroid production. Additionally, FOXO may bind to β-catenin in the nucleus
  to repress its transcriptional activity. This negative regulation could work to
  ensure that β-catenin remains controlled and its target genes are not overexpressed.
  (V) In addition, PKA regulates stability and activity of β-catenin by phosphorylation
  on Ser552 and Ser675 in granulosa cells providing a new layer of complexity to the
  intracellular mechanisms regulating follicle development.
