caption: MR suppresses gastric cancer development by inhibiting GSCSs. MR decreases
  the methylation of RAB37, resulting in the upregulation of RAB37 expression. Additionally,
  regulating the miR-200b/PKCα axis indirectly increased the activity of RAB37; then,
  binding it to autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5) induced the autophagy of GCSCs. MR
  decreases the methylation of miR-7, resulting in the upregulation of miR7 expression,
  leading to the inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways, eventually inhibiting gastric cancer invasion
  and metastasis. MR activates p53 signaling in GCSCs, selectively triggers apoptosis,
  and causes a decrease in the DNA methylation level of the miR-7-5p promoter region,
  thereby further promoting apoptosis in GCSCs
