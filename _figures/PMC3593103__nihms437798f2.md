caption: Once on endosomes, ubiquitinated CXCR4 is recruited into the degradative
  pathway by interacting with ESCRT-0 ubiquitin-binding domains. β-arrestin interacts
  with ESCRT-0 and may serve as adaptor for the E3 ligase AIP4 in order to ubiquitinate
  ESCRT-0. Ubiquitination of ESCRT-0 is likely to attenuate its sorting function by
  inducing an intramolecular conformation between the attached ubiquitin moiety and
  its ubiquitin-binding domain. Ubiquitinated CXCR4 is sorted sequentially to other
  elements of the ESCRT pathway and delivered into invaginating domains of endosomes/multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs) and intraluminal vesicles. β-arrestin may have additional roles that
  facilitate recruitment of ubiquitinated CXCR4 to ESCRT-0 and/or interact with other
  components of the sorting machinery to direct CXCR4 for lysosomal degradation.
