caption: The network of the cellular thiol redox system in multicellular eukaryotes.
  Glutathione (GSH) is synthesized in the cytosol via the de novo pathway (green box).
  The GSH salvage pathway (light blue boxes) occurs intracellularly via the reduction
  of GSSG by glutathione reductase (GR), and extracellularly through γ-glutamyl transferase
  (γ-GT) mediated degradation of exogenous GSH. The γ-GT activity generates cysteinylglycine
  (CysGly) and a gamma-glutamyl amino acid (γ-Glu-AA). CysGly is hydrolyzed by dipeptidases
  (DP) with the released cysteine (Cys) and glycine (Gly), which are taken up by peptide
  transporters (Pept) and become available for de novo GSH synthesis. The transsulfuration
  pathway provides an alternate source of cysteine via methionine. GSH is utilized
  by several major GSH-dependent enzymes; glutathione peroxidases (GPx) to reduce
  hydroperoxides; glutathione S-transferases (GST) to detoxify xenobiotic compounds
  by the formation of GSH conjugates (GS-x). These GSH-conjugates, and GSSG, can be
  exported from the cell via multidrug resistance proteins (MRP). Glutaredoxins (Grx)
  are primarily responsible for the de-glutathionylation of cysteine residues (PS-SG)
  present on proteins (P) and they can also reduce protein disulfide bonds, providing
  a backup for the thioredoxin system (not depicted in figure). The NADPH-dependent
  thioredoxin system (Trx/TrxR) functions by providing reducing equivalents for peroxiredoxins
  (Prx).
