caption: Transporters, pathetic flies and transceptors. (A) Schematic model of transporter
  switching between outward and inward facing conformations (upper and lower in gray),
  enabling molecules such as amino acids (AA) to be taken across lipid bilayers. The
  binding of such substrates is thought to stabilize an intermediate conformation
  (middle in red). Such transporters can function as symporters, co-transporting protons
  for some PATs and sodium ions for at least some SNATs. These ions determine the
  directionality of transport. (B) PAT amino acid transporter gene, pathetic, is required
  for normal growth in vivo. In comparison to normal controls (cont; middle fly) flies
  homozygous for the hypomorphic mutation, patheticKG06640 (KG/KG; lower fly) are
  small, or when heterozygous with a chromosomal deficiency (Df) removing the pathetic
  gene (KG/Df; upper fly) are even smaller. This small fly phenotype can be rescued
  by expression of a pathetic transgene. Mutations in other mTORC1 signaling pathway
  components also lead to small fly or small pupal phenotypes, for example, S6 kinase
  () and mTOR (). This panel is reproduced with permission from the journal Development
  (). (C) Schematic model showing how PATs and SNATs may act as transceptors to activate
  mTORC1. Note that the molecular mechanism by which PATs and SNATs act as transceptors
  is currently unknown. The binding and/or translocation of amino acids or other substrates
  by PAT and SNAT transporters presumably induces specific conformational changes
  that generate a signal. Here, for illustration, we assume this signal is transmitted
  in the intermediate conformation (red; A), which may be formed during the transport
  cycle. The transceptor conformation facilitates the recruitment of membrane-bound
  sensing complex components (already assembled in a complex; ), cytoplasmic sensing
  complex components and mTORC1 constituents. This leads to the formation of a functional
  sensing complex that can respond to amino acid signals from the lumen of the intracellular
  compartment (where extracellular amino acids can rapidly accumulate; ) to activate
  mTORC1 signaling and drive cell growth.
