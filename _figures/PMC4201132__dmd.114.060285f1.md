caption: A quantitative scheme of bupropion metabolism profile in humans. The percentage
  below each metabolite represents the percentages of the total oral bupropion dose
  (150 mg in this case) excreted in urine as a percentage of daily dose of bupropion
  as the compound at steady state. These numbers were estimated using a 24-hour urine
  collection. The quantitative aspects were estimated using the study published by
  . The metabolic pathway data were compiled from , , , , , , (, , and . More than
  20 bupropion metabolites have been identified; some poorly characterized secondary
  and tertiary metabolites are not shown on this figure. After 7 days of 150 mg/day
  bupropion treatment, the steady-state plasma level of bupropion is 29 ng/ml, OH-BUP
  is 400 ng/ml, EB is 32 ng/ml, and TB is 175 ng/ml (). However, these metabolites
  account for a very small percentage of the total bupropion dose in urine; this suggests
  that other uncharacterized bupropion metabolites may still be quantitatively important
  in bupropion clearance.
