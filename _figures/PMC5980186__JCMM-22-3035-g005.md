caption: Proposed model describing the regulatory pathway between Smad7 and hepcidin
  expression in hepatocytes. A, Under normal conditions, hepcidin expression is regulated
  by BMP6 signalling via a complex comprised of Smad4 and phosphor‐Smad1/5/8. Smad7
  inhibits hepcidin expression by targeting the Smad4‐phosphor‐Smad1/5/8 complex.
  B, Deletion of Smad7 in hepatocytes leads to increased hepcidin expression. C, During
  dietary iron overload, Smad6, Bambi and Follistatin assume the inhibitory function
  of Smad7, thereby functionally taking the place of Smad7 in inhibiting BMP‐Smad
  signalling
papertitle: Smad7 deficiency decreases iron and haemoglobin through hepcidin up‐regulation
  by multilayer compensatory mechanisms.
