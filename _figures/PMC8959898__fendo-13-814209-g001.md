caption: 'A concise representation of the hepatokines and adipokines presented in
  the article and their implications in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver
  disease according to the current studies. The diagram indicates the effect of hepatokines
  (FGF21, selenoprotein P, fetuin A, chemerin) and of the adipokines (visfatin, resistin,
  adiponectin, ghrelin), against the mechanisms that drive the pathogenesis of NAFLD,
  namely steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis and insulin resistance and also against
  the development of the metabolic syndrome, namely adipogenesis, inflammation and
  insulin resistance. The diagram depicts the following processes: a. The effects
  of organokines on liver inflammation: visfatin, chemerin, leptin, resistin, fetuin
  A activate the NF-kB and TNF-α/IL6 pathway and induce a proinflammatory effect mediated
  by Kuppfer cells (KCs). The previous organokines exhibit high concentrations in
  NAFLD. By comparison, adiponectin, FGF21 and ghrelin exert an anti-inflammatory
  effect. b. The effects of organokines on liver fibrosis: visfatin, chemerin, leptin,
  selenoprotein P mediate the release of TGF-β in hepatic stelatte cells (HSCs), while
  adiponectin and FGF21 exert an antifibrotic effect. c. The additive effect of organokines
  against the evolution of the metabolic syndrome: visfatin, chemerin and leptin promote
  the metabolic syndrome through their proinflammatory and proadipogenic effect, as
  well as through their role in the aggravation of insulin resistance. On the other
  hand, adiponectin and FGF21 play a protective role against the metabolic syndrome.
  Organokines can stimulate each other (e.g: adiponectin and leptin with FGF21) or
  inhibit each other (e.g: fetuin A, leptin, selenoprotein P, resistin with adiponectin).
  Organokines synthesized predominantly in the liver are presented in brown and those
  synthesized predominantly in the adipose tissue are presented in yellow. The correlations
  between these different organokines are shown in blue. The serum concentrations
  of these organokines in NAFLD (high or low) are represented by arrows. Vi, visfatin;
  Re, resistin; Fe, fetuin A; Le, leptin; Ch, chemerin; Ad, adiponectin; Gh, ghrelin;
  SeP, selenoprotein; Re, resistin; Mf, macrophage; HC, hepatic cell;  receptor.'
