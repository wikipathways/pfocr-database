caption: (A) Network of genes associated in morphine/extinction (score of 9; network
  associated to behavior, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction and nervous system
  development and function), (B) morphine/extinction-resistant (score of 9; network
  associated to cell-mediated immune response, cellular movement, hematological system
  development and function (C) morphine/sham-extinction groups (score of 25; network
  associated to behavior, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cell morphology,
  nervous system development and function). All measures were obtained using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA). Direct interactions are represented as solid lines, whereas
  indirect interactions appear as dotted lines. Upregulated and downregulated genes
  are represented by green and red lines, respectively.
