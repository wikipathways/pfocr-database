caption: Suggested mechanisms of synergistic cytotoxicity of [Gem+Clo+Ed] combination
  in lymphoma cells based on the previously reported data and our present results.
  Edelfosine accumulates in lipid rafts in the cell membrane, leads to formation of
  death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), activates the extrinsic apoptotic pathway
  through FADD and caspase (Casp) 8, and inhibits the AKT pro-survival pathway. Edelfosine
  also decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential leading to activation of the
  intrinsic apoptotic pathway through the release of pro-apoptotic factors from the
  mitochondria and activation of caspases 9 and 3. [Gem+Clo] combination, on the other
  hand, inhibits DNA synthesis and repair leading to a DNA-damage response and apoptosis
  via the intrinsic pathway. The combination of [Gem+Clo+Ed] magnifies the decrease
  in the mitochondrial membrane potential, production of ROS and activation of apoptosis.
  Furthermore, drug-mediated activation of the SAPK/JNK signal transduction pathway
  through upregulation of ATF2 and c-Jun leads to inhibition of survival.
