caption: Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways deregulated in systemic sclerosis (SSc).
  Representation of TLR pathways and downstream mediators following TLR4 activation.
  Deregulated Reactome pathwyas in SSc, either upregulated (in green) or downregulated
  (in red) according to the Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression
  (FAIME) method. TLR pathways are consistently upregulated in SSc (top). Downstream
  deregulated pathways include Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-adapter MyD88-related
  signalling; MyD88-independent signalling; TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing
  interferon-beta (TRIF) signalling; interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation
  following interaction of TRIF with noncanonical kinase TBK1; activation of the nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB) by the downstream mediators of MyD88, tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6) or via the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-activated kinase
  (TAK1); activation of the inflammasome by MyD88-dependent mechanisms; activation
  of the inflammasome NLRP3 (Cryopyrin); induction of apoptosis by inflammasomes;
  production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) by inflammasomes and IL-1 signalling (R-HSA-9020702,
  R-HSA-446652); downregulation of the negative feedback pathway constituted by phosphoinositide
  3-kinases (PI3K) and its downstream target serine serin/threonine kinase Akt (PKB)
  (R-HSA-109704).
