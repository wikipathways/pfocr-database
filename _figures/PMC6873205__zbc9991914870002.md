caption: Biosynthesis of shikimate-like products in animals. Similar enzymes DDGS
  and EEVS use substrate SH7P and convert it into cyclitols. The gadusol pathway is
  found in vertebrates and other animals, whereas the shinorine pathway is found in
  bacteria, with related pathways found in some animals. Colored dots show the origin
  of carbon atoms in SH7P. MT, methyltransferase; MT-Ox, methyltransferase-oxidase.
