caption: Illustration of the endogenous RNAi pathway and therapeutic mimics. Genome-encoded
  primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are processed by Drosha into pre-miRNAs that are
  then exported from the nucleus. In the cytosol, Dicer cleaves pre-miRNAs into miRNAs
  and a single-stranded guide RNA is incorporated into RISC. Depending on sequence
  homology between the guide strand and the target, RISC either cleaves the mRNA or
  causes translational repression. The RNAi pathway can be activated by synthetic
  siRNAs or shRNAs to therapeutically treat metabolic disorders, cancers, or viral
  infections. shRNAs delivered by viral vectors mimic pre-miRNAs while siRNAs mimic
  the native miRNA duplexes and are incorporated into RISC. shRNAs must be exported
  from the nucleus and siRNAs delivered using liposome-based technologies must escape
  from endosomal compartments before being processed. Accessory proteins involved
  are DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8), argonaute 2 (ago2), and HIV-transactivating
  response RNA-binding protein (TRBP).
