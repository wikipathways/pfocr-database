caption: Role of TAMs in spheroid formation, survival and metastasis. TAM-secreted
  VEGF binds to its receptor KDR/Flk-1 on endothelial cells, then decrease expression
  of junctional protein claudin-5 on endothelial cells, increase vascular permeability
  and contributes to ascites accumulation. Macrophages are recruited to ascites by
  soluble factors released by cancer cells including UBR5, M-CSF and POSTN, and chemokines
  released by TAMs, such as CCL18. TAM spheroids in ascites primarily detach from
  the primary tumor. TAM-derived EGF activates EGFR on cancer cells and increases
  expression of VEGF-C and VEGFR3 in cancer cells. EGF also increases the expression
  of αMβ2 integrin in TAMs and ICAM-1 in cancer cells to facilitate adhesion between
  TAMs and cancer cells. TAM-released chemokine CCL18 interacts with CCR8 to promote
  EMT of cancer cells. TAMs promote anoikis and drug resistance via the activation
  of STAT3 and Sonic hedgehog pathways and upregulation of P-gp and MRP1 in cancer
  cells and promote immune escape via suppressed phagocytosis of TAMs via SIRPα, inhibit
  T cell proliferation via B7-H4 and PD-L1 and increase Treg recruitment via CCL12.
  MIP-1β secreted by TAMs binds to CCR5, resulting in overexpression of P-selectin
  on the mesothelial cell surface. Cancer cells attached to P-selectin via CD24. TAM-derived
  soluble factors (such as FLT3L, leptin and HB-EGF) increase expression of MMP-9
  which mediates spheroid spreading and invasion. TAM, tumor-associated macrophage;
