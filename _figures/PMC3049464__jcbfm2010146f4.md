caption: Neuron-to-glia transcelullar aspartate efflux pathway for glial glutamate
  synthesis. Neuronal mitochondria are provided with Aralar/AGC1/Slc25a12 and the
  oxoglutarate carrier/OGC/Slc25a11 and carry out the malate-aspartate shuttle to
  transfer NADH reducing equivalents to the mitochondrial matrix. AGC1 is irreversible
  in polarized mitochondria and the main pathway of glutamate supply to the mitochondrial
  matrix. As cAST functions in the direction of glutamate formation in cells with
  an active malate-aspartate shuttle, mitochondria are the only site where aspartate
  is produced (in the mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase reaction), and aspartate
  leaves the matrix through AGC1 to reach the cytosol. De novo glutamate synthesis
  in astroglial cells takes place in the cytosol in the cAST reaction with aspartate
  as amino-nitrogen donor to α-KG. A second amino group (possibly arising from ammonia
  itself formed in neurons in the phosphate-activated glutaminase reaction) is acquired
  in the glutamine synthetase reaction and glial glutamine is now transferred to neurons
  along the glutamate–glutamine cycle (not shown). Oxaloacetate (OAA) arising from
  the cAST reaction is converted to malate, and malate entry in glial mitochondria
  along the OGC provides an alternative pathway for redox transfer to mitochondria,
  which partly compensates for the lack of a malate-aspartate shuttle in brain astrocytes.
  In this way, equivalent transfer to astroglial mitochondria is stoichiometrically
  related to de novo glutamate production. Alternatively, malate formed in astroglial
  cytosol may be transferred back to neurons, as malate is released to a higher extent
  from cultured astrocytes than from cultured neurons () (not shown). The presence
  of mitochondria in the fine peridentritic processes of astrocytes () indicates astrocytic
  oxidative capability near synapses. This confirms the reports by the Nedergaard
  group () and suggests that astrocytes need not be predominately glycolytic to supply
  their energy during brain activation. Indeed, the labeling of Asp C3 (Supplementary
  Figure 4) by [1-13C]glucose and its dilution by unlabeled AcCoA in the [1,2-13C]acetate
  study indicates that astrocytes oxidize glucose and must have some redox carrier
  system. AGC, aspartate–glutamate carrier; Asp, aspartate; Gln, glutamine; Glu, glutamate;
  α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; Mal, malate; OAA, oxalacetic acid; OGC, α-ketoglutarate–malate
  carrier; Pyr, pyruvate.
