caption: Summary of signaling pathways and molecular events induced by Chlamydia to
  promote inclusion development and EMT induction, leading to complications. Chlamydial
  elementary body (EB) binding to RTKs, such as EGFR, initiates host cell invasion
  and stimulation of cellular signaling cascades that include the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
  and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, leading to enhanced transcriptional and translational
  activities relating to cytoskeletal remodeling, initial inhibition of apoptosis
  (cell survival), and proliferation. Simultaneously, chlamydial EBs also bind the
  integrins on host cells via SH3-containing ligands, such as Ctad1, to activate the
  host cell signaling cascade involving the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and MEK/ERK
  pathway. In addition, chlamydia-induced Tsp1 and activated integrins convert latent
  TGF-β in the ECM into active TGF-β that binds the TGF-βR to activate the canonical
  Smad signaling pathways, leading to enhanced transcriptional and translational activities
  relating to cytoskeletal remodeling, cell survival, motility, and proliferation.
  The cross-talk among the different signaling pathways due to the transactivation
  between the effectors in the signaling cascades results in synergy and a boost in
  the cellular response. Thus, for successful infectivity with adequate inclusion
  development leading to disease, chlamydia orchestrates these multiple host cell
  signaling pathways to provide a supportive cytoskeletal environment, adequate nutrients,
  and cellular differentiation that culminates in pathological EMT underlying the
  infection complications.
