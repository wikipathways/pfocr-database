caption: A) KRAS promotes glucose metabolism in PDA cells by upregulating the GLUT1
  transporter and driving glycolysis through induction of the expression of multiple
  glycolytic enzymes. In addition, glycolytic intermediates are shunted toward biosynthetic
  pathways including the non-oxidative arm of the pentose phosphoate pathway (PPP)
  for synthesis of DNA and RNA and the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), which
  generates precursors necessary for generation of glycoproteins, glycolipids, proteoglycans
  and glycosaminoglycans. B) In addition, PDA cells have enhanced activity of monocarboxylate
  transporters, MCT1 and MCT4 that shuttle lactate in order to prevent intracellular
  accumulation and subsequent decreases in cytosolic pH. C) KRAS also activates and
  reprograms glutamine metabolism. A proportion of glutamate is utilized to fuel NAPDH
  production via the aspartate-malate shunt thus contributing to maintenance of reduced
  glutathione levels and redox balance. The enzymes whose expression levels are regulated
  by mutant Kras are indicated in blue.
