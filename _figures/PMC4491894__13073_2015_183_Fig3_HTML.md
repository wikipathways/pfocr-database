caption: Differential expression of a core set of genes whose products comprise a
  functional interactome is an underlying feature of chronically wounded RPE cells.
  The 565 genes with two-fold or greater differences in expression between 3-day P0
  and P5 cultures were analyzed using STRING 9.1 to identify genes whose products
  have experimentally determined protein-protein interactions (Experimental) or are
  part of a common curated pathway (Knowledge) and the resulting interactome was rendered
  using Cytoscape 3.0.2. The interactome is segregated into two sub-modules, one enriched
  for gene products involved in the cell cycle and the other for genes that are often
  associated with the response to wound stimuli. The line color indicates the nature
  of the connection with direct protein-protein interactions taking precedence over
  common pathway. The gene node color represents the log2 transformed P5:P0 gene expression
  ratio as determined by microarray analysis
