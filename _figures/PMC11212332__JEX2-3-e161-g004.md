caption: A proposed model showing modulation of the endocytic pathway by bacteria
  and OMVs under reciprocal regulation of SOCS1. Bacteria likely suppress phagosome
  maturation and lysosome fusion by upregulating the expression of the host SOCS1,
  as reported in Klopfenstein et al. (). On the contrary, phagosome maturation is
  likely enhanced by the downregulation of the host SOCS1 in response to OMVs treatment.
  The phagosome acquires Rab5 and EEA1 via fusion with early endosomes. Upregulation
  of EEA1 triggers fusion of the phagosome and late endosome. During the phagosome
  maturation process, a suite of other proteins is recruited, including Rab7, V‐ATPase
  and lysosome‐associated membrane glycoprotein (LAMP), which facilitates the fusion
  of lysosomes with the mature phagosome forming a phagolysosome. Degraded antigenic
  peptides by the proteasome (cytosolic pathway; not shown) are transported to the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and loaded onto MHC‐I molecules. Whereas degraded antigenic
  peptides by phagosome (vacuolar pathway) can be loaded onto itinerant MHC‐I molecules
  within the phagosome. Dashed arrows indicate processes suggested in this study,
  and solid arrows refer to processes supported by information from the literature.
