caption: 'Mass-spectrometry based analytical methods to study the role of metabolism
  in regulating ferroptosis. (A) The role of cysteine metabolism. Stable isotope-labeled
  serine and glutamine tracing approach are used to evaluate trans-sulfuration pathway
  and GCLC activity, respectively. The global metabolomics approach is used to analysis
  of γ-Glu-AAs. The cysteine and GSH is quantified after alkylating thiol group due
  to its high reactivity. (B) The role of radical-trapping antioxidant metabolism.
  CoQ10H2 and CoQ10 is quantified with an antioxidant to protect the auto-oxidation
  of CoQ10H2 during sample preparation and instrumental analysis. Also, the global
  metabolomics approaches are used to determine metabolic consequence of DHODH and
  GCH1 alteration, respectively. (C) The role of poly-unsaturated fatty acid metabolism.
  LC-MS/MS-based analysis including global lipidomics and targeted oxidized lipid
  analysis are applied to study role of poly-unsaturated lipid regulatory enzymes.
