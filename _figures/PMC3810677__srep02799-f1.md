caption: Regulation of the HIF pathway by oxygen dependant and independent mechanisms
  (a) Under normoxia, prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins use oxygen and α-ketoglutarate
  as substrates to hydroxylate conserved proline residues on HIF-α subunits. This
  allows binding of the VHL protein which recruits an ubiquitin ligase complex via
  Elongin C, leading to HIF-α ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Oxygen-independent
  control of HIF is mediated by RACK1 which also recruits Elongin C and directs the
  HIF-α subunits to the proteasome. PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways can increase translation
  of HIF-α mRNA in an oxygen-independent manner. In hypoxia, stabilised HIF-α subunits
  dimerise with HIF-β subunits enabling interaction with HREs in a wide range of gene
  promoters in the nucleus. The resulting pattern of transcription drives cellular
  responses to hypoxia such as angiogenesis and metabolic reprogramming, and can up-regulate
  the expression of multiple genes that contribute to cancer progression through survival,
  metastasis and invasion. (b) Structure of CL67.
