caption: Model for checkpoint signaling by S. cerevisiae checkpoint kinases. DNA damage
  activates Mec1 and Tel1 kinases, which directly and indirectly control a web of
  secondary kinases (Rad53, Dun1, and Chk1) and effector targets (1 to 5). Kinases
  involving trans-phosphorylation and autophosphorylation are activated (not shown
  for all kinases). After Rad53 is activated, one or several phosphorylated residues
  become a recognition motif for the Dun1 FHA domain. The ensuing transient association
  between the two kinases leads to trans-phosphorylation of Dun1 by Rad53. Activated
  Dun1 kinase may have specific effectors (target 3), or target overlap with Rad53
  kinase may lead to additional signal amplification (target 2). A postulated Rad53-independent
  pathway of Dun1 activation is indicated as Mec1/Tel1 controlling Dun1 kinase in
  a direct or indirect fashion. The mechanism of this pathway is not understood, but
  it may lead to signal-specific targeting of specific effectors (target 4). For details,
  see text.
