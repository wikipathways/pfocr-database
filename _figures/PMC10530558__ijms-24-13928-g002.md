caption: 'Glucose uptake and its catabolism take place through glycolysis. (A) The
  glycolysis pathway is linked with the tri-carboxylic acid pathway (TCA) for a full
  breakdown of glucose molecules. The cancer cells upregulate glycolytic enzymes,
  thus increasing pyruvate and lactate production. Pyruvate acts as an antioxidant,
  while lactate makes the cellular medium acidic, which helps in cancer growth. HIF-1a,
  MYC, KRAS, and several other oncogenic proteins are involved in accelerating the
  transcription of the much-needed glycolytic genes. The glycolysis in cancer cells
  differs from that in normal cells. In cancer cells, the breakdown of glucose is
  incomplete, and a large amount of lactate is generated (acronyms: GLUT1: glucose
  transporter 1, HK2: hexokinase 2, GPI: glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, PKM2: pyruvate

  indicates upregulation). (This figure was drawn using the Bio Render app). (B) The
  aerobic glycolysis/Warburg pathway is connected with several metabolic processes
  that sustain the cancer cells’ ability to survive in difficult environments. Other
  than the catabolic pathway, glycolysis is associated with cancer biomass synthesis
  and antioxidative mechanisms. The flow describes the association of glycolysis with
  various mechanisms.'
