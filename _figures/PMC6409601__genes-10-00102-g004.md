caption: Hypermodification of m5C34 in anticodon of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial
  tRNAs. (a) During the maturation of the cytoplasmic tRNALeu(CAA), an m5C34 modification
  is installed by NSUN2. The methylated RNA is spliced, followed by oxidation to hm5C
  and f5C, which occurs in the nucleus. The oxidation is catalyzed by ALKBH1. The
  RNA is exported to the cytoplasm, where the methyltransferase FTSJ1 installs an
  additional methyl group on the ribose 2’-OH to produce hm5Cm and f5Cm. (b) Structures
  of modified nucleotides at position 34 and the modification pathway. (c) Modification
  of mt-tRNAMet by NSUN3 and ALKBH1 occurs in the mitochondria. SAM = S-adenosylmethionine,
  SAH = S-adenosylhomocysteine, α-KG = alpha-ketoglutarate.
