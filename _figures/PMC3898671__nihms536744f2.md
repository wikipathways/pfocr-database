caption: Synthesis of the C5 isoprenoid precursors IPP and DMAPP. The plastidial MEP
  pathway from plants and eubacteria (shown in top diagram) leads to the production
  of both IPP and DMAPP (indicated in inset dashed-line box). A possible source of
  CDP-ME from the pentose phosphate pathway is also suggested. The MVA pathway from
  metazoa and fungi and a variation of the pathway found in archaea leading to the
  formation of IPP are illustrated in bottom diagram adapted from . HMG-CoA can also
  be obtained from branched-chain amino acid leucine via 3-methylglutaconyl CoA. IPP
  and DMAPP can be interconverted by IDI-1 or IDI-2. Adapted and reprinted with permission
