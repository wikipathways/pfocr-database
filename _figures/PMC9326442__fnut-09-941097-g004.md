caption: Summary of pathophysiological mechanisms of skeletal muscle wasting in PICS
  and related therapies. Many pathophysiological changes in PICS affect the function
  of skeletal muscle cells and contribute to skeletal muscle wasting in patients with
  PICS. Inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, induce protein degradation
  by activating the gp130/JAK/STAT3 and IKK/IKB/NF-κB signaling pathways, contributing
  to the production of ROS in muscle cells. Elevated inflammatory cytokines also inhibit
  the mTOR-mediated signaling pathway to decrease protein synthesis. Some hormones
  such as growth hormones are inhibited during PICS, which will cause decreased IGF-1
  levels and suppress the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Alterations in Escherichia
  coli, as a part of gut dysfunction, also lead to the suppression of the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway by inhibiting IGF-1 production. Hence, exercise and IGF-1 supplementation
  are encouraged for patients with PICS to activate the mTOR signaling pathway and
  promote protein synthesis. In addition, the expression of FOXO is upregulated in
  skeletal muscle cells, which can increase the activity of MAFbx and MuRF1, activating
  the ubiquitin-proteasome system as a result. The autophagy-lysosome system is also
  activated and the levels of autophagy-related genes are upregulated. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction contributes to the increase in ROS, which induces skeletal muscle wasting
  and hypercatabolism in PICS. Therefore, anti-inflammatory agents, anabolic and anti-catabolic
  agents, microbiota modulators, and antioxidants are recommended for patients with
  PICS. IL-6, interleukin 6; IL-6R, interleukin 6 receptor; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT3,
