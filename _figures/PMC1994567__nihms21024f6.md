caption: The flavoenzyme tryptophan 2-monooxygenase (TMO) from Pseudomonas savastanoi
  catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of L-tryptophan () in the first step of
  a two-step biosynthetic pathway for the plant hormone indoleacetic acid (–). The
  kinetic mechanism of TMO has been determined with its fastest substrate L-tryptophan
  (), and can be divided into two half-reactions (). The reductive half-reaction involves
  cleavage of the α-CH bond of the amino acid (AA) and transfer of a hydride equivalent
  to the FAD to form the enzyme-bound imino acid. This is identical to the reaction
  of the flavoprotein L-amino acid oxidases and similar to the general reaction of
  flavoprotein amine oxidases. In the oxidative half-reaction of TMO, the reduced
  cofactor reacts with oxygen to produce hydrogen peroxide (). Decarboxylation of
  the imine acid to the amide is thought to occur through the reaction of the hydrogen
  peroxide with the imino acid still bound to the enzyme (pathway a), analogously
  to the mechanism proposed by Lockridge et al. () for the decarboxylation of pyruvate
  by lactate oxidase. Although indoleacetamide is the only product of tryptophan turnover
  by wild-type TMO, amino acid oxidation can be uncoupled from decarboxylation to
  yield a keto acid in mutant enzymes (pathway b) (, ).
