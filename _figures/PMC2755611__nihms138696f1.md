caption: 'The overall rate at which cellular damage accumulates is regulated by multiple
  pathways (yellow components) and transcription factors (red) that adjust mechanisms
  for maintenance and repair. These transcription factors influence autophagy through
  modulating the activity of autophagy-related genes in the nucleus (for simplicity,
  the nucleus is not shown). Autophagy (brown) is the main cellular degradation process
  for eliminating or recycling damaged cellular constituents (the proteasomal system
  also plays an important role in eliminating damage and thereby in aging, but it
  is not shown here). Longevity pathways, which respond to diverse environmental cues
  such as nutrient availability, temperature and oxygen level, converge on the autophagic
  pathway to control aging. The chemical substance resveratrol is indicated by blue
  coloring, the mitochondrion is green. This figure illustrates the mammalian counterparts
  of signaling and metabolic components involved in aging. Several interrelationships
  among these components have only been demonstrated thus far in model organisms.
  Arrows (activations) and bars (inhibitions) indicate direct interactions that have
  been experimentally confirmed. However, not all the indirect interactions have as
  yet necessarily been demonstrated (e.g., it is unknown whether Sirt1/2 regulate
