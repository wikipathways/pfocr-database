caption: Impact of 14 days of circadian disruption on hepatic transcriptome signatures
  of late gestation dry dairy cows. Functional annotation and pathway analysis of
  the 834 genes differentially expressed in liver between control (CON, n = 6) and
  phase-shifted (PS, n = 6) treated cows at P < 0.05 found that genes downregulated
  (green) by circadian rhythm disruption enriched cholesterol efflux and constituent
  of ribosome. Whereas genes that were upregulated (red) in PS cattle enriched cholesterol,
  fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis, unfolded protein binding, endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress, would healing, and inflammatory response. Also upregulated
  were the core clock genes PER1 and CRY2, and the β-adrenergic receptor, ADRB2.
