caption: Regulation of LTP and memory by Rac1 in APP mice. In normal animals, Ca2+
  influx from NMDA receptors activates Rac1 and multiple downstream signaling processes,
  including PAK-LIMK-cofilin pathway, to modulate actin reorganization, AMPA receptor
  trafficking and LTP expression. In APP mice, accumulation of Aβ peptides may lead
  to abnormal activation of NMDA receptors and hyperactive Rac1, which causes dysregulations
  of downstream proteins, including PAK, LIMK and cofilin, to impair LTP and memory.
  Expression of Rac1-N17 in hippocampal neurons reduces Rac1 activity and restores
  the function of some of its downstream proteins such as PAKs, thus improving LTP
  and memory in APP mice.
