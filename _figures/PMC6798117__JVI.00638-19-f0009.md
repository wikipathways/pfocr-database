caption: Model depicting the effects of ZIKV infection on cell cycle progression in
  hNPCs. In this study, we demonstrate that ZIKV infection of neural progenitors causes
  DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and suppresses activation of the ATR/Chk1 signaling
  pathway, resulting in induction of the DNA damage response (DDR) via the ATM/Chk2
  signaling pathway. Activation of ATM and the subsequent Chk2-mediated signaling
  cascade leads to the phosphorylation of the DNA damage repair proteins H2A.X and
  53BP1 and degradation of the S-phase regulatory and effector proteins CDC25A, cyclin
  A, and cyclin E, culminating in an S-phase arrest environment that fosters productive
  ZIKV replication.
