caption: Model of the regulation of Nedd4-1 by the PI3K/PTEN-mTORC1 signaling pathway
  during neurite growth. PI3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of PtdInsP2 to generate
  PtdInsP3 (e.g., in response to growth factor or hormone stimulation). PTEN converts
  PtdInsP3 back to PtdInP2 and thus antagonizes the effect of PI3K. Elevated PtdInsP3
  levels lead to the phosphorylation of AKT, which further phosphorylates GSK3β and
  mTORC1. The phosphorylation of GSK3β promotes axon acquisition in neurons (). On
  the other hand, AKT-dependent activation of mTORC1 stimulates downstream pathways
  that include the protein translation machinery. Nedd4-1 is important for neurite
  outgrowth but dispensable for axon acquisition, and its mRNA is a prominent target
  of regulation by mTORC1 at the translational level. Nedd4-1 is not responsible for
  PTEN ubiquitination or regulation in developing mammalian neurons.
