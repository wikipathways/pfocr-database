caption: Schematic overview of the molecular mechanisms involving the interaction
  between the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and NRP1, DPP4, and CD147 cellular receptors. NRP1
  (in red) can function as either a co-receptor or a receptor, depending on the tissue
  or cell type. DPP4 (in red) may facilitate the S protein binding to ACE2 (in red),
  and CD147 (in red) can eventually act as a receptor. Additionally, both DPP4 and
  CD147 (in red) can promote the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, VEGF, and
  the activation of NRP1. The interaction between VEGF, VEGF-R2, and NRP1 can stimulate
  angiogenesis and cell migration. Moreover, elevated VEGF levels can activate ADAM9/10
  metalloproteinases, which leads to the release of both the extracellular domain
  and the cytoplasmic tail of NRP1, thereby disrupting the VEGF-NRP1 signaling pathway.
