caption: Current models for divisome assembly and activation. In these models, the
  division proteins (Fts) are indicated with capital letters and some proteins are
  not depicted for simplicity. (A) The linear sequential divisome assembly pathway
  based on depletion studies. FtsZ polymers anchored to the membrane by FtsA and ZipA
  (not shown) coalesce into a Z ring at the future division site. The ABC transporter-like
  complex FtsEX localizes to the Z ring immediately. After roughly one-third of the
  cell cycle, the downstream division proteins FtsK, FtsQ, FtsL, FtsB, FtsW, FtsI,
  and FtsN are recruited to the Z ring sequentially. FtsQ, FtsB, and FtsL form a tight
  complex and are pictured as a complex. Similarly, FtsW and FtsI are pictured as
  a complex. The cytoplasmic (NFtsN) and essential (EFtsN) domains of FtsN are colored
  red and yellow, respectively. (B) Model for FtsN-triggered divisome activation adapted
  from ref. . In this model, the divisome is kept inactive by FtsA and FtsQLB before
  FtsN arrives at the Z ring. Interaction between NFtsN and FtsA switches FtsA to
  the on state and brings EFtsN to the divisome complex to derepress the FtsQLB complex.
  Together, these two activation signals converge to activate FtsI (indicated with
  a red star) to start septal PG synthesis.
