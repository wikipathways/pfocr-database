caption: Microbial inflammation is interwoven with metabolic inflammation. Polymicrobial
  causes (viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa) evoke two signaling pathways (proinflammatory
  and metabolic). These pathways can be independently targeted by new, pathway selective
  NTMs, cSN50.1α and cSN50.1β, that respectively bind nuclear transport shuttles,
  Imp α5 and Imp β1, to modulate Imp α5-mediated nuclear import of stress responsive
  transcription factors (SRTFs), and Imp β1-mediated nuclear import of metabolic transcription
  factors (MTFs) such as SREBPs. Transcription factors ChREBPs can be imported to
  the nucleus either by heterodimeric complex Imp α5/Imp β1 or by Imp β1 alone. Inhibition
  of nuclear transport of SRTFs reduces expression of genes encoding mediators of
  inflammation, cytokines, chemokines, signal transducers, and cell adhesion molecules
  (see Fig. ). Inhibition of ChREBPs, that regulate genes encoding proteins involved
  in glucose homeostasis, reduces hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia, inhibition
  of nuclear transport of SREBPs reduces expression of genes encoding proteins involved
  in synthesis of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty acids. The accumulation of
  these metabolites can activate proinflammatory pathway mediated by NF-κB RelA and
  other SRTFs thereby aggravating microbial inflammation (see text for details; NPS
  nuclear pore complex).
