caption: Heat map of metabolite changes in the laminae of oilseed rape leaves during
  senescence. Leaf laminae were harvested from plants grown under low (LN) or high
  (HN) nitrate conditions. Metabolite concentrations were determined as the peak area
  in GC-MS analyses normalized to sample fresh weight. Log2 of the ratios of the metabolite
  concentrations to their value in the youngest leaf of the high nitrate treatment
  (HNL15) are presented on a metabolic pathway representation by shades of red or
  blue colours according to the scale bar. The stage of senescence of each leaf rank
  is indicated by shades of colours from yellow (more senescent old leaf) to green
  (less senescent young leaf) according to the scale bar. Data represent mean values
  of four biological replicates for each leaf rank and time point. L3 to L11 or L15,
  laminae of leaf ranks from the oldest (L3) to the youngest L11 and L15 for LN- and
  HN-grown plants, respectively.
