caption: 'Schematic model of Nrf2 regulation by Keap1. Keap1 is a key regulator of
  the Nrf2 signaling pathway and serves as a molecular switch to turn on and off the
  Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response. (i) The switch is in off position: under basal
  conditions, Keap1, functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, constantly targets Nrf2
  for ubiquitination and degradation. As a consequence, there are minimal levels of
  Nrf2. (ii) The switch is turned on: oxidative stress or chemopreventive compounds
  inhibit activity of the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in increased
  levels of Nrf2 and activation of its downstream target genes. (iii) The switch is
  turned off again: Upon recovery of cellular redox homeostasis, Keap1 travels into
  the nucleus to remove Nrf2 from the ARE. The Nrf2-Keap1 complex is then transported
  out of the nucleus by the NES in Keap1. In the cytosol, the Nrf2-Keap1 complex associates
  with the Cul3-Rbx1 core ubiquitin machinery, leading to degradation of Nrf2. For
  clarity, the constitutive cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of Nrf2, Keap1, and the
  complex is omitted.'
