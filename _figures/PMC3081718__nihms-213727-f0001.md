caption: History and metabolites of 5-FU. (A) A timeline of the genesis of the relationship
  between 5-FU and TS. (B) The metabolic pathway to FdUMP. On the left of the figure
  we show the main metabolic pathways to the 5-FU metabolite FdUMP. TP is thymidine
  phosphorylase; TK is thymidine kinase; OPRT is orate phosphoribosyltransferase;
  RR is ribonucleotide reductase. Note that the common pathway in cancer cells metabolize
  5-FU to FdUMP is through ribonucleotide reductase. On the right is a simple schematic
  showing the central dogma of the most publicized 5-FU resistant mechanism. Increase
  numbers of TS molecules (top) in a cell will be able to resist FdUMP; while low
  amounts of TS in a cell will be inhibited by FdUMP (bottom) causing cellular death.
