caption: 'The cellular mechanism of VC, ATO and their co-treatment. (a) Increased
  uptake of DHA through GLUT1 causes oxidative stress as intracellular DHA is reduced
  to VC, depleting the pool of reduced GSH. This leads to oxidative stress with increased
  ROS production. The accumulation of ROS inactivates GAPDH, which in turn, in highly
  glycolytic KRAS-mutant cancer cells, leads to decreased glycolysis and ATP followed
  by an energetic crisis and subsequent cell deaths. In addition, the response to
  low GSH and NADPH and subsequent ROS production PARP is activated and NAD+ is decreased,
  leading to further inhibition of GADPH. (b) The main effect of ATO is to oxidize
  GSH so one molecule of ATO binds four molecules of oxidized GS (GS)2-ATO-(GS)2.
  A small portion of ATO enters the mitochondria, where it oxidizes the mitochondrial
  proteins, which leads to ROS production. (c) VC and ATO combination acts synergistically
  to enhance oxidative stress to cytotoxic effect. The VC depletes GSH by oxidizing
  it; thus ATO acts without much interference from GSH on the mitochondria by carrying
  out a direct intense oxidation of their Fe-S clusters, mostly located in OXPHOS
  complexes representing the respiratory electron transport chain. The heavy oxidation
  of the Fe-S clusters on OXPHOS impairs mitochondrial function triggering suicidal
  ROS production by mitochondria (SRPM) with subsequent release of cytochrome C from
  mitochondria and initiation of the apoptotic pathway and cell death. Abbreviations:
  GSH, glutathione (reduced); GS, glutathione (oxidized); ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PARP, poly ADP-ribose polymerase;
  SRPM, suicidal ROS production by mitochondria.'
