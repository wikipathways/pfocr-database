caption: Signaling crosstalk between myeloid C-type lectins and heterologous receptors.
  Signaling pathways initiated downstream of C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) interact
  with surrounding cascades triggered by heterologous receptors. Examples of such
  crosstalk are illustrated. (A) Dectin-1 coordinates with simultaneous signals from
  diverse TLRs to modulate the inflammatory response; this interaction can be either
  positive, as for TLR2/MyD88 (left), or negative, as for TLR9 through a Pyk2/ERK/SOCS-1-dependent
  pathway (right). (B) In addition, the axis Dectin-1/PI3K/mTOR/Hif-1α generates a
  switch toward glycolytic metabolism together with an epigenetic footprint, allowing
  for a “deferred” improved response to TLRs, boosting the inflammatory response.
  This process is known as trained immunity. (C) A full inflammatory response against
  Fonsecaea pedrosoi is achieved by synergistic stimulation between Mincle and ligands
  for TLRs coupled to the MyD88 adaptor (left). However, simultaneous recognition
  of Fonsecaea monophora by Mincle and Dectin-1 triggers a Mincle-PKB-Mdm2-dependent
  degradation of Dectin-1-activated IRF1, dampening the expression of protective IL-12p35
  (right). (D) DC-SIGN recognition of Fasciola hepatica enhances TLR-induced IL-10
  and IL-27p28 (left). Moreover, DC-SIGN sensing of the salivary protein Salp15 from
  the tick vector Ixodes scapularis dampens inflammatory responses triggered by Borrelia
  burgdorferi through TLRs (right). Both examples illustrate strategies to escape
  immune surveillance based on inhibition of T cell proliferation.
