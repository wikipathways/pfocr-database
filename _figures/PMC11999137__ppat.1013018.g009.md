caption: GS143 treatment results into accumulation of (1) IκBα and β-catenin by inhibition
  of their interaction with β-TrCP. [2] Inhibition of basal NFкB signaling leads to
  the downregulation of cIAP2, which in turn leads to the stabilization of NFкB inducing
  Kinase (NIK) and phosphorylation IкB kinases (IKK). [3] NIK phosphorylates and activates
  IKKɑ/β. Thus, GS143 partially activates non-canonical pathway that does not culminate
  into the processing of p100 leading to the release of the p52 and subsequently nuclear
  translocation of p52-RelB. GS143 interferes with β-TrCP-mediated processing of p100.
  [4] Activation of IKK leads to phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536 located in the
  transactivation domain. This modification is shown to reduce the affinity of p65
  for IкBɑ and p50 and promote its nuclear translocation and DNA binding that could
  lead to HIV-1 reactivation. [5] β-catenin supports p65 output in the nucleus possibly
  by promoting acetylation of p65. SMAC-mimetic AZD5582-mediated activation of non-canonical
  NFκB signaling pathway is also shown
