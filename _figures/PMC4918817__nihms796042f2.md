caption: (A)During homeostasis most satellite cells are quiescent. (Aa) The Notch
  signalling pathway plays a key role in enforcing satellite cell quiescence. Upon
  ligand/receptor binding, the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD, pink oval) undergoes
  several proteolytic cleavages (not shown), and then translocates to the nucleus
  where it interacts with the Recombining Binding Protein J-κ effector protein (RBPJ-κ,
  blue circle). The NICD:RBPJ-κ complex activates expression of target genes, including
  the Hes and Hey family of transcription factors, which function to inhibit MYOD.
  RBPJ-κ also binds the promoter of Pax7 and induces its expression. PAX7 induction
  further downregulates MYOD via transcription-independent mechanisms (not shown).
  The Forkhead  (FOXO3, green circle) transcription factor can induce expression of
  NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 trans-membrane proteins, which facilitates Notch signalling by
  ensuring an adequate number of receptors are produced and shuttled to the cell membrane
  where they can interact with available ligands in the local environment. (Ab) Satellite
  cell entry into the cell cycle is inhibited through the activities of p27Kip1, which
  inhibits cyclin-dependant kinases (CDKs). (B) After muscle injury, activated satellite
  cells detect pro-myogenic stimuli from the local environment and begin proliferation.
  (Ba) Exposure to FGF2 induces p38α/β mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity,
  which inhibits the RNA-binding destabilizing protein, Tristetraprolin (TTP), leading
  to stabilization of the MyoD mRNA. This allows MYOD protein to accumulate (purple
  circle) and induce expression of Cdc6, a DNA replication gene that promotes cell
  cycle entry and thus proliferation. (Bb) Another activation regulator, MYF5, is
  post-transcriptionally repressed by miRNA-31 (miR-31), which sequesters Myf5 mRNA
  into RNA granules in quiescent satellite cells (QSCs) and prevents activation of
  MYF5 targets. Upon muscle trauma, the RNA granules dissociate, miRNA-31 levels decrease,
  and MYF5 protein is produced and can activate target genes. (Bc) The Myf5 gene is
  also transcriptionally regulated through the activities of CARM1 (pink circle),
  an arginine methyl-transferase that methylates PAX7 (small purple circles on the
  light blue circle) leading to PAX7 association with the Histone Acetyl-Transferase
  complex (HAT, purple complex), and the induced expression of target genes (such
  as MYF5) in activated satellite cells (ASCs). (C) Satellite cells are capable of
  self renewal. (Ca) A balance between self-renewal and differentiation of satellite
  cells is acheived by the mode of cell division. Apico-basal divisions generate one
  self-renewing (red, Myf5-) and one differentiating cell (blue, Myf5+). On the other
  hand, planar divisions (parallel to the muscle fiber) are symmetric and generate
  two daughters that retain self-renewal capabilities. (Cb) Self-renewal of satellite
  cells can be followed by their return to quiescence. FOXO3 induces expression of
  Notch signalling genes, enabling the cascade of molecular events leading to the
  inhibition of MYOD-mediated differentiation and blockade of cell cycle progression.
  (Cc) The return to quiescence also requires Sprouty1 (Spry1), a tyrosine kinase
  inhibitor that inhibits FGF signalling, thereby restricting cellular proliferation.
