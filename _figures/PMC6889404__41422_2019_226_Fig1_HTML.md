caption: hnRNPA2B1, an RNA-binding protein, can function as an m6A reader and is involved
  in RNA transport, processing or splicing. Upon recognition of viral DNA, hnRNPA2B1
  dimerizes and then is demethylated by JMJD6, which results in nucleocytoplasmic
  translocation of hnRNPA2B1 and consequently the activation of TBK1-IRF3 pathway.
  In parallel, hnRNPA2B1 promotes RNA m6A modification, nucleocytoplasmic trafficking,
  and translation of cgas, Ifi16 and Sting mRNAs to amplify the antiviral innate immune
  response
