caption: RLR-mediated pathways of type I interferon and inflammatory responses. The
  interaction of dsRNA as a viral genome or as a replication intermediate of RNA viruses
  with the helicase domain of RLRs (RIG-I or MDA5) induces association of the CARD
  domains of RIG-I/MDA5 and the adaptor protein IPS1 localized to the mitochondrial
  membrane. This receptor-adaptor interaction results in the activation of TBK1 and
  the subsequent phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7 on specific serine residues, resulting
  in their homodimerization. These dimers can translocate to the cell nucleus and
  activate the transcription of type I IFN genes. The expression of IRF3, IRF7, RIG-I
  and MDA5 is coordinately upregulated by type I IFN-mediated signaling acting as
  an amplification circuit. This pathway together with IPS1 is coupled to the NF-κB
  signaling pathway through the interaction of FADD (FAS-associated via death domain),
  RIP1, and TRAF6 resulting in the induction of inflammatory cytokine genes, such
  as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα. The TRIM proteins shown act as specific regulators of this
  pathway.

    The interaction of dsRNA as a viral genome or as a replication intermediate of
