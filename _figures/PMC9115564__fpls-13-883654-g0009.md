caption: A model of the function of FAR1/FHY3 under salt stress (modified from Halfter
  et al., ; Shi et al., ; Zhou et al., ). Under high/low salt stress, due to different
  response activities, different FAR1/FHY3 genes were activated successively to further
  activate downstream salt stress-induced genes, and then achieved Na+ balance inside
  and outside the vacuole and cell membrane through SOS pathway.
