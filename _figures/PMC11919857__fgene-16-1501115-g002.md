caption: Two subtype views of lncRNA-NEAT1 gene. Schematic diagram of the generation
  and functions of the two subtypes of the lncRNA - NEAT1 gene. Researchers Sun et
  al. (2018) used gene - editing techniques (such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system) to edit
  the NEAT1 gene in human cell lines (such as HEK293T cells), and analyzed transcript
  changes by RNA sequencing (RNA - seq) to determine the generation pathways of NEAT1_1
  and NEAT1_2. Fluorescent labeling combined with confocal microscopy was used to
  track the localization and functional manifestations of the two subtypes within
  cells. Functional verification experiments included silencing or overexpressing
  NEAT1_1 and NEAT1_2, and detecting changes in relevant indicators such as cell stress
  (Zhang J. et al., 2019), viral infection (Li et al., 2020a) and tumor cell proliferation
  (Wang Z. et al., 2023)
