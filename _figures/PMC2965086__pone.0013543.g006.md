caption: Illustration of pathway differences between FLT3-ITD and FLT3-WT samples.
  Red coloring of readouts and bold lines indicate increased pathway activity. White
  coloring and non-bold lines indicate decreased pathway activity. Dotted line from
  FLT3L to p-Stat5 in FLT3-WT samples indicates connectivity in a subset of patients.
  Red “X” indicates DNA Damage. Faded modulators (FLT3L, IL-27) in FLT3-ITD indicate
  decreased modulator induced signaling.
