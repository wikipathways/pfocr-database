caption: Schematic illustration of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury of the myocardium.
  Prolonged ischemia reperfusion elicits serious injury to the microvascular segment
  of coronary circulation. Among others, perfusion pressure decreases, glycocalyx
  degrades, endothelium became impaired, and increased leucocyte adhesion as well
  as platelet aggregation occurs. Moreover, during ischemia some of the endothelial
  cells become necrotic and together with other cells produce debris. All of these
  events reduce the diameter of microvessels’ lumen. In addition, reperfusion initiates
  a series of events, including increased level of endothelin-1 and asymmetric dimethylarginine
  (ADMA), the latter activates the vascular renin angiotensin system followed by activation
  of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase and increased superoxide
  as well as peroxynitrite production, and increases constrictor prostanoid level,
  all of which constrict microvessels. In subsequent pro-inflammatory conditions cytokines
  are produced, initiating a full inflammatory response, apoptosis, and necrosis.
  Elevated levels of ADMA contribute to these events by blocking and uncoupling endothelial
  nitric oxide synthases (eNOS)/inducible NOS (iNOS) leading to superoxide production
  and thus exogenous L-arginine may provide beneficial effects.
