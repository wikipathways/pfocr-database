caption: 'Overview of the metabolic remodeling in EGFR-mutant LUAD and the proposed
  treatment strategies for circumventing the EGFR TKI resistance. EGFR TKI-resistant
  LUAD cells secrete lactate, which is incorporated by CAFs located in TME, leading
  to overproduction of HGF ligands and subsequent activation of MET signaling and
  its downstream oncogenic effectors such as Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk signaling pathway. Moreover,
  the FASN-mediated EGFR palmitoylation allows the maintenance of EGFR constitutive
  signaling in EGFR TKI-resistant cells. Abrogation of palmitic acid synthesis using
  the anti-obesity drug orlistat (FASN inhibitor) promotes EGFR degradation. The use
  of statins such as ATV significantly downregulates the cholesterol levels, decreasing
  glucose uptake and lipogenesis simultaneously in EGFR-mutant LUAD. Further restriction
  of fatty acid synthesis by inhibiting SREBP1 using PF-429242 impairs both the levels
  of FASN and LDLR. Interestingly, blocking the PDHK1-mediated phosphorylation of
  PDH by treating EGFR-mutant LUAD cells with DCA shifts the glucose metabolism towards
  oxidative phosphorylation, preventing the accumulation of lactate, which has been
  correlated with EGFR TKI resistance. Furthermore, EGFR TKI-resistant cells have
  elevated levels of glutathione, the master antioxidant, thus efficiently scavenging
  ROS, escaping oxidative stress and cell death. Treatment with drugs such as epalrestat
  and BSO reduces glutathione synthesis, allowing ROS accumulation which eventually
  leads to ROS-mediated cell death in EGFR TKI-resistant models. Finally, epigenetic
  downregulation of SDH activity by miR-147b induces TCA cycle arrest and increased
  levels of succinate in EGFR TKI-tolerant cells. Abbreviations: CAF, cancer-associated
