caption: Control of c-di-GMP by the QS system of Vibrio cholerae. QS-mediated control
  of c-di-GMP in V. cholerae occurs at multiple levels. At low cell density, the levels
  of AIs AI-2 (brown double pentagons) and CAI-1 (orange double triangles) are low,
  causing the LuxPQ (pink) and CpqS (blue) histidine kinase receptors to ultimately
  phosphorylate the response regulator LuxO (gray; not all steps in this pathway are
  shown). Phosphorylated LuxO activates the expression of qrr sRNAs, which repress
  HapR expression by destabilization of hapR mRNA. HapR (orange) is the master high-cell-density
  regulator of V. cholerae. Qrr sRNAs also activate expression of VCA0939, a GGDEF
  domain-containing protein, by stabilizing its transcript. In the low-cell-density
  state, the levels of c-di-GMP (red triangles) in the cell are high. VpsR (purple)
  and VpsT (green), two transcriptional activators that directly bind to c-di-GMP,
  positively regulate biofilm genes. Also, expression of AphA (blue), the master QS
  low-cell-density regulator, is induced by VpsR and c-di-GMP to activate low-cell-density-expressed
  genes. Virulence factor expression is also induced by AphA but thought to be repressed
  by c-di-GMP, and this contradiction is not currently understood. At high cell densities,
  the increase in AI-2 and CAI-1 levels reverses the flow of phosphate in the QS cascade,
  leading to decreased qrr sRNA expression. The lack of qrr sRNAs increases HapR protein,
  which then regulates the transcription of multiple GGDEF, EAL, and HD-GYP enzymes,
  both positively and negatively, to decrease c-di-GMP levels in the cell. HapR also
  directly represses vpsT and aphA expression, decreasing biofilm formation, virulence
  factor expression, and low-cell-density gene expression. The expression of high-cell-density
  genes is increased by the presence of HapR.

  description: Control of c-di-GMP by the QS system of Vibrio cholerae. QS-mediated
    control of c-di-GMP in V. cholerae occurs at multiple levels. At low cell density,
    the levels of AIs AI-2 (brown double pentagons) and CAI-1 (orange double triangles)
    are low, causing the LuxPQ (pink) and CpqS (blue) histidine kinase receptors to
    ultimately phosphorylate the response regulator LuxO (gray; not all steps in this
    pathway are shown). Phosphorylated LuxO activates the expression of qrr sRNAs,
    which repress HapR expression by destabilization of hapR mRNA. HapR (orange) is
    the master high-cell-density regulator of V. cholerae. Qrr sRNAs also activate
    expression of VCA0939, a GGDEF domain-containing protein, by stabilizing its transcript.
    In the low-cell-density state, the levels of c-di-GMP (red triangles) in the cell
    are high. VpsR (purple) and VpsT (green), two transcriptional activators that
