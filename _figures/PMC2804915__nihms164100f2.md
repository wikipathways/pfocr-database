caption: A biochemical pathway of junction remodeling at the BTB, apical ES and hemidesmosome.
  Three cellular events, namely spermiation, BTB restructuring and transition to G2–MI,
  occur while primary spermatocytes cross the BTB at stages VIII–XI of the seminiferous
  epithelial cycle. These events require strict coordination and are regulated by
  a unique biochemical pathway. At spermiation, MMP-2 is activated by cytokines (e.g.
  TGF-β3 and/or TNFα, denoted by a dark brown hexagon and a dark brown circle, respectively)
  to cleave the α6β1 integrin–laminin α3β3γ3 adhesion complex (green) at the apical
  ES. This event is likely to involve the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase
  (FAK; lilac) and the transforming gene of Rous sarcoma virus (c-Src; pink), resulting
  in the internalization of laminin fragments. Thereafter, biologically active laminin
  fragments induce BTB restructuring to facilitate transit of preleptotene spermatocytes
  by activating ERK (orange) and/or p38 MAPK (red). These MAPKs also help to prepare
  spermatocytes for transition to G2–MI. Alternatively, biologically active laminin
  fragments can exert their effects at the hemidesmosome by reducing the level of
  β1 integrin, and this might also involve the participation of FAK and c-Src. Destabilization
  of the hemidesmosome apparently serves as a feedback loop to further destabilize
  the BTB and to facilitate its restructuring. Moreover, cytokines produced by Sertoli
  and/or germ cells and secreted into this microenvironment might also stimulate testosterone
  (T, denoted by a blue star) production and binding to the androgen receptor (AR;
  blue). This can also activate ERK and/or p38 MAPK, resulting in BTB restructuring
  and spermatocyte migration. In short, the events of spermiation, BTB disassembly,
  hemidesmosome remodeling and cell cycle progression are coordinated by MAPKs.
