caption: The JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Ligand binding to the membrane receptor leads
  to receptor dimerization (1) and activation of associated JAK proteins (2). JAK
  phosphorylates the receptor (3) to recruit and phosphorylate cytoplasmic STAT factors
  (4). Phosphorylation of STAT factors leading to their dimerization (5). As a dimer,
  STAT will be translocated into the nucleus (6) to specifically bind to DNA at the
  GAS (IFN-gamma-activated site). The STATE dimer activates the transcription of its
  target genes (7). This figure presents STAT3 and its target genes in the nucleus
  as an example
