caption: Potential protective mechanisms of GLP-1 RAs in Alport syndrome. Adapted
  from “Explaining Alport syndrome – lessons from the adult nephrology clinic” [66].
  This figure summarises the key potential renoprotective effects of GLP-1 receptor
  agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in the context of Alport syndrome. Kidney-focused pathological
  sequelae in Alport syndrome include disruption of the collagen IV network which
  compromises the structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM),
  subsequent albuminuria/proteinuria, hematuria, podocytopathy, progressive glomerular
  inflammation and sclerosis, tubulointerstitial inflammation, oxidative stress, and
  fibrosis. GLP-1 RAs inhibit oxidative stress by reducing NADPH oxidase activity
  through PKA activation and cAMP production, resulting in lower reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) levels in glomeruli and tubules [48]. GLP-1 RAs activate the Nrf2 signaling
  pathway to promote antioxidant defenses [67]. GLP-1 RAs inhibit fibrotic responses
  by suppressing the TGF-β pathway, reducing fibronectin and collagen deposition in
  the kidneys [68]. Podocyte protection is achieved through inhibition of TNF-α, NF-κB,
  and AMPK pathway activation, preserving glomerular filtration barrier integrity
  and reducing albuminuria [69]. Additionally, GLP-1 RAs promote diuresis and natriuresis
  by inhibiting the Na + /H + exchanger (NHE3) in proximal tubules, leading to enhanced
  sodium excretion and reduced fluid retention [57]. Red blood cell (RBC); glomerular
  basement membrane (GBM). Image created using BioRender
