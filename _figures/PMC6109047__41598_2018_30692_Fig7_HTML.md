caption: Pictorial Abstract. A schematic summary showing how nuclosamide through the
  dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, inhibits the stemness of OSCC
  cells via the downregulation of pluripotency transcription factors, suppress oral
  CSC -associated EMT and metastasis by upregulating vimentin and snail, while downregulating
  E-cadherin, as well as limit EMT-related extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling by
  modulation of TIMP2, MMP2 and MMP9. Similarly, nuclosamide suppresses the cisplatin-induced
  oral CSC enrichment and enhances the sensitivity of the ALDH+ OSCC cells to cisplatin.
