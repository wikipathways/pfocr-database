caption: NKG2D-mediated tumor evasion. PGE2 binds to EP2/4 and inhibits NKG2D transcription
  via the AC/cAMP/PKA pathway. Kynurenine inhibits NKG2D transcription via the JNK
  pathway. Tregs and MDSCs secrete cytokines, such as TGF-β, and inhibit NKG2D expression.
  The tumor itself can also express NKG2D receptor, which binds to NKG2DL on adjacent
  tumor cells, activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and promotes tumor proliferation
