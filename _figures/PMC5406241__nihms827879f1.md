caption: Schematic illustrating our strategy to generate iPSCs resistant to IL-1-mediated
  signaling for tissue engineering applications. (A) Binding of IL-1 ligand to the
  IL1R1 receptor results in activation of a pro-inflammatory transcriptional program
  involving the transcription factors NF-κB, JNK, and MSK1. (B) Guide RNAs (gRNAs)
  target the genome editing nuclease Cas9 to two sites flanking exon 2 of IL1R1, which
  encodes the signal peptide sequence. (C) Cas9 induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs),
  which may be repaired via a DNA repair pathway known as non-homologous end joining.
  (D) This will lead to a subset of alleles with fully intact IL1R1, while others
  may have genomic disruptions at the IL1R1 locus, including excision of the signal
  peptide sequence, resulting in loss of signaling through IL1R1.
