caption: '(A) A pathway of putative molecular activities surrounding NFκB as predicted
  by our computational framework (): the pathway results from a genome-wide functional
  interaction specific to the NFκB pathway in human prostate cancer and contains 50
  genes connected by 112 mechanism-specific interactions. To generate this novel NFκB
  pathway, we extracted a high-confidence subnetwork from the genome-wide functional
  interaction network (see ) around 18 query genes in total (blue type), including
  five NFκB complex genes (NFκB1, NFκB2, REL, RELA, RELB), five NFκB specific inhibitors
  (NFκBIA, NFκBIE, IκBKB, IκBKG, CHUK), and eight genes found to be differentially
  expressed between lethal and indolent prostate cancer (). (B) We recovered all known
  molecular interaction mechanisms between NFκB complex members and their inhibitors
