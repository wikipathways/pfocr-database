caption: Stress signaling and cell homeostasis. Intracellularly, oxidative stress-mediated
  redox state is pivotal to maintain host cell survival and homeostasis via cross-talks
  with inflammasome, cell death pathways, and stress-responsive proteins. Mitochondria-derived
  ROS and mtDNA provide stimuli for upregulation of JAK-STAT pathway and inhibition
  of HDAC1, which is required for hyperacetylation and cytosolic translocation of
  HMBG1. In the presence of pathogenic stimuli, substantial release of all thiol-reduced
  HMGB1 by exosomes serve as inflammatory mediators that marked the prelude of sepsis.
  This redox form interacts with AIM2 and dsDNA to initiate inflammasome activation
  and caspase-1-mediated responses, which serve as pre-requisite for autophagy/mitophagy
  induction via beclin1-mediated pathways. Besides, prolonged oxidative stress oxidize
  HMGB1 into the disulfide form, which is potent to displace Bcl2 from its association
  with beclin1, allowing autophagy initiation and removal of hazardous oxidative stress
  stimulus. Interaction of beclin-1 with PINK/Parkin further facilitate mitochondria
  priming and autophagosome formation, which subsequently interact with lysosome to
  induce mitophagy. Autophagy and mitophagy are essential mechanisms to regulate innate
  immune response and prevent stress-induced injuries. During systemic inflammation
  context (sepsis), failure to initiate protective autophagy/mitophagy might result
  in profound cell stress signaling and deleterious pro-inflammatory cell deaths.
