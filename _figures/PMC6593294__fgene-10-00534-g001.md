caption: 'Possible pathways underlying the DLL1/Notch signaling pathway defect. Two

  Transcription Factor 2 (RUNX2) (OMIM 600211)/Receptor Activator of NF-kappa-β Ligand
  (RANKL) (OMIM 602642) and TGFβ Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Mothers against

  differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells, advancing mineralization, increasing
  adherence, and facilitating the activation and expression of several markers associated
  with osteogenesis (). Among the main regulators affecting these pathways are WNT/β-catenin
  and HEY1/2 (OMIM 602953 and 604674, respectively). It has been reported that RUNX2

  is downregulated by the Notch signaling pathway. Alternatively, Notch upregulates
  hairy-and-enhancer-of-split-1–7 (HES1–7) and HEY1/2. These play a regulatory role

  osteoblast differentiation through direct upregulation of RUNX2, BMP, and JNK, which
  activate the SMAD1 receptor by phosphorylating the linker region (; ; ; ; ; ). Green
  arrows indicate the upregulation of the targets. Red arrows indicate the downregulation
