caption: The canonical, non-canonical and the atypical NF-κB signaling pathway. (A)
  In the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway lipopolysaccharides (LPS), tumor necrosis
  factor α (TNFα) orinterleukin-1 (IL-1) activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs), tumor
  necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), respectively.
  Through a variety of adapter proteins and signaling kinases this leads to an activation
  of IKKβ in the IKK complex, which can then phosphorylate IκBα on Serine residues
  S32 and S36. This phosphorylation is a prerequisite for its subsequent polyubiquitination,
  which in turn results in proteasomal degradation of IκBα. NF-κB homo- or heterodimers
  can then translocate to nucleus and activate target gene transcription. (B) In the
  non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, activation of B-cell activation factor (BAFFR),
  CD40, receptor activator for nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) or lymphtoxin β-receptor
  (LTβR), leads to activation of IKKα by the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). IKKα can
  the phosphorylate p100 on serine residues S866 and S870. This phosphorylation leads
  to polyubiquitination of p100 and its subsequent proteasomal processing to p52.p52-RelB
  heterodimers can then activate transcription of target genes. (C) In the atypical
  NF-κB signaling pathway, genotoxic stress leads to a translocation of NEMO to the
  nucleus where it is sumoylated and subsequently ubiquitinated. This process is mediated
  by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) checkpoint kinase. NEMO and ATM can then
  return to the cytosol where they activate IKKβ.
