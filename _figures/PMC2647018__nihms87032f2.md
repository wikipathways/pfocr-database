caption: The flavivirus replication cycle. Virions bind to cell-surface attachment
  molecules and receptors and are internalized through endocytosis. In the low pH
  of the endosome, viral glycoproteins mediate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes,
  allowing disassembly of the virion and release of its RNA into the cytoplasm. The
  viral RNA is translated into a polyprotein that is processed by viral and cellular
  proteases. Viral non-structural proteins then replicate the genomic RNA. Virion
  assembly occurs at the ER membrane. Capsid protein and viral RNA are enveloped by
  the membrane and its embedded glycoproteins to form immature virus particles, which
  are then transported through the secretory pathway. In the low pH of the trans-Golgi
  network (TGN), prM is cleaved by furin. Mature virions are then released into the
  cytoplasm. See text for further information. (Courtesy of Rushika Perera and Richard
