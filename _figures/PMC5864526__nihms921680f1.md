caption: Interaction of genomic and non-genomic responses mediated by steroid hormone
  signaling. Classical steroid hormone signaling occurs when hormone binds nuclear
  receptors (NR) in the cytoplasm, setting off a chain of genomic events that results
  in, among other changes, dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where the
  ligand-bound receptor forms a complex with coregulators to modulate gene transcription
  through direct interactions with a hormone response element (HRE). This transcription
  can lead to changes such as an increase of membrane growth factor receptors (GFRs)
  and calcium channels. Alternatively, steroid hormones may function through non-genomic
  signaling. This can occur through the plasma membrane localization of NRs by recruitment
  to the membrane upon palmitoylation and interaction with scaffolding proteins or
  by hormone-responsive GPCRs like G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). Non-genomic
  signaling can mediate physiological changes within the cell often by activating
  kinase cascades in the cytoplasm or by interaction with growth factor receptors
  at the plasma membrane. These signaling pathways can in turn increase the transcription
  of certain genes involved in various cell functions. In this way, non-genomic signaling
  can regulate genomic events. Conversely, genomic events can lead to the expression
  of genes involved in rapid signaling. Together, this demonstrates that both the
  genomic and non-genomic actions of steroid hormones can alter biological processes
  either independently or by influencing the other pathway.
