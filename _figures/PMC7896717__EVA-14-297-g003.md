caption: Gene networks showing signatures of pervasive positive selection in Han Chinese
  and/or Japanese populations according to signet analysis performed on whole genome
  distribution of nSL scores and aimed at testing for polygenic adaptation. On the
  left, genes belonging to the Glycerolipid metabolism, AGE‐RAGE signaling in diabetic
  complications, and FoxO signaling pathways pinpointed as candidate adaptive loci
  in the CHB population. On the right, genes belonging to the FoxO signaling, Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis,
  and Glucagon signaling pathways pinpointed as candidate adaptive loci in the JPT
  population. In the center of the plot are reported the genes belonging to the FoxO
  signaling pathway that showed signatures of positive selection in both the considered
  populations. The size and color of the circles are proportional to the nSL peak
  value associated to each gene according to the displayed color‐scale
papertitle: Genomic adaptations to cereal‐based diets contribute to mitigate metabolic
  risk in some human populations of East Asian ancestry.
