caption: Potential mechanisms by which lactate modulates the innate immune responses.
  (A) Immature dendritic cells differentiate into a tolerogenic phenotype in high
  lactate environments, activating inhibitory signaling pathways such as TGF-β/Smad3
  through the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β. This process drives the differentiation
  of naive T cells into regulatory T cells. (B) LPS activates the MyD88-dependent
  signaling pathway by binding to TLR4 on the surface of dendritic cells and macrophages,
  triggering the TAK1 phosphorylation cascade that ultimately induces the nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB (p50/p65) mediated by the IKK complex. This translocation
  drives the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6. (C)
  Lactate binds to the GPR81 receptor on the surface of macrophages, activating downstream
  signaling pathways that inhibit the expression of M1-type pro-inflammatory genes
  while inducing the transcription of M2-type repair genes. (D) Lactate induces histone
  lysine lactylation and acetylation modifications, reshaping chromatin openness and
  promoting the transcriptional activation of M2-type repair genes. (E) A high-lactate
  environment induces the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells into MDSCs, significantly
  promoting their proliferation and activation. Activated MDSCs inhibit the immune
  functions of T cells and NK cells while inducing the expansion of regulatory T cells,
  thereby enhancing immune suppression. (by figdraw.com)
