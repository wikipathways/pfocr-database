caption: Molecular mechanisms of SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced pulmonary fibrosis. When SARS‐CoV‐2
  is inhaled into the respiratory system of the human body, the virus enters the host
  cell with the assistance of the angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor
  and TMPRSS2. The active replication and release of the virus through exocytosis
  lead to a proinflammatory response and pyroptosis. These signals and patterns are
  recognized by adjacent epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and alveolar macrophages,
  facilitating the production of cytokines and chemokines (such as IL‐6, MCP1, IP‐10,
  MIP1α, and MIP1β). These factors recruit multiple immunocytes, including macrophages,
  T cells, and monocytes, and promote more severe inflammation. Monocyte/macrophage‐derived
  IL‐1β and epithelial cell‐derived IL‐6 contribute to the proinflammatory feedback
  loop and cause overproduction of cytokines, resulting in a cytokine storm. Galectin‐3
  (Gal‐3) also binds to Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) to facilitate pulmonary fibrosis.
  Gal‐1 promotes transdifferentiation from alveolar epithelial type II cells (AEC2)
  to myofibroblasts via the FAK signaling pathway. Alveolar fibroblasts can also be
  activated by viral response‐induced TGF‐β signaling, JAK/STAT signaling, and direct
  interactions with AEC2s. Created with Biorender.com
