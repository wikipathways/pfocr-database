caption: 'Network of biglycan signaling in osteoblast differentiation and stabilizing
  role of biglycan in skeletal muscle. In bone, biglycan stimulates the BMP/TGFβ pathways,
  leading to the transcription of osteoblast-related genes and osteoblast differentiation.
  By binding to the Wnt3a ligand and its receptor LRP6, biglycan potentiates the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway, thereby further contributing to osteoblast differentiation. In
  skeletal muscle, biglycan associates with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and
  contributes to its stability and to muscular integrity. For further details, refer
  to the text. Abbreviations used in the figure: BMP, bone morphogenic protein; BMP-R,
  bone morphogenic protein receptor; Cbfa1, core binding factor α1; FZ, Frizzled receptor;
  LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein; nNOS, neuronal nitric oxide
  synthase; TCF, lymphoid enhancer binding factor/T-cell–specific factor; TGFβ, transforming
  growth factor β; TGFβ-R, transforming growth factor β receptor; Wnt, Wingless and
  Int.'
