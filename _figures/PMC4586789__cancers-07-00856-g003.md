caption: Inhibitors of the Hh signaling pathway target different Hh signaling components.
  (i) Smo is the first identified target for Hh inhibition and remains the best studied.
  Smo inhibitors function by binding directly to Smo and preventing downstream activation;
  (ii) Indirect Gli inhibitors inhibit Hh signaling downstream of Smo, but have differing
  mechanisms. HPI-1 and Imiquimod increase Gli degradation (iia), while HPI-2 and
  HPI-3 prevent Gli protein activation (iib). HPI-4 inhibits ciliogenesis, while arsenic
  trioxide prevents Gli trafficking to the primary cilium (iic); (iii) Direct Gli
  inhibitors inhibit Hh signaling by binding directly to Gli protein and inhibiting
  its transcriptional activity. GANT58 prevents Gli translocation to the nucleus.
  GANT61 and Glabrescione B inhibit transcription of Hh target genes, by interfering
  with the DNA binding pocket of Gli protein.
