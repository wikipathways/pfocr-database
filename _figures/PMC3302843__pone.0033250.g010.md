caption: Normoxic and hypoxic conditions lead to differences in signaling, attributable
  to reduced ARSB activity leading to increase in chondroitin-4-sulfation, reduced
  galectin-3 binding to the more highly sulfated C4S, increased nuclear translocalization
  of galectin-3, and increased transcriptional events in association with activation
  of AP-1, including increased expression of HIF-1α. [ARSB = arylsulfatase B; FGE = formylglycine
  (oxoalanine) generating enzyme; C4S = chondroitin-4-sulfate].
