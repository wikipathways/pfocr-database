caption: Regulatory mechanism of lncRNA 220. Upon LPS treatment, the TLR4-MyD88 dependent
  pathway functions as the primary downstream regulatory pathway. The TLR4 receptors
  situated on the Kupffer cell membranes transmit signals to the nucleus via phosphorylated
  MyD88, thereby promoting the transcription of 220. A minor proportion of 220 is
  transported through the nuclear pores to the cytoplasm, where it complexes with
  5101 to form the ceRNA complex. During inflammatory conditions, the complex is responsible
  for regulating the downstream PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by modulating the
  levels of phosphorylated PIK3R1, AKT, and mTOR, which in turn contributes to the
  autophagy and apoptosis processes in Kupffer cells
