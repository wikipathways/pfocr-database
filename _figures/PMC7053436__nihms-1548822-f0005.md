caption: '(A) Highly connected communities identified by unbiased community clustering,
  colored by their functional proximity (). Red circles and gene names highlight nodes
  representing “habituation deficient” genes. For complete list of communities and
  genes see . (B) Nodes connecting four communities from the central module represent
  the core components of Ras-MAPK signaling. (C) Schematic representation of Ras-MAPK
  signaling and associated mechanisms in ID disorders called ‘Rasopathies’. (D) Increasing
  Ras signaling by inducing either loss of function of negative Ras regulators (left
  side of pathway scheme) or by constitutively activating Ras (right side) disrupts
  habituation learning. Left: Defective habituation upon neuron-specific knockdown
  of negative Ras regulators, Nf1 (2xGMR-wIR/+; Nf1-RNAivdrc35877/elav-Gal4, UAS-Dicer-2,
  N=72, in red) and Spred (2xGMR-wIR/+; Spred-RNAivdrc18024/elav-Gal4, UAS-Dicer-2,
  N=73, in red), compared to their corresponding genetic background controls (2xGMR-wIR/+;
  elav-Gal4, UAS-Dicer-2/+. N: 55, 20, in gray). *** padj<0.001, based on lm analysis
  and FDR correction in the screen (see ). Right: Defects in habituation learning
  in a heterozygous, constitutively active Ras mutant (Ras1R68Q/+, N=55, in green)
  compared to its genetic background control (N=43 in gray), and upon neuron-specific
  expression of Ras1R68Q (elav>Ras1R68Q: UAS-Ras1R68Q/2xGMR-wIR; elav-Gal4, UAS-Dicer-2/+,
  N=52, in green) compared to its genetic background control (2xGMR-wIR/+; elav-Gal4,
  UAS-Dicer-2/+, N=34, in gray). *** p<0.001, based on lm analysis. Data presented
  as Mean TTC ± SEM.'
