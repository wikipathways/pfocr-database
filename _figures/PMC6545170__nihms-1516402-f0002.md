caption: (A) In the absence of Wnt or when Wnt is prevented to bind to FZD and LRP5/6
  (off state), cytoplasmic β-catenin is targeted by the APC/Axin/GSK3β complex and
  CK1, which together coordinate phosphorylation of β-catenin, leading to its ubiquitination
  and proteosomal degradation. In this off state, the Wnt responsive genes (target
  genes) are repressed by TCF-TEL/Groucho and HDAC. (B) In the on-state with presence
  of Wnt ligands or Norrin, LRP5/6 is brought into the receptor complex with Wnt-bound
  FZD, which recruits DVL, leading to sequential phosphorylation of LRP5/6 by GSK3
  and CK1, and recruitment of Axin. The destruction of APC/Axin/GSK3β complex releases
  β-catenin and prevents its phosphorylation, allowing β-catenin to stabilize and
  accumulate in the cytoplasm in a non-phosphorylated form. Stabilized β-catenin subsequently
  translocates into the nucleus where it promotes transcription of Wnt target genes
  upon binding to TCF. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; CK1, casein kinase 1; DVL,
  Dishevelled; FZD, Frizzled; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; HDAC, histone deacetylases;
  LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; TCF, T cell factor; TLE,
  transducing like enhancer of split 1.
