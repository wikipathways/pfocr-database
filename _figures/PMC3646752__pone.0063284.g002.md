caption: 'A schematic portray of the yeast secretory machinery including all the possible
  modification and transport steps. The model covers all the possible PTMs and transport
  routes of the yeast machinery. The machinery is divided into 16 subsystems (S1–S16).
  These subsystems are: S1: Translocation; S2: Dolichol pathway; S3: ER glycosylation;
  S4: Folding; S5: GPI biosynthesis; S6: GPI transfer; S7: ERADC; S8: ERADL; S9: ERADM;
  S10: COPII; S11: COPI; S12: Golgi processing; S13: LDSV (low density secretory vesicle);
  S14: HDSV (high density secretory vesicle); S15: CPY pathway; S16: ALP pathway.
  Each subsystem is shown with an arrow (For the full list of components of each subsystem
  and the associated template reactions see  and ). The model has 8 compartments including
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, COPI, COPII, vacuole, endosome, membrane and
  extracellular (shown with vivid blue text beside them). The proteins located in
  the cell wall are considered to be extracellular proteins. The interaction of the
  model with the rest of the cell is based on the defined exchange reactions for the
  metabolic precursors, energy and electron carriers needed for the modification and
  transport processes in the machinery. The black rectangle around the machinery indicates
  the virtual system boundary which separates the secretory machinery from the rest
  of the cell and the exchange reactions are represented by arrows crossing this boundary.'
