caption: Pathway diagram of phosphorylated nucleosides which are key intermediates
  in glycosylation and cell wall synthesis pathways generating chitin, glucans, and
  poly-mannosylated (mannoproteins) proteins. Pathway of N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc)
  synthesis in cytoplasm from glycolysis, followed by formation of UPD-N-acetyl-glucosamine
  (UDP-GlcNAc) and its polymerization at the plasma membrane complex (green) to form
  chitin which is translocated into the periplasmic space. The glucans are synthesized
  from UDP-glucose in the cytoplasm by polymerization at the plasma membrane to form
  β-1,3- (blue) and β-1,6-glucan (red), and secreted into the periplasmic space. Poly-mannosylated
  proteins are processed through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi for packing in
  vesicles that are transported to the plasma membrane to be secreted into the periplasmic
  space
