caption: The MRP2/HXA3 (hepoxilin A3) axis forms the proinflammatory arm of a dynamically
  regulated system in which inflammatory pathways that activate responses to pathogens
  or aberrant signals are balanced against the anti-inflammatory P-glycoprotein (P-gp)/endocannabinoid
  (eCB) pathway that suppresses neutrophil responses in the context of normal commensal
  colonization. The 2 sets of lipid-based signaling molecules (eCB and HXA3) are released
  from the apical surface during periods of either tolerance or inflammation, which
  control the recruitment of neutrophils to the intestinal lumen. Dysregulation of
  this critical balance may contribute directly to inflammatory disorders of the intestine
  (108).
