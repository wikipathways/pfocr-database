caption: Potential cell signal transduction pathways of 7 central hub genes in CMs
  infected with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 might bind to TLR4, then activated IRF3 and
  IRF7, leading to increased expression of IFNB1 and IFN-β. IFN-β could stimulate
  STAT1 and finally resulting in myocardial fibrosis. Besides, the TLR4-induced c-JUN/c-FOS
  activation could enhance the expression of ACE2 to allow more SARS-CoV-2 to entry
  into the host cells. At the same time, the activited c-JUN/c-FOS might eventually
  accelerate the apoptosis of CMs. CCL2 bound to its receptor CCR2 and activated the
  PKC signaling pathway, inducing the increase of AP-1 (c-JUN/c-FOS), NF-κB and ACE2,
  and ultimately leading to CM apoptosis and myocardial ischemia. NF-κB signaling
  pathway could also be activated by IL-1A/IL-1B and subsequently contributed to myocardial
  ischemia. The combination of CXCL8 and its receptor CXCR1/2 promoted cell senescence,
  and enhanced cell invasion in conjunction with SERPINE1 through MMP pathway.
