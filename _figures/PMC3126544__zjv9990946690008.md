caption: Schematic description of the TGF-β1-mediated pathway that leads to EBV reactivation
  in BL cells. First there is a quick and transient activation of NF-κB, and then
  there is a downregulation of iNOS activity that requires the participation of NF-κB,
  leading to ERK 1/2 phosphorylation. Although necessary, NF-κB alone is not sufficient
  to produce downregulation of iNOS, suggesting that another, uncharacterized event(s)
  is involved at this step. Simultaneously, TGF-β1 mediates Smad pathway activation
  through its receptor I/ALK5. However, the activated canonical pathway (involving
  Smad factors) and noncanonical pathways (involving NF-κB, iNOS, and ERK 1/2) in
  concert contribute to TGF-β1-mediated ZEBRA expression and consequently EBV reactivation
  in BL cells.
