caption: Summary of the function of RASGAPs in the RAS signaling pathway. In the pathway,
  RASGAPs are a class of important proteins that play a crucial negative regulatory
  role in the RAS signaling pathway. RASGAPs accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP on RAS
  proteins, converting them from an active state (GTP-bound state) to an inactive
  state (GDP-bound state), thereby shutting off the transmission of RAS signals
