caption: Proposed model of minimal completeness of cell death signaling induced by
  oxidative stress as a mechanistic explanation of neuronal and cancer cell demise.The
  neurotoxins Aβ[25–35], dopamine (DA) and its related neurotoxins (6OHDA, 5,6- and
  5,7-DHT), paraquat (PQ), and rotenone (ROT) trigger a cell death subroutine in lymphocytes,
  a well-established model of AD and PD. This mechanism is characterized by O2·−/H2O2
  generation (step 1, numbers in red), activation of the transcription factors NF-κB
  (step 2), p53 (step 3), and c-Jun (step 5), activation of the JNK kinase (step 4),
  mitochondrial depolarization (step 6), caspase-3 activation (step 7), and nuclei
  chromatin condensation/fragmentation (step 8). These findings may be explained by
  the following assumptions. H2O2 might indirectly activate NF-κB through phosphorylation
  of its inhibitor IκBα either by Syk (step 9, numbers in blue) or via SHIP-1 (step
  10)/IKK complex pathway. H2O2 might also activate NF-κB through activation of the
  IKK complex by the MEKK1 protein (step 11). Once NF-κB is activated, it translocates
  into the nucleus and transcribes several antiapoptotic genes (step 12) and proapoptotic
  genes, amongst them the p53 (step 3). At this point, a vicious cycle is established.
  First, p53 transcribes proapoptotic genes such as Bax (step 13), contributing to
  the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane by antagonizing antiapoptotic
  proteins. Second, p53 induces prooxidant genes (e.g., p53-induced gene-3 (PIG3),
  proline oxidase (PO), step 14), which generate more H2O2 (step 1) and represses
  the transcription of antioxidant genes. H2O2 overproduction and further activation
  of NF-κB induce upregulation of proapoptotic genes (e.g., p53), which in turn amplify
  the initial H2O2-induced cell death signal (step 2–8). Mitochondrial damage allows
  the release of apoptogenic proteins (step 15) responsible for the formation of apoptosome
  and activation of caspase-3 protease. This protease in turn activates the endonucleases
  DFF40/CAD, by cutting the nuclease's inhibitor DFF45/ICAD. Finally, DFF40/CAD causes
  nuclear chromatin fragmentation, typical of apoptosis. Alternatively, ASK1 (step
  16) and MEKK1 (step 11) phosphorylate MKK4/MAPK kinase (step 17). MEKK1 kinase also
  phosphorylates IKK. This last kinase phosphorylates JNK1/2/SAPK (step 4), which
  in turn phosphorylates c-Jun, also involved in death signaling. Noticeably, vitamin
  C (VC) and vitamin K3 (VK3) alone or in combination induce apoptosis in Jurkat and
  K562 cells by a similar mechanism as described. This mechanism might provide the
  basis for therapeutic design strategies in AD, PD, and cancer (leukemia).
