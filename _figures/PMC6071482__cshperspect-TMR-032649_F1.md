caption: Model of the eukaryotic translation elongation pathway. At the top, an eEF1A•GTP•aminoacyl-tRNA
  (transfer RNA) ternary complex binds to the A (aminoacyl) site of an 80S ribosome
  with the anticodon loop of the tRNA in contact with the messenger RNA (mRNA). Following
  GTP hydrolysis and release of an eEF1A•GDP binary complex, the aminoacyl-tRNA is
  accommodated into the A site, and the eEF1A•GDP is recycled to eEF1A•GTP by the
  exchange factor eEF1B. During catalysis of peptide bond formation, the A- and P
  (peptidyl)-site tRNAs shift into hybrid states with the acceptor ends of the tRNAs
  moving to the P and E sites, respectively. Substrate positioning for peptide bond
  formation is aided by binding of the factor eIF5A and its hypusine modification
  (green) in the E site. Following peptide bond formation, the factor eEF2•GTP with
  its diphthamide modification (magenta) binds in the A site and promotes translocation
  of the tRNAs into the canonical P and E sites. Following release of the deacylated
  tRNA from the E site, the next cycle of elongation commences with binding of the
  appropriate eEF1A•GTP•aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site. Throughout, GTP is depicted
  as a green ball and GDP as a red ball; also, the large ribosomal subunit (light
  blue) is displayed transparently to enable visualization of the tRNAs, factors,
  and mRNA bound to the decoding center at the interface between the large and small
  subunits and of tRNAs, interacting with the peptidyl transferase center in the large
  subunit. Note, however, that the positions of the mRNA, tRNAs, and factors are drawn
  for clarity and are not meant to specify their exact places on the ribosome.
