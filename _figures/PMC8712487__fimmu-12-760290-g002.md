caption: Summary of the possible functions of Myo1g and Myo1f in the NK cell. It is
  suggested that the interaction of Myo1f with 3BP2 causes the activation of Cdc42
  through Vav1 (1). On the other hand, reduced interaction Myo1f and 3BP2 causes a
  decreased activation of Vav1 and, in turn, lower activation of Cdc42 (2). Consequently,
  less actin is polymerized during the secretion of cytotoxic granules (3), protrusions
  formation (4), and cytokine secretion. The participation of Myo1g and Myo1f is also
  essential, regulating the membrane tension. Furthermore, Myo1f deficiency causes
  defects in β1, β2, β7 integrins expression (5). Moreover, Myo1g-deficient B cells
  show lower LFA-1 membrane expression, probably due to defects in recycling (6) similar
  to the ones present in CD44. A decrease in LFA-1 at the cytotoxic synapse (7) will
  impair cytotoxic activity. Additionally, a lower amount of LFA-1 in the membrane
  would cause a lower interaction with ISG15 and defects in Src family kinases signaling
  (8), which induces the secretion of cytokines and IFN-γ, also mediated by Cdc42
  (9). Therefore, it would be possible that the interaction of Myo1f and 3BP2 (10)
  could regulate Src; however, none of these interactions have been proven in NK cells.
  Finally, membrane tension negatively regulates actin polymerization through the
  PLD2-mTORC2 pathway (11). Thus, both Myo1g and Myo1f could regulate NK cell membrane
  tension and, consequently, mechano-transduction. Created with BioRender.com.
