caption: P2Y2 receptors are coupled to G protein and activate the PLC pathway. The
  PLC leads to the formation of InsP3, which in turn leads to the release of intracellular
  Ca+2. When the PLC is activated, it also causes the generation of DAG, which in
  turn is a PKC activator that promotes the inhibition of the Na+/K+ATPase activity.
  Besides, the P2Y2 receptor also activates the MAPK pathway. All these intracellular
  effects caused by the activation of P2Y2 are promoters of tumor progression
