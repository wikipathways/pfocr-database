caption: A comprehensive model for the modulation of interactions and secretion within
  TME by metformin. Metformin inhibits the IGF-1 pathway in cancer cells, leading
  to the suppression of anti-apoptosis signaling. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-kB
  in cancer cells facilitates apoptosis and reduces the expression of immune checkpoints
  such as PD-L1. A reduction in the release of TGF-β following administration of metformin
  may potentiate apoptosis in cancer cells. Metformin scavenges released NO and ROS
  by MDSCs to improve antigen presentation by APCs. Metformin suppresses positive
  cross-talk between immunosuppressive cells to reduce the release of PD-L1, IL-10,
  and TGF-β. This is associated with increased cytotoxicity of CTLs, which leads to
  an augment in the release of antitumor lytic enzymes (perforin and Granzyme B) and
  cytokines
