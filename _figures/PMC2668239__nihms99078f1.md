caption: 'Tumorigenesis in the adrenal cortex, like in other endocrine (i.e. pituitary)
  and non-endocrine tissues (i.e. colon) is subject to a multi-step process, although
  not all steps are detected in pathologic specimens, nor it is necessary for all
  steps to occur in all cell types. Both adenoma and cancer can form without first
  going through hyperplastic and adenomatous, respectively, transformation; the cAMP-signaling
  pathway leads to hyperplasias1, 2; IGF-II overexpression (and that of other growth
  factors) is associated with adenomas and cancer; defects of cell cycle genes (TP53,
  CHEK2) are the hallmark of both sporadic and familial adrenal cancer8, but large
  benign adenomas can also harbor somatic TP53 mutations9. If the first “hit” is in
  TP53, such as is the case in LFS, cancer forms without need for any precursor steps;
  if, on the other hand, the first defect is in a gene of the cAMP-signaling pathway
  (as in CNC or MAS), the most likely outcome is hyperplasia and adenomas, which only
  rarely (if ever) progress to cancer. In support of this hypothesis, we and others
  reported somatic Wnt-signaling pathway abnormalities in adenomas formed in the context
  of hyperplasias3, 10-12; somatic PRKAR1A mutations also occur in sporadic adenomas
  that behave like those in CNC. Finally, chromosomal abnormalities are common in
  all ADTs and their complexity progresses with the severity of the pathology13, 14Abbreviations:
