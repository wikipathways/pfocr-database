caption: Proposed mechanism of the suppression of EV-A71 infection by TMEM106A. Both
  SCARB2 and PSGL-1 act as cell surface receptors enabling EV-A71 infection. SCARB2
  facilitates EV-A71 infection by playing critical roles in virus attachment, entry
  and uncoating. Innate immune response to viral infection, through engagement of
  receptors, activates signaling pathways that induce the expression and secretion
  of type I IFN. In turn, IFN molecules bind their cognate receptors, signal through
  the JAK-STAT pathway, and induce hundreds of ISGs. One of them, TMEM106A, encodes
  a transmembrane protein, which exerts antiviral activity by blocking the recognition
  site of EV-A71 through its association with SCARB2, but not PSGL-1.

  description: Proposed mechanism of the suppression of EV-A71 infection by TMEM106A.
    Both SCARB2 and PSGL-1 act as cell surface receptors enabling EV-A71 infection.
    SCARB2 facilitates EV-A71 infection by playing critical roles in virus attachment,
    entry and uncoating. Innate immune response to viral infection, through engagement
    of receptors, activates signaling pathways that induce the expression and secretion
    of type I IFN. In turn, IFN molecules bind their cognate receptors, signal through
    the JAK-STAT pathway, and induce hundreds of ISGs. One of them, TMEM106A, encodes
    a transmembrane protein, which exerts antiviral activity by blocking the recognition
    site of EV-A71 through its association with SCARB2, but not PSGL-1.
