caption: Enzymes identified as miR-277 targets are boxed and identified by CG number.
  Red boxes required Z > 3 in Anopheles. Blue boxes required Z > 2 in Anopheles. In
  addition to the predicted targets, the other enzymes for which the gene has been
  identified in Drosophila are shaded in green. The metabolic pathway chart is from
  http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/pathway/map/map00280.html.
