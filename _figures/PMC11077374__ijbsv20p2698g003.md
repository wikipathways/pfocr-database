caption: The role of HuR during Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, autophagy and drug
  resistance in pancreatic cancer. LncRNA can induce HuR to bind to mRNA to promote
  the translation of downstream factors, or directly bind to HuR to recruit EIF3B
  to the mRNA translation initiation site, which ultimately manifests as autophagy
  and Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation. In response to different external stresses,
  HuR is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where HuR can up-regulate
  specific factors to regulate drug resistance of pancreatic cancer cells under the
  conditions of DNA damage, hypoglycemia and gemcitabine treatment
