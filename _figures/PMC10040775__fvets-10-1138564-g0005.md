caption: 'Regulatory networks related to the insulin secretion signaling pathway and
  type 2 diabetes mellitus signaling, as predicted by QIAGEN''s Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis considering the studied genes: Ins, Insulin; Slc2a2, Solute carrier family
  2 member 2 (also known as Glut2); Gck, Glucokinase; Pdx1, Pancreatic and duodenal
  homeobox 1; MafA, Musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family A; Atf2, Activating
  transcription factor 2; NeuroD1, Neuronal differentiation 1. Molecules in the pathway
  showed in red had increased gene expression, whereas those in green had decreased
  gene expression. Solid lines indicate direct interactions between factors. Yellow
  lines indicate the participants in the canonical route of type 2 diabetes mellitus
  signaling, and blue lines indicate the insulin secretion signaling pathway.'
