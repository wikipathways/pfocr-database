caption: A schematic model depicting important aspects of our current understanding
  with respect to the crosstalk between the PDGF, VEGF and TGF pathway in the developing
  lung. Chapter I (The role of PDGF signalling in (patho)- physiologic lung development)
  emphasizes the importance of PDGF-Rα expressing myofibroblasts (MFBs) in alveolarization
  that is hindered by mechanical ventilation and stretch causing abrogation in the
  receptor leading to reduced migration and disrupted elastin deposition. As a consequence
  of its reduced downstream signaling, a reduction in VEGF-A is observed accelerating
  endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis. This is the link to chapter II (Disturbed vascular
  growth factor signalling in the injured neonatal lung) of the review showing interaction
  of PDGF to disrupted VEGF, a pro-survival growth factor for ECs. Chapter III (TGF-β
  signalling enhancing pulmonary injury in neonates) of the review focuses on the
  aspect of upregulated TGF-β in injured lung that can be attributed to increased
  influx of monocytes and macrophages. The increased TGF-β expression and signaling
  interferes with PDGF-Rα and VEGF-A signaling hence affecting survival and function
  of MFBs and ECs.
