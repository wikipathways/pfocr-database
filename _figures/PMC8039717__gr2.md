caption: Serendipitous pathway discovered by Kim et al. that bypasses the deletion
  of an intermediate gene pdxB in the native PLP pathway by siphoning off material
  from the serine biosynthesis pathway. Circles highlight reaction steps that were
  predicted – or not predicted – by PROXIMAL. Pathway layout for the drawing was adapted
  from the authors’ original paper.
