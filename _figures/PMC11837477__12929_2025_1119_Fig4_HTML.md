caption: 'The EGFR roles in IECs proliferation and gut regeneration. This image highlights
  the various ways EGFR contributes to IEC proliferation and gut regeneration. Here''s
  a breakdown of the mechanisms: A EGF-EGFR Binding: High levels of EGFR and its ligand
  EGF are found in epithelial intestinal cells. EGF binding to EGFR triggers proliferation
  both directly and indirectly. Directly, EGFR signaling activation induces phosphorylation
  of the nuclear repressor factor Capicua, promoting its translocation into the cytoplasm,
  and the consequent transcription of cell cycle regulators, such as Cdc25 and Cyclin
  E. Indirectly, EGFR leads to the activation of Pnt and ETZ transcription factors
  involved in the mitochondrial biogenesis pathways. B EGFR Internalization and Activation:
  Following gut injury (e.g., from radiation), a protein called Cdc42 interacts with
  clathrin in the endocytosis complex, favoring EGFR internalization and activation
  of downstream signaling pathways, that ultimately lead to cellular proliferation
  and tissue regeneration. C YAP and EGFR Signaling: YAP is another interactor of
  EGFR. YAP induces EGFR signaling by promoting the production of a growth factor
  called EREG in the surrounding tissue (stroma). EREG can then bind to EGFR, further
  controlling the balance between proliferating IECs and the differentiation of these
  cells into mature intestinal epithelial cells. D Heat Stress and EGFR: Heat stress
  disrupts EGFR signaling pathways, leading to the shedding of cells and ultimately
  to a breakdown of the intestinal barrier'
