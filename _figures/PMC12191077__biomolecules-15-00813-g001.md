caption: 'Proton-sensing GPCR-related signaling pathway. A reduction in extracellular
  pH enables the activation of GPR68, GPR4, GPR65, and GPR132 receptors located on
  the cell membrane. The coupling of Gαq proteins can inhibit cell proliferation,
  migration, and adhesion. The coupling of Gαs proteins has been demonstrated to reduce
  cell adhesion and inflammation levels. Furthermore, Gαs proteins play a role in
  inflammatory regulation, with the activation of G12/13 and the inhibition of pro-inflammatory
  cytokine secretion. This figure was created using BioRender. Abbreviations: PLC:
  phospholipase C; AC: adenylate cyclase; cAMP: cyclic adenosine monophosphate; Rho:
  Ras homologous; ROCK: Rho-associated protein kinase; Ras: Rat sarcoma; ERK: extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; PKA: protein kinase A; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-B'
