caption: 'Crosstalk of NRPSs with other pathways. (A) Precursor-based crosstalk involves
  the direct incorporation of building blocks that are biosynthesized by other pathways.
  (B) Core enzyme-based crosstalk can be subdivided into covalent (1, 2, 3) and non-covalent
  interactions (4, 5, 6). KS: Ketosynthase; AT: Acyltransferase; ACP: Acyl carrier
  protein; C: Condensation domain; A: Adenylation domain; P: Peptidyl carrier protein.'
