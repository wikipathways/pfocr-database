caption: Common miRNA targets were subjected to DAVID functional annotation with KEGG
  pathway analysis. A. The up-regulated miRNAs in glioblastoma stem cells were predicted
  to target the p53 pathway. The p53-centered pathway has been shown to regulate cell
  cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, metastasis, and genome stability. B. The down-regulated
  miRNAs were predicted to target components of the IGF pathway. Various components
  of the IGF signaling pathways were targeted by down-regulated miRNAs. The IGF pathway
  has been shown to enhance cell growth, survival, and migration.
