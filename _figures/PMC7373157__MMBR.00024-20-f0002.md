caption: Lack of ridA uncovers a new pathway to synthesize phosphoribosyl amine (PRA).
  (A) PRA is the product of the PurF (phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase,
  EC 2.4.2.14) enzyme (green) and an intermediate in the synthesis of the pyrimidine
  moiety of thiamine. Null alleles of ridA allowed purF mutants to grow in the absence
  of exogenous thiamine, indicating that a novel pathway to PRA had been activated
  (). (B) The mechanism of PRA formation activated by the loss of RidA (yellow) required
  PRPP (phosphoribosylpyrophosphate), threonine, IlvA (blue, serine/threonine dehydratase,
  EC 4.3.1.19), TrpD (orange, anthranilate synthase, EC 4.1.3.27), and an uncharacterized
  intermediate in the formation of 2-ketobutyrate (, , ). If present, the RidA-catalyzed
  reaction removes 2-aminocrotonate and prevents its role in the formation of PRA.
