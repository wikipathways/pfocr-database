caption: Molecular mechanisms of circRNAs related to GC metastasis. A. Roles of circRNAs
  in signaling pathways associated with EMT. I. The circRNA circTHBS1 increases the
  INHBA level via adsorbing miR-204-5p in a sponge form, and stabilizes the INHBA
  mRNA via sequestering HuR protein, leading to the activation of the TGF-β pathway.
  II. CircAXIN1-encoded a novel protein, AXIN1-295aa interacts with APC to activate
  the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. III. The circRNA circAKT3 activates
  the PI3K/AKT signaling by serving as a ceRNA against miR-198 to upregulate PIK3R1.
  IV. CircTNPO3 competitively binds to IGF2BP3, leading to the destabilization of
  the MYC mRNA, consequently repressing the expressions of MYC and its target SNAIL.
  V. The circFNDC3B level is significantly increased in GC and circFNDC3B interacts
  with IGF2BP3 protein and CD44 mRNA to form a ternary complex, resulting in the upregulation
  of CD44, which facilitates EMT in GC. VI. The circRNA circ_100876 interacts with
  miR-665 to relieve the repressive effect on its target YAP1, which is involved in
  the transcriptional activation of EMT-related genes. B. Roles of circRNAs engaged
  in angiogenesis. I. CircRanGAP1 is validated to stimulate angiogenesis via modulating
  the miR-877-3/VEGFA axis. II. CircURI1, a highly expressed circRNA in GC, sequesters
  the splicing factor, hnRNPM protein in a sequence-dependent manner to modulate alternative
  splicing of a subset of migration-related genes, such as VEGFA, consequently inhibiting
  GC metastasis. III. Ebv-circLMP2A promotes angiogenesis through forming a positive
  feedback loop with HIF1α to improve the VEGFA expression. Under hypoxia, HIF1α up-regulates
  ebv-circLMP2A, and ebv-circLMP2A interacts with KHSRP to destabilize the VHL mRNA,
  resulting in VHL down-regulation and HIF1α accumulation. C. Exosomal circRNA in
  GC. The circRNA circSHKBP1 promotes GC progression via the miR-582-3p/HuR/VEGF axis,
  and sequestering HSP90 to suppress STUB1-mediated HSP90 ubiquitination. Additionally,
  increased exosomal circSHKBP1 could facilitate co-cultured cell growth. D. Other
  pivotal pathways or targets involved in GC metastasis. I. The circRNA circMRPS35
  inhibits GC tumorigenesis through the recruitment of histone acetyltransferase KAT7
  to the promoters of FOXO1/3a genes, activating the FOXO1/3a transcription, consequently
  triggering the FOXO1/3a pathway. II. The circRNA circMAPK1 exerted an anti-tumor
  effect on GC invasion via generating a 109aa protein forming as a molecular sponge
  for MEK1, thus inhibiting the phosphorylation of MAPK1 and eventually leading to
  the inactivation of the MAPK pathway. III. The ciRNA circAGO2 interacts with HuR
  protein to promote its activation and enrichment on the 3’ UTR of HuR targets, resulting
  in repressing the AGO2/miRNA-mediated gene silencing involved in cancer progression.
  IV. The circRNA circHuR sequesters CNBP from the HuR’s promoter, leading to the
  repressions of HuR and GC progression
