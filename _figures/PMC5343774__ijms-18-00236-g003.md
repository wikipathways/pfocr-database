caption: 'Pro-tumorigenic interactions between cancer cells and immune cells in the
  tumour microenvironment are mediated by the 5-lipoxygenase signalling pathway: Cancer
  cell produced LTB4 can stimulate increased proliferation, migration and lipogenesis
  (i.e., free fatty acid release) in an autocrine fashion and can also stimulate these
  processes in other tumour cells in the tumour mass. Cancer cell LTB4 paracrine signalling
  can induce and activate a number of immune cell types in the TME including tumour-associated
  macrophages (TAMs), neutrophils and mast cells. This results in increased production
  of pro-inflammatory signalling molecules (e.g., TNF-α, and IL-1β), increased vasculature
  adhesion and homing to the TME with further activation of other leukocytes. Cancer-associated
  stimulation of regulatory B-cell (tBreg) LTB4 production leads to activation of
  regulatory FOXP3+ Tregs which suppress anti-tumorigenic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells.
  Mast cell activation through 5-LO signalling results in an increase in their LTB4
  activity which can stimulate myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) recruitment
  and an increase in MDSC arginase-1 activity that can subsequently suppress cytotoxic
  CD8+ T-cell activity.'
