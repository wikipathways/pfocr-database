caption: 'Leukemic microenvironment supports survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
  (ALL) cells and their immune evasion through multiple interactions. Various cell
  populations shape the leukemic microenvironment. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) secrete
  inhibitory cytokines that suppress the cytotoxic activity of T cells and reduce
  macrophage phagocytosis. Granulocytic Monocyte Derived Suppressor Cells (G-MDSC)
  produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that inhibit activity of T cells and natural
  killer (NK) cells. NK cells express low levels of natural cytotoxicity triggering
  receptor p46 (NKp46) activating receptor, while ALL cells downregulate major histocompatibility
  complex class I-related chains A/B (MIC-A/B)-a ligand for natural killer group 2
  member D (NKG2D) activating receptor. ALL also drives NK cell dysfunction by secreting
  immunosuppressive transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). Mesenchymal stem cells
  (MSCs) secrete chemokines, e.g., C-X-C chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), which binds
  C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and promotes ALL engraftment into the vascular
  niche. Furthermore, MSCs protect ALL cells against the treatment by secretion of
  galectin-3, which activates the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells (NF-κB) pathway. MSCs also secrete metabolites, such as asparagine, which
  reduces the cytotoxicity of L-asparaginase. Non-classical (CD16+) monocytes infiltrate
  the leukemic microenvironment and are thought to be involved in ALL cells protection.
  Macrophages from the leukemic niche acquire immunosuppressive properties and secrete
  tumor-promoting cytokine TGF-β. Their phagocytic activity is reduced by the interaction
  of signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) with cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47)—a
  “do not eat me signal” expressed by leukemic cells. The figure was created in BioRender

  and mucin domain 3.'
