caption: 'Signal transduction downstream of RIP2. (a) MEKK4 and RIP2 form a complex
  preventing RIP2 ubiquitination. (b) In the presence of MDP, the MEKK4 : RIP2 complex
  dissociates and a NOD2 : RIP2 complex is able to form. (c) RIP2 is then ubiquitinated,
  leading to the recruitment of TAK1. (d) The IKK complex is recruited to RIP2 and
  IKKγ is ubiquitinated by TAK1. (e) IKKγ is then degraded by the proteasome, relieving
  inhibition of IKKα/β. (f) IKKα/β phosphorylates IκBα which subsequently releases
  p65 (g), which then enters the nucleus to enhance transcription of inflammatory
  cytokines.'
