caption: A schematic diagram of TRAIL-induced apoptotic signaling cascades. Binding
  of TRAIL to TRAIL death receptors results in recruitment of the FADD and caspase-8
  to form DISC. DISC leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase-8, which can
  activate caspase effectors and the BH3-only protein Bid. In the extrinsic pathway,
  activation of caspase-8 is sufficient to activate downstream caspases-3, -6, and
  -7, leading to cell death. However, in the intrinsic pathway, cleavage of Bid into
  its truncated form (tBid) is essential to induce cell death. tBid can rapidly translocate
  to the mitochondria and drive (through Bax and Bak) permeabilization of the outer
  mitochondrial membrane, releasing mitochondrial cytochrome c and Smac. This process
  can be blocked by overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Once in the cytosol, cytochrome
  c binds to the adaptor Apaf-1 to recruit the initiator caspase-9 into the apoptosome,
  which can activate caspase-9 and the effector caspases. Release of Smac augments
  apoptosis by antagonizing the inhibitory effect of XIAP on the various effector
  caspases. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)

  description: A schematic diagram of TRAIL-induced apoptotic signaling cascades.
    Binding of TRAIL to TRAIL death receptors results in recruitment of the FADD and
