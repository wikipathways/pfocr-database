caption: 'Schematic summary of some core reactions of carbon and energy metabolism
  relevant to modern biochemistry and possibly relevant to prebiotic chemistry. The
  names of the enzymes that catalyse the reactions labelled as I–VI interconnecting
  pyruvate, PEP and oxalacetate, as modified from , are: I, pyruvate carboxylase;
  II, oxalacetate decarboxylase; III, PEP synthase (or alternatively pyruvate:orthophosphate
  dikinase); IV, pyruvate kinase (or alternatively pyruvate:orthophosphate dikinase);
  V, PEP carboxylase; VI, PEP carboxykinase. Reactions that are coupled to phosphoanhydride
  hydrolysis in GTP (or ATP) in the modern enzymatic reactions are labelled with a
  small red star. The exclamation point at formyl pterin involvement points to the
  bioenergetic problem of energy investment at the formyl pterin synthesis step of
  the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway as shown in figure 1 and as elaborated in . The ‘D!’
