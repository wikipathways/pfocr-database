caption: 'Schematic illustrations of possible roles of the eight significant genes
  in glioma: Overexpression of FSTL1 activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to induce
  tumorigenesis and cancer stem cell maintenance and inhibits the BMP2 pathway, which
  leads to the undifferentiation of cancer cells. Increased CER1 expression suppresses
  BMP2 to induce undifferentiated glioma cells. FRAT1 is known to act on the GSK3
  signaling network of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling to activate β-catenin. However,
  based on our findings, the function of FRAT1 may not be limited to Wnt signaling.
  It can perform other functions independently of its role in the GSK3 signaling network
  of Wnt signaling. The overexpression of specific RPs suppresses the p53 inhibition
  of MDM2, which may lead to glioma cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and the differentiation
  of glioma cells. FSTL1, follistatin-like 1; BMP2, bone morphogenetic protein 2;
  CER1, cerebellar 1; FRAT1, FRAT regulator of WNT signaling pathway 1; GSK3, glycogen
  synthase kinase 3; RP, ribosomal protein; MDM, mouse double minute 2 homolog'
