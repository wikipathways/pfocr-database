caption: Enzymatic reactions are marked by arrows. Enzyme encoding genes in boxes
  are colored red or blue, respectively, to indicate up- or down-regulation in DUhTP
  compared to control DUC. Different colors in a box for the same gene indicate various
  probe sets with differing expression. No up- or down-regulation with fold change
  >2 is found for this pathway.
