caption: 'A proposed pathway model of HTS responses in maca. HTS might simultaneously
  destroy membrane integrity, induce malfunction of chloroplasts and mitochondria,
  and denature proteins in the cytosol or endoplasmic reticulum, leading to increased
  levels of cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+, and activation of heat
  stress responses (HSRs). CNGC: cyclic-nucleotide gated channel; CDPK: Ca2+-dependent
  protein kinase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase'
papertitle: Comparative analysis of maca (Lepidium meyenii) proteome profiles reveals
  insights into response mechanisms of herbal plants to high-temperature stress.
