caption: 'oncomiRs induced immune suppression: Leukocyte infiltration into tumor tissue
  and recognition of malignant cells are necessary for successful immune elimination.
  Impaired antitumor activities of T cells and NKs are a major goal of cancer cells.
  The growth and development of tumors is associated with high alterations in antigenic
  patterns that lead to attenuated recognition of cancer cells by NK and T cells.
  At the cancer level, oncomiRs such as miR-22 miR-23a miR-339 tumor cells can affect
  the activation of immune cells and then control tumor behavior by targeting the
  expression of the protein like PD-1, NKG2L and ICAM-1, thus preventing the recognition
  of cancer cells by NK and T cells. In the immune cells oncomiR drive immunosuppressive
  state by directly or indirectly controlling killing effect of NK cells and affecting
  the cytotoxicity effect of T cells. The overexpression of oncomiRs in T cells such
  as miR-23a-3p induces T cell apoptosis through the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway by inhibiting
  the tumor suppressor PTEN expression and subsequently activates protein kinase B
  (AKT) ().'
