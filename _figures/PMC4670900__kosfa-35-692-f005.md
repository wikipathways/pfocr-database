caption: Putative pathway and gene operon of glycogen synthesis and degradation in
  L. mucosae LM1. (A) Glucose is converted to glucose-6-phosphate then glucose-1-phosphate,
  which acts as the substrate for GlgC and GlgD to form α-D-glucose phosphate. GlgA
  creates linear α-1,4-glucan through the transfer of glucosyl moieties, which will
  be cleaved by GlgB to attach glucan chains and create glycogen. Glycogen biosynthesis
  is indicated by black arrows, whereas glycogen degradation is indicated by dashed
  grey arrows. (B) The organization of the 10.1 kb gene operon encoding for the synthesis
  and degradation of glycan in L. mucosae LM1.
