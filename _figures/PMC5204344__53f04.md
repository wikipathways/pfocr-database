caption: let-7c and miR-10b target multiple genes in regulatory networks. (A) GO term
  analysis of genes repressed by let-7c; P-value noted in parentheses. let-7c targets
  multiple genes associated with cell cycle checkpoint progression, DNA synthesis,
  and several steps of mitosis. All listed genes were identified as targets by the
  3′ LIFE screen (repression >20%, P < 0.05). (B) GO term analysis of miR-10b targets,
  highlighting that miR-10b targets multiple genes in the retinoic acid signaling
  pathway. Genes with experimental evidence for physical association are adjacent
  to each other. miR-10b regulates several key components of the pathway, including
  extracellular transport and delivery of the retinoic acid precursor retinol (Rol),
  the conversion of retinaldehyde (Ral) to retinoic acid (RA), cytoplasm to nucleus
  transport of RA to nuclear hormone receptors, one of the RA receptors (RAR gamma),
  and multiple effectors of RA activation.
