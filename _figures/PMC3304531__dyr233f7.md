caption: 'Multiple instruments: a potential advantage of a two-step epigenetic Mendelian
  randomization approach is the exploitation of genetic heterogeneity where multiple
  instrumental variables can be combined to strengthen causal inference for a role
  of DNA methylation in the causal pathway between exposure and disease. (A) Genetic
  heterogeneity might occur when several genes [G1, G2, G3] are robustly associated
  with the exposure of interest and can be used as separate instruments to interrogate
  the association of the exposure and DNA methylation. The influence of multiple lipid-altering
  SNPs might be one example. Collectively, the combination of lipid-altering variants
  can be used to repeatedly assess the causal relationship between lipid levels and
  DNA methylation. (B) A multiple instrument approach is also possible in step 2 where
  several uncorrelated cis-SNPs [Ga, Gb, Gc] might be identified that impact upon
  DNA methylation at a particular site or across a particular genomic region. These
  could then be used as separate instruments to interrogate the relationship between
  methylation and phenotype'
