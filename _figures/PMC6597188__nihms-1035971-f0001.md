caption: (A) In most cells, there are two sequential cell death checkpoints in the
  TNFR1 signaling pathway and ligand binding to TNFR1 does not trigger cell death.
  The early checkpoint occurs when RIPK1 is modified by K63- and M1-linked poly-ubiquitin
  chains catalyzed by the TRAF2/cIAP1/2 and LUBAC E3 ligases, respectively. RIPK1
  is in a pro-survival mode and is prevented from associating with the FADD/CASPASE
  8 death-signaling complex. This checkpoint is reinforced by IKK-mediated phosphorylation
  of RIPK1 and CYLD to further inhibit their death-signaling capabilities. The late
  checkpoint occurs when NFκB translocates to the nucleus to upregulate expression
  of pro-survival genes. If these checkpoints function properly, cells do not die
  in response to TNF.(B) Failure in the early checkpoint occurs when ubiquitination
  of RIPK1 is impaired. This can happen when expression or activity of the ubiquitin
  E3 ligases (e.g., TRAF2, cIAP1/2, LUBAC) is blocked, or when the expression or activity
  of deubiquitinases (e.g., CYLD) is elevated. A reduction in ubiquitin chains on
  RIPK1 promotes its interaction with FADD and CASPASE 8 to induce apoptosis, or with
  RIPK3 to induce necroptosis if apoptosis is inhibited. The RIPK1-dependent death
  can then lead to inflammation.
