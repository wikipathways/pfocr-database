caption: Impact of heterologous 2,3-BDO metabolic pathway engineering and oxygen levels
  on native central carbon metabolism in Z. mobilis. This figure shows native central
  carbon metabolism in Z. mobilis which includes ED (Entner–Doudoroff), PPP (pentose
  phosphate pathway), and fermentation pathways leading to the production of ethanol
  and other minor metabolites of glycerol, lactate, and acetate from carbon source
  of glucose and xylose. The heterologous 2,3-BDO biosynthesis pathway was integrated
  into Z. mobilis metabolic pathway, which contains three enzymes of acetolactate
  synthase (Als), acetolactate decarboxylase (AldC), and butanediol dehydrogenase
  (Bdh) for 2,3-BDO biosynthesis from pyruvate. Depending on the source of Bdh enzyme
  from different microorganisms, three 2,3-BOD stereoisomers of R,R-2,3-BDO, S,S-2,3-BDO,
  and meso-2,3-BDO could be produced. Reactions involved in redox cofactor (NADH/NAD+)
  regeneration were shown as well as the respiration chain enzymes and electron transfer
  in Z. mobilis. The interactions among these pathways can help understand the impact
  of host carbon and energetic metabolism as well as oxygen levels on heterologous
  2,3-BDO metabolic pathway engineering in Z. mobilis
