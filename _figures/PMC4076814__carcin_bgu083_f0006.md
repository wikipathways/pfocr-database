caption: A diagram depicting the role of GPX7 in regulating inflammation in esophageal
  epithelial cells. The TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB leads to upregulation of
  several cytokines and chemokines that mediate the inflammatory phenotype. In cells
  expressing GPX7 (left panel), the activation of NF-κB is suppressed through degradation
  of TNFR1 and TRAF2. In the event of GPX7 gene silencing (via DNA hypermethylation),
  the NF-κB pathway activation is enhanced, due to loss of the GPX7 inhibitory functions
  and the positive feedback of TNF-α, leading to persistent proinflammatory signaling
  that is associated with Barrett’s carcinogenesis (right panel).
