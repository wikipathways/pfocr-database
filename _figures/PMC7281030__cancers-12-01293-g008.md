caption: Model describing the impact of the most consistent lipid changes observed
  in cancer cells—increase in PE plasmalogen- and AA-containing phospholipids (in
  particular PI)—on the Akt signaling pathway, a canonical cell differentiation and
  proliferation pathway. (A) In healthy cells, phosphatidylinositol-3–kinase (PI3K)
  phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3, which recruits Akt directly via a PH-pleckstrin domain.
  Despite the lack of direct evidence indicating the preference of PI3K enzymatic
  for AA-containing PIP2, this specificity was shown for PI4K [,]; in addition, both
  PIP2 and PIP3 are enriched in AA []. Altogether, it could be speculated that PI3K,
  may prefer AA-containing substrates. Thus, other papers show that plasmalogens are
  needed to maintain Akt linked to the membrane [,], which is crucial for its activation
  via phosphorylation by PDK1 and PDK2 (among others). Once phosphorylated, Akt shuttles
  back to the cytosol where it phosphorylates a myriad of targets, activating downstream
  pathways that culminate in cell proliferation. (B)—In cancer cells, including colorectal
  cancer cells, PI3K and Akt are overexpressed at the protein level []. Therefore,
  the presence of high levels of AA-containing phospholipid, and plasmalogen [,,,,]
  in cancer cells would provide the substrate and necessary environment to sustain
  enhanced and uncontrolled cell division.
