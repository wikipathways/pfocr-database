caption: Schematic representation of pathways influencing Nrf2 build-up and its downstream
  pathways. PI3K-Akt pathway prevents non-Keap1 degradation of Nrf2, p62/SQSTM pathway
  inhibits Keap1 to facilitate nuclear translocation of Nrf2, AMPK pathway leads to
  Nrf2 build-up by Nrf2 serine 588 phosphorylation, disrupted TCA cycle leads to diminished
  levels of Nrf2. Nrf2 increases glucose uptake and facilitates PPP, breaks down lipid,
  and diminishes tumorigenesis in cells. However, Nrf2 leads to increased cell proliferation
  and decreased chemotherapeutic responsiveness in cancer cells. Keap1 forms complex
  with PGAM5 and under oxidative stress leads to cell death. Arrows indicate downstream
  processes, flat-headed line indicates inhibition. TCA, tricarboxylic acid; PGAM5,
  phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway
