caption: Morphinan biosynthetic pathway. Known pathways for the conversion of neomorphinone
  and neopinone to morphine in Papaver somniferum. Both neomorphinone and neopinone
  are derived from thebaine. In the major pathway (shown in green), neopinone is isomerized
  to codeinone by neopinone isomerase (NISO). Codeinone is reduced to codeine by COR
  and codeine converted to morphine by codeine O-demethylase (CODM). In the minor
  pathway (shown in blue), neomorphinone is isomerized to morphinone by NISO and morphinone
  reduced by COR to form morphine. COR accepts both neomorphinone and neopinone and
  converts these substrates irreversibly to neomorphine and neopine, respectively
  (shown in red). Ring assignment used by convention (i.e., A, B, C, D) are indicated
  on neopinone but apply to all morphinans.
