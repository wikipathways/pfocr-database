caption: 'Homologous recombination deficiency assays in epithelial ovarian cancer.
  Homologous recombination repair (HRR) is an important pathway for repairing DNA
  double-strand breaks (DSBs). In HRR, DSBs are detected and bound by BRCA1/2 and
  other HRR protein complexes to localize RAD51 to the exposed single-strand DNA,
  which then invades the DNA sequence on a homologous sister chromatid to synthesize
  the new DNA strand. Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) occurs when HRR is
  impaired, especially by BRCA mutation. DSBs are repaired by other error-prone repair
  pathways, including nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which may cause point mutations,
  small insertions or deletions, and even large-scale chromosomal rearrangements in
  the repaired DNA strands. In the S phase of the cell cycle, the replication forks
  stop when encountering DNA damage to allow DNA repair before replication continues.
  After the damage is repaired, the stalled fork resumes replication. If the damage
  cannot be repaired, the stalled replication fork undergoes fork collapse, comprising
  fork degradation to cell apoptosis. In general, HRD assays have three main categories:
  germline or somatic mutations of genes in the HRR pathway, genomic scars or mutational
  signatures representing the patterns of genomic instability, and checking the functional
  status of HRR. Germline and somatic BRCA tests should be performed in all patients
  with newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The current HRD assays based
  on SNP-based microarray technologies measure loss of heterozygosity (LOH), telomeric
  allelic imbalance (TAI), and large-scale state transitions (LSTs). The genomic instability
  score (GIS) combines the information derived from the LOH, TAI, and LST to represent
  the degree of genomic instability. Functional assays of HRR status include RAD51
  foci assays and DNA fiber assays. The RAD51 subnuclear foci is generally present
  after DNA damage in normal cells, but HRD cells cannot form RAD51 foci. The DNA
  fiber assay was developed to evaluate the dynamics of the replication fork. Mutational
  signatures describe distinct patterns of nucleotide transitions with the surrounding
  nucleotide context from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data for human tumors.
  The developing comprehensive genomic scar assays include whole genome sequencing
  (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES), and target gene panels consisting of variable
  sizes of selected cancer-susceptible genes. PARPi maintenance therapy benefits newly
  diagnosed advanced stage and platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC patients. The current
  genomic scar-based HRD assays can identify additional wild-type BRCA patients who
  may benefit from PARPi therapy. However, some issues need to be resolved. For tissue
  retrieval, multistep sampling to obtain archival and pretreatment tumor tissues
  over the clinical course has the potential to guide the therapy. For precision medicine,
  it is ideal to develop a comprehensive model to integrate clinical platinum sensitivity,
  genomic scar/mutational signatures, and functional tests to provide both past evidence
  of HRD and the current functional ability of HRR.'
