caption: Translation of glutamine codons in yeast. (A) The direct and indirect pathways
  for Gln-tRNAGlnsynthesis in yeast. In yeast cytoplasm, Gln-tRNAGln is synthesized
  by direct coupling of Gln to its cognate tRNAGln by GlnRS. In contrast, in yeast
  mitochondria, Gln-tRNAGln is formed by an indirect pathway, where Glu is first ligated
  to tRNAGln by ND-GluRS, forming a mischarged Glu-tRNAGln, which is then converted
  to Gln-tRNAGln by GluAdT. (B) Comparison of E. coli and yeast cytoplasmic and mitochondrial
  tRNAGln isoacceptors. Secondary structures of tRNAsGln are shown in cloverleaf form.
  Nucleotides and base pairs that were shown to be important for recognition by EcGlnRS
  are boxed.
