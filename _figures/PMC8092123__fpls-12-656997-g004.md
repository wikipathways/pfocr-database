caption: Overview of metabolic pathways that are regulated by Ca. L. asiaticus infection
  in leaf petioles. (A) Asymptomatic stage (CI1 vs. MI1) and (B) symptomatic stage
  (CI2 vs. MI2). Red squares, significantly upregulated proteins; green squares, significantly
  upregulated proteins. Each colored square represents a single annotated gene in
  a particular pathway.
