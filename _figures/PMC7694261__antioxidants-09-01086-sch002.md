caption: (A) The positions where the Δyap1, Δzwf1, and Δglr1 mutants affect glutathione
  synthesis and metabolism. (B) The effect due to lack of thioredoxin in the Δtrx2
  mutant in compromising the reduction by thioredoxin-dependent mechanisms of protein
  disulfides produced under oxidative stress conditions. NADPH produced in the pentose
  phosphate pathway serves as a reductant for both glutathione reductase and thioredoxin
  reductase.
