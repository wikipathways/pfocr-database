caption: Schematic representation of PAR4-mediated signal transduction. PAR4 can activate
  signaling pathways involving Gα12/13 and Gαq. Gα12/13 prompts RhoGEFs to activate
  RhoA, while Gαq -Phospholipase C- β (PLC- β) leads to downstream effects such as
  upregulation of inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), resulting
  in calcium alterations and PKC upregulation, which ultimately leads to activation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Additionally, β-arrestin can facilitate ERK1/2 phosphorylation
  but has inhibitory effects on PKC. Thrombin, known for its ability to cleave PAR4,
  can influence these pathways, therefore dabigatran (thrombin inhibitor) can modulate
  signal transduction by attenuating thrombin’s effects. As seen, PAR4 activation
  can cause physiological alterations such as inflammatory and immune response, endothelial
  barrier dysfunction, and platelet activation
