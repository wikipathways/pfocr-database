caption: Design and strategy of TAR-based cloning and expression. (A) Physical map
  of the gene cluster capture vector pCAP01. The vector consists of three elements
  that allow direct cloning and manipulation of pathways in yeast (blue), maintenance
  and manipulation in E. coli (green), and chromosomal integration and expression
  of cloned pathways in heterologous actinobacteria (red). For the construction of
  a pathway-specific capture vector, homology arms corresponding to both ends of the
  pathway are introduced into the capture arm cloning sites. (B) The procedure for
  TAR-based natural product discovery involves three steps. In step 1, transformation-associated
  recombination in yeast involves homologous recombination between the linearized
  pathway specific capture vector and cointroduced genomic DNA fragments to yield
  a circular construct that can be grown on selective media. In step 2, the cloned
  pathway can be manipulated using either in vivo yeast recombination or E. coli-based
  genetic manipulations, such as λ-Red recombination. Finally, in step 3, through
  conjugal DNA transfer from E. coli, the cloned and manipulated pathway is integrated
  into the chromosome of an actinomycete host strain for small-molecule expression
  studies.
