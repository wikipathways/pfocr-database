caption: In macrophages, sortilin is implicated in antigen scavenging and phagosome
  maturation. (A) Sortilin and scavenger receptor CD206 are addressed from the TGN
  to the plasma membrane. In Alternatively Associated Macrophages (AAMs), sortilin
  can bind extracellular antigens and mediate their endocytosis. Antigens are then
  degraded in the lysosome, and AAMs being incapable of antigen processing, antigen
  peptides are not presented to T cells by class 2 MHC. (B) Upon phagocytosis of mycobacteria
  by macrophages, NF-kB pathway is activated, inducing SORT1 transcription. Sortilin
  is then transported and vehicles Acid Sphingomyelinase, to early phagosomes. This
  step is crucial to phagosome maturation and mycobacteria growth arrest and degradation.
