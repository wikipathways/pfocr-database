caption: Hypoxic stress is known to up regulate both the HIF-1 controlled response
  and the antagonistic p53 response [A]. Sustained p53 activity results in cell demise
  by promoting the transcription of cell cycle arrest genes, such as p21 and apoptosis-inducing
  genes, such as Bax [B]. Alternatively, HIF-1 can prevent cell death by promoting
  the transcription of genes that determine adaptive responses and cell survival [C].
  We have previously showed that CSB, which is also induced by hypoxia [D], interacts
  with p53 and therefore releases the limiting co-factor p300 from p53. By doing so,
  CSB negatively modulates the transactivation activity of p53 and up regulates the
  transactivation of other transcription factor related pathways (in the specific
  the HIF-1 dependent pathway) therefore re-equilibrating the physiological response
  toward cell proliferation and survival instead of cell cycle arrest and cell death.
  [E] Recently we have discovered that CSB drives p53 to ubiquitination/degradation,
  in an Mdm2 dependent fashion, therefore down regulating the cellular levels of p53.
  CSB is part of a feedback loop where its expression is induced by p53 itself [F].
  This mechanism helps the cell to find a reasonable equilibrium between the transient
  up regulation of the p53 response, aimed to temporarily arrest the cell cycle and
  potentiate the DNA repair mechanism, and its down modulation in order not to reach
  the point of no-return that would trigger apoptosis. Others have established that
  after genotoxic stress (UV, oxidative stress) CSB is also recruited to DNA damaged
  sites [G], we propose a model in which CSB, besides acting in DNA repair, may act
  as a sort of dosimeter in order to modulate either the transcriptional activity
  of p53 (p53-p300 interaction) or its degradation. Indeed, high levels of DNA damage
  would sequester CSB at the damaged sites thus blocking its function in the down
  modulation of p53 activity and degradation. Parallel recruitment of p300 by CSB
  favors the accessibility of the damaged site to the repairosome and potentially
  inhibits the transcription (at least the p300 related) contributing to the transient
  shut down of the transcription in response to DNA damage. [H] Finally, the interaction
  CSB/p53 has been suggested also to play a role in metaphase fragility. p53 inhibits
  CSB-processivity affecting chromatin condensation of highly structured genes, such
  as U1, U2 and 5S, resulting in metaphase fragility [I]. We propose an alternative
  hypothesis, where CSB might favor chromatin condensation on these sites by disturbing
  p300/p53 interaction and chromatin acetylation.
