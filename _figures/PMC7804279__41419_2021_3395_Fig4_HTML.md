caption: VEGF-A exposure to ECs and binding with VEGFR2 may inhibit the function of
  LATS1/2 through Src kinase, thus relieving YAP/TAZ from inhibition and phosphorylation
  by LATS1/2. The complex of TNF-α and TNF-α-R may also inhibit the activity of LATS1/2
  indirectly. Activated YAP/TAZ accumulates in the nucleus and promotes angiogenesis
  and/or inflammatory vascular response. Arrows, blunt ends, and dotted lines indicate
  activation, inhibition, and possible regulatory effect, respectively.
