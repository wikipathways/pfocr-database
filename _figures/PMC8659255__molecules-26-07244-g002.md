caption: Different metabolic engineering strategies to synthesize 4HB-containing PHA
  in Escherichia coli. When using glucose as the sole substrate, it is converted to
  succinyl-CoA via glycolytic pathway and TCA cycle. Succinyl-CoA is converted to
  succinate semialdehyde by SucD. Deletion of native sad/gabD genes prevents the conversion
  of succinate semialdehyde to succinate. Then, succinate semialdehyde is converted
  to 4-hydroxybutyric acid by 4HbD. When using γ-butyrolactone or 1, 4-butanediol
  as 4HB precursor, they are converted to 4-hydroxybutyric acid. 4-hydroxybutyric
  acid is then converted to 4HB-CoA by OrfZ. 3HB-CoA is derived from acetyl-CoA under
  the action of PhaA and PhaB. Finally, P4HB or P(3HB-co-4HB) is synthesized under
  the action of PhaC. For the synthesis of P (3HP-co-4HB), 3HP-CoA is derived from
  1,3-propandiol. Under the action of PhaC, 3HP-CoA and 4HB-CoA is polymerized to
  form P (3HP-co-4HB). SucD, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase; Sad and GabD, succinate
