caption: 'The canonical (yellow background) and non-canonical (red background) Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathways are related to mechanical elements and actions responsible for
  cell polarization, migration and tissue organization. Blue background stands for
  membrane bound receptors. β-catenin is a major player and is permanently created
  and degraded by the APC complex. It is important for linking the cytoskeleton to
  the cell membrane and to neighboring cells but also as a gene transcription factor.
  If it is over-expressed or if APC is not working properly developmental genes are
  activated and the cell is less adhesive and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  is induced with cell migration and proliferation. These are features of malignant
  tumors. The Wnt pathway is further directly linked to pathways controlling the activity
  and structure of the cytoskeleton: Rac, Cdc42, and Rho. It was recently discovered
  that IPGAP1 has a major regulatory function for actin and MT cytoskeleton. This
  is also the case for the APC-Asef complex. The illustration combines different sources
  as indicated by numbers on a white background. 1: [], 2: [], 3:[], 4: [,], 5: [].'
