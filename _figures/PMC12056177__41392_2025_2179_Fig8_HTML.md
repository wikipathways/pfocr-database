caption: Schematic description of kinase signaling pathways in Parkinson’s disease.
  PINK1 and LRRK2 are involved in mitochondrial and lysosomal function, and their
  mutations lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy defects. These mutations
  induce typical α-syn aggregation in the form of Lewy bodies and neurites, as well
  as neuronal loss. The accumulation of PINK1 in the mitochondrial membrane and subsequent
  recruitment of Parkin can trigger the initiation of mitophagy. LRRK2 mutations failed
  to phosphorylate AKT and promote cell survival via inhibition of FOXO1, whereas
  phosphorylated JNK and p38 MAPK, promoting cell death. Activated ASK1 can also phosphorylate
  MAPKK and subsequent MAPK to form a cascade amplification of signaling, promoting
  cell death by regulating the activation of JNK and p38. Phosphorylation of α-syn
  occurs at several sites involving kinases such as CK, PLK, c-Abl, and GRK, contributing
  to its aggregation and the formation of Lewy bodies, which alters the activity of
  numerous kinases and triggers neuroinflammation and increased ROS. This figure was
