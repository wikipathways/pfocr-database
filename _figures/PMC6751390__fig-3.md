caption: Glutathione redox cycle. GSH is synthesized from the amino acids l-glutamate,
  l-cysteine, and glycine in a two-step pathway requiring energy from ATP. Glu and
  Cys are combined via the action of GCL. This dipeptide then combines with Gly via
  a reaction from GS. GSH undergoes a redox reaction using glutathione peroxidase
  GPx to detoxify ROIs such as H2O2. GSH is converted to an oxidized form (GSSG) and
  is recycled back to GSH by the enzymatic reaction of GR, which requires the cofactor
  NADPH to form a redox cycle. ATP, adenosine-5-triphosphate; Cys, cysteine; GCL,
  glutamate cysteine ligase; GR, glutathione reductase; GS, glutathione synthetase;
  GSH, glutathione; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.
