caption: Cellular and epigenetic mechanisms of bortezomib in hematological malignancies.
  (A) Chemical structure of Bortezomib. (B) After entering the cell, bortezomib interacts
  with the 20S catalytic core of the proteasome, rendering the core’s β1 and β5 subunits
  inactive. (C) This proteosome inactivation interrupts the NF-kB pathway. In a malignant
  cell with unhindered proteasomal function, NF-kB’s inhibitory molecule, IkB, is
  degraded by the proteasome. Thus, in its active form, unbound NF-kB is free to enter
  the nucleus and activate transcription of genes that support survival and proliferation
  of malignant cells by upregulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules (i.e.,
  VLA-4, VLA-5, ICAM), angiogenesis promoting factors (i.e., VEGFs, angioprotein-1,
  MCP1), anti-apoptotic enzymes (i.e., Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, cIAP, XIAP, FLIP), and various
  signaling molecules/receptors (i.e., IL-6, TGFβ, TNFα, IGF-1, SDF-1, HGF). Bortezomib-mediated
  loss of proteasomal function, keeps NF-kB bound to its inhibitor (IKB) and prevents
  its nuclear entry. Consequently, the inactive form of NF-kB—unable to enter the
  nucleus—disables Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation of DNMT1 gene. Under normal
  conditions, functional interaction between NF-kB and Sp1 activates transcription
  of DNMT1 gene, resulting in DNA hypermethylation. Bortezomib-mediated inhibition
  of NF-kB pathway decreases DNMT1 expression leading to hypomethylation of a tumor
  suppressor gene PDKLIM4 (PDZ and LIM domain 4). Mechanisms underlying bortezomib-mediated
  regulation of epigenetic pathways and gene targets are under investigation. By mechanisms
  yet to be determined, bortezomib can potentiate the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer
  binding protein delta (CEBPD) leading to the upregulation of miRNAs (miR744, miR3154,
  miR3162) capable of repressing the expression of the oncogenes UBE2V2 (ubiquitin
  conjugating enzyme E2 V2), PRKDC (protein kinase DNA-activated catalytic subunit),
  and MCM4 (minichromosome maintenance complex component 4). Despite remaining mechanistic
  questions, bortezomib can block cellular pathways to facilitate malignant growth
  and alter DNA methylation, and thereby a treatment for hematological malignancies.
