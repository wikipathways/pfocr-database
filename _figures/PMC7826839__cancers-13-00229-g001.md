caption: Role of the adenosinergic pathway in the Glioblastoma microenvironment. Adenosine
  (ADO) is produced from ATP following the enzymatic activity of CD39 and CD73 on
  the glioblastoma cancer stem cells (GSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAMs), and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Soluble CD73 is also involved
  in ADO production. ADO binds to the ADO receptors (ARs) on the GSCs and increases
  the proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, and chemoresistance. The
  chemoresistance is mediated by the upregulation of Mrp-1 and P-gp that extrude chemtherapeutic
  agents out of the cells. The GSCs invasion and metastasis are mediated by downregulation
  of E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin, vimentin, and β-catenin that increase
  endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). AR signaling (especially A2aR and A2bR)
  on natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) inhibits the antitumor
  function of these cells by upregulating the immune checkpoints such as CTLA-4, PD-1,
  LAG-3, and TIM-3, as well as suppressing the release of inflammatory cytokines (IL-12,
  IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6). The signaling of A2aR and A2bR on the Tregs and TAMs promotes
  the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β) and the upregulation of
  immune checkpoints, leading to pro-tumor effects. Alternatively, ADO can be metabolized
  to inosine by extracellular or intracellular adenosine deaminases (ADAs), which
  is the basis of some therapeutic modalities. ADO. Adenosine; ARs. Adenosine receptors;
