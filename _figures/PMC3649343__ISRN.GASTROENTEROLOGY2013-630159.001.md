caption: 'The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway depicted. Scheme of the vagus
  nerve interacting with immune activation at multiple levels following ingestion,
  infection, and trauma. (1) During digestion, the commensal flora and dietary components
  activate the sensory afferent vagus nerve, which will transmit the information to
  the brain. In return, the brain may activate the efferent vagus nerve to modulate
  gastrointestinal macrophages. (2) The efferent vagus nerve also modulates systemic
  inflammatory responses through a mechanism involving an intact spleen. Upon infection
  or trauma, bacterial components or intracellular mediators (HMGB1, heat shock proteins,
  etc.) activate macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines. (3) This will trigger
  afferent vagus nerve signaling. (4) Central activation of vagal efferent pathways
  which lead to release of acetylcholine (ACh) and relay on peripheral ganglia to
  stimulate adrenergic transmitter release (in the spleen) to act on aplenic antigen
  presenting cells and macrophages. Recent data indicate the generation of ChAT-positive
  ACh producing immune cells (see text). Interrogation marks indicate that, although
  macrophages are found in the proximity of cholinergic fibers in the spleen and the
  intestine, there is currently no evidence demonstrating that parasympathetic neurons,
  indeed, innervate immune cells in the gut wall. HMGB1: high-mobility group box 1.'
