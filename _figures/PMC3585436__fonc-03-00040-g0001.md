caption: Simplified scheme showing the differential activation of class IA and class
  IB PI3K isoforms. Class IA PI3Ks are heterodimers consisting of a 110 kDa catalytic
  subunit (p110α, p110β, and p110δ) in complex with a p85 regulatory subunit, of which
  five isoforms exist. Class IA PI3Ks are activated by growth factor and cytokine
  receptors or adaptor proteins (e.g., CD19/BCAP in B cells). Binding of the ligand
  to its receptor leads to receptor dimerization and auto-phosphorylation of tyrosines
  (Y) which are located in pYxxM motifs. The p85 regulatory subunits have Src-homology
  2 (SH2) domains which bind to phosphorylated tyrosines in YxxM motifs recruiting
  thus the class IA PI3Ks to the plasma membrane where their lipid substrates are
  located. Class IB PI3K consists of the p110γ isoform which binds to p101 or p84
  regulatory subunits. Class IB PI3K is activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
  Binding of the ligand (e.g., a chemokine) to its cognate GPCR induces the dissociation
  of heterotrimeric G-proteins and the Gβγ subunits interact with the class IB PI3K.
  Arrows with dashed lines represent activation of p110β and p110δ downstream of GPCRs
  and activation of p110γ downstream of tyrosine kinases by currently unknown mechanisms.
