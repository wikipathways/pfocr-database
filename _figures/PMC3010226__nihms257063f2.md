caption: Cellular and molecular scheme for an adaptive immune axis leading to acute
  lung disease after viral infection. Viral infection activates two major immune pathways.
  (A) In one of these pathways, viruses cause AEC and pDC production of type-I IFN.
  Subsequent IFNAR signaling leads to upregulation of FcεRIα expression on resident
  lung cDCs. In turn, FcεRI activation by viral antigen and antiviral IgE leads to
  production of CCL28 and recruitment of CCR10-expressing IL-13-producing Th2 cells
  to the lung. Persistent IL-13 production drives differentiation of AEC precursors
  towards mucous cells (MCM) and airway smooth muscle cells to become more reactive
  to contractile agonists (AHR). (B) In another pathway, viral infection also leads
  to maturation of lung cDCs that use CCL5-CCR5 and CCL19/21-CCR7 interactions to
  migrate to regional lymph nodes. In the nodes, these cDCs regulate MHC Class I-dependent
  generation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells as well as MHC Class II-dependent production
  of CD4+ Th cells and consequent B cell production of virus-specific IgE. This IgE
  is thereby available to participate in FcεRI signaling in the pathway described
  in (A). Modified from .
