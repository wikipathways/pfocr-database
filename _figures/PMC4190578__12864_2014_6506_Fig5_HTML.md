caption: Metabolic pathways for carbohydrates, fatty acids and phenylalanine. All
  genes are selected based on CSIL-35431 at 10 DPA. Red text and line indicate upregulated
  DEGs, while blue text and line indicate downregulated DEGs. Blue shaded box indicates
  that the pathway was only upregulated or altered more significantly in CSIL-35431,
  and pink shaded box indicates that the pathway is altered more significantly in
  CSIL-31134. ACCase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; ACC, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
