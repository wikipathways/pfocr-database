caption: Signaling mechanism of the canonical cGAS-STING pathway and its downstream
  effects in diseases. Exogenous DNA from virus, bacteria, dying cell and tumor cell,
  and endogenous mtDNA induced by radiation bind to cGAS, catalyzing the production
  of cGAMP. cGAMP activates STING, leading to its conformational change and trafficking
  from ER to Golgi. In the process, STING undergoes oligomerization and palmitoylation,
  which is essential for the recruitment of TBK1. TBK1 then phosphorylates STING for
  IRF3 activation. IRF3 then transfer to the nucleus and triggers type I IFN expression.
  STING activation also induces NF-κB signaling, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokins such as TNF-α and IL- 6
