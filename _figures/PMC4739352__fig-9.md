caption: Model predicting the possible mode of action of L-menthol. As described,
  the initial response is through Caspase 10 and followed by Caspase 3 and Caspase
  7. Caspase 10 may also influence the activation of BID to tBID. This step is inhibited
  by HSP90, but due to lower expression in L-menthol-treated cell, the availability
  of HSP90 decreases. After release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, APAF1 and Caspase
  9 induce Caspase 3 and Caspase 7 towards apoptosis. HSP90 may not be available in
  sufficient amount to trigger the AKT- and NFkB-mediated survival pathway. Similarly,
  BAD (a pro-apoptotic factor) is released from the complex “BAD and BCL-xL” due to
  low availability of HSP90.
