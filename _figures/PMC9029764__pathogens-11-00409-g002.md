caption: The oxidative stress and the inflammatory response in Leishmania infection.
  Independently of the presence of LRV1, the NRF2 pathway is activated upon contact
  between the parasite and the macrophage producing oxygen species generated by NOX2
  permitting the release of NRF2 from its negative regulator KEAP1 and phosphorylation
  via SFK and PKC. This anti-oxidant response limits the NF-kB inflammatory and the
  production of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. In the presence of LRV1 in
  Leishmania parasites, survival of infected macrophages is increased and production
  of Type-I interferon and inflammatory chemokines and cytokines are induced leading
  to accelerated dissemination of the infection via IL-17.
