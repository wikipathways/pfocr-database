caption: An illustration of the bidirectional interaction between Th17 and BEC. Migrating
  bacteria from the gut express pathogen-associated molecular patterns (e.g., LPS)
  that trigger BEC activation via TLR4 signaling. The downstream cascade involves
  proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, TGF-β1, and CCL20.
  IL-6 is both secreted by BEC and stimulates BEC proliferation via the JAK2/STAT3
  signaling pathway in an autocrine manner. Importantly, although BEC undergo increased
  proliferation, this does not lead to increased apoptosis or necrosis. BEC-secreted
  CCL20 is responsible for chemotaxis and subsequent transmigration of lymphocytes
  that are CCR6+ (complementary receptor). The CD4+ lymphocytes undergo alterations
  in differentiation status, lineage stability, and function, depending on their respective
  subset. These cytokines act on BEC leading to BEC proliferation, which completes
  a self-sustaining positive feedback loop that propagates chronic peribiliary inflammation
  and biliary regeneration. This LPS-stimulated inflammatory cascade could be synergistically
  augmented by exposure to local bilirubin via the AhR present on lymphocytes.
