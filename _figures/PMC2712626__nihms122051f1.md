caption: (A) The prevailing model had been that liver insulin signaling occurred by
  way of branched pathways. One pathway, associated with Irs2 and Foxo1, was thought
  to preside over the inhibition of glucose production (indicated by a red “tee” symbol).
  The other pathway, mediated by Irs1 and Foxa2, was thought to mediate lipid synthesis
  and lipoprotein assembly/secretion (indicated by a thick green arrow).(B) The work
  of Kubota et al. and Dong et al. supports a model in which Irs1 and Irs2 act in
  different conditions (fasting or feeding), but in essentially linear pathways, both
  effected through Foxo1. The decrease in TG levels and secretion in double Irs knockouts
  (denoted by the thin green line, as opposed to the thick green line in A) is consistent
  with a role of excessive insulin signaling, rather than insulin resistance, in the
  pathogenesis of the lipid abnormalities of type 2 diabetes.
