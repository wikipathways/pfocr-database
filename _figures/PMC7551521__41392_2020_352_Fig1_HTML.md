caption: The immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2. a Innate immune response. SARS-CoV-2
  infection induces imbalanced host immune responses, such as low IFN-I and -III levels
  but high pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nsp13 of SARS-CoV-2 targets the IFN pathway
  by associating with TBK1. The ORF6 protein interacts with the mRNA export factor
  NUP98-Rae1. The ORF9b indirectly interacts with MAVS via its interaction with Tom70.
  b Adaptive immune response. CD4+ T-cell responses are primarily directed against
  the S, M, and N proteins and partially against nsp3, nsp4, and ORF8. CD8+ T cells
  recognize SARS-CoV-2 M, N, S proteins, nsp6, and ORF3a. ORF8 is able to downregulate
  MHC-I expression on diverse cell types. SARS-CoV-2 primarily induces S protein-
  and RBD-specific IgG, while IgM and IgA responses are lower
