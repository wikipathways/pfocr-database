caption: The main signaling pathways of viral DNA sensors are depicted. The nuclear
  DNA sensor IFI16 and the cytoplasmic DNA sensors cGAS, DDX41, IFI16 and DNA-PK signal
  through STING. aDAI was also shown to activate TBK1 and IRF3 prior to the discovery
  of STING. bIFIX was shown to induce IFN following VACV, but the downstream signaling
  pathway has not been yet investigated. IFIX was also reported to bind HSV-1 DNA,
  a nuclear replicating virus. RNA Pol III and DDX60 signal through RIG-I, which further
  signals through MAVS. DHX9 and DHX36 signal through MyD88. AIM2 and IFI16 interact
  with ASC and Caspase 1 to form inflammasomes, which lead to the proteolytic cleavage
  of proinflammatory cytokines Il-1β and IL-18. Continuous arrows represent signaling;
  dashed arrows represent movement.
