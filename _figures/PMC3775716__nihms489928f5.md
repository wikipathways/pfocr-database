caption: Based on previously reported palladium-catalyzed annulations of alkynes,
  particularly the synthesis of indenones by the palladium-catalyzed coupling of internal
  alkynes with 2-haloarenecarboxaldehydes, we propose that this fluorenone synthesis
  proceeds through one or more of several possible pathways shown in . One possible
  pathway proceeds by the oxidative cyclization of Pd(0) with aryne A generated from
  the silyl triflate to form palladacycle B (path a). Oxidative addition of 1 to this
  palladacycle forms Pd(IV) intermediate C. Reductive elimination gives rise to arylpalladium(II)
  intermediate E. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that Pd(0) inserts directly
  into the C–I bond of 1 to form intermediate D, which then undergoes carbopalladation
  of the aryne A to give rise to intermediate E (path b). This pathway has been suggested
  by experiments in our earlier work on the synthesis of fused polycyclic aromatics
  by the palladium-catalyzed annulation of arynes by aryl halides. Arylpalladium intermediate
  E can then add the carbon–palladium bond across the aldehyde to produce a palladium(II)
  alkoxide F, which can undergo β-hydride elimination to produce the fluorenone product
  (path d). Alternatively, intermediate E can undergo oxidative addition of the aldehyde
  C–H bond to form palladium(IV) intermediate G, followed by elimination of HI, and
  regeneration of the Pd(0) catalyst by further reductive elimination to the fluoren-9-one
  (path c). A similar mechanism involving oxidative addition of the aldehyde to an
  organopalladium(II) intermediate has been proposed for the palladium-catalyzed reactions
  of o-bromobenzaldehyde with methyl acrylate. However, there does not appear to be
  any particular precedent favoring any of these pathways.
