caption: Proposed mechanism of the bidirectional relationship of seizures and Alzheimer’s
  disease with contributions of mTOR. A diagram that summarizes and synthesizes the
  findings from our work in this paper and previous work in models of Alzheimer’s
  disease and epilepsy. In this paper, we demonstrated that epilepsy/seizures can
  result in increased mTOR activity, amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology and neuronal
  death. Previous work in epilepsy models has demonstrated that mTOR is involved in
  epileptogenesis, and our work here shows that mTOR is also increased by seizures.
  The mTOR pathway has been implicated in amyloid-β deposition via autophagy, and
  in this paper was shown to be co-localized at sites of pTau inclusions. Finally,
  amyloid pathology, tau pathology, mTOR and neuronal death all contribute to cognitive
  impairment in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and seizures.
