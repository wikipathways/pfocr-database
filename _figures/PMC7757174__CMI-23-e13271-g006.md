caption: Schematic representation of the PAAR response and PASE in comparison to canonical
  autophagy and related pathways. (a) During starvation or stress conditions, autophagy
  is upregulated through a signalling pathway involving AMPK and mTORC1. Autophagosomes,
  double‐membrane vesicles, engulf cytosolic substrates. Activation of the ULK1 complex
  activates PI phosphorylation to PI3P in the candidate membrane by a class III PI3K
  complex (PI3KC3). This recruits downstream effectors and eventually two ubiquitin‐like
  conjugation systems that process and lipidate LC3 to a PE in the autophagosome membrane.
  This leads to elongation and closure of the autophagosome membrane. Subsequently,
  fusion with lysosomes leads to digestion of autophagosome contents. (b) LC3‐associated
  phagocytosis (LAP) is an autophagy‐related mechanism that leads to direct labelling
  of a single‐membrane phagosome with autophagy proteins. PI3P and the production
  of ROS lead to recruitment of the ubiquitin‐like conjugation systems and thus to
  LC3 integration into the phagosome membrane, to lysosome fusion and degradation
  of the phagosome contents. In contrast to canonical autophagy, LAP is independent
  of the ULK1 complex. (c) When Plasmodium parasites infect cells, they invaginate
  the host cell membrane, thus forming a parasitophorous vacuole (PV). This relies
  on discharge of proteins from apical organelles called rhoptries (red). Rhoptry
  proteins form a moving junction that sieves host cell membrane proteins during vacuole
  formation. The PV membrane (PVM) is heavily remodelled by the parasite and contains
  pores. During the PAAR response, the ubiquitin‐like conjugation systems are recruited
  to the Plasmodium PVM and insert LC3. In contrast to other autophagy‐related pathways,
  the PAAR response is independent of the ULK complex and the PI3KC3 complex. The
  PAAR response does not necessarily lead to elimination of the parasite, although
  lysosome markers are present at the PVM. (d) If parasites enter host cells without
  discharging their rhoptries and fail to exit or remodel their vacuole, PI3P is formed
  at the vacuole membrane. This leads to acquisition of lysosome markers and to acidification
  of the parasite. Although LC3 can be observed transiently at the vacuole membrane,
  its presence is not essential for efficient elimination of these parasites (adapted
  from (Agop‐Nersesian et al., ))
