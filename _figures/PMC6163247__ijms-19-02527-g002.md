caption: 'Overview of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria interactions. ER
  stress phenomenon promotes the activation of the de novo ceramide pathway, producing
  an increase in the exportation of dyhidrosphingosine and enzymes such as CerS1 and
  CerS6 through mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) or multivesicular endosomes
  (MEVs) to mitochondria (1), this originates the cleavage of Sig1R/Bip complex, Sig1R
  binds to IP3R3/VDCA-1 allowing the flow of Ca2+ through the ER to the inter-membranal
  space of the mitochondria by MCU (2), it can cross the inner mitochondrial membrane,
  producing a supersaturation in the mitochondrial matrix. This condition facilitates
  the activation of apoptosis by means of CHOP-dependent EROSα (3). In inter-membrane
  space, C16 ceramide leads to synthesis and assembly of pores that synergistically
  with Bax are translocated to OMM (4), this modifies the permeability of the membrane
  and allows the output of cytochrome C and proteins as SMAC/DIABLO and Omi/Htra (5).
  Later, cytochrome-C is associated with Apaf-1, promoting the change from procaspase-9
  to caspase-9, leading to apoptosome formation. The complex Bad/Bim inhibits the
  antiapoptotic action of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which in turn are associated with preventing
  the oligomerization of Bax with the pores, as well as inhibition of cytochrome C
  release (6). Image adapted from references: [,,,,,].'
