caption: The effects of nanomaterials (NMs) on Ca2+ channels located on the cell membrane
  and Ca2+ stores and subsequent dysfunction of ion homeostasis. A [Ca2+]i increase
  was one of the crucial effects of NMs exposure. NMs, such as Au NMs (Fusi, Sgaragli,
  & Valoti, ) and CdSeZnS QDs (Gosso et al., ), prompted the opening of Ca2+ channels
  or decreased the activity of Ca2+‐ATPase (Cao et al., ), allowing increased Ca2+
  influx and decreased Ca2+ flux. In addition, NMs (Tang, Wang, et al., ) could be
  internalized into cells and damage the Ca2+ store (ER and mitochondria), allowing
  Ca2+ to flow into the cytoplasm. Furthermore [Ca2+]i, which is a key second messenger,
  regulates many cellular processes, including oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis,
  and autophagy. For example, an increased [Ca2+]i could affect the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle and electron transport chain (ETC) of the mitochondria, leading to oxidative
  stress initiation. An increase in [Ca2+]i could also activate an inflammatory process
  by accelerating inflammasome formation. Ca2+ overload could result in apoptosis
  through the activation of mitochondria‐mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathways or
  the calpain–caspase pathway. Calpain also participates in the Ca2+‐induced autophagy
  process. An increased [Ca2+]i could also directly activate the calcium/calmodulin‐dependent
  protein kinase II (CAMKII)–AMPK pathway to induce autophagy. The up‐regulation of
  PKC phosphorylation under an increased [Ca2+]i status also led to increased LC3‐I
  conversion to LC3‐II, suggesting autophagosome formation. However, [Ca2+]i could
  decrease autophagic activity in some situations by mTOR activation. ER, endoplasmic
