caption: Metabolic flexibility of cardiomyocyte in use of glucose, fatty acids, lactate,
  amino acids, ketone bodies for generation of ATP to support cardiac contractile
  function. Insulin stimulates anabolic metabolism, including glucose uptake, glycolysis,
  and synthesis of glycogen, ribonucleotide, and lipid synthesis, while insulin inhibits
  the β-oxidation of fatty acids. An excess amount of ATP can be stored in creatine
  phosphate, and activated pentose phosphate pathway promotes synthesis of macromolecules
  and cardiac hypertrophy. Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway promotes glycosylation
  of many cellular proteins and bioactivity of target proteins and biological responses,
  particularly under hyperglycemia or insulin resistance. G-6-P-glucose-6-phosphate,
  G-1-P-gluocse-1-phosphate, F-6-P-fructose-6-phosphate, F-1,6-BP-fructose-1.2,-biphosphate,
