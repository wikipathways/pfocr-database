caption: Schematic diagram of miRNA biogenesis. For canonical pathway, pri-miRNA is
  transcribed by Poll II from original miRNA genes in the nucleus. Then, pri-miRNA
  is processed into pre-miRNAs by a microprocessor complex consisting of Drosha and
  DGCR8. For non-canonical pathway, mirtron is transcribed from original miRNA genes.
  Then, mirtrons undergo splicing to form a lariat structure, which is further processed
  into pre-miRNAs by DBR1. Next, the pre-miRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm with
  the help of EXP5, GTP, and RAN. In the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNA is further recognized
  and processed into double-stranded miRNAs by the Dicer/TRBP/PACT complex. Subsequently,
  the double-stranded miRNAs are unwound into a guide strand and a passenger strand
  via Ago protein. The passenger strand is then degraded, whereas the guide strand
  is incorporated into RISC to form a mature miRNA. MiRNA binds to the 3’-UTR of mRNAs,
  and ten promotes its degradation. In addition, some pre-miRNAs (e.g., miR-451) can
  be cleaved by Ago2 to generate an intermediate 3’ end, which is then further trimmed.
