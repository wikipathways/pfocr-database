caption: Mechanisms of peri-implantitis involving multiple signaling pathways. The
  figure illustrates the complex molecular mechanisms involved in the development
  of peri-implantitis, highlighting several crucial signaling pathways. The RANKL/RANK/OPG
  axis is depicted, demonstrating its essential role in osteoclast differentiation
  and activation, which promotes bone resorption during peri-implantitis. TLR2/4 pathways
  are critical mediators of the immune response to bacterial components, leading to
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of downstream pathways.
  The LOX-1/ERK1/2 signaling pathway is included to illustrate its involvement in
  inflammation and oxidative stress responses, further contributing to the progression
  of peri-implantitis. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is shown, which regulates osteoblast
  differentiation and bone formation, contributing to bone homeostasis around the
  implant. Collectively, these pathways interact to disrupt the balance of bone remodeling
  and immune responses, leading to the pathological bone loss observed in peri-implantitis
