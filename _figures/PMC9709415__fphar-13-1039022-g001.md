caption: Regulation of Nrf2 degradation and activation. Under normal physiological
  conditions, Keap1 in the cytoplasm binds to Nrf2, which is ubiquitinated and degraded
  by the proteasome pathway. Under oxidative stress, the Nrf2-Keap1 complex is dissociated
  and Nrf2 is transferred to the nucleus. In the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to downstream
  antioxidant response elements (ARE) and activates the transcription of antioxidant
  genes.
