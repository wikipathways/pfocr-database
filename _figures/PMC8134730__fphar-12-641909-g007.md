caption: The figure above summarizes the effects of OST in OVX mice. Chronic OST treatment
  led to changes in the levels of synaptic proteins in the hippocampus and at least
  some of these effects require BDNF/TrkB signaling. OST interacts with BDNF and ERα,
  leading to activation of downstream signals to improve cognitive impairment and
  ameliorate depression-like behaviors observed in OXV mice. OST caused increase in
  the release of BDNF, which then binds to and activates its surface receptor, TrkB
  then activates one of its two major downstream signaling cascades, ERK-Akt. This
  pathway converges onto the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key
  regulator of protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity. This event leads to disinhibition
  of synaptic protein translation (e.g., GluA1, PSD95, Kal7), which leads to synaptogenesis.
  The interaction of BDNF with Kal7 also influenced the Rac1/LIMK1/Cofilin pathway.
  OST-mediated changes in the levels of Rac1 also suggest that OVX-induced perturbation
  of hippocampal synaptic connectivity was reversed by treatment with OST, through
  functional modifications of neuronal networks in the brain. This suggests that the
  effects of OST on hippocampus-related behavior is in part due to the effects on
  the connectivity of neurons in this brain region.
