caption: Model of CIGB-300-mediated effects on T-ALL cells. (A) T-ALL cell viability
  and proliferation relies on cell-intrinsic signals and extracellular cues such as
  IL-7, which activate PI3K/Akt/mTOR and JAK/STAT pathways. CK2 phosphorylates and
  thereby inactivates PTEN leading to activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling []. This
  effect is reinforced by CK2-mediated direct phosphorylation of Akt []. In addition,
  CK2 binds to IL-7R (this interaction is not shown in the cartoon), which is essential
  for IL-7-mediated maximal signaling []. (B) In the present study, we showed that
  CIGB-300, a plasma membrane-crossing CK2 peptide antagonist [], binds to and inhibits
  B23/NPM1 (which does not appear to be critical for CIGB-300 anti-T-ALL effects)
  and to CK2. The effects of CIGB-300 in T-ALL cells appear to be mediated mainly
  by its ability to inhibit CK2 activation, which results in reversion of cell-intrinsic
  and IL-7-mediated activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway as well as abrogation of IL-7-mediated
  JAK/STAT signaling. As a consequence of these effects, T-ALL cells enter apoptosis
  and no longer proliferate.
