caption: This cartoon summarizes our observations and integrates them into the context
  of previous studies. Cby is associated with the basal body region of the cilia of
  multicilated cells. The Cby morpholino (“MO” in red) down regulates Cby protein
  levels, leading to a reduction in both the number of cilia per cell and the density
  of multiciliated cells in ectodermal explants; both phenotypes were rescued by the
  injection of Cby-GFP RNA. Cby inhibits the effects of β-catenin on gene expression,
  as reflected by the effects of both Cby RNA and MO on the activity of the β-catenin-responsive
  TOPFLASH reporter. Cby is thought to act on gene expression primarily by driving
  β-catenin out of the nucleus. In the context of the canonical (β-catenin-dependent)
  Wnt signaling pathway, this inhibits the interaction between β-catenin and LEF/TCF
  HMG-box type transcription factors involved in gene activation. We note that β-catenin
  also interacts with other transcription factors, including a subset of Sox type
  HMG box transcription factors, so the exact details of the Cby MO’s effects on gene
  expression in any particular cell type remain to be resolved. We have identified
  two distinct patterns of altered RNA levels in Cby morphant explants. In the first
  (indicated by blue circled 1), there is a increase in Wnt8a RNA levels and a decrease
  in BMP4, Noggin, and Tubb2b RNAs. These changes are largely blocked by expression
  (from injected RNA) of the secreted Wnt inhibitors SFRP2 and DKK1 (in red). This
  suggests that these effects are dependent upon a feed-forward Wnt signaling loop,
  which may be autocrine, juxtacrine, or both. SFRP2 also at least partially reverses
  the Cby morpholino’s effects on multiciliated cell density in explants and neuroectodermal
  and neural crest marker expression in embryos, again suggesting that the Cby morphant
  phenotype is due, at least in part, to enhanced Wnt-signaling effects. Cby MO effects
  on Gli2, Gli3, and Shh RNA levels (indicated by blue circled 2) are not blocked
  by SFRP2, and so appear to be direct effects of decreasing Cby levels and not mediated
  by downstream Wnt signaling. SFRP2 does not reverse Cby MO’s effects on cilia number
  in multiciliated cells or the neural tube, suggesting that these effects involve
  distinct Cby-regulated processes.
