caption: Activity of DVR. DVR activities described previously (A) and proposed in
  this study (B). In current Chl biosynthetic pathway, there are the two DVR activities
  that have been confirmed (A), i.e. DV-Chlide a is converted to MV-Chlide a by the
  Arabidopsis DVR () and DV-Pchlide a is converted to MV-Pchlide a by the green sulfur
  bacterium DVR (BciA; ). Here we succeeded to demonstrate the third DVR activity,
  i.e. DV-Chl a is converted to MV-Chl a by OsDVR (B).CHLG, Chl synthase; POR, Pchlide
  oxidoreductase.
