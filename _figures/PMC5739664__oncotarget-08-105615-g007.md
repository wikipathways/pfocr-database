caption: MAVS localizes to mitochondria to exert an anti-viral effect. H1N1 infection
  triggers host cell activation of the NF-κB and IRF3 signaling pathway following
  MAVS sensing. STING acts as a mitochondria cofactor for MAVS signaling to promote
  NF-κB and IRF3 production. CORT impacts the function of mitochondria, which has
  adverse effects on MAVS signaling. Indirubin promotes the production of IFN-β and
  IFITM3 by recovering MAVS signaling and maintaining mitochondrial function affected
  by CORT in the susceptible model. Moreover, indirubin is found to promote MAVS signaling
  by regulating STING following influenza A virus infection. In addition, indirubin
  attenuates NF-κB dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine production to alleviate pneumonia
  in restraint-stressed mice.
