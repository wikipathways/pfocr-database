caption: Influence of the Wnt signaling pathway and its downstream effectors in metabolic
  tissues. In mice, the Wnt signaling pathway influences metabolic events in key tissues,
  including the pancreas, adipose, liver, and skeletal muscle. Activation of this
  pathway can influence the development of tissues and organs, as well as signaling
  events that control glucose homeostasis and metabolism. This figure was made with
