caption: Effects of pyroptosis on the tumor microenvironment. (a) With the aid of
  perforin (PFN), Granzyme A/B (GzmA/B) are delivered from cytotoxic lymphocytes into
  the cytoplasm of target cancer cells. These Gzms activate GSDMB/E directly or by
  inducing caspase-3 (Casp3) activation, leading to tumor cell pyroptosis. Pyroptotic
  tumor cells also appear to activate the tumor microenvironment toward an immunostimulatory
  state probably through release of DAMPs and cytokines, forming a positive feedback
  loop in antitumor immunity. These effects of pyroptosis may synergize with immune
  checkpoint (IC) inhibitors. GSDMB expression is upregulated by IFN-γ. Massive tumor
  cell pyroptosis induced by CAR T therapy may cause CRS, which depends on a significant
  release of ATP and consequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in host macrophages.
  (b) The expression of GSDMC is increased by hypoxia. Macrophage-derived TNF-α induces
  pyroptosis in tumor cells through the caspase-8-GSDMC pathway. This may account
  for the formation of necrotic areas found in central hypoxic regions of solid tumors.
  The sustained induction of pyroptosis in a small population of tumor cells may also
  induce chronic inflammation that promote tumor progression.
