caption: Schematic representation of glycolysis and related metabolic pathways. Underlined
  are metabolites and enzymes that were associated with lifespan extension. Red font
  color represents downregulation or depletion from food, while green font color represents
  overexpression or supplementation. Dashed line represents that multiple steps are
  involved. In the glycolysis pathway, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, producing
  ATP. Lifespan extension was associated with glycolysis inhibition through the downregulation
  of hexokinase (HK), glucose isomerase (GPI), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (GAPDH), or phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM); or through addition of inhibitors such
  as 2-Deoxyglycose (2-DG) and D-glucosamine (GlcN). The hexosamine pathway converts
  fructose-6-phosphate to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). Lifespan extension
  was associated with an increased expression of glutamine-fructose 6-phosphate aminotransferase
  (GFAT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), as well as with added acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc).
  The methylglyoxal pathway produces methylglyoxal (MGO) from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). While excessive MGO can disrupt protein function,
  moderate supplementation was associated with increased lifespan in worms. Increased
  expression of triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) also increased lifespan. The pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) consists of the oxidative and nonoxidative branches. Lifespan
  extension was associated with downregulation of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase
  (6PGD), ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPI), transketolase (TKT), and transaldolase
  (TALD-1), as well as with upregulation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD).
  Downregulation of enzymes responsible for glycogen synthesis (glycogen synthase,
  GlyS; and 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme 1, GBE1) extended lifespan. Increased
  levels of trehalose and downregulation of trehalase was associated with extended
  lifespan in worms.
