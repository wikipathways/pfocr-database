caption: Predicted pathway of l-Trp synthesis. The revised reactions are indicated
  by red arrows, and the metabolites at the end of sub-pathway branches are indicated
  by a green background. The unit of the flux value is mmol/gDW/h (blue, on top),
  the unit of the enzyme cost is mg/gDW (purple, in the middle), and the unit of the
  maximal thermodynamic driving force is kJ/mol (orange, at the bottom). The upper
  limit of the glucose uptake rate was 10 mmol/gDW/h.
