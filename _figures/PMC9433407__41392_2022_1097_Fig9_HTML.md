caption: Schematic depicting the molecular mechanism through which SAC restrains EndoMT
  via suppression of PFKFB3. EndoMT is characterized by increased expression of PFKFB3
  that drives abnormal glycolysis and hijacks glucose flux from pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) to compromise cytoplasmic NADPH production. Efflux of mitochondrial
  NADPH through isocitrate/α-KG shuttle replenishes cytoplasmic NADPH pool but meanwhile
  impairs mitochondrial respiration by hampering mitochondrial Fe-S cluster protein
  biosynthesis. SAC disrupts PFKFB3 stability by accelerating its degradation and
  thus maintains endothelial metabolic homeostasis, underlying its anti-EndoMT effects
