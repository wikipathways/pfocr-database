caption: Schematic summary of Sphingosine 1 Phosphate (S1P)/S1PR (G-protein-coupled
  receptor) agonist and antagonist signalling. There are five S1PR (G-protein-coupled
  receptors) differentially expressed depending on cell type. Diversity of intracellular
  signalling is dependent on the differential targeting and binding of S1P to the
  S1P receptors, which results in internalisation of the S1P receptor and Gi-mediated
  downstream activation of effector pathways. S1P agonists and antagonists (described
  in ) bind to cognate transmembrane S1PRs on the cell and are designed to block or
  activate S1PR action. S1P antagonists are depicted with the symbol. Adapted from
  [,].
