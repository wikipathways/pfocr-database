caption: The role of MERTK in Yes-associated protein (YAP)-mediated EGFR-TKI resistance.
  Activation of hippo pathway blocks the nuclear translocation of YAP or promotes
  YAP degradation. In the EGFR-TKI resistant cancer cells, MERTK and Axl are upregulated.
  EGFR-mediated PI3K-independent Akt and MAPK signaling pathways contribute to the
  activation of YAP. In addition, MERTK may directly interact with YAP and phosphorylate
  YAP at Y444 residue, which promotes its nuclear localization and transcriptional
  activity.
