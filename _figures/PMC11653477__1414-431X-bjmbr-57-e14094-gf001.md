caption: Molecular mechanisms induced by long-term exercise in the brain’s adaptive
  responses. This schematic represents the differential pathways activated in the
  brain as a response to aerobic and resistance training. The aerobic exercise triggers
  the release of muscle-derived exerkines, which in turn enhance the expression of
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This
  cascade promotes neural survival and synaptic plasticity through multiple intermediates
  mediated by TrkB receptor. Additionally, the Sirt1/PGC1α pathway regulates antioxidant
  gene transcription via NRF2/ARE to combat oxidative stress. In response to resistance
  training, two parallel yet distinct pathways are initiated, involving IGF1/AKT signaling
  and lactate-activated sirtuins, which converge on BDNF synthesis and activate epigenetic
  regulators involved in DNA repair, thereby enhancing neuronal resilience
