caption: Interaction networks of signal transduction molecules in KRASm/WT− and KRASm/WT+
  NSCLC models. Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients of RPPA-based continuous
  values greater than 0.90 across the 183 measured analytes are displayed using network
  maps. Protein networks of KRASm/WT− (A549, H2122) show high levels of interaction
  with most proteins contained within three main clusters (A). Cell cycle regulators
  and proteins belonging to the apoptotic pathway are highlighted with red and pink
  circles, respectively. Network of KRASm/WT+ cell lines (H1734, H23, H358) shows
  fewer interconnections compared to the KRASm/WT− cells (B). Receptor tyrosine kinase,
  MAPK signaling molecules and members of the PKC family are highlighted in red and
  green, respectively. Ras-GFR-1 is highlighted in yellow in both maps.
