caption: a Proposed limonoid biosynthetic pathway and its structural diversity in
  neem (A. indica) and chinaberry (M. azedarach). Specifically, neem limonoids are
  mainly C-ring open types, whereas chinaberry limonoids are usually acetylized towards
  C12-OH. b Representative limonoid substrates (bottom left) and their acetylated
  products in chinaberry (bottom right)
