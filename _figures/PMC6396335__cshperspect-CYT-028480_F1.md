caption: Assembly of the interferon (IFN)-γ receptor (IFNGR) and activation of Janus
  kinase (JAK)-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling.
  Binding of IFN-γ to the IFNGR complex results in tight association of IFNGR1 and
  IFNGR2 and a reorientation of the intracellular domains of these subunits, thereby
  bringing their associated JAK1 and JAK2 proteins into close proximity to facilitate
  auto- and transphosphorylation and enzymatic activation. The activated JAK proteins
  then phosphorylate the intracellular domain of IFNGR1 on tyrosine 440 to create
  a binding site for STAT1. On JAK-mediated phosphorylation, STAT1 dissociates from
  its IFNGR1 tether, forms a homodimer via reciprocal interactions between the SH2
  domain of one STAT1 molecule and the phosphorylated tyrosine-701 of the other, and
  translocates to the nucleus where it binds to γ-activated site (GAS) elements and
  promotes gene transcription. The multiple levels of JAK-STAT pathway negative regulation
  are indicated. SOCS, Suppressors of cytokine signaling; PIAS, protein inhibitor
  of activated STATs. (From ; adapted, with permission, from the authors.)
