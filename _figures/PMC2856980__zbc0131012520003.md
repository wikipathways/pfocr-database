caption: Cyclical mTOR-independent autophagy pathway with multiple drug targets for
  neurodegenerative diseases. Shown is a cyclical mTOR-independent pathway regulating
  mammalian autophagy, comprising cAMP-Epac-PLCϵ-IP3 and Ca2+-calpain-Gαs pathways,
  which has multiple drug targets for neurodegenerative diseases. Intracellular cAMP
  levels are increased by adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, thus activating Epac, which
  then activates the small G-protein Rap2B, thereby activating PLCϵ. PLCϵ mediates
  the production of IP3 from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), thereby
  increasing the levels of IP3 that binds to ER-resident IP3Rs, leading to release
  of Ca2+ from the ER stores. Intracytosolic Ca2+ levels are also increased by L-type
  Ca2+ channel agonists. Elevated intracytosolic Ca2+ activates calpains, which then
  cleave and activate Gαs. In turn, activation of Gαs increases adenylyl cyclase activity
  to elevate cAMP levels, thereby forming a loop. Activation of this pathway inhibits
  autophagy. Multiple drug targets acting at distinct stages in this pathway trigger
  autophagy, such as imidazoline-1 receptor (I1R) agonists (clonidine and rilmenidine)
  and the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (2′5′ddA), which decrease
  cAMP levels; agents that lower inositol (Ins) and IP3 levels (carbamazepine and
  sodium valproate); IMPase inhibitors that also reduce inositol and IP3 levels (lithium
  and L-690,330); Ca2+ channel blockers (verapamil, loperamide, amiodarone, nimodipine,
  nitrendipine, niguldipine, and pimozide); calpain inhibitors (calpastatin and calpeptin);
  and the Gαs inhibitor NF449. Furthermore, inhibition of the IP3R by xestospongin
  B also induces autophagy by disrupting the IP3R-beclin 1 complex and, consequently,
  the Bcl-2-beclin 1 autophagy inhibitory complex. Enhancing autophagy through this
  mTOR-independent pathway is protective in various models of HD.

  description: Cyclical mTOR-independent autophagy pathway with multiple drug targets
    for neurodegenerative diseases. Shown is a cyclical mTOR-independent pathway regulating
    mammalian autophagy, comprising cAMP-Epac-PLCϵ-IP3 and Ca2+-calpain-Gαs pathways,
    which has multiple drug targets for neurodegenerative diseases. Intracellular
    cAMP levels are increased by adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, thus activating Epac,
    which then activates the small G-protein Rap2B, thereby activating PLCϵ. PLCϵ
    mediates the production of IP3 from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2),
    thereby increasing the levels of IP3 that binds to ER-resident IP3Rs, leading
    to release of Ca2+ from the ER stores. Intracytosolic Ca2+ levels are also increased
    by L-type Ca2+ channel agonists. Elevated intracytosolic Ca2+ activates calpains,
    which then cleave and activate Gαs. In turn, activation of Gαs increases adenylyl
    cyclase activity to elevate cAMP levels, thereby forming a loop. Activation of
    this pathway inhibits autophagy. Multiple drug targets acting at distinct stages
    in this pathway trigger autophagy, such as imidazoline-1 receptor (I1R) agonists
    (clonidine and rilmenidine) and the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine
    (2′5′ddA), which decrease cAMP levels; agents that lower inositol (Ins) and IP3
