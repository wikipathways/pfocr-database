caption: The MAPK pathway. Following activation of growth factor receptors by their
  ligands, signal transduction through the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK pathway occurs. With the
  help of Myc and CREB, signals are passed on to the nucleus and lead to transcription
  of genes that are relevant in proliferation and tumorigenesis. BRAF inhibition tackles
  signal transduction from Raf to MEK, whereas further downstream, MEK inhibition
  stops signal transduction from MEK to MAPK, thus counteracting resistance mechanisms
  that bypass Raf inhibition. L, ligand of growth factor receptor; GF-R, growth factor
  receptor; BI, BRAF inhibitor; MI, MEK inhibitor; CREB, cAMP response element-binding
  protein.
