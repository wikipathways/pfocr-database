caption: Top ranking gene network by gScore from the gene list uploaded from the SSRI
  versus control analysis. The pathway is highly enriched with fragments of canonical
  pathways and shows a gene‐network centered on the c‐Src gene complex. Several studies
  have found an association between Ephrin and antidepressants. Animal studies have
  found increased levels of ephrinA in response to stress in rats which is rescued
  by fluoxetine administration. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com].
