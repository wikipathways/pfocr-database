caption: A stress-related working model for heterotetrameric (A2•p11)2 complex formation
  and translocation to the cell surface. (A2•p11)2 cell surface translocation and
  activation is independent of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi pathway (outlined
  in grey). Unpartnered p11 monomers (yellow) within the cell are polyubiquitinated
  and degraded by the proteasome (grey). Annexin A2 (A2) monomers (green) are bound
  to p11 subunits. Under stress, intracellular calcium levels increase in response
  to various stimuli (blue), and this increases the affinity of the (A2•p11)2 complex
  for binding to anionic phospholipid (shown in dark pink) at the inner membrane surface.
  There, pp60-c-src kinase (purple) becomes activated following dephosphorylation
  of Tyr527 within its kinase domain, while Tyr416 within its SH2 domain remains phosphorylated.
  Once the (A2•p11)2 complex is phosphorylated (red circles) by pp60-c-src, it becomes
  more tightly associated with inner leaflet phosphatidyl serine (Ptd-L-Ser). The
  newly phospho-(A2•p11)2 complex may undergo a conformational change, making it more
  susceptible to translocation to the outer membrane surface. On the outer membrane
  surface, phospho-(A2•p11)2 associates with plasminogen (PLG) and tissue plasminogen
  activator (tPA), giving rise to active plasmin (PN).
