caption: PLPM models from TCGA cancer datasets. (a) PLPM for TCGA colorectal data
  (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012) using the 14 genes recurrently mutated by MutSisCV
  (Lawrence et al., ). Dashed boxes identify genes in the same pathway, with different
  colors for different pathways. (b) PLPM for TCGA colorectal data using 43 genes
  and the extension of our method that does not include all the genes in the model.
  Dashed boxes identify genes in the same pathway, with different colors for different
  pathways. (c) PLPM for TCGA glioblastoma multiforme data (Brennan et al., ). Dashed
  boxes identify genes that are in a set with at least another gene in the same pathway
  (as annotated in Brennan et al., ), with different colors for different pathways.
  For each PLPM, the p-value from the permutation test is reported, and the fraction
  of times genes appear in the same stage out of 100 bootstrap dataset is shown.
