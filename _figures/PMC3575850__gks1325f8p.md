caption: Hypothetical model for functional redundancy of Rad18 and NHEJ in responding
  to oxidative DNA damage during G1. During G1, H2O2-treatment generates SSB. The
  exposed ssDNA is RPA-coated leading to Rad18 recruitment and PCNA mono-ubiquitinated
  by Rad18 at sites of repair synthesis, thereby promoting Polη recruitment. Polη
  facilitates gap-filling (presumably at templates containing bi-stranded and clustered
  damage), thereby conferring DNA damage tolerance via TLS (left). In the absence
  of Rad18, inefficient gap-filling by the TLS pathway leads to accumulation of DSB,
  which is repaired by NHEJ, also conferring DNA damage tolerance.
