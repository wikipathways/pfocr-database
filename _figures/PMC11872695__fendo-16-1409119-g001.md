caption: Illustrates the interplay between gut microbiota, ImP production, and cardiometabolic
  diseases. Epidemiological studies have identified a strong association between elevated
  ImP levels and an increased risk of onset of T2D and obesity, exacerbation of kidney
  traits in CKD, progression of atherosclerotic plaques, and elevated mortality rates
  in HF. ImP is a microbial metabolite derived from histidine via urocanate reductase,
  an enzyme encoded by the UrdA gene. This pathway is predominantly associated with
  certain gut bacteria. ImP may contribute to the heightened risk of cardiometabolic
  diseases through mechanisms such as impaired intestinal barrier function, activation
  of the p38γ/p62/mTORC1 signaling pathway, promoting systemic inflammation, and impairing
  cardiac and renal function. CKD, chronic kidney disease; eGFR, estimated glomerular
  filtration rate; HF, heart failure; ImP, imidazole propionate; IRS1, insulin receptor
  substrates 1; IRS2, insulin receptor substrates 2; MT, mitochondria; mTORC1, mechanistic
  target of rapamycin complex 1; NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; SCFAs,
  short-chain fatty acids; T2D, type 2 diabetes; UAC, urinary albumin-to-creatinine
