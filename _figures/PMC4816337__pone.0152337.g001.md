caption: 'Fluid state activation of the alternative pathway leads to C3b that can
  indiscriminately bind to host or pathogen surface. On the right (pathogen), complement
  activity propagates without the disruption of regulatory proteins. On the left (host),
  plasma proteins in conjunction with surface-bound regulators actively inhibit complement
  propagation by disrupting complement interaction at different points of the alternative
  pathway. Abbreviations: C3, complement component 3; C3(H2O), thioester-hydrolyzed
  form of C3; C3(H2O)Bb, initial C3 convertase of AP; C3a, anaphylatoxin fragment
  from C3; C3b, activated fragment from C3; iC3b, inactivated C3b; nfC3b, nascent
