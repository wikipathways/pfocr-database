caption: This simplified schematic of the model shows progression through stages of
  tuberculosis infection, disease, and treatment, and shows opportunities to develop
  drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis (TB) via either acquisition or transmission of
  resistance. The arrows labeled as pathway “A” show how drug resistance in a previously
  treated case may result from prior treatment, and the arrows labeled as pathway
  “B” show how drug resistance in a previously treated case may result from transmission
  of resistance (with subsequent failure of the initial course of standard treatment).
  MDR-TB in a previously treated case, indicated by the box with a heavy outline,
  can result from either acquired (pathway A) or transmitted (pathway B) resistance.Asterisks
  (*) indicate that transitions through these states, including possibilities for
  reinfection, proceed as for states of the same name to the left (denoted with daggers
  (†)). Not shown here, but also included in the model, are subdivisions into treatment-naïve
  and treatment-experienced compartments (with differing probabilities of each treatment
  outcome; see ), and death and spontaneous cure (either of which can occur from any
  active disease or treatment state).
