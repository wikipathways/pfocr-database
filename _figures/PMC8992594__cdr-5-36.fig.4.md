caption: 'Mechanisms of resistance to immuno-therapy. Cancer cells can express several
  immunosuppressive molecules that can be blocked using specific inhibitors in order
  to re-activate the anti-tumor immune response. Often, they are redundant so that
  the re-activation of one pathway may be compensated by hyperactivation of a different
  immunosuppressive route so that resistance to therapy is the result. Resistance
  to anti-PD1 blockade may be due to overproduction and release of VEGFA, as well
  as by overexpression of IDO1 with consequent increased levels of kynurein in the
  microenvironment. Specific components of the microbiota are also necessary for the
  successful blockade of PD-1 and CTL-A4 indicating that antibiotics may represent
  a resistance factor to ICIs. Finally, concurrent blockade of two or more immune
  checkpoints has been shown to improve the response and overcome the resistance to
  ICIs. Pembro: Pembrolizumab; Nivo: nivolumab; Rela: relatlimab; Ipi: ipilumab; IDO1:
  indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1.'
