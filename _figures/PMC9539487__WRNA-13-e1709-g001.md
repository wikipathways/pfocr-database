caption: Processes involving RBPs and RNAexp in cytoplasm. (a) The role of eIF2D in
  RAN translation initiation. Non‐canonical translation initiation factor eIF2D delivers
  Met‐tRNA to the P‐site of 40S ribosomal subunit at CUG codon contributing to RAN
  translation initiation (described for G4C2exp). A (aminoacyl) site, P (peptidyl)
  site, E (exit) site in the ribosome. (b) Elongation of RAN translation. DHX36 helicase
  unwinds G‐quadruplexes formed by RNAexp and thus facilitates ribosome processivity
  and production of toxic homopolymeric proteins or dipeptide repeat proteins (described
  for G4C2exp and CGGexp). (c) RAN translation initiation upon stress. Stress related
  to the presence of double‐stranded RNA (dsRNA) formed by RNAexp and RAN proteins
  activates PKR and PERK kinases, respectively, which catalyze phosphorylation of
  eIF2α. This, in turn, inhibits eIF2α‐P binding to Met‐tRNA and the formation of
  preinitiation complex (PIC) with 40S ribosome subunit. Under the stress, eIF2A may
  take over role of phosphorylated eIF2α‐P, bind Met‐tRNA and participate in translation
  initiation at near‐cognate start codons (described for G4C2exp and CCUGexp). (d)
  Stress response caused by RNAexp. RNAi pathway component, ribonuclease Dicer, cleaves
  dsRNA formed by RNAexp hairpin or bidirectionally transcribed CUGexp/CAGexp duplex
  into 21‐mer fragments. Such RNA fragments may next activate TLRs and trigger innate
  immune response. (e) Stress granules formation. Stress stimuli such as RNAexp and
  RAN proteins lead to phosphorylation of eIF2α, followed by global translation suppression
  and formation of stress granules (SG; described for CGGexp and G4C2exp). Moreover,
  G4C2exp may serve as a core component of SG and promote formation of membraneless
  organelles composed of different mRNAs and SG protein markers. Chronic stress may
  entail SG transition towards more solid‐like structures. (f) Phase separation of
  RNAexp and RAN protein. Homopolymeric RAN protein, polyG, binds to its own RNAexp
  what promotes its phase transition from liquid droplets towards gel‐like aggregates
  (described for CGGexp). (a–c) arrow with a dotted line, change in place and/or in
  time; solid lines show induction or inhibition of certain processes
