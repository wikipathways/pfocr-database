caption: Schematic diagram of the cell signal pathway that p42 utilizes to suppress
  tumor growth by controlling PI3K activity through UPS. As most of the tumor cells
  exhibit an extremely low level of p42 protein, p85 may not have had access to the
  HSP70/CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation in tumors, allowing higher activation
  of PI3K. However, once p42 protein level is upregulated, p42 provides p85 to HSP70/CHIP
  complex for the degradation of p85 by interacting with p85 and HSP70/CHIP, thereby
  inhibiting PI3K activity
papertitle: P42 Ebp1 regulates the proteasomal degradation of the p85 regulatory subunit
  of PI3K by recruiting a chaperone-E3 ligase complex HSP70/CHIP.
