caption: PPP, which branches out from glycolysis at the first committed stage of glucose
  metabolism, is required for nucleotide synthesis in cancer cells. Numerous enzymes
  of the PPP are associated with various types of cancer. PPP, pentose phosphate pathway;
  GLUT, glucose transporter; G6PDH, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 6PGDH, 6-phosphogluconate
  dehydrogenase; RuPE, ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase; RPI, ribose-5-phosphate isomerase.
