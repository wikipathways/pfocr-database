caption: Simplified illustration of the main biochemical pathways for a metabolic
  control of TL length as proposed by the metabolic telomere attrition hypothesis.
  Immune activation, psychological stressors, growth, nutrient shortage and work load
  can negatively affect the cellular energy balance, leading to increased concentrations
  of metabolic regulators like glucocorticoids (GCs) and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK),
  partly through low ATP levels (i.e. at high AMP/ATP ratios, which activate AMPK).
  AMPK can inhibit the kinase TOR (target of rapamycin), which downregulates enzymes
  and proteins that maintain TL length. Likewise, GCs may also be able to inhibit
  TOR via REDD1 (‘Regulated in development and DNA Damage’ response proteins). TOR
  inhibition in turn suppresses Ku-proteins, which inhibit the TL maintenance enzyme
  telomerase while increasing exonuclease concentrations and thus the excision of
  nucleotides from TLs. Extensive TL shortening can cause ageing processes (dysfunctional
  mitochondria and cellular senescence pathway—left non-barred/yellow loop), while
  moderate TL attrition can promote immediate survival functions (functional phenotype
  pathway—right barred-blue loop). For example, when low levels of protein p53 are
  secreted, they promote moderate TL attrition, leading to mitochondrial functionality
  that includes increased concentrations of enzymatic antioxidants, improved oxidative
  phosphorylation and the generation of new mitochondria. By contrast, at high concentrations
  p53 disrupt mitochondria function, thereby decreasing cellular ATP levels while
  increasing the concentrations of oxidative molecules by depleting and/or downregulating
  antioxidant enzymes. The latter pathway is part of the ageing circuitry. Solid arrows,
  known activating processes; dashed arrows, proposed activating processes; black
  ‘Ts’, inhibiting processes. (Online version in colour.)
