caption: Role of adipocyte leptin in the proliferation of prostate cells infected
  with Trichomonas vaginalis. We investigated whether inflammation from Trichomonas
  vaginalis infection is involved in the proliferation of benign prostatic hyperplasia
  (BPH) in the obese state. Inflammatory mediators released by BPH epithelial cells
  infected with T. vaginalis triggered adipocyte migration and activation. Leptin
  produced from the activated adipocytes induced prostate cell proliferation through
  the leptin-OBR signaling pathway.
