caption: An illustration of the role of Tim-3 in breast cancer. Genetic polymorphisms
  in Tim-3 are associated with susceptibility to breast cancer. Tim-3+ CD8+ T cells
  and Tim-3+ CD4+ T cells are associated with risk of lymph node metastasis through
  Tim-3 mediated immune escape. Tim-3 is involved in insulin resistance. Tim-3 overexpression
  in breast cancer cells promotes cell proliferation, migration, invasion, tubal formation,
  and enhanced chemoresistance to paclitaxel by activating the NF-κB/STAT3 signaling
  pathway. The Tim-3-galectin-9 (Gal-9) pathway is involved in tumor progression given
  the surface-based Gal-9 protects breast carcinoma cells against cytotoxic T cell-induced
  death.
