caption: Role of Caspase-8 in cancer therapy. Caspase-8 may modulate the response
  to therapeutic approaches through canonical and non-canonical functions. Chemotherapy
  and radiotherapy promote DNA damage that in turn switches-on the enzymatic activation
  of Caspase-8, either directly or via the ATM-dependent downregulation of FLIP protein
  levels. Caspase-8 enzymatic activation promotes apoptosis therefore enhancing cancer
  cell sensitivity to chemotherapy and TRAIL. Cancer cells may rewire Caspase-8 functionality;
  in these contexts, Caspase-8 can promote NF-κB activity, cytokine production and
  DNA repair, therefore promoting resistance to chemotherapy. Overall, we suggest
  that this dual role of Caspase-8 in cancer may be exploited to ameliorate cancer
  therapy. Blue arrows for canonical pathway; green arrows for non canonical pathway.
