caption: 'Overview of cancer stem cell-associated pathways and their potential inhibitors
  in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Inhibitors are shown in red. From left
  to right: The mammalian JAK/STAT signaling pathway is made up of four proteins featuring
  the Janus kinase domain: JAK1-3 and TYK2, along with seven proteins belonging to
  the STAT family. JAKs are cytoplasmic proteins and are linked to transmembrane receptors.
  Binding of an extracellular ligand initiates the trans-phosphorylation of JAKs,
  which subsequently phosphorylate STAT monomers, which then migrate to the nucleus
  and regulate the transcription for target genes. Tinengotinib is a selective small-molecule
  kinase inhibitor, which inhibits JAK 1/2 and Aurora/STAT3 pathways. TTI-101 is small-molecule
  kinase inhibitor targeting STAT3. AZD9150 is a novel antisense nucleotide inhibitor
  of STAT3. In the Wnt canonical pathway, the degradation complex rapidly eliminates
  β-catenin in the absence of Wnt. When Wnt binds to its receptor Frizzled and the
  co-receptors LRP5/6, the destruction complex is disrupted, leading to the stabilization
  of β-catenin, which then translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription
  of target genes. In order for Wnt to bind Frizzled, palmitoleoylation on a hairpin
  2 motif by the O-acyltransferase Porcupine is necessary. LGK974 is a specific small-molecule
  inhibitor of Porcupine. PRI-724 is a novel modulator of Wnt signaling that prevents
  the interaction of CREB binding protein with β-catenin. Vantictumab is a mAb that
  binds to frizzled receptors and neutralizes canonical WNT signaling. Zilovertamab
  is a mAb against ROR1, a protein that stimulates the activity of the non-canonical
  Wnt signaling. Protein tyrosine kinase 7 is a Wnt pathway co-receptor and is a target
  of the antibody–drug conjugate cofetuzumab pelidotin. Foxy-5 is a peptide mimic
  of the WNT5A, designed to reconstitute lost WNT5A signaling, since WNT5A seems to
  reduce migration and invasion of cancer cells. Activation of the TGF-β pathway occurs
  when TGF-β interacts with its type II receptor, leading to the formation of a complex
  with the type I receptor. This complex subsequently recruits SMAD2 and SMAD3, which
  are phosphorylated and form a heteromeric complex with SMAD4. The resulting complex
  translocates into the nucleus of a tumor cell, where it activates the transcription
  of target genes. Fresolimumab, a human mAb that neutralizes all three isoforms of
  TGF-β. SRK-181 is a TGF-β1 mAb. NIS793 is a human anti-TGF-β1 IgG2 mAb. LY3022859
  is an anti-TGFβRII IgG mAb. Galunisertib is a small molecule inhibitor of the TGF-β
  receptor I. Comprising four cell surface receptors and five transmembrane ligands,
  the Notch signaling pathway necessitates direct cellular contact for its activation.
  When a Notch ligand attaches to a receptor on a neighboring cell, it initiates the
  release of the receptor’s intracellular domain—NICD. This release is accomplished
  through a series of cleavages carried out by ADAM proteases and γ-secretase. Once
  released, NICD transmits into the nucleus, where it regulates transcription of target
  gene. MK-0752, RO4929097, PF-03084014, crenigacestata and AL101 are γ-secretase
  inhibitors. Rovalpituzumab tesirine is an antibody–drug conjugate targeting one
  of the transmembrane ligands DLL3. Demcizumab is an anti-DLL4 mAb. CB-103 is an
  agent that prevents the released Notch receptor NICDs from activating transcription
  of target genes. Abbreviations: Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of
  transcription (JAK/STAT); low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRP5/6);
  protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7); transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β); suppressor
  of mother against decapentaplegic (SMAD); Notch receptor intracellular domain (NICD);
  Notch receptor extracellular domain (ECD); monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)'
