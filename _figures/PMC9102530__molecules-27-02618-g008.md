caption: 'Conceptual diagram of the effects of MeJA and oleic acid on terpene biosynthesis
  in I. hispidus, based on the results of this study. In plants, MeJA triggers a transcriptional
  rearrangement in the nucleus, which then starts a coordinated transcriptional response
  leading to an upregulation of the MEP pathway and oxidative stress. The red color
  indicates an increase and a decrease in metabolite abundance compared with untreated
  cells. MEP: 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate; ROS: reactive oxygen species.'
