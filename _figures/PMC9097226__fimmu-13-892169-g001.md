caption: Molecular mechanisms of BCR internalization. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis
  (green). Following BCR antigen binding, clathrin is recruited to BCR-antigen clusters,
  binding ITAM residues in the cytoplasmic tails of Igα and Igβ. Clathrin polymerization
  induces membrane-curvature and formation of CCPs. CCPs invaginate before scission
  from the PM mediated by dynamin, forming a CCV. CCVs containing BCR-antigen complexes
  fuse with late endosomes for antigen processing and subsequent presentation. Phagocytosis
  (blue). BCR binding to large, particulate antigens can induce local actin rearrangements,
  driving membrane protrusion to form a large membrane invagination. Once internalized
  in phagosomes, the membrane vesicle undergoes fusion events in parallel with other
  endocytic processes. Fast endophilin-mediated endocytosis (yellow). Within endophilin-primed
  membrane patches, BCR antigen binding results in endophilin-mediated membrane curvature
  with subsequent dynamin scission to form an intracellular vesicle. This pathway
  is specific for ligand-triggered, signaling receptors. Caveolin-dependent endocytosis
  (pink). Caveolin-1 controls the distribution of surface BCR into lipid rafts. Its
  role in antigen-mediated BCR internalization requires further investigation. Created
