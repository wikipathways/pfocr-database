caption: 'Calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway. Calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated
  T-lymphocytes (NFAT) signaling activation in the nervous system is mainly induced
  by neurotrophins via their tyrosine kinase receptors, glutamate receptors, and nonligand-dependent
  receptors, such as voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in hippocampal neurons. The genes
  transcribed and the effects of these signaling pathways are cell-type dependent.
  Abbreviations: AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid; BDNF,
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; IGF1R, insulin-like
  growth factor 1 receptor; IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor kappa B; NFATc, Ca2+-regulated NFATs; NGF, neurotrophin nerve growth factor;
  NMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid; RCAN1, regulator of calcineurin 1; RyR; ryanodine
