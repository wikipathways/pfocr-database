caption: In detailed study, Tamaru documented an interesting dichotomy between inverse
  demand hetero-[4 + 2] and [2 + 2] cycloadditions of allenamides (). Depending upon
  the alkene substitution pattern, allenamides can react with siloxydienes, enol ethers,
  and allylsilanes to either undergo [2 + 2] cycloadditions to exclusively provide
  cyclobutane derivatives, or a hetero-[4 + 2] cycloaddition pathway with a vinyl
  N-acyl imine intermediate resulting from an initial 1,3-Ts shift. While details
  of this excellent and thorough investigation will not be digested here and can be
  found in the original paper, see Section 3.6.5 for discussions on the 1,3-Ts-shift–inverse
  demand hetero-[4 + 2] cycloaddition cascade.
