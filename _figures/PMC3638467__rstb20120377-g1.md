caption: Biochemical pathway proposed for 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene biodegradation in
  the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas pavonaceae 170. The first step in the biodegradation
  of this organohalide is catalysed by a hydrolytic haloalkane dehalogenase (DhaA,
  E.C. 3.8.1.5) that has broad substrate specificity. After two sequential oxidation
  steps catalysed by an alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) and an aldehyde dehydrogenase
  (Aldh), the first intermediate metabolite (3-chloro-2-propene-1-ol) is converted
  into 3-chloro-2-propenal and finally into 3-chloropropenoic acid. The latter compound
  is the substrate for a 3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase (CaaD, E.C. 3.8.1; composed
  by CaaD1, the α subunit, and CaaD2, the β subunit) that yields 3-oxopropanoate (malonate
  semialdehyde). This metabolite finally enters into the central metabolic pathways
  upon decarboxylation by a malonate semialdehyde decarboxylase. Components X and
  Y represent electron acceptors which have not been identified yet. (Online version
