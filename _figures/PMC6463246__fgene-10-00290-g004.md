caption: Ribosomal siRNAs silence pre-rRNAs via the nuclear RNAi pathway. rRNA biogenesis
  is a multistep process, including a series of pre-rRNA processing, folding, and
  modification steps. Endogenous metabolic stresses and environmental stimuli can
  cause RNA processing disorders, leading to the accumulation of erroneous RNAs. This
  accumulation leads to the recruitment of RdRPs to synthesize risiRNA, subsequently
  turning on the nuclear RNAi-mediated gene silencing pathway to inhibit pre-rRNA
  expression.
