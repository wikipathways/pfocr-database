caption: 'Sites of cellular PPi formation and details of galactose metabolism. (a)
  The majority of PPi is produced through four pathways: DNA, RNA, protein and phospholipid
  synthesis. Many more pathways contribute to the PPi concentration in the cell. PPi
  is hydrolyzed by differently localized PPA (PPA1/PPA2) to two molecules of Pi. (b)
  UDP-glucose is produced out of glucose-1-phosphate, which produces PPi. UDP-glucose
  is necessary for the breakdown of galactose, which is further metabolized in glycolysis.
  Abbreviations: UTP, uridine diphosphate; PPi, pyrophosphate; PPA, pyrophosphatases;
  Pi, orthophosphate. This figure was created with BioRender.com'
