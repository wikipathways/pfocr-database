caption: Linking the actin-folding capacity to MRTF-A/SRF signaling. Summary of the
  interplay between the folding of actin by the CCT oligomer and the SRF pathway.
  The CCT oligomer is essential for the folding of newly synthesized actin (blue).
  If less CCT oligomer is assembled, then levels of monomeric CCTε will increase and
  prevent MRTF-A (shown here as M) from entering the nucleus.
papertitle: A novel function of the monomeric CCTε subunit connects the serum response
  factor pathway to chaperone-mediated actin folding.
