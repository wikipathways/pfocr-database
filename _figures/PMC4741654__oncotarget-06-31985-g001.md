caption: The core of this metabolic network is the cell redoxstate expressed by the
  cytosolic NADP/NADPH ratio. This ratio regulates the transfer of reducing equivalents
  (H+) from the methylen-tetrahydro-folate (CH2-FH4) to methenyl-tetrahydro-folate
  (CH-FH4). This NADP-dependent reaction (generating NADPH) is a limiting step of
  the synthesis of purine ring required for the amplification of purine pools indispensable
  for G1-S transition. A fundamental role in the regulation of NADP/NADPH ratio is
  played by folate, whose anaerobic reduction to FH4 by dehydrofolate-reductase (DHFR)
  generates NADP, compensating the anaerobic restriction of this factor. Whatever
  the mechanism increasing cytosolic NADPH, including pyruvate, glutamine through
  the glutaminolytic pathway, or the inhibition of DHFR by an excess of FH4, the cytosolic
  NADPH increase has an inhibitory effect on cell recruitment into S, unless it is
  removed by the shuttle mechanisms, which discharge the cytosolic reducing equivalents
  onto the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This role of the shuttles accounts for
  the fact that the activity of the chain is crucial for the G1/S transition, which
  is impaired by a specific inhibitor like antimycin A or by anaerobiosis. A similar
  inhibition can be brought about out in air whenever the chain, although not inhibited,
  is saturated by reducing equivalents produced by oxidizable substrates of the Krebs
  cycle, mostly pyruvate. This inhibitory effect of pyruvate accounts for the crucial
  role of its disposal of by the reduction to lactate, and the consequent exportation
  into the environment, in hypoxia-adapted cancer cells in air (the aerobic glycolysis,
  traditionally named the Warburg's effect).
