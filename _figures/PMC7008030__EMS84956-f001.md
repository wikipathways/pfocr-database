caption: '(a) Wild type P. pastoris uses methanol (MeOH) for biomass generation in
  the assimilatory branch of the methanol utilization by fixation of formaldehyde
  (FA) to xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu5P) which is regenerated in the xylulose monophosphate
  (XuMP) cycle (purple pathway) and as an energy source in the dissimilatory branch
  (pink pathway) by oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2) under formation of NADH. (b)
  In an engineered strain methanol assimilation is blocked by deletion of dihydroxyacetone
  synthase (DAS1 and DAS2) and a Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle is integrated.
  Additionally the alcohol oxidase 1 gene (AOX1) was deleted. RuBisCO carboxylates
  ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) which is regenerated in the CBB cycle; abbreviations:
  alcohol oxidase (Aox), formaldehyde dehydrogenase (Fld1), S-formylglutathione hydrolase
  (Fgh1), formate dehydrogenase (Fdh1), ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
  (RuBisCO), dihydroxyacetone (DHA), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP), 3-phosphoglycerate
  (3PGA), glutathione (GSH), ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP); A detailed depiction
  of the two pathways including all involved enzymes is given in .'
