caption: Regulation of WBP2 by the Hippo signalling pathway. (A) Overview of the modes
  of action of how WBP2 can be regulated by Hippo pathway in cancer. In the nucleus,
  WBP2 negatively regulates miRNA biogenesis through its interaction with MPC components,
  hence disrupting the MPC complex and its miRNA processing capacity. On the other
  hand, the nuclear accumulation of YAP and the activation of MST maintains the high
  expression of Dicer. Pre-miRNAs are processed by Dicer in the cytosol to mature
  miRNAs in turns target WBP2. Some miRNAs known to target WBP2 include miR-19a/b,
  miR-23a, miR-27a, miR-206, miR-485 and miR-613. WBP2 level is also regulated by
  proteasomal degradation where the interaction of WBP2 with ITCH via the WW-PPxY
  domain facilitates the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of WBP2. ITCH
  E3 ubiquitin ligase promotes the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of LATS.

  pathway drives cancer progression. Created with BioRender.com.
