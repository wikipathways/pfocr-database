caption: Mechanisms underlying SALL4 regulation and function in liver cancer. SALL4
  expression is inhibited by miR-15a, which leads to decreased proliferation, migration,
  and invasion of HCC cells. TNF-α inhibits miR-497 expression and upregulates SALL4.
  SALL4 promotes hepatocarcinogenesis by activating the PTEN/AKT pathway and targeting
  miR-146a-5p, which further promotes cancer development. As a transcription factor,
  SALL4 up-regulates the hepatic stem cell markers KRT19, EPCAM, and CD44
