caption: Mechanisms and Roles of cGAS-STING Pathway in Regulating DC Subpopulations
  for Antitumor Immunity. This figure illustrates the activation mechanisms of the
  cGAS-STING signaling pathway in different DC subpopulations (pDCs, cDC1, and cDC2)
  and its impact on tumor immunity. After tumor-derived DNA enters the cytoplasm of
  DCs, it activates the cGAS-STING pathway, inducing the production of IFN-I, which
  in turn promotes the maturation of DC subpopulations and T cell activation. Specifically,
  pDCs sense tumor-derived DNA through the intracellular cGAS-STING pathway, inducing
  the production of IFN-I and subsequently activating downstream immune responses.
  However, in the TIME, the STING signaling pathway in pDCs may be inhibited, leading
  to immune evasion. cDC1 is a key cell type for initiating CD8+ T cell activation.
  The nanoparticle STING agonist PolySTING can specifically activate the STING-IFN-I
  signaling axis in cDC1, enhancing its ability to cross-present antigens and driving
  CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immune responses. Additionally, IFN-I secreted by
  a subset of activated CD4+ T cells can enhance the activation capacity of cDC1 towards
  CD8+ T cells. cDC2 plays a central role in initiating the naïve CD4+ T cell immune
  response. The combination of the STING agonist ADU-S100 with anti-TIM-3 immune checkpoint
  blockade therapy can promote cDC2 maturation and functional optimization, leading
  to enhanced CD4+ T cell activation and tumor infiltration
