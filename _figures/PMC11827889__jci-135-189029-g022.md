caption: The findings of Peach et al. demonstrate that interfering with the TrkA/NGF/NRP1
  protein complex, or with GIPC1-mediated assembly and/or trafficking of this complex
  influences NGF-driven pain. Because many of the genes involved in this signaling
  pathway are ubiquitously expressed, developing safe therapeutics for this pathway
  remains a challenge. Previous strategies such as tanezumab blocks NGF actions everywhere
  and have had safety issues. Similarly, targeting NRP1, GIPC1, NGF, and p75 to some
  extent, would also have an effect in all tissues expressed. Notably, the TrkA/NGF/NRP1
  protein complex can impart specificity because the intersection of the expression
  and function of these proteins is relatively specific for DRG neurons and their
  axons, which innervate peripheral tissues
