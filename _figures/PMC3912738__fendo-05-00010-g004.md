caption: Schematic representation of the cross-talks between the Notch and the IGF
  signaling. The Notch receptor is activated by the binding to ligands (Delta-like
  1/3/4; Jagged-1/2) presented by a neighboring cell. Notch activation requires three
  consecutive proteolytic cleavages. The final cleavage is mediated by a γ-secretase
  complex, which releases an active fragment (Notch-IC). Notch-IC, then, translocates
  into the nucleus where it interacts with the DNA-binding protein CSL (suppressor
  of Hairless), a constitutive transcription repressor. Upon Notch-IC binding, CSL
  undergoes allosteric modifications, which displace co-repressors and recruit co-activators
  (CoAs) to activate transcription. Notch dependent signaling induces several genes
  associated with differentiation, survival, stemness, and EMT. Notch target genes
  include Hes and Hey family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, D-cyclins,
  transcription and growth factors relevant to EMT and to IGF-IR/PI3K pathway. Notch
  signaling is often and aberrantly activated by hypoxia through HIF-1-α. Under hypoxic
  conditions, Notch-1 stimulates IGF-IR transcription by regulating its promoter and
  amplifying the mitogenic effects mediated by IGF-IR/PI3K signaling.
