caption: (A) Under conditions where PTEN is present, Akt is activated predominantly
  by the RTK-p110α pathway, as occurs in the liver after insulin stimulation. Insulin-induced
  activation of Akt results in the phosphorylation of FOXO transcription factors and
  ultimately, the inhibtion of target gene expression. However, p110β is required
  for full repression of glucoeneogenic gene expression (e.g., the PEPCK gene) by
  insulin, suggesting that this isoform activates downstream kinases in addition to
  Akt and/or regulates transcription factors in addition to FOXO. The specific activation
  of non-Akt kinases by p110β may require either the generation of spacially restricted
  pools of PIP3 within the cell or the generation of quantities of PIP3 exceeding
  those required for Akt activation.(B) Under conditions where PTEN expression is
  reduced, as occurs in many human tumors, the basal level of PIP3 is increased due
  to unopposed p110β activity. These increased basal levels of PIP3 result in increased
  Akt activity and increased cell growth. In both scenarios (A and B) p110β may also
  function in a PIP3-independent manner such that its catalytic activity is not required
  for regulation of downstream signaling. In this model, p110β serves as a “molecular
  scaffold” for recruiting additional catalytically active signaling molecules. See
  text for further details.
