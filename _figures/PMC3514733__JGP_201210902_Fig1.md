caption: 'Chemotactic signaling pathway in sea urchin sperm. Resact, the chemoattractant
  peptide, binds to receptor GC and, thereby, stimulates the rapid synthesis of cGMP.
  The ensuing surge in cGMP opens K+-selective cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNGK) (; ;
  ) channels to produce a brief hyperpolarization of the cell membrane. This hyperpolarization
  activates two other signaling components: an NHE and a hyperpolarization-activated
  cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) channel (; ). NHE activity causes a rapid alkalinization
  of the cytosol (; ). Upon opening of HCN channels, the ensuing Na+ inward current
  depolarizes the cell and leads to the opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels
  (Cav). Recovery from stimulation involves restoration of resting [Ca2+]i by a Na+–Ca2+–K+
  exchanger (NCKX) () and hydrolysis of cGMP by a phosphodiesterase (PDE) (). The
  physiological role of a soluble adenylate cyclase (not depicted) () and of the second
  messenger cAMP is not known.'
