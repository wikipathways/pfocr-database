caption: The conflicting relationship between the Hippo pathway and apoptosis. (A)
  LATS1/2 helps p53 bind to the proapoptotic promoter by promoting apoptosis-stimulating
  protein of p53-1 (ASPP) entry into the nucleus and inhibiting YAP and murine double
  minute2 (MDM2); at the same time, p53 also actively regulates LATS2, thus forming
  a positive loop of LATS1/2 and p53. (B) Having received the signal of genotoxic
  stress, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl phosphorylates p73 and YAP at different
  tyrosine sites, different from the phosphorylation by LATS, the latter being able
  to stabilize p73 after phosphorylation. Furthermore, c-Abl is a negative regulator
  of TEADs, which co-activates anti-apoptotic target genes with YAP. (C) The MST2-Raf1
  complex prevents MST2 activation. The complex can be abolished and the inactivation
  can be reversed by RAS association domain family 1A (RASSF1A). When RASSF1A is present,
  LATS1/2 does not isolate YAP outside the nucleus, but facilitates its entry into
  the nucleus and binding to p73, thereby transcribing proapoptotic genes. Although
  YAP is not phosphorylated at tyrosine sites at this point, it exerts a proapoptotic
  effect. It is LATS1/2 that plays the ‘the Yin-Yang dynamics’ role. (D) Instead of
  dampening apoptosis by disrupting LATS2-ASPP1 binding, YAP upregulates p53 expression,
  bringing about apoptosis by directly binding to TP53 gene promoter, but the transcription
  factor remains unknown. p53 can bind to the YAP promoter and upregulate YAP expression
  as well, forming another positive loop.
