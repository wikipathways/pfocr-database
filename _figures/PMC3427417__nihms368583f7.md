caption: Nicotine-induced α7nAChR/JAK2 pathway in cooperation with nicotine-mediated
  ERK1/2 activation potentiates STAT3 activation in PC cells. The ERK1/2-mediated
  STAT3 phosphorylation (pS727) is known to enhance the DNA binding as well as to
  stabilize the cytoplasmic STAT3 levels. Whereas, the phosphorylated STAT3 (Y705)
  forms a dimer and translocate into the nucleus where it plays the key role in the
  up-regulation of MUC4 mucin expression. The transmembrane MUC4 mucin, upon expression
  on the membrane of the cells, causes an alteration in the migratory potential of
  PC cells. MUC4, being a large sized protein, could be speculated to either directly
  inhibit the interaction between the integrin and the extra cellular matrix (ECM)
  by stearic hindrance, or it could alter the downstream signaling pathways mediated
  by HER2 and c-Src activation, resulting in the activation of integrin and FAK signaling.
  This leads to the suppression of cell–cell adhesion, thereby causing an increase
  in the migratory potential of PC cells. Altogether, these events result in cancer
  cell spread and hence contribute to metastasis of pancreatic cancer.
