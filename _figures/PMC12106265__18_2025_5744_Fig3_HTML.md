caption: 'Mechanisms of ER stress in DILI. ER stress can lead to an accumulation of
  unfolded proteins and the UPR pathway aiming to restore ER balance (illustrated
  by solid arrows). Continued or excessive insult activates the alternative signaling
  pathway, leading to apoptosis (illustrated by dotted arrows and red boxes). Three
  transmembrane receptors lead to three different signaling pathways of the UPR: IRE1α,
  PERK and ATF6. Activated IRE1 cleaves XBP1 mRNA leading to a spliced version of
  the transcript sXBP1, and increased levels of sXPB1 has been shown in response to
  certain drugs. Upon translation, the sXBP1 protein translocates to the nucleus inducing
  the expression of UPR genes. Alternatively, severe ER stress can lead to IRE1a-recruitment
  of TRAF2. TRAF2 in turn activates ASK1 and JNK. ASK1 also activates p38 MAPK and
  the transcription factor CHOP, which has been found to be upregulated upon stimulation
  with several drugs. CHOP migrates to the nucleus inducing apoptotic gene expression.
  The PERK signaling pathway begins with PERK phosphorylation of the eIF2α, repressing
  global translation. Only selected transcripts are translated, such as ATF4, which
  induces UPR gene expression. Both ATF4 and (p)eIF1α levels are upregulated by certain
  drugs. In cases of severe ER stress ATF4 can also activate CHOP and instead result
  in apoptotic gene expression. Lastly, ER stress can activate ATF6. ATF6 translocates
  from the ER to the Golgi apparatus where it is cleaved by S1P and S2P. Cleaved ATF6
  then traffics to the nucleus initiating UPR gene expression. ATF6 can also activate
  CHOP in situations of severe ER stress. In addition to the UPR pathways, ER stress
  can also lead to ER mediated Ca2 + release into the cytosol. This can activate Calpain
  and subsequently Caspase 12 inducing apoptosis. DILI: Drug Induced Liver Injury,
