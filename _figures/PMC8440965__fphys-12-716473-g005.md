caption: 'SαKI as a regulator of exercise-activated molecular signaling pathways.
  (A) Following a bout of strength exercise, plasma SαKI levels fall so that the signaling
  pathway PI3K-Akt-mTOR is activated through IGF-1 induction with the main objective
  of protein synthesis. (B) Plasma SαKI levels rise in response to elevated ROS produced
  by the exercise stimulus just after completing the session in the case of cardiorespiratory
  exercise and starting 24h after its completion in the case of strength exercise.
  ROS levels are regulated through the activation by FOXO of enzymes such as SOD2.
  FOXO: Forkhead box O; IGF-1: insulin growth factor type 1; IGF-1R: insulin growth
  factor type 1 receptor; ROS: reactive oxygen species; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
  Akt: serine/threonine kinase; mTOR: target mechanism of rapamycin kinase.'
