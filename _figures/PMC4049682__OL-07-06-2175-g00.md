caption: Pathways of PC metabolism. Enyzmatic reactions are indicated by numbers.
  Dashed lines present more reaction steps. 1 and 2, PC synthesis via the CDP-choline
  pathway; 3, the CDP-ethanolamine pathway of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis;
  4, PC synthesis by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase; 5 and 6, PC degradation
  by various phospholipases and lysophospholipases. PC, phosphatidylcholine; CDP,
  cytidine diphosphate.

  in non-small-cell lung cancer tissue predicts shorter patient survival.
