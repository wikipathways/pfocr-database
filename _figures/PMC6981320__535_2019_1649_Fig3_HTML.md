caption: Schematic summary of bile acid (BA) biosynthesis, transport and metabolism.
  BAs are synthesized in hepatocytes via cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated oxidation
  of cholesterol to the primary bile acids through “classical” and “alternative” pathways,
  in which cholesterol 7-α-monooxygenase (CYP7A1) and sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1)
  are the major limited enzymes, respectively. BAs are transported into the bile canaliculus
  by bile salt export pump (BSEP). In ileum, bile salts are reabsorbed via apical
  sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT) in terminal ileum enterocytes. Activation
  of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) by bile salts releases fibroblast growth factor 19
  (FGF19) into the portal circulation. FGF19 binds to its receptor fibroblast growth
  factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), and inhibits CYP7A1, thus repressing bile acid synthesis
  in hepatocytes. BAs in ileum enterocytes can also be secreted into the portal vein
  by organic solute transporter α/β (OST α/β), and then transported to hepatocytes
  via Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). In liver, BAs from the portal
  circulation bind to FXR, which activates small heterodimer partner (SHP) to repress
  CYP7A1. Primary bile acids (CA, CDCA) from the host are ligands for FXR, while secondary
  bile acids (LCA, DCA) from the microbiota are preferential ligands for Takeda-G-protein-receptor
  5 (TGR5, also known as GPBAR1). In the ileal endocrine cells (L cells), activation
  of TGR5 stimulates the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which induces
  insulin secretion from the pancreas, and suppresses appetite and slows down gastric
  emptying. In addition, GLP-1 can inhibit liver fat accumulation via the cAMP/AMPK
  signaling pathway. CA cholic acid, CDCA chenodeoxycholic acid, LCA lithocholic acids,
  DCA deoxycholic acid, FFA free fatty acid, SREBP-1 sterol regulatory element-binding
