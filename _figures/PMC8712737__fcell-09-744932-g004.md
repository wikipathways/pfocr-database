caption: A depiction of the disease features of the ceRNA network-involved pathway.
  Proteins encoded by risk genes concerning inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and
  remodeling and related complexes are indicated in orange, green, and blue respectively,
  while those in red character represented encoding genes indicate the ceRNA regulation-containing
  genes with regulatory SNPs. Yellow represents the significant elements related to
  all disease features in a pathway.
