caption: 'Schematic representation of PbTx-1-induced signaling in sensory neurons.
  PbTx-1 binds Nav channels (TTX-s and TTx-r) and increases Cat-S activity (mechanisms
  not fully understood), which activates PAR2 and its biased pathway including PKA
  and TRPV4. Other mediators activate PAR2 internalization, PKC and IP3R. PAR2 activation
  leads to TRPV4 sensitization through PKA and/or PKC. IP3R and TRPV4 mediate [Ca2+]i
  increase, which in turn leads to SP release. Grey arrow: not demonstrated here.
