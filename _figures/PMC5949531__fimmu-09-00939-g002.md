caption: Nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling cascade. NGF is produced during development
  and into maturity by immune and nerve cells as well as peripheral effector cells,
  such as keratinocytes, melanocytes, and fibroblasts. NGF exhibits high affinity
  to receptor TrkA and low affinity to receptor p75. The binding of NGF through receptor
  TrkA induces autophosphorylation of TrkA receptor and activation of P13K/Akt pathway
  leading to neuronal differentiation, survival, and neurite. NGF binding to receptor
  p75 activate c-Jun kinase (JNK) and NF-κB pathways resulting in neuronal apoptosis
  and survival respectively.
