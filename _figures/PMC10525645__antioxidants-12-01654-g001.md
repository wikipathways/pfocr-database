caption: Scheme of copper distribution in a mammalian cell. Copper is taken up via
  copper transporter 1 (CTR1), divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), or a putative
  transporter (all depicted as red circles). After being imported into the cell, copper
  is transferred to the chaperones, antioxidant protein 1 (ATOX1), copper chaperone
  (CCS), and cytochrome-c-oxidase copper chaperone (COX17), which ferry the copper
  (indicated by black arrows) to copper-transporting ATPase (ATP7A/B, shown in blue)
  in the Golgi complex, to Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1, shown in magenta) in
  the cytosol, and to cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX, shown in green) in the mitochondria.
  The mitochondrial phosphate carrier protein (SLC25A3) transfers the copper into
  the matrix. In the Golgi complex, the ATP7A/B loads the copper onto newly synthesized
  cuproenzymes, such as ceruloplasmin (Cp, shown in orange circle), which transport
  it along the biosynthetic pathway (indicated by orange arrow). A significant increase
  in intracellular Cu induces the export of ATP7A/B (indicated by blue arrow) toward
  the post-Golgi compartments (TGN) and plasma membrane, where it drives the excretion
  of excessive copper from the cell. The copper metabolism MURR1 domain protein 1
  (COMMD1) is involved in copper transport and protein trafficking/degradation. Excessive
  copper could bind to cysteine-rich proteins, known as metallothioneins (MTs, shown
  in pink). The scheme is modified from our article [].
