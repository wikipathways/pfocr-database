caption: Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway requires two signals.
  The signal 1 or priming (left) is provided by the activation of TLRs or cytokine
  receptors, leading to the NF-κB activation that upregulates the levels of several
  inflammasome components such as the protein NLRP3, proIL-1β and proIL-18. In addition,
  during the priming step, JNK-mediated phosphorylation occurs at S194 of NLRP3. Signal
  2 or activation (right) is provided by any of numerous PAMPs or DAMPs including
  virus, cholesterol, potassium efflux, reactive oxygen species (ROS), extracellular
  ATP and lysosomal dysfunction, among others. ASC, an adaptor protein, recruits NLRP3
  and procaspase-1 to form the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. Caspase 1 promotes the
  processing of interleukins for its subsequent release.
