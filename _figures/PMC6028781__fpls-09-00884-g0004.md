caption: Central carbon and nitrogen metabolism of Arabidopsis thaliana active in
  most growth stages and conditions simulated. Full Calvin-Benson cycle was active
  in leaf during the light phases. A complete TCA cycle was mainly active at the dark
  phases of leaf and in light and dark phases of root. Full oxidative pentose phosphate
  pathway reactions were active at the dark phases in leaf plastid and in light and
  dark phases of root plastid. These pathways were omitted from the flux map for clarity.
  The thickness of the arrows is not scaled to relative flux magnitudes. Bold lines
  indicate reactions identified as essential by FVA under most of the growth days.
