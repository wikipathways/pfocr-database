caption: Pro-survival signaling in HER2-positive breast cancer and the effect of inhibition
  of HER2, mTOR, and glycolysis. Schematic representation of signaling pathways in
  HER2-positive breast cancer cells. HER2 and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) stimulates
  the RAS-ERK-RSK and Akt-mTOR pathways. Activation of mTOR signaling phosphorylates
  S6 kinase 1 (S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1;
  not shown). The LKB1-AMP-dependent protein kinase alpha (AMPK) pathway negatively
  regulates mTOR signaling by activation of the mTOR inhibitors tuberous sclerosis
  complex-1 and -2 (TSC1/2). In HER2-positive breast cancer, HER2 inhibitors reduce
  the activity of the RAS-ERK-RSK and Akt-mTOR pathways and down-regulate glycolytic
  activity. However, re-activation of the mTOR pathway occurs, consequently enhancing
  glycolysis, pro-survival, and cell proliferation pathways. Treatment using mTOR
  inhibitors, such as rapamycin and rapalogs, in HER2-positive breast cancer prevents
  phosphorylation of S6K, inhibits cell proliferation, and reduces aerobic glycolysis
  through down-regulation of glycolytic enzymes. Prolonged inhibition of mTOR activates
  pro-survival pathways in a pERK-RSK- and Akt-dependent manner. The glucose analog
  2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) suppresses aerobic glycolysis, activates PI3K signaling,
  and promotes phosphorylation of AMPK on T172 to inhibit mTOR signaling.
