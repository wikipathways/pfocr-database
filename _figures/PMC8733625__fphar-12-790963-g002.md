caption: Inhibitory signaling of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. PD-1 is present on T-cells,
  antigen presenting cells, macrophages, and regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Linkage of
  PD-1 with its ligands results in downregulation of proliferation and immune response
  of T-cells. Inhibiting the PD-1 or PD-L1 pathway reverses this action and upregulates
  immune activity. The figure was created with BioRender.com.
