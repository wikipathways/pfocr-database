caption: Model of molecular mechanism of CIGB‐552. CIGB‐552 penetrates the cell by
  transduction and/or endocytosis, it interacts with COMMD1 stabilizing it, preventing
  its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and inducing its nuclear translocation.
  Once in the nucleus, COMMD1 inhibits the NF‐κB transcriptional activity leading
  eventually to a process of apoptosis. In the cytosol, the complex COMMD1–CIGB‐552
  activates the apoptotic pathway through oxidative stress, the modulation of Bax/Bcl‐2
  ratio, and the activation of Caspase 8 and Caspase 9. Red arrows indicate inhibition,
  and green arrows indicate activation. PS, phosphatidylserine; C, cytochrome C
