caption: In non-canonical forward signalling (bottom cell, right-hand pathway), the
  carboxy-terminal fragment (ErbB4-CTF) is cleaved by γ-secretase to produce ErbB4-intracellular
  domain (ErbB4-ICD), which can translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression.
  When it is overexpressed in transfected cells, ErbB4-ICD interacts with several
  transcriptional regulators, including Eto2, STAT5, Mdm2 and YAP, to mediate the
  transcriptional activation or repression of heterologous promoters (not shown),
  , , , , . This interaction might require the phosphorylation of either ErbB4-ICD
  or the transcriptional regulator and/or the kinase activity of the ICD domain. For
  example, neuregulin 1 (NRG1) stimulation promotes the association of ErbB4-ICD with
  TAB2, an adaptor protein, in an ErbB4 kinase-domain-dependent manner. TAB2 also
  interacts with the nuclear receptor co-repressor, N-CoR, to form a ternary complex
  that, upon translocation into the nucleus, represses the transcription of genes
  that are required for the differentiation of neural precursor cells into astrocytes.
  Backward signalling (top cell) by pro-NRG1 can proceed by two mechanisms. First,
  the C-terminal fragment of pro-NRG1 (NRG1-CTF), which is generated by extracellular
  cleavage, can be cleaved again by γ-secretase to generate NRG1-intracellular domain
  (NRG1-ICD), which can relocate into the nucleus to regulate gene transcription (left-hand
  pathway). Second, ErbB4 or ecto-ErbB4, which is released by extracellular cleavage,
  can serve as a ligand for pro-NRG1 or Type III NRG1, which function as receptors
  (right-hand pathway). It is unknown whether this interaction alters the phosphorylation
  of pro-NRG1 itself or whether it alters the activation of an intracellular kinase
  or phosphatase in pro-NRG1-expressing cells. Precisely how the signals are transduced
  also remains unknown. The cytoplasmic tail of pro-NRG1 interacts with the non-receptor
  protein kinase LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1), . This kinase has been shown to regulate actin
  dynamics in many cell types, including neurons. Interestingly, NRG1-ICD is required
  for NRG1 function in vivo. Treatment of Type III NRG1-expressing neurons with a
  mixture of ecto-ErbB2 and ecto-ErbB4 promotes neuronal survival in vitro and alters
  the expression of several apoptotic genes (not shown). Canonical forward signalling
  (bottom cell, left-hand pathway) is explained in detail in .
