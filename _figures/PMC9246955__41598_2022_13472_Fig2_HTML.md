caption: Riluzole regulates Wnt-β-catenin and mitochondrial pathways by RNA-Seq. Pancreatic
  cancer cells (MIA PaCa-2) were treated with Riluzole for 36 h. RNA was isolated.
  RNA-Seq was performed as described in Materials and methods. (A), Heat Map. Differential
  expression of genes in MIA PaCa-2 cells treated with or without riluzole. (B), Data
  analysis identified modulation of Wnt-β-catenin and mitochondrial pathways by riluzole
  in pancreatic cancer cells.
