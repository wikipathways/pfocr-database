caption: Retromer-mediated pathogenic pathway in PD. In physiological states (left
  panel), the retromer participates in the activation and CI-MPR-mediated sorting
  of CTSD, a major lysosomal hydrolase for α-syn degradation. The clearance of neurotoxic
  α-syn species largely depends on the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, especially macroautophagy
  and CMA. Retromer modulates the retrograde transport of LAMP2A, a receptor for CMA,
  from endosomes to the TGN, thereby preventing its degradation in lysosomes. In addition,
  retromer regulates the surface recycling of GluA1, D1R and DAT and thus influences
  synaptic function. Furthermore, retromer might participate in the autophagic machinery
  and mitochondrial dynamics, which are key processes in the maintenance of neuronal
  homeostasis. In the PD brain (right panel), retromer function is disturbed by aging,
  environmental toxin exposure, or genetic alterations. The familial PD-linked mutant
  VPS35 disrupts the molecular interaction between VPS35 and the WASH complex, which
  hampers retromer-mediated cargo sorting to the TGN. The perturbation of endosome-TGN
  trafficking hampers CTSD trafficking, thereby leading to abnormal α-syn accumulation
  in lysosomes. Likewise, retromer failure impairs the endosome-to-TGN retrieval of
  LAMP2A and accelerates its degradation in lysosomes, which compromises the CMA-mediated
  degradation of cytotoxic α-syn. Moreover, mutant VPS35 causes autophagic failure,
  which is partly explained by the mislocalization of autophagy protein ATG9A. Additionally,
  retromer failure increases the expression level of GluA1 and D1R on the plasma membrane,
  and thus induces synaptic dysfunction. In addition, mutant VPS35 has detrimental
  effects on mitochondrial fission-fusion dynamics and PINK1-PARKIN-mediated mitophagy,
  which results in mitochondrial dysfunction and fragmentation. The PD-linked DNAJC13
  mutation influences on the trafficking of multiple cargoes possibly due to the alteration
  of the membrane dynamics via retromer-related WASH complex and SNX1. CI-MPR, cation-independent
