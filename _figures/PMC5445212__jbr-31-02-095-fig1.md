caption: Endosomal transport channels and regulation of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol
  in hepatocytes.In many models, it was thought that cholesterol from all sources
  would enter a common regulatory pool before subsequent trafficking and regulatory
  steps. We present evidence here that supports a model where there is independent
  uptake, trafficking and regulation of cholesterol taken up from LDL, chylomicron
  remnants (CR) and HDL. HDL-derived cholesterol is taken up by SR-BI or ecto-F1-ATPase/P2Y13
  (right side), directed to the apical surface of the plasma membrane and released
  into the bile. CR-derived cholesterol (from the diet; middle section) is directed
  to the ER membrane to interact with SCAP (so-called “regulatory’ pool) to prevent
  release of SREBP2, thereby preventing upregulation of transcription of LDLR and
  HMGCR (among others). Excess cholesterol in the ER membrane can be esterified to
  CE by ACAT1 and stored within a cytosolic lipid droplet (LD). LDL-derived cholesterol
  is directed to a subdomain of the ER where the cholesterol is esterified by ACAT2.
  This CE is directed toward the lumen of the ER to interact with apoB-100 forming
  a precursor VLDL particle. Upon sufficient lipidation, the VLDL is secreted. Since
  the LDL-derived cholesterol bypasses SCAP (or other elements of the regulatory pool),
  we have termed this a shunt pathway. ABCA1/ABCG1 mediate cholesterol efflux to form
  HDL and reduce the cholesterol load in hepatocytes. Interestingly, cholesterol efflux
  and HDL biogenesis and then reuptake of HDL by SR-BI or P2Y13 may not represent
  a futile cycle if that cholesterol is redirected to bile acid secretion. All of
  these pathways represent channels with independent effectors mediating trafficking
  and regulation, with independent effects on intracellular cholesterol homeostasis.
