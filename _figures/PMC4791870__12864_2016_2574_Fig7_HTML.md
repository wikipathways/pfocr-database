caption: 'Analysis of pathways related to energy metabolism. The pathway map shows
  selected steps from KEGG pathways of the Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ko00010)
  and Citric acid cycle (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ko00020). Red indicates
  up-regulation and yellow, down-regulation in the treatment (W). Boxes with both
  red and yellow colours indicates cases were some unigenes coding for a particular
  enzyme were up-regulated while others were down-regulated in treatment (W). The
  enzymes are indicated with the EC numbers: EC:1.1.1.2, alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+);
  EC:1.1.1.37, malate dehydrogenase; EC:1.1.1.41, isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD+);
  EC:1.2.1.12, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EC:2.3.1.12, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  E2 component (dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase); EC:2.3.1.61, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
  E2 component (dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase); EC:2.3.3.1, citrate synthase;
  EC:2.7.1.40, pyruvate kinase; EC:2.7.2.3, phosphoglycerate kinase; EC:3.1.3.11,
  fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase I; EC:4.2.1.11, enolase; EC:4.1.2.13, fructose-bisphosphate
  aldolase, class I); EC:5.3.1.9, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; EC:5.4.2.11, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent
  phosphoglycerate mutase; EC:5.4.2.2, phosphoglucomutase; EC:6.2.1.1, acetyl-CoA
  synthetase'
