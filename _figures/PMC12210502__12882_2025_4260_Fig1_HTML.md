caption: 'Schematic diagram of the TSC1/2 signaling pathway (by Figdraw). TSC genes
  is localized in the cytoplasm and serves as a critical molecular hub that integrates
  the PI3K-Akt and mTOR signaling pathways. During cellular regulation, growth factors,
  such as insulin, activate PI3K, PI3K then phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3. PIP3 phosphorylates
  and activates Akt through the intermediary action of the kinase PDK1. PI3K activity
  is negatively modulated by PTEN, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates PIP3 to PIP2.
  Akt regulates the function of TSC by phosphorylating multiple sites on the TSC2
  subunit, thereby inhibiting its suppressive effect on mTORC1. Additionally, TSC
  negatively regulates mTORC1 by inhibiting Rheb, an activator of mTORC1. AMPK activates
  the TSC, thereby enhancing its inhibitory effect on mTOR. Upon binding to GTP, Rheb
  triggers mTORC1 activation, which initiates a series of phosphorylation reactions.
  This leads to p70S6K activation and 4EBP1 phosphorylation, promoting protein synthesis
  and cell proliferation. PI3K: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIP2: Phosphatidylinositol
  (4,5)-bisphosphate; PIP3: Phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate; PTEN: Phosphatase
  and tensin homolog; PDK1: Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1; Akt: Protein kinase B;
  Rheb: Ras homolog enriched in brain; GDP: Guanosine diphosphate; GTP: Guanosine
