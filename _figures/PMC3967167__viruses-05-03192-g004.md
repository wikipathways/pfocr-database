caption: As a key regulator of cellular survival the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is
  often triggered by viruses. Upon incoming survival signals, the Akt-mediated inhibitory
  phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic molecules such as BAD prevents the induction of
  the caspase cascade. In addition, the inhibitory phosphorylation of the transcription
  factor FOXO1 by Akt blocks its translocation into the nucleus and thus prevents
  the expression of pro-apoptotic genes. A variety of viral proteins steps into this
  regulatory network to assure cell survival, and thus maintaining the cellular environment
  for viral replication. Known viral proteins interacting with the cellular member
  of the signaling pathways are highlighted in red.
