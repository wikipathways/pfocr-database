caption: 'Redox Regulation by AMPK. A schematic diagram showing the redox regulation
  by AMPK signaling pathway. Major biological pathways are shown in the yellow boxes.
  Enzymes that promote antioxidant effects are labeled green, whereas enzymes that
  promote fatty acid synthesis are labeled red. Green arrows indicate the positive
  regulation. Red blunt ends indicate the negative regulation. Abbreviations used
  in the figure: C, cysteine oxidation; T, threonine phosphorylation; 2DG, 2-deoxyglucose;
  ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide;
  AMPK, 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase; CaMKKβ, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinase kinase β; GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; LKB1, liver
  kinase B1; NADP+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NADPH, reduced nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NRF2, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like
  2; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; SREBP, sterol regulatory element binding protein.'
