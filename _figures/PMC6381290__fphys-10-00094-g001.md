caption: Proposed mechanisms of obesity-induced BAT depletion. BAT mass and activity
  are minimized in obese patients due to reduced cell proliferation and preadipocyte
  differentiation and increased apoptosis. At least four obesity-related mechanisms
  can be involved. (1) Catecholamine resistance in obesity is characterized by decreased
  synthesis of norepinephrine and beta-adrenergic (β-AR) receptors and by defective
  intracellular signaling, which impedes PKA-mediated cell proliferation. (2) Obesity
  promotes the infiltration of M1 macrophages that participate in norepinephrine clearance
  and contribute to the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. NF-κB-mediated signaling
  inhibits the PKA proliferation pathway and represses PPARγ and C/EBPs gene expression,
  which inhibits differentiation and adipogenesis. In addition, TNF-α overexpression
  triggers cellular apoptosis. (3) The unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic
  reticulum plays a dual role in brown adipocyte differentiation according to the
  intensity of the signal. While activation of the three branches of UPR (IRE-1, ATF6,
  and PERK) is required for differentiation, excessive UPR activation (that can be
  found in severe obesity) triggers proapoptotic mechanisms. (4) In a similar manner,
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also hormetic regulators of cell differentiation
  and apoptosis. Physiological ROS concentrations promote C/EBP expression leading
  to differentiation, whereas supraphysiological concentration leads to oxidative
  stress and apoptosis via Wnt signaling. Artwork was obtained from Servier Medical
