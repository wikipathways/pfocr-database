caption: ALS is characterized by motor neuron dysfunctioning leading to hampered voluntary
  movement. The SOD1 protein mutations result into the accumulation of toxic protein
  aggregates, thereby inducing significant neurotoxicity. ALS pathology also involves
  downregulation of AMPK pathway that promotes neuroinflammation and subsequent motor
  neuron dysfunctioning. Upregulation of AMPK pathway through SIRT1 activation not
  only lowers the inflammatory response but also enhances mitochondrial biogenesis.
  Reduced toxic protein aggregates and increased energy balance in the neuronal circuit
  dilute the adverse effects of neurotoxic stimuli and therefore imparts significant
  protection against motor neuron damage.
