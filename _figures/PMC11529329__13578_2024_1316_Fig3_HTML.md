caption: RPs and proliferation of HCC. A. RPs influence cell cycle. (1) In HBV-induced
  HCC, RPS27A and RPS15A are upregulated by HBx and may influence the progression
  of HCC at G0/G1 phase. (2) RPL34 directly interacts with CDK4 while inhibiting CDK4/cyclin
  D1 activity and indirectly inhibits CDK5 by effectively inhibiting the activity
  of p35 which activates CDK5. B. RPs influence apoptosis. (1) RPL8 is regulated by
  USF1 and activate the mTORC1 signaling pathway. (2) RACK1 inhibits the production
  of ROS and protects HCC cells from TNF-α-induced cell death through its interaction
  and regulation with CBR1. (Created in BioRender. Su, Q. (2022) www.BioRender.com/p62r405)
