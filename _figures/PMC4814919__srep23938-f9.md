caption: Two kinases such as GSK-3 and CKII might be activated in response to physiological
  stimuli. The β-TrCP recognizing motif and its N-terminal adjacent region within
  CREB-H-ΔTC are phosphorylated. Phosphorylated CREB-H-ΔTC has low activity and is
  ultimately degraded through a β-TrCP-dependent pathway, leading to down regulation
  of the expression of CREB-H target genes.
