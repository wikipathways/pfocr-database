caption: Balancing DSB repair through multiple mechanisms throughout the cell cycle.
  (A) cNHEJ and alt-EJ can occur at any phase of the cell cycle while HR and SSA are
  restricted to the S and G2 phase. (B) cNHEJ is initiated with Ku70/80 heterodimer
  recognizing and protecting the broken DNA ends, then recruits additional proteins
  to trim the ends and ligate gaps. Without the protection from Ku70/80, broken ends
  are subjected to resection. When there are limited amounts of resection, mediated
  by PARP1, the alt-EJ pathway is taken, resulting in annealing at microhomologies
  which can potentially cause multiple indels. With extensive end resection, HR and
  SSAare initiated by the MRN complex to make single stranded regions that allow recruitment
  of DNA repair proteins to mediate strand invasion and annealing at long homologies,
  respectively. The SSA pathway results in large deletions. Created with Biorender.com.
