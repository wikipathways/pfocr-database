caption: ADA-308 disrupts androgen signaling by binding to the androgen receptor (AR),
  preventing natural androgens from binding. In normal processes, androgen binding
  initiates AR nuclear translocation and subsequent AR-mediated signaling. However,
  when ADA-308 occupies the androgen binding site, it inhibits AR activity, effectively
  blocking the signaling pathway activated by androgens. This mechanism showcases
  ADA-308’s potential therapeutic role in conditions driven by androgen excess. The
  graph in Fig. 2 illustrates these steps clearly, emphasizing the competitive nature
  of ADA-308 in relation to androgen binding and its impact on AR signaling
