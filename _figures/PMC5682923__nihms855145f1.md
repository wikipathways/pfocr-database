caption: (A) Simplified view of mTORC1 signaling. Multiple inputs converge upon mTORC1;
  amino acids and growth factor signaling are the best described and are depicted
  here. In the cytoplasm, the Sestrin and Castor proteins function as sensors for
  leucine and arginine. In response to direct amino acid binding, they release a break
  on the Gator2 and Gator1 complexes, which promote mTORC1 localization to the lysosome
  by allowing activation of the Rag-GTPases. This requires RagA/B conversion to the
  GTP bound form and RagC/D conversion to the GDP bound form respectively. Insulin
  and other growth factors activate mTORC1 through AKT, which phosphorylates the TSC
  GAP complex and thereby activates the Rheb GTPase. mTORC2 directly phosphorylates
  AKT and is required for full AKT activity; however, many studies indicate that mTORC2
  is not essential for mTORC1 activity. Therefore, we have illustrated the connection
  between mTORC2 and AKT with a grey arrow in this panel. The mTORC1 activator Rheb
  also resides at the lysosome. Thus, amino acid sufficiency enables growth factor-driven
  mTORC1 activation by putting mTORC1 in proximity to its activator. Mechanisms of
  amino acid sensing from within the lysosome through the Slc38A9 and v-ATPase have
  also been described. Once activated, mTORC1 phosphorylates many substrates involved
  in anabolic metabolism and cell growth. Some mTORC1 targets such as S6K and GRB10
  can feedback and inhibit insulin signaling.(B) Simplified view of mTORC2 signaling,
  which is less well understood. mTORC2 directly phosphorylates AKT at S473 in a C-terminal
  hydrophobic motif, which along with T308 phosphorylation by PDK1 in the kinase domain,
  is required for full AKT activity. These phosphosite locations correspond to AKT1;
  however, AKT exists in three isoforms (AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3) each containing structurally
  identical phosphorylation sites that are all thought to be regulated similarly by
  mTORC2. The classic model is that AKT is activated at the plasma membrane and this
  is facilitated by PI3K-generated PI(3,4,5)P3, which recruits PDK1 and AKT to the
  membrane through their PH domains. Traditionally, S473 phosphorylation was thought
  to be essential for subsequent T308 phosphorylation, which is critical for AKT kinase
  activity. However, genetic studies showed that a certain level of T308 phosphorylation
  can occur independently of S473 and that this is sufficient for AKT activity towards
  many downstream substrates including the TSC-Rheb-mTORC1 pathway. Thus, the essential
  role of AKT-S473 phosphorylation remains unclear. mTORC2 can also phosphorylate
  the SGK and PCKα kinases, which like AKT belong to the AGC kinase family. Unlike
  the case for AKT, mTORC2 is thought to be essential for all PKCα and SGK activity.
  It is unclear whether there are additional direct mTORC2 substrates though this
  has been speculated. Many upstream inputs to mTORC2 and potential intracellular
  sites of localization of mTORC2 have been described although a unifying mechanism
  of activation remains elusive. (C) Recent studies suggest that catecholamines might
  also stimulate mTORC1 through PKA signaling, and that this is important form promoting
  the browning of white adipose tissue.
