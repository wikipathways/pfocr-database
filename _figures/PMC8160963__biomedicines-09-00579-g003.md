caption: Signaling pathway activated downstream of the TGFBR in CRC. Upon binding
  the TGFB1 dimer, TGF-beta receptor type-2 (TGFBR2) promotes its dimerization with
  TGFBR1, resulting in transphosphorylation of TGFBR1. Activated TGFBR1 phosphorylates
  and activates receptor-regulated SMADs R-SMADs, SMAD2 and SMAD3, thus promoting
  the trimerization with a co-SMAD (SMAD4). SMAD7 is an inhibitory SMAD (I-SMAD) that
  can bind to TGFBR1 competing with SMAD2/3 for the catalytic site of phosphorylation,
  thus preventing the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3. In addition, SMAD7 can promote dephosphorylation/inactivation
  of TGFBR1 or boost ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of TGFBR1.
  Activated SMAD complex enters the nucleus, where it binds DNA directly or indirectly,
  via other transcription factors, and regulates gene expression, both positively
  and negatively. SMAD4 inactivation has been reported to correlate with CRC tumor
  progression, development and distant metastasis. Moreover, its reduced expression
  or loss was associated with poor survival and prognosis in patients with CRC. In
  addition, loss of SMAD4 in CRC patients conferred resistance to chemotherapy drugs,
  such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) []. Loss-of-function mutations have been found in
  approximately 10–35% of patients with CRC []. Moreover, some studies reported absent,
  or reduced SMAD4 expression in 66% of CRC samples from patients analyzed [,,,,,,].
