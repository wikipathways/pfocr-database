caption: RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway in fatty acids‐modulated bone metabolism. The well‐documented
  RANKL signalling pathway exerts essential role in osteoclastogenesis. RANKL binds
  to RANK on the surface of osteoclast precursor cells and activates three distinct
  downstream signalling pathways. The MAPK pathways characterized by downstream factors
  ERK, p38 and JNK play pivotal role in cell death and survival. The NF‐κB signalling
  pathway is activated following IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. The p50 and
  p65 subunits of NF‐κB are released and translocated into the nucleus to activate
  the transcription of target genes. The PI3K/mTOR pathway is also activated upon
  binding of RANKL to RANK, which triggers the activation of PDK1s and Akt leading
  to the inhibition of the TSC complex and subsequent mTORC1 formation. The mTORC1
  phosphorylates S6K1 as well as 4E‐BP1, which further regulate protein synthesis,
  cell proliferation, angiogenesis and autophagy. However, mTORC2 acts as an essential
  modulator of actin cytoskeleton, cell survival and lipid metabolism. RANKL, receptor
  activator of nuclear kappa‐β ligand; TGF‐β, transforming growth factor β; JNK, c‐jun
  NH2‐terminal kinase; Akt, protein kinase B; S6Ks, S6 kinases; 4E‐BP1, 4E‐binding

  description: RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway in fatty acids‐modulated bone metabolism. The
    well‐documented RANKL signalling pathway exerts essential role in osteoclastogenesis.
    RANKL binds to RANK on the surface of osteoclast precursor cells and activates
    three distinct downstream signalling pathways. The MAPK pathways characterized
    by downstream factors ERK, p38 and JNK play pivotal role in cell death and survival.
    The NF‐κB signalling pathway is activated following IκBα phosphorylation and degradation.
    The p50 and p65 subunits of NF‐κB are released and translocated into the nucleus
    to activate the transcription of target genes. The PI3K/mTOR pathway is also activated
    upon binding of RANKL to RANK, which triggers the activation of PDK1s and Akt
    leading to the inhibition of the TSC complex and subsequent mTORC1 formation.
    The mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K1 as well as 4E‐BP1, which further regulate protein
    synthesis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis and autophagy. However, mTORC2 acts
    as an essential modulator of actin cytoskeleton, cell survival and lipid metabolism.
