caption: cGAS-STING pathway plays a significant role in mediating cardiovascular disease.
  High-fat diet (HFD) or palmitic acid (PA) exposure increases mitochondrial stress
  and lowers mitochondrial ALDH2 activity due to reduced melatonin levels, leading
  to impaired mitochondrial function and the release of mtDNA. Additionally, LPS activates
  caspase-11, which triggers GSDMD activation, further contributing to mtDNA release
  from damaged mitochondria. This mtDNA subsequently activates the STING-IRF3 pathway,
  which promotes macrophage infiltration and the development of cardiac fibrosis.
  DNA fragmentation in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) facilitates the transfer of DNA
  to macrophages, stimulating MMP-9 expression and contributing to extracellular matrix
  formation. Once activated, IRF3 translocates to the nucleus and induces MST1 expression,
  promoting YAP phosphorylation and suppressing cyclin D transcription, thereby inhibiting
  endothelial cell angiogenesis. Moreover, it upregulates ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression,
  enhancing inflammation and promoting SMC proliferation, contributing to proatherogenic
  effects
