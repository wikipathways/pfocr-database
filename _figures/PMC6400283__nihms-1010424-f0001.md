caption: Binding of bacterial cell wall component MDP to the LRR of NOD2 triggers
  NOD2 oligomerization and recruitment of RIP2 via CARD-CARD homotypic interaction.
  RIP2 KD then dimerizes and associates with the BIR2 domain of the ubiquitin ligase
  XIAP, causing K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP2, downstream activation of MAPKs
  and NF-κB, and production of proinflammatory cytokines. XIAP BIR2-selective antagonists
  and some RIP2 kinase inhibitors disrupt RIP2-XIAP association to restrain NOD2 signal
  transduction. Specific domains of the proteins are labeled below the pathway.
