caption: cGMP compartmentation in ECs. These cells also contain pGC and a sGC-associated
  cGMP pools. Both PDE2 and PDE3 are known to be involved in their regulation. The
  effect of cGMP signaling pathway is highly dependent on intracellular cGMP concentrations.
  sGC, PKG and PKA can be also localized to endothelial caveolae to regulate endothelial
  barrier function. Black arrows indicate enzymatic activity.
