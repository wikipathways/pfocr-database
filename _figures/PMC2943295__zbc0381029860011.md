caption: Visualization of the pyruvate metabolism before and during H2 production.
  Green color represents metabolites/pathways present during the aerobic state; red
  color represents metabolites/pathways present during the anaerobic state, yellow
  color represents pathways occurring in both states. Blue arrows symbolize acetate
  uptake and feeding. AAT, alanine aminotransferase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
  AcDH, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase; ACK, acetate kinase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase;
  DXS, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase; GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; Fd,
  ferredoxin; HYDA1 and HYDA2, hydrogenases; NDH, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase; PDC, pyruvate
  decarboxylase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PFL, pyruvate formate lyase;
  PFR, pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; PQ, plastochinon
  pool; and TCA cycle, citric acid cycle.
