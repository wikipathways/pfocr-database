caption: Summary of key components contributing to RS formation in rice. Genes identified
  either in genome‐wide association studies or targeted association studies were highlighted
  in the pathway overview, its loci coloured in red. The central hubs identified from
  gene regulatory networks from differentially expressed genes (loci) were coloured
  in green. The central hub metabolites and DF components found in medium resistant
  starch and low resistant starch were highlighted as circles and square, respectively.
