caption: Schematic diagram showing the hypothesis for novel biological and physiological
  roles of intracellular Ang II system in the mitochondria of the proximal tubules
  in the regulation of proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption and blood pressure homeostasis.
  In addition to local onsite generation, extracellular (endocrine and paracrine)
  Ang II is taken up by the proximal tubule cells via the AT1 (AT1a) receptor-mediated
  mechanism. Some internalized Ang II/AT1 receptor complexes bypass the lysosomal
  degradation pathway and be transported to other intracellular organelles, including
  the mitochondria and the nucleus, where Ang II activates AT1 and/or AT2 receptors
  in the mitochondria to alter mitochondrial oxidative and glycolysis stress responses.
  This may in turn alter the expression or activity of NHE3 on the apical membranes
  or Na+/K+-ATPase on the basolateral membranes in the proximal tubules. Thus, activation
  of the mito-Ang II/AT1/signaling will stimulate proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption
  and elevate blood pressure. Conversely, activation of the mito-Ang II/AT2/NO/cGMP
  signaling by overexpressing AT2 receptors selectively in the mitochondria will likely
  inhibit proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption, induce natriuretic response, and lower
  the blood pressure. Reproduced with permission ().
