caption: (A) “mirDIP” based computational analysis of tested miRs (miR144/153/27a/142-5p)
  and identification of number of genes that could be potentially targeted at the
  intersection of the 4 miRs. mirDIP generated list was used as an input file and
  a network was generated using another bioinformatic program, “Cytoscape_v2.8.2″.
  NFE2L2, which is at the intersection of 4 miRs is represented by a bold colored
  lines. While all the other target genes which are at the intersection of 4 miRs
  are represented by independent colored lines (miR144-brown; miR153-red; miR27a-black;
  miR142-5p-purple). (B) KEGG pathway mapping identified Prion disease as the predominant
  pathway at the intersection of miR144, miR153, miR27a, miR142-5p involving NFE2L2,
  one of the genes that is predicted to be regulated with a high –ln(p-value) of 20.79
  by “DIANA-mirPath”. (C) Using the concept of network biology, we constructed miRNA-associated
  disease network (MDN) to visualize the relationship of miRs of our interest with
  multiple pathologic/pathogenic conditions. The network was generated by compiling
  the data manually from Pubmed (till 05/07/2012) along with the information from
  two other databases, Human miRNA Disease Database (HMDD - http://202.38.126.151/hmdd/mirna/md/)
  and miR2Disease (http://www.mir2disease.org/). This compiled data was used in “Cytoscape_v2.8.2″
  to establish connections between miRs and associated diseases. Different diseases
  associated with indicated miRs are represented as light green colored nodes. Diseases
  associated with individual miRs are connected by specific colored edges (lines)
  and any two different miRs that share one common disease are connected by red colored
  edge. Neuro specific pathologies are represented in red font.
