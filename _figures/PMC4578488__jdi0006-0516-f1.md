caption: Model of metformin action in the hepatocyte and cancer cells. Metformin inhibits
  mitochondrial complex I, blocks adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and results
  in an accumulation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which in turn activates the
  glycolytic pathway. Accumulation of AMP activates AMP kinase (AMPK), which contributes
  to the improved insulin sensitivity. Besides, metformin suppresses mitochondrial
  glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mitoGPD), which catalyzes the oxidation of glycerol-3-phosphate
  to dihydroxyacetone phosphate in hepatic cells, alters the mitochondrial and cytosolic
  redox state, and reduces reactive oxygen species production, mechanisms linked to
  inhibiting gluconeogenesis. Cancer cells produce most ATP through the oxidative
  phosphorylation system (OXPHOS), but some ATP is generated through glycolysis. Cancer
  cells with deficiencies in glucose utilization or complex I are sensitive to metformin,
  but cancer cells without those deficiencies are not, in which the combination with
  glycolysis inhibitors is effective in inhibiting cancer cell growth. ADP, adenosine
  diphosphate; LDHA, lactic dehydrogenase; NAD, nicotinamide adenine; NADH, nicotinamide
  adenine dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PKA, cyclic AMP-dependent protein
  kinase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
