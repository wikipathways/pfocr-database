caption: Notch signaling is one of the critical pathological pathways implicated in
  TNBCs. This pathway regulates the expression of target genes such as HES1, HEY2,
  MYC, CCND1, HES4, NRAR, etc., and involved in BCSCs proliferation, differentiation,
  and apoptosis., Notch signaling is activated by the binding of transmembrane ligands
  [Delta-like (DLL) 1, 4, and Jagged (JAG) 1, 2] to the Notch receptors present on
  the cell surface. This binding results in the proteolytic invasion of Notch by a
  presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase complex to release of NICD, which later translocates
  to the nucleus and heterodimerizes with a transcription factor, CSL (suppressor
  of hairless), and activates various target genes ().- Several studies conclude that
  Notch signaling pathway activation in BCSCs predominantly activates the expression
  of HES1 and HEY2 genes, which participates in the perpetuation of self-renewal of
  BCSCs.- Notch signaling also reported to regulate cyclinD1, c-Myc, p21, Survivin,
  Slug, CCNA, CCNB, CCNDI, HER2 expression, and stimulate the nuclear factor-kappa
  B (NF-κB) pathway., The Notch-mediated activation of all these factors promotes
  cell proliferation, angiogenesis, resistance to apoptosis, and self-renewal of BCSCs.
