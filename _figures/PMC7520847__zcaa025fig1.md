caption: 'The RAS signaling pathway. This figure and Figures  present simplified versions
  of complex pathways. There are multiple additional connections within each pathway
  that are not depicted as well as interconnections between pathways. RAS signaling
  in cancer has two major aspects: the MAP kinase pathway and the PI3K pathway. These
  regulate cell cycle control, apoptosis, cell metabolism and protein synthesis. Green
  arrows indicate activation, while red lines indicate inhibition. Abbreviations:
  RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; Grb2, growth factor receptor-bound protein, an adaptor
  protein; SOS, Son of Sevenless, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RAS; RAS,
  a small GTPase; Raf, a serine–threonine kinase; Mek, Map kinase/Erk kinase, a dual-specificity
  kinase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, a serine–threonine kinase; PTEN,
  phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10, a lipid phosphatase; PIP2,
  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate;
  PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, a serine–threonine kinase activated
  by PIP3; AKT, a serine–threonine kinase; TSC1,2, tuberous sclerosis proteins, GTPase-activating
  proteins for Rheb; Rheb, RAS homolog enriched in brain, a small GTPase; mTORC1,
  mechanistic target of rapamycin, a multiprotein complex regulating metabolism; FOXO,
  forkhead box O, transcription factors involved in control of apoptosis.'
