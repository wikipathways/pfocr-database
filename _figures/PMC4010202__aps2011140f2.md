caption: 'An overview of the proposed signaling mechanisms underlying the protective
  effects of mood stabilizing drugs against experimental stroke. Lithium, VPA and
  lamotrigine inhibit glutamate excitotoxicity-induced neuronal apoptosis by different
  mechanisms. Lithium inhibits stroke-induced NMDA receptor overactivation by decreasing
  NR2 subunit tyrosine phosphorylation. This suppresses excitotoxicity-induced activation
  of either calpain or p38, JNK and subsequently AP-1 to block neuronal apoptosis.
  VPA suppresses glutamate excitotoxicity via regulation of gene expression, among
  other mechanisms. As a VGSC blocker, lamotrigine attenuates stroke-induced VGSC
  malfunction, prevents extracellular glutamate overflow, and consequently mitigates
  excitotoxicity and apoptosis. Lithium and VPA inhibit GSK-3 and HDACs, respectively,
  to transcriptionally regulate various downstream neuroprotective and neurotrophic
  factors, as well as to enhance mesenchymal stem cell migration. Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic
  factor, is upregulated by lithium and VPA under experimental stroke conditions.
  Expression of the neuroprotective molecule HSP70 is enhanced by lithium and VPA
  through HSF-1 and Sp1 activation, respectively. HSP70 is also proposed to exert
  anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-κB activity. VPA attenuates BBB disruption
  by downregulating MMP-9 via NF-κB inhibition and preventing tight junction protein
  degradation shortly after ischemia. Long-term VPA treatment potentiates post-ischemic
  angiogenesis through upregulating VEGF and MMP-9 expression. Lithium also enhances
  VEGF and MMP-9 expression following long-term treatment. BDNF is activated by lithium
  and VPA, and the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway is essential for enhancing post-ischemic
  neurogenesis and functional recovery. HAT: histone acetyltransferase; TJ: tight
  junctions; lines with solid arrows represent stimulatory effects; lines with flattened
  ends represent inhibitory effects; A: acetylated Lys residues of histone-tail proteins.'
