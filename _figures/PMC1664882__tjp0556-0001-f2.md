caption: Though represented separately for clarity, it is likely that both anion secretion
  mechanisms exist in the same cell. See text for details. A, Cl− secretion. Cl− enters
  across the basolateral membrane by NKCC (1) and exits across the apical membrane
  through CFTR and possibly alternative anion channels (2). While NKCC is the major
  entry route for Cl−, AE2 (3) could theoretically support Cl− entry across the basolateral
  membrane if the electrochemical driving forces are appropriate. Na+,K+-ATPase (4)
  is localized to the basolateral membrane. Agonist stimulation is likely to result
  in activation of apical membrane anion channel(s) (2) and a population of K+ channels
  on the basolateral membrane (5). B, HCO3− secretion. HCO3− is either transported
  across the basolateral membrane through electrogenic NBC (6) or AE2 (3), or it is
  generated intracellularly through the actions of carbonic anhydrase (CA). Intracellular
  generation of HCO3− also produces H+, which is removed from the cell interior by
  NHE (7). HCO3− then exits across the apical membrane through the anion channels
  (2). Agonist stimulation similarly controls secretion by activating apical membrane
  anion channels (2) and basolateral membrane K+ channels (5). Transepithelial secretion
  of either anion establishes a voltage gradient for cations, principally Na+, to
  follow through the paracellular pathway. H2O flows across the barrier, either paracellularly
  (as shown) or transcellularly, in response to the resultant osmotic gradient.
