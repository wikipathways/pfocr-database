caption: Interaction between sAPL-1 and DAF-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor and DAF-12/NHR
  pathways. Schematic representation of APL-1 proteolytic pathway and how sAPL-1 may
  modulate DAF-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor and DAF-12/NHR signaling pathways. APL-1 is
  cleaved by the α/γ-secretase pathway in C. elegans. Released sAPL-1 could act as
  a signaling molecule in the same cell (autocrine regulation) or in neighboring cells
  (paracrine regulation) to inhibit daf-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor and daf-12/NHR pathways
  to affect worm viability and development. The exact mechanism by which sAPL-1inhibits
  daf-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor and daf-12/NHR is still unknown and labeled as a question
  mark (see ).
