caption: 'The effects of BDNF and NGF on the cell signaling processes that potentially
  lead to cellular effects with the end results of neuroregeneration or neurorepair.
  BDNF binds to a homodimeric form of TrkB receptor, and NGF binds to a homodimeric
  form of TrkA receptors on the cell surface. Upon binding of BDNF and NGF to TrkB
  and TrkA, respectively, they stimulate SHC pathway activation to activate PIK3,
  followed by activation of PDK1 and Akt signaling pathways to generate axonal growth
  and cell survival. The second SHC pathway is via MEK that activates ERK and MAPK,
  followed by activation CREB to generate cell differentiation, proliferation, survival,
  and BDNF promotor transcription. BDNF activates the PLC pathway, followed by activation
  of IP3 and CAMK signals for generating synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission.
  The PLC pathway also activates DAG and PKC signals for cell survival and synaptic
  plasticity. Abbreviations: NGF, nerve growth factor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor; TrkA, tropomyosin related kinase A; TrkB, tropomyosin-related kinase B;
