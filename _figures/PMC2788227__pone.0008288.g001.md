caption: A) The MVA Pathway. The first two enzymes of the MVA pathway condense 3 molecules
  of acetyl-CoA (1) to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) (3), which is
  subsequently reduced to MVA (4) by HMG-CoA reductase , . MVA is phosphorylated twice
  then decarboxylated to yield IPP (7) –, which is converted to DMAPP (8) by an isomerase
  . B) The MEP Pathway. Condensation of pyruvate (9) with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  (10) yields 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP; (11)) , an intermediate with a
  role in E. coli vitamin B1 and B6 biosynthesis – and isoprene biosynthesis. 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose
  5-phosphate reductoisomerase (also called MEP synthase or IspC) catalyzes the reduction
  and rearrangement of 11 to yield MEP (12) , the first committed step in the E. coli
  MEP pathway. The next enzyme, CDP-ME synthase, converts MEP into 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  (CDP-ME; (13)). CDP-ME kinase then phosphorylates CDP-ME, which is subsequently
  cyclized (coupled with the loss of CMP) by cMEPP synthase to yield 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate (15) –. A reductive ring opening of 15 produces 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl
  diphosphate (HMBPP; (16)) , –, which is subsequently reduced to both IPP and DMAP
  in a ∼5:1 ratio , –. C) The reaction catalyzed by MEP synthase. Isomerization via
  cleavage of the bond between C3 and C4 and formation of a new bond between C2 and
  C4 produces the intermediate 2-C-methyl-D-erythrose 4-phosphate (18) , , which is
  subsequently reduced to yield MEP (12).
