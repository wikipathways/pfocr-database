caption: 'Synapse dysfunction: as a consequence of MAPK and mitochondrial oxidative
  stress-mediated tau hyperphosphorylation. β-Amyloid activates several stress-related
  kinases that causes oxidative stress. The phosphorylation/activation of ERK1/2 and
  MEK1/2 via MAPK results in apoptosis. Consequently, abnormal hyperphosphorylation
  of tau leads to synapse dysfunction. Aβ also results in mitochondrial dysfunction
  by affecting the prosurvival protein Bcl-2. The mitochondrial-mediated caspase pathway
  gets triggered by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, then cytochrome c release, and finally,
  apoptosis. This ultimately leads to synapse dysfunction'
