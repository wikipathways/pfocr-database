caption: NFκB pathway in pancreatic acinar cells. The early activation of NFκB follows
  the same time pattern as trypsinogen activation. Both are induced by cytoplasmatic
  Ca2+ influx, but NFκB did not depend on trypsinogen activation. The phosphorylation
  of IκBα, followed by proteasomal degradation and the nuclear translocation of NFκB
  (p65/p50) occurs in parallel to protease activation. NFκB as transcription factor
  acts in two directions; first the transcriptions of pro-inflammatory genes like
  IL6 or TNFα to initiate the immune response and second the transcription of pro-survival
  genes. Therefore NFκB can directly influence protease activity to protect cells
  by the up-regulation of Spi2A, a serine protease inhibitor.
