caption: 'Direct mechanisms include (i) production of active compounds, (ii) detoxification,
  and (iii) direct binding to bacterial cells. Indirect mechanisms involve microbial
  manipulation of host physiology. (iv) Microbial participation in enterohepatic cycling:
  () compounds are inactivated by conjugation in the liver; () the conjugated compound
  passes into bile and is excreted into the intestinal lumen; () microbial enzymes
  release the conjugate group, reactivating the compound; and () the active compound
  reenters circulation. (v) Altered expression of host genes involved in xenobiotic
  metabolism. (vi) Altered kinetics due to microbial metabolites competing with xenobiotics
  for enzyme binding sites. (vii) Microbial production of metabolic pathway intermediates.
  (viii) Stimulation of immune responses through translocation or inflammation.'
