caption: Possible mechanism of galectin-1 in lymphoma. The combination of AP-1 on
  the surface of R-S cells and galectin-1 promotes the expression of galectin-1, the
  combination of overexpressed galectin-1 and CD30 stimulates tumor necrosis factor–associated
  factor and activates the NF-κB signaling pathway to produce poor clinical outcomes.
  The combination of galectin-1 and CD7 induces apoptosis of immature thymocytes,
  the combination of NF-κB and Sp1 promotes the expression of CD7, while the combination
  of E12 and Twist2 with NF-κB inhibits the expression of CD7. Since the p38 MAPK-MSK1
  pathway regulates CD7 expression by activating NF-κB, inhibitors of the p38 MAPK
  and MSK1 pathways can directly reduce CD7 expression. In addition, EBV-specific
  T cells binding to galectin-1 may inhibit immune attack.
