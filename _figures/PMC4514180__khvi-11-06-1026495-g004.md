caption: 'Signal transduction pathways drive cancer metastasis. The signaling pathways
  of HER family members, VEGF and IGF-1R and the current drugs that target these oncoproteins
  in cancer are shown. HER-2 can heterodimerize with any of the ligand-activated HER
  receptors (HER-1, HER-3 or HER-4) and this association leads to intracellular signaling
  via 2 major pathways, the MAPK pathway and the PI3K pathway, leading to proliferation,
  cell survival, metastasis and angiogenesis. On the other hand, VEGF can bind to
  its main receptor, VEGFR-2 (KDR), and this binding causes intracellular phosphorylation
  of the receptor, thereby stimulating the PI3K pathway and stimulating angiogenesis.
  The signaling pathways can be targeted extracellularly using humanized monoclonal
  antibodies, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab (HER-2), cetuximab (EGF receptor),
  bevacizumab (Avastin) (VEGF), and cixutumumab (IGF-1R) which can prevent ligand
  binding and activation of the receptors or can directly block binding of an activated
  receptor to another. At the intracellular level, small-molecule inhibitors, such
  as sunitinib (VEGF), lapatinib (HER-1 and HER-2) and erlotinib (HER-2), can disrupt
  the phosphorylation sites and directly prevent activation of the PI3K or MAPK pathways.
