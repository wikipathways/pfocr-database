caption: Comparative analysis of transcriptome between yellow and white mushrooms.
  (a) BLAST software was utilized to compare the Unigene sequence with NR, Swiss-Prot,
  GO, COG, KOG, and KEGG databases. (b) Differentially expressed genes between yellow
  and white mushrooms, where red represents the number of genes upregulated in white
  mushroom. (c) Simulation diagram of riboflavin metabolic pathway and riboflavin
  transport in cells. Arrows represent the direction of the composite, “+” represents
  that PUT3 positively regulates FlMCH5, and “–” represents that PUT3 negatively regulates
  PUT2.
