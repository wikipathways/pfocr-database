caption: 'Mitochondria in RA macrophages. Synovial tissue Mφ (STM) are a highly heterogeneous
  population in terms of mitochondrial activity, metabolic networks, and functional
  commitment. MERTKhi pro-resolving STM are committed to highly active oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS), based on the elevated expression of mitochondria-encoded ETC subunit genes.
  Conversely, pro-inflammatory STM, which mostly lack MERTK, upregulate glucose and
  lactate transporters and rely more on glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway
  for energy supply. Pro-inflammatory Mφ upregulate the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate
  kinase M2 (PKM2) to feed pyruvate into the mitochondria, generate ample ATP as well
  as ROS. PKM2 is sensitive to ROS-imposed structural changes and transitions into
  the nucleus to function as a driver of pro-inflammatory cytokines and tissue-injurious
  enzymes. Hyperactive mitochondria form membrane interaction sites with the ER, so-called
  MAMs, that support calcium exchange, sustaining high metabolic and functional activity
  of RA Mφ. Mφ that are functionally active in the synovial tissue environment need
  to be able to adapt to the harsh conditions of the tissue niche: a hypoxic, glucose
  deplete microenvironment. RA Mφ adjust to the bioenergetic conditions in synovial
  tissue by upregulating the transcription factor RFX5. RFX5 target genes include
  the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1), which allows the cells to metabolize
  glutamate into alpha-ketoglutarate and fuel the TCA cycle. In parallel, RFX5 controls
  the density of HLA-DR molecules on the cell surface, guiding the cells’ antigen-presenting
  function. RFX5 is induced by the small cytokine CCL18 and functions as a potent
  coordinator of antigen-presenting capabilities and successful survival in a glucose
  deplete environment'
