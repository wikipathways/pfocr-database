caption: 'In females, loss of Gαi3 leads presumably via desinhibition of adenylyl
  cyclase and hence increased pSer133-CREB levels to a phase-advanced and increased
  expression of DBP in the liver, concomitant with an increase in transcript levels
  of Cyp3a11, a putative DBP target gene. In Gαi3-/- males, this signalling pathway
  may be less active provided that an increased CRY1 expression (as indicated in Figure
  ) results in a stronger inhibitory role of CRY1 on cAMP levels (via Gs inhibition)
  []. B: BMAL1; C: CLOCK; CRE: cAMP responsive element; CREB, cAMP response element
  binding protein; CRY1, cryptochrome circadian clock 1; Cyp3a11: cytochrome P450,
  family 3, subfamily a, polypeptide 11; DBP: albumin D-box binding protein; PKA:
  protein kinase A; Gi3 and Gs: heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins
  which upon activation cause a decrease or increase in intracellular cAMP levels,
  respectively.'
