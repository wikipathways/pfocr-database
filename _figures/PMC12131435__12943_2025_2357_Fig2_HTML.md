caption: 'The process of normal fibroblasts transforming into CAFs can be described
  as follows: a Growth Factor and cytokine stimulation. Growth factors and cytokines—including
  transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), osteopontin (OPN), and IL-1β—bind to
  their receptors on NFs. This binding trigger downstream effectors such as microRNAs
  (miRNAs) and CD44, which then regulate CAF-specific gene expression via the TGF-β/Smads
  and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathways.
  b Exosome-Mediated Transformation: Exosomes released by cancer cells, carrying cargos
  like miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), convert NFs into CAFs. They do so
  by activating several signaling cascades, including TGF-β/Smads, Janus kinase/signal
  transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT), NF-κB, and mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. c Metabolic Reprogramming: The conversion is also
  driven by a reprogramming of glucose metabolism. The hypoxia-inducible factor-1α
  (HIF-1α) signaling pathway promotes glycolysis during this transformation. d Homeostasis
  disruption: Shifts in cellular homeostasis trigger a self-sustaining conversion
  by modulating the activation of cytoskeletal proteins and altering the cell’s secretory
  phenotype through the JAK/STAT and p53 pathways. Additional regulatory elements
  in this conversion process include factors such as Fli-1 leukemia integration 1,
  transcription factor 12 (TCF12), suppressor of cytokine signaling (1SOCS1), β−1,4-galactosyltransferases
  III (B4GALT3), insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R), lysophosphatidic acid
  (LPA), voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1),
  TEA domain transcription factor-1 (TEAD1), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1),
  epiregulin (EREG), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The figure is created with
