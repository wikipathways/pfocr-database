caption: '(A) Injury first causes release of calcium (Ca2+) via 1) membrane release
  (orange), 2) voltage-gated calcium channel opening (EGL-19 (VGCC a1)) causing a
  bidirectional membrane propagation (orange arrow) of Ca2+ (blue), 3) Activation
  of Ca2+-dependent Ca2+ release from internal storages leading to transient Ca2+
  waves (blue). Ca2+ dependent activation of cAMP and DLK-1 regeneration-dependent
  pathway lead to three key steps of axon regeneration: 1) growth cone formation,
  2) axon extension and guidance and 3) fusion to target when it occurs. (B) Growth
  cone formation: Increased calcium levels activate 1) production of cAMP and activation
  of the PKA pathway, 2) the DLK-1 pathway which is also activated by microtubule
  (MT) disruption after injury. MT-associated proteins, such as the N-terminal EFA-6
  factor, polymerisation and depolymerisation factors such as the depolymerizing kinesin-13
  family member KLP-7 factor, act downstream DLK-1 whereas the tubulin posttranslational
  modifiers Patronin PTRN- acts in parallel. The Notch/lin-12 signalling prevents
  growth cone formation in a cellular-autonomous and DLK-1 independent manner ().
  Ca2+-dependent activation of apoptotic factors CED3 and CED4 allows maintenance
  of the distal fragment, via DLK-1 (). (C) Injury triggers relocalisation of key
  proteins from soma to injured membranes for axon fusion. After injury, 1) u61569
  PSR-1 relocalises from mitochondria and nuclei to axon tip (yellow dotted arrow)
  and axotomy-triggered flipping of the phosphatidylserine lipid (PS) (blue square).
  TTR-52 (red circle) relocates from PLM axonal soma to both the distal and proximal
  membrane (red dotted arrow) and could bind exposed PS for fusion. u61570 epithelial
  fusion failure-1 EFF-1 (green) relocalises from soma to distal tip of the severed
  membranes (green doted arrow) after injury. PSR-1/PS binding and relocalisation
  of the secreted PS binding protein TTR-52/transthyretin allowed the recruitment
  of u61571 apoptotic clearance molecules (NRF-5, CED-7, or CED-6) which are required
  upstream of EFF-1 for 2) the EFF-1 dependent fusion process of both axonal ends.'
