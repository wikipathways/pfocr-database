caption: Molecular composition, biogenesis, secretion, and uptake of the exosomes.
  a) Exosomes contain complex contents including proteins, mRNA, miRNA, ncRNA, and
  DNA. TSG101 and Alix are involved in the formation of internal vesicles of MVBs.
  The tetraspanins such as CD9, CD63, and CD81, are the markers currently used to
  characterize exosomes. b) Exosomes originate from ILVs in MVBs. Firstly, proteins
  are transported from the Golgi or internalized from the cell surface, and nucleic
  acids should be endocytosed and transferred into the early endosomes. Then early
  endosomes maturate into late endosomes/MVB, which follow either the secretory or
  the degradative pathway. Microvesicles are released after formation by budding from
  the cytomembrane. Once released, exosomes can interact with recipient cells by direct
  signaling through ligand/receptor molecules on their respective surfaces. Exosomes
  can also be taken up by recipient cells via different manners such as direct fusion
  of their membrane, endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and even phagocytosis (right).
  Thus, exosomes function as a mode of intercellular communication and molecular transfer.
