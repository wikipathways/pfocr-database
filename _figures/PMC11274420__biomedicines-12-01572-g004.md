caption: Mechanism of cardiorenal benefits of vericiguat. Vericiguat is the first
  sGC agonist that can directly stimulate sGC or synergize with endogenous NO to jointly
  increase intracellular levels of cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.
  By repairing damage to NO-sGC-cGMP, a cellular signaling pathway, the three major
  target organs, heart, blood vessels, and kidneys, are benefited. By Figdraw. SCG,
  soluble guanylate cyclase; NO, nitric oxide; cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate;
  GTP, guanosine triphosphate
