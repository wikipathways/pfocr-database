caption: CSF arrest is the result of a tight balance between PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56.
  Emi2 binds and inhibits the APC, the ubiquitin ligase of cyclin B. The inhibitory
  activity of Emi2 depends on the multiple phosphorylations of this protein by different
  kinases such as Plx1, cyclin B/Cdk1, CK1, and Rsk. Cyclin B-Cdk1, Plx1, and CK1
  prevent Emi2 from binding the APC, whereas phosphorylation of Emi2 by Rsk stimulates
  the APC-inhibitory activity of this protein by recruiting PP2A-B56, the phosphatase
  responsible for the dephosphorylation of the cyclin B-Cdk1, Plx1, and Ck1 sites.
  In this way Rsk maintains cyclin B-Cdk1 activity and prevents reactivation of PP2A-B55,
  the phosphatase involved in substrate dephosphorylation at meiotic and mitotic exit.
  Dotted lines represent inactive pathways during CSF arrest. ZBR = zinc-binding region.
