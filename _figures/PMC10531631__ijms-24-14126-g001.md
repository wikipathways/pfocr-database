caption: 'Schematic presentation of the associations between oxidative stress (OS)
  and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). (A). Mitochondria are the energy-producing
  structures in cells. The close proximity of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the source
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the limited protective mechanisms
  in mitochondria contribute to its susceptibility to oxidative damage and can result
  in various types of mutations. (B). Ovulation is a crucial event in the menstrual
  cycle, where a mature egg is released from the ovary, ready for potential fertilization.
  In small amounts, ROS are essential for normal physiological processes; however,
  excessive production of ROS, meaning oxidative stress (OS), can be harmful to cells
  and tissues. The reduction in the rate of ovulation and prevention of cumulus expansion
  observed after antioxidant administration might be due to the antioxidants’ neutralizing
  effects on ROS and disruption of the delicate balance required for successful ovulation
  and cumulus expansion. The citric acid (TCA) cycle is a fundamental metabolic pathway
  that generates energy. Citrate formation is crucial for oocyte competence process.
  In the oocytes of DHEA-induced PCOS mice, TCA, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PD) activity, and lipid content is decreased, suggesting abnormal metabolism
  in the TCA cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway (HMP Shunt), which could negatively
  impact oocyte function. (C). Decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity
  is associated with the deficiency of NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I,
  CI). Insulin plays a crucial role in regulating OXPHOS activity. It affects mitochondrial
  function by influencing the electron transport chain and ATP production. Increased
  ROS production can have a negative impact on insulin sensitivity, leading to insulin
  resistance. (D). Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) allows protons to re-enter
  the mitochondrial matrix, uncoupling the OXPHOS process from ATP production and
  releasing energy as heat (non-shivering thermogenesis). In women with PCOS, reduced
  brown adipose tissue (BAT) function was observed, which may be attributed to high
  androgen levels.'
