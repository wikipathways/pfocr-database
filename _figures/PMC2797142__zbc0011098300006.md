caption: Integrative model of the regulation of ERα transcriptional activity by MKL1.
  Differentiated epithelial cells express proteins involved in calcium-dependent contacts
  such as E-cadherins. In these cells, the establishment of such contacts leads to
  a low activity of Rho GTPases, which displaces the equilibrium between G- and F-actin
  toward the generation of an important pool of G-actin. This form of actin interacts
  with MKL1 which, in this case, promotes the transcriptional activity of ERα through
  the potentiation of an AF1 box 1 activity. In contrast, in undifferentiated cells
  that have accomplished their epithelial to mesenchymal transition, the high activity
  of Rho GTPases triggers the polymerization of actin, which reduces the amounts of
  G-actin present in these cells. Actin-unbound MKL1 then inhibits the activity of
  the AF1 box 1 and weakens the transactivation potency of ERα.
