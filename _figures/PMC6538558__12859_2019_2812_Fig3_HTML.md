caption: Three example models in the CODA-ML format. To evaluate the utility of the
  CODA-ML format, three different examples are introduced. a The RTK signaling pathway
  includes the MAPK / ERK and PI3K / AKT signaling pathways linked to two cancer-related
  functions. Many molecules in this pathway have molecular modifications or are protein
  complexes, which requires molecular representation in detail. b Different isoforms
  originated from the same gene may have different effects to the same function. The
  mechanisms of the actions of cisplatin and gemcitabine show that drugs may target
  different isoforms, which highlights that molecular isoforms are essential for precise
  representation of mechanisms of drug actions. c The mechanism of genistein actions
  for hypertension was inferred by a previous model in a computational way. This mechanism
  shows that mechanisms of drug actions particularly, for complex diseases, may involve
  inter-anatomical relationships as well as intra-anatomy relationships
