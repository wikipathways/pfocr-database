caption: Interaction of Notch receptors with their ligands triggers a cascade of enzymatic
  cleavages of the receptor by ADAM family proteinases and the γ-secretase complex,
  which allow the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) to migrate into the nucleus. In
  the nucleus, NICD associates with a transcription factor, RBP-Jκ (also known as
  CSL for CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1) and activates transcription from the RBP-Jκ DNA binding
  site.
