caption: When Hippo sinaling pathway is turned off, YAP/TAZ is dephosphorylated and
  accumulates in the nucleus, which subsequently binds to TEADs to induce gene transcription.
  When the Hippo pathway is on, active LATS kinases phosphorylate YAP/TAZ, leading
  to cytosolic retention and degradation
