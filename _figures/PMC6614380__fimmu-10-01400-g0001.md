caption: 'Pathways to B cell memory. Na誰ve B cells become activated by direct recognition
  of antigens expressed on the surface of the pathogen. Top panel: Follicular (FO)
  na誰ve B cells become activated within the lymph node through a T cell-dependent
  pathway. CD4+ T cells become activated by recognizing viral peptides processed by
  FO dendritic cells and presented on their surface by MHC-II molecules. After becoming
  activated, both CD4+ T cells and B cells, travel to the T-B border in the lymph
  node, where they interact. Three outcomes can follow this interaction. (i) A germinal
  center (GC) is formed, CD4+ T cells polarize into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells
  and FO B cells differentiate into GC B cells. In the GC, B cells undergo rapid proliferation
  and somatic hypermutation of the Ig V regions in their B cell receptors (BCR), due
  to their interaction with Tfh cells through CD40-CD40L, PD1-PD-L1/L2, ICOS-ICOSL
  among others and the secretion of cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-21, affinity maturation
  takes place and those B cells that increase affinity toward their Ag are selected.
  Some of these B cells will also class-switch. These interactions result in the generation
  of IgM+ memory B cells (BMEM), IgG+/A+/E+ BMEM or IgG/A/E secreting long-lived plasma
  cells (LLPC) in this order in time. The later these cells are generated, the higher
  affinity and lesser cross-reactivity they have toward the antigen or antigen variants,
  respectively. (ii) Not all B cells enter the GC after interacting with their cognate
  activated CD4+ T cells in the T-B border, IgM+ BMEM and IgM secreting LLPCs are
  also generated outside of the GC, in a GC-independent (GCi) manner. (iii) Short-lived
  antibody secreting cells (ASC) are generated early after activation to generate
  a rapid response against the pathogen. These short-lived ASC will undergo apoptosis
  and do not contribute to the generation of B cell memory. Bottom panel: Some protein
  antigens provide highly repetitive antigenic structures, which induce strong BCR
  crosslinking. Viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) together with other danger signals
  also activate toll-like receptors such as TLR7. These strong signals are enough
  to activate B cells in a T cell-independent (TI) manner and generate short-lived
  IgM secreting ASC and IgM+ BMEM. B1b and marginal zone (MZ) B cells are activated
  in a TI manner and provide a faster response against the pathogen.'
