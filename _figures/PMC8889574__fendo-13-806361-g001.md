caption: Pathogenesis of bone loss in vasculitis; Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
  (ANCA)-associated vasculitis specific cells and antibodies are highlighted in orange.
  Primed neutrophils express PR3 [proteinase 3] or MPO [myeloperoxidase] which bind
  ANCAs and trigger further neutrophil activation and through CD4+ T-lymphocytes stimulation
  further ANCA production by B-lymphocytes. Key cells and cytokines in the pathogenesis
  of large vessel vasculitis {LVV} are highlighted in gray. Dendritic cells in the
  adventitia trigger the inflammatory cascade by activation of T-lymphocytes, predominantly
  T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells, and express interferon and IL17. Primed neutrophils
  and Th cells promote proinflammatory cytokine production (Interleukin-6 (IL6), IL1
  and Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha) which stimulates osteoclastogenesis through
  increased RANKL production by stromal cells and through direct osteoclast stimulation.
  Inflammatory cytokines also inhibit the formation of osteoblasts by increased DKK1
  and Sclerostin expression. Glucocorticoids suppress osteoblastogenesis by RUNX2
  suppresion and stimulates osteoclast proliferation and longevity. BMD, bond mineral
