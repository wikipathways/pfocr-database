caption: 'Schematic diagram of the Hippo pathway in Drosophila. Cells are shown with
  a blue outline, upstream regulatory proteins are shown in green/gray, intermediate
  core kinases are shown in yellow and downstream transcriptional proteins are shown
  in red, with sharp arrows and blunt arrows indicating activation and inhibition
  interactions, respectively. Continuous lines indicate direct communication, while
  dashed lines indicate indirect communication. Abbreviations: AJ, adherens junctions;
