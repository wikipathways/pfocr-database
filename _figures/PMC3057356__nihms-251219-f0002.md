caption: In the majority of bacteria, MTA is first converted by MTA/SAH nucleosidase
  into methylthioribose (MTR). In species with a complete methionine salvage cycle,
  MTR is subsequently phosphorylated by MTR kinase to 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate
  (MTRP). The thiomethyl group from MTRP is recycled in a multistep pathway back to
  methionine. This critical amino acid is also produced as a byproduct by SAM radical
  enzyme reactions during synthesis of vitamins and other metabolites. The byproduct,
  5′dADO, is also a substrate of MTA/SAH nucleosidase and this enzymatic reaction
  produces 5′deoxyribose and adenine. In eukaryotes and some environmental bacteria,
  MTA is catabolized by MTA phosphorylase to MTRP in a single step, which is then
  converted through the same enzymatic steps to methionine. A ribbon diagram of the
  MTA/SAH nucleosidase with bound substrate, MTA, (marked by oval) is shown.
