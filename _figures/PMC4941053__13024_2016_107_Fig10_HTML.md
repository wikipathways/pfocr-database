caption: The cognitive impairment mediated by the Reelin-Fyn-NR2B signaling pathway
  in 12-month-old ApoE4-TR mice that underwent early-life early CUMS intervention.
  ApoE secreted by astrocytes and Reelin produced by GABAergic neurons compete to
  bind to ApoER2 in neurons. Reelin binding to ApoER2 sequentially induces the activation
  of Dab1, SRC family tyrosine kinases (Fyn) and NMDAR2B subunits, which in turn promote
  the influx of Ca2+ and expression of the cognition-associated proteins. Following
  early-life CUMS intervention, the number of GABAergic neurons and the level of Reelin
  in the prefrontal cortex and the DG of the hippocampus of the 12-month-old ApoE4-TR
  mice, compared with those of other groups, are reduced, thus down-regulating the
  activation of Fyn/p-NR2B
