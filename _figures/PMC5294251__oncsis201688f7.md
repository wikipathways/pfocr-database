caption: 'Proposed model for the CD271 regulation and potential downstream effects
  mediating drug resistance and metastasis. (a) Alkylating drugs (fotemustine, TMZ),
  TOP2A inhibitors (etoposide) or inter-cross-linking agents (cisplatin) induce expression
  of CD271 in MeWoPar cells. (b) Drug-dependent DNA damage results in activation of
  the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related (ATR)
  pathway leading to formation of stabilized p53 (p-p53S15) and γH2AX. Stabilized
  p53 may regulate expression of CD271. (c) Phenotypic consequences associated with
  increased CD271 expression levels. Left: drug-sensitive cell population (CD271 low),
  middle: Short-term drug treatment of sensitive cell population (CD271 intermediate),
  right: drug-resistant cell population (CD271 high), prone to metastasis. (d) Left:
  Downstream consequences of enhanced CD271/NGFR expression by drug treatment or overexpression
  (NGFR-GFP). Right: sustained expression of CD271 regulating drug resistance (FGF13,
  TOP2A, NEK2) and metastasis-associated (RAD51AP1, TOP2A) genes.'
