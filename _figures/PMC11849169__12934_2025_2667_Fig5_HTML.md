caption: 'Construction of a biosynthetic pathway for CK production in S. cerevisiae.
  (A) Log2-fold changes in the transcription levels of CCW12, RAP1, and the top five
  highly transcribed glycolytic genes (TDH3, GPM1, TDH1, ENO1, and FBA1) in CEN.PK-Rap
  at the DSP and PDSP compared to those at the EP, as observed in the NGS analysis;
  (B) CK biosynthetic pathway in the CK01 strain. Red: heterologous genes from Panax
  ginseng; orange: engineered genes from S. cerevisiae. tHMGR1, truncated HMG-CoA
  reductase; PgSE, P. ginseng squalene epoxidase; PgDS, P. ginseng dammarenediol-II
  synthase; PgPPDS, P. ginseng protopanaxadiol synthase; PgCPR, P. ginseng cytochrome
  P450 reductase; PgUGT71A27, P. ginseng UDP-glycosyltransferases 71A27. All integrated
  genes are controlled under the TDH3 promoter. Blue: PMET3-ERG7: the promoter of
  yeast lanosterol synthase gene (ERG7) was replaced with a methionine- repressible
  MET3 promoter'
