caption: The Stat1 signaling pathway and modulation by T. gondii. 1, IFN-γ binding
  causes receptor dimerization. 2, This causes receptor associated Jak molecules to
  tyrosine phosphorylate each other, leading in turn to recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation
  of Stat1 (step 3). Activated Stat1 dissociates from the receptor complex and dimerizes
  in the cytosol (step 5). Stat1 dimers translocate to the nucleus (step 6) where
  they bind to IFN-γ responsive promoter elements. Full Stat1 transcriptional activity
  requires serine phosphorylation dependent upon phosphatidylinositiol 3-kinase (PI3-K)
  and protein kinase B/Akt (step 7). Multiple studies suggest that Toxoplasma interferes
  with Stat1 signaling, but the control points are less clear. There is evidence that
  T. gondii prevents Stat1 phosphorylation and causes its degradation. Other data
  suggest that the parasite prevents Stat1 nuclear translocation. Finally, some studies
  suggest that Stat1 is subject to dephosphorylation following nuclear translocation.
