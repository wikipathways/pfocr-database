caption: A, Structures of the four approved PARPi. Heteroatoms compatible with covalent
  attachment to β-eliminative linkers are indicated in red. B, General mechanism for
  release of amine containing drugs mediated by β-elimination. C, Schematic showing
  the strategy for conjugation and mechanism of release of drugs containing poorly
  nucleophilic heteroatoms such as the phthalazinone of TLZ. Here, the R1 group stabilizes
  the carbamate favoring the β-eliminative pathway over spontaneous SN1-mediated release.
