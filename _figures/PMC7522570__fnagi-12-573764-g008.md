caption: Expression of orthologs annotated for the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (ko00010) pathway present in pleural
  ventral caudal sensory neuron (PVC) expression clusters with decreasing trend (P4
  and P5). Each node of the pathway diagram represents an ortholog assigned to an
  Aplysia californica transcript. Nodes are divided into seven colored sections, from
  left to right, ages 6 to 12 months. Node sections are colored according to their
  mean centered and variance scaled expression, together representing the expression
  trends of each node across the aging process. Nodes that are not colored were absent
  from the gene sets of expression clusters P4 and P5. Pathway enrichment demonstrates
  broad downregulation in glucose metabolism with age including pathways involved
  in synthesis of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate, which feeds into the TCA cycle.
