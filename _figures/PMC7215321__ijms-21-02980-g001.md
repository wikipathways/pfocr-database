caption: 'Targeted therapeutics and immunotherapy used in the treatment of melanoma
  patients. Melanoma cells exert hyperactivation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling
  pathway that regulates different cellular programs, including survival. Targeted
  therapeutics (shown in green background) inhibit activity of either mutated BRAF
  (BRAF*, V600E is the most frequent amino acid substitution) or MEK1/2. BRAFi and
  MEKi are used as a combinatory treatment regimen. Immunotherapy (shown in yellow
  background) includes checkpoint inhibitors: antibodies blocking either PD-1 (programmed
  death-1) or CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4). Both targets for
  immunotherapy are physiological inhibitors of T cell-mediated immune response. RTK,
  receptor tyrosine kinase.'
