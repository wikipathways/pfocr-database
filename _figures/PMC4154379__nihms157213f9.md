caption: Binding of TNF-α to its receptor causes the recruitment of TRADD, FADD, and
  TRAF-2 proteins and activates TAK1. Activation of TAK1 leads to the activation of
  downstream kinases, including ERK1/2, p38, and IKK, which in turn leads to the activation
  of AP-1 or NF-κB transcription factors. TNF-α also activates Akt kinase, which leads
  to the activation of NF-κB transcription factor possibly through the activation
  of IKK. Activation and nuclear translocation of AP-1 and NF-κB results in the increased
  expression of the Mmp-9 gene resulting in production of the MMP-9 protein in extracellular
  environment.
