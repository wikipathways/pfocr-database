caption: WNK4 kinase inhibits NCC activity. Multiple secondary messengers modulate
  WNK4 action. L-WNK1 inhibits WNK4, but is suppressed by ks-WNK1. L-WNK1 also phosphorylates
  OSR1/SPAK, thereby activating NCC. Symbols are as in Figure ; secondary messenger
  proteins and ion transporter sizes vary relative to their proposed activity. (A)
  Our results suggest that SGK1, induced transcriptionally by aldosterone and activated
  by PI3K, negatively regulates WNK4’s action on NCC by phosphorylating 2 C-terminal
  serines of WNK4. SGK1 also positively effects ENaC and ROMK activity in the cortical
  collecting duct (CCD) through regulatory pathways that include SGK1. (B) Schematic
  proposal of renal response to hypovolemia, through hyperreninemia and/or stimulation
  of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Here SGK1 and WNK1 target similar C-terminal
  WNK4 serines for phosphorylation, relieving the WNK4 inhibitory effect on NCC, increasing
  NCC-mediated Na+/Cl– cotransport (shown by arrow thickness) while diminishing the
  regulatory value of SGK1 and other mechanisms in the CCD that lead to K+ secretion.
  (C) Schematic proposal of renal response to aldosterone stimulation by hyperkalemia.
  In the DCT there is upregulation of ks-WNK1 activity, which — by squelching L-WNK1
  — leads to heightened WNK4 activity, low SPAK/OSR1 activity, and reduced NCC-mediated
  NaCl transport. We surmise that SGK1 has a transient effect on WNK4 with downstream
  ENaC and ROMK activation by SGK1 and other aldosterone-sensitive mechanisms, restoring
  potassium balance without affecting extracellular volume.
