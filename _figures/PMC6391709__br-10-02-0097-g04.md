caption: PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK signalling pathways associated with cardiac hypertrophy.
  Signal transduction pathways critical for myosin growth include PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK/ERK.
  The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway has been reported to serve a regulatory role
  in cell growth, metabolism, survival and angiogenesis, and to govern the development
  and transformation of left ventricular hypertrophy. The ERK signaling pathway, the
  members of which belong to the MAPK family, comprises a cascade of a series of successively
  acting kinases that finally lead to phosphorylation and activation of terminal kinases
  including p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinases and ERK. miR-133 has a critical role in
  determining cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and miR-21 has also been implicated in the
  regulation of cardiac fibrosis and cardiac muscle contractility, and has been shown
  to negatively regulate phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene expression. PI3K,
  phosphoinositide-3-kinase; AKT, serine/threonine protein kinase; mTOR, mechanistic
  target of rapamycin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; Ang II, angiotensin II; DAG, diacylglycerol; Et, endothelin;
