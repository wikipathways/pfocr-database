caption: 'Figure 1. LIM kinases tumor progression function is tightly regulated by
  major oncogene and tumor supressors. The actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin
  family of proteins plays a prominent role in promoting actin depolymerization. Cofilin
  is phosphorylated mainly by LIMK1 and LIMK2. In its phosphorylated state, cofilin
  is inactive. The unphosphorylated active cofilin induces severing of actin filaments
  and participates in many cellular functions critical for normal and cancer cells,
  such as cell migration, cell cycle, and neuronal differentiation. LIMK activation
  is regulated by Rho family GTPases, which are themselves targets for Ras activity.
  In general, LIMK2 is activated by Rho, whereas LIMK1 is activated by Rac1. Neurofibromin
  1 (NF1) regulates LIMK activity through several pathways: its GRD domain inhibits
  the Ras-dependent pathway and independently also inhibits a Rho-dependent pathway,
  which activates LIMK2; the pre-GRD domain inhibits the Ras-independent Rac1-activation
  pathway, which regulates LIMK1; and NF1 also directly inhibits ROCK-induced phosphorylation
  of LIMK2. LIMK2 is a cancer cell-survival factor that mediates p53-mediated survival
  of cancer cells following DNA damage. In addition, LIMK2 is directly activated by
  Aurora A and is a key oncogenic effector of this kinase. We suggest that inhibition
  of LIMK2 has promising therapeutic potential for cancer cells characterized by LIMK2
  overactivation or by overactivation of LIMK2 upstream signaling pathways such as
  those of RhoA, p53, and Aurora A kinase.'
