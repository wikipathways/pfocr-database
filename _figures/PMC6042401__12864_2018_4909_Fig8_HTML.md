caption: Alterations in CREB signaling. Many genes in the CREB signaling pathway showed
  altered expression with age, including PKA, an important second messenger in neurons
  necessary for activation of both CREB and iGluR. See Figure  for specific iGluR
  genes that were downregulated

  neurons in Aplysia californica.
