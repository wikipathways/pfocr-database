caption: A schematic drawing of the major neuroprotective signaling pathways regulated
  by ghrelin and GHS. The canonical pathway of ghrelin and GHS activities involves
  their binding to the GHS-R1a receptor. GHS-R1a activation results in the hydroxylation
  of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate the secondary messengers
  inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which lead to mobilization
  of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) stores and to protein kinase C (PKC) activation.
  PKC mediates different cellular responses, including the stimulation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs), and the protein inositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. The
  alternative pathways of ghrelin and GHS activities include the binding and activation
  of CD36 or other unknown receptors, which stimulates the activation of MAPKs and
  Akt, inhibits the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce the activation
  of BAX, a pro-apoptotic molecule, suppressing apoptosis and improving cell survival.
  Ghrelin and GHS also attenuate neuroinflammation involving the NLRP3 inflammasome
  signaling pathway and pyroptosis. Created in Biorender.com.
