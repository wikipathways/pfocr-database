caption: Model depicting how the Wg signal controls phosphorylation-dependent degradation
  of Arm. Daxin assembles Zw3, CKIα, Dsh, PP2A-C, and Arm in close proximity. Drosophila
  APC is not shown in this figure because the present study does not deal with this
  protein. CKIα constitutively primes Arm phosphorylation at Ser56. In the absence
  of Wg, Zw3 recognizes this priming phosphate then sequentially phosphorylates Thr52,
  Ser48, and Ser44. The latter two phosphorylations are required for the binding of
  an F-box protein, Slimb, that targets Arm for ubiquitination and degradation. PP2A-C
  appears to counteract the CKIα-mediated-phosphorylation of Arm, as well as the Zw3-mediated
  phosphorylation of Arm and Daxin. Although its molecular mechanism is unknown, the
  binding of Wg to the Dfrizzled2-Arrow receptor complex is speculated to induce conformational
  changes in Dsh that prevent Zw3 from phosphorylating Arm at Thr52, Ser48, and Ser44
  on the one hand and elicit CKIα-mediated phosphorylation of Dsh itself on the other.
  However, CKIα-mediated Arm phosphorylation at Ser56 is not affected by Wg signaling.
  The mechanism by which Wg signaling counteracts Zw3-mediated phosphorylation of
  Arm is poorly understood, but the present study ruled out both Ser9 phosphorylation-induced
  inactivation of Zw3 kinase (Fig. ) and the involvement of PP2A (Fig. ). In this
  process, Frat/GBP has been proposed to evoke the dissociation of GSK-3β from Axin
  in vertebrates (, , ). However, Drosophila has no apparent Frat/GBP counterpart.
  Wnt/Wg signaling also diminishes GSK-3β/Zw3-mediated phosphorylation of Axin/Daxin
  (Fig. ), which appears to lower Axin/Daxin's affinity to β-catenin () and Zw3 (),
  which were shown to stimulate the release of β-catenin from the degradation complex
  and speculated to reduce Arm phosphorylation, respectively. In Drosophila, it still
  remains unclear whether Wg-induced phosphorylation of Dsh by CKIα is essential for
  normal Wg signal transduction. However, in vertebrates Wnt-induced Dvl/Xdsh phosphorylation
  by CKIɛ has been shown to enhance the binding of Frat/GBP to Dvl/Xdsh that promotes
  the disintegration of the β-catenin destruction complex, which eventually leads
  to activation of the Wnt pathway (, ).
