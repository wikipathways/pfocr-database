caption: Effects of high homocysteine levels on inflammation and calcification. Hyperhomocysteinemia
  induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in endothelial cells and vascular
  smooth muscle cells. This results in apoptosis and inflammation through multiple
  cellular signaling pathways that create endoplasmic reticular stress and endothelial
  dysfunction. In addition, ROS allow vascular smooth muscle cells to differentiate
  with mitotic and osteo-like features in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  pathway and an uncertain mechanism. Calcium apatite is deposited on the blood vessel
  wall and released from apoptosis and matrix vesicles of osteo-like vascular smooth
  muscle cells. GPx1, glutathione peroxidase 1; SOD, superoxide dismutase; NO, nitric
