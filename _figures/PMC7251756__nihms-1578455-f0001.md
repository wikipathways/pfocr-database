caption: (A) Model depicting major metabolic routes of glucose metabolites in adipocytes.
  In the fed state, insulin stimulates GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane
  and facilitates glucose uptake. Metabolites of glucose generated during glycolysis
  can enter the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which generates NADPH for lipid synthesis;
  the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), which generates UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
  (UDP-GlcNAc) and promotes O-GlcNAcylation of proteins; and the glycerol-3-phosphoate
  pathway, which is required to make the glycerol backbone for assembling triacylglycerides
  (TAGs). Glucose carbons that enter into the mitochondrial TCA cycle as pyruvate
  are converted to citrate by citrate synthase (CS). Citrate can remain in the TCA
  cycle, or in times of nutrient abundance, be exported into the cytoplasm and enter
  the DNL pathway. The major DNL enzymes are ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), which generates
  acetyl-CoA; acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which generates malonyl-CoA; and fatty
  acid synthase (FASN), which synthesizes palmitate. Palmitate is the primary end
  product of DNL, which can be further processed by desaturases and elongases. DNL
  enzyme and Glut4 transcription are regulated by ChREBP. Other glycolytic-derived
  metabolites, such as xylulose-5-phophate (X-5-P) and glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P),
  are thought to directly stimulate ChREBP activity. Acetyl-CoA can also be produced
  from acetate by ACSS2 although ACSS2’s function in adipocytes is not well understood.
  Note that a large fraction of the lipid stored in TAGs is derived from circulating
  lipids taken up into the adipocytes, which is discussed in the text but excluded
  from the figure for simplicity. (B-E) Metabolic intermediates in the DNL pathway
  also have important second messenger functions, some of which are indicated in each
  panel for the indicated metabolites, (B) citrate, (C) acetyl-CoA, (D) malonyl-CoA,
  and (E) palmitate. Disruption in the utilization of these metabolites as second
  messengers by altering their synthesis, degradation, or flux towards different pathways,
  could also lead to adipocyte dysfunction in obesity.
