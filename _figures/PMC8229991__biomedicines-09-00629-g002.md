caption: TGF-beta, BMP, and Activin signaling pathways are associated with upregulated
  genes by Activin-A. (A) Association with TGF-beta signaling pathway; (B) Association
  with BMP receptor signaling pathway. (C) Association with Activin signaling pathway.
  Pathway analysis on non-FDR-corrected differentially expressed genes with p < 0.01
  performed with GeneMania (genemania.org, accessed on 21 September 2020). Figures
  are adjustments of the enrichment map of consolidated pathways TGF-beta signaling
  (MSigDB M2642) (A), BMP receptor signaling (MSigDB M181) (B), and signaling by Activin
  (MSigDB M26965) (C), Boxed genes are genes from the input list; the other genes
  are relevant genes added by GeneMania. Size of the nodes is dependent on the number
  of interactions that gene has with the network.
