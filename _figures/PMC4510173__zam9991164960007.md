caption: CSP and XIP activation of comX (, ), and some possible models for the interaction
  of low pH with the ComR/ComS feedback system that controls PcomX. ComS is processed
  to form XIP, which forms with ComR a complex that is the immediate activator of
  PcomX. We have previously hypothesized that ComR may form an activating complex
  with either XIP or ComS (). CSP activates the ComD/ComE two-component system, which
  in turn stimulates the ComR/ComS system, although the connecting pathway is not
  known. Low pH could potentially suppress PcomX activity by inhibiting import of
  exogenous XIP (scenario 1), inhibiting expression of comS (scenario 2), inhibiting
  formation of the ComR/ComS or ComR/XIP complex that activates transcription of both
  comS and comX (scenario 3), or enhancing degradation of ComS and/or XIP (scenario
  4). (Adapted from reference  with permission of John Wiley & Sons [copyright 2012

  description: CSP and XIP activation of comX (, ), and some possible models for the

    complex with either XIP or ComS (). CSP activates the ComD/ComE two-component

    of both comS and comX (scenario 3), or enhancing degradation of ComS and/or XIP
