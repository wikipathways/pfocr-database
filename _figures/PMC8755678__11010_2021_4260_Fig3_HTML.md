caption: Regulation of endothelial metabolism. VEGFA induces LDHA, PFKFB3, GLUT1,
  etc., through the VEGFR2 mediated glycolysis pathway to support tip cell migration.
  Hypoxia can also promote glycolysis by inducing HIF1α. Glycolysis also supports
  stalk cell proliferation by downregulating DLL4-NOTCH1 signalling-dependent PFKFB3
  gene expression. Furthermore, even VEGFA blocks growth-inhibiting transcription
  factor FOXO1 via VEGFR2 mediated PI3K/AKT pathway to support the proliferation of
  stalk cells. Also, growth-enhancing transcription factor MYC promotes growth, anabolic
  metabolism, and proliferation of stalk cells. Along with glucose, proliferating
  stalk cells consume fatty acids, contributing to nucleotide synthesis for cellular
  proliferation. But in quiescent phalanx cells, FOXO1 represses MYC signaling to
  reduce glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism. In addition, turbulent blood flow-induced
  shear stress-mediated activation of transcription factor KLF2 leads to reduced metabolic
  rate
