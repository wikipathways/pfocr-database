caption: 'Hepatic SAMe metabolism. SAMe is synthesized in the cytosol of every cell.
  However, SAMe synthesis and utilization occurs mainly in the liver. SAMe is generated
  from methionine and ATP in a reaction catalyzed by MAT (1). MTA is produced from
  SAMe through the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, and this compound is metabolized
  solely by MTA-phosphorylase to yield 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate and adenine,
  a crucial step in the methionine and purine salvage pathways, respectively. In transmethylation,
  SAMe donates its methyl group to a large variety of acceptor molecules in reactions
  catalyzed by dozens of methyltransferases. The most abundant of these methyltransferases
  in mammalian liver is GNMT (2). SAH is generated as a product of transmethylation
  and is hydrolyzed to form homocysteine (Hcy) and adenosine through a reversible
  reaction catalyzed by SAH hydrolase (3). Hcy lies at the junction of two intersecting
  pathways: the transsulfuration pathway : In the liver, Hcy forms cysteine via a
  two-step enzymatic process catalyzed by cystathionineβ-synthase (CBS) (4) and cystathionase
  (5), which converts the sulfur atom of methionine to cysteine and glutathione; and
  the remethylation pathway : homocysteine can be remethylated to form methionine
  by two different enzymes, methionine synthase (MS) (6), and betaine homocysteine
  methyltransferase (BHMT) (7), and is coupled to the folate cycle. In this cycle,
  tetrahydrofolate (THF) is converted to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF)
  by the enzyme methylene Tetrahydrofolate synthase (8) and then to 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate
  (5-MTHF) by the enzyme methylene Tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) (9).'
