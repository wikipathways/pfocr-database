caption: Interactions of the Eph/ephrin system in adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC).
  The EphA2/ephrinA1 signaling pathway regulates tumor angiogenesis and is associated
  with advanced TNM stage, perineural invasion, and vascular invasion. EphA2 expression
  is increased in the solid pattern of basaloid AdCC, correlating with greater aggressiveness.
  EphA2 overexpression reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in AdCC.
  The long non-coding RNA HCG11 regulates miR-1297, which negatively controls EphA2,
  contributing to tumor progression. Additionally, EphA2 modulates epithelial and
  mesenchymal markers, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in AdCC.
  The absence of ephrinA1 is associated with perineural spread. Overall, the Eph/ephrin
  axis influences tumor heterogeneity by regulating the expression of various family
  members, including EFNA1, EPHA2, EphrinA1, and EphA2. Created in BioRender. Egal,
