caption: Schematic representation of the transcriptional modulation of the inflammatory
  response in PD. (A) Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is subjected to tight regulation
  by the nuclear κ B inhibitor α (IκBα). Upon activation by pathogen-associated or
  damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs, respectively), the IκB kinase
  (IKK) targets IκBα for degradation, allowing NF-κB to transactivate the expression
  of proinflammatory genes. (B) Nuclear receptor related 1 protein (NURR1) controls
  the expression of essential genes for the survival of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons,
  but also in glial cells has the potential to repress the activity of NF-κB when
  recruiting the corepressor complex CoREST. (C) Reduced levels of the enzyme RALDH1
  in PD may impair proper synthesis of retinoic acid (RA), essential for the nigrostriatal
  pathway. Moreover, RA and its derivatives have shown to have key anti-inflammatory
  effects, that, therefore, would be lessened in PD. (D) NRF2 controls the transcription
  of antioxidant genes, thereby reducing the oxidative burst. NRF2 directly represses
  the transcription of the proinflammatory interleukin 1β (IL1β) and interleukin 6
  (IL6). The overall effect of this transcription factor is to counteract the proinflammatory
  phenotype (M1) in favor of the anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype.
