caption: Proposed nongenomic signaling pathways involved in Cd-exposed ht-UtLM cells.
  Cd-induced proliferative effects observed in ht-UtLM cells have been shown to occur
  through the membrane/cytosolic GPER receptor via activation of the nongenomic GPER/EGFR/MAPK
  signaling pathway. Cd concurrently increases the expression of FOXM1 and Cyclin
  D1 downstream of MAPK44/42, which in turn upregulates the kinase Aurora B, leading
  to Histone H3 phosphorylation at the serine 10 site, and resulting in human uterine
  leiomyoma cell proliferation
