caption: Cancer stem cell generation and mechanisms of PERs action on cancer stem
  cells. The origination and persistence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) are linked to
  cellular plasticity. Responding to changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME),
  cells can remodel from stem to differentiated state during epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT). CSCs persist by activating the EMT program and maintaining a dormant
  state to sustain themselves while spreading and adapting to various conditions in
  the new TME. High levels of PERs downregulate BMAL1 expression and prevent β-catenin
  translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway,
  thereby inhibiting tumor progression. Created in https://BioRender.com
