caption: Diagram illustrates the signaling pathway regulating mitophagy. In damaged
  mitochondria, PINK1 located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, can phosphorylate
  Ser65 in the ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like domain of Parkin and further facilitates
  its localization from the cytosol to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Moreover,
  Parkin can also promote the ubiquitination of MFN1, MFN2, TOM20 and VDAC to further
  induce mitophagy. In response to hypoxia and nutritional deprivation, BNIP3 and
  NIX-mediated mitophagy is induced. In this process, BNIP3 and NIX directly interact
  with LC3 to enhance mitophagy. And BNIP3 and NIX also bind to the BH3 domain of
  Beclin1 to activate mitophagy. What’s more, similar to BNIP3/NIX, FUNDC1 interacts
  with LC3 through its LIR to activate mitophagy under hypoxic conditions.
