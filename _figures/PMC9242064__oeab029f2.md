caption: Schematic diagram showing the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease
  and increased risk of venous thromboembolic events and potential mechanisms. In
  inflammatory bowel disease patients, significant platelet alterations, hypercoagulability,
  endothelial dysfunction, increase in neutrophil extracellular traps, and possible
  interruption of gut microbiota could increase the risk of venous thromboembolic
  events and pulmonary embolism. CDI, Clostridium difficile infection; DVT, deep venous
  thromboembolism; EC, endothelial cell; EPCR, endothelial protein C receptor; F2,
