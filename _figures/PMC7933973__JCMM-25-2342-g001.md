caption: Current mechanisms underlying KLF5 effects on kidney diseases. KLF5 can regulate
  inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis and cell proliferation in kidney via activation/inhibition
  of a variety of pathways, as detailed in the current review article. Various signalling
  pathways modulated by KLF5 are colour‐coded and references attached to each pathway
  are included in the figure
