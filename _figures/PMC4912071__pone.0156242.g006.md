caption: 'Size indicates the enrichment score of the gene set representing each pathway.
  Colour indicates the up/down direction of regulation: Red, up; blue, down. Brightness
  indicates uni-directionality of regulation. The ‘Self’ cluster on bottom-left includes
  pathways not mapped to other pathways since their intersections scores were below
  a threshold.'
