caption: Anandamide can be internalized by neurons through an as yet unidentified
  transport mechanism, “the endocannabinoid transporter (AMT)”. Once inside neurons,
  AEA is rapidly cleaved by the hydrolytic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)
  to give arachidonic acid (AA) and ethanolamine (EA). Alternatively, different lipoxygenases
  (LOXs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) can metabolize AEA, generating hydroxyl derivatives
  of AEA (HAEAs) and prostaglandins-ethanolamides (PG-EAs), respectively. On the other
  hand, in FAAH (−/−) mice, AEA is converted into o-phosphorylcholine (o-PC)-AEA by
  an unidentified biosynthetic pathway and o-PC-AEA can in turn be catabolized to
  AA by a choline-specific phosphodiesterase (NPP6). AMT, anandamide membrane transporter.
