caption: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are two functionally
  and structurally distinct complexes. In response to growth factors (e.g. IGFs) and
  hormones (e.g. insulin), mTORC1 is activated via the PI3K/AKT/TSC/RHEB pathway,
  whereas amino acids activate mTORC1 via RAG GTPases (reviewed in []). mTORC1 phosphorylates
  and inactivates translational inhibitor 4E-BPs, which then allows eIF4F complex
  assembly. Increased levels of eIF4F lead to reprogramming of the translatome which
  in part leads to selective increase in translation of long 5′UTR mRNAs that encode
  factors that protect mitochondrial integrity, and short 5′UTR mRNAs which encode
  components of the electron transport chain (ETC) complex. When energy resources
  are limiting, AMPK is activated to reduce anabolic processes, while stimulating
  catabolic ones (reviewed in []. This is in part achieved by inhibition of mTORC1.
  eEF2K phosphorylates eEF2 which interferes with its ribosomal association and reduces
  elongation rates. This suppresses protein synthesis and reduces energy consumption.
  mTORC1 and ERK inactivate eEF2K thereby increasing protein synthesis, whereas AMPK
  activates eEF2K and reduces translation rates. GCN2 and PERK are major eIF2α kinases
  that sense nutritional (e.g. limited glucose, amino acids etc.) and endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress, respectively. eIF2α phosphorylation coincides with reduction
  in ternary complex (TC) levels. This leads to the suppression of global translation
  while translationally activating some of the upstream open reading frame (uORF)
  containing mRNAs including CHOP, ATF4, GADD34. ATF4 induces upregulation of amino
  acid transporters and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases as well as a number of autophagy
  protein-encoding genes, including p62, ATG16L, LC3B, ATG12, ATG3, and BECN1. AMPK
  is a major positive regulator of the autophagy protein ULK1, while mTORC1 is a major
  negative regulator of autophagy. The ULK1 complex functions to initiate autophagosome
  formation along with the PI3K complex. This increased autophagic flux allows for
  cytoplasmic components to be recycled during acute nutrient starvation to feed back
  into the synthesis of vital proteins. Collectively, mTOR, AMPK, and eIF2α kinases
  coordination show multifaceted signaling nodes of nutrient sensing, translation,
  and autophagy. Of note, this representation of the pathways is simplified to highlight
  the mechanisms of coordination of mRNA translation, metabolism and autophagy. Detailed
  representation of mTOR, AMPK pathways and autophagy can be found in [,,].
