caption: The screening, construction, and composition of HCC related ceRNA network.
  (A) The screening flowchart of the HCC related ceRNA network is composed of circRNA,
  miRNA, and mRNA. The purple ellipses and rectangles represent the intersection of
  the datasets covered by them, and the overlapping RNAs obtained were used for the
  following analysis. The blue rectangle represents the 61 overlapped mRNAs used for
  the GO and KEGG analysis. (B) The construction of 5 HCC related ceRNA networks.
  The triangles, diamonds, and ellipses represent circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA, respectively.
  The red and green colors represent up-regulation and down-regulation in HCC tissues,
  respectively. (C) The heatmaps of two circRNAs expressions in GSE97332. (D) The
  heatmaps of two miRNAs expression in GSE108724. (E) The heatmaps of five mRNAs expression
  in GSE101728 dataset.
