caption: Alteration of protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and ARMC5 in bilateral adrenal
  hyperplasia. (A) In normal adrenocortical cells, ACTH activates the MC2R receptor,
  leading to the activation of the Gα subunits of the G protein. The latter activates
  the adenylate cyclase (AC), which converts the ATP in cAMP. The phosphodiesterases
  (PDE) inactivates cAMP in AMP. The regulatory (R) subunits of the PKA bind the cAMP,
  leading to the release of the catalytic (C) subunits. The catalytic subunits phosphorylate
  their targets, including the cAMP Response Element-Binding protein (CREB), which
  activates genes involved in steroidogenesis. ARMC5 blocks the cell cycle in G1 phase
  and induces apoptosis. ARMC5 is degraded by Culin3. (B) In PPNAD and iMAD, the PKA
  pathway is activated by (1) mutations in the regulatory subunit R1α of PKA, (2)
  mutations in phosphodiesterases genes, and (3) duplication of the catalytic subunit
  Cα have also been described. (C) In PBMAH, the PKA pathway is activated by (1) ACTH
  locally produced by clusters of corticotropin adrenal cells, (2) mutations in the
  gene coding for MC2R, (3) mutations in gene GNAS coding for Gα, (4) aberrant expression
  of G-coupled protein receptors, (5) mutations in phosphodiesterase genes, (6) duplication
  of the catalytic subunit Cα, and (7) ARMC5 mutations, which lead to the activation
  of the cell cycle and the loss of apoptosis. Moreover, some mutations prevent its
  binding to Culin3 and its subsequent degradation. In addition, ARMC5 decreases the
  PKA activity.
