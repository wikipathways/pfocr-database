caption: a) Schematic representation of molecular mechanisms regulating LC3-associated
  phagocytosis. Engagement of an extracellular receptor (such as TLR, FcR, or PtdSer-R)
  by its ligand during phagocytosis recruits members of the autophagy machinery to
  the ligand-containing vesicle. b) Schematic representation of classical metabolic
  activation (“M1”) of macrophages. Induced by a combination of microbial components,
  such as LPS and IFN-γ, M1 macrophages utilize aerobic glycolysis and the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) to produce nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines to mount an effective response against highly proliferative
  intracellular pathogens. c) Schematic representation of alternative metabolic activation
  (“M2”) of macrophages. Triggered by type 2 cytokines, such as IL-4 ad IL-13, the
  M2 phenotype is considered anti-inflammatory attenuates excessive inflammation,
  promotes tissue repair, and provides allergic and anti-parasitic responses.
