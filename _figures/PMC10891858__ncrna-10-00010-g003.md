caption: Due to dietary overload, injured hepatocytes (HCs) will induce the production
  of ROS and inflammatory cytokines, caused by hepatocyte organelle dysfunction. This
  will induce the release of endogenous signals that will enhance Kupffer cells (KCs)
  polarization. The prolonged release of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1, IL-6, and
  TNF-α) will subsequently activate HSCs and LSECs. HSCs are responsible for fibrogenic
  pathway activation while LSECs provide a platform for adhesion of blood-derived
  immune cells. The LSECs will also enhance the polarization of KCs (Created with
