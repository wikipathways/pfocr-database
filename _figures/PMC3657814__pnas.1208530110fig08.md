caption: 'A model: Myc-induced altered metabolism activates AMPK and p53, which sensitizes
  the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Activation of Myc promotes metabolic transformation,
  which adapts cells to meet the biosynthetic and bioenergetic requirements of rapid
  cell proliferation. Metabolic transformation decreases cellular ATP levels, activating
  the cellular energy sensor AMPK. AMPK promotes catabolic mode of metabolism (phospho-ACC)
  and contributes to establishment of glutaminolytic pathway (GLS). These AMPK-mediated
  processes release carbon for bioenergetic reactions and provide glutamine-derived
  nitrogen for biosynthesis of nucleic acids and nonessential amino acids (). However,
  AMPK also induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15, which stabilizes the protein
  and leads to mitochondrial accumulation of p53. At the mitochondrial surface, phospho-p53
  adjoins and rearranges the Bak–Bcl-xL complex (Fig. S3N), resulting in conformational
  activation of Bak and apoptotic sensitization. This mechanism may act as a failsafe
  mechanism against cells with an inability to recover from energy stress, for example,
  due to oncogene-enforced cell cycle progression.'
