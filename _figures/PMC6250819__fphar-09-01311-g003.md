caption: Hypothetical scheme showing symptomatic antiparkinsonian effects of c-Abl
  inhibitors. Depicted are the possible roles of c-Abl inhibitors at post-synaptic
  levels in the striatum. In the postsynaptic medium spiny neurons, dopamine deficiency
  may induce c-Abl activation to increase phosphorylation of Cdk5 at Tyr15 (Cdk5-Tyr15)
  and DARPP-32 at Thr75 (DARPP-32-Tyr75), resulting in an increased activity of the
  Cdk5/DARPP32-Thr75 pathway, which leads to parkinsonian symptoms. Thus, c-Abl inhibitors
  may exert symptomatic antiparkinsonian effects at the post-synaptic level. PD, Parkinson’s
  disease; D1R, D1-type dopamine receptor; D2R; D2-type dopamine receptor; Cdk5-pTyr15,
  Cdk5 with tyr15 phosphorylation; T34, Threonine 34; T75, Threonine 75.
