caption: A network of diverse regulatory inputs controls RovA transcriptional output
  in Yersinia. Available RovA is strictly controlled by cascade regulation at both
  the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in response to multiple environmental
  cues. The strongest influence on RovA production is through two opposing pathways.
  The first is an auto amplification loop, which in turn is responsive to thermo-regulated
  proteolysis of RovA by ClpXP and Lon proteases. The second is via RovM that is principally
  mediated by the prominent Csr and Crp pathways responsive to carbon and glucose
  availability. Other regulatory pathways are known, but the extent to which they
  alter RovM or RovA levels is less clear. In the diagram, induction of RovA expression
  is indicated by an arrow, while repression is indicated by a blunted line. For simplicity,
  information concerning whether the pathway is direct or indirect has been omitted
  on the basis that this is not always defined.
