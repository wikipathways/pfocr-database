caption: Schematic representation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Enzymes involved
  in the pathway shown are CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3′H;
  F3′5′H; F3H, flavanone-3β-hydroxylase; DFR; LDOX; FLS, flavonol synthase; LAR; ANR;
  and UFGT. Examples for the different hydroxylation patterns of the flavonoid B-ring
  are given for naringenin (4′-hydroxylated), eriodictyol (3′,4′-hydroxylated), and
  pentahydroxyflavone (3′,4′,5′-hydroxylated).
