caption: The rTHF cycle and reverse gcv pathway established in E. coli. Red arrows
  indicate heterologous pathways, black arrows indicate native pathways, and blue
  arrows indicate overexpressed native pathways. The red Xs indicate genes knocked
  out. Carbon-labeling patterns in glycine, serine, and pyruvate based on FA and CO2
  carbons are indicated. Blue- and orange-colored carbons originated from FA and CO2,
  respectively. Numbers in each carbon represent the carbon number in each compound.
  Recombinant plasmids designed and used in this study are also shown.
