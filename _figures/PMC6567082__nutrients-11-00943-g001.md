caption: Crocus sativus extract affects the cell cycle by blocking the G2 and S phase
  via p53 and CyclinB-cdk2 proteins. Cancer cells with p53 loss of function have a
  dysfunctional G1/S checkpoint whereas the G2/M checkpoint may still be functional.
  When cells are exposed to saffron extract, it causes G1/S arrest via activation
  of the p53 pathway while G2/M arrest by inhibiting CyclinB−cdk2 (cyclin-dependent
  kinases), provoking apoptosis of cancer cells. p53 also leads to increasing the
  Bax and decreasing Bcl2 expression which leads to morphological changes that contributes
  to apoptosis.
