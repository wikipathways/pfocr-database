caption: 'Probable mechanism of hydroxychloroquine (HC) against SARS-CoV-2: The figure
  depicts the mechanism of action of hydroxychloroquine targeting the SARS-CoV-2 through
  many ways. (1) The hydroxychloroquine has the ability to constrain the quinone reductase-2
  which is an essential agent required for the biosynthesis of sialic acid (SA) which
  is generally used as the receptor moieties by the SARS-CoV-2. (2) The hydroxychloroquine
  could change the pH of lysosomes that leads to inhibition of the cathepsins which
  is mandatory for the formation of autophagosomes to cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike
  (S1 and S2) protein and blocks the viral attachment to the human host receptors.
  (3) The drug also targets the virus through increasing the endosomal pH and hinders
  the glycosylation process of the cellular receptors of SARS-CoV-2, which eventually
  blocks the viral attachment to the ACE2 receptors and inhibits the viral infection.
  (4) Moreover, the hydroxychloroquine obstructs the MAP-kinase pathway which results
  to SARS-CoV-2 virus molecular crosstalk resulting into alteration of viral assembly
  and also intrude the proteolytic process of the M protein of the virus.'
