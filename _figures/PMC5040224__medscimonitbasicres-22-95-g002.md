caption: Major regulatory pathways involved in the regulation of Runx2, a chief transcriptional
  regulator of osteogenesis. Four pathways are elaborated. The Wnt pathway is central
  in activation of Runx2 via the stabilization of β-catenin. This process in cells
  other than osteoblasts is inhibited by Dickopf (DKK1/2). This inhibition is removed
  by BMP signaling via SMADs and Interleukin-11. BMP has other, direct actions on
  Runx2. TGF-β and Notch signaling is anti-calcific. TGF signal is transmitted into
  the cell by SMADs (other subsets than BMPs), while Notch relies on the cleavage
  of its intracellular domain upon activation. Arrows show activation and stump-ends
  show inhibition.
