caption: Multiple pathways that mediate pyroptosis. Various factors can activate the
  inflammasome to trigger pyroptosis. (1) Non‐pathogen stimulating factors such as
  hyperlipidaemia/hyperglycaemia activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through danger‐associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs). NLRP3 interacts with ASC through an N‐terminal PYD domain,
  which then recruits pro–caspase‐1, promoting the maturation and release of IL‐1β
  and IL‐18. (2) Pathogen‐stimulated activation of PRRs, such TLR4, activates NF‐κB,
  leading to the transcription and translation of NLRP3 and then triggers pyroptosis.
  (3) The AIM2 inflammasome can directly bind double‐stranded DNA (dsDNA) via its
  HIN200 domain. Binding of dsDNA, leads to AIM2 oligomerization and the recruitment
  of the adaptor ASC via PYD‐PYD interactions. Once activated, the inflammasomes act
  as platforms to trigger caspase‐1 expression and the subsequent release of cytokines
  and pyroptosis. (4) Upon activation of the pyrin inflammasome, pyrin responds to
  disturbances in cytoplasmic homeostasis caused by infections, and the subsequent
  inactivation of the RhoA GTPase leads to pyrin activation, inflammasome assembly
  and pyroptotic cell death. (5) Oxidative stress‐induced phagocytosis of particles
  or live pathogens leads to lysosome rupture, releasing cathepsin B (CSTB), which
  facilitates the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC, thereby inducing pyroptosis.
  (6) The adipokine visfatin activates the NLRP3 inflammasome to trigger inflammasome
  activation directly or indirectly through an uncharacterized pathway, especially
  in obesity‐related diseases
