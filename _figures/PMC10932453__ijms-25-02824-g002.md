caption: Schematic diagram of non-coding RNAs in the host response to M. gallisepticum
  infection. Upward arrows indicate an increase in the expression of miRNAs, while
  downward arrows denote a decrease in their expression. After M. gallisepticum infection,
  host cells inhibit M. gallisepticum replication, for example, by regulating the
  expression of miRNAs (e.g., miR-181a-5p, miR-21, and miR-130b-3p) to promote cell
  proliferation, inhibit cell apoptosis, and enhance the expression of inflammatory
  cytokines. In addition, M. gallisepticum can regulate miRNAs (e.g., miR-223, miR-365-3p,
  miR-193a, and miR-142-3p) to promote self-replication. In the early stage of M.
  gallisepticum infection in cells, gga-miR-365-3p was upregulated and activated the
  JAK/STAT signaling pathway to suppress the expression of pMGA1.2. At the later stage
  of infection, gga-miR-365-3p was downregulated through a negative feedback mechanism,
  thereby promoting mycoplasma adhesion or invasion
