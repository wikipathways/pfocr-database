caption: Overview of the GPR126/ADGRG6 and ways to activate Gs and Gi signaling pathways
  through it. (A) The N terminus of GPR126 contains the CUB (pink eclipse), a pentraxin
  domain (Pent, purple square) and the Sperm protein, Enterokinase and Agrin (SEA)
  domain (blue polygon), including the furin site (dotted line). The highly conserved
  GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain (turquois rectangle) contains the GPCR
  proteolysis site (GPS) at which the receptor is cleaved into an N-terminal fragment
  (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF). The CTF harbors the Stachel sequence (S,
  green rectangle) at its extracellular portion. (B) GPR126 can signal through Gs
  protein by stimulation with either Stachel-sequence-derived peptides (pGPR126),
  small molecule apomorphine, anti-HA antibody (anti-HA ab) targeting an N-terminal
  inserted HA tag or through its ligands collagen IV, prion protein (PrPc) or laminin
  211 in combination with mechanical forces. The small molecules progesterone and
  17OHP, but also pGPR126, activate GPR126 via the Gi signaling pathway. Figure was
