caption: The role of VEGF in angiogenesis-osteogenesis coupling during intramembranous
  ossification-mediated bone repair. Intramembranous bone formation relies on coupling
  of angiogenesis and osteogenesis, and VEGF has an essential role in this process.
  Stimulated by hypoxia during inflammation, osteoblasts release factors, including
  VEGF via the HIF-1α pathway. VEGF can act through its receptors on endothelial cells
  to induce angiogenesis, thereby increasing the supply of oxygen and nutrients required
  for osteogenesis. Increased vascularization may also lead to influx of skeletal
  stem cells and/or (pre)osteoblasts and to elevated levels of endothelium-derived
  osteogenic growth factors, such as BMP2 or BMP4, and anabolic signals to further
  promote osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. Maturating osteoblasts also
  generate angiogenic factors, including PDGF and VEGF. During bone repair, physiological
  levels of VEGF are critical for the outcome. Too little VEGF may interrupt communication
  between bone and blood vessels, resulting in a compromised bone healing. Too much
  VEGF has detrimental effects on bone repair, likely due to inhibition of osteoblastic
  maturation and mineralization via stimulated VEGFR2 signaling, and/or caused by
  recruitment of osteoclasts that resorb the newly formed bone. (Modified from the
  supplemental Figure 14 in J Clin Invest. 2016;126(2):509-526.)
