caption: Glutamate excitotoxicity leads to neuronal necrosis and apoptosis. Increased
  extracellular glutamate levels lead to overactivation of NMDARs and induce Ca2+
  influx. Ca2+ influx increases nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Through this
  enzyme, NO can react with superoxide radicals to generate ONOO–, thus causing serious
  oxidative damage to cellular contents. In addition, mitochondria are damaged by
  oxidation, leading to ATP depletion and cellular death. Excessive activation of
  extrasynaptic NMDARs leads to reduced CREB signaling, resulting in mitochondrial
  membrane-potential loss and cell death, while synaptic NMDARs affect the CREB pathway
  but do not induce apoptosis.

  description: Glutamate excitotoxicity leads to neuronal necrosis and apoptosis.
    Increased extracellular glutamate levels lead to overactivation of NMDARs and
    induce Ca2+ influx. Ca2+ influx increases nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity.
    Through this enzyme, NO can react with superoxide radicals to generate ONOO–,
    thus causing serious oxidative damage to cellular contents. In addition, mitochondria
    are damaged by oxidation, leading to ATP depletion and cellular death. Excessive
    activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs leads to reduced CREB signaling, resulting
