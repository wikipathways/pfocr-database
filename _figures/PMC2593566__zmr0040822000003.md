caption: The JAK/STAT signaling pathway and SARS-CoV. The JAK/STAT pathway responds
  to type I IFN secreted from neighboring cells. The IFN-α/β receptor binds to either
  IFN-α or -β and signals to the Jak1 or TYK1 kinase. These kinases phosphorylate
  both STAT1 and STAT2. This phosphorylation induces the complex formation of STAT1/STAT2/IRF9
  (the ISGF3 complex) and targets the complex to the nucleus with the help of the
  import factors KPNA1 (Kα1) and KPNB1 (Kβ1). Once in the nucleus, the complex turns
  on genes containing an ISRE in their promoter. SARS-CoV proteins have been shown
  to affect this pathway. NSP1 reduces the levels of Jak1 in the cytoplasm and affects
  it kinase activity. ORF6 blocks the nuclear import of ISGF3 by reducing the free
  Kβ1 in the cytoplasm and retaining it on the ER/Golgi membrane.
