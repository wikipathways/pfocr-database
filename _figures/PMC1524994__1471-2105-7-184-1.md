caption: 'Scheme of the modelled pathways and ranges used for generation of the in
  silico GEPs. Our model includes the core of the glycolytic pathway and the first
  step of the pentose phosphate pathway, It also accounts for the synthesis of glycogen,
  trehalose and glycerol. Glcout: Extracellular Glucose; Glcin: Intracellular Glucose;
  G6P: Glucose-6-phosphate; F16P: Fructose-1,6-biphosphate; PEP: Phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PYR: Pyruvate; HXT: Hexose transporters (HXT1–4, HXT6–8, HXT12); GLK: Glucokinase/Hexokinase
  (GLK1, HXK1, HXK2); PFK: Phosphofructokinase (PFK1, PFK2); TDH: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (TDH1, TDH2, TDH3); PYK: Pyruvate kynase (PYK1, PYK2); GLY: Production
  glycogen; TPS: Trehalose 6-phosphate syntase complex (TPS1, TPS2, TPS3); G6PDH:
  Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (ZWF1). Range of fold changes expression explored
  in the simulations: (a) Gene allowed to increase its expression by up to ten times
  its basal level; 10 uniformly spaced samples. (b) Gene allowed increasing its expression
  by up to nineteen times its basal level; 13 uniformly spaced samples (c) Gene expression
  allowed to change between ¼ and four times the basal value; 7 samples taken, at
  levels of expression that are 4×, 3×, 2×, 1×, 1/2×, 1/3× and 1/4× that of its basal
  level. (d) Gene allowed increasing its expression by up to eight times its basal
  level; 8 uniformly spaced samples.'
