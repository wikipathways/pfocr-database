caption: 'A simplified diagram of the link between glycolysis and the pentose phosphate
  pathway. The pentose phosphate pathway is linked to glycolysis through glucose 6-phosphate;
  if it is oxidized, it enters the pentose phosphate pathway, whereas if it is isomerized
  to fructose-6-phosphate, it continues through glycolysis. Inhibiting glycolysis
  through alterations in the activity of TPI or GAPDH redirects the metabolic flux
  towards the pentose phosphate pathway and generation of NADPH. Abbreviations: 6PG,
  6-phosphogluconate; 6PGDH, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; G6PDH, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; P, phosphate; R5P, ribulose 5-phosphate; TPI, triosephosphate isomerase.'
