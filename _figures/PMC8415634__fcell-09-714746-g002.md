caption: 'Wnt secretion pathway. Anterograde route of Wnt secretion (black arrows):
  Newly synthesized Wnt proteins are transferred to the lumen of RER where they are
  palmitoylated by an acyltransferase (Porcupine). This is followed by the binding
  of lipid-modified Wnts to their cargo receptor, Evenness interrupted (Evi). The
  Wnt-Evi complex is then transported from ER to Golgi by Sec22/COP-II vesicles, aided
  by various members of the P24 family of proteins, Sec12 and Sar1 proteins. Golgi
  to membrane transport of Wnt protein is mediated by Rab8a and a multi-protein exocyst
  complex further mediates the apical release of Wnts from the polarized epithelial
  cells. Wnt proteins can also be internalized and the internalized Wnts are either
  recycled and secreted apically via Rab4 endosomes (green arrows) or transcytosed
  (red arrow) to the basolateral side of the producing cell via an E3 ubiquitin ligase
  (Godzilla). The kinesin motor Klp98A is also involved in apical to basolateral transcytosis
  of Wnts. Retrograde route of Evi trafficking (Blue arrows): The Wnt-unbound Evi
  is transported back to the Golgi and RER with the help of retromer complex/SNX3
  and COP-I vesicle, respectively. In the absence of the retromer function, Evi is
  degraded in the lysosomes.'
