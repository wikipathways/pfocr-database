caption: Model of the function of CTTNBP2 at dendritic spines. A, Protein–protein
  interactions of CTTNBP2 and cortactin and the potential regulatory signals of actin
  cytoskeleton dynamics. Cortactin interacts with the Arp2/3 complex through its N-terminal
  region and binds F-actin via the middle repeat domains. The C-terminal SH3 domain
  of cortactin is the binding site for CTTNBP2. Src and ERK phosphorylation of cortactin
  influences the activity of cortactin. In addition to directly binding to the F-actin
  cytoskeleton, cortactin may also regulate F-actin branching through the Rac1-IRSp53-WAVE
  pathway. CTTNBP2NL, a molecule sharing similarity with CTTNBP2, associates with
  the PP2A protein complex, which contains PP2A, striatins, Mob3, and FAM40A/B. Striatins
  are highly enriched at dendritic spines (), and the Mob protein family has been
  shown to regulate synapse formation in Drosophila (). FAM40A and FAM40B have recently
  been shown to modulate the actin cytoskeleton (). It is unclear whether CTTNBP2
  also associates with the PP2A complex in neurons; if so, the PP2A complex likely
  dephosphorylates the cortactin–CTTNBP2 complex and regulates F-actin dynamics. B,
  CTTNBP2 regulates cortactin distribution at dendritic spines and thus maintains
  spine structure. The presence of CTTNBP2 targets cortactin to the dendritic spines.
  When CTTNBP2 is knocked down, cortactin is not efficiently targeted to dendritic
  spines, leading to shrinkage of the spines. When cortactin is overexpressed in CTTNBP2
  knock-down neurons, the ectopic distribution of cortactin into the dendritic spines
  maintains the spine structure and rescues the defects caused by CTTNBP2 knockdown.
  Thus far, it is unclear what mechanism or molecule anchors CTTNBP2 at the dendritic
  spines.
