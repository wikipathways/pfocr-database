caption: Rho-kinase inhibition activates AMPKα2 via LKB1 pathway with a resultant
  increase in energy consumption and improvement of metabolic disorders (e.g. hypertension,
  obesity and hyperlipidemia). Although Rho-kinase inhibition also improves insulin
  tolerance, this might not be mediated by AMPK activation, at least in the present
  study.
