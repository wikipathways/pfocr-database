caption: MUC1-C transduces cell membrane-associated signaling to mitochondria and
  the nucleus. (A) Activated MUC1-C homodimers that form complexes with RTKs, such
  as EGFR, at the cell membrane are internalized by endocytic trafficking. Intracellular
  MUC1-C homodimers are transported by HSP70/HSP90 to the mitochondrial outer membrane,
  where they block BAX, activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and cell death.
  MUC1-C homodimers are imported to the nucleus by interactions with importin-β and
  nucleoproteins at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex. Figure modified
  from Kufe (). (B) In the nucleus, the MUC1-C CQC motif interacts directly with the
  TCF4 E-tail and the SAGNGGSSLS region binds to β-catenin Arm repeats to form a MUC1-C/TCF4/β-catenin
  complex that activates CCND1 and MYC, and expression of their target genes (,).
  Nuclear MUC1-C also interacts with effectors that promote the repression of TSGs
  ().
