caption: Limitations of CD28-based CAR-T cells in cancer therapy. CD28-based CAR-T
  cells tend to induce higher levels of cytokine release, triggering CRS and neurotoxicity
  in patients. In addition, the signaling pathway activated by CD28 leads to reprogramming
  CAR-T to the glycolysis pathway, which promotes the differentiation of CAR-T to
  effector T cells and reduces the proportion of memory T cells. This results in poor
  anti-tumor activity, insufficient persistence in vivo, and ineffective resistance
  to tumor recurrence
