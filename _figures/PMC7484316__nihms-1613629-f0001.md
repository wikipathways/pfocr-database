caption: A) Schematic illustration of multi-layers of L-EES, including the nanomembrane
  Au electrode, encapsulating polyimide (PI), elastomer, and a strain-limiting fabric.
  Inset shows the enlarged view of a stretchable single electrode design. B) Photo
  of a fabricated L-EES, gently placed on the skin (forearm). Inset captures the zoomed-in
  view of a portion of a single electrode in the array. C) Illustration showing the
  experimental setup to use the L-EES for recording EMG and H-reflex on the forearm.
  D) Diagram representing the two neuron, one synapse pathway composed of the Ia sensory
  afferent and the α-motoneuron. This pathway can also be influenced by descending
  signals from the brain. E) Representative EMG response following transcutaneous
  electrical stimulation of the median nerve. A stimulation artifact is evident at
  the same time as the stimulation, followed by the direct muscle response (M-wave)
  and then the H-reflex. F) Flow chart illustrating the pathway of the signals involved
  in the recording of the H-reflex (red boxes) and M-wave (blue boxes).
