caption: Radiotherapy (RT) causes DNA damage, and DDR inhibitors selectively mediate
  G2 checkpoint inhibition, allowing cells with unrepaired DNA to prematurely enter
  into mitosis, ultimately leading to mitotic catastrophe. DNA damage induces the
  release of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules. For example, HMGB1
  is released into the extracellular environment and then mediates potent pro-inflammatory
  effects by binding to its downstream receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLR)
  and receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) to stimulate efficient
  processing and cross-presentation of tumor antigens from dying cells. Naive T cells
  differentiate into tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in response to type I interferon
  (IFN), leading to activation of anti-tumor immune responses and increased immunogenic
  cell death. On the other hand, DDR inhibition and mitotic death contribute to the
  formation of micronuclei, which is detected by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and
  stimulate production of type I IFN as well as other inflammatory cytokines via the
  STING pathway, thereby triggering anti-tumor immune responses by CD8+ T cells. For
  the nomenclature of early cell death, regulated cell death, immunogenic cell death
  and mitotic catastrophe, please see the review by Galluzzi et al. [].
