caption: Simplified diagram depicting two major aspects of Pph metabolism predicted
  to be occurring within AWF media based on metabolic footprinting data. In the first
  pathway, extracellular hydrolysis of sucrose by apoplastic invertases (Inv) provides
  the substrate for the periplasmic conversion of glucose to gluconate by membrane
  localized glucose dehydrogenase (Gcd) which in turn energizes the bacterial electron
  transport chain. Gluconate may be further oxidized to 2‐ketogluconate. The uptake
  of glucose, gluconate and 2‐ketogluconate provides substrates for the Entner–Doudoroff
  pathway. In the second pathway, uptake of preferred dicarboxylic acids provides
  the major carbon and nitrogen sources for the rapidly growing Pph populations. The
  excretion of pyruvate and 2‐oxoglutarate could represent metabolic endpoints which
  are because of the regulation of TCA cycle and associated enzymes; e.?g. possible
  inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdc) and 2‐oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
  complexes. Transamination reactions from glutamate to create other amino acids would
  contribute to the production of 2‐oxoglutarate (not shown). The extracellular accumulation
  of pyruvate, 2‐oxoglutarate and gluconate appeared to be under the control of catabolite
  repression by the preferred dicarboxylic acids as indicated by dashed lines.
