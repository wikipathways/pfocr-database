caption: 'Canonical microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis pathway: miRNAs are initially transcribed
  as long, variable-length hairpin RNA substrates called primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs)
  directly off the DNA template in the nucleus by RNA polymerase II (A). In the nucleus,
  these pri-miRNAs are again processed by the Microprocessor, a large complex that
  includes the RNase type III enzyme called Drosha and the RNA binding protein DGCR8,
  into ~70- to 120-nucleotide-long premature (pre) hairpin precursor forms called
  pre-miRNAs (A). The pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm by exportin 5
  (B), where the loop region of the pre-miRNA is cleaved by the RNAse type III enzyme
  called Dicer into ~18- to 23-nucleotide-long mature miRNAs (C). A cellular protein
  called transactivation response RNA binding protein (TRBP) (D) facilitates the entry
  of the Dicer-miRNA complex into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that contains
  Argonaute 2 (Ago2), protein kinase RNA activator (PACT), trinucleotide repeat-containing
  gene 6A (TNRC6A), and other RNA binding proteins (E). After incorporation of the
  mature miRNAs into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), the “passenger” strand
  is degraded, and the “guide” strand is guided to the 3′ UTR of the target messenger
  RNA (mRNA) to either degrade (in case of perfect base complementarity) or bring
  about translational inhibition (in case of multiple sequence mismatches between
  the target mRNA and the miRNA) (F). Mounting evidence suggests that transcripts
  bound by miRNA-incorporated Ago2 are channeled into structures called P-bodies,
  resulting in translational repression (G). (Loosely adapted and redrawn from Yeung
