caption: Glycolytic Metabolism. Enzymes and metabolites are depicted as well as some
  of the pathways that branch off from glycolysis and are discussed in the text. Green
  arrows indicate irreversible reactions. The final steps occurring under aerobic
  (aerobic glycolysis) or anaerobic conditions (anaerobic glycolysis) are indicated.
