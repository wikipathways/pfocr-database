caption: The MRN complex and the DNA-damage response. (A) Domain structure of MRE11,
  RAD50 and NBS1 proteins. (B) Model of intermolecular interaction of the MRN complex
  within the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, illustrating the initial steps of
  DDR including exogenous insult (lightning symbol) and the recruitment of MRN complex
  to the site of DSB by interactions with γ-H2AX (black arrow). See text for details.
  CXXC, zinc hook; FHA, Forkhead associated domain; BRCT, BRAC1 carboxyl terminus
  domain; γ-H2AX, the phosphorylated form of H2AX; PARP1, Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase
  1; MDC1, mediator of DNA Damage Checkpoint 1.
