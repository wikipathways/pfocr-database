caption: 'Schematic representation of the downstream targets of the MVA pathway, depicting
  its various intermediates (blue), end products (green) and functional implications
  (yellow). Prenylation of RhoA with GGPP anchors RhoA to the plasma membrane, where
  it can be activated by signalling factors. Active RhoA activates ROCK, which triggers
  activation and translocation of SRF into the nucleus, where it represses the transcription
  of IL‐33. Inhibitors used in this study are depicted in red: statins inhibit HMG‐CoA‐reductase;
  BPs inhibit GPP synthase and FPP synthase; perillic acid inhibits protein prenylation;
  latrunculin B prevents SRF activation; Y‐27632 is a ROCK inhibitor. The RhoA activator
  U‐46619 is depicted in green'
