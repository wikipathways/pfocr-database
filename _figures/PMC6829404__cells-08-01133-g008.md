caption: Model for leptin-induced EMT via Src and FAK signaling pathways. Leptin activates
  FAK and Src in a positive feedback pathway, which in turn regulate the expression
  and subcellular localization of β-catenin and Twist, promoting the expression of
  MMP-2 and MMP-9 as well as EMT-related events such as invadopodia formation and
  cell invasion. ? indicates an unknown mechanism.
