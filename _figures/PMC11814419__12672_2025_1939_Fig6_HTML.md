caption: Schematic for the mechanism by which PGAM1 functions to promote the malignant
  phenotypes of BC via the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. PGAM1 inhibits GSK3β and
  activates β-Catenin expression; the active β-Catenin modulates target gene expression
  through relocating into the nucleus and binding to the promoters of proliferation-
  and migration-related genes. The Figure was created by BioRender (https://www.biorender.com/)
