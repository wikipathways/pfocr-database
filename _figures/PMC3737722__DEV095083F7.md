caption: Model of cell-surface regulation of HH signaling. In the absence of HH ligands
  (top panel), PTCH1 represses SMO activity (LIA). At the onset of HH signaling (middle
  panel), HH binding to PTCH1 and to the obligate HH co-receptors GAS1, CDON and BOC
  results in de-repression of SMO function and initiation of a signal transduction
  cascade that culminates in GLI-mediated modulation of transcriptional targets. This
  initiates a negative-feedback mechanism at the cell surface that includes the downregulation
  of Gas1, Cdon and Boc, and upregulation of Ptch1, Ptch2 and Hhip1. PTCH1, PTCH2
  and HHIP1 binding to HH ligands (bottom panel) competes with productive ligand-receptor
  interactions to alter the balance between bound and unbound PTCH1, resulting in
  cell-autonomous modulation of SMO activity. Additionally, ligand sequestration by
  cell-surface HH antagonists results in non-cell autonomous HH pathway inhibition
  in cells distal to the HH source (LDA).
