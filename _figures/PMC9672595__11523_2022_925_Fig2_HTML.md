caption: Involvement of the PC MDT along the patient journey. The patient journey
  in PC consists of 4 core steps (initial presentation, diagnosis and staging, treatment
  decision, and follow-up and monitoring). With rapidly evolving diagnostic and treatment
  landscapes, MDTs play central roles in addressing challenges and controversies related
  to the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of the disease. These challenges include
  deciding on which diagnostic tests to complete, interpreting the results of novel
  genetic testing and imaging, choosing an appropriate course of action when results
  from novel tests conflict with conventional risk factors, and selecting among multiple
  medically reasonable treatment options. Typical members of a PC MDT include urologists,
  med oncs, rad oncs, nurses, and radiologists/NMPs; however, composition of the MDT
  can vary be center and the extent of disease. Additionally, nuclear medicine specialists,
  pathologists, genetic counselors, and molecular testing experts will play increasingly
  prominent roles in current and future practice. aThe treatment decision and follow-up
  and monitoring steps can be part of a repetitive cycle if a patient’s disease is
  progressing and/or failing to respond to multiple therapies. bVarying involvement.
