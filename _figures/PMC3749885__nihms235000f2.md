caption: Pim kinase targets and their roles in inflammation and cancer. Pim kinases
  phosphorylate a number of substrates such as histone H3 and c-Myc, which activate
  Myc-driven transcription. Apoptotic protein targets of Pim kinases include pro-apoptotic
  Bad protein, and Bad phosphorylation allows binding with scaffold protein 14-3-3
  and the inhibition of apoptosis. In the inflammatory response, Pim phosphorylation
  of various targets results in stabilization of SOCS proteins, which leads to cytokine
  pathway signaling. Cell cycle (p21, p27, cdc25a and cdc25c) protein phosphorylation
  removes cell cycle checkpoints and induces proliferation. Cap-dependent protein
  translation is increased by phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, a Pim kinase target. Collectively,
  phosphorylation of these Pim kinase targets results in increased transcription,
  protein synthesis, inflammatory response, cell survival and proliferation.
