caption: 'From metabolism to epigenetic remodeling. (a) SIRT1 activity depends on
  the NAD+/NADH ratio modulated by glycolysis, while O-linked N-acetylglucosamine
  transferase uses GlcNAc produced by the hexosamine pathway. Pyruvate entering the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle produces alpha-ketoglutarate, a critical cofactor
  for Jumonji domain-containing histone demethylase and TET. Acetyl-CoA is converted
  from the citrate generated by the TCA cycle and used as a donor by histone acetyltransferases.
  Finally, the increase in ATP/ADP ratio from the TCA cycle also inactivates AMPK.
  (b) SAM acts as a methyl donor for histone methyltransferases and TET and is obtained
  through the coordinate action of the folate and methionine cycles, termed one-carbon
  metabolism. αKG: Alpha-ketoglutarate; AMPK: 5′ AMP–activated protein kinase; ADP:
