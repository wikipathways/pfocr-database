caption: (a) The figure shows the consensus tree of liposarcoma subtypes. The tree
  is rooted with expression data of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), and expression
  data of normal fat cells is included as well. The differentiation pathway from hMSC
  to normal fat cells is represented in purple. The pink points represent common ancestors
  of (sets of) subtypes. The boxed numbers specify bootstrap values of branches. The
  tree indicates that dedifferentiated liposarcoma is most similar to stem cells,
  followed by pleomorphic, myxoid, round-cell, and finally well-differentiated liposarcoma.
  (b) The figure shows a schematic representation of the correlation of adipogenesis
  to liposarcoma differentiation. In , human mesenchymal stem cells were differentiated
  in vitro to produce fat cells, and gene expression was measured for five different
  time points during the differentiation. The expression data of four different liposarcoma
  subtypes was then compared to the data obtained from the differentiation time course.
  This comparison identified dedifferentiated liposarcoma as the subtype most similar
  to stem cells, followed by pleomorphic, myxoid/round-cell, and well-differentiated
  liposarcoma. The correspondence between the results of our algorithm applied to
  gene expression datasets and these experimentally derived results serves as a validation
  of our methodology. Adapted from .
