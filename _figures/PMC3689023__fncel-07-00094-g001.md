caption: Contrast of normal and pathogenic APP protein processing pathways. (A) Normal
  pathway. APP protein (green) is processed by secretases (violet) and usually cleaved
  at the α-secretase site by ADAM10 or ADAM17 (α), then afterwards by the γ-secretase
  complex (γ). This produces sAPPα, the non-pathogenic p3 peptide product, and the
  APP intracellular domain (AICD). The sAPPα product is both neuroprotective and activates
  microglia. These balanced processes, under normal conditions, lead to neural pruning
  and normal development at appropriate times. This is the majority APP processing
  pathway. (B) APP anabolic dysfunction of the α-secretase pathway, specifically anabolic
  proteins/peptide levels, processes, and outcomes indicated in yellow. Overproduction
  of APP and/or excess α-secretase activity results in overproduction of sAPPα, which
  both activates neuroglia and is neuroprotective. Neuroprotective activity would
  presumably overwhelm microglial activation, since other molecules, presumably not
  also over-produced in this scenario, also activate microglia during neural pruning
  and would not be able to make up the difference to overwhelm additional sAPPα neuroprotection.
  The net result would bring about neuronal overgrowth and risk for autism. (C) The
  “catabolic”/neurodegenerative amyloidogenic β-secretase pathway, specifically catabolic
  protein/peptide levels, processes, and outcomes indicated in red. This pathway is
  associated with neurodegeneration and Alzheimer’s disease. Possible increase in
  APP protein and BACE1 protein levels (β) result in greater cleavage at the β-secretase
  and then by γ-secretase complex (γ). This produces sAPPβ, pathogenic/neurotoxic
  Aβ peptide, and AICD. sAPPβ activates microglia without offering neuroprotection.
  Thus, two of the three major products of the β-secretase pathway are neurodegenerative.
  If the β-secretase pathway becomes excessive, risk for Alzheimer’s disease increases.

  description: Contrast of normal and pathogenic APP protein processing pathways.
    (A) Normal pathway. APP protein (green) is processed by secretases (violet) and

    and activates microglia. These balanced processes, under normal conditions, lead
    to neural pruning and normal development at appropriate times. This is the majority
    APP processing pathway. (B) APP anabolic dysfunction of the α-secretase pathway,
    specifically anabolic proteins/peptide levels, processes, and outcomes indicated
