caption: The composition and activation of Notch signaling pathway. The main components
  of the Notch signaling pathway include Notch ligands, Notch receptors, DNA-binding
  proteins, and downstream target genes. Mammals possess four membrane-bound Notch
  receptors, namely, Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4. In mammals, Notch receptors
  are activated by three delta-like ligands (DLL1, DLL3, and DLL4) and two Serrate/Jagged
  ligands (JAG1 and JAG2). Notch signaling is the activation effect of close contact
  between two adjacent cells, including canonical pathway and non-canonical pathway.
  Notch receptors are first produced in the endoplasmic reticulum and then transferred
  to Golgi for S1 cleavage. Notch receptors were cleaved into two fragments, NECD
  and TMD. These fragments are then transported to the surface of the cell membrane,
  where they interact with transmembrane ligands on neighboring signaling cells. Binding
  triggers ADAM cleavage, followed by S2 cleavage of the Notch receptor by ADAM. The
  cleaved portion is cleaved by the γ-secretory enzyme S3 on the cell membrane. This
  then leads to the release of NICD. In the classical pathway, the activated NICD
  is transported to the nucleus and binds to the transcription factor CSL, thereby
  regulating the expression of downstream genes. Some NICD that does not enter the
  nucleus can combine with other molecular pathways. The protein structure of the
  Notch ligand and receptor is shown in the upper right corner. NECD, extracellular
  domain; NICD, intracellular domain; ADAM, A protein containing a domain of disintegrin
  and metalloproteinases; γ-secretase, a membrane-bound protease responsible for S3
  cleavage of Notch; NRR, a region of negative regulation; CSL,CBF1/RBPJ-kappa/Su(H)/Lag1;TAD,
  a transcriptional transactivation domain; PEST, a domain that contains high levels
  of proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine residues
