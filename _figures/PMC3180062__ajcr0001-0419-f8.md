caption: Schematic Model of apoptotic signaling induced by targeting EphA2 gene by
  siRNA in MMC. The extrinsic pathway is initiated with FADD activation which affects
  caspase-8 activity. The activated caspase-8 cleaves Bid to t-Bid which transloactes
  to the mitochon-drial compartment that indicates the onset of intrinsic pathway.
  The various intermediate molecules studied were listed in the diagram. Cyto-c =
  cytochrome-c; casp-8 = caspase-8; casp-9 = caspase-9; casp-3 = caspase-3; Apaf-1
  = apoptotic activating factor -1. Arrows indicates activation, and inverted ‘T’
  sign indicate inhibition.
