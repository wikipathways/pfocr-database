caption: Mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapy against EGFR and mutated BRAF.
  Intrinsic resistance to EGFR blockade by panitumumab (Pani) and cetuximab (Cetu)
  occurs in case of activating mutations in the EGFR and its downstream effectors
  such as RAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA and when there is loss of PTEN either due to truncation
  or deletion. Acquired resistance stems from stimulation of collateral pathways impinging
  on the same downstream signaling activated by EGFR (i.e., the RAS/MAPK and the PIK3/AKT
  pathways). Hyperactivation of these pathways may be due to overexpression or mutation
  of ERBB2, heterodimerization of ERBB2 and ERBB3, engagement of the EGFR by TGFA
  which in turn activates MET, MET overexpression, EPHA2 overexpression, or IGF1R
  engagement. Strategies to overcome the insensitivity to EGFR blockade are directed
  at the inhibition of the collateral signaling such as using ERBB2 blocking agents
  trastuzumab (Trast) and lapatinib (Lapa) and the MET inhibitors crizotinib (Crizo)
  and capmatinib (Cap). Resistance to the mutated BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (Vemu)
  originates from the shifting in the choice of the dimerization companion. In the
  resistant cells instead of mutated BRAF homodimers, mutated BRAF/CRAF heterodimers
  are formed which are insensitive to the inhibitor and thus MAPK activation is refueled.
  To prevent hetodimerization a novel inhibitor, that specifically bind mutated BRAF
  homodimers has been developed. Another route of escape to mutant BRAF blockade has
  been described where activation of the WNT/β-catenin signaling is triggered via
  FAK. Both MAPK and β-catenin signaling eventually activate a series of transcription
  factors (TFs) responsible for the transcription of proliferative genes. Currently,
  to prevent resistance to BRAF inhibition, a vertical blockade of the pathway is
  being tested in clinical trials using vemurafenib in combination with a MEK inhibitor
  such as cobimetinib (Cobi) or trametinib (Trame). Mutated proteins are indicated
  by the red stars and the italicized name.
