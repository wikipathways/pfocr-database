caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of JNK1 and JNK2 in obesity-driven insulin resistance.
  The JNK1/2 kinases were proposed to play a central role in obesity-driven insulin
  resistance by four mechanisms: (A) In insulin-target cells, JNK1/2 directly phosphorylate
  IRS1 and IRS2 at serine and threonine residues leading to reduced tyrosine-phosphorylation
  of IRS1/2 molecules and decreased recruitment of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway
  in response to insulin. (B) JNK1/2 play a major role in obesity-driven macrophage
  activation, leading to increased levels of inflammatory “M1” cytokines driving insulin
  resistance. (C) During obesity JNK1/2 activity in pituitary thyrotropic cells sustains
  the expression of DIO2 leading to a T3-dependent reduction of TSH production. Reduced
  TSH level leads to low circulating levels of thyroid hormone, increased metabolic
  efficiency, and increased adiposity, which drives insulin resistance. (D) During
  obesity, JNK1/2 activity in the hepatocyte sustains the expression of the transcription
  co-repressor NCor1, which inhibits PPARα-driven gene-expression leading to reduced
  FGF21 production, reduced fatty acid oxidation, and ketogenesis, promoting fatty
  liver and insulin resistance.'
