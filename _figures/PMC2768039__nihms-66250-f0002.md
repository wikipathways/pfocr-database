caption: 'Molecular targeting of the VHL pathway in clear cell renal carcinoma: Mutation
  of the VHL gene in clear cell kidney cancer results in increased accumulation of
  HIF and the resulting increase in transcription of downstream targets such as VEGF,
  Glut-1, and TGFα (A). Mutation of the VHL gene in the α domain (demonstrated here)
  inhibits binding to elongin C and formation of the VHL complex.[] Mutations in other
  parts of the gene, such as the β domain, prevents binding to and ubiquitin mediated
  degradation of HIF.[] Potential disease-specific therapeutic approaches include
  agents which block the function of HIF (B), VEGFR, or EGFR (C). (From LINEHAN WM,
  ZBAR B: Focus on kidney cancer. Cancer cell (2004) 6(3):223-228.)[]'
