caption: 'Ser Biosynthesis Pathways in Plants.Ser can be synthesized by two major
  pathways: the PS pathway and the photorespiration pathway. The PS pathway starts
  with the oxidation of 3-PGA catalyzed by PGDH, yielding 3-PHP and reduced NADH.
  Phosphoserine (PSer) is synthesized by the transfer of an amino group from Glu to
  3-PHP by PSAT. Finally, PS is dephosphorylated to Ser by PSP. Photorespiratory Ser
  biosynthesis starts with the synthesis of 2-PG by the oxygenase activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
  carboxylase/oxygenase. 2-PG is converted to Gly by several enzymatic reactions occurring
  in chloroplasts and peroxisomes. In mitochondria, Ser is synthesized from two molecules
  of Gly catalyzed by the GDC and SHMT. GDC catalyzes the decarboxylation of Gly by
  releasing CO2 and NH3, yielding one molecule of 5,10-CH2-THF. Finally, Ser is synthesized
  by the transfer of the methyl group of 5,10-CH2-THF to an additional molecule of
  Gly, catalyzed by the SHMT enzyme.'
