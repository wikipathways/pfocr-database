caption: The role of androgens/AR in acne formation/progression. Acne formation in
  human results from excessive sebum formation and is usually accompanied by excessive
  inflammation and infections in the hair follicle. Macrophages and neutrophils are
  recruited to the inflamed follicles and secrete cytokines and other mediators to
  promote the inflammation and infection clearance. However the inflammatory response
  also damages the normal tissues in the follicles. AR can promote the inflammatory
  response mediated by macrophages and neutrophils, and androgens/AR can also directly
  promote sebum production that plugs the follicle pore. The IGF-1/FOXO1 pathway can
  enhance AR activity and subsequently promote sebum production. Current treatments
  for acne include antibiotics for infection clearance and therefore reducing the
  subsequent inflammation. Some antibiotics (eg. tetracycline) possess both antimicrobial
  and anti-inflammatory effects. Retinoid (and its derivatives, eg. isotretinoin)
  suppresses sebum production and promotes extrusion of the plugged material in the
  follicles. Antiandrogens reduce androgen levels, and AR degradation enhancers (ADEs)
  directly target AR to regulate the AR-mediated activities during acne formation/progression,
  such as reducing sebum production and suppressing the function of macrophages and
  neutrophils to dampen the inflammatory response.
