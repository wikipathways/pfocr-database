caption: Anthracyclines contribute to multiple biological processes that stimulate
  senescence. Anthracyclines can inhibit the enzymatic function of topoisomerase leading
  to irreversible DNA damage (1) and through DNA intercalation induce DNA damage independent
  of topoisomerase (2). Moreover, the quinone structure of anthracyclines can be oxidized
  to a semiquinone radical through the addition of an electron. Semiquinone radicals
  quickly react with oxygen to generate ROS causing DNA damage (3). DNA damage within
  the genomic or telomeric chromosomal regions leads to activation of the DNA damage
  response pathway, which if persistent contributes to phosphorylation of the key
  senescence regulator p53 (4). Phosphorylated p53 inhibits PGC-1a attenuating mitochondrial
  biogenesis (5). Reduced mitochondrial biogenesis in combination with anthracycline-mediated
  mitochondrial DNA damage (6) leads to an accumulation of mitochondrial dysfunction
  and increased ROS generation, contributing to additional DNA damage (7). Mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeability (MOMP) is also increased in dysfunctional mitochondria
  allowing the release of caspase-activating cytochrome C; if insufficient to induce
  apoptosis, the sub-lethal activation of caspase will cause further DNA damage (8).
  Recently, it has also been suggested that anthracyclines can cause biogenetic lesions
  to the electron transport chain (), further contributing to increased ROS (9).
