caption: Skeletogenic cell gene regulatory network (GRN). Shown is a model of the
  GRN experimentally established in Lytechinus variegatus. It is very similar to the
  skeletogenic cell GRN established for Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (). In the Biotapestry
  diagram shown, specification begins in the micromeres at fourth cleavage (embryo
  to upper left). Genes are depicted as horizontal lines and their activities are
  depicted as lines with arrows (activators) or blocks (repressors) on the other genes
  in the network. The genes are drawn from top to bottom based on time of first expression
  as seen by in situ hybridization and/or QPCR, with approximate times in hours. Post
  fertilization times provided on the right side of the diagram.Activities directed
  downward advance the GRN while activities directed upward provide feedback in the
  system. At about 9hpf EMT begins and at the same time the skeletogenic cells begin
  to differentiate. The model shows the collective group of transcription factors
  that activate expression of a number of known differentiation genes, and separately,
  those transcription factors that control each of the EMT component activities. Thick
  lines represent activities that have been confirmed or established experimentally
  in L. variegatus. Thin lines are drawn where genes are present in L. variegatus,
  but the connections have been established only for S. purpuratus. Several genes
  are missing from the Lytechinus model that are in the S. purpuratus GRN model. Those
  genes are present but not expressed in the L. variegatus skeletogenic cells. Two
  genes are in L. variegatus model are not present in, or yet found, in S. purpuratus.
  Ubiq are assumed ubiquitously expressed drivers of genes where no other activator
  has been discovered. Mat are maternal inputs of early expressed genes. Circles represent
  formation of complexes or activities along a signal transduction pathway. Slashes
  represent intercellular signal transmission. Delta and Wnt8 are produced by the
  early skeletogenic cells. These signals act on the macromeres and their progeny
  as modeled in . From . Sub-circuits of a gene regulatory network control a developmental
  epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Development, 141, 1503–1513.
