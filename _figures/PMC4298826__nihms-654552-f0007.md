caption: ABA has dual roles in controlling lateral root growth in Arabidopsis. ABA
  exposure promotes periods of quiescence and growth recovery in post-emergence lateral
  roots. The inhibitory effect of ABA on lateral root growth is mediated by the core
  ABA signaling pathway through the PYL receptors, PP2C co-receptors, and SnRK2 protein
  kinases. PYL8 has a previously undescribed function in accelerating lateral root
  growth during the recovery phase through activating MYB77. PYL8 directly interacts
  with MYB77 and enhances the activity of MYB77 to up-regulate the expression of multiple
  auxin-responsive genes at the time when lateral roots enter the recovery phase.
  MYB77 forms heterodimers with ARF7 and promotes the transcription of ARF7 target
  genes. At high concentrations of auxin, Aux/IAA is degraded by transport inhibitor
  response 1 (TIR1)– and auxin signaling F-box (AFB)–mediated ubiquitination to release
  the inhibition on the ARFs and induce auxin-responsive gene expression, bypassing
  PYL8.

  description: ABA has dual roles in controlling lateral root growth in Arabidopsis.
    ABA exposure promotes periods of quiescence and growth recovery in post-emergence
    lateral roots. The inhibitory effect of ABA on lateral root growth is mediated
    by the core ABA signaling pathway through the PYL receptors, PP2C co-receptors,
    and SnRK2 protein kinases. PYL8 has a previously undescribed function in accelerating
    lateral root growth during the recovery phase through activating MYB77. PYL8 directly
    interacts with MYB77 and enhances the activity of MYB77 to up-regulate the expression
    of multiple auxin-responsive genes at the time when lateral roots enter the recovery
    phase. MYB77 forms heterodimers with ARF7 and promotes the transcription of ARF7
    target genes. At high concentrations of auxin, Aux/IAA is degraded by transport
    inhibitor response 1 (TIR1)– and auxin signaling F-box (AFB)–mediated ubiquitination
    to release the inhibition on the ARFs and induce auxin-responsive gene expression,
    bypassing PYL8.
