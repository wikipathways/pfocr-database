caption: (A) Schematic of stem cross section. In dicots such as Arabidopsis the phloem
  (red) and xylem (blue) form concentric rings near the surface of the plant. Procambial
  stem cells (purple) are located between them. (B) Longitudinal schematic of phloem,
  procambial, and xylem cells. The TDIF peptide is made in the phloem and acts non–cell
  autonomously on the PXY receptor-expressing procambial stem cells. The asymmetric
  signal from TDIF on PXY acts to orient cell division longitudinally such that daughter
  cells are long and slender and such that stem cell descendants are pushed either
  outward toward phloem or inward toward the xylem, thus maintaining the organization
  of these tissues. TDIF, acting through PXY, suppresses xylem differentiation and
  promotes cell division. Increasing the rate of cell division requires the WOX4 transcription
  factor. (C) The TDIF signal acts on PXY to activate WOX4, to promote cell division.
  The TDIF effects on the orientation of cell division and on the suppression of xylem
  differentiation do not go through WOX4. In this model, TDIF/PXY also represses ethylene
  production and thus the alternative branch of the pathway. In the absence of the
  PXY protein, ethylene levels are increased resulting in an increase in ERF109, ERF018,
  and AtERF1 levels and stimulation of cell division.
