caption: The visible model is an excerpt of the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes) FoxO signaling pathway in humans as appears after importing in bStyle.
  The 2 screenshots show the parameterizations for 2 different selected objects that
  bStyle highlights with an orange border. (A) Transforming growth factor receptor
  (TGF-βR) on the cytomembrane is selected and the toolbar presents its configurable
  details. New subclassification user interface levels are available from the toolbar
  to fulfill user’s need for fine-grained properties. In this case, the click sequence
  of the user was “Modifications” in toolbar, “Modification” in the selection list,
  and then “Phosphorylation” from a complete list of possible covalent protein modification
  statuses. (B) The TGF-β signaling pathway, that KEGG simplifies to a horizontal
  cascade arrow, is presented accordingly in the model and in its counterpart toolbar
  representation, showing the intervention of SMAD4 to result in SMAD3.
