caption: Roles of Nrf2 in FLD. Mitochondria in NAFLD is impaired, leading to overproduction
  of ROS which triggers lipid peroxidation. The generated ROS and lipid peroxidation
  products will further damage the function of the respiratory chain, resulting in
  a vicious circle. ROS also activates Nrf2 to compound antioxidant proteins, alleviating
  NAFLD. Expression of Nrf2 is much higher in the livers of mice which fed with high-fat
  diet than those fed with normal chow. However, the accumulation of Nrf2 is inhibited
  when the intake of Met and Tyr is restricted in high-fat feeding mice. CDDO-Im,
  DMF, curcumin and ginkgolide B can alleviate NAFLD through activating Nrf2. Aucubin
  stimulates Nrf2 to compound HO-1 and SOD, alleviating NAFLD. Alcohol is metabolized
  to acetaldehyde in liver cells by alcohol dehydrogenase and CYP2E1. Acetaldehyde
  can destroy mitochondria, resulting in the production of ROS. ROS activates Nrf2
  to alleviate ALD. SFN stimulates Nrf2 to compound HMOX1, NQO1 and GSTM3 for alleviating
  NAFLD. The up-regulation of Nrf2 was observed in knockout SNX10 mice. And SOD was
  compounded to alleviate ALD. ALD, alcoholic liver disease; CYP2E1, cytochrome P450
