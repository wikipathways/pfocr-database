caption: Proposed model of ethanol repression in K. phaffii. Cell surface sensor proteins
  KpWsc1 and KpWsc3, interacting with KpRom2, sense the extracellular concentration
  of methanol and transmit a signal to the intranuclear transcription factors (TFs),
  Mit1, Prm1, and Mxr1, via an uncharacterized signaling pathway, activating TFs that
  regulate the expression of methanol-inducible genes (left, broken arrows),,,. The
  expression of methanol-inducible genes is repressed when methanol and ethanol are
  both present (ethanol repression). Acetyl-CoA, a downstream metabolite of ethanol,
  synthesized by the gene products of KpADH2, KpALD4, KpACS1 and KpACS2 (right, bold
  gray arrows) regulates ethanol repression in a manner distinct from the Wsc proteins-mediated
  expression of methanol-inducible genes. Acetyl-CoA may be utilized for acetylation
  of histones or other TFs that repress the expression of methanol-inducible genes
  (middle, solid thin arrows). KpAcs1 may supply acetyl-CoA to these proteins through
  interaction with the N-terminal region. In addition, Mxr1 is inactivated by phosphorylation
  at S215 through an unknown ethanol-sensing pathway. Thus, acetyl-CoA synthesis and
  Mxr1 regulate ethanol repression in a synergistic manner.

  description: Proposed model of ethanol repression in K. phaffii. Cell surface sensor

    The expression of methanol-inducible genes is repressed when methanol and ethanol
