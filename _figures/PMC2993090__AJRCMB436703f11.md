caption: 'Model of tracheal contractility regulation by NMDA-R1. Pathway in red: binding
  of glutamate (Glut) to NMDA-R1 expressed by SMCs increases intracellular calcium
  and induces the synthesis of NO by the overlying epithelium (EpC). NO promotes SM
  relaxation. Pathway in blue: binding of tPA or uPA (PA) to the NMDA-R1 increases
  intracellular calcium and overrides the inhibitory effect of epithelial NOS and
  stimulates contractility.'
