caption: Schematic of the hypothetical molecular mechanisms underlying the protective
  effects of carnosine against neuronal death induced by Zn. Zn and Cu are stored
  in presynaptic vesicles and secreted to the synaptic clefts during ischemia. Excess
  amounts of secreted Zn can translocate into cells and induce disruption of Ca2+
  homeostasis, energy failure in mitochondria, ER stress and oxidative stress, and
  apoptotic neuronal death. Co-exposure to Cu2+ enhances these effects. These pathways
  are inhibited by Zn chelators (Ca-EDTA and o-phenanthroline (o-phe)), Ca2+ channel
  blockers (Al3+ and nimodipine), energy substrates (pyruvate (Pyr) and citrate (Cit)),
  and the inhibitor of the ER stress pathway (dantrolene (Dant)) or the inhibitor
  the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway (SP600125), antioxidants (HSA-Trx), or carnosine
  (CAR). Carnosine is synthesized in glial cells and is secreted in response to stimulation
  by glutamate and Zn. It protects neurons from Zn neurotoxicity. Carnosine inhibits
  the ER stress-related apoptotic pathways and the ROS pathway.
