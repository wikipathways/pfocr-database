caption: D2 receptor-mediated ERK activation signaling pathway. D2 receptor-mediated
  ERK activation is dependent on Gαi protein coupling. It also appears that D2 receptor-mediated
  ERK activation requires the transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinase, which consequently
  activates downstream signaling involving matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) with ectodomain
  shedding of EGFR ligand, for example, to finally activate ERK (; ; ; ). The involvement
  of arrestin has also been suggested to contribute to D2 receptor-mediated ERK activation
  (; ), which can activate MAPK signaling by mobilizing clathrin-mediated endocytosis
  in a β-arrestin/dynamin-dependent manner ().
