caption: 'Mechanisms of RNA methylation in the development of muscle and fat in livestock.
  In myocytes, FTO increases the stability and expression of GADD45B mRNA by reducing
  the degree of m6A modification, thereby activating the p38MAPK pathway and promoting
  myoblast differentiation. METTL3, on the other hand, promotes the differentiation
  of goat skeletal muscle satellite cells by upregulating m6A levels and enhancing
  the expression of MEF2C. In adipocytes, FTO modulates the JAK2-STAT3-C/EBPβ signaling
  pathway through demethylation, which promotes the differentiation of porcine preadipocytes.
  The overexpression of FTO can also significantly increase the content of triacylglycerol
  (TG) in cells. Furthermore, FTO promotes the proliferation and differentiation of
  chicken preadipocytes by regulating the expression of CTNNB1. Silencing FTO significantly
  reduces the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, inhibiting the proliferation of porcine
  intramuscular preadipocytes. It may also be involved in the differentiation of porcine
  intramuscular preadipocytes through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In porcine BMSCs,
  the absence of METTL3 increases the stability of JAK1 mRNA, activating C/EBPβ through
  the JAK1-STAT5 signaling pathway, thereby inducing the differentiation of BMSCs
  into adipocytes. Red and blue dots represent states of hypermethylation and hypomethylation,
  respectively. Dashed lines represent potential regulatory mechanisms. Symbols: ↑
  indicates upregulation; ↓ indicates downregulation'
