caption: Signaling via the ALX/FPR2 receptor. The ALX/FPR2 receptor is the most extensively
  studied of the SPM receptors and is known to bind lipid and protein ligands. Lipid
  agonists include lipoxins and resolvins, whereas peptide ligands include serum amyloid
  A (SAA), annexin A1 (ANXA1), and ANXA1-derived peptide Ac2-26. SAA and LXA4 each
  serves as an agonist for the ALX/FPR2 receptor, but each can antagonize the signaling
  of the other through allosteric inhibition, promoting opposite intracellular effects,
  as shown above. Binding of monomers, homodimers, and heterodimers evokes different
  downstream signaling cascades (). Red lines represent inhibition, and black arrows
  represent activation of a pathway. Signaling schematic was adapted from Filep et
  al. ().
