caption: Genomic and gene expression characteristics of MDMS8. A Signaling pathway
  network showing significantly up-regulated pathways in MDMS8 compared to the rest
  of the disease subgroups. B Prevalence of deletions (negative Y-axis, blue) and
  gains (positive Y-axis, red) across the genome in MDMS8 (top panel). Percentage
  of genomic losses in MDMS8 vs the rest of NDMM patients (bottom panel). C Enrichment
  scores of the Reactome DNA repair pathway in MDMS8 vs the rest (left panel) and
  Homology-dependent Recombination (HDR) pathway in MDMS8 vs the rest (right panel)
