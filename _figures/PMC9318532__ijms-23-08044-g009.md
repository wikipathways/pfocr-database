caption: 'Abiotic stress (salt and temperature) response mechanisms of the Hsf gene
  in Eucalyptus. (A) Schematic diagram of the morphology of the Eucalyptus branch.
  The diagram includes mature leaves, young leaves, phloem and xylem. These parts
  (including the roots) are the key parts of Eucalyptus in relation to abiotic stress
  perception and response. (B) Schematic diagram of the temperature stress response
  mechanism and signaling for this experiment. Low-temperature stress may lead to
  elevated levels of calcium ions and reactive oxygen species in the cytoplasm of
  the cell, which are recognized by TFs or act directly on the responding genes before
  entering the nucleus to participate in the gene expression response to cold stress.
  In the present experiment, EgHsf24 was the best performer in response to the corresponding
  stress, while high temperature caused the denaturation of proteins in the cell,
  resulting in misfolding, which led to the activation of sensory genes, thus entering
  the nucleus to cause expression in response to heat stress. EgHsf32 performed well
  in response to heat stress in this experiment. The final result was the enhancement
  of plant tolerance to temperature stress. (C) Schematic diagram of the mechanism
  of salt stress response and signaling in this experiment. Under high-salt conditions,
  the receptor module on the cell membrane induces calcium ions to enter the cell,
  and the calcium signal activates the SOS3-SOS2-SOS1 pathway, at which time SOS2
  is activated (red), thus gradually stabilizing the sodium ion concentration. The
  osmotically induced stress effect generated by the increased intracellular calcium
  ion concentration causes the accumulation of ABA in the plant body, forming two
  response pathways: (1) undergoing a series of mechanistic changes to close the plant
  stomata, which is one of the ways to cope with drought stress, and (2) undergoing
  mechanistic changes to bind with TFs, thus causing the expression of stress response
  genes and activating the corresponding cis-acting elements (such as ABRE, LTR, etc.),
  ultimately enhancing the tolerance of plants to salt stress. EgHsf4 performed well
  in response to salt stress in this experiment. CaM, Ca2+-calmodulin; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; TFs, transcription factors; SOS, salt over-sensitive; ABA, abscisic
  acid; ABRE, abscisic acid responsiveness; LTR, low-temperature responsiveness. (Adapted
