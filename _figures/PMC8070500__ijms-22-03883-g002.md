caption: JNK pathway in CNS pathologies. (A) JNK integrates a positive loop promoting
  tumour growth and neurodegeneration. GB cells extend a TM network wrapping the surrounding
  neurons, promoting glia–neuron signalling communication. TMs filaments deplete neuronal
  Wg/WNT and Egr/TNF and relocalize Frizzled 1 and Grnd to activate the JNK pathway
  in tumor cells. JNK activation leads to MMP transcription, required for tumor infiltration
  into the healthy tissue, which expands the TM network, thereby describing a positive
  feedback loop. As a result, neurons degenerate. Neurodegeneration is also reinforced
  by the JNK-Impl2-InR signal in neurons, which alters mitochondrial metabolism and
  facilitates synapse loss and neuronal death. (B) Neuronal and glial JNK mediates
  different pathways upon CNS injury. JNK activation in injured axons promotes axon
  degeneration through the activation of downstream molecules such as ATF3/Hsp27 and
  KLF9, which in turn inhibit axonal growth or members of the Bcl-2 family to trigger
  apoptosis. JNK activation in injured axons also promotes microtubule stability and
  axonal growth through Wnd/MAP3K/DLK-1 phosphorylation. JNK activation in glial cells
  upon injury is triggered by Draper, and it is required for further Draper activation,
  as well as for cell-debris removal. JNK activates MMP-1, necessary for glial infiltration
  for cell-debris clearance. This phagocytic response is necessary for axonal regeneration.
