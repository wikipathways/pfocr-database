caption: Unfolded protein response (UPR), autophagy and coronavirus (CoV) infections.
  This figure represents data obtained by using different cell models infected by
  CoV viruses mouse hepatites virus (MHV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), SARS-CoV
  or SARS-CoV-2. CoV infection begins when the viral S protein attaches to its complementary
  host receptor, allowing the virus to enter the host cells by endocytosis or direct
  fusion of the viral envelop with the host membrane. The process of SARS-CoV2 virus
  entry and uncoating (1) downregulates AMPK and reduces phosphorylation of ATG14,
  disrupting the autophagy flux, while simultaneously inhibiting mTORC1, which promotes
  autophagy. Once inside the cell, the viral positive-sense RNA is translated (2)
  and the virus induces massive rearrangement of the intracellular membrane network
  to generate double membrane vesicles (DMVs) (3). CoV-induced DMVs may originate
  from late endosomes, autophagosomes or vesicles from the early secretory pathway.
  MHV-induced autophagy was impaired in cells lacking ATG5, which displayed a deranged
  morphology of the membranes and decreased viral yield. Nonlipidated LC3 extensively
  colocalizes with DMV protein markers and downregulation of LC3 protects cells from
  CoV infection as result of defects in DMVs biogenesis. CoV replication occurs within
  DMVs and transmembrane structural proteins (S, M and E) are synthesized in the ER
  (4). Non-structural protein NSP6 from IBV, MHV and SARS-CoV are localized in the
  ER and participate in autophagosome formation via omegasomes, which could be used
  for DMV formation. Finally, new viral particles are transported to the ER-Golgi
  intermediate compartment (ERGIC) for assembly (5) and exported through secretory
  pathway in smooth-wall vesicles, which ultimately fuse with the plasma membrane
  to release the mature virus (6). A high demand for membranes for DMV formation and
  virion exocytosis contributes to ER stress. MHV activates PERK/eIF2α and IRE1 and
  target genes from these two branches are detected upon infection. Cleavage of ATF6
  can also be observed but no target genes are detected subsequently.
