caption: '(A) PARP mechanism of action: PARP enzymes are key components in base excision
  repair, a DDR pathway which deals with SSB. In case of SSB DNA damage, PARP enzymes
  attach to the damaged DNA and allow NAD+ to bind to its active site. ADP-ribose
  moieties from NAD+ are transferred to target proteins (PARylation), which recruit
  single-strand DNA repair effectors. After the DNA damage has been repaired, PARP
  autoPARylates, returning to a catalytic state of inactivation. (B) PARP inhibitor
  mechanism of action: the synthetic lethality—PARPib are a class of molecules which
  prevent SSB repair. If SSB damage cannot be repaired, the immediate consequence
  is DSB formation. In cells with a proficient HRR pathway, HRR effectors (among which
  BRCA1 and BRCA2 play a crucial role) repair DSB, allowing cell survival. In tumor
  cells with HRR deficiency treated with PARPib, concomitant inhibition of base excision
  repair and HRR lack of function cause a progressive accumulation of DNA alterations
  which ultimately leads to cell apoptosis. DDR, damaged DNA repair; DSB, double-strand
  breaks; HRR, homologous recombination repair; PARPib, PARP inhibitors; SSB, single-strand
  breaks.'
