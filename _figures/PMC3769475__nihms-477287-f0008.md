caption: Comparisons of mossy fiber structural and functional changes in female and
  male rats.A. A schematic illustrates the effects of mossy fiber transmission in
  an intact female rat when serum levels of estradiol are low, e.g., during diestrous
  1 morning. The predominant effect at rest is inhibition of pyramidal cells by GABAergic
  neurons innervated by the filamentous extensions (Fil. Ext.) of mossy fiber axons.
  BDNF is low so it would have little effect under these conditions. Higher levels
  of BDNF (in B) would enhance glutamate release (+ sign) after release from the mossy
  fiber bouton and activation of presynaptic trkB receptors.B. When serum levels of
  estradiol have peaked during the estrous cycle, i.e., mid-morning of proestrus,
  increased BDNF is present in the large boutons innervating pyramidal cells, leading
  to a greater excitatory effect of mossy fiber transmission on pyramidal cells. Sprouting
  may also occur (arrows), increasing the excitation of the pyramidal cells.C. After
  ovariectomy, BDNF content decreases and glutamatergic transmission is relatively
  weak.D. The gonadectomized male rat is similar to the intact female rat because
  BDNF levels have increased. In this condition, sprouting is known to occur, leading
  to increased excitatory effects of mossy fiber transmission on pyramidal cells of
  area CA3.
