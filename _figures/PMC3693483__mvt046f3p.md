caption: 'Model for three distinct outcomes resulting from R-Smad C-terminal and linker
  phosphorylation by Gsk3-β. Schematic of potential outcomes within a cell stimulated
  by TGF-β activating the canonical Type I receptor kinase (RI) pathway and Wnt activating
  an unconventional Frizzled/Dishevelled (Fz) pathway. Both pathways lead to R-Smad
  phosphorylation; RI phosphorylates R-Smad directly on its C-Terminus (purple P),
  while the Fz pathway stimulates the Gsk3-β kinase to phosphorylate R-Smad on its
  linker region (green P). Red and blue arrows indicate the direction of phosphate
  transfer from kinase to R-Smad. Right side: when phosphorylated by RI only, R-Smads
  move to the nucleus (black arrow) and elicit an expected outcome—TGF-β dependent
  responses. Middle: when phosphorylated by RI and Gsk3-β, R-Smads move to the proteasome
  for degradation (black arrow), an outcome that terminates TGF-β signalling. Left
  side: when phosphorylated by Gsk3-β only, R-Smads move to the nucleus and induce
  a novel outcome—the restriction of self-renewing mitosis as seen in Drosophila sensory
  organ precursor cells ().'
