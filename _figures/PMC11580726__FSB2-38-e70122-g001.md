caption: Piezo1's effects in the inflammatory process in different systems. Once pathogens
  invade epithelia, Piezo1 senses the membrane ruffle and induces Ca2+ influx to activate
  immune gene expression, the NF‐kB signaling pathway, and the secretion of ATP to
  further induce inflammation. Once the foreign antigens pass through epithelial cells,
  Piezo1 participates in the initiation of the immune response. In the innate immunity
  system, Piezo1 is associated with antigen presentation and the activation of innate
  immune cells, such as ILC3, dendritic cells, and macrophages by cytoskeleton remodeling,
  cell activation, and inflammatory cytokine release. In the adaptive immunity response,
  Piezo1 participates in the activation of both T cells and B cells and helps T‐cell
  differentiation. Furthermore, Piezo1 induces leukocyte migration, angiogenesis due
  to hemodynamic change, and lymph changes to confirm and even spread effective inflammation
