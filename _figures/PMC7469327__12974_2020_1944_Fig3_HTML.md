caption: Mechanism of action of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In the canonical pathway,
  the priming step involves the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular pattern
  (PAMP) or a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) by a pattern recognition
  receptor (PRR) or toll-like receptor (TLR), which recruits the adaptor protein myeloid
  differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) into the receptor complex leading to
  phosphorylation of the inhibitor of nuclear factor-kB (NFκB) IκB through interaction
  with the p50 and p65 transcription factors. Activation of the NF-κB pathway causes
  the synthesis of pro-IL-1-β or pro-IL-18. NLRP3 is activated by lysosomal-mediated
  cathepsin B via lysosome rupture, reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidized mitochondrial
  (Mt) DNA, altered Ca2+ concentration via mitochondrial dysfunction, and adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP) efflux and potassium (K+) via pannexin1 (Panx1) channels. High
  extracellular ATP acts as a DAMP and binds to the purinergic receptor, P2X7 causing
  additional K+ efflux. Activation of NLRP3 involves oligomerization that results
  in activation of caspase-1 that converts pro-IL1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature
  forms. In addition, active caspase-1 cleaves Gasdermin D (GSDMD) into an N-terminus
  domain (GSDMD-N) and the autoinhibitory C-terminus domain (GSDMD-C). GSDMD-N binds
  to acidic phospholipids in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and oligomerizes
  to form pores that disrupt plasma membrane integrity, enabling release of IL-1β
  and IL-18 and inducing pyroptosis. The non-canonical pathway is activated by gram-negative
  bacteria or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to activate caspase 4/5 in humans or caspase-11
  in rodents that cleave GSDMD. The transient receptor protein channel 1 (TRPC1),
  a non-selective ion channel is also a substrate for caspase-11
