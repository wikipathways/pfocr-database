caption: Scheme summarizing the protective effects of UTI on LPS-induced RAW264.7
  cells. Ulinastatin (UTI) treatment effectively suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory
  injury. This is largely dependent on the suppression of LPS-activated JNK phosphorylation
  at Thr183, thereby inhibiting IκBα down-regulation and the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  In addition, UTI performed its role in anti-inflammation through ROS suppression,
  which mainly relies on the upregulation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidation pathway
  by promoting p62-associated Keap1 degradation and the PI3K/Akt pathway. Meanwhile,
  the JNK signaling pathway is not involved in mediating the Nrf2 pathway.
