caption: 'APP and BACE are sorted through the TGN–cell surface–endosome network. The
  coat complex, clathrin, controls the transport from both the cell surface and the
  TGN to the endosome (solid black arrows). The retromer instead controls the reverse
  transport from the endosome to the TGN (dashed arrow). APP and BACE interact within
  the endosomal system, representing the first step of the amyloidogenic pathway.
  SORL1 modulates the sorting of APP. When SORL1 is absent, APP holoprotein is switched
  away from the recycling pathway through the retromer but is instead directed into
  the β-secretase cleavage pathway (white arrow), thereby increasing APP''s Aβ production.
  Subsequently, APP enters the γ-secretase cleavage pathway to generate Aβ.BACE: β-secretase;
  TGN: Trans-Golgi network.'
