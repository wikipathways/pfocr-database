caption: 'Cell-contact-dependent signaling and paracrine activation of the EGF receptor
  are coupled under hypoxia to promote invadopodia formation in pancreatic cancer
  cells.Notes: In pancreatic cancer cells, hypoxia promotes HIF-1α-dependent activation
  of the Notch signaling pathway, which mediates cell-contact-dependent signaling
  upon binding of a transmembrane ligand to a transmembrane receptor expressed in
  adjacent cells. Upon ligand binding, the receptor is cleaved by proteolysis to release
  a Notch intracellular domain (NIC) that travels to the nucleus (N) and partners
  with HIF-1α to promote gene transcription. Activation of Notch signaling under hypoxia
  promotes protease-dependent shedding of the EGF receptor ligand HB-EGF (red). Upon
  shedding, the transmembrane HB-EGF becomes soluble and signals in autocrine, juxtacrine,
  or paracrine fashions. Activation of the EGF receptor by soluble HB-EGF promotes
  invadopodia (depicted in orange) formation and increases cancer cell invasiveness.
