caption: The main mechanisms by which taurine protects the retina to reduce visual
  fatigue. Taurine protects photoreceptor cells, RGC and EPE cells from damage caused
  by oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and ocular neurotoxicity through various
  pathways (reducing adverse effects or promoting beneficial effects), thereby reducing
  visual fatigue.
