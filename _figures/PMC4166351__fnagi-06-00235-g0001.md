caption: Schematic representation of Aβ production and removal from the brain. The
  proteolytic processing of the large, transmembrane, APP occurs in two distinct amyloidogenic
  and non-amyloidogenic pathways. The amyloidogenic pathway involves the sequential
  cleavage of APP by an aspartic proteinase, β-secretase, which releases a soluble
  ectodomain (sAPPβ) and the C-terminal fragment CTF99. This, in turn, is cleaved
  by another aspartic proteinase, γ-secretase, generating the transcriptional regulator
  APP intracellular domain (AICD), and releasing the 39-42 amino acid amyloid-β peptide
  (Aβ). Due to its very high ability for aggregation, Aβ forms dimers, trimers and
  higher level oligomers which are toxic to cells and cause neuronal death. Formation
  of amyloid plaques from Aβ aggregates in complex with other proteins is a hallmark
  of AD but is considered as a scavenging process. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway
  APP molecules are cleaved at the α-secretase site within the Aβ-domain releasing
  a soluble ectodomain sAPPα and the C-terminal fragment CTF83. Proteolytic cleavage
  of CTF83 by γ-secretase releases AICD and p3 fragment whose functions are still
  unknown. The AICD fragment produced in the amyloidogenic pathway binds to a stabilizing
  factor Fe65 and in a complex with other factors (the histone acetyl transferase,
  Tip60, and a Mediator complex subunit Med12) can act as a transcription enhancer
  regulating expression of a variety of genes, including the Aβ-degrading enzyme neprilysin
  and clearance protein transthyretin (TTR). This process was found to be specific
  to the neuronal APP695 isoform. AICD produced in the non-amyloidogenic pathway and
  from other APP isoforms (APP751 and APP770) is most likely degraded (by some intracellular
  proteases, e.g., insulin-degrading enzyme and caspases). Soluble APP ectodomains,
  sAPPα and sAPPβ, have been shown to have neuroprotective properties.

  description: Schematic representation of Aβ production and removal from the brain.
    The proteolytic processing of the large, transmembrane, APP occurs in two distinct
