caption: cAMP intracellular signaling pathways in target cells of Treg suppression.
  Activation of AC induced by adenosine interaction with its receptor (A2A) and/or
  influx of cAMP through gap junctions (GJ) increases cAMP concentration in Treg target
  cells. (A) cAMP-mediated suppression by Treg decreases effector responses (cytokine
  production and proliferation) in Tcon by PKA and EPAC. PKA activation in Tcon results
  in the translocation of ICER/CREM into the nucleus inhibiting NFATc1-driven transcription.
  Downstream signaling in the EPAC pathway includes the activation of the small GTPase
  RAP-1, promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. (B) In DCs, the suppression of costimulatory
  molecules expression, actin polymerization, and DC–Tcon interaction downstream of
  cAMP seems to be due to EPAC activation. Intermediate and final molecules downstream
  of PKA and RAP-1, respectively, are still unknown.
