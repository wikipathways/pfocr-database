caption: Although scalable routes to access bicyclic aldehyde (–)-2, tetrahydropyran
  (–)-3,, and dihydropyran (–)-10-epi-6, had been developed by our research group,
  the stereogenicity at C(10) in (–)-10-epi-6 required revision due to some confusion
  relating to this stereogenic center. Towards this end, we outline in  the requisite
  inversion of the C(10) stereogenic center. Global desilylation of (–)-10-epi-6,
  followed by chemoselective silylation, furnished allylic alcohol (–)-7. Initial
  attempts to invert the C(10) center with Mitsunobu methods failed due to the predominance
  of an SN2’ pathway, favored by the steric nature of the C(1)–C(8) side chain. Recourse
  was thus made to a Ley oxidation/Luche reduction sequence, which generated the desired
  allylic alcohol (+)-8 as a single diastereomer. The high selectivity can be attributed
  to the same bulky side chain. Formal transposition of the TBS group, followed by
  standard protocols to introduce the sulfone unit furnished fragment (+)-10 in good
  yield (46% for the 8 steps).
