caption: 'Lysosomes are required for antigen processing in B cells: impact of lipid-related
  disorders. (1) The interaction of the B cell receptor (BCR) with antigens tethered
  at the surface of an antigen presenting cell (APC) gives rise to an immune synapse.
  Activation of the BCR triggers signaling cascades which induce extensive remodeling
  of the actin cytoskeleton at the synaptic interface, promoting membrane extensions
  and efficient BCR-antigen internalization into late endosomal compartments. (2)
  BCR-antigen converges into lysosomes which contain the accessory molecules, such
  as GILT, H2DM, proteases and MHC class II. MHC class II molecules are associated
  with the invariant chain, which undergoes proteolysis by cathepsin S generating
  a smaller fragment called CLIP. Subsequently, the H2DM chaperone catalyzes the exit
  of CLIP and the loading of antigenic peptides into the MHC-II pocket. (3) Next,
  MHC-II molecules are transported to the surface of the B cell to be presented to
  the CD4+ T lymphocyte to promote B-T cell cooperation. We speculate that B cells
  that infiltrate the inflamed adipose and liver tissue in lipid-related disorders
  could also present lysosomal dysfunction resulting in lower cathepsin S levels or
  activity. Moreover, B cells might exhibit permeabilization of their lysosome membrane,
  similarly to observations in other cell types in lipid-related disorders. We suggest
  that in obesity there could also be an increase in the expression of CD36, which
  may be enhanced upon B cell activation. This might impact in autophagy, enhancing
  the canonical pathway and diminishing noncanonical autophagy. Such defects could
  impact the capacity of B cells to extract and process antigens, which relies on
  lysosome integrity. However, these functions remain to be evaluated and the question
  that arises is how are lysosomes in B cells affected by an excess of nutrients in
  obesity and LSDs?'
