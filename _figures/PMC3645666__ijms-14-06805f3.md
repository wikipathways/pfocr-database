caption: Examples to illustrate how changes in the partitioning of respiratory electron
  flow between cyt oxidase and AOX can act to maintain metabolic homeostasis. This
  could include homeostasis of the (a) carbon status, (b) redox status and (c) energy
  status of the plant cell. See the text (Section 3) for discussion of these examples.
