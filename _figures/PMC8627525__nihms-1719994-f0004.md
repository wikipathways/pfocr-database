caption: 'Many metabolites in glutathione metabolism and urea cycle pathways have
  significantly different expressions between ALT class: urea cycle and glutathione
  metabolism pathways linked by glutamine. Graphs of metabolite expression over time
  and between ALT class used data from subset cohort matched to associated pathway.
  *Significant metabolite determined by high leverage and low SPE in ASCA. ALT elevation,
  n = 7; No ALT elevation, n = 7.'
