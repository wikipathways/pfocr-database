caption: Schematic illustrating -adrenergic receptor signaling. Ligand binding to
  β-adrenergic receptors (β-ADRs) results in Gs-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase
  (AC) and subsequent conversion of ATP into cAMP. Intracellular cAMP activates PKA
  to phosphorylate multiple target proteins. cAMP may also activate exchange protein
  activated by adenylyl cyclase (EPAC) leading mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling
  pathway and downstream effects on cellular processes. Another pathway activated
  by β-ADRs is the PI3 kinase and protein kinase B (Akt) pathway which may be initiated
  through dissociated Gβγ complex. In addition to G protein-mediated signaling, β-ADRs
  may also participate in G protein-independent signaling through β-arrestin and MAPK.
