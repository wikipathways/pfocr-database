caption: INS-37 antagonizes DAF-2 activity and promotes DAF-16 and HLH-30 maintenance
  in the nucleus. Self-sperm also inhibits TOR signaling, which regulates HLH-30 nuclear
  localization. Seminal fluid transfer upon mating increases expression of ins-8 and
  ins-7; these agonists activate DAF-2, promoting PQM-1 nuclear localization and DAF-16
  and HLH-30 nuclear exit, resulting in premature death. INS-7 acts in a feed-forward
  loop (), further accelerating DAF-2 activation.
