caption: The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway and its related regulators, target genes
  and current therapeutic landscape. The coreceptors for HH include cell adhesion
  molecule-related/downregulated by oncogenes (CDO), brother of CDO (BOC), growth
  arrest-specific 1 (GAS1), glypican 3 (GPC3) and glypican 5 (GPC5). Wingless/Integrated
  (WNT) inhibitory factor-1 (WIF1) affects HH signaling via CDO, BOC or GPC5. The
  function of Smoothened (SMO) needs β-arrestin 2 (βArr2) and G protein-coupled receptor
  kinase 2 (GRK2). Suppressor of Fused (SUFU)/KIF7 is involved in the processing of
  glioma-associated oncogene homologue (GLI) molecules. Other negative regulators
  of GLI molecules include RAB23, protein kinase A (PKA), SUFU, sucrose non-fermenting
  5 (SNF5), cullin-3 (CUL3), p66β, β-TRCP and Itch. Patched (PTCH) is shuttled out
  of the cilium and cannot inhibit SMO in the presence of HH, and HH binding promotes
  a conformational change in SMO. However, PTCH inhibits SMO signaling independent
  of HH ligand binding. The pathways interacting with the HH pathway, including the
  transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway, epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway
  and WNT pathway, are shown in green. HH inhibitors that have been effective in treating
  gastrointestinal tumors include isoflavone,, imiquimod and 5E1. SMO inhibitors that
  have been effective in treating gastrointestinal tumors include vismodegib,,, vitamin
  D3, , , BMS-833923, TAK-441, saridegib, itraconazole, , , miR-218, , , MS-0022,
  cyclopamine,, and KAAD-cyclopamine. GLI inhibitors that have been effective in treating
  gastrointestinal tumors include curcumin, , , resveratrol,, epigallocatechin-3-gallatel,,
  arsenic trioxide, , , GANT 61, , , zerumbone, sodium arsenite and AY9944. Dark blue
  represents the type of tumor that the inhibitor is effective in. The arrows indicate
  progress. CC, colorectal cancer; GC, gastric cancer; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein;
