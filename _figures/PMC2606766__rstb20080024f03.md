caption: Sterol biosynthetic pathway, with proposed modifications for anoxic operation.
  In eukaryotes, the oxygen-dependent steps include the conversion of squalene to
  squalene epoxide, and the removal of two methyl groups on the C4 carbon and one
  on the C14 carbon (indicated by faint circles). As indicated by the faint dotted
  circles, we suggest that an ancestral anaerobic eukaryote may have directly done
  the initial cyclization reaction on squalene rather than its epoxide, in the fashion
  of many bacterial squalene–hopane cyclase (SHC) enzymes that will cyclize either
  form. The C3 hydroxyl (if it was really there in Archaean time) could be added after
  the cyclization reaction as described in the text. Similarly, a variety of demethylation
  reactions are known from sulphate-reducing organisms that could, in principle, remove
  the three methyl groups from lanosterol to form ergosterol (not shown), which is
  the simplest sterol from which eukaryotes can grow anaerobically.
