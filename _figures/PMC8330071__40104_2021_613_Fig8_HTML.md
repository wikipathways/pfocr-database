caption: TLR7/8 signalling mechanisms affect ATP production in X-sperm and Y-sperm
  of goat, respectively. In Y-sperm, mitochondrial and glycolytic ATP production occur
  regardless of the presence of R848. Thus, Y-sperm showed normal high-speed motility.
  In X-sperm, the activation of TLR7/8 localised in the sperm tail via phosphorylated
  NFκB and GSK3α/β, and via a PI3K/AKT-independent mechanism. Then suppressed the
  activity of hexokinase. As a result, ATP production in X-sperm was decreased under
  R848 condition. Thus, only X-sperm showed low-speed motility under R848 condition
