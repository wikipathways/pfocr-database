caption: a Although there are exceptions, γδ T cells generally do not express CD4
  or CD8. Therefore, SFK-mediated activation cannot be used to activate γδ T cells.
  However, the ERK pathway is activated. For the normal development of γδ T cells,
  TCR signaling is important. T10/T22 and Skint1 are well-defined antigens for γδTCR.
  T10/T22-mediated signaling induces IFNγ-producing γδ T cells, whereas the Skint1
  signaling induces DETC development. Some innate subsets of γδ T cells do not require
  TCR stimulation during development. Although several reports have demonstrated that
  innate IL-17-producing γδ T cells do not require TCR signaling, other studies have
  shown that TCR specificity or Zap70 phosphorylation is needed for full γδ T cell
  activation. b Coinhibitory molecules, including PD-1, CTLA4, and BTLA, can suppress
  γδ T cells. PD-1 and BTLA are frequently expressed by γδ T cells. However, CTLA4
  is rarely expressed on the γδ T cell surface. Costimulatory molecules such as CD28,
  CD27, and 4-1BB are needed for development or activation. CD28 is needed for advancing
  disease conditions but not its development. However, CD27 is needed for the development
  and proper expression of IFN-γ. 4-1BB is known to enhance Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. However,
  the roles and mechanisms of these and other coinhibitory/stimulatory molecules remain
  unclear. c Various cytokines induce γδ T cell differentiation, leading to different
  functions. The γδ T-cell differentiation dichotomy is mainly affected by cytokine
  signals.
