caption: A schematic overview of necroptosis in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). (a) A simplified
  illustration of the intracellular pathways involved in cell fate in a necroptotic
  CCA cell. As reported in the text, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) activates its
  receptor, TNFα receptor 1 (TNFR1), which binds a series of proteins to form complex
  I. The ubiquitylation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1
  (RIPK1) leads to cell survival, through the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway.
  When this process is impeded, and caspase-8 is active, complex IIa will assemble,
  leading to RIPK1-independent apoptosis. The deubiquitylation of RIPK1 in the presence
  of activated caspase-8 leads to the assembly of complex IIb and, subsequently, to
  RIPK1-dependent apoptosis. The inhibition of caspase-8 leads to RIPK1/receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)/mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL)
  interaction, forming complex IIc, also named the necrosome. Phosphorylated MLKL
  and RIPK3 translocate to the plasma membrane, opening membrane pores, and resulting
  in damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) release. (b) The immunogenic response
  to DAMPs. Dendritic cells, activated by DAMPs, travel to lymph nodes, mature and
  expand, and present a tumor antigens to naïve CD8+ T cells, in a process called
  cross-priming. T cells are then activated and differentiate into cytotoxic T cells
  primed to specifically attack tumor cells. (c) The morphology of a necroptotic cell.
  Translucent cytoplasm, the swelling of organelles, patches of condensed chromatin
  within the nucleus, an increased cell volume, and a disrupted cell membrane can
  be visualized by electron microscopy. Picture adopted from Vandenabeele et al. [].
