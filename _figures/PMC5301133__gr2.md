caption: Mechanistic basis of secretory regulation in a neuroendocrine cell. Initial
  transcription and processing occurs in the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  and thereafter secretory products accumulate in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Subsequently,
  they are incorporated into immature vesicles that also contain other protein products
  destined for immature secretory vesicles (ISG). Multiple ISGs fuse into a mature
  secretory granule (MSG) in a process that involves calcium (Ca2+) influx, granule
  acidification, and prohormone processing as well as amine uptake (eg, serotonin).
  This sequence of processes is directed via positive regulatory inputs from diverse
  regulatory G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (green). Ligand binding activates
  both signal pathways (PKA/cAMP, MAPK, PI3K/DAG/PKC) and membrane depolarization.
  Regulatory GPCRs are typically cell-type specific and include muscarinic, tastant,
  and trace amine receptors. Consequent upon activation MSGs are directed to the plasma
  membrane, and, after receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx, docking occurs at the cell membrane.
  This process involves the expression of a series of proteins including syntaxin
  (SY), synaptotagmin (ST), vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) (V2), and
  synaptosomal-associated protein, 25-kDa (SNAP25) (S25) (green arrowheads). The ensuing
  vesicle-and-membrane fusion process culminates in MSG release of contents into the
  extracellular milieu (exocytosis). Inhibition of secretion occurs through a number
  of GPCRs (pink) (somatostatin > muscarinic > glutamate) which upon activation reverses
  the signaling pathway initiation process through dephosphorylation of signaling
  intermediates as well as inactivation of voltage-gated channels. Red dots = secretory
  protein. IUPHAR gene symbols are included for each of the GPCRs.
