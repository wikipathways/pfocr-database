caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathways activated by AKT. Lines
  represent either direct or indirect activation (arrow head) or inactivation (blunt
  end) by AKT. Activation of cell surface growth factor receptors by ligands such
  as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor leads to the automatic
  phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in some of the receptor cells through
  their intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity. In this pathway, PI3K phosphorylates
  phosphatidylinositol (3,4) diphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate
  (PIP3). This is a key signaling intermediate for PI3K signaling.PIP 3 then induces
  AKT to form a plasma membrane target through its binding to the N-terminal PH domain
  of AKT, which changes the kinase from an inactive to an active state. AKT is then
  phosphorylated on Thr-308 and Ser-473 by PDK1 as well as ILK, respectively. Activated
  AKT mediates its multiple cellular functions by phosphorylating specific substrates
  (). PTEN is a lipid phosphatase that limits AKT activation by dephosphorylating
  PIP3 into PIP2.AKT induces a phosphorylation-dependent nucleus-cytoplasmic shuttle
  of p27, impairing its antiproliferative activity. Compared to AKT 1 (WT), the E17K
  mutant significantly increased v-Abl translational efficiency and promoted tumorigenesis;
  these events will be described in detail below.
