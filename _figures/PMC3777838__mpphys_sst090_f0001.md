caption: RAM1 and RAM2 Have Roles in Cutin Monomer Biosynthesis.Myc or Nod factors
  activate the common symbiosis pathway (CSP) to activate the GRAS transcription factors
  NSP1, NSP2, and RAM1. NSP1 and NSP2 have been shown to be involved in strigolactone
  biosynthesis (). In roots, cutin monomers produced by RAM2 promote appressorium
  formation by P. palmivora and may play an analogous role in hyphopodia formation
  by AMF. In the latter case, RAM2 expression is dependent on RAM1. In seeds, RAM2
  expression may be under developmental control and the cutin monomers produced may
  get incorporated into cutin.
