caption: A view of detailed pathway page showing GA12 biosynthesis pathway. The pathway
  page provides three layers of granularity including the most detailed format displaying
  structures of metabolites and biochemical. The GA12 biosynthesis pathway also shows
  links highlighted in green color for the preceding ent-kaurene biosynthesis pathway
  I, as well as for the successive gibberellin biosynthesis pathway I and III that
  use GA12 as substrate. On the right side, species comparison icon is highlighted
  that allows users to make comparisons of pathways across other publicly available,
  species-specific plant pathway databases; AraCyc (Zhang et al., ), MaizeCyc (Monaco
  et al., ), MedicCyc (Urbanczyk-Wochniak and Sumner, ), PoplarCyc (Zhang et al.,
  ), RiceCyc (Dharmawardhana et al., ), LycoCyc, CoffeaCyc, PotatoCyc, BrachyCyc,
  SorghumCyc, FragariaCyc (Shulaev et al., ), and EucalyptusCyc, accessible from the
  website http://pathways.cgrb.oregonstate.edu.
