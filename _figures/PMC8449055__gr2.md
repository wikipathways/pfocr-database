caption: Mechanisms of drug resistance in cancers. Oncogenic signaling pathways are
  composed of receptors (growth factor receptors such as receptor tyrosine kinases,
  “RTK”s, cytokine receptors, or G-protein-coupled receptors), kinases (“K”), effectors
  (“E”, e.g., transcription factors) that regulate oncogenic gene expression. Resistance
  to an inhibitor targeting an oncogenic kinase (indicated by the green blunt-end
  line targeting K1) can develop by () amplification or constitutively activating
  mutation of upstream receptors that ultimately increase downstream oncogenic signaling
  and output (indicated by multiple arrows) (), mutational changes in K1 that makes
  it resistant to drug binding, or activation of other isoforms of K1 (K1′) that are
  unaffected by the inhibitor (), activation of parallel pathways (such as K4/K5 signaling)
  that can be triggered by the same receptor but bypass the initial pathway (K1/K2/K3)
  targeted by the drug, or () activation of independent pathways that are unaffected
  by the drug and can achieve similar oncogenic phenotype (RTK2/K6 signaling).
