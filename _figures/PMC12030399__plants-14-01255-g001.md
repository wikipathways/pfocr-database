caption: 'Regulation of the jasmonate signaling pathway by MYC2 transcription factors.
  The dynamic regulation of the JA signaling pathway, mediated by MYC2 transcription
  factors across various stages, depicts the complex interactions among key components,
  including MYC2, MED25, and JAZ proteins. Initialization: Interaction between MYC2
  and JAZ proteins, which are characterized by NT, Jas, ZIM, and EAR domains. At this
  stage, JAZ proteins exert repressive functions through interactions with NINJA and
  TPL, effectively inhibiting MYC2 activity. Activation: Following stimulation by
  JA-Ile, MYC2 is released from JAZ-mediated repression. The F-box protein COI1 targets
  JAZ proteins for degradation, liberating MYC2 from inhibition. Subsequently, MYC2
  forms a complex with MED25, recruiting RNA polymerase II and other co-activators
  such as HAC1 to initiate transcription of JA-responsive genes. Intensification:
  MED25 facilitates the recruitment of RNA Polymerase II to promoters of JA-responsive
  genes, supported by MYC2 binding to G-box elements. Additionally, transcription
  is further enhanced by the modulation of chromatin structure, specifically through
  acetylation of Histone 3 Lysine 9 (H3K9ac), to enable more efficient transcription.
  The yellow circle indicates a chromatin-associated protein complex binding site
  where key transcriptional regulators converge at JA-responsive promoters to mediate
  dynamic chromatin remodeling and gene activation or repression'
