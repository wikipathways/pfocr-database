caption: O-GlcNAcylation and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway cross-dysregulation in
  human chronic diseases. O-GlcNAcylation dysregulation (represented by red arrows)
  modulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and promotes development of human
  chronic diseases such as cancer, T2D and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.
  In cancer, increased O-GlcNAcylation stimulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
  by up-regulating expression and activity of IRS-1, PI3K, and AKT and by inhibiting
  AMPK. mTOR enhances glucose absorption and glycolysis through stimulation of expression
  of the transcription factor HIF-1α and its target genes such as GLUTs, HK, PFK,
  and LDHA. AKT enhances cancer cell proliferation through increased cyclin D1 expression
  possibly through GSK3β inhibition. Moreover, AKT has anti-apoptotic and pro-invasion
  activities and these effects may result in the regulation of several targets including
  BAD, MMP-2, and MMP-9. In T2D, increased O-GlcNAcylation associated with hyperglycemia
  promotes insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue by inhibition
  of IRS-1/PI3K interaction and down-regulation of IRS-1 and AKT activity. AKT inhibition
  induces reduced glucose absorption through down-regulation of GLUT4 translocation
  to the plasma membrane which might be mediated by AS160. Moreover, repression of
  AKT inhibits glycogenesis and stimulates gluconeogenesis through regulation of GSK3β,
  FoxO1, and respective targets (GS, G6Pase, and PEPCK). Additionally, O-GlcNAc-mediated
  AKT inhibition induces pancreatic β cell apoptosis. In hyperglycemic or diabetic
  cardiovascular tissues, O-GlcNAcylation reduces vasodilatation vessels and angiogenesis
  via inhibition of AKT, and probably eNOS and VEGF. Enhanced O-GlcNAcylation in these
  tissues could also promote calcification and therefore vessel obstruction through
  Runx2 overexpression possibly mediated by AKT regulation of SMURF2 and/or FoxO.
  Finally, increased O-GlcNAcylation stimulates Tau and α-synuclein aggregations involved
  in AD and Parkinson's disease respectively. These processes are mediated by AKT
  inhibition and Tau kinase GSK3β activation in AD, and by mTOR activation and reduced
  autophagy in Parkinson's disease, which could result from ULK1 inhibition. Furthermore,
  O-GlcNAc-mediated AKT repression promotes neural cell apoptosis in part, by up-regulation
  of BAD.
