caption: NO triggers production of cGMP by GC-1. cGMP activates protein kinase G (PKG).
  Activated PKG can phosphorylate numerous targets with multiple downstream effects,
  including inhibition of Rho A, thus preventing inhibition of myosin phosphatase
  by Rho Kinase. In addition to inhibition of Rho A, activated PKG can directly activate
  myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP). Subsequent dephosphorylation of the regulatory
  light chain of myosin by MLCP prevents actin–myosin interaction, promoting cell
  relaxation. This in turn leads to a widening of the intercellular spaces in the
  juxtacanalicular TM and Schlemm's canal, thus facilitating conventional AqH outflow
  and relieving IOP.
