caption: 'A mechanism underlying an anti-tumor effect of lithocholic acid (LCA) in
  cultured human neuroblastoma cells. LCA is the most potent natural agonist of TGR5,
  a plasma membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptor. LCA binding to TGR5 on the cell
  surface compromises viability and/or proliferation of human neuroblastoma cells
  by triggering three different pathways. The first pathway is initiated when LCA-stimulated
  TGR5 activates the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade. The ensuing specific changes in mitochondrial
  redox processes and morphology cause an activation of mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilization (MOMP), thus triggering the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of
  apoptotic death. The second pathway leads to activation of the initiator caspase-8.
  Activated caspase-8 cleaves and stimulates both the executioner caspase-3 and BID
  (BH3-interacting domain death agonist), thus eliciting both the extrinsic (death
  receptor) and intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways of apoptotic death, respectively.
  The third pathway operates via an inhibition of the inflammatory caspase-1, thus
  slowing down the processing and secretion of the cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-18
  and, ultimately, attenuating the growth and proliferation of neighboring neuroblastoma
  cells. See the text for additional details. Abbreviations: Csp-1, -3, -6, -8 and
  -9, caspases-1, -3, -6, -8 and -9.'
