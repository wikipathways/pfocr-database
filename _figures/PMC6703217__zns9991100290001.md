caption: Model of striatal plasticity induced in glutamatergic synapses onto both
  striatonigral and striatopallidal MSN populations in response to concomitant D2
  and A2A receptor modulation. Coadministration of D2 receptor agonist [quinpirole
  (Quin)] and A2A receptor antagonist (ZM or ST) can induce sustained reduction of
  glutamate release in striatonigral and striatopallidal MSNs through at least three
  different sequences of events (white, blue, and gray numbered pathways). Postsynaptic
  modulation of D2/A2A receptors in striatopallidal neurons may reduce glutamate release
  (↓Glut) through local retrograde endocannabinoid signal (white pathway, 1–3). In
  parallel, blockade of presynaptic A2A receptors located in glutamatergic terminals
  onto cholinergic interneurons, plus stimulation of D2 receptors expressed in these
  neurons, may interrupt their firing, ultimately leading to decreased acetylcholine
  release (↓Ach, blue pathway, 1–3). The reduced stimulation of M1 receptors may remove
  the inhibition exerted on L-type Ca2+ channels, promoting calcium influx, endocannabinoid
  production, and reduced glutamate release onto both populations of MSNs (blue pathways
  4–6). Finally, blocking presynaptic A2A receptors located in glutamatergic terminals
  onto striatonigral MSNs may additionally reduce the probability of release at these
  synapses (gray pathway, 1 and 2). Note that, under this scheme, glutamatergic synapses
  onto both striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons receive at least two different
  signals that reduce release, in agreement with the equivalent decrease of glutamatergic
  transmission found by  in both MSN populations.
