caption: The top 10 genes and associated critical phenotypes network. This network
  visualization highlights the interactions between the top 10 genes with the highest
  association density and their linked phenotypic organ systems derived from analyzing
  RSPRY1-associated DEGs. Blue nodes represent the top 10 genes, including such key
  genes as SMAD3, COL1A1, and TRPV4, which are strongly associated with the TGF-β
  signaling pathway and ECM regulation. Orange nodes represent the phenotypic organ
  systems, including such critical features as eye, neck, short stature, and neurological
  phenotypes. Edges (lines) indicate the interaction or association between genes
  and phenotypic organ systems, with a denser connectivity representing a higher degree
  of association
