caption: 'Modulation of muscle protein synthesis and degradation signaling by omega
  3 fatty acids (FA). Several factors, such as insulin, amino acids, hormones, cytokines
  and growth factors can induce the activation by phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and
  MAPK pathways. This leads to the activation of mTOR, which regulates glucose and
  lipid metabolism, activates protein synthesis and inhibits protein breakdown. Mitochondrial
  function is also a regulator of muscle protein synthesis by providing ATP. Muscle
  lipotoxicity is characterized by the accumulation of ceramides and diacylglycerols
  (DG) in muscles, inducing the dysregulation of protein synthesis through the inhibition
  of the PI3K/Akt pathway and mitochondria activity. If chronically induced, these
  events can lead to a decrease in skeletal muscle mass. Supplementation with omega
  3 FA reduces lipotoxicity-induced muscle metabolism disorders. This effect is mediated
  by the increased mTOR activation by PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways and the reduction
  of ceramides and DG content in muscle. Thus, supplementation with omega 3 FA could
  improve muscle protein turnover and counteract the loss of skeletal muscle related
  to lipotoxicity. No data are currently available about the effect of omega 3 FA
  on mitochondria metabolism during RA. CPT1: Carnitine-palmitoyl transferase 1; DG:
