caption: Pattern of pocket protein pathway gene alterations in metastatic human cancer.
  (A) The schematic in  is modified to show how often (%) pocket protein pathway genes
  are genetically altered in pan-cancer genome wide DNA sequencing studies of metastatic
  solid cancers (; ) compared to primary tumors (TCGA pan-cancer). Here grey boxes
  indicate primary tumors while white boxes reflect data from metastatic tumors. The
  data from metastatic cancers does not include copy number changes, so the analysis
  is restricted to debilitating mutations. (B) As in A but focused on primary and
  metastatic prostate cancer. Data is from Abida et al. () and TCGA and calculated
  in cBioPortal ().
