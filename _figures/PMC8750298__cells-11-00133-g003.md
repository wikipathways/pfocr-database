caption: 'Cell-cell communications during barriergenesis. During embryogenesis, establishment
  of the BBB phenotype is possible through cell–cell communication processes between
  components of the NVU. Endothelial progenitors colonise the neural tube in response
  to the VEGF gradient secreted by neural progenitors, which promotes angiogenesis.
  The interaction of future BBB ECs with neurons activates several signalling pathways
  of which the most studied is the Wnt pathway. Thus, the ECs continue to proliferate,
  and the first steps of differentiation begin. Once established, future ECs meet
  BPs by secretion of PDGF; this cell–cell interaction is crucial for the differentiation
  of cells into mature BBB ECs and involves Notch and Smad-dependent signalling pathways.
  Establishment of the BBB continues until the birth and maturation of astrocytes.
