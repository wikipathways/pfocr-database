caption: HIF target genes encode proteins involved in critical aspects of cancer progression.
  The list of HIF-regulated genes (shown in red) is intended to be illustrative rather
  than comprehensive. (A) HIF target genes (locus abbreviations in parentheses) that
  promote cell immortalization, stem cell self-renewal, and autocrine growth and survival
  include those encoding adrenomedullin (ADM), endothelin 1 (EDN1), erythropoietin
  (EPO), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2),
  octamer binding protein 4 (OCT4), phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM), telomerase (TERT),
  transforming growth factor α (TGFA), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
  (B) HIF-1 target genes involved in metabolic reprogramming include glucose transporter
  1 and 3 (GLUT1, GLUT3), hexokinase 1 and 2 (HK1, HK2), glycolytic enzymes aldolase
  A (ALDOA), enolase 1 (ENO1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphofructokinase
  L (PFKL), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), and lactate
  dehydrogenase A (LDHA). The enzymatic activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is
  inhibited by PDH kinase 1 (PDK1), thereby blocking the conversion of pyruvate to
  acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) for entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Two
  members of the BCL2 family of mitochondrial proteins (BNIP3, BNIP3L) trigger mitochondrial
  selective autophagy. Lactate and hydrogen ion (H+) generated by glycolysis are effluxed
  from the cell through the activity of the monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4),
  sodium-hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1), and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CAR9). HIF-1 may also
  regulate the expression of the transketolase (TKT) and TKT-like 2 (TKTL2) enzymes
  of the non oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). (C) HIFs stimulate
  tumor vascularization by activating transcription of the genes encoding VEGF, stromal-derived
  factor 1 (SDF1), placental growth factor (PGF), platelet-derived growth factor B
  (PDGFB), and angiopoietin 1 and 2 (ANGPT1, ANGPT2). (D) HIF target genes that promote
  epithelial mesenchymal transition include inhibitor of differentiation 2 (ID2),
  snail 1 and 2 (SNAI1, SNAI2), transcription factor 3 (TCF3), TGFA, vimentin (VIM),
  and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 and 2 (ZEB1, ZEB2). (E) HIF target genes
  promoting invasion and metastasis include those encoding autocrine motility factor
  (AMF; also known as GPI), angiopoietin- like 4 (ANGPTL4), cathepsin C (CTSC), lysyl
  oxidase (LOX), LOX-like 2 and 4 (LOXL2, LOXL4), L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM),
  Met proto-oncogene/hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET), matrix metalloproteinase
  2, 9, and 14 (MMP2, MMP9, MMP14), and the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor
  (PLAUR).
