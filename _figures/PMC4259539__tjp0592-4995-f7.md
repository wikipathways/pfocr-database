caption: Decreases in cholesterol cause increases in the activity of membrane-bound
  NADPH oxidase (Nox), resulting in increased ROS production. Consequently, the amount
  of ROS is enhanced both in the extra- and in the intracellular spaces. This leads
  to stimulation of TRPV channels, thus admitting Ca2+ to the cytoplasm. The rise
  in intracellular Ca2+ may maintain spontaneous exocytosis at high levels. Ca2+ may
  activate phosphatase 2B (calcineurin, CaN), which has effects on proteins involved
  in the synaptic vesicle cycle, and may thus facilitate both recruitment of synaptic
  vesicles from pools for exocytosis and compensatory endocytosis. This pathway could
  be recruited along with others, as cholesterol depletion potentiated spontaneous
  exocytosis much less when any of the components of the NADPH oxidase–ROS–TRPV–Ca2+–calcineurin
  pathway were blocked.
