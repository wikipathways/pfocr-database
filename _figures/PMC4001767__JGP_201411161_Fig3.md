caption: Proposed mechanism whereby THC increases pregnenolone synthesis from cholesterol
  through a rapid pathway involving an increase in P450scc that depends on Erk1/2MAPK
  phosphorylation, and slower pathways involving an increase in P450scc independent
  of Erk1/2MAPK phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).
