caption: Schematic representation of inflammatory astrocytes and their interactions
  with other cells during neuroinflammation. (A) Markers upregulated in inflammatory
  astrocytes and pathways regulating their activation. While GFAP and Vimentin are
  commonly upregulated in reactive astrocytes (Sofroniew, ; Escartin et al., ), inflammatory
  astrocytes show increased expression of the NF-κB pathway (Zamanian et al., ; Lian
  et al., ) and activation of MAFG and mTOR signaling (Sofroniew, ; Zamanian et al.,
  ; Li et al., ; Wheeler et al., ). (B) Schematic overview of various known cytokine,
  chemokine, ionic, and protein interactions of inflammatory astrocytes with neighboring
  cells. Inflammatory astrocytes can affect microglia and infiltrating immune cells
  by secreting immune factors such as cytokines and chemokines (Sofroniew, ; Zamanian
  et al., ; Liddelow et al., ; Clark et al., ), complement proteins (Zamanian et al.,
  ; Lian et al., ; Liddelow et al., ), as well as extracellular matrix molecules such
  as hyaluronan (HA; Kuipers et al., ; Nagy et al., ) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans
  (CSPGs; Keough et al., ; Stephenson et al., ), and cytotoxic factors, such as nitric
  oxide (NO), adenosine triphosphate (ATP; Orellana et al., ), and mitochondrial fragments
  (Joshi et al., ). These cells can, in turn, affect astrocyte reactivity as well
  (Colombo and Farina, ; Rothhammer et al., ; Liddelow et al., ; Williams et al.,
  ; Clark et al., ). In particular, microglia have been shown to affect inflammatory
  astrocyte function (Liddelow et al., ; Yun et al., ; Joshi et al., ), while concurrently
  inflammatory astrocytes release many microglia-activating factors (Zamanian et al.,
  ; Guedes et al., ) resulting in a feed-forward loop of activation. In addition,
  microglia-astrocyte crosstalk (Matejuk and Ransohoff, ) has been implicated in driving
  disease pathology, for example through the release of chemokines/cytokines (Itoh
  et al., ) and direct protein-protein interaction through axon guidance molecules,
  such as Sema4D/PlexinB2 and EphrinB3/EphB3 (Clark et al., ). Astrocytes can also
  activate themselves in an autocrine manner through the release of cytokines (Sofroniew,
  ; Zamanian et al., ; Escartin et al., ), ATP (Sofroniew, ; Zamanian et al., ), inflammatory
  HA (Kuipers et al., ; Nagy et al., ), and certain glycolipids such as lactosylceramide
  (LacCer; Mayo et al., ).
