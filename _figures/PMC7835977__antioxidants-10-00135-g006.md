caption: The proposed mechanism by which GAT107 restores bacterial clearance in the
  lungs by reducing oxidative stress, due to hyperoxia. Under room air conditions,
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection facilitates the re-organization of the F-actin
  cytoskeleton, thereby facilitating bacterial clearance by macrophage phagocytosis.
  The exposure of macrophages to hyperoxia increases ROS levels, which overwhelms
  the antioxidant response, resulting in oxidative stress (Morrow et al., 2007; Patel
  et al., 2016). Oxidative stress oxidizes actin, altering the formation of F-actin
  and impairing the phagocytic activity involved in bacterial clearance in the lungs.
  The α7nAChR ago-PAM, GAT107, significantly restores hyperoxia-compromised phagocytic
  activity by inhibiting the oxidation of actin by attenuating the hyperoxia-induced
  decrease in SOD1 activity and the upregulating HO-1 via the Keap1/Nrf2 antioxidative
  pathway. These GAT107-mediated effects reverse the hyperoxia-induced impairment
  of macrophage phagocytosis.
