caption: Proposed Wzy-dependent biosynthetic pathway of E. coli O157 LPS. The biosynthesis
  is initiated with the formation of GlcNAc-PP-Und, which is later epimerized to GalNAc-PP-Und.
  Subsequently, the RU-PP-Und is assembled by three GTs (WbdN, WbdO and WbdP) and
  then translocated to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane by Wzx, where the
  repeating units are polymerized to form O-PS by Wzy in a block transfer mechanism
  that is regulated by Wzz. The last step includes WaaL catalyzed transfer of O-PS
  onto an individually synthesized Lipid A core structure to form the intact LPS.
