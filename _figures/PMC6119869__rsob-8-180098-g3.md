caption: The paradoxical HH pathway. SHH, secreted by tumour-associated astrocytes,
  induces nestin expression in tumour cells lacking PTCH1, through a signalling mechanism
  that requires SMO. Nestin accumulates in tumour cells and binds to GLI3, thereby
  abrogating a negative feedback loop, leading to increased HH pathway activity. Both
  the induction of GLI1 expression in the absence of PTCH1 and SHH-induced nestin
  expression require the presence of cholesterol. Statins and vismodegib synergize
  in the inhibition of HH pathway activity.
