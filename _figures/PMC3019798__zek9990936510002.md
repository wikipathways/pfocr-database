caption: Functional role of PP2C enzymes in yeast MAPK pathway regulation and organelle
  inheritance. (a) Regulation of MAPK pathways. Different S. cerevisiae and S. pombe
  pathways are depicted, indicating the triggering stimuli and the transcription factors
  involved in the response. The three layers defining the MAPK pathways are shaded
  in gray. Discontinuous lines denote suspected or still poorly characterized interactions.
  See text for details. (b) The central role of Ptc1 and the different proteins presumed
  to mediate the phosphatase function on organelle inheritance. Note that only endoplasmic
  reticulum and mitochondrial inheritances seem to require Slt2 MAPK intervention.
