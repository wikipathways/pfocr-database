caption: Mechanism of disulfidptosis regulation. (A) SLC7A11high cells exhibit a high
  cystine uptake rate, which is subsequently reduced to cysteine by NADPH. NADPH is
  primarily derived from glucose via PPP. (B) In the absence of glucose, NADPH levels
  decrease, leading to the abnormal accumulation of cystine and other disulfide bond-containing
  molecules in SLC7A11high cells. This accumulation promotes the formation of disulfide
  bonds within actin cytoskeletal proteins, ultimately resulting in the collapse of
  the actin network and initiating disulfidptosis. The Rac1-WRC-Arp2/3 pathway-mediated
  branched actin polymerization and lamellipodia formation may create a conducive
  environment for disulfide bond formation within actin proteins. PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway; Rac1, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1; WRC, WAVE regulatory
  complex; GLUT, glucose transporter; NADPH, niacinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
