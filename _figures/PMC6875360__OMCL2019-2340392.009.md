caption: 'Diagram showing the possible mechanism of iron overload-induced injury to
  VECs. Excessive free iron ions produce excess ROS in the cytoplasm. The latter results
  in biological effects in two ways: excess ROS inhibits DDAHII and accumulates ADMA.
  ADMA not only inhibits eNOS activity competitively and decreases NO synthesis but
  also induces eNOS uncoupling and produces even more ROS, thereby cycling and reciprocating
  ROS, forming one vicious cycle. In addition, excess ROS entered mitochondria, weakening
  the MMP, opening the mPTP, activating the RIRR mechanism, and forming another vicious
  circle. These two circles together induce ROS burst, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction,
  which in turn damages VECs.'
