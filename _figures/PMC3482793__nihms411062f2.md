caption: Scheme describing feedforward effects on renin secretion and renin expression
  mediated by Gsα-coupled receptors and cAMP/PKA signaling. Renin secretion is also
  controlled by angiotensin II feedback effects that negatively affect levels of JG
  cell cAMP. Solid arrows indicate direct (stimulatory) relationships, and broken
  arrows indicate inverse (inhibitory) relationships. The rectangle represents MD
  cells while the oval represents the entire population of JG cells
