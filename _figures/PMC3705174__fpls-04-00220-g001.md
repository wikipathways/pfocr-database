caption: Schematic view of the monolignol biosynthetic pathway. The synthesis of monolignols
  from phenylalanine and shikimate involves cytosolic (PAL, HCT, 4CI, CCR, CAD, CCoAOMT,
  and OMT) and ER membrane-anchored (the cytochrome P450 enzymes F5H, C3H, and C4H)
  enzymes. Monolignols and lignans may be conjugated by UGTs and then transported
  to the vacuole or directly transported to the cell wall for oxidative cross-linking
  by apoplastic peroxidases and laccases into lignins. In grasses, some hydroxycinnamic
  acids are conjugated to arabinose by BAHD enzyme for export via the Golgi apparatus
  and future incorporation into polysaccharides (pectins or arabinoxylans) whereas
  some are conjugated to monolignols (mainly sinapyl alcohol) in the cytosol and incorporated
  into lignin. Other phenolic compounds (soluble phenolic esters and amides, flavonoids)
  are shown and may indirectly interact with lignification. Their production implies
  common steps (enzymes) with the monolignol pathway. Most of these transport routes
  and storage forms still remain to be discovered and the localization of some enzymes
  (GH, Perox, Lacc) confirmed. The dashed lines delineate putative pathways and full
  lines delineate known routes. Enzymes of the monolignol pathway are represented
  by circles. The brown color indicates involvement of the enzyme in the monolignol
  pathway; yellow indicates involvement in the flavonoid pathway; and pink indicates
  involvement in the sinapate ester pathway. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H,
  cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate
