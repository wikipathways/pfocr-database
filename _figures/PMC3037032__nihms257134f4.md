caption: In humans, CpG islands are found near the promoters of 60–70 % of genes ().
  While cytosines within CpG dinucleotides are frequently methylated, in CpG islands
  cytosines are largely unmethylated. (A) A number of proteins bearing a zinc finger
  of the CXXC class preferentially bind unmethylated CpG islands. These proteins are
  associated with a variety of histone-modifying activities including the H3K4 methyltransferases,
  MLL and Set1/COMPASS, and the H3K36 demethylase, KDM2A (). MBD1 has two zinc fingers
  that bind methylated DNA and a third of the CXXC class that binds unmethylated DNA.
  MBD1 is associated with H3K9 methyltransferase activities and is thought to help
  coordinate silencing by DNA and histone methylations (). (B) A recent study demonstrated
  that CpG islands were major sites of recruitment of CXXC1 (Cfp1) and H3K4 methylation
  via mammalian COMPASS, independent of the transcriptional status of the nearby gene
  (). (C) In another recent manuscript, KDM2A, an H3K36 demethylase, was found to
  be targeted to CpG islands via its CXXC motif. Since H3K36 methylation can recruit
  histone deacetylases (), removal of H3K36 methylation in CpG islands could maintain
  CpG islands in an open, permissive state ().
