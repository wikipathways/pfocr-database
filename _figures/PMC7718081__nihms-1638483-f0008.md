caption: Schematic diagram summarizes the effects of chronic ethanol consumption on
  GLT-1, NO pathway, BDNF, and Arc expression in the AcbSh. Chronic ethanol consumption
  increases synaptic glutamate concentration mainly due to downregulation of GLT-1
  (both GLT-1a and GLT-1b isoforms) and cystine/glutamate exchanger transporter (xCT)
  expression (; ). Chronic ethanol consumption also increases NO system activity,
  BDNF-Arc expression and PSD-95. NO regulates the incorporation of postsynaptic GluA1
  subunit of AMPA receptors probably through CREB-BDNF-Arc pathway and ubiquitination
  of PSD-95. In addition, chronic ethanol exposure was associated with increases in
  the inflammatory response through upregulation of inflammatory mediators such as
  high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a receptor for advanced glycation end products
  (RAGE) and TNF-α ().
