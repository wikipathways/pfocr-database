caption: A proposed working model for the UVR8–LOX1 module promoting UV-B-induced
  stomatal closure. UV-B light promotes the accumulation of PUFAs, linoleic acid (18:2)
  and α-linolenic acid (18:3) primarily mediated by PLIP1/PLIP3, and induces the expression
  of LOX1, whose encoding enzyme catabolizes them for oxylipin production. UVR8 is
  photoactivated and monomerized to interact with LOX1, which in turn activates the
  LOX-derived oxylipin pathway through SA biosynthesis and signaling pathway and ultimately
  promotes stomatal closure. Mutating the UVR8-interacting sites of LOX1 (mutation
  of K239 and E240 in UVR8–LOX1 interacting sites to A, LOX1KEA) retains LOX1 activity
  but abolishes the interaction with UVR8, which attenuates the activation of the
  LOX-derived oxylipin pathway and UV-B-induced stomatal closure. Disruption of the
  metal-binding site (mutation of H519, H524, and H711 in metal-binding sites to Q,
  LOX1HQ) of LOX1 impairs LOX1 activity but retains its interaction with UVR8. The
  disruption of the oxygen cavity (mutation of R216 in the oxygen cavity to F, LOX1RF)
  or substrate cavity (mutation of L561 and L566 in the substrate cavity to F, LOX1LF)
  of LOX1 impairs LOX1 activity and abolishes UVR8 interaction, leading to no stomatal
  response to UV-B exposure

  description: A proposed working model for the UVR8–LOX1 module promoting UV-B-induced
