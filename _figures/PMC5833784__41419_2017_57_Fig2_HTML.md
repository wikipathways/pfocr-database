caption: Phosphorylated mixed linage kinase domain like (pMLKL) is the only known
  mediator of necroptosis and its detection defines the activation of this pathway.
  Potentially, several kinases may phosphorylate MLKL, but only receptor-interacting
  protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) has been described while this review was written. MLKL
  carries several phosphorylation sites, and RIPK3 phosphorylates the so-called “activation
  loop”. However, complete function of pMLKL requires the depohsphorylation at the
  hinge region that unleashes the deadly activity of a four-helical bundle (4-HB),
  which binds PIP2 in the plasma membrane and tends to oligomerize with other pMLKL
  molecules. Downstream of pMLKL, sensitivity of cells to undergo necroptosis is controlled
  by proteins that control membrane blebbing and microvesical formation. Unlike previously
  suggested, pMLKL does not directly form pores in the plasma membrane of cells. Full
  activation of RIPK3 requires the assembly of the necrosome, a higher order structure
  that consists of oligomerized RIPK3 molecules that are stabilized by HSP90 and CDC-37,
  two chaperones the loss of which results in defective necroptosis. Several triggers
  result in the formation of the necrosome. Death receptor (DR), for example, TNFR1-stimulation
  in the presence of a caspase inhibitor or a dysfunctional caspase-8 represents the
  most prominent and best investigated stimulus that requires RIPK1 kinase activity
  for necrosome formation. RIPK1, as RIPK3, contains a rip homotypic-interacting motif
  (RHIM)-domain that intercalates with the RHIM of RIPK3 and prevents necrosome assembly.
  Inhibitors of RIPK1 kinase activity, such as Nec-1s and ponatinib, maintain the
  inactive state of RIPK3 potentially by keeping RHIM–RHIM interactions intact. Necrosome
  assembly has been repeatedly reported downstream of Toll-like receptors that bind
  to the intracellular adapter protein TRIF, which also contains a RHIM domain and
  activation of this pathway results in robust RIPK1-independent necrosome formation.
  In vivo, reperfusion following ischemic injury severely triggers necroptosis, and
  several other models have been described, such as injection of recombinant human
  TNFα into mice. In addition, protein kinase R (PKR) and DAI, a protein that is capable
  of but functionally not limited to viral DNA sensing activation as triggered by
  interferons, can activate RIPK1-mediated necrosome formation, but the relative contribution
  of these two factors remains unclear. Certainly, DAI robustly triggeres necrosome
  formation via its RHIM domain, possibly via nuclear signalling. However, importantly,
  necroptosis contributes to acute kidney injury in some models, such as ischemia,
  but inhibition of necroptosis does not affect other models, such as foliac acid-induced
  AKI
