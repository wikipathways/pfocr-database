caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to describe functional relationships
  among miRNAs and genes based on the known associations in the databases, and some
  differentially expressed miRNA and mRNA were found to be associated with nonobstructive
  azoospermia. The value below the nodes represents fold changes of expression levels
  of miRNA or mRNA between the treated and control groups.
