caption: A schematic representation or summary of the alteration in endothelial cell
  signaling by aberrant NOSTRIN expression. Binding of TNF-α to its cognate receptor
  leads to the recruitment of several adaptor proteins and activation factors that
  in turn can activate the NFκB pathway and also promote phosphorylation of AKT. When
  NOSTRIN levels are low, free TRAF6 molecules are available to bind to TRADD and
  transduce the signal to downstream activation factors. Rapid activation of the NFκB
  pathway leads to expression of several pro-angiogenic genes along with production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are direct targets of the transcription factor
  NFκB. On the other hand, when NOSTRIN levels are very high, NOSTRIN can bind directly
  to TRAF6 and thus inhibit its binding to TRADD on TNFα stimulation. This is followed
  by suppression of NFκB activity along with inhibition of AKT phosphorylation. As
  a consequence, gene expression is inhibited, and multiple functions of endothelial
  cells required for angiogenesis are severely compromised.
