caption: Protein palmitoylation modifications are involved in regulating osteogenic
  matrix mineralization and differentiation signals. The transmembrane protein, bone-restricted
  interferon-induced transmembrane protein-like (BRIL), is palmitoylated to preferably
  bind to FKBP11 to form a complex that promotes osteogenic matrix maturation and
  mineralization, whereas 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) inhibits palmitoylation of BRIL.
  The palmitoylase ZDHHC16 modulates CREB phosphorylation by altering the extent of
  CREB palmitoylation, thereby participating in the regulation of the cAMP/PKA/CREB/ATF-1
  signalling pathway to suppress the expression of target genes. The acyl-protein
  thioesterases (APT) target and activate bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1A (BMPR1A),
  which then binds to BMPR2 and the ligand BMP2.4.7 to activate SMAD1/5/8, which binds
  to SMAD4 and enters the nucleus to activate genes such as runt-related transcription
  factor 2 (Runx2) and osterix. Diagram created with BioRender.com (Canada)
