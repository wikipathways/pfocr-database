caption: Pathway mined metabolites as visualised by MetaboViz plugin. Pathways identified
  by the Pathway Mining plugin and rendered using the included MetaViz plugin. Changes
  are visualised on a red-blue scale, showing up- and down-regulated metabolites respectively.
  Analysis shows down-regulation of TCA cycle metabolites, together with low NAD as
  an indicator of oxygen-dependent electron-transport chain failure.
