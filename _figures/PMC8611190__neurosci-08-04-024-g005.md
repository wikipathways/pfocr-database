caption: 'The methyl cycle. After the methyl group donation to a precursor molecule
  (X: DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) becomes S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH), which is usually turned into homocysteine (HCY). HCY can undergo two fates:
  in the re-methylation pathway, it is re-methylated and converted into methionine
  (precursor to SAM) in a reaction involving vitamin B12; in the trans-sulfuration
  pathway, HCY is first converted to cystathionine and then to cysteine in a reaction
  that involves vitamin B6.'
