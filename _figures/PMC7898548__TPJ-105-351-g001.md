caption: Carotenoid biosynthetic pathway and plant apocarotenoid regulatory metabolites.Geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate (GGPP) is synthesized by the GGPP SYNTHASE (GGPPS) in plastids through
  the condensation of three isopentenyl diphosphates (IPP) and one dimethylallyl diphosphate
  (DMAPP). Sequentially, two GGPP molecules are used by the PHYTOENE SYNTHASE (PSY)
  to produce 15‐cis‐phytoene, which is an important rate‐limiting step in the synthesis
  of carotenoids. Then 15‐cis‐phytoene is converted into lycopene via multiple steps
  of desaturation and isomerization catalyzed by enzymes, including PHYTOENE DESATURASE
  (PDS), ζ‐CAROTENE ISOMERASE (Z‐ISO), ζ‐CAROTENE DESATURASE (ZDS), and CAROTENOID
  ISOMERASE (CRTISO). These multiple reactions are performed by a single enzyme, CRTI,
  in non‐photosynthetic bacteria. The enzymatic activity of Z‐ISO and CRTISO can be
  partially replaced by photoisomerization in plants. Cyclization of lycopene is catalyzed
  by LYCOPENE β‐ and ɛ‐CYCLASE (LCYb and LCYe) that form the β‐ or ε‐ionone rings
  of carotenes, respectively. β‐ and α‐Carotenes are subsequently converted into their
  downstream xanthophylls, such as zeaxanthin by NON‐HEME DIIRON OXIDASE (HYD)/CYP97A,
  and lutein by the action of CYP97A and CYP97C, respectively. Then zeaxanthin and
  violaxanthin can be interconverted in each other by the action of ZEAXANTHIN EPOXIDASE
  (ZEP) and VIOLAXANTHIN DE‐EPOXIDASE (VDE). Afterwards, violaxanthin is transformed
  into neoxanthin by NEOXANTHIN SYNTHASE (NSY). Modified bonds or moieties are colored
  red. Norflurazon (NFZ) and 2‐(4‐chlorophenylthio) ethyl‐diethylammonium chloride
  (CPTA) are inhibitors of carotenoid biosynthesis, affecting the enzymes PDS, LCYb
  and LCYe. Carotenoids can be metabolized into various apocarotenoids with important
  biological functions, via different processes. Representative bioactive apocarotenoids
  are boxed with a rectangular dash box. Sun image represents photoisomerization.
