caption: 'The development of cirrhosis follows well-coordinated steps that begin with
  the etiology, leading to sustained chronic inflammation (the control or command
  center; black bubble) that activates and promotes multiple pathways (rail-pathways,
  colored lines) that feature prominent mediators of inflammation and fibrosis (central
  stations, grey bubbles) and parallel assisting pathway intermediaries (secondary
  stations, small white bubbles) that ultimately lead to the destination (red bubble).
  Therapies that target only few of the pathway mediators do not tend to improve outcomes
  as expected; however, targeting the command center (etiology) along with controlling
  the central-stations (central inflammatory and fibrosis pathways) would impede progression
  to destination (cirrhosis).Abbreviations: BMDSC, bone marrow-derived stem cells;
