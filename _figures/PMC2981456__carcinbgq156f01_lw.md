caption: The estrogen biosynthesis pathway. The pathway from cholesterol through estrogen
  synthesis and metabolism is shown with the enzymes involved. Bolded enzymes are
  those in which SNPs were investigated in relation to estrogen measures and lung
  cancer survival ().
papertitle: Serum estrogen and tumor-positive estrogen receptor-alpha are strong prognostic
  classifiers of non-small-cell lung cancer survival in both men and women.
