caption: The mechanism of NMN’s protective effect on endothelial cell barrier function
  in this study. In a hypoxic environment, ROS accumulate within endothelial cells.
  On one hand, this induces cell apoptosis; on the other hand, it leads to phosphorylation
  of the cell-cell adhesion protein VE-cadherin, decreasing cell adhesion. These two
  processes together increase the permeability of the endothelial barrier, which in
  turn causes retinal edema and neuronal damage. NMN supplementation lowers intracellular
  ROS levels, which, on one hand, reduces endothelial cell DNA oxidative damage and,
  on the other hand, inhibits the activation of the Src/Pi3k/Akt signaling pathway.
  This protects endothelial cells and their adhesion, decreases endothelial barrier
  permeability, and protects retinal tissue
