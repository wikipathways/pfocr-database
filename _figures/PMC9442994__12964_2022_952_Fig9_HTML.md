caption: Schematic model for how MICAL2 regulates E-cadherin degradation and β-catenin-mediated
  cell migration. In brief, MICAL2 was identified as a novel key molecule implicated
  in gastric cancer cell migration. MICAL2 increased E-cadherin ubiquitination and
  degradation in a Cdc42-dependent manner, thereby leading to enhanced β-catenin signaling
  via the disruption of the E-cadherin/β-catenin complex and, consequently, the promotion
  of gastric cell migration
