caption: Schematic model of TMEM132A regulation of Wnt signaling pathway within signal
  sending cells. The TMEM132A homodimer (or oligomer) interacts with the Wnt ligand
  trafficking protein WLS to increase WNT binding and WNT stabilization, and to enhance
  WNT secretion and Wnt signaling pathway activation. In the absence of TMEM132A,
  Wnt ligand becomes unstable, and WLS–Wnt ligand interaction is weakened, leading
  to repressed Wnt signaling pathway.
