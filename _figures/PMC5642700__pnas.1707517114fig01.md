caption: OS vs. PS log fold-change (LFC) data projected onto the custom pathway consisting
  of genes and mechanisms exhibiting differential response between OS vs. PS. The
  heat maps below the gene nodes show the time course of transcriptional changes,
  representing, from left to right, hours 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, and 24. (A)
  G1-to-S transition pathway. G1-to-S transition is dependent on the E2F1 activation
  through RB phosphorylation, which is facilitated in part by CDK2 (bound to cyclin
  E) and CDK4 (bound to cyclin D). The CDK proteins must be activated by interacting
  with the CDK-activating kinase. CDKs can also be inhibited by proteins such as CDKN2D.
  (B) Reconstructed pathway of oxidative stress and superoxide metabolism. Oxygen
  in the cell is converted to superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and finally water. Reactive
  oxygen species are also known to activate HIF1A, a marker of hypoxia. The metallothionein
  MT1X, which is thought to be hypoxia-responsive, is also shown. (C) AP-1 family
  of genes and the antioxidant product NQO1. (D) NF-κB and NF-κB target genes.
