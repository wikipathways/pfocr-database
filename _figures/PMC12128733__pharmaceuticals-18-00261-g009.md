caption: 'Effect of Rhodiola extracts on the eicosanoid signaling pathway. Arachidonic
  acid (AA) was released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and
  then converted to eicosanoids by two types of enzymes: (i) prostaglandin endoperoxide
  synthases (PTGS), commonly referred to as cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), catalyze
  the key step in the synthesis of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), which is converted into
  pro-inflammatory thromboxanes (TXs), prostaglandins (PGE, PGF, and PGD), and prostacyclins
  (PGI). (ii) The lipoxygenases include ALOX5, ALOX12, and ALOX15. ALOX5 catalyzes
  the key step in the conversion of AA to pro-inflammatory leukotriene A4, B4, and
  C4. ALOX12 synthesizes pro-inflammatory 12(S)-HETE [12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid]. ALOX15, in concert with ALOX5, is involved in forming anti-inflammatory lipoxins
  A4 and B4. Eicosanoid receptors belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors.
  Some of these receptors include BLT-1,-2 CYSLTR1, and CYSLTR2 for pro-inflammatory
  leukotrienes; PTGERs for prostaglandin E2; PTGFR for pro-inflammatory prostaglandin
  F2; PTGDR for prostaglandin D2; and TBXA2R for pro-inflammatory thromboxane A2.
  Eicosanoids transduce signals via their membrane receptors and mediate complex biological
  processes like inflammation, vascular permeability, allergic reactions, labor induction,
  and carcinogenesis. Downstream effect analysis reveals predicted pharmacological
  effects of Rhodiola mediated by eicosanoid signaling pathways [68]'
