caption: The cartoon schematizes some of the effects of mutant Kras in reprogramming
  amino acid metabolism. The cytoplasm of the cell has been colored in blue in the
  background to highlight the role of mutant Kras in PDAC, in pink to represent pathways
  revealed in NSCLC, in yellow when the mechanisms are common to both tumor types.
  Kras potentiates both macropinocytosis and autophagy whose vesicles end up in lysosomes,
  a compartment that is frequently found enlarged in Kras mutant cancer cells. In,
  NSCLC, in condition of low glucose, this occurs by activating AMPK that phosphorylates
  Tfe3 resulting in its nuclear translocation and transcription of lysosomal genes.
  Moreover, AMPK activation increases autophagy initiation and maturation. Breakdown
  of macromolecules in lysosomes produce free amino acids available to biosynthetic
  and energy pathways. Among them glutamine can enter the TCA cycle in mitochondria
  (depicted on the right). In PDAC glutamine is consumed through an alternative pathway
  (highlighted in red and in the box on the right). In NSCLC, mutant Kras activates
  the PI3K/AKT pathway that, in condition of low glutamine, favors mRNA expression
  of the ATF4 transcription factor via the NRF2 factor. In addition, NRF2 is also
  a key regulator of genes involved in the antioxidant response. Under condition of
  asparagine deprivation, the GCN2-eIF2 pathway prompts transduction of the ATF4 mRNA
  into protein, which, in turn, activates the transcription of amino acids transporters
  and glutamine consuming enzymes. Among them, asparagine synthetase ASNS catalyzes
  the synthesis of asparagine from glutamine. Asparagine levels and ASNS control proliferation,
  mTORC1 activation and suppress apoptosis.
