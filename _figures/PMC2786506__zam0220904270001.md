caption: Schematic representation of the engineered squalene biosynthetic pathway
  in E. coli BL21(DE3). DXS and IDI were overexpressed for the modulation of the MEP
  pathway to increase and balance the IPP pool, HopD (farnesyl diphosphate synthase)
  was overexpressed to increase FPP, and HopA and HopB (HopAB) (squalene synthases)
  were overexpressed to overproduce squalene. The recombinant enzymes overexpressed
  in E. coli are boxed.
