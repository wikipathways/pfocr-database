caption: A schematic model of the underlying mechanisms of miR-126-3p-mediated suppression
  of proliferation, migration and invasion through the PI3K/PDK1/AKT pathway. miR-126-3p
  suppresses progression of cervical cancer cells through the PI3K/PDK1/AKT signaling
  pathway. The AKT pathway is associated with proliferation of cells through its downstream
  signaling pathway including GSK3β, cyclin D1, p70S6K and S6 activation. The PDK1
  pathway is associated with migration and invasion of cells through mediators of
  its downstream signaling pathway including p70S6K, MRCKα, ROCK1, PLCγ-1 and PAK1.
