caption: 'Pyroptosis signaling pathways. Activation of every member of the non-canonical
  caspase family (caspase-4/-5/-11) via bacterial LPS initiates the non-canonical
  pyroptosis signaling pathway. The canonical signaling pathway is triggered by the
  activation of NLRP3 via PAMPs or DAMPs or by directly activating caspase1 via the
  MST1 byproduct (ROS), the main functional component of the inflammasome group. GSDM,
  the main executor of pyroptosis, is cleaved both by a canonical and non-canonical
  pathway, leading to the activation of the N-terminal domain, which results in the
  formation of pores. The other products of the canonical pathway are activated IL-1β
  and IL-18, which are released from the cell with DAMPs via GSMD-induced pores. Abbreviations:
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; DAMPs, damage-associated
  molecular patterns; NLRP3, NOD-like Receptor Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3; ROS,
  Reactive Oxygen Species; GSDM, gasdermin; IL-1β, Interleukin-1 Beta; IL-18, Interleukin-18;
