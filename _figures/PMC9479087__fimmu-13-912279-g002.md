caption: The polyamine metabolic pathway and transport way. Polyamine biosynthesis
  involves the conversion of ornithine to putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC),
  followed by the formation of spermidine via spermidine synthase (SRM) and decarboxylated
  s-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM, formed by AMD1). The aminopropyl fragment required
  for putrescine to produce spermidine was provided by dcSAM. In a similar manner,
  spermine is produced from the conversion of spermidine by spermine synthase (SMS)
  and AMD1. The polyamine catabolism process occurs through the action of amine oxidase,
  mainly polyamine oxidase (PAOX) and spermine oxidase (SMOX). PAOX and SMOX can generate
  a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the process of decomposing
  polyamines, causing oxidative damage. Currently, three models of polyamine transport
  systems have been proposed. Although the molecules involved in the polyamine transport
  system have not been fully recognized, it is known that the polyamine transport
  system is energy dependent and substrate selective. ODC antienzymes (AZs) and antizyme
  inhibitors (AZINs) also play important roles in polyamine transport. ODC monomers
  have a higher affinity for AZs. When the intracellular polyamine concentration is
  high, AZs binds to ODC monomers, preventing ODC activity and promoting the binding
  of ODC monomers to the 26S proteasome for degradation in a ubiquitin (Ub)-independent
  manner (only AZ1 induces ODC degradation). However, the binding of AZs to ODC can
  be blocked by AZINs.
