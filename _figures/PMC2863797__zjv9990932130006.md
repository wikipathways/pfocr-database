caption: Model for the regulation of miR-203 expression in differentiating normal
  and HPV-positive epithelia. miR-203 expression is increased upon differentiation
  of normal keratinocytes, leading to suppression of p63 translation in suprabasal
  cells. In HPV-infected epithelia, E7 blocks miR-203 upregulation through the MAP
  kinase pathway, leading to increased levels of p63, cells remaining active in the
  cell cycle, and HPV genome amplification. EGF, epidermal growth factor.
