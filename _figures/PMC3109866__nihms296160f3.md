caption: 'Mitochondria are known to signal to the nucleus by at least two mechanisms:
  one is the retrograde signaling pathway (RTG) that involves LST8 and possibly TOR;
  the other uses reactive oxygen species and signals through the JNK–FOXO pathway.
  AMPK also receives input from mitochondria and is yet another protein involved in
  the mitochondrial control of lifespan.'
