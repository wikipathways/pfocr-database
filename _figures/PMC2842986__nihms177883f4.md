  (1a–e, g, i–k) is shown in . Selective protection of the ketone functional group
  with ethylene glycol in the presence of BF3-OEt2, followed by LAH reduction provided
  diol 7 in a high yield. Next, selective protection of diol 7 using TBDPSCl gave
  mono-protected diol 8 in 86% yield. Then, the cyclic ketal group of 8 was readily
  cleaved using PPTS to give 9. The other hydroxyl group of 9 was protected as a MOM
  ether to give bis-protected diol 10 in a quantitative yield. Diol 10 was treated
  with Grignard reagents in the presence of CeCl3  to generate tertiary alcohols 11a–e,
  11g, 11i–k in good yields (77–99%). Selective deprotection of MOM group in 11a–g,
  11i–k, followed by an oxidation of the resulting primary alcohol using IBX and NaClO2
  provided the corresponding carboxylic acids 13a–e, 13g, 13i–k. Finally, desilylation
  of the TBDPS group in 13a–e, 13g, 13i–k coincidently led to an intramolecular cyclization
  to give the desired lactones 1a–e, 1g, 1i–k.
