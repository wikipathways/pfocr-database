caption: At the basal level, AKT phosphorylates and stabilizes BCA2 which is responsible
  for ubiquitinating protein substrates, including some signaling proteins controlling
  phosphorylation (A) and dephosphorylation (B) of pAMPK-α (at Thr-172), and target
  them for degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, resulting in inhibition of
  AMPK signaling in breast cancer cells. The activation of AMPK by metformin, however,
  increases BCA2 protein levels, inciting cancer cell survival and restarting the
  regulatory loop via PI3K/AKT. Therefore, the balance of AMPK and PI3K/AKT/BCA2 may
  control breast cancer cell sensitivity to metformin therapy and the tumor cell life-death
  switch.
