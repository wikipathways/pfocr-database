caption: Small signaling peptides-mediated stomatal movement. (A) Pathogen-derived
  flg22 induced stomatal closure and stimulated the anion channels in an OST1-dependent
  manner. Upon flg22 perception, the FLS2 receptor interacts with the coreeptor BAK1
  to activate OST1 which could phosphorylate the anion channel SLAC1 in guard cells.
  Additionally, the flg22-induced cytosolic Ca2+ elevation could activate SLAC1 and
  SLAH3. The activation of anion channels SLAC1 and SLAH3 release anions into the
  guard cell wall, thereby depolarizing the plasma membrane to induce stomatal closure.
  (B) The AtPeps-PEPR signaling pathway close stomata by activating guard cell anion
  channels SLAC1/SLAH3 in an OST1-independent manner. (C) The RALF1-FER signaling
  module mediated stomatal opening and closure through distinct pathways. All of the
  G protein subunits, except GAP1, are involved in the induction of stomatal closure
  and the inhibition of stomatal opening triggered by RALF1. RALF1-FER signaling may
  trigger cytosolic Ca2+ elevation, which induces stomatal closure. OST1 is only involved
  in the RALF1 inhibition of stomatal opening, but not in the RALF1 promotion of stomatal
  closure. (D) The CLE25 peptide-mediated root-to-shoot signaling stimulated the stomatal
  closure under dehydration stress. Dehydration stress induces CLE25 expression in
  roots. The resultant synthesized peptide is transported to the leaves, where it
  binds BAM1/BAM3 and subsequently stimulates ABA accumulation through activating
  NCED3 expression; this in turn induces stomatal closure. Dashed lines represent
  missing step(s)/component(s) that are yet-undetermined in the signaling pathway.
