caption: 'Regulation of tonic DA activity is under 2 distinct and opposing circuits:
  an activating circuit (vSub-NAc-VP), which releases DA neurons from VP GABAergic
  inhibition and one inhibitory circuit (BLA-VP), which increases VP GABAergic inhibition
  of DA neurons (see ). In animal models of chronic stress, there is a downregulation
  in VTA population activity, as indexed by reduced numbers of spontaneously active
  DA neurons, which limits the amplitude of the phasic DA response that is driven
  by the PPTg. Activation of the BLA by chronic or repeated stress drives an attenuation
  in VTA DA neuron population activity via enhanced excitatory drive onto the VP,
  which increases inhibition of DA neuron firing. Chronic stress also attenuates excitation
  within the vSub-NAc-VP pathway, which increases the number of DA neurons that are
  under inhibitory control by the VP. Hence, chronic stress increases drive of the
  BLA-VP (i.e. inhibiting) circuit while also decreasing excitatory drive within the
  vSub-NAc-VP (i.e. activating) circuit, both of which converge to inhibit VTA DA
  neuron firing.'
