caption: Cooperation between β-AR and B2R signaling leads to augmentation of isoproterenol-induced
  cAMP accumulation and prevention of BK-induced activation of MAPK. The model depicts
  molecular events following costimulation of β-AR and B2R in COS-7 cells. (i) Activation
  of the cAMP pathway by the β-AR leads to inhibition of the Gq-mediated activation
  of the PLCβ-PKC pathway by the B2R and thereby prevents BK-induced stimulation of
  MAPK activity. The transactivation of EGFR via the B2R remains intact. (ii) Activated
  Gs protein is the first requirement of B2R to activate Gi protein. Gβγ subunits
  released from Gi stimulate AC II leading to augmentation of β-AR-triggered cAMP
  accumulation.
