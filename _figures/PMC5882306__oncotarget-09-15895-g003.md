caption: C5065 DFT1 cells were treated with imiquimod at 60 μg/ml for 24 h. The transcriptome
  of treated and untreated cells was analysed by RNA-seq and IPA was used to predict
  canonical pathways regulated by imiquimod treatment. The significantly regulated
  canonical pathway ‘Unfolded protein response’ is shown. Up-regulated genes are coloured
  red and down-regulated genes are coloured blue.
