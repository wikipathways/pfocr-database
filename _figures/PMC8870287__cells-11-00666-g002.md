caption: Schematic diagram of commonly accepted IGF-signaling. The half-life and other
  biological activities of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is regulated by binding
  to insulin growth factor binding protein (IGFBP), while free IGF-1 can bind specifically
  to the IGF1 receptor. Ligand binding to the α-subunit of the receptor leads to a
  conformational change in the β subunit, resulting in the activation of the receptor’s
  tyrosine kinase activity. Activated receptor phosphorylates several substrates,
  including insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) and Src homology and collagen family
  protein (SHC). Phospho-tyrosine residues in these substrates are recognized by certain
  Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing signaling molecules. These include phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), growth factor receptor-bound 2 (GRB2), and others. These
  bindings lead to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  and Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway. Activation of these
  signaling pathways is required for the induction of various activities of IGF-1,
  including neuroprotection.
