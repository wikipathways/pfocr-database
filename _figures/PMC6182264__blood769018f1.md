caption: 'VWF regulation of angiogenesis through multiple pathways: model. A model
  for multiple pathways likely to be involved in VWF regulation of angiogenesis. In
  EC, VWF is essential for the formation of WPB, organelles that store the growth
  factor Ang-2. Loss of intracellular VWF results in increased release of Ang-2 from
  WPB; Ang-2 binding to its receptor Tie-2 can synergize with VEGFR-2 signaling to
  destabilize blood vessels and promote angiogenesis. Thus loss of VWF could enhance
  angiogenesis via an Ang-2/Tie-2/VEGFR-2 pathway. Moreover, VWF released from WPB
  interacts with the adhesion receptor integrin αvβ3 and stabilizes its expression
  on the cell surface. In selected conditions, αvβ3 integrin is able to quench VEGFR-2
  activity and downstream signaling, thus exerting a repressive effect on angiogenesis.
  Loss of VWF in EC results in decreased αvβ3 expression, which may cause enhanced
  VEGFR-2 signaling. Enhanced, deregulated VEGFR-2 signaling has been shown to cause
  dysfunctional angiogenesis leading to dysplastic blood vessels, similar to those
  described in angiodysplasia. Finally, WPB also store the carbohydrate-binding protein
  Gal-3. Gal-3 promotes angiogenesis through pathways that involve both αvβ3 and VEGFR-2;
  levels of Gal-3 are increased in brain microvasculature of VWF-deficient mice. Thus,
  VWF is likely to affect multiple angiogenic pathways, both as an extracellular ligand
  and because of its ability to control storage and possibly expression of endothelial
  proteins. VEGFR-2, VEGF receptor-2.'
