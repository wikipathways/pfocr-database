caption: Reactome pathway analysis of the genes identified by KEGG term analysis.
  (A) Reactome pathways analysis of the miRNA target genes (n = 112) identified following
  AG-205 treatment illustrates increased pathway involvement. (B) Top pathways involved
  within the miRNA target genes (n = 84) observed following PGRMC1 silencing were
  also mapped. Over-represented pathways are highlighted in yellow. All overexpressed
  pathways are from gene lists of formerly annotated and published signatures.
