caption: N-acetylglutamine is abnormally elevated in HF and may be the potential biomarker
  of HF. And its specific metabolic-degrading enzyme ACY1 expression is significantly
  decreased and has played a critical role in myocardial fibrosis during the development
  of HF. Rg3 could ameliorate myocardial fibrosis to improve HF through ACY1-mediated
  TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway.
