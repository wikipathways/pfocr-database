caption: Metabolic network of tomato leaves displaying the differences between the
  metabolic composition of unpunctured and N. tenuis-punctured leaves. Single-headed
  or double-headed arrows indicate one or two-way reactions between metabolite pools,
  respectively. Solid lines symbolize one-step consecutive metabolites in a biosynthetic
  pathway and dashed lines multi-step or not fully elucidated biosynthetic pathway
  sections. Three different symbols below each metabolite represent their relative
  abundance in N. tenuis-punctured tomato plant tissues (top, middle, and lower leaf),
  as compared to those in the unpunctured plants. Red upward arrow indicates increased
  abundance in N. tenuis-punctured compared to unpunctured. Green downward arrow indicates
  decreased abundance in N. tenuis-punctured, compared to unpunctured. Gray squares
  indicate no substantial differences in the two treatments (PT; predator (punctured)-top,
  CT; control-top, PM; predator-middle, CM; vs control-middle, PL; predator-lower,
  CL; control-lower leaves).
