caption: Implication of the metabolic pathways in the regulation of the Il10 gene
  in Bregs. Phosphorylated STAT3 could induce metabolic pathways such as the Hypoxia
  sensing by the transcription of Hif-1α. The Hif1α protein binds on the HRE sites
  located on the Il10 gene to induce its transcription and its production by Bregs.
  In parallel, another metabolic driver implicated in the multi-step transformation
  of acetyl-CoA to cholesterol, the geranylgeranyl transferase I (GGTi) catalyses
  the conversion of geranylgeranyl-PP (GGPP) to drive the isoprenylation process.
  This mechanism controls the Ras-dependent downstream signal of the PI3K-Akt pathway,
  leading to the restriction of the inhibitory GSK3 activity and thus activation of
  the Il10 transcription. The GGP-dependent pathway via the regulation of the PI3K
  downstream signaling regulated the Prdm1 gene translation and the Blimp-1 translation
  directly promoting Il10 production. TLR, toll-like receptor; BCR, B-cell receptor;
