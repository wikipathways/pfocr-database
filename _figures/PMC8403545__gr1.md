caption: Summery of the pan-anti allergy vaccine therapy concept. Administering a
  vaccine that is capable of producing antibodies against the body’s own self IgE
  molecule, and neutralising it by preventing it from binding onto its receptor, could
  disrupt the entire allergy pathway and potentially curing the disease .
