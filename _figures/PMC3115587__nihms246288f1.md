caption: a Glucose catabolism in N. meningitidis proceeds by the Entner–Doudoroff
  pathway and lactate catabolism feeds directly into the sialic acid pathway. Note
  the relative number of metabolic steps from glucose to phosphoenolpyruvate compared
  with that from lactate to phosphoenolpyruvate. b Sialylated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
  on the N. meningitidis surface mimics the surface of eukaryotic cells, preventing
  deposition of the complement molecule C3. Inactivation of the lactate permease gene
  lctP results in C3-mediated cell lysis.
