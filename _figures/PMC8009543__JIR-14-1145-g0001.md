caption: Model of NLRP3 activation. Signals 1 and 2 are both essential for NLRP3 activation.
  Regarding signal 1, the NF-κB pathway can be activated by TLRs, RLRs and TNF-α signaling,
  leading to pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 upregulation. Regarding signal 2, various PAMPs
  and DAMPs induce ASC assembly and caspase-1 maturation, which involves NLRP3 activation.
  In some cases, this is related to the presence of a high concentration of extracellular
  ATP and subsequent K+, Cl− efflux via P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2RX7) channels, pannexin-1
  or CLIC channels. Additionally, nigericin, asbestos, and other particulates can
  induce lysosomal damage, releasing cathepsin B into the cytosol. Moreover, ROS can
  activate NLRP3 by inducing Ca2+ influx through transient receptor potential melastatin
  2 (TRPM2) channels. The ALRs can interact with NLRP3 leading to pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
  upregulation. Lastly, NLRP3 can bind to the dispersed trans-Golgi network (dTGN)
  via PI4P. Downstream of these processes, IL-1β and IL-18 are released.
