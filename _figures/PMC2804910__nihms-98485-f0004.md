caption: A schematic drawing illustrating the likely sequence of events in the seminiferous
  epithelium following Cd treatment (e.g., 3 mg/kg b.w. via i.p.) that leads to BTB
  disruption and germ cell loss in three phases. In Phase I, Cd ions likely enter
  Sertoli and/or germ cell via different mechanisms, such as diffusion, Ca+2 channels
  or using a Cd+2/Zn+2 transporter (Step 1). Although the Cd transporter, ZIP8, is
  present in Sertoli cells in the mouse, it is not known if it is present in all rodents
  and/or mammals, as well as in germ cells. Once inside the Sertoli and/or germ cell,
  Cd induces the synthesis and release of cytokines (e.g., TGFβ-3), which, by interacting
  with their respective receptors, activates the stress activated p38 MAPK signaling
  pathway (Step 2) that can selectively disrupt the BTB. At the same time, possibly
  also mediated by the p38 MAPK, the production of proteases (e.g., cathepsin L) is
  also induced (Step 3). In Phase II, the BTB is disrupted via degradation of the
  integral membrane proteins (via the effects of proteases) and/or an acceleration
  of clathrin-mediated endocytosis of tight junction (e.g., occludin) and basal ES
  proteins (e.g., N-cadherin). The net results of all this contribute to the disruption
  of the BTB and Sertoli-germ cell junctions that lead to germ cell loss (Step 4).
  In Phase III, in order to limit unwanted proteolysis and avoid the dissolution of
  the entire seminiferous epithelium in the testis, there is an activation of c-JNK
  signaling pathway, which, in turn, stimulates the production of protease inhibitors
  (e.g., α2-macroglobulin) to initiate recovery of the seminiferous epithelium (Step
  5). This cascade of events depicted herein is based on recent findings in the field
  as detailed in the text.
