caption: WNT ligands are post-translationally modified in ER with the participation
  of porcupine (PORC) and secreted into the extraexcellular space, where WNTs interact
  with receptors FZDs and co-receptors LRP5/6. Antagonists SFRPs and WIF can bind
  to WNT ligands while SFRPs can also interact with FZDs. Antagonists SOST and DKKs
  bind to LRP5/6 to compete with WNT ligands. WNT binding to the receptors initiates
  the disassembly of the destruction complex consisting of DVL/AXIN/APC/GSK3β/CK1,
  resulting in the release of the stabilized β-catenin to cytoplasm, which is subsequently
  transloated into cell nucleus and regulates WNT target genes in concert with co-activators
  BCL9, Pygo and CBP/p300. TANKs interact with AXIN and promote its degradation. RSPOs
  interact with LRG5 and membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligases ZNRF3/RNF43 and inhibit
  the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of FZDs. In WNT-OFF cells (the inserted
  box), the destruction complex is assembled, and the β-catenin protein is phosphorylated
  by CK1 and GSK3β, and doomed for proteasome-mediated protein degradation.
