caption: 'The impact of depression on the kynurenine (KYN) pathway in brain and periphery.
  The figure depicts KYN metabolites and their related effects on neuronal cells (inside
  boxes) and the enzymes that metabolize them (arrows). The impact of inflammation
  or stress-related conditions on key rate-limiting enzymes such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
  (IDO) shifts KYN metabolism towards microglial byproducts such as 3-hydroxykynurenine
  (3-HK) and quinolinic acid (QA). This metabolic change is associated with elevated
  oxidative stress (3-HK and QA) and glutamate excitotoxicity (QA) that could contribute
  to depressive symptoms (right panel). Conversely, during homeostasis, substantial
  amounts of KYN are converted to kynurenic acid (KynA), a process mediated by kynurenine
  aminotransferase II (KAT II) in astrocytes (left panel). At physiologic levels,
  KynA is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist and contributes to the
  clearance of glutamate spillover in the brain.Abbreviations: TNF-α: tumor necrosis
  factor alpha; IFN-gamma: interferon gamma; IL-6: interleukin-6; α7nAChR: alpha-7-nicotinic
  acetylcholine receptor.'
