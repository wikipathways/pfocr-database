caption: 'The induction of autophagy by various stimuli (e.g. starvation, hypoxia,
  etc) signals through the activation of the TSC1/TSC2 complex that leads to the inhibition
  of mTOR. Dephosphorylated mAtg13 resulting from mTOR inactivation then associates
  with and activates the Atg1/ULK kinase. Together, they form the Atg1 kinase complex
  with FIP200 and Atg101, triggering the autophagic cascade. Vesicle nucleation is
  primarily driven by the class III phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase (PI3KC3)
  complex. The core subunits of this complex include PI3KC3, p150, and Beclin1. Recent
  data suggest that mulitple Beclin1 complexes may be involved in the mammalian autophagy
  regulation. In pariticular, the tumor suppressor, UVRAG, Bif-1 (an UVRAG interactor),
  and probably Ambra-1 associate with Beclin1 to activate autophagy. This is frequently
  dysregulated in many human cancers. Additionally, Atg14 was also found to promote
  atuophagy by forming a separate complex with Beclin1. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins
  negatively regulate autophagy by sequestering Beclin1. This is counteracted by the
  proapoptotic BH3-only molecules which promote autophagy by freeing Beclin1 from
  Bcl-2 inhibition. Two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems are involved in autophagosomal
  membrane expansion and completion: one is the Atg8/LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) conjugation, the other is the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 conjugation. After proteolytic
  cleavage of its carboxyterminus by the Atg4C cystein protease, Atg8 is coupled to
  the membrane lipid PE after sequential processing by Atg7, an E1-like enzyme and
  Atg3, an E2-like enzyme. Atg12 is conjugated to Atg5 in a similar manner except
  Atg10 is used as the E2 enzyme instead of Atg3. During this conjugation process,
  the interation of ubiquitin-like Atg8 with Atg3 can be severely disturbed by FLIP,
  an oncogenic protein. In contrast, proapoptotic DAPK positively regulates this process
  by associating with an Atg8/LC3-interacting cytoskeleton molecule, MAP1B. The fusion
  of the autophagosome with the lysosome signifies the maturation stage of the autophagy
  pathway, a step that is least understood but has been found to functionally converge
  with the endocytic pathway. Lysosomal fusion is driven by SNAREs, the small GTPase
  Rab7, PI3KC3, and the HOPS complex which consists of the class C vacuolar protein
  sorting (C/Vps) complex core (Vps11, Vps16, Vps18, and Vps33) and two additional
  subunits Vps39 and Vps41 [–]. UVRAG forms a complex with HOPS and facilitates HOPS-mediated
  membrane tethering, which likely involves Rab7 activation. In addition, Rubicon
  was recently found to associate with the endosome-associated PI3KC3 complex, exerting
  an inhibitory effect on the PI3KC3 activity and the fusion of the autophagosome
  with the lysosome. Not only are effector proteins of autophagy implicated in cancer
  development, but the autophagy pathway is also regulated by both oncogenes and tumor
  suppressors.'
