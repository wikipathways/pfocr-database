caption: Biogenesis of canonical and mirtron miRNAs in animal cells. In canonical
  pathway, miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase Π (Pol Π) or RNA polymerase
  Ш (Pol Ш) to produce the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts. The cropping of
  pri-miRNAs is mediated by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex (viz. microprocessor) that generates
  60–70 nt precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). After being exported by exportin-5 from
  the nucleus, pre-miRNAs are processed into ~22 nt miRNA/miRNA* duplexes by Dicer-TRBP
  complex. Finally, mature miRNAs are loaded onto Argonaute proteins, leading to cleavage
  or degradation of the targeted genes. In the mirtron pathway, the miRNA-containing
  introns, termed as mirtrons, are spliced and debranched into pre-miRNAs that bypass
  Drosha processing. Afterwards, the intron-derived pre-miRNAs access the canonical
  miRNA pathway during nuclear export and then are spliced by Dicer and loaded onto
  Argonaute proteins.
