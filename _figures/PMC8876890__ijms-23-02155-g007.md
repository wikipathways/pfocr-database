caption: A proposed model for the molecular mechanisms of EMS1 and BRI1 signaling
  and the origin and divergence of BR receptor. The left side of the model diagram
  shows the molecular mechanism of EMS1-TPD1 signaling. The ligand TPD1 binds to EMS1
  and activates the complex composed of EMS1-SERKs. The intracellular domain of EMS1
  interacts with the direct substrate BSKs to initiate the signal transduction pathway.
  The three tyrosine phosphorylation sites Y990, Y1085, and Y1090 shown in the kinase
  domain of EMS1 are involved in the regulation of kinase activity. The middle diagram
  represents the chimeric receptor signaling mechanism. When the LRR14-eJM region
  in EMS1 was replaced with that of BRI1, the EMS1 chimeric receptor gained the ability
  as a BR receptor The LRR14-eJM region includes at least three important motifs including
  LRR14, ID-LRR12, and eJM domain. The right side of the model diagram shows the molecular
  mechanism of BRI1-BRs signaling. The corresponding phosphorylation sites Y956, Y1052,
  and Y1057 in the kinase domain of BRI1 are involved in the regulation of kinase
  activity, but only Y1052 is an essential phosphorylation site for BRI1 function.
  Due to the stronger kinase activity of BRI1 than EMS1, BRI1 has a stronger signal
  output ability than EMS1. Our experiments revealed that the functional divergence
  of BRI1 and EMS1 exists in the receptor’s extracellular domain. Therefore, three
  important motifs in the LRR14-eJM region may be the key molecular components in
  the origin of the BR receptor.
