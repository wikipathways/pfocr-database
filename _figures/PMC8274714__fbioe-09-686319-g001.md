caption: 'Schematic view of five 5AVA biosynthesis pathways and a 5AVA degradation
  pathway. Five different pathways for potential 5AVA production in Bacillus methanolicus
  were tested; two pathways have L-lysine as precursor, and three pathways have cadaverine
  as an intermediate metabolite, obtained by conversion of L-lysine by a lysine decarboxylase
  (CadA). (A) DavBA pathway: L-lysine conversion to 5AVA by lysine 2-monooxygenase
  (DavB) and 5-aminovaleramidase (DavA). (B) RaiP pathway: conversion of L-lysine
  to α-ketolysine by a L-lysine α-oxidase (RaiP) and spontaneous decarboxylation of
  α-ketolysine in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. (C) SpuI pathway: cadaverine
  to γ-glutamine-cadaverine (γ-glu-cadaverine) by glutamylpolyamine synthetase (SpuI),
  with subsequent activity of polyamine:pyruvate transaminase (SpuC), aldehyde dehydrogenase
  (KauB), and glutamine amidotransferase class I (PauD2); γ-glu-aminopentanal: γ-glutamine-aminopentanal,
  γ-glu-aminovalerate: γ-glutamine-aminovalerate. (D) PatA pathway: cadaverine to
  5-aminopentanal through activity of putrescine aminase (PatA) and 5-aminopentanal
  conversion to 5AVA by 5-aminopentanal dehydrogenase (PatD). (E) Puo pathway: cadaverine
  to 5-aminopentanal through activity of putrescine oxidase (Puo), followed by 5AVA
  formation by PatD. 5AVA is degraded to glutarate by GABAse activity, a combination
  of γ-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (GabT) and succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase
  (GabD), although this activity was not found in B. methanolicus ().'
