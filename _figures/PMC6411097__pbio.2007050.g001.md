caption: Native reactions are colored in gray, and heterologous reactions are colored
  in cyan. Dashed lines represent multiple enzymatic reactions. Red shaded lines indicate
  an inactive pathway after gene deletion (red cross). Metabolically related reactions
  are boxed together. Numbers shown are simulated metabolic fluxes as mmol gram per
  dry weight per hour. μ indicates the growth rate. CYS, cysteine; cysE, serine acetyltransferase;
  Cys3, cystathionine-γ-lyase; Cys4, cystathionine-β-synthase; MET, methionine; Mtase,
  methyltransferase; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SER, serine.
