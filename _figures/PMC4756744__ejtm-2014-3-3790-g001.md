caption: 'Schematic representation of AVP-dependent signaling pathways in myogenic
  cells. The transduction of AVP signal in myogenic cells involves the activation
  of PLC and PLD. PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, producing
  the second messengers DAG and IP3. DAG also derives from PA produced by PtdCho via
  PLD. DAG activates the protein kinase C (PKC), while IP3 is responsible for Ca2+
  release from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. An increased intracellular
  cytosolic Ca2+ concentration activates the CaMK pathway, thus inducing cytosolic
  compartmentalization of class II HDACs. Calcium signaling also activates CnA, which
  in turn promotes the dephosphorylation and the consequent nuclear import of the
  NFAT family. In the nucleus, NFAT gives rise to the formation of multifactorial
  complexes with MEF2 and GATA2 in the promoter region of muscle specific genes. The
  absence of class II HDACs is also likely to promote this transcriptional activation,
  leading to the activation of the skeletal muscle differentiation program. AVP also
  interferes with the cAMP signaling system: PA (produced by PLD-dependent hydrolysis
  of PtdCho) activates PDE4, which in turn promotes cAMP breakdown, thus inhibiting
  cAMP-dependent activation of PKA, a kinase known to negatively regulate myogenic
  differentiation.'
