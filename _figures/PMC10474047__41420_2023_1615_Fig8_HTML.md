caption: Schematic representation of the principal results of this study (created
  with BioRender). A Gonadotrope cells (in red) differentiate in the ventral part
  of the pituitary and then disseminate in the gland. Our work shows that gonadotrope
  cell motility during pituitary organogenesis is dependent on NTRK3 receptor whose
  expression is controlled by ND1 and ND4 transcription factors. NTRK3 interacts with
  c-Src kinase and promotes its activation, a prerequisite for maturation of FAs and
  cell migration. B NEUROD1/4 insufficiency leads to a defect in NTRK3 expression,
  leading to a c-Src hypo-activation, which, in turn, disturbs FAK phosphorylation
  pattern. These signaling disruptions induce an accumulation of immature focal adhesions,
  preventing cell migration.
