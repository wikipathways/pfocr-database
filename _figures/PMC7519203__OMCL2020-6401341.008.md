caption: 'Proinflammatory signaling that occurs during viral infection and mechanisms
  through which R-BHB inhibits this signaling. (a) The ACE system. (b) The mechanism
  by which R-BHB inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome is unknown. Four possible mechanisms
  are shown. (c) The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is required to initiate an effective
  antiviral innate immune response, but its increased activity can also stimulate
  a cytokine storm. Abbreviations: 6PGDL: 6-phosphonoglocono-D-lactone; 6PG: 6-phosphogluconate;
