caption: 'A hypothetical scheme of the influence of ribosomal gene (RG) dosage in
  the genome of a non-carrier (green text and arrows) and a carrier (red text and
  arrows) of a monogenic autism mutation on the disease severity. The idea is that
  low RG copy numbers that lead to ribosome underabundance would attenuate the signs
  of monogenic autism caused by excessive protein production in the dendrites. (1)
  Without mutation, the copy number of ribosomal genes makes no difference. The cell
  produces such quantity of ribosomes and proteins as required for its functioning
  at the moment, via switching on and off the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription according
  to demand. (2) A mutation resulting in hyper-activation of mTOR signaling pathway,
  provided that the cell has a sufficient quantity of ribosomal genes in the genome,
  leads to elevated rDNA transcription and hyper-activation of local (dendritic) translation
  resulting in overproduction of some proteins. The protein overproduction results
  in aberrant synapse morphology and defect LTD/LTP processes in the synaptic networks.
  Autism and (or) mental retardation develops. (3) I hypothesize here that formes
  frustes of the monogenic syndromes with safe intellect are only possible in case
  of the presence of a small number of copies of ribosomal genes in the genome. In
  that case, the ribosomal genes, despite hyperactivation, are unable to produce so
  much rRNA and, consequently, ribosomes, so that the local protein synthesis in dendrites
  would be measurably disturbed. Abbreviations: LTD/LTP—long-term depression/potentiation;
  RYK—receptor-like tyrosine kinase; mGLuR—metabotropic glutamate receptor; NR—N-methyl-d-aspartate
  receptor.'
