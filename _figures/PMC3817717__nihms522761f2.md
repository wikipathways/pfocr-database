caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Inc., Redwood City, CA) of
  endothelial gene expression. Following microarray analyses, a data set containing
  gene identifiers with corresponding expression values and False Discovery Rakes
  were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Networks of these focus genes were
  then algorithmically generated based on their connectivity. Only direct interactions
  of gene–protein and protein–protein were considered. Seven networks were combined
  to form one large network. Dark gray color indicates EC gene upregulation in athero-susceptible
  regions of arteries compared with athero-protected regions. Seventy percent of these
  genes were interelated through protein biosynthetic pathways. Light gray color indicates
  molecules present in the data set that were not significantly differentially expressed.
