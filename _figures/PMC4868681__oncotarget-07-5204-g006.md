caption: 'Such inhibition elicits a rise of cellular concentrations of acyl-CoA esters
  of saturated fatty acids and a concomitant decline of cellular concentrations of
  acyl-CoA esters of unsaturated fatty acids. Genes, proteins and processes whose
  increased expression levels, activities and rates promote tumorigenesis in cells
  that are not exposed to the SCD inhibitors are displayed in red color. Proteins
  and processes whose activities and rates attenuate tumorigenesis in response to
  cell treatment with the SCD inhibitors are displayed in green color. See text for
  more details. Abbreviations: ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; AMPK, AMP-activated protein
  kinase; Akt, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  FA-CoA, acyl-CoA ester of fatty acid; FASN, fatty acid synthase; PI3K/Akt, phosphatidylinositol-3
  kinase/Akt signaling pathway; PM, plasma membrane; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein; UPRER, the unfolded protein response signaling pathway in the ER.'
