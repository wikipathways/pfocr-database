caption: Internalization and cellular trafficking of FGFRs. FGFRs are internalized
  via diverse endocytic mechanisms. The selection of an internalization pathway depends
  on the receptor type and is modulated by the partner proteins. After internalization,
  FGFRs are sorted into endosomes, where they can be directed either to lysosomal
  degradation (mainly FGFR1-3) or recycled to the plasma membrane (FGFR4). The receptor
  ubiquitination decides about the intracellular sorting of endocytosed FGFRs.
