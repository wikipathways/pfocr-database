caption: 'A schematic diagram illustrating miR-107 and GRN function in the balance
  between radiosensitivity and radioresistance in PC-3 cells. Left: MiR-107 is repressed
  and GRN induced in PC-3 cells following exposure to IR. p21 and CHK2, both cell
  cycle regulators, is activated or phosphorylated in response to DNA damage induced
  by IR, resulting in G1/S and G2/M arrest, which allows for repair of DNA damage
  and maintenance of genomic integrity. Right: Elevated miR-107 represses GRN expression
  by directly targeting GRN mRNA. Upon miR-107 overexpression and GRN knockdown, flow
  cytometry showed more prominent G1/S arrest and/or G2 check point abrogation (G2/M
  transit), and annexin V binding assays revealed delayed apoptosis after IR. Consequently,
  miR-107 sensitizes cancer cells to IR by down-regulating the p21 pathway or directly
  repressing CHK2 phosphorylation to modulate cell cycle checkpoint function.'
