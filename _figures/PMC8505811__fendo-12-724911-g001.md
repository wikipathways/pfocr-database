caption: The main mechanisms of muscle-bone crosstalk. 1) IL-17 secreted by Th17 cells
  induces RANKL expression in mice, which combines with RANK on the surface of osteoclasts
  to activate TRAF6 and c-Fos to induce osteoclastogenesis, and eventually, bone resorption
  occurs. OPG, the decoy receptor of RANKL, can prevent RANKL from activating RANK
  in the extracellular environment, thereby inhibiting osteoclast formation and bone
  loss; 2) During exercise, the muscle-derived IL-6 (mIL-6) acts on the IL-6 receptor
  on the surface of osteoblasts and increases the production of RANKL, subsequently
  promoting osteoclast differentiation and the secretion of bioactive osteocalcin
  through RANKL/RANK pathway in osteoclasts. In turn, osteocalcin also enhances the
  production of mIL-6 during exercise. Thus, a feed-forward loop between muscle and
  bone favors exercise adaptations. 3) Myostatin signals through ActRIIB, which forms
  a heterodimer with ALK 4/5. The intracellular ALK4/5 phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3,
  and then forms a complex with SMAD4. The complex translocates to the nucleus to
  regulate the transcription of genes involved in the proliferation and differentiation
  of skeletal muscle precursor cells. The activation of SMAD2 and 3 by myostatin also
  inhibits the Akt/mTOR pathway in response to pro-growth signals, and therefore,
  suppresses protein synthesis. Ultimately, myostatin contributes to muscle atrophy.
  4) Irisin produced by skeletal muscles during exercise acts on integrin αV/β on
  the surface of osteocytes to promote sclerostin production, leading to bone resorption.
  5) IL-6 can also promote the generation of IL-17.
