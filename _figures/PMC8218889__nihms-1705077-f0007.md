caption: The scheme illustrates the known mechanisms of autonomic nervous system control
  and the intracellular signaling events that mediate saliva secretion, as well as
  the potential role(s) of PDE4 in inducing salivation. As shown within the blue rectangle
  representing the salivary glands, direct stimulation of glandular Gq-coupled receptors,
  such as M3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M3R) or α1-adrenergic receptors (α1AR),
  and the subsequent rise in intracellular Ca2+ mediates the release of high volumes
  of watery saliva that is dependent upon activation of the calcium-activated chloride
  channel TMEM16A, . In addition, stimulation of intracellular cAMP signaling, such
  as upon activation of β-adrenergic receptors (βAR), promotes saliva secretion via
  a pathway dependent upon the cAMP/PKA-activation of the anion channel CFTR, . Under
  conditions of inhibited neuronal signaling due to Ketamine/Xylazine-induced anesthesia,
  only the events shown below the red striated line are detected. Under these conditions,
  inhibition of PDE4/PDE4D selectively potentiates a β-adrenoceptor-, cAMP-, and CFTR-dependent
  saliva secretion (/C), which is completely ablated in homozygous ΔF508-CFTR mice
  (), that lack functional CFTR, or by treatment with the β-blocker Propranolol ().
  On the other hand, in anesthetized mice, PDE4 inhibition does not affect salivation
  induced by the direct action of the M3R agonist Pilocarpine on salivary glands.
  However, in awake/conscious mice, inhibition of PDE4 induces salivation via an additional,
  central/neuronal mechanism that remains to be defined and may involve the sympathetic
  autonomic nervous system (SANS), the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system (PANS),
  or the central nervous system (CNS), but is ablated by the muscarinic blocker Atropine
  (), and only partially dependent upon CFTR ().
