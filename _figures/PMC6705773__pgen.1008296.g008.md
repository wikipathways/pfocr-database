caption: Schematic models comparing the E. coli FtsEX-EnvC-Amidase complex that functions
  during division (left) with the B. subtilis SweDC-FtsEX-CwlO elongation hydrolase
  complex (right). In E. coli, FtsE (E)—FtsX (X) complex promotes divisome assembly
  [, ] and regulates septal cell wall cleavage by the amidases AmiA and AmiB (Ami)
  via the coiled-coil domain-containing regulator EnvC [, ]. FtsEX has been found
  to interact with FtsZ (Z) [] and FtsA (A) [] and FtsEX ATPase activity is required
  for both PG synthesis [, ] and amidase activity []. SweD and SweC reside in a membrane
  complex with FtsEX and function as co-factors in regulating the D,L-endopeptidase
  activity of CwlO. Based on ribosome profiling and our two-hybrid analysis, the stoichiometry
  of the SweD-SweC-FtsE-FtsX complex is proposed to be 4:2:2:2. Our analysis suggests
  that SweDC regulate the FtsEX ATPase activity. Genetic evidence suggests that the
  hydrolase complex functions in the same pathway as the peptidoglycan elongation
  machinery (not depicted) []. Whether this is direct or indirect is currently unknown.
