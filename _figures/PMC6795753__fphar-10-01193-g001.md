caption: Diagram illustrates the mechanisms of insulin resistance. Normally, after
  a meal, pancreatic β cells secrete insulin in response to meal-induced increase
  in blood glucose. First, insulin promotes muscle tissue to assimilate blood glucose
  and convert it into muscle glycogen and protein. Additionally, insulin also promotes
  hepatocytes to absorb blood glucose and converts it into liver glycogen. Meanwhile,
  insulin can inhibit glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to reduce postprandial blood
  glucose in liver tissues. Moreover, insulin can stimulate adipose cells to assimilate
  blood glucose and convert it into fat. Under starvation conditions, the secretion
  of insulin will be inhibited, and the hypoglycemic activity of insulin on liver,
  muscle, and adipose is also suppressed. Under insulin-resistant conditions, lipolysis
  is promoted in adipose tissue, thereby releasing excess fatty acids into the blood
  and then transporting them to the liver and skeletal muscle tissue. Then, fatty
  acids can activate PKC, which may markedly impair insulin signal pathway to cause
  hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin resistance. IR, insulin resistance; DNL, de
  novo lipogenesis; DAG, diacylglycerol; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PKC, protein
  kinase C; ChREBP, carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein; ACC, acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; GLUT, glucose transporter.
