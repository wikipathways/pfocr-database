caption: 'Hepatitis B virus immune tolerance mechanism. In hepatocyte, hepatitis B
  virus (HBV) inhibits toll-like receptors mediated interferon (IFN)-α/β production
  by blocking the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 HBV interferes with
  the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) signaling pathway in hepatocyte and inhibits
  the production of IFN-α/β by disrupting the interaction between mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
  protein and RIG-I. HBV affects the activation of natural killer (NK) cells by inhibiting
  the production of interleukin (IL)-18 by macrophages. HBV promotes the generation
  of Tregs, which release IL-10 and transforming growth factor β to increase the expression
  of surface inhibitory receptors on NK cells and CD8 + T cells, thereby reducing
  IFN and tumor necrosis factor-α release. The expression of immune checkpoints on
  the surface of CD8 + T cells increases, leading to T cell exhaustion, resulting
  in immune tolerance of HBV. IL: Interleukin; HBV: Hepatitis B virus; NK: Natural
