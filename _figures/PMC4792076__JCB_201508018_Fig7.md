caption: Schematic view of β3 integrin–GSK3β and BMP-2–Smad cooperation. The interaction
  between BMP-2 and BMP-2 receptors activates αvβ3 integrin and mediate cell spreading
  and cell migration thanks to BMP2–FN interaction. In turn, αvβ3 is required first
  to allow the C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad by BMPR and second to inhibit GSK3
  activity through the Src–FAK–ILK pathway. BMP receptors and β3 integrin signaling
  converge to control both focal adhesion dynamics and Smad signaling to couple cell
  migration and fate commitment.

  Smad signaling in a stiffness-independent manner.
