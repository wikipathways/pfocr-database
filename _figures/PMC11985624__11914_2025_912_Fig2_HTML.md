caption: Conceptual representation of potential mechanisms for osteogenic effects
  of exercise. HiRIT = high-intensity resistance and impact training; IL-6 = interleukin-6;
  sEVs = small extracellular vesicles; SOST = sclerostin gene; MSC = mesenchymal stem/stromal
  cell. Figure created with BioRender.com. HiRIT in a postmenopausal woman may exert
  positive effects on bone tissue through various musculoskeletal pathways. The increased
  skeletal load (strain) is detected by mechanosensitive osteocytes embedded in the
  bone matrix. Osteocytes then downregulate SOST expression which results in increased
  osteogenic differentiation (mesenchymal stem/stromal cells undergo differentiation
  into bone-forming osteoblasts). Activation of skeletal muscle tissue may also trigger
  release of myokines known to modulate bone metabolism (IL-6, irisin, myostatin)
  or other myokines/mediators travelling in muscle-derived small extracellular vesicles
