caption: Schematic representation of genomic instability in breast cancer. In humans,
  inherited mutations in ATM, P53, CHK1, CHK2, and BRCA1/BRCA2 genes, which are DNA
  damage checkpoints, are associated with predisposition to malignancy. Primarily,
  the exact etiology of breast cancer is not clear, but various estimated factors,
  including heritable, endogenous, and exogenous, may cause DNA damage. Initiation
  of checkpoint response requires ATM or ATR kinase, depending upon the type of DNA
  damage. In response to DNA damage, ATM or ATR phosphorylate different substrates
  such as BRCA1, P53, CHK1, and CHK2. The caretaker tumor-suppressor genes BRCA1 and
  BRCA2 maintain the integrity of the genome by fixing errors mainly related to DNA
  double-strand breaks and replication forks. Breast cancer cells cannot repair the
  DNA strand breaks due to mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, which may result in accumulation
  of mutations that are responsible for triggering proliferation and metastasis. On
  the other hand, in response to DNA damage, BRCA1-mutated cells have a defective
  checkpoint function in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle, as BRCA1 also plays an
  important role in mediating cell cycle arrest. In DNA damage response, BRCA1 acting
  as a scaffold protein facilitates p53 phosphorylation by ATM, which leads to p53-induced
  p21 induction and mediates G1/S arrest. Primarily, this will result in defective
  DNA repair and chromosome instability, which further leads to acquiring genomic
  instability and malignant features. In breast cancer cells, germline or somatic
  mutation, copy number aberration, and epigenetic control alteration have been shown
  to affect several genes that are responsible for maintaining genomic stability in
  normal conditions. Loss of key DNA damage repair genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD52,
  PALB2, BR1P; and genome caretaker genes such as ATM, CHEK2, and TP53 are highly
  associated with increased risk of breast cancer development. PI3-K/Akt, the extracellular
  signaling pathway, is crucial for the control of cell growth and is normally regulated
  by several extracellular signaling proteins, including insulin and insulin-like
  growth factors. In cancer cells, this pathway is abnormally activated by mutation
  in PTEN, and cancer cells can grow in the absence of such a signal, so this abnormal
  activation of Akt is central to the dysregulated growth process. The most common
  mutation of the tumor-suppressor gene in breast cancer is the loss of PTEN phosphatase,
  the normal function of which is to limit Akt activation by dephosphorylating PI3K.
  The tumor suppressor PTEN is an important modulator of chk1 function. Akt activation
  in response to PTEN loss phosphorylates CHK1 and leads to its monoubiquitination
  and sequestration from the nucleus. Outside the nucleus, phosphorylated CHK1 is
  unable to respond to its activating substrate, AKT/ATM, and there will be no phosphorylation
  of its substrate, including CDC25. CDC25A is the major substrate of chk1, which
  is overexpressed in breast cancer cells. In breast cancer, CDC25A overexpression
  leads to activation of the cyclin E/cdk complex, and has shown to play a very vital
  role in the unscheduled firing of origins of replication and induction of chromosome
  instability. So, reduced PTEN leads to increased Akt activation and increased cytoplasmic
  chk1 phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting its checkpoint function. A reduced amount
  of chk1 function is predisposed to genomic instability, and contributes to the development
  of breast cancer. In addition, Akt activation inhibits cyclin/CDK complex inhibitors,
  including p21, p27, and CDC25, which stimulate cell cycle arrest in response to
  activation of checkpoints. Moreover, activation of Akt phosphorylates and activating
  MDM2 stimulate the destruction of p53. In p53-deficient cells, the blockage of cdk2/cyclin
  E by p21 is not functional, thus hyperamplification of the centrosome may occur,
  which is the prerequisite for mitotic catastrophe.
