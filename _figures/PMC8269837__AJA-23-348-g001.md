caption: 'The main actions of androgen in cardiomyocytes. (1) Genomic pathway: androgen
  freely passes through the membrane and binds cytoplasmic AR. Bound AR translocates
  to the nucleus, binds to a DNA response element on the promoter of an androgen-responsive
  gene, and stimulates transcription. (2) Nongenomic pathways: androgen interacts
  with a membrane-associated androgen receptor, leading to the activation of L-type
  calcium channels. This increase in intracellular calcium can lead to the activation
  of PKC and, via calmodulin, lead to the activation of the PKA and MAPK pathways.
  The initial influx of Ca2+ further stimulates the efflux of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum via ryanodine receptor type-2 channels. Ca2+ from these sources converges
  on the MAPK/ERK pathway, through which ERK subsequently translocates to the nucleus
  and interacts with transcriptional factors. (3) Testosterone induces cytoprotection
  by activating ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the cardiac mitochondrial inner membrane.
