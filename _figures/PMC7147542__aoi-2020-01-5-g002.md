caption: Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway. The PTCH1 gene encodes for a receptor protein
  of the SHH pathway, the Patched1 (PTCH1) receptor. PTCH1 receptor is allocated in
  the cell plasma membrane and functions as a receptor for ligands of the SHH proteins.
  PTCH1 receptor constitutively inhibits the next step in SHH pathway. The protein
  SHH ligand binds to PTCH1 receptor, resulting in a complex in which PTCH1 receptor
  becomes inhibited releasing the downstream signalling pathway. PTCH1 gene is a tumour
  suppressor gene as PTCH1 receptor inhibits smoothened (SMO), a seven-transmembrane
  G-coupled protein receptor expressed by the SMO gene located in chromosome 7q32,
  which acts as signal transducer of SHH pathway. SMO behaviour is consistent with
  a proto-oncogene. Activated SMO internalises from plasma membrane and releases GLI
  proteins from SUFU inhibition which is expressed by SUFU gene located in chromosome
  10q24-q25. GLI proteins comprise the transcription factors GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 which
  are brought into the cell nucleus. GLI1 protein is a transcriptional activator,
  while GLI2 and GLI3 proteins may function as activators or as repressors. They have
  DNA-binding zinc-fingers and activate target genes involved in cell growth and proliferation
  (PDGFRA, Fox family genes, MYC, cyclins, CTNNB1-, β-catenin- and RUNX3) (from Madan
  et al., 2010 , mod.).
