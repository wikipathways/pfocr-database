caption: The model displays the critical role of BRCA1 in vitamin D-mediated regulation
  of p21waf1 and growth inhibition (A). In the absence of BRCA1, p21 as potentially
  other mutual targets of vitamin D and BRCA1 is not fully activated and cannot mediated
  cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition (B).
