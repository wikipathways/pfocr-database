caption: 'mTORC1 activation in cancer results in increased protein translation needed
  for cell growth and proliferation (black arrows). When mTORC1 signaling is strong,
  mTORC1 activates three tumor suppressive responses (red arrows) that attenuate the
  pathway via 1] increasing PHLPP or 2] irreversibly arrest the cell by increasing
  p53. In prostate, androgen receptor (AR) is activated by RTK signaling and limits
  AKT signaling through FKBP5-mediated increase in PHLPP activity towards AKT. The
  pathway’s tumor suppressive feedbacks can be inadvertently blocked by therapeutics
  (green arrows). First, AR blockade by hormone therapy inhibits PHLPP suppression
  of AKT, thus activating AKT. Second, mTORC1-targeting kinase inhibitors such as
  rapalogs block three known negative feedbacks: S6 kinase-dependent negative feedback
  loop to PI3K signaling via RTKs, mTORC1-dependent increase in PHLPP levels, and
  mTORC1-dependent increases in p53 levels.'
