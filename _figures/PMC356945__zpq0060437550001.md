caption: Scheme of the cell–cell communication circuit. Acetate functions as the communication
  molecule. The E. coli strain used in this work produces and secretes acetate at
  a constant rate through its amino acid biosynthesis. Acetate production is proportional
  to cell growth rather than environmental conditions and metabolic state, because
  the main production pathway from AcCoA is disrupted. Acetic acid diffuses freely
  across the cell membrane and into neighboring cells. Inside the cell, acetate is
  converted to AcP by Ack. In the absence of the histidine kinase NRII, AcP phosphorylates
  the response regulator NRI.NRI≈P binds the glnA enhancer sequence and induces the
  promoter glnAp2. Because acetate is constantly produced and secreted by the cell,
  expression from glnAp2 depends on population density.
