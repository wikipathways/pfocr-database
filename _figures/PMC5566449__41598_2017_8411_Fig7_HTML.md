caption: Proposed signaling events involved in PDGF-enhanced matrix contraction. Based
  on our findings, we propose that upon PDGF-Rβ activation, activation of PKC downstream
  of PI3K and PLCγ mediates PDGF-induced cofilin dephosphorylation during PDGF-enhanced
  collagen gel contraction. These findings point to activation of slingshot (SSH)
  and/or chronophin (CIN) phosphatases downstream of PKC, which requires further investigations.
