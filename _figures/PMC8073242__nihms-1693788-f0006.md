caption: '13C-glucose carbon tracing confirms increases in glycolysis in epithelial
  cells lacking Glrx. A, Schematic for glycolysis pathway highlighting metabolites
  that are differentially regulated 24 hours poststimulation with IL1B and in airway
  basal cells lacking Glrx. Heavy metabolites are depicted as + 3 and + 6 and presented
  with hash marks. Solid color panels represent the unlabeled portion of each metabolite.
  ## Metabolites measured are hexose-6 phosphate (top) and phosphoglycerate (bottom).
  B, Levels of secreted lactate (in mM) in cell culture supernatant of airway basal
  cells. C, Schematic for metabolites in the TCA cycle. Heavy metabolites are depicted
  as + 2, +3, and + 5 and presented with hash marks. Solid color panels represent
  the unlabeled portion of each metabolite. Statistics in this figure represent only
  the heavy portion of the metabolites, with the exception of lactate in panel B.
