caption: 'Effects of regulatory proteins and metabolites on C. difficile toxin synthesis.
  The metabolites that activate each regulatory protein is indicated: FBP, Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  BCCAs, branch chain amino acids (Isoleucine, Valine, Leucine); NAD, Nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide. Alternative reductive pathways include glycine reductase (GR)
  pathway, butyrate production and succinate utilization pathway. Square boxes correspond
  to alternative σ factors while oval boxes are transcriptional regulators. Triangles
  are toxins. Arrowed lines indicate positive controls while lines ending with a bar
  across correspond to negative controls. Dashed arrows indicate mechanisms that are
  not fully understood.'
