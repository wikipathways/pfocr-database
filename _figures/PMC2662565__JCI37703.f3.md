caption: (A) Lithium directly inhibits key enzymes including IPPase and IMPase                   that
  regulate inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) recycling.                   IMPase–mediated
  catalysis represents the final step in the conversion                   of inositol
  monophosphate (IMP) to myoinositol. Thus, inhibiting IMPase can reduce                   myoinositol
  levels. The inositol depletion hypothesis proposes that IMPase                   inhibition
  interferes with PI synthesis. The PI signaling cascade starts with                   surface
  receptor activation, shown here as GPCR-mediated activation of PLC.                   Activated
  PLC catalyzes the hydrolysis of PI biphosphate (PIP2) to diacylglycerol                   (DAG)
  and IP3. DAG activates PKC, which, among many other functions, activates                   myristoylated,
  alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS). The antimanic drugs                   lithium
  and VPA both decrease levels of phosphorylated and total MARCKS. Molecules                   in
  red depict enzymes, while molecules in blue depict second messengers. PI                   signaling
  modulates other second messenger proteins including the small GTPase,                   Ras,
  and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PIP4). (B) Overview of the                   Wnt
  and GSK3 signaling pathways. Both lithium and Wnt signaling can inhibit GSK3.                   In
  the Wnt signaling pathway, Wnt glycoproteins interact with the frizzled family                   of
  receptors to stimulate the dishevelled-mediated (not shown) inactivation of                   GSK3.
  Inhibition of GSK3 prevents β-catenin phosphorylation, which                   inhibits
  its degradation and allows it to act as a transcription factor. Wnt                   proteins
  have been implicated in the regulation of neuron morphology,                   neurotransmission,
  and synaptogenesis. GSK3 is also inhibited by AKT (also known                   as
  PKB), which is activated downstream of the tropomyosin receptor B (TrkB), whose                   ligand
  is BDNF. In addition to inhibiting β-catenin, GSK3 has numerous                   other
  targets including microtubule-associated proteins, tau, GSK, and rev-erb                   α.
