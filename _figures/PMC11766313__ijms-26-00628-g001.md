caption: Mechanism of action of PDT. Exogenous ALA or MAL are taken up by cells. MAL
  needs to be hydrolysed to ALA by intracellular esterases. ALA enters the heme biosynthesis
  pathway. Within the mitochondria, glycine and succinyl-CoA are converted into ALA
  by the enzyme ALA synthetase. This step is tightly regulated by negative feedback
  from heme, preventing excessive production of intermediates. ALA progresses through
  the porphyrin biosynthetic pathway, eventually forming PpIX. In normal conditions,
  PpIX is converted into heme by ferrochelatase. However, in tumour cells, reduced
  ferrochelatase activity leads to the preferential accumulation of PpIX. Upon exposure
  to a light source (usually at 635 nm), PpIX becomes activated, leading to the generation
  of singlet oxygen (¹O₂) and other ROS, such as superoxide anion radicals (O2•−),
  hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (•OH). These ROS induce oxidative
  damage to cellular structures, resulting in selective tumour cell death
