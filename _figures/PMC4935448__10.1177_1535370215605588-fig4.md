  miRNAs regulated in macrophages and monocytes. Targets of miRNA were hypothesized
  by published literature as described in text.  denotes negative regulation resulting
  in target molecules which may be down-regulated (in green) and  denotes a positive
  regulation resulting in target molecules which may be up-regulated (red). (a) Patients
  treated with 20 mg simvastatin/day had increased circulating miR-15a, miR-21, and
  miR-33a. miR-15a was shown to target and inhibit CDC25A, a cell-cycle regulator
  known for G1 to S phase progression. miR-21 has been shown to potentiate expression
  of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein. The balance of miR-15a and miR-21 expression
  in the liver may determine deterimental effects on its proliferation. (b) In addition
  to miR-15a and miR-21, mir-192 and miR-30b were up-regulated in patients receiving
  ubiquinol supplementation and in HepG2 cell lines. Their roles in proliferation
  and anti-apoptosis might be one possible mechanism of hepatoprotection and observed
  by reduced ALP and ALT. (c) In the circulation, miR-146a, miR-15a, and miR-21 were
  up-regulated in patients treated with simvastatin supplementated with ubiquinol.
  Consistent with its anti-inflammatory function, miRNAs regulated with ubiquinol
  supplementation reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (NFKB) and increase anti-inflammatory
  cytokines (e.g., IL-10). miR-146a target molecules in the innate immune response
  (TLR4 signaling) pathway, directly targeting IRAK1 and TRAF6.IRAK1: interleukin-1
  receptor-associated kinase; TRAF6: tumor necrosis factor receptor-assicated family;
