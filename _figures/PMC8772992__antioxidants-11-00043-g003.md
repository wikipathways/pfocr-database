caption: 'Intracellular metabolic pathway of retinoid in the liver: The all-trans-retinol
  binds to cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) and is esterized by lecithin retinol
  acyltransferase (LRAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1, DGAT2) for intracellular
  storage, whereas retinol bound with retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) is transported
  into other tissues via blood circulation. Retinol is oxidized into all-trans-retinoic
  acid in the liver via two stages as follows: The reversible oxidation/reduction
  between retinol and retinal is regulated by three kinds of enzymes: (i) retinal
  dehydrogenases (RDH5, RDH10, RDH11), (ii) alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH1A, ADH1B,
  ADH1C); and (iii) membrane-bound short-chain dehydrogenases (DHRS3, DHRS4). The
  irreversible oxidation of retinal to all-trans-retinoic acid is maintained by retinaldehyde
  dehydrogenases 1 (ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3). All-trans-retinoic acid, which
  binds to cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins (CRABP1 and CRABP2), is eliminated
  from the body by the cytochrome P450 (CYP26A1 and CYP26B1)-dependent oxidation.
  After entering the nucleus, all-trans-retinoic acid binds to a retinoic acid receptor/retinoic
  X receptor (RAR/RXR) heterodimer and stimulates transcription of target genes. In
  NAFL and NASH, the (+) symbol means an increased expression of aldo-keto reductase
  1 B10 (AKR1B10), whereas the (−) symbol means a reduced expression of retinaldehyde
  dehydrogenase 1. Provitamin A is metabolized to all-trans-retinal by β-carotene
  15,15′-monooxygenase 1 (BCMO-1) in vitamin A deficient states such as NAFL and NASH.'
