caption: Recognition of pathogens by cytosolic PRRs. (A) As an example, NOD1 is shown.
  NOD1 is activated by peptidoglycan-derived peptides. The carboxy-terminal LRR domain
  is involved in agonist recognition, whereas the central NOD (NACHT) domain has ATPase
  activity and facilitates self-oligomerization. At the amino-terminal a protein-protein
  interaction mediating caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) is localized (one CARD domain
  in NOD1, two in NOD2). Recruitment of the kinase-activity containing adaptor molecule
  RICK transmits the signal to the NF-κB pathway and it may also participate in MAPK
  stimulation. (B) The cytosolic PRRs MDA5 and RIG-I recognize dsRNA leading to a
  complex signalling pathway involving molecules like IPS-1, Rip, FADD promoting NF-κB
  activation, whereas IPS, TBK and IKKi mediate IRF3 activation.
