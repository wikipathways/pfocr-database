caption: Proposed cellular stress mechanisms by which prenatal drug exposure can adversely
  affect brain development and neurobehavioral outcomes. Psychostimulants (cocaine
  and METH) can elevate dopamine levels and subsequently trigger ER and oxidative
  stress signaling pathways or, alternatively, cocaine and METH can activate Sig-1R
  or cytochrome P450 and trigger ER and oxidative stress in that manner. Similarly,
  nicotine/NNK can induce oxidative ER stress via regulations of dopamine releases
  and microglial activities. Opioids can cause apoptosis and astrocytosis through
  ER stress-autophagy axis pathway. Cellular responses to prenatal drug exposure,
  including cytotoxicity, astrocytosis, microglial activation, altered neurogenesis,
  and synaptic plasticity, can ultimately lead to behavioral consequences of abnormal
  brain development. Drug-mediated pathways are depicted in designated colors. Solid
  arrows indicate the pathway confirmed with in vivo or in vitro neural models whereas
  dashed arrows indicate studies conducted in non-neural systems. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)
