caption: The involvement of Ku70 as a cytosolic DNA sensor to activate the innate
  immune response. Ku70 is identified as a cytosolic DNA sensor that induces type
  III IFNs through a STING-TBK1-IRF3, IRF1, and IRF7 signaling pathway. In this signaling
  pathway, cytoplasmic translocation of Ku70 is an initial and essential step (black
  arrows) (; ; ); Ku70 and Ku80, together with DNA-PKcs (DNA-PK), are also involved
  in a STING-dependent () (solid arrow) and STING-independent () (dashed arrow) pathway
  to induce type I IFNs (red arrows). Ku70 is reported to sense HTLV-1 transcription
  intermediate product ssDNA90 and interacts with STING to induce IFNs and inflammatory
  cytokines, thereby modulating HTLV-1 replication () (brown arrows). The Ku70/80
  heterodimer recognizes HBV-infection-derived DNA, then activates DNA-PKcs and PARP1
  to induce CCL3 and CCL5 inflammatory cytokines () (green arrows). DNA-PK (the complex
  of DNA-PKcs, Ku70, and Ku80) senses aging-related cytoplasmic DNA in CD4+ T cells.
  This DNA sensing then induces T-cell proliferation and activation, as well as autoimmunity
  through the ZAK-AKT-mTOR pathway () (blue arrows). This illustration was created
  by using BioRender.
