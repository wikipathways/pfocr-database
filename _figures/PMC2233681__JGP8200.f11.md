caption: Model for KATP channel regulation by PIP2, MgADP, and phosphorylation. In
  this model, channels are formed by Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits, which have regulatory
  sites for PIP2 and MgADP, respectively. (A) States 1 and 2 represent two physiological
  states in intact cells, which differ by their PIP2regulatory site occupancy. The
  distribution between these two states is determined by the cellular level of PIP2.
  The other four states result from rundown that occurs via alternate pathways (A–C)
  after patch excision. States 1–3 have similar high P o and occupancy of one or both
  regulatory sites causes maximum channel activation (high P o). Only State 4, which
  has both regulatory sites free, exhibits a low P o. The low P o of State 4 accounts,
  at least in part, for its high ATP sensitivity, and the high P o in the other states
  accounts for their low ATP sensitivity (see text for explanation). After dissociation
  of MgADP (pathway A), the transition from State 1 to State 3 has little effect on
  channel activity, since both states have similar P o, only transition from State
  2 to 4 leads to fast rundown. Transition from State 1 to 3 and 4 leads to slow rundown
  due to loss of PIP2 (pathway C). In this case, the loss of PIP2 (State 3 to 4) is
  much slower than the loss of MgADP (State 1 to 3) and is, therefore, the rate-limiting
  step. Another form of rundown occurs as a result of dephosphorylation (pathway B).
  Dephosphorylation induces loss of MgADP-dependent reactivation of ATP-inhibited
  channels and is taken as evidence for functional uncoupling of SUR1 and Kir6.2.
  In the model, this is represented by the transitions from State 3 to 5 and from
  State 4 to 6. The effect of dephosphorylation-induced uncoupling on P o and ATP
  sensitivity may be only apparent in the absence of PIP2-dependent regulation (transitions
  from State 2 to 4 to 6) and have minor effects when PIP2 regulates channel activity
  (transitions from State 1 to 3 to 5). Dephosphorylation may also have a long-term
  effect and cause deactivation of a PIP2regulatory site, facilitating the component
  of slow rundown related to loss of PIP2 (pathway C). Lastly, not shown in this scheme,
  further rundown of States 5 and 6 leads to complete and irreversible channel closure,
  possibly after extensive Kir6.2 dephosphorylation. (B) In addition to decreasing
  the sensitivity to ATP by increasing P o, PIP2 may affect directly the binding of
  ATP to Kir6.2. This dramatic effect (sensitivity to ATP as low as 5 mM) occurs after
  prolonged exposure to PIP2 and is independent of the rundown state of the channel.
  Under physiological conditions, such a decrease in binding affinity may be restricted
  to States 2–5, so that KATP channels remain sensitive to adenine nucleotides.
