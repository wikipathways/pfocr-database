caption: The SARS-CoV-2 life cycle inside its host cell; starts when the S protein
  binding occurs with the ACE2 receptor. After the binding process, the S protein
  changes enable the fusion of the viral envelope via the cell membrane’s endosomal
  pathway. Then the RNA is released from the SARS-CoV-2 inside the host cell. The
  translation of the RNA genome into the viral replicase polyproteins, which produces
  various viral particles. A sequence of sub-genomic mRNAs are produced by discontinuous
  transcription and, at last, get translated into viral proteins. These viral proteins
  and RNA genome are organized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi’s virions, which
  are further transported through the vesicles, and finally, exocytosis occurs
