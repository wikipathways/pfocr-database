caption: After receptor-mediated endocytosis, flavivirus reaches the endosome where
  its membrane fuses with the endosomal membrane (step 1). This step releases the
  nucleocapsid into the cytosol where it is uncoated. The naked positive-sense RNA
  genome is co-translationally translocated on the ER by the Sec61 translocon (step
  2), generating a single polyprotein which, after cleavage, produces three structural
  proteins (C, prM, and E), as well as seven non-structural proteins (NSPs) (step
  3); the EMC supports biosynthesis of some of the NSPs. Importantly, the NSPs create
  a replication organelle in the ER that promotes replication of the viral genomic
  RNA (gRNA) (step 4). The replicated gRNA is packaged with the C protein to form
  the nucleocapsid which assembles with the viral prM and E membrane proteins on the
  ER membrane, thereby generating a new progeny that exits the ER (step 5). The new
  viral particle reaches the Golgi (step 6) and uses the classic secretory pathway
  to undergo egress.
