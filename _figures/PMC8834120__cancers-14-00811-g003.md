caption: The classical PIP3/AKT-dependent manner of PDK1 activation pathway in BC.
  Elevated PIP3 induced by growth factors or hormones recruits PDK1 and AKT and simultaneously
  binds with them through their PH domains, which enhances the interaction between
  the two allosteric proteins, resulting in a conformational change in AKT and PDK1.
  This dynamic change makes AKT more prone to phosphorylation at the site Thr308 by
  PDK1, which is modulated by the rictor–mTOR complex (mTORC2) via phosphorylating
  AKT on Ser473 of the HM.
