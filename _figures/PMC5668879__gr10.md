caption: Proposed effect of polyP and retinol on the expression of the fatty acid
  binding protein 4 (FABP4) and leptin/leptin receptor. It has been proposed that
  polyP acts via the MAPK signaling route (p38) MAPK pathway and/or the mTOR complexes
  1 and 2. The FABP4 expression might include the transcription factor Ets1. This
  pathway acts positively on the FABP4 expression level that is correlated with the
  polyP/DLL4-NOTCH signaling pathway as well as with Foxo1. VEGFA (vascular endothelial
  growth factor) induces, after binding to its receptor (VEGFAR) and activation of
  DLL4 (delta-like ligand-4), the paracrine activation of NOTCH signaling, resulting
  in FABP4 expression. Intermediately, the intracellular domain (NICD) of the NOTCH
  receptor translocates to the nucleus and bind to the transcription factor complex,
  composed of Foxo1 and the DNA-binding protein RBP-Jκ, through which FABP4 transcription
  is induced. FABP4 protein migrates into the cytoplasm and binds RA (retinoic acid).
  It is proposed that RA with FABP4 re-enters the nucleus and forms the RXR–RAR (retinoid
  X receptor-retinoic acid receptor heterodimer). In this transcription complex, at
  the RA response element (RARE), the genes encoding for leptin and leptin receptor
  are increasingly transcribed. RA is synthesized via retinol (Rol), that is taken
  up by the cells via STRA6 (membrane transporter) where it is bound to CRBP (cellular
  retinol-binding protein), undergoes oxidation by the ADH4 (alcohol dehydrogenase
  4) to RAL (retinal) and finally to RA, which is finally translocated via CRABP (a
  retinoic acid-binding protein) to the nucleus where it binds at the RARE (retinoic
  acid response element) of the DNA under formation of the RXR/RAR complex. In conclusion,
  polyP causes an upregulation of the binding protein FABP4 which accelerates the
  retinol effect on the expression of leptin and leptin receptor. These two arms,
  FABP4 increased synthesis and RAR transcriptional promoting activity, positively
  affect cell differentiation and re-epithelization.
