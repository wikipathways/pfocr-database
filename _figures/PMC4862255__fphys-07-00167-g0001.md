caption: Signaling pathways of sarco-KATP and mito-KATP channels in skeletal muscle.
  Hypoxia-induced lowering of ATP/ADP/AMP ratio activates mito-KATP channel with mito-swelling,
  inhibition of succinic dehydrogenase(SDH) of complex II, ATP synthesis, inhibition
  of glycogen-synthase-kinase-3beta(GSK3β), closure of the mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore(MPTP). The high ATP/ADP/AMP ratio activates the phosphatidylinositol-3
  kinase/protein kinase B /mammalian target of rapamycin complex1(mtorC1) (PI3K/Akt/mtorC1)
  pathway. The AMP-activated protein-kinase(AMPK) inhibits mtorC1 and activates forkhead
  box protein O(FOXO). The lowering of ATP/ADP ratio following fatigue activates the
  sarco-KATP channels with improved post-fatigue recovery. In slow twitch fibers,
  protein kinase C(PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases(ERK) may activates
  sarco-KATP and mito-KATP channels with cytoprotection. Continuous line indicates
  activation, dashed line inhibition.
