caption: Schematic depiction of the autophagic‐lysosome pathway. Protein aggregates
  and damaged mitochondria are selectively targeted for autophagy via ubiquitin (Ub)‐labelled
  adaptor proteins (eg p62, Nix and NBR1). Autophagy occurs when the autophagy receptors
  bind cargoes with LC3 to initiate substrate sequestration in the forming autophagosome.
  Matured autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes containing hydrolytic enzymes for cargo
  degradation. When the degradation is complete inside the autolysosome, the lysosomes
  regain their original properties via lysosome re‐formation. The lysosome comprises
  a specific set of luminal and integral‐membrane proteins. The acidification of the
  lysosome is maintained by the vacuolar‐H+ ATPase and the lysosomal membrane, which
  contains highly glycosylated lysosome‐associated membrane proteins (LAMPs), ion
  channels and transporters, and cholesterol transporters. Moreover, the biogenesis
  and function of lysosomes are also regulated by transcription factors such as TFEB.
  As terminal degradation stations, normal morphology and function of lysosomes are
  essential for successful completion of autophagic degradation
