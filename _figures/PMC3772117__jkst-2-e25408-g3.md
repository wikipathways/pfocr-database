caption: Figure 3. Super-competitors. Super-competitor status can be confirmed by
  sustained activation of Wg signaling through β-catenin/Armadillo (β-Cat/Arm) or
  of JAK-STAT signaling (STATP). It can also be achieved through increased ribosome
  biogenesis, increased Yki expression, which activates the dmyc gene, or through
  increased dMyc levels. All of these lead to cells (super-competitors) that non-autonomously
  induce death of neighboring wild-type cells (losers).
