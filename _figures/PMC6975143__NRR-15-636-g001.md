caption: 'The unfolded protein response (UPR).Under normal conditions PERK, IRE1,
  and ATF6α are sequestered in an inactive state in the ER via their associations
  with BiP. BiP dissociates from the ER stress transducers in the presence of high
  levels of unfolded or misfolded proteins, leading to the UPR activation. The PERK
  pathway: Following BiP dissociation PERK becomes active through oligomerization
  and autophosphorylation. p-PERK then phosphorylates eIF2α which reduces ER load
  by decreasing global protein synthesis. p-eIF2α also preferentially stimulates the
  translation of ATF4, which enhances the expression of cytoprotective genes, autophagy-related
  genes, and ERAD-related genes. The IRE1 pathway: IRE1 becomes active after BiP dissociation
  through oligomerization and autophosphorylation. p-IRE1 splices XBP1 mRNA to generate
  sXBP1, a transcription factor that stimulates the expression of chaperones and genes
  involved in ER expansion, ERAD, autophagy, and cytoprotection. p-IRE1 also reduces
  ER load through the degradation of mRNA via RIDD. The ATF6α pathway: After BiP dissociation
  ATF6α transits to the Golgi complex where it is cleaved by the proteases S1P and
  S2P. cATF6α then migrates to the nucleus where is stimulates the expression of chaperons,
  autophagy-related genes, ERAD-related genes, and cytoprotective genes. “ ↑ ”: Increase;
