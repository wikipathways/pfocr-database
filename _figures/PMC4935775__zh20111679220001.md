caption: Model of Na+-Cl− cotransporter (NCC) regulation by the cullin-3 (CUL3)/kelch-like
  3 (KLHL3)-with no lysine (WNK)-STE20/SPS-1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK)/oxidative
  stress response kinase (OSR1) pathway. NCC is phosphorylated at several residues
  by the kinases SPAK and OSR1, which leads to its activation. SPAK and OSR1 are phosphorylated
  and activated by WNK kinases. Ubiquitination of WNK kinases by an E3 ubiquitin (Ub)
  ligase complex consisting of a scaffold protein (CUL3), a substrate adaptor (KLHL3),
  and a ubiquitin ligase (RING) tags them for proteasomal degradation, decreasing
  their abundance. According to this scheme, high WNK abundance stimulates NCC, leading
  to NaCl retention, whereas reduced WNK kinase abundance decreases NCC activation,
  reducing NaCl retention. Only WNK4 is shown since current data suggest it is the
  major WNK regulating NCC along the distal convoluted tubule, although WNK1 may also
  play a role under certain conditions.
