caption: Transcriptional regulation of the β-ketoadipate pathway in ADP1. Endogenously
  generated CCM interacts with the regulatory proteins CatM and BenM to regulate gene
  expression as shown. BenM additionally responds to benzoate to activate benABCDE
  and catA expression (not depicted). BenM- or CatM-mediated repression of pcaU expression
  should prevent or lower PcaU-activated gene expression (shown at the bottom). A
  thick (+) or thin (−) open arrow indicates that the adjacent regulator, together
  with its cognate effector, increases or decreases gene expression, respectively.
  The question mark indicates the untested possibility that PcaU regulates additional
  genes that affect pobA expression.
