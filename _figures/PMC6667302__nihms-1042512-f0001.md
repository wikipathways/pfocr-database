caption: 'In S. enterica and other bacterial Cba producers the AP-P synthesis reactions
  are performed by two separate enzymes, PduX and CobD (boxed pathway). In M. mazei,
  both reactions are performed by the MmCobD enzyme (oval). AP-P is attached to AdoCby,
  which is produced de novo from uroporphyrinogen III or transported into the cell.
  For the laboratory experiments described here, cobyric acid dicyanide [(CN)2Cby]
  was added to the growth medium. (CN)2Cby is de-cyanated by an unknown mechanism
  in S. enterica and adenosylated by an adenosyltransferase (CobA). AdoCby enters
  the pathway as indicated where AP-P is attached by the adenosylcobinamide-phosphate
  synthase, CbiB. AdoCbl is the final product of the pathway. Abbreviations: L-Thr;
