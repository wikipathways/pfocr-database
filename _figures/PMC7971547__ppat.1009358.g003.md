caption: A. fumigatus hyphae induce canonical inflammasome activation after recognition
  by the CLR and TLR pathways, which is dependent on ROS production and potassium
  efflux. SYK activation initiates the formation of a supramolecular CARD9–Bcl-10–MALT1
  complex to drive MAPKs and NF-κB signaling and induce inflammasome priming. Parallelly,
  SYK regulates ROS production to mediate the canonical activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  The NF-κB pathway regulates the expression of IRF1, and the TLR pathway mediates
  efficient activation of IRF1 after recognition of A. fumigatus via the adaptor molecules
  MyD88 and TRIF. IRF1 expression and activation induce IRGB10 and ZBP1 expression.
  IRGB10 targets the fungal cell surface and causes hyphae damage, inhibiting A. fumigatus
  growth and releasing GAG, β-1,3-glucan, and dsDNA to activate the inflammasome.
  GAG interacts with ribosomes to block translation, inducing ER stress and NLRP3
  inflammasome activation, whereas A. fumigatus dsDNA is recognized by the AIM2 inflammasome.
