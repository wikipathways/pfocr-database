caption: Proposed mechanism of the osmotic stress response in S. cerevisiae. The CWI
  pathway is activated in response to hypoosmotic stress, leading to the dual phosphorylation
  of Slt2/Mpk1. The HOG pathway is activated in response to hyperosmotic stress conditions
  and leads to activation of the transcription factor Rlm1.
