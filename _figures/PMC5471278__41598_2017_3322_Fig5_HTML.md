caption: 'Regulatory network model of DNA replication coupled with nicotinamide. (a)
  The colors of the border and inside circle indicate the expression levels of transcriptome
  and proteome data, respectively. Gray edge indicates the protein-protein interaction
  based on the STRING database, whereas the arrows and inhibition symbols represent
  the activation and repression information. Nodes with asterisks indicate that the
  protein was assessed by only western blotting without the use of proteome data.
  There is no significant difference regarding the expression level if the color of
  the node is gray. Blue circle clustering highlights the complex enzymes of proteins.
  (b) Proposed model of nicotinamide-induced DNA replication interaction network.
  Networks are represented to reflect proteome, transcriptome and western blotting.
  Red indicates increased expression, blue indicates decreased expression and gray
  indicates no significant difference. Abbreviations: ac - acetylation, p - phosphorylation,
  WB - western blot.'
