caption: Overview of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad-signalling pathway.
  At the cell surface, binding of TGF-β ligand to the constitutively active Type II
  receptor recruits the Type I receptor into the complex where it is phosphorylated.
  The activated Type I receptor then phosphorylates Smad 2 or 3 which are recruited
  there by SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation) at the C-terminal serines. Activin
  also phosphorylates Smads 2/3, while BMPs phosphorylate Smads 1/5/8. The receptor-activated
  Smads then complex with the common mediator Smad4 and this complex translocates
  to the nucleus where it regulates transcription of target genes and binds to a variety
  of transcription factors (TFs). Activation of R-Smads by Type I receptor kinases
  is inhibited by Smad6 for the BMP pathway and Smad7 for the TGF-β/activin pathway.
  The E3 ubiquitin ligases Smurfs 1 and 2 which degrade the R-Smads also interact
  with Smads 6/7 and ubiquitinate the Type I receptors.
