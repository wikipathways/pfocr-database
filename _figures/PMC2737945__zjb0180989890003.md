caption: 'Proposed metabolic model for syntrophic growth of D. vulgaris Hildenborough.
  Colors indicate transcriptional changes in individual genes during coculture growth
  compared with a sulfate-limited monoculture. The lactate permease is encoded by
  DVU3026. Abbreviations: Ldh, lactate dehydrogenase (likely DVU3027); ECred and ECox,
  reduced and oxidized unknown electron carrier interacting with Ldh, respectively;
  Por, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (DVU3025); Pta, phosphate acetyltransferase
  (DVU3029); Ack, acetate kinase (DVU3030); Aor, aldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase
  (DVU1179); Adh, alcohol dehydrogenase (DVU2405); Hdr, putative heterodisulfide reductase
  (DVU2399 to DVU2404); Fdred and Fdox, reduced and oxidized ferredoxin, respectively;
  Coo, cytoplasmic hydrogenase (DVU2286 to DVU2293); Hmc, high-molecular-weight cytochrome
  complex (DVU0531 to DVU0536); Hyn1, [Ni-Fe] hydrogenase isozyme 1 (DVU1921 and DVU1922);
  Hyd, [Fe] hydrogenase (DVU1769 and DVU1770); CoA, coenzyme A. The red box indicates
  unique lactate oxidation enzymes that function during syntrophic growth. The orange
  box indicates the proposed hypothetical pathway for ethanol production (via hydrogen
  consumption).'
