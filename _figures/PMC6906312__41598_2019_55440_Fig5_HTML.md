caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of differential metabolites of POD7 in GIK
  and TPN group, respectively. (A,B) Analysis based on the comparison in POD 7 compared
  to POD 1 of TPN (A) and GIK (B) group, respectively. Rectangle represented elevated
  (red) or decreased (green) metabolites. The peripheral represented metabolic pathways.
  The central circle represented signaling complex or group. The full and dotted line
  represented direct (full) and indirect (dotted) correlation to signaling. The full
  line in purple represented the direct correlation between metabolic pathways and
  metabolites.
