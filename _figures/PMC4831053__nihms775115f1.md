caption: A. Presynaptic glutamate release and depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron
  lead to calcium elevation in the postsynaptic cell. Glutamate is required for activation
  of NMDA receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and depolarization is required
  for activation of NMDA receptors and voltage-dependent calcium channels. The particular
  mechanism employed depends on the cell type.B. Signaling pathways leading to kinase
  activation and AMPAR phosphorylation. Only a subset of the known pathways is illustrated,
  and not all pathways are involved in all neurons. Calcium activates CaMKII, which
  phosphoryolates the AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit, leading to increased numbers of
  AMPA receptors. CaMKII can be persistently activated by autophosphorylation, , which
  occurs when two adjacent subunits are bound to calcium-calmodulin. This persistently
  active form of CaMKII is most strongly implicated in hippocampal LTP. Dopamine (D1)
  and β-adrenergic receptors, , coupled to GS or Golf, contribute to LTP by activating
  adenylyl cyclase, while other dopamine (D2) receptors and muscarinic acetylcholine
  (M2, M4) receptors inhibit adenylyl cyclase. The cAMP produced by adenylyl cyclase
  activates PKA which subsequently phosphorylates AMPA receptor GluR1 subunits and
  either DARPP32 (dopamine and cAMP regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa) or inhibitor-1,
  , which decrease phosphatase activity to allow persistence or enhancement of phosphorylation
  of AMPA receptors. Some types of muscarinic acetylcholine (M1) receptors and metabotropic
  glutamate receptors are coupled to phospholipase C (PLC), which produces diacylglycerol
  (DAG) and inositol triphosphate. Typical forms of PKC are activated by binding to
  both calcium and DAG. ERK is activated by a pathway involving tyrosine kinase receptors
  via the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway, and is necessary for the gene transcription and protein
  translation that underlies persistent forms of synaptic plasticity. In addition,
  ERK can be indirectly activated by PKC, EPAC, calcium and PKA.C. For late-phase
  LTP and memory storage, a combination of synaptic inputs and neuronal activity leads
  to AMPA receptor phosphorylation, gene transcription, and protein translation.
