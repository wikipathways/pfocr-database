caption: Activated cells take up large amounts of glucose and glutamine and divert
  them to the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) and lipid biosynthesis, respectively.
  Coupled to an increased uptake of glycine, serine and branched chain amino acids
  (leucine, isoleucine and valine), which are required for protein synthesis, this
  diversion generates sufficient building blocks (nucleic acids, proteins and membranes)
  for proliferation. The increased generation of reactive oxygen species requires
  appropriate levels of antioxidants, most of which originate from the PPP. These
  metabolic changes generate bioactive metabolites that are secreted, and that also
  contribute to cell activation. Numerous signalling pathways are involved in metabolic
  changes in activated cells,. 3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; A-KG, α-ketoglutarate; AKT,
