caption: The ‘Ca. A. nitratireducens’ enrichment culture utilized an alkylsuccinate
  synthase to activate propane to n- and iso-propylsuccinate. Acetyl-CoA is produced
  after carbon-skeleton rearrangement, decarboxylation and beta-oxidation. Acetyl-CoA
  oxidation to CO2 is catalysed by enzymes involved in the oxidative tricarboxylic
  acid cycle or reverse Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (purple labels). ‘Ca. A. nitratireducens’
  harboured all the enzymes involved in denitrification (NapAB, NorB, NosZ, except
  NirS/K) and DNRA processes (NapAB, NrfAH) (green text). Normalized gene expression
  for ‘Ca. A. nitratireducens’ is indicated as TPM (total transcripts per million).
  Increasing line thickness shows increasing gene expression values. Enzymes labelled
  in blue, green, purple and bold text were fully or partially identified in the protein
  extracts, while red text indicates enzymes were not detected. Alkylsuccinate synthase,
