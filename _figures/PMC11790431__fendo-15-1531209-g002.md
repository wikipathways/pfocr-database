caption: 'Glucosamine as a novel pathogenic factor in DPN. (A) Schematic representation
  of glycolysis and collateral glucose-utilizing pathways in Schwann cells. (B) Regardless
  of the presence or absence of polyol pathways, increased glucosamine uptake into
  Schwann cells under diabetic conditions, through a specific mechanism, may impair
  the insulin signaling pathway and reduce ATP synthesis. Additionally, glucosamine
  can be metabolized into glucosamine-6-phosphate (Glucosamine-6-P), a key intermediate
  in the hexosamine pathway, which may further contribute to impaired insulin signaling.
  These abnormalities may play a significant role in the development of DPN. Abbreviations:
  Glucose-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; Fructose-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; Glyceraldehyde-3-P,
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; AR, aldose reductase; AGEs, advanced glycation endproducts;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; UDP-GlcNAc, uridine diphosphate N-acetyl-D-glucosamine;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; α-Glycerol-P, α-glycerol-phosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  pS6RP, phospho-S6 ribosomal protein'
