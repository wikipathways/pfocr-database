caption: Proposed effects of salubrinal on the xenotoxicant-activated ER stress signaling
  pathways. Following exposure to xenotoxicants, ER stress activates the double-stranded
  RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK)/eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) pathway and the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)/tumor
  necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) pathway, which are the two
  branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The enhancement or prolongation
  of eIF2α phosphorylation by salubrinal reduces global protein synthesis and the
  overall amount of ER stress, resulting in cell survival. In contrast to most proteins,
  the expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is up-regulated through
  alternative translation and thus not impacted by the reduction in protein synthesis.
  The ATF4 protein balances between the signals leading to survival (by 78-kDa glucose-regulated
  protein (GRP78) and other UPR targets) and to apoptosis (by CCAAT/enhancer-binding
  protein homologous protein (CHOP)). Salubrinal might act on the IRE1/TRAF2 pathway
  that leads to the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)/c-Jun
  NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated, ASK1/p38-mediated, and caspase-12-dependent
  apoptotic pathways.
