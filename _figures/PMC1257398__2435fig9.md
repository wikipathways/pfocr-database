caption: Proposed mechanism by which FOXO1 regulates the sensitivity of the InR signaling
  pathway through a feedback mechanism that involves up-regulation of InR and IRS-2
  upon fasting. When nutrients are high, the InR pathway turns down FOXO1 activity
  and the levels of InR and IRS-2 drop, dampening the signaling through the InR pathway.
  When nutrient conditions change, FOXO1 is active and it sensitizes the pathway by
  activating the transcription of InR and IRS-2.
