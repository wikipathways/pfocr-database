caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of action of MSU and PMA to stimulate
  neutrophils to form NETs. Stimulation of neutrophils with MSU and PMA resulted in
  the activation of the Ras-Raf-ERK signaling pathway and generated ROS. MPO and NE
  released from cytoplasmic granules are transported into the nucleus, contributing
  to the unfolding of chromatin and citrullination of histones. Subsequently, the
  nuclear envelope ruptures, releasing chromatin and forming DNA-backbone networks
  (called NETs) outside the cell. After the use of pathway inhibitors, NET formation
  could be inhibited to a certain extent
