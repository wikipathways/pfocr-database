caption: The main potential molecular mechanism of the antitumour effect of anthocyanins
  in vitro. Cancer cell growth might be inhibited by anthocyanidins through targeting
  RTKs (e.g. EGFR, PDGFR and VEGF/VEGFR) and acting on the Ras‐MAPK and PI3K/Akt signal
  cascade pathway. Inflammation might also be inhibited by anthocyanins through acting
  on the PI3K/Akt and NF‐κB pathway to suppress the expression of COX‐2 and iNOS and
  prevent cancer by regulating the expression of phase II antioxidant enzymes to achieve
  antioxidation through the Nrf2/ARE signalling system. During cancer initiation,
  anthocyanins might prevent malignant transformation by targeting the MAPK pathway
  and AP‐1 factor and by inhibiting RTK activity. Anthocyanins can initiate the expression
  of p21 and p27, whose products can combine with multiple cyclin‐CDKs to down‐regulate
  the expression of CDK‐1 and CDK‐2, further inhibiting the expression of cyclin‐B,
  cyclin−A and cyclin–E, which promote the expression of CDK inhibitors and induce
  cancer cells to arrest at the G0/G1 and G2/M stages. During cancer development,
  anthocyanins can induce apoptosis of cancer cells by activating caspases, mediated
  by ROS and JNK/p38‐MAPK. In addition, anthocyanins might exert their anti‐metastatic
  activities by targeting the VEGF signalling pathway and extracellular matrix degradation
  (via MMP2, MMP9, uPA).
