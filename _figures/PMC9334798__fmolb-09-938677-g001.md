caption: Pathways associated with ferroptosis in cells. PTEN promotes lipid peroxidation
  and ferroptosis by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. System Xc−, composed of
  SLC3A2 and SLC7A11, is an important structure that helps synthesize GSH. GSH promotes
  GPX4 to inhibit ferroptosis. In this pathway, T53 and ATF3 acting on SLC7A11, RSL3
  and FINs acting on GPX4, and Erastin and IFN-γ acting on System Xc-are important
  inhibitors that are conducive to ferroptosis. Also, CD44v and MUC1-C acting on System
  Xc-promote GPX4 synthesis. P62-KEAP1-NRF2 goes against ferroptosis by increasing
  NQO1, HO-1, and FTH1. Fe3+ binds to transferrin and enters cells through TFR1, which
  is reduced to Fe2+ and released from DMT1-mediated endosomes. Plasma lipid peroxidation
  is induced by the Fenton reaction process. PUFA is activated by ACSL4 and LPCAT3
  and catalyzed by POR and ALOXs to promote ROS accumulation. The HIF2α-HILPDA axis,
  PKCβ II, and ionizing radiation both positively regulate ferroptosis, in which PKCβ
  II and ionizing radiation acted on ACSL4. AMPK fights ferroptosis by promoting ACC
  phosphorylation. E-cadherin activates the NF2-Hippo pathway and then inhibits YAP
  expression. Therefore, TFRC and ACSL4 are also inhibited, resulting in tumor cells
  growing and metastasizing more quickly. FSP1 inhibits ferroptosis by reducing CoQ10.
  In mitochondria, Erastin induces lipid peroxidation in both VDACs and mitochondrial
  potential hyperpolarization. GLS2 helps Gln transform into Glu, which enters the
  TCA cycle to promote ROS production. Besides, DHODH inhibits ferroptosis.
