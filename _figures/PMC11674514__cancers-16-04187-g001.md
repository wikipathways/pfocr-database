caption: IL6 classical and trans-signaling activation pathways. Membrane-bound IL6
  receptors (mbIL6R) are present in immune cells. mbIL6R are cleaved by A Disintegrin
  and Metalloproteinases-10 (ADAM10) or ADAM17 and shed as soluble IL6 receptors (sIL6R)
  shedding of mbIL6R. Membrane-bound Glycoprotein-130 (mbGp130) is ubiquitously expressed
  by all cells. Soluble Gp-130 (sGp130) is formed by shedding of mbGp130. IL6 binds
  to (1) mbIL6R to activate the classical signaling pathway, (2) sIL6R to initiate
  the trans-signaling pathway, or (3) trans-presented by dendritic cells (DCs) through
  mbIL6R. Classical signaling and trans-signaling initiate the same signaling cascade;
  however, due to diversity in cellular presentation, they have an anti-inflammatory
  or pro-inflammatory effect, respectively [16]
