  The effect of PKM2 is currently considered to be the interception of glucose metabolism
  and the metabolic pathway is transferred to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
  the uronic acid pathway (UAP), the polyol pathway (PYP), etc. for the synthesis
  of the subsequent five-carbon ribose and non-essential amino acids. The TCA circle
  is backed up by fatty acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, and its main purpose
  is to provide raw materials for the synthesis of non-essential amino acids, and
  the secondary purpose is to supply REDOX equivalents []. Although the classic glutathione
  replenishment pathway is well known. But there are more similar pathways in tumor
  cells which marked with blue text in the picture. PKM2 can be replenished by many
  amino acids such as alanine (Ala), cysteine (Cys), glycine (Gly), threonine (Thr),
  tryptophan (Try), etc. Although Ac-CoA mainly relies on fatty acid metabolism for
  supply, it can also be replenished by some amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine,
  tryptophan etc. The tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) serves as the focal point for
  the metabolism of the three major metabolic processes, the amino acid is also the
  most abundant in its form of replenishment. For example, a variety of amino acids
  such as aspartic acid, arginine, glutamic acid, glutamine, histidine, isoleucine,
  methionine, phenylalanine, proline, tyrosine, threonine, valine etc. can complement
  the eight intermediate metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). In the
  three major metabolic processes, the REDOX equivalents produced will converge in
  the mitochondria and eventually promote the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) of
  the electron transport chain, while protecting the mitochondrial function of the
  tumor cells, also providing the cells with a large amount of adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) required for survival as well []. REDOX equivalents marked with purple text
