caption: 'Immune responses induced by radiotherapy. Radiotherapy induces both immune
  stimulative and immune suppressive responses. Left side: radiotherapy (RT) causes
  immunogenic cell death (ICD), which releases HMGB1 and ATP, and expresses calreticulin.
  ICD recruits and activates DC in the tumour microenvironment, resulting in cytotoxic
  T cell activation. DNA double-strand breaks generate micronuclei, which activate
  the cGAS–STING pathway, which then upregulates the release of type I IFN. Right
  side: RT recruits immune suppressors, such as M2 tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs),
  myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). As a mechanism
  of PD-L1 expression induced by RT the following four pathways have been reported:
  (1) IFN/IL-6, (2) EGFR, (3) DNA damage and repair signal, and (4) cGAS–STING. In
  any of the routes, finally PD-L1 expression is induced via the STAT/IRF pathway'
