caption: ZEB1/EMT controls TMEJ. When a replication fork is stalled (A), unloading
  of the replicative helicase and DNA polymerases leads to incision by a DNA nuclease,
  which creates a single-ended DSB (B). After replication forks completion, a DSB
  is generated (C). A 5′ to 3′ end resection generates single-stranded DNA, along
  which RPA and Rad51 loading can occur (D). When homologous recombination is defective,
  the alternative TMEJ pathway can operate on this resected DSB (E); POLθ is recruited
  as a dimer which facilitates the proximity of DNA ends and stabilizes synapsed intermediates;
  the helicase domain of POLθ can displace either RPA or RAD51 and the polymerase
  domain executes a bidirectional scanning initiated from the 3′ termini to identify
  internal microhomologies which can be annealed, thus generating 3′ flaps. POLθ then
  removes the 3′ flaps and starts DNA synthesis with poor processivity and frequent
  aborted synthesis resulting in a high rate of mutations including deletions and
  insertions from template switching events. When ZEB1 is expressed and stabilized
  by ATM, the expression of POLQ (encoding the POLθ protein) is decreased and therefore
  impedes the action of the alternative mutagenic TMEJ pathway on the resected DSB.
  The TMEJ inhibition by ZEB1 combined with ATM activity enhances accurate homologous
  recombination. Moreover, ZEB1 activates the transcription of ATM, both being under
  direct or indirect control of TGFβ signaling.
