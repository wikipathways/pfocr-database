caption: 'Apoptosis signaling pathways. Estrogen is a major driver of follicular growth
  and its effects results in inhibition of apoptosis. There are three main areas of
  apoptosis inducement: 1. growth factors, 2. death receptors, and 3. cell damage
  (). Before antral cavity formation ovarian follicle androgens increase the receptor
  of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) expression and high levels of BMPR1B activity,
  possibly via BMP6 and 7, suppress LHR expression (). Antiapoptotic FSH induced cAMP–PKA
  promote ERK1/2 signaling, which increases Bcl-2 and promotes estrogen production
  in favor of progesterone synthesis (–). The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 2,
  4, 6, and 7 inhibit progesterone synthesis, which reduces caspase 3, 6, and 7 production
  during the follicular phase (). Dysregulation of the BMPs induces granzyme B synthesis
  leading to increased DNA fragmentation (). Fas ligand (FasL) and TNFR activity induces
  caspase 8 induced DNA fragmentation (). BMP 7 inhibits caspase 3 activity. Estrogen
  via the estrogen receptor has also been shown to reduce FasL activity (, ). Stress
  induced apoptosis via p53 causes mitochondrial breakdown via caspase 9 (). Mitochondrial
  apoptosis is dependent on the ratio of pro and antiapoptotic factors of the Bcl-2
  family (). The Akt signaling pathway promotes antiapoptotic activity and is influenced
  by estrogen and growth factor-induced cAMP-PKA activity (, ).'
