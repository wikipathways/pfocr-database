caption: Interaction networks of DMCs according to severe features of PE. The list
  of the genes identified was subjected to STRING (v. 11.0) analysis to reveal functional
  interactions. Each node represents a protein, and each edge represents an interaction.
  Thicker lines represent stronger associations. Red letters and blue letters present
  hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes, respectively, in PE, compared to PE with
  severe features. Purple and orange circles represent genes that are related to disease
  susceptibility and IFNγ-mediated signaling pathway, respectively. Red circles represent
  TICAM2 and ZNF417 containing DMCs specific to severe features of PE
