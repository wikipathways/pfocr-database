caption: The proposed model for NPW activity on the chicken pituitary in regulating
  adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion. In chicken corticotrophs, hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing
  hormone (CRH) and arginine vasotocin (AVT) strongly stimulated ACTH secretion via
  activation of CRHR1 and AVPR coupled to AVPR1A/1B, respectively, which activate
  the 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine 5′-monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A signaling pathway.
  As a potential chicken corticotropin-releasing inhibitory factor, hypothalamic NPW
  was able to inhibit CRH- or AVT-induced ACTH secretion, and this inhibitory action
  was likely mediated by NPBWR2, whose activation could decrease intracellular cAMP
  levels induced by CRH and subsequently depress ACTH secretion. The release of ACTH
  to the adrenal gland cortex stimulated the release of corticosteroid into the blood,
  which in turn played a negative feedback regulatory role in the release of hormones
  for the pituitary gland and hypothalamus.
