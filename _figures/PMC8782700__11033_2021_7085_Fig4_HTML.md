caption: Pathway involving IL-6 and insulin resistance. Elevated levels of IL-6 bind
  to its receptor IL-6R, leading to JAK-STAT pathway involving STAT3 dimerization
  and enhanced levels of SOCS-3, which tag the IRS-1 protein for ubiquitin-based degradation.
  This finally results in failure of transport of GLUT-4 carrying vesicles to plasma
  membrane of cells and suspension of uptake of glucose into cells, leading to high
  glucose levels in blood
