caption: 'Schematic representation of the presumptive metabolic pathways in Leuconostoc
  pseudomesenterides DSM 20193 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PU1, H46 and WCFS1,
  during fermentation of water‐soluble BSG‐based medium (WS‐BSG) at 30°C for 24 h.
  The schema contains genes relevant for each pathway (grey), over‐ (green) and non‐overexpressed
  (blue) genes. Phenotypes of strains for selected substrates during the growth on
  MRS (red bars) and WS‐BSG (green bars) are represented in bar plots, where the background
  is coloured according to the main metabolic pathway as follows: galactose metabolism
  (purple), starch and sucrose metabolism (yellow), glycolysis / pentose phosphate
  pathways (white) and pentose and glucuronate interconversions (green). Pathways
  coloured in orange were present only in Leuc. pseudomesenteroides DSM 20193, while
  pathways coloured in turquoise were only present in L. plantarum strains during
  WS‐BSG fermentation. Pathways coloured in black were present in both genera.'
