caption: Schematic representation of the link between chemoresistance and MMP-7 shedding
  of Fas ligand. (a) DNA chelating chemotherapy agents including oxaliplatin and gemcitabine
  create double and single strand breaks activating DNA repair ATM/ATR signaling pathways.
  Failure of these repair pathways lead to p53 mediated activation of an intrinsic
  death pathway and upregulation of cell surface FasL expression. Cancer cells overcome
  increased extrinsic death signaling by increasing MMP-7 expression leading to FasL
  shedding. (b) GSM-192 mAb neutralizes MMPs enzyme activity, restraints chemo resistance
  by preventing Fas ligand shedding and restore the extrinsic pathway of death signaling.
