caption: DNA damage and replication checkpoints. Anticancer drugs induce replication
  disorders. Replication stress is the effect of the slowing or stalling of replication
  fork progression. DNA synthesis inhibition or damage induces checkpoint responses
  controlled by the ATR–CHK1 pathway. DNA lesions delay entry to S-phase (G1 checkpoint),
  slow the replication of damaged DNA or prevent entry to mitosis (G2 checkpoint).
  Given that both PARP and checkpoint proteins prevent fork collapse, their corresponding
  inhibitors may increase the level of replication stress, genome instability and,
  in consequence, cell death
