caption: Model for signaling in HIV-1-mediated inflammation. (A) Table summarizing
  observations from drug activity across PBMC and tonsil models. Arrows indicate relative
  magnitudes of the effects of inhibition in each of the models depicted. (B) NF449
  inhibits HIV-1 productive infection and downstream signaling of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  This pathway is activated in concert with TLR4 receptor activation, which can drive
  caspase-1 to cleave pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β. Mature IL-1β can be secreted or induce
  pyroptosis in CD4+ T cells. This signaling can also activate NF-κB-dependent transcriptional
  regulation of IL-10. Inhibition of this mechanism by NF449 may explain enhanced
  cell survival in tonsil cells. A438079, in contrast, may act directly on P2X7 to
  inhibit receptor signaling that is required for HIV-1 entry. P2X7 inhibition results
  in the inability to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis in tonsil cells,
  which does not occur in PBMCs. Therefore, A438079 depends on intact inflammasome
  signaling to exert inhibition on HIV-1 productive infection. (Printed with permission
