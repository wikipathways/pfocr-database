caption: Molecular pathways that drive cellular senescence may contribute to aging
  and age-related diseases by disrupting tissue homeostasis through impaired stem
  cell renewal and by promoting the spread of senescence and inducing chronic inflammation
  through the SASP. Reviews in this series highlight several of these pathways, including
  the contribution of telomere dysfunction to age-associated disease (), the mTOR
  signaling pathway and mechanisms underlying mTOR inhibitors in increasing longevity
  (), the role of the sirtuin family of proteins in regulating metabolism and aging-associated
  diseases (), the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in aging, including caveats of
  the long-held free radical hypothesis of aging (), and the role of cellular senescence
  and the induction of the SASP in systemic aging (). The SASP may promote increased
  tissue inflammation and dysfunction, which leads to aging phenotypes such as the
  decline in immune system function (). Aging also decreased β cell regeneration in
  pancreatic islets ().
