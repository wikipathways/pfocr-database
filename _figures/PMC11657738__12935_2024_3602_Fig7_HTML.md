caption: The proposed model of Digoxigenin-mediated autophagic cell death in HCC cells
  via the PI3K / AKT / mTOR pathway. Digoxigenin Blockade of the PI3K / AKT / mTOR
  signaling pathway mainly by binding to mTOR further led to autophagy in HCC cells
  (of course, Digoxigenin also has a certain ability to bind to PI3K and AKT). Specifically,
  the up-regulation of autophagy protein LC3B, but the downregulation of P62, increasing
  autophagic flux, and autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes, leading to HCC cell death
