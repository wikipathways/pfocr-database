caption: The relationship between IL-17A and astrocytes. In astrocytes, IL-17A induces
  expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-α (MIP-1α) through Src/MAPK/PI3K/NF-KB
  pathways (Yi et al., ). IL-17A enhances the excitotoxicity of glutamate by reducing
  the ability of astrocyte to absorb and transform glutamate (Kostic et al., ). In
  EAE mice, IL-17A triggers the downregulation of miR-497, thereby upregulating the
  hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) transcription factor in astrocytes as well
  as IL-1β and IL-6 secretion by astrocytes. MiR-409-3p and MiR-1896 are involved
  in the process of IL-17A-mediated secretion of inflammatory cytokines by astrocytes
  by targeting the SOCS3/STAT3 signaling pathway in EAE mice. Under IL-17A stimulation,
  miR-873 participates in inflammatory cytokine production in astrocytes through the
  A20/NF-KB pathway in EAE mice (Liu X. et al., ; Shan et al., ; Liu X. et al., ).
  In EAE mice, proinflammatory gene expression induced by IL-17A is diminished through
  the abrogation of p38α in astrocytes, which was via the defective activation of
  MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (Huang et al., ).
