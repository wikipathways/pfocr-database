caption: Three prestigious protection pathways implicated in ferroptosis. Of note
  GPX4 protection pathway is the famous one. With the help of GSH, GPX4 downregulates
  ROS and inhibits forthcoming ferroptosis, which could be suppressed by RSL3. System
  , the cystine/glutamate antiporter, also functions to synthesize GSH during this
  process, and can be counteracted by erastin or sulfasalazine. In the FSP1 protection
  pathway, the myristoylated FSP1 catalyzes the reduction of CoQ10 to ubiquinol, consuming
  NAD(P)H and mitigating ferroptosis. In the GCH1 protection pathway, GCH1 acts as
  a rate-limiting enzyme to manage the biosynthesis of BH4, while regulating ubiquinol
  as well. Therefore, ferroptosis progression is blocked. However, the Fenton reaction,
  the interaction between ferrous ion and H2O2, triggers the occurrence of ferroptosis.
