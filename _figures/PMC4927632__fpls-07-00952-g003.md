caption: 'Gene comparisons among K. flaccidum, C. reinhardtii and A. thaliana. (A)
  Genes involved in the wax biosynthetic pathway. (B) Genes involved in the ABCG transporter.
  Gene homologs for the respective species are shown by the presence of the open and
  filled circles as indicated. Multiple homologs in a species are represented by multiple
  circles. Abbreviations: ABCG, ATP binding cassette subfamily G; CER, Eceriferum;
  ECR, Enoyl-CoA reuctase; FAR, Fatty acid reductase; HACD, Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrase;
  KCR, Ketoacyl-CoA reductase; KCS, ketoacyl-CoA synthase; MAH1, Mid-chain alkane
  hydroxylase1; WSD, Wax ester synhtase.'
