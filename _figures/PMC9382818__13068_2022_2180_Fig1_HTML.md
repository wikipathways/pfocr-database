caption: a Schematic diagram of yeast microbial fuel cell. b Regulation of the Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae metabolic pathway to accumulate excess electrons in the yeast cell. Knockdown
  of genes associated with NAD(P)H depletion in yeast cells (marked in red), specifically
  lactate dehydrogenase genes dld1, dld2, dld3 in the pyruvate metabolism and genes
  associated with depletion of reduced coenzymes in the citric acid cycle including
  mitochondrial malic enzyme mae, malate dehydrogenase mdh1, mdh2, mdh3, NADP-specific
  isocitrate dehydrogenases idp1, idp2, idp3, old yellow enzyme oye2, oye3.
