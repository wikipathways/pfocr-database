caption: Schematic model depicting the proposed signaling pathway in LH/hCG-induced
  LHR mRNA down-regulation. Binding of ligand to LH receptor induces activation of
  ERK½ through the cAMP/PKA pathway. This leads to an increase in the expression of
  LRBP and thereby its LHR mRNA binding activity, which ultimately results in LHR
  mRNA degradation.
