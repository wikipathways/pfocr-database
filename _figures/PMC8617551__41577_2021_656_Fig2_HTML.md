caption: Coronavirus RNA in the cytoplasm is sensed by the cytoplasmic RNA sensors
  RIG-I and MDA5. Sensing of viral RNA triggers conformational changes in these sensors
  and results in the recruitment of downstream effector proteins. MAVS interacts with
  RIG-I or MDA5 through CARD domains to recruit the downstream kinases TBK1 and IKKε
  for phosphorylation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7. MAVS activation
  also recruits TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which serves as an adaptor
  for the IKK complex (NEMO, IKKα and IKKβ). The IKK complex phosphorylates NF-κB
  canonical inhibitor, IκB, which results in IκB degradation and activation of NF-κB.
  IRF3, IRF7 and NF-κB translocate to the nucleus and interact with the corresponding
  positive regulatory domain (PRD). IRF3 and IRF7 bind PRD I/PRD III, NF-κB binds
  PRD II, and AP-1 (a heterodimer of JUN and ATF2) binds PRD IV on the interferon-β
  (IFNβ) promoter to form the interferon enhanceosome for induction of IFNβ expression.
  IFNβ is secreted and interacts with the IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR; comprising the IFNAR1
  and IFNAR2 subunits) in an autocrine or a paracrine manner. Binding of interferon
  to IFNAR activates the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)
  and STAT2 kinases, Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and the tyrosine kinase TYK2. Phosphorylated
  STAT1 and STAT2 associate with IRF9 to form ISGF3, which translocates to the nucleus
  and interacts with the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter to
  drive the expression of downstream interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs perform
  different antiviral functions. The example depicted in the figure is the 2′-5′-oligoadenylate
  synthetase (OAS)–RNase L pathway. OAS interacts with viral RNA and catalyses the
  formation of 2′-5′-oligoadenylate (2-5A) from ATP. 2-5A is a secondary messenger
  that activates RNase L to drive viral RNA degradation. Viral proteins of severe
  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and related coronaviruses
  shown in the figure interfere with interferon production and signalling at different
  steps. Viral proteins (depicted in red) are from SARS-CoV-2 unless otherwise specified.
  MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; N, nucleocapsid protein;
  nsp, non-structural protein; ORF, open reading frame protein.
