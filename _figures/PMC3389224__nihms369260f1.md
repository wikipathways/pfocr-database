caption: 'Solid lines and borders indicate established steps and known neuroanatomical
  locations, respectively. Dashed lines and borders indicate suggested or inferred
  steps and neuroanatomical locations. Signal reception in mammals and birds: (A)
  In mammals, the photoperiod signal is received by the retina and neuronally communicated
  via the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and superior cervical ganglion (SCG) to the
  pineal gland []. Melatonin (mel) produced by the pineal encodes the signal []. (B)
  In birds, the signal is received by extraretinal photoreceptors, most likely hypothalamic
  opsins [, ]. Communication of the signal is neuronal and does not involve melatonin
  []. The neuroendocrine response in mammals and birds: In both (A) mammals and (B)
  birds, the earliest hormonal response to a stimulatory photoperiod occurs in the
  pars tuberalis, where production of thyroid stimulating hormone beta (TSHβ) and
  chorionic gonadotropin alpha (CGα) increase [, , ]. TSHβ and CGα heterodimerize
  to form thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which stimulates deiodinase 2 (dio2)
  production in tanycytes lining the third ventricle of the hypothalamus (III–V).
  Dio2 catalyzes the conversion of the thyroid hormone thyroxin (T4) to the bioactive
  triiodothyronine (T3) [, ]. T3 stimulates production of gonadotropin releasing hormone
  (GnRH) from neurons in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH). GnRH is transported via
  the pituitary portal system to the pars distalis, where it stimulates production
  of the gonadotropins follicle stimulating hormone (FSHβ) and luteinizing hormone
  (LHβ) []. These heterodimerize with CGα and are released into the bloodstream where
  they act upon the gonads and other peripheral targets. Signal reception and neuroendocrine
  response in fish: (C) In fish, photoperiodic signal reception is extraretinal [,
  ] and may be an hypothalamic opsin []. Melatonin does not appear to encode the signal
  [], as it can affect sexual maturation in some species, but its targets may be downstream
  of reception and initial response to photoperiod [, ]. The early responses of TSHβ
  and dio2 to a stimulatory photoperiod have not been studied in fish. In general,
  plasma T3 increases during sexual maturation in photoperiodic fishes [, , ], but
  its effects on GnRH in photoperiodic fishes are unknown. Photoperiodic manipulation
  stimulates GnRH, LH and FSH production [, , , ]. LH and FSH stimulate the gonads
  to produce sex hormones [].'
