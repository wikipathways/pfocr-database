caption: (a) Cobalamine biosynthetic pathway based on the KEGG database (). The systematic
  names of the C.acetobutylicum genes of the cobalamine operon are shown. Conversion
  of Cob(II)yrinate a,c diamide into Cob(I)yrinate a,c diamide is carried out by CAC0018
  (not shown). The gene or genes responsible for the conversion of Cob(I)yrinate a,c
  diamide into adenosyl cobyrinate a,c diamide are unknown. (b) Genome organization
  of the B12 TU in C.acetobutylicum. CAC1365, CAC1366, CAC1367 and CAC1368 encode
  the high-affinity-ATP-dependent cobalt transport system cbiMNQO, CAC1371 encodes
  an l-threonine kinase needed for the biosynthesis of l-threonine-3P which is a substrate
  for CobD. The function of CAC1386 is still unknown, but it might encode the conversion
  of Cob(I)yrinate a,c diamide into adenosyl cobyrinate a,c diamide.
