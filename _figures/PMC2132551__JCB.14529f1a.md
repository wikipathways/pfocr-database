caption: (A) Sequences of PDI and Eug1p from yeast and thioredoxin from E. coli surrounding
  the active site CXXC motifs (boxed). A section of the a and a′ domains of PDI and
  Eug1p is compared, and the location of the predicted secondary structure features
  is indicated by β2 (second β-sheet structure) and α2 (second α-helix structure).
  Residues that are found in a majority of the sequences are underlined. (B) Reaction
  cycle for oxidation of nascent polypeptide (ProteinSH/SH) catalyzed by PDI. The
  putative involvement of GSSG in the oxidation cycle is indicated. The upper SH group
  of PDI (PDI SH) indicates the NH2-proximal cysteine residue of the CXXC motif. This
  is the more reactive residue and will engage in the formation of mixed disulfides
  with the substrate, here shown only for the protein substrate although a similar
  reaction pathway exists for GSSG reduction. PDISH indicates the more COOH-proximal
  cysteine residue, which is involved in the formation of the internally oxidized
  form of PDI. In mutant forms of PDI lacking the COOH-proximal cysteine, oxidation
  of substrate protein can occur, albeit inefficiently, by reduction of a mixed disulfide
  between glutathione and the PDI NH2-proximal cysteine residue. (C) Isomerization
  reaction in which the NH2-proximal cysteine residue of the CXXC motif attacks a
  wrongly formed disulfide of a substrate protein. The formation of mixed intermediate
  I allows a free SH group of the substrate to form an alternative SS bond. Importantly,
  the more COOH-proximal cysteine residue does not participate in this reaction cycle.
