caption: Chromatin structure of human and mouse telomeres. Telomeric chromatin is
  organized in a closed state with repressive histone posttranslational modifications
  (PTM), similar to those observed at pericentric heterochromatin (PCH) domains. Telomeric
  nucleosomes are labeled with H3K9me3 and possibly H4K20me3, while subtelomeric DNA
  is also methylated at CpG dinucleotides. H3.3-containing nucleosomes are provided
  by the ATRX/DAXX complex. Although telomeric chromatin is heterochromatic, subtelomeric
  regions contain promoters that promote the transcription of the long non-coding
  RNA TERRA. Telomere length is maintained by the action of the enzyme telomerase
  that catalyzes the addition of extra TTAGGG repeats to chromosome ends. Shelterin
  complexes bind along the telomere and protect from recognition by the DNA damage
  pathway. For graphical clarity, only one shelterin complex (TRF1, TRF2, POT1a/b,
  TPP1, and TIN2) is shown (top). In a subset of cancer cells, telomerase is not used
  to elongate telomeres. Instead, alternative lengthening of telomere (or ALT), allows
  recombination-mediated elongation. ATRX is frequently lost in ALT cells. Repressive
  marks are reduced, and TERRA RNA is more abundant, leading to putative recombinogenic
  DNA-RNA hybrids (R-loops). Variant repeats in ALT cells can induce binding of NR2C/F
  transcription factors to telomeres, leading to chromosomal rearrangements and genomic
  instability (bottom)
