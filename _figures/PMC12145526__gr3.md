caption: Mechanism of BMP signaling in OP. Bone homeostasis is essential in the pathological
  processes associated with OP. MSCs may develop into pre-osteoblasts, which then
  mature into osteoblasts, and pre-osteoblasts can also become osteoclasts. The BMP
  signaling system regulates a complicated set of differentiation events. Furthermore,
  BMP's interaction with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has a major impact on
  osteoblast marker expression. Concurrently, osteoclast activity is controlled by
  inflammatory substances released by different macrophage subtypes, which are similarly
  affected by BMP signaling. The bottom right box depicts the regulatory processes
  involved in osteoclastogenesis (Created with BioRender.com.)
