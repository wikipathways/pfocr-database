caption: FMDV infection significantly promoted the level of aspartate in vitro and
  in vivo. Cellular aspartate plays an important role in FMDV replication. Detailed
  analysis showed that FMDV enhanced aspartate by SLC38A8 transporter. EV71 and SVV
  infection also promoted aspartate by SLC38A8. On one hand, FMDV infection activated
  Rheb via PI3K/AKT/TSC2 pathways. On the other hand, the upregulation of amino acids
  enhanced the interaction between mTOR and Rheb to activate the mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling
  axis to promote viral replication. The mTORC1 signaling pathway was responsible
  for FMDV-induced SLC38A8 protein expression.
