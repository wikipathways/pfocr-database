caption: 'Interleukin-17 signaling pathway (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) ID: Human (Homo sapiens), hsa04657). The IL-17 cytokine family (IL-17A-F)
  plays a role in acute and chronic inflammation. IL-17A, predominantly secreted by
  T helper 17 (TH17) cells, is essential for protecting against external pathogens
  and is implicated in autoimmune inflammation. IL-17F primarily protects mucosal
  surfaces, while IL-17E promotes Th2 immune responses. IL-17C shares similar functions
  with IL-17A. The IL-17 family communicates via specific receptors, such as IL17RA,
  which several family members use. Activation of downstream signaling pathways, including
  NF-kappa B, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and CCAAT-enhancer-binding
  proteins (C/EBPs), results in the production of antimicrobial peptides and the expression
  of cytokines and chemokines. Adopted from (https://www.genome.jp/pathway/hsa04657+23765)
