caption: Nephron development and cell lineages. Invasion of the metanephric mesenchyme
  (green, MM) by the ureteric bud (purple, UB) provides inductive signals that initiate
  nephrogenesis. (A) UB invasion induces MM cells to condense around the UB tips at
  E11.5 of mouse development. These so-called cap mesenchymal cells express a unique
  combination of markers (Six2, Gdnf, Cited1) and define a stem cell population. (B)
  Cap mesenchyme polarizes into a primitive epithelial sphere, the renal vesicle,
  coincident with the expression of additional markers, such as Wnt4 and Pax8. Cells
  in the metanephric mesenchyme that do not aggregate at the bud tips express Foxd1and
  the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and mark the stromal population. (C) The renal
  vesicle fuses to the ureteric stalk, which forms the collecting ducts, and generates
  an S-shaped body with a proximal and distal cleft. The more proximal cleft is infiltrated
  by endothelial cells and forms the glomerular tuft. The proximal portion of the
  S-shaped body activates the Notch pathway, as seen by the presence of the cleaved
  Notch intracellular domain (ICD). (D) The nephron begins to take shape as glomerular
  development proceeds and the more proximal tubules elongate and grow towards the
  medulla to form the descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle. (E) Notch
  signaling is essential for the proximodistal patterning of the nephron, as Notch2
  mutations delete all proximal cell types and structures ().
