caption: Model for GPN1, 2, and 3 function in biogenesis of RNA polymerases II and
  III. After synthesis RNA polymerase subcomplexes begin to assemble in the cytoplasm.
  The three GPN proteins bind with the assembly intermediates and aid the formation
  of the RNA polymerase complex, possibly cooperating with the Hsp90/CCT chaperone
  machinery. Iwr1 association with the RNA polymerases provides the NLS required for
  import through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Once in the nucleus, the RNA polymerase
  is able to associate with transcription factors (TF) and carry out transcription
  activity while the GPN proteins and Iwr1 are recycled to the cytoplasm via a nuclear
  export pathway, potentially driven by a nuclear export sequence in Gpn1 ().
