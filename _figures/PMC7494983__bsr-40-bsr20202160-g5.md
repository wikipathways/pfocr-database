caption: SIRT1 inactivation leads to NF-kB phosphorylation related to activation of
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and decrease in expression of AMP-activated
  kinase (AMPK). In adipocytes, SIRT1 deacetylates the nuclear factor NF-kB p65, leads
  to a decrease in the expression of TNF-α and MCP-1. In skeletal muscle, SIRT1 induces
  the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-) co-activator
  1α. Under diabetes condition mitochondrial oxidative capacity reduced which leads
  to the generation of free radical oxygen species, free fatty acids and TNFα reduced
  the insulin signaling via insulin receptor substrate phosphorylation. SIRT1 also
  activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). SIRT1 activates the PGC-1α induces the
  mitochondrial biogenesis which reduced the generation of ROS, increase the generation
  of GLUT4. SIRT1 deacetylates the forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and increased the
  recruitment with CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPα) which increase the generation
  of adiponectin1 in adipocytes. Adiponectin also activates the calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase
  (CaMK). Adiponectin activates the SIRT1 via AMPK pathway activation. Its leads to
  deacetylation of PGC-1α resulted in mitochondrial biogenesis.
