caption: 'Left. Under normal EPHB2 signaling conditions, the rate of lipogenesis/lipolysis
  is balanced. Middle. Loss of EPHB2 receptor leads to activation of the TAG pathway
  with increased expression of genes associated with lipogenesis such as DGAT1 and
  DGAT2 and simultaneous decreased levels of the lipolysis regulating enzyme ATGL.
  These changes ultimately tip the lipogenesis/lipolysis balance toward the formation
  of LDs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequent accumulation in both nuclear
  and cytoplasmic compartments. This de novo accumulation of LD increases the density
  and size of newly formed LDs creating a high energy state that can foment the proliferation
  of prostate cancer cells. Right. Targeting DGAT1 reduces lipogenesis. With DGAT1
  inhibition there is a simultaneous increase in lipolysis-regulating ATGL. These
  changes affect LDs accumulation by increasing lipolysis and releasing FFA. The effects
  of restoring lipid content have a negative impact on cell proliferation in prostate
  cancer cells with EPHB2 deficiency (Right). M: cell membrane; C: cytoplasm; N: nucleus;
  ER: endoplasmic reticulum; TAG: triacylglyceride; LDs: lipid droplets; Rx: DGAT1
  specific inhibitor and FFA: free fatty acids.'
