caption: . Microphysiology Systems Database home page and workflow. The MPS-Db home
  page provides portals for study design, implementation and analysis. A) The study
  components section allows the user to review and compare MPS models, the devices
  used for the models, compounds and compound properties, and cells and cell sample
  properties for study design and interpretation. B) Study implementation using the
  selected components, involves configuring a set of MPS models, defining their treatments,
  and selecting the assays and methods to be used for interrogating the model. C)
  Data Analysis tools include reproducibility analysis, including intra-study, inter-study,
  and inter-center reproducibility, and flexible, user-defined graphing. At any point
  in the analysis, the selected data can be easily exported for additional analyses
  using other software tools. D) Computational modeling tools for PBPK, predictive
  modeling and pathway modeling are currently in development.
