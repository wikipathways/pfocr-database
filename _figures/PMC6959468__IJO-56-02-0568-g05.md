caption: Post-translational modification involved in the regulation of dysregulated
  proteins by IPA. IPA scientists have manually mapped >800 biological signaling pathways
  and metabolic pathways, scoring the most relevant dysregulation pathways with experimental
  data in canonical pathways analysis. The Overlay and Path Designer tools personalize
  the editing and extension of the path. In addition, IPA’s unique z-score algorithm
  also covers the analysis of activation inhibition regulation of nearly 200 pathways
  to quickly identify relevant pathways with obvious imbalances. Sirtuin (NAD-dependent
  deacetylase) is involved in the process of protein deacetylation, which includes
  important processes, such as fatty acid metabolism. IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
