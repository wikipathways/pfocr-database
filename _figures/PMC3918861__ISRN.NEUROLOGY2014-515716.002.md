caption: Mechanisms of induction of apoptosis. In the classical pathway, mitochondria
  release cytochrome C in response to cell stress and damage, leading to activation
  of caspase 9 and subsequent activation of caspase 3 and other effectors of apoptosis.
  Alternatively, mitochondria may also release apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which
  leads to apoptosis by a caspase independent mechanism. The death receptor pathway
  involves the activation of FADD by various cell signal receptors, followed by activation
  of caspase 8 and the subsequent caspase cascade leading to apoptosis.
