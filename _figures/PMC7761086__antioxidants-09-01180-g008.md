caption: 'Catechins-loaded biopolymer nano formulations antioxidant/pro-oxidant/antiproliferative
  presumptive pathway and activity in intra- and inter-cellular environment of normal
  and cancer cells [,,,,,,,,,,,,,]: (A). In intracellular normal cell environment:
  (A1). Diffusive transport via protein transporters, (A2). Intracellular degradation
  of the bioflavonoid/biopolymer composite, subsequent catechins release, (A3). In
  mitochondrion environment. (B). In intracellular cancer cell environment: (B1).
  Entrance into the cancer cell, (B2). Intracellular degradation, subsequent catechins
  release, (B3,B4). Increased ROS production, (B5). Inactivation of enzymes. (C).
  In intercellular environment: opening of tight junctions between cells with a reversible
  effect on the tight junctions’ integrity.'
