caption: Mechanistic map of β-arrestin dependence of two intertwined functional cell
  responses, apoptosis, and immune response. Biochemical reactions were edited in
  the Cell Designer format (see included legend). The molecular species not included
  in the β-arrestinome are in white, membrane receptors are in yellow, β-arrestins
  1 or 2, and both β-arrestins are colored as above. Both cell responses connect at
  the level of the NFKB pathway (data not shown).
