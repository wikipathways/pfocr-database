caption: The most enriched interaction network of the differentially expressed proteins
  in EC Diabetic compared to EC Non-Diabetic states. Red nodes indicate upregulated
  expression; green nodes indicate downregulated expression. The central nodes of
  the pathway related to signaling of the ERK1/2 and F Actin were found to be deregulated
  between the two states. Uncolored nodes are proposed by IPA and indicate potential
  targets that were functionally coordinated with the differentially expressed proteins.
  Solid lines indicate direct molecular interactions, and dashed lines represent indirect
  interactions.
