caption: Mechanism of AMPK activation. AMPK can be activated via the LKB1 or CaMKKβ
  pathway (physiological activation) following phosphorylation at threonine 172 residue
  in the α subunit. It can also be activated exogenously by drugs such as quercetin
  and metformin that act on the mitochondria and increase the AMP:ATP ratio, which
  subsequently activates the LKB1-mediated phosphorylation and activation of AMPK.
  Lastly, it can also be activated allosterically by the binding of AMP at the AMPKγ
  subunit.
