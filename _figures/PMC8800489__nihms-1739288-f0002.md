caption: (A) The approach we are proposing provides a pathway from external exposures
  and their metabolites to the molecular architecture of physiology (the ‘building
  blocks of life’) to the biological response that is invoked when environmental factors
  interact with our physiology. (B) A subsample of the classes of compounds we have
  detected in prenatal and postnatal components of teeth to exemplify the categories
  in panel A. Clusters are generated by chemical similarity between metabolites.
