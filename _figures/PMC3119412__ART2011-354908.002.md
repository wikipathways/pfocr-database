caption: 'Tenofovir handling by proximal tubular cells and potential molecular mechanisms
  and clinical consequences of tenofovir nephrotoxicity. (a) Tenofovir secretion by
  proximal tubular cells: 20 to 30% of tenofovir is excreted unchanged in the urine
  through active secretion by proximal tubular cells. OAT1 is the main transporter
  taking tenofovir into the proximal tubular cell, although OAT3 also collaborates.
  Once inside this mitochondria-rich cell type, tenofovir must be extruded into the
  tubular lumen by MRP-2 and MRP-4. Blocking tenofovir uptake by OAT1 may protect
  tubular cells by keeping intracellular tenofovir level low. Thus, probenecid is
  routinely used to prevent cidofovir nephrotoxicity since cidofovir is also transported
  into tubular cells by OAT1. There is less experience preventing tenofovir nephrotoxicity.
  A decreased GFR will increase plasma tenofovir levels and proximal tubular cell
  uptake through OAT1. Blocking tenofovir extrusion by MRP-2 and MRP-4 by pharmacological
  interference may also boost tenofovir nephrotoxicity. OAT: organic acid transporter;
  MRP: multidrug resistance protein. (b) Potential molecular mechanisms of tenofovir
  toxicity towards proximal tubular cells. Proximal tubular cells are uniquely susceptible
  to tenofovir toxicity because they gave a complement of transporters that increase
  intracellular concentrations of the drug, and they are rich in mitochondria. Tenofovir
  and other acyclic nucleotides decrease mtDNA content by inhibiting mitochondrial
  DNA polymerase γ (POLG). This has been related to structural mitochondrial abnormalities,
  some of them visible even by optical microscopy in cases of tenofovir nephrotoxicity,
  that include mitochondrial depletion, and wide changes in mitochondria size and
  shape, with clumping, loss, and disorientation of cristae. In addition, mitochondrial
  injury may lead to apoptosis. Although tenofovir has not been studied, cidofovir
  is known to induce proximal tubular cell apoptosis by leading to caspase activation
  []. The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis includes the release of mitochondrial
  proteins to the cytosol including cytochrome c (CytC), which is required for caspase
  9 activation in the apoptosome Smac/Diablo, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs),
  and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) that, among other actions, causes DNA injury.
  These are potential mediators of tenofovir-induced tubular cell injury that deserve
  further study. (c) Analytical and clinical consequences of tenofovir proximal tubular
  cell toxicity. Injured proximal tubular cells fail to perform their functions. These
  include reabsorbing low-molecular-weight proteins (such as vitamin D-binding protein
  (DBP) and β2-microglobulin) through the megalin-cubilin system (MCS), glucose through
  the sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), aminoacids, phosphate and uric acid,
  secreting H+ and synthesizing calcitriol by the action of mitochondrial 1α-hydroxylase
  on 25(OH) vitamin D reabsorbed from the tubular lumenAs more immediate consequences
  we may observe a variable mixture of low-molecular weight proteinuria, glycosuria,
  aminoaciduria, hypophosphatemia, hypouricemia, renal tubular acidosis, and vitamin
  D insufficiency and even osteomalacia as a consequence both of insufficient calcitriol
  synthesis and urinary losses of 25(OH) vitamin D. Persistent tubular injury may
  promote tubular cell loss and eventual decreased glomerular filtration and renal
  failure.'
