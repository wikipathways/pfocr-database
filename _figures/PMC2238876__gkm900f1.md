caption: An example of a pathway in MetaCyc. Pathways can be displayed at varying
  levels of detail. This pathway display depicts an intermediate level of detail including
  enzymes, EC numbers, genes and chemical structures of the main compounds. Notice
  the green arrow at the bottom of the pathway, which provides a hyperlink to a related
  downstream pathway.
