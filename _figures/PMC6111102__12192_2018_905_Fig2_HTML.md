caption: 'The UPR could regulate protein entry to ER and protein exit from ER during
  stress. Protein entry: the activation of PERK (protein kinase activity) phosphorylates
  eIF2α leading to the inhibition of new protein synthesis. Protein exit: the activation
  of IRE1 or PERK (lipid kinase activity) leads to the phosphorylation of ERK2 which
  in turn phosphorylates Sec16 resulting in the formation of more ER exit sites (phosphorylation
  pathway). The UPR also upregulates the export machinery (transcriptional pathway)'
