caption: Mechanisms mediated through IGF-1/IGF-1R. The activation of IGF-1R takes
  place following the bondage of IGF-1 (or IGF-2) to the extracellular part of the
  receptor. IGF-1 plasma levels, and thus IGF-1R activation, are reduced by the IGFBPs.
  However, IGFBP-3 can act as an enhancer of the IGF-1 activity when it is bonded
  to the receptor and not directly to IGF-1. Following its activation, IGF-1R induces
  the phosphorylation of IRS-1,2 molecules, which they further activate the PI3K-Akt
  pathway. Consequently, there is induction of cell survival, cell cycle progression,
  cell proliferation and VEGF transcription. At the same time, apoptosis is inhibited
  and the cell gains resistance against cancer therapies. Even when IRS-1,2 molecules
  are silenced, the activation of IGF-1R leads to increased cell proliferation through
  the activation of Shc-ERK pathway. IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate 1; IGFBPs,
  insulin-like growth factor binding proteins; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.
