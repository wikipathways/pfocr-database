caption: 'JAK/STAT signaling pathway. In the absence of cytokines, the JAK protein
  remains inactive in regions close to the intracellular domains of the receptor.
  When a cytokine binds to a receptor, JAK proteins and intracellular domains of the
  receptor are phosphorylated, activating and recruiting STAT proteins, which dimerize
  and translocate to the nucleus to initiate the transcription process of genes involved
  in cell proliferation. In addition to the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, there
  is an interconnection with other intracellular signaling pathways, among the most
  prominent are the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway and the PI3K pathway; the latter manifesting
  interconnection with JAK1 proteins, which indirectly activate the NFkB pathway,
  the transcriptional factors that activate the production of cytokines (among them
  CXCL12, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, TNF-α and CCL3) and the growth factors identified in the
  inflammatory profile of individuals with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. JAK:
  Janus kinase protein; STAT: signal transducers and activators of transcription;
  MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K: phosphoinositol kinase 3; JAK1: Janus
  kinase class 1 protein; NFkB: light chain nuclear factor B-cell kappa; CXCL12: chemokine
  12 with CXC motif; IL-6: interleukin 6; IL-8: interleukin 8; IL-9: interleukin 9;
  TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor alpha; CCL3: chemokine ligand 3.'
