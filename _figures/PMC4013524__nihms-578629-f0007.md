caption: (A-D) Diagrams depicting the dynamic interaction between the ASE and its
  functional inputs in the socket cell. The timeline at right refers to the developmental
  stages of microchaete socket cells in the pupal notum. The body of the Su(H) gene
  is represented as a blue box; the accompanying arrow shows the direction of transcription,
  with its thickness denoting the intensity of transcriptional activity in the socket
  cell. The ASE is shown downstream of the gene, with functionally important sequence
  motifs and sub-regions labeled. Segments of the ASE receiving local activator inputs
  are highlighted in green, with the input level indicated by the thickness of the
  green line. The repressor form of Su(H) is shown as a black ball, the activator
  form as blue balls. (A) Shortly after the socket cell is born, the ASE receives
  local activator inputs via the sequences in YZW (thin green line, red Y and Z),
  but is silenced by the default repression function of Su(H), acting via binding
  sites S2-S9 (—).(B) Activation of the Notch pathway in the socket cell converts
  Su(H) into a transcriptional activator (). Su(H) and various local activator inputs
  selectively synergize to activate two sub-modules, ASE5Y and ZW3S (brown boxes,
  thick lines), which drive an increase in Su(H) transcription (thick brown arrows).
  YZW (brown box, thin line) may also contribute independently to this activity (thin
  brown arrow).(C) Once Su(H) expression rises above a threshold level, two Su(H)
  response elements, ASE5 and W3S (blue boxes, thick lines), are activated to fully
  establish the ASE-Su(H) feedback loop (blue arrows). Activation of ASE5 and W3S
  depend s in part on other local activator inputs; in particular, ASE5 receives two
  activator inputs via a single A motif (red A) and multiple binding sites for Vvl
  (red V), a POU-homeodomain transcription factor ().(D) As the socket cell differentiates,
  the local activator inputs on YZW disappear (brown Y and Z) and W3S is silenced
  (blue box, dashed line), but the activator inputs on ASE5 persist into adulthood,
  keeping ASE5 active to maintain Su(H) autoregulation (blue arrows). See also .(E)
  The dynamic pattern of activation of the ASE’s sub-modules progressively establishes
  Su(H) autoregulation in the socket cell. Letters on the time axis refer to stages
  A-D above.
