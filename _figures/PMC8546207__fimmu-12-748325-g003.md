caption: Macrophage immunity against Leishmania parasites. 1) Leishmania promastigotes
  are injected into the host via needle injection or sand fly injection. 2) Monocytes
  differentiate into macrophages at the infection site. 3) Macrophages are recruited
  by neutrophils and infected after neutrophils release Leishmania parasites, or as
  a consequence of phagocytosis of necrotic neutrophils. 4) Macrophages are the canonical
  host for Leishmania and can polarize towards M1 after TLR stimulation via Leishmania
  molecules such as LPG and GP63. 5) TLR signaling induces HIF-1α and subsequent upregulation
  of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). 6) TLR signaling also leads
  to NF-κB translocation to the nucleus and subsequent release of IL-12, TNF-α, and
  NO. SHP-1 upregulation by the parasite GP63 and LPS can interfere with this pathway.
  7) On the other hand, stimuli such as IL-10, IL-4, and TGF-β can polarize macrophages
  towards an M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype, characterized by upregulation of fatty
  acid (FA) oxidation, oxidative phosphorylation and arginase production. 8) M2 macrophages
  produce IL-10 and TGF-β, which mediate collagen deposition and granuloma formation
  in VL. 9) Different factors such as Leishmania-derived lipids, immunomodulatory
  therapeutics and Th cells can induce and alter macrophage polarization. 10) The
  interplay between macrophages and Th1 cells via antigen presentation and cytokine
  release is involved in vaccine-induced immunity. Furthermore, metabolomic reprogramming
  could influence vaccine immunity, as shown in BCG vaccine, although this remains
  underexplored in Leishmania. PPP, pentose phosphate pathways; FA, fatty acid; NO,
  nitric oxide.
