  ns means that gene was not statistically significantly regulated by the treatment.
  Up-regulated genes are represented in grey shade except DKK1, which is down-regulated.

  cell development or Energy production, Lipid metabolism and small molecule biochemistry
  presented a score of 41 and 28 respectively (few genes are deleted to network for
  better view). The network displayed graphically as nodes (gene/gene products) and
  edges (the biological relationship between nodes). The node grey intensity indicates
  the expression of genes: black and bold: up-regulated, grey: down-regulated in intestinal
  tissues. The shapes of nodes indicate the functional class of the gene product.
  The log fold change values are indicated under each node. PPAR signalling canonical
  pathway was added. CP mean canonical pathway. (d) RT-qPCR data are normalized using
  geometrical mean of β-Actin and Gapdh as control genes.'
