caption: Biochemical pathways leading to diabetic retinopathy. Chronic hyperglycemia
  promotes the increase in ROS formation, originating in the mitochondria or produced
  by Nox, and also activates many metabolic pathways, including PKC, polyol pathway,
  AGEs, and the hexosamine pathway, as well as the production of inflammatory mediators.
  Oxidative stress damages mitochondrial DNA resulting in a decline in mitochondrial
  function, which accelerates cell apoptosis, contributing to the development of diabetic
  retinopathy.
