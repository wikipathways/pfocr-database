caption: In the thymus, naive CD4+ T cells transiently express CD25 and respond to
  IL-2 through the STAT5s signaling pathway, and up regulate CD25 and Foxp3 expressions.
  Then, they begin to differentiation into mature CD4+ Tregs. Mature CD4+ Tregs emigrate
  from the thymus and constitutively express CD25 and respond vigorously to IL-2 by
  up regulating CD25 and becoming activated CD4+ Tregs. CD8+ T cells also respond
  to IL-2 and become activated CD8+ Tregs. Activated CD4+ Tregs exert their suppressive
  functions to include a control of local inflammation; b control of autoantibody
  production; (c) control of T-cell-mediated autoimmunity. However, the mechanisms
  of the suppressive activity of CD8+ Tregs in vivo remain to be determined
