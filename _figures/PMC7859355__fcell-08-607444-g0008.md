caption: Schematic depiction of our proposed model of the role of ROS in the regulation
  of FGF2-induced AKT phosphorylation in hPSCs. Based on our artificial manipulations
  of the MEK1/2–ERK1/2 pathway and ROS levels, we propose that MEK1/2–ERK1/2 pathway
  and mild hypoxia (5% O2) downregulate AKT phosphorylation using ROS as second messengers.
  We further show that ROS contribute to AKT phosphorylation by FGFR1 transactivation
  and inhibition of PTEN activity in hPSCs. ROS, reactive oxygen species; FGF2, fibroblast
  growth factor 2; AKT, protein kinase B; hPSCs, human pluripotent stem cells; MAPK,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase; FGFR1, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; PTEN,
  phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10; MEK1/2, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase 1 and 2; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and
  2; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; PI3K, phosphatydylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase.
