caption: Possible mechanisms of SCFAs-induced epigenetic modifications to improve
  NAFLD. (a) SCFAs reduce the DNA methylation portion of the adiponectin and resistin
  promoters, which was mediated by reducing the expressions of DNMT1 and MBD2, suppressing
  the binding of these enzymes to the promoters of adiponectin and resistin. The mRNA
  expression of adiponectin and resistin is upregulated due to demethylation of gene
  promoter, thus restoring gene transcription. Among them, adiponectin and resistin
  can effectively improve NAFLD. (b) SCFAs modulate chromatin by inhibiting HDACs
  to increase acetylation and phosphorylation of the p70 S6 kinase and phosphorylation
  rS6, while regulating the mTOR pathway required for T-cell production, thereby suppressing
  the T-cell immune response to regulate metabolic inflammatory responses in the liver.
  (c) SCFAs inhibit WAT production by regulating the methylation level of the miR-378A/YY1
  promoter in the host and the expression of the miR-181. SCFAs, short-chain fatty
  acids; DNMT1, DNA methyltransferases 1; MBD2, methyl CpG-binding structural domain
  protein 2; NAFLD, Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; mTOR, mechanistic target of
  rapamycin; WAT, white adipose tissue
