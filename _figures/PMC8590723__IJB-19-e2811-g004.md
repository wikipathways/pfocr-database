caption: Proposed platyconin biosynthetic pathway in P. grandiflorus. A) Dotted arrows
  indicated multistep reactions. Enzymes responsible for the conversion of certain
  substrate were enumerated next to the respective arrow. B) Chemical structures of
  cyanidin and pelargonidin to show hydroxyl group(s) bonded to B ring of flavonoids,
  compared with delphinidin.
