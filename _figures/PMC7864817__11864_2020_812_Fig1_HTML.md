caption: Metabolic changes induced by DOXO in cardiomyocytes. DOXO interferes with
  Fe2+ metabolism, leading to activation of ferroptosis through ROS production, disruption
  of IRP-1 activity, and iron accumulation into mitochondria. These events are hallmarks
  of mitochondrial dysfunction that leads to a block of fatty acid oxidation (FAO)
  and an increase in glycolysis, as a consequence of AMPK inhibition. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  (ACC), a direct downstream target inhibited by AMPK, is overactivated and catalyzes
  the formation of Malonyl-CoA, blocking FAO irreversibly. At the plasma membrane,
  DOXO promotes glucose uptake via GLUT4 through insulin-mediated activation of AMPK
  and AKT2. In addition, DOXO increases the expression of GLUT1, an insulin-independent
  glucose transporter, normally absent in the adult heart. Following the insulin desensitization
  induced by tumor-secreted factors, AKT1 signaling is disrupted and promotes FOXO1
  nuclear translocation, inducing the activation of the apoptotic pathway through
  the expression of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Finally, DOXO cardiotoxicity
  has been linked to autophagy dysregulation. DOXO inhibits autophagy by activating
  mTOR or by blocking AMPK, resulting in accumulation of undegraded autophagosomes
  and mitochondrial dysfunction with increased production of ROS. This figure was
