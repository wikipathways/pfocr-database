caption: Molecular targets in NFκB pathway modulated by PEITC and SFN. Inactivation
  of NFκB by PEITC and SFN is considered as one important chemopreventive mechanism.
  NFκB is normally sequestrated by IκB which is subjected to phosphorylation by IκK.
  Phosphorylation of IκB by IκK increases degradation of IκB and, therefore, increases
  nuclear translocation of NFκB. Both PEITC and SFN have been shown to inhibit activation
  of NFκB through inhibiting IκK. In addition, SFN have been shown to decrease DNA
  binding ability of NFκB
