caption: 'Proposed a model by which SMG inhibits ERK/β-catenin signaling pathway and
  thus suppresses dermal fibroblastic differentiation of BMSCs. After exposure to
  SMG, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was decreased and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling was
  downregulated, followed by the inhibition of dermal fibroblastic differentiation.
  After LiCl treatment, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling was upregulated and thus dermal
  fibroblastic differentiation of BMSCs was recovered under SMG conditions. After
  tBHQ treatment, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was enhanced, and thus the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling was improved under SMG conditions. Collectively, SMG could suppress ERK/β-catenin
  to inhibit dermal fibroblastic differentiation of BMSCs. SMG: simulated microgravity;
  BMSCs: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells; p-ERK1/2: phosphorylation of
  extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2; tBHQ: tert-Butylhydroquinone; LiCl:
  lithium chloride. “+”/color green lines indicate stimulation; “–”/color red lines
  indicate inhibition.'
