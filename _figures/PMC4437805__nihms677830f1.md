caption: Wnt signaling pathways. a) In canonical Wnt pathway, β-catenin is normally
  degraded by the destruction complex composed of Axin, APC, CK1, and GSK3β. Upon
  Wnt ligand binding to the frizzled (FZ/FDZ) and LRP5/6 co-receptor, disheveled (Dsh/Dvl)
  disassembles the β-catenin destruction complex, resulting in an accumulation of
  β-catenin that can enter the nucleus. In conjunction with TCF/LEF, β-catenin transcriptionally
  activates target genes. In non-canonical Wnt/Planar cell polarity pathway (Wnt/PCP),
  its activation is mediated by Wnt ligand binding to the FZ/FDZ and co-receptors
  Ror1, Ror2, or Ryk. Wnt/PCP is mediated by small GTPases RhoA and Rac1 to activate
  JNK and ROCK pathways, respectively, resulting in actin remodeling events. In Wnt/Ca2+pathway,
  the activation of FZ/FDZ is mediated by disheveled and heterotrimetic G-proteins.
  Calcium release activates PKC, calcineurin, and CamKII that activates cell migration.
  b) Wnt proteins are N-glycosylated and lipid modified by the oligosacchary transferase
  complex and acyltransferase Porcupine within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), respectively.
  Wnts are then engaged by Wntless (Wls) for secretory pathway transit and extracellular
  secretion. Wnt-Wls complex is transferred from ER to Golgi in COP II regulated vesicles,
  and from the Golgi to extracellular matrix in secretory vesicles [,]. Secretion
  mechanisms of Wnts are not completely understood; however, it has been reported
  that Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs) are involved in Wnt stabilization in
  extracellular matrix []. After secretion, the Wnt ligand may be enzymatically inactivated
  by Tiki1 or Notum. Tiki1 is a protease that cleaves the amino terminal residues
  of Wnt [], and Notum removes an essential palmitoleate moiety from Wnt []. Functional
  Wnts are then targeted to their receptors (FZ/FZD) via one of the proposed models
  mentioned in the text. Following extracellular release of Wnts, Wls is routed to
  multicellular vesicles for lysosomal degradation or shuttled back to the Golgi by
  retromer mediated targeting [–]. Golgi targeted Wls is transported to the ER by
  ADP-Ribosylation Factor family proteins (ARF) regulated COP I vesicles and Endoplasmic
  Reticulum-Golgi Intermediate Compartment protein 2 (ERGIC2) for subsequent rounds
  of loading ([]; EMS and SST, unpublished).
