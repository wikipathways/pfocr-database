caption: Patient-specific networks were developed from the stemness pathway hallmarks
  and revealed distinct regions of the network were differentially activated across
  the CRPC patient samples. This suggests that while the stemness pathway hallmarks
  were enriched in all the patients evaluated, a patient-specific evaluation is needed
  to determine the precise targets for therapy. Genes and edges that are not represented
  in the patient-specific network but are in the scaffold network are shown in light
  grey.
