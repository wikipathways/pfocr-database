caption: a The most common type of glycolysis, the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) pathway,
  and the TCA cycle. The normalized abundance levels of the intracellular metabolites
  of S. cerevisiae strain EJ4 grown on galactose (GAL), glucose (GLC), xylose (XYL),
  or cellobiose (CB) related to the EMP pathway and TCA cycle are shown in box-whisker
  plots. The x-axis labels in the box-whisker plots represent the four different carbon
  sources with two different sampling timepoints, 1, mid-exponential phase; 2, late-exponential
  phase. b Extracellular accumulation of trisaccharide, glycerol, and fumarate during
  glucose fermentation by strain EJ4 is presented in box-whisker plots
papertitle: Promiscuous activities of heterologous enzymes lead to unintended metabolic
  rerouting in Saccharomyces cerevisiae engineered to assimilate various sugars from
  renewable biomass.
