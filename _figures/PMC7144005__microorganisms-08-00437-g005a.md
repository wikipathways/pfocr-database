caption: 'The flux distribution maps between the serine cycle, EMC pathway and TCA
  cycle. The maps were drawn with the help of Escher software []. The circles refer
  to metabolites, the arrows refer to reactions, and numbers refer to flux values
  in mmol gDCW−1 h−1. (a) Reference map for metabolite names, carbon and energy balance.
  CRN refers to crotonyl-CoA, 3HB refers to 3-hydroxybutyrate, AACOA refers to acetoacetyl-CoA,
  PEP refers to phosphoenolpyruvate, OAA refers to oxaloacetate, AKG refers to alpha-ketoglutarate,
  FUM refers to fumarate, MAL refers to malate; S- and R-MMCOA refer to S- and R-methylmalonyl-CoA
  respectively; and PPCOA refers to propionyl-CoA. (b) Unconstrained flux distribution
  map. No acetyl-CoA production flux via pyruvate is recorded. (c) Flux distribution
  when 1/3 of acetyl-CoA is forced to be produced from pyruvate. D,E,F refers to reversible
  TCA flux distribution maps: (d) 2-oxoglutarate is allowed to be produced from succinyl-CoA
  via reversible 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction; (e) 2-oxoglutarate is allowed
  to be produced from succinyl-CoA via forward 2-oxoacid ferredoxin synthase reaction
  only; (f) both irreversible 2-oxoglutarate reaction and 2-oxoacid ferredoxin synthase
  reactions are allowed to carry flux.'
