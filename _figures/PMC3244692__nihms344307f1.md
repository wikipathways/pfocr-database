caption: (A) In juvenile wild-type mice, closing one eye for several days causes the
  loss of projections on the inactive pathway from the retina to the visual cortex
  (red lines for this polysynaptic pathway) and gains on the active pathway (green).
  In the adult, several pathways function as brakes on this plasticity in ocular dominance.
  Lynx1 inhibits nAChRs. Myelin inhibitors or CSPG-rich perineuronal nets also prevent
  rearrangement (, ). Specific interventions can remove each of these brakes, including
  acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE-I), NgR decoy protein, and chondroitinase
  (ChABC). (B) Nicotinic receptors are found on both pre- and postsynaptic elements
  of excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons. Regulation of nAChRs by Lynx1 likely
  influences the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition, and calcium influx
  through nAChRs may contribute to biochemical signaling pathways.
