caption: Fluorescence-based monitoring of Sec-secretion stress in C. glutamicum and
  detection of secreted target protein by the split GFP assay. The overproduction
  of secretory proteins promotes accumulation of incompletely or misfolded proteins
  at the membrane-cell envelope interface. To alleviate this secretion stress, cells
  typically respond by the upregulation of the extra-cytoplasmic protease HtrA, which
  is able to degrade the misfolded proteins at the trans-side of the cytoplasmic membrane
  (CM). In C. glutamicum, a two-component system consisting of a sensory kinase (SK)
  and a response regulator (RR) is likely involved in regulation of expression of
  the adjacent htrA gene (). In the C. glutamicum K9 biosensor strain, the htrA gene
  has been replaced by the eyfp gene, while leaving the htrA signal transduction pathway
  intact. The fluorescent reporter strain allows the monitoring of Sec-dependent secretion
  of recombinant proteins in a dose-dependent manner (). The actual mechanism(s) and
  protein systems facilitating the transport of proteins across the mycolic acid outer
  membrane (OM) of C. glutamicum still remain an enigma. For detection of the target
  protein in the extracellular medium, we adapted the split GFP technology (; ) that
  previously had been adopted to monitor recombinant protein secretion in B. subtilis
  (). For this purpose, the eleventh β-sheet of GFP, is fused via a flexible linker
  to the C-terminus of the target protein (in our studies the model enzyme cutinase).
  The non-fluorescent detector GFP, which lacks eleventh β-sheet (GFP1-10) is produced
  separately in E. coli and purified from inclusion bodies. Combining the GFP11-tagged
  protein with the detector GFP1-10 enables reconstitution of functional fluorescent
  GFP. Subsequent measurement of the split GFP fluorescence allows detection and quantification
  of the secreted target protein. The white box indicates the signal peptide (SP);
  the green box indicates the GFP11-tag; SPase, signal peptidase.
