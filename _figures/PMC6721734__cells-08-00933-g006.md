caption: Molecular interplay between estrogen, EGF, and Notch signaling pathways in
  FTEC ciliogenesis. This schematic view illustrates the role of estrogen in multiple
  ciliogenesis of motile cilia. First, the activation of ERβ by estrogen suppresses
  DLL1, leading to the downregulation of Notch signaling in ciliating cells. FOXJ1
  is a master regulator of multiple ciliogenesis, which is indirectly inhibited by
  Notch pathway. Therefore, inhibition of Notch pathway by estrogen facilitates the
  ciliogenesis of motile cilia. While there is no definitive evidence in this study,
  the possibility still exists that ERβ directly induces FOXJ1. Second, EGFR-MEK-ERK
  pathway stimulate Notch signal to maintain a proliferative state or induce differentiation
  into other cell types. Treatments with gefitinib or DAPT respectively suppress EGF
  and NOTCH pathway, and consequently induce ciliogenesis. There are several other
  pathways acting on the NOTCH gene. Ciliogenesis is established on the balance of
  many signaling machinery such as hormones, growth factors, and cell-to-cell communication.
