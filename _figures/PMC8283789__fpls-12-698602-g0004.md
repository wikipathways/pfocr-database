caption: Gene expression model for the lignin and cellulose biosynthesis pathway.
  (A) Branch of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway that is related to lignin biosynthesis.
  (B) Branch of starch and sucrose metabolism pathway that is related to cellulose
  biosynthesis. The heatmaps in each pathway are visualized according to gene expression
  levels. In the color bar, red indicates a high expression level and green a low
  expression level in P. alba × P. glandulosa; yellow corresponds to high expression
  level and blue a low expression level in L. kaempferi. The dotted arrows in the
  pathways denote an indirect linkage. The solid arrows refer to a direct relationship
  during compound synthesis. Numbers in the graph are EC identifier of corresponding
  enzyme.
