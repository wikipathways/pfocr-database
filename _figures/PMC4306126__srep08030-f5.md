caption: RSLV stimulates both HSFA1-dependent and –independent pathways (white arrows).
  RSLVs are possibly involved in the upstream of signaling pathway triggered by abiotic
  stresses accompanied by oxidative stress. Proteotoxic stress such as heat and ROS
  are accepted by HSFA1s to drive HSFA1-denpendent pathway (black arrows).
