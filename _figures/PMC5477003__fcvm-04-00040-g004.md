caption: CD40L and its receptors in thrombosis and hemostasis. (1) Monomeric CD40L
  is stored in α- and dense granules of platelets. Upon platelet activation and degranulation,
  CD40L is mobilized to the cell surface and forms biologically active trimers. These
  are shed within minutes to hours by ADAMs and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and
  released as monomers of soluble CD40L (sCD40L). These have been reported to form
  dimers and trimers in circulation that a biologically active. (2) Platelet-expressed
  CD40L binds to its receptors on leukocytes, α5β1 and CD40, but not αMβ2 (Mac-1),
  to form platelet–leukocyte aggregates. Notably, platelet-expressed CD40 can bind
  to CD40L-expressing leukocytes, such as activated T cells. (3) Ligation of platelet-expressed
  receptors, α5β1 and CD40, by CD40L initiates platelet activation cascades that eventually
  result in the surface expression of platelet receptors, such as P-selectin, degranulation,
  aggregation, and spreading. CD40 ligation on platelets activates a TRAF-2 dependent,
  but not TRAF-6 dependent, signaling pathway. It is a controversy whether ligation
  of α2bβ3 by CD40L participates in platelet activation. However, physical interactions
  between platelet-expressed α2bβ3 and CD40L, as well as between CD40 and CD40L, help
  to stabilize platelet aggregates and fuel thrombus growth. Binding of platelet CD40L
  and of sCD40L to its endothelial receptors CD40 and α5β1 promotes endothelial cell
  activation, pro-inflammatory gene expression, and secretion of coagulation factors,
  including tissue factor, which in turn can amplify thrombosis and coagulation.
