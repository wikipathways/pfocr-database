caption: The pathway by which yeast make, accumulate and then consume ethanol. Enzymes
  in red are associated with gene duplications that, according to the transition redundant
  exchange clock, arose nearly contemporaneously. The make-accumulate-consume pathway
  is boxed. The shunting of the carbon atoms from pyruvate into (and then out of,
  blue arrows) ethanol is energy-expensive, consuming a molecule of ATP (green) for
  every molecule of ethanol generated. This ATP is not consumed if pyruvate is oxidatively
  decarboxylated directly to acetyl-coenzyme A to enter the citric acid cycle directly
  (dashed arrow to the right). If dioxygen is available, the recycling of NADH does
  not need the acetaldehyde-to-ethanol reduction.
