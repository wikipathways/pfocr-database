caption: Simplified diagram on the regulation of the RAS superfamilty of small GTPases
  and the role of NF1. RAS proteins become active versus inactive if bound to GTP
  and GDP, respectively. Extracellular growth factor signals (red circle) are transmitted
  through growth factor receptors (light blue) to guanine nucleotide exchange factors
  (GEF), which activate RAS (red) by exchanging GDP for GTP. In contrast, GTPase activating
  proteins, including NF1, tend to keep RAS proteins in their inactive state (light
  blue). Please note the promiscuity of RAS signaling which activate several signaling
  pathways, including the MAPK as well as the PI3K-Akt pathway.
