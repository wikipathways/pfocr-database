caption: RSV infection induces TLR signaling. TLR2/TLR4 signaling is activated by
  RSV G (TLR2) and RSV F (TLR4) proteins. TLR stimulation recruits the myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88 (MyD88) adaptor protein, which interacts with TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6), which helps transmit signals between receptors and other proteins
  to activate MAPKs and induce the translocation of NF-κB and the production of cytokines.
  CD14, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein, can chaperone TLR agonists
  like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to the TLR4 signaling. Central to the MAPK signaling
  pathway is a three-tiered kinase module comprising MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K).
  Upon activation, MAP3K phosphorylates and activates MAP2K, which then phosphorylates
  and activates MAPK. This sequential activation is a hallmark of the MAPK signaling
  pathway. There are several MAPK pathways, the most studied being ERK, JNK, and p38
  MAP kinases. Different stimuli activate each of these pathways and lead to distinct
  cellular responses. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) is an essential
  component of the JNK signal transduction pathway activated by proinflammatory cytokines.
  Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) directly phosphorylates and activates
  JNK in response to cellular stresses. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3/6
  (MKK3/6) is the main MAPKK that phosphorylates and activates p38 MAPK. MAP2K1, or
  MEK1, mediates tyrosine phosphorylation and threonine in ERK1 or ERK2
