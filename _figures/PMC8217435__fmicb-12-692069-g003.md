caption: BTV sensing by PRRs. (A) Ubiquitously expressed RLRs can detect BTV dsRNA
  presence in the cytoplasm. RIG-I and MDA-5 are involved in BTV recognition and this
  triggers a signaling cascade that results in IFN induction through activation of
  the MAVS/TBK1 pathway. (B) In macrophages, TLR3 in endosomes can also recognize
  BTV dsRNA resulting in IFN induction and the generation of an antiviral state. (C)
  In plasmacytoid DC, which do not express TLR3, PKR is involved in dsRNA recognition
  in the cytoplasm and IFN induction. IFN induction in these cells is also dependent
  on the adaptor MyD88 for IFN induction, but recognition is independent of TLR7.
  Whether other dsRNA sensors, such as DEXD/H-box helicases are involved upstream
  of MyD88 for dsRNA sensing in pDCs has yet to be determined.
