caption: Diagrammatic sketch of complement activation and regulation during haemolysis
  initiated by mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and the MASP enzymes (designated M1 and
  M2) via the lectin pathway (solid thick line) after reacting with mannan (M)-coated
  sheep erythrocytes. The scaffolded lines represent the inhibitory effects of complement
  regulatory proteins C4bp and factor H on C4b and C3b, respectively. The enhanced
  binding of both regulatory proteins during MBL-initiated complement activation is
  indicated by the thin double line, although the mechanism by which this occurs is
  not yet clear. The classical and alternative pathways are indicated by thin solid
  and dotted lines, respectively; arrows in the complement pathways indicate enzymatic
  cleavages.
