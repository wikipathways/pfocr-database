caption: 'Associated receptors and their signaling pathways involved in angiogenesis.
  On the figure we can identify the different angiogenesis receptors and the pathways
  they stimulate. These stimulations ultimately lead to a variety of processes involved
  in angiogenesis, such as cell proliferation, migration, and survival. EGFR stimulates
  the RAS/RAF/ERK/MAPK (also called MAPK-ERK) and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
  These pathways are also stimulated by VGFR, PDGF, and FGFR. The latter (FDFR) also
  triggers the STAT3/NF-κβ pathway. Data source: Review article “Molecular mechanisms
  involved in angiogenesis and potential target of anti-angiogenesis in human glioblastomas”
  by Xu Y, Yuan FE, Chen QX, and Liu BH [] and published in an open access journal.'
