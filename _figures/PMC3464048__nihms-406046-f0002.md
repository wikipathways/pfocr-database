caption: STATs serve as the converging point for many signaling pathways that are
  mediated through cytokine receptors, growth factor receptors and nonreceptor tyrosine
  kinases, which are commonly activated in cancer cells. First, stimulation of cells
  with growth factors or cytokines results in the activation of intrinsic receptor
  tyrosine kinase activity or of receptor-associated kinases. These kinases in turn
  phosphorylate the receptor cytoplasmid tail to provide docking sites for STAT monomers
  via their SH2 domain, resulting in phosphorylation of STATs by JAKs or Src kinases.
  Oncogenic Src and Abl can also phosphorylate STATs in a receptor-independent manner.
  Second, the phosphorylated STAT monomers dimerize and translocate to the nucleus.
  Finally, STATs bind to specific STAT DNA-response elements and directly regulate
  the expression of a variety of gene expression that are critical for cell proliferation
  (e.g., cyclin D1 and cyclin D2), survival (e.g., survivin), angiogenesis (e.g.,
  VEGF) and immune evasion (e.g., immune-suppressing factor). In normal cells, STAT
  activation is tightly regulated; however, constitutive activation of STATs, in particular
  STAT3, is associated with human cancer development. Consequently, STAT3 emerges
  as an attractive target for cancer therapy. Proposed therapeutic interventions include
  JAK inhibitors (e.g., CYT387), preventing STAT3 dimerization (e.g., OPB-31121) and
  preventing STAT3 nuclear translocation (e.g., P(pTyr)LKTK and C48).
