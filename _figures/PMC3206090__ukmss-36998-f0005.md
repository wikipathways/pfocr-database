caption: Upregulation of autophagy is an efficient way to clear disease proteins in
  AD and HD, and therapeutic interventions have been tested against a variety of different
  targets. The balance between inhibition of autophagy by Akt and activation by AMPK
  has been shifted through treatment with resveratrol analogs, which increase AMPK
  activity. Inhibition of GSK3β through Lithium prevents excessive Tau phosphorylation
  and allows pro-survival CREB signalling (see above), autophagy is increased through
  inhibition of the IMPase pathway. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin and analog compounds
  lifts the block on autophagosome formation and is beneficial in both AD and HD mouse
  models. An mTOR independent pathway activating autophagy can be triggered by treatment
  with Valproate and is mediated a decrease in Inositol and IP3 levels. The Beclin
  1-PI3K type III complex promotes autophagosome formation and loss or inhibition
  of either protein is detrimental in mouse and cell culture models of AD and HD.
  Autophagosomes not only engulf aggregates of disease proteins present in the cytoplasm
  but are also capable of generating Aβ through γ-secretase cleavage. Upon fusion
  with the lysosome, the autophagosome becomes acidic and lysosomal proteases such
  as the cathepsins degrade the disease proteins. Deletion of the endogenous cathepsin
  inhibitor cystatin B is beneficial in an AD mouse model. Furthermore mHtt interferes
  with lysosome function by impairing vesicle transport from the Golgi, resulting
  in a decrease of proteases in the lysosome. PSEN1 deletion or mutations interfere
  with the acidification of the lysosome, thus reducing the activity of lysosomal
  proteases and rendering autophagic protein degradation less efficient.
