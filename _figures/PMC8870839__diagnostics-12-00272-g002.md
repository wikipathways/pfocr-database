caption: 'Summary of heme synthetic pathway, types of porphyrias and iron influences
  within the cell (cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments). Heme synthesis starts
  in mitochondria, with the condensation of succinyl-CoA with the amino acid glycine,
  activated by pyridoxal phosphate by ALA synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme of heme
  synthesis. ALA then enters the cytoplasm, where, in the presence of ALA dehydratase,
  porphobilinogen and water molecules are formed. Four PBG molecules are joined by
  PBG deaminase as hydroxymethylbilane. Linear tetrapyrrole cyclizes to form a ring
  known as uroporphyrinogen III with the participation of uroporphyrinogen III synthase.
  Through the activity of uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase (UROD), coproporphyrinogen
  III is generated. In mitochondria CPG is then transformed into protoporphyrinogen,
  which is then further oxidized to protoporphyrins. Finally, iron is incorporated
  to generate heme. In each specific form of porphyria (in blue) the activity of a
  specific enzyme (in red) in the heme biosynthetic pathway is defective and leads
  to accumulation of pathway intermediates. Iron (Fe2+) is involved in ALAS2 regulation
  via the IRE-IRP system, in FECH activity and possibly in UROD activity. Abbreviations:
