caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathways for the production of coronafacoyl phytotoxins
  in P. syringae and S. scabiei. The hypothetical pathway in P. syringae is indicated
  by blue arrows, whereas the hypothetical pathway in S. scabiei is indicated by red
  arrows. Biosynthetic intermediates that have been isolated from S. scabiei biosynthetic
  mutants are in hatched boxes.
