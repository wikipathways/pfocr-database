caption: Cooperation of Par-4 deficiency and PTEN haploinsufficiency in prostate cancer
  progression. Par-4 loss cooperates with PTEN heterozygosity to promote invasive
  prostate carcinoma. The simultaneous inactivation of Par-4 and PTEN enhances Akt
  and leads to a synergistic stimulation of the NFκB pathway. This sets in motion
  complementary signals regulating cell growth, cell survival, inflammation and angiogenesis
  that collaborate in prostate cancer progression. It is not known whether Akt is
  able to directly impinge on the NFκB pathway in this system.
