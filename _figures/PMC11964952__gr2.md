caption: Proposed chart of T1D dual vulnerability initiated by β-cell metabolic dysfunction
  and CD4+ T-cell activation. β-cell metabolic dysfunction processes (orange numbers).
  (1) Chronic exposure to hyperglycemia causes elevation of the carbohydrate response-element
  binding protein β (ChREBPβ) and Ca2+ influx, leading to increased transcription
  of proapoptotic TxNIP. (2) In the β-cell TxNIP upregulates transcription of NLRP3
  inflammasome, a protein complex responsible for caspase-1–dependent maturation of
  the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and gasdermin D(GSDMD)-mediated apoptotic
  cell death. (3) The onset of metabolic dysfunction may also arise from the impaired
  glutamate transmission and dysregulation of the β-cell’s N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors
  (NMDARs), which play a crucial role in controlling insulin secretion, electrical
  activity, and cell survival by modulating the influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) and
  sodium ions (Na+). Increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels cause increased permeability
  of mitochondria, altered mitochondrial respiration, the release of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), and activation of other proapoptotic factors. Breakdown of the depolarization
  mechanisms precludes repolarization via the opening of voltage-gated K+ channels
  (KV), which can have an excitotoxic effect on β-cells and increase intracellular
  Ca2+ levels. (4) β-cell metabolic dysfunction could suppress GABA synthesis from
  intracellular glutamate by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) and release of GABA
  from β-cells. GAD65 is one of the major target antigens in T1D, and GAD65 autoantibody
  is a diagnostic marker for T1D. Patients with T1D exhibit a significant reduction
  in plasma GABA levels. This impacts islet regulatory pathways, including a key β-cell
  mechanism for glucagon regulation in the α-cells via chloride (Cl-) influx through
  GABAAR and hyperpolarization of the α-cell plasma membrane. Insufficient extracellular
  GABA levels also hinder cAMP-dependent β-cell survival pathways, such as β-catenin-mediated
  (β-cat) signaling and GABAB receptor (GABABR) initiated PI3K-AKT-cascades. Additionally,
  reduced GABA signaling will also fail to inhibit T cell proliferation through activating
  GABAA Cl- channels and reducing the secretion of interferon gamma, IL-6, IL-12,
  IL-1β, and TNF-α. (5) Cellular stress includes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
  which triggers an unfolded protein response (UPR) consisting of impaired RNA transcription
  and translation, leading to depletion of ER Ca2+ stores and accumulation and release
  of misfolded proteins, hybrid insulin peptides (HIP) and increased autoantigen presentation.
  (6) Elevated serum DPP-4 (sDPP-4) levels are found to be elevated in T1D patients
  and degrade incretins such as GLP-1, thereby preventing incretin-induced cAMP downstream
  signaling in β-cells, which interferes with GSIS and impairs cAMP-dependent cell
  survival processes. (7) An inflammatory trigger event in β-cells (eg, viral infection
  via coxsackie and adenovirus receptor [CAR]) would initiate secretion of type I
  interferons (interferon-α/β) by the immune system or other cells, leading to activation
  of the JAK-STAT pathway and the NF-κB pathway and increase of ER stress in the β-cell.
  (8) interferon alfa has been identified as a key driver of increased expression
  of HLA class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC1) system
  on β-cells in the early stages of T1D. These MHC1 molecules bind β-cell–derived
  autoantigens (β-Ag) and activate CD8+ T-cells, as well as upregulate ER stress sensors
  and markers in the β-cell (eg, p-EIF2α, XBP1s, BIP, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP),
  ATF3, and ATF6). (9) The T1D-associated gene TYK2 contributes to the activation
  of interferon alfa-mediated MHC1 expression in β-cells. (10) HLA-DR3/4 and HLA-DQ2/8
  haplotypes of the HLA class II molecules of the MHC2 system are those associated
  with T1D. (11) Expression of MHC2 molecules by islet β-cells is an aberrant feature
  that confers β-cells the ability to bind β-Ag associated with T1D and engage CD4+
  T-cells in an antigen-presenting cell (APC)-like manner, initiating autoimmunity.
  2. Autoimmune processes (yellow numbers). Immune cell responses against antigens
  and β-cell–derived β-Ag play a central role in the pathogenesis of T1D. (1) Independently
  of MHC1 and MHC2 β-Ag presentation, β-cells under metabolic stress continuously
  secrete fused peptide fragments or hybrid insulin peptides (HIPs) that are recognized
  by APCs as autoantigen targets for pathogenic islet-infiltrating T-cells. (2) Some
  β-Ag are processed by APCs and presented to naïve CD4+ T-cells as antigens by MHC2
  molecules on the surface of the APC. (3) CD4+ T-cell activation and differentiation
  depends on the signal strength received by the T-cell receptor (TCR) via the binding
  of MHC2 and on costimulation signals. CD28 and membrane-bound DPP4 (mDPP4) are prominent
  co-stimulatory molecules controlling the activation and behavior of naïve CD4+ T-cells.
  The mDPP4-mediated signal can be co-stimulated with APC in a caveolin-1-mDPP4-CD45-CD3-dependent
  manner activating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, or by the adenosine deaminase
  (ADA)-mDPP4 pathway activating proinflammatory NF-κB transcription factors. (4)
  CD4+ T-cells depend on the membrane action potential that is initiated by TCR stimulation
  for activation, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, cytokine production, and proliferation.
  Autoantigen-activated MHC2-TCR complex depolarizes the T-cell membrane and opens
  KV1.3 channels that are part of a signaling complex with P56lck (LCK), previously
  associated with impaired T-cell activation in T1D. K+ efflux opens Ca2+ release-activated
  channels (CRAC), resulting in significant Ca2+ influx and opening of KCA3.1 channels,
  thereby sustaining prolonged Ca2+ entry that is needed for further T-cell activation,
  cytokine release, and proliferation. (5) Upon TCR-activation and metabolic reprogramming,
  CD4+ T-cells also upregulate the expression of NMDAR, which are glutamate-activated
  and have an effect on cytokine production, T-cell proliferation, and differentiation.
  (6) In APCs, mDPP4-caveolin-1 interaction upregulates the expression of CD86 and
  subsequent engagement and recruitment of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, and cytokine secretion.
  The production by the APCs of cytokines such as IL-12 and interferon gamma promotes
  and accelerates further differentiation of the CD4+ T-cells into Th1-type cells
  and inhibits CD4+ Th2 cell production of IL-4 and IL-10. Additionally, interferon
  gamma upregulates the expression of NADPH oxidase/NOX family proteins that transport
  electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and generate cytoplasmic reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). (7) Metabolic reprogramming of naïve CD4+ T-cells also leads
  to an increase in ROS and accelerated proliferation and activation of specialized
  immune cell subtypes, such as Th1, Th7, and Tfh. Activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells
  also secrete interferon gamma, IL-12, IL-18, and proinflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β,
  activating macrophages and stimulating the production of reactive nitrogen intermediates
  (RNIs). (8) Binding of CD8+ T-cells with β-cells, via a T-cell receptor (TCR)-MHC1
  complex induces β-cell death through secretion of toxic molecules, such as perforin
  and granzymes. T-cells and macrophages can also destroy β-cells by secreting nitric
  oxide (NO°) and cytotoxic cytokines, subsequently activating a NF-κB signaling profile.
  Importantly, secretion of these cytokines by CD4+ T-cells may also increase expression
  of MHC1 on β-cells and promote direct assaults by CD8+ T-cells. (9) Autoimmune assaults
  on the β-cells by ROS, RNIs, actions of cytokines, and granzymes that activate caspase
  enzymes, lead to β-cell apoptosis and/or necrosis
