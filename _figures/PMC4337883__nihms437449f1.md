caption: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies with cells, animal models and
  human studies have revealed deregulated choline metabolism in cancer. Oncogenic
  pathways (shown in light red), tumour suppressor pathways (dark red) and molecules
  that are associated with choline metabolism (green) in cancer are shown in the upper
  circle. These studies have led to the use of MRS for cancer detection and for following
  the treatment-induced changes in total choline-containing compounds (tCho) to determine
  response to therapy. The association of choline metabolism with cancer has also
  led to the development of inhibitors that target enzymes in the pathway, and a Phase
  I clinical trial with a choline kinase-α (CHKα) inhibitor has been initiated. COX2,
  cyclooxygenase 2; HIF1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1.
