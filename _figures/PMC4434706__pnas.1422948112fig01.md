caption: Two S-phase checkpoint responses in S. cerevisiae. The S-phase checkpoint
  is triggered in the DNA damage signaling pathway by replication protein A (RPA)-coated
  DNA (red circles) resulting from ssDNA repair intermediates, resected ends of double-stranded
  breaks, or collapsed replication forks. In the replication stress signaling pathway,
  the S-phase checkpoint is triggered by stalled replication forks (α, δ, ε; replicative
  DNA polymerases). The two signaling pathways converge at Mec1/Ddc2, which phosphorylates
  Rad53 with the help of Rad9 (DNA damage) or Mrc1 (replication stress). Phospho-Rad53
  then activates Dun1, which, in turn, inactivates three repressors (Sml1, Crt1, and
  Dif1) of RNR. RNR generates dNDPs from NDPs, which are then converted to dNTPs by
  nucleoside diphosphate kinases. Higher dNTP concentrations facilitate DNA repair
  and replication fork restart. Blue lines are signals that increase dNTP pools. Red
  lines are signals that repress dNTP pools. Adapted from ref. .
