caption: Causal pathway diagram. Prior to finalizing the inclusion/exclusion criteria
  and hypotheses for this study, a causal diagram was developed to visually encode
  a priori assumptions about the relation between exposure (previously undiagnosed
  versus previously diagnosed diabetes), outcomes, and covariates, taking into account
  the strengths and limitations of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
  (SEER) - Medicare database. The diagram depicts directed paths (a head-to-tail sequence
  of arrows, or a “one-way street”) between previously undiagnosed diabetes and both
  cancer stage at diagnosis and mortality. One of the directed paths between previously
  undiagnosed diabetes and mortality contains cancer stage as an intermediate variable.
  In other words, the impact of previously undiagnosed diabetes on mortality is partially
  explained by its intermediate impact on cancer stage. The other directed path contains
  no intermediate variables. In addition, the diagram depicts undirected paths (paths
  in which the arrows are not all head-to-tail) between previously undiagnosed diabetes
  and both cancer stage at diagnosis and mortality, which “flow through” patient demographic,
  socioeconomic, and clinical characteristics. In this instance, the undirected paths
  between previously undiagnosed diabetes, cancer stage, and mortality are biasing
  paths (and the variables on those paths are potential confounders) for the association
  between exposure and outcomes because they do not represent effects of previously
  undiagnosed diabetes on the outcomes, yet can contribute to (confound) the association
  between previously undiagnosed diabetes and outcomes. These should be “blocked”
  either by study design, including patient selection, or by adjustment in the analyses,
  to maximize the likelihood that the observed residual associations between exposure
  and outcomes are unbiased.
