caption: The rate-limiting step in monoamine synthesis is the production of a key
  cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (THB), which is regulated by the enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase
  I (Punch) that makes dihydroneopterin triphosphate from guanosine triphosphate (1).
  L-Dopa is then produced from tyrosine by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (pale)
  in the presence of the THB co-factor (2). Finally, dopa decarboxylase produces dopamine
  from L-dopa (3).
