caption: Shh binds to the cell surface receptor Ptch, relieves the inhibition of Smo
  and triggers Shh signaling. Activation of the Shh pathway results in increased levels
  of Gli1 expression and activation of the downstream Ras-MEK-ERK pathway, causing
  cell proliferation. In WT neurospheres cultured in the presence of EGF, PIC signals
  via TLR3 to inhibit Gli1 expression and interfere with MEK and ERK phosphorylation.
  Inhibition of MEK-ERK activation results in the decreased proliferation and induced
  Fas expression and apoptosis observed after PIC treatment of primary cortical neurospheres.
