caption: The putative origin of EV-DNA. The exact mechanisms of EV-DNA packaging remain
  obscure. 1 In micronucleated cells, EV-DNA loading may occur in the cytoplasm via
  the endosomal tetraspanins like CD63. 2 cfDNA released by dead cells could also
  be a source of EV-DNA by sticking on the surface of released EVs. Upon uptake, EV-DNA
  induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the so-called cGAS/STING
  pathway. Figure generated in Biorender
