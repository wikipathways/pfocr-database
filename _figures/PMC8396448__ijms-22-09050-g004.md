caption: Simple scheme of the intrinsic survival and regenerative pathways. The figures
  include only two major pathways; the mTOR pathways and the JAK/STAT pathways. In
  addition, not all cAMP signaling pathways are included because of the limited space.
  First, the neurotrophic factors (NFs) such as BDNF bind with their receptors and
  receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is activated. Then, PI3K is phosphorylated resulting
  in an increase of PIP3 accumulation. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) are inhibitors
  of the mTOR pathway []. PTEN dephosphorylates PIP3, resulting in the accumulation
  of PIP2. The accumulated PIP3 recruits PDK1 and the corresponding residue (T308)
  of Akt kinase is phosphorylated. At the same time, the other residue (Thr308) of
  Akt kinase is phosphorylated by mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). A full activated Akt by
  double phosphorylation by PDK1 and mTORC2 inhibits TSC2 which results in converting
  Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb)-GTP to Rheb-GDP. The TSC1/2 complex inhibits
  the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Thus, the inhibition of mTORC1 via TSC1/2 complex is
  eliminated by the Akt signaling pathway. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor
  4E-binding proteins (4EBPs) bind tightly to eukaryotic initiation factor-4E (eIF4E).
  Activated mTORC1 dislocates two proteins, resulting in relieving their inhibition
  of the initiation of protein synthesis. Both 4EBPs inhibition and S6K1 activation
  facilitate adult optic nerve regeneration []. On the other hand, activated mTORC2
  is thought to promote the dendrite extension and the reestablishment of the arbor
  area []. Another major intrinsic survival and regenerative pathway is the JAK/STAT
  pathway. The JAK/STAT pathway is activated by several stress-related cytokines such
  as IL-6 family cytokines including IL-6, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and
  leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The figure shows that LIF and their receptor subunits,
  glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and LIF receptor. Gp130, are common receptor subunits of
  the IL-6 family cytokines and after binding with these cytokines, the JAK/STAT pathway
  is activated. The intrinsic inhibitor of the JAK/STAT pathway is a suppressor of
  cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) []. After activation of JAK, STAT family members make
  homodimers or heterodimers which regulate specific genes involved in the survival
  and regeneration of the optic nerve axons. The cAMP signaling is activated by electrical
  activity and enhances the regenerative effect of several neurotrophic factors [].
  The downstream of cAMP signaling includes protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein
  activated by cAMP (EPAC). The precise mechanisms of cAMP signaling is still unclear
  but electrical activity may stimulate cAMP synthesis and facilitate axonal regeneration
  after injury []. NFs, neurotrophic factors; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; PI3K,
