caption: GPCR signaling. Agonist-activated GPCRs promote the dissociation of GDP bound
  to the α subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins and its replacement by GTP. Gα and
  Gβγ subunits can then activate numerous downstream effectors. The 16 human G protein
  α subunits can be divided into the four subfamilies, and a single GPCR can couple
  to one or more families of Gα subunits. Downstream effectors regulated by their
  targets include a variety of second messenger systems (red), GEFs (yellow), and
  Rho and Ras GTPases (green), which will result in the stimulation of multiple kinase
  cascades (blue) regulating key cellular functions. These include members of the
  MAPK, AKT, and mTOR, second messenger regulated kinases and phosphatases, and multiple
  kinases regulated by Rho and Ras GTPases. In addition, Gαs-coupled receptors inhibit
  and Gα12/13-, Gαi-, and Gαq/11-coupled receptors activate the transcription coactivator
  YAP and its related protein TAZ, the most downstream targets of the Hippo kinase
  cascade, as well as β-catenin and the Shh pathway, among others. Ultimately, these
  large numbers of effector molecules can have multiple effects in the cytosol and
  nucleus to regulate gene expression, cell metabolism, migration, proliferation,
  and survival by GPCRs, which can contribute to normal and malignant cell growth.
