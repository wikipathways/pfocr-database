caption: A proposed working model. In the circadian pathway in the response to blue
  light, CRY promotes the transcription of downstream genes COP1 and SPA1 after perceiving
  the blue light signal, which leads to the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of
  downstream gene HY5. Meanwhile, the transcript level of HY5 is increased. Under
  low temperature condition, the expression of HY5 is downregulated in wucai. HY5
  modulates the expression of two genes CHLH and PSY, which play a key role in the
  biosynthetic pathway of Chl and Car. The downregulation of CHLH and PSY leads to
  a reduced ratio of Chl/Car, which finally promotes leaf yellowing in wucai. The
  solid lines represent verified relationships, and the dashed lines indicate that
  the relationships need to be further investigated
