caption: 'Simplified overview of the main fluxes involved in one-carbon metabolism
  (inspired by reference []). One-carbon cycles act as a biochemical network to sustain
  fundamental physiological functions, overall DNA and histone methylation, dNTP synthesis,
  and GSH generation (red rectangles). Several molecular inputs (green rectangles)
  actively fuel the pathway, generating a number of intermediate metabolites (grey
  rectangles) through which carbon units are cycled. Abbreviations: dihydrofolate
  (DHF); tetrahydrofolate (THF); methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF); formyltetrahydrofolate
  (FTHF); dimethylglycine (DMG); methionine (MET); S-adenosylmethionine (SAM); S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH); cysteine (CYS); glutathione (GSH).'
