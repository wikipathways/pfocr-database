caption: Crosstalk between Macrophages I/II cells and dying cancer cells in the tumor
  microenvironment. Tumor cells affect the function of macrophages by releasing DAMPs
  such as KRAS-G12D, HMGB1, 8-OHG, and PGE2 through ferroptosis. Pancreatic cancer
  cells can release KRAS-G12D during ferroptosis, whose exocytosis is largely dependent
  on autophagosome-derived amphisomes. KRAS-G12D triggers M2 cells polarization by
  binding to AGER which might induce adaptive immunosuppression. In addition, iron-addicted
  cancer cells activate STING-dependent DNA sensor pathways in M1 cells through the
  release of 8-OHG to create an inflammatory microenvironment for tumor growth. Similarly,
  PGE2, induced by ferroptotic cancer cells can act on DNMT3A, causing DNA methylation
  thus suppressing immunogenic genes. M1 cells are more resistant to ferroptosis than
  M2 cells, even in the absence of GPX4. Mechanically, iNOS which is highly expressed
  in M1 cells but inhibited in M2 cells produces more NO•, replacing GPX4 as a negative
  regulator of ferroptosis. Furthermore, excessive lipid accumulation in macrophages
  can prevent autophagy in obese mice, thus promoting the conversion of macrophages
  into pro-inflammatory M1 cells. In the TME, IL-6, and CCL2 trigger autophagy by
  binding to IL-6R and CCR2, respectively, which is essential for macrophage polarization
  to M2 phenotype. Furthermore, in M2 cells, TLR2 signaling inhibits the NF-κB signaling
  pathway through selective autophagy. TLR2 signaling also promotes sustained phosphorylation
  of MAPK1 and MAPK3, which stimulates autophagy-dependent NF-κB regulation. Autophagy
  can be inhibited in M2 cells regulated by TLR4-mTOR pathway. In addition, triggered
  by NLRP3 inflammasome, tumor cell-derived IL-1β and IL-18 recruit M1/2 cells to
  inhibit or promote tumor progression
