caption: Signaling in monocytes/macrophages differs with LPS dose. High-dose LPS-activated
  monocytes/macrophages activate the NF-κB pathway and induce inflammatory responses.
  Whereas low-dose LPS-activated monocytes/macrophages inactive the NF-κB pathway
  and suppress inflammatory responses. The response of signaling pathways in LPS-activated
  monocytes/macrophages differs with LPS dose.
