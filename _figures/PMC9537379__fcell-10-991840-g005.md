caption: 'Mechanism of inducing regulatory T cells by regulatory B cells. Bregs promote
  development of Tregs via both cell: cell contact with CD4+ T cells and the secretion
  of immunomodulatory cytokines. IL-35 promotes the differentiation of Bregs through
  stimulating STAT1/STAT3 via binding pairing of IL-35 receptor IL-12p35 and Ebi3
  or binding subunit IL-12p35 and Ebi3 alone. Bregs themselves can produce IL-35 and
  promote Tregs in an IL-35-mediated manner. IL-35 receptor in Treg, which is composed
  of an IL-12Rβ2/gp130 heterodimer, is activated to induce STAT1-and STAT4-signaling
  to benefit Tregs. Besides, Bregs can also secret other immunoregulatory cytokines,
  in particular IL-10 together with TGF-β, to regulate Treg. Additionally, co-stimulatory
  molecules CD80/CD86 are also critical for Bregs to promote development of Tregs.
  Breg can generate PD-L1 due to the MAPK/NF-κB pathway by LMP1 and advance the growth
  of Tregs via PD-L1/PD-1 signaling.'
