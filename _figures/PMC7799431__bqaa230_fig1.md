caption: Core clock feedback loop and interactors. The core clock is composed of transcriptional
  activators (green) and suppressors (red). The heterodimer of the basic helix-loop-helix
  transcription factors (BMAL1 and either CLOCK or the clock paralog NPAS2, which
  is not shown here) represents the forward limb of the clock in mammalian cells.
  BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimers bind to genomic enhancer elements, activating the transcription
  of circadian clock output genes during the dark period in nocturnal rodents. There
  are 2 repressor pathways which are active during the lights-on period. Increased
  transcription and activity of the transcriptional repressors Rev-erbα and Rev-erbβ
  results in the suppression of BMAL1, constituting a feedback loop that inhibits
  the forward limb. The second pathway involves heterodimers of cryptochrome (CRY)
  and period (PER) proteins. This heterodimer represses the transcriptional activity
  of the BMAL1:CLOCK/NPAS2 heterodimers. Competition for binding to ROR/REV-ERB Response
  Element (RRE) between the Rev-erb transcriptional repressors with RORα/γ, which
  are transcriptional activators, contributes to rhythms in the period of transcriptional
  activation or repression of large clusters of genes involved in metabolic processes.
  Examples of how the activity of this clock is modulated by nutrient sensors are
  included. Several of the transcription factors contain a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain
  that is responsive to metabolites, xenobiotics, and oxygen levels. SIRT1 suppresses
  transcriptional activity of BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimers, providing a link between the
  core clock to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis by nicotinamide
  phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT). NAD acts as a coenzyme in oxygen-reduction (redox)
  reactions and is a substrate for Sirtuins (SIRT) that use NAD+ to remove acetyl
  groups from proteins. adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase C (AMPK)
  is a cellular energy sensor that regulates clock activity through phosphorylating
  and destabilizing CRY and PER proteins. CRY proteins also form ligand-dependent
  heterodimers with glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) to repress their activity. This
  is a simplified schematic and does not include epigenetic modifiers that interact
  with the core clock genes to affect rhythms in the expression of thousands of genes.
