caption: The NLR proteins NAIP, NLRC3, NLRX1, NLRP12 and AIM2 have all been shown
  to protect against CRC via inflammasome-independent pathways in the intestinal epithelium.
  Following NAIP knockout, epithelial cells fail to activate p53 and have elevated
  STAT3 phosphorylation following AOM exposure []. Nlrc3−/− mice had elevated STAT3
  phosphorylation, IκBα and AKT levels following AOM/DSS exposure []. ApcMin/+Nlrx1−/−
  mice had increased activation of NFκB, MAPK, STAT3 []. NLRP12 deletion resulted
  in non-canonical NFκB activation via NFκB-induced kinase (NIK) and increased ERK
  signalling, which affects multiple TFs [,]. AIM2 has been shown to suppress the
  PI3K/AKT pathway [,,]. These pathways promote cancer via transcription of cell growth,
  proliferation and anti-apoptosis genes. Figure created in Biorender.com.
