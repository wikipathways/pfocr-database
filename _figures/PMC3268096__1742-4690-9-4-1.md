caption: Metabolic pathway of AA transformation into eicosanoid products. Once a cell
  is activated by a proinflammatory stimulus that engages a Gαq-coupled seven-transmembrane
  receptor, AA can be cleaved by cytosolic PLA2 from phospholipids that compose cellular
  membranes (mostly nuclear, endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi membranes)[]. Free AA
  can subsequently be converted into different eicosanoid products by different enzymes
  (represented in blue), notably the COX and LO pathways. This review will mainly
  focus on the prostanoids - PGE2, and 15d-PGJ2 prostaglandins - and on 5-LO products,
  namely LTs. Only eicosanoids and pathways of interest in this paper are depicted.
