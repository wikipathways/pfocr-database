caption: Regulation of Hepcidin Expression. Circulating hepcidin regulates the amount
  of iron released into the blood from macrophages and especially hepatocytes. Decreased
  hepcidin expression occurs when the rate of erythropoiesis increases (e.g., in response
  to anemia), leading to increased ferroportin expression causing increased iron transfer
  into blood. In contrast, hepcidin expression is increased by elevated plasma iron
  (Tf-Fe2) or inflammation to counteract an oversaturation of Tf or iron loss, preventing
  the formation of cytotoxic NTBI. The liver directly senses circulating iron bound
  to Tf or indirectly in response to iron-induced BMP6. Increased hepatic iron levels
  induce the expression of BMP6. BMP6 stimulates hepcidin expression by binding to
  the BMP receptor and HJV, leading to intracellular signaling via SMAD proteins,
  coupled with SMAD4 translocating to the nucleus and inducing hepcidin expression.
  The liver directly senses circulating iron by expression of TfR1 and TfR2. With
  increasing serum iron levels, Tf-Fe2 binds to TfR1 and HFE binding to TfR2 is induced.
  This complex interacts with HJV and enhances the BMP signaling pathway, leading
  to hepcidin transcription. The illustration was created using BioRender.com, (accessed
