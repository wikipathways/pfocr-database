caption: SASP is under a regulation of multifactorial singaling networks. The DDR
  effectors NBS1, ATM and CHK2 upregulate SASP. Importantly, p53 is a negative regulator
  of SASP and serves to restrain it upon DDR activation. mTOR positively regulates
  SASP via activation of the MAPK p38 pathway, and upregulation of IL-1α. Chromatin
  reorganization in senescent cells involves newly activated super enhancer (SE) elements.
  BRD4 is recruited to the SE and participate in the regulation of key SASP genes.
  NOTCH1 was indentified as a modulator of SASP composition in oncogene-induced senescent
  cells.
