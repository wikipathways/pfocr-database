caption: Findings from our laboratory using an animal model of the autoimmune disease,
  RA, reveal disease-related changes in β2-AR signaling that are dependent upon the
  lymphoid tissue examined. Here, we illustrate our proposed model to explain the
  different receptor signaling in spleen (A) and lymph nodes that drain the arthritic
  hind limbs (DLN) (B). (A) In the spleen, classical signaling via cAMP-PKA (shown
  on left side) is abolished and β2-AR agonists fail to inhibit the production of
  IFN-γ. High SNS tone caused by high levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines,
  results in PKA and GRK2 phosphorylation of β2-ARs in Th1 cells (shown on right side).
  Phosphorylation by PKA and GRK2 then induces receptor desensitization, thus β2-AR
  agonists fail to decrease IFN-γ production. For comparison, the canonical signaling
  pathway for β2-ARs is shown on the left. (B) In the DLN of arthritic rats, β2-AR
  agonists increase the production of IFN-γ. This finding supports a shift in receptor
  signaling away from the classical pathway (left side) towards the non-canonical
  pathway (right side). In the proposed model, high SNS nerve firing in the DLN coupled
  with high local levels of inflammatory cytokines induces β2-AR phosphorylation by
  PKA and is phosphorylated byGRK5/6. Phosphorylation by GRK5/6 leads to the recruitment
  of β-arrestin-2 to the receptor. Beta-arrestin-2 then switches receptor signaling
  to a β-arrestin-dependent activation of ERK1/2. ERK1/2 is well known to promote
  IFN-γ production.
