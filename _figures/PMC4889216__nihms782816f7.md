caption: (A) Under non-stressed conditions, MET-2 produces H3K9me1/2 histone subunits

  are normal lived and the nucleus is not compacted ().(B) During mitochondrial stress,
  MET-2 continues to produce H3K9me2 histone subunits, ATFS-1 now translocates to
  the nucleus to induce UPRmt. DVE-1 and LIN-65 accumulate in the nucleus ( and ).
  Animals are long-lived, the UPRmt is induced, nuclei become compacted (), and H3K9me2
  levels remain unchanged ().(C) Loss of met-2 during mitochondrial stress results
