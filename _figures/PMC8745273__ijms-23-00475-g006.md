caption: Interactive network of candidate genes for brachygnathia inferior. Each edge
  indicates interaction between two genes. The interaction types and their effects
  are described in the figure. This analysis was performed using the Search Tool for
  the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database. Yellow and red letters
  indicate genes involved in the Wnt and cadherin pathways, respectively.
