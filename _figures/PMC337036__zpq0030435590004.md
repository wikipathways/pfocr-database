caption: pBimEL escapes sequestration by microtubules and becomes accessible to caspase
  cleavage. (A) pBimEL is released from microtubules. Jurkat cell lysate preincubated
  with or without PAP (Left) or lysate from Jurkat cells treated with or without okadaic
  acid (Right) was incubated with taxol and then subjected to ultracentrifugation.
  α-Tubulin and Bim in the pellet (P), supernatant (S), or lysate before centrifugation
  (T) were detected by Western blotting. (B) The association with microtubules prevents
  BimEL from cleavage by caspase-3 in vitro. Jurkat cell lysate was incubated with
  taxol to assemble microtubules. Recombinant caspase-3 was then added to the reaction.
  After ultracentrifugation, α-tubulin and Bim were analyzed as in A. (C) pBimEL is
  released from microtubules and cleaved by caspases in apoptotic Jurkat cells. Lysate
  from Jurkat cells treated with or without staurosporine (Stau) was subjected to
  the same analysis as in A.(D) Diagram depicting the activation of a positive feedback
  apoptotic pathway involving the release of pBimEL from microtubules and caspase
  cleavage of pBimEL. The cleaved tBimEL(ΔN13) binds more Bcl-2 and has greater apoptotic
  activity. tBimEL may or may not contain the phosphorylation sites, which have not
  been mapped in the full-length BimEL. See the text for details.
