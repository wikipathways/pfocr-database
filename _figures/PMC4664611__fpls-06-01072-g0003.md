caption: Effect of PmitoKATP activity on the electrical membrane potential (ΔΨ) and
  ATP synthesis. (A) In the absence of KCl, PmitoKATP is inactive and the proton re-entry
  into the matrix via the ATP synthase (ATPase) drives the ATP synthesis according
  to the classical chemiosmotic scheme. (B) In the presence of KCl, PmitoKATP is active
  and the concurrent K+cycle (see Figure ) competes with ATPase for protons. Since
  PmitoKATP represents the rate-limiting step of the cycle, its inhibition by ATP
  may carefully regulate the rate of the cycle, so that the bulk phase measurable
  ΔΨ is strongly lowered, but a latent ΔΨ remains feeding the ATPase pathway to regularly
  accomplish ATP synthesis. (C) On the contrary, in the presence of the K+ ionophore
  valinomycin (val), PmitoKATP and its modulation by ATP are bypassed, so the K+cycle
  monopolizes protons and uncouples mitochondria collapsing both ΔΨ and ATP synthesis.
  The reducing equivalent flux through the respiratory chain to molecular oxygen,
  the coupled proton ejection into the intermembrane space, the ADP/ATP antiport via
  Adenine Nucleotide Translocator (ANT) and the ATP synthesis via ATPase are indicated;
  + and – signs refer to ΔΨ. The continuous or dotted arrows refer to a more or less
  active pathway, respectively. SH2, reduced substrates; S, oxidized substrates; i.m.m.,
  inner mitochondrial membrane.
