caption: A simplified model for Hh signaling in mammalian cells. SMO is the key signal
  transducer of the Hh pathway. A, in the absence of the Hh ligands, the Hh receptor
  PTC is thought to be localized in the cilium to inhibit SMO signaling (via an unknown
  mechanism). Gli molecules are processed with the help of Su(Fu)/KIF7 molecules into
  repressor forms, which disable the Hh signaling pathway. B, in the presence of Hh,
  PTC is thought to be shuttled out of cilium and is unable to inhibit SMO. Co-receptors
  of Hh ligands include CDO, BOC, and GAS1. Hh reception promotes SMO conformational
  change, facilitating Gli activation (GMA), stimulating Hh target gene expression.
  This process can be inhibited by KIF7 and Su (Fu). (Positive regulators are in red,
  negative regulators are in blue and target genes are in orange.).
