caption: Reversine, an MPS1 inhibitor, inhibited cell proliferation of CCA cells by
  multiple mechanisms including G2/M arrest with changes of cyclin B1 and p21. This
  inhibitor caused autophagy activation and autophagic flux via alterations of autophagy
  related proteins. Additionally, reversine-mediated autophagy partially inactivated
  the AKT signalling pathway. Reversine also reduced the glucose uptake and ATP production
  via suppression of HIF-1α and GLUT1 expression. It consequently triggered apoptosis
  by decreasing of Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 expressions which subsequently inhibited Bax and
  activated the cleavage of caspase 3.
