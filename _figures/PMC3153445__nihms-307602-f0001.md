caption: Pathways are color coded. In blue the canonical pathway in which cAMP activates
  PKA, phosphorylating the L-type Ca++ channel (LTCC) and RyR2, is shown to activate
  Ca++/CaM and CaMKII. The pathway shown in orange utilizes the exchange protein directly
  activated by cAMP (Epac) rather than PKA, activating CaMKII through the small GTP’ase
  Rap, phospholipase C epsilon (PLCε), and protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε). The purple
  pathway utilizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling to effect CaMKII activation
  at known sites; the green pathway utilizes NO synthase (NOS) signaling to effect
  CaMKII activation through more hypothetical mechanisms.
