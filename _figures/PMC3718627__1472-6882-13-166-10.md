caption: Schematic model of cell death mechanism in CACF-induced responses in melanoma
  A375 cells. CACF induces intracellular ROS production due to elevated oxidative
  stress. This initiates various intracellular changes including increased membrane
  permeability and reduced MMP which subsequently causes cytochrome c release from
  the mitochondria. Cytoplasmic cytochrome c activates caspase pathway molecules,
  including caspase-9 and caspase-3/7. Activation of caspase molecules subsequently
  leads to nuclear fragmentation. CACF treatment also triggers p53 expression that
  may initiate apoptosis activity through reduction of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 level.
  On the other hand, CACF prevented NF-κB nuclear translocation, which could induce
  Bcl-2 transactivation and maintain cell survival in A375 melanoma cells.
