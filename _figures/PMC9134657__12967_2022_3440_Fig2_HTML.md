caption: Pathway analysis of non-mutated genes. IPA generated pathway showing the
  interaction of genes within one network. The non-mutated gene with the highest difference
  from random expectation, TRAPPC9, is linked to a central NF-κB pathway along with
  other non-mutated genes. The shading as shown in the legend is proportional to the
  ratio of observed/simulated where genes that are redder have a lower ratio. Links
  between genes are either direct (solid lines) or indirect (dashed lines)
