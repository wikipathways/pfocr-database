caption: Lysosome pathway in DEX-treated sarcoid AMs. Graphic illustration of pathway
  analysis of DE (log2 FC > 0.6 with FDR < 0.05) genes related to lysosome pathway
  in sarcoid-DEX treated AMs. The pathway diagram is overlaid with the computed perturbation
  of each gene. The perturbation accounts both for the gene's measured fold changes
  and for accumulated perturbation propagated from any upstream genes (accumulation).
  The color intensity corresponds to the level of upregulation (red) or downregulation
  (blue) of the DE genes in sarcoid-DEX treated AMs vs. sarcoid untreated AMs.
