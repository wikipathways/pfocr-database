caption: a. In mouse skin and mucosal epithelia, loss of TGF-β receptor signaling
  leads to hyperplasia, whereas gain of oncogenic HRAS mutations leads to TGF-β-associated
  apoptosis. Loss of TGF-β signaling in a HRAS-mutant background leads to the emergence
  of tumors. Thus, TGF-β enforces homeostasis in the wild type background, and tumor
  suppression in a RAS-mutant background.b. The switch of TGF-β from a signal for
  lineage maintenance and homeostasis to a signal for apoptosis that cancer cells
  must disable, as observed in pancreatic epithelial progenitors. In normal progenitors
  TGF-β signaling through SMAD2/3 with SMAD4 activates the expression of CDK inhibitors,
  SOX4, and other genes. CDK inhibitors tone down cell proliferation, whereas SOX4
  associates with KLF5 to co-occupy the genome and enforce epithelial progenitor identity.
  Stimulation of SOX4 expression requires SMAD2/3 but not SMAD4. In premalignant pancreatic
  progenitors harboring oncogenic KRAS mutations, a hyperactive ERK MAPK pathway enables
  SMAD2/3:SMAD4 to strongly induce the expression of the EMT master regulator SNAIL.
  SNAIL represses KLF5 expression. In the absence of KLF5, SOX4 induces pro-apoptotic
  genes BIM and BMF for elimination of the cell. Nearly one half of human pancreatic
  ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA) progress through this bottleneck by selecting for clones
  that harbor SMAD4 inactivating mutations. Loss of SMAD4 does still allows TGF-β
  to support SOX4 expression and the SOX4:KLF5 mediated pancreatic progenitor state.
  The other half of PDA tumors progress with a functionally intact TGF-β signaling
  system but accumulate unknown alterations that prevent the pathway from triggering
  apoptosis.
