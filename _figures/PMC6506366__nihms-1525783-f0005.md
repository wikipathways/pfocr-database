caption: 'At low altitude, MA are vasodilated by acetylcholine (ACh) and bradykinin
  (BK) acting largely through endothelial cell (EC)-dependent mechanisms. ACh and
  BK activate endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) by phosphorylation of
  Ser-1177 to produce NO, which diffuses to the smooth muscle cells (SMC) where it
  activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) to increase cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels,
  and in turn, promote protein kinase G (PKG) activity, relaxation of the SMC and
  vasodilation of the MA. BK also acts through an unknown, largely endothelium-independent
  mechanism to induce relaxation of SMC. At high altitude, even though basal Ser-1177
  phosphorylation of eNOS remains unchanged, decreased vasodilator response to the
  NO donor SNP suggests that the activation of the downstream NO pathway (i.e., sGC-cGMP-PKG)
  is reduced and thereby impairs ACh vasodilation of MA. Conversely, BK vasodilates
  MA at high altitude partially by activating cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent production
  of prostaglandins (PGs), but also by two other putative mechanisms: an endothelium-dependent
  (likely endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor, EDHF) and an unknown, largely
  endothelium-independent mechanism. Other abbreviations: mAChR, muscarinic ACh receptor;
  B1/2, bradykinin receptor B1 or B2; L-arg, L-arginine, GTP, guanosine triphosphate;
  AA, arachidonic acid.'
