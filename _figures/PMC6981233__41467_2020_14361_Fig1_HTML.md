caption: Synthesis pathway with yields and diastereomeric excess (de) of intermediates
  for the production of the lactam isomers 5-3S and 5-3R (yields refer to the small-scale
  experiments from purified starting material). The labelling of the stereo-centre
  C3 at all intermediates follows the recommendation for terpene carbon skeleton numbering
  of M. W. Grafflin, which suggest that the initial carbon labels of (+)-3-carene
  are fixed also in case of functionalization.
