caption: The biotin biosynthetic pathway as elucidated in eubacteria. There are several
  different pathways for the synthesis of pimeloyl-CoA. The gene names are followed
  by the symbol • indicating the presence of the gene in C. merolae (Cm), the symbol
  ○ indicating the presence of a gene in C. reinhardtii (Cr), the symbol ▪ indicating
  that the given gene is present in the genome of T. pseudonana (Tp), or the symbol
  □ indicating that the gene is in the genome of P. falciparum (Pf). Genes with sequence
  similarity to bioF and bioA can also be found in the genome sequence of D. discoideum,
  while only bioF can be found in E. histolytica (see text for details).
