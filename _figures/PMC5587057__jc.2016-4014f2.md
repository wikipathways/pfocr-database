caption: Connectivity analysis of gene products differentially expressed by tissue
  type and menstrual phase. Genes products identified as differentially expressed
  by two-way ANOVA considering both tissue type (myometrium vs leiomyoma) and menstrual
  phase (proliferative vs luteal) were evaluated for functional connectivity in GeneMania.
  Light blue bar, connectivity via recognized signaling pathway; dark blue bar, evidence
  of physical colocalization; orange bar, known physical interactions. Font size for
  each gene product identified is proportional to connectivity. Presence of a gray
  circle in the background indicates overexpression or underexpression when specimens
  of leiomyomas were compared with healthy myometrium. The five most connected hubs
  are indicated by gene symbols in red type. Members of the sFRP family of Wnt inhibitors
  are indicated by gene symbols in orange type. Gene products inferred to be important
  for function of observed networks are denoted by their gene symbol alone. No evidence
  of differential expression was observed for this latter category of genes.
