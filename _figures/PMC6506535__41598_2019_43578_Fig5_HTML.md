caption: Natural killer cell signaling pathway of MAIT cells in comparison with conventional
  T cells. IPA analysis of DEGs of MAIT cells in comparison with conventional T cells
  showed a functionally activated signal pathway of MAIT cells in association with
  the role of natural killer cell signaling. In MAIT cells, almost all NK cell-specific
  genes were downregulated. For example, CD94, NKG2D, and NKG2D are all downregulated
  significantly, indicating that MAIT cells are very different from NK cells.
