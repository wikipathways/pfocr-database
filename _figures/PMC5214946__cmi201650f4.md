caption: Comparison of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathways in humans and zebrafish.
  RIG-I and MDA5 are responsible for the detection of different types of viral RNAs.
  On binding of the RNA ligand, homotypic CARD–CARD interactions between RLRs and
  MAVS recruit TRAFs/TRADD/TANK and kinase complexes (TBK1 and IKKɛ) to facilitate
  IRF3 phosphorylation and IκB kinase activation, resulting in the production of type-I
  IFN. In zebrafish, the production of IFNs in turn induces a second wave of IFN through
  the STAT pathway and IRF7 phosphorylation. IRF10 and a MAVS variant (MAVS_tv2) negatively
  regulate IFN production by targeting IRF7. IRF, interferon response factor.
