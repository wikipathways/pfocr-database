caption: Model of mHtt aggregation, generation of ER stress and the consequent UPR
  protective and later pro-apoptotic responses. A misfolded mHtt monomer, with the
  aggregation prone polyQ domain indicated (beta sheets in green) is cleaved and associates
  with other monomers to form toxic oligomers, which among other effects cause sequestration
  and depletion of ERAD factors such as p97, inhibiting ERAD. mHtt oligomers can associate
  into larger aggregate fibrils with dry steric zipper structure that shield the toxicity
  of mHtt. However, the transient presence of toxic mHtt oligomers, inhibiting ERAD,
  causes accumulation of unfolded secretory proteins and ER stress, activating the
  UPR sensors IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, starting an initial protective or adaptive phase
  of the UPR. This includes upregulation and translocation to the nucleus of transcription
  factors, XBP1s, ATF4, NRF2, ATF6, which induce expression of chaperones, ERAD machinery,
  anti-oxidative response components. Concurrently, eIF2α phosphorylation by PERK
  causes transient arrest in translation, reducing the ER load. If the ER stress remains
  unresolved, the pro-apoptotic stage of the UPR is initiated, causing upregulation
  of ASK1-P and CHOP and Ca2+ exit from the ER, inducing the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
  with the mitochondrial release of cytochrome C. Sigma-1 receptor is upregulated
  and modulates Ca2+ release, with a protective effect. Cytotoxic pathways are indicated
  in red and cell protective ones in green. The numbers indicate possible points of
  therapeutic intervention, with activation (1) or inhibition (2) of PERK, inhibition
  of the downstream effects of eIF2α-P (3), inhibition of eIF2α-P dephosphorylation
  (4), and Sigma-1 receptor activation (5).
