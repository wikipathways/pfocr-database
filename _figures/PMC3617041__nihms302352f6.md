caption: Model of TGF-β restoration by SMAD6 knockdown. A, down-regulation of TGF-β
  signal pathway by SMAD6 in lung cancer. B, TGF-β signal pathway reactivation on
  SMAD6 knockdown. JNK and SMAD2/3 were phosphorylated by TGF-β signal pathway, and
  apoptosis pathway was also activated by caspase-3 and PARP activation leading to
  the reduction of tumor burden observed in lung cancer patients.
