caption: Pathway analysis depicting cytokine and cytokine receptor interactions relative
  to position in the cellular environment. Interactions between genes that are expressed
  in the human lung and that have been shown to play a role in cancer are presented.
  Solid lines, direct physical interactions; dotted lines, indirect interactions.
  Green, pink, orange, and gray figures, cytokines; associations between those cytokine
  and cytokine receptor polymorphisms and lung cancer risk were found among both racial
  groups, Caucasians only, African-Americans only, or neither group in our study,
  respectively.
