caption: AMPK signaling pathway. When stressors, such as hypoxia and glucose deprivation,
  or agonists, such as AICAR, increase AMP levels, AMP binds AMPK cooperatively. AMPK
  is then activated through phosphorylation by LKB1. Active phosphorylated AMPK inhibits
  biosynthesis and stimulates fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis to maintain energy
  supply during ischemia.
