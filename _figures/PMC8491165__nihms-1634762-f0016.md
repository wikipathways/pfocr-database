caption: Ceramide can be formed either by a catabolic pathway, from the hydrolysis
  of membrane sphingomyelin, or by de novo biosynthesis, starting from the condensation
  of serine with palmitate in the endoplasmic reticulum. Ceramide and its bioactive
  metabolite S1P mediate several inflammatory, proapoptotic and nociceptive signalling
  cascades. S1P can cross the plasma membrane through either non-specific ABC transporters
  or through the recently discovered Spinster 2 (SPNS2) transporter, which is specific
  for S1P. S1P signalling is mediated by five G-protein coupled receptors (S1PR1-5).
