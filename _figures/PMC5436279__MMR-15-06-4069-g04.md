caption: Several roles of scrapie responsive gene 1 (SCRG1) suggested in this study
  and our previous reports. SCRG1 is hypothesized to be secreted into the extracellular
  space by mesenchymal sem cells (MSCs) and to have autocrine/paracrine activity.
  The putative receptor for SCRG1 is a complex of bone marrow stromal cell antigen
  1 (BST1) and β1 or β2 integrins on the cell surface. The SCRG1/BST1 axis positively
  regulates the self-renewal, migration, and osteogenic differentiation potentials
  of MSCs through the FAK/PI3 K/Akt signaling pathway. In macrophage, lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) interacts with a heterologous receptor involving toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4),
  CD14, and MD2. SCRG1 suppresses LPS-induced CC-chemokine ligand 22 (CCL22) production
  of macrophage in a extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-dependent
  manner.
