caption: Metabolic engineering strategies for enhancing citric acid production. The
  central metabolism pathway of A. niger was streamlined for citric acid production
  through engineering of targets for carbon utilization improvement, biosynthesis
  and precursor enhancement, by-product removal and feedback inhibition reduction
  and respiratory chain improvement. The Red Crosse represented corresponding gene
  (green) is deleted. The genes in red represented the targets required to be enhanced.
  The red dashed line with vertical bar represented the feed-back inhibition, i.e.
  T6P inhibited the activity of Hxk. STA starch, SUCR sucrose, GLC glucose, GLA gluconic
