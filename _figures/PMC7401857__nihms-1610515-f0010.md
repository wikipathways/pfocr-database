caption: Schematic of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules release upon HMGB1 stimulation
  and its receptor blocking. Following cell stress with LPS, stores of the nuclear
  protein HMGB1 gets translocated from nucleus to cytosol and gets released into the
  extracellular milieu in human NP cells. This secreted HMGB1 further promotes expression
  of inflammatory cytokine, IL-6 and catabolic molecule, MMP-1 that are known to further
  promote and drive DD. Blockade of HMGB1 signaling receptors using various small
  molecule inhibitors showed a differential inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokines
  in human NP cells. Various sites of targeted pharmacological intervention are indicated
  by color-coded inhibitory lines and their effects on transcription and release of
  pro-inflammatory cytokine and catabolic molecule are indicated by respective color-coded
  arrow lines.
