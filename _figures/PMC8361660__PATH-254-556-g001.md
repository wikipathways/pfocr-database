caption: 'Decision tree for application of CDK and PARP inhibitors. (A) The mutation
  status of CDK2/4/6, cyclin E1/D3, RB1, and CDKN2A is determined from sequencing
  data or by probe‐based assessment techniques (arrays, multiplex ligation‐dependent
  probe amplification, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis). The tumor''s
  response to CDK4/6 inhibition then depends on fulfilling two conditions: (1) CCND3
  and CDK4/6 amplifications are present and (2) there are no mutations in RB1 and
  CCNE1. This is because CCNE1 amplifications confer CDK4 inhibition resistance by
  having Rb phosphorylated via the CDK2 pathway and the loss of Rb disrupts CDK4 signal
  transmission. In the same vein, the success of CDK2 inhibition relies on having
  the status of cyclin E1 as amplified but Rb status as wild type. (B) The analysis
  of HRRD follows the Myriad Genetics guidelines: a summary score is calculated from
  BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation status and three independent test scores – LST, LOH‐HDR, and
  TAI. Tumors with cut‐off scores higher than 42 are deemed positive and should respond
  to PARP inhibition.'
