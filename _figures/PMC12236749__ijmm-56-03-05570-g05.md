caption: 'Cardiovascular-derived exosomes regulate the bone. Cardiovascular-derived
  exosomes exhibit a dual role in regulating skeletal diseases. Positive regulation:
  Cardiovascular-derived exosomal miR-155 and miR-3p-975_4191 can inhibit osteoclast
  activity and reduce bone resorption, inhibit TNF to regulate BMSC differentiation,
  suppress adipogenic differentiation and promote osteogenic differentiation to prevent
  the development of osteoporosis. Cardiovascular-derived exosomes can also inhibit
  osteoblast suppression by suppressing ferritin autophagy-dependent ferroptosis.
  Cardiovascular-derived exosomal miR-27a and other molecules can activate the MAPK/ERK
  pathway to promote BMSC osteoblast differentiation and inhibit adipogenic differentiation,
  or directly target DKK2 and activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to promote
  bone formation and improve femoral head necrosis. Moreover, miR-133a, miR-208a,
  miR-499-5p and other miRNAs in cardiovascular-derived exosomes can target bone marrow
  mononuclear cells, downregulating CXCR4 expression and mobilize progenitor cells
  to participate in bone remodeling. Negative regulation: Cardiovascular-derived exosomes
  reduce chondrocyte resistance to oxidative stress and induce apoptosis by inhibiting
  autophagy and p21 expression, thus promoting the progression of OA. Cardiovascular-derived
  exosomes can act on mesenchymal stem cells, accelerating BMSC damage in MI heart
  transplants. miR/miRNA, microRNA; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; BMSC, bone marrow
