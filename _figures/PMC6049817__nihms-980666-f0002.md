caption: In the efferent pathway, descending projections from the brain (for example,
  from brainstem and hypothalamic regions) synapse on sympathetic preganglionic neurons
  in the intermediolateral cell column (IML) of the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord.
  Sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the lumbar spinal cord project through the
  ventral horn to the aorticorenal ganglion and activate the renal sympathetic nerve,
  which innervates the kidney and releases noradrenaline, neuropeptide Y and ATP.
  Sensory afferents in the kidney, which release substance P and calcitonin gene-related
  peptide, have their cells bodies in the dorsal root ganglia and synapse centrally
  on interneurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord that transmit information
  to various regions of the brain. Although the kidney does not seem to have vagal
  efferent input, some evidence suggests that vagal afferent neurons arising in the
  nodose ganglion innervate the kidney, thus providing a pathway for integration with
  the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and subsequent second order neuronal targets
  in the brain.
