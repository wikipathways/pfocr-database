caption: 'Model for the control of cell migration by integrin-specific regulation
  of Rho GTPases. Adhesion by β1 integrins promotes strong Rho/Rho kinase signaling.
  This counteracts three important parameters of persistent cell migration: (1) Rac-mediated
  lamellipodia formation; (2) development of static cell–matrix adhesions; and (3)
  cofilin-mediated actin cytoskeletal reorganization. As a result, β1 integrins promote
  a random mode of migration. Inhibition of Rho/Rho kinase signaling relieves the
  suppression of all three aspects and causes a switch from β1- to β3-associated behavior.
  Conversely, increased Rho signaling in cells adhering by αvβ3 triggers a conversion
  to β1-associated behavior. Increased Rac signaling can also stimulate a partial
  conversion from β1- to β3-associated behavior with increased lamellipodia formation
  and stabilization of cell–matrix adhesions. However, this does not lead to increased
  cofilin activity and hence, does not stimulate persistence.'
