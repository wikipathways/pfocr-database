caption: 'Linking pathways to disease: Crohn''s disease (from Wang et al. []). As
  an example of how biological pathways are involved in disease pathogenesis, the
  authors illustrate a manually compiled pathway centered on IL-12 and IL-23. For
  each gene, the most significant P value among SNPs close to the gene (based on GWAS)
  was annotated. Only three genes at two loci (IL12B at 5q33 and IL23R-IL12RB2 at
  1p31) showed genome-wide significant signals, but three further genes (JAK2, CCR6,
  and STAT3) in the pathway were confirmed as susceptibility candidates in replication
  studies. Six further genes in this pathway were reported as Crohn''s disease susceptibility
  genes by other association and functional studies.'
