caption: 6-Bromoisatin in D. orbita hypobranchial gland (HGB) extracts prevent acute
  lung damage caused by inflammatory neutrophils by reducing the synthesis of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. This may occur due to blocking the LPS-induced NFκB translocation into
  the nucleus and activation of macrophages and direct inhibition of inflammatory
  mediators, such as TNFα and nitric oxide (NO), as has been previously demonstrated
  in vitro for 6-bromoisatin []. Alternatively, it is possible that the HGB extracts
  and associated compounds also have an upstream effect by modulating the interaction
  of LPS with plasma membrane receptors. This figure was developed from known inflammatory
  pathways in lung macrophages [].
