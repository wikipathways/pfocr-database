caption: Inhibition of liver cancer cell invasion and metastasis by Astragalus polysaccharides
  (APS). This figure illustrates the inhibitory effects of APS on the invasion and
  metastasis of liver cancer cells, specifically HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cell lines. APS
  modulate the JAK/STAT signalling pathway, leading to upregulation of the epithelial
  marker E-cadherin and downregulation of the mesenchymal markers vimentin and CXCR4.
  These changes inhibit the EMT, suppress cell migration and invasion, and reduce
  the metastatic potential. The data support the potential of APS as natural agents
  targeting metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma
