caption: 'Schematic presentation of the pathways involved in the inflammatory response
  during acute pancreatitis. Following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, the inhibitors
  of κB (IκB) kinase are activated via the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-myeloid differentiation
  factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent (blue) or -independent pathway (purple). Thereafter,
  IκBα is rapidly phosphorylated by IκB kinase and then degraded. This process allows
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) to translocate into the nucleus and to increase the transcription
  of several important inflammatory genes, such as the genes encoding tumor necrosis
  factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), adhesion molecules and chemokines. The up-regulation
  of these inflammatory mediators, in turn, either leads to further IκB kinase activation
  or mediates the migration of the inflammatory cells to the site of inflammation,
  thus amplifying the inflammatory response. Meanwhile, platelet-activating factor
  (released from active macrophages, endothelial cells or platelets) and endothelins
  (released from endothelial cells) are involved in the increased vascular permeability
  and extravasation of inflammatory cells. TNF R: Tumor necrosis factor receptor;
  IL-1 R: Interleukin-1 receptor; ICAM-1: Intercellularadhesionmolecule-1; PAF: Platelet-activating
  factor; ET: Endothelin.'
