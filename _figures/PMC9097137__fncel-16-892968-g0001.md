caption: Glucose metabolism in OPCs/OLs. Glucose is imported into the cell by GLUT
  transporters (GLUT1 is the most abundant GLUT transporter in OLs). Glucose is transformed
  into G-6-P by the rate-limiting enzyme hexokinase. G-6-P can enter the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) or continue down the glycolytic pathway. In OPCs and OLs, there is
  significant PPP activity when compared to other cell types in the brain. The PPP
  pathway produces NADPH which is essential for cholesterol synthesis (for lipids)
  and for enhancing antioxidant activity. Furthermore, PPP generates ribose-5-phosphate
  (R-5-P) which is the backbone used in nucleotide synthesis and is critical in maintaining
  the proliferative function of cells like OPCs. R-5-P can be converted to F-6-P and
  enter back into the glycolytic pathway to generate a net of 2 ATP and 2 NADH molecules
  as well as pyruvate. Pyruvate is then converted to AcCoA by the PDH complex and
  enters the TCA cycle. The metabolites formed from the TCA cycle become electron
  donors of the electron transport chain, driving the hydrogen potential difference
  across the inner mitochondrial membrane to power ATP synthase and produce ATP. Created
