caption: Roles of FSTL3 in non-tumor pathophysiologies and cancers. (A). FSTL3 can
  bind to ADAM12 and promote bone formation. (B). Myostatin promotes trophoblastic
  invasion by activating the ALK5-SMAD2/3 signaling pathway and activated SMAD2/3
  pathway can increase the expression of FSTL3. (C). FSTL3 inhibits AKT phosphorylation,
  decreases β-catenin expression, and inhibits cell growth. Additionally, FSTL3 inhibits
  AKT-mediated activation of zyxin and SIRT1, thereby reducing antiaging effects.
  (D). FSTL3 inhibits activin A expression, which decreases the expression of Bcl-2.
  (E). FSTL3 may be induced by oxLDL, upregulates CD36 and LOX-1 and promote MMP9,
  MCP-1, and IL-1b expression, cause lipid accumulation and inflammatory development,
  and promotes the development of atherosclerosis. (F). In cancer cells, FSTL3 can
  serve as a bridging molecule in the crosstalk between YAP1 and β-catenin signaling
  pathways. The activation of YAP1 can induce FSTL3 expression, and high expression
  of FSTL3 then activates β-catenin signaling pathways and promotes invasion, migration
  and metastasis of cancer cells. (G). DSCAM-AS1 and LBX2-AS1 positively regulate
  the expression of FSTL3 and promote proliferation and migration, and miR-486-5P
  negatively regulates the expression of FSTL3. Grey components indicate unknown receptors.
  Colored helical structures represent nuclei. Question marks represent unknown pathways
  or receptors.
