caption: Metabolic pathway map showing the metabolites and their differences in the
  deltamethrin-resistant (DR) and deltamethrin-susceptible (DS) strains. Each dot
  stands for a specific metabolite. Red dots represent higher abundance in DR strain,
  blue dots represent lower abundance in DR strains, and black dots indicate no significant
  difference were found between DR and DS strain. All differences in abundance were
  statistically significant (P < 0.05) by Student’s t-test. Compounds colored in gray
  circles represent the metabolites not detected in this study but known to function
  in the relative pathway. The colored ellipses in the map show metabolic pathways,
  and the colored circles show the metabolites detected in this study. All of these
  were set according to the reference of the metabolic map of Aedes Aegypti (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map01100).

  description: Metabolic pathway map showing the metabolites and their differences
    in the deltamethrin-resistant (DR) and deltamethrin-susceptible (DS) strains.
    Each dot stands for a specific metabolite. Red dots represent higher abundance
    in DR strain, blue dots represent lower abundance in DR strains, and black dots
    indicate no significant difference were found between DR and DS strain. All differences
    in abundance were statistically significant (P < 0.05) by Student’s t-test. Compounds
    colored in gray circles represent the metabolites not detected in this study but
    known to function in the relative pathway. The colored ellipses in the map show
    metabolic pathways, and the colored circles show the metabolites detected in this
    study. All of these were set according to the reference of the metabolic map of
    Aedes Aegypti (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map01100).
