caption: UBL-PTMs of the NF-kB pathway altered in CLL. Schematic representation of
  the main components of the NF-kB pathway showing the ubiquitin-like post-translational
  modifications found in B cells from patients of CLL. It was long known that activation
  of the pathway involves the polyubiquitination of the inhibitor IkBa and its degradation
  at the proteasome. This process is regulated by NEDDylation of the Cullin component
  of the E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting IkB for its polyubiquitination. Recent observations
  in B-CLL cells have revealed alterations in the post-translational pattern of proteins
  working upstream in the pathway, like TRAF2, TANK, NEMO or IKKß (represented as
  green diamonds in the figure).
