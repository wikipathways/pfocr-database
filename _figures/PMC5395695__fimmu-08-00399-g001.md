caption: Proposed mechanisms of pathogenesis in haploinsufficiency of A20 (HA20),
  otulipenia/otulin-related autoinflammatory syndrome (ORAS), and linear ubiquitin
  chain assembly complex (LUBAC) deficiencies. The canonical NF-κB pathway is regulated
  both by K63 (Lys63)-linked and linear (Met1)-linked ubiquitin (Ub) chains. RIPK1
  is the central adaptor for assembly of the TNFR1 receptor signaling complex and
  is a predominant target for ubiquitination by K63 and linear Ub chains. Polyubiquitylated
  RIPK1 mediates recruitment of IKK complex that is also target for ubiquitination.
  The activated IKK complex phosphorylates inhibitor of kappa B (IκBα) and targets
  IκBα for proteasome-mediated degradation. Linear Ub chains are added to RIPK1 and
  IKKγ by LUBAC. A20 and OTULIN negatively regulate the NF-κB pathway by cleaving
  K63 and linear Ub chains from target molecules, RIPK1 and IKKγ. In addition, A20
  through its E3 ligase activity adds K48 Ub chains to IKKγ (and TRAF6, not shown
  in the figure) targeting them for proteasomal degradation. Decreased expression
  of A20 in patients with HA20 or OTULIN in patients with otulipenia/ORAS will lead
  to activation of the NF-κB pathway, increased expression of proinflammatory transcripts
  in immune cells, and systemic inflammation. Decreased expression of LUBAC complex
  subunits, in patients who carry mutations in HOIP or HOIL-1, results in inhibition
  of the NF-κB pathway in fibroblasts and B-cells causing immunodeficiency. However,
  their monocytes hyperproduce proinflammatory cytokines. TNFR1, TNF receptor 1; TRADD,
  TNFR1-associated death domain protein; RIPK1, the death domain-containing protein
  kinase receptor-interacting protein1; IKKγ/NEMO, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa
  B kinase subunit gamma.
