caption: Fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli and metabolic engineering
  strategy for overproduction of free fatty acids. Acetyl-CoA is converted to malonyl-CoA
  by the four subunits of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AccABCD). Malonyl-CoA is converted
  to malonyl-ACP (acyl–acyl carrier protein) by malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (FabD),
  and to the acetoacetyl-ACP, the first β-ketoacyl-ACP in the fatty acid elongation
  cycle, by multiple pathways catalyzed by FabD, β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (FabH),
  and β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (FabB). The ketoacyl-ACP is reduced twice and dehydrated
  once to yield an acyl-ACP in the elongation cycle by β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG),
  enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI), and β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (FabZ). The acyl-ACP
  is then condensed with malonyl-ACP by FabB or β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II (FabF).
  Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (PlsB) and 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase
  (PlsC) utilize C16 to C18 acyl-ACPs as substrates for phospholipid biosynthesis.
  Acyl-ACP thioesterases hydrolyze acyl-ACPs to yield free fatty acids. Free fatty
  acids can be degraded, ultimately to acetyl-CoA, by enzymes of β-oxidation. This
  process is initiated by acyl-CoA synthetase (FadD), which converts free fatty acids
  to acyl-CoAs. Bolded arrows represent reactions enhanced by overexpression (ACC)
  or heterologous expression (BTE) of indicated enzymes. X represents a disruption
  of the indicated pathway by gene deletion.
