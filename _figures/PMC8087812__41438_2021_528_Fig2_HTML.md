caption: α-Linolenic acids serve as precursors for a variety of fatty acid-derived
  volatile organic compounds, also known as green leaf volatiles (GLVs). This precursor
  enters the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway by oxidation, yielding 9-hydroperoxy and 13-hydroperoxy
  intermediates that are further converted to volatiles by hydroperoxide lyases and
  alcohol dehydrogenases. Differentially expressed enzymes and metabolites (volatiles
  shown in red letters; nonvolatiles shown in blue letters) were integrated into the
  pathway-based maps. Jasmonic acid metabolites are also displayed. Abbreviations
  are shown on the upper right of this figure. Red represents an increase, and green
  represents a decrease. Dashed arrows indicate unverified steps and include several
  steps in the pathway. Detailed fold changes are shown in Supplementary Tables ,
