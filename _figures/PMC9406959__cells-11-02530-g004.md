caption: Scheme of a canonical Notch signaling pathway and therapeutic targets. During
  transport through endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, Notch precursor is
  glycosylated, cleaved into a heterodimer (S1 cleavage) and transported to the cell
  membrane. Binding with Notch ligand induces second cleavage (S2 cleavage) by a member
  of ADAM family of proteases, leaving membrane-bound Notch extracellular truncation
  (NEXT) fragment. NEXT is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase complex (S3 cleavage)
  releasing the active form of the Notch receptor, Notch intracellular domain (NICD),
  which can translocate to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of Notch
  target genes by forming transcriptional complex with DNA-binding protein CSL (also
  known as CBF1/in mammals, Suppressor of Hairless in Drosophila, and LAG-1 in C.
  elegans) and MAML, which further recruits other transcriptional coactivators (Co-A).
  Classes of inhibitors and antibodies (Abs, ADC) that target Notch pathway components
  are indicated. References are included in the main text.
