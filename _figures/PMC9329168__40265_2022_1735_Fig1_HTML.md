caption: Glyoxylate metabolic pathway in the liver (modified from Martin-Higueras
  et al. []). The enzymatic deficits responsible for the three known types of primary
  hyperoxaluria are shown (I, II, and III). Oxalate is then secreted out of the liver,
  to be excreted by the kidneys. High levels of oxalate in the kidneys and urine lead
  to formation of calcium oxalate (CaOx) in the renal tissue and tubular system, causing
  urolithiasis (upper image) and/or nephrocalcinosis (lower image), which can be detected
  by ultrasound imaging procedures. 1P5CDH Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase,
  AGT alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase, AspAT aspartate aminotransferase, DAO D-aminoacid
  oxidase, GO glycolate oxidase, GRHPR glyoxylate reductase/hydropyruvate reductase,
  HOGA 4-hydroxy-2- oxoglutarate aldolase 1, HYPDH hydroxyproline dehydrogenase, LDH
