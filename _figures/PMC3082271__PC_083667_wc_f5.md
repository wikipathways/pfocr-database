caption: NVN for Putative CHS-Mediated (CHS4) Medicarpin Biosynthesis.Nodes in the
  network resemble individual genes, and the connecting edges represent coexpressed
  links. The coloration of nodes and edges is explained in . The different steps in
  the medicarpin biosynthetic pathway are indicated in different colors according
  to the pathway structure on the left. The P450-related genes indicated in gold could
  encode the missing DMID step in the pathway. The interactive networks can be found
  at http://aranet.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/medinet/m15662. The expression profile for CHS4
  is indicated above the network. See  for acronym annotations.
