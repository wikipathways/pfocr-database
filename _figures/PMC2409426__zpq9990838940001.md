caption: Interrelationship of energy metabolism and insulin action in skeletal muscle.
  Fatty acids and glucose are both substrates for energy metabolism in skeletal muscle.
  Cytosolic accumulation of lipid species such as diacylglycerol and ceramide are
  thought to decrease insulin action by inhibiting the insulin signaling pathway (blue
  shaded box). Metabolism of fatty acids by muscle cells is subject to regulation
  at the level of uptake and activation of fatty acids, the entry of activated fatty
  acids into the mitochondrion (CPT-1) and the capacity of the β-oxidation pathway,
  the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, electron transport chain (complex I–IV), and
  ATP synthesis (complex V) (red boxes). The balance between uptake and utilization
  of fatty acids will ultimately determine the magnitude of lipid accumulation in
  muscle cells.
