caption: The Bidirectional Relationship between targeted therapies (VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors)
  and TIME in ccRCC. (A) Resistance to VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors is due to a complex network
  of pro-angiogenic factors (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, MMP-9, VEGF, and FGF2), which promote
  excessive tumor angiogenesis. IL-1 promotes the production of IL-6, IL-8, and MMP-9,
  and enhances the expression of VEGF and VEGFR via the Notch pathway. IL-6 upregulates
  MMP-9 and VEGF levels via the JAK-STAT3 pathway. IL-8 promotes the secretion of
  VEGF and the self-activation of the VEGFR. MMP-9 enhances the angiogenic effect
  of VEDF. Tumor produced GM-CSF can also promote MMP-9 and IL-8 production. Finally,
  HIF-α promotes VEGF secretion. (B) The role of VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors in stimulating
  the immune response was achieved by blocking the immunosuppressive effect of VEGF.
  VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors can prevent VEGF-mediated recruitment of TAMs and Tregs, restore
  DC maturation and antigen presentation, and promote Teff cell migration to tumor
  microenvironment. (C) Immunosuppression mediated by VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors may have
  resulted from hypoxia. High doses of VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors can excessively prune
  tumor vessels, leading to hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment, which facilitates
  recruitment of Tregs, TAMs and MDSCs.
