caption: Possible mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of DN and protective effect
  of OPC. (A) The combination of Cd and HFSD can induce the increase of oxidative
  stress, which activate the expression of p38 MAPK pathway, moreover, block the effect
  of Nrf2/Keap1 pathway. (B) The treatment of OPC can downregulate the expression
  of p38 MAPK pathway and activate Nrf2/Keap1pathway to exert its protective effect
  against the progressive of DN.
