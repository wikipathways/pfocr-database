caption: AKT suppresses the HR pathway and activates the NHEJ pathway via many mechanisms.
  AKT can phosphorylate Brca1 and induce its cytoplasmic translocation. Brca1 inhibits
  the interaction of 53BP1 and methylated histone, which is important for NHEJ pathway
  choice. AKT also inhibits many other essential components of the HR pathway including
  rad51 and CtIP. AKT can directly phosphorylate and activate DNA-PK. Activated AKT
  forms a complex with DNA-PK and stimulates the autophosphorylation of DNA-PK.
