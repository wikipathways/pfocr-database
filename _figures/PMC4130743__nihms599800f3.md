caption: Hedgehog signalling is a pro-oncogenic pathway. Therefore, the use of Hedgehog
  agonists in therapy has always been disregarded, despite beneficial potential in
  a series of diseases []. The finding that canonical antagonists were partial agonists
  of the metabolic pathway, prompted us to further investigate the glucose uptake
  effects. Notably, Ampk activation and glucose uptake is conserved in primary human
  myocytes []. Perhaps more important the effect is preserved in vivo. Mice under
  constant cyclopamine infusion show robust, insulin-independent glucose uptake in
  skeletal muscle and BAT []. A single Cyclopamine bolus can equally clear blood glucose
  in overt, insulin-deficient, type 1 diabetic animals [], highlighting potential
  for Hedgehog selective partial agonists as glucose lowering agents. In the context
  of cancer, marked muscle spasms and weight loss marred the first successes of BCC
  patient therapy with Vismodegib []. Recent evidence suggests that these prominent
  and unforeseen side-effects of Vismodegib treatment are largely prevented by combined
  therapy with L-Type Ca2+ channel inhibitors, strong indication that the side-effects
  are non-canonical derived (personal communication). These findings provide tools
  and a platform for reassessing and validating optimal Smo-targeting strategies ().
