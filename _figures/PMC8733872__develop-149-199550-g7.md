caption: Olfaction-derived systemic GABA in lymph gland ROS homeostasis and growth
  control. The model describes the importance of olfaction-derived GABA metabolism
  in lymph gland growth control. All elements that repress growth are shown in red,
  while positive regulators of growth are shown in black. Blood progenitor cells of
  the Drosophila larval lymph gland maintain ROS in them that is derived from the
  TCA cycle. However, heightened or uncontrolled TCA cycle activity, leading to increased
  ROS production in progenitor cells, abrogates lymph gland growth and development.
  Thus, to moderate progenitor TCA activity and ROS levels, Drosophila larvae rely
  on olfaction-derived systemic GABA (eGABA). Sensing extracellular GABA (eGABA) via
  blood progenitor cells and its subsequent metabolism through the GABA catabolic
  pathway into succinate promotes the maintenance of pPDK, which is the active form
  of PDK. PDK phosphorylates PDH (pPDH) and inactivates it. PDH is a key rate-limiting
  enzyme of the TCA cycle, the activation of which drives TCA cycle activity. Thus,
  GABA metabolism in progenitor cells via activating PDK limits the TCA cycle and
  subsequently maintains ROS homeostasis therein. This metabolic state supports normal
  lymph gland growth and development. In the absence of any olfactory input or if
  the use of GABA by blood progenitors is lost, the lack of succinate in progenitor
  cells leads to increased Hph function, which blocks PDK activation that consequently
  leads to heightened TCA cycle activity and ROS generation. This leads to lymph gland
  growth retardation.
