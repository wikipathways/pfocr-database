caption: The role of Zinc in DKD through the regulation of HIF-1α. (A) Zinc supplementation
  may hinder the activation of HIF-1α by inhibiting the intranuclear shift of HIF-1α
  and destroying the heterodimerization of HIF-1. (B) Zinc can inhibit HIF-1-induced
  VEGF expression. (C) Zinc supplementation inhibits the expression of HIF-1α may
  involve the activation of zinc-induced PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signal pathway.the anti-fibrosis
  effect of zinc may be lowered by inhibiting the activation of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling
  pathway to inhibit the hypoxia-induced HIF-1α accumulation and the change of EMT
  markers. (D) Zinc supplementation can reduce the expression decline of HIF-1α in
  cells by promoting the degradation of HIF-1α in the proteasome pathway, thus inhibiting
  the adverse effects of HIF-1α in the late stage of DKD
