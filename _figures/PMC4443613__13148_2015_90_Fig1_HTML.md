caption: Glycemia-associated epigenetic mechanisms involved in NF-kB proinflammatory
  activity. Panels a–b. Cells exposed to high glucose exhibit upregulated expression
  of the NF-kB subunit of p65 gene, monomethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4),
  and demethylation of H3K9 in the p65 promoter region. Moreover, hyperglycemia induces
  NF-kB transcription factor activation through stimulation of upstream pathways,
  increasing the synthesis of inflammatory mediators (IL-6, VCAM-1, MCP-1) and the
  expression of anti-inflammatory microRNAs, e.g., miR-146a. Under persistent hyperglycemic
  conditions miR-146a cannot restrain the effect of upstream proinflammatory stimuli
  on NF-kB activation. Panel c shows that anti-diabetic agents can reduce proinflammatory
  stimuli on the NF-Kb pathway, restraining p65 activation and miR-146a expression
  but does not alter H3K4 monomethylation and H3K9 demethylation in the p65 promoter
  region. The phenomenon may explain why the cardiovascular complications of diabetes
  progress even in presence of optimal glycemic control. AGE, advanced glycation end-products;
  DAMP, damage-associated molecular patterns; IL-6, interleukin-6; MCP-1, monocyte
  chemoattractant protein-1; RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation end-products; VCAM-1,
  vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; TLR-4, toll-like receptor 4
