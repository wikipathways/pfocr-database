caption: Mechanisms by which phthalates affect epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
  (A) The green arrows indicate that both DEHP and DBP have inhibitory effects on
  EMT. DEHP could reduce the expression of the TGF-β/Smad pathway by directly inhibiting
  or downregulating PFN2, thereby suppressing EMT. Simultaneously, DBP also inhibited
  EMT not only by upregulating IP3R and intracellular calcium levels, but also by
  affecting the expression of AR and ERα. The red arrows show that DBP has a promoting
  effect on EMT. DBP increased TGF-β expression by promoting NAP-2 secretion in the
  vascular endothelium, which in turn enhanced EMT in urethral epithelial cells. Furthermore,
  DBP could induce autophagy by impairing androgen signaling and enhance the EMT process
  through the autophagy-lysosome pathway. (B) Changes in EMT levels in phthalate-treated
  neonatal rats at different sampling times. (Solid arrows represent mechanisms that
  have been demonstrated in the included studies). Dashed arrows indicate that mechanisms
  were proposed but were not experimentally validated in the included studies. Diamond-shaped
  icons represent the mechanisms that have been validated in vitro experiment in the
  included studies)
