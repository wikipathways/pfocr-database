caption: Mycobacterial mechanisms of sensing and countering endogenous or exogenous                   stress.
  The host generates free radicals, non-free-radical molecules and                 numerous
  gases as a mechanism to counter Mtb infection. These                 molecules target
  mycobacterial DNA, proteins and lipids, may alter                 Mtb gene expression,
  and change the overall metabolic profile or                 peptide pool. Free radicals
  can react with prosthetic groups such as Fe–S                 clusters or haem groups
  of the respiratory complexes. Mtb responds                 to these free radical
  stresses by adjusting its energy metabolism, physiological                 response
  and signal transduction cascade. Most of the radical-mediated damage is                 countered
  by detoxification processes comprising (a) enzymes such as catalase,                 superoxide
  dismutase and alkyl hydroperoxide, (b) redox buffering systems                 (thioredoxins,
  mycothiol, ergothioneine and protein thiols) and (c) truncated                 haemoglobins
  and cofactors (NAD+, FAD+ and coenzyme A).                   Mtb also possesses
  sensing mechanisms to detect environmental                 gases such as gradients
  of O2, NO and alterations in its intracellular                 redox state to allow
  its survival. Well-studied examples are the Dos dormancy                 regulon
  and the WhiB3 redox sensor. The Dos regulon senses O2, NO and CO                 through
  the DosS and DosT haem proteins. The signal is relayed to DosR, which leads                 to
  the induction of the 48-member Dos dormancy regulon that includes genes involved                 in
  energy production, dissipating reducing equivalents and assimilation of storage                 lipids,
  which is thought to facilitate mycobacterial persistence. WhiB3 functions as                 a
  regulator of cellular metabolism, which responds to O2 and NO through                 its
  Fe–S cluster and integrates it with intermediary metabolic pathways.                 WhiB3
  is an intracellular redox regulator that dissipates reductive stress generated                 by
  utilisation of host fatty acids through β-oxidation. Through the                 transcriptional
  activation of genes involved in lipid anabolism, WhiB3 is thought to                 direct
  reducing equivalents into the production of cell wall components and                 virulence
  lipids such as sulfolipids, phthiocerol dimycocerosates,                 polyacyltrehaloses
  and DAT. Under certain conditions, WhiB3 regulates the production                 and
  accumulation of triacylglycerol, indicating a link with the Dos dormancy                 signalling
  pathway.
