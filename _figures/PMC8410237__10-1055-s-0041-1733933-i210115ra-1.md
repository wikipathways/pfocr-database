caption: This pathway demonstrates the management of a woman with Rh negative blood
  who is postpartum. The pathway launches when a pregnancy ends and the woman enters
  the postpartum period (green circle). The first action the provider must make is
  providing education about Rh negative disease in pregnancy (gold rectangle). Then,
  the provider must simultaneously check the neonate's blood for Rh and determine
  whether the woman is already sensitized (diamond with plus sign, followed by two
  gold rectangles). If the neonate is Rh negative or the woman is sensitized, the
  pathway ends (red circle). If the neonate is Rh positive and the woman is not sensitized,
  Rh immunoglobulin is ordered and administered, and then the pathway ends (red circle).
