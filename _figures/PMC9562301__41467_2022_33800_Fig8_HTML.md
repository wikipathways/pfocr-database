caption: In genetic model, Lats1/2-knockout adipocytes can dedifferentiate into DPP4+
  progenitors and convert to DPP4− myofibroblasts. Loss of Lats1/2 activates YAP/TAZ
  that in turn enhance SMAD2 stability through inhibiting its ubiquitination. In the
  presence of CCL2 and CCL7, monocyte-derived macrophages are recruited to scWAT to
  produce TGFβ, which activates SMAD2 in dedifferentiated adipocytes to form a complex
  with YAP/TAZ. The complex translocates into the nucleus to induce transcription
  of inflammatory and fibrotic genes. In obesity model, the Hippo pathway is inhibited
  while TGFβ signaling is activated, which impairs adipocyte identity and promotes
  AT fibrosis. Moreover, CCL2/7 and macrophage form a feedforward loop to amplify
  inflammatory responses and accelerate AT fibrosis. Together, Hippo pathway inactivation
  is coupled with TGFβ stimulation to promote AT fibrosis.
