caption: Notch 1 signaling pathway and proposed mechanism of action of CJ. Notch is
  synthesized in the ER as pre-Notch. After the maturation process, Notch1 is transported
  by vesicle trafficking to the plasma membrane where it is activated, releasing NICD.
  HD-domain mutations induce a ligand-independent activation of Notch1. NICD translocates
  to the nucleus to promote transcription of target genes such as MYC, HES1, IL2R,
  NFKB2, BCL-2, and NOTCH1 itself. NICD also activates NF-κB. Thus, modulation of
  the cell cycle, differentiation, and inhibition of apoptosis takes place in a cooperative
  mechanism when Notch1 and NF-κB are involved in T-ALL. CJ-induced SERCA pump inhibition
  induces calcium release through the IP3R, which is buffered by mitochondria through
  the mCU channel, inducing a mitochondrial calcium overload followed by an induction
  of oxidative stress. This ER stress impairs signaling of the oncogenic mutant Notch1
  and activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and finally cell death of T-ALL cells.
  Notably, a combination of SERCA pump and NF-κB inhibition shows synergistic effects
  in cell death
