caption: 'Schematic representation of temporal expression pattern of carbon metabolic
  hub involving Calvin-Benson cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis, sucrose
  metabolism and starch biosynthesis. The expression levels of crucial regulatory
  genes (identified from transcriptome analysis) that may play critical roles in driving
  carbon conversion and exchange of intermediates between chloroplast and cytosol
  involving Calvin-Benson cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis, sucrose metabolism
  and starch biosynthesis in elevated CO2 grown plants at different time points (90,
  180, 270 and 360 DAT) with respect to ambient CO2 grown plants were represented
  as colored boxes. Different colour shades represent level of expression with red
  representing up-regulation while green as down-regulation. The level of regulation
  was determined based on log2fold change. The four different boxes beneath each differentially
  regulated gene represents the four time points starting from 90 DAT to 360 DAT (direction:
  left to right). [Abbreviations for metabolites and enzymes: RuBP - ribulose biphosphate;
