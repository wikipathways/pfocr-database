caption: Regulatory mechanisms of WT1 in sex differentiation. (A) In fetal WT1 + somatic
  cells, WT1 inhibits their differentiation into Leydig cells by activating the Notch
  pathway. In Sertoli cells, WT1 persists and promotes the lineage differentiation
  of Sertoli cells by inhibiting SF1 and activating the non-canonical Wnt pathway.
  (B) In Sertoli cells, WT1 activates WNT4, which activates two non-canonical Wnt
  pathways. In the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway, phosphorylated DVL activates Rac and
  Rho; Rac1 activates JNK; and RHO activates the related helix protein ROCK. JNK and
  ROCK then work together to regulate cell polarity. In the Wnt/Ca+ signaling pathway,
  Ca2+ activates PKC, which further stimulates CDC42 and promotes actin polymerization,
  thereby affecting cell polarity. WT1 promotes the expression of its target gene,
  WID, which forms a complex with DVL to inhibit WNT3a expression and, thus, β-catenin
  signaling. However, whether this mechanism exists in Sertoli cells remains to be
  confirmed. WT1, Wilms’ tumor 1; DVL, phosphorylated Disheveled
