caption: 'A model for PTP61F and JAK–STAT signalling during polarity-deficient cell
  competition. During polarity-deficient cell competition, the current model places
  the JAK–STAT pathway as having a role exclusively in the wild-type winner cells.
  JAK–STAT pathway activating ligands, the UPD molecules, are produced and secreted
  by polarity-deficient loser cells due to YKI activity and JNK signalling. JNK signalling
  itself is thought to be activated by RHO1-WND signalling, EGR-GRND signalling, and
  by a “competition signal” originating in the wild-type cells. This signal appears
  to lie downstream of JAK–STAT signalling, completing a cyclic process that culminates
  in the death and elimination of the polarity-deficient cells and the compensatory
  proliferation and persistence of the wild-type cells. However, we have identified
  a new role for JAK–STAT signalling within polarity-deficient cells. PTP61F, SOCS44A,
  and SOCS36E are all capable of downregulating the activity of the JAK–STAT signalling,
  and their knockdown slightly increases polarity-deficient cell survival, whereas
  knockdown of STAT92E has a strong effect on reducing polarity-deficient cell survival.
  This suggests JAK–STAT signalling is active within the polarity-deficient cells,
  contributing to their relative fitness. Whether JAK–STAT signalling is activated
  by autocrine UPD ligand signalling is unclear. Additionally, PTP61F also has an
  important non-cell-autonomous role in the wild-type cells in influencing the elimination
  of polarity-impaired cells, presumably by negatively regulating JAK–STAT signalling.
  Previously known data are shown in muted colours, while our findings are shown in
  bolder colours. Abbreviations: UPD = Unpaired, DOME = Domeless, HOP = Hopscotch,
  EGR = Eiger, GRND = Grindelwald, YKI = Yorkie, PTP61F = protein tyrosine phosphatase

  signalling at 36E, WND = Wallenda, JNK = c-Jun N-terminal Kinase, SWH = Salvador-Warts-Hippo,
