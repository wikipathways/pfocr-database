caption: A model for orchestration of CD8 T cell differentiation by the PI3K/Akt pathway.
  Signals resulting from engagement of cell surface receptors including TCR, co-stimulatory
  molecules, and cytokine receptors converge to activate Akt, and the magnitude of
  Akt activation is a function of the cumulative signal strength from these receptors.
  Increase in the magnitude of Akt activation progressively drives cytotoxic T lymphocytes
  (CTLs) toward terminal differentiation. We propose a model where balanced Akt activation
  fosters development of effector functions without impeding the differentiation of
  MPECs and their descendent memory CD8 T cells. However, activation of Akt above
  a certain threshold drives differentiation of CD8 T cells into terminal effectors
  at the expense of MPECs by paralyzing a multitude of cell survival mechanisms including
  incapacitation of FOXO and the Wnt/β-catenin pathways, and stimulation of the mTOR
  pathway. Thus, Akt functions as a cellular fulcrum controlling distinct facets of
  the program that governs differentiation of antigen-activated CD8 T cells into terminal
  effector cells or memory CD8 T cells.
