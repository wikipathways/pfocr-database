caption: Mechanism of Hedgehog pathway activation. In the absence of the Hh ligand
  (left panel), PTCH1, which is found in the primary cilium, binds to SMO and prevents
  its transclocation into the cilium. This leads to the sequestration of GLIs in the
  cytoplasm, their association with the negative regulator SUFU, phosphorylation by
  GSK3β/PKA/CK1 kinases, and subsequent cleavage into repressor forms (GLIR). In the
  presence of the Hh ligand (right panel), SMO inhibition by PTCH1 is relieved, and
  SMO translocates to the primary cilium and prevents GLI2 and GLI3 cleavage. GLI
  proteins dissociate from SUFU, are phosphorylated by PKC, and converted into their
  active forms (GLIA), which then translocate to the nucleus and induce target genes
  expression. (Hh; hedgehog, PTCH1; Patched 1, SMO; Smoothened, GLI; gliomaassociated
  oncogene, GSK3β; glycogen synthase kinase 3β; PKA; protein kinase A, CK1; casein
  kinase 1, SUFU; Supressor of Fused, PKC; protein kinase C).
