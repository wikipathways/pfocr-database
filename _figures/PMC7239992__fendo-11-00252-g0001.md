caption: Apolipoprotein B 100 metabolic heterogeneity in hypertriglyceridemia. Elevation
  in plasma triglyceride is associated with an increased concentration of large VLDL-VLDL1(A).
  VLDL1 once secreted from the liver enters a delipidation cascade leading to the
  formation of smaller VLDL2, IDL, and LDL (main diagram). Kinetic investigations
  reveal metabolic heterogeneity within the delipidation pathway. As shown in (B)
  [taken from Björnson et al. ()], a tracer of deuterated leucine administered at
  time 0 h appears rapidly in VLDL1 and VLDL2. Decay curves in both fractions have
  an initial rapid phase reflecting lipolysis and a second, slower phase due to remnant
  removal. This metabolic heterogeneity (as depicted by the two circles in each lipoprotein
  class in the main diagram) is more evident as plasma triglyceride rises (B). For
  further detail see Packard and Shepherd (), Björnson et al. (), Shepherd and Packard
  (), and Packard et al. ().
