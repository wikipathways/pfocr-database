caption: 'Metabolic map of phenolic and glucosinolate metabolism in the primary inflorescence
  stems of the wild type, ccr1-6, and ccr1-6 ProSNBE:CCR1 lines. The green highlighted
  part of the pathway is considered to be the major route for lignin biosynthesis.
  The gray highlighted part depicts glucosinolate biosynthesis. Dashed arrows represent
  suggested pathways. Metabolites were classified into one of eight specific groups,
  based on their abundance in the wild type, ccr1-6, and ccr1-6 ProSNBE:CCR1 ( and
  ; Supplemental Table S3). In each group, different metabolite classes are represented
  (). In the pathway, these different metabolite classes are indicated by round-angled
  boxes. Per metabolite class, the respective group(s) containing this specific class
  is (are) indicated, accompanied by heat maps. These heat maps represent the average
  peak intensities of all characterized metabolites belonging to a specific group
  for the wild type (first block), ccr1-6 (second block), and ccr1-6 ProSNBE:CCR1
  (third block), indicated by a range from blue (lowest values) to red (highest values;
  see key at bottom). The red number indicates the number of metabolites belonging
  to this group in a specific metabolic class. Terms not defined in the text are as
  follows: F5H, FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE; COMT, CAFFEIC ACID O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; CAD,
  CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE; HCALH, HYDROXYCINNAMALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE (; ).
  C3H/C4H?: Interaction between C3H and C4H has been shown for both Arabidopsis and
