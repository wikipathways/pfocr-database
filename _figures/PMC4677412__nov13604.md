caption: Altered metabolism in gliomas with IDH1 mutations. In the presence of an
  IDH mutation, normal αKG flux is diverted to generate the oncometabolite D2HG, which
  acts as a competitive inhibitor of αKG-dependent enzymes. Elevated D2HG ultimately
  increases genome-wide levels of DNA methylation by inhibition TET cytosine hydroxylases,
  key enzymes that promote the active demethylation of 5-methylcytosine. D2HG also
  inhibits histone lysine demethylases and prolyl hydroxylase, thus increasing histone
  H3 trimethylation and disrupting normal collagen maturation. Glioma cells maintain
  normal levels of key metabolites in the presence of IDH mutations by increasing
  the relative anaplerotic flux of glutamine and glutamate into the TCA cycle. This
  pathway of reductive glutamine metabolism maintains levels of TCA metabolites that
  are critical for biosynthetic processes.
