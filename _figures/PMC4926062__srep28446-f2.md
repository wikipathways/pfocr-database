caption: 'The top three networks enriched for genes with statistically significant
  interconnection between the molecules present in our dataset have been presented.
  The highest scoring network was: (A) Network 1: the connected genes correlated to
  RNA post-transcriptional modification, molecular transport and RNA trafficking (score = 54,
  focus molecules = 34) functions followed by (B) Network 2: genes are mainly involved
  in cellular assembly and organization (score = 49, focus molecules = 32) with EGFR
  occupying a central node, and (C) Network 3: genes engaged in cell cycle, DNA replication,
  recombination and repair (score = 41, focus molecules = 29). The NF-κB complex is
  one of the central node downregulated in this network. The legend explaining the
  edge type and node shape are given in the bottom right panel. Direct regulatory
  relationships are represented by solid lines and indirect regulatory networks by
  dashed lines as depicted in the legend.'
