caption: Schematic diagram of the crosstalk between glucose signaling pathways in
  yeast. Yck I (Yck1 and Yck2) phosphorylates Mth1 and Std1 upon activation by glucose-bound
  Rgt2 and Snf3 glucose sensors. Phosphorylated Mth1 and Std1 are ubiquitinated by
  the SCFGrr1 complex and degraded by the proteasome. The PKA phosphorylation sites
  in the amino terminal region of Rgt1 are exposed and available for phosphorylation
  when Mth1 is degraded. Phosphorylated Rgt1 is dissociated form Ssn6-Tup1 and subsequently
  from DNA, leading to derepression of Rgt1 target genes, such as the HXT and HXK2
  genes. The Rgt2/Snf3 pathway regulates itself through glucose-induction of STD1
  gene expression. Consequently, the STD1 gene is expressed at the same time that
  the Std1 protein is degraded in response to glucose []. By contrast, glucose stimulates
  Mth1 degradation but also represses Mth1 expression via Mig1 and Mig2. Glucose uptake
  is required for the generation of the glucose repression signal that leads to inactivation
  of the Snf1 kinase []. Expression of the MIG2 gene is induced by glucose via the
  Rgt2/Snf3 pathway. Glucose-repression of SNF3 gene expression by Mig1 reflects the
  probable function of Snf3 as a high affinity glucose sensor, representing another
  important feature of the interaction between the glucose induction and repression
  pathways.
