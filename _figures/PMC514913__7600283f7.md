caption: Model for MAPKKKα-mediated cell death signaling. Model based on epistasis
  analysis combining cell death assays with N. benthamiana plants silenced for various
  MAPKK and MAPK genes. Two MAPK cascades are shown acting downstream of Pto in a
  MAPKKKα-mediated cell death signaling pathway. A MEK2/WIPK cascade might also contribute
  to cell death via a MAPKKKα-independent pathway. Depiction of a role for MAPKKKα
  in disease-associated cell death is based on reduced bacterial speck disease symptoms
  in N. benthamiana or in tomato silenced for MAPKKKα. ‘X' indicates a possible upstream
  activator of MAPKKKα lying between Pto and MAPKKKα. Dotted lines indicate the possibility
  of the two MAPK cascades acting either sequentially or in a parallel co-dependent
  manner. ‘Y' indicates a possible integrator of signals if the pathways act in parallel.
papertitle: MAPKKKα is a positive regulator of cell death associated with both plant
  immunity and disease.
