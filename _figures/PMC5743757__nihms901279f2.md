caption: Oxidative stress leads to the generation of lipid peroxidation products,
  ROS, free radicals in lung cell types. These oxidants can further mediate activation
  of downstream biochemical events including increased and altered TLR expression
  and activation in response to allergens. Oxidants and oxidative stress also impart
  direct effect on NF-κB as well as on the molecules of NF-κB pathway leading to the
  production of inflammatory factors and lung damage. (Adapted and modified from ()).
