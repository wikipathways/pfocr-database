caption: 'APP and processing products: APP is synthesized in the ER and then transported
  to the trans-Golgi-network (TGN) where it is cleaved by secretases. In non-amyloidogenic
  pathway (left), cleavage of APP by α-secretase results in the generation of sAPPα
  and C-terminal fragments CTF83 which is further cleaved by γ-secretase into p3 and
  AICD. Proteolysis by α-secretase prevents Aβ production as the cleavage site in
  APP is within the Aβ domain. In amyloidogenic pathway (right), APP is cleaved into
  sAPPβ and CTF99 by β−secretase / BACE activity. Furthermore, CTF99 breaks down into
  AICD and Aβ by γ-secretase activity. Aβ fragments oligomerize and fibrillize into
  plaques.'
