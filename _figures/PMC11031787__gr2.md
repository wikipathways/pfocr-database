caption: 'Signaling pathways of the MOP receptors. G protein signaling pathway (left
  side) is represented by fractionation of heterotrimer Gαβγ into Gα subunit and Gβγ
  heterodimer. The Gα subunit inhibits adenylyl cyclase which in turn inhibits production
  of cAMP and PKA. This results in inhibition of ion channels in the cellular membrane.
  Heterodimer Gβγ blocks calcium channels and opens potassium channels. These events
  result in reduction of excitability and nociception and result in analgesic effects.
  β-Arrestin signaling pathway (right side) is represented by GRK-mediated phosphorylation
  on C-terminus of the receptor, which results in recruitment of β-arrestin to the
  receptor. This results in desensitization and occasionally endocytosis of the receptor,
  commonly termed as receptor internalization. Both of these events decrease the responses
  to opioids, inducing tolerance and insufficient analgesia. MOP receptor on the endosome
  can be dephosphorylated and degraded by lysosomes or resensitized through trafficking
  back to the cellular membrane. Abbreviations: α, Gα subunit; β, Gβ subunit; γ, Gγ
  subunit; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; cAMP, cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; TRPV1,
  transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1; VGSCs, voltage-gated
  sodium channels [[34], [35], [36]]. Created with BioRender.com'
