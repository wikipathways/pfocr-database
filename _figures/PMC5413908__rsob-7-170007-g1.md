caption: 'Cellular fate of mitochondrial precursor proteins translated in the cytosol.
  (a) The majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by genomic DNA, and their
  translation is executed outside mitochondria. After synthesis on ribosomes, mitochondrial
  proteins are transported to their destination inside mitochondria. In the case of
  failure of any of the processes that are involved in protein synthesis or transportation
  to the organelle, proteins are ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome or can
  form aggregates in the cytosol. (b) Schematic representation of mitochondrial protein
  translocation and sorting pathways. Precursor proteins that are synthesized in the
  cytosol cross the outer mitochondrial membrane by a common entry gate: the translocase
  of the outer membrane (TOM) complex. They are then routed by sorting pathways to
  their target location within mitochondria. Proteins that are destined to the outer
  membrane are built into the membrane by sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) or
  use the insertase of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MIM). Many proteins of the
  intermembrane space follow the mitochondrial import and assembly (MIA) pathway.
  Insertion into the inner mitochondrial membrane is mediated by translocases of the
  inner membrane TIM22 and TIM23. Matrix proteins use the TIM23 translocase coupled
  with the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM).'
