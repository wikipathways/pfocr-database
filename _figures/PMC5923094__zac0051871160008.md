caption: Mutation of charged residues in cofilin leads to azole resistance and induces
  apoptosis through a mitochondrion-dependent pathway. The mutation of charged residues
  can lead to ROS accumulation, which induces apoptosis along with the depolarization
  of Δψm, the release of cytochrome c, the upregulation of metacaspases, and DNA cleavage.
  Furthermore, some of these mutations triggered fatty acid β-oxidation, which increased
  ATP and acetyl-CoA concentrations. The extra ATP supplies additional energy to ABC
  transporters, while excess acetyl-CoA drives overexpression of cyp51A and -B by
  affecting the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. Both of these mechanisms reduced
  susceptibility to azoles.
