caption: NF-κB signalling pathways in different cell systems. In fibroblasts, the
  adapters receptor-interacting protein (RIP) and TRAF6 are important intermediaries
  for the activation of NF-κB complexes (RelA/p50 heterodimers), in response to TNFα
  and IL-1, respectively (A). Both the inhibition of IκBα by IKKβ and the phosphorylation
  of RelA by several agents regulate NF-κB activity in this system. In LTβ-activated
  EFs (B) and in BAFF-stimulated B cells (C), IKKα phosphorylates and triggers the
  processing of p100, generating a p52-containing complex that might include the transactivating
  RelB subunit. In mammary epithelial cells (D), it has been proved genetically that
  IKKα is an IκB kinase in the RANK signalling pathway. It is still unclear whether
  TRAF6 is upstream of IKKα in this system. Triggers are indicated in black, kinases
  in red, activities in dark blue, and NF-κB proteins in green; established pathways
  are indicated by black arrows, and unknown pathways by light blue arrows.
