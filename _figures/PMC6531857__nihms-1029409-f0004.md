caption: 'The heterodimeric cystine–glutamate antiporter system Xc− exchanges one
  molecule of extracellular cystine (or cystathionine) for one molecule of intracellular
  glutamate57. Once taken up by cells, cystine is reduced by reduced glutathione (GSH)
  or thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) to cysteine, which is subsequently used for
  protein and GSH synthesis. Cysteine might also be provided by the transsulfuration
  pathway. GSH is synthesized from cysteine, glutamate and glycine in two consecutive
  steps by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) and glutathione synthase (GSS) at
  the expense of two molecules of ATP. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is one of the
  central upstream regulators of ferroptosis: it prevents lipoxygenase (LOX) overactivation
  and lipid peroxidation. GPX4 preferentially reduces phospholipid hydroperoxide (PL-OOH)
  to its corresponding alcohol phospholipid hydroxide (PL-OH), using two molecules
  of GSH. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is then recycled back by glutathione reductase
  (GSR) using electrons from NADPH/H+. Concerted action of this pathway is essential
  to control the formation of oxidized phospholipids. A series of ferroptosis inducers
  have been developed and characterized that interfere at the different upstream events,
  either inhibiting cystine uptake (for example, erastin, glutamate, sulfasalazine,
  (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine (S-4-CPG) and sorafenib), GSH biosynthesis (L-buthionine
  sulfoximine (BSO)) or GPX4 activity ((1S, 3R)-RSL3 (REF. ) or altretamine). Ferrostatins,
  liproxstatin, α-tocopherol and the iron chelator deferoxamine inhibit lipid peroxidation
  and signalling events downstream of GPX4 function. CBS, cystathionine β-synthase;
  GLS, glutaminase; CTH, cystathionase.'
