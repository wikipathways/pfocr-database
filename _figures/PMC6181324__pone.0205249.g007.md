caption: 3,5-DMA undergoes biotransformation with N–O bond heterolysis and converts
  to an unstable N-OH-3,5-DMA and highly reactive intermediate nitrenium ion, which
  is able to react with a DNA base to produce a mutagenic adduct []. 3,5-DMAP can
  be produced by cytochrome P450-catalyzed hydroxylation of 3,5-DMA or by nucleophilic
  attack of H2O on the appropriate resonance form of the nitrenium ion. 3,5-DMAP readily
  undergoes redox cycling mechanism and converts to 3,5-dimethylquinoneimine (3,5-DMQI).
  The process accompanies generation of superoxide ion (O2.-). NAC can attenuate this
  cycling.
