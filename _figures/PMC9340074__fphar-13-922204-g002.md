caption: Representative medicinal compounds in O. fragrans and their biosynthetic
  pathways. (A) The main synthesis pathway containing naringenin, luteolin and DHQ
  in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway is presented. Naringenin can produce luteolin
  and DHQ through reactions catalysed by different enzymes. (B) Loganic acid is a
  terpenoid. The synthetic pathway of loganic acid in the monoterpene biosynthesis
  pathway. Loganic acid can be produced from geraniol through reactions catalysed
  by a series of enzymes. (C) SA, PCA and Ty are synthesized via three different phenolic
  acid biosynthesis pathways, but the synthetic pathway of SA can be connected to
  the synthetic pathways of PCA and Ty. The double dotted arrow in the figure represents
  the connection between the pathways. (The relevant O. fragrans gene information
  in this biosynthetic pathway map comes from an article about O. fragrans published
  by) ().
