caption: Positive and negative regulation of Hp (HAMP) transcription and systemic
  iron homeostasis through the Hp/Fpn signaling pathway. Hepatocyte production of
  Hp is affected by available iron from the store and demand. Under iron overload
  (sensed by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells), increased Hp in hepatocytes is release.
  Increased Hp binds to FPN and inhibits FPN-mediated iron export into the circulation
  to reduce Tf saturation. Conversely, when circulating iron is low and then Hp is
  low and increase iron release via Fpn into the circulation from liver, macrophage
  and intestine. Basal expression depends on regulation via BMPR and its downstream
  R-SMAD (SMAD1/5/8 signaling intermediates, which interact with common mediator SMAD
  (SMAD4) and translocate to the nucleus to activate HAMP transcription. Under inflammatory
  conditions, IL-6 is produced, which activates the STAT3 signaling pathway to promote
  transcription of Hp. Conversely, Hp expression is decrease under hypoxic or iron-deficient
  condition by stimulating kidney for expression of EPO through hypoxia-inducible
  factor (HIF1α/β) pathway as a transcription factor. Hp, which binds to ferroportin,
  causing the complex to be internalized and degraded, preventing iron export.
