caption: Either bacteria (1) or ligands for TLR 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9 receptors (2) are
  sensed by APC and activate a signaling pathway (3) that leads to the activation
  of the transcription factor NF-κB and p38 MAPK (4) to mediate the production of
  TL1A by APCs (5). The production of TL1A by APC then signals to CD4+ T cells to
  enhance IFN-γ expression and possibly other cytokines that augment Th1 immune response
  (6) in addition to its other known effect on Th2 and Th17 response.
