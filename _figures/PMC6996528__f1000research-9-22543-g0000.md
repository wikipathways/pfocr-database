caption: ( 1) Under physiological circumstances there is a tightly control of mucosal
  antigen trafficking (antigen sampling) that, in concert with specific immune cells
  and chemokine and cytokine mediators lead to anergy and therefore to mucosal tolerance.
  ( 2) Gut dysbiosis causes inappropriate production of increased amount of zonulin
  with subsequent functional loss of gut barrier function, followed by microbiota-derived
  antigen and endotoxin trafficking from the lumen to the lamina propria triggering
  innate and immunoregulatory responses causing a pro-inflammatory micromilieu. (
  3) If this process continues, an adaptive immune response is mounted, causing production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis
  factor alpha (TNF-α) that cause further opening of the paracellular pathway to the
  passage of antigens, creating a vicious cycle. ( 4) Ultimately, these processes
  lead to break of tolerance with subsequent onset of chronic inflammatory disease
  whose nature is influenced by the specific host genetic background that dictates
  which organ or tissue will be targeted by the inflammatory process. DC, dendritic
  cell; IL-10, interleukin 10; TGF-β, transforming growth factor beta; Tregs, regulatory
  T cells. This figure was re-used from Zonulin, a regulator of epithelial and endothelial
  barrier functions, and its involvement in chronic inflammatory diseases. Tissue
