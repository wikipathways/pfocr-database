caption: 'Intracellular immune ecosystem in a virus infected cell. Shown are systemic
  interactions between virus and host intracellular components involved in the general
  signaling pathways to induce interferons (IFNs) and IFN-inducible antiviral genes
  (ISGs). Briefly, upon detection of pathogen associate molecular patterns (PAMPs)
  by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), PRR-dependent signaling activates intracellular
  transcriptional factors such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), interferon regulatory
  factors (IRFs), and others. Activated transcriptional factors translocate into the
  nucleus and induce type I IFN production. IFN binds to their respective receptors
  (the interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR)/IFN-γ-R) to induce activation of the janus
  kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, which
  in turn activates the transcription complex. Activated transcriptional factors (interferon-stimulated
  gene factor 3 (ISGF3)/gamma interferon activation factor (GAF)) mediate in the induction
  of antiviral ISGs. However, viruses have evolved various strategies to counter against
  antiviral immunity or hijack cellular machinery to survive inside a host cell for
  their multiplication. Interacting viruses are shown in the yellow triangles. (Ap-1:
