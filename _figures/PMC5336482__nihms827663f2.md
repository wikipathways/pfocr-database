caption: The involvement of GSK3 in TLR4 signaling pathways.Activation of TLR4 by
  LPS or alarmins (called ligand in the figure) involves dimers of TLR4 binding to
  CD14 and MD-2. This induces Myd88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88)-dependent
  signaling to two serine-threonine kinases, IRAK4 (IL-1-receptor associated kinase
  4) and IRAK1, which in turn bind to the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6) leading to activation of the serine-threonine kinase TAK1 (transforming
  growth factor beta-activated kinase 1), which is a site of regulation by GSK3. TAK1
  phosphorylates the IκB kinase complex (IKK), which activates IKK. IKK in turn phosphorylates
  IκB, which releases active NF-κB. NF-κB, activation of which is promoted by GSK3,
  then migrates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of proinflammatory
  cytokines. TAK1 also activates the kinases p38 and JNK, which activate other transcription
  factors, such as AP-1 (activator protein 1), and CREB (cyclic AMP response element
  binding protein) that are involved in the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines
  and are inhibited by GSK3. Activated TLR4 also signals through a Myd88-independent
  pathway via TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor molecule) and TRIF (TIR domain-containing
  adaptor-inducing IFN-β) to activate TRAF3 (TNF receptor-associated factor 3), which
  in turn activates the serine/threonine kinase, TBK1 (TANK Binding kinase 1), which
  is regulated by GSK3. TBK1 promotes activation of the transcription factor IRF3
  (interferon regulatory factor-3), which translocates to the nucleus where it induces
  the production of type I interferons.

    TAK1 phosphorylates the IκB kinase complex (IKK), which activates IKK. IKK in
