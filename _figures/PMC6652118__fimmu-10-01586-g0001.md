caption: RIG-I/MDA5 signaling pathway RIG-I and MDA5 are first activated by recognition
  of PAMP dsRNA, which causes them to interact with MAVS. Following the activation
  of MAVS by RIG-I/MDA5, a molecular cascade involves the interaction of IKKε and
  TBK1, which is followed by phosphorylation of the transcription factors IRF3 and
  IRF7, ensure to translocate the phosphorylated p-IRF3 and p-IRF7 into the nucleus,
  where they dimerize and bind to transcription factor binding sites of the IFNα and
  IFNβ genes to activate their transcriptions. Expression and exportation of these
  genes into the cellular milieu trigger the IFN1 signaling cascade in an autocrine
  or paracrine fashion to induce expression of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes
  (ISGs) and inflammatory genes to confer antiviral resistance. RIG-I and MDA5 also
  activate the NF-κB pathway. RIG-I appears to act upstream of the canonical pathway,
  which results in the translocation of the two functional NF-κB units (p50 and p65)
  into the nucleus, while MDA5 appears to affect NF-κB expression independently from
  this pathway. Figure created using BioRender software.
