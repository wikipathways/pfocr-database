caption: 'Proteins implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD) maintain a healthy pool
  of mitochondria. The effects of PD-linked proteins (thick green line) on mitochondrial
  function can be divided into three different groups. Bioenergetics (yellow): Pink1
  and Parkin regulate the turnover of several subunits of ETC complexes by the ubiquitin
  proteasome system (UPS). In addition, Pink1 supports complex I activity through
  a kinase cascade involving tricornered (trc) and mTORC2. Mitochondrially localized
  α-synuclein (α-syn), however, inhibits complex I. Oxidation of the mitochondrial
  phospholipid cardiolipin translocates this lipid from the inner to the outer mitochondrial
  membrane where it serves as a receptor for α-synuclein. Hence, in the presence of
  elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial α-synuclein import
  is increased. LRRK2 and DJ-1 regulate the activity of uncoupling proteins (UCPs),
  which preserve the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Both PD proteins therefore
  indirectly maintain ATP production. Mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt,
  blue): When activated, Pink1 phosphorylates the chaperone Trap1, a protein that
  protects mitochondrial proteins from ROS. In addition, Trap1 works with Hsp60 to
  refold imported proteins, sustaining mitochondrial protein homeostasis. In the presence
  of ROS, DJ-1 is translocated into mitochondria, where it interacts with the chaperone
  Mortalin to salvage oxidized proteins. Mitochondrial dynamics (orange): LRRK2 directs
  mitochondrial fission as it interacts with and recruits the mitochondrial fission
  protein Drp1. DJ-1 increases mitochondrial fission by regulating Drp1 levels, although
  the exact mechanism through which the chaperone executes this function is not clear.
  The E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin inhibits mitochondrial fusion through ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation of the fusion protein Mitofusin (Mfn). Mitochondrial transport is regulated
  by the Pink1/Parkin pathway. Here, Parkin-mediated degradation of the adaptor protein
  Miro is thought to detach a dysfunctional mitochondrion from kinesin motor proteins,
  halting its transport. Finally, when a dysfunctional mitochondrion cannot be repaired,
  it is cleared through mitophagy. Under basal conditions, the protein kinase Pink1
  is imported into the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it is cleaved by 2
  proteases and subsequently degraded. However, upon mitigation of the MMP, Pink1
  is no longer cleaved. The protein then phosphorylates and activates the E3 ubiquitin
  ligase Parkin. Parkin, along with E2 ligases such as Rad6, initiates mitophagy by
  ubiquitinating target proteins.'
