caption: Nef-mediated activation of Itk requires Nef homodimers. A, Nef recruits Itk
  to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and induces 2:2 Nef·Itk complex formation.
  Regulatory domain displacement and kinase domain juxtaposition induces constitutive
  kinase activation through trans-autophosphorylation. Dimerization-defective Nef
  mutants still interact with Itk at the membrane but form inactive 1:1 complexes.
  3, Src homology 3 domain; 2, Src homology 2 domain; K, kinase domain; P, activation
  loop phosphorylation. B, activation of the T-cell receptor complex normally requires
  antigen-loaded MHC molecules from an antigen-presenting cell. The MHC-bound receptor
  then activates the Src-family kinase Lck, which is associated with the cytosolic
  tail of CD4. Lck phosphorylates and activates Itk, which in turn activates phospholipase
  Cγ (PLCγ) by direct phosphorylation. Phospholipase Cγ generates diacylglycerol (DAG)
  and inositol triphosphate (IP3) via hydrolysis of membrane phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), leading to activation of protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ) and the
  calcium-dependent protein-serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin (Cal). Protein
  kinase Cθ promotes activation of NF-κB via the CARMA1/BCL10/MALT1 complex (not shown),
  whereas calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT to drive nuclear localization. The NF-κB
  and NFAT transcription factors both enhance transcription of the integrated HIV-1
  provirus early in the viral life cycle (). Direct activation of Itk by Nef at the
  membrane downstream of the TCR may promote viral transcription through this pathway
  (see “Nef and Tec-family kinases”). LTR, long terminal repeat.
