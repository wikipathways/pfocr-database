caption: Model of the inverse relationship between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and HIV
  replication. When the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is active, HIV replication is inhibited
  in astrocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), and monocytes/macrophages. When
  β-catenin signaling is inactive or suppressed, as occurs when monocytes differentiate
  into macrophages or astrocytes are exposed to IFNγ, HIV replication is enhanced
