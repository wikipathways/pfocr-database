caption: 'An offshoot of a signalling pathway resulting in the activation of an alternate
  M1 or M2 response is an important constructive feature of the intracellular pathways
  of macrophage reprogramming. The figure shows the offshoot of the TGF-β-dependent
  pathway of macrophage reprogramming. The signalling pathways transmitting the signal
  from TGF-β (RF-M2) and reprogramming macrophages to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype
  via SMAD2/3/4 possess the intracellular offshoot, which, in case of its activation,
  can upregulate the production of the proinflammatory M1 cytokines. Due to the offshoots
  of the intracellular signal pathways resulting in the production of alternate pro-
  and anti-inflammatory cytokines, macrophages can prevent an excessive inflammation
  and tissue damage during the reprogramming of macrophages to the M1 phenotype (e.g.,
  when there is a need to eliminate a virus or bacterium) or a critical decrease in
  proinflammatory activity of macrophages and, therefore, their bactericidal function
  and the capacity to develop the autoimmune processes during the M2 phenotype reprogramming
  (e.g., when there is a need to kill extracellular parasites). SMAD2/3/4, p38, and
  AP-1: transcription factors.'
