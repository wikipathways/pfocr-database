caption: SEPN1 and ER stress. Unfolded proteins trigger ER stress and the consequent
  UPR by the activation of three sensors ATF6, IRE1 and PERK. Generally, this is a
  homeostatic response that restores ER homeostasis. After being proteolytically cleaved
  in the Golgi, ATF6 works as a transcription factor of UPR target genes. IRE1 promotes
  the splicing of XBP1 into XBP1s, which also works as a transcription factor for
  chaperones and ERAD proteins. PERK reduces protein synthesis by the phosphorylation
  of eif2 alpha and promotes the transcription of ATF4. The PERK pathway is also connected
  to pro-apoptotic signals via the transcription factor CHOP that, through the induction
  of GADD34, promotes recovery of the translation and, through ERO1, promotes the
  oxidative protein folding. However, ERO1 during oxidative protein folding also generates
  the oxidant H2O2, thus being involved in hyperoxidation. The expression of the type
  II membrane protein SEPN1 is regulated by ER stress and, through a redox reaction
  which involves the thioredoxin-like (CU) domain, counteracts ERO1-mediated hyperoxidation.
