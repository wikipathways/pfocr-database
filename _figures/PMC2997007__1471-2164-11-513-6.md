caption: 'Identification of putative signaling regulators for immune-modification.
  Key node analysis in the TRANSPATH database for putative unique signaling master
  regulator/molecule at 0.5 h with significant inhibition of expression (≥3-fold decrease)
  in LPS-induced THP-1 cells co-treated with (A) shikonin, (B) emodin, or (C) BF/S+L/Ep
  at 12 h. Less than four hierarchical levels of regulation were accepted and selected.
  Pink circle: the putative master regulator/molecule; green box: the ratio of gene
  expression seen with the phytocompounds plus LPS compared to LPS only; gray circle:
  assigned molecule in the putative pathway; ↑: activation; ⊥: inhibition.'
