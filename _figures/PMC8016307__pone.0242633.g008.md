caption: Mesophyll tissues of the late-stage flowers (blue) are source tissues for
  the photosynthetic (PS) production of sucrose (SUC). Sucrose and/or raffinose (SUC/RAF)
  are transported through glandular trichome stalks (yellow) to glandular trichome
  head sink tissue (orange) via yet unidentified mechanisms. Sugars in the glandular
  trichome heads are shunted into glycolysis (GLY) and the oxidative pentose phosphate
  pathway (OPP) to supply carbon to mitochondria and plastids. In mitochondria, catabolites
  enter the Krebs cycle (TCA) and respiratory chain (RES) for energy production. Resulting
  carbon dioxide is partially recycled through pep-carboxylase (PC) activity, and
  the ATP producedis used to generate proton gradients through ATPase activity and
  to drive primary active transport energised by ABC transporters (ABC). In plastids,
  catabolites can support terpenoid and cannabinoid biosynthesis (C/TBS) through the
  MEP pathway and, in case of cannabinoids, additionally through fatty acid metabolism
  (FAM). Stalks show PS and RES activity in addition to active detoxification (DETOX).
