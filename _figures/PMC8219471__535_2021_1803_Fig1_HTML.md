caption: cGAS–STING signaling pathway in liver immune cells. When exogenous pathogens
  such as viruses and bacteria invade cells, the released exogenous DNA and endogenous
  host DNA are recognized by cGAS and activate STING through the production of cGAMP.
  The activated STING produces a large number of cytokines such as interferons and
  inflammatory factors mainly through the downstream TBK1–IRF3 and IKK–NF-κB signaling
  pathways. After these cytokines are released extracellularly, they can exert immunological
  effects such as anti-cancer, anti-viral, inflammation, and non-immunological effects
  such as cell senescence and apoptosis
