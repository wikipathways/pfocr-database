caption: 'NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in transplantation. This diagram displays the
  molecular mechanisms underlying NLRP3 inflammasome activation, with an emphasis
  on those specific to solid organ transplant. Classical Canonical NLRP3/caspase-1
  activation: P2X7 receptor activation by extracellular ATP leads to MLKL activation.
  Exposure to pore-forming gasdermin D combined with lysosomal damage and cathepsin
  release promote potassium efflux, with consequent release of oxidized mitochondrial
  DNA and dd-cfDNA—leading to increase in mitochondrial ROS and cardiolipin externalization.
  This in turn promotes NLRP3 inflammasome oligomerization and activation with the
  consequent release of IL-1β,IL-18, and HMGB1 and the autocatalytic cleavage of caspase-1.
  This active form of caspase-1 is also a major driver of the cell death pathway pyroptosis
  (see main text). Non-canonical caspase-11-dependent NLRP3 activation—bacterial infection
  in transplant: Gram-negative bacteria activate caspase-11, cleaving pore-forming
  gasdermin D between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. Cleaved gasdermin D promotes
  pyroptosis and the activation of canonical NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 signaling. Non-canonical
  caspase-8 NLRP3 activation—fungal infection in transplant: TLRs activation by PAMPs
  and/or DAMPs such as dd-cfDNA activate the RIP1–FADD-caspase-8 pathway and NF-kB
  alongside the promotion of canonical NLRP3 activation. Moreover, fungal PAMPS, via
  dectin-1 activation, promote the activation of the MALT1–caspase-8–ASC complex,
  which promotes the processing and release of IL-1β. NLRP3 transcription steps: Transcription
  steps are regulated by TLRs—MyD88, TNFR and/or IFNα, β-JAK/STAT, which, promoting
  NF-κB activation, induce the transcription of pro-IL-1β, NLRP3, procaspase-1, IRF-3
  and IRF-7, and procaspase-11. The activation of TLRs stimulates the formation of
  RIP1–FADD-caspase-8 complex accelerating NF-kB transcription.'
