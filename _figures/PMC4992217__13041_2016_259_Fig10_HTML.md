caption: mGluR5 and CB1 cooperatively activate cell signaling pathways to promote
  neuroprotection. Glutamate release causes activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
  (NMDAR), which increases intracellular Ca2+, and metabotropic glutamate receptor
  5 (mGluR5), which activates various cell signaling pathways. mGluR5 is present at
  the postsynaptic site and can be stimulated by CDPPB, leading to the activation
  of different neuroprotective effectors, such as the extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and AKT. Moreover, mGluR5 is part of a signalosome that contains
  the two key enzymes for 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) synthesis and, thus, mGluR5
  activation can increase 2-AG levels. However, both MPEP, an mGluR5 blocker, and
  AM251, a CB1 antagonist, can block mGluR5-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and AKT
  and, thus, neuroprotection. The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), which is present at
  the presynaptic site, is stimulated by 2-AG and anandamide (AEA), leading to activation
  of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and AKT. CB1 activation can also
  inhibit presynaptic glutamate release and, therefore, blunt mGluR5 activation by
  glutamate. JZL184 and URB597, which are monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) and fatty
  acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors, respectively, increase the levels of anandamide
  and 2-AG, leading to activation of ERK1/2 and AKT and promoting neuroprotection.
  However, this effect can be blocked by both MPEP and AM251. Therefore, mGluR5 and
  CB1 are part of the same cell signaling pathway, working cooperatively to trigger
  activation of ERK1/2 and AKT and promote neuroprotection. AA arachidonic acid
