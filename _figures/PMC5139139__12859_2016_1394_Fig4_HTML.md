caption: 'Linking identical processes found between two metabolic maps. The figure
  shows two PD maps: one for the activation of the gene IRF1 pathway (green background)
  and one for the iNOS pathway (blue background). Visualization from Neo4j web interface.
  The yellow relationships represent the linking of identical processes found in both
  graphs. Those two maps have common processes: the IFNG binds the IFNG receptor,
  inducing the phosphorylation of the complex. This stimulates the phosphorylation
  of STAT1alpha. On the left (green background) the gene regulatory region triggers
  the transcription of IRF1 and on the right, the pathway activated by the gene IRF1'
