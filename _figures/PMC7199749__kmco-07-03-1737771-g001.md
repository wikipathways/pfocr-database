caption: Genomic stabilization by TTK. Inhibition of TTK protein kinase (TTK) leads
  to an increase in aneuploidy, lagging chromosomes, and mitotic catastrophe through
  its canonical role in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) complex. Our findings
  demonstrate a novel role for TTK in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. Inhibition
  of TTK with knockdown, kinase-dead constructs, and a clinical grade inhibitor, Bayer
  1161909, decreases in the efficiency of HR but has no effect on non-homologous end
  joining (NHEJ). IR – ionizing radiation.
