caption: 'Cancer-related pathways in cuproptosis. a Cuproptosis induction in tumor
  suppression. The tumor suppressor p53 inhibits glucose uptake and glycolysis, shifting
  metabolism towards the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, which sensitizes
  cells to cuproptosis. It also suppresses NADPH production by inhibiting G6PD and
  the pentose phosphate pathway, resulting in decreased GSH levels. Intratumoral copper
  enhances METTL16-K229 lactylation and activity through its interaction with AARS1
  or AARS2, leading to increased FDX1 expression and cuproptosis induction. Additionally,
  the metabolite 4-OI alkylates cysteine residues in GAPDH, inhibiting its activity
  and suppressing aerobic glycolysis, thereby further promoting cuproptosis. b Cuproptosis
  evasion in tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Increased MELK expression
  in tumors activates the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway, leading to elevated DLAT expression
  and stabilized mitochondrial function, which enhances resistance to cuproptosis.
  Additionally, copper binds to PDK1, activating the downstream AKT-GSK3β-β-catenin
  pathway and promoting CSC characteristics. CSCs demonstrate heightened resistance
  to cuproptosis, as the β-catenin/TCF4 transcription complex binds to the ATP7B promoter,
  facilitating copper expulsion. Created by BioRender. Abbreviations: TCA tricarboxylic
