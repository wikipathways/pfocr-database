caption: 'SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm and mechanism of action of anti-IL-6 and
  anti-IL-6R drugs. IL-6/IL-6R signaling pathway: the binding of IL-6 to its soluble
  (sIL-6R) and membrane-bound receptors (mIL-6R) determines their dimerization, resulting
  in the juxtaposing of receptor-associated JAKs. The JAKs subsequently undergo auto-phosphorylation
  and/or transphosphorylation on target tyrosine residues. The activation of JAKs
  results in the propagation of the cytokine-mediated signal and finally determines
  the activation of transcription factors, such as the STATs. The activated STATs
  dimerize and translocate to the cell nucleus to induce or suppress target genes
  []. Anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-6R agents inhibit sIL-6R and mIL-6R-mediated signaling.
