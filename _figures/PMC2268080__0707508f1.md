caption: 'Types of β-arrestin-dependent, G-protein-independent signals. (a) Differential
  localization of ERK1/2. β-Arrestins can activate ERK1/2 downstream of numerous GPCRs
  and effectively ‘steal'' the kinases away the G-protein-dependent pathway. In the
  case of PAR-2 and AT1R, signalling through Gαq leads to mobilization of intracellular
  Ca2+, activation of conventional PKCs and Ras-dependent activation of the MAPK module
  (Raf-1, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2). The activated ERKs translocate to the nucleus where
  they phosphorylate transcription factors (TF) leading to gene expression and proliferation.
  When activated through β-arrestins, the entire MAPK module is scaffolded onto the
  β-arrestin-bound receptor, forming an ‘endosomal scaffold'' that promotes prolonged
  activation of ERK1/2 at the membrane or within the cytosol preventing the transcriptional
  and proliferative effects and promoting cytoskeletal reorganization and chemotaxis.
  (b) Opposing signalling: PAR-2 to PI3K. PAR-2 can both activate and inhibit PI3K
  in a cell-type-specific fashion, depending on the expression level of β-arrestins.
  Activation of the classical Gaq/Ca2+pathway leads to increased activity of the p110
  catalytic subunit of PI3K, leading to generation of PIP3. Recruitment of β-arrestins
  leads to the formation of a unique endosomal scaffold containing the regulatory
  (p85) and catalytic PI3K subunits. Binding to β-arrestins directly inhibits PI3K
  activity. (c) Synergistic signalling: AT1R and RhoA. AT1R activates RhoA, leading
  to stress fibre formation, through activation of the RhoA effector ROCK. Both β-arrestin-dependent
  recruitment to the receptor and coupling to Gαq are required for RhoA activation
  and subsequent stress fibre formation, indicating a convergence of the two pathways
  at the level of RhoA. AT1R, type I angiotensin II receptor; GPCR, G-protein-coupled
