caption: 'Schematic representation of the ERK1/2-CaMKII secondary fusion pathwaySchematic
  of the ERK-CaMKII signaling pathway during myoblast differentiation and fusion:
  (1) In proliferating myoblasts ERK1/2 suppresses MYOG and p21/p27 activation. (2)
  Upon ERK1/2 inhibition, p21/p27 are expressed and cells exit the cell cycle; simultaneously,
  MYOG is upregulated and cells differentiate. (3) During the differentiation process,
  ERK1/2 inhibition results in reduced phosphoinhibition of RXR leading to RYR1/3
  upregulation and accumulation in early myotubes. RYR activity promotes in Ca2+-dependent
  CaMKII activation and CaMKII-dependent myotube driven asymmetric fusion, likely
  through CaMKII regulation of MYMK and Rac1.'
