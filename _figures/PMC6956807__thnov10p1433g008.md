caption: Proposed model for miR-204-5p-SNAI2/SUZ12/HDAC1/JAK2/STAT3 regulatory circuit
  in HNSCC progression. SNAI2, SUZ12, HDAC1 and JAK2 were all the direct targets of
  miR-204-5p. Loss of miR-204-5p promoted formation of a SNAI2/SUZ12/HDAC1 repressor
  complex and activated the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which in turn transcriptionally
  inhibited the expression of miR-204-5p and CDH1. miR-204-5p-SNAI2/SUZ12/HDAC1/STAT3
  feedback loop is necessary to maintain a partial EMT phenotype in HNSCC.
