caption: Chronic stress induced tumour angiogenesis. This study suggested that stress-related
  hormones were directly connected with tumour angiogenesis. Based on this findings,
  a majority of cancer cases suffered from depression and anxiety to certain degrees,
  which trigger body release catecholamines. The β2-AR agonist isoprenaline activated
  VEGF autocrine of vascular endothelial cells, which subsequently recognized and
  activated their receptors VEGFR2. PlexinA1 is necessary in the process of VEGF activated
  VEGFR2 and further affected the ability of proliferation, migration and tube formation
  of VECs through activating JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Thus, chronic stress promote
  plexinA1/VEGFR2-JAK2-STAT3 in VECs to promote tumor angiogenesis.
