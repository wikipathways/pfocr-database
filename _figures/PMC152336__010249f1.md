caption: Pathway of Carotenoid and Abscisic Acid Biosynthesis in Maize.The first committed
  step in the pathway is the formation of phytoene from two molecules of geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate. A series of desaturations (PDS/ZDS) and isomerizations (CRTISO) leads
  to the formation of the linear carotenoid lycopene. The pathway branches after the
  cyclization of lycopene by two enzymes. β-Carotene is formed by the action of lycopene
  β-cyclase (βLCY) at both ends of the lycopene molecule, resulting in two β-rings.
  α-Carotene is generated through the action of βLCY and lycopene ɛ-cyclase (ɛLCY),
  resulting in an ɛ-ring and a β-ring. Subsequent hydroxylations and epoxidations
  lead to the formation of β-carotene derivatives, including abscisic acid (ABA),
  and α-carotene derivatives such as lutein. Potential blocks in the biosynthetic
  pathway associated with various maize mutants are shown in parentheses. AO, aldehyde
