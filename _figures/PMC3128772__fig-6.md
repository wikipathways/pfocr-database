caption: Schematic of cell signaling between rNSCs and hMSCs in coculture. Data obtained
  from multiple assays indicate activation of the classical Notch signaling pathway
  in both the hMSCs and rNSCs. Notch signaling is thought to be unidirectional; therefore,
  the data suggest that Notch signaling is directed from hMSCs to rNSCs in some sub-populations
  of the cocultures and from rNSCs to hMSCs in other sub-populations.
