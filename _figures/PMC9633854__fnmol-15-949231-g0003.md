  antagonists or anti-IFN-γ antibodies may improve the development of MS. Targeted
  delivery of certain effective therapeutic genes through the specific recognition
  of the CP by AAV5 has very important therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative
  diseases of the brain or some refractory diseases. CPC can reduce CSF secretion
