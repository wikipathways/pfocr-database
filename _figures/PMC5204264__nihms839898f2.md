caption: a, Genetic alterations in human cancers can generate proteome imbalance.
  Myc protein promotes the RNA polymerase (RNA pol) I- and RNA pol III-dependent transcription
  of rRNAs; it also promotes the RNA pol II-dependent transcription of ribosomal proteins
  to induce ribosome production. Elevated levels of some ribosomal proteins in excess
  of the assembled ribosome can lead to the activation of the ribosomal surveillance
  pathway, which stimulates cell death pathways. At the same time, Myc activates about
  15% of protein-coding genes that are transcribed by RNA pol II, thereby increasing
  the protein-synthesis load of the cell. This is likely to increase the number of
  defective translation products, which lead to an increase in proteotoxic stress.
  Similarly, the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the PI3K signalling
  pathways that stimulate AKT1 and mTORC1 activity, or the overexpression of translation
  initiation factors eIF4F and eIF3 can increase protein synthesis, also leading to
  increased levels of proteotoxic stress. b, Two transcriptional response systems
  sense imbalance in the proteome and can elevate the cell’s capacity for protein
  folding or degradation. One mode of control involves the conversion of a pool of
  inactive HSF proteins in response to perturbations such as heat shock into an active
  nuclear transcription complex that binds a promoter known as a heat-shock element
  (HSE). This leads to the expression of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), including chaperones,
  and increases the cell’s capacity for protein folding. Another mode of control is
  the production of proteasome subunits to increase the cellular capacity for protein
  degradation. Under basal conditions, transcription factor NRF1 in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) is targeted for p97-dependent proteasomal degradation through ER-associated
  degradation (ERAD) (not shown). However, when the activity of the proteasome is
  inhibited or depleted, retrotranslocated NRF1 is cleaved by an unknown protease,
  which facilitates the translocation of NRF1 into the nucleus where it activates
  the transcription of proteasome subunit genes. Global environmental and integrated
  stress-response pathways also attempt to rebalance the proteome through reduced
  translational output (red box) and enhanced cellular defence systems (green box)
  such as protein folding and degradation machineries. ARE, antioxidant response element;
