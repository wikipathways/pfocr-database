caption: Regulation of host-encoded DUBs in innate immune response. Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs) are a type of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) and subsequently change their conformation to initiate
  downstream signaling. TLRs are located on the cell membrane, phagosome membrane,
  endosome, and endoplasmic reticulum (TLRs on endosomes and endoplasmic reticulum
  are not shown). TLRs can activate the expression of NF-κB or IRF3 and subsequently
  induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines or IFN-β in the nucleus. Activated
  TLRs recruit adaptor proteins, including TIRAP, MyD88, TRAM, and TRIF. First, the
  adaptors interact with IRAKs and TRAF6 and then activate NF-κB through the TAK1-IKK-IκB
  axis. Second, the adaptors mediate the expression of IRF3 via TRIF-TRAF3-TBK1 signaling.
  In addition, another PRR, RIG-I, which belongs to the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs)
  family, is responsible for sensing RNA of pathogens. It interacts with MAVS, which
  further induces both NF-κB and IRF3. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING), located
  on the endoplasmic reticulum senses cytoplasmic DNA and regulates IFN signaling
  by activating TBK1 and IRF3. IFN-β induces the phosphorylation of JAK and expression
  of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) by activating the downstream JAK-STAT pathway.
  Host-encoded DUBs interact with the above signaling molecules to modulate the innate
  immune response. Their deubiquitinating function and substrates are shown in the
  schematic.
