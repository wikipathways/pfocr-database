caption: 'The cell cycle is a series of events that lead to cell division. It comprises
  four phases: the first gap phase called G1 during which cells prepare for DNA replication,
  the S phase of DNA synthesis, a second gap phase called G2, and the M phase of cell
  mitosis in which segregation of replicated chromosomes into two separate cells occurs.
  Cells in G1 can, before DNA replication, enter a resting state, called G0. Progression
  through the cell cycle is tightly regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK 1,
  2, 4, 6). CDKs are serine/threonine protein kinases that phosphorylate key substrates
  for DNA synthesis and mitotic progression. CDKs interact with various positive and
  negative cell cycle regulators. Cyclins (A, B, D, E) are positive cell cycle regulators
  that represent the regulatory subunits of CDKs; their binding to CDKs allows inactive
  CDKs adopting an active configuration, driving transition phases. Different cyclins
  are required at different phases of the cell cycle. For instance, D-type cyclins
  bind to CDK4/6 forming the active cyclin D/CDK4/6 complex that is necessary for
  progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The G1 phase is considered a
  critical window during which cells decide to proliferate, assume a reversible arrest
  (G0), or begin a path toward terminal differentiation or senescence. The activity
  of CDKs can be counteracted by the CDK inhibitory protein/Kinase inhibitory protein
  (Cip/Kip) family, that includes p21CIP1 (p21), p27KIP1 (p27), p57KIP2 (p57) and
  by proteins of the INK4 family. These negative cell cycle regulators inhibit cell
  cycle progression by binding to specific CDKs alone (INK4 family) or cyclin-CDK
  complexes (Cip/Kip family).'
