caption: Metabolic fate of ingested 4MSOB GLS in P. chrysocephala adults. Ingested
  4MSOB GLS is partially sequestered and additionally detoxified by desulfation. A
  fraction of ingested 4MSOB GLS is activated by the plant myrosinase to 4MSOB isothiocyanate
  (ITC) and the corresponding nitrile (4MSOB-cyanide). 4MSOB-ITC is detoxified by
  conjugation with glutathione (GSH). The ITC-GSH conjugate is metabolized via the
  mercapturic acid pathway to several cyclic ITC-Cys conjugates, i.e., 2-(4-(methylsulfinyl)butylamino)-4,5-dihydrothiazole-carboxylic
  acid (4MSOB-ITC-Cyclic-Cys conjugate A), 4-amino-3- (4-(methylsulfinyl)butyl)-2-
  thioxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (4MSOB-ITC-Cyclic-Cys conjugate B, compound
  2), and 4-hydroxy-3-(4-(methylsulfinyl)butyl)-2-thioxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic
  acid (4MSOB-ITC-Cyclic-Cys conjugate C, compound 3). Additionally, 4MSOB-amine and
  4MSOB-acetamide (compound 1) were detected. Proposed metabolic steps are indicated
  with dashed arrows.
