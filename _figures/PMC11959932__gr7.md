caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed mechanisms by which FLZ alleviated
  PD pathological damage through increasing GUDCA production in Clostridium innocuum.
  In PD mouse model, FLZ treatment inhibited BSH enzyme activity in Clostridium innocuum,
  through which FLZ promoted the productions of GUDCA detected in the feces, urine,
  plasma and midbrain. The microbial metabolite GUDCA was capable of suppressing intestinal
  inflammation and therefore attenuated gut barrier destruction. As followed, GUDCA
  could improve systemic inflammation. GUDCA passed through blood–brain barrier, bound
  with FXR, and activated Nrf2 signaling pathway. Therefore, GUDCA suppressed neuroinflammation,
  restored brain barrier structure, and finally protected dopaminergic neurons from
  injury, further proving that regulation of the gut-brain axis is an important mechanism
  for FLZ to treat PD
