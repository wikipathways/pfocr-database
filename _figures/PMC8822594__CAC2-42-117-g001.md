caption: 'The lncRNA‐RBP interaction network in cancer phenotypes. (A) lncRNAs interact
  with RBPs to influence tumor cell development and progression. (B) FEZF1‐AS1 increases
  the stability of PKM2 by binding to PKM2, promoting the production of PKM2 in the
  nucleus, activating STAT3 signaling, and promoting aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect)
  and, ultimately, cancer cell proliferation. (C) LINC00460 binds to EZH2, which inhibits
  the transcription of KLF2. LINC00460 also sponges miR‐149‐5p and antagonizes its
  translational inhibition of the cullin 4A (CUL4A) protein. Through these two pathways,
  apoptosis of tumor cells is ultimately inhibited. (D) In the nucleus, lncRNA CACS9
  recruits CBP to regulate the level of H3K27ac, which in turn promotes the transcription
  of ITGB4 and LAMC2. LAMC2 exits in the nucleus and moves to the extracellular matrix,
  where it binds to ITGB4 in the cell membrane, further activating the FAK‐PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway and ultimately promoting esophageal cancer metastasis. (E) The
  binding of AGAP2‐AS1 to CBP (a transcriptional coactivator) promotes H3K27ac enrichment
  in the promoter region of MyD88, leading to the upregulation of MyD88 expression.
  MyD88 further activates the downstream NF‐κB pathway, leading to an increase in
  drug resistance in tumor cells. Abbreviations: lncRNA, Long non‐coding RNA; RBP,
