caption: 'Unfolded protein response and its regulation on cell activities. Left panel:
  Under non-stress condition, ER lumenal GRP78, in addition to folding proteins, binds
  to IRE1α, ATF6, PERK and caspase-12 and -7, quenching their activation. Right panel:
  When cells are under ER stress, GRP78 is titrated away through binding to the malfolded
  proteins, resulting in activation of the IRE1α, ATF6 and PERK signaling pathway.
  IRE1α activates its RNase activity to cleave the mRNA of XBP1, resulting in a spliced
  form of XBP1 (XBP1-s). ATF6 translocates from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where
  it is cleaved into the active nuclear form ATF6(N). PERK dimerizes and autophosphorylates,
  and thereby phosphorylates its two major substrates eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 2α (eIF2α) and nuclear factor-like 2 (Nrf2). eIF2α phosphorylation attenuates
  global protein synthesis, and inhibits cyclin D1 translation through which contributes
  to cell cycle arrest. The phosphorylation of eIF2α also activates the transcription
  of ATF4. XBP1(s), ATF6(N) and ATF4 act in concert to induce transcription of target
  genes mediating protein folding and degradation. Autophagy is also triggered. Another
  function of phosphorylated eIF2α is to activate CHOP which promotes apoptosis. The
  phosphorylation of Nrf2 activates the expression of enzymes required for ROS quenching,
  and thereby inhibits ROS accumulation. Procaspase-12 and -7, upon released from
  GRP78, are cleaved into their activated forms triggering apoptosis.'
