caption: Activation and regulation of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway in cells. The cGAS
  is activated by viral and bacterial DNA as well as mtDNA and phagocytosed DNA aberrantly
  localized in the cytosol. Activated cGAS uses ATP and GTP as substrates to catalyze
  the formation of the second messenger, cGAMP, which binds to STING localized on
  the ER membrane. The binding of cGAMP to STING promotes STING translocation to the
  Golgi apparatus. During the translocation, STING recruits and activates TBK1, which
  in turn catalyzes the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3, and to
  a lesser extent NF-κB, which can also be activated by IKK, leading to increased
  synthesis of IFN and other inflammatory genes.
