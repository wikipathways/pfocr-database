caption: Central role of self-nucleic acids in obesity-mediated metaflammation. Obesity
  induces an accumulation of different sources and forms of self-nucleic acids (NA).
  Genomic-, mitochondrial, oxidized-DNA (OH-DNA) and potentially RNA can be released
  in aberrant amounts during obesity by dying adipocytes, NASH hepatocytes, or NETosis.
  Self-NA can activate cytosolic or endolysosomal pathogen recognition receptors in
  macrophages or dendritic cells such as Toll-Like-Receptor 3/7/9, cGAS-STING pathway,
  AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes. Their activation induces in situ production of i)
  proinflammatory cytokines (IL6, TNF-α…) through the activation of NF-ΚB, ii) type
  I interferon through the transcription factors IRF3/7, and iii) IL1-β, through the
  caspase 1 activation, all of which contribute directly to obesity mediated-metaflammation.
