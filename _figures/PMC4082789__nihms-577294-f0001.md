caption: a, Proposed BexX-catalyzed 2-thiosugar formation. The active site lysine
  residue (K110), of BexX initially forms an imine bond with G6P (3) at the C1 position,
  which is isomerized first to a C1–C2 enamine and then a C2-ketone intermediate (4).
  Subsequent nucleophilic attack by a sulphur donor occurs at the C2 position of 4
  to incorporate a sulphur atom in the 2SG6P (5) product. b, ThiG-catalyzed thiazole
  phosphate biosynthetic pathway. c, Stereo diagram of BexX active site. Active site
  side chains and Lys110-G6P intermediate are depicted as sticks with the carbon atoms
  of residues colored in green and purple, respectively. The Fo-Fc simulated annealing
  (SA)-omit map of Lys110-G6P intermediate contoured at 4 sigma is shown in gray.
  Water molecules are shown as red spheres. The carbon atoms of G6P are numbered from
  C1 to C6.
