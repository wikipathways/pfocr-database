caption: Origins and intracellular sensors of self-nucleic acids promoting the IFN-I
  signaling pathway. During cellular stress, self-derived nucleic acids (DNA or RNA)
  are released from damaged mitochondria and the nucleus, consequently accumulating
  in the cytosol. In addition, extracellular nucleic acids liberated from neighboring
  dying or damaged cells are internalized by endocytosis. These intracellular (cytosolic
  or endosomal) nucleic acids are recognized by diverse intracellular nucleic acid
  sensors, triggering the activation of the signaling pathways that produce IFN-I
  and proinflammatory cytokines. Specifically, sensors for endosomal nucleic acids
  include TLR3 (for double-stranded DNA), TLR7 (for single-stranded RNA), and TLR9
  (for single-stranded DNA). Cytosolic double-stranded RNA is detected by RIG-I or
  MDA5, while cytosolic double-stranded DNA is recognized by members of the cGAS-STING
  pathway. Activation of these intracellular nucleic acid sensors stimulates TBK1
  activation, prompting the translocation of IRFs and NF-kB into the nucleus. There,
  they orchestrate the expression of IFN-I and proinflammatory cytokine genes. Subsequently,
  binding of IFN-I to IFNAR1/IFNAR2 triggers the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway,
  culminating in the induction of ISGs. This cascade of events illustrates the intricate
  molecular mechanisms involved in the recognition of self-nucleic acids, the subsequent
  activation of signaling pathways leading to the expression and secretion of IFN-I
  and proinflammatory cytokines, and the subsequent induction of ISGs via the JAK-STAT
  pathway. This figure was created with BioRender.com. IFN-I, type I interferons;
