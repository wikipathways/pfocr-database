caption: NAA as a selective, alternative cytoplasmic and nuclear acetyl-CoA source.
  Reduced citrate synthase activity in cancer cells may result in increased NAA synthesis
  and export from mitochondria. Citrate (red pathway) and NAA (blue pathway) are synthesized
  from acetyl-CoA in cancer cell mitochondria. Both citrate and NAA are exported from
  mitochondria to the cytoplasm. The transporter that moves NAA out of the mitochondrial
  matrix is not known, but the most likely candidate is the dicarboxylate transporter
  (DIC). Citrate is converted in the cytoplasm into acetyl-CoA, which can then be
  used for lipid synthesis as well as protein acetylation reactions in the cytoplasm
  and nucleus. NAA represents an alternative pathway that may allow for transport
  of acetate groups out of mitochondria, especially under hypoxic conditions when
  citrate synthase activity is reduced. The portion of the citric acid cycle between
  citrate and alpha ketoglutarate is reduced (gray lines), and the enzyme aspartate
  aminotransferase supplies alpha-ketoglutarate from glutamine via glutamate (glutaminolysis).
  After synthesis, NAA is transported to the cytoplasm and is converted to acetate
  and aspartate by ASPA. Subsequently, acetate plus CoA are converted to acetyl-CoA
  by ACSS2. This may represent a salvage pathway for delivering acetyl-CoA from cancer
  cell mitochondria under hypoxic conditions, when citric acid cycle and citrate synthase
  activities are reduced. Additionally, ACSS2 provides for a pathway to specific transcription
  factor acetylation by its selective complex formation with certain transcription
  factor complexes such as hypoxia inducible factor 2α (). AAT, aspartate aminotransferase;
  ACSS2, acyl coenzyme A synthetase short-chain family member 2; ACLY, ATP-citrate
  lyase; ASPA, aspartoacylase; CS, citrate synthase; CIC, citrate carrier; DIC, dicarboxylate
  transporter (SCL25A10); IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  and NAT8L, aspartate N-acetyltransferase (aka NAA synthase).
