caption: The role of BPs in the macrophage polarization. BPs increase M1 macrophages
  polarization by activating the TLR-4 signaling pathway and its downstream NF-κB
  signaling pathway. The polarization of M2 macrophages was suppressed due to the
  activation of the TLR-4 signaling pathway. BPs enhance LPS-induced M1 macrophages
  through NLRP3 inflammasome activation but have no effect on the differentiation
  of M2 macrophages in IL-4-treated human macrophages. The enhanced IL-17 can promote
  the polarization of M1 macrophages by activation of the STAT-1 signal pathway but
  inhibit M2 macrophages polarization by affecting IL-4-mediated activation of the
  STAT-6 signal pathway.
