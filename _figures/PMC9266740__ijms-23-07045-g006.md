caption: Differentially expressed genes in phenylpropane biosynthesis pathway including
  lignin biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis. DEGs under normal conditions are
  shown in black. DEGs under PEG6000 treatment are shown in blue. DEGs under both
  conditions are shown in red. The three initial steps of phenylpropane metabolic
  pathway were catalyzed by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4−hydroxylase
  (C4H) and 4−coumarate−CoA ligase (4CL). The flavonoid biosynthesis was catalyzed
  by chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3−hydroxylase (F3H),
  flavonoid 3′−hydroxylase (F′3H), flavone synthase II (CYP93G1), dihydroflavonol
  4−reductase (DFR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS/LDOX) and anthocyanidin reductase
  (ANR). The lignin biosynthesis was catalyzed by shikimate O−hydroxycinnamoyltransferase
  (HCT), 5−O−(4−coumaroyl)−D−quinate 3′−monooxygenase (C3′H), cinnamoyl−CoA reductase
  (CCR), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and peroxidase (POD).
