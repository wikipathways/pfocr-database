caption: (a) Anti-BMPs (such as Chordin and Noggin) prevent BMPs from binding to their
  receptor complex; Smad1 remains inactive; neural identity is induced. (b) Binding
  of a ligand to a BMP receptor complex results in transphosphorylation of the BMP
  type I receptor by the BMP type II receptor and the subsequent phosphorylation of
  Smad1 in its carboxy-terminal MH2 domain; this activated Smad1 forms a complex with
  co-Smads, translocates to the nucleus and blocks neural identity. (c) Activation
  of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by FGF (or by hepatocyte
  growth factor (HGF) or insulin-like growth factor (IGF)) signalling results in phosphorylation
  of Smad1 in its linker region (yellow); this phosphorylation blocks the anti-neuralizing
  effect of activated Smad1. (d) Phosphorylation in its linker region primes Smad1
  for phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3); doubly phosphorylated
  Smad1 is then targeted for degradation in the proteasome.
