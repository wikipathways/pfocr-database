caption: Glucagon effects on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. Activation of glucagon
  receptor by glucagon in hepatocyte stimulates adenylate cyclase-/cAMP-/PKA-dependent
  phosphorylation of Creb and dephosphorylation/nuclear translocation of Crtc2. p-Creb
  induces transcription of gluconeogenic genes G6Pase and Pck1. PKA activates phosphorylase
  synthase and inhibits glycogen synthase, thus stimulating glycogen breakdown. In
  addition, PKA activates FBPase2 and inhibits PFK-1 and pyruvate kinase, thereby
  enhancing gluconeogenesis and inhibiting glycolysis. By AC dependent inhibition
  of SIK2, glucagon stimulates activation of p300, which facilitates transcription
  of gluconeogenic genes. p-CREB induces transcription of Ppar-α that enhances transcription
  of β-oxidation genes Cpt1 and Mcad. ATP to cAMP conversion leads to enhanced AMP/ATP
  ratio leading to AMPK activation and inhibition of ACC. This results in inhibiting
  the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA by ACC and subsequent decreases the
  lipid synthesis pathway. As a consequence malonyl-CoA formation is reduced which
  induces an accumulation of Cpt1. Cpt1 enhances fatty acyl-CoA transport into mitochondria
  and induces β-oxidation. In addition, glucagon stimulates AMPK and mitochondrial
  IP3R1 further activating β-oxidation. Acetyl-CoA subsequently enters Krebs cycle
  for ketone body formation during prolonged starvation. Abbreviations, AC, adenylyl
  cyclase; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; Creb, cAMP-responsive

    p-Creb induces transcription of gluconeogenic genes G6Pase and Pck1. PKA activates

    This results in inhibiting the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA by ACC
