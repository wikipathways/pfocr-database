caption: Other media for activating STING. (a) IFI16 and IFI204 are also involved
  in the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, which enhances the ability of cGAS to bind
  DNA and is required for STING activation as a means to enhance IRF3 and NF-κB activation.
  In turn, there is also negative feedback regulation between IFI16 and cGAS-STING,
  i.e., excess product IFN promotes ubiquitinated degradation of IFI16 by the proteasome.
  Finally, IFI16 also promotes the activation of p53 and p-RB, which leads to the
  production of SASP, resulting in cellular senescence. (b) As a mediator of DSB repair,
  DNA-PK activates STING but inhibits cGAS, resulting in DNA-PK-STING-IRF3 activation.
