caption: 'Apoptosis: Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand
  (TRAIL) initiates cell death through two mechanisms: direct caspase activation or
  indirect activation via the release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria. TRAIL-induced
  apoptosis is mediated by the TRAIL receptors, DR4 and DR5. These receptors recruit
  adaptor proteins such as Fas-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD) and apical
  procaspases like procaspase-8 through death domain (DD) interaction. Together, these
  components form the Death Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC), which triggers the
  activation and release of apical caspases. The activated apical caspases then initiate
  two main pathways of cell death. In the extrinsic pathway, caspase-8 directly activates
  effector caspase-3, leading to apoptosis. Alternatively, the death receptor pathway
  (FAS) can activate the intrinsic pathway involving mitochondria. In this pathway,
  changes in the mitochondrial membranes cause the release of apoptogenic factors
  such as cytochrome c. Once in the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to the caspase-activating
  protein Apaf1, which then binds to procaspase-9, forming the apoptosome and inducing
  the processing and activation of caspase-9. This activated caspase-9 can then cooperate
  with caspase-8 in the processing and activation of caspase-3, ultimately resulting
  in cell death'
