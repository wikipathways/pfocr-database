caption: Visualization of several parts of different pathway layouts of the iAF1260
  model. A simulation comparison of the wild-type simulation and a mutant that produces
  glycine, was performed, which allows the visualization of fluxes differences in
  both simulations. A part of central metabolism pathway, showing the inactivation
  of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (R_PPC); B another component of the central
  metabolism pathway showing the inactivation of the isocitrate lyase (R_ICL); C part
  of the alternate carbon souirces pathway that clearly shows an increase in flux
  for the mutant simulation. D part of the co-factor biosynthesis pathway showing
  the inactivation of the glycine cleavage (R_GLYCL); E and F parts of the nucleotide
  metabolism pathway and inactivation of the phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase
  2 (R_GART).
