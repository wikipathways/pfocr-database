caption: Schematic model showing action of a pro-electrophilic drugs (PEDs) in activating
  the Nrf2 transcriptional pathway. In this case the PED Carnosic Acid (CA) is activated
  by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the active quinone form. This activated form
  of the drug reacts with a critical thiol (-SH) group on the cytoplasmic protein
  Keap1, which releases the transcription factor Nrf2. Nrf2 then is free to enter
  the nucleus where it transcriptionally activates a series of endogenous, neuroprotective
  antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proteins known as phase 2 enzymes
