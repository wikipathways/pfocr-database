caption: Results of significant canonical pathways associated with ion-transport and
  the molecules involved. (a) Calcium Transport- I pathway. (b) cAMP-mediated signaling
  pathway. (c) Cardiac-β-adrenergic signaling pathway. The canonical pathways were
  analyzed using QIAGEN’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; QIAGEN Inc, https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis).
  Differentially expressed genes in the layers were subjected to IPA analysis and
  significant canonical pathways were identified at P-value < 0.05. Above identified
  canonical pathways demonstrate how the candidate molecules (genes) are involved
  in ion-transport.
