caption: Graphical representation of cellular mechanisms underlying nonthermal plasma
  in a brain tumor to inhibit its growth and increase cell apoptosis. The PI3K signaling
  pathway promoting cell survival and growth is involved in the apoptosis of the central
  nervous system. AKT or PKB is a primary protein effector downstream of the PI3K
  signaling pathway. ERK plays an important role in the growth mechanism by regulating
  the PI3K/AKT pathway. ROS produced by nonthermal plasma are also involved in the
  pathophysiological process of apoptosis in brain tumors. The effect of p53 on caspase
  regulation depends on the mitochondrial mechanism. Thus, Bax stimulates the release
  of cytochrome c and activation of caspase signaling, thereby increasing cell apoptosis
  and cell death.
