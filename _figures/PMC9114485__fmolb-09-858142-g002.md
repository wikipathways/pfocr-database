caption: 'Pathways producing NADPH. Cells contain three subcellular pools of NADPH.
  In the cytosol, NADPH is produced by G6PD, the rate limiting step of the pentose
  phosphate pathway, as well as IDH1 and ME1, which are isozymes associated with the
  TCA cycle. In the mitochondria, NADPH is produced by IDH2, a TCA cycle isozyme,
  and two enzymes associated with one carbon (1C) metabolism: ALDH2L1 and MTHFD2.
  IDH1, IDH2, and MTHFD2 can proceed in the reverse direction, consuming NADPH in
  the process. MTHFD2 can also use NAD+ as a cofactor and generate NADH. In the ER,
  H6PD—a homolog of G6PD—generates NADPH from glucose-6-phosphate. The relative contribution
  of each pathway varies by cell type, and there is evidence of crosstalk between
  NADPH-producing enzymes to maintain optimal NADPH levels.'
