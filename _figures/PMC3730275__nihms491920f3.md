caption: Truncation mutations in CSF3R (the receptor for G-CSF) result in increased
  expression levels. Downstream signaling mediators — SRC family kinases (SFKs) and
  TNK2 — are preferentially activated by these truncation mutations. Consequently,
  leukemic cells harboring the mutations are highly sensitive to dasatinib. Truncation
  mutations in CSF3R may also show sensitivity to JAK kinase inhibitors in the context
  of JAK kinase stimulation downstream of high ligand concentrations. In contrast,
  membrane proximal mutations in CSF3R show completely ligand-independent function.
  In this capacity, the dominant mode of signaling appears to operate through the
  JAK-STAT pathway. Thus, patients with membrane proximal mutations may be candidates
  for treatment with JAK kinase inhibitors, such as the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib.
