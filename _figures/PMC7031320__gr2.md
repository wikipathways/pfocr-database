caption: Examples of the pathway split which will converge to the same product downstream.
  (a) The formation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) from mevalonate 5-phosphate (MVAP)
  through mevalonate 5-diphosphate (MVAPP) or isopentenyl phosphate (IP) in the mevalonic
  acid (MVA) pathway (). (b) The formation of feruloyl-CoA from caffeic acid through
  caffeoyl-CoA or ferulic acid in the phenylpropanoid pathway (). (c) The formation
  of ajmaline from acetylnorajmaline through norajmaline or acetylajmaline in the
  monoterpenoid indole alkaloids biosynthetic pathway ().
