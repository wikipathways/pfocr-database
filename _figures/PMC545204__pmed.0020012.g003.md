caption: (A) In the absence of RA, RARα/RXR heterodimers recruit the transcription
  corepressor (CoR), which mediates transcriptional silencing by mechanisms that include
  direct inhibition of the basal transcription machinery and recruitment of chromatin-modifying
  enzymes. Chromatin modification includes histone deacetylation, which leads to a
  compact chromatin structure that impairs the access of transcriptional activators.
  In the presence of physiological concentrations (10−9–10−8 M) of RA, the transcription
  corepressor is released and the coactivator is recruited to the RARα/RXR heterodimer,
  resulting in histone acetylation (AC) and overcoming of the transcription blockage.(B)
  PML-RARα fusion protein binds to RARα target genes either on its own or with RXR
  and then recruits corepressors, leading to transcriptional repression and myeloid
  differentiation inhibition. PML-RARα oncoprotein sequesters the normal RXR and PML,
  inhibits the PML/P53 apoptotic pathway, and delocalizes PML and other proteins from
  the nuclear body. PML-RARα also may affect interferon (IFN) and other signal pathways.
  Abnormalities in protein tyrosine kinases (e.g., FLT3, c-fms) may collaborate with
  PML-RARα to cause APL.(C) In the presence of pharmacological doses of ATRA or arsenic
  trioxide, the PML-RARα fusion is degraded in ways that are dependent on caspases
  and proteasomes. The degradation of PML-RARα may lead to derepression of transcription
  suppression and restoration of PML nuclear body structure. The blockade of other
  signaling pathways is also released, and the anti-apoptotic effect of PML-RARα is
  lost. ATRA also induces cyclic AMP (cAMP), which reverses the silencing of RXR,
  induces the expression of RA-induced genes and cyclooxygenase 1 (Cox 1), inhibits
  angiogenesis, and downregulates tissue factor. Subsequently, ATRA induces terminal
  cell differentiation, while arsenic trioxide induces partial differentiation and/or
  apoptosis of APL cells. The effects of ATRA and arsenic trioxide are indicated with
  red and blue arrows, respectively. AF2, the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation
  domain contained within the C-terminal E domain of RARα; D522, aspartate at residue
  522; K160, lysine at residue 160; K490, lysine at residue 490; RARE, retinoic acid
  response element; SUG-1, a component of proteasome 19S complex that can bind with
  the activated AF2 domain of RARα.
