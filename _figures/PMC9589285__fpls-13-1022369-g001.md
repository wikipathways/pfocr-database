caption: Schematic representation of TFs with a role in different strawberry ripening-related
  processes. (A) Hormone biosynthesis and signaling are regulated by complex GNRs
  that govern the switch from the development stages, in which auxin (AUX) and gibberellic
  acid (GA) promote cell fruit division and expansion, to the ripening stages, which
  are mainly regulated by abscisic acid (ABA). (B) Regulation of the phenylpropanoid
  pathway by TFs that control metabolic fluxes and modulate different branches of
  the pathway, such as the lignin, proanthocyanidin or anthocyanin pathways. (C) TFs
  involved in the regulation of sugar metabolism (SPS, SUS and INV) and transport
  (SUT). (D) TFs controlling the biosynthesis of volatile compounds, mainly esters,
  as well as furaneol and eugenol. (E) TFs regulating cell wall modification, and
  therefore fruit softening during ripening. Blue rounded rectangles indicate TFs.
  Green arrows and red block symbols denote positive and negative regulation respectively.
