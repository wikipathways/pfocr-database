caption: A hypothetical diagram illustrates potential mechanisms in silicosis. Silica
  may lead to apoptosis via increasing the formation of autophagosomes in AMs. LPS
  regulates the formation of autophagosomes through a blockade of the MTOR signaling
  pathway and activation of MYD88, TICAM1 and BECN1 signaling pathways. However, silica
  engulfment results in lysosomal rupture, which may lead to the accumulation of autophagosomes.
  The excessive accumulation of autophagosomes may lead to apoptosis in AMs. Thus
  LPS or other substances that can activate autophagy may be risk factors for silicosis.
