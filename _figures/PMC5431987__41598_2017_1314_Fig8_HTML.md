caption: 'Material and methods workflow diagram. The workflow starts with the data
  acquisition block which gathers level three breast invasive cancer gene expression
  raw counts for tumour and normal datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Complementary
  annotation data are obtained from BioMart (Chromosome, %GC content, Entrez Gene
  IDs, and HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee - HGNC - symbols). Then, the pre-processing
  block integrates both expression and annotation data necessary for quality control,
  such as bias detection (e.g. %GC content, gene length, etc.), within/between normalization
  and multidimensional principal component (PC) analysis noise reduction. After that,
  the processing block diverges into two complementary analyses: i) Differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) discovery is carried out to find potential candidate genes
  between cases and controls; ii) Two whole genome-genome mutual information density
  distributions are built for each condition in order to construct similar networks
  and visualized with Cytoscape. Both DEGs and networks results are then submitted
  to functional analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Finally, result exploration
  integrates PubMed literature together with functional results to obtain biological
  insight of the problem at hand.'
