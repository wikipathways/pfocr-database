caption: 'Chemotactic Signaling Cascades. The leading edge of a migratory cell (right
  side) responds to chemotactic molecules initiating intracellular signaling that
  culminates in F-actin polymerization to protrude the cell towards the source. The
  trailing edge of the cell (left side) responds with myosin contraction pulling the
  cell off the substrate with PIP3-phosphatases (PTEN) dephosphorylating PIP3 to PIP2.
  (A) TorC2 pathway (PI3K independent): A chemotactic ligand binds to the GPCR activating
  an intermediate G-protein and subsequently the Tor Complex 2 (TorC2). The complex
  then phosphorylates protein kinase B related kinase (PKBR1) at the membrane leading
  to phosphorylation of several cytoskeletal proteins including TalinB. (B) The PIP3/PI3K
  pathway: A chemotactic ligand binds to the GPCR leading to recruitment of PI3K to
  the membrane. PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3, PIP3 then activates Rac initiating
  F-actin polymerization. The F-actin polymerization stimulates additional recruitment
  of PIP3 and Rac creating a positive feedback loop at the cell’s leading edge.'
