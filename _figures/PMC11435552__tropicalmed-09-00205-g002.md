caption: Model for DBV and GTV suppressing the IFN antiviral system by NS sequestration
  of key signaling molecules into IBs or FSs. After Dabie bandavirus (DBV) invades
  the host cells, TRIM25, tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), Ikkε, IFN regulatory factor
  7 (IRF7), and STAT2, which are involved in the IFN signaling pathway, interact with
  DBV NSs and are captured into inclusion bodies (IBs), thereby inhibiting the IFN
  signaling pathway. TRIM25 is isolated to the viral IBs to inhibit TRIM25-mediated
  retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG-I)-Ly-63-linked ubiquitination or activation.
  Reduction in intracellular free TBK1 and IKKε interferes with TBK1/IKKε- IFN regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3)/IRF7 signaling. DBV NSs prevent the nuclear translocation of IRF7
  by sequestering it to IBs. The phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT2
  are inhibited by IBs, which block type I IFN-stimulated JAK-STAT signaling. STAT1
  may be tethered to the viral IBs that block its nuclear translocation, resulting
  in the inhibition of IFN signaling and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression. Likewise,
  NSs of Guertu virus (GTV) hijack TBK1 and STAT2 into IBs and filamentous structures
  (FSs) affecting the corresponding signal transduction
