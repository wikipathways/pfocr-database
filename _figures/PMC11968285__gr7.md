caption: A model of SONFH reveals that BMSC Piezo1 in response to elevated IOP regulates
  bone vascular homeostasis through CAM-NFAT1 signaling pathway. (A) During the development
  of SONFH, Piezo1 can respond to the increased intraosseous pressure and promote
  the osteogenesis and vascular potential of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells through
  the CAM-NFAT1 signaling pathway in the early stage. (B) Early inhibition of stem
  cell Piezo1 by injection of GsMTx4 can aggravate the increase in intraosseous pressure
  and the progression of SONFH through Piezo1-CAM-NFAT1 signaling pathway. Created
