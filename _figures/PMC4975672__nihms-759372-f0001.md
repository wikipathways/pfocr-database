caption: Direct Activation – CAR is sequestered in a cytoplasmic complex containing
  HSP90 and CCRP. Upon ligand binding, these chaperones dissociate and CAR translocates
  to the nucleus where it heterodimerizes with RXR, recruits coactivators GRIP1 and
  SRC1, and binds to its response element to initiate gene transcription. Indirect
  Activation – When sequestered in the cytoplasm, the Thr38 residue of CAR is phosphorylated
  by PKC, and dephosphorylation of this residue for CAR activation can be inhibited
  by ERK1/2 upon activation of the EGFR signaling pathway. When a PB-like compound
  binds to the EGFR receptor and inhibits EGF-mediated signaling, RACK1 is dephosphorylated
  at Tyr52 and recruits PP2A to the CAR protein complex, where it dephosphorylates
  the Thr38 residue and induces CAR nuclear translocation and activation.
