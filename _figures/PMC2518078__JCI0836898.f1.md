caption: Growth factor and other survival signals are transduced through receptor
  tyrosine kinases via adaptor proteins (such as GRB2 and the guanine-nucleotide exchange
  factor SOS) and activate Ras and its downstream targets, Raf and MEK1/2, which results
  in the activation of ERK1/2. ERK1/2 activation leads to perturbations in downstream
  targets that promote survival, i.e., downregulation of Bim and Bad and upregulation
  of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1). Growth factor survival signaling proceeds
  through the PI3K pathway, a process that is amplified in cells deficient in the
  PTEN phosphatase. PI3K activates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 1 (PDK1)
  and AKT, which either directly or indirectly (i.e, via forkhead box O [FOXO]) inactivate
  proapoptotic molecules such as Bim and Bad. AKT also activates mTORC1/regulatory-associated
  protein of mTOR (RAPTOR) by relieving it of the inhibitory influence of the tuberous
  sclerosis 1/2 (TSC1/2) complex. It is postulated that pharmacologic inhibition of
  mTOR (e.g., by rapamycin or RAD001) leads, via an S6K1- and PI3K-dependent process,
  to activation of Ras and MEK/ERK, which promotes cell survival in the face of mTOR
  inhibition. Inhibition of mTOR may also provoke an autophagic response. Conversely,
  interruption of the MAPK pathway (i.e., by MEK1/2 inhibitors such as PD0325901)
  in the setting of mTOR inhibition promotes cell death through a Bim-dependent mechanism.
