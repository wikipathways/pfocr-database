caption: The ligand (DBL-1) binds to the type I and type II receptors (SMA-6 and DAF-4,
  respectively), stimulating phosphorylation events on the receptors and on the R-Smads.
  The two R-Smads of this pathway, SMA-2 and SMA-3, associate with SMA-4, the co-Smad,
  and translocate to the nucleus. One characterized transcription factor, SMA-9 (SCHNURRI),
  aids in transcription of downstream target genes. The putative I-Smad, TAG-68, is
  the only I-Smad homolog in C. elegans. It is hypothesized to function similarly
  to the mammalian I-Smads (Smad6 and Smad7) and would therefore be a target of the
  pathway and attenuate signaling by interacting with the receptor and/or R-Smads
  [].
