caption: Summary of the Notch pathway. Notch signaling is initiated when a transmembrane
  Notch receptor (Notch1-4) on one cell is activated by a neighboring cell’s ligand
  (Delta, Jagged/Serrate), prompting proteolytic cleavage events by ADAM and γ-secretase
  to release the Notch receptor’s intracellular domain (NICD). Inside the cell, NICD
  translocates into the nucleus to form a transcriptional complex with a number of
  co-activators to in turn activate the expression of genes, including the Hes and
  Hey families. The miRNA miR-9 regulates several members of this pathway.
