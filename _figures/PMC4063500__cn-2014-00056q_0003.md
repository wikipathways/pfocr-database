caption: 'Lithium’s autophagy regulation mechanism in various neuropsychiatric diseases.
  Signaling pathways involved in the regulation of autophagy of lithium In the mTOR
  independent pathway, lithium inhibits GSK3β as well as IMPase. The activity of GSK3β
  is downregulated by phosphorylation on Ser9 residue, and conversely, phosphorylation
  on Tyr216 upregulates GSK3β activity. GSK3β inhibition resulted in an elevation
  of Bif-1 which interacted with beclin-1-VPS complex and induced autophagy. AMPK
  can affect GSK3β activity and is also upregulated by GSK3β. Under serum deprivation
  conditions, GSK3 activates TIP60 and stimulates ULK1. In nutrient-rich condition,
  mTOR suppresses the ULK1 (Atg1 homologue) complex under. Upon autophagy induction,
  the ULK1 complex (including ULK1, Atg13, FIP200, and Atg101) is activated and translocated
  to a certain domain of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the ER, the ULK1 complex
  regulates the class III phosphatidyl inositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase complex (including
  Beclin 1, Atg14(L)/bakor, Vps15, Vps34, and Ambra 1). Abbreviations: IMPase, inositol
  monophosphatase; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate;
  mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; TIP60,
  HIV-Tat interactive protein, 60 kDa; Bif-1, bax interacting factor 1; PS9, phosphorylation
  at Ser9; PY216, phosphorylation at Tyr216.'
