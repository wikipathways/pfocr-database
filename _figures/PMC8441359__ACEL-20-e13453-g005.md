caption: NLRP3 inflammasome priming and activation. The priming signaling occurs by
  the activation of cytokines, damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), or pathogen‐associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs), leading to the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor
  (NF)‐κB and upregulation of inflammasome components and cytokines (IL‐1β and IL‐18).
  Priming signals activate a complex cascade of events including potassium (K+) efflux,
  endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondrial stress (Activation signaling). Activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex involves NLRP3 oligomerization, ASC polymerization,
  and recruitment of pro‐caspase‐1. Active NLRP3 inflammasome complex and pro‐caspase‐1 cleave
  pro‐IL‐1β and pro‐IL‐18 into the active forms, IL‐1β and pro‐IL‐18. Gasdermin D
  (GSDMD) is also cleaved (GSDMDNterm) forming pores and inducing pyroptosis. Cleavage
  of GSDMD also occurs via the non‐canonical pyroptosis pathway upon activation of
  caspases‐4/‐5/‐11 by cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ASC, apoptosis‐associated
  speck‐like protein containing a CARD; GSDMDNterm, GSDMD amino‐terminal cell death
