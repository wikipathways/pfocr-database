caption: The calcineurin pathway controls unisexual reproduction, stress responses,
  and virulence in C. deneoformans. Calcineurin Cna1/Cnb1 functions as the central
  hub in the calcineurin pathway. During unisexual reproduction, calcineurin regulates
  the yeast–hyphal morphological transition through Cbp1 and Cts1, and via a pathway
  in which Cbp1 synergistically interacts with Pbp1, whereas Cts1 inhibits the pheromone
  response pathway. Crz1 and Puf4 are required for sporulation. In response to different
  environmental stresses, Crz1 synergistically interacts with other calcineurin downstream
  targets via complex branched pathways. Finally, Pbp1 and Tif3 are key virulence
  factors downstream of calcineurin in C. neoformans.
