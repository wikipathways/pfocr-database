caption: A model depicting pyrvinium’s dual mechanism of CK1α activation. In response
  to Wnt pathway activation, CRBN binds to CK1α in the IMiD binding pocket and induces
  CK1α degradation. However, upon binding by pyrvinium, CK1α undergoes allosteric
  regulation, which inhibits its Wnt-dependent association with CRBN and consequently
  blocks its degradation. This modulation also leads to the stimulation of CK1α kinase
  activity, albeit independently of CK1α stabilization. CRBN, Cereblon; IMiD, immunomodulatory
  drug.
