caption: 'Azithromycin action pathway. (A) Azithromycin targets the protein synthesis
  of bacteria by binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome near the polypeptide
  exit tunnel. Efflux pumps, such as MtrCDE protect N. gonorrhoeae from antimicrobials.
  (B) The ribosome nascent chain tunnel environment in Staphylococcus aureus. Left:
  The 70S S. aureus (SA_WT) ribosome where the large subunit is shown in light gray
  and the small subunit is shown in dark gray (PDBID 5TCU). The A-site, P-site, and
  E-site docked tRNA molecules (from PDBID 5JTE) are shown in blue, green, and magenta,
  respectively. The surface of a nascent chain within the peptide exit tunnel is shown
  in yellow. Bound macrolide (erythromycin) is shown in red, uL4, uL22, uL23, and
  uL24 are shown in brown, orange, teal, and khaki, respectively. Right: zoom into
  the macrolide binding site at the upper tunnel. Figure reproduced with permission
