caption: T cell receptor (TCR) signaling regulates ROS production by inducing distinct
  pathways, including phosphorylation of MAPKs cascade, activation of the proximal
  Duox1 and increase in protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase.
  Co-stimulatory signaling through CD28 activates the PI3K pathway, which generates
  ROS in the conversion of arachidonic acid intermediates. Moderate levels of superoxide
  radical (O2•−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) enhance IL-2 transcription, through
  NFAT nuclear localization, promoting T cell proliferation and activation. ROS induce
  Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus to regulate antioxidant response element (ARE)-dependent
  genes. Excessive ROS production results in activation-induced cell death (AICD)
  or ferroptosis.
