caption: 'Response timescales in the chemotactic pathway. (A) Schematic of a chemotactic
  trajectory: the bacterium swims straight during runs (lines with arrows), and randomly
  changes direction during tumbles (solid circles), resulting in a three-dimensional
  random walk. The mean run time under adapted conditions is ∼1 s (). (B) Schematic
  of the timescales involved in the initial (preadaptation) response to saturating
  attractant. The longest timescale corresponds to CheY-P dephosphorylation by CheZ
  (): it is much longer than receptor switching (), motor switching (), and unbinding
  of CheY-P from FliM (see main text), and slightly longer than CheY-P diffusion ().'
