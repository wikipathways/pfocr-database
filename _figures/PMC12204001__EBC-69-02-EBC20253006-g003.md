caption: In high CIN tumors, persistent cGAS-STING activation drives inflammation-driven
  carcinogenesis. STING activation in tumor cells promotes immune-suppressive cytokines
  production, such as IL-10 and TGF-β, inhibiting T and NK cell function while promoting
  Treg accumulation. It also triggers pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, TNF-α,
  and IL-6, supporting immune evasion and tumor proliferation. Additionally, aberrant
  activation up-regulates PD-L1 in tumors and PD-1 in T cells, enhancing immune escape
  and metastasis. STING activation promotes the proliferation of Breg and secreted
  inflammatory factors such as IL-35 and IL-10, further inhibiting NK cells. Chronic
  inflammation reprograms TAMs into the protumor M2 phenotype, fostering tumor growth
  and immune suppression. Fibroblasts deposit ECM components to form a barrier that
  impedes immune cell infiltration and supports immune evasion. To counteract these
  effects, strategies include combining STING agonists with immune checkpoint blockades
  (ICBs), using NSAIDs to reduce inflammation, reprogramming TAMs from M2 to M1 with
  CSF-1R inhibitors or anti-CD40 antibodies, and employing small-molecule inhibitors
  to regulate cGAS-STING activity. Nanoparticle or liposome-based STING agonist delivery
  can enhance tumor targeting and efficacy. Created with Figdraw. cGAS-STING, cyclic
  GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes; CIN, chromosomal instability; ECM,
  extracellular matrix; NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
