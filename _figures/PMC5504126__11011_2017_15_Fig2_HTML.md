caption: 'Cholesterol synthesis and metabolism in astrocytes and neurons. Cholesterol
  is biosynthesized in astrocytes via Bloch pathway, while in neurons via Kandutsch-Russell
  pathway. In both pathways, Acetyl-CoA is converted to LA and definitively transformed
  to cholesterol, but they differ in level of the cholesterol precursors: while DE
  is the main precursor in astrocytes, as LA, LT and 7D are present mainly in neurons.
  Synthesized in astrocytes APOE is secreted in the form of APOE-containing cholesterol
  by the ABC transporter and absorbed by neurons via the LRP1/LDLR receptors by endocytosis.
  The excess cholesterol is converted into 24S–OHC by Cyp46A1 in order to excrete
  it across BBB and BCSFB to the circulation. It can also be released by the ABC transporter
  or utilized for the formation of new cellular membranes and microdomains as the
  lipid rafts. Alternatively, small amount of cholesterol can also be taken up as
  27-OHC from the circulation into the brain. Abbreviations: 7D 7-dehydrocholesterol,
