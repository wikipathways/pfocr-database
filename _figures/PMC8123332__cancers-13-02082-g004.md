caption: Model of the role of PRKCA in tumorigenesis and progression. Activation of
  PRKCA is known to elicit downstream tumor-promoting effects via the MAPK/Erk and
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in several cancer types [,,,,]. Both pathways are known
  to promote cell growth, proliferation, migration and invasion. Additionally, MAPK/Erk
  also promotes angiogenesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), while
  dysregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway can lead to actin reorganization, improved
  cellular survival, and inhibition of apoptosis [,]. The tumor-initiating mechanism
  of PRKCA activation and overexpression is unknown.
