caption: NO and O2 involvement in different steps of the N-degron pathway in plants
  and implication of PGBs. The stability of N-degron substrates is controlled by NO/O2
  levels, whose balance is modulated by phytoglobins (PGBs). Under normoxia (1), these
  substrates are degraded by the action of different enzymes consecutively along the
  PCO branch. When plants suffer a hypoxic-related stress (2), this pathway becomes
  inhibited, triggering the transcriptional responses. During stress, PGBs play a
  key role, scavenging free NO (3), which in turn is able to modify PGBs post-translationally,
  to determine a finely tuned redox balance and energy status (created with BioRender.com).
