caption: Male FVB;129/Hemc mice that circle have altered brain biochemistry. (A) Male
  circling mice have significantly lower dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
  acid (DOPAC) concentrations compared with male mice with standard housing, all of
  which did not circle. (B) Male circling mice have significantly lower serotonin
  (5-HT) levels compared with male mice in standard housing. Arrows denote the metabolic
  pathway, with only intermediates measured by HPLC shown. Values that differ significantly
  (*, P < 0.05; †, P < 0.01) from those of mice in standard housing are indicated.
  The y axis displays total brain concentration, with tyrosine (TYR), and tryptophan
  (TRYP) as μg/g of tissue and the remaining compounds as ng/g of tissue. Data are
  given as mean ± SEM (error bars). 3-MT, 3-methoxytyramine; HVA, homovanillic acid;
  5-HIAA, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.
