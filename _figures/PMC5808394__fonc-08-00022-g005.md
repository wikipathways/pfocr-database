caption: 'Effect of ROS-mediated oxidization of PKM2 on cellular metabolism and redox
  balance. Cancer cells produce large amounts of ROS that oxidize the cysteine (C)
  358 residue of PKM2, which leads to the inhibition of PKM2 as well as a piling up
  of glycolytic intermediate glucose 6-phosphate which is then diverted into the PPP.
  The oxidative PPP facilitates the synthesis of NADPH + H+ which regenerates GSH
  thereby minimizing ROS-induced damages of the cancer cells. Abbreviations: ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate; GSH, glutathione; GSSG, glutathione disulfide; H2O2, hydrogen
  peroxide; ETC, electron transport chain; PKM2, M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase; PPP,
  pentose phosphate pathway.'
