caption: Schematic diagram showing possible points of convergence of intracellular
  signaling cascades that might lead to NE plus ATP-mediated synergism. 1, NE activates
  the α1 receptor, which is coupled to Gq/11-protein. Activation of the receptor triggers
  an exchange of GDP for GTP. The trimeric G-protein then dissociates into α and β/γ
  dimer. The GTP-bound form of the α and/or β/γ subunit then activates the PLC/IP3/PKC
  pathway.2, ATP binds to the P2X receptor resulting in the opening of a nonspecific
  ion channel. 3, Both of these events increase intracellular Ca2+. Activation of
  the IP3 branch of the PLC pathway releases intracellular Ca2+ from the endoplasmic
  reticulum. Activation of P2X receptors allows Ca2+ entry through the P2X channel.
  In addition, Na+ influx through the channel depolarizes the membrane, probably opening
  voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and further increasing Ca2+ influx. Thus, increased
  intracellular Ca2+ represents one major point of convergence. 4, The increase in
  intracellular Ca2+ increases the activity of kinases. Specifically, because PKC
  is Ca2+ dependent, higher internal Ca2+ levels increase the activity of PKC. Increases
  in PKC activity might lead to phosphorylation of the ATP-dependent P2X ion channel,
  leading to a higher open probability for the channel. 5, PKC and/or Ca2+/calmodulin
  may phosphorylate transcription factors, thereby inducing transcription of other
  transcription factors (such as immediate-early genes) or perhaps additional receptors.
  The observed delay of ∼40 min before the onset of the synergistic response as well
  as the inhibition of the synergism by actinomycin indicates that this final step
  is a requirement for synergism.PIP2, Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.
