caption: Oncogenic ras-induced senescence is mediated by sequential activation of
  the Raf- MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases (ERK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK)3/6-p38 pathways.
  Oncogenic ras initially activates the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. The persistent activation
  of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway leads to accumulation of ROS and DNA damage, which activate
  the stress-induced MKK3/6-p38 pathway. Unique among the p38 isoforms, the expression
  level of p38δ is stimulated by the AP-1 and Ets transcription factors, which are
  activated by the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in response to oncogenic ras. Three p38 isoforms,
  p38α, p38γ and p38δ, mediate OIS through differential mechanisms. p38α induces the
  transcription of p16INK4A by directly phosphorylating and activating the HBP1 transcription
  factor, and activates a downstream substrate kinase PRAK, which in turn activates
  p53 by phosphorylating p53 at Ser37. p38γ stimulates the activity of p53 by directly
  phosphorylating p53 at Ser33. Once activated, p53 induces the expression of its
  transcriptional target p21WAF1, which, together with p16INK4A, triggers senescence.
  p38δ mediates OIS through a p53- and p16INK4A-indepdent mechanism, possibly by regulating
  the activity of two DNA damage checkpoint kinases CHK1 and CHK2 and participating
  in ras-induced DNA damage responses.

  description: Oncogenic ras-induced senescence is mediated by sequential activation
