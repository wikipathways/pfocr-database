caption: 'Model. Caveolae lipid rafts are flask-shaped invaginations made up of caveolin
  (purple) and flotillin (blue) proteins that function by organizing signaling complexes
  in the plasma membrane. Proteins present in caveolae include AR45. Furthermore,
  AR45 proteins interact with Gαq and Gαo proteins, which are involved in modulating
  intracellular calcium levels. Gαq can increase intracellular calcium release via
  the PLC/IP3 pathway, whereas Gαo can inhibit intracellular calcium. PLC, phospholipase
  C, IP3: inositol trisphosphate.'
