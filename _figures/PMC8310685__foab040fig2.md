caption: 'Overview of the main metabolic pathways involved in the synthesis of higher
  alcohol, acetate esters and medium-chain fatty acid esters in S. pastorianus. The
  major biochemical pathways for the production of higher alcohols and esters from
  branched-chain and aromatic amino acids are shown. The enzymes required for each
  step are shown in purple. The triple arrows indicate that several steps are omitted.
  The higher alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, is produced from the degradation of the imported
  phenylalanine or the degradation of phenylpyruvate from the Shikimate pathway. Isoamyl
  alcohol is produced from the degradation of imported leucine or from the transformation
  of pyruvate in the mitochondria. The fatty acid esters ethyl hexanoate and ethyl
  octanoate are derived from transesterification of medium chain fatty acids. The
  major transporters for amino acids are shown as are the transporters for the major
  sugars found in wort. PEP: Phosphoenolpyruvate, E4P: Erythrose-4-Phosphate, DAHP:
  3- deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate, α-KIV: α-ketoisovalerate, α-IPM: α-isopropylmalate
  and α-KIC: α-ketoisocaproate.'
