caption: (A). STAT3-iNOS signaling regulates EGFRvIII-mediated glial transformation.
  In EGFRvIII-expressing astrocytes, endogenous STAT3 occupies the promoter of the
  iNOS gene to regulate its transcription. STAT3 induces the expression of a reporter
  gene driven by the iNOS promoter, and mutation of a conserved STAT3 binding site
  within the iNOS promoter blocks the STAT3-induced expression of the reporter gene.
  The downstream signaling mechanisms by which iNOS regulates tumorigenesis remain
  to be studied. Here, we propose upregulation of cytokines such as IL8 and COX2,
  or changes in cell cycle kinetics as potential mechanism by which iNOS may regulate
  tumorigenesis. (B) Pharmacological inhibition of iNOS pathway or knockdown (KD)
  of iNOS by RNA interference (RNAi) suppresses tumor growth in vivo. The selective
  iNOS inhibitors 1400W and S-MIU and the NO scavenger c-PTIO reduce the population
  growth of EGFRvIII-expressing astrocytes. Knockdown of iNOS by RNA interference
  (Si-RNA) also reduces the population growth of these cells. iNOS knockdown EGFRvIII-expressing
  astrocytes fail to produce tumors or produce much smaller tumors than control EGFRvIII-expressing
  astrocytes. iNOS inhibition may therefore have potential therapeutic value in the
  treatment of glioblastoma.
