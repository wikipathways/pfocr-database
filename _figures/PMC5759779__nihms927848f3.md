caption: Neuronal ATP can activate P2XRs on astrocytes to produce AA via phospholipase
  D 2 (PLD2)-mediated production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and subsequent metabolism
  by DAG lipase (DAGL). Cox1 can metabolize AA to produce PGE2 via prostaglandin H2
  (PGH2) and prostaglandin E synthase (PGES), triggering EP4R on pericytes and leading
  to pericyte relaxation. AA produced in astrocytes can also diffuse into pericytes
  and form 20-HETE via p450 leading to pericyte depolarization and contraction. Neuronal
  activity releases glutamate, which has been shown to activate astrocytic mGluRs,
  triggering an IP3–dependent increase in intracellular [Ca2+] leading to AA production
  via the PLA2 pathway. However, recent studies contradict this finding (indicated
  by dashed lines and question mark. Neurotransmitters adenosine, norepinephrine,
  and ATP have been demonstrated to alter pericyte contractile state. Specifically,
  adenosine binds A1 and A2 receptors (A1R, A2R) and activates KATP channels leading
  to hyperpolarization and relaxation. Also, activation of potassium channels including
  KCa and possibly KIR results in hyperpolarization of pericytes, decreasing Ca2+
  entry through voltage-gated channels. Neuronal release of NO, which in pericytes
  inhibits AA metabolism to 20-HETE, can lead to pericyte relaxation. However, the
  role of NO in capillary dilation has been questioned (indicated by dashed lines
  and question mark). Norepinephrine acts through α2-adrenergic receptors (α2AR) leading
  to increased intracellular [Ca2+], depolarization and contraction. ATP activation
  of the purinergic receptors P2XR or P2YR on pericytes induces depolarizing currents,
  and increases intracellular [Ca2+] and pericyte contraction. Additionally, neuronal-mediated
  large increases in extracellular [K+] activates VGCCs, resulting in pericyte intracellular
  [Ca2+] increases, depolarization and contraction. Furthermore, several vasoconstrictors,
  including endothelin-1 (ET-1), platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-BB), both
  secreted by vascular endothelial cells, or blood-derived insulin-like growth factor
  (IGF-1), act on their respective receptors (endothelin A receptors (ETAR), Pdgfrβ
  and IGFR-1) leading to depolarization of pericytes and Ca2+ entry into the cell.
  Endothelial-endothelial and pericyte-endothelial gap junctions allow fast and direct
  exchange of small molecules.
