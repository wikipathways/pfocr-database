caption: Polyamine synthesis pathway. Spermidine synthase and spermine synthase catalyze
  the addition of aminopropyl groups to putrescine and spermidine to synthesize spermidine
  and spermine, respectively. Aminopropyl groups are donated by decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine
  (dcSAM), which is converted from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) by the enzymatic activities
  of adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC).
