caption: Currently known FAD, PLP, ThPP, FMN, and heme-dependent enzymatic reactions
  in the peroxisomes and transport of FAD, PLP, ThPP, heme, FMN and AMP. Most of the
  peroxisomal matrix proteins are imported into peroxisomes via a PTS1-specific pore.
  Proteins may be imported as monomers or in a fully folded form complexed with their
  cofactor. Cofactors that may be co-imported with proteins are FAD (with ACOX and
  ADHAPS proteins), FMN (HAO1, HAO2, HAO3), ThPP (with HACL1), PLP (with AGT), and
  heme (with catalase). It has also been suggested that the PMP34 transporter can
  import free FAD into peroxisomes. In the peroxisome, FAD forms an active enzyme
  with apoenzyme ACOX. The pyrophosphatase NUDT12 may mediate the degradation of FAD
  to FMN and AMP. FMN and AMP are subsequently exported from peroxisomes, probably
  by PMP34. Acyl-CoA oxidases (ACOX) mediate the first (dehydrogenation) reaction
  of the beta-oxidation. During dehydrogenation, FAD is reduced to FADH2. FADH2 is
  re-oxidized by direct transfer of electrons to O2, resulting in the production of
  H2O2. H2O2 is degraded by the heme-dependent enzyme catalase to H2O and O2. It is
  unclear whether free ThPP or PLP are imported into peroxisomes. Alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate
  synthase (ADHAPS) catalyzes the exchange in acyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate (acyl-DHAP)
  of the acyl chain with long-chain alcohol through a non-redox mechanism. The ThPP-dependent
  enzyme 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase (HACL1) catalyzes the cleavage of 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA
  into pristanal and formyl-CoA during peroxisomal alpha-oxidation of phytanoyl-CoA.
  The PLP-dependent enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) catalyzes the
  transamination of glyoxylate to glycine during glyoxylate detoxification. The FMN-dependent
  enzymes 2-hydroxyacid oxidases (HAO1, HAO2, HAO3) catalyze oxidation of glycolate
  to glyoxylate. Enzymatic reactions or molecules belonging to the same metabolic
  pathway are marked with background color and listed at the bottom.
