caption: 'NFκB can be activated via three main pathways: the classical/canonical,
  alternative/non-canonical, and the atypical pathways. The classical pathway involves
  a three subunit IKK complex composed of IKK1, IKK2, and regulatory subunit IKKγ,
  IκB proteins, and the NFκB p65/p50 heterodimer. The alternative pathway involves
  NIK, a two-subunit IKK complex composed of two IKK1 subunits, p100, and the NFκB
  RelB/p52 heterodimer. NIBP binds directly to IKK2 and NIK and may bridge both classical
  and alternative activation pathways together. NIBP may be essential for NFκB activation
  and its dysregulation may be involved in the pathogenesis of various NFκB-associated
  disorders.Notes. IL1R, interleukin-1 receptor; TLR, toll-like receptor; TNFR, tumor
  necrosis factor receptor; BAFFR, B-cell activating factor receptor; NIK, NFκB-inducing
  kinase; IκB, Inhibitor of NFκB; IKK, IκB kinase; NFκB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells.'
