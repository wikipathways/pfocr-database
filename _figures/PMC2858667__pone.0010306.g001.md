caption: 'Inset: recording setup. One stimulating electrode was placed in the site
  of the PP pathway, and another stimulating electrode was placed in the site of SC
  synapses. Somatic recordings under the whole-cell voltage clamp mode were made in
  CA1 pyramidal neurons. A1. Representative traces of EPSCs in response to independent
  PP and SC stimuli recorded from the same rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron in
  the absence and presence of DHPG (50 µM) and washout. A2. Time courses of DHPG-induced
  changes in EPSCs. A3. Mean values of EPSCs averaged from 6 to 10 (Peak) and 36 to
  40 min (LTD) following DHPG application. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 compared with PP. B1.
