caption: The cGAS-cGAMP-STING mediated DNA sensing and signaling. cGAS is an innate
  immune sensor recognizing a diverse array of aberrant cytosolic dsDNA, which include
  pathogen-derived DNA from bacteria, DNA viruses, or reverse-transcription of retroviruses,
  and self-DNA from nuclei or mitochondria of dead or damaged cells. Cytosolic DNA
  binds to and activates cGAS, which catalyzes cGAMP synthesis from GTP and ATP. cGAMP
  then binds to and activates STING at the ER membrane. Activated STING translocates
  to the Golgi compartments, where it interacts with TBK1 or IκB kinase (IKK), which
  is facilitated by the palmitoylation of STING. TBK1 phosphorylates STING, which
  in turn recruits IRF3 for phosphorylation by TBK1. Phosphorylated IRF3 dimerizes
  and enters the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcriptional expression of type
  I IFNs. In parallel, IκBα phosphorylation by IKK results in the translocation of
  NF-κB to the nucleus and the corresponding transcriptional expression of inflammatory
  cytokines. Notably, in some contexts, the synthesis and release of type I IFNs could
  induce the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression via the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathways in a positive feedback loop
