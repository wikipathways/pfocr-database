caption: Autoimmune vs. inflammatory responses in psoriasis. A) Antigen presentation
  plays a key role in psoriasis. Two endoplasmic aminopeptidases involved in processing
  of peptide antigens; ERAP1 and ERAP2, are established susceptibility genes in psoriasis
  along with HLA-Cw6 (highlighted in red). These have a role in processing and presenting
  antigens to CD8+ T cells, which on activation release pro-inflammatory cytokines
  including IL-17, TNF-α and IFN-γ. Another antigen presenting pathway involved in
  psoriasis involves presentation of lipid antigens to T and NKT cells through surface
  CD1 molecules. No susceptibility genes have yet been identified in that pathway.
  B) keratinocytes are the principal producer of IL-36 cytokines. Their expression
  is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-17 and TNF-α. Release
  of IL-36 cytokines from keratinocytes is triggered by danger signals such as ATP.
  Secreted IL-36 cytokines are found in full-length form (fIL-36), and have minimal
  biologic activity. When exposed to neutrophil nets, neutrophil proteases, or keratinocyte
  derived proteases (cathepsin S), fIL-36 is converted into a shorter, more active
  form (truncated IL-36; tIL-36). Truncated IL-36 (tIL-36) has approximately 500-fold
  increase (500×) in biologic activity. IL-36 cytokines act on the IL-36 receptor
  and induce expression of more IL-36 thereby promoting a self-sustaining cycle of
  inflammation that brings in additional leukocytes. Keratinocytes may regulate this
  process through secretion of serine-protease inhibitors such as serpin A1 and serpin
  A3, or the IL-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36RA). The three genetic variants associated
  with pustular psoriasis (IL36RN, CARD14, and AP1S3, highlighted in red) are involved
  in this process.
