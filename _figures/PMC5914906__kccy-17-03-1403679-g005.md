caption: The metabolic network which regulates the cell cycle activation at the O2
  dependent G1/S transition and its modification by pyruvate addition. The core of
  the network is the cellular redox-state expressed by the cytosolic NADP/NADPH ratio.
  This ratio (A) regulates the transfer of reducing equivalents (H) from the methylene-tetrahydrofolate
  (CH2-FH4) to methenyl-trahydrofolate (CH-FH4), a crucial NADP-dependent reaction
  generating NADPH. This is a limiting step of the synthesis of purine ring (B), required
  for the amplification of purine pools indispensable for the G1/S transition. A fundamental
  role in the regulation of the NADP/NADPH ratio is played by folate, whose reduction
  to FH4 by the dehydrofolic reductase (DHFR) generates NADP (A). The addition of
  an excess of FH4 impairs the DHFR activity, leading to an increment of NADPH, with
  the consequent reductive shift of the NADP/NADPH ratio and the inhibition of the
  G1/S transition. Consistently, FH4 mimics the effects of MTX, a powerful inhibitor
  of DHFR (A), incrementing the NADPH levels and inhibiting cell recruitment into
  S. Whatever the mechanism incrementing the cytosolic NADPH, including an excess
  of glutamine through the glutaminolytic pathway (A), has an inhibitory effect, unless
  the NADPH is removed through the shuttle mechanisms, which discharge the cytosolic
  reducing equivalents onto the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The frame above is
  regulated by the size and shape of the mitochondrial apparatus, see the oval sketches
  (C) in the Figure. Actually, the respiratory chain, which is the mitochondrial core,
  deeply differs in adult differentiated cells as compared to stem cell and cancer
  undifferentiated cells; the adult cells normally contain a high number of differentiated
  cristae-rich mitochondria (dashed black line), whereas stem cancer cells contain
  very few cristae-poor mithocondria (red line). This difference implies that the
  two cell types can exploit two different amount of disposal of reducing equivalents
  (H) produced both by the glycolytic pathway as well as by the metabolic oxidative
  reduction carried out in the cytosol. In fact, these sources compete each other
  for the respiratory chain with the following consequences. Up to the point that
  no one of the two sources saturate the respiratory chain, glycolysis will be performed
  down to the final oxidation of glucose down to CO2 and H2O, without arresting glucose
  metabolism at the level of the pyruvate exportation through the lactate conversion.
  This is the reason why adult differentiated cell do not produce lactate but in anaerobiosis,
  or upon inhibition of respiratory chain (e.g. by antimycin A). This is what Warburg
  called the anaerobic glycolysis, which is the pathway that each cell must activate
  in severe hypoxia. On the other hand, whenever in aerobic conditions, the cytosolic
  sources tend to saturate the respiratory chain (e.g. in the presence of an excess
  of pyruvate) the cell brings about the total oxidation of glucose without lactate
  conversion, proportionally to the unsaturation of respiratory chain. Under this
  conditions, the cell will produce lactate despite the presence of O2, which is what
  Warburg defined aerobic glycolysis, the enigma remains so far the Warburg paradox,
  with the inscribed anticancer therapeutic suggestion explore in this study. The
  extreme pyruvate anticancer selectivity derives from the easy saturation of the
  respiratory chain of the immature cancer mitochondria, as compare to the vast number
  of the mature mithocondria of adult differentiated cells. Indeed the saturation
  of differentiated cells is not obtainable at concentrations thousand time higher
  than the cancer cytotoxic ones. Updated from 25.
