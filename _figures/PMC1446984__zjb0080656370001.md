caption: Comparison of conventional and proposed arginine biosynthetic pathways. The
  novel arginine biosynthesis pathway inverts the order of transcarbamylation and
  deacetylation. N-Acetylornithine is converted to N-acetylcitrulline, which is subsequently
  deacetylated. The dashed line indicates the ArgJ recycling mechanism seen in many
  prokaryotes.
