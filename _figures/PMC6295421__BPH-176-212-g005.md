caption: Proposed mechanisms of nitrergic neurotransmission in the SIP syncytium.
  GI muscles are innervated by excitatory (EEN) and inhibitory (EIN) enteric motor
  neurons. Major inhibitory neurotransmitters released by EIN are NO, purines (β‐NAD
  shown) and peptides, such as VIP and PACAP (release of β‐NAD, and VIP/PACAP is indicated,
  but mechanisms for these neurotransmitters are not depicted). NO is synthesized
  by nNOS (NOS1) expressed by EIN and released on‐demand by Ca2+ influx into varicosities.
  NO binds to sGC in SIP cells. In ICC‐IM, binding of NO to sGC causes formation of
  cGMP that can interact with PKG1β (PRKG1β) to phosphorylate and activate K2P2.1
  channels and generate an outward current. PKG1β can also phosphorylate IRAG which
  interacts with IP3R1 (IP3R1) and inhibits Ca2+ release from stores (see Figure ).
  Cessation of Ca2+ release causes deactivation of CaCC (ANO1) channels, causing a
  net gain in outward current in the cells. Activation of K2P2.1 channels or deactivation
  of CaCC (ANO1) can cause hyperpolarization of ICC‐IM and, via gap junctions (GJ)
  connectivity with other SIP cells, hyperpolarization of the SIP syncytium. PDE3A
  is also a possible target for cGMP, and its inhibitory effects on PDE3A may increase
  the levels of cAMP and cause downstream signalling through PKA. Effectors for this
  pathway have not been identified. PDGFRα+ cells also express sGC subunits, PKG1
  and K2P2.1 channels. This pathway in PDGFRα+ cells is speculative at the present
  time. SK3 channels in PDGFRα+ cells (not shown) produce the outward current that
  causes the fast IJP phase of inhibitory neurotransmission (Kurahashi et al., ) (and
  see Figure ). NO also binds to sGC in SMCs where it produces cGMP, activates PKG1β
  and causes Ca2+ desensitization (−) of the contractile apparatus, inhibition (−)
  of CaV1.2 channels and activation of K2P2.1 channels. Speculative steps are denoted
  by question marks. ICC‐MY are present in most areas of the GI tract and generate
  pacemaker activity through release of Ca2+ from stores and activation of CaCC (ANO1)
  channels. Pacemaker activity (depicted as slow waves) conducts to SMCs causing periodic
  depolarization and phasic contractions. Neural inputs are superimposed upon the
  pacemaker activity.
