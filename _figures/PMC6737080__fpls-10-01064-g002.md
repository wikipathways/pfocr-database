caption: Schematic of a hypothetical pathway of extracellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate
  (eATP)-activated conductances in root epidermal plasma membrane. Hypothetical model
  integrating the eATP-induced plasma membrane (PM) conductances from this study and
  previous findings referenced in the main text. The signal cascade is presented from
  left to right, starting with eATP perception by the receptor. Polarity of the PM
  potential at the cytosolic face is represented by “−” or “+”. Phosphorylation is
  indicated by “P”. An early event would be Ca2+ influx through hyperpolarization-activated
  Ca2+ channels (HACCs). Extracellular H2O2 could enter the cytosol through aquaporins
  (AQPs). H2O2 could directly act on ion channels or be converted to hydroxyl radicals
  (OH•) through Fenton reactions (indicated by question marks). Anion channels would
  sequentially permit Cl− efflux; then influx and nonselective cation-permeable channels
  (NSCCs) would facilitate K+ efflux. The overall sequence would promote repolarization
  of the PM potential. Arrows indicate possible activation pathways but do not necessarily
  imply direct interactions. The dashed arrows are predicted pathways, which are highly
  recommended to be investigated in future.
