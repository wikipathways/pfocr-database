caption: (A) Androgen signaling is essential in promoting testis organization and
  spermatogenesis in the control males. (B) Testis organization and spermatogenesis
  is impaired in the ar-/- males. (C) The impaired testis organization and spermatogenesis
  in the ar-/- males could be rescued by 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP) supplement.
  (D) Testis organization and spermatogenesis proceeded normally in the cy17a1-/-
  fish, resulting from the enhanced progestin signaling caused by cyp17a1 depletion.
  (E) The alternative compensatory pathway induced by cyp17a1 depletion is ar-independent.
  (F) The alternative compensatory pathway induced by cyp17a1 depletion is npgr-dependent,
  demonstrating a high progestin/nuclear progestin receptor (nPgr) signaling pathway
  in promoting testis organization and spermatogenesis independent of androgen signaling.
  Red letters and lines indicate the upregulation of the progestin/nPgr signaling
  pathway, while green letters indicate the decreased concentration of androgens or
  downregulated insl3. The dotted lines indicate the brief description with omission
  or the potential existence of the proposed model.
