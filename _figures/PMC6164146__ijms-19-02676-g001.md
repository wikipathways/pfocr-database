caption: Mechanisms of modulating IL-33 localization and cytokine function. Upon synthesis,
  full length (FL)-IL-33 is targeted to the nucleus by a nuclear localization signal
  where it binds to chromatin to repress expression of inflammatory genes. Activation.
  In response to mechanical stress, tissue injury or damage, or necrosis, IL-33 is
  released into extracellular space by a poorly understood mechanism. Under inflammatory
  conditions, FL-IL-33 is active, but its activity is amplified upon cleaved by proteases
  secreted by neutrophils (cathepsin G or elastase) or mast cells (chymase or tryptase)
  to generate truncated forms that are 10–30-fold more bioactive. FL-IL-33 and its
  derivatives then bind to the ST2L receptor expressed on the cell surface of target
  cell. Inactivation. Under homeostatic conditions, sequestration of IL-33 in the
  nucleus prevents the unleashing of its cytokine function. During apoptosis, IL-33
  is inactivated by the apoptotic proteases (caspase 3 and 7) to prevent its activation
  of the immune response upon apoptotic release. Extracellular IL-33 can be scavenged
  by the soluble decoy receptor sST2 or oxidized at cysteine residues to form disulfide
  bonds to block its interaction with ST2L receptor. Green arrows indicate activation
  while red arrow indicates inactivation of IL-33 or IL-33/ST2 signaling.
