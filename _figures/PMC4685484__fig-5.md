caption: HMGB1-TLR4 binding and downstream activation. TLR4 has two distinct pathway
  choices, varying by the involvement of the MyD88 adaptor protein. Both pathway products
  are key to the inflammatory process. LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  primary response gene 88. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred
