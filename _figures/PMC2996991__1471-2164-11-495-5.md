caption: 'A-D: Representation of 4 networks (Networks 1, 2, 3 and 4) derived from
  the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). This figure displays an analysis, which depicts
  the central role of cytokines in granulation tissue and wound healing. The network
  categories are indicated in each figure. A, Network 1 (up-regulated genes) Cardiovascular
  Disease, Organismal Injury and Abnormalities, Tissue Morphology; B, Network 2 (up-regulated
  genes): Free Radical Scavenging, Cellular Movement, Hematological System Development
  and Function; C, Network 3 (up-regulated genes): Inflammatory Disease, Respiratory
  Disease, Carbohydrate Metabolism; D, Network 4 (up-regulated genes): Cellular Development,
  Hematological System Development and Function, Immune and Lymphatic System Development
  and Function.'
