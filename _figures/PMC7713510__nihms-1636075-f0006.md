caption: During late gestation, coregulators, SRC-1 and SRC-2 serve essential and
  cooperative roles in mediating the stimulatory actions of glucocorticoids and cytokines
  on expression of the gene encoding 11β-HSD1 in fetal lung. These stimulatory effects
  of SRCs are mediated via two different pathways - one involving glucocorticoids
  acting via GR (left panel), which selectively binds to the C/ebpβ promoter in MFL
  to increase C/ebpβ transcription in a Src-1/-2-dependent manner. The increase in
  C/ebpβ transcriptional activity can cause increased C/EBPα expression. The other
  pathway involving proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNFα) (right panel), which
  increase markedly in the fetal lung near term, is mediated, in part by increased
  NF-κB transcriptional activity, which also is SRC-dependent. The increased IL-1β
  and TNFα promote phosphorylation, activation, and nuclear translocation of C/EBPβ
  and NF-κB. These glucocorticoid and cytokine regulated pathways thus converge on
  transcriptional activation of C/ebpβ, C/ebpα and NF-κB, which act cooperatively
  to increase 11β-hsd1 gene expression. The active glucocorticoids that are synthesized
  can then act in a positive feed-forward loop to increase GR transcriptional activity,
  resulting in a further increase in 11β-hsd1 expression, as well as other GR-responsive
  genes.

    The increase in C/ebpβ transcriptional activity can cause increased C/EBPα expression.
