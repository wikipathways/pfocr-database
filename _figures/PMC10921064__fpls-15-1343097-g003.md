caption: A general model depicting known and predicted drought-induced ABA signaling
  pathways that result in drought tolerance mechanisms. Drought-induced ABA upregulates
  DRO1, but the intermediary signaling mechanism is currently unknown. ABA also directly
  and indirectly upregulates several higher order transcription factors such as AP2/ERFs
  and NACs, which both directly and indirectly modulate phenylpropanoid gene transcription.
  Lastly, drought-induced ABA is responsible for upregulating transcription of aquaporins
  in roots, which appear to be coregulated with genes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic
  pathway. ABA, abscisic acid; DRO1, DEEP ROOT 1; SnRK, Sucrose nonfermenting1-related
  Kinases; AREBs, Abscisic Acid-Responsive Element Binding proteins; NACs, NAM-ATAF-CUC2
  transcription factors; AP2/ERFs, APETALA2/Ethylene-Responsive Factors
