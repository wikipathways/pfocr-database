caption: Similarities and differences in apoptotic machinery across evolution. Many
  of the core proteins of the apoptotic pathway are conserved in nematodes (C. elegans),
  fruit flies (D. melanogaster), and mammals, and these protein families share some
  functional similarities (which is noted by matching colors in the figure). As an
  example, Apaf-1, which forms the backbone of the caspase-9 activating apoptosome
  in response to cytochrome c, has a homolog, dApaf-1 (dArk), in the Drosophila pathway,
  which facilitates Dronc activation, although it does not appear to be activated
  by cytochrome c. In C. elegans, CED-4 also auto-oligomerizes to form a complex that
  enables activation of the CED-3 caspase. For a more complete description of each
  pathway, including highlights of similarities and differences between species, please
  see the text.
