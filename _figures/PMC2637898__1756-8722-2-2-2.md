caption: 'EGFR signaling pathways. Two important cell-survival pathways that operate
  downstream of activated ErbB transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (represented
  by pairs of yellow, and yellow and blue receptors to represent homo- and hetero-dimers,
  respectively), along with some of the key constituent signaling molecules are shown.
  The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway is shown on the left, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K)-AKT pathway is shown on the right. Key points along the pathway where targeted
  inhibition seems to exert a blockade are indicated by red circles, showing the relevant
  proteins they target. ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GRB2, growth factor
  receptor-bound protein 2; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; SOS, son of sevenless.
