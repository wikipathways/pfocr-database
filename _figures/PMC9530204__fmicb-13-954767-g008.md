caption: Proposed working model of SsUbc2 in S. scitamineum. SsUbc2 functions as a
  coordinator to orchestrate the transcriptome of the fungus by regulating key transcription
  factors that have a global impact on the transcriptome. More secondary transcription
  factors, protein kinases, signaling components, and other essential genes initially
  regulated may further exert their influence on transcription to refine gene regulation
  and cell function, including responses to mating and infection. Loss of SsUbc2 causes
  chaos in the regulation of gene expression, resulting in impairment in key signaling
  transduction pathways such as the MAPK pathway and dysfunction in the cell that
  further results in failed mating/filamentation and pathogenicity (). TFs, transcription
  factors. Arabic numerals indicate the number of DEGs.
