caption: An overview of the metabolic pathways of C. pyrenoidosa and the interactions
  between the identified up- or down-regulated proteins. Antioxidant proteins are
  displayed in the mitochondria. The chloroplast proteins are displayed in chlorophyll
  and lutein biosynthesis. Transcription and protein fate-related proteins are displayed
  in the signaling from cytoplasm to nucleus. Metabolism and energy-related proteins
  are displayed in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways. ALA, 5-aminolevulinic
  acid; DXP, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate; 1,3-DPG, 1,3-diphosphoglycerate; EMP,
  glycolytic pathway; GPI, Glucose-6-phosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; HMBPP,
  1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate; ME-cPP, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate;
  mRET, mitochondrial respiratory electron transport chain; MEP Pathway, methylerythritol
  phosphate pathway; OAA, oxaloacetic acid; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PIF, phytochrome-interacting
  factor; Pfr, active form; Spot U3, peroxiredoxin TSA1; Spot U4, Magnesium chelatase
  subunit of protochlorophyllide reductase (ChlI); Spot U5, 2-Cys peroxiredoxin; Spot
  D14, coproporphyrinogen III oxidase; Spot D17, d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase;
  Spot U21, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1yl diphosphate synthase (ispG); Spot D25,
  Phytochrome A; Spot D30, TCP-1 eta subunit (CCT7); Spot U36, Superoxide dismutase;
  Spot D37, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). The solid line box indicates
  that the metabolic pathway has been verified, and the dashed box indicates that
  it needs to be verified. The “→” indicates that the reaction is completed in one
  step, and the “→∙∙∙→” indicates that the multi-step reactions are required.
