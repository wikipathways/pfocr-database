caption: 'Proviral and antiviral roles of FLIP variants and corresponding signaling
  pathways induced in the presence or absence of inflammatory cytokine. Prior to induction
  of host innate immunity, c-FLIP enhances HBV transcription and replication by protecting
  HBx from proteasomal degradation. Additionally, c-FLIP up-regulates HNF1α and HNF4α
  levels that are essential co-factors for HBV genome expression. The inhibitory transcription
  factor HNF3β is degraded to facilitate HBV RNA production (left). Following the
  moderate induction of TNF-α, HBx-p22-FLIP-NEMO ternary complex is formed that further
  enhances canonical NF-κB pathway by proteasomal degradation of phosphorylated IκB,
  which amplifies c-FLIP transcription by p50 and p65. This renders antiviral activity
  of c-FLIP. When TNF-α is highly secreted, c-FLIP is cleaved by caspase-8 to form
  p22-FLIP which consequently phosphorylates ERK1/2. Activated ERK1/2 accelerates
  and blocks HNF3β and HNF4α, respectively which impedes HBV transcription from cccDNA.
  Lastly, high level of TNF-α activates apoptosis by direct activation of cascades.
  This event is accelerated following the interaction between c-FLIP and HBx (right).
