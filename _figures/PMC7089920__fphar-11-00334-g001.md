caption: 'Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced by gut bacteria. The three
  major SCFAs are acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Four pathways are known for the
  production of butyrate from carbohydrates: the acetyl-coenzyme A pathway is the
  most prevalent followed by the lysine pathway, 4-aminobutyrate and glutarate-based
  pathways.'
