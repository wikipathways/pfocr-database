caption: The HCV life cycle and points of intervention. Points of intervention in
  the HCV life cycle are marked with numbered circles, and types of inhibitors of
  the individual steps are indicated in the legend. Interaction of extracellular HCV
  LVPs (1) with cellular surface receptors initiates the entry process (2), which
  can also occur from direct cell-to-cell transmission. After pH-dependent fusion
  and uncoating, the incoming HCV genome is translated and the resulting polyprotein
  processed (bottom inset and , (3)). Replication takes place in ER-derived membrane
  spherules (membranous web, bottom right inset, (4)), the architecture of which remains
  to be fully defined. The spatiotemporal contribution of miR-122 binding to the HCV
  genome is not yet fully understood, and miR-122 presence is indicated with ‘?’.
  In the assembly and release process (top right inset, (5)), core protein is transferred
  from cLDs to form nucleocapsids that, assisted by NS5A, are loaded with RNA. Replicase
  proteins supposedly bind HCV RNA during transfer from replication to packaging,
  the intracellular sites of which might converge. It is not clear whether the RNA
  is transiently located on the cLD. The p7, NS2 and NS3-NS4A proteins are also involved
  in coordination of assembly. HCV virion morphogenesis is coupled to the VLDL pathway,
  and particles are produced as LVPs. Particles released from cell culture have less
  ApoB association and resemble the ApoB-deficient particle illustrated. LVPs also
  associate with ApoC, which for simplicity is not shown here. EphA2, ephrin receptor
  type A2; GAG, glycosaminoglycans; PL, phospholipids; TG, triglycerides. In the translation
  inset, NS5A is shown as a dimer, though several other HCV proteins also form homo-
  or heterodimers or oligomers. For comprehensive discussion and illustration of HCV
  assembly and release and of membrane-associated HCV protein structures, see ,, respectively.
