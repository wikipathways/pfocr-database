caption: Circles represent the metabolites, and arrows represent reactions. Big rectangles
  represent compartments that reaction take place in (e.g., blood, cytosol, mitochondrion).
  DNL pathway holds an important place in the carbon flow of the liver cell. The glucose
  entering the cell can be utilized in the TCA cycle or can be converted to Triglycerides
  (TG) for storage. DNL pathway is particularly relevant to CF since it has been showed
  that mice with CF exhibit low lipogenesis and deposition of newly synthesize fatty
  acids into adipose tissue .
