caption: 'Signaling pathways involving molecular markers for human breast cancer.
  The green lines show cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes. HER2/neu is an orphan receptor
  that can be activated by overexpression or mutation of the transactivating domain
  (rat neu). Overexpression of HER2/neu results in enhanced cell survival and mitogenicity
  and its deregulation can lead to breast tumorigenesis. VEGF shows mitogenic activity
  by stimulating the Ras-Raf-Mapk and PI3K pathways. Erk activation by the Ras-Raf
  pathway leads to activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by Fos/Jun/Ets transcription
  factors. Cyclin D1 makes a complex with Cdk4/6 to phosphorylate Rb and release E2F
  proteins that regulate G1-S transition. Both cyclins E and A2 are direct targets
  for activating E2Fs. Activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway results in enhanced anti-apoptotic
  action through inhibition of the pro-apoptosis proteins (e.g. Bad, GSK3 and the
  transcription factor FKHR-L1, not shown). In addition, activation of the JAK-STAT
  pathway by HER2 leads to cell proliferation. A major mitogenic player acting downstream
  of HER2 is cyclin D1. As indicated, a number of pathways lead from the receptors
  to enhanced activation of cyclin D1, thereby promoting cell cycle progression. Of
  note, cyclin D1 also interacts with the ERα to promote its transcriptional activity
  in Cdk-independent fashion., Dmp1 (cyclin D binding myb-like protein 1; also named
  Dmtf1) is a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor that regulates the Arf-Mdm2-p53
  tumor surveillance pathway.,, Cyclin D1 is a negative regulator for Dmp1: however,
  it synergizes with Dmp1 on the Arf promoter. BRCA1/2 proteins are directly or indirectly
  phosphorylated by ATM/ATR kinases in response to DNA damage, which interact with
  p53 to stop the cell cycle by activating the p21Cip1/WAF1 promoter.Abbreviations:
