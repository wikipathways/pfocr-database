caption: Osteoblasts express components necessary for coordinating mineralization
  of ECM and phosphate handling by the kidney. FGF-23 secreted from osteoblasts under
  the control of PHEX and possibly Gsα-dependent pathways has systemic actions to
  regulate renal phosphate handling as well as potential autocrine effects to regulate
  osteoblast-mediated bone mineralization. The LRP-Wnt signaling pathway in osteoblasts
  regulates bone mass and, in conjunction with PHEX and FGF-23, may also participate
  in coordinating renal phosphate conservation to meet the needs of osteoblast-mediated
  mineralization.
