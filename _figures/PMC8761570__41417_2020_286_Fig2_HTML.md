caption: a NR8383 macrophages were stimulated or not with Poly (I:C) (5, 10 or 15 µg/mL)
  (n = 3). Cells were lysed before FASP and LC–MS/MS analysis. MaxQuant and Perseus
  software were used for the statistical analysis, and a heatmap was generated to
  show proteins that were significantly different between treated and untreated macrophages.
  Two clusters are highlighted. b Global pathway analyses of clusters 1 and 2.
