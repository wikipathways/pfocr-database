caption: miRNA generation pathways include both nucleus and cytoplasmic steps. To
  generate miRNAs, primary-miRNAs are transcribed from miRNA encoding genes using
  RNA polymerase II or III. The pri-miRNAs were digested by microprocessor complexes
  to the hair pin-loop precursor-miRNA. Pre-miRNA is transported to the cytoplasm
  by the exportin five transporter and processed into a miRNA duplex structure using
  Dicer and TAR RNA-binding proteins (TRBP). miRNA duplex is separated by helicase
  into one guide strand, comprised of a mature miRNA-5p or a mature miRNA-3p miRNA
  and one passenger strand. A passenger strand is degraded while the guide strand
  forms an RISC complex with Ago2 proteins and targets the 3’UTR of mRNA. The resulting
  miRNAs modulates gene activity.
