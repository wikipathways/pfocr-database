caption: Model of the proposed pathways involved in apoptosis of lung epithelial cells
  induced by LE. PAR-1 is triggered in response to LE treatment, leading to activation
  of NF-κB and p53 and enhanced expression PUMA (transcriptional effect). Increased
  levels of PUMA protein displace p53 from Bcl-XL, liberating free cytosolic p53 that
  in turn activates Bax that translocates to the mitochondria activating the intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway (post-translational effect).
