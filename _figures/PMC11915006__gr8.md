caption: Schematic model showing the mechanism by which LKB1 attenuates the efficacy
  of nab-PTX.Activation of the LKB1-AMPK signaling pathway increases cellular GSH
  level by promoting the expression of SLC7A11, which impairs the therapeutic potential
  of nab-PTX for the reduction of ROS in LKB1-WT NSCLC cells. The combination treatment
  of AMPK inhibitor, BAY-3827, efficiently sensitized NSCLC cells to nab-PTX treatment
  both in vitro and in vivo
