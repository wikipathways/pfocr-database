caption: Pathway generated by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software genes differentially
  regulated by 400µM copper in HepG2 cells. Genes that were up-regulated are in red.
  Genes that were down regulated are in green. Genes whose expression levels were
  not significantly changed are in pink. Light blue lines indicate known interactions
  of NFKB1. NFKB1 is outlined in blue. Gene abbreviations can be found via their Gene
  Cards (http://www.genecards.org)
