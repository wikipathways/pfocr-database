caption: TREM2 activation and downstream signaling TREM2 binds to ligands such as
  Aβ, ApoE, HDL, and LDL, leading to its activation. Following activation, TREM2 interacts
  with the ITAMs on TYROBP, resulting in the phosphorylation of TYROBP and the recruitment
  of SYK. The activation of the PI3K - AKT pathway mediated by TYROBP/SYK recruits
  other signaling adapters, including PLCγ and MAPKs inducing an release of Ca2+.
