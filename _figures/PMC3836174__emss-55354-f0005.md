caption: A) Deregulated nutrient-sensing. Overview of the somatroph axis involving
  growth hormone (GH) and the insulin/insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway,
  and its relationship to dietary restriction and aging. Molecules that favor aging
  are shown in orange, while molecules with anti-aging properties are shown in light
  green.B) Mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial function becomes perturbed by
  aging-associated mtDNA mutations, reduced mitochondriogenesis, destabilization of
  the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, altered mitochondrial dynamics or
  defective quality control by mitophagy. Stress signals and defective mitochondrial
  function generate ROS that, below a certain threshold, induce survival signals to
  restore cellular homeostasis, but at higher or continued levels can contribute to
  aging. Similarly, mild mitochondrial damage can induce a hormetic response (mitohormesis)
  that triggers adaptive compensatory processes.
