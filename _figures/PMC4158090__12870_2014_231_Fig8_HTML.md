caption: A working model for the regulation of SPL7 function. Cu supply depends on
  extracellular input and mobilization from intracellular stores via selective Cu-transport
  proteins, COPT. Acquired Cu is complexed by a set of metallochaperones, like CCH
  and ATX1, and delivered to specific targets. As main orchestrator of the Cu starvation
  response, SPL7 may be among these targets in order to become or remain repressed
  in the presence of sufficient Cu. This may be achieved through a direct interaction
  with delivered Cu resulting in an inability of SPL7 to bind to CuRE motifs in the
  promoter regions of its targets genes (1). In addition or alternatively, proteolytic
  processing of ER membrane-tethered SPL7 may be repressed in the presence of Cu (2).
  As a consequence, activation of SPL7 in response to Cu-deficiency may thus result
  from a relief of these repression mechanisms. Furthermore, ER stress caused by a
  failure to fulfil the demand for Cu of proteins involved in the secretory pathway,
  may actively promote the release of the membrane-bound SPL7 (3). Finally, a precocious
  dimerization to modulate the Cu deficiency response as the amount of released SPL7
  continues to raise may prevent SPL7 from entering the nucleus either due to NLS
  masking or exceeding the size exclusion limit of the nuclear pore (4).
