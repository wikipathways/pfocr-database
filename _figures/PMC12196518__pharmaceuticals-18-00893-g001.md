caption: 'The mechanisms of LSEC defenestration and the role of defenestrated LSEC
  in liver fibrosis. 1–6: LSEC defenestration could be induced by various factors.
  (1) Abnormal shear stress can affect the morphology of fenestrae by affecting the
  expression level of KLF2 in LSECs. (2) LPS and virus mediate inflammatory response
  by activating KCs, which subsequently secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as
  TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1. This activation upregulates the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading
  to the loss of LSEC fenestrae. (3) Excessive ROS generation caused by toxins, drugs,
  ox-LDL and inflammatory response can directly damage LSECs, activate the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, and influence the synthesis and utilization of NO, ultimately leading to
  LSEC defenestration. (4) High protein or high carbohydrate intake is associated
  with reduction in both the diameter and number of fenestrae in LSECs. (5) Bioactive
  Substances like TSP-1, VAP-1 and LPA can activate the Rho signaling pathway, which
  enhances the contractile capacity of the actin–myosin complex, ultimately leading
  to the contraction of fenestrae. (6) The suppressed eNOS activity results in significant
  dysfunction of NO, which subsequently disrupts the sGC signaling pathway. 7–9: Defenestrated
  LSECs mediate liver fibrosis through multiple pathways. (7) The activation of HSCs
  is regulated by various bio-mediums, including TGF-β, PDGF, IL-17, fibrinogen and
  NO. During the process of LSEC phenotypic transition, elevated levels of TGF-β and
  PDGF-β, along with impaired NO signaling, contribute to HSC activation. Additionally,
  IL-17 secreted by activated KCs and fibrinogen upregulation resulting from POFUT1
  loss can also promote HSC activation and type I collagen production. (8) Defenestration
  is associated with upregulation of VCAM-1, CD31 and CD34, loss of GATA4 signaling,
  reduced fenestrations, basement membrane synthesis and substance exchange dysfunction,
  leading to glycol-metabolic and lipo-metabolic disorders. (9) Hypoxia, driven by
  abnormal oxygen distribution and hemodynamic disturbances, promotes angiogenesis
  and activates HSCs via the HIF-1α signaling pathways. ECM deposition also aggravates
  hypoxia severity, establishing a vicious cycle that exacerbates pathological progression.
  (10) Increased tissue stiffness triggers actin cytoskeletal remodeling, leading
  to the loss of LSEC fenestrae and subsequently promoting ECM deposition'
