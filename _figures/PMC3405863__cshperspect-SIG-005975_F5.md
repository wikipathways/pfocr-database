caption: The segmentation clock oscillator. (A) Evidence of an oscillator underlying
  vertebrate segmentation comes from the transcriptional expression of the hairy1
  gene (dark green) in periodic waves in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). These waves
  are associated with the timely formation of pairs of somites that are added sequentially.
  Experiments in zebrafish have shown that a remarkable property among neighboring
  PSM cells is that they undergo synchronized gene-expression oscillations (as shown
  in boxed area), which are coordinated by the Notch signaling pathway. (B) The FGF,
  Notch, and Wnt signaling pathways underlie the mouse oscillator. Cyclic genes belonging
  to the FGF (left) and Notch (middle) pathways oscillate in opposite phase to cyclic
  genes of the Wnt pathway (right). Several feedback loops are indicated. These are
  involved in reinforcing activity or shutting down a pathway. Some instances of pathway
  crosstalk have also been observed. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; DACT1, dapper
  homolog 1; DKK1, dickkopf homolog 1; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; Grb2,
  growth factor receptor bound protein; Dll1, Delta-like 1; DSH, dishevelled; DUSP6,
  dual specificity phosphatase 6; ERK, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1; GSK3, glycogen
  synthase kinase 3; HES, hairy enhancer of split-related; LFng, lunatic fringe; LPR6,
  low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6; MEK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase 1; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; NKD1, naked cuticle 1 homolog; Nrarp,
  Notch-regulated ankyrin repeat protein; SHP2, Src homology region 2-containing protein
  tyrosine phosphatase 2; SOS, son of sevenless.
