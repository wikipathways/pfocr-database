caption: Schematic of the proposed mechanism whereby Sr affects proliferation and
  differentiation of bovine chondrocytes via the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)
  signaling pathway. Sr shifts the signaling of TGFβ1 to SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3)
  by promoting activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) expression and inhibiting ALK1
  expression. Phosphorylation of SMAD3 and SMAD1/5/9 after binding with SMAD4 transfers
  them into the nucleus to regulate gene transcription. An increase in pSMAD3 promotes
  the expression of type Ⅱ Collagen α1 (COL2A1) and aggrecan (ACAN). pSMAD1/5/9 induces
  type Ⅹ Collagen α1 (COL10A1), secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGFA), and alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) by stimulating the function
  of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). The increase in the pSMAD3 can inhibit
  the function of RUNX2 to decrease the COL10A1, SPP1, and ALPL expression.
