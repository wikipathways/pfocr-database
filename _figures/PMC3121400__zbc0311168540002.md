caption: Competition assays of RedJ with acyl-RedQ versus acyl-ACPs from fatty acid
  biosynthesis. A, LC/MS analysis of a mixture of decanoyl-RedQ (right spectra, red
  circles) and decanoyl-AcpP (left spectra, blue circles) incubated with RedJ at 37
  째C. Deconvoluted ESI mass spectra are shown at t = 0 and 10 min. RedJ hydrolyzed
  the two decanoyl-ACP substrates with equal efficiency. B, deconvoluted ESI mass
  spectra of a mixture of acetyl-RedQ (red circles) and acetyl-FabC (orange circles)
  incubated with RedJ at 37 째C and resolved with LC. Incubation times of t = 0, 5,
  and 10 min are shown. The peak corresponding to acetyl-RedQ decreased significantly
  after a 10-min incubation of the ACP mixture with RedJ, whereas the acetyl-FabC
  was undiminished.
