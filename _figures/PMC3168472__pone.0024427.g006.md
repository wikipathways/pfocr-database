caption: 'Eyestalk ablation releases gonad- or vitellogenesis- inhibiting hormones
  (GIH or VIH) allowing a synthesis of yolk protein. GnRH activates the calcium signaling
  pathway resulting in increased levels of intracellular calcium ion through the GnRH
  signaling and calcium signaling pathways, which subsequently activates folliculogenesis,
  estradiol and progesterone production in ovary. Progesterone may then induce progesterone-mediated
  oocyte maturation process from oocyte stage 1 to 4; Oc1–4. “XX” indicates that this
  type of cell is not known in shrimp but it is pituitary gonadotrope cell in other
  organisms. Abbreviation: GnRH: gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor; GIH: gonad
  inhibiting hormones; VIH: vitellogenesis inhibiting hormones; GV: germinal vesicle;
  GVBD: germinal vesicle breakdown.'
