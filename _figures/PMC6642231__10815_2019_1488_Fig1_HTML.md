caption: 'The folates and the one-carbon cycle (1-CC). The synthetic folic acid enters
  the folates cycles after a 2-step modification by DHFR: dihydrofolate reductase.
  In MTHFR SNPs carriers, the capacity to form 5 MTHF drops down to 75% in 677TTs.
  5MTHF is located downstream the MTHFR enzyme. Then, Hcy recycling is severely impaired.
  Note that the CBS pathway is allosterically activated by SAM (SAdenosyl Methionine):
  this pathway is of major importance for the synthesis of glutathione and Hypotaurine
  two regulators of oxidative stress'
