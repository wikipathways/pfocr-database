caption: 'Selected immune signaling pathways that are involved in alcohol use pathologies
  are illustrated. (A) The three primary neuroimmune cell types-microglia, astrocytes,
  and neurons-are illustrated with selected immune receptors that are relevant to
  alcohol use disorders. Several TLRs are implicated in microglial and astrocyte activation
  including TLRs2–4 and 7. Microglia also contain the IL-1β receptor (IL-1R) and interferon
  (IFN) receptors. Astrocytes contain TLRs2–4 as well as IFN receptors. Neurons have
  TLR3 and 7 responses in the context of alcohol use disorders, as well as the MCP-1
  receptor (CCR2) and IFN receptors. (B) Simplified versions of the signaling cascades
  for immune receptors that are relevant to alcoholism are shown. The TLR7 pathway,
  has been shown to be involved in alcoholic hippocampal neurodegeneration, and can
  lead to IFN gene induction via IRF7 as well as NFκB mediated immune gene induction.
  Both the IL-1R and surface TLRs such as TLR4 share the same downstream signaling
  pathway leading to NFκB mediated immune gene induction. The chemokine MCP-1 regulates
  ethanol self-administration and is a G-protein coupled receptor that can result
  in AP-1 mediated immune gene induction, NFκB activation, or neuronal plasticity
  via CREB signaling. The interferon receptors (IFN) are on all three cell types and
  are associated with depressive phenotypes. These activate the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway to result in interferon response gene expression. See References: [, , ,
