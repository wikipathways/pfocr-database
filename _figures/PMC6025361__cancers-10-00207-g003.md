caption: 'Therapeutic strategies for modulating sialic acid expression and interactions
  between sialic acid and sialic acid-binding receptors. (Upper left portion of cell):
  delivery of 3F-Neu5Ac to cancer cells to decrease sialic acid expression. 3F-Neu5Ac
  is typically delivered in its peracetylated form to penetrate the cell membrane.
  Once inside the cell, 3F-Neu5Ac is converted into CMP-3F-Neu5Ac and blocks the actions
  of STs in the secretory pathway. (Upper right portion of cell): blocking antibodies
  that abrogate the interaction between sialic acid on cancer cells and sialic acid-binding
  receptors on immune cells, such as Siglecs, have the potential of being a new class
  of immune checkpoint inhibitor. (Lower portion of the cell): antibody directed to
  the tumor, such as anti-HER2 to target breast cancer cells, have been conjugated
  to neuraminidase to cleave the sialic acid residues on the cancer cells.'
