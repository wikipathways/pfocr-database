caption: 'The BMP signaling pathways. (1) The BMP Smad-dependent (canonical) pathway:
  BMPs bind type II receptor and constitutively active type I receptor, which trans-phosphorylate
  and activate Smad1/5/8 (R-Smads). Phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 binds with Smad4, which
  translocate to the nucleus and regulate BMP downstream target genes. (2) The BMP
  Smad-independent (non-canonical) pathway: BMPs ligands activate the non-canonical
  pathway through TAK1, MKK3, and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). (3)
  BMP antagonists (Noggin) bind to BMPs ligands and prevent BPMs from binding to their
  receptors.'
