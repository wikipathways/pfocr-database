caption: Enhanced inflammatory gene expression by IL1B; feedback control by DUSP1
  and feed-forward control by ZFP36. IL1B treatment results in the activation of MAPKs.
  This, along with the activation of other signaling pathway and inflammatory transcription
  factors (e.g. NF-κB and AP-1 (not shown)), enhances expression of inflammatory genes
  (e.g. TNF) as well as the negative feedback regulator, DUSP1, and the feed-forward
  regulator, ZFP36. By binding and promoting mRNA decay and/or translational arrest
  of ARE-containing mRNAs, ZPF36 is a negative, incoherent, regulator of inflammatory
  gene expression. Following MAPK activation, the increased expression of DUSP1 is
  one mechanism by which MAPK activity is restored to basal level. Expression of ZFP36
  depends on MAPK activation, and this limits the expression of ARE-containing inflammatory
  mRNAs, such as TNF.
