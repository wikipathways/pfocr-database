caption: 'Biosynthesis and consumption of NAD+. NAD+ is produced from the following
  4 precursors: tryptophan, nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide riboside (NR), and nicotinamide
  (NAM). Through the de novo pathway, tryptophan is converted to quinolate through
  the kynurenine pathway. Quinolate is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide
  (NAMN) by quinolate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT). In addition, nicotinic acid
  is converted to NAMN by nicotinic acid phosphotransferase (NAPRT1). NAMN is converted
  to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylate
  transferase. Nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide are converted to nicotinamide
  mononucleotide (NMN) by nicotinamide riboside kinases (NMRKs) and nicotinamide phosphotransferase
  (NAMPT), respectively. In addition, NR can be degraded to NAM by purine nucleoside
  phosphorylase (PNP). NMN is converted to NAD+ by NMN adenlyltransferase (NMNAT).
  NAD+ can be consumed by the following 3 classes of enzymes: sirtuins, poly(ADP-ribose)
  polymerases, and cADP-ribose synthetases. A byproduct of consumption is NAM, which
  can be recycled back to produce NAD+.'
