caption: 'The anticancer effect of MBZ is mediated by at least two processes: one
  involving downregulated p-BCR/ABL and its downstream signaling pathways, and the
  other involving disrupted microtubule dynamics. This molecule downregulates p-BCR/ABL,
  p-STAT5 and MAPK signalling pathway, thereby inhibiting the growth of CML cells.
  MBZ blocks microtubule polymerization, results in cell cycle arrest at mitosis and
  triggers mitotic catastrophe event, which induces apoptosis in CML cells. In addition,
  MBZ triggers substantial DNA damage by delaying repair processing, leading to enhanced
  genomic instability and mitotic catastrophe. MBZ, mebendazole; CML, chronic myeloid
  leukemia; ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated; DNA-PKcs, DNA-dependent protein kinase'
