caption: 'Plasma differences in oxylipins and endocannabinoids, between control and
  AD groups. Fold changes projected on fatty acids, oxylipin, and endocannabinoids
  metabolic pathway. Only differences with the t-test p < 0.05 and FDR correction
  at q = 0.2 are shown. The network presents fatty acid metabolic pathway, including
  saturates and monounsaturates (SFA and MUFA) and omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids
  with oxylipins and endocannabinoid synthesis pathway. Both detected (black font)
  and not detected (gray font) metabolites are shown to visualize the coverage of
  the metabolic pathway in our targeted assay and facilitate data interpretation.
  Although, for the clarity of the figure, not all assay metabolites are displayed.
  The complete list of measured metabolites was previously reported []. Oxylipin metabolizing
  enzymes are colored by their class: red—lipoxygenase (LOX) and autoxidation pathway;
  blue—cytochrome p450 (CYP) epoxygenase; green—cyclooxygenase (COX); yellow—N-acylphosphatidylethanolamide-phospholipase
  D. Node size represents the fold difference, and the color represents the directionality
  of the difference: orange—higher in AD; light blue—lower in AD. Key enzymes involved
  in the metabolic step are abbreviated next to the edge. Fads, fatty acid desaturase;
  Elov, fatty acid elongase; sEH, soluble epoxide hydrolase; DH, dehydrogenase. Saturated
  and monounsaturated fatty acids were not measured in this assay and are indicated
  only to visualize precursors for measured oxylipins and endocannabinoids. Group
  means for all metabolites together with corresponding t-test p-values are provided
  in Table'
