caption: 'Different ways to activate NF-κB. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK): upon
  growth factor binding, RTKs associate forming dimers, are autophosphorylated at
  multiple tyrosines, and recruit additional signaling proteins. Among recruited proteins
  is phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K). In the atypical pathway, PI3K phosphorylates
  spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), which in turn phosphorylates IκB at Tyr42, the signal
  for IκB degradation. Alternatively, PI3K-activated Akt can transduce signals through
  the typical pathway by directly phosphorylating IκB kinase β (IKKβ). Interleukin-1
  receptor-1 (IL-1R1): after binding of IL-1 to the receptor, MyD88 is rapidly recruited
  and associates to the receptor via interaction of Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains
  present in both IL-1R and MyD88. IL-1R-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and IRAK4 are
  recruited to MyD88, where IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK1, resulting in hyperphosphorylated
  IRAK1 by autophosphorylation. The kinases dissociate from MyD88. An intermediate
  cytosolic complex composed of the E3 ligase pellino-1, IRAK1, IRAK2, and IRAK4 is
  formed, whereas TNF receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) becomes ubiquitinated,
  which serves as a platform for TGFβ-activated kinase (TAK1). The same complex is
  formed in TLR signaling (not shown) [reviewed in ref. ()]. TAK1 then activates IKKβ.
  Toll-like receptors (TLR): with the exception of TLR3 all TLRs similarly to IL-1R
  activate TAK1 through MyD88, activation of IRAK1 by IRAK4, IRAK1 autophosphorylation,
  and TRAF6 recruitment. In addition, Toll-receptor-associated activator of interferon
  (TRIF)-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), TRIF, and TIR-domain-containing adaptor
  protein (TIRAP) interact with the receptor. If the typical pathway is taken, TRAF6
  activates TAK1. If the signal enters the alternative pathway, NIK1 becomes activated.
  NIK1 directly phosphorylates IKKα, which initiates proteolytic cleavage of p100,
  the precursor of p52, by phosphorylation at Ser866 and 870. Finally, the RelB/p52
  heterodimer can enter the nucleus. TNFR: TNF binding to TNFR1 triggers the association
  of the adapter protein TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) to the receptor.
  Then, TRAF2, TRAF5, and the kinase receptor interacting protein-1 (RIP1) are recruited.
  RIP1 can activate TAK1 in the typical and NIK in the alternative pathway.'
