caption: Two predicted pathways for spermiogenesis. Spermatids from hermaphrodites
  and males probably each have a distinct pathway for spermiogenesis. One pathway
  is spe-8 class-dependent (surrounded by broken or solid orange line) and another
  is spe-8 class-independent (broken or solid light blue line). A decision to utilize
  either pathway might depend on activators that are sex-specific. The spe-8 class-dependent
  pathway seems to be stimulated by a hermaphrodite-derived activator(s) or the serine
  protease mixture Pronase, whereas male-derived serine proteases that are targets
  of the trypsin inhibitor-like protein SWM-1 utilize the spe-8 class-independent
  pathway. To initiate spermiogenesis, these activators might be required to cleave
  a certain cell-surface protein(s). There seem to be other possible ways to initiate
  spermiogenesis. For example, serine proteases targeted by SWM-1 might process a
  precursor protein(s) of the actual activator(s) for spermiogenesis. The SPE-6 kinase
  is downstream of SPE-8 class proteins and is one of the common points between these
  two pathways. This kinase phosphorylates (shown as “P” in a light orange ball) unknown
  substrate(s), and the phosphorylated protein then plays a role in signal transduction
  to block onset of spermiogenesis. The signal might affect the SPE-4 presenilin and
  presumably other proteins (purple and blue diamonds; the precise number is unknown).
  During spermiogenesis, SPE-6 activity is reduced so that negative regulatory proteins
  such as SPE-4 cannot function to block spermiogenesis. In this figure, the active
  and inactive status are shown by solid and broken lines, respectively. Thick, black
  arrows represent positive regulation, whereas negative regulation is expressed by
  T-shaped lines. PM, plasma membrane.
