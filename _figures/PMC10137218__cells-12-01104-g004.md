caption: 'WNK kinases regulate HCO3− versus Cl− secretion across human airway epithelia.
  Model shows the with-no-lysine [K] (WNK) kinase signaling pathway in human CF airway
  epithelia lacking functional CFTR. Left panel: WNK1 and WNK2 signal via intermediate
  Ste20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase/oxidative stress responsive
  1 kinase (SPAK/OSR1) to regulate basolateral Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC1) activity.
  Right panel: reducing WNK activity, inhibiting NKCC1, or removing Cl− from basolateral
  solution lower the intracellular [Cl−]. At the same time, these interventions also
  increase HCO3− secretion and alkalinize ASL. Higher pHASL improves epithelial host
  defenses which are otherwise impaired in CF. The mechanism by which WNK kinases
  and intracellular [Cl−] regulate apical and/or basolateral HCO3− transporters (CaCC,
  pendrin, NBC) remain unknown. Modified from Rehman et al. [101] and reproduced with
