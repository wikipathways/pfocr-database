caption: In the absence of a Wnt signal the destruction complex including Axin, APC
  and the kinase GSK3, phosphorylates (P) β-catenin. Phosphorylated β-catenin is recognized
  by the E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase β-TrCP and targeted for proteosome degradation.
  Wnt signaling inactivates the destruction complex, as a result β-catenin translocates
  into the nucleus, where it interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors and co-activators
  such as CBP/p300, to stimulate transcription. In the absence of Wnt signaling, DNA-bound
  TCFs interact with transcriptional co-repressors such as, Tle/Groucho to keep target
  genes turned off.
