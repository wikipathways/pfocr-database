caption: CK1 in Wnt-signaling. (A) In the absence of the Wnt ligand, β-catenin is
  progressively phosphorylated by CK1α and GSK3 (1), recruited to β-TrCP for ubiquitination
  (2), and thereby primed for proteasome- dependent degradation (3). (B) After binding
  of Wnt to Frizzled and LRP5/6 (1), LRP5/6 is phosphorylated by CK1γ (positive regulation)
  and CK1ε (negative regulation) (2). It then recruits Axin and the β-catenin destruction
  complex to the membrane and inhibits GSK3 (3, 4). Wnt-activated CK1δ and ε phosphorylate
  Disheveled (DVL) and Axin (5), induce a conformational change in the β-catenin destruction
  complex and initiate the dissociation of various components (6). CK1ε cooperates
  with DDX3 in phosphorylating DVL (7). Also, TCF3 can be phosphorylated by CK1δ and
  ε thereby increasing its binding to β-catenin followed by the nuclear translocation
  of TCF3/β- catenin (8). The non-canonical Wnt pathway is positively regulated by
  CK1δ- and ε-dependent release of Rap1 from Sipa1L1 inhibition (9). The Rho/JNK signaling
  cascade is activated after phosphorylation of DVL (10) [adapted from Cheong and
  Virshup ()].
