caption: In the process of bone development, the BK channel plays an essential role
  in the activation of osteoblast proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. When
  BK channels are unable to function normally, they stunt bone growth by inhibiting
  cytosol-nucleus transportation of β-catenin transportation in the canonical Wnt
  signaling pathway. USP7 maintains the stability of Axin1 and facilitates the degradation
  of β-catenin in osteoblasts, which decreases the expression of the transcription
  factor Runx2 and results in bone disorders.
