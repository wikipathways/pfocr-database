caption: 'Glucose is oxidized to pyruvate via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (glycolysis);
  a common metabolic intermediate in glycolysis is glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), which
  is also a precursor for the biosynthesis of capsule NDP-sugars; NDP-sugars are synthesized
  at the expense of UTP. Pyruvate is the substrate of three competing enzymes: lactate
  dehydrogenase, pyruvate formate-lyase and pyruvate oxidase. Homolactic fermentation
  reduces pyruvate into lactate, through lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), whereas mixed-acid
  fermentation leads to formate, acetate and ethanol. Oxygen might be consumed at
  the level of lactate oxidase (LOX coded by lctO), pyruvate oxidase (SpxB) or H2O-NADH
  oxidase (NOX). The occurrence of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) depicted
  in grey remains to be proved. Proposed pathways were reconstructed based on genome
  database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi), literature and database
  surveys (KEGG, MetaCyc). Gene annotation downloaded from NCBI: nox, NADH oxidase;
  pyk, pyruvate kinase; ldh, L-lactate dehydrogenase; lctO, lactate oxidase; spxB,
  pyruvate oxidase; ackA, acetate kinase; pfl, pyruvate formate-lyase; pta, phosphotransacetylase;
  adh, bifunctional acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase; PDHc, putative pyruvate
  dehydrogenase complex.'
