caption: The whole network from APOE genotype to AD constructed from KEGG-based Alzheimer’s
  disease pathway. The hypothesis is that the APOE genetic variant can affect AD through
  the gene expression on Alzheimer’s disease pathway. Multiple pathways with chain
  structure can be formulated with the staring node APOE genotype and the end node
  AD. The gene and directions are highlighted with a green frame and a black arrow
