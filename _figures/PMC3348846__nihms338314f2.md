caption: 'Leukocyte recruitment to sites of injury/infection: dominant role of ROS.
  (A) Activation of macrophages by infection/injury. PAMPs (e.g., LPS) generated by
  infection and DAMPs (e.g., HMGB1) generated by stressed/necrotic cells serve as
  ligands for TLR and RAGE on interstitial sentinel cells (e.g., macrophages). Ligation
  of these receptors results in activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX), which generates
  ROS (superoxide and its dismutation product H2O2) (red pathway). ROS can be (1)
  exported into the interstitium to affect adjacent endothelial cells and (2) further
  activate NOX (e.g., via an NF-κB pathway) leading to the generation of additional
  ROS (feed-forward mechanism). Activation of NF-κB can also increase iNOS levels,
  which results in NO generation (blue pathway). NO can dampen the inflammatory response
  by interacting with superoxide within macrophages or adjacent cells. (B) Rapid and
  delayed phases of endothelial activation. Endothelial cells are activated by the
  proinflammatory milieu (chemokines, cytokines, ROS, LPS, HMGB1). Rapid activation
  (NF-κB independent) of endothelial cells by chemokines and ROS results in further
  ROS generation via NOX (red pathways). Endothelial ROS contribute to adhesion molecule
  expression (P-selectin), which facilitates leukocyte rolling. ROS have also been
  implicated in endothelial cell generation of leukocyte activators (e.g., PAF and
  CXCL8), which are sequestered within the glycocalyx and facilitate leukocyte adhesion
  to the endothelium. Leukocyte adhesion to endothelium results in the clustering
  of endothelial adhesion molecules (docking structures). The resultant cell signaling
  disrupts adherens junctions (AJ) via NOX-derived ROS and facilitates leukocyte TEM.
  Delayed activation (NF-κB dependent) of endothelium reinforces the leukocyte–endothelial
  adhesive interactions via continued and amplified generation of ROS, chemokines,
  and cytokines via the NF-κB pathway.'
