caption: Model of the filamentous growth MAPK pathway. Upon nutrient limitation, expression
  of the gene encoding the aspartyl protease Yps1 is induced. Yps1 processes the signaling
  mucin Msb2 in its extracellular domain, which is required for MAPK activation. Processed
  Msb2 (Msb2*) associates with and functions through Sho1 to activate cytosolic signaling
  modules. Msb2 associates with the Rho GTPase Cdc42, and Sho1 functions in a complex
  with the GEF Cdc24. A straightforward possibility is that the association of activated
  Msb2 with Sho1 brings the GEF into close proximity with its GTPase. Activated Cdc42
  binds effector proteins including the PAK Ste20, which when activated, phosphorylates
  the MAPKKK Ste11, thereby activating the MAPK cascade.
