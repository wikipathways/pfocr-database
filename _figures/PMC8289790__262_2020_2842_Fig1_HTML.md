caption: Metabolic effects within the TME (a). Tumor cells consume major fraction
  of glucose and accelerate glycolysis, leading to the accumulation of lactate. The
  secreted lactate could influence cell types within the TME by activating multiple
  processes for the survival and proliferation of tumor cells. Higher glycolysis rate
  within the TME leads to the accumulation of lactate and induces various cellular
  and molecular events, including the upregulation of hyaluronic acid within the TME
  and favors tumor migration (1); activation of non-immunosuppressive macrophages
  (M1) to immunosuppressive M2 (2); upregulation of HIF-1α on Tregs could inhibit
  OXPHOS and PPARα signaling and favors the migration of Tregs into the TME (3); inhibition
  of AKT signaling network and induce apoptosis of activated T cells (4); promotion
  of angiogenesis and metastasis (5); polarization of conventional T cells to pTregs
  through the upregulation of TGF-β, HIF-1α, IL-10 and inhibition of AKT/mTOR pathway
  (6). Generation of pTregs within the TME (b). In hypoxic TME, HIF-1 binds to the
  hypoxia inducible response element (HRE) of tumor cells and activates the secretion
  of TGF-β. The secreted TGF-β also favors HIF-1 expression by inhibiting HIF-1 degradation
  enzyme PDH2. Moreover, the secreted TGF-β binds to its receptor on pTregs and triggers
  downstream pathways, including the phosphorylation of SMAD3, binding of phospho-SMAD3
  to SMAD4, recruitment of CBP/p300 and binding of these complex on FoxP3 promoter
  to induce the expression of FoxP3. In addition, PD-L1 is also the downstream target
  of HIF-1, which could bind to PD-1 on T cells. PD-1/PD-L1 interaction could activate
  the dephosphorylation of PI3K and block AKT/mTOR pathway. This signaling network
  helps to stabilize the expression of FOXP3. Moreover, tumor-derived exosomes could
  activate JAK/STAT3 pathway and favors the upregulation of IL-10. Altogether, hypoxic
  TME favors the polarization of conventional T cells to pTregs via multiple signaling
  cascades
