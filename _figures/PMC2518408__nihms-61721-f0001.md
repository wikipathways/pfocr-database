caption: Glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GART, EC 2.1.2.2) catalyzes the
  transfer of the formyl group from N10-formyl tetrahydrofolate to the primary, side-chain
  amino group of glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR) to yield formyl-glycinamide ribonucleotide
  (FGAR) and tetrahydrofolate (), ultimately resulting in the incorporation of C-8
  into inosinic acid (IMP). This reaction is the third step and the first of two folate-dependent
  formyl transfers in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. GART was first discovered
  and partially characterized from pigeon liver in pioneering investigations by Warren
  and Buchanan ().
