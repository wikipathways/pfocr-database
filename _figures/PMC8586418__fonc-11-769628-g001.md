caption: Type I Interferon Signalling Pathways. Type I IFNs bind the IFNAR1/IFNAR2
  receptors, causing heterodimerization and TYK2 and JAK1 activation, initiating STAT1/STAT2
  heterodimerization and phosphorylation. Following IRF-9-mediated translocation of
  this heterodimer to the nucleus, it binds interferon-stimulated response elements
  (ISREs), resulting in transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Resulting
  proteins include death receptor ligands (including TRAIL and Fas), which bind their
  respective receptors. Apoptosis is induced, either directly, or indirectly via NF-κβ
  signalling. These pathways also synergize with TNF-α pathway, increasing apoptosis.
  The STING pathway, initiated by detection of circulating tumour DNA, can mediate
  production of Type I IFNs or induce apoptosis, through canonical and non-canonical
  pathways following TBK1 activation. This includes its role in positive feedback
  loops involving IRF7, further increasing Type I IFN production.
