caption: Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) generation and ALI-associated single-nucleotide
  polymorphism (SNPs) in the S1P biosynthetic pathway. S1P is a lipid mediator that
  essentially promotes lung endothelial barrier function. It is generated by the action
  sphingosine kinase and metabolized by sphingosine lyase. S1P-mediated ligation of
  its receptors results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin, its rapid
  mobilization to the periphery, and interaction with myosin light chain (MLC) kinase
  (MLCK), finally culminating in enhanced endothelial cell barrier function. The SNPs
  associated with MLCK correlate to ALI susceptibility. The other modulators of this
  pathway are endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) () and CD44 () via S1PR1 transactivation.
  Despite the fact that TNF, a cytokine that is elevated in lung injury, is known
  to promote S1P synthesis, endothelial cell (EC) barrier may still remain compromised,
  due to insufficient S1P buildup, or due to the negative regulatory SNPs in MYLK.
