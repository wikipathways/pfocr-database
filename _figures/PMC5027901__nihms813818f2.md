caption: Once L. monocytogenes accesses the cytosol it is rarely exposed to extracellular
  host defenses, as such, detection by cytosolic innate immune sensors is likely critical
  for combating infection. Likewise, as L. monocytogenes must access the cytosol to
  cause to disease, avoidance or direct inhibition of the cytosolic innate immune
  system is likely critical for L. monocytogenes’ virulence. Indeed, multiple cytosolic
  innate immune pathways have been demonstrated to recognize L. monocytogenes infection
  (reviewed in ). Briefly, peptidoglycan fragments of L. monocytogenes can activate
  nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins leading to phosphorylation
  of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and transcription factor NF-κB activation
  further leading to inflammatory cytokine production (; ). Further, NOD signaling
  can synergize with interferon (IFN) signaling to enhance the host innate response
  (), although it should be noted that type I IFN induction has been shown to inversely
  correlate with host protection (; ; ). More recently, cyclic-di-nucleotides secreted
  by L. monocytogenes have been shown to be recognized by the STING/IRF3 pathway resulting
  in the production of type I IFNs (; ). Additionally, as will be highlighted in this
  chapter, L. monocytogenes has been reported to activate the inflammasome through
  a variety of receptors, ultimately resulting in activation of Caspase-1 (). Caspase-1
  activation leads to an inflammatory cell death, pyroptosis, release of the pro-inflammatory
  cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and the production and release of lipid mediators known
  as eicosanoids (). The engagement of these innate pathways resulting in the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of innate immune cells is hypothesized
  to be critical in the development of adaptive immunity.
