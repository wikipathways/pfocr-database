caption: Alterations of amino acids and amines for sepsis diagnosis (), septic shock
  diagnosis (), prognostication of sepsis (), prognostication of septic shock (),
  and monitoring the treatment response (). A down-sided triangle (▼) represents a
  decreased level, whereas an up-sided triangle (▲) represents vice versa. (A) Aromatic
  amino acids (AAAs) and its down-stream amino acid are illustrated. Phenylalanine
  is converted to tyrosine before metabolizing to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and
  catecholamines, respectively. Tryptophan is another AAA that can change to either
  kynurenine or serotonin and melatonin. (B) Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) including
  leucine, isoleucine, and valine are catabolized to S-(3-methylbutanoyl)-dihydrolipoamide-E
  and amino acid-derived acylcarnitines (C3-5), respectively. (C) A substrate of glutathione
  synthesis begins with methionine that converts into homocysteine, cystathionine,
  and cysteine, respectively. Moreover, serine is involved in the cystathionine production
  with an exchange of α-ketoglutarate. Cysteine can also turn into taurine, which
  has an anti-oxidant effect. (D) Glutamate is an intermediate substrate between glutathione
  production and urea cycle-related metabolites. Glutamate can be converted into glutamine
  and pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C). The latter metabolite is a precursor for proline
  synthesis. Moreover, glutamate can interchange with the urea cycle pathway metabolites.
  (E) The urea cycle pathway metabolites included citrulline, arginine, and ornithine.
  Arginine is a key amino acid for nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and NO inhibitors,
  including symmetric dimethylarginine (SMDA), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA),
  total dimethylarginine (total DMA), and dimethylamine. (F) Polyamines are converted
  from ornithine. The polyamine metabolites include putrescine, spermidine, and spermine.
