caption: 'DAergic pathways in brain. Major three dopaminergic pathways are presented:
  First, nigrostriatal pathway where DA cells within pars compacta (A8) and neighbouring
  area (group A9) from SN project to striatum, this projection is involved in mostly
  the control of vouluntary movement. Secondly, mesolimbic mesocortical pathway, which
  is the projection from VTA, cell group A10, to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the
  preforntal cortex (PFC) and other limbic areas. These neurons play a crucial role
  in reward-related behaviors. Thirdly, the tubero-infundibular pathways, which are
  the cells fromarcuate nucleus (cell group A12) and periventricular nucleus (cell
  group A14) of the hypothalamus, projecting to the pituituary. This pathaway is known
  to control the release and synthesis of pituituary hormone, mostly prolactin. VTA,
  ventral tegmental area; SN, substanita nigra; NAc, nucleus accumbens; PFC, Prefrontal
  cortex; HP, hypothalamus.'
