caption: TGR5-mediated signaling pathways to release GLP-1 and PYY and inhibition
  of release of GLP-1 and PYY by H2S. In STC-1 cells, activation of Gs-coupled TGR5
  receptors by OA causes stimulation of PI hydrolysis, and release of GLP-1 and PYY
  via a PKA-independent, cAMP-dependent mechanism involving Epac/PLC-ε/Ca2+pathway.
  H2S inhibits GLP-1 and PYY release by inhibiting PI hydrolysis and Ca2+ release.
papertitle: Release of GLP-1 and PYY in response to the activation of G protein-coupled
  bile acid receptor TGR5 is mediated by Epac/PLC-ε pathway and modulated by endogenous
  H2S.
