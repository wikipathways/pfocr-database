caption: Coronaviruses (CoVs) utilize autophagy pathway for replication. Both SARS-CoV
  and SARS-COV-2 recognize ACE2 as the cellular surface receptor that mediates the
  viral entry into the host via endocytosis. Several CoVs utilize ATG5/ATG7 independent
  autophagy that establishes an endocytic pathway-Golgi route potentially interacting
  with the multiple stages of virus replication cycle - (i) entry mechanism by endocytosis
  and fusion of viral and host membranes; (ii) uncoating and releasing the viral genomic
  RNA; (iii) transcription, replication and translation; (iv) trafficking and assembly
  and (v) egress by exocytosis. The replication transcription centers are intimately
  associated with DMVs, which are generated from the ER. DMVs mimic autophagosomes
  and subsequently these structures fuse with the late endosome, and the lysosome,
  which results in degradation of the sequestered cytoplasmic cargo. A number of CoVs
  including SARS-CoV-2 specifically block the fusion between autophagosome and lysosome.
  ACE2, angiotensin converting enzyme 2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; DMVs, double membrane
  vesicles.
