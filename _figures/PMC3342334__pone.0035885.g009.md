caption: Neonatal seizures induce intense synaptic activity followed by rapid increases
  in extracellular glutamate and BDNF levels (within 1 h post-HS; ). Activation of
  glutamate receptors, including NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors
  (CP-AMPARs) , followed by opening of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs),
  results in increased Ca2+ influx. Enhanced expression and function of BDNF activates
  the membrane-bound tyrosine kinase B receptors (TRKBRs) and, together with Ca2+
  influx, leads to the recruitment of the PI3K/PDK1/Akt and the Ras/MEK/ERK signaling
  pathways (within 1–3 h post-HS; ). Akt- and ERK-dependent inactivation of Tsc1/Tsc2
  complex results in activation of Rheb GTP-ase, and subsequent induction of mTORC1
  activity (within 12–24 h post-HS; ). In turn, the mTORC1 may inhibit 4EBP1 and enhance
  the activity of p70S6K at 12 h post-HS, leading to enhanced eIF4E and S6 signaling,
  and increased protein translation at 24 h post-HS. The negative feedback inhibition
  between p70S6K and PI3K may account for the time lag between p70S6K and S6 phosphorylation
  changes. Altered TORC1-dependent translation of synaptic plasticity proteins (such
  as PSD-95, CamKII, Arc, GluR1) , , among with other important cellular processes
  regulated by the mTORC1 kinase (autophagy, ribosomal biogenesis and cellular metabolism)
  , may lead to both short-term and long-term neuronal hyperexcitability (), enhancement
  of synaptic function (), epilepsy (), and autism-like behaviors (). Treatment with
  the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin immediately before and after neonatal seizures reverses
  both early and late neurological and behavioral consequences (– ).
