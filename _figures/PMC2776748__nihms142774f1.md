caption: A, Schematic diagram showing intra-cellular functions of the Bcl family of
  proteins. VEGF induces Bcl-2 expression via the VEGFR-2, PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.
  Pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bad and Bid heterodimerize with Bcl-2/Bcl-XL thus
  regulating their ability to inhibit activation of other pro-apoptotic proteins like
  Bax. Activation of Bax results in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial
  outer membrane, which together with Apaf1, causes caspase activation. This induces
  cell apoptosis. Bcl-2 also acts as a pro-angiogenic signalling molecule, by activating
  the NF-κB signaling pathway, inducing expression of the pro-angiogenic chemokine,
  CXCL8. B, A partial model schematic diagram. Tumor cells produce VEGF under conditions
  of hypoxia, which binds to endothelial cells via cell surface receptors resulting
  in receptor dimerization and activation. This elicits a proliferative and chemotactic
  response from the endothelial cells. Further, this causes over-expression of the
  pro-survival protein Bcl-2, which in turn results in up-regulation of CXCL8 production
  by them. CXCL8 in turn induces cell proliferation and chemotaxis. The endothelial
  cells begin to aggregate and differentiate into microvessels, that eventually fuse
  with mouse vessels and become blood borne, resulting in oxygenation of the tumor.
