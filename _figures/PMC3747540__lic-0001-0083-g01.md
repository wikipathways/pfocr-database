caption: 'Emerging signaling pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma. Chromatin remodelling:
  Deacetylation (Ac) of histones within the nucleosomes by HDACs results in DNA condensation,
  restricting transcriptional activation. On the other hand, chromatin remodelling
  complexes, including ARID1/2, lead to transcriptional activation by facilitating
  access for the transcription machinery through nucleosome restructuring. Notch signaling:
  Binding of protein ligands to the extracellular domain of NOTCH receptors (NOTCH-R)
  induces photolytic cleavage of the receptor, releasing its intracellular domain
  (NOTCH-ICD), which then enters the nucleus and modifies expression of its target
  genes (e.g., HES, HEY, and SOX9). Hedgehog (Hh) signaling: In the presence of Hh
  ligands, PTCH releases its inhibitory effect on SMO, which is in a complex with
  COS-2 and FU, allowing the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor GLI.
  Hippo signaling: Upon stimulation, the upstream regulators of hippo pathway (e.g.,
  FAT, NF2, and FDM6) activate the kinase complexes MST1/2-SVA1 and Lats1/2-Mob1,
  resulting in phosphorylation of the transcription factor YAP and preventing its
  nuclear translocation. Lymphotoxins and microbiota: The recognition of microbial
  ligands (LPS/PAMPs) by TLKRs (e.g., TLK4) on the hepatic stellate cells leads to
  activation of NF-kβ signaling and the consequent production of proinflammatory molecules,
  including cytokines and TNF-α.'
