caption: Quercetin induces tyrosinase and stress response proteins in melanocytic
  cells. Expression of tyrosinase in melanocytic cells is induced through the α-MSH
  pathway. Quercetin induces the expression of tyrosinase and several stress-responsive
  proteins, including NQO1 and p53. Tyrosinase oxidizes quercetin (red arrow) into
  an o-quinone and other reactive compounds that induce NQO1 and p53. NQO1 stabilizes
  p53 and can recycle activated quercetin back into the parent compound. Expression
  of p53 can also stimulate α-MSH activity completing a cyclical response to quercetin
  exposure. Open arrows indicate biochemical reactions. Closed arrows represent induction/stimulus.
