caption: Summary of the results obtained in our work with the indicated deacetylation-
  and acetylation-mimetic Vav1 mutants. The residues selected for our study are shown
  on top. Subclass A, B, and C sites are shown in red, green, and blue, respectively.
  Sites with no detectable effect on Vav1 activity are shown in black. The biological
  assays and mutants used are indicated on the left. Red and blue arrows indicate
  increased and decreased stimulation of the indicated pathway, respectively, when
  compared to the activity of Vav1WT. Empty circles indicate no statistically significant
  differences in activity when compared to Vav1WT. When using a double mutant protein,
  the arrow is placed between the two circles.
