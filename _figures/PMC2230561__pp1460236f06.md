caption: Overview of major metabolic pathways in response to PM in V. vinifera, as
  suggested by overall expression pattern of PM-responsive genes that are involved
  in primary and secondary biochemical pathways. Expression profile of each individual
  gene is presented in Supplemental Figure S3, A to E, indicated in parentheses as
  FS3A, B, C, D, and E for each major pathway. Pathways with transcripts that are
  up- or down-regulated are indicated with + or −. *, The HMG-CoA reductase gene that
  is also responsive to PM infection in V. aestivalis. Precursor metabolites are circled
  and end products are boxed.
