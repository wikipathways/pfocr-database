caption: 'Nishino et al () raise two questions: 1) whether inhibition of GSK is required
  for protection in mice, and 2) whether inhibition of GSK is protective in mouse
  hearts. Pre- and Post-conditioning activate a number of redundant signaling pathways
  that lead to inhibition of MPT. The relative importance of different pathways may
  vary depending on the model and species. Previous studies () have suggested that
  inhibition of GSK is a major signaling pathway that results in inhibition of MPT;
  this is illustrated with the large arrow. However other pathways exist and it is
  not surprising that under different conditions that these pathways can dominate.
  Also transgenic mice may have alterations in these signaling pathways that can alter
  the response. Based on the number of redundant pathways, it is not surprising that
  conditions occur where a particular kinase is not required for protection. However,
  Nishino et al () also report that direct inhibition of GSK was not protective in
  mouse. This result is surprising since GSK inhibitors protect in other species.
  This result also conflicts with recent report by Gomez et al () who found that inhibitors
  of GSK reduced infarct size in mouse heart.'
