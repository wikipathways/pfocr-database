caption: Model of the signaling pathways controlling redox regulation of starch biosynthesis.
  Light activation of starch synthesis involves post-translational redox activation
  of AGPase in the chloroplast via the Fdx/Trx f system (, ). NTRC, containing both
  a NADP-Trx reductase and a Trx in a single polypeptide, serves as an alternative
  system for transferring reducing equivalents from NADPH to AGPase, thereby enhancing
  storage starch synthesis (, ). In the light, NTRC is mainly linked to photoreduced
  Fdx via Fdx-NADP reductase (FNR) and complements the FTR/Trx system in activating
  AGPase. In the dark or in non-photosynthetic tissues, NTRC is primarily linked to
  NADPH provided by sugar oxidation via the initial reactions of the oxidative pentose
  phosphate pathway (OPP) and in this way, regulates AGPase independently of the Fdx/Trx
  system. The role of the OPP in regulating starch synthesis has been recently confirmed
  (). There is also evidence that alterations in mitochondrial redox status are transmitted
  to the plastid via the malate valve (), leading to changes in redox activation of
  AGPase and starch synthesis () (). Redox activation of AGPase is also promoted by
  sugars, involving cytosolic sugar signaling components such as trehalose-6-phosphate
  (Tre6P) and SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK1), although the underlying mechanisms
  have not yet been resolved (, , , ). For Abbreviations, see Abbreviations Used secton.
