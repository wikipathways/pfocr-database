caption: A presumed model for the action of EPEC type III effectors in host cells.
  EPEC injects the effectors (e.g., Tir, EspF, EspG, and the EspG homolog Orf3) via
  a type III secretion machinery into the host cells. The interaction of a bacterial
  membrane protein, intimin, and translocated Tir triggers the host signal transduction
  pathway, which includes the recruitment of Nck, N-WASP, and the Arp2/3 complex,
  resulting in the formation of a pedestal structure beneath the adherent bacteria.
  On the other hand, it is possible that EspF and EspG/Orf3 influence the function
  of cell junctions (CJs). Although the precise function of EspF is not clear at present,
  EspF is known to exert an effect on the morphology of tight junction strands. EspG
  and Orf3 associate with tubulins, resulting in the disruption of microtubule networks.
  GEF-H1 switches to the active form as a result of its dissociation from microtubule
  networks. Activated GEF-H1 promotes the binding of GTP to RhoA, resulting in the
  activation of RhoA. Finally, the activation of ROCK, which is located downstream
  of the RhoA signal, induces actin stress fiber assembly and probably exerts influence
  on paracellular permeability in EPEC-infected cells.
