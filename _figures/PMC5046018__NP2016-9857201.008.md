caption: Potential BDNF-dependent and BDNF-independent mechanisms of pain in uninjured
  and injured spinal cord. (a) In the absence of SCI, BDNF-mediated effects contribute
  to pain. Constitutive increases in BDNF and TrkB expression activate MAPK/ERK and
  PLC-PKC kinase pathways, which in turn leads to transcription of pain genes and
  posttranslational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation of glutamate receptors).
  (b) In the acute stage of SCI, both BDNF and TrkB levels are decreased in the spinal
  cord dorsal horn []. However, during this stage, MAPK/ERK pathways could be activated
  by BDNF-independent mechanisms, presumably an alternate pathway such as the TNFα
  pathway (both TNFα and TNR1 expressions are upregulated by SCI []). A decrease in
  KCC2 by SCI which alters GABA-mediated chloride function is likely to also contribute
  to pain after SCI. (c) During the chronic stage of injury, pERK levels are increased
  [, ], which may result from increases in both BDNF-TrkB signaling and TNFα-TNFR
  signaling. Activation of these pathways could consequently increase kinase activity
  and the transition of pain genes. Overall, we propose that although BDNF may not
  necessarily initiate pain-producing pathway after SCI, it is likely to contribute
  to pain hypersensitivity during the chronic stages of injury.
