caption: Possible mechanism to block the P2X7 receptor and inhibit the Warburg effect
  through RA action. Since ionotropic purine receptor P2X type 7 (P2X7) is prevented
  from ATP-ligand by RA blocking, uptake of calcium ion (Ca2+) is decreased and oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the mitochondria downregulates ATP generation and release.
  In addition, the blocked P2X7 inhibits the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K–AKT)
  pathway, which downregulates the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) in
  the plasma membrane with a reduction of glucose intake and mitigates pH acidification
  in TME due to lactate release by monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) from the aerobic
  glycolysis cascade. With pH regulated, there is chemiotaxis of the immune cells
  as DCs and macrophages, and a reduction in the secretion of cytokine IL-10 with
  inhibition of tumor progression. At the same time, with PI3K–AKT inhibition, there
  is no stimulus of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and, consequently, a reduction
  in mitogenic/angiogenic inductors
