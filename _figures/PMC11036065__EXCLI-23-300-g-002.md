caption: 'Various signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis and therapeutic
  strategies of cSCC. (A) RAS signaling pathway, there are two key pathways involved:
  the MAP kinase pathway and the PI3K pathway. These regulate the cell cycle, death
  of cells, cell metabolism, and the production of proteins. Green arrows represent
  activation, whereas red lines represent inhibition. (B) The route of Wnt signaling.
  Catenin, a critical component of the Wnt pathway, has two roles. It functions as
  a transcriptional activator in the nucleus, regulating development of cell, as well
  as a component of cell adhesion junctions. (C) The Hedgehog route. The reaction
  of hedgehog ligands with the receptors in the membrane. (D) Notch Pathway. Cell-to-cell
  contact is required for Notch signaling. Notch ligands on a neighboring cell bind
  to Notch, leading it to undergo degradation by two proteases. This results in the
  release of the Notch cytoplasmic domain, which then migrates to the nucleus to communicate
  with transcription factors, reproduced with permission from reference (Juliano,
  2020).'
