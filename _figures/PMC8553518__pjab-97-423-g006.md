caption: The CD38-cADPR signal system for insulin secretion by glucose stimulation
  in β-cells (adapted from Ref. ). Shown in red is the regulatory pathway for glucose-induced
  insulin secretion via the CD38-cADPR signal system. ATP competes with cADPR for
  the binding site (Lys-129, see also Section 5.2), inhibiting the cADPR hydrolysis
  which causes the accumulation of cADPR. cADPR binds to FKBP12.6 to release Ca2+,
  dissociating FKBP12.6 from RyR. CaM kinase II phosphorylates RyR to sensitize and
  activate the Ca2+ channel (Pi, phosphorylation). Ca2+, released from intracellular
  stores and/or supplied from extracellular sources, further activates CaM kinase
  II and amplifies the process. In this way, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release may be explained.)
  The conventional insulin secretion mechanism by Ca2+ influx from extracellular sources
  is shown in black. CaM, calmodulin; RyR, ryanodine receptor; ADPR, ADP-ribose; A-kinase,
  cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.
