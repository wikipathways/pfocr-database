caption: The diagram describes the neural pathway for the exercise pressor reflex.
  Interstitial ATP, H+, and phosphate are increased in exercising muscle. P2X, TRPV1,
  and ASIC mediate the muscle metabolite-induced reflex responses. In peripheral artery
  disease (PAD), those receptors in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are altered, which
  likely leads to abnormal cardiovascular responses during exercise. Note that the
  whole cell patch clamp methods are used to characterize receptor responsiveness
  in the primary afferent neuron of control rats and PAD rats. Those receptors appear
  at the peripheral terminals and cell body of the DRG (sensory afferent neurons).
  The receptor activity in the DRG cell body can be used to reflect its effect in
  the nerve endings. TRPV1, transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1; ASIC, acid
  sensing ion channel; SNA, sympathetic nerve activity; ABP, arterial blood pressure;
  HR, heart rate.
