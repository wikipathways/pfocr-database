caption: RAN regulation pathway constituents exhibiting abundance changes, with a
  figure adapted from the GeneGo MetaCore database. In this pathway, importin subunits
  α4, α6, β1, and β3 as well as nuclear transport factor 2 and sentrin, were down-regulated
  at 36 h p.i., as indicated by the green arrows. At the same time, Ran GTPase and
  the intranuclear filament TPR were up-regulated, as indicated by the red arrows.
