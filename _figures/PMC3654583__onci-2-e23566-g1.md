caption: Figure 1. Signaling pathway for HVJ-E-mediated anti-tumor effects. Upon fusion
  with the plasma membrane, the hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope (HVJ-E) introduces
  fragments of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm, which are recognized by retinoic
  acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). The RIG-I/RNA complex associates with the mitochondrial
  antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, which in turn promotes the activation of several
  transcription factors. In cells from the immune system, the RIG-I/MAVS pathway stimulate
  antitumor immunity via the production of some cytokines such as interferon (IFN)α,
  IFNβ and CXCL10. In cancer cells, this signaling pathway induces apoptosis upon
  the activation of pro-apoptotic factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand (TRAIL) and NOXA.
