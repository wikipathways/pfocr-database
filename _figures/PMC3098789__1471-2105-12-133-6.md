caption: 'Portion of the ''Toll-like Receptor Signaling'' pathway for two representative
  cell lines. Rectangles represent molecules, circles represent interactions. Molecular
  expression is represented by shading of molecule nodes: white = lowest expression,
  bright turquoise = highest expression. Molecules with copy number alterations are
  outlined in yellow. Interaction activity is represented by circle size: large circle
  = high activity, small circle = low activity. Interaction consistency is represented
  by arrow color: bright blue: high consistency, dark green: low consistency.'
