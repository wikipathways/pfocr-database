caption: Proposed functions of the four plastidic PT proteins. The TPT mediates the
  export of carbon from the Calvin cycle in the form of triose phosphates that can
  be converted to PEP by glycolytic sequences in the cytosol. PEP is imported into
  the plastids via the PPT to provide the substrate for the shikimic acid pathway.
  The GPT imports Glc-6-P into the plastids for the syntheses of starch and fatty
  acids (not shown) and as a substrate for the OPPP yielding triose phosphates. Triose
  phosphates can serve as a counter-substrate of either the GPT or the XPT. The XPT
  provides the plastids with Xul-5-P, which is produced in the cytosol from Glc-6-P
  by the oxidative branch of the OPPP and via RPEase/RPI. Xul-5-P can be used to replenish
  both the Calvin cycle and the OPPP.
