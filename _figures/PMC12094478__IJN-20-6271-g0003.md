caption: 'The mechanism of EVs in AKI. IRI-AKI: After using AIEgens to treat MSC-EVs,
  MSC-EVs-transferred miRNA-200a-p activated the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway in TECs,
  thereby restoring renal function in IRI-AKI mice. S-AKI: FRC-EVs were modified with
  LTH-targeting peptides to navigate EVs to tubule cells, and CD5L in EVs was released
  into tubule cells to promote mitophagy, inhibit pyroptosis, and thus improve kidney
  injury. CDDP-AKI: The crosstalk between macrophages and TECs promotes disease progression
  in a CDDP-AKI mouse model, and autophagy-deficient macrophage (Atg7Δmye mice derived
  macrophage)-derived EVs damage the mitochondria of TECs in vitro, which possibly
  through the miR-195a-5p-SIRT3 axis. Created in BioRender. Yan, Q. (2025) https://BioRender.com/x59y496'
