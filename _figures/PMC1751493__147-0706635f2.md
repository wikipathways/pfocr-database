caption: In normal prostate epithelial cells (a), TGF-β binds to the TβRI and TβRII
  receptors, activating the SMAD signalling pathway and inducing the transcription
  of IGFBP-3 and other regulatory genes. Some of these genes inactivate IGF-1 and
  (b) prevent it from binding to IGF receptors on adjacent cells. Loss of IGF signalling
  inactivates specific cell survival pathways, leading to apoptosis. (b) Downregulation/loss
  of TβRII, severely limits the anti-growth regulatory activity of TGF-β. Positive
  growth factors, like IGF, become active and bind to their receptors – initiating
  cell survival and proliferation pathways. TGF-β/IGF-1 crosstalk in normal and malignant
  prostate.
