caption: Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The first step in inflammasome activation
  is initiation. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from
  periodontal pathogens, triggering the NF-κB signaling pathway. This leads to an
  increase in the gene expression of NLRP3 and the precursors of interleukin-1 beta
  (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). The second step is activation. A number of activation
  signals have been identified, including ATP activating the P2X7 receptor, mitochondrial
  damage, lysosomal rupture, and pore-forming toxins. These signals cause NLRP3 proteins
  to aggregate and assemble with the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like
  protein containing a CARD) and caspase-1, which contains a cysteine protease activation
  domain, forming the inflammasome. Once the inflammasome is activated, caspase-1
  is also activated, cleaving the precursors of IL-1β and IL-18 into their active
  forms
