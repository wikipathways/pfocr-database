caption: Basic TGFβ signaling diagram along with a program of TGFβ-regulated genes
  that contribute to the EMT. Left side, the extracellular dimeric TGFβ ligand is
  shown to bind to its plasma membrane receptors, the type II and type I receptors
  (each drawn as a dimer), causing trans-phosphorylation (circled P) of the type I
  receptor by the type II receptor. The type II receptor phosphorylates the polarity
  protein Par6, which recruits the ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 and regulates RhoA-dependent
  actin assembly and tight junction disassembly. The type I receptor also recruits
  the ubiquitin ligases TRAF4 and TRAF6, which activate the MAP-kinase pathway by
  ubiquitination, leading to the transcription factor phosphorylation. The type I
  receptor kinase also phosphorylates R-Smads, which form complexes with the Co-Smad,
  Smad4. In the nucleus, Smad complexes and cooperating transcription factors bound
  to various genes, along with co-repressors (co-activators) either repress the expression
  of epithelial genes or induce the expression of mesenchymal genes. Right side, a
  summary of the TGFβ-regulated EMT program divided into seven subprograms, each enlisting
  only a small representative example of genes that are involved in the EMT and cell
  motility. Signaling flow is indicated by black arrows (positive flow) and red T-bars
  (negative regulation); on the gene transcriptional start site, a red T-bar indicates
  negative regulation and a blue arrow indicates positive regulation of transcription.
