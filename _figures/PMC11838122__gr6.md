caption: The hypothetical metabolic pathway responsible for the enrichment of volatiles
  is involved in M. For the whole, the compounds frame in red represents up-regrated
  relative content, the compounds frame in tawny represents the down-regrated relative
  content, while the substances without frames are the intermediate metabolites in
  the metabolic pathway. Red frames represent metabolic pathways uniquely involved
  in M; The green frames represent metabolic pathways where M and S overlap; the yellow
  frames represent intermediate metabolic pathways important in M. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
