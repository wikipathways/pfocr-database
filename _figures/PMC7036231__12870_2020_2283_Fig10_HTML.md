caption: Phenylpropanoids metabolism pathway in stylo roots response to low P stress.
  The pathway was designed based on KEGG pathway database. The light red, blue, yellow
  and grey colors indicate up-regulated, down-regulated, no response and no identified
  metabolites in metabolome, respectively. The solid arrows show direct steps in the
  pathway, whereas dotted arrows represent indirect and speculated steps in the pathway
papertitle: Metabolic alterations provide insights into Stylosanthes roots responding
  to phosphorus deficiency.
