caption: Schematic representation of the distribution of substrate over biomass, glycerol,
  ethanol and CO2 in anaerobically growing S. cerevisiae. NADH/NAD+ redox-cofactor
  coupling and use of ATP for sugar phosphorylation, biomass formation and maintenance
  are indicated by dotted and dashed arrows, respectively. Glucose, fructose and (after
  hydrolysis) sucrose are converted into pyruvate via the Emden-Meyerhoff glycolysis,
  yielding 2 NADH and 2 ATP per glucose equivalent. ATP is used for cellular maintenance
  and synthesis of biomass (growth). NADH is primarily re-oxidized via alcoholic fermentation,
  but a surplus of NADH formed during biomass synthesis is re-oxidized via the production
  of glycerol.
