caption: Schematic representation of cell-to-cell transmission, internalization, and
  trafficking of α-synuclein and therapeutic targets along the pathways. Molecular
  mechanisms summarized in the context of neuron-neuron and neuron-glial transmission.
  (A) Secretion and exosome-mediated release of asyn from neurons and (B) activated
  microglia contributes to the spread of asyn. (C) Inhibitors of microgliosis and
  toll-like receptors reduce pathological transmission of asyn. Transmission of asyn
  is also mediated through direct cell-to-cell contact through (D) gap junctions and
  (E) tunneling nanotubes. Internalization of asyn occurs through (F) endocytosis,
  (G) macropinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis which can be targeted to
  attenuate the transmission of asyn. (H) Once internalized, asyn localizes to the
  endosomal compartments where it is degraded by the autophagosome-lysosome pathway.
  Drugs that upregulate autophagy or restore lysosome function can promote the clearance
  of asyn and prevent its accumulation. (I) Internalized asyn fibrils can rupture
  endocytic vesicles, enter the cytosolic compartment, and induce templated misfolding
  of native asyn. (J) Antibodies can bind and sequester extracellular asyn. (K) Antibody
  fragments can be expressed inside the cell and bind to and enhance turnover of intracellular
  asyn. (L,M) Compounds can inhibit asyn from misfolding and aggregating as well as
  (N) inhibit lipid-induced asyn aggregation by displacing it from the membrane. The
  therapeutic targets and drugs are listed in .
