caption: Metabolic Therapy targeting SREBP and LXRs in GBM. SREBPs enter the nucleus
  to activate the transcription of adipose synthase (ACC, FAS, SCD-1) and cholesterol
  synthesis-related genes (HMGCS, HMGCR, SQS) and promote uptake of cholesterol (LDLR)
  to promote the elevation of cellular lipids and steroids. SREBP is upregulated by
  S1P, SOAT1, SIRT1 and downregulated by quercetin, phytol, retinol and miR-29. PF-429242,
  Avasimibe, MicroRNA-132 can inhibit the SERBP pathway by inhibiting S1P, SOAT1,
  and SIRT1, respectively. The LXR transcriptional network drives cholesterol efflux
  by ABCA1, ABCG1 and reduces cholesterol influx by mediating the degradation of LDLR
  through the induction of IDOL. LXR is activated by oxysterols, 24,25-epoxycholesterol
  and compounds LXR-623, GW3965,4-7rr, 4-13, 4-13rr. YTHDF2 upregulated by EGFR/SRC/ERK
  signaling suppresses LXR. Efavirenz inhibits LXR by promoting CYP46A1.
