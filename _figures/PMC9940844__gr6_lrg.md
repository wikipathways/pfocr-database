  []. Fosmanogepix (APX001) targets GWT1 protein, which modulates glycosyl phosphatidylinositol
  (GPI) post-translational modification pathway and inhibits inositol acylation in
  the fungal cell membrane []. bycA mRNA is the negative regulator for hyphal growth
  that, in turn, is inhibited by calcineurin. Thus, calcineurin is the positive regulator
  for hyphal growth and the introduction of virulent traits []. Calcineurin inhibitors
  block calcineurin and appear likely to be a potential futuristic drug for mucormycosis
  infection. Additionally, ergosterol is the primary factor acting to induce the expression
  of virulent fungal traits []. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase acting in the mevalonate
  pathway, as well as ergosterol synthesis []. VT-1161 inhibits fungal CYP51 and blocks
  ergosterol synthesis [] Anti-CotH antibody targets CotH proteins which are widely
  present in the Mucorales surface and prevents invasion augmenting opsonophagocytosis.
