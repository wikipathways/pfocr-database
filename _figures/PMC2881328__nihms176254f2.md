caption: B) Dietary folate and B12 facilitate the conversion of HCY to methionine,
  which is then converted to SAM. SAM can also be directly supplemented. SAM provides
  methyl groups for transfer to DNA by DNA methylases and is converted to S–adenosylhomocysteine
  in the process. Low levels of HCY drive conversion of S–adenosylhomocysteine to
  HCY, which is then reconverted to methionine. A) Pathogenic (reverse) pathway. Lack
  of folate and B12 permit accumulation of homocysteine (HCY), which is converted
  to S–adenosylhomocysteine. High levels of S–adenosylhomocysteine block transfer
  of methyl groups from S–adenylmethionine (SAM) to DNA or other substrates.
