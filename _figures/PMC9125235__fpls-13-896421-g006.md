caption: 'Schematic diagram of main branches of flavonoid biosynthesis in hickory
  fruit development and expression levels of different enzymes involved in the flavonoid
  biosynthesis pathway. Note: The FPKM of the above-mentioned differential genes was
  normalized by Log2, and the average value of 19 genes encoding UGT enzyme was taken.
  The eight squares of each enzyme were corresponding to exocarp and embryo of hickory
  fruit at four developmental stages, respectively, 85d, 100d, 109d, and 127d after
  pollination from top to bottom, with exocarp on the left and embryo on the right.'
