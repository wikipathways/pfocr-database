caption: a| Moraxella catarrhalis and Neisseria meningitidis use specific virulence
  proteins to activate carcinoembryonic antigen–related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1),
  which co-associates with and inhibits Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) signalling. The
  underlying crosstalk involves phosphorylation of the CEACAM1 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  inhibitory motif (ITIM), which recruits Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine
  phosphatase 1 (SHP1); this suppresses the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3
  kinase (PI3K) and downstream activation of the AKT-mediated pro-inflammatory pathway.
  b| Serotypes of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) bind sialic acid-recognizing immunoglobulin-superfamily
  lectins (Siglecs), either through molecular mimicry of host sialylated glycans or
  through a cell wall-anchored protein. GBS activation of ITIM-bearing Siglec-5 or
  Siglec-9 activates inhibitory SHP2–dependent signals that interfere with cellular
  activation and antimicrobial functions. c| Staphylococcus aureus uses the ITIM-containing
  paired Ig-like receptor B (PIR-B) to crosstalk with and inhibit the TLR2-induced
  inflammatory response, possibly by inhibiting the PI3K–AKT pathway. d| Human cytomegalovirus
  (HCMV) expresses an MHC class I homologue, UL18, which interacts with ILT2 and activates
  ITIM-dependent and SHP1–mediated signalling. This inhibits natural killer (NK) cell
  activating receptors, such as the NK group 2, member C (NKG2C)–CD94 complex, and
  interferes with NK cell-mediated cytolysis of the HCMV-infected cell. e| Upon activation
  by viruses, the ITIM-bearing DC immunoreceptor (DCIR) becomes internalized into
  endosomes and inhibits endosomal TLRs — specifically, it inhibits production of
  TLR8-induced interleukin-12 (IL-12) and TLR9-induced interferon-α (IFNα) in conventional
  and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, respectively. f| Escherichia coli evades macrophage
  receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO)-dependent phagocytic killing through
  an inhibitory crosstalk with FcγRIII. Specifically, nonopsonized E. coli binds with
  low-affinity to FcγRIII and induces partial phosphorylation of the FcRγ ITAM (ITAMi),
  leading to weak mobilization of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) but strong recruitment
  of SHP1. SHP1 dephosphorylates PI3K and impairs MARCO-dependent phagocytosis.
