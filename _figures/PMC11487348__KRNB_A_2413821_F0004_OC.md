caption: Proposed mechanism of ERα in PARN-mediated deadenylation. In the canonical
  signalling pathway, estrogen binds to ERα in the cytosol, leading to its dimerization,
  nuclear translocation and activation of transcription to regulate gene expression.
  More specifically, ERα can bind either directly to estrogen response elements (EREs)
  within the promoter region of its target genes to directly regulate transcription,
  or to co-factors, to indirectly regulate transcription of its targets. Here we show
  p53 as an example of a cofactor. We propose a novel transactivation-independent
  mechanism of ERα to regulate gene expression by activating PARN deadenylase. In
  ERα(+) breast cancer cells, ERα can form (a) complex(es) with 3’ processing factors,
  such as PARN and p53, and activate nuclear deadenylation of its mRNA targets. Alternatively,
  ERα might bind directly to the 3’UTR of these mRNA targets resulting in the recruitment
  of mRNA 3’ processing factors and activation of PARN deadenylase activity
