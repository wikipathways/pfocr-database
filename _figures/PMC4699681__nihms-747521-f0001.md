caption: Signaling pathways activated in chondrocytes by fibronectin fragments. This
  figure only shows proteins studied to date in adult articular chondrocytes and is
  not a complete representation of all integrin signaling proteins. Peptides and fibronectin
  fragments containing the RGD cell binding sequence can bind to the α5β1 integrin
  and initiate a cell signaling cascade that results in increased expression of a
  host of pro-inflammatory mediators and matrix degrading enzymes. Fibronectin fragments
  such as the 29 kD N-terminal fragment which does not have an RGD sequence also appear
  to bind to and signal through the α5β1 integrin. Reactive oxygen species and the
  small GTPase Rac1 are required for the activation of gene expression but it is not
  clear precisely where in the pathway they act.

  description: Signaling pathways activated in chondrocytes by fibronectin fragments.
    This figure only shows proteins studied to date in adult articular chondrocytes

    and fibronectin fragments containing the RGD cell binding sequence can bind to
    the α5β1 integrin and initiate a cell signaling cascade that results in increased
    expression of a host of pro-inflammatory mediators and matrix degrading enzymes.
    Fibronectin fragments such as the 29 kD N-terminal fragment which does not have

    oxygen species and the small GTPase Rac1 are required for the activation of gene
