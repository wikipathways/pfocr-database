caption: Signal transduction mediated by BCR, FcRL1, CD19, and BCMA receptors on B-cells.
  Upon antigen binding, BCRs oligomerize into micro-clusters, which is paralleled
  by the simultaneous tyrosine phosphorylation of ITAMs in the cytoplasmic domains
  of the CD79A–CD79B heterodimers. This phosphorylation is mediated by Src family
  kinases, including Lyn, which are rapidly recruited following antigen binding. The
  phosphorylated ITAMs provide docking sites for the recruitment and activation of
  Syk. Syk subsequently phosphorylates and transactivates a series of downstream signaling
  molecules, which include PLC-γ2, BTK, and Vav. These enzymes work together with
  adaptor molecules like BLNK and BCAP to constitute a highly organized and dynamic
  signaling complex called the membrane proximal signalosome derived from Syk. CD19
  also recruits the p85α/p110δ isoform of PI3K, acting to catalyze the conversion
  of PIP2 to PIP3. The balance between PIP2 and PIP3 is tightly regulated through
  the opposing effect of PI3K and the phosphatase and tensin homolog (pPTEN). This
  equilibrium is critical in modulating B-cell activation and remodeling of F-actin
  cytoskeleton by Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and neuronal WASP (N-WASP).
  WASP- and N-WASP-mediated actin reassembly and reorganization are responsible for
  B-cell spreading and BCR cluster formation. CD19 can independently trigger intracellular
  Ca2+ flux upon ligation by associating with CD21, CD81, and Leu13 to form a signal
  transduction complex that functions autonomously from the BCR complex. The resulting
  intracellular Ca2+ flux regulates downstream gene expression via the calcineurin/nuclear
  factor of an activated T-cell (NFAT) signaling pathway. BCR cross-linking alone
  resulted in phosphorylation of the intracellular Y281ENV motif of FcRL1, providing
  a docking site for c-Abl, an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing kinase. The
  c-Abl can directly interact with tyrosine 211 (Y211) phosphorylated proliferating
  cell nuclear antigen(pPCNA) to modulate cell proliferation and cytoskeletal rearrangement.
  pPCNA at tyrosine 211 (Y211) promoted its association with the non-receptor tyrosine
  kinase c-Abl. On the other hand, phosphorylation of the intracellular Y281ENV motif
  of FcRL1 can recruit molecular complexes such as growth-factor receptor-bound protein-2
  (GRB2), son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1), and SH2 domain-containing inositol polyphosphate
  5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP-1) and negatively regulate the phosphorylation of ERK. A-proliferation
  inducing ligand (APRIL) is the specific receptor for BCMA, transmembrane activator,
  calcium modulator, and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI). BCMA/TACI signaling
  activates NF-κB signaling and up-regulates key cell cycle regulators (e.g., CCND1/2),
  anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Mcl1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, BIRC3), osteoclast promoting
  factors (e.g., CCL3/4, SDF-1) and adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM-1, CD44). The APRIL/BCMA/TACI
  signaling cascade also triggers key immunosuppressive factors (e.g., IL-10, PD-L1,
  TGF-β, VEGF)
