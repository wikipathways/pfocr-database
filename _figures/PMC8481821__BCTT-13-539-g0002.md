caption: Schematic adaptation of major components of the HER-signaling pathway. Ligand
  binding is believed to prompt dimerization initially followed by phosphorylated-activation
  of the receptors. The simple construct depicted by the linear alignment of the cytoplasmic
  components enshrouds a highly complex network responsible for transmitting externally
  derived stimuli to the internal nuclear apparatus. The ultimate cellular response
  depends on signal propagation which can be influenced by feedback loops, inter-pathway
  communications, pro- and counter-regulatory proteins as well as somatic kinase mutations.
  The RAS pathway is complicated as the kinase is a GTP-binding protein which must
  undergo post-translational modification before it can be activated. Binding of RAS
  to phospho-HER2 requires two adaptor molecules, Shc and GRB2. The latter forms a
  complex with SoS which is recruited to the plasma membrane leading to activation
  of RAS. Downstream effectors of the RAS signal transduction pathway include soluble
  RAF, MEK, ERK1/2, and SEK. Translocation of ERK1/2 upregulates c-Myc and Elk-1;
  Elk-1 is a transcription factor that activates c-Fos, a nuclear proto-oncogene that
  modulates expression of cyclin-dependent kinases. A second major signaling pathway
  includes PI3K which is activated by binding preferentially to phospho-HER3. Extracellular
  signal propagation involves AKT, mTOR, and S6K, three intrinsic elements, with outreach
  that can influence apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell migration, cell cycle and even
  other receptor signaling pathways including ER. Of biological and [potential] clinical
  importance is the finding that ER can contribute HER2 resistance by downregulating
  HER2 expression and upregulating expression of IGFR1. Furthermore, by interacting
  with receptor-bound HER2, ER can also activate the MAPK signaling pathway which
  may be one mechanism of endocrine resistance. Interestingly, AKT appears to be a
  key regulator of ER gene transcription via interactions with FOXO3a and NFκB.

  description: Schematic adaptation of major components of the HER-signaling pathway.
    Ligand binding is believed to prompt dimerization initially followed by phosphorylated-activation

    Binding of RAS to phospho-HER2 requires two adaptor molecules, Shc and GRB2. The
