caption: Comprehensive analysis of metabolomics and network pharmacology. (A) “Potential
  metabolite–reaction–enzyme–gene” interaction network. Red hexagons represent metabolites,
  gray diamonds represent reactions, green rectangles represent enzymes, purple circles
  represent genes, and blue circles represent core genes. (B) Enrichment analysis
  of metabolite–target network. The larger the circle, the higher the impact value
  of the metabolite in the pathway. The color indicates the significance level (p-value)
  of the metabolite, with darker colors representing smaller p-values. (C) “Compound–target–metabolites–AA
  metabolic pathway” network. The size of the circle is usually related to the Pathway
  Impact Value of the metabolite
