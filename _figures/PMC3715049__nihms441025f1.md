caption: Proteomic strategies for studying the mechanism of miRNA processing and miRNA-mediated
  translation repression. Genes encoding miRNAs are transcribed as pri-miRNAs by RNA
  polymerase II and processed by the microprocessor complex consisting of Drosha and
  DGCR8. This complex cleaves pri-miRNAs into ∼60–80 nt hairpin structures, called
  pre-miRNAs, which are transported out of nucleus by exportin-5. In the cytoplasm,
  Dicer associates with TRBP and excises the loop portion of pre-miRNAs generating
  double stranded mature miRNAs. These are loaded onto RNA interference silencing
  complex (RISC) consisting of Argonaute and TNRC6. Translation inhibition is brought
  about by base-pairing of guide strand miRNA to the 3′UTR of mRNA and interfering
  with translation initiation. Quantitative proteomics analyses encompass different
  categories of strategies including chemical labeling, metabolic labeling, label-free
  methods and targeted proteomics. Among them, iTRAQ and SILAC are the most frequently
  used. Along with various techniques in qualitative proteomics, these methods can
  enable not only characterization of the miRNA processing pathway components and
  their posttranslational modifications but also discovery of miRNA targets.
