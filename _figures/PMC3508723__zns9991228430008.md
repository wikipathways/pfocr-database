caption: Model of Tat/β-catenin interaction in astrocytes. β-Catenin and TCF-4 repress
  basal and Tat transactivation of the HIV LTR through distinct mechanisms and are
  in turn antagonized by HIV Tat. a, Under basal LTR activity (without significant
  Tat level), the TCF-4/β-catenin/SMAR1 complex represses LTR activity and transcription
  is low or silent. Low levels of Tat may be produced but are primarily retained in
  the cytoplasm by association with TCF-4. b, When β-catenin signaling is disrupted
  by proinflammatory mediators (IFN-γ) or any other signal that downregulates the
  β-catenin pathway, this complex is disrupted and LTR activity increases. Once the
  level of Tat reaches a certain threshold, Tat will (1) transactivate the HIV LTR
  by inducing chromatin remodeling and recruiting positive transcription elongation
  factor b (pTEFb), allowing for efficient viral replication; and (2) antagonize β-catenin
  signaling through mutual binding/inhibition with TCF-4 and enhanced degradation
  of β-catenin to maintain a permissive state for HIV replication. The broader biological
  consequences of productive infection in astrocytes include raising the CNS viral
  load and increasing production of neurotoxic HIV proteins (Tat, gp120, Vpr), potentially
  leading to neuronal injury and neuroinflammation.
