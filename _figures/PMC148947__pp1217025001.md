caption: Pathway for synthesis of Met, SAM, and Thr. The pathway is as described in
  the text. SMM, S-methyl-Met; THF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; SAM, S-adenosyl-l-Met;
  CGS, cystathionine γ-synthase; TS, Thr synthase. Solid arrows refer to enzymatic
  steps and dotted arrows refer to regulatory steps. The arrow from Asp to OPH represents
  four enzymatic steps.
