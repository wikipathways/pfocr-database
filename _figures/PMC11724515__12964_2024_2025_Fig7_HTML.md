caption: 'SIRT1/6 plays a role in maintaining homeostasis in the gut, which helps
  to resist the development of obesity and osteoporosis. Intestinal flora regulates
  secondary bile acid metabolism and directly alters SIRT1 and FXR expression. When
  the intestinal flora is unbalanced, the expression of FXR signal is decreased, which
  affects the synthesis of bile acids and fat metabolism, leading to fat accumulation.
  Changes in Intestinal flora induced by resveratrol can induce WAT “browning”. Intestinal
  flora increases the level of TUG1 and regulates the expression of SIRT1 in a Mir-138-dependent
  manner to regulate osteogenic ability and maintain the number of osteoblasts. The
  expression of TNF-α in healthy intestinal flora is decreased, accompanied by a decrease
  in the number of osteoclasts and an increase in bone quality. When SIRT6 is overexpressed,
  it also inhibits TNF-α, inhibits NF-κB, and decreases osteoclasts. The imbalance
  of intestinal flora can cause the increase of circulating TMAO and oxidative stress,
  inhibit the expression of SIRT6, and promote the generation of osteoclasts and inhibit
  the generation of osteoblasts by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading
  to osteoporosis. Abbreviation: FXR, farnesoid X receptor; HNF-1α, Hepatocyte Nuclear
  Factor 1α; TUG1, taurineupregulated gene 1; TMAO, trimethylamine N-oxide; TNF-α,
