caption: 'Activation of the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is
  activated in two steps. Signal 1: microbial ligands are recognized by TLR that leads
  to NF-κB pathway activation and pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 up-regulation. Signal 2:
  involves different PAMPs, DAMPs, ATP, and particulates that promote lysosomal damage,
  mitochondrial ROS production or K+ efflux, resulting in NLRP3 inflammasome complex
  assembly and activation. The NLRP3 inflammasome interacts with pro-caspase-1 and
  promotes its conversion into caspase-1, which catalyzes the proteolytic cleavage
  of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, resulting in active IL-1β and IL-18. IL-1β and IL-18
  are released into the extracellular space. NLRP3: Nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like
  receptor protein 3. TLR, Toll like receptor; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa Beta; pro-IL-1β,
  pro-interleukin 1 beta; pro-IL-18, pro-interleukin 18; PAMPs, pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns; DAMPs, danger-associated molecular patterns; and ROS, Reactive
  Oxygen Species. Some parts of this figure are from SMART Service Medical Art (Smart.servier.com).'
