caption: 'Uncoupling proteins are likely to be controlled at multiple levels, such
  as transcription, translocation, ligand activation or inhibition and protein turnover.
  (a) (i) During adaptive thermogenesis in BAT, UCP1 synthesis is stimulated by transcription
  factors of the PKA and MAPK pathways. (ii) These pathways also induce lipolysis,
  which generates fatty acid (FA) ligands that activate UCP-mediated proton leak.
  (iii) Stimulation of β3-AR and insulin receptors also inhibit UCP1 and whole mitochondrial
  degradation by autophagic pathways. (b) UCP2 synthesis is regulated at the (i) transcriptional
  and (ii) translational levels. (iii) Protein activity can be further regulated by
  acute activators such as FA and HNE. (iv) Protein deactivation can occur by ligand
  inhibition and by rapid turnover of protein UCP2, probably by the ubiquitin proteasome
  system. (c) (i) UCP3 synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level by starvation
  and muscle transcription factors. (ii) Protein activity can be further regulated
  by functional ligands, such as FA and HNE. The mechanism of protein deactivation
  can occur by ligand inhibition. In (b) and (c), UCP2 and UCP3 turnover can also
  theoretically occur as the result of mitochondrial turnover via the lysosomal pathway,
  although this pathway is slow compared with the likely degradation via the proteasomal
  pathway. Abbreviations: ATF, activating transcription factor; CREB, cAMP response
  element binding; IR, insulin receptor; NE, norepinephrine; Δ ψ, mitochondrial membrane
  potential; C/EBPβ, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein-β; FA, fatty acid; HNF, hepatic
  nuclear factor; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor;
  SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c; MyoD, myogenic regulatory
  factor family protein.'
