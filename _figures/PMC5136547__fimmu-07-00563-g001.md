caption: Innate immune response against rotavirus in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).
  Rotavirus double-strand genomic RNA activates toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), retinoic
  acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5),
  which are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed in IECs. Cellular signaling
  cascades are activated and converge at the level of interferon (IFN) regulatory
  factor-3 (IRF3) that upregulate the expression of type I (IFN-α, IFN-β) and type
  III (IFNλ1, IFNλ2/3) IFN, which in turn induces the synthesis of IFN-stimulated
  genes with antiviral activities (MxA, Mx1, RNase L, OAS, PKR). Antiviral PRRs also
  activate nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway and induce the secretion of proinflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, CXCL10). Those effects could be imitated
  in vitro and in vivo by administration of the dsRNA synthetic analog poly(I:C).
