caption: NETs formation and its intrinsic immune regulation of NETs formation. (A)
  NETs formation and the inflammatory pathway intrinsic to neutrophils. NADPH or mitochondrial
  ROS stimulates the sequential activation of neutrophil MPO and NE, followed by NE
  entering intranucleus to cleave histones, combined with histone citrullination of
  PAD 4 promoting chromatin decondensation. Subsequently, under the pore-forming action
  of GSDMD, the DNA network within the nucleus binds a variety of proteins to release
  into the extracellular cell. This process is usually affected by the cGAS, NLRP
  3 signaling pathway. (B) The glucose metabolism in neutrophils. In the resting state,
  glycolysis is the primary way neutrophils acquire energy, where activated glycolysis
  is enhanced and a larger fraction of glucose enters the pentose phosphate pathway
  to support the ROS required to produce respiratory burst and NETs.

    (A) NETs formation and the inflammatory pathway intrinsic to neutrophils. NADPH

    In the resting state, glycolysis is the primary way neutrophils acquire energy,
    where activated glycolysis is enhanced and a larger fraction of glucose enters
    the pentose phosphate pathway to support the ROS required to produce respiratory
