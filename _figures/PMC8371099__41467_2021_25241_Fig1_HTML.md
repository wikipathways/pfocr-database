caption: 'Xylose is assimilated through the oxidoreductive pathway consisting of XR
  (xylose reductase), XDH (xylitol dehydrogenase), and XK (xylulose kinase). Acetate
  enters yeast cells through either Jen1p or Ady2p transporter and is converted into
  acetyl-CoA by ACS (acetyl-CoA synthase). TAL is synthesized through the condensation
  of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA by 2PS (2-pyrone synthase). Heterologous expression
  of CrtE (GGPP synthase), CrtYB (bifunctional phytoene synthase, lycopene cyclase),
  and CrtI (phytoene desaturase) in S. cerevisiae allows the production of β-carotene
  which is then cleaved into vitamin A by BCMO (β-carotene monooxygenase). Color code
  for arrows: gray, glucose metabolism; green, xylose metabolism; orange, acetate
  metabolism; black, other endogenous pathways; black in bold, reaction with strong
  flux; blue, heterologous TAL or vitamin A biosynthetic pathway.'
