caption: Physiological functions of PD-related Rabs. Intracellular vesicle trafficking
  pathways and several related Rab GTPases are presented in the above cell model.
  Rab1 facilitates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi trafficking. Rab3, accompanied
  by Rab8, mediates the trafficking from trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane.
  Rab5, serving as a key factor in the early endosome formation, is required for the
  transport of clathrin-dependent endosomes. Rab7 mediates the fusion of late endosomes
  and lysosomes, which plays an important role in the autophagy-lysosome pathway.
  Rab8 and Rab10 facilitate trafficking of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) to the
  plasma membrane. Rab13 regulates the junctions among epithelial cells. Rab11 and
  Rab35 regulate the recycling endosome trafficking. Rab7l1 plays a role in the trafficking
  from lysosome to TGN. Rab32 mediates the fission of mitochondria and the trafficking
  from TGN to melanosome.
