caption: Schematic representation of the proposed model. APPL is a novel regulator
  of Wnt-PCP pathway. In the presence of Wnt signaling, Fz binds Dsh, which needs
  to be phosphorylated by Abelson kinase to correctly relocalize to the membrane.
  We propose that Appl is part of the membrane complex formed by the core PCP proteins
  Fz1 and Vang. In turn, Appl recruits Abelson kinase to the complex and positively
  modulates Dsh phosphorylation. The subsequent activation of the signaling is required
  for MB β-axon growth.
