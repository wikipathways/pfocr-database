caption: 'Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors.
  Inhibitors of the Wnt signaling pathway mainly include sclerostin, DKK1, WIF1, and
  SFRPs. Among them, sclerostin and DKK1 can competitively bind to the co-receptor
  LRP5/6 in the Wnt signaling pathway and inactivate it by regulating the transcription
  of downstream target genes. SFRPs and WIF1 can directly interact with Wnt ligands,
  thereby blocking their binding and subsequently inactivating the Wnt signaling pathway
  through regulation of the transcription of downstream target genes, ultimately leading
  to the occurrence and development of osteoporosis. SFRP: Secreted frizzled-related
  proteins; DKK1: Dickkopf-1; LRP5/6: Lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6; WIF1:
  WNT inhibitory factor 1'
