caption: (A) E2 interacts with ERα locali zed at the neuronal (plasma) membrane and
  activates group 1 and group 2 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1a, mGluR2/3)
  signaling. Activation of mGluR1a causes Gαq stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC)
  which leads to MAPK-induced CREB phosphorylation. Activation of mGluR2/3 causes
  Gαi/o inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and PKA which reduces the activity of
  L-type calcium channels and leads to attenuated CREB phosphorylation.(B) E2 acts
  via GPR30 to promote EGF-receptor transactivation. This happens through a Gβγ-subunit
  pathway that promotes intracellular tyrosine kinase (Src)-mediated metalloproteinase
  (MMP)-dependent cleavage of proheparin-binding EGF (proHB-EGF) and release of HB-EGF
  from the cell surface. EGF redeptor transactivation leads to Ras-dependent ERK1/2
  activation and presumably CREB phosphorylation. E2 via GPR30 can also stimulate
  adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, which leads to PKA-mediated suppression of EGF-induced
  ERK1/2 activity.(C) E2 activates a membrane-associated ER (mER) that is Gαq -coupled
  to activation of phospholipase C that catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane-bound
  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3)
  and diacylglycerol (DAG). Calcium is released from intracellular stores (endoplasmic
  reticulum) by IP3, and DAG activates protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ). Through phosphorylation,
  adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity is upregulated by PKCδ. The generation of cAMP activates
  PKA, which can rapidly uncouple GABAB and μ-opioid (μ) receptors from their effector
  system through phosphorylation of a downstream effector molecule (e.g., G protein-coupled,
  inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channel). The mER-mediated modulation of kinase pathways
  reduces the capacity of neuromodulators such as GABA and β-endorphin (β-End) to
  inhibit POMC neuronal excitability. mER-mediated activation of PKA can lead to phosphorylation
  of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (pCREB), which can then alter gene transcription
  through its interaction with CREs on genes.
