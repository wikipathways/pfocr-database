caption: 'The SUMO pathway plays a crucial role in IBD: model representation of importance
  of SUMOylation in intestinal health and disease. Steady-state events of the healthy
  epithelium are represented on the left. A fine balance between SUMOylated and non-SUMOylated
  proteins is maintained. During the onset of disease, due to downregulation of the
  sole E2 SUMO conjugating enzyme Ubc9, the balance of SUMOylated and non-SUMOylated
  proteins is tilted as shown in the see-saw. This activates the NFκB signalling pathway
  via master signalling regulator Akt1. These changes results in upregulation of transcriptional
  factors like cFOS, cJUN, RelA, STAT1, BIRC3 (upward arrows). Release of chemokine
  IL-8/CXCL8 for neutrophil recruitment and lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine
  IL-10 and TSLP further aggravate the condition (severely inflamed cell on the right
  side). These events leads to compromised expression of wound-healing markers TNFAIP3
  and TNFAIP8 (downward arrows) leading to impaired wound healing.'
