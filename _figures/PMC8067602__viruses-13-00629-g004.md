caption: Necroptopic signaling pathway. TNFa is bound to the extracellular domain
  of the TNFR1. TNFR1 triggers downstream signaling by forming complex I with TRADD,
  FADD, RIP1, and several E3 ubiquitination ligases, TRAF2/5 and cIAP1/2. Deubiquitinated
  RIP1 is transferred from complex I to the cytoplasm and prompts the recruitment
  of complex Ia. Complex Ia is comprised of TRADD, FADD, RIP1 and caspase 8. Caspase
  8 is inhibited in complex Ib, allowing for RIP1 to bind to RIP3. Bound RIP3 recruits
  and phosphorylates MLKL. Activated MLKL disrupts the membrane leading to permeabilization,
  swelling and rupturing. Adapted from [,,,,]. Created with BioRender.com, accessed
