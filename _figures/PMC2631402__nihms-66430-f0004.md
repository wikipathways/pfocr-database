caption: After uptake into mammalian cells there is a response to L. pneumophila that
  threatens to terminate intracellular growth by causing host cell death. The cell
  death pathways have both necrotic as well as apoptotic character, and require the
  presence of an intact Dot/Icm translocation system. The individual L. pneumophila
  components or translocated substrates that cause cell death have not been identified.
  In addition, there are at least two translocated substrates that interfere with
  host cell death. SdhA is required to inhibit multiple pathways that lead to cell
  death after L. pneumophila contact with host cells, and its absence causes a defect
  in intracellular replication within macrophages. L. pneumophila also activates the
  host transcription factor NFκB to promote expression of anti-apoptotic genes to
  delay host cell death; however, the mechanism by which this occurs has not yet been
  determined. At later stages of infection, SidF directly inhibits an apoptotic pathway
  by interfering with pro-death proteins in the Rambo family. See text.
