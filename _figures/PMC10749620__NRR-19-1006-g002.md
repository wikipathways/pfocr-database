caption: 'NRF2 peptide with its seven Neh domains and their roles.The Neh2 domain
  contains two motifs (DLG and ETGE sequences) regulating the NRF2 stability through
  its binding site to KEAP1 protein and CUL3 ubiquitin ligase complex or to the Synoviolin
  E3 ubiquitin ligase (HDR1). The Neh3, Neh4, and Neh5 domains are necessary for the
  NRF2 interaction with other coactivators. The Neh7 domain allows NRF2 to bind the
  RXRα resulting in an inhibition of the NRF2-ARE signaling pathway. The Neh6 domain
  serves as a negative regulator by binding β-TrCP leading to NRF2 degradation. Finally,
  the Neh1 domain regulates DNA binding. Created with BioRender.com. β-TrCP: β-transducin
  repeat-containing protein; CUL3: Cullin3; KEAP1: Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
  1; Neh: NRF2-ECH Homology; NRF2: nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2; RBX1:
  recruiting ubiquitin enzyme E2; RXRα: retinoic X receptor alpha; Ub: ubiquitin.'
