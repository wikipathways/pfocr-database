caption: A, Established relationships between genes involved in response to hyperosmotic
  stress and heat shock. B, Putative interactomic network connecting established stress-response
  genes with PTM biogenetic enzymes. C, Known biogenetic enzymes (red boxes) for selected
  PTMs of interest (blue). Arrows indicate proven functional relationships. Vertical
  lines indicate possible functional links. Horizontal lines indicate possible co-expression.
  Light blue arrows and boxes identify the HOG1 → SSB1 → RIT1 pathway corroborated
  by gene deletion.
