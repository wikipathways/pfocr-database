caption: Schematic summary of stroke-induced dysregulation of the blood–CSF barrier
  via SPAK–NKCC1 signaling pathway. Ischemic stroke activation of SPAK–NKCC1 cascade
  in the ChP. Overstimulation of SPAK–NKCC1 signaling pathway activity leads to TJ
  damage, blood–CSF barrier dysfunction, and immune cell infiltration at the ChP.
  Ischemic reperfusion-mediated production of ROS can directedly activate SPAK–NKCC1
  cascade and MMP9 protein expression with NF-κB activation as an upstream mechanism.
  Pharmacological inhibition of the SPAK–NKCC1 cascade attenuates blood–CSF barrier
  damage and brain inflammation
