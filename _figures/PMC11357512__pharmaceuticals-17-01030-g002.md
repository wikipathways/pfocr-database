caption: Schematic diagram of signalling pathway in a cardiomyocyte with lamin A/C
  variant factors such as pERK1/2, pSmad1/2, and TEAD1 affect the gene expression
  of LMNA mutant cells. Dysregulation of gene expression from mutant alleles causes
  apoptosis and fibrosis. Also, activation of pMEK1/2 and pERK1/2 disrupts sarcomeres
  or mitochondria, resulting in contractile dysfunction or apoptosis of LMNA mutants,
  respectively (shown in A&B). Nonetheless, the signalling pathways in LMNA-mutant-affecting
  arrhythmias remain unclear
