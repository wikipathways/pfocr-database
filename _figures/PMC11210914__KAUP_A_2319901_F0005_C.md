caption: Mitophagy in ferroptosis. Mitophagy is a selective process that involves
  the autophagic clearance of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria. The PINK1-PRKN
  pathway is a well-studied regulatory pathway for mitophagy. In this pathway, PINK1
  recruits PRKN, which facilitates the degradation of mitochondria through mitophagy
  receptors such as FUNDC1. Mitochondrial fission induced by DNM1L/Drp1 can promote
  mitophagy-dependent ferroptosis. Additionally, the mitochondrial protein FTMT inhibits
  ROS production and ferroptosis
