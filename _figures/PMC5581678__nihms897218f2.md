caption: In the classical TGF-β1-SMAD-3 pathway, binding of ligands to constitutively
  active type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, which in turn propagates
  the signal by phosphorylating the R-SMADs (SMAD-2 and SMAD-3). Receptor-mediated
  phosphorylation of R-SMADs promote association with Co-SMAD (SMAD-4), resulting
  in nuclear translocation to modulates the target gene expression. We identified
  that GSK-3β exerts a critical brake on the classical TGF-β1-SMAD-3 pathway through
  direct interactions and also through β-catenin signaling. Specifically, GSK-3β interacts
  with, and thereby maintains, the low-level activity of SMAD-3, in which deletion
  or inhibition of GSK-3β, leads to aberrant hyperactivation of TGF-β1-SMAD-3 signaling
  and myocardial fibrosis. Furthermore, it well established that GSK-3β is required
  for phosphorylation and proteasomal ubiquitination of β-catenin. Inhibition of GSK-3
  leads to accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, another important
  modulator of TGF-β1-SMAD-3 signaling. Thus, GSK-3 exerts dual control on TGF-β1-SMAD-3
  signaling, by direct interaction and indirectly by modulating the β-catenin signaling.
