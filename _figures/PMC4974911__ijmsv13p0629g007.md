caption: A brief graphic abstract of this study. Rat tendon-derived stem cells (rTDSCs)
  were cultured in normoxic (20% O2) and hypoxic (3% O2) cultures. Osteogenesis capacity
  of rTDSCs in normoxic culture was promoted compared with that in hypoxic culture,
  whereas inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling pathway attenuated osteogenesis of rTDSCs
  both in normoxic and hypoxic cultures.
