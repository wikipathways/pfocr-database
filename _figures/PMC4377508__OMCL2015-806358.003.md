caption: Interactions between radical damage, inflammation, and distal injury. Intermediates
  in grey initiate damage of the molecular components of renal tissue. Compounds in
  white, although not directly damaging, are involved in harmful reactions. Damage
  resulting from intermediates in grey promotes an inflammatory response during which
  additional superoxide is released via phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity. If sustained,
  this process may lead to a systemic inflammatory response that can result in damage
  to tissues that are distal to the kidney, such as the pancreas (type 2 diabetes)
  and vasculature (cardiovascular disease), via related increases in the production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS). For example, the transcription of NF-κB-dependent
  genes may regulate levels of cellular ROS; the NF-κB pathway may be activated by
  stimulation of proinflammatory receptors, such as the TNF receptor superfamily.
  In turn, NF-κB activation may also be regulated by cellular levels of ROS; ROS can
  activate NF-κB through alternative IκB phosphorylation, resulting in the degradation
  of IκB.
