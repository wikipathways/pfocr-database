caption: Mitochondrial uncouplers increase mitochondrial respiration. Mitochondrial
  uncouplers mediate proton (H+) transport into the mitochondrial matrix via a pathway
  independent of ATP synthase [,]. Uncouplers bind to protons in the intermembrane
  space proceeding to cross the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Mitochondrial
  protonophore uncouplers are typically lipophilic weak acids that can penetrate membranes
  []. Once an uncoupler has crossed the IMM, it is deprotonated and cycles out of
  the mitochondrial matrix, where it becomes protonated again to continue the uncoupling
  cycle. This figure was created with BioRender.com and adapted from Demine et al.
