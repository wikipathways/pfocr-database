caption: 'The signalling pathway that is modulated by different generation mTOR inhibitors.
  Inhibition of mTORC1 results in the suppression of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 phosphorylation.
  Inhibited S6K1 reduces protein synthesis through phosphorylation of the 40S ribosomal
  subunit, which has been suggested to decrease the translational efficiency of a
  class of mRNA transcripts with a 5′-terminal oligopolypirymidine. There is a negative
  feedback loop in which mTORC1 activation can inhibit the PI3K pathway by S6K1-mediated
  phosphorylation and degradation of IRS-1, and it fills an important gap in our understanding
  the underlying mechanisms by which mTORC1 inhibits PI3K-Akt signalling. Abbreviations:
  IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate 1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; AKT, protein
  kinase B; PRAS40, proline-rich AKT substrate of 40 kDa; mTOR, mammalian target of
  rapamycin; S6K1, S6 kinase 1; 4E-BP1.'
