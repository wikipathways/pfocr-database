caption: IBD leads to anxiety- and depression-like behavioral comorbidities by inducing
  neuroinflammation. Chronic psychological stress, such as anxiety and depression,
  aggravates colitis by activating the HPA axis and disrupting the ANS. This is accompanied
  by an increase in the production of LPS, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β,
  and IL-6), and gut leak. Additionally, peripheral inflammation causes a decrease
  in tight junction protein expression between endothelial cells in the BBB. Then,
  the disruption of BBB integrity predisposes the translocation of circulating inflammatory
  mediators into brain tissues, which leads to the inflammatory response in the CNS
  by increasing IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, activating the TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory
  pathway, as well as increasing iNOS and nitrite levels in brain tissues. Further,
  circulating inflammatory mediators reaching the brain affect neuroglial networks
  and activate microglial cells, which further exacerbate the inflammatory response
  in the CNS. Additionally, activated microglial cells can promote neurodegeneration
  of the hippocampal nerve, which also contributes to mood disorders. Furthermore,
  overactivation of the kynurenine pathway generates excess QUIN in the brain, which
  impairs neurons and neuroglial cells, resulting in inflammation–mediated depression.
