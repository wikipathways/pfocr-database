caption: Overview of the CapG-involved motility pathway. It is derived from the present
  study outcomes that CapG is involved in Rho motility pathway independent of ROCK
  and inactivates Rac1. It is reasonably deduced that CapG-mediated Ca2+signaling
  and Ca2+-dependent MLCK contribute to MLC phosphorylation. Arrows indicate activation.
  Truncated arrows mean inhibition. ROCK, rho-associated protein kinase; p-MLC, phosphorylated-myosin
  light chain; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase
