caption: ERQC in Endoplasmic reticulum. ERQC monitors the correct folding of proteins
  via ERAD, UPR, and autophagy. (1) The soluble protein aggregates are retrotranslocated
  into cytosol through SEL1L-HRD1, where the ubiquitinated substrates are degraded
  by the proteasome. (2) When the misfolded proteins exceed ER degradation capacity,
  it leads to the ER stress response. In order to maintain ER homeostasis, the UPR
  response is activated which is composed of IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6 branches. The activated
  IRE1α catalyzes the splicing of XBP1 to generate XBP1s. In addition, IRE1α can also
  reduce protein synthesis through RIDD, and interacts with TRAF2 to regulate the
  expression of pro-/anti-apoptotic proteins. PERK reduces protein load by phosphorylating
  eIF2α and NRF2. Meanwhile, the upregulated ATF4 participates in cell apoptosis and
  protein synthesis via CHOP and GADD34. ER stress also causes the translocation of
  ATF6 to the Golgi apparatus, where it is spliced by S1P and S2P proteases, thereby
  mediating the expression of ERAD and ER chaperones. (3) In the ER stress response,
  large protein aggregates are degraded through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway.
