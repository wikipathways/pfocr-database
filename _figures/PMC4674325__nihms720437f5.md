caption: (A) The Sonic Hedgehog (Hh) pathway begins with the release of the Sonic
  Hh ligand from Purkinje cells onto EGL NPCs where it binds and inhibits the Patched
  receptor. Since activation of the Patched receptor normally represses Smoothened
  (Smo) activity, this reduces inhibition of Smo leading to a downstream activation
  of Gli transcription factors. (B) The Hh antagonists (HAs) vismodegib, cyclopamine,
  and jervine antagonize the Hh pathway at the level of Smo. (C) Hh stimulation transitions
  EGL NPCs into a “Primed for Death” state that converts inactivated Bax (iBAX) into
  an activated form (aBAX) that can produce apoptosis. (D) However, aBAX is prevented
  from producing apoptosis by the Bcl-xL anti-apoptotic protein. (E) Since Bcl-xL
  is the only thing preventing apoptosis, its inhibition by a BH3 sensitizer allows
  aBAX to initiate apoptosis (F). (G) We hypothesize that Hedgehog stimulation acts
  as a survival signal by inhibiting the production of a BH3-only sensitizer that
  would otherwise block Bcl-xL and allow aBAX to produce apoptosis.
