caption: Direct target genes of hypoxia-mediated hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)
  signaling. Culture of early secondary follicles under hypoxic conditions resulted
  in downregulation of the prolyl hydroxylase P4hb. Based on previous work, P4hb downregulation
  would prevent ubiquitin-mediated degradation of HIF-1α and allow formation of the
  HIF complex (HIF-1α:HIF-1β) to activate transcription of target genes. Consistent
  with these findings, our data suggest that whereas Hif1α expression was not different
  between follicles cultured at 2.5 and 20% O2, prevention of HIF-1α degradation and
  activation of the HIF complex led to upregulation of target genes Slc2a3, Vegfa,
  Slc2a1, Edn1, Pgk1, Ldha, and Hmox1. Fold change and P values for each gene are
  shown in parentheses. Figure adapted with permission from GeneGo Metacore Pathway
