caption: Schematic diagram represent the Putative mechanism of HPV in breast carcinogenesis.
  (A) Interaction of E6 with E6-AP leads to the degradation of p53 resulting in increased
  cellular proliferation eventually transforming into immortalized mammary epithelial
  cells (MEC). (B) E6 linked with hTERT can mediate immortalization of MEC through
  inactivation of p14ARF-p53 pathway (V) E6 could increase the mammary cell proliferation
  through up regulation of Cox2. This occurs due to E6 mediated degradation of NFX1
  resulting in p105 down regulation and stabilizing NF-κβ which can now activate transcription
  of COX2. (D) E6/E7 interaction with HER2 results in its activation. HER2 in-turn
  activates c-Src which leads to the phoshorylation of beta-catenin at its C-terminal
  end as a result of which beta-catenin translocates to nucleus and activates different
  proliferation associated genes. (E) E6/E7 inhibits the function of BRCA1 resulting
  in restoration of expression of ER. High expression of ER leads to increased proliferation
  of mammary cell due to modulation of different proliferation associated genes.
