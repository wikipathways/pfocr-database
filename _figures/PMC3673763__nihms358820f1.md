caption: ALPS is caused by defective Fas-mediated apoptosis. Normally, as part of
  the down-regulation of the immune response, activated B and T lymphocytes increase
  Fas expression, and activated T lymphocytes increase expression of Fas ligand. Fas
  and Fas ligand interact which activates the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and
  triggers the caspase cascade, culminating in cellular apoptosis. Fas-mediated signaling
  is part of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, because it is activated through the
  interactiong of cell surface death receptors. In contrast, the intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway is activated by cellular stressors that lead to decreased mitochondrial
  membrane permeability with release of apoptosis-inducing substances. © Sue Seif,
