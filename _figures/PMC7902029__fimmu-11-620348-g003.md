caption: The role of sphingolipids and specialized pro-resolving mediators in health
  and disease. In healthy conditions, neurons maintain a proper balance of sphingolipids.
  The abundant SK1 enzyme deviates the sphingolipid pathway toward SPM production
  and secretion. Secreted SPMs reach perineuronal microglia, promoting their pro-resolving
  phenotype. Pro-resolving microglia maintain a healthy microenvironment by clearing
  amyloid beta through phagocytosis. In AD, there is a dysregulation of sphingolipids
  and SPMs, which correlates with the levels of hyperphosphorylated tau and Aβ. Reduced
  levels of the enzyme SK1 result in less SPM production and secretion. Microglia
  become pro-inflammatory, and start secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines. Aβ is no
  longer cleared, leading to the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques. These
  plaques further contribute to neurotoxicity.
