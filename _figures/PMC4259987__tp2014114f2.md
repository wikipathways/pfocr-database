caption: (a) Pathway analysis (STRING v9.05) of 39 proteins significantly dysregulated
  in the CSF of subjects with mild or moderate delirium relative to the mild AD control
  with no delirium. Subjects from both the Sydney and Edinburgh Delirium Studies were
  used. These are a subset of proteins listed in , which are dysregulated in at least
  4 out of 17 delirium patients. The STRING MCL clustering tool was used to identify
  up to four clusters in this data set (clustered proteins are marked in same colour
  circles), and include; chromogranin and secretogranin, apolipoproteins, clotting
  factors and regulatory proteins. The protein acronyms were as provided by the ProteinPilot
  software, which uses the gene symbol nomenclature based on the Guidelines for Human
  Gene Nomenclature and http://www.genenames.org/guidelines.html. (b) Pathway analysis
  (STRING v9.05) of proteins whose iTRAQ ratio is significantly correlated with MMSE
  score (regression analysis P-values are shown in ). Delirium and normal control
  subjects from both the Sydney Delirium and Edinburgh Studies were used for the regression
  analysis. The STRING MCL clustering tool was used to identify up to four clusters
  in this data set. (c) Theoretical model of the relationship between proteomic changes
  and delirium pathophysiology. The proteins shown on this schematic are the significantly
  dysregulated proteins listed in  and . CSF, cerebrospinal fluid.
