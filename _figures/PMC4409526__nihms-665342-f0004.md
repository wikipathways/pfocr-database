caption: Diagram depicting molecules involved in actin cytoskeletal regulation mediated
  by NMDA signaling pathways and having altered mRNA expression in bipolar disorder.
  Green represents increased mRNA expression, red represents decreased expression
  and no color represents no significant expression change. The diagram was generated
  using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis using data from the qRT-PCR study (double circles,
  McLean 75 cohort) and microarray data obtained from the DLPFC of bipolar disorder
  subjects in the McLean 66 cohort. Interestingly, mRNA expression levels of CDC42
  and KALRN were unchanged in contrast to a previous report (). However, CDC42BPA
  (CDC42 binding protein kinase alpha (DMPK-like)) mRNA expression was increased.
  CDC42BPA is a CDC42 effector protein involved in the reorganization of the actin
  cytoskeleton (). DLGAP2 (Discs, large (Drosophila) homolog-associated protein 2)
  is a post-synaptic scaffolding protein involved in the regulation of NMDA receptors
  and dendritic spines (). NEFL (neurofilament, light polypeptide) is a post-synaptic
  structural protein which regulates the surface expression and function of NMDA receptors
  (; ). PTK2B (protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta) is involved in the regulation of NMDA
  receptor activity ().
