caption: HIF regulation and function on POMC. PI3K pathway, HIF-PHD-VHL pathway and
  mTOR/NF-kB/HIF pathway all participates in regulation of HIF. Crosstalk among these
  pathways is not completely clear. PI3K, mTOR, and NF-kB can increase expression
  of HIF, while PHD negatively regulate HIF and promote its degradation with VHL as
  a cofactor. Hypoxia among adipocytes caused by obesity downregulated the activity
  of PHDs. HIF works as one of the activators of POMC gene that prevent food intake.
  Whether the feedback from IRS to PIP3 and the function from AKT to NF-kB can finally
  influence the activity of HIF is not clear and demand further study. Whether these
  upstream activated HIF can activate all the functional effects of POMC has not been
  directly stated in previous articles, and it is for further study.
