caption: Biosynthetic pathway for the biosynthesis of diosmetin and chrysoeriol. The
  yellow section indicates the canonical first steps in plants. Tyrosine ammonia-lyase
  (TAL); 4-Coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL); Chalcone synthase (CHS); Chalcone isomerase
  (CHI); Flavone synthase (FNS1); Flavonoid 3′ hydroxylase/Cytochrome P450 reductase
  chimera (F3′H/CPR); 4′-O-methyltransferase (4′OMT); 3′-O-methyltransferase (3′OMT).
  In light orange, the part of the pathway integrated into the ϕC31 attb site of the
  chromosome is shown; in light green, the part of the pathway integrated into the
  ϕBT1 attb site of the chromosome is shown; in light blue, the final part of the
  pathway for the heterologous biosynthesis of diosmetin or chrysoeriol is shown,
  with both cases integrated into the pSAM2 site of the S. albidoflavus chromosome.
  The yellow section indicates the naturally occurring pathway in plants, using L-phenylalanine
  instead of L-tyrosine
