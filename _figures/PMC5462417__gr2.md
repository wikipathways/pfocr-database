  Parkin and PINK1 regulate proliferation, which, in the case of PINK1, occurs through
  the EGF signalling pathway. PINK1, Parkin, GBA, and DJ-1 have all been shown to
  have a role in the maintenance of healthy mitochondria. Astrocyte α-synuclein (α-SYN)
  regulates the uptake and distribution of arachidonic acid (AA), which is released
  from phospholipids by Group VI Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2). DJ-1 regulates
  the stability of lipid rafts, therefore maintaining the glutamate transporter GLAST
  at the membrane. Additionally, DJ-1 is involved in the termination of TLR4 signalling
  via receptor endocytosis, and the inhibition of the IFN-γ inflammatory response.
  iPLA2 is upregulated in response to TLR4 signalling and increases the calcium load
  in the endoplasmic reticulum. Extracellular α-SYN can be endocytosed via a TLR4-independent
  process and degraded by the lysosome. At high concentrations, extracellular α-SYN
  activates TLR4 signalling that is not terminated by receptor endocytosis. GBA mutations
  can disrupt degradation of proteins via the autophagy pathway. Leucine-rich repeat
  kinase 2 (LRRK2) regulates fusion and/or degradation in the autophagy pathway and,
  alongside lysosomal type 5 ATPase (ATP13A2), may have a role in the control of lysosomal
  pH. ATP13A2 levels maintain the stability of the lysosome and prevent its contents
  from leaking into the cytosol, which can result in activation of the NLPR3 inflammasome.
