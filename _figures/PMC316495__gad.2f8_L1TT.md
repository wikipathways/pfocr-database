caption: Models for the different functions of APR-1. (A) During morphogenesis of
  the embryo, APR-1 may perform at least two separate functions. First, (left) APR-1
  may act together with the adherens junction proteins HMR-1 Cadherin, HMP-1 α-Catenin,
  and HMP-2 β-Catenin in migratory hypodermal cells during ventral closure and elongation
  of the embryo. Second (right), APR-1 may act in the Wnt signaling pathway that controls
  the expression of the HOX protein CEH-13 in the anterior seam and muscle cells.
  (B) During larval development, APR-1 may be required for the transduction of a Wnt
  signal that induces expression of the HOX protein LIN-39 in P3–8.p to specify the
  VPC fate. The three β-Catenins WRM-1 (), HMP-2 (), and BAR-1 () may act redundantly
  in the transduction of Wnt signals.
