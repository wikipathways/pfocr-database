caption: Schematic representation of the putative cross-talk between NF-κB, oxidative
  stress, intracellular Ca2+, and the RAS in cardiac myocytes exposed to hyperglycemia.
  Hyperglycemia increases oxidative stress as a byproduct of glucose metabolism and
  intracellular Ca2+ levels through intermediates of the glycolytic pathway. Oxidative
  stress and intracellular Ca2+ have been shown to activate NF-κB signaling. NF-κB
  controls the transcription of genes of RAS components, enzymes that modulate oxidative
  stress (e.g., NADPH oxidase), and Ca2+-handling proteins. ANG II, the bioactive
  peptide of the RAS, in turn increases oxidative stress and intracellular Ca2+ levels
  and activates NF-κB signaling. Thus, NF-κB appears to be the nodal point for the
  convergence of major cellular events that contribute to cardiac dysfunction in diabetes.
  This study provides evidence that lack of NF-κB activation prevents diabetic cardiomyopathy.

  acid cycle; AT1, ANG II type 1 receptor; ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; [Ca2+]i,
