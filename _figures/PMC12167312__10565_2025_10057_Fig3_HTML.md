caption: 'Neuroprotective mechanisms of NAS. NAS exerts neuroprotective effects through
  multiple pathways. The mechanisms are as follows: black arrows indicate the direct
  effects of anesthetics on immature neurons, while red arrows represent subsequent
  effects induced by the inhibition of related signaling pathways. NAS interacts with
  TLR2, TLR4, and TLR7 and their adaptor proteins to reduce the production of inflammatory
  factors, thereby alleviating neuronal inflammation. NAS also regulates the synthesis
  of mBDNF through receptors such as GPER1, ERα/β, and PXR. mBDNF activates MEK/ERK,
  PI3 K/AKT, and PLCγ/PKC signaling pathways through TrkA/B receptors, inhibiting
  ROS production, alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction, reducing neuronal apoptosis,
  enhancing neurotransmitter release, and activating NMDAR to promote LTP formation,
  thus increasing synaptic plasticity. Additionally, NAS may exert anesthetic effects
  by modulating GABAARs and Ca2⁺ while enhancing neuronal regeneration to further
  protect the nervous system. NAS, DEX, and EPO reduce neuroinflammation and exhibit
  anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective effects through the BDNF/TrkB pathway, while
  Clobenpropit, Edaravone, and Doxycycline act through the BDNF/PI3 K pathway. Melatonin
  increases BDNF production through Nrf2, while L-Ca, Curcumin, and Resveratrol reduce
  oxidative stress, and Etanercept reduces the production of inflammatory factors'
