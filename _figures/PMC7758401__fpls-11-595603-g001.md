caption: 'The establishment, maintenance and erasing of 5mC in plants. (A) The diverse
  small RNAs-generating pathways involved in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM).
  The small RNAs-generating pathways in the canonical Pol IV -RDR2-DCL3-dependent
  RdDM pathway, Pol II-DCL3 RdDM pathway, RDR6 RdDM pathway, RDR6-DCL3 RdDM pathway,
  Pol IV-NERD RdDM pathway, and dicer-independent RdDM, are briefly presented, respectively
  (). (B) The establishment of 5mC in plants. 21–24-nt siRNAs or miRNAs, which are
  loaded onto AGO2 or AGO4/6, base-pair with Pol V-generated nascent scaffold transcript
  of target loci, resulting in the DRM2 recruitment and DNA methylation at the source
  loci with the aid of RNA binding proteins, methylated DNA binding proteins, chromatin-remodeling
  complex and histone modification-associated proteins (; ). (C) The maintenance of
  5mC in different contexts. CG, CHG and asymmetric CHH methylation are maintained
  by MET1, CMT3/CMT2, DRM2/CMT2, respectively. It is needed to note that CMT3 and
  SUVH4/5/6 form a self-reinforcing feedback loop between mCHG and H3K9me (; ). (D)
  The erasing of 5mC through active and passive demethylation pathway. In the passive
  demethylation, 5mC is diluted during DNA replication. In the active demethylation
  pathway, four bifunctional 5mC DNA glycosylases-apurinic/apyrimidinic lyases, DME,
  ROS1 and its homologs DML2 and DML3, catalyze the active removal of 5-methylcytosine
  from all sequence contexts through the base excision repair pathway (). The proteins
  are represented in circles. The regulatory pathways are indicated with solid arrows.
