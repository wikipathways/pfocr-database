caption: Working model illustrates E2 and CTNNB1 signals in the oviductal ciliated
  (blue) and secretory (orange) epithelial cells regulating embryo transport. A) In
  the presence of ESR1, WNT/CTNNB1 is normally expressed, leads to a normal embryo
  transport, regardless of ESR2 expression in the ciliated epithelial cells. B) In
  the absence of ESR1, expression of WNT/CTNNB1, Kif9, Foxj1 are aberrantly expressed,
  ciliary length and beating are altered, causing impaired embryo transport. C) In
  the presence of ESR1, ex vivo attenuation of WNT/CTNNB1 signals in oviductal epithelial
  cells disrupts embryo transport, indicating that the WNT/CTNNB1 pathway is a potential
  downstream mediator of E2-regulation of embryo transport through the oviduct. D)
  Loss of CTNNB1 specifically in the ciliated epithelial cells does not affect oviductal
  embryo transport, indicating that E2 modulates WNT/CTNNB1 signals in secretory epithelial
  cells, and also acts through the noncanonical WNT signaling pathway or other downstream
  pathways in the ciliated epithelial cells, to control the embryo transport.
