caption: Figure 1. Convergence of phagocytosis, autophagy, and the visual cycle. The
  RPE performs 2 vital functions that support vision, phagocytosis, and the visual
  cycle. Phagocytosis and degradation of POS are mediated by a noncanonical form of
  autophagy termed LC3-associated phagocytosis. Engulfed POS enter the phagosome,
  and the ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L1 complex is recruited, as is the lipidated form of LC3
  (LC3-II). Only then does the lysosome fuse with the phagosome forming the phagolysosome
  leading to degradation of the POS cargo. The second critical process is the classic
  retinoid visual cycle that begins following the absorption of light in the photoreceptors
  by visual pigments containing the chromophore 11-cis RAL. This generates all-trans
  ROL which is transported to the RPE for conversion back to 11-cis RAL to recharge
  the pigments. These 2 critical pathways converge as the recovery of all-trans ROL
  for 11-cis RAL synthesis in the RPE is aided by the POS phagocytosis and degradation
  pathway.
