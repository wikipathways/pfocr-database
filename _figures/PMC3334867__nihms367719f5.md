caption: The signaling and inhibitions of STAT3 are shown, with areas of special emphasis
  for the dominant negative mutants shown. Crosshatched STAT3 depicts the AD-mutant
  form of the molecule, with each heterodimer in which it participates being inhibited
  from function. The thunderbolts are to indicate where a normal function is being
  inhibited. STAT3 is both involved in IL-10 signal transduction and in IL-10 expression,
  both of which are affected in Job’s syndrome.
