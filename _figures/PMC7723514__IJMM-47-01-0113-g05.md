caption: Proposed mechanism of pimozide in prolactinoma bromocriptine resistance.
  Pimozide inhibits the expression of STAT5, which suppresses cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL,
  resulting in reversal of bromocriptine resistance. PRL contributes to drug resistance
  through activation of the JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway. Bromocriptine treatment
  alone increased STAT5 and Bcl-xL activation, and reduced cyclin D1 activity in prolactinoma
  cells. When combined with bromocriptine, pimozide suppressed activation of STAT5,
  which further decreased cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL expression. Further mechanistic studies
  are required for detailed characterization. The solid arrow represents a promoting
  effect, the red T symbol represents an inhibitory effect and the double headed arrow
  represents possible crosstalk between signaling. PRL, prolactin; PRLR, prolactin
  receptor; STAT5, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A; Bcl-xL, B-cell
  lymphoma extra-large.
