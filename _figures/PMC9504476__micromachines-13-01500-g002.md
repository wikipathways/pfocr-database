caption: Schematic of secreted neuronal activity reporter (SNAR) assay. Human iPSC-derived
  neurons or primary neuron cultures are transduced with SNAR. Media samples are collected
  at multiple time points and luciferase activity is recorded after the addition of
  the Coelenterazine, the Gaussia luciferase substrate by a luminometer. SNAR is calcium
  dependent and predominantly induced by NMDA receptor activation. Voltage gated calcium
  channels (VGCC) as well as the Erk/MAPK pathway also contribute to SNAR, albeit
  to a lower extent.
