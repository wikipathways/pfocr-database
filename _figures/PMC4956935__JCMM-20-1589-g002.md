caption: Proposed IGF‐interaction with PPAR‐γ signalling in CVD epigenetics. Interaction
  between PPAR‐γ and MAPK/PI3K pathways happens at different levels or time points
  in the cell cycle, thus in certain situations PPAR‐γ reduces the expression of MEK1/2
  protein expression and inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation , , . In contrast, in other
  cell systems, PPAR‐γ may activate ERK1/2. Furthermore, the interaction between PPAR‐γ
  and MAPK/PI3K may include pathways where ERK mediates PPAR‐γ phosphorylation, MEK1/2‐dependent
  PPAR‐γ nuclear export followed by PPAR‐γ degradation, PI3K inhibition through PTEN,
  mTOR decrease by AMPK activation and finally p70S6K phosphorylation. This signalling
  loop can be potentially responsible for epigenetic activity that targets survival,
  proliferation and/or differentiation of cardiac cells. Physical effort has been
  shown to increase levels of IGF‐I in muscle and physiological cardiac hypertrophy,
  thus inducing the IGF‐I/PI3K/Akt/P70S6K signalling pathway, and thereby increasing
  the protein synthesis required to build muscle; all of this can be epigenetically
  regulated , , , . On the other hand, PPAR‐γ ligands (such as rosiglitazone) activate
  tuberous sclerosis complex‐2 (TSC2) inhibiting mTOR signalling ,  as a possible
  compensatory effect to the MEK/ERK action on PPAR‐γ.
