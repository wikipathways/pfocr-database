caption: Metabolic network showing the central carbon metabolism in P. stipitis. Ethanol
  is directly involved in the production of amino acids aspartate, alanine and valine,
  which is produced from oxaloacetate and pyruvate. Through gluconeogenesis pathway,
  which has been reported to be observed when yeasts grow on non-fermentable carbon
  sources, ethanol is also involved in the production of serine.
