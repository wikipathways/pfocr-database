caption: Transcription of the alkS gene. The alkS gene can be transcribed from two
  promoters, PalkS1 and PalkS2. In the absence of alkanes, alkS is expressed from
  promoter PalkS1, which is recognized by σS-RNA polymerase. AlkS binds to a site
  overlapping the PalkS1 −10 region, repressing this promoter but allowing for a low
  basal expression. When alkanes become available, AlkS activates the expression of
  promoter PalkS2, located 38 bp downstream from PalkS1. This leads to a self-amplification
  process that significantly increases alkS mRNA levels. AlkS also activates the expression
  of other genes of the alkane degradation pathway from promoter PalkB (data not shown).
  Under conditions generating catabolite repression control (i.e. in the presence
  of amino acids that are preferred to alkanes), translation of the alkS mRNA is inhibited
  by the Crc global regulatory protein. The sequence of the alkS mRNA is shown (the
  start sites corresponding to promoters PalkS1 or PalkS2 are indicated; coordinates
  are referred to the PalkS2 start site). The Shine–Dalgarno (SD) sequence and the
  initiation codon AUG are indicated in bold characters.
