caption: Overview of oncogenic pathways in glioma and possibilities for pharmacological
  interventions, relevant for the models described in this article. Growth factors
  bind to RTKs resulting in phosphorylation and Ras/Raf and PI3 K signaling to Akt
  and mTOR, thus driving cell growth and survival. In a substantial percentage of
  glioblastomas this process is amplified by loss of the counteracting phosphatase
  PTEN. Akt also can phosphorylate MDM2 thereby stabilizing the protein. This stabilization
  causes ubiquitinylation and degradation of the tumor suppressor P53, unleashing
  cyclin D1 complex activity and leading to uncontrolled G1-S progression. Loss of
  control over the cell cycle is also induced by CDKN2A mutations as CDKN2A products,
  p14ARF an p16INK4A are important G1-S checkpoint proteins. The PI3 K pathway (activated
  by phosphorylated growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases [RTKs] such as EGFR, MET
  or PDGR) may be inhibited by small molecule RTK inhibitors or antibodies directed
  against ligand binding domains of RTKs or the ligands themselves, thus prevent ligand-receptor
  interaction. The cyclin D1 pathway (resulting in cell cycle progression from G1
  to S phase) may be inhibited by the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. Finally, mutations
  in IDH1 or IDH2 result in mutant proteins that catalyze the conversion of α-KG to
  D-2-HG, causing the G-CIMP phenotype and a transcriptional profile leading to gliomagenesis.
  AGI-5198 specifically inhibits IDH1R132H activity by binding to the catalytic site
  of the protein
