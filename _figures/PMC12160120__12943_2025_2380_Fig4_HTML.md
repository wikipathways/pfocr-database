caption: The cGAS-STING pathway regulates TAM polarization and anti-tumor immune effect.
  Within the TIME, M1 TAMs, induced by IFN-γ or LPS, exhibit pro-inflammatory and
  tumoricidal properties. cGAS-STING activation drives M1 polarization via the STING-IRF3-STAT1
  axis, promoting T cell infiltration and enhancing anti-tumor immunity, albeit with
  a potential trade-off of inducing PD-L1 expression to foster immune suppression.
  For instance, in hepatocellular carcinoma, cGAS-STING activation enhances anti-PD-1
  therapy efficacy, while in models of radiation-induced lung injury, STING-mediated
  upregulation of CCL2 recruits M1 TAMs. In contrast, M2 TAMs induced by IL-4/IL-13,
  secrete IL-10 and TGF-β, express high levels of CD206, and promote immune evasion.
  Moreover, STING agonists or nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems can reverse
  M2 polarization, reprogramming these cells into an M1-like phenotype to amplify
  anti-tumor effects. In glioblastoma and colorectal cancer liver metastasis models,
  STING activation suppresses M2 functionality and reduces metastatic potential through
  IFN-I secretion or the IRG1-TFEB axis, respectively
