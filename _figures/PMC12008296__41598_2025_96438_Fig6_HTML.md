caption: 'A novel pathway for the induction of epithelial cancer cell death by caerin
  1.1/1.9. One hour following caerin 1.1/1.9 treatment: HeLa cells activate caspase-3.
  Activated caspase-3 cleaves GSDME, resulting in membrane bubbling and the release
  of IL-18 and LDH. Following overnight treatment: HeLa cells upregulate the expression
  of Bax, downregulate Bcl-2, and show a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential
  (MMP). This leads to the release of cytochrome c, which combines with Apaf-1 in
  the cytoplasm to form the apoptosome. The apoptosome activates caspase-9, which
  subsequently activates downstream caspase-3/7, resulting in HeLa cell apoptosis'
