caption: Schematic of potential mechanism by which ion channels may regulate BMP signaling.
  Irk2, SERCA, and Orai have all been implicated in BMP signaling, but other channels
  are likely involved as well. A suggested hypothesis is that these ion channels regulate
  depolarization events that in turn regulate the release of BMP containing vesicles.
  This regulated release of BMP further regulates BMP pathway activity downstream
  by modulating the availability of morphogen levels.
