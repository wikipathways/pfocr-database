caption: Schematic diagram of signalling pathways involved in skeletal muscle remodelling
  and atrophy following disuse. (A) Skeletal muscle disuse is associated with a decrease
  in protein synthesis involving the deactivation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. (B)
  Different proteolytic systems are also involved and operate to degrade cellular
  proteins, but their relative contribution and importance differ significantly. (B1)
  Lysosomal system. (B2) Cytosolic non-lysosomal calpain system. (B3) Ubiquitin-proteasome
  system. The latter of which appears to catalyse the majority of protein breakdown.
  On the left, the Akt/FOXO transcriptional control pathway is shown leading to the
  induction of atrogenes (ubiquitin ligases). On the right, a specific NF-κB pathway
  is activated during disuse atrophy. (C) Apoptotic pathways are also shown as they
  represent additional events controlling muscle atrophy. (C1) and (C2) highlight
  apoptosis induced in a caspase-dependent versus caspase-independent manner, respectively.
  (D) Myostatin pathway. Myostatin, growth differentiation factor-8 (GDF8), a member
  of the TGF-β, is a negative regulator of muscle mass acting via Smad transcription
  factors. See text in first section for details.
