caption: Loss of Axin2 can cause MVD by shifting TGFβ/SMAD3 pathway toward WNT/β-catenin
  and BMP signaling. This hypothetical model is based on published findings. In the
  absence of Axin2, TGFβ-dependent SMAD3 signaling is expected to decrease (indicated
  by a minus [-] sign), whereas both WNT-dependent β-catenin and BMP-dependent SMAD1/5
  signaling are likely to increase (indicated a plus [+] sign). Without the WNT, the
  destruction complex remains in the cytoplasm, where it ubiquitinates β-catenin by
  β-TrCP. WNT induces the association of the intact complex with phosphorylated LRP.
  After binding to LRP, the destruction complex still captures and phosphorylates
  β-catenin, but ubiquitination by β-TrCP is blocked. Newly synthesized β-catenin
  accumulates. TGFβ2 and/or BMP2 both could bind to TGFβR3, suggesting a crosstalk
  between TGFβ and BMP pathways. Fibrillin-1 is thought to restrict bioavailability
  of both TGFβ and BMP ligands. Both endoglin and TGFβR3 facilitates ligand binding
  to the canonical TGFβ-receptor (TGFβR1/TGFβR2) heteromeric complex. Axin which interacts
  with SMAD3 and TGFβRs promotes phosphorylation of the TGFβ-specific SMADs (i.e.
  pSMAD2/3). Canonical BMP signaling occurs through BMP receptors and BMP-specific
  SMADs (i.e. SMAD1/5). WNT, TGFβ and BMP signaling each induces specific target genes
  such as Smad7, Axin 2, and Periostin, respectively. Based on the individual activities
  of WNT, TGFβ, and BMPs in MVD, the overall signaling integration may play an important
  role in MVD.
