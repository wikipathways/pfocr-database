caption: Nanomaterial-based DDSs treat OA by targeting macrophages. Nanomedicines
  modified with different ligands target macrophages through the corresponding receptors
  on macrophages to release functional drugs. Different nanomedicines regulate macrophages
  through different mechanisms. Firstly, nanomedicines reduce circulating cell-free
  DNA by down-regulating the mTOR signaling pathway. Secondly, nanomedicines inhibit
  mitochondrial DNA outflow by downre-gulating the cGAS/STING signaling pathway. Thirdly,
  nanomedicines down-regulate TLR-3, thereby down-regulating the NF-kB signaling pathway.
  Fourthly, nanomedicines release TRPV1, thereby up-regulating CaMKII. These nanomedicines
  can ultimately induce M1 macrophages to form M2 macrophages, inhibit apoptosis,
  ferroptosis and inflammation, promote autophagy and eliminate ROS
