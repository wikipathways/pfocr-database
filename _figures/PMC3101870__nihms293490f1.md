  the hypophysis where GH is produced. In the liver, GH stimulates the secretion of
  its main effector, IGF-I, as well as IGF-II and IGFBPs. B, at the tissue level,
  the levels of the free ligands (IGF-I and IGF-II) are regulated bythe presence of
  the six different IGFBPs, which bind the growth factors with high affinity, and

  formers are regulated by specific proteases. Insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II bind to
  the different receptors (insulin receptors A and B, IGF-IR, and IGF-IIR) with diverse
  affinities, and each receptor triggers different intracellular signaling cascades.
  Hybrid receptors are composed by one α-subunit and one β-subunit of the IGF-IR and
  one α-subunit and one β-subunit of the insulin receptor. C, at the cellular level,
  binding of IGF-I to its receptor triggers the autophosphorylation of the later and
  of the adaptor proteins IRS1 to 4 and shc/ Grb-2. Activation of each of these proteins
  prompts different signaling cascades through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt
  and ras/raf/mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase
  pathways. The GH-IGF-IGFBP axis controls, through these three levels of regulation,
  mediators of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and translation that regulate cell growth,

  of IGF-IR turns the cells to survive apoptotic signals and to proliferate. III,

  description: The three levels of regulation of the IGF-IR pathwayand its components.
    A, systemic regulation at the endocrine level. The GH-IGF-IGFBP axis is directed

    The formers are regulated by specific proteases. Insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II bind
    to the different receptors (insulin receptors A and B, IGF-IR, and IGF-IIR) with
    diverse affinities, and each receptor triggers different intracellular signaling

    of each of these proteins prompts different signaling cascades through the phosphatidylinositol
    3-kinase/Akt and ras/raf/mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated
    kinase kinase pathways. The GH-IGF-IGFBP axis controls, through these three levels
    of regulation, mediators of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and translation that regulate
    cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as energetic metabolism.
