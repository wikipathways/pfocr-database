caption: Pathway map visualizing metabolite changes in maize seeds resulting from
  the genetic engineering of carotenoid biosynthesis. The pathway diagram was created
  using the in-house software BioSynlab. Metabolites on a grey background or otherwise
  marked were detectable with this platform, compounds in dotted boxes were below
  detection. Compounds on a black background indicate an at least 2-fold significant
  increase in the transgenic line Ph3 over the non-transgenic line M37W. The boxed
  compounds on a white background exhibited an at least 2-fold significant decrease.
