caption: Impact of miR-215 on cell proliferation, cell cycle, chemoresistance, and
  EMT. p53 and miR-215 form a positive feedback regulatory mechanism to regulate cell
  cycle control. The expression of p53 was induced by the suppression of DTL, a critical
  component of the e CUL4A–DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, along with the p53 down
  stream gene p21. The elevated p53 in turn up-regulates the expression of miR-215.
  In addition, to DTL, miR-215 also suppresses the expression of TS, DHFR, CDC7, MCM3,
  MCM10. miR-215 triggers cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase without triggering cell
  death, which contribute to chemoresistance to TS and DHFR inhibitors in CSCs. miR-215
  also mediates EMT transition by targeting ZEB2 via TGFβ signaling pathway.
