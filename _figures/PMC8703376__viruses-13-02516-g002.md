caption: Partial inositol biosynthesis pathway of primary relevance to IP6 production.
  (A) Starting with the hydrolysis of the inositol head group from the plasma membrane-enriched
  phospholipid PI(4,5)P2, IP6 synthesis proceeds with the addition of phosphates to
  the IP3 molecule. The primary path leading to IP6 is highlighted in yellow. Enzymes
  are colored corresponding to the phosphate addition. Enzymes in black text represent
  de-phosphorylation steps. (B) The most commonly described IP pathway in cells and
  the dominant location of action. Labeling around and in the depicted cell corresponds
  to the organelle. After leaving the nuclear space, IP6 is utilized by HIV-1 Gag
  for immature virus assembly and subsequent budding. Alternatively, IP6 can be dephosphorylated
  by MINPP1 in the ER. IP names are simplified here to show only the positions which
  are phosphorylated.
