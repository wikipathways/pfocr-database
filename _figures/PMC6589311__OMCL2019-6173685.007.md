caption: Schematic diagram for the new mechanism of ZYZ-803 in ER stress-related cardiac
  necroptosis. Aberrant ERS could be evoked during AMI and by its typical agonist
  tunicamycin in cardiomyocytes, which potentially induces myocardial necroptosis
  through the RIP3-CaMKII pathway. ZYZ-803, a dual donor for gasotransmitters H2S
  and NO, could downregulate this ERS-related necroptosis at upstream of RIP3-CaMKII
  signaling through H2S and NO balance and finally protects the heart from acute myocardial
  ischemia injury.
