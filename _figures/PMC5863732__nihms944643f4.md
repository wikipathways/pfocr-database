caption: All major nutrient classes - carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and ketone bodies
  - are catabolized in part through mitochondrial pathway mediated by acyl-CoAs. Acetylation
  and succinylation by acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA respectively are associated with
  TCA cycle through all nutrient types, and have been characterized at the proteomic
  level by mass spectrometry. Similar studies have identified glutarylated, malonylated,
  and propionylated proteins in mitochondria. Whether the wide variety of lower-abundance
  acyl-CoA species are in turn transduced into mitochondrial lysine acylation remains
  to be seen.
