caption: Effects of AhR in tumor energy metabolism. The lncRNA-SLCC1 binds to the
  AhR and increases the expression of HK2, which activates glycolytic metabolism and
  promotes tumor growth. As a result of AhR’s activation of NADPH oxidase and subsequent
  upregulation in ROS production, the expression level of PKM2, the rate-limiting
  enzyme of aerobic glycolysis, is further increased. This boosts the aerobic glycolysis
  of tumor cells and encourages the growth of tumor cells via suppressing GAPDH and
  preventing glycolysis, AhR activation promotes Treg development via controlling
  the NAD+/SIRT1/SUV39H1/H3K9me3 signaling pathway
