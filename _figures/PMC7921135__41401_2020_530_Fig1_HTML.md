caption: Although brain CB2R levels are low in healthy individuals, they are significantly
  upregulated in glial elements in response to various neurological insults. Existing
  evidence demonstrates that signaling through CB2Rs can be mediated via G protein  and
  β-arrestin, each with their own downstream effectors [–]. As shown in Fig. 1, CB2Rs
  are coupled to Gαi/o to inhibit adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, leading to a decrease
  in cAMP levels. On the other hand, the Gβγ subunits, upon dissociation from Gαi/o,
  are known to activate G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels and PI3K and
  inhibit voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Alternatively, β-arrestin 2 recruitment to
  CB2Rs results in activation of the ERK pathway. Overall, activation of CB2Rs plays
  neuroprotective roles, including attenuation of neuroinflammation, amelioration
  of mitochondrial depolarization and stimulation of neurogenesis, which could eventually
  reduce deficits in cognition, memory and motor inhibition. In addition, the activation
  of CB2Rs also modulates ion channel functions, thereby altering neuronal excitability,
  and leads to neuroprotection.
