caption: Putative metabolic pathways were inferred from changes of the intermediates
  levels in the liver and plasma of the G6PDx-FB mice. Red indicates the significantly
  elevated metabolites relative to those in the controls. Green shows significantly
  reduced metabolites relative to those in the controls.
