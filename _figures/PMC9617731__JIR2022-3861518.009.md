caption: Illustration depicting the detection of H. pylori ssRNA by the endosomal
  TLR8 and downstream signaling pathway that results in transactivation of IFN-α and
  IFN-β. In contrast, extracellular bacteria molecules are detected mainly by TLR2
  and TLR5 that trigger activation of NF-κB that transactivates proinflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-1β and IL-6.
