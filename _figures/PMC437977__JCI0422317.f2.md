caption: The interface of the two major molecules implicated in AD pathogenesis with
  molecular mechanisms of apoptosis. The two major pathways to cellular apoptosis
  are intrinsic and extrinsic. The extrinsic pathway involves signaling through cell
  surface death receptors, such as the TNF receptor, which are regulated by decoy
  receptors and Fas-associated death domain–like interleukin-1β–converting enzyme
  inhibitory proteins (FLIPs). Direct binding of Aβ or Aβ oligomers to death receptors
  remains to be shown, but the pattern of activation of downstream caspases (e.g.,
  caspases 2 and 8) supports involvement of the extrinsic pathway in Aβ-mediated apoptotic
  processes. Alternatively, intracellular Aβ produced in the ER may lead to ER stress,
  or binding of Aβ to a mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase may lead to mitochondrial
  stress. Both entries into the intrinsic pathway may activate downstream apoptotic
  mechanisms. While details of the upstream mechanisms and mediators remain to be
  defined, activated executioner caspases 3 and 7 are capable of cleaving tau protein,
  which may favor formation of NFTs. Asterisk indicates possible sites of action of
  Aβ. Caspases 1 and 5 are involved in cytokine activation.
