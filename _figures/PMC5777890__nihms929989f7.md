caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of mitochondrial proteomic networks influenced
  in the IFM by nano-TiO2 exposure (A) and preserved in the IFM of mPHGPx nano-TiO2
  exposed (B). Four networks, including reactive oxygen species production, oxidative
  phosphorylation, citric acid cycle, and fatty acid oxidation were identified. Green
  indicates proteins increased with nano-TiO2 exposure and red indicates proteins
  downregulated following nano-TiO2 exposure. Grey indicates proteins unchanged by
  nano-TiO2 exposure but are part of their respective networks.
