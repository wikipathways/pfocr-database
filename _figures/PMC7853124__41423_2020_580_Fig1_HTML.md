caption: Roles of Th1 cytokines in the pathogenesis of liver diseases. IFN-γ activates
  the STAT1 signaling pathway by binding to IFN-γR1 and IFN-γR2, which induces liver
  injury and inflammation but inhibits liver regeneration and fibrosis. IFN-γ/STAT1
  signaling facilitates the retention of antiviral CD4+ T cells in the liver by inducing
  CXCL9 expression in liver-resident macrophages. TNF-α binding to TNFR1 and TNFR2
  may promote steatosis-to-NASH and HCC progression by activating several pathways.
  IL-12 binds to the IL-12 receptor, which is composed of IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2, leading
  to STAT4 activation. IL-12 is involved in the progression of hepatitis delta virus
  infection and sclerosing cholangitis by activating MAIT cells and inducing Treg
  dysfunction. IL-2 not only controls HBV infection but also harnesses the antiviral
  effects of iNKT cells by inducing STAT5 activation. In addition, IL-2 ameliorates
  biliary injury and fibrosis in murine sclerosing cholangitis by boosting the intrahepatic
  Treg response
