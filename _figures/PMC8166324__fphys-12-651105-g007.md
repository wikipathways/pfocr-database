caption: Schematic illustration of the DM-induced ERS and OS. DM induced apoptosis
  through activation of the signaling pathway IRE1α, TRAF2, ASK1, JNK, caspase-12,
  and the pathway PERK, CHOP, caspase-3. Meanwhile, the reduction of Nrf2 induced
  by activation of PERK and the increase of NFκB induced by activation of TRAF2 contribute
  to enhance oxidative stress, further lead to a increase of PDI, p-TAU and accumulation
  of misfolded proteins which in turn increased the activation of the receptor IRE1α
  and PERK.
