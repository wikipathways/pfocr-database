caption: The degradation pathway for furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) by
  A. resinae ZN1. Solid boxes (a and b), the metabolic pathway were speculated on
  from experimental phenomena (a, furfural; b, HMF). Dotted boxes (c and d), blue
  (enzymes), green (substrates), and red (compounds) were speculated on based on the
  existing literature and chemical reactions. NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide;
  NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NADP+, oxidized form of dicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NADH, reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotid;
  TCA, tricarboxcylic acid.
