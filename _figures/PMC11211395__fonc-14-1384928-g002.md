caption: The metabolic modulation by SIRTs in cancer cells. SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT6
  significantly impact cancer cell metabolism by downregulating key pathways crucial
  for tumor growth. These sirtuins suppress HIF-1α and IRP1 target genes, affecting
  glycolytic processes by inhibiting genes such as PDK1, PFK, and Pfkm, alongside
  Glut1, which is vital for glucose transport. They also regulate iron metabolism
  by modulating the expression of DMT1 and other bivalent metal transporters, as well
  as ferritin and the transferrin receptor. The influence extends to MYC target genes,
  including ribosomal proteins Rpl3, Rpl6, Rpl23, and Rps15a, thereby reducing the
  metabolic rate encompassing aerobic glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle,
  and glutamine decomposition. Additionally, the activation of the mTORC1 pathway
  leads to CREB2 degradation, which results in decreased SIRT4 expression, illustrating
  a comprehensive mechanism by which these sirtuins suppress metabolic pathways to
  hinder cancer progression.
