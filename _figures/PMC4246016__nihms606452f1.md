caption: Liver resection or injury increases BA influx, which activates FXR in the
  liver and intestine. After activation, liver-FXR suppresses Cyp7a1 to reduce BA
  production and activates Foxm1b to stimulate liver regeneration. Intestine-FXR is
  also activated to induce FGF15 expression, which circulates with BAs back to liver
  through enterohepatic circulation. FGF15 binds to its receptor (FGFR) and initiate
  a signaling pathway to suppress Cyp7a1 expression. At the same time, FGF15 also
  promotes liver regeneration through unknown mechanism.
