caption: Schematic of the main interactions of glucose fatty acid oxidation. The FFA
  enters the cell through FATP 1 and 6, is converted to FFA-CoA in the cytosol, then
  it moves to the mitochondria through CPT I and II and acylcarnitine translocase.
  Inside the mitochondria, the acyl-CoA is transformed into acetyl-CoA to enter the
  Krebs cycle. Glucose enters the cell through the GLUT transporters and is converted
  to glucose-6-phosphate (glucose-6-P) in the cytosol. Glucose-6-P is converted to
  pyruvate and enters the mitochondria. Pyruvate is transformed into acetyl-CoA to
  enter the Krebs cycle. The glucose fatty acid oxidation cycle is the predominant
  regulator of the consumption of energetic substrates in the cell. Drug key enzymes
  (dichloroacetate, metformine, statins, and 2-tetradecylglycidic acid) could be used
  to favor an investigated pathway of energy metabolism.
