caption: Multiple factors within tumors promote immune tolerance and curb the anti-tumor
  immune response. Tumor cells secrete vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA),
  and VEGF signaling decreases dendritic cell (DC) costimulatory molecule expression
  and T cell priming, and encourages the formation of myeloid derived suppressor cells
  (MDSCs). VEGF antagonists, either as a monoclonal antibody (mAb; such as bevacizumab)
  or small molecule inhibitors (for example, sunitinib) reverse these deleterious
  effects and promote formation of potent anti-tumor T cells. Tumor cells also produce
  inflammatory mediators that promote tumorigenesis as well as encourage suppressor
  cell formation; these can be inhibited with PI3K and BRAF inhibitors respectively.
  Tregs and MDSCs are two immunosuppressive cell types that dampen immune responses.
  Tregs secrete immunosuppressive cytokines, whereas MDSCs use indoleamine-pyrrole
  2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) to deplete tryptophan and kill effector T cells. Sunitinib
  and imatinib both decrease the number and effectiveness of these suppressor cell
  types. Imatinib also directly inhibits IDO, decreasing MDSC suppressive capacity.
  Sunitinib and janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitors also block the signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, an immunosuppressive pathway favoring
  differentiation into regulatory cells and tumor growth. Decreasing STAT3 signaling
  diminishes formation of regulatory T cells and promotes the formation of effector
  Th1 T cells secreting interferon-γ (IFNγ).
