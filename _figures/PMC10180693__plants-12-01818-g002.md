caption: Schematization of metabolic pathway for phenylpropanoid (a), flavonoid (b),
  and circadian rhythm (c), as described by KEGG 111 after 1 h and 3 h from the end
  of UVB exposure in the peel of UV-B-treated peach fruit. Arrows indicate the path
  from reagent to product. Red arrows underline genes encoding for enzyme that resulted
  in being over-expressed after 1 h of recovery; similarly, green arrows underline
  over-expressed genes after 3 h of recovery; yellow arrows are over-expressed DEGs
  active during both recovery times. Black arrows are for not-differentially expressed
  genes in the related pathways. No under-expressed genes were retrieved for the investigated
  pathways. Genes involved in the metabolic pathway are written in italics. Concerning
  the circadian rhythm map (c), genes involved in cellular regulation are within the
  square.
