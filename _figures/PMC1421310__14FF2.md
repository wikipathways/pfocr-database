caption: Figure 2. The 6SBE-luc reporter construct. The pGL3-promoter vector was cut
  by two restriction enzymes, KpnI and SmaI. Six copies of the Smad-binding element
  (SBE) with KpnI and SmaI compatible (“sticky”) ends were then inserted in this site,
  in front of the SV40 minimal promoter and luciferase reporter gene. (Construct reported
  in Dai JL, Turnacioglu K, Schutte M, et al. Dpc4 transcriptional activation and
  dysfunction in cancer cells. Cancer Res 1998; 58:4592–4597.)
