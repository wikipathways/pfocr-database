caption: Comparison of CK2 knockout defects and Wnt pathway knockout defects, with
  a schema to indicate where in the pathway CK2 is believed to act. Both Dvl and β-catenin
  have been shown to be direct CK2 targets, and thus loss of CK2 is predicted to lead
  to downregulation of Dvl, β-catenin, and downstream Wnt signaling. Defects of embryos
  in which Dvl2 [], β-catenin [], the transcription factor Lef1/ Tcf1 [], and the
  putative Wnt target gene Cripto1 [] are described
