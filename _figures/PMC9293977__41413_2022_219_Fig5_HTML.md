caption: Anabolic osteoclasts. Osteoblasts stimulate osteoclastogenesis by producing
  RANKL as a forward signal. However, osteoclasts can act as anabolic cells by generating
  positive reverse signaling in osteoblasts. Both resorbing and apoptotic osteoclasts
  can release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contain RANK. Once discharged from
  EVs, RANK binds RANKL clusters on the osteoblast membrane and activates osteogenesis
  via the mTOR pathway. In addition, EphrinB2 signaling from osteoclasts to EphB4
  on osteoblasts/bone lining cells (BLCs)/reversal cells favors osteogenic differentiation
