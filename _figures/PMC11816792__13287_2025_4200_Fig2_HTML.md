caption: Wounds healing by exosomes derived from adipose stem cells containing lncRNA.
  Adipose stem cells, as pluripotent cells with high self-renewal capability, can
  play a prominent role in wound healing by releasing exosomes containing specific
  cellular contents, including LncRNAs. Among the most known and effective LncRNAs
  present in these exosomes are NEAT1, XIST, GAS5, H19, MALAT1, SENCR, and Linc00511,
  each of which contributes to the improvement of wounds through their unique molecular
  pathways. NEAT1 promotes the expression of UIL1 by inhibiting miR-17-5p and thus
  increases autophagic activity. MALAT1 increases cell migration and angiogenesis
  by inhibiting miR-124 and interacting with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Also, by inhibiting
  miR-374a-5p, MALAT1 improves mitochondrial function and inhibits apoptosis in fibroblasts.
  Furthermore, MALAT1 promotes the proliferation and migration of human skin fibroblasts
  (HSFs) by inhibiting miR-378a and increasing the expression of FGF2, and H19 enhances
  the proliferation and migration of HSFs by inhibiting miR-29b and increasing the
  expression of FBN1, and inhibiting miR-19b and increasing the expression of SOX9,
  then interacting with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. H19 also supports fibroblast proliferation,
  migration, and angiogenesis by activating STAT3. SENCR promotes angiogenesis in
  damaged tissue by increasing the expression of VEGF-A and Linc00511 by inhibiting
  PAQR3, which increases TWIST1. XIST increases DDR2 expression and proliferation
  and migration in mouse dermal fibroblasts (MDFs) cells by inhibiting miR-96-5p.
  GAS5 accelerates wound healing by reducing inflammation through interaction with
  TLR7 and regulation of inflammatory pathway genes
