caption: In R/R cardiomyocytes, increased levels of ANRIL silences CDKN2A and, therefore,
  in response to stress—for example, stiffening—JNK phosphorylates and activates downstream
  targets that downregulate connexin-43. In cardiomyocytes without the risk haplotype,
  there is insufficient ANRIL to silence p16, so stress-mediated JNK phosphorylation
  is blocked and connexin-43 expression is maintained. Short dashed lines indicate
  portions of the pathway inferred from the literature–. p14/Arf, p14 is also known
  as Arf; p15/CDKN2B, p15 is also known as CDKN2B; p16/CDKN2A, p16 is also known as
  CDKN2A.
