caption: Multiple growth factor receptors are activated at the cell surface during
  cancer. Activation of these receptors activates several downstream signaling pathways.
  Among these pathways the Ras-MAPK, the P13K-Akt, mTOR and NF-κB pathways are of
  significance and targets of DIM. By dephosphorylating these molecules, DIM modulates
  downstream signaling pathways impinging on proliferation, angiogenesis and apoptosis.
  NF-kB pathway is inactive as a result of the binding of p50 and p65 to IκB. When
  IκB is phosphorylated by IKKs and degraded, p50 and p65 are set free and are translocated
  into the nucleus to activate a specific set of genes. This pathway has been shown
  to be inhibited both in vitro and in vivo by DIM. Activation of AP-1 is primarily
  mediated by MAPK, especially through the phosphorylation by c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK), which leads to translocation of AP-1 and subsequent transcriptional activation
  of target genes
