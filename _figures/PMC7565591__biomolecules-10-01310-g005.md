caption: Role of alternative splicing in flowering time regulation in Arabidopsis
  thaliana. The transition from vegetative development to flowering requires the key
  gene FT, whose expression is induced by CO and repressed by FLM. Light-mediated
  changes in alternative splicing lead to an increase in CO-α, which promotes flowering,
  while CO-β-based dimers are degraded via COP1-mediated protein degradation. In contrast,
  higher temperatures promote alternative splicing of FLM leading to non-functional
  FLM variants (FLM-X), which are degraded through the NMD pathway. Splicing influence
  is shown in blue and inhibition is shown in red, while positive induction is shown
  in green.
