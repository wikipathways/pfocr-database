caption: Integrin activation, signaling, and function. Talin activation enables the
  specific binding of talin to the cytoplasmic tail of the β integrin subunit, which
  in turn separates the cytoplasmic tails of the αβ subunits, inducing a conformational
  change in the integrin from a bent conformation to a primed state. Kindlin also
  activates integrin by strengthening the association between talin and the β subunit
  tail. Subsequently, the integrin extends its conformation to become activated through
  binding to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and mechanical forces, thereby promoting
  integrin clustering and adhesion complex formation. The complex then upregulates
  various downstream signaling pathways, which ultimately lead to cellular functions
