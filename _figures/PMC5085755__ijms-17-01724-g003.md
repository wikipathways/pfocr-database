caption: Functions of three members of the UBXD protein family (UBXN1, P47, and FAF1)
  that are potentially involved in the prevention of cancer. It has been well established
  that aberrant regulation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and its downstream cascade
  are involved in several aspects of tumor progression as well as resistance to chemo-
  and radio-therapies. The NF-κB signaling pathway is regulated by a network of intermediate
  and adaptor proteins. UBXN1, p47, and FAF1 can target and inhibit several of these
  key regulatory proteins and block transcription of oncogenic genes activated by
  the NF-κB pathway. TNFα = tumor necrosis factor α, TNF-R1 = tumor necrosis factor
  receptor 1, TRADD = TNFR1-associated death domain protein. TRAF2 = tumor necrosis
  factor receptor-associated factor 2, NEMO = NF-κB essential modulator, IKKα and
  IKKβ = IκB kinase complex (IKK)-α and IκB kinase complex (IKK)-β, cIAP1 and cIAP2
  = cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 and 2. The thin black arrow stands for the poly
  ubiquitination process. Initiation or activation is shown by thick black arrows
  and inhibition is shown by brown T-bars.
