caption: 'Proposed model of effects of n-3 supplementation on the ECS in blood, liver
  and adipose tissue in peripartum dairy cows. n-3 supplementation reduces plasma
  AEA through reduced AA, this may result in reduction of CB1 receptor gene transcription
  levels in WBCs and liver. In AT, the increased MLXIPL and SREBP gene transcription
  may lead to increased lipogenesis. Increased LIPE and MGLL could result in the release
  of more FAs from the AT. These FAs can move to the liver and be converted to diacylglycerols
  (DAGs) by long-chain fatty acyl-CoA (LCFA-coA). In the liver, DAGs are converted
  to 2-AG by diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGLA). DAGs may activate through IkB kinase
  (IKKB) signalling pathway that can induce nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1)
  gene transcription. The decrease in IL6 transcription levels may possibly lead to
  reduced inflammation and high regeneration of the liver. The green colour marks
  factors that were increased in the present study, while the Red marks factors that
  have been decreased. Genes are represented in italics. AEA: Anandamide; 2-AG: 2-Arachidonoylglycerol;
