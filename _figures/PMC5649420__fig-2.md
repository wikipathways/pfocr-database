caption: TLR4 signaling in response to ligand binding, either directly to the TLR
  or through cooperative interactions with various coreceptors, mobilizes two major
  core parallel pathways, resulting in the activation of the transcription factor
  NF-κB and the p38/JNK MAP kinases via the upstream intermediate MyD88. The collateral
  or noncanonical pathways that impact TLR4 signaling outcomes involve several Src
  family kinases, transactivation of the EGFR (and downstream signaling intermediates),
  integrins, and the caveolin-1/FAK/RhoA/Rock/PTEN axis, as well as the canonical
  SMAD-dependent TGF-β pathway. The complex interactions among these diverse, although
  inter-related, pathways positively and negatively regulate the outcome of TLR4 signaling
  (detailed in this review). The available data suggest that while Akt activation
  may attenuate the amplitude and duration of the inflammatory response following
  TLR4 signaling, TGF-β1 regulation of RhoA/ROCK signaling controls PTEN activity
  that, in turn, affects SMAD2/3 transcription of the profibrotic genes (e.g., PAI-1,
  CTGF) through the SMAD phosphatase PPM1A. Akt, protein kinase B; CTGF, connective
  tissue growth factor; ECM, extracellular matrix; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor;
  PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog;
  ROCK, rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase; SMAD, Sma+mothers against
  decapentaplegic; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; TLR4, toll-like receptor 4.

  description: TLR4 signaling in response to ligand binding, either directly to the
    TLR or through cooperative interactions with various coreceptors, mobilizes two
    major core parallel pathways, resulting in the activation of the transcription
    factor NF-κB and the p38/JNK MAP kinases via the upstream intermediate MyD88.
    The collateral or noncanonical pathways that impact TLR4 signaling outcomes involve
    several Src family kinases, transactivation of the EGFR (and downstream signaling
    intermediates), integrins, and the caveolin-1/FAK/RhoA/Rock/PTEN axis, as well

    that while Akt activation may attenuate the amplitude and duration of the inflammatory
    response following TLR4 signaling, TGF-β1 regulation of RhoA/ROCK signaling controls
    PTEN activity that, in turn, affects SMAD2/3 transcription of the profibrotic
