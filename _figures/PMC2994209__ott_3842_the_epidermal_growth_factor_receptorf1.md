caption: 'HER receptors and their ligands. Despite their structural homology, HER
  receptors differ in their ligand specificities. Some of these ligands bind exclusively
  to EGFR, such as EGF, TGF-α, and AREG, or bind exclusively to HER-4, such as NRG3
  and NRG4. Others have a dual specificity. So far, no ligand has been described for
  HER-2, whereas HER-3 is characterized by impaired kinase activity. HER receptors
  achieve activation by forming ligand-bound homo-and/or heterodimeric receptor complexes.
  Ten possible dimers can be formed (Only a few examples of dimers are presented here).
  HER-2 is known to be the preferred heterodimerisation partner for EGFR, HER-3 and
  HER-4. The HER-2/HER-3 heterodimer constitutes the most mitogenic dimer in the family.
  The HER complexes signal from the cell surface to the nucleus through numerous downstream
  pathways such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)-Akt, Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK-dependent
  pathway, PLC–PKC, and JAK/STAT. These signaling cascades eventually transmit their
  signal to TFs, which affect the transcription of target genes, regulating critical
  tumorigenic processes including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis,
  and migration.Abbreviations: EGF, epidermal growth factor; TGF-α, transforming growth
  factor-α; HB-EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like ligand; AREG, amphiregulin; EREG, Epiregulin;
  BTC, Betacellulin; NRG, neuregulin; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (Erk) kinase; PLC, phospholipase C; PKC, protein kinase C; JAK, janus kinase; STAT,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription; TFs, transcription factors.'
