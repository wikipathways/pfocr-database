caption: Zn and Zn transporters are indispensable for FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation.
  Zn is required for multiple steps of FcεRI-induced mast cell activation, including
  degranulation and cytokine production. Cytosolic Zn regulates the FcεRI-induced
  granule translocation process, which is mediated by a Fyn/Grb2-associated binder
  2 (Gab2)/Ras homologue gene family member A (RhoA)-mediated calcium-independent
  pathway. Zn and ZnT5 are also required for the translocation of PKC to the plasma
  membrane and the subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which leads to the production
  of cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α).
