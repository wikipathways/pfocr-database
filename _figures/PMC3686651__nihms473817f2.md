caption: Binding of the chemokine (red) to the GPCR involves interaction of the N
  terminus of the chemokine with the N terminus of the receptor. Once ligand binding
  has occurred, the associated G-protein is activated and dissociates leading to downstream
  activation of PLC, MAPK or a number of other signaling pathways depending on the
  chemokine involved, each leading to different downstream pathways responsible for
  actions, such as calcium mobilization, proliferation or migration, leading to chemotaxis.
