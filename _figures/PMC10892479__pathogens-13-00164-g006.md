caption: 'A visual representation of how Jinhua Qinggan granules (JHQG) mitigate acute
  lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice. LPS triggers inflammatory
  responses through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, leading to excessive production
  of proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and subsequent tissue
  damage. Furthermore, the activated NF-κB enhances the presence of anti-apoptotic
  proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, while inhibiting the activity of caspase 3/7, ultimately
  prolonging the survival of neutrophils. In contrast, treatment with JHQG suppresses
  the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and facilitates neutrophil apoptosis by reducing Mcl-1
  and Bcl-xL and activating caspase 3/7. This demonstrates the protective effect of
  JHQG in ALI. Bcl-xL: B-cell lymphoma-extra-large; NF-κB: Nuclear factor-κB; IL:
  Interleukin; TNFα: Tumor necrosis factor α; MyD88: Myeloid differentiation primary
  response gene 88; TLR: Tol-like receptor; Mcl-1: Myeloid leukemia 1 (Recreated based
  on Zhu et al. [162])'
