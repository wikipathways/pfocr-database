caption: Schematic drawing showed activated HFSCs contributed to SN development. DMBA
  combined with TPA treatment disturbed the homeostasis of SGs and induced SN development
  during which HFSCs were activated and possibly induced to migrate towards SNs. And
  Wnt10b/β-catenin signaling pathway was activated to promote proliferation and differentiation
  of HFSCs in SNs.
