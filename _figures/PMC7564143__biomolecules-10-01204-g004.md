caption: 'A simplified overview of the classic Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. The core
  of this Hippo-YAP is a cascade of kinase activation. When the Hippo pathway is activated
  by cell-cell contact, cytokine or mechanical stress, LATS1/2 and MST1/2 are recruited
  to the plasma membrane by NF-2 and scaffold protein Salvador (Sav) respectively.
  MST then activates LATS by phosphorylation. Active LATS then phosphorylates YAP
  and its binding protein angiomotin protein (AMOT) to inhibit nuclear localization
  of YAP. Phosphorylated AMOT, bound to YAP, dissociates from F-actin and translocates
  to the cytoplasm, where the complex will be degraded via the ubiquitin–proteasome
  system. Upon inactivation, YAP is dephosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus,
  where it interacts with TEAD transcription factors to promote cell cycle and anti-apoptosis
  gene transcription. Nuclear YAP can also enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling by binding
  to b-Catenin/TCF transcription activation complex. NF-2: Neurofibromin 2; YAP: yes-associated
  protein 1; LATS1/2: Large tumor suppressor kinase ½; TEAD: TEA domain family member.
