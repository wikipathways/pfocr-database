caption: The canonical NF-κB pathway can be stimulated by a variety of receptors,
  but here we depict TLR4 activation. Upon binding LPS, TLR4 homo-dimerizes and the
  resultant conformational change recruits Mal and MyD88. This in turn recruits IRAK-4
  and IRAK-1 and the proximity results in IRAK-1 phosphorylation by IRAK-4. Phosphorylated
  IRAK-1 leaves the receptor complex and engages with TRAF6, which interacts with
  the enzyme complex Uev1A and Ubc13. This leads to lysine-63 polyubiquinitaion of
  TRAF6, followed by the docking of TAB 2/3 and TAK1. TAK1 becomes auto-phosphorylated
  and activates the IKK complex by phosphorylating the IKKβ subunit, liberating p50
  and RelA to translocate into the nucleus.
