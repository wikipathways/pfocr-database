caption: The Proposed impact of the MM500 study data under the clinical treatment
  cycle, where the patient from a healthy state enters into a progressive disease
  evolvement process. The first indication of early melanoma disease onset is discovered
  by an image capture, for example, CT (high resolution), and/or MR, accompanied by
  a genomic mutation signature, along with protein localization and expression. Assignments
  of posttranslational modifications, as well as pathway biology activations, and
  histopathology characterizations added to the disease status. Based on the diagnosis
  output, a dedicated and optimized drug treatment is presented to the patient. The
  melanoma disease cycle is reinforced upon metastasis development, that entails a
  resistance build up
