caption: Topology of the HOG signaling pathway in yeast. This pathway topology was
  proposed as the best approximating model topology in []. We used this model as our
  true model ODE T for data generation in our simulations on HOG signaling pathway.
  The black lines with small arrow tips depict the transition between different species
  in the model like production, degradation or complex formation. The black lines
  with circle tips depict the phosphorylation process by kinases. The lines with open
  triangle tips show activating regulatory interactions where as lines with blunt
  ends show deactivating regulatory interactions. The red colored double arrow denotes
  the post translational regulation of glycerol production by the active phosphorylated
  Hog1 protein. We removed this regulatory interaction in our simplified model ODES.
