caption: 'Scheme of novel pathways in AKI to CKD progression. (1) Cell cycle arrest
  and senescence: in overt renal tubular injuries, cellular senescence/TASCC formation
  is present in proximal tubular cells, resulting in a profibrotic cell cycle arrest
  at the G2/M phase. Deletion of DDR protein such as ATR in proximal tubules exacerbates
  maladaptive repair. (2) Inflammation: inflammatory responses after AKI upregulates
  cytokine/chemokine release including IL-1 and TNF-α, which subsequently activates
  downstream MyD88-mediated NF-κB production and necrosome formation. Complement activation,
  increased lymphangiogenesis and persistent infiltration of immune cells, also have
  been implicated in AKI to CKD transition. (3) Hypoxia: reduced O2 delivery and vascular
  rarefaction contribute to hypoxia-mediated tubular injuries. Increased miR-493 is
  associated with G2/M arrest, and the deletion of FoxO3 leads to increased autophagy
  and oxidative stress. (4) Hippo/YAP/TAZ pathway: secretion of TGF-β after AKI increases
  the nuclear accumulation of TAZ, and activates myofibroblast in concert with CTGF,
  leading to maladaptive repair and interstitial fibrosis. (5) Mitochondrial dysfunction:
  dysregulated fatty acid oxidation (FAO) leads to reduced ATP generation and excessive
  oxidative stress. Lack of phosphorylated ACC increased malonyl-CoA formation, which
  inhibits free fatty acid utilization by blocking CPT1 transporter. Translocation
  of mtDNA during tubular injury triggers the STING pathway, enhancing cytokine production
  and inflammation. ATR, Ataxia Telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related; TASCC, rapamycin
  (TOR)-autophagy spatial coupling compartment; RIPK1, receptor-interacting serine-threonine
  protein kinase; MLKL, mixed lineage kinase domain-like; STMN-1, Stathmin-1; TGF-β,
  transforming growth factor-beta; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; YAP, yes-associated
  protein; TAZ, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif; ACC, acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; CPT, carnitine palmitoyl transferase; STING, cGAS-stimulator of interferon
