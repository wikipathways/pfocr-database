caption: The Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway. TLR activation initiates the innate
  immune response, which is thought to lead to the detrimental cytokine cascade in
  chronic pain. Activation of TLR signaling proceeds via a family of adaptor proteins
  which includes the protein MyD88, the interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase,
  Toll interacting protein, and the adapter protein TRAF6. These proteins activate
  the kinase TAK1, which ultimately leads to the activation of signaling cascades
  including nuclear factor κB and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.
  The activation of these pathways can then direct the synthesis of cytokines such
  as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6).
  Both TLRs and receptors for IL-1β have similar structures and share a cytoplasmic
  motif. Activation of both types of receptors recruits a scaffolding complex that
  leads to upregulation of the production of similar cytokines
