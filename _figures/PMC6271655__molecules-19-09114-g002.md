  and products are shown. Where known, enzyme classes are indicated. In many cases
  the specific enzyme has not been identified yet. ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; C4H,
  cinnamate-4-hydroxylase; CCL, coumaryl-CoA ligase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3'H,
  flavanone-3'-hydroxylase; F3H, flavanone-3-hydroxylase; NCS, Naringenin chalcone
  synthase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; SbDFR1, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase
  1; SbDFR3, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase 3; SbFNS2, flavone synthase 2. Pathway adapted
  from [,].
