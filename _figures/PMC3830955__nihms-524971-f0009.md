caption: (A) NHE6/TrkB signaling endosome in a wild-type neuron. Left. Schema of an
  endosome. Acidification is regulated by the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) which
  pumps protons into the endosome lumen, and NHE6 which allows for proton exit via
  exchange with Na+. On the right, TrkB endosome signaling (radio-waves) is depicted.
  With binding of BDNF, TrkB is endocytosed and signals from within endosomes. Endosomes
  are either recycled or traffic through a series of increasingly acidic endosomal
  compartments leading to degradation in the lysosome. This signaling process contributes
  substantially to promoting arborization in developing neurons. (B) Depiction of
  NHE6/TrkB signaling endosome in the NHE6 null neuron. Left. Without NHE6 proton
  exit from the endosome is impeded resulting in accelerated acidification of the
  endosome. On the right, upon BDNF binding and endocytosis, the endosomal lumen has
  accelerated acidification which results in increased degradation of TrkB and attenuated
  TrkB signaling which leads to an impoverishment of axonal and dendritic arbors.
