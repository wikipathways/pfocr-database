caption: 'Interactions between tumor cells, bone microenvironment, and angiogenesis
  in bone metastases: This figure illustrates the complex interplay of cellular and
  molecular mechanisms involved in bone metastasis. Tumor cells in the bone microenvironment
  secrete interleukins (IL-8 and IL-11), which stimulate pre-osteoclasts’ maturation
  into osteoclasts. The receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)
  expressed by osteoblasts binds to RANK on osteoclasts, promoting osteoclast activity
  and bone resorption. This process is crucial for the remodeling of the bone matrix
  and the establishment of metastases. Additionally, the Wnt signaling pathway, depicted
  in the bottom left, influences the regulation of osteoblast and osteoclast functions,
  critical for maintaining bone homeostasis and metastatic progression. The top right
  section highlights the role of angiogenesis in supporting tumor growth and metastasis,
  mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFRs),
  regulated through hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1α and HIF-1β). These interactions
  underscore potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in managing bone metastases'
