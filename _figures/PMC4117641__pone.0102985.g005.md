caption: Four human orthologues of worm screen gene products (MOB4, TCP1, CCT8 and
  ACTB) have +1 interactomes that overlap more than expected with the +1 interactome
  of the GWAS white+grey gene products. Two of these are components of the abundant
  cytoplasmic TRiC/CCT chaperone, the third (MOB4) interacts closely and fourth (ACTB),
  along with tubulin, is an important substrate. TRiC/CCT interacts with STK24 and
  PP2a to form a complex that regulates the MAPK pathway. This network of interactions
  may have a bearing on tau phosphorylation and neuronal regeneration.
