  Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels in the blood can be utilized as a predictor
  of early atherosclerosis. Trimellitic anhydride (TMA) is derived from digested and
  absorbed foods containing choline or trimethylamine ingredients and then oxidized
  to TMAO by flavin monooxygenases (FMOs) secreted by the liver. This process could
  be inhibited by regulating the intestinal flora after GB treatment. In addition,
  a high-fat diet (HFD) resulted in higher levels of TG, TC, and LDL-C in serum, which
  were positively correlated with atherosclerosis. GB significantly attenuated the
  abnormal lipid and cholesterol metabolism induced by HFD. On the other hand, GB
  can improve resistance to ferroptosis through the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thereby
  improving the pathological process of atherosclerosis. In addition to ameliorating
  HFD-induced atherosclerosis, GB also reduces endothelial dysfunction after high
  glucose treatment by inhibiting PAF-R and TLR4 binding, and it can treat diabetes
  mellitus by protecting β cells.
