caption: The main pathways of neural energy metabolism. Depicted are the main substrates
  and pathways of cellular energy metabolism in the adult brain. In general, the brain
  utilizes glucose as an obligatory fuel and makes use of ketone bodies under certain
  conditions such as fasting or strenuous physical activity. Neurons also metabolize
  glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway to generate NADPH, which protects
  neurons from oxidative stress. Astrocytes can synthesize glycogen from glucose and
  mobilize it to support the energy demands of both astrocytes and neurons. GLUT,
  glucose transporter; MCT, monocarboxylate transporter; GR, glutathione reductase;
  Gpx, glutathione peroxidase; MPC, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; G-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; GA3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; R-5-P,
  ribulose 5-phosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; GSSG, oxidized glutathione;
  GSH, reduced glutathione; ROOH, hydroperoxides.
