caption: Schematic illustration of the ERDJ4-mediated ER-stress response. Under control
  conditions, the IRE1α/BiP complex is stabilized by ERDJ4, thereby inhibiting the
  IRE1α-induced signaling pathway. When increasing amounts of misfolded protein accumulate
  in the ER, ERDJ4 binds to it to transport it to BiP for initiation of its refolding
  (ER stress). Upon dissociation of ERDJ4 and BiP from the IRE1α/BiP/ERDJ4 complex,
  the IRE1α signaling pathway is initiated causing splicing of Xbp1 mRNA and its translation
  into XBP1 protein, which travels to the nucleus to activate transcription of chaperones,
  such as ERdj4
