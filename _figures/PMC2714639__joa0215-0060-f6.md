caption: MT1-MMP expression in first trimester trophoblasts is stimulated by insulin,
  IGF1 and IGF2 by different signalling pathways. Insulin signals via the two isoforms
  of the insulin receptor, i.e. IR 11+ and IR 11−. IGF1 binds to the IGF1R, whereas
  IGF2 binds to IGF1R as well as to IR 11−. The pathways activated by the receptor
  tyrosine kinases ultimately inducing MT1-MMP transcription differ. Insulin receptor
  signalling is inhibited by Wortmannin, which blocks the PI3K/PKB pathway. In contrast,
  IGF1R signalling is abolished by U0126, an inhibitor of the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway.
  The IGF2-induced up-regulation of MT1-MMP is inhibited by both compounds ().
