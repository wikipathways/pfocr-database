caption: (A) Scheme of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in plant cells. Anthocyanins
  are synthesized by a multienzyme complex loosely associated to the endoplasmic reticulum
  (CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase;
  F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin oxidase; UFGT, UDP-glucose flavonoid 3-O-glucosyl
  transferase; MT, methyltransferase). Proanthocyanidins (PAs) synthesis branches
  off the anthocyanin pathway (LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANR, anthocyanidin
  reductase; STS, stilbene synthase); the black arrows refer to biosynthetic steps
  missing in grapevine. Numbers next to the flavonoid groups are related to the chemical
  structures shown in (B). (B) Chemical structures of the major flavonoid groups.
