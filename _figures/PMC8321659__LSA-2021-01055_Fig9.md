caption: (1) The activation of the AKT-mTOR pathway during neuronal aging triggers
  the degradation of the intracellular cholesterol transporter Niemann Pick disease,
  type C protein (NPC1), what induces the accumulation of cholesterol in endosomal
  compartments. (2) This in turn induces multivesicular bodies (MVBs) to generate
  a higher number of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs, called exosomes when they are secreted)
  in their lumen. (3) Decreased levels of NPC1 provoke a low endosome-to-ER cholesterol
  transport, what triggers the activation of the Sterol regulatory element-binding
  proteins through the Golgi and its translocation to the nucleus. There, sterol regulatory
  element-binding protein activates the transcription of the microRNA miR-33 located
  in the intronic region of the Srebf2 gene, after binding its sterol response element
  (SRE). (4) miR-33 blocks the synthesis of NPC1 by targeting its mRNA, what aggravates
  the accumulation of endosomal cholesterol and the formation of ILVs.
