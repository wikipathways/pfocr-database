caption: Interactions among some of the hormonal and developmental signals and regulatory
  elements controlling seed maturation.In the upper portion (“Accumulation”), factors
  regulating gene expression during the progression through seed development are shown
  in boxes representing the relative timing and abundance of their expression. ABA
  accumulation is depicted in pale red triangles. PYL5 is the ABA receptor that is
  most highly expressed in mid-seed development, and therefore likely to mediate ABA
  signaling during this stage. To simplify the diagram, intermediates in this signaling
  pathway are not shown (see Fig.4 for details). In the lower portion (“Roles”), the
  events regulated by specific factors are shown. In both parts, arrows represent
  positive regulation and red bars indicate repression.
