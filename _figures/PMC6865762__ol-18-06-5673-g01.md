caption: 'Mechanisms of estrogen signaling. Direct pathway: When estrogen binds to
  the nuclear receptor, it forms an estrogen-receptor complex, which changes the conformation
  of the receptor, forming a dipolymer and exposing the DNA binding region. The complex
  enters the nucleus through the nuclear pore in the form of a dipolymer. Activated
  ERα/β can directly combine with ERE and subsequently interacts with the target gene
  or with other transcription factors, forming a complex, which promotes activity
  of regulatory proteins located at the promoter sites of target genes. This results
  in an increase in the mRNA expression and thus potentially protein expression levels
  of the target gene. Indirect pathway: GPER is rapidly activated by intracellular
  PCAF combining with estrogen-like substances. Activated GPER directly associates
  with CBP/P300 and interacts with the target gene or with other transcription factors,
  forming complexes such as the proto-oncogene Fos/jun and SP-1, which promotes activity
  of regulatory proteins located at the promoter sites of target genes. ER, estrogen
  receptor; GPER, G protein-coupled estrogen receptor; CBP/P300, transcription complex
  auxiliary activation factor; PCAF, P300/CBP-related factors; ERE, estrogen response
  element.'
