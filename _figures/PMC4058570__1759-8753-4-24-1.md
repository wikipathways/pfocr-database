caption: Introductory cartoons. (a) The organization of IS607 and its proposed transposition
  pathway. IS607 and related mobile DNA elements encode a serine transposase, TnpA2,
  and a second protein of unknown function, TnpB. The transposon ends are cartooned
  as green triangles. Excision creates a circular intermediate (NDF Grindley, personal
  communication) and reseals the original host DNA backbone. The circle can then integrate
  into a new location on the original DNA molecule, or, as cartooned, a new target
  DNA molecule (blue). (b) Sequences of the IS607 and ISC1904 ends. The deduced overlap
  dinucleotide at the host DNA/IS element junction (the crossover site) is in bold
  and underlined (blue); the small repeats that may be specific binding sites for
  the transposase are in bold (red), and other repeats are underlined (green). The
  latter repeats may be too far from the crossover dinucleotide for one protomer to
  interact with both motifs, and could play some other (regulatory?) role. The flanking
  host DNA sequences (lower case) are different at all insertion sites, and show little
  obvious pattern. (c) Domain organization of serine recombinases. The conserved catalytic
  domain of serine recombinases is always found at the N-terminus, except in serine
  transposases of the IS607 family, which have a MerR-family DNA binding domain at
  the N-terminus. “Canonical” serine recombinases, which include the resolvases and
  invertases, have a small C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain. “Large”
  serine recombinases, which include bacteriophage integrases and some transposases,
  have a much larger C-terminal region that contains two DNA binding domains [].
