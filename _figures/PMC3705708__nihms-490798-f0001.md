caption: (A) Hh signaling in Drosophila. In the absence of Hh (left), Ptc prevents
  Smo membrane localization and activation so that Smo is retained on intracellular
  vesicles. In this context, full-length Ci (yellow, indicating partial activity)
  is held in a microtubule-associated complex containing the kinesin-like protein
  Costal2 (Cos2), the kinase Fused (Fu), and Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), which promotes
  phosphorylation of Ci by PKA, GSK3, and CK1 and its partial proteasomal processing
  into a transcriptional repressor form (CiR, red). Binding of Hh to the receptor
  complex composed of Ptc and an Ihog co-receptor (Ihog or Boi, right) results in
  internalization of the ligand-receptor complex and phosphorylation and translocation
  of Smo to the plasma membrane, where it interacts with Cos2 to partially disrupt
  the microtubule-associated complex, leading to release of Ci and activation of the
  heterotrimeric Gi protein. Ci is subsequently converted into a fully active labile
  transcriptional activator (CiA, blue) by an unknown mechanism. (B) Hh signaling
  in vertebrates. Hh signaling in vertebrates is similar to Hh signaling in Drosophila,
  with the important distinction that signaling takes place on primary cilia. When
  a Hh ligand binds to the receptor complex formed by Ptc and an Ihog co-receptor
  (Cdo, Boc, or Gas1), Smo translocates to both the plasma membrane and to the primary
  cilium, where it regulates Gli processing and activation.
