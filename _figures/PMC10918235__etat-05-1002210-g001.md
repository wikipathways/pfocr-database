caption: 'Glucose metabolism in normal and malignant cells and cells with monocarboxylate
  transporter (MCT) inhibition. Upper left panel: glucose metabolism of normal cells.
  All the pyruvate is metabolized through the Krebs cycle. Lower left panel: pyruvate
  is mainly catabolized to lactate, although a smaller proportion still follows the
  Krebs cycle pathway. Lactate is exported to the extracellular space by MCTs. Right
  panel: when MCTs are inhibited lactate cannot leave the cell and accumulates in
  the cytoplasm. In this situation, to avoid excessive and toxic lactate accumulation,
  the cell needs to revert to oxidative metabolism (not shown in the diagram). Normal
  cells can also adopt an anaerobic metabolism under hypoxic conditions. However normal
  cells return to oxidative metabolism as soon as hypoxia disappears (Pasteur effect),
  while cancer cells continue with mainly glycolytic metabolism (Warburg effect or
  aerobic glycolysis)'
