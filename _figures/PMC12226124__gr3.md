caption: Schematic representation of canonical and non-canonical inflammasome activation.
  The formation of the inflammasome via the canonical pathway occurs when PAMPs, DAMPs
  or other cytosolic disturbances are detected, resulting in the recruitment and activation
  of caspase-1, either directly or through the recruitment of the adaptor protein
  ASC. Caspase-1 initiates the process of maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into
  their active forms, in addition to cleaving GSDM-D. This, in turn, interacts with
  the plasma membrane, creating pores and resulting in the release of intracellular
  content, including the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Activation of the
  non-canonical inflammasome begins with the detection of cytosolic LPS by caspase-4/caspase-5
  (or pro-caspase-11 in mice), triggering the cleavage of GSDM-D and subsequent pyroptosis.
