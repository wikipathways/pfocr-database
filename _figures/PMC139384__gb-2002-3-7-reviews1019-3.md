caption: 'The major signaling pathways activated in response to oxidative stress.
  ROS can originate from metabolic activity or from external environmental signals
  and are modulated by antioxidants to nontoxic levels at which point they serve as
  signaling molecules. ROS can activate gene transcription in two ways: either via
  transcription factors (such as, NFκB, AP-1 and ARE-binding proteins, ARE-BP) that
  can interact directly with specific DNA motifs, including ARE, on promoters of target
  genes; or via activation of MAP kinase cascades, which in turn activate transcription
  factors that trigger target gene transcription. The degree to which a given pathway
  is activated is dependent on the nature and duration of the stress, as well as on
  cell type and developmental stage.'
