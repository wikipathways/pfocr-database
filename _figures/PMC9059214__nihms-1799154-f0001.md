caption: (A) A convergent signaling pathway for the function of proteases in stress-induced
  cellular and physiological responses. Environmental stresses activate proteases
  to generate active peptide ligands, which further activate cell surface-resident
  receptor and downstream intracellular signaling and physiological responses. (B)
  Schematic of plant protease-mediated cleavage of proligands and activation of receptor
  signaling. Cell damage by wounding or perception of the bacterial pathogens, such
  as P. syringae, by pattern recognition receptor (PRR)/BAK1 receptor complex, leads
  to increased cytosolic Ca2+, which activates MC4 and other type-II metacaspases.
  Activated MC4 cleaves ProPep1 to release Pep1 from the cytosolic side of the tonoplast,
  where Pep1 is perceived by PEPR/BAK1 receptor complex to activate immune responses.
  Upon activation, BAK1 phosphorylates cytoplasmic BIK1 kinase, which further phosphorylates
  Ca2+ channel CNGCs, leading to Ca2+ influx. It was also reported that coreceptor
  BAK1 undergoes a Ca2+-dependent protease-mediated cleavage to release a truncated
  C-terminal BAK1 fragment (BAK1CTF), which is involved in BAK1-regulated immunity,
  development, and cell death control []. The tomato P69B cleaves the autoinhibitory
  prodomain of ProRcr3 to generate mature Rcr3, which binds C. fulvum effector Avr2
  and is subsequently recognized by the Cf-2/SOBIR1/BAK1 tripartite complex, leading
  to the immune activation. P69B also cleaves P. infestans effector PC2 to release
  an active peptide ligand, which is perceived by an unknown cell surface-resident
  receptor and activates BAK1-dependent immune signaling. Tomato subtilase (SBT) SlPhy1/2
  cleave prosystemin to generate Leu-systemin (L-systemin), which is then cleaved
  by a leucine aminopeptidase to produce active systemin. Systemin is recognized by
  tomato cell surface-resident SYR1/2 receptors and activates wounding signaling and
  resistance to herbivores. SlPhy2 also processes tomato ProPSK to generate active
  PSK peptides under drought stress, resulting in premature abscission of tomato flowers.
  Drought stress also leads to ProPSK1 processing by SBT3.8 in Arabidopsis. Active
  PSK might be perceived by PSKR1/2-BAK1/SERK receptor complex and regulate plant
  tolerance to drought. SBTs or unknown protease(s) cleave IDA to generate mature
  IDA (mIDA) peptide, which is perceived by HAE/HSL2-BAK1/SERK receptor complex and
  regulate drought/pathogen-induced leaf abscission in Arabidopsis.
