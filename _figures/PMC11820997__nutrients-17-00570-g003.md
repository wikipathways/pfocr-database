caption: Beneficial effects of hydroxytyrosol (HTyr) on insulin signaling through
  the enhancement of insulin signaling pathways. The polyphenol hydroxytyrosol (HTyr)
  in olive oil positively affects insulin signaling by strengthening critical insulin
  pathways. By stimulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and IRS-1 (insulin receptor
  substrate 1), it increases insulin sensitivity and facilitates the uptake and metabolism
  of glucose. Furthermore, HTyr supports improved glucose regulation and metabolic
  health by lowering oxidative stress and inflammation, which helps minimize insulin
  resistance
