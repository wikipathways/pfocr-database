caption: 'Sensing of SARS-CoV-2SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA can be sensed by different RNA-driven
  pattern recognition receptors. Which RNA sensor is activated is determined by the
  mechanisms of viral entry: membrane fusion (indicated for the epithelial cell on
  the left) or viral particle uptake (indicated for the pDC on the right). Fusion
  of the SARS-CoV-2 membrane with the cellular membrane of epithelial cells requires
  the cellular receptors ACE2, TMRPSS2, and in some cases, NRP1/CD304. This allows
  the viral RNA to be detected by cytosolic RNA sensors RIG-I/MDA5, which will activate
  transcription factors IRF3 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), leading to production
  of type I IFNα, type III IFNλ1, and various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
  SARS-CoV-2 utilizes several mechanisms to counter sensing via the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway
  and subsequent IFN production, which is reviewed in detail elsewhere (). Uptake
  of viral particles, for example, by endocytosis, does not require the receptors
  that mediate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Instead, the virus is engulfed
  into a cellular vesicle, where it triggers TLR7, starting a signaling cascade that
  includes MyD88 and IRAK4, ultimately activating the transcription factors IRF7 and
  NF-κB that will facilitate production of type I IFNα, type III IFNλ1, CXCL10, and
  other cytokines and chemokines. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with NRP1/CD304 can
  inhibit IFNα production by pDCs, but the molecular mechanisms are currently unknown.
  pDCs can also sense SARS-CoV-2’s glycosylated envelope protein via TLR2, and this
  leads specifically to IL-6 production in pDCs. Figure was created with BioRender.com.'
