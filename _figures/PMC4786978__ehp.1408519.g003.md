caption: 'Reactome functional interaction (FI) networks. Reactome FI networks showed
  interactions of the target mRNAs based on physical or predicated connections. Abbreviations:
  K, KEGG; N, National Cancer Institute; R, Reactome Database. Circles represent nodes,
  and circle size represents node degree (the number of connections one node has).
  Lines with arrows represent physical interactions between nodes. Each node color
  represents an enriched pathway, and multi-colored nodes represent genes enriched
  in multiple pathways. Modules are clusters of nodes with a minimum of seven genes.
  The top five significant pathways in office workers and truck drivers are listed.
  The network clustering algorithm showed six modules in office workers and nine modules
  in truck drivers.'
