caption: The role of Dre2–Tah18 in RNR cofactor biosynthesis. (A) The proposed pathways
  for biosynthesis and maintenance of the FeIII2-Y• cofactor of class Ia RNR. The
  biosynthetic pathway requires delivery of two FeII/β and a reducing equivalent to
  carry out the four-electron reduction of O2 to H2O (); the other three electrons
  come from the two FeII and Tyr residue to form the FeIII2-Y•. The maintenance pathway
  may use the same source of reducing equivalents to convert the inactive FeIII2-Y
  cluster to FeII2-Y, which subsequently forms FeIII2-Y• in the presence of O2 via
  the biosynthesis pathway. (B) A model depicting the central role of the Dre2–Tah18
  complex as a source of reducing equivalent for cluster assembly in RNR and cytosolic
  and nuclear Fe-S cluster-containing proteins. Assembly of FeIII2-Y• in β is facilitated
  by β′, which stabilizes β in a conformation that allows iron binding. Grx3/4 functions
  in intracellular iron trafficking and is required for most iron-requiring pathways,
  including the biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters in the mitochondria (ISC) and cytosol
  (CIA) and FeIII2-Y• assembly in RNR (). Electrons from NADPH are transferred via
  FAD and FMN, the two flavin cofactors in Tah18, to the Fe-S cluster(s) in Dre2,
  which subsequently deliver the electrons to proteins in the CIA pathway and β in
  RNR. Dre2–Tah18 also may provide reducing equivalents to facilitate iron release
  from the [2Fe2S]-GSH2 cluster in the Grx3/Grx4 dimer.
