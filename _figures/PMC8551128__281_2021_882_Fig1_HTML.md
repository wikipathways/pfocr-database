caption: Complement system. The complement system is activated through the classical,
  lectin or alternative pathway. The classical and lectin pathways are initiated by
  the recognition of non-host or damaged cell surfaces. The alternative pathway is
  constitutively and spontaneously activated by the hydrolysis of the C3 to expose
  the thioester domain and form C3(H2O). After factor B (FB) has been activated to
  Bb by factor D (FD), Bb interacts with C3(H2O) to form a C3 convertase (C3(H2O)Bb).
  C3 convertases cleave C3 into the anaphylatoxin C3a and C3b. Through activation
  of C4 and C2 by the C1 complex or lectin pathway PRM-MASP complex, the classical
  and lectin pathways form the C3 convertase C4b2a. C3b deposited on surfaces can
  form additional C3 convertases, C3bBb, after binding activated FB, and this drives
  the C3 amplification loop. Binding of additional C3b molecules to existing C3 convertases
  leads to the formation of C5 convertases (C4b2aC3b, C3bBbC3b) that cleave C5 into
  C5a, a potent anaphylatoxin, and C5b. C5b binds to C6, C7, C8 and C9 and forms the
  membrane attack complex (C5b9), which causes target cell damage. Complement activation
  is tightly controlled by fluid-phase and membrane-bound regulators. Factor H (FH)
  is the major negative regulator of the alternative pathway and controls C3 activation.
  Other soluble regulatory proteins include C1-INH, C4-BP and factor I (FI). Nearly
  all cells express membrane-bound regulators including DAF (CD55), MCP (CD46, not
  present on erythrocytes), CR1 (CD35) and CD59. Properdin (P) stabilises the AP C3
  convertase and is a positive regulator of the complement system. The factor H–related
  proteins 1 (FHR1) and 5 (FHR5) may impair complement activation by competing for
  C3b binding with FH
