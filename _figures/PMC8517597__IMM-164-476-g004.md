caption: Microorganisms promote or inhibit tumorigenesis by affecting different immunocytes
  in the TME. (a) Helicobacter hepaticus activates macrophages. Macrophages inhibit
  the production of IL‐10, which inhibits the development of breast tumours. Some
  commensal microbiota stimulate macrophages to increase c‐Jun phosphorylation in
  CRC cells via the JNK signalling pathway, accelerating CRC cell proliferation. Intestinal
  microbiota dysbacteriosis induces tumour cells to secrete CTSK, thereby activating
  macrophages via mTOR‐dependent pathways. CTSK stimulates macrophages to secrete
  IL‐10 and IL‐17, promoting the invasion and metastasis of CRC cells. Intestinal
  flora dysbacteriosis directly activates macrophages. Macrophages release IL‐6, TNF‐α
  and CXCL10. IL‐6 and TNF‐α accelerate the development of CRC by promoting EMT. CXCL10
  induces the infiltration of T cells in the TME and promotes HCC development. Intestinal
  microbiota dysbacteriosis also induces the production of IL‐25 derived from tuft
  cells. IL‐25 promotes EMT and the migration of HCC cells. (b) Helicobacter hepaticus
  activates neutrophils. Neutrophils increase the levels of NO and TNF‐α, activate
  the NF‐κB signalling pathway and lead to CRC. (c) Lactobacillus reuteri stimulates
  Treg cells. Treg cells inhibit the development of breast tumours by promoting apoptosis.
  (d) Enterotoxic Bacteroides fragilis can also activate Th17 cells through the STAT3
  signalling pathway. Th17 cells release IL‐17 cytokines. IL‐17 promotes STAT3 phosphorylation
  in the colorectal epithelium and tumour cells, thereby promoting tumorigenesis.
  (e) EBTF activates MDSCs through the STAT3 and NF‐κB signalling pathways, directly
  promoting tumorigenesis. Fusobacterium nucleatum increases MDSC populations. MDSCs
  show significant T‐cell suppression activity, leading to tumorigenesis. (f) F. nucleatum
  suppresses T cells indirectly through MDSCs. F. nucleatum also directly inhibits
  T cells. T cells play a role in inhibiting tumour development in the TME. Some strains
  activate T cells through DCs in the TME to inhibit the growth of CRC. (g) DCs secrete
  IFN and TNF to initiate T‐cell activation. Hepcidin can repair the intestinal mucosa.
  (h) Lactobacillus plantarum‐induced NK cells enhance IL‐22 production. IL‐22 provides
  protection of the intestinal epithelial barrier. NK cells promote T‐cell differentiation,
  enhancing the antitumour immune response and delay tumour formation
