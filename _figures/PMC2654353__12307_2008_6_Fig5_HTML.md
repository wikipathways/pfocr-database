caption: 'From nutrients to HIF and from HIF to metabolism. a Two different pathways
  involved in the response to nutrients impact on HIF. First a decrease in the amount
  of glucose can inhibit the activity of FIH and PHD through decreased production
  of the co-substrate 2-oxoglutarate by the Krebs cycle. However, it is not sure that
  it is limiting in vivo. The question as to whether FIH and PHD might be nutritional
  sensors is still open to discussion. The second pathway responds to nutrient depletion
  reflecting a decrease in the ATP/AMP ratio. This nutritional stress activates the
  LKB1/AMPK/TSC1/TSC2 pathway resulting in an inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR). The action of mTOR on HIF is still a subject of debate. Essentially two
  options have been proposed: inhibition of HIF translation and/or inhibition of proteasomal
  degradation. Both converge in the activation of HIF under nutrient depletion conditions.
  b HIF can in turn impact on metabolism and cellular energy due to induction of a
  variety of target genes (here in green). It promotes glucose import via glucose
  transporters (GLUT1, 3) and it increases the rate of glucose consumption by inducing
  expression of glycolytic enzymes. HIF also promotes a shift to anaerobic metabolism
  by: favoring conversion of pyruvate to lactate through enhanced expression of the
  enzyme LDH-A and by increased expression of PDK-1 that counteracts the entrance
  of pyruvate into the Krebs cycle. Finally, through REDD-1, HIF stimulates the TSC1/2
  complex, creating a negative feedback loop on mTOR. In summary, HIF allows cancer
  cells to shift to highly glycolytic anaerobic metabolism and to save energy by downregulating
  translation in a mTOR-dependent fashion'
