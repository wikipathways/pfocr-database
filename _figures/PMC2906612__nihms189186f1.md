caption: '(a) Schematic representation of the purine-thiamine biosynthetic pathways
  in S. enterica. Relevant gene products are noted above the step they catalyze. Not
  all steps are shown. (b) Schematic representation of the mechanisms for PRA formation
  that are distinct from PurF. (i) The non-enzymatic breakdown of PR-anthranilate
  to anthranilate and R5P allows for the non-enzymatic formation of PRA []. (ii) High
  levels of R5P generated when ribose is the sole carbon source allows for non-enzymatic
  formation of PRA []. (iii) R5P can be diverted for non-enzymatic PRA formation when
  PrsA activity is reduced []. (iv) TrpD (bifunctional glutamine amidotransferase/anthranilate
  phosphoribosyltransferase) is necessary and sufficient for PRA formation in the
  absence of YjgF []. (v) The contribution of R5P from the OPP pathway allows weak
  non-enzymatic formation of PRA []. Abbreviations: AIR, aminoimidazole ribotide;
  Cys, cysteine; DXP, 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate; Gln, glutamine; HMP-PP, 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine-pyrophosphate;
  OPP, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway; PRA, phosphoribosylamine; PRPP, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate;
  R5P, ribose-5-phosphate THZ-P, thiazole phosphate; TrpD, bifunctional glutamine
  amidotransferase/anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase; Tyr, tyrosine.'
