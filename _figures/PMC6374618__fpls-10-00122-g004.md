caption: Schematic relationships between the wound-induced signal transduction mechanisms
  for the sesquiterpene biosynthesis and regulation in Aquilaria species for the agarwood
  production. External stimuli trigger the Ca2+signaling pathway and induce the defense
  responses of Aquilaria species via hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) pathway, ethylene (ET)
  signals, Jasmonic acid (JA) signals, and salicylic acid (SA) signals. MeJA treatment
  triggers H2O2 production that can induce programmed cell death (PCD) and increase
  the sesquiterpene synthesis. These signaling molecules activate the transcription
  factors such as MYB, MYC, and WRKY, which will bind to the cis-element on the promoter
  of terpenes biosynthesis genes in the mevalonic acid (MVA) and methylerythritol
  phosphate (MEP) pathways and also the downstream terpene synthase genes (TPs). Direct
  and indirect interactions are shown as solid and dotted lines, respectively. AACT,
