caption: Insulin signalling pathway and its interconnections with the TOR pathway.
  The insulin pathway appears on the left-hand side towards the centre of the image,
  while the TOR pathway appears on the right-hand side. There are many connections
  facilitating cross-talk between the two pathways. Black arrows represent activating
  connections, while red-T-lines represent inhibitions. Green rectangular boxes represent
  proteins, while trapezoid boxes represent processes or pathways. We use the Flybase
  gene symbols as names but also include other commonly used names, in cases where
  these are appear more frequently in the literature. Protein-complexes are represented
  by boxes whose name always begins with “c_”. Transcription factors are shown by
  octagons, but only some examples are shown. The FM-longevity (FOXO-mediated longevity)
  phenotype is represented by a hexagon.
