caption: 'Working model: BMP9/BMP10/ALK1/SMAD4 Signaling drives the regulation of
  direct and indirect pathways in ECs. Binding of BMP9 and BMP10 (BMP9/10) to ALK1
  along with a type II receptor on ECs mediates the activation of ALK1, leading to
  the initiation of direct and indirect pathways. The direct pathway involves the
  SMAD cascade, where activated ALK1 phosphorylates the C-terminus of SMAD1 and SMAD5,
  allowing the recruitment of SMAD4, forming a trimeric SMAD complex. This trimeric
  SMAD complex subsequently translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to the promoters
  of target genes with the assistance of other transcription factors (TFs), thereby
  regulating their expression levels. Among these, BMP9/10 induce the expression of
  ID1, SMAD6 and GADD45β (newly identified target). The indirect pathway involves
  the expression of GADD45β, an activator of MEKK4, which mediates activation of P38/MK2
  signaling axis by these ligands. In this cascade, P38 phosphorylates Eps15-Ser796,
  while P38/MK2 phosphorylates HSP27-Ser78/82, which have been described to play important
  roles in endocytosis and cytoskeleton organization, respectively. BMP9 and BMP10
  also induce the differential phosphorylation of the transcription factor ERG via
  an uncharacterized mechanism. Additionally, P38 activation regulates a subset of
  BMP9/10-induced genes, including SELE, HAS2, and PTGS2. On the other hand, BMP9/10
  downregulates the CDK4/6 pathway leading to inhibition of G1/S transition and cell
  cycle arrest'
