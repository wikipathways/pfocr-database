caption: Ethylene signaling transduction pathway. Model of the ethylene signal transduction.
  Under the mediation of RAN1, which transports copper to ethylene receptors, the
  presence of ethylene causes the loss of phosphorylation (P) of ethylene receptors
  (ETRs) at the membrane level (ER) (Binder et al., 2010); following this, the receptor–CTR1
  complex is inactivated, the delivery of phosphate groups from CTR1 to EIN2 becomes
  incapable, and then EIN2 is cleaved and partly enters the nucleus to activate EIN3/EIL1
  (Wen et al., 2012). Subsequently, EIN3/EIL1 binds to a conserved motif known as
  the EIN3 binding site (EBS), which is present within the promoters of ERF1, and
  this ultimately activates ERF1, which binds to the GCC box in the promoters of many
  ethylene-inducible, ripening-related genes (Fujimoto et al., 2000). Protein degradation
  of EIN3/EIL1 is regulated by EBF1/2 via the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway, and
  EIN5/XRN4 5′–3′ exoribonuclease mediated control of EBF1/2 mRNA levels (Potuschak
  et al., 2003; Olmedo et al., 2006)
