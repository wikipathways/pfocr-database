caption: 'Proposed inositol-requiring protein 1 alpha (IRE1α)-dependent mechanism
  of type I interferon induction upon proteasome impairment. Proteasome impairment
  due to pharmacological inhibition by bortezomib leads to accumulation of ubiquitinated
  proteins in cytosol and abrogated retro-translocation of defective proteins from
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As a consequence, misfolded or damaged proteins accumulate
  in ER causing dissociation of BIP from the ER stressors: IRE1α and protein kinase
  R like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and activation of their downstream pathways.
  Upon induction, PERK oligomerizes and transphosphorylases itself and subsequently
  facilitates phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), what globally
  diminishes protein translation. At the same time, messenger RNA (mRNA) of the transcription
  factor ATF4, which has an inhibitory upstream short open reading frame, is preferentially
  translated when eIF2α is phosphorylated and stimulates the production of C/EBP homologous
  protein 10 (CHOP). CHOP controls induction of proteins involved in autophagy and
  apoptosis but it is also involved in transcriptional regulation of Il-6 expression.
  ER-stress also leads to an induction of IRE1α, which then activates its kinase and
  endoribonuclease domains. The oligomerized protein cleaves a 26-bp long fragment
  in the Xbp1mRNA, which gives rise to a spliced form of XBP1 that translocates into
  the nucleus and activates transcription of its target genes, including Il-6. In
  addition to Xbp1 splicing, IRE1 non-specifically degrades mRNAs in a process named
  regulated IRE1-dependent decay of mRNA (RIDD). The small RNAs generated by the RIDD
  pathway may be recognized by the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I and trigger
  TBK1-IRF3-dependent induction of type I interferons.'
