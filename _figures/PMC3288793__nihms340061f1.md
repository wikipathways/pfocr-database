caption: (a) Under normal cell culture conditions with most mammalian cells type,
  approximately one million (106) molecules of ManNAc analogue must be added to the
  culture media to install one analogue-derived sialoside on the cell surface (b).
  (c) Peracetylation of ManNAc increases the efficiency ∼ 600 fold, such that only
  ∼1,600 molecules of analogue needs to be added to the media to install one surface
  sialoside; this gain in efficiency is presumably due to the enhanced membrane permeability
  of the acylated analog, which was consistent with the even greater efficiency of
  perbutanoylated analogue (e.g., Bu4ManNAc, where ∼500 molecules were required (d)).
  (e) As a final step in increasing efficiency, omission of one ester-linked butyrate
  increased efficiency yet another ∼25% with “1,3,4” analogues being high flux and
  “safe” (e.g., with negligible side effects such as the cytotoxicity seen for per-acylated
  analogues). (f) By contrast, tributanoylated analogues with a “3,4,6” pattern of
  substitution showed enhanced cytotoxicity and the ability to modulate biological
  responses (such as signaling pathways) via “whole molecule” mechanisms (as discussed
  in detail elsewhere (; )). Examples of “R” groups are shown in .
