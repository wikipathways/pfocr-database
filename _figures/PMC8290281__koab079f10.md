caption: Proposed mechanism by which MED8 functions in oxidative stress signaling.
  In the wild-type background, the full-length MED8 associates with NOT2 as well as
  with other unknown “repressors” to suppress defense genes expression and decrease
  tolerance to oxidative stress as a consequence. In the med8 background, the lack
  of the MED8 C-terminal region potentially drives the dissociation from the repressor
  module, the expression of defense genes, and the activation of phytohormone-related
  pathways (for instance, the salicylic acid pathway), thus enhancing the tolerance
  to oxidative stress.
