caption: 'A schema of regulatory mechanisms of endothelial atherosusceptibility discussed
  in the text. Flow disturbance in regions susceptible to atherogenesis places a stress
  load on the biosynthetic capacity of the endothelial endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  that leads to ER stress. Activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) compensates
  to maintain normal cell function but a residual low-level chronic inflammatory state
  persists. Pro-inflammatory molecules are up-regulated (left) and protective molecules
  down-regulated (right). MicroRNAs (miRs) regulated up or down by disturbed flow
  regulate (at least in part) the pro-inflammatory state and are shown in a reciprocal
  transcriptional relationship to their targets. Notes: eNOS is a direct target of
  miR-155, inhibiting eNOS in cytokine-induced inflammation, however, differential
  miR-155 expression has not yet been demonstrated in disturbed flow. miR-143/145
  is increased by flow-induced suppression of KLF2 and is shed in endothelial exosomes
  (Figure D). Not shown in this schema or discussed in the text (because of space
  limitations) are other regulatory mechanisms believed to contribute to endothelial
  pro-inflammatory phenotype through the MAPK pathway that mimics cytokine-induced
  mechanisms and through a low level of protective Nrf2 in atherosusceptible endothelium
  in mice.'
