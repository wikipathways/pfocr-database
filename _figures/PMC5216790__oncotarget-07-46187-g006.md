caption: Simplified schematic view of β-catenin-dependent and -independent signaling
  pathways and the crosstalk between each other. Blue boxes indicate inhibited signaling
  factors and actions, red boxes depict activated signaling factors and actions following
  FZD2 blockade, which were revealed in this study. Wnt3a activates the β-catenin
  pathway by interacting with FZD2 and LRP6. When Wnt5a acts on FZD2 it may compete
  with Wnt3a, thereby inhibiting the β-catenin pathway. However, Wnt5a activates the
  Rac/JNK pathways. Downregulation of FZD2 inhibits the β-catenin pathway and the
  Rac/JNK pathways in NB cells. Blocking the action of Wnt5a on these pathways by
  blocking FZD2 could promote the activation of other β-catenin-independent Wnt pathways.
  Consequently, increased availability of Wnt5a protein may interact with receptor
  ROR1/2 or FZD to activate the PI3K/AKT and PKC pathway, leading to the activation
  of target genes, which normally suppress proliferation and migration. These actions,
  perhaps along with modulation of the activity of other non-canonical pathways (e.g.
  Rac/JNK), mediate the anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effects of Wnts following
  FZD2 blockade. In addition, Wnts acting via FZD and growth factor receptors also
  activate ERK. It is unclear, whether Wnt3a may also activate a β-catenin-independent
  pathway and/or contributes to ERK-activation. Phosphorylation of ERK alone or alteration
  of the p-ERK/p-AKT ratio in turn may regulate proliferation depending on the signaling
  strength thus counteracting or supporting the anti-proliferative effects of FZD2
  blockade.
