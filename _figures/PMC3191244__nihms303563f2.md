caption: 'Schematic representation of the EP4-mediated classical pathway and the EP4-mediated
  anti-inflammatory pathway. Classical pathway: Prostaglandin E2 through EP4 transiently
  increases intracellular cAMP (by activation of adenylyl cyclase). cAMP activates
  protein kinase A (PKA), which subsequently phosphorylates the downstream cAMP response
  element-binding protein (CREB), which binds to certain DNA sequences and increases
  the transcription of downstream genes. Anti-inflammatory pathway: EPRAP binds directly
  to the cytoplasmic tail of EP4 and associates with p105. The EPRAP-p105 complex
  suppresses NFκB and MEK activation by inhibiting p105 phosphorylation and its degradation,
  thereby reducing pro-inflammatory gene expression.'
