caption: The ErbB family includes four receptors with tyrosine kinase activity (ErbB1
  [also known as EGFR], ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4), which form homodimers and/or heterodimers
  upon ligand binding. Autophosphorylation leads to direct activation of the PI3K
  or phospholipase C-γ pathway (not shown). Via adaptor proteins (e.g., Grb2), the
  guanyl nucleotide exchange factor son of sevenless (SOS) allows exchange of GDP
  for GTP on Ras and thus activation of this small GTPase. The scaffolding protein
  SHOC2 accelerates formation of Ras/Raf complexes and leads, in absence of DSG1 and/or
  Erbin, to activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, which inhibits differentiation
  of keratinocytes. In the presence of DSG1, the scaffolding protein Erbin skews the
  fate of keratinocytes toward differentiation by binding SHOC2 and inhibiting formation
  of Ras/Raf complexes. Erbin binds to the cytoplasmic tail of DSG1 but not to the
  intracellular cadherin-like sequence (ICS) that binds plakoglobin (Pg), a protein
  important for desmosome integrity and function. ET from Staphylococcus aureus cleaves
  DSG1 between extracellular domain 3 (EC3) and EC4. Anti-DSG1 autoantibodies (αDSG1
  ab) mediating PF predominantly target N-terminal extracellular domains, causing
  loss of cell-cell adhesion. DP, desmoplakin; EC1–EC4, extracellular domains of DSG1;
  EA, extracellular anchor (also known as EC5); TM, transmembrane domain; IA, intracellular
  anchor; PL, proline-rich linker; RUD, repeat unit domains; TD, terminal domain;
  DSC1, desmocollin-1.
