caption: RhoGEF signaling pathways involved in 3D migration. During mesenchymal movement,
  Rac1 is activated by DOCK3. DOCK3 association with NEDD9 is required to activate
  Rac1, which signals through WAVE2 to drive mesenchymal movement and regulates actin
  assembly through the activation of the Arp2/3 complex. Twist1 and BMI1 negatively
  regulate the expression of the miRNA let-7i, which results in NEDD9 and DOCK3 upregulation
  and Rac1 activation. Activation of Rac1 suppresses amoeboid movement by inhibiting
  actomyosin contractility in a WAVE-dependent manner. Integrin-mediated Src activation
  also inhibits contractility and amoeboid migration by phosphorylating and inhibiting
  ROCK. In contrast, during amoeboid movement contractility activates a Rac1-GAP,
  ARHGAP22, which inhibits Rac and suppresses mesenchymal movement. Amoeboid migration
  is characterized by rounded cells, and high levels of actomyosin contractility downstream
  of RhoA-ROCK. The RhoA-GEFs Net1, GEF-H1, and LARG have all been associated with
  amoeboid migration. A positive feedack loops involving Net1 and LARG reinforces
  the amoeboid signaling pathway. Cdc42 also plays a role in amoeboid migration downstream
  of DOCK10, in a pathway that involves both PAK2 and WASP.
