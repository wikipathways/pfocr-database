caption: 'NO production and function in A. thaliana roots exposed to Cd. (A) NO production.
  Roots of 3-week-old A. thaliana irt1 and wild type (Wt) seedlings grown on plates
  were loaded with the NO-sensitive fluorophore diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2DA;
  20 µM) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 for 2 h. Then, roots were washed three times with
  distilled water to wash off excessive fluorophore and incubated for 7 h in the dark
  with CdSO4 (200 µM). Digital images were captured with a cool charged-coupled device
  camera controlled with AxioVision software (Zeiss). (B) A hypothetical model depicting
  the involvement of NO in the plant response to Cd. Cd enters root cells through
  IRT1 (and most probably through other transporters), a major ferrous iron transporter
  in A. thaliana. The competition between Cd and iron leads to a reduction of the
  intracellular iron content and, consequently, favours NO synthesis. NO production
  might also result from other non-characterized mechanisms. Once produced, NO initiates
  an iron-starvation pathway promoting the upregulation of the expression of the iron
  uptake genes IRT1, FRO2 and FIT. In turn, the corresponding proteins synthesised
  de novo amplify Cd uptake, thus favouring the deleterious effects of Cd including
  the inhibition of root growth. pm: plasma membrane.'
