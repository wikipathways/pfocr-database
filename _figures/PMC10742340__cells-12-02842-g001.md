caption: Molecular signaling pathways associated with Mn neurotoxicity. Mn, as an
  essential trace element, can maintain intracellular stress and promote cellular
  energy metabolism by increasing glucose uptake. Mn can directly bind to IR/IGFR
  to activate the insulin/IGF signaling pathway and regulate its downstream components,
  mainly PI3K/Akt, and cross-regulat the Ras/MAPK, JNK, and p38 signaling pathways
  (Section 2). Activated AKT can promote protein transport and activate autophagy
  by regulating mTOR and regulating cell apoptosis by the FOXO signaling pathway.
  In addition, Mn exposure can activate CREB by activating the Ras/MAPK and p38 signaling
  pathways, thereby increasing BDNF to inhibit apoptosis. However, prolonged activation
  of the above pathways may still fail to overcome the cytotoxic effects of Mn and
  may even elicit adverse downstream events to promote inflammation and cell apoptosis.
  Mn exposure can overactivate the cCAS-STING, NFκB, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways,
  as well as inhibit the SIRT signaling pathway, leading to an inflammatory response,
  which activates NLRP3-CASP1 inflammasome (Section 3). Downregulated SIRT1 can promote
  mitochondrial damage and apoptosis by regulating FOXO and GADD34 and further activate
  the NFκB and JAK/STAT signaling pathways to aggravate inflammation. Moreover, released
  inflammatory factors, such as iNOS, can activate autophagy through the AMPK and
  JNK signaling pathways. Mn also stimulates the PINK-1/Parkin protein by promoting
  the nuclear retention of FOXO3, inducing mitophagy (Section 4)
