caption: The apoptotic pathway in HFSCs. There are two apoptotic pathways, namely,
  the intrinsic pathway initiated by intracellular stresses (e.g., ROS and DNA damage)
  and the extrinsic pathway triggered by extracellular cues. a Intrinsic stressors
  upregulate the expression/activation of proapoptotic BCL-2 family members and suppress
  anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, resulting in MOMP. Intrinsic stressors can
  also induce the overexpression of proapoptotic proteins (e.g., NOXA (proapoptotic
  BH3-only protein, also known as PMAIP1 [phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced
  protein 1]), p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), and apoptosis regulator
  Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)) in the p53-based apoptotic pathway, which is induced
  by the activation and stabilization of p53 through phosphorylation leading to its
  nuclear translocation, DNA binding and transcriptional initiation. Once MOMP is
  induced, cyt-c is released from the mitochondrial intermembrane and associates with
  caspase-9 and Apaf-1 to form apoptosomes, which can activate caspase-3 or caspase-7,
  causing apoptosis. b The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is triggered by the combination
  of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family members and specific TNF family
  ligands, leading to a caspase response. Once bound, TNFR/TNF undergoes a conformational
  change resulting in the recruitment of Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and subsequently
  pro-caspases-8 to form the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC). Finally, activated
  and cleaved caspase-3 leads to the occurrence of apoptosis, with characteristic
  changes such as phosphatidylserine plasma membrane exposure, DNA fragmentation,
  and the formation of apoptotic bodies. Remarkably, the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways
  are connected via the Bid protein. The T-shaped lines indicate inhibitory interactions
  involved in this pathway, and the solid arrows indicate activating interactions
