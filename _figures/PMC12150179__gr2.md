caption: Influence of ROS induced by microplastics on macrophage metabolism, function,
  and polarization. When macrophages ingest microplastics (MPs), the subsequent generation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggers a spectrum of cell death modalities, encompassing
  apoptosis, necrosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and autophagic cell death. For example,
  MPs stimulate ROS production, leading to the upregulation of Bax, subsequently activates
  caspase 9 and caspase 3, thereby intensifying the apoptotic cascade. Additionally,
  MPs elevate mitochondrial ROS levels, which in turn activate necrosomes, initiating
  necrotic cell death. Moreover, MPs facilitate cell ferroptosis by augmenting ROS
  accumulation and lipid peroxidation. Simultaneously, NLRP3 becomes activated and
  engages with ASC, resulting in the proteolytic maturation of caspase-1. This matured
  caspase-1 then converts pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, IL-1 β
  and IL-18, respectively, thereby inducing pyroptosis. Furthermore, MP-induced ROS
  contribute to the formation of protein misfolding aggregates, inducing endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress. ROS also phosphorylates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
  and inhibits the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, both actions
  reinforcing autophagic cell death. Notably, MP-triggered ROS initiates persistent
  mitophagy, causing lysosomal damage that liberates calcium ions. These calcium ions
  promote histone citrullination, thereby further inducing chromatin decondensation.
  Additionally, the activation of NF-κB signaling enhances the production of inflammatory
  cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8, amplifying the inflammatory response
  and exacerbating cellular injury and demise. The interaction between nitric oxide
  (NO) and ROS further intensifies oxidative stress, disrupting iron homeostasis and
  promoting ferroptosis. Furthermore, ROS promotes the polarization of macrophages
  towards the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, thereby augmenting the inflammatory response
  and cell death
