caption: 'MiRnome circulating in plasma after injury is predicted to be controlled
  by miRNA processing enzymes and to affect different signalling pathways. Exemplificative
  diagram of a network of interaction of miRNAs detected in plasma at day 14 post-injury
  relative to day 3 (3d, 14d: 4 animals per group), with the canonical signalling
  pathways predicted to affect their expression (e.g., Dicer), and that they were
  predicted to regulate (e.g., Smad2/3) by Ingenuity pathway analysis.'
