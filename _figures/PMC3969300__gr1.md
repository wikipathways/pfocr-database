caption: Establishment of left/right (LR) asymmetry during development. (A) Cross-section
  of the developing embryo during gastrulation viewed from the posterior. The node
  is a pit that forms transiently at the midline during gastrulation and contains
  two types of primary cilia (blue lines). Posteriorly angled clockwise rotating cilia
  create a leftward flow which is detected by mechanosensory cilia , and transduced
  to an increase of intracellular calcium ions in the left side triggering asymmetrical
  expression of genes such as NODAL . (B) Zoomed in representation of NODAL signaling
  at the surface of a cell on the left side of both the node and lateral plate mesoderm.
  Cryptic family protein 1B (CFC1B) is tethered to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
  (GPI; a glycolipid) anchor , and it recruits NODAL proprotein (pre-NODAL), proprotein
  convertase subtilisin/kexin type 6 (PCSK6), and activin type I receptors (ACVR1B/ACVR1C)
  . PCSK6 then cleaves pre-NODAL into an active form, and a type II activin receptor
  (ACVR2B) forms a complex with the NODAL ligand, type I receptors, and CFC1B . Type
  I, type II receptors, and NODAL exist as homodimers and the binding of the NODAL
  ligand causes the receptors to combine into a heterotetrameric complex (for simplicity
  proteins are shown as monomers) . Phosphorylation of type I receptors by ACVR2B
  then transmits the NODAL signal via a signal transduction pathway that activates
  expression of NODAL target genes, specifying that the cell is on the left side of
  the embryo . Variants in both PCSK6 and ACVR2B have been associated with relative
  hand skill in individuals with dyslexia .
