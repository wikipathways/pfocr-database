caption: 'ATR or CHK1 inhibition enhances chemosensitivity in acute myeloid leukemia.
  Cancer cells are characterized by a range of molecular defects (oncogene expression)
  leading to hyperproliferative capacities associated with increase in replicative
  stress resulting from fork stalling, collapse, and genomic instability. Beside this,
  DNA antimetabolite drugs extensively used in clinical therapies are also strong
  replicative stress inducers. (A) Cancer cells, including AML cells, have been selected
  or have adapted to replication stress through increased expression and activation
  of key mediators of DNA replicative stress response: Ataxia Telangiectasia-Mutated
  and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), essential for the
  maintenance of cell viability by controlling DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint,
  DNA replication, apoptotic process, and mitotic entry. (B) Alternatives therapies
  could be developed in AML to bypass the selected advantage of cancer cells by inhibiting
  the activity of these kinases. Targeting the replicative stress response could render
  cells more vulnerable to conventional therapy as it decreases the strength of cell
  cycle checkpoints and perturbs DNA replication process. Thus cells are more prone
  to enter into mitosis with massive DNA damage, under-replicated DNA and undergo
  a process called “mitotic catastrophy” that leads to apoptosis.'
