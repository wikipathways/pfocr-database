caption: 'Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) apoptosis in an acute and chronic state
  of intestinal diseases. Apoptosis is a crucial factor for preserving gut homeostasis.
  The apoptotic pathway is mediated by the stimulation of TNFR1 and FAS receptor with
  receptive ligands TNF and FASL or TRAIL that leading to the activation of NFκB,
  which turns in the regulation of cell survival, apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory
  genes expression. A: During the acute intestinal disease state, there is an increase
  in the activation of NFκB1 survival pathways and it’s mediated pro-inflammatory
  mediators, which plays a host defensive mechanism in regulating the caspase activity
  and apoptotic program to remove infected and damaged IECs. B: In meanwhile, during
  the chronic intestinal disease state, there is an increase in the activation of
  NFκB2 pro-apoptotic pathways and Caspase-3, -8 and -9 that inhibit the epithelial
  survival NF-kB1 pathways, provoke strikingly rapid epithelial apoptosis, reduce
  epithelial proliferation and result in the pathological IECs shedding. This event
  results in increased intestinal barrier dysfunction and intestine permeability,
