caption: Cross-talk of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway with the RTK family receptors and
  its role in the induction of EMT. The Wnt/β-catenin and EGFR signaling pathways,
  on the binding of specific ligands, can activate each other. The binding of Wnt
  ligands with FZD receptors transactivates EGFR signaling by MMP-mediated release
  of EGF ligands. In turn, EGFR signaling transactivates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  through the PI3K/Akt and Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk signaling cascades. Akt can induce β-catenin
  by triggering its nuclear translocation or blocking GSK-3β activities. PTEN, which
  acts as a tumor suppressor and inhibits the activation of Akt, also negatively regulates
  β-catenin nuclear translocation. In addition, the aberrant activation of the EGFR
  pathway leads to an increase in free β-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm through
  inducing dissociation from α-catenin. Several cell signaling pathways induce the
  expression of EMT-inducing transcription factors such as ZEB, SNAIL, and TWIST to
  push the tumor cells toward proliferation and metastasis. Moreover, the binding
  of several growth factors and cytokines to their receptors acts to induce the phosphorylation
  and activation of JAKs and activator of transcription proteins (STATs); STAT3/5
  dimers stimulate the transcription of genes encoding EMT transcription factors,
  anti-apoptotic and survival proteins. In addition, in response to stimuli, such
  as TNF-α, the IKK complex is activated, resulting in phosphorylation of IKB and
  its degradation by the proteasome, and allowing the translocation of NF-κB into
  the nucleus
