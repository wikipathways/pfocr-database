caption: The use of saikosaponins and implications for age-related diseases. Several
  types of saikosaponins, such as saikosaponin a (SSa), saikosaponin b (SSb), saikosaponin
  c (SSc), and saikosaponin d (SSd), could be used to treat age-related diseases.
  SSa, SSb, and SSd may be used for the treatment of cancer as single anticancer or
  adjuvant agents. Inhibitory actions of saikosaponins against P-glycoprotein-mediated
  multidrug resistance are implicated in the ability of saikosaponins to sensitize
  cancer cells to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. SSc has dual effects on human Alzheimer's
  disease by targeting both tau and amyloid beta. SSa may slow or reverse the progression
  of atherosclerosis by inhibiting oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced activation
  of p38 and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway
  and assembly of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome. SSa exerts
  antiobesity activity by acting as a 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptor agonist or by
  suppressing extracellular signal-regulated kinase/nuclear factor- (NF-) κB pathway-induced
  inflammation. SSd provides protection against diabetic nephropathy through the upregulation
  of Sirt3 followed by mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes like isocitrate dehydrogenase
  2 and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase. SSa, SSc, and SSd may be used for
  the treatment of inflammatory disorders, such as asthma, arthritis, and sepsis,
  by downregulating the NF-κB signaling pathway or inhibiting vascular injury/apoptosis.
  Lastly, SSa and SSd protect the liver against age-associated injury and fibrosis
  by suppressing cytokines, including platelet-derived growth factor and transforming
  growth factor-β1.
