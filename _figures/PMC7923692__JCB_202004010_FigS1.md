caption: RPTOR BioID2 reveals spatial association between mTORC1 and FAs. (A) Immunostaining
  of RPTOR-BioID2-expressing U2OS cells treated with 50 µM biotin overnight. Cells
  were stained for biotin and myc-tagged RPTR. Scale bars, 20 µm (insets, 10 µm).
  Nuclei were visualized with DAPI. (B) Representative immunoblots of streptavidin
  pull-downs following 50 µM biotin incubation overnight (left) and immunoprecipitation
  (IP) with anti-mTOR antibody (right). WCL, whole-cell lysate. (C) Unsupervised analysis
  of RPTOR BioID samples (BioID2-based proximity labeling) quantified by MS. Hierarchical
  cluster analysis of Spearman rank correlation coefficients of pairwise comparisons
  for all samples analyzed by MS (P < 2 × 10−127, Spearman’s test; left). Principal-component
  analysis of samples analyzed by MS (right). The first two principal components account
  for 88.6% of the total variance of the dataset. (D) Enrichment of noncontaminant
  proteins specifically enriched in RPTOR BioID samples (n = 4 independent experiments;
  P < 0.01, two-sided Welch’s t test with permutation-based FDR correction, artificial
  within groups variance = 2). Proteins enriched by at least 256-fold or with P <
  10−6 (two-sided Welch’s t test) are labeled; enriched TOR signaling components (Gene
  Ontology accession 0031929) are labeled in bold. Putative contaminant proteins are
  indicated by gray crosses. (E) Interaction network analysis of TOR signaling components

  correction; F) and pathways enriched with P < 0.0001 (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test with
  FDR correction; G) are shown. (H) Interaction network analysis of RPTOR-proximal
  adhesome components identified by RPTOR BioID. (I) Diagrammatic representation of
