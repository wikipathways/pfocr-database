caption: A. The general domain structure of TCF/LEF proteins includes a highly variable
  Context Regulatory Domain (CRD) and the well-conserved N-terminal β-catenin–binding
  (β-cat) and High Mobility Group (“HMG”) DNA-binding domains. N-terminal truncated
  forms of TCF/LEFs (left) are naturally occurring and commonly referred to as dominant
  negatives (e.g., dnTCF1, dnLEF1, etc.) because they block gene regulation by displacing
  full-length proteins from target genes (right). In the Grumolato study, dnTCF1 and
  dnLEF1 functioned perfectly well to activate a Wnt reporter gene. B. A simplified
  representation of ATF2 recruitment by TCF1 to activate transcription in a β-catenin–independent
  manner (referred to as a β-catenin–independent Wnt signaling pathway in Grumolato
  et al. ). In some contexts, displacement of weaker TCF activators such as TCF4 might
  also contribute to activation. C. β-catenin–dependent Wnt signaling requires the
  recruitment of β-catenin by TCF/LEFs to a Wnt Response Element (WRE) for transcriptional
  activation of target genes. D. A distal enhancer for the T-Cell Receptor alpha chain
  gene, identified as one of the very first targets for TCF/LEF binding (see references
  in text), contains closely juxtaposed binding sites for ATF/CREB proteins (consensus
  binding sequence shown below), LEF/TCFs, and ETS proteins. E. ChIP-seq studies of
  TCF and β-catenin genome-wide occupancy identify significant colocalization of binding
  motifs for AP1 and ETS transcription factors (see text for references). Consensus
  sequences for AP1 and ATF/CREB sites differ by a single nucleotide (see panel D
  for comparison), and ATF proteins are known to bind AP1 sites. Colocalized motifs
  suggest there is potential for interaction and cooperative crosstalk between β-catenin–bound
  TCF/LEFs, and ATF/CREB and ETS proteins.
