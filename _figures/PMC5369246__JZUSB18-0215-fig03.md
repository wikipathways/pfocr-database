caption: STAT-5-dependent activation of ATM and ATR pathways, required for HPV genome
  amplificationHigh-risk HPV activates STAT-5 to mediate TopBP1 transcriptionally
  to promote ATR pathway. Meanwhile, STAT-5 does not directly regulate Tip60; instead,
  it partially work through PPARg to manipulate Tip60 activation which consequently
  facilitates ATM activation. HPV E7 oncogene is responsible for STAT-5 activation
  as well as interaction with other factors such as Rb, ATM, NBS1, HDAC, and p21.
  E6 gene may collaborate with other viral proteins to act on Tip60 in addition to
  its role in p53 degradation. E2 is capable of interacting with TopBP1 to mediate
  HPV initial replication
