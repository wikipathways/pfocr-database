caption: Role of E3 ubiquitin ligases and SOCS3 in RTK signaling pathway in glioblastoma
  multiforme. RTK is a transmembrane receptor containing extracellular, transmembrane
  and intracellular parts. Extracellular domains interact with the extracellular environment,
  allowing expressed cells to respond and adapt to extracellular signals. Upon binding
  to their homologous ligands, RTKs undergo autophosphorylation, leading to downstream
  signaling. The role of RTK signaling in the PI3K/Akt pathway is shown in the figure,
  as well as its association with SOCS3. SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling; RTK,
  receptor tyrosine kinase; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase; PHLPP1, pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase;
  CK1, casein kinase 1.
