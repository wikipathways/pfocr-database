caption: A model showing the possible pathways of neuropeptide Y-induced neuroprotective
  effects in Alzheimer's disease. Neuropeptide Y inhibits Aβ-induced lipid peroxidation
  and prevents intracellular oxidative stress. Activation of PI3K-XBP1 pathway may
  also be involved in neuropeptide Y-induced neuroprotection against endoplasmic reticulum
  stress. Moreover, both NGF and BDNF are involved in neuropeptide Y-induced neuroprotective
  effects. In addition, NEP cleaves neuropeptide Y into C-terminal fragments, which
  protect against the neurodegenerative pathology in Alzheimer's disease. NPY, neuropeptide
  Y; NPYR, neuropeptide Y receptors; NEP, neutral endopeptidase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; NGF, nerve growth factor. The internal
  and external circles represent the inner and outer leaflets of the cellular membrane.
