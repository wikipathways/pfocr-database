caption: A current model of regulating the BRI1 abundance on the plasma membrane (PM).
  Newly synthesized BRI1 is translocated through the Sec61 translocon from the ER
  (endoplasmic reticulum)-associated ribosomes into the ER where it undergoes chaperone-assisted
  protein folding. Correctly folded BRI1 is exported into the Golgi to continue its
  secretory journey through the TGN (trans-Golgi network)/EE (early endosome) to be
  targeted on the PM (1), whereas the incorrectly/misfolded BRI1, such as its mutant
  variants bri1-5 and bri1-9, are retained in the ER by ERQC (ER quality control)
  for refolding and degradation via ERAD (ER-associated degradation) that involves
  retrotranslocation and cytosolic proteasome. The PM-localized BRI1 or BRI1/BAK1
  heterodimer is presumably ubiquitinated by the PUB12/13 (plant U-box protein12/13)
  E3 ligases and undergoes constitutive CME (clathrin-mediated endocytosis)-mediated
  internalization (2) or ligand-induced CIE (clathrin-independent endocytosis)-mediated
  internalization (3). The endocytosed BRI1 at the TGN/EE could be packaged into ILVs
  (intraluminal vesicles) and delivered to the vacuole for degradation via ESCRT (endosomal
  sorting complex required for transport)-mediated biogenesis of MVBs (multivesicular
  bodies) and eventual MVB-vacuole fusion (4). Alternatively, the TGN/EE-localized
  BRI1 can be recycled back to the PM via retromer-mediated cargo selection, microtubule-assisted
  vesicle trafficking, and exocyst/SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment
  protein receptor)-involved exocytosis (5). The circled numbers indicate different
  secretion/trafficking routes. SNX1 (sorting nexin1) is one of the core retromer
  subunits, CLASP (cytoplasmic linker-associated protein) is a microtubule-associated
  protein, and ALIX (the Arabidopsis homolog of apoptosis-linked gene 2-interacting
  protein X) is a cytosolic ESCRT-associated protein.
