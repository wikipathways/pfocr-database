caption: Effect of the MAPK signaling pathway on MIRI. The MAPK signaling pathway
  has been demonstrated to exacerbate MIRI through a range of pathophysiological mechanisms,
  the most common of which include the induction of ferroptosis and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.
  Furthermore, the MAPK signaling pathway can directly or indirectly contribute to
  inflammatory responses resulting in cardiomyocyte injury. Activation of the MAPK
  signaling pathway also leads to upregulation of Mff, which in turn disrupts mitochondrial
  energetic disturbances and ultimately results in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion
  injury. Collectively, these pathophysiological mechanisms have the potential to
  exacerbate MIRI to a variable extent
