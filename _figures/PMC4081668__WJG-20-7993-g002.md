caption: 'Nuclear export of hepatitis B virus mRNAs. (i) Nuclear export for aberrant
  spliced hepatitis B virus (HBV) transcripts. In this pathway, HBV post-transcriptional
  regulatory element (PRE) enhances over-splicing of the pgRNA and perhaps also the
  S transcripts. The spliced RNAs are then possibly exported out via a TAP pathway.
  These spliced HBV transcripts are translated into apparently non-functional proteins
  such as HBSP; (ii) Nuclear export of major HBV unspliced and intronless transcripts
  e.g. the preS/S and X transcripts. For this pathway, HBV PRE plays roles in inhibiting
  splicing as well as mediating the nuclear export of the unspliced transcripts. The
  exact mechanism of this nuclear export pathway is unknown, but may involve binding
  of cellular proteins (PTB, GAPDH, hLa) near to conserved secondary structures of
  HBV PRE; and (iii) TAP dependent NES pathway of the pgRNA transcript. The core protein
  binds the pgRNA facilitating its export though the TAP/NFX1 pathway. SRE-1: Splicing
  regulatory element-1; NES: Nuclear export signals.'
