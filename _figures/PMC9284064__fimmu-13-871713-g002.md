caption: '(A) The regulation mechanism of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Under normal
  circumstances the intestinal mucosal barrier depends on the normal zonulin pathway,
  intestinal microbiome and Toll-like receptors signal pathway. TLRs can regulate
  the differentiation, proliferation and maturation of intestinal epithelial cells,
  zonulin reversibly regulates tight junctions via zonulin pathway and the intestinal
  microbiome regulates the normal microecological environment, which interacts with
  each other to guarantee the normal intestinal mucosal barrier function. (B) Under
  abnormal conditions, bacterial antigens and disordered intestinal microbiome make
  the TLR signaling pathway abnormal, and the latter destroys the intestinal epithelial
  cells. At the same time, it can also increase the production of zonulin to promote
  the zonulin pathway and lead to the destruction of tight junctions ultimately. Bacterial
  antigens and intestinal microbiome enter into the intestinal lamina propria through
  the intestinal epithelial cells to interact with immune cells leading to the production
  of inflammatory factors and abnormal antibodies, which enter the blood circulation
  and finally enter the body tissues to promote the development of diseases. EGFR:
  epidermal growth factor receptor; PAR2: protease-activated receptor 2.'
