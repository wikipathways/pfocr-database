caption: Proposed simplified signaling mechanism for Exendin-4-induced steatosis improvement.
  Exendin-4 action is mediated by directly binding to the Glucagon-Like Peptide-1
  Receptor (GLP-1R) on the plasma membrane. The activation of the GLP-1R, which is
  coupled positively to the adenylyl cyclase (AC) system, stimulates AC and increases
  intracellular cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). The PKA phosphorylates
  and activates β-catenin, which is subsequently translocated to the nucleus. Nuclear
  β-catenin then binds to T-cell factor (Tcf) to form a bipartite transcription factor
  and facilitates the positive or negative modulation of the Tcf-dependent genes,
  leading, among other effects, to reduced expression of the transcription factor
  Forkhead Box A1 (FOXA1). The lower expression of FOXA1, one of the most effective
  activators of the human Fatty Acid Binding Protein 1 (FABP1), results in downregulation
  of FABP1, which leads to reduced uptake and transport of fatty acids and ultimately
  decreased steatosis.
