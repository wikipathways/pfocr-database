caption: 'The sites of activity of genes containing SNPs observed to be associated
  in our study in the pathway where Cit contributes to vascular flexibility and expandability
  (NO signaling pathway) are indicated. Genes with observed associations (SNPs that
  were associated in parentheses) are indicated in green letters, and symptoms of
  vascular aging that were observed to be associated with that gene (SNP) are indicated
  near the gene name in red letters. Arg conversion to NO is the first step in the
  NO signaling pathway, and it is critical to increase the activity of NOS and inhibit
  the activity of protein Arg methyltransferase inhibitor (PRMT) in increasing NO
  production. In addition, downstream NO signaling must lead to sGC-cGMP-mediated
  regulation of intracellular Ca2 + concentrations via PKG or protein kinase A (PKA)
  to correctly contribute to vascular flexibility and expandability. PDE, ADCY, and
  KCNMB play an important role in these pathways. NOS: NO synthase, sGC-cGMP: soluble
  guanylate cyclase –cyclic guanosine monophosphate, PKG: cGMP-dependent protein kinase,
  PDE: Phosphodiesterase, ADCY: Adenylyl cyclases'
