caption: We then examined the Pd-catalyzed oxidative kinetic resolution of hydroxyester
  (±)-15. Under optimized reaction conditions, the racemic alcohol could be resolved
  to highly enantioenriched hydroxyester (−)-15 with good selectivity (). Though the
  overall mass recovery of (−)-15 and (+)-16 was not ideal, significant quantities
  of enantioenriched alcohol (−)-15 could be accessed from this pathway.
