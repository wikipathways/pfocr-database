caption: Summary of major GPCR trafficking-signaling relationships in the endocytic
  pathway. Agonist-induced activation of the receptor initiates signaling by G protein
  activation from the plasma membrane. This is followed by agonist-selective phosphorylation
  by sequential GRK-catalyzed reactions that encode an agonist-selective multiphosphorylation
  pattern in the receptor tail, which determines whether receptors engage the β-arrestin
  N-lobe sufficiently strongly to drive receptor clustering in clathrin-coated pits
  via additional interactions of β-arrestin with clathrin heavy chain, AP-2 (adaptor
  protein 2), and PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ) at the coated pit.
  This is followed by endocytic scission and packaging of receptors into endocytic
  vesicles, which then fuse with early endosomes. Receptors are dephosphorylated in
  endosomes and during endocytic transit, enabling receptors to initiate a second
  wave of signaling by G protein activation from endosomes. GPCRs are sorted in the
  limiting membrane by ESCRT, which mediates ubiquitin (Ub)-directed packaging of
  receptors into vesicles within the endosome lumen; this prevents receptors from
  recycling and assures their subsequent receptor delivery to lysosomes for proteolytic
  downregulation. Alternatively, receptors can engage ASRT by a PDZ motif present
  in the receptor tail, which drives receptor exit from endosomes through actin-dependent
  formation of endosome-derived carrier vesicles, which can fuse with the plasma membrane
  or deliver receptors to intermediate recycling endosomes or to Golgi-associated
  membranes (retrograde route), supporting indirect receptor recycling pathways involving
  additional sorting. Indicated as orange cones are subcellular locations of known
  G protein–dependent signal initiation based on present knowledge of the B2AR and
  opioid receptors. Other GPCRs, such as the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor
  and β1-adrenergic receptor, are not presently known to signal from endosomes and,
  instead, use Golgi-associated membranes as a second site of internal signaling in
  addition to the plasma membrane (not indicated). All figures included in this review
  were generated using BioRender (biorender.com). ILV, intralumenal vesicle; Pi, inorganic
  phosphate.
