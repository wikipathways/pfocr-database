caption: 'rTSMS regulates functional protein synthesis and pathways. (A) Workflow
  for quantitative proteomics and data analyses of spinal cord tissue between stimulated
  (rTSMS treated) and control (SCI) mice. (B) Modulation of biological functions involved
  in neural development and cell death from differentially regulated proteins in stimulated
  mice compared to controls. Analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA, Qiagen). Statistical significance is proposed through the calculation of p
  values and z-scores. (C) Functional regulatory effects of upregulated (red) or downregulated
  (green) proteins belonging to the different pathways associated to neural development
  and cell death (red arrows: activation; green arrows: inhibition; orange nut: gain
  of biological function; green nut: decrease of biological function)'
