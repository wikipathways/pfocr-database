caption: Disease-modifying therapies can modulate the intestinal barrier. Different
  disease-modifying therapies in clinical use may beneficially modulate intestinal
  barrier function through a variety of mechanisms. (1) Oral disease-modifying therapies
  have antimicrobial properties, while minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic. Dimethyl
  fumarate acts as a Michael acceptor and can deplete bacterial nucleophilic thiols.
  (2) Glatiramer acetate has been shown to increase syndecan, the most abundant heparan
  sulphate proteoglycan in the gastrointestinal tract. (3) Fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate
  and minocycline increase tight junction expression. Dimethyl fumarate increases
  zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) in a heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) dependent pathway, while S1P
  signalling increases E-cadherin (E-CN). (4) Most disease-modifying therapies modulate
  lymphocyte (LYM) populations and functions in non-neurological tissues, such as
  in the lamina propria. Whether any of these effects have a mechanistic relevance
  for their therapeutic action is unknown.
