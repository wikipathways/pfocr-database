caption: Activation of the UPR pathway in tumor cells. Cancer cells are challenged
  by intrinsic (oncogene activation) or extrinsic stresses (hypoxia, nutrient and
  oxygen deprivation, acidosis). These conditions lead to an accumulation of misfolded
  protein in the ER lumen, a condition referred to as <ER stress>. To overcome such
  challenges, cancer cells set up adaptive mechanisms including the pro-survival UPR
  pathway. Three UPR transducers were released from GRP78 to allow their dimerization/oligomerization
  or export to the Golgi. PERK kinase phosphorylates and activates the transcription
  factor NRF2 and phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2α, leading
  to a global suppression of protein synthesis. Paradoxically, this phosphorylation
  activates the transcription factor ATF4. IRE1α activation, upon oligomerization
  and trans-autophosphorylation, cleaves the XBP1 mRNA in presence of the t-RNA ligase
  RTCB to give an unconventional spliced form named XBP1s. XBP1s protein acts as an
  active transcription factor. IRE1α also promotes JNK activation and controls RNA
  degradation of various mRNA through its RIDD (Regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay) function.
  ATF6α translocates to the Golgi, where its cytosolic domain is released upon cleavage
  by S1P and S2P proteases, to generate an active transcription factor. The three
  transcription factors coordinate the expression of genes coding for ER chaperones,
  lipid synthesis, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), autophagy
  machinery, antioxidant response, trafficking, in order to maintain ER homeostasis
  and control the survival/cell death balance. It is worth noting that GRP78 is also
  found on the cell surface and is secreted into the circulation favoring interactions
  with other cells and components of the tumor microenvironment. This opens up new
  avenues on the role and function of the UPR.
