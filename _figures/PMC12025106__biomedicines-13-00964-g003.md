caption: 'The role of the activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR/c-MYC pathway in metabolic reprogramming
  to dietary methionine sources. mTORC1 is an anabolic enzyme activated by amino acid
  metabolism and promotes the oncogenic expression of c-MYC to enhance metabolic reprogramming
  and drive tumorigenesis. Altered gut microbiota with relative abundance of LB over
  HP is a phenomenon in GIM and GC, in which the interaction between LB and nutrients
  is associated with the upregulation of amino acid biosynthesis, such as methionine.
  Growth factors such as insulin could induce the tyrosine receptor kinase-dependent
  activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway to promote the overexpression
  of the c-MYC oncogene in tumor cells, including in GIM. Overexpression of c-MYC
  promotes metabolic rewiring of exogenous methionine through two mechanisms: (1)
  activating LAT1 transporters and (2) promoting the transcription of MAT2A through
  binding to intron 1 to increase MAT2A expression. MAT2A catalyzes the conversion
  of exogenous methionine to SAM, a universal methyl donor for the methylation of
  tumor suppressor genes, and promotes cellular proliferation. The CDX2 gene has a
  tumor-suppressor role and is downregulated with the activation of mTORC1 and the
  suppression of PTEN. The CDX2 gene is downregulated in colonic-type epithelium via
  promoter region hypermethylation, which increases with reduced intake of dietary
  folate sources, suggesting altered methionine metabolism. mTORC11/2: mammalian rapamycin
  complex-1 or 2 target; Raptor: regulatory-associated protein of mTOR; SAMTOR: S-Adenosylmethionine-sensing
