caption: A Aa After TTFields treatment, Beclin1 increases the binding of Atg14L and
  Vps34(the positively regulated autophagosome) and decreases Bcl-2(the negatively
  regulated autophagosome), leading to glioma cells and tumor stem cell autophagy.
  Meanwhile, activation of the AKT2/mTOR/p70S6K axis also leads to autophagy. A Ab
  TTFields up-regulates caspase3, caspase7 or increases BAX, down-regulates BCL-2
  expression, and leads to apoptosis. A Ac TTFields destroys the nuclear membrane,
  generates micronuclei and double strand breaks, activate the cGAS-Sting signaling
  pathway to increase the expression of proinflammatory factors and type I interferon,
  and through the AIM2-Caspase1 inflammasome Cleavage of GSDMD and release of LDH
  leads to pyroptosis and immune activation ultimately. A Ad TTFields inhibits IκBα
  phosphorylation and NF-κB p65 translocation, the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, and
  ultimately inhibits cell invasion, metastasis, and EMT processes. A Ae TTFields
  promotes phosphorylation of GEF-H1, which further activates RhoA, ultimately leading
  to focal adhesions and cytoskeleton reorganization. A Af TTFields causes Endoplasmic
  Reticulum stress and releases ATP, which activates AMPK and ULK, leading to resistance
  to TTFields. A Ag TTFields attenuates tube formation and angiogenesis by down-regulating
  the expression of HIF1α and VEGF. A Ah Upregulation of BRCA1 and GADD45 results
  in G2/M phase arrest. B Breast cancer. Septins are abnormally distributed. C Non-small
  cell lung cancer. TTFields lead to R loop formation and replication stress. D MPM.
  Elevated TP53, P21, and P27 lead to G1 phase blockade.
