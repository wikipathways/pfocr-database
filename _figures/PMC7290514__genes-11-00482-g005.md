caption: Different stages of PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) biogenesis and function.
  Mature piRNAs are derived from precursor RNAs following a post-transcriptional processing
  through two alternative mechanisms. The primary maturation pathway involves cleavage
  of long, single-stranded piRNA clusters and the binding with PIWI proteins in the
  cytoplasm. The second mechanism is a self-amplifying loop (termed “ping-pong” cycle),
  in which an antisense piRNA binds PIWI proteins and triggers production of a sense
  piRNA that binds to Protein argonaute-3 (Ago 3). Nuclear PIWI/piRNA complexes regulate
  gene and transposon expression by epigenetic modifications. Once the piRNAs are
  loaded onto PIWI, the activity and/or expression of DNA methyltransferases (Hen
  1) is increased, promoting methylation of promoter regions, preventing transcription
  factor binding, and interacting with histone methyltransferase. Cytoplasmic mature
  piRNA promotes mRNA decay by interacting with deadenylation complex, inhibits translation
  by directly binding with translation factors, and modulates cellular signaling by
  directly regulating the post-translational modifications.
