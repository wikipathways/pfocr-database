caption: Proposed working model for the role of Rho GTPases in S1P‐induced GEnC activation
  in the presence of MPO‐ANCA‐positive IgG. Under pathophysiological concentration
  of S1P in active AAV patients, the activation of S1PR2‐5 and their downstream RhoA
  signalling pathway dominates the S1P‐induced MPO‐ANCA‐positive IgG‐mediated endothelial
  activation, whereas the activation of S1PR1 and Rac1 signalling pathway exerts opposite
  effect during this process. The imbalance between different S1PRs and Rho GTPases
  activation might participate in the development of AAV. S1P, sphingosine‐1‐phosphate;
  S1PR, sphingosine‐1‐phosphate receptor; ICAM‐1, intercellular cell adhesion molecule‐1;
  VCAM‐1, vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1; ZO‐1, zonula occluden‐1
