caption: Inhibition of tRNA synthetases restores glutathione from the effects of cystine
  deprivation in ferroptosis. Ferroptosis-susceptible cells rely on cystine uptake
  as the primary source of cysteine. However, tRNA synthetase (ARS) inhibition can
  activate the transsulfuration pathway to synthesize cysteine. The dashed arrow indicates
  the hypothetical mechanism by which ATF4 activates the transsulfuration pathway
  through ARS inhibition. Compounds in green indicate ferroptosis inducers targeting
  different points. ARS, tRNA synthetase; ATF4, activating transcription factor 4;
  BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; Cys-Cys, cystine; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; Met,
  methionine; Ser, serine.
papertitle: tRNA synthase suppression activates de novo cysteine synthesis to compensate
  for cystine and glutathione deprivation during ferroptosis.
