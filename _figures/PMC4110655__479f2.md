caption: Proposed mechanism of action of the erythroid regulator ERFE. After blood
  loss, decreased oxygen delivery is sensed in the kidneys, stabilizing HIF and inducing
  EPO production. Binding of EPO to its receptors on erythroid progenitors in the
  bone marrow and the spleen leads to the rapid production of ERFE via the JAK2/STAT5
  signaling pathway. ERFE is then secreted into the circulation and acts directly
  on hepatocytes to signal for hepcidin suppression in order to increase the iron
  flow into plasma for new red blood cell synthesis.
