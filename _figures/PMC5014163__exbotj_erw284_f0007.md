caption: Membrane events of the early signalling cascade induced in plant suspension
  cells by defence elicitors. (A) In tobacco cells, a different mode of recognition
  could be proposed to detect cryptogein (cry), flagellin (flg22), and oligogalacturonide
  (OG). Elicitor perception triggers kinase activation that leads to calcium influx.
  Both mechanisms are able to activate the NADPH oxidase-driven ROS burst, which in
  turn increases membrane order. In parallel, the sterol-trapping ability of cryptogein
  leads to an increase in membrane fluidity which enhances the ROS burst intensity.
  (B) In Arabidopsis cells, upon flg22 binding to its receptor, complex formation
  triggers rapid phosphorylation events. The signal transduction downstream of ligand
  perception includes a Ca2+ burst and activation of RBOH required for the ROS burst.
  Activation of RBOH is required for the increase of membrane order. In this cell
  context, cryptogein is still able to trap sterol, and concomitantly to increase
  membrane fluidity, without inducing any signalling pathway.

  of plant defence.
