caption: VEGF binding to VEGFR2 on endothelial cells activates its Tyr kinase activity
  and results in autophosphorylation of the receptor at several cytoplasmic sites.
  The phosphorylated Tyr serve as docking sites for specific signaling molecules.
  Phosphatidyinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is recruited at phosphorylated Tyr801, increasing
  inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) formation, which in turn activates 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase-1 (PDK1) to phosphorylate and activate Akt, which phosphorylates
  human eNOS at Ser117712,13. This phosphorylation activates eNOS and decreases its
  calcium dependence. VEGFR2 phosphorylation at Tyr951 recruits TSAd and Src, which
  phosphorylates heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) at Tyr, which induces Hsp90 binding
  to eNOS and activation of NO synthesis , and phosphorylates eNOS at Tyr, which is
  also required for eNOS activation . Phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Tyr1175 recruits
  phospholipase-Cγ (PLCγ), which mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ and thereby further
  activates eNOS in a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent manner. PLCγ also increases AMP kinase
  (AMPK)-mediated eNOS phosphorylation at Ser117788. NO produced by eNOS binds to
  the heme on soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) to stimulate cGMP synthesis. cGMP in
  turn activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK-I) and cGMP-gated channels to
  regulate downstream targets that increase endothelial cell proliferation, migration,
  survival, and permeability. cGMP also binds to and regulates several phosphodiesterases
  that terminate that cGMP signal or mediate cross talk with cAMP signaling by hydrolyzing
  that second messenger. Additional parallel signaling through Src, Akt, and the protein
  kinase C-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (PKC-Raf1-MEK-ERK) synergizes
  with NO/cGMP signaling to support each of these endothelial cell responses.

  description: VEGF binding to VEGFR2 on endothelial cells activates its Tyr kinase
