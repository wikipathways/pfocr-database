caption: Schematic model illustrating 20, 12(S)-, and 15-HETE as mediators of MAPK
  and cPLA2 activation in response to NE, Ang II, and EGF. In this model, activation
  of receptors with NE, Ang II, or EGF leads to an influx of Ca2+ ions that bind to
  CaM and activate CaMKII. CaMKII activates cPLA2 and releases AA. CYP450 and, to
  a lesser, extent lipoxygenase metabolites of AA activate MAPK by the Ras/Raf/MEK
  pathway by a positive feedback mechanism. Activation of MAPK amplifies cPLA2 activity
  and further releases AA. R, receptor; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; G, G protein.
