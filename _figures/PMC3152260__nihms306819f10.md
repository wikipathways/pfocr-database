caption: Model illustrating interrelations of insulin, PKCδ and arsenite. Activation
  of the insulin/IGF receptor pathway appears to suppress EGFR signaling, an action
  prevented by arsenite. Insulin/IGFR signaling also stimulates the PI3-kinase pathway,
  including mTOR signaling. These pathways converge on PKCδ, a critical determinant
  of cell state. Arsenite and PI3-kinase or mTOR inhibitor cotreatment thus has an
  additive response in maintaining proliferative potential and yields PKCδ levels
  equivalent to insulin deprivation. Arrows indicate activation, and bars indicate
  suppression. Chemical inhibitors are in italics.
