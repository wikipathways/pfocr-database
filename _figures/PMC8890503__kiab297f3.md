caption: 'Gland cell activation by the JA and Ca2+signaling pathways to enable prey
  digestion and nutrient uptake. The expression of transport proteins to acidify the
  formed stomach after trap closure as well as the expression of digestive enzymes,
  like hydrolases etc., are induced via the JA signaling pathway (blue). Although,
  the associated transport proteins are not known in detail, one could suggest the
  involvement of H+ ATPases and chloride selective channels, which lead to an efflux
  of HCl into the stomach (left gland). Together with early exocytotic vesicles loaded
  with proton and chloride ions (green and yellow), the stomach is acidified in order
  to enable digestive enzyme activity and prey decomposition. The digestive fluid,
  including a diversity of digestive enzymes, is secreted into the trap and the prey
  is degraded. Thereby, the fusion process of exocytotic vesicles is triggered by
  the second messenger calcium (red). The released nutrients (e.g. phosphate, nitrogen
  species, and potassium) as well as organic compounds and prey derived building blocks
  are taken up by the gland cells via channel-based transport processes or endocytosis
  (right gland). DmAMT1 displays an ammonium channel and therefore transports the
  nitrogen source into the cytosol of the gland cells. The macronutrient potassium
  is taken up with high capacity and low affinity by the K+ selective DmKT1 channel
  and the proton-driven, high-affine transporter DmHAK5. Both modules enable a consistent
  potassium uptake and are activated via the Ca2+-dependent sensor/kinase complex
  CBL/CIPK. The absorption of prey-derived sodium ions is mediated by the DmHKT1 channel
  and is further sequestered into the trap vacuole to prevent the toxification of
  photosynthetically active tissue. The nutrient uptake by transport proteins is furthermore
  supplemented by endocytosis (gray) that facilitates the absorption of whole proteins
  as well as the re-absorption of the secreted digestive enzymes. Endocytoses enables
  the Venus flytrap to finalize the uptake process and to prevent a loss of compounds
  during the following re-opening. ATP: adenosine triphosphate; expr: expression;
  CBL: Calcineurin B-like protein; CIPK: CBL-interacting protein kinase.'
