caption: Key signaling pathways involved in nicotine plus HFD-induced hepatocellular
  apoptosis. Nicotine when combined with a HFD induces oxidative stress and results
  in activation of caspase 2 and JNK and induction of iNOS. It is likely that induction
  of iNOS, through increased nitric oxide production, perturbs BAX/BCL-2 ratio and
  triggers cytochrome c release from mitochondria, resulting in activation of caspases
  9 and 3 and hepatocellular apoptosis [, ].
