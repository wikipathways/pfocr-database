caption: The landscape of neurotoxic epigenetic modifications inducing mitochondrial
  dysfunction in PD. (A) Epigenetic modifications of SNCA gene include multiple events
  that cause abnormal α‐synuclein expression. (i) Hypomethylation of the intron 1
  of SNCA locus dysregulates SNCA gene transcription, leading to abnormal α‐synuclein
  aggregation in the cytoplasm. This allows abnormal α‐synuclein to enter the nucleus
  following oxidative stress and sequester DNMT1 into the cytoplasm, enhancing the
  hypomethylation of SNCA gene and causing dysregulated transcription. (ii) Meanwhile,
  HDAC inhibitors cause hyperacetylation of α‐synuclein‐linked histones H2, H3, H4,
  and p300 promoter region of SNCA. This results in reduced Sirtuin 1/2 activity,
  which leads to higher α‐synuclein aggregation accompanied by impaired mitochondrial
  biogenesis. (iii) Various noncoding RNAs dysregulate SNCA gene expression, such
  that, CDR1as sponge with miR‐7, circzip2 with miR‐60, lowered levels of miR‐124
  and miR‐153 expression and higher expression of LncR‐SNHG lowers miR‐15b‐5p levels,
  which upregulates SIAH1 axis, thus contributing to the over‐expression of mRNA (SNCA)
  to trigger α‐synuclein aggregation and oxidative stress. (B) Reduced Sirtuin activity
  results in increased histone acetylation and reduced expression of nuclear‐encoded
  mitochondrial gene PGC1‐α that further downregulate TEAM, SIRT‐3, and Nrf1/2, impairing
  the mitochondrial biogenesis and promoting α‐synuclein accumulation. Upregulated
  miR‐485 and miR‐366a also downregulate the expression of PGC1 α to fuel the process.
  Further, LncR‐Nrf2 also inhibits Nrf1/2 expression to promote mitochondrial dysfunction.
  (C) Hypomethylation of the PINK gene stimulates elevated ROS production and disturbed
  mitochondrial metabolism. (D) Epigenetic modifications in PARK2 gene. (i) Hypomethylation
  of PARK2 gene results in dysregulated parkin expression. (ii) Upregulated miR‐34b/c
  causes downregulation of parkin protein with DJ‐1, leading to higher oxidative levels,
  abridged mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced ATP levels along with higher
  mitochondrial fragmentation. (E) Upregulated lncRNA‐MALAT1 and lncRNA‐HOTAIR sponge
  with miR‐205‐5p to increase the LRRK2 expression that promotes neuronal apoptosis
  through oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. (F) Upregulated miR‐4639‐5p,
  miR‐494, miR‐184*, and let‐7f downregulate DJ‐1 expression that triggers oxidative
  stress‐induced neuronal lesions. (G) Downregulated miR‐124 upregulates BCL2L11 (BIM
  protein) that induces mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathways. (H) Overexpression
  of TET2 promotes hydroxy‐methylation (5hmC) in the promoter region of CDKN2A gene
  that causes α‐syn aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction. (I) Various noncoding
  RNAs target multiple genes and pathways to enhance oxidative stress‐simulated mitochondrial
  damage. (i) lncRNA HAGLROS and lncRNA UCA‐1 activate P13K/Akt pathway that induces
  oxidative stress and damages mitochondria, resulting in neuronal apoptosis and autophagy.
  (ii) Downregulated LncRNA AS Uchl1 lowers Nurr1 activity that links with mitochondrial
  dysfunction due to higher oxidative stress. (iii) LncRNA‐p2 sponge with miR‐625
  exaggerating oxidative levels and inducing cytotoxicity and neuronal apoptosis.
  (iv) lncRNA NORAD target PUM2 gene to induce genomic instability and mitochondrial
  dysfunction. These events cause higher oxidative stress levels and mitochondrial
  anomalies, leading to DA neurons’ degenerative death, hallmarks of PD. The solid
  lines illustrate confirmed pathways, whereas the dotted lines illustrate pathways
  that need to be confirmed further. ↑ illustrate upregulated and ↓ illustrate downregulated
