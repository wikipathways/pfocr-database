caption: '(A) Schematic diagram of molecular pathways during ischemia including the
  traditional glutamate dependent mechanism and newly discovered non-glutamate dependent
  mechanisms. Glutamate dependent mechanism of cerebral ischemia is the most extensively
  studied mechanism and it is thought that energy failure due to ischemia leads to
  depolarization of presynaptic neurons, which leads to a massive release of glutamate.
  Increased glutamate in the extracellular space hyper-activates glutamate receptors,
  which consequently leads to excitotoxic Ca2+ overload. Recently, other non-glutamate
  dependent mechanisms that may contribute to the overall ionic imbalance have been
  discovered and these are: TRPM7, ASICs, VRACs, hemichannels, KATP, NCXs, and NSCCs.
  These pathways may even interact with each other suggesting complex molecular cascades
  upon ischemic insults. (B) Current working model of TRPM7 activation during cerebral
  Ischemia. Ischemic conditions are associated with decreases in extracellular pH
  (acidic) and concentrations of divalent ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+) and these changes may
  activate TRPM7 independent of other pathways. The initial influx of Ca2+via glutamate-dependent
  pathway stimulates productions of nitrogen oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2−) and these
  combine to produce peroxynitrite (ONOO−). These reactive oxygen species and reactive
  nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) further promote sustained activation of TRPM7, which
  consequently causes a prolonged build up of intracellular Ca2+ leading to ischemic
  damages.'
