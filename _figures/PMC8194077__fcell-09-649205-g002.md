caption: Genetic and pharmacological approaches to Notch inhibition. (A) Genetic inactivation
  strategies leading to inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway are represented
  by red “X” with the exception of dnMAML, where the red “X” depicts the disruption
  of the Notch transcription activation complex due to expression of a truncated,
  dominant negative (dn) form of MAML1. In addition to conditional expression of dnMAML,
  commonly used approaches include conditional inactivation of Notch ligand genes,
  Notch receptor genes, Adam10, genes encoding components of the γ-secretase complex
  or Rbpj; (B) Strategies of pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling either
  though the administration monoclonal antibodies targeting the Notch ligands or receptors,
  or small molecule inhibitors. γ-secretase inhibitors target components of the γ-secretase
  complex. CB-103 inhibits the Notch transcription complex.
