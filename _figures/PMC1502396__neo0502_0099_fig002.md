caption: A synopsis of the crosstalk between AR and the ErbB cascade. This figure
  provides a brief outline of the interplay of AR and ErbB cascade in promoting PC
  survival. Growth factor signals augment AR survival signals and enhance AR transactivation
  through the MAPK/ERK, MEKK/JNKK/c-Jun, and the PI3K/Akt pathways. This enhancement
  is shown in vitro to occur both in the presence and absence of ligand. Apoptotic
  responses initiated by stress signals acting through MEKK/JNKK/JNK and the AR can
  be subverted by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway downstream of growth factors,
  thereby allowing PC cell survival.
