caption: 'Regulation of HIF-α via two pathways under hypoxia (deprived oxygen condition~0–5%
  O2). Under hypoxia both pathway (I) and pathway (II) are inhibited due to absence
  of oxygen (the essential substrate of PHD and FIH enzyme). Therefore, HIF-α subunit
  escapes the hydroxylation by PHD or FIH enzymes, and subsequently translocates to
  the nucleus and dimerises with HIF-1β subunit to form functional heterodimeric HIF.
  Activated HIF i then binds to the hypoxia response elements (HREs), leading to a
  transcriptionally active complex which activates the expression of hundreds of genes
  including EPO, VEGF and GLUT-1. HIF = hypoxia-inducible factor; HIF-α = hypoxia-inducible
  factor α-subunit; HIF-β = hypoxia-inducible factor β-subunit; PAS = Per ARNT SIM
  domain; ODDD = oxygen-dependent degradation domain; CAD = C-terminal transactivation
  domain; PHD = prolyl hydroxylase; FIH = factor inhibiting HIF; 2OG = 2-oxoglutarate;
  Fe(II) = iron ferrous; Pro = prolyl; Asn = asparagine; HRE = hypoxia response elements;
  EPO = erythropoietin; VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor; GLUT-1 = glucose
  transporter 1.(Figure source: Tan, S.C., Cardiac Stem Cell Therapy for Infarcted
  Rat Hearts, in the Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics. 2011, University
