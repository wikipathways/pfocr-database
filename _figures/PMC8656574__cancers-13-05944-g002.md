caption: Roles of lncRNA in OSCC tumor microenvironment. (A) Hypoxic TME. HAS2-AS1
  activates NF-κB in response to HIF-1α induced by microenvironment hypoxia, leading
  to HAS2 accumulation in CD44, RHAMM depend-way, which promotes EMT and invasion.
  (B) Metabolic reprogramming. lncRNA-p23154 promotes GLUT1 expression to enhance
  glycolysis via binding with the promoter region of miR-378a-3p, leading to increased
  metastatic potential. (C) CAF transformation. loc100506114 promotes functional transformation
  of NFs to the phenotype of CAFs by forming a feedback loop with EZH2 to activate
  CAFs secrete GDF10. (D) Immune regulation. Linc02195 regulates MHC I protein to
  affect immunosurveillance by being closely associated with high expression of HLA
  I gene, and it showed a positive correlation between increasing number of infiltrating
  CD8+T and CD4+T cells. (E) Extracellular vesicles. Exosomal-LBX1-AS1 from RBPJ overexpressed
  macrophages inhibited the proliferation and invasion of OSCC cells by the miR-182-5p/FOXO3
  pathway.
