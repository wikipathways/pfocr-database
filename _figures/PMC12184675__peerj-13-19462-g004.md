caption: The pathway begins with the recognition of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
  by RIG-I-like receptors, including RIG-I and MDA-5, triggering a cascade of immune
  responses. Activation of MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein) leads
  to downstream signalling involving MyD88, IRAK1/4, and NAP1, resulting in the activation
  of transcription factors such as IRF3, IRF7, IRF9, and NF-κB subunits (p50/65).
  This activation promotes the production of interferons (via IFNAR1 signalling) and
  interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), critical for antiviral responses. The figure
  also highlights SARS-CoV-2 protein inhibitors, including non-structural proteins
  (NSPs) and open reading frames (ORFs), which interfere with various signalling components,
  such as MAVS and IRF pathways, to suppress immune activation. Additionally, key
  molecules like angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), neuropilin 1 (NRP1), and
  receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (IkB) kinases (IKKα/β/γ/ɛ) are illustrated,
  emphasizing their roles in the pathway
