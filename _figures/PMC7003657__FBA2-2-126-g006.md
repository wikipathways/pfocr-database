caption: Schematic diagram of the consequences of TNFR2‐mediated survival signaling
  in ccRCC‐CD133+CSCs; selective ligation of TNFR2 mediates the induction of pSTAT3Ser727
  through phosphorylation of VEGFR2/PI 3K/Akt/mTORC pathway leading to the survival
  of CSCs in ccRCC. Pharmacological inhibition of these phosphorylated kinases results
  in a diminished expression of TNF‐mediated pSTAT3Ser727 formation and causes an
  increase in cell death. Furthermore, selective ligation of TNFR2 mediates the expression
  of TNFR2 and its association with pSTAT3Ser727 in mitochondria. The absence of TNFR2/STAT3
  causes an increase in cell death triggering change in mitochondrial ultrastructure,
  translocation of cytochrome c to cytosol, activation of cleaved caspase 3p175, phosphorylation
  of MLKLSer358, and generation of ROS, which can be blocked by NAC. Cell death is
  partially inhibited by z‐VAD.fmk, further attenuated by Nec‐1, with an additive
  effect by a combination of both z‐VAD.fmk and Nec‐1, indicating the dominance of
  necroptotic cell death pathway
