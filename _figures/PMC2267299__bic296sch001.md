caption: L-γ-Glutamylcysteinylglycine, or glutathione, is composed of glutamate, cysteine
  and glycine residues. In the trans-sulfuration pathway, methionine acts as the sulfur
  source for cysteine synthesis via a number of intermediates. Initially, methionine
  undergoes adenylation, catalysed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) to form
  S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which, following demethylation, generates S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH). Homocysteine (Hcy) is generated by the hydrolysis of SAH to adenosine and
  homocysteine. Next, in a committed reaction catalysed by cystathionine β-synthase
  (CBS), homocysteine condenses with serine to form cystathionine, which in turn is
  rapidly converted into cysteine by the activity of cystathionine γ-lyase (CGL).
  GCL joins glutamate and cysteine in an ATP-dependent reaction, to form GC, which
  upon addition of glycine, forms GSH. Cys-Gly is formed by the breakdown of GSH.
  The metabolites that were measured in the present study are boxed. Italicized abbreviations
  represent enzyme activities. MS, methionine synthase; GS, glutathione synthase.
