caption: Diagram showing the different biofarming alternatives used instead of AN
  chemical synthesis. (1) Use of genetically modified, fast growing organisms, such
  as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for AN production. (2) Nicotiana
  tabacum used as a model plant for molecular farming. (3) Plant endogenous factors,
  such as phytohormones and external abiotic factors, positively affect both trichome
  proliferation and artemisinin biosynthesis. (4) Crop-breeding and vegetative propagation
  used to obtain tissue with higher AN content (5) Use of transcription factors, that
  positively regulate artemisinin pathway, as an approach for increasing the amount
  of this molecule in the plant. (6) Metabolic engineering of overexpressing endogenous
  enzymes of terpenoid biosynthesis in A. annua. The artemisinin biosynthetic pathway
  occurs exclusively in the glandular trichomes of A. annua plant. Despite AN biosynthesis
  utilizes carbon mainly from the mevalonate pathway in the cytosol, Farnesyl diphosphate
  (FPP), AN precursor, is partially synthetized in the plastid through a non-mevalonate
  pathway. Therefore, redirection of the mevalonate pathway away from the cytosol,
  to plastid compartments, such as chloroplasts and mitochondria, may be a novel approach
  for increasing significantly AN production.
