caption: 'An overview of the autophagy pathway. Autophagy can be broken down into
  five steps: induction, nucleation, maturation, fusion, and degradation. The first
  committed step of autophagy is activation of Ulk1, which results in the formation
  of a complex with Atg13, Fip200, and Atg101. In turn, the ULK1 complex can activate
  the PI3 kinase complex (VPS34, VPS15, Beclin1, ATG14). The VPS34 complex generates
  phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) on the cytosolic face of the ER
  membrane to form the omegasome, which recruits effector proteins WIPI2/DFCP1. In
  turn, WIPI1/DFCP1 recruits a ubiquitin-like conjugation system, ATG12-AT5-ATG16L1,
  that cleaves LC3-1 and subsequently conjugates it with phosphatidylethanoloamine
  to form LC3-II. The latter is critical for the elongation and closure of the phagophore.
  Several cargo proteins, including p62/sequestosome, recruit cargo to the growing
  phagophore. Ultimately, the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome, resulting in
  the degradation of contents. Many proteins within this pathway are O-GlcNAc–modified
  (156), including central players indicated with a blue square (): AMPK (249), ULK1,
  Beclin1, and p62/sequestosome (56). Steps promoted and inhibited by O-GlcNAcylation
  are identified. AMPK, 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG, autophagy; CaMK II,
  calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2; DFCP1, double FYVE-containing
  protein 1; GRASP55, Golgi reassembly-stacking protein of 55 kDa; LC3, microtubule-associated
  proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B; LKB1, liver kinase B1; mTOR, mammalian target of
