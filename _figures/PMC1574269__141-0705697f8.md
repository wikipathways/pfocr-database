caption: Schematic representation of the neuromodulatory action of adenosine in the
  myenteric plexus of rat ileum. In response to stimulation, extracellular adenosine
  (ADO) can be originated directly via bi-directional NT from both nerve and muscle
  cells. In addition, released ATP may be sequentially dephosphorylated by extracellular
  nucleotidases to form endogenous adenosine. Ecto-5′-nucleotidase (Ecto-5′-NTase),
  the limiting enzyme of the ectonucleotidase pathway, plays an important role in
  regulating the rate of local adenosine production from adenine nucleotides. Endogenously
  generated adenosine can interact with facilitatory A2A receptors located on myenteric
  nerve varicosities to stimulate the release of ACh. Adenosine signalling is tightly
  regulated by the nucleoside inactivation mechanisms. Deamination to form INO by
  ADA existing extracellularly (Ecto-ADA) represents the most efficient mechanism
  regulating synaptic adenosine levels. Adenosine uptake into cells via facilitated
  NTS may also contribute and serve to restrict adenosine actions to the release/production
  region. Note that while the facilitatory adenosine A2A receptor seems to be localised
  at the neuro-effector region, the inhibitory A1 receptor may be located further
  away from the sites of adenosine formation and removal and hence may be more accessible
  to exogenous adenosine. For the sake of clarity, prejunctional muscarinic and P2
  receptors are omitted.
