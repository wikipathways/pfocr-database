caption: Heme, either derived from intracellular sources, such as hemoproteins and
  mitochondria, or from damaged tissues and red blood cell hemolysis (extracellular
  sources) is utilized by heme oxygenase enzymes (HO-1 and HO-2) to generate carbon
  monoxide (CO), biliverdin and iron. Biliverdin is converted to bilirubin by biliverdin
  reductase (BVR), while iron is stored in the ferritin protein. Although heme oxygenase
  enzymes were initially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, recent reports suggest
  that HO-1 can be found under certain conditions in other cellular compartments such
  as the nucleus.
