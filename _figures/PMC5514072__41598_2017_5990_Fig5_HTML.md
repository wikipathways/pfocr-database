caption: A putative blue light signaling pathway in M. purpureus M9. Red and blue
  arrows indicate inhibition and activation, respectively. Blue light activates the
  IP3-DAG signaling pathway in M9 while inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway. Phosphatidylinositol
  4, 5 bisphosphate (PIP2), located on cell membrane, was degraded by1-phosphatidylinositol
  4, 5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase (PLC), and liberated to inositol 1, 4, 5 trisphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).The IP3-DAG pathway regulates the intracellular Ca2+
  concentration; the MAPK signaling pathway is associated with development and secondary
  metabolism in many fungi. Genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) and target
  proteins (TP) are also regulated by the two signaling pathways above. Exposure to
  B15 conditions slowed primary metabolism, development and reproduction in M9 while
  enhancing secondary metabolism such as pigment biosynthesis.
