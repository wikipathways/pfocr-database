caption: The proposed schema for BCD function in oxidative stress of TWP-induced POI.
  BCD prevents TWP-induced oxidative stress through regulating Nrf2/Keap 1 signaling
  pathway. In normal circumstances, Nrf2 is predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm,
  where it incorporated into a complex that binds to Keap 1 and Clu3, and then to
  be degradation (orange indicator). While, Bach 1 is mainly distributed in nucleus.
  When oxidative stress occurs, Nrf2 releases from Nrf2-Keap1-Cul3 complex, then translocates
  into the nucleus to combined with Maf-ARE, and subsequently promotes expressions
  of antioxidant enzymes, that included HO-1, SOD, CAT (blue indicator). Exposure
  to TWP induces ovarian oxidative stress, furthermore, TWP blocks nuclear translocation
  of Nrf2 and Bach 1 which ultimately inhibits the expression of antioxidant enzymes
  resulting in aggravation of oxidative damage (black indicator). However, with BCD
  co-treatment, the blocking of Nrf2 and Bach 1 nuclear translocation were reversed
  and the expression of antioxidant enzymes were increased (green indicator).
