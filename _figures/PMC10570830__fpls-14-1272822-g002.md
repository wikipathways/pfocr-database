caption: 'PIFs are the key regulators of skotomorphogenesis. Left panel: during development
  in the dark, PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) act with COP1-SPA complex (CUL4-DDB1-COP1-SPA)
  and CDD complex (CUL4-DDB1-COP10-DET1) to inhibit the activity of different transcription
  factors related to chloroplast biogenesis, like HY5, HYH, HFR1 and GLK2. The COP1-SPA
  complex also acts to stabilize PIFs by inactivating BIN2. The PIFs induce the expression
  of the genes related to different phytohormone signaling pathways. Right panel:
  soon after illumination, the cotyledons open and light perception triggers the activation
  of different photoreceptors. Light-activated cryptochromes (Cry) and phytochromes
  (from inactive Pr to the active form pfr) interact and/or induce the degradation
  of the PIFs in photobodies. Moreover, after being activated by the blue light, cryptochromes
  interfere with the COP1 complexes. All these events release and enhance the activity
  of different transcription factors like HY5 and GLKs, resulting in the expression
  of chloroplast biogenesis and function genes.'
