caption: JNK is initially activated by the MAPK cascade either extrinsically by receptor
  signaling or intrinsically by organelle stress emanating from mitochondria, ER,
  or nucleus. Activated JNK translocates to the mitochondria where it binds and phosphorylates
  Sab on the cytoplasmic side of the outer membrane (OM). This leads to release of
  inactive SHP1 sequestered by Sab which then is activated by P-Src and mediates inactivation
  of P-Y419Src, facilitated by the inner membrane (IM) DOK4 platform. Active Src maintains
  electron transport whereas inactivation leads to impaired electron transport which
  promotes increased ROS release. The ROS release continues to activate upstream MAPK
  leading to JNK activation in a self-sustaining loop which accounts for JNK activation
  being sustained. In APAP toxicity, the amplified mitochondrial ROS from damaged
  mitochondria due to this loop promotes mitochondrial permeability pore (MPT) opening
  and necrosis, whereas in TNF-induced apoptosis the sustained JNK activation is known
  to lead to enhanced activity of pro-apoptotic Bcl proteins and impairment of anti-apoptotic
  Bcl proteins; the result is mitochondrial outer membrane permeablization (MOMP)
  which permits release of cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins, followed
  by caspase activation, and apoptosis. The key feature is that the Sab-dependent
  effect of P-JNK on mitochondria via an intramitochondrial signaling pathway is the
  mechanism for sustained activation of P-JNK in the cytoplasm which is necessary
  for cell death.
