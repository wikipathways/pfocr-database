caption: a Ligand binding and subsequent Erbb dimer formation initiates signaling
  through a complex array of intracellular pathways that initiate and control a range
  of cellular processes. Dimer formation results in the cross-phosphorylation of the
  dimer partners, creating docking sites that allow the recruitment of downstream
  signaling components and the formation of signaling complexes. Two key signaling
  pathways activated by the Erbb family dimers are the MAPK pathway, which stimulates
  proliferation, and the PI3K–Akt pathway, which promotes tumor cell survival (see
  the figure). Only signaling through these two pathways and some of the known outcomes
  are shown here for simplicity. b The antibody trastuzumab binds directly to domain
  IV of the extracellular region of ERBB2, suppressing ERBB2 signaling activity, preventing
  cleavage of the extracellular domain, and marking tumor cells that overexpress ERBB2
  for further immunological attack through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
