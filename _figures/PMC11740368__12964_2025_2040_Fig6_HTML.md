caption: Pers expression regulates tumorigenesis. Per1/2 expression affects cell cycle
  arrest in tumor cells by influencing the expression of cell cycle regulators. Pers
  are involved in the ATM-Chk1/Chk2 and p53 pathways in response to DNA damage to
  inhibit tumorigenesis. The expression level of Per1/2/3 regulates the expression
  of cell cycle proteins and related factors to control tumor cell proliferation,
  apoptosis, and migration. In some tumor cells, Pers is dependent on MDM2-p53 or
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways to control cell growth. Per1/2/3 expression levels affect
  hormone levels, glycolytic function, and glutamine metabolism, leading to the involvement
  of PERs in tumor progression. In addition, Pers expression affects the production
  of inflammatory mediators with the involvement of immune cells such as NK cells
  and T cells, thereby affecting tumor progression. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are generated
  in response to the epithelial mesenchymal transition-regulating transcription factor
  and the biological clock factor Per2. CSCs in response to high levels of Per2/3
  suppress tumors through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Created in https://BioRender.com
