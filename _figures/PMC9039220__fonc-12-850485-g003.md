caption: Molecular mechanism of activated platelets inducing malignant phenotype of
  PC cells. PDGFR activated by PDGF induces the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue
  in the intracellular domain, activating the Hippo/Yes-associated protein signaling
  pathway and promoting MCL-1, N-cadherin and inhibiting E-cadherin (red arrow). Notch-1
  is promoted by activated PDGFR and releases intracellular domain of Notch 1 (NICD),
  which enters the nucleus and increases the expression of Bcl2, Cyclin D1 and NF-κB.
  NF-κB promotes the expression of MMP9 and VEGF by binding nuclear genes (blue arrow).
  Activated PDGFR induces phosphorylation of MUC1CT and Src, phosphorylation of Src
  induces phosphorylation of β-catenin, and the combination of phosphorylated MUC1CT
  and β-catenin enhances the invasion of PC cells (pink arrow). PDGF induces PSC to
  proliferate and secrete collagen, thereby aggravating pancreatic fibrosis. The deletion
  of p53 and the mutation of K-ras not only inhibits the binding of p73 and NY-F,
  so that the activation of PDGFR is not inhibited, but also induces β-catenin phosphorylation
  through Src phosphorylation to promote the expression of PDGF (black arrow). Activated
  TGF-βR promotes the expression of Smad, and the Smad protein enters the nucleus
  to promote the expression of CDD and Slug (green arrow). VEGF induces the proliferation
  and remodeling of endothelial cells in the TME.
