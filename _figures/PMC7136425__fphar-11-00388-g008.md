caption: Compound BA-5 inhibits HSCs activation through blocking both TGF-β1 and LPS-induced
  NF-κB signaling pathways and further inhibits macrophage recruitment and activation.
  BA-5 inhibited TGF-β1-induced α-SMA, col1a2, and phosphorylated-smad2/3 expression
  in HSCs. Furthermore, BA-5 treatment enhanced BAMBI expression and inhibited LPS-induced
  IκBα and NF-κB phosphorylation, NF-κB nucleus translocation, MCP-1 secretion, and
  ICAM-1 expression. And then, reduced the activation of macrophage (RAW264.7) by
  inhibiting the protein phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38.
