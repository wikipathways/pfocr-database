caption: Biosynthetic pathway of GSL and the CIRES procedure. A, biosynthetic pathway
  for GSLs. Biosynthetic pathways for GSLs comprising various series are illustrated.
  Arrows indicate specific glycosyltransferase reactions for biosynthesis. Biosynthetic
  pathways of globo-series (top), lacto series (middle), and ganglio series (bottom)
  incorporating GSL branching at the glycosyltransferase reaction for GM3Syn/ST3GAL5
  (depicted as 3), Lc3Syn/B3GNT5 (6), and CD77Syn/A4GALT (7), respectively. The biosynthesis
  of these three series of glycans share the same substrate, LacCer. The names of
  the GSLs that terminate with the indicated sugars are shown below. GM1 and CD77
  are epitopes for the B subunit of the cholera toxin and shiga toxin, respectively.
  B, the general concept of CIRES is illustrated. The main methodology and factors
  involved in CIRES were previously reported (). Briefly, the glycan expression profile
  was statistically tested against the expression profiles of glycan-related genes
  that were obtained by cross-sample comparison of cDNA microarray experiments. The
  presence of glycan-related genes, which exhibit similar (positively correlated)
  or dissimilar (negatively correlated) profiles to glycan expression, are listed
  as candidate(s) responsible genes. Genes exhibiting statistical significance by
  the Pearson correlation index analyses were then experimentally tested for their
  ability to change the expression of glycans on the cell surface via gene-transfer
  experiments.
