caption: Spermine synthesis and catabolism in mammalian cells. Arginine produces ornithine
  through the action of arginase. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is the first rate-limiting
  enzyme in spermine synthesis, in which ornithine is decarboxylated to produce putrescine.
  Spermidine synthase (SRS) and spermine synthase (SMS) are constitutively expressed
  aminopropyltransferases that catalyze the transfer of the aminopropyl group from
  decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM) to putrescine and spermidine to form
  spermidine and spermine, respectively, as well as methylthioadenosine (MTA). The
  dcSAM is converted from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) by enzymatic role of adenosylmethionine
  decarboxylase (AMD) as a second rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis. The
  central enzyme in the polyamine catabolic pathway is spermidine-spermine-N1-acetyltransferase
  (SSAT), which monoacetylates spermidine and mono-/diacetylates spermine. These acetylated
  polyamines are the substrates of N1-acetylpolyamine oxidase (PAO), which are catalyzed
  to form putrescine or spermidine, respectively. Spermine can be oxidized directly
  and specifically to produce spermidine by spermine oxidase (SMO).
