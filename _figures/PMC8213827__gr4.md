caption: 'Chaperone-like function model of LEA proteins. In the absence of a LEA,
  the enzymes undergo aggregation under stresses and thereby resulting in inactivation.
  In normal conditions, LEAs are disordered and can bind crucial enzymes in metabolic
  pathways, such as LDH or MDH, in a weak manner. Once stressed, LEAs become ordered
  and their interaction with the enzyme becomes stronger, preventing the enzyme from
  aggregation and maximally preserving its enzymatic activity. EMP: Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas
  pathway; TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
