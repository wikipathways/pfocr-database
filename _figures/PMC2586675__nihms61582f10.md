caption: Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (4, PLP) is the biologically active form of vitamin
  B6 and is an important cofactor for several of the enzymes involved in the metabolism
  of amine-containing natural products such as amino acids and amino-sugars (–). There
  are two distinct PLP biosynthetic pathways that have not yet been found to coexist
  in the same organism (). The Escherichia coli pathway has been extensively studied
  (–). In this pathway, PdxJ catalyzes the formation of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (3,
  PNP) from 3-phosphohydroxy-1-aminoacetone 2 and 1-deoxy-D-xyulose 5-phosphate 1.
  This is then oxidized to PLP 4 by PdxH (). In the alternative pathway, PLP is formed
  from ribose 5-phosphate (5, R5P), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (6, G3P) and ammonia
  formed by the hydrolysis of glutamine (–) (). The required genes in Bacillus subtilis
  are YaaD and YaaE. Orthologs of YaaD (Snz, PdxS and Pdx1) and YaaE (Sno, PdxT and
  Pdx2) are widely distributed in bacteria, eukarya and archaea (–). YaaD shows an
  unusually high degree of sequence conservation with approximately 28% of its residues
  (78/280) absolutely conserved over 73 amino acid sequences. The structure of PdxS
  from Geobacillus stearothemophilus has been previously reported (). This protein
  is a dodecamer with 622 point symmetry. The monomers have a classic (β/α)8 fold
  with the axis of each β-barrel approximately perpendicular to the molecular sixfold
  axis. YaaE is a class I amidotransferase (, ) characterized by a conserved Glu-His-Cys
  (). The structures of YaaE from Bacillus subtilis () and Bacillus stearothermophilus
  (PDB ID 1Q7R) have been reported as well as the YaaE ortholog, Pdx2, from Plasmodium
  falciparum (). YaaE has an (αβα) three layer sandwich fold and a highly conserved
  glutamine binding site. YaaD and YaaE form a complex () in which the ammonia generated
  by hydrolysis of glutamine is channeled to the YaaD active site.
