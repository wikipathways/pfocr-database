caption: The Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. TLRs are categorized into
  two groups depending upon whether they utilize a MyD88-dependent pathway or a TRIF-dependent
  pathway. TLRs 1,2, and 5–9 transmit signals through a MyD88-dependent pathway, whereas
  TLR3 signaling is mediated by a MyD88-independent pathway. By contrast, TLR4 can
  signal through MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways. In case of MyD88-dependent
  signaling, IL-1R-associated kinases 1/4 (IRAK1/4) recruit TNF receptor–associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 can also stimulate interferon signaling by recruitment of
  IRFs. TRAF6 activates TAK1 which activates two distinct pathways, one of which leads
  to the activation of the IKK complex-NF-κB pathway and the other to the activation
  of the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The catalytic subunits IKKα, IKKβ,
  and IKKγ make up the IKK complex. IKKβ is also activated by TAK1. The IKK complex
  phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitory protein IκBα, which is then degraded by the
  proteasome, allowing NF-κB to enter the nucleus. TAK1 activation triggers the activation
  of MAPK family members leads to the activation of transcription factors such cyclic
  AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), and activator protein 1 (AP-1). CREB,
  AP-1 and NF-κB then stimulate proinflammatory mediators and interferons. However,
  in case of TRIF-dependent signaling, IRF3 and IRF7 are recruited which lead to secretion
  of type 1 and type 3 interferon.
