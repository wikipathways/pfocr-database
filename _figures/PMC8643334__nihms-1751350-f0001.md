caption: Immunomodulatory activities of HBeAg. (A) If Kupffer cells of the offspring
  are pre-exposed to maternal HBeAg either in utero or immediately after birth, they
  will undergo the M2 polarization when they are exposed to HBeAg again. M2 Kupffer
  cells have an increased expression level of PD-L1 and can suppress HBV-specific
  CD8+ T cells. In contrast, naïve Kupffer cells without the prior exposure to maternal
  HBeAg will undergo the M1 polarization when they are exposed to HBeAg to activate
  T cells. (B) HBeAg can reduce the mobility of monocytes and neutrophils, stimulate
  the expansion of mMDSCs via PBMCs to impair T cell functions, induce the miR-212–3p
  expression to regulate the activity of macrophages, and induce the expression of
  IL-10 in regulatory T (Treg) cells to suppress NK cells. (C) HBeAg can suppress
  TLR2 signaling and NF-κB signaling, induce the expression of soluble Fas (sFas)
  and suppress the expression of membrane-associated Fas (mFas), and induce the expression
  of SOCS2 to suppress the IFN signaling pathway.
