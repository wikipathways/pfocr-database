caption: A schematic of the lignin synthesis pathway showing the relative levels of
  specific metabolites in rice leaves infected with Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici
  (Pst) (blur bar) or mock-inoculated leaves (purple bar) at 48 and 120 hours post
  inoculation (hpi), and the relative transcription levels of selected genes at 24,
  48, and 120 hpi. Metabolite peak intensities (n = 3, average ± SD) are depicted
  on the primary y axis. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences
  compared to the mock controls using two-sided Student’s t-test. (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).
  The heatmap represents changes in transcript level of genes as log2(fold change)
  in comparison with the mock controls. Enzymes catalyze the biochemical reaction
  are indicated in white text in green box. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H,
  cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase;
  CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; LAC, laccase; C3H, p-coumaroyl ester 3-hydroxylase;
  CAIdOMT, 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde O-methyltransferase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase;
  CAId5H, coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase
