  ethylene signaling via upregulation of the expression of AtEIN3, AtEIL1, and AtETR1

  [Ca2+]cyt [,,,,,,], ROS and ethylene [,,], and ethylene and [Ca2+]cyt [,,,] regulate
  the PM Na+/H+ antiport system, including Na+/H+ antiporter (via SOS pathway) and
  H+-ATPase (H+ pumps). Furthermore, ethylene directly activates the SOS signaling
  pathway by increasing the transcription of AtSOS1/2/3 (a novel finding in the present

  K+/Na+ homeostasis in salinity stress. ET: ethylene; PM: plasma membrane; DA-KORCs:
