caption: Transcriptional cofactor p300 is required for LS-induced expression of KCa2.3.
  (A) An overview of the ChIP procedure. Generally, cells are initially treated with
  a cross-linking agent that covalently links DNA-interacting proteins to the DNA.
  The genomic DNA is then isolated and sheared by sonication to yield a suitable fragment
  size distribution. An antibody that specifically recognizes the protein of interest
  is then added, and immunoprecipitation is used to isolate specific protein-DNA complexes.
  The cross-links are then reversed, and the DNA fragments are purified and subjected
  to PCR analysis. (B-a) Schematic of the KCa2.3 genomic DNA region. The square boxes
  indicate the DNA region amplified by PCR in the ChIP assay. (B-b) Time dependence
  of LS-stimulated recruitment of p300 to the KCa2.3 promoter as measured in ChIP
  assays. The cells were treated with LS for the indicated times. The precipitated
  KCa2.3 promoter region (-688 to -203 bp) was amplified by PCR. The figure represents
  one of at least three individual experiments. The proximal KCa2.3 promoter region
  (-688 to -203 bp) was amplified by PCR following ChIP. Mouse IgG represents negative
  control. The ChIP experiments were repeated three times. (C) Proposed model of LS-induced
  KCa2.3 activation in H9c2 cells. Under normal conditions, KCa2.3 is expressed at
  a basal level. When cells are subjected to LS, p300 is recruited to the KCa2.3 promoter,
  where it activates KCa2.3 transcription. LS results in activation of the PI3K/Akt
  cascade and recruitment of p300 to the promoter of the KCa2.3 promoter. KCa2.3 transcription
  is regulated in a p300-dependent manner by a PI3K/Akt cascade. This signaling pathway
  may contribute to the sustained expression of KCa2.3 in H9c2 cells. p300, histone
  acetyltransferase p300; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PCR, polymerase chain
  reaction; LS, laminar shear stress condition; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Akt,
  protein kinase B; KCa, Ca2+-activated K+ channels.
