caption: Schematic picture of molecular events indicating necroptotic cell damage
  via its canonical and noncanonical pathways under the conditions of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion
  injury. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury leads to the activation of RIP3 promoting
  phosphorylation and subsequent translocation of MLKL to the plasma membrane causing
  its rupture. This canonical signaling pathway of necroptosis can also be activated
  by ROS which at the same time can promote the activation of CaMKII with resultant
  mPTP opening. In addition to the plasma membrane damage, RIP3 can advance necroptotic
  cell death under conditions of I/R via mitochondria-associated pathways. Firstly,
  RIP3 can activate PGAM5 dephosphorylating Drp-1 which causes mitochondrial fission.
  Secondly, it activates the protein kinases, such as CaMKII and JNK promoting mPTP
  opening. The induction of mPTP opening is also supported by RIP3-mediated Ca2+ overload
  and activation of XO. As a result of such mPTP opening, further ROS are produced
  thereby indicating a viscous cycle promoting other molecular pro-necroptotic RIP3-linked,
  both canonical and noncanonical, events. (I/R—ischemia/reperfusion, ROS—reactive
  oxygen species, RIP3—receptor-interacting protein kinase 3, mPTP—mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore, MLKL—mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase, PGAM5—phosphoglycerate
  mutase 3, Drp-1—dynamin-related protein 1, JNK—c-Jun N-terminal kinase, BNIP3—Bcl2
  interacting protein 3, ER—endoplasmic reticulum, XO—xanthin oxidase, CaMKII—Ca/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II).
