caption: The metabolic steps involved in the degradation of carbaryl are depicted
  in panel (A). The arrangement of genes on the Supercontig-A involved in the carbaryl
  metabolism is represented in panel (B). The arrow indicates the direction of gene
  transcription, numbers indicate the gene length in bp and the number in parenthesis
  indicate the intergenic distances in bp. mge indicates the genes encoding various
  mobile genetic elements. The details of genes are given in Table 1. The ‘upper’
  pathway gens are marked with pink, ‘middle’ pathway with mango yellow and ‘lower’
  pathway with green color. The probable functional regulators are marked in blue
  color. Regulator genes probably not related to the carbaryl metabolism are marked
  in grey color. ‘RTase’ and ‘endase’ indicates reverse transcriptase and endonuclease,
  respectively. Supercontig-A consist of contigs from the draft genome sequence of
  strain C5pp in the order 83-68-92-62-76-61-76-47. The G1 DNA is mapped on Supercontig-A
  from 17,600 bp to 60,826 bp and is marked by filled arrow head.
