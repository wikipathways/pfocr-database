caption: The cell surface death receptor is activated through an exogenous pathway.
  The cytochrome C of the mitochondria where mitochondria outer membrane permeability
  occurs enters the cytoplasm. The two pathways together activate caspase-3 to cause
  apoptosis. mtRNA can also independently cause apoptosis through the NF-κB pathway
  and the cGAS-STING pathway. When the permeability of mitochondria is increased,
  the mitochondria will be induced to release apoptosis-inducing factors (AIF). AIF
  released into the cytoplasm or nucleus will destroy DNA together with ROS and trigger
  cell apoptosis.
