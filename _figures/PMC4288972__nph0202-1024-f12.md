caption: 'Schematic representation of the proposed regulatory network of Phalaenopsis
  PeSEP genes in the regulation of floral development. Arrows indicate the direction
  of the transcriptional regulatory pathway. The broken lines show that PeSEP2 may
  act as an upstream regulator to initiate PeSEP expression. The combinatory network
  of PeSEPs may coordinately regulate downstream targets, such as MIXTA-like, PeMYBs
  and EREBP-like genes, to promote flower morphogenesis and to inhibit leaf-like characteristics.
  The graphical representation of various organs does not reflect the real growth
  architecture of Phalaenopsis. B-class proteins, PeMADS2–5 and PeMADS6 are referred
  to as AP3 and PI homologs, respectively. Abbreviations: PeM2–PeM6, PeMADS2–6.'
