caption: Apoptotic signaling pathways triggered in CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes
  during T. cruzi infection in mice. Apoptosis can be initiated via two different
  routes including extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, which converge in a caspase activation
  cascade. The most relevant physiological way involved in T. cruzi-induced apoptosis
  of developing CD4+CD8+ DP thymocytes is linked to the systemic rise of glucocorticoid
  (GC) levels secondary to the host's stress response to the infection. This process
  is synergized by an increase in intrathymic production of GC by thymic epithelial
  cells (TECs), conjointly with an increased availability of induced-11 b-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase(11β-HSD)-1. As proved, GC-driven apoptosis is greatly prevented by
  adrenalectomy or by the blockade of GC receptor (GR) with RU486. In addition, GC
  can stimulate the intrinsic pathway either genomically or non-genomically, a process
  that involves proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins
  of the Bcl-2 family are up-and down-regulated respectively, leading to the release
  of cytochrome c, which then forms the apoptosome together with pro-caspase 9 and
  Apaf-1, leading to the activation of caspase 9. This enzyme then activates caspase
  3. During T. cruzi infection, cytochrome c is enhanced, and caspase 9 is activated
  in CD4+CD8+ DP thymocytes. As shown, inhibition of caspase 9 weakens CD4+CD8+ thymocyte
  death. In parallel, increased systemic and intrathymic GC production leads to a
  diminution of GR expression, probably as a negative regulatory loop tending to control
  unnecessary harmful effects upon the gland. Moreover, T. cruzi infection induces
  the synthesis of prolactin (PRL) by TECs, while GC improved the expression of the
  PRL receptor (PRLR) in TECs. Increased PRLR signaling then counterbalances GC-induced
  effects, preventing caspase 3 activation. Extrinsic signals can be initiated by
  cell death ligands (FasL and TNF-α) and involve caspase 8, but these routes seem
  to be non-relevant (NR) during T. cruzi infection, since atrophy takes also place
  in TNFR1+2 double knock-out mice or Fas knock-out animals. Similar results were
  observed in perforin knock-out animals. Since caspase 8 is also active, a possible
  alternative route for its activation may involve cathepsin B, but this route deserves
  confirmation. Yet, it is clear that caspase 8 inhibition reduces thymocyte death
  during T. cruzi infection. Thymocyte apoptosis can also be triggered by trans-sialidase
  (TS), a T. cruzi derived enzyme, and this effect is partially blocked by anti-TS
  antibodies against. Trans-sialidase transfers sialic acid residues between the parasite
  and thymocytes, and probably acts through CD43. The subsequent steps leading to
  apoptosis are unknown. Other pathways described, as caused by intracellular and
  extracellular Gal-3, seems to influence the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
