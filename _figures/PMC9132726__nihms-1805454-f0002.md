caption: Regulation of PKA activity and its compartmentalized localization in the
  cell. A, AC is activated by Gαs-coupled GPCR (such as GPR161), and inhibited by
  Gαi-coupled GPCR (GPR175 or potentially Smo; the mechanism of how Smo activates
  Gαi remains to be determined). AC converts ATP into the 2nd messenger cAMP, which
  binds to PKA-R and dissociates it from PKA-C. Active PKA-C suppresses Hh signaling
  by promoting the formation of Gli repressor. Inactive PKA allows the formation of
  active Gli, resulting in activation of Hh signaling. PDEs hydrolyze cAMP to inhibit
  PKA. B, PKA is sequestered to discrete subcellular compartments by binding to A
  kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). PKA-RII subunit is anchored to the centrosome
  by AKAP9 and AKAP450 (for simplicity, only one subunit is shown). PKA-RI subunit
  is found to be present in the cilium, potentially via binding to the C-terminus
  of GPR161. Some isoforms of PDE4D are anchored to the centrosome via myomegalin
  (Mmg), and degrade local cAMP to attenuate PKA activity.
