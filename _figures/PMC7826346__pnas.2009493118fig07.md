caption: Schematic diagram of the interaction between CXCR4, drebrin, actin, EB1,
  and microtubules during SDF-1–induced neuronal migration. Upon SDF-1 binding to
  CXCR4, the G protein complex is released from the C terminus of CXCR4, exposing
  drebrin binding sites. CXCR4 then binds with this actin-binding protein, which guides
  the insertion of microtubule plus-ends into cortical actin via the microtubule plus-end–binding
  protein EB1. This process then initiates nucleokinesis and subsequently neuronal
  movement. Inhibition of drebrin (via BTP2) prevents SDF-1 signaling via this pathway
  and results in slower cell movement. Pharmacological manipulations used in this
  study are listed in the diagram for reference.
