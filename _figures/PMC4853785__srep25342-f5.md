caption: Treatments with an AMPK activator (resveratrol) and inhibitor (compound C)
  demonstrated that AMPK acts as an important regulator of BP through Rac1-NADPH oxidase
  activity. AMPK decreased blood pressure, abolished the generation of ROS and enhanced
  the activity of the ERK1/2-RSK-nNOS pathway by negatively regulating Racl-induced
  NADPH oxidase levels in the RVLM of rats with oxidative stress–induced hypertension.
