caption: Complex physical and chemical interactions (including cross-feeding and metabolites
  exchange) as well as environmental and host factors govern the development of pathogenic
  bacterial–fungal biofilms, including spatial organization, virulence, and drug protection/resistance.
  These interactions can be cooperative or competitive to mediate symbiotic, antagonistic,
  or synergistic relationships, often modulated by host and environmental factors
  to promote the onset and amplify the severity of the disease. Host diet (dietary
  sugars, particularly sucrose) promote the interactions between C. albicans and S.
  mutans by providing a substrate for EPS α-glucans production by streptococcal Gtfs
  that enhances coadhesion and bacterial–fungal tooth colonization, stimulating cross-kingdom
  biofilms. This interaction enhances the carriage of the cariogenic pathogen and
  acid production, while the presence of C. albicans increases EPS matrix production
  (via Gtf induction and fungal-derived EPS) and biofilm aciduricity, resulting in
  cariogenic conditions on tooth surface. Likewise, the pathogenic impact of C. albicans
  interactions with MGS on mucosal surfaces is also influenced by host factors. The
  interactions of S. oralis with C. albicans on mucosal surfaces cause exacerbated
  inflammatory responses and increased neutrophilic activity. C. albicans increase
  the biomass of S. oralis and this leads to increased mucosal TLR2 expression, activating
  proinflammatory signaling. C. albicans and S. oralis also synergistically increase
  epithelial μ-calpain activity, a proteolytic enzyme that targets E-cadherin from
  epithelial junctions. The bacteria influence fungal physiology by promoting hyphal
  formation via the Efg1 filamentation pathway and expression of secreted aspartyl
  proteases, which further induces proteolytic degradation of E-cadherin, facilitating
  invasion and tissue destruction. Efg1; EPS, exopolysaccharides; Gtf, glucosyltransferase;
  MGS, mitis group streptococci; TLR2.
