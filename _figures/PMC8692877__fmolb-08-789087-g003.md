caption: 'Role of AMPK in IDD. Currently, both destructive effect and protective effect
  of AMPK in IDD have been observed. Through the inhibiting of mTOR, AMPK promotes
  cell apoptosis along with cell senescence, suppresses cell proliferation and retards
  cell cycle progression in IVD cells. In contrast, mechanism for the protection of
  AMPK in IDD is complicated. Through the activation of ACC, AMPK suppresses oxidative
  stress, inflammation and ECM destruction in IVD cells. By modulating mTOR-ULK1 pathway,
  AMPK induces autophagy in IVD cells. SIRT1 is also involved in AMPK-mediated autophagy
  in IVD cells. Through the induction of autophagy, AMPK suppresses intrinsic apoptosis,
  senescence and ECM remodeling in IVD cells. Through the activation of PGC-1α and
  subsequent SIRT3, AMPK promotes mitophagy and inhibits oxidative stress and inflammation
  in IVD cells. By maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, AMPK may protect IVD cells
  against intrinsic apoptosis, senescence and ECM destruction. AMPK: AMP-activated
  protein kinase; IDD: intervertebral disc degeneration; mTOR: mammalian target of
  rapamycin; IVD: intervertebral disc; ACC: acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ECM: extracellular
  matrix; ULK1: UNC-51-like kinase 1; SIRT1: sirtuin1; PGC-1α: peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ coactivator 1α; SIRT3: sirtuin 3.'
