caption: IL-21 promotes the formation and maintenance of germinal centers and plays
  a decisive role in the differentiation of GC-derived B cells into plasma cells.
  The CD40L-CD40 signaling pathway has been shown to work synergistically with IL-21
  to promote Blimp-1 activation and plasma cell differentiation. CD40 signaling enhances
  STAT3-driven Blimp-1 upregulation by reducing Bcl-6 expression. Other co-stimulatory
  signals, such as ICOS-ICOSL and CD28-CD80/86, also promote plasma cell differentiation.
  Subsequently, DSA can injure endothelial cells by activating the complement system
  or through ADCC (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity). In liver transplant
  patients experiencing AMR, hypertrophy of portal vein endothelial cells, obstructive
  portal vein disease, and microvasculitis are commonly observed. The drawing was
  inspired in part by Aldo J. Montano-Loza et al. (183). The figure was created with
