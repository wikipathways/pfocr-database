caption: Relationship between ferroptosis and immunity. IFNγ released by T cells induces
  ferroptosis by activating the JAK-STAT pathway, which regulates the expression of
  SLC7A11. TGFβ released by macrophages promotes ferroptosis by activating SMAD proteins.
  Ferroptotic cells release damage-associated molecular patterns, such as high mobility
  group protein B1 (HMGB1), and 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG), which affect the function
  of immune cells
