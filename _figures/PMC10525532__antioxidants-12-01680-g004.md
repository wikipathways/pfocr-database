caption: 'Trx regulation in TMAO-caused inflammation. TMAO induces the activation
  of FoxO1 in the liver by binding to PERK, an ER stress sensor, which initiates the
  unfolded protein response (UPR). This process not only triggers oxidative stress
  but also contributes to the development of metabolic syndrome. This, in turn, triggers
  the NLRP3 inflammasome through the NF-κB pathway. This activation of NF-κB may stem
  from oxidant release due to ER-mediated stress, leading to the dissociation of TXNIP
  from Trx and subsequent binding and activation of NF-κB. NF-κB then prompts the
  induction of NLRP3, leading to the assembly with ASC and procaspase-1. This leads
  to caspase-1-mediated conversion of pro-IL-1β to the activated form IL-1β and triggering
  the inflammation. TMAO exposure causes oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine
  release in endothelial cells, contributing to metabolic disease. (TMAO: trimethylamine
  N-oxide, PERK: PKR-like eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase, UPR: Unfolded Protein
  Response, NLRP3: NOD-like receptor protein 3, NF-κB: Nuclear Factor-Kappa B, TXNIP:
