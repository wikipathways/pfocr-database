caption: Transduction of stem cell differentiation induced by physical factors. Substrate
  morphology, roughness, and stiffness are sensed by integrins, and activated integrins
  activate FAK and tyrosine kinase Src, transmiting information about physical factors
  to the subsequent RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. Activated RhoA stimulates actin phosphorylation
  and further activates ROCK, thereby increasing the stability of actin polymeric
  filaments. Myosin II, a downstream effector of ROCK, is essential for increasing
  cellular tension and binding sites for adhesion plaque proteins. In addition, Src
  activation primarily regulates actin morphology, and RhoA/ROCK significantly affects
  fiber formation. Ultimately, it affects cell differentiation by regulating cytoskeleton
  formation and actin morphology. Created in BioRender. Xiao, Y. (2024) https://BioRender.com/q28g769
