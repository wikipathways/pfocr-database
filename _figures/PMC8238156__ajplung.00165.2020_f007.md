caption: Schematic diagram depicting the role of G6PD deficiency in vascular remodeling.
  G6PD deficiency in erythrocytes induced increased hemolysis and free hemoglobin
  release. Increased free heme in circulation upregulated oxidative stress and barrier
  dysfunction. Cellular glucose uptake is increased in the G6PD KD lungs. This results
  in increased glycolytic metabolism; however, the inhibition of PGAM redirected glycolysis
  towards a nonoxidative branch of PPP and fatty acid synthesis. Increased MIOX pathway,
  together with decreased GSH production, results in increased ROS/RNS generation.
  Thus, increased hemolysis and oxidative stress collectively contributed to the upregulation
  of proliferative signaling p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, PI3K, and AMPK pathways. This leads
  to vascular proliferation and remodeling. In summary, G6PD deficiency-induced metabolic
  dysfunction, oxidative stress, and vascular proliferation are the causes of PH pathogenesis
  in the G6PD KD model.  was prepared using templates from the image bank of Servier
