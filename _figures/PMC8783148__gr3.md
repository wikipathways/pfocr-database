caption: TCA Cycle Anaplerosis is Promoted by Glucocorticoids. Metabolic flux through
  (A) the glycolytic pathway, tricarboxylic acid pathway, and (B) pentose phosphate
  pathway was analyzed by GC/MS after macrophages were treated for 24 h with vehicle,
  LPS (100 ng/ml), or LPS + Dex (100 nM) and incubated with labeled glucose and glutamine.
  Cells from 7 mice were combined into two replicates. Data were presented as z-scores
  and graphical representation of the pathways.
