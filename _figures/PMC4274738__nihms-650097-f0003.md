caption: 'a) Rab regulatory cycles. Rab-GTPases are regulated by two coupled cycles:
  guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) exchange GDP for GTP to generate the
  active Rab•GTP bound form, whereas GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) generate the
  inactive Rab•GDP bound form. GEFs and GAPs can be highly selective for specific
  Rabs. Rabs are also regulated by extraction from vesicle membranes by cytoplasmic
  GDP dissociation inhibitory (GDIs) proteins that bind non-selectively to Rab•GDP
  forms and sequester them in the cytoplasm. GDIs have a hydrophobic pocket that binds
  the prenylated moiety of Rabs (blue line), which is otherwise inserted into the
  lipid bilayer of a vesicle. Membrane-bound GDI displacement factors (GDFs) extract
  Rab•GDP from complexes with GDIs and re-deliver them to the membrane compartments.b)
  Rab11-mediated junctional transport. Retrieval of membrane proteins into early endosomes
  occurs through endocytosis, which is mediated through Rab5 and Arf6, respectively.
  Cargo from the early endosome can be recycled back to the cell surface by a fast
  (that is, within minutes) Rab4-mediated pathway and a slow (that is, within hours)
  Rab11-mediated process via late recycling endosomes. Early endosomes can also traffic
  cargo via Rab5 to the multivesicular body (MVB; also known as the late endosome
  ) and then via Rab7 to the lysosome. Late recycling endosomes can also acquire cargo
  via Rab11 from the Golgi. Rab11+ late recycling endosomes are delivered to the cell
  surface along actin filaments via MyoV motors, where these vesicles are tethered
  to the plasma membrane by Rab11 binding to the exocyst component Sec15 forming a
  tripartite docking complex. The late recycling endosome are also decorated with
  vesicle SNARE (vSNARE) and the SNARE component SNAP25, which binds to the exocyst.
  Following docking, vSNARE forms a trimeric complex with SNAP25 and the membrane
  tethered tSNARE to initiate fusion of the late recycling endosome with the plasma
  membrane and delivery of cargo.'
