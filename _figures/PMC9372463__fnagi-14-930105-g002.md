caption: Possible mechanisms by which metabolic syndrome (MetS) affects age-related
  hearing loss (ARHL). Mets may cause signal pathway and related factor changes, such
  as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (; ), adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) (), sirtuins (; ; ; ), adiponectin (APN) () and DRP-1 ().
  These changes lead to mitochondrial changes so that can exacerbate ARHL.
