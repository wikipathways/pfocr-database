caption: Outside-in signaling in the bacterial response to surfaces. How is an external
  surface signal transmitted intracellularly to increase levels of cyclic-di-GMP to
  promote biofilm formation? O’Toole and colleagues proposed a signaling pathway which
  requires a cell surface-associated protein, components of the type 4 pilus machinery,
  and a cyclic-di-GMP synthesis enzyme that promote a robust switch to a sessile lifestyle.
