caption: The role of LCAD in vascular cell metabolism and potential effect of LCAD
  hyperacetylation. Hyperacetylation of LCAD contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction,
  increasing inflammation and metabolic switch to glycolysis, which promotes vascular
  dysfunction. Activation of the Sirt3 pathway deacetylates and activates LCAD, improving
  fatty acid β-oxidation and vascular metabolism, which support vascular homeostasis
  and protect from vascular dysfunction. Color images are available online.
