caption: Multiple stressors on the heart disrupt mitochondrial bioenergetic, calcium,
  and ROS homeostasis. If the stressors are not excessive, calcium- and ROS-mediated
  signaling can activate adaptive programs to enable the heart to tolerate and overcome
  the stressors. Excessive stress with major perturbations in bioenergetics, calcium
  and/or ROS leads to programed cell death pathway activation and or amplification
  by mitochondria. It is postulated that the amplitude and rate of onset of the stressors
  play a role in preferential activation of the necrotic and/or apoptotic pathways.
  Necrosis is linked to the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) with
  leaking of the IMM, a more destructive cell death program. In contrast, permeabilization
  of the OMM initiates apoptosis, with the release of apoptogens leading to controlled
  resorption of the cell. Ca2+ = calcium ion. Other abbreviations as in .
