caption: (A) Upstream Hippo pathway serine/threonine kinases control activation of
  LATS1/2 kinases, which in turn directly phosphorylate YAP/TAZ on multiple serine
  residues and thereby controls YAP/TAZ transcriptional activity though regulating
  their subcellular localisation. (B) In the nucleus, YAP/TAZ form transcription complexes
  with various transcription factors to induce expression of cell cycle regulating
  genes. The cell cycle is further modulated by YAP/TAZ through its interaction with
  chromatin-modifying proteins, such as nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase (NuRD)
  complex and histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex, which promote remodelling of
  chromatin configuration to control gene transcription programmes. (C) LATS1/2 kinases
  modulate cell cycle exit during late anaphase or telophase through phosphorylation
  of CDC26 and CTCF. (D) Cyclin-dependent kinases provide an additional level of regulation
  of mitosis through direct phosphorylation of YAP and TAZ.
