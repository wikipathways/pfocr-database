caption: 'Three pathways for ovarian cancer are proposed: Pathway 1 begins in the
  ovary in a majority of cases within Mullerian inclusion cysts (MICs). MICs may form
  when the ovarian surface or other epithelium (such as salpingeal) becomes entrapped
  after ovulation or by surface adhesion. MICs have been the classic explanation for
  the origin of benign serous and mucinous cystadenomas, some of which may progress
  through borderline counterparts, serous borderline or mucinous borderline, into
  carcinomas. Pathway I may apply to some low grade invasive serous carcinomas. Pathway
  II describes the origin of endometrioid and clear cell carcinoma from endometriosis
  derived from transpo1t and implantation of endometrial cells from the uterus. Counterparts
  of each type may occur in the uterine lining. Pathway III involves the origin of
  metastatic (high grade) serous carcinomas and is best characterized in the distal
  fallopian tube [adapted from ].'
