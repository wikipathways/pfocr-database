caption: Mechanisms of redox signalling. Activation of growth factors leads to the
  induction of superoxide anion (O2•–) formation by NOX enzymes, which is subsequently
  converted to H2O2 catalysed by extracellular SOD3. H2O2 enters cells by facilitated
  passive diffusion via aquaporins, which results in a localised intracellular H2O2
  burst. Alternatively, superoxide is generated in mitochondria as a by-product of
  respiratory metabolism and converted to H2O2 by SOD2 in the matrix. The reactivity
  of H2O2 with antioxidant enzymes such as peroxiredoxins (Prx) is several orders
  of magnitude higher than towards the thiol of a ‘normal’ target protein. Therefore,
  several models have been proposed to explain how redox modifications of target proteins
  are possible. The target protein is located in close proximity to the site of H2O2
  formation, enabling close-range direct oxidation (1). In the redox relay model,
  a highly reactive sensor, e.g. Prx, acts as a redox messenger protein, transmitting
  the oxidation to a subsequent target cysteine, which allows longer-range signalling
  (2). The reactivity of H2O2 can be enhanced by interaction with cellular bicarbonate
  (HCO3−) to form the highly reactive peroxymonocarbonate anion (HCO4−), that can
  directly oxidise the target (3).
