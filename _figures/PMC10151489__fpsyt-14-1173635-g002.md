caption: Hypothetical pathways contributing to peripartum depressive readouts. Stress-induced
  activation of the HPA axis could lead to a chain of events involving cortisol release
  and autonomic nervous system (ANS) release of catecholamines. Both HPA and ANS are
  highly coordinated and interconnected with the overall impact on neuroendocrine
  (reduced levels of progesterone, oxytocin, and estrogen), monoamines (norepinephrine,
  serotonin, and dopamine), and neuroinflammation (increased level of inflammatory
  cytokines) at the peripartum period. Long-term stress and reduced progesterone may
  lead to decreased GABAergic signaling, contributing to peripartum sleep disruption
  and anxiety. A high level of stress-induced immune-inflammatory activity could shift
  tryptophan-serotonin-melatonin metabolism to metabolites-driven kynurenine pathway.
  The downregulation of serotonin and melatonin synthesis coupled with the upregulation
  of kynurenic and quinolinic acid contribute to the depressive phenotype. The alterations
  in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway can lead to excessive activation of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate
  receptor, inflammation, oxidative stress responses, and excitotoxicity leading to
  cellular damage, and depressive readouts in postpartum depression. A monoamine-lowering
  process with genetic polymorphism or a dramatic elevation of MAO-A following estrogen
  decline could potentiate stress-induced BDNF reductions increase the risk of neuronal
