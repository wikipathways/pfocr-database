caption: 'Blue arrows indicate the steps directly associated with the synthesis and
  translocation of the [2Fe]H subcluster. The H-cluster CO and CN– ligands, and possibly
  the DTMX bridge, are generated from tyrosine during HydG-catalyzed radical SAM chemistry.
  These adducts are assembled onto a HydG-bound [4Fe–4S] cluster to form HydG-co,
  a [2Fe]H subcluster precursor. HydG transfers this precursor to HydF in a process
  during which HydF-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis may cause a conformational change that
  facilitates the interaction of HydF with HydG and/or HydE in order to acquire HydG-co.
  HydF then inserts the [2Fe]H precursor into the hydrogenase apoprotein, resulting
  in the maturation of active [FeFe] hydrogenase. We hypothesize that by utilizing
  electrons derived from radical SAM chemistry, HydE assists with [2Fe]H precursor
  transfer amongst HydG, HydF, and the hydrogenase apoprotein. Following the transfer
  of HydG-co to HydF, the HydG CTD [4Fe–4S] cluster scaffold is likely reconstituted
  by the host cell ISC machinery. Ball-and-stick representations of the H-cluster
  and its precursors are depicted with the following color scheme: Fe, brown; S, yellow;
  C, gray; O, red; N, blue; unknown atom (X), magenta.'
