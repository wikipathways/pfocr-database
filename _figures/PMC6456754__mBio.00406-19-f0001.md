caption: Core metabolism for growth on methanol with MIDs for key metabolites. (a)
  Methanol is oxidized to formaldehyde, which either enters into the RuMP cycle or
  is further oxidized to CO2. Sugar phosphates with a six-carbon (C6) backbone are
  then converted into sugar phosphates with a three-carbon backbone via either the
  EMP pathway or the ED pathway. Glycogen is synthesized from C6 sugar phosphates.
  Downstream of the PEP and pyruvate node, multiple routes exist for the interconversion
  of C3-C4 compounds. Both pyruvate dehydrogenase and malyl-CoA lyase could contribute
  to de novo AcCoA synthesis. AcCoA enters the TCA cycle to provide precursors for
  biomass synthesis. (b) MIDs of malate and threonine indicate negligible flux through
  fumarase to malate (see  in the supplemental material).
