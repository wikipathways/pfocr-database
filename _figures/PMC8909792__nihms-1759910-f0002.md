caption: After entering the host cell through endocytosis, Rickettsia bacteria undergo
  endolysosome escape and cytoplasmic replication, similar to O. tsutsugamushi. However,
  these bacteria exit from the host cell either by direct transfer to the adjacent
  cell (Spotted Fever Group), focal lysis (Spotted Fever Group), or cell lysis (Typhus
  Group). Host immune recognition is mediated by TLR2/4-regulated mechanisms, which
  activate the MyD88 pathway, or NLRP3/ASC, which activate the inflammasome. Recognition
  of Rickettsia is followed by rapid transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and
  chemokines.
