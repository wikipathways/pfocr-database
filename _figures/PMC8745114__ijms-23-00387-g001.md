caption: 'B cell lineage development and altered B cell populations in ANCA-associated
  vasculitis (AAV). Schematic representation of human B lineage cell differentiation.
  Beige boxes highlight the effects of AAV on the indicated cell populations. The
  extra-follicular pathway of B cell differentiation is not shown for simplicity.
  Transitional B cells migrate into secondary lymphoid organs, where they differentiate
  into innate-like B1, marginal zone B (MZB) cells, or naive B cells. Naive B cells
  enter lymph nodes and become follicular B cells, and it is within the follicle that
  a T-cell dependent response triggers the formation of germinal centers (GCs). During
  the GC reaction, the GC B cell may generate memory B cells (Bmem), plasmablasts,
  or plasma cells (PCs), which reduce the pathogenic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies
  (ANCAs). PCs may be short- or long-lived and home to the bone marrow, whereas Bmem
  egress into the periphery. B regulatory cells (Breg) may arise from almost all B
  cell lineage populations. All the aforementioned B cell populations have been found
  to be dysregulated in AAV, being increased or decreased, as shown by the arrows
  in the beige boxes. Abbreviations: PR3 (proteinase 3), BCR (B cell receptor).'
