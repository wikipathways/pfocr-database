caption: Influence of OdDHL on the immune system. The mammalian T-helper (Th) cell
  response can be subdivided into two distinct arms, Th-1 and Th-2; the development
  of T cells along these distinct lineages is stimulus dependent and results in the
  release of cytokines characteristic of each lineage. (a) bacterial pathogens induce
  a Th-1 response, characterized by the secretion of IL-12 and gamma interferon. This
  developmental pathway results in the generation of activated macrophage populations,
  which are bactericidal and proinflammatory. (b) TNF-α is a key player in the establishment
  of this inflammatory process. It causes neutrophil activation, adhesion and extravasation,
  and the secretion of further inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6 and IL-8).
  Conversely, environmental allergens and helminth parasites induce a Th-1 contrasuppressive
  Th-2 response, characterized by the secretion of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which induce
  a state of immediate hypersensitivity. Given the demarcation of these developmental
  pathways into antibacterial and anthelminthic, it would be of evolutionary advantage
  to bacterial pathogens to suppress the Th-1 response. This would in turn be supportive
  of the Th-2 response. It can be envisaged that OdDHL, by influencing both T-cell
  and macrophage functions at the points indicated in panel a, modulates host inflammatory
  responses to a degree which may promote the growth and survival of the pathogen.
  Compounds with this type of immunological activity could have applications in disease
  states, such as toxic shock syndrome and cerebral malaria, which have a significant
  TNF-α component.
