caption: 'a WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NCC pathway: L-WNK1 or WNK4 binds to the CCT domain of SPAK/OSR1
  and phosphorylates its T-loop kinase domain. SPAK is phosphorylated at Thr233 and
  OSR1 is phosphorylated at Thr185. The scaffold protein MO25 binds to phosphorylated
  SPAK/OSR1, activating it further. The CCT domain of activated SPAK/OSR1 binds to
  the RFTI motif of NCC. The T-loop kinase domain of SPAK/OSR1 phosphorylates NCC
  at three amino acid residues: Thr46, Thr55, and Thr60. This activates NCC, allowing
  the cotransport of NaCl from the tubule lumen. b WNK ubiquitination by the CUL3-KLHL3
  E3 ubiquitin ligase complex: L-WNK1 or WNK4 is bound to the CUL3-KLHL3 E3 ubiquitin
  ligase complex via the C terminus domain of KLHL3. RING-box protein 1 is bound to
  the BTB domain of CUL3 and recruits an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that ubiquitinates
  L-WNK1 or WNK4. This targets WNK1/4 for proteasomal degradation, thereby reducing
  the amount of available L-WNK1 or WNK4.'
