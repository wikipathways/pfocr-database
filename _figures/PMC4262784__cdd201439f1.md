caption: (a) CRISPR loci are included in the prokaryotic chromosome. A variable number
  of repeats are separated by spacer sequences, which derive from previously encountered
  nucleic acids of invasive microorganisms or ancestors. The cas gene, encoding the
  protein component of CRISPR system, flanks this region. Transcription and processing
  of precursor crRNA produces mature crRNAs. The protein product of the cas gene is
  loaded with the crRNA, generating the effector complex. CRISPR pathway activation
  results in DSBs at matching proto-spacer sequences included within invasive DNAs.
  This bacterial immunity response overcomes phage infection or exogenous DNA invasion.
  (b) CRISPR/Cas9-catalyzed cleavage of target genomic DNA in cells. Schematic representation
  of target DNA and chimeric gRNA. The proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) is an NGG
  sequence required for Cas9 recognition. Red triangles indicate cleavage sites. Cas9
  opens the DNA duplex and cleaves both strands upon recognition of a target sequence
  by the gRNA, but only if the correct PAM is present at the 3′ end. (c) Schematic
  representation of CRISPR-based systems in action. Left panel, RNA-guided targeting
  of genes in mammalian cells requires expression of Cas9 protein, modified with a
  nuclear localization sequence, and a gRNA targeting the genomic locus of interest.
  The Cas9–gRNA effector complex identifies the targeting locus and excises the sequence
  from the genome. The central panel describes the CRISPRi system. A defective Cas9
  (*Cas9) lacks endonuclease activity. When coexpressed with a specific gRNA, *Cas9
  recognizes the locus in genomic regulatory regions, specifically interfering with
  transcriptional elongation, RNA polymerase binding or transcription factor binding.
  The CRISPRi system does not alter genomic sequences, but only interferes with regulatory
  elements. The right panel provides an overview of CRISPR imaging. Imaging of genomic
  elements in living cells is possible by gRNA-directed defective EGFP-fused Cas9.
  Sequence-specific enrichment of fluorescence signals can be measured by microscopy
  techniques. CMV, cytomegalovirus promoter; U6, U6-polymerase III promoter
