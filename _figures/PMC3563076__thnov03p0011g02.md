caption: The molecules involved during pancreatic development. The pre-pancreatic
  endoderm receives the Pdx1 inducing signals from the angioblasts (One of the candidate
  signal is Retinoic Acid; RA). And next, Pdx1-expressing pre-pancreas endoderm receives
  the pancreatic maintenance signals sequentially from the notochord, then from the
  endothelial cells. The pancreatic progenitor cells are induced and these cells express
  Pdx1, Sox9 and Ptf1a. All endocrine cells are generated from neurogenin 3 (Neurog3)-
  expressing endocrine progenitor cells, which then differentiate into endocrine cells
  expressing specific set of transcription factors.
