caption: Model for the role of semaphorin-1a and UNC-6 signaling pathways during ray
  1 positioning. SMP-1, SMP-2, and PLX-1 are part of a single pathway that functions
  in parallel to a pathway comprising UNC-6, UNC-40, and UNC-5. SMP-1 and UNC-6 ligands
  send a permissive signal to PLX-1 and UNC-40 receptors, required cell autonomously
  in ray structural cells. In wild-type males, individual ray cell groups form and
  separate on the anterior–posterior axis. This process is dependent on MAB-20–mediated
  signaling (green) (as well as the PLX-2 receptor and other unknown components—see
  ) since ray cell groups tend to cluster with adjacent cell process groups in mab-20
  mutants. This MAB-20/PLX-2–dependent ray separation (green) is normally inhibited
  by the semaphorin-1a and UNC-6 pathways (red). Loss of function in semaphorin-1a
  and UNC-6 signaling pathways results in an effective gain of function of MAB-20–mediated
  signaling in the ray 1 structural cells, which increases separation between ray
  1 and ray 2 cell groups.
