caption: A pathway showing the demethylation effects induced by CaA. Schematic illustration
  of the enzymatic DNA methylation and its modulation by the COMT-mediated metabolic
  O-methylation of CaA. During the COMT-mediated metabolic O-methylation of CaA, there
  was a deficiency of methyl donors (SAM), however, the formation of SAH would be
  markedly increased. It is hypothesized that elevated intracellular levels of SAH
  due to metabolic O-methylation of CaA may exert a strong feedback inhibition of
  DNMT-mediated DNA methylation.

  and in vivo.
