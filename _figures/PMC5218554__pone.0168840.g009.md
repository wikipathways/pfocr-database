caption: 'Wnt signaling is activated by binding of the Wnt3a ligand to its receptor,
  Fz, and to its co-receptor, LRP6. This interaction activates Dvl, which causes the
  dissociation of the destruction complex, which includes Axin, APC, and GSK-3β. This
  dissociation prevents the proteasomal degradation of β-catenin, thereby inducing
  its cytoplasmic accumulation and eventual translocation to the nucleus, where it
  regulates the expression of Wnt target genes. This pathway is known as Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling. However, Wnt can also act through another signaling mediator, GSK-3β,
  which has functions that are independent of β-catenin and thus of Wnt target gene
  transcription []. The activation of Wnt signaling triggers the inhibitory phosphorylation
  of GSK-3β at serine 9 in the cytosol. In our proposed model, the inhibited GSK-3β
  accumulates in mitochondria in response to the activation of Wnt signaling by Wnt3a.
  Mitochondrial p-GSK3β-S9 then interacts with ANT to inhibit the opening of the mPTP.
  This interaction has also been correlated with inhibition of the binding between
  ANT and CypD that is necessary for the conformational shift and opening of the mPTP.
  GSK-3β activity can also control the detachment or translocation of HKII to the
  mitochondria. Activation of Wnt signaling increases mitochondrial HKII, probably
  through the inhibition of GSK-3β activity, thus also favoring the closed conformation
  of the pore. (Fz: Frizzled; Dvl: Dishevelled; APC: adenomatous polyposis coli; GSK-3β:
  glycogen synthase kinase-3β; p-GSK3β-S9: GSK-3β phosphorylated at Ser9; ANT: adenine
  nucleotide translocase; CypD: cyclophilin D; VDAC: voltage-dependent anion channel;
  HKII: hexokinase II).'
