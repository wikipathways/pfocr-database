caption: Working model of RIG-I pathway activation in the tumour microenvironment
  (TME). Activation of RIG-I signalling pathway in the tumour cells leads to type
  I IFN-driven immune response and preferential activation of programmed tumour cell
  death. Both the cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and phagocytic potential
  of macrophages are increased, while the T-regulatory cell differentiation was reduced
  in response to type I IFN-enriched microenvironment. Maturation of DCs will result
  in enhanced CD8+ T-lymphocytes cross-priming in tumour draining lymph nodes. RIG-I,
  retinoic acid induced gene 1; IFN, interferon; NK, natural killer; DC, dendritic
  cell; TME, tumour microenvironment.
