caption: Hedgehog signaling pathway, a morphogenic signaling pathway important in
  embryogenesis, tissue differentiation, cell growth and development. In adults, it
  is upregulated in certain injured tissues and in certain types of cancer. The Sonic
  Hedgehog ligand (i.e., Shh) binds to its receptor, Patched (Ptc), which, in turn,
  derepresses Smoothened (Smo), another transmembrane receptor in a chronically inactive
  state. Activation of Smo drives downstream Hh signaling, causing nuclear accumulation
  of Glioma-associated factors 1, 2, and 3 (Gli1, Gli2, Gli3) and transcription of
  Hh target genes. Illustration by Steve Choi, MD.
