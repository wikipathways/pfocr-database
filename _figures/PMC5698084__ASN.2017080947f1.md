caption: TGF-β receptor signaling is proposed to facilitate successful recovery from
  cellular damage by interacting with the Wnt-β-catenin pathway. Genetic ablation
  of the TGF-β receptor in proximal tubule inhibits normal nuclear localization of
  β-catenin resulting in increased death, cell cycle arrest and expression of fibrotic
  factors.
