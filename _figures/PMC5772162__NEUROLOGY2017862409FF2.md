caption: (A) Progranulin is encoded by the granulin (GRN) gene and contains 7.5 repeats
  of cysteine-rich granulin motifs separated by linker regions and is proteolytically
  cleaved into granulins A–G. The cleavage of progranulin into granulins may be mediated
  by several proteases, including matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs), a disintegrin and
  matrix metalloproteases (ADAMTs), neutrophil serine proteinase 3, and elastases
  released from activated microglia (B). Expression of the GRN gene increases in response
  to cellular stressors such a hypoxia and hypoglycemia. Once synthesized, progranulin
  follows the secretory pathway via dense-core vesicles where it is cotransported
  with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and prosaposin via axonal transport
  and then secreted by exocytosis. In the extracellular space, progranulin may either
  undergo cleavage to granulins or uptake into target cells via binding to sortilin-1.
  Sortilin-1 delivers progranulin via the endosome and multivesicular bodies (MVBs)
  to the lysosome, where progranulin is cleaved and degraded. Progranulin forms heterodimers
  with prosaposin, which promotes progranulin uptake in the lysosome via the mannose-6
  phosphate receptor (M6PR). Progranulin regulates the formation and function of lysosomes,
  in part via the transcription factor EB (TFEB). In response to lysosomal stress,
  TFEB translocates to the nucleus and upregulates severe genes controlling lysosomal
  proteins, including progranulin. Transmembrane lysosomal protein 106B (TMEM106B)
  is located in the endosomes and lysosomes and opposes the effects of progranulin
  on lysosomal function.
