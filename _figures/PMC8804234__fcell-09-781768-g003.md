caption: 'Different types of signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of Clonorchis
  sinensis infection: The interaction between the parasite and its host results in
  the activation of several signaling pathways. The activation of TLR2 and TLR4 in
  macrophages by C. sinensis ESPs leads via ERK1/2 and MyD88, respectively, to the
  activation of NF-κB. The transcription leads to the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α). The activation of the TLR4 of cholangiocytes
  also leads to the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and
  TNF-α) via the MyD88 and NF-κB signaling pathways. Another signaling pathway involves
  the TGF-β1 receptor in hepatic stellate cells. In this signaling pathway, the activation
  of TGF-β1 R by C. sinensis ESPs leads to the activation of Smad2/3 followed by transcription
  with an increase in cell growth and survival. In hepatic stellate cells, the activation
  of TLR4 also leads to the activation of NF-κB and Smad2/3 with an increase in cell
  growth and survival.'
