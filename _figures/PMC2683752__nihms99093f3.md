caption: A schematic diagram of a memory CD4 T cell is shown with surface TCR and
  CD28. TCR engagement triggers sequential signals through CD3, ZAP-70 and SLP-76
  as shown. Two pathways then diverge distal to SLP-76 that couple to IFN-γ gene transcription
  in the nucleus. The Late pathway (right side) requires both TCR and CD28 engagement,
  occurs following sustained activation and is associated with an accumulation of
  MAP kinase and distal phosphorylation and upregulation of T-bet expression. The
  Rapid pathway (left side) does not require CD28 costimulation, and is not associated
  with increased distal phosphorylation or T-bet upregulation. This rapid pathway
  requires NF[kappa]B transcriptional activity.
