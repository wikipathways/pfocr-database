caption: Summary diagram of the proposed mechanisms underlying CA3 hypersensitivity,
  Alzheimer’s disease protein induction, neuronal death and behavioural deficits following
  cerebral ischaemia in rats with LTED. LTED plus stress (cerebral ischaemia) leads
  to hyperinduction of NOX2 NADPH oxidase activity and superoxide elevation, resulting
  in the activation of stress-responsive JNK/cJun signalling pathway in hippocampal
  CA3 neurons. JNK pathway activation induces the gene expression of BACE1 as well
  as amyloid precursor protein (Thr668) phosphorylation, which together promotes amyloid-β
  expression following ischaemic stress. JNK/cJun activation also initiates a positive-feedback
  regulation of NADPH oxidase and superoxide production by inducing NOX2 expression.
  Finally, Tau hyperphosphorylation resulting from JNK activation, together with amyloid-β
  generation and other possible factors induced by JNK/cJun signalling, leads to enhanced
  CA3 neuronal cell death and memory deterioration following cerebral ischaemia in
  rats with LTED. APP = amyloid precursor protein.
