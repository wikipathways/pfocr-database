caption: 'A schematic immunomodulatory activity of GMSCs. GMSCs exert apoptotic effects
  on T-cells via FasL/Fas pathway, and FasL expression and IL-10 secretion by GMSCs
  is enhanced by hypoxia. In response to IFNγ produced by activated T cells, GMSCs
  secrete IDO and IL-10, which inhibit T cells’ proliferation and IFNγ secretion.
  GMSCs elicit M2 polarization of macrophages via secretion of IL-6 and GM-CSF, which
  results in an increased expression of CD206, higher secretion of IL-6 and TGFβ and
  reduced production of TNFα by M2 macrophages. The activation and differentiation
  of dendritic cells is attenuated via PGE2-dependent mechanism, as well as the activation
  and degranulation of mast cells. Additionally, TNFα secreted by mast cells increases
  the production of PGE2 in GMSCs. PGE2 is also responsible for CD8+ T cells’ inhibition
  and Treg and Th17 cells’ stimulation. Abbreviations: IDO—indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase,
  IL-10—interleukin 10, IL-6—interleukin 6, IL-4—interleukin 4, FasL—Fas ligand, GM-CSF—granulocyte-macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor, COX2—cyclooxygenase 2, PGE2—prostaglandin E2, IFNγ—interferon
