caption: Illustration depicting primary signalling mechanisms of different neuronal
  and astrocytic proteins encoded by genes implicated in ID/ASDs. Activation of the
  pre-synapse leads to neurotransmitter release. The neurotransmitter binds to the
  corresponding receptors; these allow the influx of divalent ions that trigger several
  downstream signalling cascades. (1) Activation of group I mGluRs leads to dephosphorylation
  of FMRP by PP2A. This dephosphorylation displaces FMRP from mRNA promoting their
  translation. Simultaneously, PP2A inhibits extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK)-mediated protein synthesis. On a slower time scale, mGluR activation stimulates
  the mTOR pathway, which, consequently, re-phosphorylates FMRP and inhibits mRNA
  translation. (2) NMDAR activation leads to phosphorylation of CaMKII, which in turn
  phosphorylates SYNGAP1and traffics AMPARs to the postsynaptic membrane via ERK.
  (3) SHANK3 is expressed downstream of group I mGluRs and regulates signalling via
  HOMER, which might also regulate NMDAR-mediated signalling. In addition, SHANK3
  interacts with NMDAR via GKAP and PSD95, thereby regulating synaptic plasticity.
  (4) NEUROLIGIN3 interacts directly with NEUREXINS and maintains the stability of
  the excitatory synapse, whereas NEUROLIGIN2 regulates inhibitory synapse function
  via GEPHYRIN and COLLYBISTIN. (5) MeCP2 regulates expression of different plasticity-related
  genes in neurons as well as in astrocytes.
