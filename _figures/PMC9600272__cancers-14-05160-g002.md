caption: 'Schematic diagram of ligand binding activation of the ERBB2 signaling pathway
  leading to drug resistance. Uncontrolled formation of homo- or heterodimers, upon
  ERBB2 activation under physiological conditions, leads to the activation of two
  key downstream signaling pathways (the MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways) and initiation
  of a series of cellular processes such as survival and migration. Mechanism of inhibition
  of the signaling pathway by various novel ERBB2 drugs (left), and the mechanisms
  of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy and immunotherapy due to activating of ERBB signaling
  pathway (right). Abbreviations: CAR-T: chimeric antigen receptor T-cell, CAFs: cancer
  associated fibroblasts, PD-L1: programmed cell death ligand 1, EGF: epidermal growth
