caption: Species difference in Ang II-mediated regulation of proximal tubular Na +
  transport. In humans, Ang II dose-dependently stimulates the NO/cGMP pathway via
  the AT1 receptor over a wide range of concentrations (from low to high). The signalling
  cascade phosphorylates ERK, resulting in the stimulation of proximal tubular Na+
  reabsorption, although the interplay between Ang II and NO signalling pathway on
  the NKA activity is still unconfirmed. In animal proximal tubules (mice, rats, and
  rabbits), a high concentration of Ang II also stimulates the NO/cGMP pathway, but
  the subsequent signalling cascade activates cGKII to exert inhibitory effects on
  Na+ reabsorption. As for NHE3, the inhibitory effect of Ang II is involved in the
  cGMP-dependent protein kinase, which is independent of the NO/cGMP pathway. Ang
  II, angiotensin II; AT1, angiotensin II receptor type 1; NO, nitric oxide; cGMP,
  guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase;
