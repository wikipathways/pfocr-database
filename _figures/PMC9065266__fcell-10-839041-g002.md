caption: Pro-tumoral functions of the inflammasome pathway. (A) The inflammasome,
  primarily NLRP3, promotes tumor cell survival, proliferation and invasion through
  IL-1β. Inflammasome-independent functions of AIM2 have also been demonstrated, in
  which AIM2 controls mitochondrial dynamics and activate oncogenic ERK activation
  through reactive oxygen species (ROS). (B) The inflammasome can promote tumorigenesis
  through induction of a chronic inflammatory states. In the intestine, both IL-18
  and IL-1β converge on IL-22 production which drives intestinal epithelial cell hyperproliferation.
  The chronic inflammatory state is also enacted by IL-17 production which recruits
  granulocytes to amplify the response. In the liver, hepatic injury is associated
  with AIM2 inflammasome activation both in Kupffer cells and in macrophages of the
  ascitic fluid. IL-1β in this case promotes hepatocytes hyper-proliferation. In the
  skin, germ-line mutations in NLRP1 result in chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis.
  (C) The inflammasomes can indirectly favor tumor development by suppressing anti-tumor
  immunity. IL-1β was shown to enhance myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) recruitment
  to the tumor site and to promote T cell tolerogenic differentiation.
