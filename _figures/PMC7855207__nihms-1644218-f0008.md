caption: The pathway for biosynthesis of ceramides is shown with individual ceramide
  classes indicated as a schematic within yellow rectangles along with their relative
  abundance in controls (blue circle) and the patient (red circle). The whiskers represent
  minimum and maximum values observed for controls. Left and right ends of the box
  indicate the first and third quartiles of the abundance in controls, respectively,
  while the vertical line inside the box represents the mean abundance. The enzyme
  galactosyl transferase catalyzes transfer of hexose (green squares) to produce trihexosylceramide
  from dihexosylceramide and N-acetylhexosaminyl transferase synthesizes N-acetylhexosaminyl-trihexosylceramide
  by transferring N-acetylhexosamine (orange square) to trihexosylceramide.
