caption: The oxidative damage occurs via the reduction of the N → O group of MEQ,
  which activate the MAPKs (e.g. P38 and JNK) signaling pathway, as well as Nrf2-Keap1
  family, NF-κB and II phase detoxifying enzymes (e.g. HO-1, GCLC and NQO1). The sex
  difference in oxidative stress and genetoxicity caused by MEQ and N1-MEQ, respectively,
  may be derived from the adrenal toxicity along with the sex hormone secretion disorder.
