caption: 'Schematic of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway. (A) Antigen engagement
  initiates receptor clustering and facilitates Lyn-medated phosphorylation of tyrosines
  within CD79 and CD19. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the SFK Lck mediates phosphorylation
  of CD79. (B) Syk binds to phospho-tyrosine residues within the ITAM of CD79 and
  is activated. Adaptor proteins such as BLNK, LAB, NCK, BCAP and Grb2 associate with
  phospho-tyrosines outside the ITAM on CD79. Proteins such as BLNK and BCAP are substrates
  of Syk. (C) Phospho-tyrosine residues within BCAP and CD19 attract the regulatory
  subunit of PI3Kδ leading to the activation of catalytic p110. PI(4,5)P2 is converted
  to PI(3,4,5)P3 which attracts PH domain containing proteins such as BTK, PLCγ2,
  Akt and Vav to the plasma membrane. (D) Phospho-tyrosine residues within BLNK act
  as a scaffold for membrane-associated BTK and PLCγ2, facilitating activation of
  the former to phosphorate and activate the latter. This catalyzes distal signaling
  pathway activation leading to NF-κB, JNK and ERK activation. (E) Further distal
  signals include activation of Vav leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement, and of
  Akt leading to activation of mTORC1 and inhibition of FoxO.CLL: Chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia; DLBCL: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; FL: Follicular lymphoma; ITAM: Immuno-receptor
  tyrosine-based activation motifs; MCL: Mantle cell lymphoma.'
