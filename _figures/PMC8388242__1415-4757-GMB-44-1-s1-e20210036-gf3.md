caption: 'Predicted HLA involvement in T cell, B cell, and NK cell responses to SARS-CoV-2
  infection. Left: T and B cells are central to adaptive immunity, whose effectivity
  is influenced by the individual’s HLA genotype. (1a) Dendritic cells (DC) present
  viral peptides bound to HLA Ia and HLA II to, respectively, CD8+ and CD4+ T cell
  clones displaying specific TCR. (1b) The effector cytotoxic CD8+ T cell recognizes
  the infected target cell by interaction of its specific receptor (TCR) with HLA
  Ia/peptide on the target and lyses the infected cell. (2a) B cells bind viral antigens
  through specific membrane immunoglobulin receptors (BCR). The internalized antigens
  go through the class II pathway and HLA II plus viral peptide displayed at the B
  cell membrane are recognized by the previously primed helper CD4+ T cell to activate
  the B cells. (2b) The activated B cells differentiate in antibody-secreting plasma
  cells. The neutralizing specific antibodies bind to the virus’s antigen, blocking
  the viral entry into the cell. Other types of antibodies (not shown) may bind to
  viral antigens at the surface of infected cells to recruit NK cells or trigger the
  complement cascade. Besides, all the cell-cell interactions indicated in this schematic
  view depend on signals by accessory membrane molecules (not shown) and soluble factors
  such as interferons and specific sets of cytokines. Right: The natural killer cells
  (NKc) are important players in innate immunity. NKc repertoires differ among individuals
  due to the high polymorphism ofKIRandHLAclass I, resulting in differential susceptibility
  to infection and disease. (3a) Each individual has numerous NK cell clones that
  differ for the number and types of inhibitory and activating KIR receptors. (3b)
  During NKc development, the high-affinity binding of inhibitory KIRs (iKIR) with
  HLA class I (HLA I) enhances the functions of NKc through a process known as licensing.
  The strength of the interactions depends on the individual’s HLA and KIR genotype
  and dictates the efficiency of mature NK effector function. (4a) The KIR/HLA I interaction
  inhibits apoptosis of the infected cells even in the presence of activating interactions,
  especially of NKc licensed by strong interactions; (4b) signaling by the activating
  receptor/ligand leads to apoptosis of the infected target cell when HLA I is absent;
  (4c) strong activating signals may overcome the iKIR/HLA I interaction especially
  if this interaction is weak, resulting in apoptosis of the target. Moreover, in
  severe COVID-19, NKc often are reduced in number and dysregulated. Figure created
