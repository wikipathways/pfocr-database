caption: Intracellular pathways to canalicular and basolateral plasma membranes. Basolateral
  membrane proteins, including the LDL receptor, ASGP and other receptors, and NTCP,
  the bile acid transporter, traffic directly to the basolateral domain from which
  they are endocytosed and returned to the plasma membrane. The role of specific endosomal
  and subapical compartments in transcytosis is uncertain. Canalicular monotopic GPI-terminated
  proteins, mainly ectoenzymes (5NT, Aminopeptidase, CECAM105 etc) traffic from the
  TGN to the basolateral domain from which they undergo transcytosis through the recycling
  endosome (ARE) pool to the canalicular domain. In contrast, canalicular polytopic
  transporters ATP binding cassette proteins, such as ABCB1, ABCB11, ABCC2, and ABCB4,
  traffic from the TGN to the canalicular membrane either directly or via the large
  apical recycling endosomal (ARE) compartment from which they endogenously cycle
  to and from the canalicular membrane, or delivered into the degradation pathway
  to lysosomes. Segregation of apical and basolateral cargo proteins is thought to
  occur at the TGN although additional intracellular sorting sites have been proposed.
