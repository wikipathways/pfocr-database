caption: Stabilization, degradation, and activation of the Ci/Gli proteins by the
  Hh signaling pathway. (A) In Drosophila, the absence of Hh allows Ptc to inhibit
  Smo activity, and full-length Ci (Ci) activity is regulated by three different mechanisms,
  including phosphorylation, proteolysis, and stabilization. First, phosphorylation
  of Ci by multiple kinases, including PKA, targets Ci to the ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated
  partial proteolysis to generate a truncated repressor form of Ci (Ci-R). This step
  requires the kinesin-like protein Cos2, which acts as a molecular scaffold to bridge
  Ci and the kinases. Second, the activity of full-length Ci is also blocked by stoichiometric
  binding of Sufu, but is protected from Hib-dependent degradation. Third, the excess
  of Ci is controlled by Hib protein, which binds and completely degrades the full-lengh
  form of Ci. (B) Binding of Hh to Ptc stimulates Smo phosphorylation, which increases
  Smo cell surface concentration. The activation of Smo stimulates the associated
  Fu kinase activity and dissociates Ci from the Cos2 complex. This blocks PKA phosphorylation
  of Ci and subsequent processing. The Fu/Cos2 complex is also necessary to form the
  active Ci (Ci-A), but the mechanism of this activation, as its regulation by Sufu,
  is uncertain. (C) In mammals, in the absence of Hh, Ptc is present in the primary
  cilium and prevents Smo ciliary accumulation. PKA and others kinases phosphorylate
  Gli and target it for partial degradation to form the truncated repressor form of
  Gli (Gli-R). It is possible that the scaffolding role of Cos2 in Drosophila might
  have been replaced by the primary cilia. Independently of cilia, in the cytoplasm,
  the activity of full-length Gli is further blocked by Sufu, which appears to be
  the major mechanism for restricting Gli activity in mammals. In addition, Sufu protects
  Gli2 and Gli3 (but not Gli1) from degradation by Spop, the Hib mammalian homolog.
  (D) Binding of Hh to Ptc promotes the accumulation and activation of Smo in the
  cilium. Gli phosphorylation and processing are inhibited, and formation of the transcriptionally
  activated Gli (Gli-A) is triggered. This activation occurs in the cilia, but can
  also take place when both primary cilia and Sufu are lacking. The mechanism of Gli
  activation and Sufu regulation by Shh are not known. In both Drosophila and mammals,
  Sufu likely plays an important role in the nucleus, not indicated here.
