caption: Signaling functions of SIRT3 relevant to cancer metabolism reprogramming.
  (A) SIRT3 regulates cancer metabolism reprogramming by modulating ROS levels. As
  a tumor-suppressing protein, SIRT3 could deacetylate and modulate the activity of
  a series of enzymes and transcription factors such as SOD2, MnSOD, FOXO3α, IDH2,
  SDH, and xCT to decrease the ROS levels and regulate tumor metabolism reprogramming.
  As a tumor-promoting protein, SIRT3 could regulate the NOS1/SIRT3/SOD2 pathway or
  mitochondrial autophagy to keep ROS at an appropriate level to promote tumorigenesis
  and prevent apoptosis. (B) SIRT3 regulates cancer metabolism reprogramming by modulating
  tumor cell glycolysis. As a tumor-suppressing protein, SIRT3 not only deacetylates
  and regulates the activity of various enzymes and proteins including HIF-1α, PHD,
  PDHA1, GOT2, CypD, IRP1, and PGC-1α, but also affects some signaling pathways such
  as HIF-1α/PDK1/PDHA, PTEN/MDM2/p53 pathway, CypD/HK II pathway, IRP1/TfR1 pathway,
  and PD-L1/ITGβ4/SNAI1 pathway, thereby inhibiting glycolysis and regulating tumor
  metabolism reprogramming. As a tumor-promoting protein, SIRT3 could deacetylate
  and activate ACC1, LDHA, GDH, and HFDs to promote glycolysis and increase the occurrence
  of cancer.
