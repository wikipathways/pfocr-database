caption: HHT occurs due to LOF mutations in ENG, ALK1, SMAD4, and, more rarely, BMP9
  (respective proteins indicated with red asterisks), which are all in the same signaling
  pathway. On endothelial cells, BMP9 or BMP10 recruits a heterocomplex composed of
  two type II receptors (BMPRII or ActRIIA, which are the main type II receptors expressed
  on ECs, and two similar type I receptors (ALK1), and the coreceptor ENG (endoglin).
  Upon BMP binding, the type II receptor phosphorylates ALK1, which subsequently phosphorylates
  the transcription factors SMAD1/5. SMAD1/5 bind SMAD4, which is shared with the
  TGF-β pathway, to regulate transcription of many genes (in association with other
  transcription factors). BMP9 and BMP10 maintain vascular quiescence (middle panel)
  via repression of angiogenesis pathways (right panel). VEGF-A (red) binds to VEGFR2,
  which activates the ERK1/2 and P38 MAPK pathways and the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway.
  In turn, the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway activates the signaling cascade P70S6K/S6.
  VEGF can also activate the calcineurin phosphatase, which activates, via dephosphorylation,
  the NFAT transcription factor family. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is negatively regulated
  by the phosphatase PTEN, which is active when unphosphorylated. VEGF-A can also
  bind to VEGFR1, but this will not generate a signal. Two other members of the VEGF
  family, VEGF-B (yellow) and PlGF (blue), also bind to VEGFR1. BMP9 induces the expression
  of VEGFR1, thus inhibiting VEGF signaling. BMP9 also induces PTEN expression and
  phosphorylation, which inhibit AKT activity as well as the expression of SGK1 kinase,
  which can activate the mTORC1/P70S6K/S6 pathway. Moreover, BMP9 inhibits ERK activation
  and CDK4/6 kinases through not-yet-characterized mechanisms. Ang1 activates the
  TIE2 receptor to maintain vascular quiescence, and this pathway can be antagonized
  by Ang2
