  Intermediate metabolites are shown in brackets, while putative or not structurally
  confirmed metabolites are shown in a dotted frame. Metabolites that were only detected
  in mice are shaded in blue. Major metabolic pathways are marked with bold arrows,
  while proposed enzymes catalyzing these reactions are indicated next to the arrows.
