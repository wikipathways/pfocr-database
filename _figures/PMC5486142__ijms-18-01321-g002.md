caption: 'Schematic representation of adiponectin signal transduction implicating
  a cross talk with the insulin signaling pathway: Insulin and adiponectin interact
  with their respective receptors, which trigger a cascade of signaling events. Metabolic
  actions of the insulin are mainly carried out by PI3K/AKT pathway, resulting in
  increased protein synthesis, lipogenesis, glucose uptake and utilization, glycogen
  synthesis, and reduced lipolysis and gluconeogenesis. Interaction of adiponectin
  with its receptors (Adipo R1 and R2) results in the activation of multiple signaling
  pathways including IRS1/2, AMPK, and p38 MAPK. Activation of IRS1/2 by adiponectin
  signaling is a major mechanism by which adiponectin sensitizes insulin action in
  insulin responsive tissues.'
