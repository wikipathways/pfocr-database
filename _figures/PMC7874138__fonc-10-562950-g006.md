caption: Regulation of breast cancer by SIRT4. Under the condition of high glucose
  levels, CtBP dimerization helps CtBP to promote glutamine metabolism by inhibiting
  SIRT4 expression. This action can help maintain the pH homeostasis of cells, promote
  the growth of breast-cancer cells and inhibit their apoptosis. SIRT4 enhances the
  sensitivity of ER-positive breast cancer cells to tamoxifen by inhibiting glutamine
  metabolism and the IL-6-STAT3 signaling pathway.
