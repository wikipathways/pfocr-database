caption: 'Tumor microenvironment (TME) in esophageal cancer: tumor cells evade host
  immunity via a series of cell-extrinsic factors that comprise the TME. Immune checkpoint
  inhibitors (ICIs) are designed to reverse the TME of immunosuppressive effects,
  thereby enhancing patients’ immune responses against tumors. As shown in the left
  section, CD8+ T cell, CD45RO+ T cell, and NK cell contribute to the antitumor immune
  response. However, some subsets of cells with negative immunomodulatory function
  play crucial roles in suppressing antitumor effects. Regulatory T cells (Tregs)
  have been shown to dampen the activity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).
  Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)
  also boost the immune evasion of tumor cells. Some tumor cell–intrinsic factors
  (e.g., PD-L1 expression, tumor mutation load, and MSI-high status) account for the
  cancer resistance to ICIs. The expression of ICI such as TIGIT and PD-1 may be associated
  with the exhaustion of TILs. Induced frequency of NK cells in EC is ascribed to
  TNF-α, which is able to induce the expression of TIM-3 via the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  The right section depicts the novel ICIs strategies targeting LAG-3, TIM-3, and
  TIGIT, which aim to reverse the exhaustion or dysfunction states of T cells.'
