caption: JA biosynthetic pathway and its involvement in orchestrating plant direct
  defense response. The expression fold change in LOX and OPR between Qingliu and
  TN1 at 0, 6, 24, and 72 h of insect herbivory is shown by square boxes from left
  to right accordingly. Red boxes denote upregulation with a 1.5-fold change, while
  green boxes denote downregulation with a 0.67-fold change. Chloroplasts, peroxisomes
  and cytoplasm are represented by green, orange and blue compartments, respectively.
  PLD = phospholipase, LOX = lipoxygenase, AOS = allene oxide synthase, AOC = allene
  oxide cyclase, OPDA = 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, OPR = 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase,
  JAR = acyl adenylate-forming enzyme, JA-Ile=conjugated jasmonyl-isoleucine.
