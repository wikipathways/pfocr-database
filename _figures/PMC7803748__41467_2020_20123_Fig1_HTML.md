caption: Upon receptor activation, IRS1 promotes phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5 triphosphates
  (PIP3,4,5) generation on the plasma membrane by recruiting the kinase PI3K. Plakoglobin
  helps the PI3K association to IR. The lipid signal on the plasma membrane promotes
  AKT recruitment and activation operated by PDK1 and mTORC2 complex. Then AKT positively
  or negatively modulates a plethora of targets including the mTORC1 complex for protein
  synthesis, ACL for ATP production, and FoxO for protein degradation. mTORC1 complex
  is another hub that affects many different biological processes, including autophagy.
  In fact, mTORC1 phosphorylates and inhibits ULK1. The pathway has several feedbacks
  that modulate its activity. For instance, activation of mTORC1 blocks IRS1 via S6K1
  and consequently, inhibits AKT. AMPK, whose activity is increased by energy stress,
  is another important modulator of the pathway because blocks mTORC1 and activate
  FoxO and the autophagy system. Dotted lines depict pathways whose molecular mechanisms
  and role in adult skeletal muscle have yet to be completely defined.
