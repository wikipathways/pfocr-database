caption: 'Reappraisal of Mitochondrial Metabolism. a Current Model of The TCA cycle:
  The current model of TCA cycle supports the hypotheses that oxidation reactions
  take place only in the mitochondria, and that the glutamine metabolism (highlighted
  in the orange colour) by the glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD) and the glutamate pyruvate
  amino transferase converge on 2-OG to replenish the oxidative potential of the TCA
  cycle to increase the production of ATP. The discovery of two mitochondrial pyruvate
  carrier proteins (MPC1& MPC2), and the subsequent knock out experiments suggest
  that pyruvate entry through MPC1 into mitochondria promotes reductive carboxylation
  and succinate oxidation for de novo fatty acid synthesis for mitotic citrate synthesis
  (see the Fig. ). b Nutrient Oxidations Produce Two Types of Cofactors the NADH and
  FADH2, which Partition the Hydrogens Between the Production of ATP and NADPH: Nutrient
  oxidations by dehydrogenases produce two types of reduced cofactors, the NADH and
  FADH2, which perform dual functions, production of ATP, and preserving the inner
  mitochondrial membrane (IMM) potential. Inhibition NADH production by complex I
  by the Complex II activates biosynthesis of NADPH to regenerate NAD+ and maintain
  the redox homeostasis (the inset box) and conserve the nutrient hydrogens for reduction
  reactions of the biosynthesis pathway. The nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase
  (NNT) activates the transhydrogenation of NADH to NADPH. NAD+ activates the deacetylases,
  and the transcription factors, which regulate the gene transcription and metabolism.
  FADH2 as the component of respiratory super complex supports ATP synthesis, but
  maintains the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) potential (Δψm) in an uncoupled
  state, which supports the recycling of Pi between the ADP and ATP. Several FADH2
  dependent dehydrogenases, in the cytoplasm, in addition to the mitochondria SDH,
  inhibit NADH production by complex I by activating the Q-Cycle (see the Table)'
