caption: 'Molecular activity of platelet-regulated T cell immune response in acquired
  aplastic anemia (AA). AA may be due to an unknown pathogen infecting hematopoietic
  stem cells (HSCs) or peripheral cells, leading to the presentation of pathogen particles
  and either unmodified or chemically/genetically modified components on their cell
  surfaces. These antigens are then presented to antigen-presenting cells (APCs),
  which process and present them to CD4+ T cells. Platelets play a role in this immune
  regulation by releasing various soluble mediators, such as PF4/CXCL4, TGFβ, PAF,
  TXA2, NAP, and RANTES. PF4 binds to CD4+ or CD8+ T cell/CTL membrane receptors CXCR3
  and CXCR5, activating the downstream mitochondrial energy metabolism signaling pathway
  (Akt-PGC1α-TFAM). This affects mitochondrial quantity, ATP production, and reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), thereby regulating the T cell immune response. For CD4+ T
  cells: ① Differentiation into Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th22 phenotypes. ② Simultaneous
  differentiation into Th17 phenotypes under the stimulation of IL-23 and IL-12. ③
  Suppression of Treg phenotypes, leading to weakened immune regulation and immune
  imbalance. For CD8+ T cells: ① Direct cytotoxicity through the release of granzyme
  B (GzmB) and perforin (PFN). ② Paracrine effects via TNFα, IFNγ, and Fas ligand
  (Fas-L). In summary, platelets regulate the immune responses of CD4+ and CD8+ T
  cells through mitochondrial energy metabolism, contributing to immune imbalance
  and increased levels of IFNγ and TNFα. This results in the attack on HSPCs and may
  ultimately lead to bone marrow failure'
