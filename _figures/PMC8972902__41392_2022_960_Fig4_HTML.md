caption: Spatial transcriptomics provide new insights for understanding molecular
  mechanisms of human diseases and preclinical disease models. a In neurodegenerative
  disease models, Trem2 and Tyrobp form a receptor complex that can trigger phagocytosis
  or regulate cytokine signaling, when bound by membrane lipids or lipoprotein complexes.
  Tyrobp expression is up-regulated before symptoms and before Trem2 expression in
  the ventral horn and white matter. Lp1 and B2m are up-regulated before symptoms,
  especially in the ventral horn. Apoe and Cx3cr1 are up-regulated in the spinal cord
  of symptomatic mice. Apoe expression is driven by Trem2 signal and the ligand of
  Trem2. b In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) models, expression of GRM3 gene
  in the prefrontal lobe and motor cortex was lower in C9orf72 repeat expansion, mutant
  SOD1, and sALS. The GRM3 gene encodes mGlu3, a metabotropic glutamate receptor,
  regulates the neurotransmission of glutamate in the central nervous system. The
  expression of neuronal mGlu3 receptor is mainly at presynaptic terminals. When the
  extrasynaptic glutamate overflows excessively, the G protein signaling cascade is
  activated to regulate the activity of presynaptic ion channels, followed by negatively
  regulating the release of presynaptic glutamate. The regulation that the decrease
  of mGlu3 receptor expression in the prefrontal cortex increases the transmission
  of glutamate and produces excitotoxicity may be a common mechanism feature between
  schizophrenia and ALS. c Spatial positions of different subgroups are identified
  and mapped within cell type in the entire tissue by integrating scRNA-seq and MIA.
  A total of four ductal subgroups are identified, including ductal population, terminal
  ductal population, centroacinar duct population, and antigen-presenting duct cells,
  respectively expressing APOL1, ERO1A and CA9 genes; TFF1, TFF2 and TFF3; CRISP3
  genes; CD74, HLA -DPA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DRB5, and C1S, C4A,
  C4B, CFB and CFH genes. d The combined application of spatial transcriptomics, scRNA-seq,
  and MIBI demonstrates that TSK cells and basal tumor cells are located on the leading
  edge. Fibroblasts, macrophages and Tregs are most abundant at the tumor-stroma boundary,
  while CD8 T cells and neutrophils are largely excluded from the tumor, indicating
  that the localization of Tregs may prevent effector lymphocytes into the tumor.
  e The gene expression in 3 regions obtained by factor analysis is applied for identifying
  region-specific markers in normal, cancer and PIN region. Enrichment of SPINK1 and
  PGC, the depletion of ACPP, and the increase of NPY level in the PIN area are observed
  in cancer areas. In addition, the interaction between factors was determined by
  hierarchical clustering of ten factors. These ten factors include normal glands
  signature, normal glands, stroma, inflammation, PIN, cancer, immune profile, proximity
  to PIN signature, and mix of prostatic atrophy and stroma et al. f In malignant
  melanoma models, PMEL and SPP1 overexpressed in tumor cell clusters, and the lymphoid
  tissue regions from and adjacent to tumor cell regions were characterized by the
  expression of immune-related genes CD74 and IGLL5, respectively. FTL, B2M, APOE
  and HLA-related genes (HLA A-C) express in the transition zone and related to tumor
  growth regulation through the GADD45/JNK pathway
