caption: During infection or injury, HMGB1, a critical mediator in the final common
  pathway of inflammation, is actively secreted or passively released outside of the
  cells. Haptoglobin binds HMGB1 and inhibits its toxicity; and haptoglobin β subunit
  alone is sufficient to recapitulate the effects of the full-length haptoglobin.
  HMGB1-haptoglobin β complexes act via CD163 and elicit an anti-inflammatory response
  by stimulating HO-1 expression and IL-10 release; and by inhibiting pro-inflammatory
  cytokine release. Thus, haptoglobin β acts as an endogenous inhibitor of HMGB1 via
  a novel CD163-dependent anti-inflammatory pathway.
