caption: Agonist receptor activation by the bacterial products fMLP or LPS initiates
  signaling cascades that promote the exchange of GDP for GTP in the small GTPase
  Rap1. Rap1-GTP interacts with its effector RIAM, which in turns interacts with talin
  recruiting this protein to the proximity of the αMβ2 integrin. Talin head binding
  to the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin β2 chain triggers structural changes in
  αMβ2 integrin that lead to an increased affinity for its ligand, the iC3b complement
  fragment that coats phagocytic preys. Pharmacologic activation of Rap1 by treatment
  with 8CPT, an AMPc analogue that binds directly to EPAC, recapitulates these biochemical
  events.
