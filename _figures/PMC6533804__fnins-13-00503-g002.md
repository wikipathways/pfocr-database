caption: Mechanism of progesterone actions. Progesterone exerts its effects on its
  target cells through two central pathways, namely the classical and non-classical
  ones. In the classical pathway, progesterone binds to its intracellular receptor
  (PR), activating such a transcription factor which dimerizes and translocates to
  the nucleus. There, it binds to specific DNA sequences, called progesterone response
  elements (PRE), which are mainly located in the gene promoter regions, thus regulating
  their expression. In contrast, the non-classical pathway involves the PR ligand-independent
  activation by membrane-associated kinases and the activation of multiple G protein-coupled
  membrane receptors of progesterone (mPRs), which in turn activates pathways related
  to cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C (PKC),
  PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK. Furthermore, the non-classical action of progesterone includes
  the modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors following its
  conversion into allopregnanolone.
