caption: Subnetworks of special pathogenic pathways corresponded to different metastasis
  lesions. The key pathogenic pathways in single metastases were RUNX1 regulating
  genes involved in megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet function signaling
  (A), Nuclear signaling by ERBB4 (B) and GRB2/SHC events in ERBB2 signaling (C);
  The key pathogenic pathways in multiple metastases were SMAD2/SMAD3:SMAD4 heterotrimer
  regulating transcription (D) and RUNX3 regulating WNT signaling (E); The key pathogenic
  pathway in diffused metastases was Cargo recognition for clathrin‐mediated endocytosis
  (F). All correlations between genes and cell phenotypes (such as proliferation,
  migration, inflammatory response, and so on) were determined using Gene Ontology
papertitle: Effects of somatic alterations at pathway level are more mechanism‐explanatory
  and clinically applicable to quantity of liver metastases of colorectal cancer.
