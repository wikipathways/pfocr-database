caption: Proposed model of MS disease pathogenesis. (a) During primary EBV infection,
  a reservoir of EBV‐infected MBCs is established in lymphoid tissue, particularly
  in the oro‐pharynx. Reactivation of latent EBV infection in MBCs responding to oropharyngeal
  infections leads to lytic EBV infection, which induces an EBV‐specific CD8+ T‐cell
  and antibody response by circulating T cells and B cells expressing high affinity
  BCRs. Active EBV infection in MBCs during primary EBV infection, and possibly during
  subsequent reactivations of infection, induces LPAM‐1 expression on EBV‐infected
  MBCs and their migration to GALT. (b) Episodic reactivation of latent EBV infection
  in MBCs residing in GALT by gut microbes via BCRs and/or pathogen recognition receptors
  and/or SCFAs leads to lytic EBV infection, which induces a compartmentalised EBV‐specific
  immune response. This response includes MZB2 cells, some of which may also become
  infected by EBV. Low‐affinity BCRs on MZB2 cells promote an antibody response against
  EBV proteins, such as EBNA‐1, that is polyreactive and cross‐reacts with CNS autoantigens,
  such as GlialCAM. CD4+ T cells are activated by MBZ2 cells via HLA‐DRB1 and ‘autoproliferate’,
  including in blood, as well as migrate to the CNS. These CD4+ T cells produce IFN‐γ,
  which facilitates a CD11c+/T‐bet+ MBC differentiation pathway amongst both EBV‐infected
  and ‐uninfected EBV/autoantigen‐specific MZB2 cells. Gut microbiota‐specific IgA+
  B cells and/or plasma cells are also produced in GALT and migrate to the CNS. In
  addition, IgA+ cMBCs and T‐bet+ MBCs accumulate in blood, possibly as a result of
  repeated EBV reactivation in GALT, and may generate EBV‐specific IgA antibody responses
  that interfere with EBV‐specific IgG antibody responses. The major genetic and environmental
  factors associated with an increased risk of developing MS affect these processes
  in GALT. (c) Both EBV‐infected and ‐uninfected EBV protein/CNS autoantigen‐specific
  CD11c+/T‐bet+ IgG+ MBCs migrate to the meningeal immune system within the dura,
  and subsequently to the CNS, facilitated by cell‐surface expression of CXCR3. At
  sites of inflammation in the CNS, these B cells mediate a B‐cell/antibody response
  against EBV proteins (e.g. EBNA‐1) and CNS autoantigens (e.g. GlialCAM). This drives
  an autoantigen‐specific CD8+ T‐cell response by CD11c+/T‐bet+ IgG+ MBCs acting as
  APCs themselves and/or by generating production of IgG antibodies that form immune
  complexes with autoantigens and deliver them to cDCs, which cross‐present antigens
  to, and activate, CD8+ T cells. Autoantigen‐specific CD8+ T cells mediate a cytotoxic
  cellular immune response against antigens of myelin and/or glial cells. These activities
  are augmented by BAFF produced by EBV‐infected CD11c+/T‐bet+ MBCs or cMBCs or both.
  Gut microbe‐specific IgA+ plasma cells may modulate CD8+ T‐cell activation via IL‐10.
