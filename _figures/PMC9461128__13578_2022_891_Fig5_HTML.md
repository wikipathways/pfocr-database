caption: 'Possible sites and targets that can be potentially exploited to modulate
  AP-2β activities and/or levels. One proposal for modulating AP-2β is through protein–protein
  interactions whereby co-activators/suppressors bind to the transactivation domain
  and modify AP-2β transcription activity and DNA-binding activities, as indicated
  within the yellow square. Inducing degradation of AP-2β could be achieved through
  designing peptide inhibitors binding selectively to its transactivation domain to
  form a non-functional complex or by enhancing PKD phosphorylation of AP-2β [] or
  by developing specific monoclonal antibodies that can bind and inactivate AP-2β.
  By contrast, enhancing AP-2β activity could be feasible by designing artificial
  transcription factor analogues (TFA) that can act as AP-2β agonists. Some monoaminergic
  drugs, such as phenelzine and citalopram, also have been shown to alter the brain
  levels of AP-2β [, ]] while tetracycline induces its gene expression[]. KCTD1 &
