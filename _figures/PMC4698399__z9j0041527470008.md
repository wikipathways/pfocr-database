caption: Processes responsible for the synthesis, trafficking, and degradation of
  membrane proteins. A simplified schematic representation of the anterograde (forward)
  vesicular trafficking pathway by which newly synthesized ion channels reach (and
  are retained at) the surface membrane, as well as established endocytic recycling
  pathways. Also shown are some of the major trafficking proteins involved and examples
  of pathway-specific cargo (red boxes). For detailed information, the reader is referred
  to specialized reviews on this subject (, , , , ).
