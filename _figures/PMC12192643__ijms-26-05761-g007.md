caption: Schematic figure illustrating the signaling pathway activation with mechanical
  ventilation and endotoxemia. Endotoxin-enhanced augmentation of mechanical stretch-mediated
  cytokine production, ER stress, and lung injury was reduced by the administration
  of 4-PBA and with PI3K-γ homozygous knockout
