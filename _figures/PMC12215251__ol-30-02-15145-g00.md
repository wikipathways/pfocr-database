caption: 'Schematic diagram of the Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway, created in BioRender.
  Jing, L. (2025) https://BioRender.com/t20q988. The Wnt/Ca2+ pathway is primarily
  activated by Wnt5a and Wnt11 ligands, which bind to the FZD receptor on the cell
  membrane. This interaction triggers the activation of G proteins and the FZD adapter
  protein Dvl, which mediates the activation of PLC. PLC then cleaves PIP2 into IP3
  and DAG. Subsequently, IP3 binds to InsP3R on the ER membrane, causing the release
  of Ca2+ from the ER. In response to the decreased Ca2+ levels in the ER, STIM1 proteins
  on the ER membrane activate the Orai protein in the PM. The Orai protein tetramerizes
  to form the CRAC channel, which mediates the influx of extracellular Ca2+ into the
  cytoplasm. The increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ primarily regulates three distinct pathways:
  i) With DAG, it activates PKC, further stimulating CDC42, inducing actin polymerization
  and promoting cell polarization and migration. This pathway also cascades through
  the Wnt/PCP pathway; ii) it activates CaMKII, stimulating TAK1, which then activates
  NLK to phosphorylate TCF, inhibiting the β-catenin/TCF complex and blocking gene
  transcription; and iii) it activates CaN, phosphorylating NFAT and promoting downstream
  gene transcription. FZD, frizzled; G protein, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding
  protein; Dvl, disheveled; PLC, phospholipase C; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate;
  IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; InsP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  receptors; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; STIM1, stromal interaction molecule 1; PM,
  plasma membrane; CRAC, calcium release-activated calcium; CDC42, cell division cycle
