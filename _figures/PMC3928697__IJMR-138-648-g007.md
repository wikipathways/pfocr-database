caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed pathway of CD33 siglec-mediated suppression
  of cellular function in Leishmania infection. On macrophage, after ligand (present
  on various pathogen surface) binding with CD33 related siglecs, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  inhibition motif (ITIM) present on the cytosolic portion of siglecs get activated
  by phosphorylation with SH2 family kinases (Lyn, Syk). Then Src homology 2 domain-containing
  phosphatases 1 and 2 (SHP1 and SHP2) bind with the ITIM and get activated. These
  activated SHPs further dephosphorylate various signaling molecules and suppress
  cellular activation. The target of SHPs might be p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases
  (p38 MAPK) or Akt or nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
  (NF-kβ) and ultimately downregulate the effector functions of the cell. In macrophages
  this siglec-mediated pathway might regulate the polarization of macrophage function
  towards anti-inflammatory type by reducing Th1 cytokines (IFNγ) and increasing Th2
  cytokines (IL-10) along with downregulating inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
  gene expression for nitric oxide (NO) secretion.
