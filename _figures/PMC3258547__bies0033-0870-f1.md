caption: 'The complex intracellular trafficking pathway of the Gap1 amino acid transceptor
  as influenced by the nitrogen supply. Newly synthesized Gap1 is transported through
  the secretory pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the trans-Golgi network
  (TGN), from where it can be sorted to either the plasma membrane under nitrogen-depleted
  conditions, or to the vacuole/lysosome for subsequent degradation under favorable
  conditions of nitrogen supply. Vacuolar sorting is mediated first by the Rsp5-Bul1/2
  ubiquitin ligase complex, with cooperation from the GGA coat proteins functioning
  as ubiquitin-sorting receptors at the TGN. In the next step, ubiquitinated Gap1
  is delivered to the multivesicular body (MVB), where the second sorting decision
  is made: the ubiquitinated permease may either become MVB cargo for delivery to
  the vacuole/lysosome, or may be rerouted to the plasma membrane. Recycling of Gap1
  can occur directly from the MVB to the plasma membrane in a GSE complex (GTPase-containing
  complex for Gap1 sorting in the endosomes) assisted trafficking step, or indirectly
  via the TGN, which involves Lst4/7, the GSE complex, the protein kinase Npr1 and
  the α-arrestin Aly2. Aly1 is proposed to function independently of known recycling
  mediators. Elevated internal amino acid levels, especially glutamate and glutamine,
  block the MVB-to-TGN recycling of Gap1. Formation of inwardly budding MVB vesicles
  is regulated by sequential participation of the ESCRT protein complexes. Before
  Gap1 is endocytosed into the MVB, ubiquitin is removed by the deubiquitination enzyme,
  Doa4. Subsequently, direct fusion of the MVB with the vacuole/lysosome results in
  the delivery of Gap1-containing internal MVB vesicles to the vacuolar lumen for
  proteolytic degradation. The Npr1 protein kinase is required for stabilization of
  Gap1 at the plasma membrane, but its precise action mechanism has remained unclear.
  Transcription of the GAP1 gene is under nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) control,
  i.e. the gene is expressed in the presence of poor or no nitrogen sources and it
  is repressed in the presence of good nitrogen sources. Under conditions of nitrogen
  depletion or inhibition of TORC1 by rapamycin, Gln3 and Gat1 localize to the nucleus
  where they bind to GATA sequences within the promoter of GAP1 to stimulate transcription.
  The information in this figure has been compiled from the following references,
  in which more detailed information on the different components involved or possibly
  involved in Gap1 trafficking can be found: [, ]–[].'
