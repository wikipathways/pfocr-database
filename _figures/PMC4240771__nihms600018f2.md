caption: The activation of multiple receptors and complementary pathways are needed.
  The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate over spines produces receptor activation,
  which in turn generates neuron depolarization and Ca2+ influx, through NMDA receptor
  and VSCC. Ca2+ activates many process, among them, Ca2+/Calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) complex
  and RAS activation. Ca2+/CaM together with dopamine activate AC, increasing cAMP
  levels, which recruits and activates PKA. Activation of RAS, by Ca2+-dependent and
  growth factor-dependent mechanisms, can activates ERK through MEK1/2 and PKB through
  PI3K. mGluRs are able to activate PKC through PLC/DAG pathway. All these signaling
  pathways seem to be important for Erk activity, including nuclear and cytosolic
  activities (represented by a box) like AMPAR exocytosis regulation and Rsk2 phosphorylation.
  In the nucleus ERK and other kinases (Rsk2 and CaMKIV) phosphorylate and activate
  the cAMP response element-binding (CREB).
