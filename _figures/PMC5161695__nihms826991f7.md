caption: IKKε promotes glycolytic-metabolism and pancreatic tumor growth through its
  regulation of Akt/GSK3β/c-MYC axis. c-MYC is an important mediator of IKKε signaling
  whose nuclear-retention and -stabilization is controlled by IKKε through a chain
  of events that include Akt activation resulting in inhibitory phosphorylation of
  GSK3β and the escape of c-MYC from GSK3β-mediated nuclear-efflux and subsequent
  degradation. Once stabilized, c-MYC activates multiple factors of glycolytic pathway
  with concomitant increase in glucose-uptake and lactate-efflux, leading to quick
  and efficient energy production to serve as prelude for synthesis of downstream
  molecules/factors involved in pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis.
