caption: Summary of the interactions identified in this work between Dmrt5 and the
  secreted ligands and Wnt/Bmp regulated graded transcription factors expressed during
  early patterning of the cerebral cortex. Wnt and Gli3 control Dmrt5 expression.
  Direct or indirect action of Gli3 on Dmrt5, through regulation of the Wnt signaling
  pathway, is indicated by dashed lines. Dmrt5 in turn is required for Wnt and Bmp
  expression in the dorsal midline signaling center. In the absence of Dmrt5, this
  feedback loop is not maintained, which is likely responsible for the downregulation
  of Wnt target genes. Pax6 is upregulated in Dmrt5 mutants, presumably through its
  negative regulation by Wnts and Emx2.
