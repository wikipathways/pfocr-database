caption: Model showing elevated calcium and/or phosphate up-regulate HGF secretion
  and c-Met activation in conjunction with activation of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway,
  leading to SMC mineralisation, which can be inhibited by AdNK4 treatment. Signalling
  molecules and osteogenic transcription factors downstream of PI3K/Akt were shown
  to be involved in HGF/c-Met-induced mineralisation. We also show HGF/c-Met-induced
  Notch3 activation and using the Notch inhibitor, DAPT, we demonstrate attenuation
  of calcification suggesting Notch3 signalling involvement in this process. The dotted
  arrows between c-Met activation and HGF secretion indicate other factors could be
  associated with c-Met receptor and HGF ligand interaction.
