caption: 'The influence of band 3 on red blood cell metabolism in different conditions.
  The schematic, adapted from Issaian et al.5 shows different conditions and the influence
  of band 3 on red blood cell metabolism in three different scenarios. (A) In deoxygenation/low
  oxidant stress conditions, deoxyhemoglobin can bind to the N-terminus of band 3,
  while glycolytic enzymes become displaced from the same region and are then activated,
  resulting in increased fluxes through glycolysis and decreased fluxes through the
  pentose phosphate pathway. (B) In oxygenated or high oxidative stress conditions,
  glycolytic enzymes can bind to the N-terminus of band 3, resulting in their partial
  inhibition, decreasing the metabolic flux through glycolysis and increasing flux
  through the pentose phosphate pathway to generate the reducing equivalent NADPH
  necessary to counteract oxidant stress. (C) In the absence of the extreme N-terminus
  of band 3 during storage, under high oxidative stress conditions, glycolytic enzymes
  cannot bind band 3 N-termini, so glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase flux continues,
  and the pentose phosphate pathway is suppressed, leading to enhanced oxidative stress.
