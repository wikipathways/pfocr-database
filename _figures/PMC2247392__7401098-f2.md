caption: Growth factors trigger local and long distance signalling. In the cell body,
  various growth factors, such as NGF and EGF, trigger the activation of the MAPK
  pathway. After the activation of TrkA (shown in blue) several positive feedback
  loops induce persistent MAPK signalling, causing cell differentiation. Rab GTPases
  regulate endosomal dynamics and signalling; for example, internalization of TrkA
  receptor in Rab5-positive endosomes, acts as a positive feedback loop for TrkA signalling,
  as shown by S. Halegoua (New York, NY, USA). Conversely, EGFR (red) is rapidly internalized
  to Rab7-positive endosomes in a process regulated by ubiquitination, in which EGFR
  signalling is rapidly downregulated. Both EGFR and TrkA are ubiquitinated and can
  signal from early endosomes (EE). However, how ubiquitination regulates TrkA endocytosis
  and why the signalling of both receptors from EE is different is still a matter
  of debate (see ). In distal parts of the cells, such as axons in neurons, growth
  factor signalling might be transmitted to the cell body by using phosphorylation
  waves (small red arrows) or motor-regulated vesicle transport of a signalling endosome.
  EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; imp-β, importin-β; LE/L, late endosome/lysosome;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NGF, nerve growth factor; PKC, protein kinase
