caption: Possible cross-talk of IFNs and the AIM2 inflammasome pathways in AMs from
  TB patients (AMTB) modulated by M. tuberculosis. Upon recognition of mycobacterial
  components via TLR signaling and subsequent activation of the transcription factor,
  NF-kB, IFNs (type I and II) are expressed in AMs. IFNs bind to their specific receptors
  and activate the signaling pathway responsible for DNA transcription and expression
  of ISGs, including IRF1 as well as the inflammasome components, AIM2. IRF1 promotes
  the expression of GBPs and IFNs, mainly IFN-γ. GBPs permeabilize the membrane of
  Mtb, resulting in the release of bacterial DNA. M. tuberculosis cytosolic DNA is
  sensed by the AIM2 inflammasome. IRFs also stimulate the expression of antimicrobial
  genes, such as iNOS, which potentiates the activation of the AIM2 inflammasome.
  AIM2 promotes the maturation of pro-IL-1β to IL-1β, which has pro-inflammatory activity.
  The sustained production of IL-1β is based on AIM2-suppressing type I IFNs (see
  Discussion). Genes significantly upregulated are shown in red. The intensity of
  red corresponds to an increase in fold-change levels of AMTB infected with M. tuberculosis
  compared to control. Genes in white did not exhibit significant changes in expression.
  The network was generated with IPA (Fisher test, p value ≤ 0.05).
