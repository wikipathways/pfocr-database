caption: Osteocytic changes in sclerostin expression mediate bone mechanotransduction
  to skeletal loading. MSC = mesenchymal stem/stromal cell; LRP = low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein; GSK-3β = glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta; CKIα = casein
  kinase 1 alpha; APC = adenomatous polyposis coli; TCF/LEF = T cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer factor family of transcription factors. Figure created with BioRender.com.
  Figure 2A represents a skeletally ‘unloaded’ model, for example during sedentary
  activity. Minimal strain is detected by the mechanosensitive osteocytes resulting
  in upregulation of SOST expression. Increased sclerostin inhibits the canonical
  Wnt signalling pathway in mesenchymal stem/stromal cells by preventing binding of
  Wnt proteins to the LRP/frizzled receptor complex, ultimately resulting in ubiquitin-mediated
  proteolysis of cytosolic β-catenin and hence inhibition of β-catenin mediated changes
  in osteogenic gene expression. Figure 2B represents a skeletally ‘loaded’ model,
  for example during HiRIT. Increased strain is detected by the mechanosensitive osteocytes
  resulting in downregulation of SOST expression. Reduced sclerostin allows Wnt to
  active LRP/frizzled receptor complex, ultimately resulting in protection of β-catenin
  against proteolysis, β-catenin nuclear translocation and modulation of transcription
  factors involved in gene expression promoting osteogenic differentiation
