caption: p53 and potential outcomes of p38MAPK activation. Both pro-apoptotic or survival
  stimuli can be transduced by p38MAPK pathway. A wide array of MAP3Ks stimuli that
  converge to MAP2Ks (MKK3 and MKK6) which, in turn, mediate the activation of different
  p38MAPK isoforms. Preferential activation of specific nodes and isoforms according
  to the type and/or duration of the stimulus are fundamental in the final biological
  outcome. In addition, cell-context and integration with other signaling pathways
  are able to skew the final outcome. In the wtp53 cell-context (left) activated p38MAPK
  alpha phosphorylates directly wtp53, contributing to its activation, and stabilize
  p21 mRNA orchestrating growth arrest or apoptosis. Conversely, activated wtp53 induces
  Wip1 phosphatase expression mediating a negative regulatory feedback on p38MAPK-p53
  signaling. Conversely, in a mutant p53 cell-context (right), the increased MKK3
  gene expression by mutated protein, through NF-Y and NF-κB transcription factors,
  could contribute in sustaining and/or enhancing the p38MAPK signaling in a positive
  regulatory feedback, which potentially supporting further mutant p53 gain-of-function
  activities and thus cancer cell proliferation, survival or chemoresistance.
