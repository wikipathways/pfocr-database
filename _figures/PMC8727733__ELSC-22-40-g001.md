caption: 'Schematic diagram of the reductive glycine pathway (rGlyP) in close relation
  to the THF cycle. Enzyme abbreviations: FTHFS refers to formate tetrahydrofolate
  ligase (EC 6.3.4.3″, Fch to methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.9),
  MtdA to methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.5), SHMT to serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (EC 2.1.2.1), LSD to L‐serine dehydratase (EC 4.3.1.17), P to pyridoxal 5′‐phosphate‐dependent
  glycine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.4.2), T to tetrahydrofolate‐dependent aminomethyltransferase
  (EC 2.1.2.10), H to lipoamide‐containing aminomethylene carrier, L to NAD+‐dependent
  lipoamide dehydrogenase (EC 1.8.1.4). The colored arrows indicate the three modules
  of the rGlyP, namely the assimilation of formate to form 5,10‐CH2‐THF (blue arrow),
  the synthesis of glycine by the reverse GCS reaction (green arrow), and the channeling
  of glycine into the central carbon metabolism (pink arrow)'
