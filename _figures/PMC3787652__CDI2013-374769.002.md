caption: Differentiation and commitment of IL-17-producing T helper (TH)17 cells in
  the midpoint of other coacting cells in favor of and against the harboring individual.
  Upon antigen recognition, presentation and cosignaling, naïve (TH0) cells differentiate
  in the presence of distinct cytokine milieu into effecter (TH1, TH2, TH9, TH17,
  TH22, and TFH) and T regulatory (TReg) cells. Signaling cytokine and other molecules
  activate lineage-unique transcription factors that ultimately mediate cell differentiation
  and maturation. Whereas activation of STAT1 induces T-bet expression, STAT6 signaling
  upregulates GATA3 expression; both cell lineages reciprocally regulate each other
  and regulate the generation of TH17 cells through their hallmark effecter cytokines,
  IFN-γ and IL-4, respectively, though IFN-γ is produced by TH17 cells in some disease
  settings and in response to certain infections. Differentiation of TH17 necessitates
  costimulatory signals of CD28 and ICOS (the last is not mandatory) and the absence
  of TH1 and TH2 cytokines (IL-12/IFN- and IL-4) and their master transcription factors;
  a task taken over by TGF-β is to constrain TH1 and TH2 during TH17 differentiation
  program. TH17 and TReg are likely descendants of the same ancestor cell lineage,
  which differentiates in presence of low levels of TGF-β and IL-6/IL-21 or other
  proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-18) into TH17 cells; TGF-β signals
  through Smad2 protein pathway and is indispensable for induction of expression RORγt.
  High levels of TGF-β alone induce Foxp3 expression and hence TReg cell differentiation.
  Following their final commitment and upregulation of IL-23R, TH17 cells require
  IL-23 signaling that is crucial for their survival and effecter functions including
  production of IL-22, as well as, cell plasticity including later production of IFN-γ.
  TH22 may differentiate from TH0 cells or through a local commitment of TH17 cells
  homed in the epidermis. Contributions of TH17 cells entail activations of aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor (AhR) signaling and production of IL-22 upon exposure to xenobiotic substances.
  IL-17 and IL-17F increase production of IL-6, IL-8, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), monocyte
  chemotactic protein-(MCP-) 1, and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
  by various cells including macrophages, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and epithelial
  and endothelial cells and ultimately promote inflammatory diseases, AD, and/or cancer.
  These cytokines together with IL-21 and IL-22 are also implicated in mediating protective
  as well as pathogenic processes in various disease settings.
