caption: Emphasis is placed on ligands and receptors that activate pathways, the main
  effectors of each pathway, and their target molecules. The interactions of integrins
  with their ligands, such as fibronectin (FN), causes the autophosphorylation of
  FAK by PKC-θ, which leads to the activation of downstream signaling that results
  in the increased expression of the genes encoding caveolin-3 and the β1D integrin.
  Neogenin-netrin signaling also causes FAK activation. Ligation of M-cadherin activates
  Rac1 in a Trio- and Dock1-dependent manner. Cdc42 and Rac1 are major activators
  of vinculin, F-actin, Vasp, and the Arp2/3 complex for the cytoskeletal remodeling
  that occurs before myoblast fusion. The MEK5-dependent activation of ERK5 promotes
  binding of the transcription factor SP1 to the promoter of the genes encoding the
  transcription factors Klf2 and Klf4, leading to their increased abundance. Subsequently,
  Klf2 and Klf4 bind to the Npnt promoter and induce the production of nephronectin
  during myoblast fusion. Increases in intracellular calcium concentration lead to
  activation of the serine-threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates
  and activates the transcription factor NFATc2. Activated NFATc2 stimulates myoblast
  fusion through the increased production of IL-4 and myoferlin. Possible stimuli
  for NFATc2 activation are PGF2α and GH. In response to mechanical overload, the
  transcription factor SRF becomes activated, which leads to the increased abundance
  of IL-4 though COX2-dependent mechanisms. Low amounts of the cytokine TWEAK activate
  the noncanonical NF-κB pathway through activation of NIK and IKKα. IKKα-mediated
  phosphorylation of p100 results in its proteolytic processing to generate the p52
  subunit and the subsequent nuclear accumulation of p52-RelB heterodimers. Binding
  of Wnt to Frizzled and LRP5/6 disrupts the binding of GSK-3β to β-catenin, thus
  preventing the phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin. β-catenin then translocates
  to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional coactivator for Tcf/Lef target genes.
  Recruitment of TGF-β to its cell-surface receptor leads to the activation of Smad4,
  which translocates to the nucleus and recruits other transcription factors to collectively
  induce the expression of target genes, such as Fgf6. The dashed arrows indicate
  that direct interactions have not yet been shown.
