caption: The functions of propofol-regulated macrophages in different diseases. Propofol
  suppresses the expression of STRT1 by inhibiting IL-1β and IL-18 in rat alveolar
  macrophages or lung tissue, which inhibits cell pyroptosis and attenuates ALI induced
  by rl/R. Propofol inhibits the activation of caspase-3 and the apoptosis of hepatocytes
  and alleviates LPS-induced liver dysfunction. During H/R, the inhibitory effect
  may be induced by the increase in [Ca2+]i in Kupffer cells. Propofol also inhibits
  the TLR/NF-ΚB pathway via microRNA, reduces the release of inflammatory factors,
  and protects the intestinal mucosal barrier of colorectal cancer. Propofol partially
  protects microglia by downregulating TLR4 and inducing inactivation of GSK-3β, which
  inhibits the release of inflammatory factors and reduces LPS-induced neuroinflammation
  (NI). Neuroprotection after brain trauma (BT) may result from propofol reducing
  the expression of two key components of NADPH oxidase, P22phox and gp91phox.
