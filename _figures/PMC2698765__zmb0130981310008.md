caption: Schematic illustration of the hypoxia-induced signaling pathway leading to
  Na,K-ATPase downregulation. Hypoxia increases mitochondrial ROS production and leads
  to AMPK α1 phosphorylation. Activated AMPK directly phosphorylates PKCζ at T410,
  and PKCζ in turn phosphorylates the Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit at Ser18, triggering
  its endocytosis.
