caption: 'Macroautophagy consists of distinct stages: phagophore formation, vesicle
  elongation and completion, and fusion of the double-membrane autophagosome with
  the lysosome to form an autolysosome. The ULK1 complex and Vps34 complex are key
  regulators for the initiation of autophagy. The ULK1 complex is composed of ULK1,
  Atg13, Atg101, and FIP200. Under normal conditions, mTORC1 interacts with the ULK1
  complex and inactivates it. In the presence of autophagy inducers, mTORC1 dissociates
  from the complex. This results in increased ULK1 kinase activity and the phosphorylation
  of Atg13 and FIP200. The Vps34 complex is composed of Vps34, Beclin-1, Vps15, Atg14L,
  and Ambra1. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, the product of ULK1, recruits the
  double FYVE domain-containing protein 1 (DFCP1) and WD-repeated protein interacting
  with phosphoinositides (WIPI) family proteins. Wortmannin and 3-methyladenine inhibit
  ULK1. ULK1 phosphorylates Beclin-1 at Ser14 and enhances PI(3)K activity of the
  Vps34 complex. This phosphorylation is essential for the full induction of autophagy.
  In addition, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates Beclin-1 and activates
  Vps34 lipid kinase. On the other hand, Akt phosphorylates Beclin-1 and suppresses
  its kinase activity. Vesicle elongation and the formation of double-membrane vesicles
  are mediated by 2 ubiquitin-like conjugation systems involving ATG proteins. The
  first system is the ATG12-ATG5 conjugation reaction. The ATG12-ATG5 conjugates form
  a multimeric complex with ATG16L1 through ATG7 and ATG10. The second system is the
  conjugation reaction of LC3, the mammalian homologue of ATG8. LC3-I is generated
  from pro-LC3 by the Atg4 protease. Then, through ATG7, ATG3, and the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L
  complex, LC3 conjugates to the phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II.
  During the formation of the autophagosome from the preautophagosome, ATG12-ATG5
  complexes are released from the membranes, and LC3-II localizes on them.'
