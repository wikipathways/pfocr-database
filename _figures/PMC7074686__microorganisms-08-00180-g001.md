caption: 'The interplay of different signalling pathways that enable C. neoformans
  to turn environmental stresses into phenotypic and physiologic advantages that help
  in the production of virulence factors during pathogenesis in the host. A number
  of pathways are indicated above. The Grp5–Rim101 is a Pka-dependent transcriptional
  factor that undergoes possibly sequential and enhanced proteolysis after activation.
  This pathway is utilised to enlarge the cell size, maintain homeostasis, and synthesis
  capsules. The Ca2+–Calmodulin–Calcineurin pathway that may utilise Ca2+ to initiate
  several transcriptional factors through the activation of Znf2 or Crz1/Sp1. This
  pathway promotes multi-resistance, cell growth, and biofilm formation. The Tco–Ypd1–Ssk1//Ssk2–Pbs2–Hog1–Crz/Sp1
  phosphorylation pathways are phosphorelay cascade systems that can sense many environmental
  factors and enhance virulence production through the activation of different transcriptional
  factors that enable membrane stability, osmotic balance, and several exogenous resistances.
  The Hog1 pathway can also regulate the capsule, melanin, and ergosterol synthesis.
  The Gpr4–Gpa–Cac1–cAMP–Pka can sense exogenous methionine during mating and capsule
  induction. The downstream of this pathway is regulated by Pkr1 while the transcriptional
  factors are under the influence of activated Ngr1. In a yet unknown way, the presence
  of CO2 through Can2 can also activate this pathway; however, Msl1, which seemed
  to be involved in the chromatin assembly factor (CAF-1) for DNA repair may be repressing
  this pathway. The Ras1–Rac1//Ras1–Cdc24–Cdc42–Ste20 is sensitive to several environmental
  factors, and together with cAMP–Pka enhances virulence production such as capsule,
  melanin, actin, and several cellular resistances and tolerances. The Pdk1–Pkc1–Bck1–Mkk2–Mpk1
  can be activated by metabolic stress, phosphatidylinositol (PI), and Rho-family
  proteins. Activated Pkc can phosphorylate several intracellular messengers, including
  Crz/Sp1, and initiate capsule and melanin production. Several transcriptional factors
  for resistance and tolerance can also be initiated by the Mpk1 complemented by the
  Rho-family proteins. LEGEND: Δ—change; dashed line arrows—possible positive regulation/activation;
