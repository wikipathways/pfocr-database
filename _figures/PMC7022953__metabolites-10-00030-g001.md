caption: 'Representative example of maize embryos to illustrate the subcellular compartmentation
  of hexose-phosphates in plant cells. Developing maize embryos mainly import glucose
  and fructose as carbon sources. These sugars get phosphorylated into hexose-phosphate
  in the cytosol. The resulting hexose-phosphates are involved in major pathways:
  glycolysis (purple), and the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway (OPPP; green).
  Full and dashed arrows represent one reaction or a multiple-step reaction, respectively:
  1 is hexokinase; 2, phosphoglucose isomerase; 3 and 7, cytosolic and plastidial
  aldolases, respectively; 4 and 8, exchange of hexose-phosphates and triose-phosphates
  between cytosol and plastid, respectively; 5, starch synthesis; 6, oxidative part
  of the OPPP; 9, glucose 6-phosphatase; 10, sucrose phosphate synthase; and 11, invertase.
  Abbreviations in alphabetical order: E4Pp, plastidic erythrose 4-phosphate, FRU(ext),
  (extracellular) fructose; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; GLC(ext), (extracellular) glucose;
  G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; H6Pp, plastidic hexose-phosphates; P5Pp, plastidic pentose-phosphates;
  S7Pp, plastidic sedoheptulose 7-phosphate; TP(p), (plastidic) triose-phosphates.'
