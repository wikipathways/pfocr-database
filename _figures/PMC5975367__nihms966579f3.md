caption: Pre-clinical and clinical models have indicated that the tumor microenvironment,
  for example pancreatic stellate cells in the case of pancreatic cancer, p53 status,
  RAS family status, activation of JAK–STAT and PI3K signaling may all play roles
  in the determination of autophagy dependence within cancer cells, both in vitro
  and in patients. These pathways have all been shown to affect autophagy either positively
  or negatively and many participate in cross-pathway signaling. Signaling through
  p53 can both promote and inhibit autophagy and may interact with other proteins
  activated by mutations to enhance autophagy dependence, especially in pancreatic
  cancer. Activation of EGFR via amplification or mutation leads to the downstream
  up-regulation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway as well as activation of STAT3 and the
  RAS pathway. Although autophagy inhibition can occur through mTOR activation, these
  downstream effects collectively result in stimulation of autophagy and an increase
  in autophagy dependence. Mutations or alterations in the RAS family (specifically
  KRAS) have been shown to promote autophagy, enhancing tumor growth and therapy resistance.
  Specific mutations in RAF such as BRAFV600E promote autophagy dependence in multiple
  tumors including central nervous system (CNS) tumors and melanoma. Finally, autophagy
  regulation of JAK-STAT signaling through IL-6 has been identified as a mechanism
  of autophagy dependence in breast cancer. All of these pathways are complex and
  interact on multiple levels. Identification of tumors with these pathways and as
  of yet to be identified pathways will provide methods of detection of autophagy
  dependent tumors.
