caption: Schematic diagram of the pathway by which myoglobin expression decreases
  tumor growth and proliferation in breast cancer cells. We propose that expression
  of myoglobin in breast cancer cells causes an increase in oxidant damage to parkin,
  resulting in parkin's degradation. This decrease in parkin allows for stabilization
  of MFN1/2 and increased mitochondrial hyperfusion, leading to cell cycle arrest
  through increased p21 and decreased cyclin E expression, ultimately culminating
  in inhibition of cellular proliferation and tumor growth.
