caption: Lipid metabolism changes in NENs. The expression of ACSS2 is up-regulated
  by HIF-1α under hypoxia, which regulates lipid metabolism through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway to promote the progression of NENs. FASN, a key enzyme in the fatty acid
  synthesis pathway, is up-regulated in NEN. FABP5 interacts with FASN to regulate
  the expression of FASN through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, promote lipid droplet
  deposition and activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to promote the progression
  of NEN. However, the FASN inhibitor orlistat could reverse this process. ALKBH5,
  an m6A demethylase, is up-regulated in NENs, which increases the expression of FABP5
  in an m6A-IGF2BP2-dependent manner, activates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and
  leads to lipid metabolism disorders and promotes the progression of NENs. HIF-1α
  regulates the overexpression of Cyp46a1 enzyme in NENs to produce 24 S-HC, and activation
  of the HIF-1α/ 24 S-HC axis induces neovascularization
