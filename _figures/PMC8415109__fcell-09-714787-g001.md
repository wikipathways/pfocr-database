caption: A schematic representation of the crosstalk between Hippo signaling cascade
  and lncRNA NORAD in lung and breast neoplasms. YAP/TAZ is mainly modulated via the
  canonical Hippo cascade, MST1/2-SAV1, and LATS1/2-MOB1. LATS1/2 could in turn phosphorylate
  YAP/TAZ and suppress its function through either ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated
  degradation or 14-3-3-mediated cytoplasmic sequestration. Unphosphorylated YAP/TAZ
  is transferred to the nucleus, where it could interact with TEAD transcription factors
  and trigger the expression of various target genes. LATS1/2 could be upregulated
  via STK25, TAOK, NF2, and MAP4KS, while being inhibited through GPCR-RHOA-mediated
  F-actin function mechanical cues as well as NUAK2. In addition, expression of MST1/2
  is regulated by TAOK and MARK4. Expression of YAP/TAZ is also modulated in an independent
  manner from LATS. Besides, PTPN14 and AMOT could interact with YAP/TAZ and sequester
  it in the cell membrane. Expression of YAP/TAZ is downregulated via the β-catenin
  demolition complex or TIAM1 through a direct interaction. Phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ
  is triggered by CDK1, AMPK, Aurora A, NLK, and various RTKs. In addition, p38 and
  VGLL4 could interact with TEAD and inhibit the function of YAP/TAZ (). Mounting
  evidence has collectively demonstrated that the Hippo pathway transducer YAP/TAZ-TEAD
  complex could play an effective role in suppressing the expression level of lncRNA
  NORAD in both lung and breast cancers. Its downregulation correlates with enhancement
  of migration, invasion as well as metastasis in tumor cells ().
