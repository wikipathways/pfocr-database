caption: Molecular mechanism of pyroptosis. In the canonical inflammasome signaling
  pathway, PAMPs, DAMPs, and extracellular ATP are stimulated by intracellular signaling
  molecules and assembled with pro-caspase-1 and ASC to form inflammasomes and activated
  caspase-1. N-GSDMD perforates cell membranes by forming non-selective pores. In
  addition, IL-1β and IL-18 were secreted in the pores formed by N-GSDMD. In the non-canonical
  inflammasome signaling pathway, intracytoplasmic LPS activates caspase-4/5/11, which
  triggers pyroptosis by cleaving GSDMD. However, oxPAPC competes with LPS for binding
  to caspase-4, thereby inhibiting pyroptosis. Cleavage of GSDMD leads to K+ efflux
  that ultimately mediates the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, cleavage
  of GSDMD leads to cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. In the caspase-3-mediated
  pathway, active caspase-3 cleaves GSDME to form N-GSDME, inducing pyroptosis. In
  the caspase-8-mediated pathway, inhibition of TAK1 induces the activation of caspase-8,
  which cleaves GSDMD, leading to pyroptosis. In addition, under hypoxia, TNF-α activates
  caspase-8 after apoptosis to pyroptosis, which can regulate the transcription of
  GSDMC.
