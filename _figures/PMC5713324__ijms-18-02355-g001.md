caption: Metabolic reprogramming and an altered intercellular communication are hallmarks
  of cancer cells. Enhanced demands of glucose (Glc) and glutamine (Gln) as well as
  low supply of oxygen are characteristic features of cancer cell metabolism. They
  activate distinct transcription factors, such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α),
  cellular Myelocytomatose (c-Myc) and nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells (NFκB), and upregulate expression of glycolytic and glutaminolytic key enzymes.
  Aerobic glycolysis leads to a high lactate concentration and a low pH of the tumor
  microenvironment (TME). Glycolytic metabolites stimulate the pentose phosphate pathway
  to produce ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) and the production of the amino acids serine
  (Ser) and glycine (Gly), thereby filling the tetrahydrofolate pool of C1-groups
  ([C1]-folate). The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is fueled by glutamine (Gln) via
  glutamate (Glu) and α-ketoglutarate (αKG). Glutamate is also converted to glutathione
  (GSH), an intracellular redox buffer. Metabolites, phosphoenolpyruvate and oxaloacetate
  are abbreviated to PEP and OA, respectively. Membrane-bound cell adhesion molecules
  (e.g., integrins) and cell–cell contact molecules (e.g., cadherin), as well as secreted
  and soluble growth factors and chemokines are other key communicator molecules between
  cancer cells and their neighboring stromal cells. Cell adhesion molecules bind to
  the extracellular matrix (ECM) and sense its rigidity and mechanical forces.
