caption: Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)/death receptor
  signaling in the regulation of apoptosis and metastasis of cancer cells. (A) Under
  normal apoptotic conditions (e.g., in cancer cells sensitive to TRAIL with activated
  death receptor pathway), TRAIL ligation with its death receptors (DR4 and DR5) or
  an agonistic antibody binding to a corresponding death receptor (DR4 or DR5) on
  the surface of cancer cells induces the formation of the death-inducing signaling
  complex (DISC) involving Fas-associated death domain (FADD) recruitment of pro-caspase-8
  via its death effector domain, resulting in caspase-8 or -10 activation followed
  by cleavage and activation of caspase-3, -6, and -7, and eventual execution of apoptosis
  or anoikis. This mechanism restricts the formation of the metastasis and invasion
  signaling complex (MISC) and subsequently suppresses cell invasion and metastasis.
  When TRAIL/death receptors are inhibited or their functions are compromised, available
  FADD and caspase-8 may recruit and stabilize TNF-receptor-associated factor (TRAF)2
  with the help of S1P, resulting in enhanced TRAF2 polyubiquitination and activation,
  likely through a self-ubiquitination mechanism. This will further lead to activation
  of ERK/JNK/AP-1 signaling and NF-κB activation, which activates MMPs (e.g., MMP1)
  and enhances the release of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., monocyte chemoattractant
  protein 1 (MCP1)) that promote invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. MCP1 may
  induce monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein-1 (MCPIP1) expression, leading
  to a reduction in DR5 levels, including cell surface DR5; this favors MISC formation
  and metastasis. (B) In TRAIL-insensitive cells, TRAIL treatment will induce the
  formation of a second signaling complex or FADDosome, resulting in the activation
  of multiple protein kinases such as NF-κB, JNK, p38, ERK, and Src that are involved
  in the positive regulation of invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. In KRAS-mutated
  cancer cells, TRAIL/DR5 activation can activate the Rac1/PI3K/Akt axis, promoting
  cell invasion and metastasis. RIPK1, receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
  kinase 1. DR, death receptor.
