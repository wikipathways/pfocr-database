caption: 'JAK2-STAT5 Signaling Pathway. The pulsatile pattern of GH release in male
  mice activates the JAK2-STAT5 signaling pathway (or “signaling cascade”): Circulating
  GH binds to transmembrane GH receptors (GHR), which are members of the cytokine
  receptor family and widely expressed on the surface of target cells in the liver.
  GH binding induces a conformational change in GHRs that activate Janus kinase 2
  (JAK2), and then this enzyme phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of the GHR, generating
  docking sites for the transcription factor STAT5b. After STAT5b binds to these sites,
  it undergoes JAK2-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation and dissociates from the GHR
  to form homodimers (e.g., STAT5-STAT5) or heterodimers with other STAT proteins.
  STAT5 dimers enter the nucleus and bind response elements in gene regulatory regions,
  initiating transcription (; ). After transcription, STAT5b is deactivated by phosphotyrosine
  phosphatase (PTPase). STAT5b can then enter into another cycle of JAK2-catalyzed
  phosphorylation, and it can undergo multiple rounds of this cycle in response to
  a single male GH pulse (). In response to female-like patterns of GH release, STAT5b
  cycles are terminated more rapidly through STAT5b inhibitors, including PTPase,
  PIAS (protein inhibitors of activated STATs), and SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling)/CIS.
  MUP gene expression is repressed in females by CUX2, a small interfering RNA (siRNA;
  ). Figure adapted from .'
