caption: 'The VEGFR-2 homodimer (blue) and its phosphorylated residues known to facilitate
  signaling are shown. Proteins that bind to VEGFR-2 are depicted (green) along with
  their downstream targets (purple). Phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 Tyr1054 and Tyr1059
  residues are required for maximal receptor activation. Binding of TsAd to phosphorylated
  residue Tyr951 enhances endothelial cell migration and vascular permeability through
  Src activation. Phosphorylation of residue Tyr1175 recruits PLCγ, which activates
  PKC to activate endothelial cell proliferation and migration through PKD or the
  MAPK pathways. Tyr1175 is also a docking site for Shb, which activates endothelial
  cell migration or endothelial cell survival through the PI3K and AKT/PKB pathway.
  Phosphorylation of Tyr1214 subsequently activates cdc42 and p38 MAPK to induce endothelial
  cell migration. Finally, phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 also activates FAK and paxillin
  and IQGAP to stimulate endothelial cell motility. Abbreviations: VEGFR-2 (vascular
  endothelial growth factor receptor-2); TsAd (T-cell specific adaptor); Tyr (tyrosine);
  FAK (focal adhesion kinase), IQGAP1 (IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein
  1); PLCγ (phospholipase C gamma); Shb (Src homology 2 and β cells); PKC (protein
  kinase C); MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase kinase); MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase); PKD (protein kinase D);
  HDAC7 (histone deacetylase 7); PI3K (phophatidylinositol 3′-kinase); PKB (protein
  kinase B); eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase)'
