caption: SIAH-dependent proteolysis is essential for K-RAS signal transduction in
  human pancreatic cancer. This schematic diagram shows that the RAS signaling pathway
  is highly conserved from fruit flies to humans. (A) A schematic illustration of
  the Drosophila RAS signal transduction pathway is shown. SINA is the most downstream
  signaling gatekeeper identified in the Drosophila RAS pathway, and its function
  is required for the proper transmission of active EGFR/RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK/ETS signal
  in vivo; (B) A schematic illustration of the human RAS signal transduction pathway
  is shown. The human RAS pathway has an identical signaling cascade and the same
  key downstream signaling modules as discovered in Drosophila. The extensive evolutionary
  conservation observed in the RAS-SIAH signaling axis suggests that the gatekeeper
  function of SINA/SIAH is likely to be conserved from invertebrates to vertebrate
  animals. Therefore, analogous to Drosophila SINA, inhibiting human SIAH function
  may provide a novel and innovative means to inhibit oncogenic K-RAS-mediated tumorigenesis
  and metastasis in pancreatic cancer.
