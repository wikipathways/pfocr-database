caption: 'Cytokine regulation of immune response cell phases through gender specific
  pathways. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) regulate Th cell differentiation and Th
  cell network homeostasis under resting and activated conditions of the immune system
  in both men and women, however this effect appears to be exerted through male and
  female gender-specific health pathways: IL6 pathways regulate the homeostasis of
  the Th cell network in women, whilst this homeostasis is regulated by IFNγ pathways
  in men. The study [] indicates that these regulatory differences do not usually
  have consequences until IFNγ and/or IL6 cytokine pathway alterations occur, ensuring
  the same result: a physiological homeostasis between Treg, Th17 and Th9 cells in
  the resting state, in the transition to the activation phase and in the return to
  the resting state.'
papertitle: The discovery of how gender influences age immunological mechanisms in
  health and disease, and the identification of ageing gender-specific biomarkers,
  could lead to specifically tailored treatment and ultimately improve therapeutic
  success rates.
