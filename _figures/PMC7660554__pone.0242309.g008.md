caption: 'A) Extracellular lactate activates a transmembrane Gs protein-coupled receptor
  and promotes dissociation of α and βγ subunits. The βγ subunits activate the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
  3-kinase (IP3-K) pathway and promotes activation of protein kinase C (PKC), probably
  through PDK1, a rich pleckstrin homology domain-residue protein that responds to
  PIP3. Activation of IP3-K may facilitate the incorporation of AMPA receptors on
  the synaptic terminals. It is likely that the active form of PKC also phosphorylates
  the NMDAR and promotes Ca2+ entry and CaMKII to enhance the synaptic strength of
  the RC synapses. At the RC synapse, lactate increases the EPSP-to-spike coupling.
  The identity of the ionic conductances underlying the EPSP-to-spike coupling in
  response to lactate remains to be determined. B) Presynaptic modulation of lactate
  at the RC and MF synapses. Upon its accumulation, lactate is transported to the
  intracellular milieu via the membranal monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2) and
  metabolized to pyruvate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Then, acetylCoA
  derived from pyruvate enters the Krebs cycle to produce ATP and indirectly, adenosine.
  Because RC and especially MF terminals [] express the inhibitory adenosine A1 receptor,
  activation of the A1 receptor may be responsible for the depression of the synaptic
  transmission observed during lactate perfusion. Additionally, astrocytes as prime
  sources of extracellular ATP and lactate signaling [] may be involved in the synaptic
  plasticity of CA3 PC; however further experiments are required to prove this hypothesis.
  Bottom center: At the postsynaptic level, perfusion of lactate increases the action
  potential discharge of CA3 PC, by a mechanism sensitive to cholera toxin. The underlying
  conductances modulated by extracellular lactate operating the increased intrinsic
  excitability remains to be determined.'
