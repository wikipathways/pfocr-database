caption: Model for JAK pathway activity in embryogenesis. We propose that Upd is the
  ligand for stimulation of the JAK pathway in early embryonic development. Upd protein
  is produced in a restricted set of embryonic cells, in which it is glycosylated
  and secreted, and diffusion is restricted by association with the ECM. Through binding
  of Upd to a yet unidentified receptor, the Hop JAK is stimulated, resulting in phosphorylation
  of Stat92E. Ultimately, transcription of specific pair–rule genes, such as eve,
  is activated (see text for details).
