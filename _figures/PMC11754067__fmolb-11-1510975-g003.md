caption: Lysine Lactylation modulates Metabolic Pathways in Prokaryotes. This schematic
  illustrates our current understanding of how metabolic pathways in prokaryotes are
  interconnected and directly regulated by lactylated enzymes within glycolysis, the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, nucleotide synthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis
  networks. YiaC functions as a writer to catalyze the addition of KL-la, while CobB
  serves as an eraser to remove this lysine lactylation. The proteins in cycles represent
  the substrates for CobB or YiaC identified by proteomics. The pink cycles represent
  the substrates validated by experiment. Notably, YiaC was shown to enhance the lysine
  lactylation of GltA and PncB. CobB shows clear lysine lactylation eraser activity
  of PykF, GpmA, and Mdh. The removal of lactylation by CobB enhanced the enzymatic
  activity of PykF, thereby promoting glycolysis and bacterial growth (Dong et al.,
  2022). Designed and created by Wenjuan Zhao and Jiayi Xin
