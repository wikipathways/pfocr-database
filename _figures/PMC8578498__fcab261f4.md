caption: Activation of neuronal tyrosine kinase receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors
  and ionotropic glutamate receptors by TLQP-62. (A) Activation of the BDNF/TrkB pathway
  by TLQP-62 or antidepressants through TrkB phosphorylation initiates PI3K activation,
  which subsequently phosphorylates and activates PKB followed by mTOR. This induces
  VGF, BDNF and GluR1 protein synthesis, promoting NPC proliferation and decreasing
  NPC differentiation, which modulates long-term hippocampal memory formation. Activation
  of BDNF/TrkB sequentially activates MAPK followed by ERK1/2. This triggers CREB
  activation in the nucleus and leads to increased mRNA expression of BDNF followed
  by VGF and SYN1. This results in increased synapsin-1 and VGF protein synthesis,
  followed by TLQP-62 production, together promoting NPC-mediated long-term hippocampal
  memory formation. Activation of BDNF/TrkB triggers PLCγ on the plasma membrane to
  activate CaMKII, which converges with pathway B. (B) TLQP-62 binds via an unknown
  mechanism and activates the ionotropic glutamate receptor, NMDAR, which triggers
  the sequential phosphorylation and activation of CaMKII followed by CREB. CREB subsequently
  activates PKC, which regulates intracellular Ca2+ levels and phosphorylates and
  activates ERK1/2 to promote AMPAR formation on the plasma membrane. This contributes
  to long-term hippocampal memory formation. Activation of CREB also directly induces
  gene transcription to trigger NPC-mediated hippocampal memory formation. (C) TLQP-62
  binds via an unknown mechanism and activates the GPCR, mGluR5, which induces the
  phosphorylation and activation of PKD. PKD induces downstream transcriptional changes
  that contribute to NPC-mediated long-term memory formation by an unknown mechanism.
