caption: Cpr2 activates the pheromone signalling pathway to regulate morphogenesis
  in C. neoformans. (A) Cpr2 governs yeast to hyphae development in the fruiting process,
  affects cell–cell fusion efficiency and suppresses abnormal haustorial hyphae formation
  during mating. (B) A model depicting signalling events leading to Cpr2 expression
  and subsequently evoked by Cpr2. Upon mating, the pheromone-bound Ste3a/α receptors
  activate the pheromone signalling pathway and induce a modest level of CPR2 expression.
  The expression of CPR2 is further dramatically induced after cell–cell fusion by
  the Sxi1α/Sxi2a heterodimer. Cpr2 is constitutively active and thus sustains pheromone
  signalling and may support a positive feedback loop, which might be disrupted at
  a later time point when CPR2 expression is reduced.
