caption: Nuclear factor kappaB regulation, NF-κB dimers are held in the inactive state
  by a family of inhibitors called I-κB. Diverse signaling mechanisms, such as inhibition
  of PHD activity by hypoxia or DMOG, leads to activation of a multisubunit kinase
  IKK complex which phosphorylates I-κB on two key serines. Phosphorylation of I-κB
  marks it for degradation by the ubiquitin pathway, NF-κB dimer is thus liberated
  to translocate to the nucleus, bind DNA and activate transcription. Under normoxia,
  a hydroxylation reaction, catalyzed by PHDs hydroxylates the proline on the IKK□
  subunit, inhibits the downstream phosphorylation events thus inhibiting NF-κB activation.
