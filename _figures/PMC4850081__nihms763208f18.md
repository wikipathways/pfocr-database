  lung tumor tissues resected from an NSCLC patient infused with 13C6-glucose (adapted
  from Fan et al. []). U-13C6-glucose was infused into the patient 2–3 h prior to
  resection and cryopreservation of cancer and surrounding benign (normal) tissues.
  The liquid N2-frozen tissues were pulverized and extracted for polar metabolites,
  which were analyzed by 2D 1H{13C}-HSQC at 14.1 T. The 1D 13C projection spectrum

  carbon positions is evident in cancer versus paired benign tissues. The pathway
  scheme in (A) traces 13C atoms from 13C6-glucose into intermediates of glycolysis,
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), the Krebs cycle, Ser-Gly pathway, and uracil biosynthesis.
  Based on this scheme and 13C abundance data in (A), the cancer tissue displays enhanced
