caption: Conversations between Wnt/β-catenin and MAPK signaling pathways. Wnt ligands
  apart from activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway also activate MAPK pathways. Wnts induce
  a strong activation of p38 MAPK and this activation is G-protein and Dishevelled
  dependent. Wnt-activated p38 MAPK regulates Wnt/β-catenin signalling by inactivating
  GSK3β kinase activity. Similarly, Wnt-induced JNK activation occurs through G-proteins,
  Dishevelleds, small molecular weight GTPases (RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42), MEKKs and MKKs.
  Activated JNK phosphorylates its prime substrate, c-Jun, that ultimately leads induction
  of planar cell polarity. The phosphorylated c-Jun may also translocate into the
  nucleus and along with nuclear Dishevelled regulates Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene transcription.
  ERKs are also activated by Wnt through Raf1/MEK/pERK pathway and induce cell proliferation.
  In addition, the activated ERKs may also translocate into the nucleus and regulate
  the Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene transcription.
