  str 168) is clearly important for the biosynthesis of the thiosugar (3). ThiG is
  a key enzyme involved in the formation of thiazole of thiamine. Studies of thiamine
  biosynthesis in B. subtilis showed that the ThiG reaction is initiated by the Schiff
  base formation between one of lysine residues (Lys96) of ThiG and the 2-keto group
  of its substrate, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP, 42). As illustrated in ,
  the sulfur atom is transferred from the thiocarboxylate (43) at the C-terminus of
  a sulfur carrier protein, ThiS, and incorporated into the ThiG-DXP adduct (44).,
  Because of the presence of the bexX gene in the cluster, an analogous mechanism
  of sulfur incorporation can be proposed for the biosynthesis of the 2-thioglucose
  (). Accordingly, the putative substrate, glucose 6-phosphate (45), may form an imine
  adduct (46) with the active site lysine of BexX at C-1 position. Deprotonation of
  C-2 of 46 followed by tautomerization via an enamine 47 generates a 2-keto intermediate
  48, which can then react with a nucleophilic sulfur group to incorporate a sulfur
  atom at C-2 in 49. The reactive sulfur donor is likely a ThiS-thiocarboxylate or
  a protein persulfide equivalent. Dehydration of 49 to 50 followed by C-1 deprotonation
  gives an enamine intermediate 51, which can tautomerize to C-1 imine 52. Upon hydrolysis,
  the BexX-bound product 52 is released to give 2-thioglucose 6-phosphate (53/14).
