caption: Schematic overview of relationships between the ER stress pathway, autophagy,
  and NDRG1. Stress stimuli are known to lead to the phosphorylation of PERK and its
  downstream effector eIF2α, which can lead to autophagic initiation through phagophore
  formation. This latter process involves the conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II and
  its incorporation into the phagophore membrane (). Iron chelators can increase expression
  of the metastasis suppressor NDRG1 through HIF1α-dependent and -independent pathways
  (, ). The current study demonstrates that NDRG1 suppresses LC3-II expression and
  the formation of autophagosomes containing this latter protein. It also demonstrated
  that NDRG1 increases the susceptibility of the cell toward apoptosis. Thus, it is
  hypothesized that the NDRG1-mediated decrease in the autophagic flux results in
  decreased nutrient recycling that could play a role in the ability of NDRG1 to enhance
  apoptosis and inhibit metastasis.
