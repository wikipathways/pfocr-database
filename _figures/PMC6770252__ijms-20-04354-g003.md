caption: Biological origin of free radicals and their effect on cell viability. Reactive
  Oxygen Species (ROS) are generally derived both from intrinsic factors (enzymatic
  reactions physiologically conducted in subcellular organelles) and from the numerous
  extrinsic ones. Although ROS evidently remain essential for normal functioning of
  the cell, including immune response or redox signaling, their overload may prove
  harmful and cause significant damage. Ultimately, it may lead to execution of apoptotic
  or necrotic cell death or even drive tumor growth. Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)
  signaling pathway is closely linked to ROS-induced oxidative stress and it becomes
  activated to address cellular redox imbalance.
