caption: 'Putative brassinosteroids biosynthetic pathway. Schematic representation
  of brassinosteroids biosynthetic pathway showing early and late C-6 oxidation pathways.
  Mevalonate and non-mevalonate pathways synthesize cycloartenol which leads to the
  synthesis of isofucosterol and 24-methylenecholesterol which further synthesize
  stigmasterol and withanolides as well as brassinolide respectively, driven via separate
  routes. This 24-methylenecholesterol then undergoes various reactions to form active
  brassinosteroids. Enzymes involved are: Dwarf4 (DWF4): DET2, CYP85A1, CYP85A2, CYP90A1,
  and CYP90B1 (found in Arabidopsis) and CYP90D2 () and CYP92A6 designated with an
  asterisk present in rice and pea, respectively.'
