caption: 'Network maps showing the miRNAs for which targets are over-represented in
  gene-sets related to cell adhesion, EMT, estrogen receptor pathway, metastasis,
  and the respective target genes. Blue: down-regulated miRNA/gene; red: up-regulated
  miRNA/gene; gray: gene involved in pathway. Gene-sets were pre-selected from the
  Molecular Signature Database and multiple Fisher Exact tests were performed as mentioned
  in methods. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend,
  the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
