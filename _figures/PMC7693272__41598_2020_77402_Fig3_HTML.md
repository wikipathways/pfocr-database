caption: 'Regulation of genes on the MAA biosynthetic pathway in C. fritschii PCC
  6912 under UV-B and FR light. Blue and red/pink represents significant log2 fold
  change for UV-B light exposure and FR light exposure respectively (− 1.3 > log2
  fold > 1.3 and p adj < 0.05). Right and left of mid-line denotes upregulation and
  downregulation respectively. (A) Early common biosynthetic shikimate pathway to
  both MAAs and AAAs. Pathway from E4P and PEP to 3-dehydroquinate showing regulation
  under UV. E4P = D-erythrose 4-phosphate and PEP = phosphenolpyruvate; both intermediates
  in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. DAHP = 3-deoy-D-arabino-heptulosonate
  7-phosphate. 3-DHQ = 3-dehydroquinate. (B) Pathway to MAAs via DDGS with change
  in regulation of the four mys gene cluster (WP_016876762—WP_016876765) under FR
  and UV. DHQS: 3-dehydroquinate synthase, DDGS: demethyl 4-deoxygadusol synthase,
  mysA; O-MT: caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, O-methyltransferase, mysB; ATP grasp,
  predicted ATP-dependent carboxylase. ATP-grasp ligase superfamily forming mycosporine-glycine,
  mysC (has no EC number); NRPS non-ribosomal peptide synthase—Amino acid adenylation
  domain, mysE. The branch point to AAAs from 3-DHQ is also shown.'
