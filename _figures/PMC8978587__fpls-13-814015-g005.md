caption: The predicted schematic diagram of calcium signaling pathway and hormone
  biosynthesis related genes in peanut embryo cells and their subcellular localization.
  Red color indicates up-regulated genes, green indicates down-regulated genes. Calcium-transporting
  ATPases and Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGC) are localized in different
  intracellular organelles and have high capacity Ca2+ flow across membranes. ACA12
  and ACA13 are present in the plasma membrane, ACA4 in the vacuole and ECA4 in endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). CNGC1 is in the plasma membrane, CNGC15 in nucleus and CNGC20 in
  vacuole membrane. EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PLC, phosphoinositide
