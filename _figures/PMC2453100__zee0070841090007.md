caption: Schematic representation of the activated PI3K-AKT pathway and its downstream
  effectors that contribute to the tumorigenesis of TSHomas in TRβPV/PV mice. Aberrant
  activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR-p70S6Kpathway in pituitaries of TRβPV/PV mice increases
  protein synthesis and cell growth. AKT decreases cyclin D1 degradation by inhibiting
  GSK-3β activity through phosphorylation (). AKT also inhibits cell apoptosis through
  phosphorylation of BAD and FoxO3a. Phosphorylated BAD is incapable of inhibiting
  the activity of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (,). Similar to the phosphorylated BAD,
  phosphorylated FoxO3a is retained in cytoplasm and thus is incapable of activating
  the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bim (). All these processes are reversed
  by LY294002 in vivo by deactivating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. By decreasing
  the subsequent phosphorylation events after the AKT activation, LY ultimately reduces
  tumor growth by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis in TSHomas
  of TRβPV/PV mice.
