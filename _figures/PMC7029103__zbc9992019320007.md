caption: PlsX membrane association is crucial for acyl-PO4 channeling to PlsY. Membrane
  association creates a path shielded from solvent for the transfer of acyl-PO4 to
  the bilayer. Channeling may also involve transfer directly to PlsY, via protein-protein
  interaction. PlsX mutants that do not associate with the membrane still produce
  acyl-PO4 but this cannot reach PlsY and is hydrolyzed to free fatty acids in the
  cytosol.
