caption: Hypothalamic leptin signaling. Leptin binds to LepR on the cell membrane,
  inducing the phosphorylation of JAK2, which in turn phosphorylates STAT3, and causes
  the translocation of STAT3 to the nucleus. In the nucleus, p-STAT3 induces the expression
  of Pomc and Socs3 and represses the expression of Npy, miR-488, and miR-384-3p.
  SOCS3 negatively feeds back to inhibit JAK2 phosphorylation. miR-488 and miR-384-3p
  target the 3′-UTR of Pomc mRNA and inhibit its expression. miR-200a targets the
  3′-UTR of LepR, inhibiting its expression and reducing leptin sensitivity. Socs3
  is targeted by miR-19a and can enhance JAK2-STAT3 signaling. Palmitate directly
  induces leptin resistance by inducing inflammation and ER stress, resulting in the
  activation of PTP1B and SOCS3. Excess palmitate can also induce leptin resistance
  by chronically increasing circulating leptin, leading to overactivation of the signaling
  pathway.
