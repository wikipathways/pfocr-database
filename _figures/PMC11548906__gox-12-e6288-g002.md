caption: Potential regulation of adipogenesis in lipedema. The signaling pathway of
  adipogenesis displays the difference of mesenchymal stem cells to mature adipocytes
  via known signaling cascades. Known regulating factors of adipogenesis are marked
  in black. Factors that might be involved in the development of lipedema based on
  our data analysis were shown in red and their activating or inhibiting effects were
  labeled accordingly
