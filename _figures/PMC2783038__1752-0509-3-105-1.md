caption: The chemotaxis pathway of R. sphaeroides. The currently known localisation
  and connectivity of the chemotaxis pathway in R. sphaeroides is shown. The localisation
  of the two signalling clusters, one at the pole and one in the cytoplasm was determined
  by GFP fusions and immunoflouresence []. The remaining connectivities, was determined
  be in vitro phosphotransfer measurements and by mutant data [,]. It is currently
  unknown what role CheY3 and CheY4 perform in the system.
