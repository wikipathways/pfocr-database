caption: 'Tracer compositions should be scrutinized to optimize information for pathways
  of interest. The example displays a simple glycolytic pathway in which we assume
  that reactions only flow in the forward direction. Uniformly labeled glucose results
  in identical isotopomers from the PPP (purple box) and glycolysis. Using a combination
  of 50% fully labeled glucose with 50% unlabeled glucose can better inform PPP fluxes,
  as the complex atom rearrangement in the PPP leads to M+1, M+2, M+4, and M+5 isotopomers
  (shown in red box). The percent composition of these isotopomers can be used to
  determine flux activity at the PPP branchpoints. A more direct option is to use
  [1,2-13C2] glucose, which generates an M+1 isotopomer after entering the PPP by
  being metabolizing into R5P that is further metabolized into M+1 F6P and G3P. In
  contrast, the glucose that is directly metabolized into F6P generates M+2 isotopomers.
  Therefore, the ratio of M+1 and M+2 isotopomers in metabolites such as F6P and G3P,
  as well as derivatives such as lactate and pyruvate, can be compared to determine
  relative activity at the PPP branchpoint. Red = carbons that pass through the PPP;
  black = carbons that pass through the main glycolytic pathway. The red, dashed boxed
  encompasses isotopomers that can only be formed after passing through the PPP. Abbreviations:
  glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), ribose-5-phosphate (R5P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P),
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).'
