caption: Comparing feedback mechanisms in morphogen signaling. (A) A cell responding
  to a typical polypeptide morphogen (purple ovals). Green dashed arrows point to
  extracellular inhibitory factors induced by the signal. Red lines denote intracellular
  mechanisms of repression. (B) An RA-producing cell showing the biosynthetic pathway
  for RA. Retinyl esters and beta-carotene are important stores of RA precursor. Green
  dashed arrows point to components of the pathway induced by RA signaling. Red lines
  denote repression of adhs and aldh1as by RA. (C) Polypeptide morphogens typically
  induce their own receptors, which are subsequently degraded through receptor-mediated
  endocytosis. (D) An RA-responding cell showing signaling and catabolism. RA (red
  circles) enters cells and binds Crabps (blue crescents), which transport it either
  to RARs (blue and green ovals) in the nucleus (orange) for signaling or to Cyp26s
  (black hexagons) for degradation. Adhs, alcohol dehydrogenases; aldh1as, aldehyde
  dehydrogenase 1as.
