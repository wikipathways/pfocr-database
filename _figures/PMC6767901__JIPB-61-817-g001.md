caption: 'Scheme of a plant cell presenting the known peroxisomal transporter and
  channel proteins connecting peroxisomal metabolism with that of the cell Based on
  the proposed transport mechanism, the peroxisomal ABC transporter CTS import acyl‐CoA
  esters into the peroxisomes. During this import process, the substrates is hydrolyzed
  to fatty acids and CoA and released into the peroxisomal matrix. Such a transport
  mode requires the intra‐peroxisomal ATP‐dependent re‐esterification to CoA for fatty
  acid activation. The peroxisomal ATP carrier PNC import cytosolic ATP in exchange
  with AMP, which is produced during fatty acid activation. ATP is also required for
  other ATP‐dependent reaction inside peroxisomes, including auxin biosynthesis, protein
  phosphorylation and mevalonate pathway. NAD‐dependent reactions inside peroxisomes,
  like fatty acid oxidation, depend on the import of NAD from the cytosol catalyzed
  by the peroxisomal NAD carrier PXN. The exchange partner for the NAD uptake is generated
  by peroxisomal NADH hydrolysis. NAD can be phosphorylated to NADPH, which is the
  cofactor for NADP‐dependent ICDH and the OPPP enzymes G6PDH and 6‐PGDH. In addition,
  peroxisomes require a peroxisomal CoA carrier (PCC) mediating the uptake of CoA,
  which has not been identified for plant peroxisomes. If the CoA is cleaved off at
  the cytosolic side of the peroxisomal membrane during the transport of acyl‐CoA,
  the peroxisomal CoA carrier imports cytosolic CoA into peroxisomes required for
  fatty acid activation. Peroxisomal CoA is also used to remove acetyl‐CoA from the
  fatty acyl chain in the last step of β‐oxidation, whereas the glyoxylate cycle produces
  free CoA. To regulate CoA homeostasis, CoA can be hydrolyzed to PAP or 4‐PP, which
  are suitable counter‐exchange substrates for the CoA import. The further hydrolysis
  of PAP yields AMP, another putative export substrate for the peroxisomal CoA carrier.
  Other intermediates of the peroxisomal metabolism, such as organic acids, might
  be shuttled via the peroxisomal channel protein called PMP22 across the peroxisomal
  membrane. Pex11 as a second channel might be involved in the uptake of free fatty
  acids into the peroxisomes, as a redundant system to the peroxisomal ABC transporter.
  Other compartments of a plant cell, like plastids and mitochondria, possess a large
  variety of transporter and channel proteins for shuttling metabolites across their
  bilayer membranes, including the outer envelope proteins OEPs, plastidial MCF‐type
  carriers, plastidial PMP22‐type channels, voltage‐dependent anion channels (VDACs),
  mitochondrial MCF carriers, and mitochondrial PMP22‐type channels. Abbreviations:
