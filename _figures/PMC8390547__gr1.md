caption: Pathway of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) synthesis. The
  n-3 PUFAs, such as Alpha-linolenic acid is metabolized by delta-6-desaturase and
  elongase to Eicosatetraenoic acid, which further peroxidized by Delta-5-Desaturase
  to Eicosapentaenoic acid (Shown in red row). The same sets of enzymes metabolize
  n-6 PUFAs, linoleic acid, to Arachidonic acid (n-6 metabolism shown in blue). The
  COX-2 is responsible for conversion of arachidonic acid to precancerous prostaglandins,
  whereas COX-2 is also involved in peroxidation of Dihomo-gamma-linoleic acid to
  an anti-cancer compound, 8-HOA (For interpretation of the references to color in
  this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.).
