caption: Regulation of AR development by various hormones and their crosstalk. Auxin
  controls AR initiation by activating ARF6 and ARF8, leading to downregulation of
  COI1-mediated JA signalling. GH3.3, GH3.5, and GH3.6 are regulated by ARF6, ARF8,
  and ARF17. The 3 GH3s control JA homeostasis. JA level controls JA-Ile levels. JA-Ile
  negatively regulates AR development by activating COI1-dependent signalling. Feedback
  regulation by DAO1 is activated by JA signalling, which then regulates IAA homeostasis.
  SA at low concentration promotes AR development, whereas at higher concentrations
  it inhibits AR development. CK regulates auxin homeostasis by negatively affecting
  auxin carriers PIN, LAX, and YUCCA1 genes, thereby regulating adventitious rooting
  through these pathways. In poplar cuttings, CK signalling activates PtARR13, which
  represses AR formation by promoting the expression of PDR9 and inhibiting the expression
  of TINY-Like TF. Solid black arrows indicate confirmed pathway. Dotted arrow indicates
  pathways for which there is little or no evidence. Blue arrow indicates low level
  of SA and green arrow indicates high level of SA.

    Feedback regulation by DAO1 is activated by JA signalling, which then regulates
