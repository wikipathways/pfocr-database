caption: The role of Klotho in vascular protection. (A) Klotho can activate PI3K/AKT/Nrf2/HO-1
  to enhance endothelial antioxidant defense; It can also activate PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway,
  and alleviate the inhibition of eNOS phosphorylation by inflammatory factors such
  as TNF-α, thereby promoting NO production and preventing endothelial cell dysfunction.
  Klotho is involved in the transmission of VEGF signaling and regulates Ca2+ influx,
  which helps to maintain endothelial integrity. (B) Klotho inhibits phosphate uptake
  by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), leading to improved vascular calcification.
  It also inhibits the PiT2/RUNX2 signaling pathway, which improves extracellular
  matrix calcification. Additionally, Klotho inhibits the Wnt7b/β-catenin signaling
  pathway, which prevents VSMC calcification. NO, nitric oxide; eNOS, endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase; PI3K, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; AKT, protein kinase B; Nrf2,
