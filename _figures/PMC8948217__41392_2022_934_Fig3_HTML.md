caption: The role of NOTCH signaling in body development and damage repair. NOTCH
  signaling is involved in regulating the differentiation and function of stem cells,
  affecting organ production and damage repair. a NOTCH signaling promotes the self-renewal
  of stem cells, induces multipotent progenitors for lineage selection, and generates
  different terminal cells; when the organ is damaged, cell type A is damaged and
  destroyed, and the stimulated cell type B rapidly upregulates the expression of
  NOTCH signaling to promote their own proliferation, and is partially redifferentiated
  into cell type A. b Highly activated NOTCH induces the expression of bile duct cell-enriched
  transcription factors and promotes the differentiation of multipotent hepatocyte
  progenitors into bile duct epithelial cells. c In liver injury, BEC are damaged
  and destroyed. NOTCH signaling is highly expressed in hepatocytes, which are further
  transformed into biphenotypic cells, which manifests the biliary tract morphology,
  and finally generate new BEC (BEC’) to form small tubular structures. HPC, hematopoietic
