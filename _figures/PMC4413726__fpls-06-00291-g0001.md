caption: Polyamine biosynthetic pathway in plants. Putrescine is synthesized directly
  from ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase and indirectly from arginine by arginine
  decarboxylase, agmatine iminohydrolase and N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase.
  Spermidine and spermine are, respectively, formed by the subsequent addition of
  an aminopropyl moiety to putrescine and spermidine by spermidine synthase and spermine
  synthase, respectively. Two enzymes, diamine oxidase, and polyamine oxidase, participate
  in degradation of polyamine.
