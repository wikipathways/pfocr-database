caption: Predicted pathways deregulated during ZIKV infection. The unfolded protein
  response pathway is shown at (A) 48 hpi and at (B) 72 hpi. The pathway generated
  using the Ingenuity software package. The color indicates deregulation of that gene
  in infected as compared to control samples (red = upregulated; green = downregulated;
  grey = unchanged). White arrows = translocation; black arrows = direct interaction
  resulting in activation/expression/modification/transcription; dotted lines = indirect
  interaction.
