caption: The emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of human pathogens is a major
  concern. The prevalence of these resistant strains has compelled researchers to
  investigate new targets/approaches for antimicrobial drug design. The pathway for
  D-galactofuranose (Galf) biosynthesis is one potential target for chemotherapeutic
  development. Galf is an essential component in the glycoconjugates of many pathogenic
  microorganisms, but has not been found in mammals. In the Galf biosynthetic pathway,
  UDP-D-galactopyranose (UDP-Galp , 1) is converted to UDP-D-galactofuranose (UDP-Galf,
  2) by UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM) (), and Galf is subsequently transferred
  from 2 to various glycoconjugates by the appropriate galactofuranosyl transferase.
  Since UGM is pivital for mycobacterial cell growth and infection, UGM inhibitors
  may be potential antimicrobial agents.
