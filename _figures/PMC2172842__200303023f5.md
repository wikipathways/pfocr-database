caption: Model for the signaling pathway leading to SCAR activation during S2 cell
  lamella formation. The con A–coated coverslip activates both Rac proteins and Nck
  by initially cross-linking an unidentified cell surface receptor(s). The Rac proteins
  and Nck signal through parallel pathways to cause dissociation of trans-inhibited
  SCAR bound by a complex of kette, Sra-1, and Abi. After dissociation, SCAR is able
  to promote actin nucleation by Arp2/3 at the cell membrane. SCAR may then be inactivated
  either by reassociation with its inhibitory complex or by degradation.
