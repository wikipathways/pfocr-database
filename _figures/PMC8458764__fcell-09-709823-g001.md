caption: Overview of the canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. (A) Following
  binding of Wnt to the Frizzled-LRP5/6 complex and the activation of the signaling
  pathway, the destruction complex (comprising of GSK-3β, CK-1, AXIN, and APC) is
  tethered to the plasma membrane, which permits β-catenin to accumulate and translocate
  to the nucleus, where it bind to TCF7L2 to activate downstream genes. (B,C) Wnts
  can also signal through non-canonical pathways to induce cell responses. (B) The
  Planar Cell Polarity pathway is activated upon Wnt binding to the Fz receptor. Dsh
  is subsequently activated, initiating the activites of Rho and Rac through Daam1.
  This leads to the eventual activation of ROCK and Jnk, which phosphorylates c-jun
  within the nucleus and allows it to initiate the transcription of target genes.
  (C) The Wnt/Ca2+ pathways is also activated by Fz; however, it is coupled to a G-protein,
  leading to intracellular Ca2+ release through PLC/IP3 activity. Ca2+ promotes the
  activity of CAMKII and Calcineurin to provoke the accumulation of the transcription
  factor NFAT in the nucleus. This figure was made with modified images from Servier
