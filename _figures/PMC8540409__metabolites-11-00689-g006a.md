caption: '(A) Proposed choline metabolic pathway after Zn ion treatment. The number
  in the circle indicates the ratio of each metabolite between the control and Zn
  ion−treated groups (normalized intensity of Zn ion−treated sample/normalized intensity
  of control sample). The number in the box indicates the phosphorylated ratio of
  kinase (phosphorylated-form kinase intensity/unphosphorylated-form kinase intensity)
  between the Zn ion−treated groups divided by the control. The color of the red series
  indicates an increase in the ratio, and the blue series indicates a decrease in
  the ratio. Circles represent the metabolome; boxes represent kinases; ⓟ denotes
  phosphorylated kinase. Statistically significant: * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p
  ≤ 0.001, and **** p ≤ 0.0001. (B) Choline concentration in Zn ion-treated Raji cells.
  The integrated peak intensities of choline were normalized by the concentration
  of DNA in each cell pellet. Cells were incubated in Zn ion−containing media (10
  mg/L) for 6, 12, and 24 h (n = 3). * p < 0.05.'
