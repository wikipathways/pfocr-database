caption: Role of Nox-derived ROS in Ang II-mediated effects in vascular cells. Ang
  II binds to its AT1R, which couples to heterometric Gq proteins, to activate PLC,
  leading to generation of IP3 and DAG, resulting in increased [Ca2+]i that triggers
  phosphorylation of MLC20 and stimulation of contraction. Ang II also induces contraction
  through the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway that increases Ca2+ sensitivity by inhibiting
  MLCP. Ang II/AT1R stimulates Nox-derived ROS formation, which regulates MAPKs, tyrosine
  kinases, PTPs, and transcription factors. Formation of ROS through Ang II/AT1R further
  regulates AT1R through a feed-forward mechanism (dashed lines). Ang II, angiotensin
