caption: Integrated summary of α-glucan metabolic pathways in bacteria. The scheme
  reflects the overlay of different metabolic routes and enzymes discussed, evoking
  the idea of an underlying common theme supported by the evolution of an ancestral
  metabolism. The prokaryotic cell is depicted as enclosed by its membrane (double
  dotted boundary line) where glucose and other sugars enter and are transformed along
  the gluconeogenesis pathway eventually leading to the synthesis of glucose 1-phosphate,
  which is subsequently activated by forming sugar donors NDP-glucose (ADP-glucose
  or UDP-glucose). Different pathways for intra- and extracellular α-glucan synthesis
  depart from top to bottom, traversing the synthesis of glucose disaccharides. The
  area of the metabolism comprises reactions requiring nucleotide-sugar donors (violet
  background shade) and independent nucleotide-sugar (light blue background shade).
  The parallel biosynthetic routes follow similar transformations catalyzed by enzymes
  with typical catalytic domain architecture. Rossmann folds enzymes, preeminently
  NDP-sugar transferases (blue hexagons), and GT-B fold (yellow circles) drive transformation
  involving nucleotide derivatives. In contrast, TIM barrel folds (red boxes) take
  control of all nucleotide-independent transformations. Other intermediate reactions
  are driven by HAD domain phosphorylases (green parallelograms), which catalyze disaccharide
  dephosphorylation, and the phosphorylation of maltose carried out by the Maltokinase
  (violet trapezium)
