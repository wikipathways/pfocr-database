caption: Inferred pyridine nucleotide salvage cycle encoded by KVP40. The components
  of the NAD salvage pathway (solid lines) are most related to enzymes of bacteria,
  none of which have been previously identified in phages. PnuC (CDS215) and NadR
  (CDS211) are shown as a complex for active transport of nicotinamide mononucleotide
  (NMN) across the bacterial membrane (hatched bar). Nicotinamide (NAm) is assimilated,
  but an active transport system has not been described. NadV (CDS264) is a nicotinamide
  phosphoribosyltransferase (NAmPRT) resembling the enzyme from Haemophilus ducreyi
  that catalyzes the formation of nicotinamide mononucleotide from nicotinamide. NadR
  is bifunctional, having an apparent nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase
  domain similar to that of bacterial enzymes. The two-domain Nudix hydrolase (here
  designated NatV; CDS162) resembles one found in the marine cyanobacterial species
  Synechocystis, which also has a nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase
  domain. Hydrolysis of NADH (dashed lines) can occur by the NatV Nudix hydrolase
  and by a KVP40 enzyme (CDS043) that is a Sir2/CobB-like enzyme prevalent in eukaryotes
  and bacteria (also not previously seen in a phage). See references , , , , and  for
  details on the pathway and related enzymes.
