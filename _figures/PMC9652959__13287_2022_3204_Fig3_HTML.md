caption: 1. A2a and A2b adenosine receptors activate the adenylate cyclase enzyme
  by Gαs subunit. A1 and A3 receptors inhibit this enzyme by Gαs subunit. All four
  of the mentioned receptors activate PI3K signaling. All four activate PLC signaling
  except for A2a receptor []. Activation of the A1 adenosine receptor results in upregulation
  of Dvl and p-GSK-3β, which finally leads to increased canonical wnt signaling and
  osteogenesis. Activation of adenylate cyclase by adenosine receptors results in
  engagement of the cAMP-PKA pathway and Runx2 gene expression []. This pathway also
  contributes to suppression of NF-KB, which is an osteoclastogenic factor []. 2.
  LKB1, as an AMPK kinase, activates AMPK. Activation of AMPK results in Runx2 gene
  expression through AMPK/FOXO3a/Runx2 pathway. Also, AMPK activation can stimulate
  Akt-mTORC1-p70S6K pathway []. This is known as the pathway through which mTORC1
  signaling exhibits osteogenic differentiation []. 3. NPY signaling influences osteogenesis
  by 3 pathways. First, NPY signaling upregulates Runx2 and thus directly mediates
  osteogenesis. Second, this signaling initiates crosstalks with Wnt-β-catenin signaling
  pathway. NPY signaling results in upregulation of β-catenin and GSK-3β levels and
  enhances canonical Wnt signaling. Finally, by rising OPG levels, NPY signaling blocks
  osteoclastogenesis by negatively regulating OPG/RANKL/RANK pathway
