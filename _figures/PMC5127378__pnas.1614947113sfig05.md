caption: Metabolic effects of nicotinamide. Levels of metabolites in glycolysis, TCA
  cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, purine metabolism, and glutathione metabolism
  of fetal brain from 18.5 dpc dams described in . Vertical axis shows values relative
  to controls. Acetyl CoA, GSH, and GSSG were measured by LC-MS/MS (, ). The other
  metabolites were measured by GC-MS/MS (). The red boxes outline metabolites that
  have concentrations significantly different between the Flt1(1-3) and Flt1(1-3)
  +Nam fetal brains. Nam corrects the deleterious metabolic effects of maternal Flt1(1-3)
  by increasing NAD pools which enhances both glycolysis and TCA cycling. Control
  (n = 9), Nam (n = 8), Flt1(1-3) (n = 8), and Flt1(1-3) +Nam (n = 8). Data are mean
  ± SE. *P < 0.05 with Tukey–Kramer’s test. G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; F6P, fructose
  6-phosphate; GA3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; 2-PG, 2-phosphoglyceric acid; PEP,
  phosphoenolpyruvate; Ru5P, ribulose 5-phosphate; R5P, ribose 5-phosphate; PRPP,
  phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate; IMP, inosine monophosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate;
  GMP, guanosine monophosphate.
