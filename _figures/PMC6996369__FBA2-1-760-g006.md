caption: Scheme of predicted AJP001 signaling and the antibody production induced
  by the AJP001 conjugate peptide vaccine. A. AJP001 activates TLR4 and TLR9 to activate
  the NF‐κB signaling pathway, which results in an increase in the expression of several
  inflammatory cytokines (ie, TNF‐α and IL‐6). AJP001 may induce cathepsin B release
  from lysosomes, leading to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes; however, the mechanism
  of cathepsin B release into the cytoplasm is unclear. Caspase‐1, a component of
  the NLRP3 inflammasome, is activated by cathepsin B and processes pro‐IL‐1β and
  pro‐IL‐18 into their mature forms, which are released from the cell. IL‐1β and IL‐18
  production is dependent on cathepsin B and the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway because
  this production is inhibited by a cathepsin B inhibitor (Ca‐074‐Me) and caspase‐1
  inhibitor (Z‐YVAD‐FMK). B. The AJP001 conjugate peptide vaccine stimulates helper
  T (Th) cells and induces epitope‐specific antibody production in B cells. The AJP001‐B‐cell
  epitope conjugate peptide vaccine is taken up by antigen‐presenting cells (APCs),
  such as dendritic cells and B cells. AJP001 or a peptide containing the AJP001 peptide
  sequence is presented on the cell surface in association with an MHC class II molecule.
  AJP001 elicits adjuvant effects and induces the production of cytokines and expression
  of costimulatory molecules such as CD86. Naïve CD4+T cells (Th) that have a TCR
  that binds to the AJP001‐MHC class II complex are activated with the costimulatory
  molecules induced by AJP001. Activated Th cells recognize B cells presenting AJP001
  bound to MHC class II; subsequently, the B cells are activated and induced to produce
  antibody
