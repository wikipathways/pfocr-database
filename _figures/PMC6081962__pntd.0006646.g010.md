caption: During infection and entry of parasite inside host macrophages; parasite
  induces UPR in host which is mediated via phosphorylation of host PERK. PERK phosphorylation
  in turn activates the Akt pathway by inducing phosphorylation of Akt molecule, BAD
  protein phosphorylation and checks the release of mitochondrial cytochrome-C. Low
  level of released cytochrome-C fails to activate the caspase-3 enzymes as a result
  decreased DNA fragmentation, hence no/delayed apoptotic induction of host. Simultaneously,
  PERK phosphorylation also induces the transcription of anti-apoptotic class of proteins
  (cIAP1 & 2) which resist against apoptotic induction. However, inhibition of infection
  induced host PERK phosphorylation fails to activate this pathway and fates the host
  macrophage towards apoptosis. Also, PERK phosphorylation mediated UPR have a significant
  role in maintaining oxidative balance so parasite induced UPR might have a role
  in neutralizing host generated oxidative burst hence contributing to survival of
  Leishmania.
