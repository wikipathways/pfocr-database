caption: The release of norepinephrine activates a biochemical signaling pathway that
  results in intracellular physiological changes in a cardiac myocyte. The adrenergic
  agonist binds to a β1-AR, which activates the Gsα subunit to stimulate adenylyl
  cyclases V and VI (AC), which then produces cAMP. cAMP activates PKA, the catalytic
  subunit (PKAC) of which phosphorylates numerous targets including the β1-AR, potassium
  channels, calcium channels, ryanodine receptors, phospholamban, and troponin I.
  Meanwhile, cAMP is degraded by phosphodiesterase 3 and 4 (PDE3, PDE4).
