caption: An overview of cannabinoid-induced epigenetic alterations through DNA methylation,
  histone modifications, and miRNA dysregulation. Several classes of cannabinoids,
  which include synthetic cannabinoids, endocannabinoids, and phytocannabinoids, regulate
  inflammation by binding to several receptors (CB1 and CB2, GPR55, and TRPV) found
  on immune cells. Activation of the CB1 and 2 leads to MAPK signaling transduction
  and increases the production of ROS and ceramide. The MAPK pathway induces epigenomic
  changes. On the other hand, GPR55 activation leads to AKT signaling transduction,
  which stimulates epigenetic alterations.
