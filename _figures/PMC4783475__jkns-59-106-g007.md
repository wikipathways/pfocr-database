caption: . Schematic model showing the potential role of bacitracin in inhibiting
  glioma cell invasion. Oxidized protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and reduced PDI
  interconvert under the bacitracin-free condition. During the transformation process,
  PDI alters the conformation of integrin to a high affinity state and integrin binds
  tightly with the extracellular matrix (ECM) (integrin activation). Then, focal adhesion
  kinase (FAK), one of the downstream molecules of integrin, is phosphorylated, which
  increases matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) production. Finally, the cell secretes
  MMP-2, resulting in increased cell invasion. The PDI cycle was disturbed after the
  cells were treated with bacitracin. Bacitracin binding with reduced PDI led to lack
  of oxidation of reduced PDI. Only reduced PDI was present on the cell membrane after
  extending the bacitracin treatment time. Then, integrin was not activated, resulting
  in decreased FAK phosphorylation and MMP-2 production. Finally, MMP-2 secretion
  decreased, which disturbed cell invasion.
