caption: 'The endocytic and secretory pathways. Cargo binds to the plasma membrane,
  is endocytosed by a plethora of processes and, independently of the entry route,
  is transported to early endosomes (EE). From this sub-compartment, cargo is sorted
  to one of three destinations: recycling, degradation, or secretion. These routes
  require maturation of the EE into recycling endosomes or multivesicular bodies (MVBs),
  which can either fuse with lysosomes (L) to generate endolysosomes (EL) or with
  the plasma membrane to release intraluminal vesicles to the milieu as exosomes.
  The membranes of the sub-compartments of the endocytic pathway have different compositions.
  Specific members of the Rab GTPase family, for example, are differentially enriched
  in each sub-compartment: Rab5 is enriched in EE; Rab7 in MVBs; Rab11, Rab25, Rab4,
  and Rab35 in the slow and rapid recycling routes; and Rab27a/b in MVBs. Rab9 is
  present in vesicles destined for retrograde transport to the trans-Golgi network
  (TGN). In uninfected cells, interfering with these Rabs affects exosome release.
  Many viruses use these Rabs in diverse steps of the viral life cycle, although whether
  this usage impacts in exosomal release has not been investigated. For example, at
  late stages of infection, viruses such as IAV, RSV, Sendai virus (SeV), and Andes
  virus (ANDV) were shown to hijack Rab11 vesicles to transport their progeny RNA
  to the cell surface. HIV, HSV1, and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) were shown to require
  Rab27a/b vesicles for assembly. Human herpes 6 (HHV-6) virions were shown to be
  secreted upon fusion of MVB with the plasma membrane, together with exosomes.'
