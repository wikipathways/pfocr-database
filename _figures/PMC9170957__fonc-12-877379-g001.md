caption: Standard of care for the different PCa stages. For Localized PCa, RP is the
  interventional standard of care. On the other hand, for advanced and metastatic
  disease, ADT is the recommended treatment. However, nearly all patients stop responding
  ADT and progress to a CRPC, for which there are no effective treatment options.
  Moreover, about 17% of the patients with a castration-resistant form of the disease
  will develop neuroendocrine differentiation, which is independent of AR signaling
  pathway. PSA, prostate-specific antigen; PCa, prostate cancer; CRPC, castration-resistant
  prostate cancer; NEPC, neuroendocrine prostate cancer.
