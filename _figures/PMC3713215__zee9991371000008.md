caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the main signaling pathways responsible for
  kisspeptin-induced depolarization and burst firing of GnRH neurons. Kisspeptin binds
  to the Gq-coupled GPR54 receptor to activate PLCβ, which catabolizes PIP2, potentiates
  TRPC channel activity, and inhibits the Kir channel activity. PKC, activated by
  the PIP2 hydrolysis product DAG, inhibits the activity of a calcium-activated slow
  afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) current (see Ref. ). cSRC, which is activated by kisspeptin/GRP54
  signaling, potentiates the activity of TRPC4 channels. Calcium entering the cell
  via T-type channels may facilitate the activation of TRPC channels. The present
  findings for the signaling pathway underlying TRPC4 channel activation are highlighted
  in the box.
