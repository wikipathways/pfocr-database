caption: SPC-induced signaling pathways involved in vasospasm. SPC-mediated signaling
  pathway involves Fyn, a Src family kinase, which promotes Rho-kinase activation
  by interacting with paxillin. In addition, SPC can activate NADPH oxidase (NOX)
  through PLC and PKC, increasing ROS generation, which activates the Rho-kinase.
  The activated Rho-kinase phosphorylates myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) to
  inactivate it, and myosin light chain (MLC) remains in a highly phosphorylated state,
  leading to vasospasm
