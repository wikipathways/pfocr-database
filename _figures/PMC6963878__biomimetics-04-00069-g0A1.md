caption: The intracellular signaling pathway of E. coli for chemotaxis. As the chemical
  molecules (represented as triangular shapes) or chemoattractants bind to the the
  methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCP) on the bacterial cell membrane, they
  activate chemical signaling among Che regulator proteins. P represents phosphoryl
  group, transferred among signaling components. +CH and −CH represent the methylation
  and demethylation, respectively, of membrane-bound chemoattractant receptor clusters.
  Running behavior for bacteria occurs when flagella rotate in a concerted counter-clockwise
  (CCW) direction; otherwise, the flagellar motor switches to clockwise (CW) rotation,
  resulting in tumbling behavior.
