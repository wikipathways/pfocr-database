caption: 'Illustration of the targeted co-delivery of the immunological adjuvant Poly
  I:C and cytotoxic drug nanorods for immunochemotherapy by using a strategy of drug-delivering-drug
  (DDD). (I) Preparation of MA-PNRplex by loading Poly I:C on paclitaxel (PTX) nanorods
  (PNRs), followed by MA coating. Purposed mechanism: (II) after intravenous injection,
  (III) MA-PNRplex is internalized via cavesomes, a pathway bypassing endo-lysosomes,
  (IV) continue releasing of PTX while rapidly release Poly I:C, (V) Poly I:C promotes
  the secretion of chemokines and cytokines through RIG-I pathway and recruits immune
  cells to poison the cancer cells; and subsequently, the cumulative release of PTX
  generates additional toxicity to the cancer cells, eventually achieving chemoimmunotherapy.'
