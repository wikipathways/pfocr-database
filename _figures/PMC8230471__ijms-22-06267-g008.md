caption: Schematic representation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) triggering
  the insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF1R)-related signal transduction
  pathway. Activation of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) triggers several signaling pathways.
  IGF1R, a tyrosine kinase, auto-phosphorylates multiple cellular proteins, including
  members of the Shc, Rac, Ras/Raf, and IRS1/IRS2 families. Considering phosphorylation,
  Shc was activated to regulate Rac and Ras/Raf. The Rac pathway is important for
  cell migration, while the Ras/Raf pathway is critical for proliferative responses.
  IRSs interact with signaling molecules, while activation of the PI3K and Akt pathways
  prevents apoptosis, also triggering protein synthesis.
