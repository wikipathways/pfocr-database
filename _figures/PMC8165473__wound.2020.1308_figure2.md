caption: 'Mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory effects of HDL in endothelial cells.
  Left panel: HDL increase formation of bioactive nitric oxide (NO) through interaction
  with the S1P3 receptor, which activates PI3K/Akt, leading to inhibition in action
  of NF-κB. This prevents the translocation of the NF-κB subunits p65/p50 to the nucleus,
  where it binds to the NF-κB response elements (RE) in the promoter region of inflammatory
  genes, including vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and intercellular cell
  adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Right panel: in an alternative pathway, HDL reduce the
  production of inflammatory cytokines CCL2, CCL5, and CX3CL1 through interaction
  with scavenger receptor (SR)-B1 that leads to suppression of downstream kinase signaling
  (PI3K/Akt) and inhibition in the activation of NF-κB pathway. NF-κB, nuclear factor
  kappa B; S1P3, sphingosine-1-phosphate 3. Color images are available online.'
