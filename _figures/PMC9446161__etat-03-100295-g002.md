caption: MAPK pathway and potential sites of therapeutic intervention with inhibitors.
  This molecular pathway is triggered by various extracellular signals. The main components
  of this pathway are RAS, RAF, and MEK leading to the activation of ERK through its
  phosphorylation (P). Once activated, ERK migrates into the nucleus where it activates
  transcription factors that affect cell proliferation and survival. In myeloma, overactive
  RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling resulting from genetic mutations in the RAS and BRAF GTPases
  can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors of RAS G12D (tipifarnib), BRAF V600E
  (vemurafenib, encorafenib, dabrafenib), or MEK (trametinib, binimetinib)
