caption: Leptin-induced signaling pathways. The leptin signaling pathway is initiated
  by leptin–ObR-b receptor interaction, recruitment of ROCK1 (Rho associated coiled-coil
  containing protein kinase 1), and subsequent activation of JAK2 (Janus kinase 2),
  which phosphorylates downstream Tyr985, Tyr1077, and Tyr1138 residues. Three canonical
  signaling pathways that trigger leptin have been reported and are related to the
  regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. The JAK2-STAT3-5 (signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3–5) pathways are the major leptin pathways and induce
  the expression of appetite–regulating genes and SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling
  3). The MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway is related to the expression of early response genes
  involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. The IRS1-2-PI3K-Akt pathway
  is initiated by the direct recruitment of IRS (insulin receptor substrate) to JAK2,
  triggering the activation of proteins related to the expression of weight-regulating
  neuropeptides. Inhibition of leptin signaling is mediated by SOCS3 through a negative
  feedback loop, although PTP1B (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B) proteins have also
  been reported.
