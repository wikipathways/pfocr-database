caption: Insulin receptors in endothelial cells co-localize with cavaolae, and insulin
  signaling in endothelial cells leads to two downstream signaling pathways. Activation
  of the ERK pathway leads to ET-1 release, causing vasoconstriction in vascular smooth
  muscle cells, and the PI3K pathway leads to NO release and vasodilation. Studies
  have also shown that insulin binding to the insulin receptor is required for transcytosis
  of cavaeloe, possibly for translocation of insulin from the plasma to the interstitial
  space. (Image created in powerpoint)
