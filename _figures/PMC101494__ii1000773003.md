caption: 'Enzymatic steps showing potential PG synthesis pathway in chlamydiae. The
  genomes of both C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis have genes encoding each of the
  enzymes indicated. The major step that may be missing is the transglycosidase required
  to link (question mark). All structures are hypothetical and are based on other
  bacterial systems (, ). Enzymes involved in PG hydrolysis are listed in the box.
  Abbreviations: P, phosphate; UDP, uridine diphosphate; A2PM, diaminopimelic acid;
  G, N-acetylglucosamine; M, N-acetylmuramic acid; PBP, penicillin-binding protein.'
