caption: Plastid and cytoplasmic origins of 1O2. The flu mutant in the dark, or application
  of ALA, leads to the accumulation of chlorophyll metabolites and production of 1O2
  in the cytoplasm in the light. It is currently unknown if the export of these metabolites
  occurs via specialized transport proteins or via membrane leakage. In the cytoplasm,
  1O2 efficiently and selectively oxidizes guanosine residues in RNA that then inhibit
  translation lowering the levels of rapidly turning over repressors of transcription.
  The decrease in repressors will initiate the 1O2 transcriptome signature that resembles
  the transcriptome of CHX, an inhibitor of 80S ribosome translation. The EX1 mutant
  pathway has been shown to attenuate flu-mediated cell death, but how EX1 signals
  are transported outside the chloroplast and elicits nuclear signaling is currently
  unknown. In the light, the ch1 mutant or application of DCMU will induce 1O2 locally
  in the chloroplast and initiate a transcriptome response that is distinct from cytoplasmic
  1O2 (area in grey). It has been shown that BCC can serve as a signaling intermediate
  in the Ch1 mutant and HL stress, but its mechanism of action is currently unknown.
  However, under conditions of high light and cold the increased levels of 1O2 initiate
  chloroplast leakage and production of 1O2 in the cytoplasm leading to a 1O2 transcriptome
  signature of cytoplasmic origin.
