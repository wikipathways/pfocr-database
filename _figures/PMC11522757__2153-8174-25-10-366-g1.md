caption: 'Regulated cell death (RCD) pathways implicated in pathological  cardiac
  hypertrophy. Apoptosis: The intracellular damage signal in the intrinsic  pathway
  releases cytochrome c through mitochondrial outer membrane  permeabilization (MOMP),
  which integrates with apoptotic protease activator  factor-1 (APAF-1) to activate
  caspase-9; Bcl-2 inhibits this process. In the  extrinsic pathway, the death ligand
  binds to the death receptor, forming a  death-inducing signaling complex (DISC),
  which activates caspase-8. These jointly  activate the “executor” function of caspase-3/7
  in apoptosis. Interleukin-18  (IL-18) promotes intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.
  Necroptosis: The interaction  between the death receptor and the membrane receptor
  initiates the death receptor  signal and activates receptor-interacting serine/threonine
  protein kinase 3  (RIPK3). Upon inhibition of the caspase-8 activity, the interaction
  between RIPK1  and RIPK3 leads to the autophosphorylation of RIPK3, further activating
  mixed  lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) and leading to MLKL oligomerization.  RIPK1,
  RIPK3, and MLKL proteins form a necrotic signaling complex, which induces  necroptosis.
  Autophagy: The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian  target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) signaling pathway inhibits downstream Unc-51-like  kinase 1 (ULK1) and ULK2
  to suppress autophagy, and AMP-activated protein kinase  (AMPK) inhibits mTOR to
  promote autophagy. Pyroptosis: Pathogen-linked molecular  patterns (PAMPs) or damage-linked
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) activate the NLR  family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3),
  activating caspase-1. Reactive oxygen  species (ROS) promote NLRP3 activation, and
  caspase-1 hydrolyzes gasdermin D  (GSDMD) to produce GSDMD-C and GSDMD-N. GSDMD-N
  polymerizes on the cell membrane  to form a nonselective membrane pore; caspase-1
  can also cleave IL-1β and  IL-18 into mature IL-1β and IL-18, which are released
  into the  extracellular space to exert an inflammatory response. Ferroptosis: Extracellular  Fe3+
  binds to transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) and is transported to endosomes,  where it
  is reduced to Fe2+. Fe2+ is transported by divalent metal  transporter 1 (DMT1)
  and stored in the labile iron pool in the cytoplasm. Nuclear  receptor coactivator
  4 (NCOA4) can transport ferritin to autophagosomes, where  lysosomes degrade and
  release free iron. Excessive iron accumulation in the cell  generates massive amounts
  of lipid peroxides (LPO) through the Fenton reaction.  Glutathione peroxidase 4
  (GPX4) and glutathione (GSH) can reduce oxidative stress  and negatively regulate
  ferroptosis. SIRT1 inhibits ferroptosis by driving the  upregulation of GPX4 and
  inhibiting ROS. NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; BAX, Bcl-2-associated X
