caption: A paradigm for statin-induced dysregulation of glucose metabolism. (1) Intracellular
  arrival of glucose via glucose transporter (Glut 2 in beta cells) leads to phosphorylation
  by glucokinase and routing to the metabolic pathway. The resulting cascade of closure
  of ATP-dependent potassium channel, depolarization and calcium influx leads to insulin
  secretion; this process may be inhibited by statins [, ]. (2) Glucokinase is inhibited
  by abundance of plasma cholesterol [], and thus is conceivably affected by statin-induced
  inhibition of de novo cholesterol synthesis with increased uptake of plasma LDL.
  (3) Statin inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase suppresses synthesis of ubiquinone (CoQ10),
  an essential factor in the mitochondrial electron-transfer system, resulting in
  inhibition of insulin secretion due to reduced production of ATP. (4) Statin inhibition
  of HMG-CoA reductase suppresses the synthesis of isoprenoids, thus causing down
  regulation of Glut 4 expression on adipocyte cells leading to impaired glucose uptake.
  (5) The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase causes upregulation of LDL receptors leading
  to enhanced uptake of LDL-cholesterol in an effort to replenish intracellular stores.
  However, the intracellular fate of plasma-derived LDL-cholesterol may be distinct
  from that of de novo synthesized cholesterol. (6) The oxidation of LDL-cholesterol
  may incite an inflammatory cascade that compromises the functional, e.g. insulin
  secretion apparatus, and ultimately structural integrity of the islet beta cells.

  shown to induce beta cell apoptosis via the activation of calpain, a calcium-dependent
