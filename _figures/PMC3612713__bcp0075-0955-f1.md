caption: A paradigm for statin-induced dysregulation of glucose metabolism. (1) Intracellular
  arrival of glucose via glucose transporter (Glut 2 in beta cells) leads to phosphorylation
  by glucokinase and routing to the metabolic pathway. The resulting cascade of closure
  of ATP-dependent potassium channel, depolarization and calcium influx leads to insulin
  secretion; this process may be inhibited by statins [, ]. (2) Glucokinase is inhibited
  by abundance of plasma cholesterol [], and thus is conceivably affected by statin-induced
  inhibition of de novo cholesterol synthesis with increased uptake of plasma LDL.
  (3) Statin inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase suppresses synthesis of ubiquinone (CoQ10),
  an essential factor in the mitochondrial electron-transfer system, resulting in
  inhibition of insulin secretion due to reduced production of ATP. (4) Statin inhibition
  of HMG-CoA reductase suppresses the synthesis of isoprenoids, thus causing down
  regulation of Glut 4 expression on adipocyte cells leading to impaired glucose uptake.
  (5) The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase causes upregulation of LDL receptors leading
  to enhanced uptake of LDL-cholesterol in an effort to replenish intracellular stores.
  However, the intracellular fate of plasma-derived LDL-cholesterol may be distinct
  from that of de novo synthesized cholesterol. (6) The oxidation of LDL-cholesterol
  may incite an inflammatory cascade that compromises the functional, e.g. insulin
  secretion apparatus, and ultimately structural integrity of the islet beta cells.
  (7) Furthermore, cytokine-induced over-production of nitric oxide (NO) has been
  shown to induce beta cell apoptosis via the activation of calpain, a calcium-dependent
  protease []. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CHOL, cholesterol (de novo synthesized);
