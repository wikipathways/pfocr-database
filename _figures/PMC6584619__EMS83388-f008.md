caption: 'TGF-β1 ligation of the TGF-β receptor complex leads to a Smad3 dependent
  increase in ATF4 mRNA abundance as well as mTOR activation. Activated mTORC1/4E-BP1
  signaling in turn promotes ATF4 protein production through a translational mechanism.
  ATF4 subsequently promotes the transcriptional increase of SLC2A1/GLUT1 and key
  serine-glycine pathway genes. These then act together to promote glucose-derived
  glycine biosynthesis in order to support enhanced collagen synthesis rates in activated
  myofibroblasts. (TGF-β1: Transforming growth factor β1; mTORC1: mechanistic target
  of rapamycin complex 1; GLUT1: glucose transporter 1; G6P: glucose 6-phosphate;
  3-PG: 3-Phosphoglycerate; PHGDH: phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; 3-PHP: 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate;
  PSAT1: phosphoserine aminotransferase 1; 3PS: 3-phosphoserine; PSPH: phosphoserine
  phosphatase; SHMT2: serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2; OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation).'
