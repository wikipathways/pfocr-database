caption: 'Activation of transmembrane RAGE in COPD. (A) The soluble isoform of receptor
  for advanced glycation endproducts (sRAGE) can arise from (i) alternative mRNA splicing
  or (ii) through ADAM10-mediated proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane isoform.
  (B) Under normal physiological conditions, sRAGE performs as a decoy receptor; ligands
  of RAGE preferentially bind to the soluble isoform, creating a complex that is then
  degraded. Studies in the context of COPD have shown an enhanced expression of transmembrane
  RAGE and its ligands, as well as a decreased concentration of sRAGE. Consequently,
  RAGE ligands are able to bind to their cognate receptor, initiating a downstream
  pathway that eventuates in an inflammatory response. Dia-1, a Rho effector protein,
  is bound to the C-terminal of RAGE and is responsible for activation of a Rho-like
  small GTPase: Rac1. NADPH oxidases (NOXes) signal through Rac1 to generate downstream
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are an intracellular signaling intermediate,
  which increase tyrosine kinase activity and initiate the PI3K/Akt pathway. Activation
  of Akt promotes the nuclear translocation of NFkB and subsequent transcription of
  several genes, including pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-ɑ and interleukin- (IL-)
  1, 2, 6, 8 and 12. Alternative pathways of NFkB initiation are achieved through
  p21/Ras-ERK1/2 or p38 activation. A positive feedback loop is initiated by the NFkB
  transcription of RAGE.'
