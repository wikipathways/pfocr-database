caption: A schematic illustration of the CRC-derived exosome mechanisms for CRC metastasis.
  CRC-derived exosomes represent extracellular vesicles produced by CRC cells that
  transport various substances such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and metabolites
  throughout the tumor microenvironment. These exosomes play a pivotal role in the
  formation of PMNs. Primary tumor cells release exosomes that can disseminate to
  distant metastatic sites and modulate local cells within the pre-metastatic microenvironment
  through diverse signaling pathways, such as upregulation of pro-inflammatory gene
  expression and immunosuppressive cytokine secretion. Moreover, these exosomes also
  participate in regulating the immune response, promoting increased angiogenesis,
  and facilitating cellular epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Their involvement
  is particularly prominent in liver, lung, and peritoneal metastases. In these metastatic
  sites, exosomes act as crucial mediators between cancer cells and the surrounding
  microenvironment, thereby facilitating the reorganization of the secondary site
  to enable successful tumor colonization
