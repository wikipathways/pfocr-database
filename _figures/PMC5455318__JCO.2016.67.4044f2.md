caption: Effects of hyperinsulinemia on the tumor cell microenvironment and intracellular
  signaling that contribute to tumor growth and progression. The schematic depicts
  the potential direct and indirect effects of insulin on tumor growth. Insulin and
  insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2) bind to the two insulin receptor
  (IR) isoforms (IR-A, IR-B), IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and IR/IGF-1R hybrid receptors
  (IR-A/IGF-1R, IR-B/IGF-1R) with different affinities. Solid arrows indicate strong
  affinity for the receptor, and dashed arrows represent weak affinity for the receptor.
  IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP) 1 and 2 are decreased by insulin and may result in
  increased bioavailable IGF-1 and IGF-2. Binding of insulin to IR primarily activates
  the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt–mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling
  pathway. Binding of IGF-1 and IGF-2 to IGF-1R stimulates the PI3K-Akt-mTOR and Ras-Raf-MAPK
  pathways. Increased local production of estrogen may occur as a result of increased
  expression of aromatase, activating estrogen receptor α in tumor cells. Inflammation
  in the tissue microenvironment may also be increased by hyperinsulinemia, which
  leads to local cytokine production and activation the Jak-Stat signaling pathway
  in the tumor. Erk, extracellular regulated kinase; IL, interleukin; IRS1/2, insulin
  receptor substrate; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.
