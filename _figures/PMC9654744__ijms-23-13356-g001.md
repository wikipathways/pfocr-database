caption: 'Overview of the DNA damage repair pathways and their commonly associated
  cancers (clockwise). TOP LEFT: Single-stranded breaks are repaired via either short-patch
  base excision repair (SP-BER) or long-patch BER (LP-BER). BER begins when the DNA
  base is damaged and is excised by the enzyme apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease
  1 (APE1) and further processed by either SP-BER or LP-BER. Polymorphisms in BER
  pathway genes have been linked to an increased risk for the development of lung
  and other cancers. TOP RIGHT: Double-stranded breaks (DSBs) are repaired via homologous
  recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), or microhomology-mediated
  end joining (MMEJ). HR: the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex detects double-stranded
  breaks. NHEJ: the Ku70/80 heterodimer detects and binds to the DSBs. MMEJ: the protein-coding
  gene poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) detects DSB mutations in HR pathway
  genes that are frequently associated with breast and other cancers. BOTTOM RIGHT:
  Nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is activated upon the detection of bulky
  DNA lesions and starts off as either a global genome NER (GG-NER) or a transcription-coupled
  NER (TC-NER). Mutations in TC-NER proteins have been identified in a subset of ovarian
  cancers, conferring increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. BOTTOM
  MIDDLE: Mismatched repair (MMR) pathway is initiated by recruitment and binding
  of the MutLα complex on the damaged site. Mutations in MMR pathway genes are associated
  with colorectal and other cancers. BOTTOM LEFT: In the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway,
  FANCM is first recruited to the site of ICL damage at the stalled replication fork
  along with FAAP24 and the heterodimer MHF1/2, followed by HR pathway mutations in
  FA pathway genes that lead to the Fanconi anemia syndrome characterized by a high
  incidence of childhood leukemias.'
