caption: Possible mechanisms through which major metabolic pathways contribute to
  the milk fat globule (MFG) size development in the mammary epithelial cell. This
  illustration is based on the currently available literature and provides hypothetical
  explanations for the observed differences in milk lipidomic profiles between the
  studied groups. Please note that the precise role of these metabolic pathways has
  not been established. Diacylglycerol (DG) plays a central role and connects phospholipid
  (PL), triacylglycerol (TG) and sphingolipid synthesis pathways. DG is utilised to
  either produce TG or the major PLs, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine
  (PC). TG synthesis is catalysed by the enzyme diacylglycerol-acyltransferase (DGAT),
  in the form of two isoenzymes DGAT1 and DGAT2 which are located in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) or on the surface of lipid droplets (LD), respectively. The synthesis
  of PC and PE is catalysed by DG choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase (CEPT) found
  in the ER. This enzyme also catalyses the production of ether PLs (ePL) by transferring
  a choline or ethanolamine headgroup to alkylacylglycerol (AAG), which is derived
  from peroxisomal production of 1-O-alkyl-glycerol-3-phosphate (AGP). We suggest
  that when DG is more efficiently channelled towards TG synthesis, for example due
  to increased DGAT1 activity, diacyl-PL synthesis could be limited and ePL synthesis
  through CEPT in the ER could present a possible salvage pathway that is not reliant
  on DG as a precursor. This shift towards ePL synthesis could promote LD fusion and
  thus contribute to the large MFG (LMFG) phenotype. In the small MFG (SMFG) phenotype,
  DG could be more efficiently channelled towards PL synthesis, either due to decreased
  DGAT1 activity or possibly due to increased SM synthase 1 (SMS1) activity in the
  Golgi apparatus, although this hypothesis could not be confirmed by the current
  study. SMS1 catalyses the transferal of the choline headgroup from PC to ceramide
  (Cer) to produce SM and DG, thus contributing to the DG pool. Moreover, increased
  SMS1 activity can stimulate PC synthesis. Another potential pathway contributing
  to the SMFG phenotype is the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT)
  pathway, which converts PE into PC and thus increases the PC/PE ratio. The PE used
  in the PEMT pathway is derived mainly through decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine
  (PS) in the mitochondrion by PS decarboxylase (PSD) and results in PC with a higher
  degree of unsaturation. Increased unsaturation within the monolayer surrounding
  the LD and increased PC/PE ratios could prevent LD fusion, resulting in the SMFG
  phenotype. Figure created with BioRender.com.

  description: Possible mechanisms through which major metabolic pathways contribute
