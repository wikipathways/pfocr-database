caption: Coordinated heme biosynthesis in plant nodules. In Lotus japonicus nodules,
  both the plant and its rhizobial partner (Mesorhizobium loti) can make heme through
  a shared biosynthetic pathway that starts with the molecule 5-ALA. The plant produces
  5-ALA from glutamate and tRNAGlu in plastids using glutamyl-tRNA reductases (GluTR1
  and GluTR2), while the rhizobia M. loti generate 5-ALA from glycine and succinyl-CoA
  using 5-aminolevulinate synthases (HemA1 and HemA2). From 5-ALA to heme, the pathway
  is nearly identical in both partners. Evidence suggests that 5-ALA may move from
  the plant to the rhizobia, and that heme could be transported to the cytoplasm,
  but how these molecules are moved between compartments is still unclear. Adapted
