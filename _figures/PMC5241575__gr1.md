caption: 'Schematic model of NO2-Ln signaling. Pathway 1 indicates that NO2-Ln is
  able to induce a defense mechanism through the induction of the chaperone network
  and the increase in the expression of ascorbate peroxidase enzyme. This latter may
  be involved in the alleviation of the oxidative stress generated by the overproduction
  of ROS such as H2O2. Furthermore, NO2-Ln is a NO donor being therefore implicated
  in the wide range of actions in which this molecule is involved (pathway 2). The
  electrophilic ability of this nitro-fatty acid could contribute to the signaling
  actions involving NO2-FAs (pathway 3) and, under nitro-oxidative stress conditions,
  the oxidation of Michael adducts may occur with subsequent nitroalkene release (pathway
  4) and the observed antioxidant properties of these molecules. NO: nitric oxide;
  HSP: heat shock protein; APX: ascorbate peroxidase.'
