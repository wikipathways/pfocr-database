caption: Proposed model outlining the role of PPARδ in the modulation of the radiation-induced
  proinflammatory response in BV-2 cells.  Irradiation of BV-2 cells leads to an increase
  in intracellular ROS generation. This increases activation of the stress-activated
  kinases, PKCα, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2, and the proinflammatory transcription factors,
  NF-κB and AP-1. Activation of NF-κB and AP-1 enhance the expression of Cox-2, MCP-1,
  IL-1β, and TNF-α. PPARδ activation prevents radiation-induced neuroinflammation,
  in part, by transrepression of NF-κB by physical interaction with the p65 subunit.
  Additionally, PPARδ inhibits intracellular ROS generation, which prevents PKCα,
  MEK, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and downstream activation of AP-1.
