caption: Overview of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) signaling
  in Caenorhabditis elegans. Chaperones heat shock protein (HSP)-6, HSP-60 and the
  protease CLPP-1 perform protein quality control in the mitochondria. When unfolded,
  misfolded or unassembled proteins accumulate in the matrix, CLPP-1 cleaves the proteins
  into short peptides, which are exported by the transporter HAF-1 into the cytoplasm
  and thereby inhibit mitochondrial protein import. As a result, the transcription
  factor ATFS-1 cannot be imported into mitochondria for degradation, and therefore
  translocates to the nucleus, where, presumably in a complex with small ubiquitin-like
  protein UBL-5 and homeodomain-containing transcription factor DVE-1, it activates
  the transcription of stress response genes, which reconstitute mitochondrial homeostasis.
  In a complementary pathway, reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated by oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes (I–V) under stress, activate GCN-2 kinase, which
  inhibits cytosolic protein translation by phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), thus reducing the protein-folding load in the mitochondria.
