caption: Role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and related lipids in atherosclerosis①
  HDL ingests excess cholesterol from the vessel wall, enabling reverse cholesterol
  transport (RCT); ② APOA1, the most abundant apolipoprotein on HDL, removes excess
  cellular cholesterol via ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1; ③ APOA1 competes
  with LDL for SR-BI binding and limits SR-B1-mediated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
  deposition in the subarterial lumen; ④ HDL responds to Toll-like receptor (TLR)
  ligands to enhance PCK activation exerting pro-inflammatory effects; ⑤ activation
  of the IRE1α/ASK1/p38 MAPK signaling pathway leads to a pro-inflammatory endoplasmic
  reticulum stress response, resulting in pro-inflammatory effects; ⑥ ApoM-S1P inhibits
  the secretion of IL-1β, TNF-α, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1from human umbilical vein endothelial
  cells (HUVECs) through the S1PR2/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and downregulates the
  expression of inflammatory and adhesion factors; ⑦ S1P loading enhances the anti-inflammatory
  effect of HDL via S1PR2; ⑧ S1P regulates cholesterol outflow in a positive feedback
  manner dependent on S1PR3 via ABCA1 outputs; ⑨ EPA has many functions, including
  inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors through cyclooxygenase (COX),
  decreasing the gene expression of the scavenger receptor SR-A1, reducing the phagocytosis
  of ox-LDL, and further increasing ABCA1 expression, thereby promoting cholesterol
  and phospholipid output
