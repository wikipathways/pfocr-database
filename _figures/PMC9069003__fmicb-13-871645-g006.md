caption: O3 antiviral activity and microbiota. The antiviral action mediated by ozone-derived
  4-HNE leads to the viral load decrease and to a regulated expression of ACE2 on
  the cell membrane, important for the expression of the protein transporter of amino
  acid Trp (B°AT1). This transporter is metabolized by the mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTor) pathway which leads to the production of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP),
  fundamental for immunological tolerance mediated by the regulatory T cells (T-reg).
  This activity results in a regulated expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines,
  such as IL-10 and its pathway, which in turn affects the intestinal microbiota leading
  to greater tolerance and therefore to a higher microbiome biodiversity. Inside the
  gut, both the dendritic cells and M Cells, which are some specialized epithelial
  cells, play a role in recognizing commensal or pathogenic bacteria. In the presence
  of commensal bacteria, dendritic cells secrete IL-23, stimulating the differentiation
  of T-naive into T-reg cells which in turn produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine
  IL-10. Finally, the ozone, could favor tissue repair by restoring macrophages M2
  switching. Modified from .
