caption: Schematic illustration of the hormonal pathways activated by  in response
  to low  growth conditions. Under conditions of  depletion, and in response to endogenous  concentrations,
  the  pathway, through MAX2, is suggested to activate TIR1 expression and the auxin
  signaling pathway, and thereby regulate root development to suit those growth conditions.
  Another possibility is that there could also be a parallel pathway to TIR1 that
  involves , in a MAX2-independent pathway, which leads to partial low  response at
  early stages. However, evidence is found to the existence of other pathways that
  are MAX2 independent, which may dominate low  response during later stages of development.
