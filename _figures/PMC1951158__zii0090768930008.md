caption: Model of the effect of CpxR-P on rovA and inv expression. Activated CpxA
  acts as a kinase phosphorylating CpxR (+P). CpxR-P can then bind directly to rovA
  and inv control regions to ultimately repress transcription (line with a horizontal
  bar). When homeostasis is achieved, CpxR-P is quenched by the intrinsic phosphatase
  activity of CpxA (−P). This relieves the repression, allowing the production of
  an elevated level of RovA that, in turn, activates its own synthesis, as well as
  that of invasin (line with arrows). However, in the absence of CpxA, CpxR-P levels
  will remain high, forcing continued repression of inv and rovA transcription. This
  may even be further amplified by the CpxA-independent phosphorylation of CpxR via
  second-messenger phosphodonors such as acetyl phosphate (acetyl∼P) (indicated by
  a question mark). Cpx system activation also diminishes efficient T3S by yersiniae
  by an undisclosed mechanism (dotted line) (). Additionally, the production of surface-located
  organelles can affect the activity of other similarly located virulence determinants,
  but such a connection between invasin and Ysc-Yop T3S remains unexplored (also indicated
  by a question mark).
