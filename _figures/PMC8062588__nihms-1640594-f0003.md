caption: 'Mechanisms of therapy resistance in CSCs. ABC transporters: ABC transporters
  reduce the effective concentration of cytokines and administered chemotherapeutics
  in the cytoplasm. Microenvironment/Hippo: The tumor microenvironment (increased
  EMT, hypoxic conditions, inhibited Hippo pathway) contributes to increased stemness
  of CSCs. Epigenome: Instability of chromatin and changes in epigenetic modulators
  allow for phenotypic differentiation of CSCs. Exosomes: Exosomes promote a CSC phenotype
  in normal tumor cells by transporting MDR transport proteins to recipient drug sensitive
  cells. DNA damage repair (DDR): An increased DDR is observed in CSCs due to overexpression
  of proteins involved in repairing DNA damage (PARP-1, BRCA1, RAD 50, etc.). UPR/ERS:
  Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is characterized by presence of misfolded protein
  in the ER lumen. The unfolded protein response (UPR) signal transduction pathway
  which balances the ER protein folding is disturbed in the presence of certain physiological
  conditions (hypoxia, TME, unstable genome). Autophagy: Autophagy has been shown
  to increase CSC survival and aggressiveness by improving stress tolerance. Metabolism:
  CSCs can efficiently adapt metabolic pathways or switch pathways to maintain an
  energy source. This makes them thrive in adverse conditions and imparts resistance
  to most conventional anti-cancer treatments. Apoptosis evasion: CSCs evade apoptosis
  by regulating (or altering) apoptotic genes during transcription, translation or
  even post-translation. Figure adapted from []'
