caption: Schematic illustrating mechanisms of SR-A intracellular signaling. SR-A does
  not contain an intracellular activating signal sequence; therefore, SR-A interacts
  with other signaling and transport proteins to promote activation of cell signaling
  pathways. SR-A interacts with TLR4 to signal through activation of NFκB, which enters
  the nucleus, binds DNA, and results in the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and
  a pro-death state. SR-A binds to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and is then transported
  to endosomes. There it associates with TLR3, which signals to interferon regulating
  factor 3 (IRF3), resulting in translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus. There, it binds
  to DNA and mediates interferon beta (IFNβ) synthesis, resulting in a pro-survival
  state. SR-A also associates with TLR9 and activates the NFκB pathway, similar to
  the SR-A-TLR4 association, leading to a pro-death state. After binding to the SR-A
  ligand fucoidan, the SR-A–fucoidan complex associates with major vault protein (MVP),
  which is internalized into the cell. There, it signals via the p38 and c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) pathways, leading to a pro-death state. In the presence of sepsis and
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the intracellular signaling shifts the balance
  from pro-survival to pro-death.
