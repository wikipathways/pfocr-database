caption: Population data analyses have identified several risk factors for sebaceous
  carcinoma, which are listed in the above figure. The highly elevated risk for sebaceous
  carcinoma among immunosuppressed populations (solid organ transplant recipients;
  individuals with HIV infection), which is similar to the elevation observed for
  other virus-associated cancers (Kaposi sarcoma; Merkel cell carcinoma), suggests
  that sebaceous carcinoma may also be caused by a virus. In addition to causing cancer
  in immunosuppressed patients (pathway A), an oncogenic virus could also promote
  tumorigenesis in immunocompetent patients (pathway B). Among individuals with Muir-Torre
  syndrome, higher ambient ultraviolet radiation exposure is associated with an increased
  risk for sebaceous carcinoma in addition to being an independent risk factor for
  this cancer type.
