caption: Molecular mechanisms of FGFR3 signaling in cartilage. Aberrant activation
  of FGFR3 alters chondrocyte behaviour by inducing premature growth arrest, loss
  of extracellular matrix, altered differentiation and changes in cell shape. Together,
  these cellular phenotypes (grey arrows) contribute to profound disruption of the
  growth plate cartilage resulting in skeletal dysplasia. At the molecular level,
  the growth arrest phenotype is mediated by induction of several inhibitors of the
  cell cycle, belonging to cip/kip family (p21) or INK4 family (p16, p18, p19), whereas
  the loss of the extracellular matrix originates from both inhibition of production
  of major matrix components (collagen type II and aggrecan), and active matrix degradation,
  mediated by several members of matrix metalloproteinase family (MMP). Expression
  of two important physiological regulators of chondrocyte differentiation, Indian
  hedgehog (Ihh) and parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP), is inhibited by
  FGFR3 in cartilage, likely contributing to impaired chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation.
  ERK MAP kinase is a major pathway for growth arrest, extracellular matrix loss and
  impaired chondrocyte differentiation. FGFR3 causes prolonged activation of the ERK
  signaling module (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK), mediated by adapter (GAB1, FRS2 and SHC)-driven
  recruitment of SHP2-GRB2-SOS1 complexes to the cell membrane, where they activate
  RAS. In addition, SNAIL1 transcription factor is involved in regulation of FGFR3-mediated
  ERK activity, although the exact nature of this regulation is not presently clear
  (question marks). The FGFR3-mediated activation of the ERK pathway is antagonized
  by CNP signaling, which inhibits ERK pathway by inactivation of RAF kinase, via
  inhibitory phosphorylation mediated by cGMP-activated protein kinase (PKG). Some
  FGFR3 mutants also activate STAT1, possibly via direct phosphorylation at Y701.
  It is, however, currently unclear whether activated STAT1 or other STATs induce
  cell cycle inhibitor expression in cartilage, thereby contributing to the FGFR3-mediated
  growth arrest (question mark). Finally, chronic activation of FGFR3 leads to inhibition
  of canonical cytokine-STAT signaling in chondrocytes, via both induction of SOCS
  inhibitors of cytokine signaling and inhibition of expression of receptors for IL6
  (IL6Rα) or LIF (LIFR). As the latter cytokines represent positive regulators of
  chondrocyte proliferation, their inhibition might contribute to the pathological
  effects of FGFR3. NPR-B - natriuretic peptide receptor B/guanylyl cyclase B; GTP
  - guanosine-5′-triphosphate; cGMP - cyclic guanosine monophosphate; gp130 - glycoprotein
  130.
