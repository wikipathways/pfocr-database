caption: Pressure overload inhibits VCP in cardiomyocytes, reduces VCP's activation
  of mTORC2 signaling pathway and its inhibitory effect on mTORC1 signaling pathway,
  and ultimately leads to increased protein synthesis and cell apoptosis; However,
  overexpression of VCP can effectively restored the activation of mTORC2 signaling
  pathway and inhibited mTORC1 signaling pathway, and resisting myocardial hypertrophy
  caused by pressure overload.
