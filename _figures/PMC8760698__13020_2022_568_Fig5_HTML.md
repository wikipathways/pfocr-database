caption: Mechanisms of natural medicines for PAH treatment. The green box represented
  the modulatory effects of natural medicines for PAH in signalling pathway. The white
  box indicated that the confirmed pathways, proteins and phenomenon could trigger
  PAH. For example, the natural medicines downregulated HIF-1α pathway to inhibit
  oxidation stress response against PAH. Upregulation of BMPR2/Smad by natural medicines
  could reverse that the low expression of BMPR2 induced development of PAH. Evidently,
  the NO related pathways influenced the balance of ET-1 and NO for promoting PAH.
  The inflammation signalling pathways in PAH mainly refered to p38 MAPK, ERK MAPK,
  NF-κB p65, NLRP3, HMGB1 pathways. The PPARγ/PI3K/AKT, TGF-β-Smad3, PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  et al. signalling pathways regulated the proliferation of vascular cell in PAH.
  Moreover, the related signalling pathways of migration, apoptosis, and autophagy
  also were testified in PAH. Thus, the modulatory effects on specific pathways of
  natural medicines for PAH were clearly showed in the figure
