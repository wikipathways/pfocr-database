caption: Network representation of the identification process and resulting repurposed
  compounds, as proposed by the DR platform(A) Schematic representation of the repurposed
  compounds identification process.(B) The target pathways depicted in blue in the
  center of the graph belong at the intersection of the “Clinical Data Pathway Group”
  and “Steatogenic Compounds Pathway Group”. The differentially expressed genes (DE-Gs)
  and the pathways affected by each compound are illustrated in gray circles. Each
  steatosis-inducing compound was used as a “signature question” to cMap. The cMap
  tool compares two-sample distributions using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistical
  test and calculates an Enrichment Score that takes values in the interval [-1,1].
  ES > 0 signifies that two drugs present similar gene signature, while ES < 0 means
  that two drugs have reverse gene signatures. The steatosis-inducing compounds are
  depicted in rectangles of different colors. Every steatosis-inducing compound drugs
  with ES > 0 or ES < 0 is illustrated with rectangles of the same color scale. Lines
  connect each compound and drug with their target genes and the pathways they affect.
