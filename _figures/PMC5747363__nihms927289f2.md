caption: Molecular targets of and mechanisms of resistance to major antimalarial drugs.
  Frequently targeted biological pathways include heme detoxification in the digestive
  vacuole, folate and pyrimidine biosynthesis in the cytosol, and electron transport
  in the mitochondrion. The 4- aminoquinolines, including CQ and AQ, as well as PPQ,
  the Mannich base pyronaridine (PND), and to some degree the aryl-amino alcohol quinine
  (QN), are all thought to concentrate in the digestive vacuole, where they bind reactive
  heme and interfere with its detoxification through incorporation into chemically
  inert hemozoin. Ferrous (Fe2+) iron-heme—liberated after parasite protease-mediated
  degradation of imported host hemoglobin (Hb)—can cleave and thereby activate the
  endoperoxide bridge of ART derivatives (star symbol). Point mutations (pink circles)
  in the transporters PfCRT and PfMDR1 are important determinants of resistance to
  4-aminoquinolines. Resistance to PPQ is associated with increased expression of
  the hemoglobinases plasmepsin 2 and 3 (PM2/PM3, in the digestive vacuole), and might
  in some instances involve mutant PfCRT. Copy-number changes in pfmdr1, as well as
  PfCRT and PfMDR1 sequence variants, also affect the parasite’s susceptibility to
  the aryl-amino alcohols quinine (QN), lumefantrine (LMF) and mefloquine (MFQ) and
  can modulate ART potency. Variant forms of K13, thought to localize at the ER and
  in vesicular structures, are the primary mediator of ring-stage parasite resistance
  to ART. Mutations in two key enzymes of the folate biosynthesis pathway, dihydropteroate
  synthetase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), can confer resistance respectively
  to the antifolates sulfadoxine (SDX) and both pyrimethamine (PYR) and cycloguanil
  (CYC). Atovaquone (ATQ) inhibits mitochondrial electron transport, and a single
  point mutation in the cytochrome b subunit (CYTb) of the bc1 complex can confer
  resistance to this drug. The ETC is important in ABS parasites because of its role
  in providing electrons for the ubiquinone-dependent dihydroorotate dehydrogenase
  (DHODH), an enzyme essential for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Antibiotics such
  as clindamycin (CLD) and doxycycline (DOX) inhibit protein translation inside the
  apicoplast. CLD resistance is mediated by a point mutation in the apicoplast-encoded
  23S rRNA.
