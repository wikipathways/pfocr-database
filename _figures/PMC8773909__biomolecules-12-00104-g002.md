caption: Effect of the different SCFAs on the different receptors in pancreatic beta
  cells regulating insulin secretion. Both GPR43 and GPR41 are GPCRs acting through
  two alternative pathways; Gαq and with the concomitant activation of phospholipase
  C (PLC) with the hydrolysis of PIP2 into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate
  (IP3). DAG is able to activate protein kinase C (PKC) and IP3 goes to the endoplasmic
  reticulum to stimulate IP3 receptors and permit Ca2+ exit to the cytosol, where
  it can activate PKC. This signaling pathway activates insulin secretion. However,
  the alternative pathway, through Gαi is able to inactivate adenylate cyclase, decreasing
  the level of cAMP, not permitting the activation of protein A (PKA) which facilitates
  insulin secretion. Then, GPR43 has alternative signaling and GPR41 presents an inhibitory
  effect on insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. Furthermore, it is represented
  in the figure the differential ligand preference of SCFAs to the two different receptors.
