caption: Distinct cysteine protease and subtilisin-like protease pathways participate
  in proneuropeptide processing []. The cysteine proteases cathepsin L and human-specific
  cathepsin V in secretory vesicles functions as a processing enzyme for the production
  of neuropeptides. Human cathepsin L and cathepsin V cleave at dibasic residue sites
  within the pro-neuropeptide. Subsequence to cathepsins L and V, an aminopeptidase
  is needed to remove N-terminal basic residues, and carboxypeptidase E (CPE) removes
  C-terminal basic residues to generate active neuropeptides. The subtilisin-like
  protease pathway involves the proprotein convertases PC1/3 and PC2. The PC enzymes
  preferentially cleave at the C-terminal side of dibasic processing sites, which
  results in peptide intermediates with basic residue extensions at their C-termini
  that are removed by carboxypeptidase E.In mammalian species other than human, cathepsin
  L with the PC1/3 and PC2 proteases participate in neuropeptide production.
