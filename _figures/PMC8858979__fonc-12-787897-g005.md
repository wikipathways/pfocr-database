caption: Sketch map depicting the role of AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) in
  patients with gallbladder cancer (GBC). We propose that in ARID1A-activated GBC,
  the relatively low expression of PD-L1 allows tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
  to function normally and perform immune surveillance. In ARID1A-inactivated GBC,
  the upregulation of PD-L1 in tumor cells might lead to immune evasion in the tumor
  microenvironment via the PD1/PD-L1 pathway.
