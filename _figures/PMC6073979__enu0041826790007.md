caption: Schematic illustration of E2-ERβ signaling in GnRH neurons at proestrus afternoon
  and its proposed action on presynaptic GABA and glutamate release. E2 activates
  the phosphorylation of neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) via ERβ and the Src/PI3K/Akt
  signal transduction pathway resulting in increased NO production. NO then binds
  to its receptor, sGC, which is present in both GABAergic and glutamatergic afferent
  boutons of GnRH neurons. The process increases the release of GABA and glutamate
  that facilitates the activity of GnRH neurons via GABAA-R and AMPA/kainate-R.
