caption: 'Targeting the IDO pathway. (A) The schematic representation of the effect
  of IDO1 on immune system cells of TME. IDO1 inhibits immune responses through several
  mechanisms, including the depletion of the essential amino acid tryptophan and the
  overproduction of kynurenine. The tryptophan depletion can inhibit T-cell proliferation
  arresting the cell progression cycle. In addition to the depletion of tryptophan,
  the accumulation of kynurenine exerts also immunosuppressive effects through the
  promotion of the differentiation of FOXP3+ Tregs, the decrease in the immunogenicity
  of DCs, and the inhibition of T effector cell. Thus, IDO1 represents a driver of
  tumor-mediated suppression. (B) The IDO1 pathway inhibition directly acts on the
  modulation of both innate and adaptive immune system in TME. Thus, the IDO1 inhibition
  can potentially turn these “cold” tumors into “hot” tumors. Abbreviations: IDO1,
  indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MDSC, myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells; TCR, T-cell receptor; Tregs, regulatory T cells.'
