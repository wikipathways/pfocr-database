  routes and enzyme activities involved in auxin biosynthesis are represented as in  with
  focus on the expression of corresponding co-orthologues, genes identified in the
  tomato genome. Relative transcript levels in different tissues and developmental

  corresponds to the presentation of expression data in . Genes coding for enzyme
  activities not yet identified in tomato are indicated by question mark. Color intensities
