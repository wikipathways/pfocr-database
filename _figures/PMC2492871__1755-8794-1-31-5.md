caption: Networks top-ranked by Ingenuity Pathway analysis after knockdown of LSR1
  (A-B). Coloured genes are upregulated (yellow) or downregulated (blue) more than
  2-fold. "Focus genes" (bold) were defined as genes with a mean log ratio of ≥ |1|
  compared to mock transfected cells. The horizontal lines separate different cellular
  compartments.
