caption: Potential synergy between GPCR antagonists and Gβγ–SNARE inhibitors. Potential
  mechanism for a synergistic relationship between existing Gi/o-coupled GPCR antagonists
  (orange) used clinically to inhibit release presynaptically and hypothetical to-be-developed
  inhibitors of the Gβγ–SNARE interaction (yellow). The usage of two different inhibitors
  acting on different targets within the same pathway should more potently drive release
  than either drug used alone and may permit lower concentrations of antagonist to
  be utilized, minimizing potential side effects from specificity.

  description: Potential synergy between GPCR antagonists and Gβγ–SNARE inhibitors.
    Potential mechanism for a synergistic relationship between existing Gi/o-coupled
    GPCR antagonists (orange) used clinically to inhibit release presynaptically and
    hypothetical to-be-developed inhibitors of the Gβγ–SNARE interaction (yellow).
    The usage of two different inhibitors acting on different targets within the same
    pathway should more potently drive release than either drug used alone and may
