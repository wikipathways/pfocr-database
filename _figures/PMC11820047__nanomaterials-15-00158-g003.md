caption: An overview of the EGFR signaling pathway. Upon binding of specific ligands,
  EGFR undergoes dimerization and phosphorylation, leading to the activation of downstream
  signaling cascades and resulting in enhanced tumor growth, invasion and metastasis.
  Some of the main activated pathways include PI3K/AKT, RAS/MAPK, and JAK/STAT, which
  cross-regulate and interact, contributing to cell proliferation, migration and survival.
