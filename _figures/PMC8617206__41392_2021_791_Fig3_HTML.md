caption: 'Activation and negative regulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Black
  arrows indicate the activation process. Red dotted arrows indicated negative regulation.
  Activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway: (1) cytokines and growth factors bind
  to their corresponding receptors, leading to receptor dimerization and recruitment
  of related JAKs; (2) JAK activation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors
  and formation of docking sites for STAT; (3) STATs are phosphorylated by tyrosine;
  (4) STATs dissociate from the receptor to form homodimers or heterodimers; (5) STAT
  dimers enter the nucleus, bind to DNA, and regulate transcription. Negative regulation
  of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway: There are three main types of proteins involved
  in the negative regulation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway: the PIAS (protein
  inhibitor of activated STAT), CIS/SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) family,
  and PTPs (protein tyrosine phosphatase). PIAS mainly interacts with STAT dimers
  to inhibit STAT binding to DNA, thereby blocking JAK/STAT signal transduction. The
  CIS/SOCS family negatively regulates the JAK/STAT pathway in three ways: (1) binding
  to a tyrosine kinase receptor to block the recruitment of STAT; (2) binding directly
  to JAK to inhibit its kinase activity; (3) forming an elongin B/C-cullin5 complex
  that degrades JAK or STAT bound to the SOCS protein through polyubiquitination and
  proteasome degradation. PTPs inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway by interacting with JAK,
  STAT, or receptors to (1) dephosphorylate the STAT dimer; (2) interact with the
  receptor to dephosphorylate the related JAK; and (3) in the case of CD45 (a transmembrane
  PTP) inhibits the phosphorylation of JAK. Created with BioRender.com'
