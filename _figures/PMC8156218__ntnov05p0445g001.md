caption: The role of PTX3 in urinary tract infection. In the early phase of urinary
  tract infection, E.coli stimulates neutrophils releasing vesicles which enter the
  extracellular environment and release of PTX3. One part of PTX3 participate in constructing
  extracellular DNA fibrillary networks. Additional part of PTX3 inhibit neutrophils
  binding P-selectin and combine with E.coli to promote the processes of microbial
  recognition, phagocytosis, phagosome maturation, as well as complement cascade activation,
  so do PTX3 produced by the urothelial cells via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway.
