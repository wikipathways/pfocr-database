caption: PolyQ-HTT impairs autophagy. (a) Nutrient deprivation induces macroautophagy,
  whereas activated mTOR acts as a major suppressor of this pathway. Upon nutrient
  deprivation, ROCK1 promotes autophagy by phosphorylating Beclin-1, a key regulator
  of autophagy. Beclin-1 orchestrates recruitment of additional ATG proteins required
  for autophagosome formation. The first stage of macroautophagy is formation of the
  double-membraned autophagosome. Small membrane structures called isolation membranes
  elongate and surround proteins or organelles destined for degradation. LC3 complexes
  associate with the isolation membrane early in autophagy. LC3 aids cargo sequestration
  through interaction with p62, a receptor essential for targeting polyubiquitinated
  cargo to the autophagosome. Autophagosomes colocalize with HTT and HAP1, enabling
  dynein-mediated retrograde transport toward the lysosome-enriched cell body. ATG4B
  cleaves LC3 from the outer autophagosome membrane, allowing fusion with lysosomes
  and cargo degradation by hydrolytic enzymes. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)
  acts upon protein substrates that contain pentapeptide amino-acid targeting sequences
  biochemically related to KFERQ. Chaperones, including HSC70, deliver misfolded proteins
  to lysosomes, where a membrane receptor complex containing lysosome-associated membrane
  protein 2 A (LAMP2A) recognizes and translocates cargo into the lysosomal lumen
  for degradation. (b) PolyQ-HTT impairs autophagy pathways through aberrant protein
  interactions. PolyQ-HTT sequesters mTOR, increasing autophagy induction. PolyQ-HTT
  sequesters Beclin-1, impairing autophagosome formation. PolyQ-HTT binds p62, disrupting
  LC3 interaction and causing cargo recognition defects with assembly of empty autophagosomes.
  PolyQ-HTT disrupts retrograde microtubule-based transport through interaction with
  HAP1 and dynein/dynactin. Autophagosome transport to the cell body is hindered,
  resulting in formation of fewer autolysosomes and decreasing overall autophagic
  degradation. CMA is also impaired in HD; polyQ-HTT sequesters the HSC70 chaperone
  that is important for transporting cargo to lysosomes. PolyQ-HTT also directly interacts
  with LAMP2A of the lysosomal membrane translocation complex, preventing the transport
  of cargo into lysosomes
