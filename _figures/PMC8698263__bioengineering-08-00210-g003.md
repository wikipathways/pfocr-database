caption: 'Simplified structured reaction pathway in E. coli for glycolysis (after
  Maria []), and for the TRP synthesis (the gray area) (after Maria et al. [,,]).
  This reaction pathway was used by Maria et al. [,] to derive a TRP synthesis kinetic
  model. Connection of the TRP synthesis to glycolysis is realized through the PEP
  node [,]. The modular model structure also includes the synthesis of adenosine cometabolites
  ATP, ADP, and AMP, as part of the ATP recovery system (the pink rectangle in the
  figure). Notations: GLC(ex)= glucose in the cell environment. Species abbreviations
  are given in the abbreviations list. Species in parenthesis are not explicitly included
  in the glycolysis model. Italic letters denote the enzymes. Squares include notations
  of enzymatic reactions V1–V6 included in the glycolysis model ( and ). Adapted from
  [] with the courtesy of CABEQ Jl., and completed according to the Maria [] kinetic
  model.'
