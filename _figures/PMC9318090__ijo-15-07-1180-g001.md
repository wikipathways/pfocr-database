caption: 'In the process of DR, VEGF acts as a core molecule, and is mainly induced
  by hypoxia. Hypoxia increases the expression of HIF and other growth factors (such
  as bFGF and PDGF), thereby increasing the transcription of the VEGF gene, translating
  more VEGF and secreting it out of the cell. Subsequently, VEGF is combined with
  VEGFR of the target cell (mainly via VEGFR2 in DR), and it performs physiological
  effect mainly through three ways: PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, PLC/PIP2 signaling
  pathway and MAPK signaling pathway. These pathways subsequently activate nuclear
  transcription factors and thereby changing gene expression, which ultimately leads
  to cell proliferation and vascular proliferation. In addition, VEGFR can also activate
  Paxillin through the FAK pathway, eventually leading to rearrangement of the cytoskeleton
  and cell migration. VEGF: Vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR: Vascular endothelial
  growth factor receptor; DR: Diabetic retinopathy; HIF: Hypoxia-inducible factor;
  bFGF: Basic fibroblast growth factor; PDGF: Platelet derived growth factor; MAPK:
  Mitogen-activated protein kinase.'
