caption: 'Antiviral IFN stimulation and the effect on energy and lipid metabolism.
  Counteracting viral infections, which seize the cell energy and lipid metabolism
  for viral production but enhance fatty acid (FA) and cholesterol synthesis, effective
  IFN response leads to an antiviral state through an IFN autocrine or paracrine regulatory
  loop. The induction of antiviral state is accompanied by a general arrest of protein
  and lipid metabolism. The IFN suppression of lipid metabolism is multifaceted such
  as directly repressing the synthesis of FA and cholesterol, and regulating via the
  upstream regulators of AMPK and mTOR complex. In addition, IFNs have been also implicated
  in the regulation of glycolysis, TCA cycle, and cholesterol transport to facilitate
  cell antiviral response. Taking together, the effective IFN response, especially
  that during acute phases of antiviral responses, is unlikely to induce obesity and
  meta-inflammation underlying obesity; however, the prolonged IFN responses during
  chronic viral infections might be an adipogenic drive in an opposite way (). Abbreviations:
