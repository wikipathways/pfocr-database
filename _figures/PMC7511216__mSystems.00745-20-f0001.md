caption: 'Alternative assimilation pathways of d-arabitol with an example of the measured
  and expected labeling of Rib5P. Arabitol entry point into the metabolism is expected
  to be Ribu5P or Xyl5P, depending on the substrate specificity of the PTS system
  and arabitol phosphate dehydrogenase. Taking [5-13C]arabitol as an example, we show
  that the labeling of downstream metabolites can be used to identify which pathway
  is operating in vivo (Ribu5P, orange; Xyl5P, blue). We exemplify our approach with
  one data point: the NMR-specific enrichment of Rib5P and the associated estimates
  from the best fit of different scenarios in which PTS1 or PTS5 are allowed to carry
  flux in the model (bar plot). Unlike the others, the model in which only PTS5 was
  allowed to carry flux did not fit the data (red cross mark [✘]). Circles are carbon
  atoms: solid for 13C (●), empty for 12C (○), dotted when irrelevant.'
