caption: Lipid metabolism in GBM cells. (1) Glucose uptake contributes to the synthesis
  of N-glycan (2), which stabilizes SCAP. (3) SCAP facilitates the activation of SREBP,
  which translocates to the nucleus (4) to stimulate the expression of lipogenesis
  genes. (5) Glutamine is imported inside the cell and its metabolism produces glutamate
  and ammonium (NH₄⁺). (6) Ammonium binds to SCAP transmembrane domains, triggering
  a conformation change. Consequently, SCAP induces translocation of SREBP from the
  endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi where it releases its active N-terminal fragment.
  The N-terminal domain goes into the nucleus, binds to the SRE to activate lipogenesis
  genes transcription. This regulation integrates signals from both glucose and glutamine
  metabolism to ensure efficient lipogenesis, which is critical for GBM growth and
  survival. (7) EGFR activation initiates the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, (8) which
  reinforces SREBP activity and drives lipogenesis. (9) GBM hypoxic environment upregulates
  SREBP, leading to an increase in lipogenesis genes. (10) LDL uptake via LDLR increases
  cholesterol levels but suppresses cholesterol synthesis through LXR inactivation.
  (11) ELOVL2 upregulation in GBM promotes the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated
  fatty acids and supports lipid droplet storage. SCAP, SREBP cleavage-activating
  protein; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; SRE, sterol regulatory
  element; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PI3K/Akt, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein
  kinase B; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; LDLR, LDL receptor; LXR, liver X receptor;
