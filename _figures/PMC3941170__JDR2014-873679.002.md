caption: '(a) Cell cycle regulation by p16Ink4b/p14ARF. p16Ink4b inhibits CDK4/6 activity,
  preventing RB phosphorylation, thus preventing G1/S transition. Inactivation of
  CDK4/6 promotes Rb/E2F1 association down-regulating transcription of E2F1 target
  genes, which would trigger G1/S transition. p14ARF inhibits MDM2 activity thereby
  stabilizing p53 and promoting beta cell senescence. (b) Regulation of beta cell
  Cdkn2a locus. Binding of PRC1 and PRC2 complex proteins to the p16/p14ARF promoter
  results in formation of heterochromatin leading to suppression of transcription.
  HDACs also repress Cdkn2a locus but they conform a regulatory feedback loop: release
  of E2F1 which up-regulates p14ARF leading to an inhibition of Mdm2 and inducing
  senescence through p21-p53 pathway. Betatrophin promotes beta cell proliferation
  by inhibiting Cdkn2a and increasing expression levels of cyclins and E2F1 (through
  a still unknown mechanism). lncRNA ANRIL, transcribed from the Cdkn2a locus, directly
  binds to the p16Ink4b transcript and also recruits the PRC complexes to repress
  the transcription of genes at this locus. ANRIL is induced by E2F1 after DNA damage.
  (c) Cdkn2a locus showing exons of p16Ink4b/p14ARF genes involved in alternate splicing.
  Promoter regions are shown in green.'
