caption: (A). The dysfunction of SIRT2 and SIRT3 in aged HSCs finally leads to HSC
  vulnerability. In aging HSCs, the activity of SIRT2 is decreased, resulting in an
  increase in NLRP3 inflammasome activity. In turn, the decrease in SIRT3 activity
  results in damage to HSCs due to ROS accumulation. (B). The main effects of SIRT4
  in SC aging. SIRT4 dysfunction can affect the cellular functions outlined above.
  (C). SIRT5 upregulation mediated by CXCR4 via JAK2 can rescue normal mitochondrial
  function in ESCs. (D). SIRT6-mediated epigenetic regulatory functions in SCs. TET1/2
  inhibition via Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog may affect neuroectodermal differentiation.
  Inhibition of Wnt target molecules may regulate the self-renewal capacity of HSCs.
  Stimulation of NRF2 target molecules may enhance the stress resistance of MSCs.
  (E). SIRT7 deletion enhances the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in bone marrow
  by elevating H3K18ac levels at the promoter of the OSX transcription factor and
  activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This figure was partly created with
