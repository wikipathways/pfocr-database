    Ghrelin promotes differentiation of ADMSCs into cardiomyocyte via activation of
    the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. DDX17, an upregulated differentially expressed gene
    after ghrelin treatment, promotes nuclear translocation of β-catenin and inhibits
    protein expression of SFRP4. DDX17 is involved in ghrelin-induced cardiomyocyte
    differentiation of ADMSCs, which is associated with regulation of the SFRP4/Wnt/β-catenin
