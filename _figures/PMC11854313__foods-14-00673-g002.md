caption: Biosynthetic pathway of terpenoids. (a) Natural and non-natural upstream
  pathways for the C5 unit precursors isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl
  diphosphate (DMAPP). Mevalonate pathway (MVA pathway) in yeast and animal cells
  utilizes acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) as the starting substrate, while methylerythritol 4-phosphate
  pathway (MEP pathway) in gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotic organelles uses 3-phosphoglycerate
  (G3P) and pyruvate as the starting substrates. In the non-natural isopentenol utilization
  pathway (IUP), IPP and DMAPP can be synthesized by sequential phosphorylation steps
  using isopentenol isomers isoprenol and prenol as precursors. (b) Carbon-chain elongation
  pathway. IPP and DMAPP are condensed to form C10, C15, C20, and other longer terpenoid
  precursors for monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, sesterterpenes, triterpenes,
  and tetraterpenes. (c) The biosynthesis of stevioside is presented as an example
  to demonstrate terpenoid synthesis. C5 building blocks condensed to form GGPP as
  the precursor of diterpenes, then terpene synthases or cyclases helped to form the
  terpene skeleton, followed by the modification step, such as oxidation and glycosylation
