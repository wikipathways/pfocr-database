caption: Overview of Hedgehog signaling pathway in normal and basal cell carcinoma
  cells. (a) The Hedgehog signaling pathway is activated when Hedgehog binds the PATCHED
  (PATCH) receptor. This relieves the inhibition on SMO by PATCH. By sending signals
  through a series of interacting proteins, including suppressor of fused (SUFU),
  SMO activates the downstream GLI family of transcription factors. (b) In BCC cells,
  SMO activating mutations or PATCH loss of function mutations amplify GLI transcriptional
  activity and promote the constitutive activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway.
  (c) Non-canonical activation of GLI-mediated transcription in vismodegib-resistant
  basal cell carcinoma cell. TGFβ and AP-1 signaling pathways promote ARHGEF17 expression
  that activates RHOA. By promoting actin polymerization, RHOA induces the translocation
  of MRTF in the nucleus and the formation of the MRTF-SRF complex that acts as a
  transcriptional cofactor for GLI to regulate a subset of target genes and to mediate
  resistance of the BCC cells to treatment. Created with BioRender.com, accessed on
