caption: A coronin 2A-dependent LXR transrepression pathway in macrophages. LXR ligands
  can trigger either conventional activation of direct LXR target genes (e.g., Abca1,
  Abcg1) or alternative SUMOylation-dependent transrepression of LPS/TLR4 response
  genes (e.g., Nos2, Il1b, Ccl2). LXRs are specifically modified by SUMO-2/3 (SU)
  at the ligand-binding domain, which requires the common E2-conjugating enzyme UBC9
  and the putative SUMO E3 ligase HDAC4. SUMOylated LXR enters the transrepression
  pathway by docking to the NCoR corepressor complex at the promoters of LPS/TLR4
  response genes. Docking occurs via specific binding of SU to the C-terminal SIM
  of CORO2A, thereby preventing actin-dependent derepression and activation steps
  of inflammatory response genes. Transrepressive LXR can be “inactivated” by deSUMOylation,
  which requires a sequence of events that are initiated by activation of CaMKII (for
  example via TLR2 signaling), causing LXR phosphorylation and subsequent recruitment
  of the SUMO protease SENP3. LXR SUMOylation and the connected transrepression pathway
  are thus reversible and dynamically regulated in a signal-dependent manner. Highlighted
  (in red) are the uncovered new aspects of the transrepression pathway in mouse macrophages
  with an emphasis on the LXRβ subtype.
