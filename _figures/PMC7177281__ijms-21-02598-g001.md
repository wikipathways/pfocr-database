caption: 'Neurotrophins and their effect on angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the skin.
  Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) binds to two receptors—tropomyosin receptor
  kinase B (trkB) or the neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR. BDNF preferentially binds
  to a P75 NTR-sortilin complex. TrkB can activate various intracellular pathways,
  such as the protein kinase C (PKC). Nerve growth factor (NGF), growth differentiation
  factor-11 (GDF11) and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF15) act on neurogenesis
  and angiogenesis through the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Insulin and insulin-like
  GFs (IGFs) bind to membrane receptors: type I (IGF-1R), type II (IGF-2R), insulin
  receptor (IR) targeting MAPK and PI3K. Bioavailability of the IGFs is regulated
  by specific binding proteins (IGFBPs). IGFs affect multiple signaling cascades through
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism and the critical regulator of inflammation
  NLRP3. P27Kip1 is a key regulator of cell growth arrest and IL-23 expression in
  keratinocytes is associated with inflammation. Epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR) and its ligands (EGFR) stimulate the AKT/PI3K pathway. Tumor necrosis factor-α
  (TNF-α) induces activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway
  limited by GDF11.'
