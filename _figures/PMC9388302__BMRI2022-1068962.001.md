caption: Schematic diagram for the regulatory effect of FoxO1 on macrophage. (a) The
  role of FoxO1 in macrophage polarization. SIRT1 can promote the deacetylation of
  FoxO1 in the presence of LPS stimulation, which in turn accelerates nuclear translocation
  of FoxO1. FoxO1 skews macrophage towards M1 phenotype through binding to the promoter
  regions of MHCII and IL-1β directly. The other hand, FoxO1 up-regulates the expression
  of IL-10 and ADAR1, which is critical for M2 induction. FoxO1-driven IRF4 transcription
  promotes nuclear translocation of FoxO1 mediated by inhibiting PI3K-Akt signaling.
  (b) The function of FoxO1 in macrophage migration. Under oxidative stress, FoxO1
  signaling is enhanced through JNK-MST1 pathway and facilitates CCR2 expression,
  leading to reinforced macrophage migration. (c) The effect of FoxO1 activity on
  macrophage phagocytosis. The expression of pro-phagocytotic factor GATA6 is upregulated
  by nuclear FoxO1, while the phosphorylation of FoxO1 hampers the nuclear translocation
  of FoxO1 following mTOR activation. (d) The impact of FoxO1 on macrophage inflammasome
  activation. Upon activation, FoxO1 drives the transcription of IL-1β and accelerates
  LPS-induced mitochondrial ROS production. FoxO1 also serves as an important link
  bridging ROS accumulation and inflammasome activation. SIRT1, sirtuin1; ADAR1, adenosine
  deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA 1; MST1, Mammalian STE20-like kinase-1;
