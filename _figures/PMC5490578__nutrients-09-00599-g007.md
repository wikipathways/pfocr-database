caption: Simplified diagram of the lipid metabolism canonical pathway. Maturation
  of HDL and free cholesterol (FC) esterification are catalyzed by LCAT. Apo A-I and
  Apo E activate LCAT, and PON-I, which is also activated by Apo A–I, avoiding LCAT
  inactivation. Apo D binds to LCAT to improve its esterification activity. Finally,
  cholesterol is transported to the liver for its elimination by fecal excretion.
