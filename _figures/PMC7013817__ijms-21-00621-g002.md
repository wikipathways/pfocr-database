caption: Schematic diagram of jasmonic acid biosynthesis and metabolism in response
  to abiotic stresses. In the chloroplast, JA biosynthesis begins with the chloroplast
  membrane release of linolenic acid, which is finally converted to 12-oxo-PDA. Upon
  transport of 12-oxo-PDA into the peroxisome, a series of enzymes work to convert
  it to JA, which is then exported to the cytoplasm. JA may be metabolized into different
  compounds depending on the chemical modification of the carboxylic acid group, the
  pentenyl side chain, or the pentanone ring. JA, jasmonic acid; JA-Ile, jasmonyl
  isoleucine; MeJA, methyl jasmonate; 12-HSO4-JA, 12-hydroxyjasmonic acid sulfate;
  12-oxo-PDA, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid.
