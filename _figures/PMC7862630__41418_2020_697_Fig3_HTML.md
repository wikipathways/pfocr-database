caption: A Schematic overview of general principles of how DUBs controls differentiation
  processes. Several indicated DUBs have been proposed to target ubiquitylated histones,
  chromatin remodeling complexes, or master transcription factors (TFs) to bring about
  changes in transcriptional networks required for faithful development. B Schematic
  overview of how TGF-β signaling contributes to cell-fate determination during development
  highlighting regulatory concepts of how DUBs modulate the strength and duration
  of signaling responses. Binding of TGF-β binding to the TGF-β receptor leads to
  receptor kinase activation and phosphorylation of receptor-activated SMADs (R-SMADs).
  Phosphorylated R-SMADs associate with SMAD4 to form active transcription factor
  complexes that translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus to elicit transcriptional
  responses required for developmental cell-fate decisions. This signaling cascade
  can be blocked by inhibitory SMADs (I-SMAD), which recruit the ubiquitin ligases
  SMURF1/2 (SMURF) to the TGF-β family receptors for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.
  Also other TGF-β signaling pathway components are subject to regulation by ubiquitylation,
  which is counteracted by DUBs as indicated.
