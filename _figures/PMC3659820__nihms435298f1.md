caption: Isobutanol pathways. The upstream pathway (composed of ILV2, ILV5 and ILV3)
  is part of the valine biosynthetic pathway (red arrows), while the downstream pathway
  (composed of KDC and ADH) is the Ehrlich valine degradation pathway (green arrows).
  The α-ketoisovalerate (α-KIV) intermediate is interconverted to valine by BAT1 and
  BAT2. The upstream and downstream pathways are naturally separated between the mitochondria
  and cytoplasm, respectively (A). However, the pathway engineered via mitochondrial
  engineering targets the complete pathway to the mitochondrial compartment (B). Blue
  arrows depict transport across mitochondrial membranes.
