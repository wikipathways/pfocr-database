caption: 'Schematic diagram of cerebral metabolism. Schematic illustration of cerebral
  intermediary metabolism is shown with a focus on the glycolytic pathway and its
  relation to glycerol, glycerophospholipids, and the citric acid cycle. Abbreviations:
  α-KG α-ketoglutarate, DHAP dihydroxyacetone-phosphate, F-1,6-DP fructose-1,6-diphosphate,
  FFA free fatty acid, G-3-P glycerol-3-phosphate, GA-3P glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
  Underscored metabolites are obtained at the bedside with enzymatic techniques.'
