caption: Binding of IL-7 causes dimerization of its receptor chains and activation
  of the receptor–associated JAK1 and JAK3. JAKs in turn phosphorylate receptor docking
  sites for STAT5, leading to the transcription factor’s phosphorylation, dimerization
  and nuclear translocation, perhaps inducing novel gene products that promote survival
  (X, Y). Other signaling pathways that may stem directly or indirectly (X) from the
  IL-7 receptor include the PI3K/AKT pathway which inhibits apoptotic proteins and
  the cell cycle inhibitor, p27kip1, and promotes glucose uptake through the glucose
  transporter, GLUT1. Unknown signaling pathways (X) also regulate the activity of
  the stress kinase, p38 MAPK. Down-regulation of p38 MAPK leads to the stable expression
  of Cdc25A, the activator of cdk/cyclin complexes that promotes proliferation and
  gene expression likely through activation of the E2F transcription factors. Expression
  of the survival protein, BCL-2, is up-regulated by IL-7, perhaps through STAT5 activity,
  but more likely through unknown transcriptional activity (Z). T-cell proliferation
  in response to IL-7 thus requires signals that drive cell cycle progression but
  also provide survival signals that prevent apoptosis and produce energy to support
  cell division.
