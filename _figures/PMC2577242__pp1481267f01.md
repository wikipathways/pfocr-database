caption: Simplified hypothetical pathway to C13 cyclohexenone and C14 mycorradicin
  derivatives in mycorrhizal roots. The indicated cleavage specificities of CCD1 and
  its presumed C40 carotenoid substrate have been deduced from in vitro studies. An
  early biosynthetic step in the MEP pathway previously targeted for gene silencing
  (DXS2) is highlighted. The carotenoid precursor in mycorrhizal roots is still elusive.
