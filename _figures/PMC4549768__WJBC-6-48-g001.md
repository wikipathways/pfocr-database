caption: 'DNA damage tolerance mechanisms. DNA damage (asterisk in blue circle) stalls
  DNA replication. A: Reinitiation of DNA synthesis results in the formation of a
  ssDNA gap. Shown is a ssDNA gap on the lagging strand; B: PCNA mono-ubiquitination
  induces a switch from replicative polymerase to a TLS polymerase Pol ζ or Pol η,
  resulting in gap filling via TLS, which may incorporate the wrong nucleotide (asterisk
  in green circle); C-E: PCNA poly-ubiquitination activates the Rad5-dependent error-free
  TS pathway. Gap filling is achieved by strand invasion mediated by Rad51, Rad52,
  Rad54, and Rad55/Rad57 and repair synthesis carried out by Pol δ (C), followed by
  the formation of SCJ (D), and resolution of the SCJ by Sgs1/Top3/Rmi1 (E). DDT can
  also proceed through the salvage HR pathway that also produces the SCJ intermediate.
  The salvage pathway is hyper-recombinogenic and prone to crossover as indicated.
  It is normally inhibited by sumoylated PCNA and Srs2. G2: Gap 2; M: Mitotic; PCNA:
  Proliferating cell nuclear antigen; S: Synthesis; SUMO: Small ubiquitin-like modifier;
  TLS: Translesion synthesis; SCJ: Sister chromatid junction; Ub: Ubiquitin.'
