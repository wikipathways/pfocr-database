caption: TLR4-mediated HAdV-lactoferrin uptake in DCs and IL-1β release Lactoferrin
  binds to HAdV capsid and retargets the capsid toward TLR4 complex on the cells surface.
  Following TLR4 engagement, its TIR domain recruits MyD88 and TIRAP, which bridge
  TLRs to IRAK and MAPK family members that activate NF-kB, AP-1, and IRF. This priming
  event initiates transcription of genes coding for inflammasome components (e.g.,
  NLRP3 and IL-1β). Under prototypic conditions, DCs detect a second perturbation
  (signal 2) that induced ROS release (mitochondrial stress) or K+ efflux (perturbations
  of cellular integrity), and/or cathepsin B release from lysosome rupture. These
  pathways do not appear to be activated by HAdV-lactoferrin complexes. In addition
  to TLR4 pathways, the RIPK1-RIPK3 pathway is activated through an autocrine-TNF
  release. During inflammasome formation, pro-caspase-1 auto-activation induces cleavage
  of pro-IL-1β and likely GSDMD, which will initiate, but not complete, the loss of
  plasma membrane integrity via pore formation, allowing IL-1β release. Twenty-four
  hours post-challenge, DC membrane integrity is intact, consistent with the involvement
  of ESCRT-III complex and repairing GSDMD pores.
