caption: Proposed pathways by which prostate cancer cells activate AR signaling, including
  variants (AR-Vs), and thus acquire resistance to AR-directed therapy. Pathway 1
  denotes resistance that has occurred by an increase in AR-FL expression along with
  association to persistence of intratumoral androgens. The intratumoral androgens
  may be derived from incomplete suppression of androgen production from the testes,
  conversion of adrenal androgens to dihydrotestosterone in the prostate, or intratumoral
  production of androgens [-]. Pathway 2 indicates the AR-FL receptor can also exhibit
  enhanced transactivation due to an increase in AR co-activators []. Pathway 3 indicates
  that non-androgen ligands may also enhance activation of the AR-FL receptor (IL-6,
  IGF-I) []. Pathway 4 indicates mutations that develop in the LBD of the AR. In the
  case of LNCaP cells mutations can result in a promiscuous receptor or resistance
  to AR targeting agents including enzalutamide, ARN509, bicalutamide, and flutamide
  []. Pathway 5 shows that resistance to enzalutamide and ARN509 may develop by upregulation
  of the glucocorticoid receptor, which in turn activates a similar but distinct pattern
  of AR genes that stimulate tumor growth in response to glucocorticoid ligands [].
  Pathway 6 demonstrates the observation that neuroendocrine-like cancers arise more
  frequently following treatment with the newer anti-AR therapies []. Finally, in
  pathway 7 we note the development of constitutively active AR-Vs that are the basis
  of this review.
