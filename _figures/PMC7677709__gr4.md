caption: Glutamine-Driven mSLP as a Major Source of ATP Synthesis in Cancer CellsATP
  synthesis through mSLP at the succinate-CoA ligase reaction (SUCL) in the glutaminolysis
  pathway (red) can compensate for inefficient ATP synthesis through OxPhos in cancer
  cells with mitochondrial abnormalities. mSLP can also compensate for inefficient
  ATP synthesis through glycolysis in cancer cells that express the cytoplasmic PKM2
  isoform, which produces less ATP than the PKM1 isoform. These bioenergetic compensations
  will hold the ΔG′ATP hydrolysis at minus 56 kJ/mole, thus maintaining cancer cell
  viability in either the presence or absence of oxygen. Oxygen consumption in cancer
  cells is used more for production of ROS, which are carcinogenic and mutagenic,
  than for ATP synthesis. Moreover, mSLP will maintain the forward operation of the
  adenine nucleotide translocase thus preventing depletion of cytosolic ATP reserves
  from the reverse operation of the F0-F1 ATP synthase (). Release of succinate to
  the cytoplasm can help stabilize Hif-1a, thus linking lactic acid fermentation through
  glycolysis to glutamine fermentation through glutaminolysis. The diversion of CoA
  from succinate to acetoacetate under the metabolism of ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate
  and acetoacetate) could indirectly reduce ATP synthesis through the SUCL reaction.
  The simultaneous restriction of glucose and glutamine, while elevating circulating
  ketone bodies, will stress the majority of signaling pathways necessary for maintaining
  tumor cell viability (; ). See text for additional details. BDH, β-hydroxybutyrate

  description: Glutamine-Driven mSLP as a Major Source of ATP Synthesis in Cancer
    CellsATP synthesis through mSLP at the succinate-CoA ligase reaction (SUCL) in
