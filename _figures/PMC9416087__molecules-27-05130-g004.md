caption: Activation of EGCG-sensing pathway following its binding to 67LR results
  in anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic actions. The anti-inflammatory effect of
  EGCG and EGCG3″Me results from inhibition of TLR signaling mediated by 67LR, Tollip,
  and RNF216. EGCG/EGCG3″Me binding to 67LR suppresses MRLC phosphorylation and the
  histamine release from basophils. EGCG/EGCG3″Me also inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation,
  reducing FcεRI expression.
