caption: A multiplexed luciferase reporter and biochemical platform for fingerprinting
  molecular libraries. A cell line transiently or stably harboring reporter plasmids
  for monitoring Wnt/β-catenin, p53, and Ras activity forms the basis for screening
  large molecular libraries to identify novel points of therapeutic intervention or
  detecting off-targeting effects of reagents. RL Renilla luciferase, FL firefly luciferase,
  CL Cypridina luciferase. SuperTopFlash reporter incorporates TCF/LEF-binding elements,
  thus reporting Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity []. The Elk-1 reporter system measures
  an output of Ras signaling and the pp53-TA-Luc plasmid reports TP53 activity. The
  Cytotox Fluor assay monitors the release of a cytoplasmic protease from cells with
  compromised membrane integrity. Molecular screening library reagents include small
  molecules and pooled siRNAs
