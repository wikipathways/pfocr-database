caption: The proposed model for the transcriptional regulation of Insig by CREBZF
  in the live. Obesity and nutrient excess induce CREBZF activity. Insulin-induced
  activation of CREBZF inhibits Insig-2a expression in hepatocytes during refeeding,
  allowing SREBP-1 to be processed and activation of fatty acid synthesis. The CREBZF/ATF4
  heterodimer serves as the regulator transducing excessive nutrient and hormonal
  signaling to the transcriptional regulation of Insig-2a. CREBZF hyperactivation
  may play important roles in the development of sustained lipogenesis in the liver
  under selective insulin resistance conditions.
