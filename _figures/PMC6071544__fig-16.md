caption: UCP2 promoting tumorigenesis. Scheme of major cancer cell pathways including
  glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation, emphasizing synthesis
  and utilization of NADH/NAD+ and NADPH/NADP+ together with UCP2-promoted glutaminolysis.
  The latter occurs probably by UCP2-mediated enhancement of the aspartate efflux
  from the matrix, leading to suppression of glycolytic influx to the Krebs cycle
  by export of malate, oxaloacetae (not shown), or aspartate from the matrix. Major
  metabolic fluxes and their absence (fading symbols and arrows) or decrease (smaller
  symbols and thinner arrows) are depicted. In cancer cells, a Krebs cycle segment
  is largely unused that includes aconitase (“ACO”) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 3
  (“IDH3”), consequently supplying less NADH for mitochondrial complex I (“CI”) of
  the respiratory chain (“CIII,”“CIV”), which includes also succinate dehydrogenase
  (“CII SDH”) of the Krebs cycle. Glutaminolytic pathway (purple arrows) supplies
  2-oxoglutarate (2OG) for 2OG dehydrogenase (“2OGDH”), thus allowing pyruvate to
  be metabolized by mitochondria, besides for intensive lactate production. Pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (“PDH”) is nearly often completely inhibited by phosphorylation in
  cancer. Dependent on metabolic shuttles, malate (“MAL”) is either imported into
  the matrix or exported out. The malate export or diversion from the Krebs cycle
  allows malic enzyme (“ME”) reaction producing NADPH. The malate diversion efficiently
  leads to a lower NADH production by malate dehydrogenase (“MDH”). At sufficient
  Δp created by the respiratory chain proton pumping, also transhydrogenase (“TH”)
  synthesizes NADPH at the expense of NADH. Glutamate dehydrogenase (“GDH”) reaction,
  which also produces NADPH, is largely inhibited in glutaminolytic cancer cells by
  GTP. ACL, ATP citrate lyase; ASCT, neutral amino acid exchanger; ASP, aspartate;
  Cit C, mitochondrial citrate carrier; CS, citrate synthase; FH, fumarate hydratase;
  FASN, fatty acid synthetase; Gln C, mitochondrial glutamine carrier; GLUT, glucose
  transporter; MAC, mitochondrial malate aspartate carrier; MCT4, lactate transporter;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; OGC, oxoglutarate carrier; Pyr C, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier;
