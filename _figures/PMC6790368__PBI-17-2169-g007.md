caption: A working model for PeSTZ1 response to freezing in poplar. Under cold stress,
  activating the Ca2+signalling pathway in plant cells and stimulating downstream
  cold signal transduction, the upregulated PeSTZ1 acts upstream of PeAPX2 and directly
  regulates its expression by binding to the CATTAACACTG motif of its promoter. The
  activated PeAPX2 then promotes cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase accumulation to scavenge
  ROS under freezing stress. The CBF‐independent ZAT10 transcription factors may modulate
  COR expression. PeSTZ1 and CBFs may collaborate to regulate COR gene expression.
  Overexpressing PeSTZ1 in 84K poplar enhances freezing tolerance by modulating ROS
  scavenging via the direct regulation of PeAPX2 expression.
