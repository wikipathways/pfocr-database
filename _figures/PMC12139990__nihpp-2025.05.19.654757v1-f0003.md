caption: The top targets for putative drugs for glioma are those with the strongest
  interactions as predicted by our CANDO platform (Table 3) and verified by a functional
  annotation search (section 3.4). The phosphatidylinositol-3’-kinase (PI3K)/Akt,
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways play important roles in the biology of malignant
  gliomas [81–84]. Topotecan, irinotecan, and cryptotanshinone all interact with acetylcholinesterase
  (ACHE), ranking 8th (topotecan and irinotecan) and 1st (cryptotanshinone), respectively.
  Compounds resiniferatoxin and topotecan strongly interact with the thyroid hormone
  receptor beta (THRB). The targets ACHE and THRB both influence glioma cell proliferation
  and survival by regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (blue). Cell cycle arrest
  is one of the most well-studied mechanisms accounting for the anti-tumor activity
  of vitamin D in gliomas (orange). The compound chrysin interacts with cyclin-dependent
  kinase 1 (CDK1), targeting glioma cell proliferation via the ERK/Nrf2 signaling
  pathway (green). Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS)
  are key targets of folic acid, modulating glioma cell proliferation through the
  mTOR signaling pathway (red). Taxanes (e.g., cabazitaxel) and vinca alkaloids (e.g.,
  vinblastine) interact with tubulin alpha-1C, influencing glioma through the JAK-STAT
  pathway (yellow). Our study allows for comprehensive mechanistic understanding of
  drug candidate behavior across multiple scales, showcasing the CANDO platform’s
  capability to accurately identify novel drug candidates and their mechanisms through
  a multifaceted strategy
