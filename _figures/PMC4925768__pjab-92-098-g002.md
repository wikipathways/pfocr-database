caption: TDIF signaling pathway regulates vascular stem cell maintenance. TDIF is
  produced in phloem cells and secreted. TDIF is perceived by TDR in procambial cells,
  which both promotes procambial cell proliferation via central transcription factor
  WOX4 and inhibits xylem cell differentiation through activation of GSK3s and subsequent
  suppression of BES1. The two downstream pathways contribute to the maintenance of
  the procambial cell population.
