caption: DENV manipulates host cellular processes and innate immune responses within
  infected cells by A) manipulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) to counter
  cellular stress and delay apoptosis. B) To offset ER stress and access fatty acid
  metabolism networks, DENV also initiates autophagy, which has shown to be necessary
  for production of infectious virions. C) The DENV non-structural protein NS4B and
  subgenomic sfRNA interfere with the RNAi pathway by inhibiting the RNAse Dicer.
  D) During heterotypic secondary DENV infection, subneutralizing antibodies can enable
  viral uptake through FcγR and down-regulate signaling cascades initiated via the
  pattern recognition receptors TLR3 and MDA5/RIG-I, thus reducing the antiviral state
  of the cell. E) The DENV NS2B/3 protein cleaves human STING/MITA, interfering with
  the signaling pathway leading to induction of IFNα/β.
