caption: Schematic view of integration of TCR signal transduction with diverse components
  of the actin polymerization machinery. TCR ligation with the pMHC complex on APC
  leads to Lck-mediated phosphorylation of cytosolic ITAM motifs in the CD3 zeta chain,
  which then serve as docking sites for ZAP70 kinase and it is accompanied by ZAP70
  phosphorylation. From this initial step, TCR signaling diversifies to trigger a
  variety of signaling modules that yield actin polymerization. ZAP70 can activate
  NPF WASp via WIP-CrkL pathway (1), or via recruitment of Nck and thus of WASp. ZAP70-mediated
  recruitment of LAT and SLP76 complex, which then recruits Vav1, can activate Rho
  GTPase Cdc42, which in turn can release WASp auto-inhibition. Alternatively, WASp
  can be activated by PIP2-dependent-, Fyn-dependent or PST-PIP pathway (2). Activated
  WASp then recruits Arp2/3 complex and initiates actin polymerization. HS1, another
  NPF with cortactin activity, is recruited in an ITK-dependent manner and interacts
  with WASp, or can independently bind Arp2/3 and stabilize F-actin. WASP and HS1
  activation in response to TCR engagement promotes release of Ca2+ from intracellular
  stores. In addition to Vav1, Lck-dependent activation of another GEF - SLAT - causes
  Rac GTPase activation, which in turn causes Abi/WAVE complex-dependent Arp2/3 recruitment
  to generate lamellipodial spreading and Ca2+ entry from the extracellular milieu.
  SLAT also activates Cdc42. Activation of WASH (3), a WASp-family NPF, causes the
  binding of WASH regulatory complex (SHRC) with endosomes, Arp2/3 complex recruitment
  and subsequent actin polymerization at the endosomes. SHRC also interacts with microtubules,
  and regulates endocytic recycling of cell surface receptors. Apart from the actin
  nucleating factor Arp2/3, the formin family proteins respond to TCR activation,
  and act to elongate the actin filaments linearly. These proteins localize to filopodia,
  as well as the perinuclear centrosomal area, where they regulate MTOC polarization
  to the synapse. (NPFs in the signaling cascades shown in red).
