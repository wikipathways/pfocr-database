caption: 'Cholesterol biosynthetic pathway—schematic representation of the main 27-carbon
  sterol intermediates derived from 30-carbon lanosterol. Enzymatic defects associated
  with the distal Kandutsch-Russell pathway have already been described in human and
  mouse. Desaturation of the C5 bond may occur at two different steps in the pathway:
  7-dehydrocholesterol is generated from the action of C5 sterol desaturase on lathosterol
  (cholest-7-en-3β-ol); this enzyme also acts on zymostenol (cholest-8[9]-en-3β-ol),
  generating 8-dehydrocholesterol. The enzymatic steps shown are as follows: (1) 3β-hydroxysteroid-Δ7-reductase
  (7-dehydrocholesterol reductase; E.C. 1.3.1.21), defective in SLO syndrome; (2)
  3β-hydroxysteroid-Δ8,Δ7-isomerase (zymostenol isomerase; E.C. 5.3.3.5) defective
  in CDPX2 and tattered mouse; (3) C3 sterol dehydrogenase (NSDHL) defective in bare
  patches mouse and CHILD syndrome; and (4) SC5D.'
