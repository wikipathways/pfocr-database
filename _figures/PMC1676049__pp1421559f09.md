caption: Hypothetical model presenting the role of ERD15 in ABA responses. The activation
  of ABA-signaling pathway by abiotic stress leads to drought and freezing tolerance.
  ERD15 negatively regulates the transduction of ABA signal, possibly downstream of
  the protein phosphatases ABI1 and ABI2. The negative effect of ERD15 on ABA signaling
  enhances SA-dependent defense seen as improved induction of PR genes and leading
  to enhanced resistance to the pathogen E. carotovora. Simultaneously, the enhanced
  SAR response down-regulates JA-dependent defense responses.
