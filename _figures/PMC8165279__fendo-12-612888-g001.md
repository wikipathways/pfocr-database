caption: 'Enzymatic profile for skeletal muscle mitochondria in the IUGR fetus. The
  schematic outlines major mitochondrial enzymes and their processes in the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle and in the electron transport chain (ETC). Lower abundances (red
  text) and greater abundances (blue text) for IUGR mitochondria are indicated, whereas
  enzymes that are not different from control mitochondria are in black text. Proposed
  decreased metabolic fluxes in IUGR mitochondria are shown with red (lower) and blue
  (higher). Here, fluxes of pyruvate, amino acids, and fatty acids are all thought
  to be lower in the IUGR skeletal muscle due to lower enzyme expression involved
  in each pathway. Initial pyruvate flux is thought to be hindered by higher MPC2
  expression and is believed to be further slowed by lower expressions of IDH, OGDH,
  and SUCLA2. Because these enzymes are also innately involved in amino acid flux
  into the TCA cycle, amino acid degradation is also believed to be lower in IUGR
  skeletal muscle mitochondria. Moreover, higher NDUFA4L2 expression in IUGR skeletal
  muscle mitochondria is believed to slow electron flux leading to a) lower reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) production b) lower oxygen consumption rates c) lower NADH
