caption: 'The Pr/XylR/Pu node and formalization of regulatory interactions. (a) Basic
  interactions between the Pu promoter, its cognate regulator XylR and the global
  regulators IHF and Crc whose levels are modulated by growth state. (b) Biochemical
  reactions involved in the upper route of the TOL pathway. We take into account transcription
  from the Pr and Pu promoters (with rates βR and βU, respectively), translation of
  the corresponding mRNAs (with rates ρR and ρU), and degradation of the molecular
  species: mRNAs (with degradation rates δmR and δmU) and proteins (with rates δR
  and δU). Translational repression of xylR mRNA (mR) by Crc is described by the effective
  association rate constant μ. We also consider, sketched as double arrows, the activation
  (mediated by m-xylene) and inactivation reactions of XylR, as well as the binding/unbinding
  reactions of active XylR (Ra) to the Pu promoter. A detailed description of the
  model is provided in , and the values of the reaction rates specified in .'
