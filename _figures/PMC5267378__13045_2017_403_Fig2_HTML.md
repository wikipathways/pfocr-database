caption: 'Mechanism of the PD pathway in driving tumor-associated immune evasion.
  Tumor cells, tumor-associated antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and stromal cells
  upregulate PD-L1 in response to ongoing immune responses, mainly through the action
  of IFN-γ. The ligation of PD-1 by PD-L1 delivers inhibitory signals to T cells,
  leading to T cell anergy, functional exhaustion, and apoptosis. PD-1-PD-L1 interaction
  also favors conversion of T cells to the regulatory T cell (Treg) phenotype with
  secretion of inhibitory cytokines, such as IL-10. PD-1 on myeloid cells also impairs
  dendritic cell functions. In addition, PD-L1 reversed signaling on tumor cells can
  serve as a “Molecular Shield” protecting tumor cells from CTL-mediated killing.
