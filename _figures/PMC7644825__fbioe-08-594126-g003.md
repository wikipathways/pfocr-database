caption: MIA and BIA biosynthetic pathways in yeast. Summaries of the (A) monoterpene
  indole alkaloid biosynthetic pathway, as refactored in yeast, and (B) benzylisoquinoline
  alkaloid biosynthetic pathway, with example compounds and, in red, their pharmaceutical
  applications. STR, strictosidine synthase. NCS, norcoclaurine synthase. Solid arrow
  denotes single reaction. Dashed arrow denotes multiple reactions.
