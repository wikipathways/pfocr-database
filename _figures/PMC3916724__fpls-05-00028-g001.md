caption: Molybdenum metabolism in higher plant cells. The main components of molybdenum
  metabolism in plants are shown including the Moco biosynthetic pathway (CNX proteins)
  in mitochondria and cytosol, the Moco user enzymes and their respective main functions
  in nitrogen assimilation (NR), ABA synthesis (AAO3), purine catabolism (XDH1), and
  sulfite detoxification (SO). mARC enzymes are proposed to function in reduction
  of certain N-hydroxylated substrates, which have not yet been identified. While
  one of the two mARC isoforms (mARC2) contains an NH2-terminal mitochondrial targeting
  sequence, such targeting sequence is absent at the second isoform, which therefore
  is assumed to act in the cytosol. In contrast to the molybdate transporter MOT2,
  which functions at the vacuolar membrane as a molybdate exporter, MOT1 might localize
  to the endomembrane system, possibly to the endoplasmic reticulum. A mitochondrial
  localization of MOT1 has also been reported but appears less likely as no obvious
  reason exists for import or export of molybdate into or out of the mitochondria,
  respectively. The plant homolog (MFS-MOT) of the major facilitator superfamily molybdate
  transporter MOT2 from Chlamydomonas might be required for molybdate import across
  the plasma membrane. The function of the Moco sulfurase ABA3 in activation of AO
  and XDH is indicated, just as the functions of the mitochondrial ABC transporter
  ATM3 in export of cPMP from mitochondria and in cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster ([Fe-S])
  assembly for AO and XDH (and other extra-mitochondrial proteins). Further details
  are given in the main text and are reviewed by  and . Molybdo-enzymes are indicated
  by blue letters, other components of molybdenum metabolism by orange letters; dotted
  arrows indicate requirement for Moco by molybdo-enzymes.
