caption: The mechanism of tumor-serected exosomal cargos regulate metabolic reprogramming
  of immune cells. Tumor cells-secreted exosomal miR-451 can target AMPK to activate
  the mTOR pathway and promote Th17 polarized differentiation of T cells through glucose
  deprivation. Cervical squamous carcinoma-derived exosomal miR-142-5p can target
  ARID2 to inhibit DNMT1 recruitment to the INF-γ promoter, leading to up-regulation
  of IDO, thereby suppressing and exhausting CD8 + T cells. Prostate cancer-derived
  exosomal Rab27a can promote CD73 expression in DCs, which hydrolyzes AMP to adenosine
  and inhibits the production of TNFα and IL-1L in an ATP-dependent manner, resulting
  in functional inhibition of DCs. Hypoxia-induced exosomal let-7a can inhibit the
  insulin-AKT-mTOR pathway and induce M2-polarized TAMs by enhancing OXPHOS. Lung
  cancer cell-secreted exosomal PKM2 can activate the AMPK pathway to induce M2-polarized
  TAMs, in which exosome-mediated glycolytic remodeling may play a role. HNSCC cells-derived
  exosomal metabolite adenosine can induce A2BR-mediated M2-polarized TAMs
