caption: Thermodynamic strategies to correct the disease-causing stability defect
  in F508del-CFTR. The structure of hCFTR is schematized at upper right. Its two nucleotide-binding
  domains, NBD1 (, ) (blue, PDB code 2BBO) and NBD2 (green, PDB code 3GD7) bind two
  molecules of Mg-ATP (yellow and orange) at their mutual interface (). Its two transmembrane
  domains, TMD1 (blue) and TMD2 (green), structurally interdigitate to form two composite
  binding sites (, ), one for NBD1 and the other for NBD2. Residue Phe-508 (red),
  which is deleted in F508del-hCFTR, is located on the surface of NBD1 that binds
  to the cognate binding site formed by TMD1/TMD2 (, , , , ). The regulatory or R
  region (magenta) is believed to be predominantly disordered but to have segments
  that reversibly bind to the other domains in hCFTR to modulate their behavior (,
  ). The folding pathway of human NBD1 (hNBD1) is schematized in the center and at
  the left, above a free-energy diagram. The native conformation of hNBD1, which is
  stabilized by binding to ATP and the TMDs of hCFTR, is in equilibrium with a low-energy
  “molten-globule” conformation (), which retains native-like secondary structure.
  Formation of this molten globule species is inhibited by a wide range of second-site
  mutations (, , ) that also suppress the trafficking defect (, , ) in F508del-hCFTR
  that is responsible for causing cystic fibrosis (). These observations support the
  hypothesis that the F508del mutation causes the disease by promoting formation of
  the highly aggregation-prone molten-globule intermediate. Thermodynamic theory suggests
  that chemical compounds that bind to F508del-hNBD1, either alone or at its interface
  with the TMDs of hCFTR, should pull the domain away from the molten-globule conformation
  (, ) and thereby offset the defect caused by the mutation (orange and green dotted
  lines in the free-energy diagram). This thermodynamic effect can be thought of as
  a form of “mass action.”
