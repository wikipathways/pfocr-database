caption: Predicted Role of ANKHD1 in the Hippo Signalling Pathway. A basic overview
  of the critical components of the Hippo signalling pathway. When the pathway is
  inactive (left), there is no upstream protein phosphorylation in the cytoplasm,
  allowing YAP/TAZ and ANKHD1 to form a complex and enter the nucleus. These proteins
  then form a complex with one of the TEAD transcription factors (TEAD1-4), driving
  gene transcription. Additionally, ANKHD1 positively regulates YAP mRNA. When the
  pathway is active (right), there is phosphorylation of both the SAV1/MST complex
  and the MOB1/LATS complex. This drives the phosphorylation of YAP, resulting in
  either ubiquitination and degradation or its binding to 14-3-3 and retention in
  the cytoplasm. Both cases prevent YAP and ANKHD1 from entering the nucleus, so gene
  transcription is inhibited [45,50]. However, ANKHD1 negatively regulates phosphorylated
  YAP, limiting the amount of cytoplasmic retention and degradation of the protein
