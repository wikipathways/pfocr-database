caption: '– Targets potentially regulated by miR-142-3p within the virus entry via
  an endocytic canonical pathway. Molecules highly predicted and experimentally validated
  as targets of miR-142-3p within the virus entry via endocytic pathway are shown
  as nodes with each node shape representing one type of molecule as indicated in
  the figure: clathrin, Rac family small GTPase 1 (RAC1), integrin beta 1, CXADR Ig-like
  cell adhesion molecule (CAR) and protein kinase C (PKC). Molecules and functions
  are colored based on their predicted activation status: activated (orange) or inhibited
  (blue) or decreased (gradient of green) or increased (gradient of red).'
