caption: Canonical Wnt pathway. (A) In the absence of a Wnt ligand, β-catenin is sequentially
  phosphorylated in the destruction complex of axin and APC by the kinases CK1α and
  GSK3β, which results in ubiquitination by β-TRCP and, finally, in the degradation
  of β-catenin in the proteasom. (B) In the presence of a Wnt ligand, a Fzd/LRP5/6
  complex is formed and is bound by Dishevelled, leading to the phosphorylation of
  the LRP5/6 receptor by GSK3β, CK1γ and other kinases. Phosphorylated LRP5/6 recruits
  axin to the plasma membrane, which leads to decay of the destruction complex, inhibited
  phosphorylation, and degradation of β-catenin. Stabilized β-catenin is then translocated
  to the nucleus, a process that can involve BCl9-2. β-Catenin interacts with TCF/LEF,
  and the recruitment of cofactors like BCL9, Pygopus, or CBP as well as the replacement
  of Groucho leads to the activation of target genes.
