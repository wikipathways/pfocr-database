caption: Model of known components of the IFN signalling pathway and explanation of
  observed results. Transfection of siRNA using Lipofectamine2000 in mouse BMDMs inductes
  a type I IFN response. This probably occurrs through the activation of pattern recognition
  receptors (PRRs) by dsRNA and/or liposome complexes. Downstream of PRR activation
  interferon regulatory factor 3 (Irf3) is phospohorylated and translocates to the
  nucleus where it which binds to the IFNβ promotor to induce expression of the IFNβ
  transcript (Ifnb1). It has been proposed that interferon regulatory factor 5 (Irf5)
  contributes in a similar manner to induce type I IFN during the antiviral response,
  and components of the NF-kB pathway are also known to contribute at this level.
  Once induced, the IFNβ acts in an autocrine manner to activate JAK-STAT signalling
  and subsequent formation of the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), a transcription
  factor complex composed of Stat1, Stat2 and Irf9 proteins. ISGF3 is responsible
  for driving the expression of type I interferon-stimulated genes via the ISRE (interferon
  stimulate response element) found within the promoter sequence of many ISGs affected
  in this study. Our data suggest that siRNAs targeted to the Ifnb1, Irf3, Irf5, Stat1,
  Stat2 and Nfkb2 transcripts all disrupt the type I IFN response at a similar level,
  and therefore alter the downstream expression of several hundred IFN-inducible genes
  in a similar way. Our data also suggest that type I IFN signalling strongly down-regulates
  cell cycle genes and influences the activity of the NF-κB signalling and many of
  the genes associated with a type II IFNγ response. Subsequent activation by IFNγ
  influences the expression of a different but significantly overlapping set of genes
  and the magnitude of this response is clearly influenced by the prior activation
  of the cells by type I signalling.
