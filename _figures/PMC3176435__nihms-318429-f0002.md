caption: During typical tRNA maturation, the 5′ leader and 3′ trailer of the pre-tRNA
  are removed by RNase P and RNase Z cleavages, respectively, followed by 3′ CCA addition.
  Subfragments of tRNAs are frequently observed, many of which reflect routine tRNA
  turnover and are not regulatory in nature. However, a number of specific pathways
  have been observed that extend the regulatory range of tRNA loci. In the case of
  tRNA-Ile/mir-1983, an alternative fold of the pre-tRNA adopts an extensive hairpin
  that permits cleavage by Dicer. Some mature tRNA cloverleafs may also serve as Dicer
  substrates and/or generate subfragments that load Ago proteins; this is most prominent
  in Tetrahymena where the Piwi protein Twi12 carries 3′ tRNA fragments exclusively.
  Some RNaseZ-generated tRNA 3′ trailers associate preferentially with Ago3/4 and
  regulatory activity of these trailers was reported, although this is not necessarily
  mediated by Ago complexes. Under stress conditions, mature tRNA are cut into halves,
  which may associate with unknown complexes to exert regulatory roles. A number of
  box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs can also give rise to Ago-associated, miRNA-like species
  in a Drosha/DGCR8-independent, Dicer-dependent manner.
