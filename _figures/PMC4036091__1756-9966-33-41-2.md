caption: A schematic diagram representing the hypothetical mechanisms of the insulin-dependent
  systemic (I) and insulin-independent direct (II) effects of metformin in the endometrium.
  In the endometrium, binding of insulin and IGF-1 ligands to their receptors INSR
  and/or IGF-1R as homodimers or heterodimers leads to the activation of downstream
  signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. A number of studies have
  demonstrated that in vitro enhancement of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade in multiple
  cancer cells – including type I EC cell lines – ultimately results in specific cellular
  outcomes including cell proliferation, cell death, cell cycle arrest, and protein
  translation. Thus, activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade might be the underlying
  mechanism behind the initiation and progression of EC in women with PCOS. Because
  AMPK, mTOR, and GLUT4 are considered to be central factors that are targeted by
  metformin, and because various OCTs and MATEs that mediate the metformin uptake
  and excretion are present in endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, we propose
  the following two mechanisms of metformin-induced inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  cascade in PCOS women with early stage EC. (1) Metformin activates the AMPK pathway
  in the liver and suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis. This leads to reduced levels
  of circulating insulin and glucose, and this lack of substrates for IR/IGF-1R binding
  disrupts the activation of insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathways in the endometrial cancer
  cells. (2) In the endometrium, metformin either directly targets members of the
  AMPK, mTOR, and GLUT4 axis in endometrial cancer cells through the activity of epithelial
  OCTs and MATEs, or through stromal OCTs and MATEs in a paracrine manner to inhibit
  epithelia-derived cancer cell proliferation and growth. Thick horizontal red lines
  indicate inhibitory effects of metformin. For references, see the text.
