caption: 'Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) pathway and the frequency of genetic aberrations
  within CDK4 related pathways altered in mucosal melanomass. (a) Mitogenic signals
  (e.g. the growth factor/RTK, estrogen, and PI3K signaling pathways) stimulate the
  accumulation of D-type cyclins in early G1 phase. In response to mitogenic signaling,
  cyclin D-CDK4/6 phosphorylate the RB. The INK4 protein family, including p16, p15,
  p18 and p19, act as a brake on the activation of CDK4/CDK6. These D-type cyclins
  form a complex with CDK4/6 to phosphorylate RB, which regulates E2F transcriptional
  activity. Hypophosphorylated RB can inhibit transcription by binding to E2F transcriptional
  regulators, suppressing target gene transcription. Cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex phosphorylates
  RB, and then partially activating the E2F-family proteins, which results in the
  E2F target gene transcription, including cyclins A and E and CDK2. With the accumulation
  of cyclin E, cyclin E-CDK2 complex further phosphorylate RB, forming a positive
  feedback loop via E2F, releasing and fully activating E2F, to push the cell from
  G1 to S phase. CDK4/6 inhibitors can prevent cell cycle progression by inhibiting
  CDK4/6 kinase activity. (b) Deregulation of genes and the frequency of genetic aberrations
  within the CDK4 related signal pathways in mucosal melanomas: single-nucleotide
  variants (SNV, blue), copy number gain (GAIN, green), homozygous deletion (LOSS,
  yellow), frequency of genetic aberrations in pathways (gray). Genomic data of mucosal
  melanomas derived from our previous study []. INK4, inhibitor of cyclin-dependent
  kinase; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinases.'
