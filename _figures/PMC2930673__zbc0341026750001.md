caption: Cellular iron processing. Ferric iron (Fe3+) bound to Tf is taken up by cells
  through TfR1. The TfR1-Tf complex is internalized through endocytosis. The endosomal
  matrix is acidified by an ATPase proton pump, which allows dissociation of Tf and
  Fe3+ from TfR1. The ferric iron is reduced to Fe2+ by the STEAP family of proteins,
  and it can now be exported to the cytosol by DMT1. Ferrous iron can be delivered
  to ferritin for storage by the iron chaperone PCBP1. The larger part of iron will
  be transported to the mitochondrion for heme and FeS cluster synthesis. How iron
  is delivered to mitochondria is largely unknown. In erythrocytes, mitochondrial
  iron import is mediated by MFRN1 complexed with ABCB10. The MFRN1 paralog, MFRN2,
  is thought to import iron into mitochondria of non-erythroid cells, whether or not
  complexed with ABCB transporters. Factors involved in mitochondrial export of heme
  remain to be elucidated, whereas ABCB7 is thought to export a yet undefined component
  “X” needed for cytosolic FeS cluster assembly. After delivery of iron, TfR1 and
  Tf are recycled back to the cell surface, a pathway in which SEC15L1 plays an important
  role. mFerritin, mitochondrial ferritin.
