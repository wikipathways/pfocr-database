caption: 'Type I interferons attach to their receptors, causing tyrosine kinase 2
  to phosphorylate tyrosine and activate STAT1 and STAT2. These activated proteins
  form dimers and bind to the ISRE (interferon-stimulated response element) with p48
  to activate interferon-responsive genes. Human papillomavirus E6 and E7 suppress
  interferon-mediated gene expression by interacting with signaling pathway components.
