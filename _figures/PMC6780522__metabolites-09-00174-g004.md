caption: 'Integrated networks of ISKNV infection outlining biochemical pathways related
  to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, galactose metabolism,
  and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. Metabolites are represented by
  circles. Changes in the levels of metabolites (circles) relative to the control
  groups are color-coded to represent up-regulation (red) or down-regulation (green).
  Colorless boxes indicate that no difference was detected. Metabolomics data were
  collected from six groups of parallel samples of CPB cells using UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS.
