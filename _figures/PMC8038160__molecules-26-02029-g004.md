caption: 'Flavonoids modulate growth pathways in cancer. Most of the flavonoid compounds
  inhibit the AKT/mTOR and Ras/ERK signaling pathway, impairing especially the metabolism,
  proliferation, survival, growth, and angiogenesis in cancer cells. Flavonoids can
  inhibit the response of the tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs), initially controlling
  the upstream signaling cascade. The signaling can bifurcate in two main pathways:
  the Ras/ERK and the AKT/mTOR signaling. The Ras/ERK signaling, which is important
  in tumor progression, can be both negatively and positively regulated by flavonoids.
  In the AKT/mTOR pathway, one of the primary stages of signaling is the conversion
  of PIP2 to PIP3. This conversion can be inhibited by some flavonoids by inhibiting
  their converter, PI3K, or by stimulating the reverse conversion of PIP3 to PIP2
  through PTEN, known as a tumor suppressor. Although some compounds stimulate AKT,
  probably through a feedback loop, most flavonoid compounds can inhibit AKT, preventing
  the activation of mTOR and, consequently, its effectors. The compounds directly
  inhibit mTOR, in addition to inhibiting 4EBP1/2 and S6K1, proteins that control
  especially the translation initiation and ribosomal and mRNA biogenesis. The compounds
  also stimulate p53, which targets SESTRIN 1/2, to inhibit the AKT/mTOR pathway by
  stimulating AMPK. mTOR signaling also controls lipid synthesis and angiogenesis,
  which can be both inhibited by flavonoids. These inhibitory regulations direct the
  cells to inhibition of cancer progression. Epi: Epigallocatechin, Kae: Kaempferol;
