caption: (a) Moco biosynthetic pathway in bacteria and humans. The human enzymes are
  indicated in parenthesis. The symbols on GTP and cPMP indicate the source of the
  carbon and nitrogen atoms in cPMP as determined by isotope labeling studies,. P
  designates a phosphate group. 3′,8-cH2GTP is shown in brackets, as it had not been
  identified prior to this report. (b) Previous proposal for the functions of MoaA
  and MoaC with 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribofuranosylamino- 4-pyrimidinone triphosphate
  (6) as an intermediate,.(c) Previous proposal for the functions of MoaA and MoaC
  by Begley et al. Pyranopterin triphosphate 7 was proposed as the product of MoaA.
