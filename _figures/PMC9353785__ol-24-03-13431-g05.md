caption: Diagram for the mechanism underlying resistance to 5-FU and the synthesis
  of dTMP in 5-FU-resistant breast cancer cells. (A) In MCF-7 cells, FdUMP is synthesized
  through the OPRT-RR pathway and reduced through the TP-TK pathway. After the acquisition
  of resistance to 5-FU, synthesis of FdUMP was decreased, and reduction of FdUMP
  was increased. As described in the results, (B) in MCF-7 and MCF-7/5UR cells, dTMP
  is synthesized only through the de novo pathway. (C) In MDA-MB-231 cells, FdUMP
  was synthesized mainly through the TP-TK pathway, although some FdUMP was synthesized
  through the OPRT-RR pathway. After the acquisition of resistance to 5-FU, the synthesis
  of FdUMP through the TP-TK pathway disappeared. (D) In MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/5-FUR
  cells, the synthesis of dTMP occurred mainly through the salvage pathway. 5-FU,
  5-fluorouracil; dT, thymidine; dTMP, deoxythymidine monophosphate; dUMP, deoxyuridine
  monophosphate; FdU, fluoro-deoxyuridine; FdUMP, fluoro-deoxyuridine monophosphate;
  FUMP, fluoro-uridine monophosphate; NT, nucleotidase; OPRT, orotate phosphoribosyl
  transferase; RR, ribonucleotide reductase; TK, thymidine kinase; TP, thymidine phosphorylase;
  TS, thymidylate synthase; UMP, uridine monophosphate.
