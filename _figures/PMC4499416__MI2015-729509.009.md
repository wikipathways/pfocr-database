caption: Schematic diagram depicting the possible signaling pathway induced by TMT
  in BV-2 cells. TMT-induced intracellular ROS may be dominantly generated via NADPH
  oxidase in BV-2 cells. ROS are then able to activate MAPKs and NF-κB resulting in
  enhanced production of NO and TNF-α. In this experiment, p38 and JNK MAPK activations
  occurred earlier than NF-κB, and pretreatment with SB203580 or SP600125 suppressed
  TMT-induced NF-κB activation. Although the mechanism of MAPK regulation in NF-κB
  activation is not entirely clear, MAPKs may target various protein kinases relating
  to NF-κB activation and/or transactivation at NF-κB transcriptional level.
