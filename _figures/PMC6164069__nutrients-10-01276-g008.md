caption: Proposed mechanism of SLT-mediated modulation on the lipid metabolism pathway
  and hepatic non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in C57BL/6 mice. The significant
  effect, beneficial to health, of SLT on the prevention of fatty liver formation
  may occur through the inhibition of metabolic enzymes of the lipogenic and adipogenic
  pathway, but not of the lipid oxidative pathway.
