caption: The synthesis of Primary BAs and Secondary BAs. The metabolic pathway of
  bile acids begins with the conversion of cholesterol in the liver into primary bile
  acids—cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid—via the enzyme cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase
  and other enzymatic reactions. These acids are subsequently conjugated with glycine
  or taurine to enhance solubility and functionality, and are then secreted into the
  intestine via bile. In the intestine, gut bacteria metabolize these primary bile
  acids into secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic and lithocholic acids, which
  are absorbed back into the bloodstream and returned to the liver for reuse through
  deconjugation, epimerization. This cyclic process, known as enterohepatic circulation,
  is essential for effective lipid digestion, cholesterol regulation, and liver function
  maintenance. Figure created with BioRender.com
