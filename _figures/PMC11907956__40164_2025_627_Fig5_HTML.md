  on macrophages, it causes the intracellular portion of SIRPα to be phosphorylated.
  Then, SHP-1 and SHP2 are activated, which subsequently inhibits myosin IIA and prevents
  the phagocytosis of macrophages. There are six potential N-glycosylation sites on
  CD47, but whether glycosylation affects the binding of CD47 to its ligands, as well
  as the ligand-binding characteristics of CD47 and subsequent signal transduction,
  remains highly uncertain. CD47 can be ubiquitinated by the E3 TRIM21 ligase and
  then transported to the proteasome for degradation, thereby blocking the CD47/SIRPα
  signaling pathway and enhancing anti-tumor immunity. SIRPα Signal Regulatory Protein
