caption: 'Molecular mechanisms regulating lymphangiogenesis in CCA. The recruitment
  of the lymphatic plexus in CCA is mediated by the coordinated action of neoplastic
  cells and stromal cells hosted in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor cholangiocytes
  (CCA), in response to a hypoxic stimulus, upregulate HIF-1α, which is responsible
  for the increased secretion of VEGF-A, PDGF-B, and PDGF-D. These mediators recruit
  CAFs, which in turn are induced to secrete VEGF-A and VEGF-C via an ERK/JNK-mediated
  pathway, ultimately responsible for the vascular assembly of LECs. CCA cells are
  also able to directly recruit LECs through a RIPK1/p38/JNK/AP-1-mediated pathway
  that stimulates VEGF-C and PEDF hypersecretion. This same pathway is also able to
  stimulate the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, with
  effects on the inflammatory milieu of the tumor microenvironment. Finally, the secretion
  of THBS1 and THBS2 by CCA cells, which inhibit the release of VEGF-A by the other
  components of the tumor microenvironment (matrix), dampens tumor blood angiogenesis
  in CCA. See the main text for further description of the mechanisms involved. CCA,
  cholangiocarcinoma; TME, tumor microenvironment; Hif-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor;
  CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase;
  JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; LECs, lymphatic endothelial cells; RIPK1, receptor-interacting
  protein kinase 1; AP-1, activation protein-1; PEDF, pigment epithelium-derived factor;
  THBS, thrombospondin. Legend: ↑, upregulation.'
