caption: 'Three kinases, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein (ATM), Rad3-related
  protein (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), participate in regulation
  of the response to DNA damage. Active ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK phosphorylate checkpoint
  kinases Chk1 and/or Chk2, which block activity of Cdc25, a positive regulator of
  the cell cycle progression. ATM and ATR are able to activate the p38MAPK/MK2 complex,
  causing the cell cycle arrest []. If DNA damage is repaired, the cell has a chance
  to restart the cell cycle. If DNA breaks are extensive, the mechanisms of a protection
  from mutation accumulation and malignant transformation are triggered. Cisplatin-triggered
  activation of ERKs promotes phosphorylation of p53, which results in overexpression
  of p21, GADD45, and Mdm2 proteins [], launching the cell cycle arrest and repair
  of DNA damage. ERKs also mediate activation of RSK, 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase,
  which promotes proliferation, survival and metastasis []. Cisplatin induces stabilization
  of p18 (Hamlet), a substrate of p38 kinase. These events induce the cell cycle arrest
  and p53-dependent activation of PUMA-α and NOXA [–]. In addition, cisplatin-induced
  c-Abl upregulation is controlled by MMR proteins and induces p73-dependent activation
  of PUMA-α transcription. PUMA-α localizes in mitochondria, interacts with and antagonizes
  an antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL []. Blockage of Bcl-XL function by PUMA-α gives
  way to Bax and Bak to change their conformation and form pores in the outer mitochondrial
  membrane, leading to the cytochrome c release into cytosol, apoptosome formation,
  subsequent caspase activation, and subsequent apoptosis [, ]. NOXA can be induced
  by cisplatin treatment in a p53-dependent and independent manner – the last is provided
  by transcription factors ATF3 and ATF4 []. Moreover, cisplatin-mediated caspase-2
  activation could lead to the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and Endo
  G from mitochondria. AIF, then translocates to the nucleus to induce cell death
  in a caspase-independent way [–]. Dashed arrows demonstrate translocation. Different
  apoptotic pathways are highlighted in different colors: DNA damage response pathway
  is marked in red; p53/p63/p73-dependent apoptosis is marked in blue; intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway—in green; caspase-independent apoptosis—in purple.'
