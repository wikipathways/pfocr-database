caption: C-type lectin receptor signaling shapes immune responses by steering T cell
  polarization. Upon binding of glycosylated proteins (GP) to C-type lectin receptors
  (CLR) on dendritic cells (DC), a downstream signaling cascade is becoming activated
  and can remodel signaling pathways induced by heterologous receptors, such as Toll-like
  receptors (TLR). The signal initiates the transcription of specific cytokines and
  chemokines, followed by the secretion of the expressed mediators by the DC. Furthermore,
  the CLR acts as an endocytosis receptor facilitating the uptake of the GP by the
  DC. The endocytosed GP is degraded into peptide fragments within compartments of
  the endocytic processing pathway. These antigenic peptides bind to MHC-II molecules,
  which are produced in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and fuse into the endocytic
  processing pathway. Upon binding of antigenic peptides to MHC-II, the formed complex
  is transported to the plasma membrane of the DC, where it allows for presentation
  of antigenic peptides to na誰ve CD4+ T helper cells (TH) being equipped with the
  cognate T cell receptor (TCR). This activating signal together with the pro- or
  anti-inflammatory character of the secreted cytokines determines the polarization
  of na誰ve CD4+ T helper cells into specialized subsets. In the context of cross-presentation,
  ingested antigen can furthermore be presented to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which is
  mediated via MHC-I molecules.
