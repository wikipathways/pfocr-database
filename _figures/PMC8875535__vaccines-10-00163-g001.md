caption: Schematic view of IRIS identification and B-cell epitope prediction. (A)
  Briefly, the D9 monoclonal antibody binding to IL-17RB abrogates IL-17B/IL-17RB
  downstream signaling and reverts tumor malignancy. Using X-ray crystallography,
  we previously determined the IL-17RB epitope recognized by D9, namely IRIS, which
  is shown as a blue loop with side chains in sticks, the rest of the IL-17RB structure
  is on the yellow surface. (B) IRIS1/2 designs using either a human (upper panel)
  or mouse (lower panel) sequence are subjected to B-cell epitope prediction (BepiPred2.0).
  The prediction score was set to default (0.5), which is indicated by horizontal
  dash line.
