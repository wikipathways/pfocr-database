caption: β-Carotene turnover pathways. β-Carotene oxidation primarily yields β-apocarotenoids
  of various chain lengths (numbers indicate the reacting double bond position), such
  as the cleavage product pair β-apo-8′-carotenal and β-cyclocitral shown as an example.
  Linear apocarotenals are modified by different enzymes which generate apocarotenols,
  apocarotenoic acids and α, β-unsaturated aocarotenals which might be subjected to
  further degradation. Alternatively, apocarotenoid–GSH adducts might be formed, which
  might enter known degradation pathways. Secondary and repeated oxidation of apocarotenoids
  yields linear apocarotene dialdehydes and as potential end products cytotoxic methylglyoxal
  (C3) and glyoxal (C2). The GSH-dependent glyoxalase pathway represents their predominant
  detoxification pathway yielding products which can enter primary metabolism. AKR
  aldo–keto reductase, ADR aldehyde reductase, AER 2-alkenal reductase, ALDH aldehyde
  dehydrogenase. Arrows with solid lines indicate identified pathways, while dotted
  lines indicate putative pathways
