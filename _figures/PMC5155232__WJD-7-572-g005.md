caption: 'Mechanisms of glucagon-like peptide 1 release from enteroendocrine L cell.
  Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) release from L-cells is regulated by direct nutrient
  sensing via receptors and channels on apical processes or indirectly via neuro-hormonal
  mechanisms[,,,]. A: Nutrient signals. Carbohydrates: Glucose derived from carbohydrate
  metabolism is the most potent stimuli for GLP-1 secretion. Glucose can trigger GLP-1
  release by two mechanisms: (1) the sodium-glucose cotransporter-1 (SGLT-1) couples
  the transport of glucose with Na ions. Na = influx leads to membrane depolarization
  (ΔΨ) (red arrows); and (2) glucose metabolism generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
  Elevated intracellular ATP concentrations [ATP]i close KATP channels and leads to
  membrane depolarization (ΔΨ) (green arrows). Both routes to membrane depolarisation
  increase intracellular Ca levels ([Ca2+]i) by opening L-type Ca channels. Elevated
  [Ca2+]i triggers the exocytosis of GLP-1 secretory granules located at the basolateral
  surface of the enteroendocrine L cell (dashed lines). Fats: Fats are potent stimuli
  for GLP-1 secretion. Free fatty acids (FFA) (blue arrows) interact with G-protein
  coupled receptors (GPCRs) that trigger Ca2+ release from internal stores and also
  activate protein kinase C (PKC). FFA derivates (purple arrows) interact with GPCRs
  that activate second messenger systems involving adenylate cyclase (AC) and cyclic
  AMP (cAMP) which increases [Ca2+]i. Bile acids (orange arrows) and short chained
  fatty acids (not shown) also increase [Ca2+]i by GPCR interactions. Proteins: Protein
  is a weak stimulator of GLP-1 release when compared with sugars and lipids. Amino
  acids (AA) derived from protein breakdown are transported intracelluarly with Na+via
  Na+ dependent AA transporters. Na+ influx causes membrane depolarization and elevated
  [Ca2+]i with resultant GLP-1 exocytosis (pink arrows); B: Hormonal signals. Somatostatin
  inhibits GLP-1 release by blocking AC activation (light blue arrows). The peripheral
  adiposity signals leptin (yellow arrows) and insulin (brown arrows) are thought
  to stimulate GLP-1 release via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  signalling pathway; C: Neural signals. Acetylcholine binding to muscarinic receptors
  (M1R, M2R) elevates [Ca2+]I stimulating GLP-1 release (grey arrows). GRP is though
  to stimulate GLP-1 release in association with the activation of mitogen activated
  protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of MAPK
  (not shown).'
