  is in the top right corner). (B) Conditional effective graph with Alpelisib= ON

  much of the influence from  (receptor tyrosine kinases) pathway redundant (red dashed
  edges) while fixing the state of several variables in the pathway, such as the phospholipid  (phospholipid);
  variables whose state becomes fixed (constants) are denoted by a blue border, and
  edges that transmit a constant input state are denoted by a dashed blue color. (C)
  Spreading dynamics of perturbations to each of the seven drugs in the model and
  the proportion of network effectively reachable. (D) Effectiveness of outgoing edges
  of drug variables;  and  denote out-degree and effective out-degree, respectively.
