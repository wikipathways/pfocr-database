caption: Models of signalling disruption in lipidoses. A) Under physiological conditions,
  cholesterol and glycosphingolipids tend to coalesce in more rigid lipid raft domains,
  which provide platforms where multiple components participating in signalling may
  interact with optimal efficiency. B) In lipidoses, the abnormal accumulation of
  glycosphingolipids or cholesterol in lipid rafts alter the fluidity and lateral
  mobility of raft-associated components, reducing or blocking the transduction of
  cell signalling. In this example, even though all components participating in the
  IGF pathway are essentially not altered, deformation of the raft interferes with
  their proper interaction, blocking downstream activation of AKT. C) A complementary
  model to explain dysfunctional signalling in lipidoses involves the shedding or
  vesiculation of membranes leading to the loss of key components and blockage of
  the signal.
