caption: A detailed model of the Rad5-mediate template switch pathway, assuming gap
  filling dependent on a subset of HR functions after the replication fork has passed.
  First, Siz1-dependent, SUMOylated PCNA stimulates Srs2 helicase to disrupt Rad51
  filaments that have initiated D-loop formation. The role of Rad51 and other HR proteins
  still needs to be defined; they may rejoin and support downstream events in a remodeled
  complex. Depending on Rad18, PCNA is polyubiquitinated by Rad5-Mms2-Ubc13 (see ),
  which, in an unknown way, promotes gap filling by DNA synthesis. (SUMOylation and
  polyubiquitination do not have to occur sequentially but may persist simultaneously
  on different subunits of the PCNA trimer.) The resulting hemicatenane structure
  is resolved by Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 helicase, itself dependent on SUMOylation by Ubc9-Mms21.
