caption: 'Targeted therapy for osteoporosis. miR-203 activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway by inhibiting the expression of DKK1. Romosozumab promotes the conduction
  of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by preventing sclerostin from binding to
  LRP5/6. Icariin and gossypol can inhibit the interaction between WIF1 and Wnt protein,
  thereby regulating the transcription of downstream target genes. This activation
  of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway ultimately alleviates the occurrence and
  development of osteoporosis. DKK1: Dickkopf-1; LRP5/6: Lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 5/6; WIF1: WNT inhibitory factor 1'
