caption: Working model demonstrating the regulation of Hippo signaling during ovulation.
  Brefore the LH surge, cumulus cells are under the influence of oocyte factors that
  signal in part through SMAD2/3 mediated pathways to suppress Hippo pathway components
  and therefore activate YAP1 which stimulates proliferation and/or survival while
  blocking differentiation. After the LH surge and induction of EGF-like peptides,
  the Hippo pathway is transiently activated followed by YAP1 degradation which allows
  cumulus cells to terminally differentiate
