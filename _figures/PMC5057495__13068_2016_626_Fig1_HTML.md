caption: Biosynthesis pathway for limonene production in Y. lipolytica. IPP and DMAPP
  are converted to NPP by neryl diphosphate synthase 1 (NDPS1) and then NPP is further
  converted to limonene by limonene synthase (LS). Blue arrows represent that the
  pathways were exogenously integrated in Y. lipolytica, while red arrows represent
  that the pathways were overexpressed in Y. lipolytica. Single arrows represent the
  one-step conversions, while triple arrows represent multiple steps
