caption: DNAJB9 in normal physiology. DNAJB9 is a key cochaperone of heat shock protein
  70 (HSP70) in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. It has two domains known
  as targeting domain and J-domain. Targeting domain is responsible for binding to
  its target proteins. On the other hand, J-domain facilitates binding Ig protein
  (BiP) (a member of HSP70) to tightly bind with inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1).
  In the normal physiologic state, DNAJB9 is upregulated during hematopoietic stem
  cell differentiation, macrophage activation, angiogenesis, and plasma cell differentiation.
  In a non-ER-stressed state, DNAJB9 will binds to IRE-1 and the J-domain will hydrolyze
  the ATP that binds to BiP. Consequently, BiP-ADP will bind to IRE-1 which prevents
  IRE-1 dimerization. This in turn will suppress the unfolded protein response (UPR)
  in the normal state. In an ER-stressed state, DNAJB9 together with BiP will bind
  to the accumulated misfolded proteins and lead the misfolded protein to endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER)–associated protein degradation (ERAD). On the other hand, because
  DNAJB9 and BiP are less available, IRE-1 could dimerize and activate UPR, leading
  to another pathway of protein degradation. DNAJB9, DnaJ homolog subfamily B member
  9.
