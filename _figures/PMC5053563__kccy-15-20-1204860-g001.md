caption: The life cycle of blebs is governed by 2 small GTPases. Rnd3 is preferentially
  recruited to the actin cortex-free membrane protrusion. During expansion phase,
  reassembly of actin cortex was actively suppressed by Rnd3-p190BRhoGAP complex and
  bleb continues to expand passively by the intracellular pressure. Sporadic activation
  of RhoA is stabilized locally by the phosphorylation of Rnd3 by RhoA-ROCK pathway
  because phosphorylated Rnd3 is removed from the plasma membrane.
