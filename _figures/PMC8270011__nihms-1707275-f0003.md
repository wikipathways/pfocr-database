caption: Mechanisms linking increased venous hydrostatic pressure to upregulation
  of MMPs in varicose veins. Increased lower extremity venous hydrostatic pressure
  causes vein wall stretch, increased HIF mRNA expression and protein levels, and
  increased MMP levels. Increased vein wall stretch could also increase other MMP
  inducers such as EMMPRIN, chymase, hormones and neutrophil gelatinase-associated
  lipocalin (NGAL). Increased MMPs may activate protease activated receptors (PARs)
  in endothelial cells leading to activation of NO-cGMP pathway or EDHF and BKCa channels
  in VSM, leading to hyperpolarization, decreased Ca2+ influx, and VSM relaxation.
  Prolonged loss of contractile function in VSM causes a phenotypic switch to synthetic
  VSMCs and increased propensity to stretch. MMPs may also increase the release of
  growth factors and cause ECM degradation leading to VSMC migration, further decreases
  in vein contraction and increases in venous dilation, and VVs. MMP-induced ECM degradation
  may also cause valve degeneration leading to further increases in venous hydrostatic
  pressure. As indicated in shaded arrows, inhibitors of MMP synthesis (U-0126, HIF
  siRNA, 17-DMAG, Echinomycin, MMP siRNA), activity (MMP Inhibitor) or actions (Iberiotoxin)
  represent potential new tools for management of VVs. BKCa, large conductance Ca2+-activated
  K+ channels; DMOG, dimethyloxallyl glycine, inhibitor of HIF-prolyl hydroxylase;
  HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; Hsp90, heat shock protein 90. MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase.
