caption: In the classical insect cell pathway, GDP-D-mannose gets converted to GDP-L-fucose
  by a cascade of different enzymes. This precursor is then attached to the native
  N-glycan chain by using cellular fucosyltransferases (FT3 / FT6). The whole pathway
  can be blocked by the overexpression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa GDP-6-deoxy-D-lyxo-4-hexulose
  reductase (RMD) which converts GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose to the dead-end product
  GDP-D-rhamnose. This product, typically not present in vertebrate cells, may further
  block GMD by a negative feedback loop.
