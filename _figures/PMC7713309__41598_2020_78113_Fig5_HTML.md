caption: Ingenuity pathway analyses of the dendritic cell maturation pathway (A) and
  TREM-1 signaling pathway (B) at 72 h post-infection, and expression level of related
  genes (C). Genes shown in red indicate upregulation, genes shown in green indicate
  downregulation, genes shown in orange indicate predicted activation, genes shown
  in blue indicate predicted inhibition, and an uncolored node indicates that the
  genes were not differentially expressed in this pathway. The log2 Fold-change of
  each group is described by a color scale. Genes that were not significant (p-value ≥ 0.05
  or Log2FC < 1.0) are shown as N/A.
