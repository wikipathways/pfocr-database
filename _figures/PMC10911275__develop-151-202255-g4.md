caption: FlyBase Pathway Report pages. (A-D) Three visual summaries are presented
  on the Pathway pages, exemplified with the EGFR Signaling Pathway. (A) The GO ribbon
  stack is a graphical summary of the GO annotations for each gene, with annotations
  grouped under high-level categories. The color intensity of each cell indicates
  how many unique terms are grouped in that particular category. The unique terms
  that are grouped under a particular cell can be seen by hovering over or clicking
  on the cell, as shown for one of the cells of cic. (B) A thumbnail review-style
  image for the EGFR Signaling Pathway. (C,D) A physical interaction network in which
  the nodes represent genes, the sizes of which are proportional to the number of
  supporting papers, up to ≥10. C shows the ‘Pathway view’ and D shows the ‘Functional
  view’ (for visual simplicity, we selected fewer higher level categories compared
  with the thumbnails). The edges represent physical interactions between components,
  from FlyBase. Unconnected nodes are also displayed
