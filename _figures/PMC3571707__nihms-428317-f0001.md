caption: A) Tumor cell death induced by oncogenic signal blockade and ADCC upon binding
  of anti-Her2/neu to the Her2 receptor induces release of danger signals, like HMGB-1,
  from apoptotic or stressed tumor cells. B) HMGB1 is recognized alone or in complex
  with other molecules, such as ssDNA, to activate dendritic cells and promote cytokine
  production via activation of the MyD88 pathway. C) MyD88 signaling enhances cross-presentation
  and activates dendritic cells and also induces the release of Type-1 IFNs. D) These
  dendritic cells can either remain in the tumor or travel to the lymph node and prime
  CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of the adaptive immune system. Primed T cells leave the lymph
  node and travel back to the tumor
