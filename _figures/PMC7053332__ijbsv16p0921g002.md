caption: 'The effect of ALDH in liver fibrosis. Acetaldehyde can be taken up by HSCs
  in a paracrine fashion. Both acetaldehyde and 4-HNE can promote collagen I synthesis
  in HSCs through JNK/ERK/ AP-1 signaling. MAA adduct stimulate Kupffer cells to produce
  a higher level of IL-6, which in synergy with acetaldehyde or MAA, can enhance the
  expression of αSMA protein and promote HSC activation and proliferation via p38
  MAPK and ERK1/2 activation. The PPARγ transcriptional activity is inhibited by acetaldehyde
  through rapid activation of PKCδ and the ERK1/2 pathway, contributing to activation
  of HSCs. Then activated HSCs are the main source of excessive ECM production. Abbreviations:
  ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase; AP-1, activating protein-1; ECM, extracellular matrix;
  HSCs, hepatic stellate cells; 4-HNE, 4-hydroxy-nonenal; IL, interleukin; JNK, c-Jun
  amino-terminal kinase; MAA, malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma; αSMA, α-smooth muscle actin.'
