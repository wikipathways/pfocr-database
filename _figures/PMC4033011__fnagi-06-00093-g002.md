caption: 'Possible pathways for LRP1-mediated Aβ uptake. LRP1 regulates Aβ internalization
  on the cell surface through several possible endocytic pathways: (1) Aβ binds to
  LRP1 directly for endocytosis through clathrin-dependent pathways; (2) Aβ binds
  to alternative cell surface receptors such as HSPG and PrPc with LRP1 directly or
  indirectly regulating Aβ endocytosis in a clathrin- or caveolin-dependent manner;
  (3) LRP1 may affect RhoA-mediated endocytic pathway for cellular Aβ uptake by regulating
  signal transduction pathways; (4) LRP1 controls the cytoskeleton architectures by
  modifying PI3K and/or FAK pathways, which may influence macropinocytosis or phagocytosis
  of Aβ in specific cell types. The majority of endocytosed Aβ traffics to lysosomes
  for subsequent degradation, whereas a small amount of Aβ can be recycled. Under
  some conditions, Aβ is likely to be exocytosed from the late endosomes/multi-vesicular
  body, which may induce propagation of Aβ aggregates. When Aβ accumulation overwhelms
  the capacity of lysosomes for degradation, Aβ aggregation may be induced in lysosomes.'
