caption: A model depicting that PER3 regulates stemness of PCSCs via WNT/β-catenin
  pathway. Our results suggest that in PCa TME, PCa DN cells (non-PCSCs) bear high
  levels of PER3, which downregulates the expression of BMAL1 and prevents the translocation
  of β-catenin from cytoplasm into nucleus to activate WNT/β-catenin pathway. On the
  other hand, PCa DP cells (PCSCs) have low levels of PER3, which upregulates BMAL1
  expression, leading to the translocation of β-catenin from cytoplasm into nucleus
  to eventually activate WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway.
