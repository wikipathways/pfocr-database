caption: 'The stroma phenotype of catabolic tumor. (A) Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  production by rapidly proliferating cancer cells causes oxidative stress in surrounding
  stromal cells, causing changes such as cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) transformation,
  activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB),
  transforming growth factor (TGF), or c-Jun N- terminal kinase (JNK)/activator protein
  1 (AP1) signaling pathways, a switch to aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction,
  autophagy and senescence, and cytokine release: the catabolic tumor stroma phenotype.
  (B) Increased glycolysis and autophagy result in increased synthesis of energy-rich
  metabolites, such as lactate, which are produced by stromal cells and taken up by
  cancer cells, where they drive mitochondrial metabolism and adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) production. Chemotherapy promotes the antioxidant response, immunological
  response, and stemness in cancer cells by inducing the catabolic tumor stroma phenotype.
  (C) Chemotherapy-induced DNA damage activates the HIF1, NF-kB, TGF, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and JNK/AP1 signaling pathways in stromal
  cells, promoting CAF differentiation, a switch to aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial
  dysfunction, autophagy and senescence, the release of inflammatory cytokines, and
  the inhibition of interferon-mediated signaling. (D) When cancer cells encounter
  these catabolic fibroblasts, they respond to chemotherapy by activating antioxidant
  and immune response signals, as well as stemness. The red color up arrow symbol
  (↑) represents up-regulation, while the down arrow symbol (↓) represents down-regulation'
