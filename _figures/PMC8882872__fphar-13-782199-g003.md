caption: 'Networks in CKD pathogenesis. TGF-β1 pathway: TGF-β1 signaling is initiated
  through serine/threonine kinase receptors, TGF-β1 receptor (TβR)-I and TβRII. TGF-β
  binding to TβRII recruits TβRI to form a receptor heterodimer, which is phosphorylated.
  SMAD2 and SMAD3 are recruited to the receptor heterodimer and are also phosphorylated.
  SMAD2 and SMAD3 co-localize with SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus to activate
  genes, such as collagen and TGF-β1. ACE2 activity promotes the production of SMAD7,
  potentially via Ang-(1–7)-induced Mas or AT2R receptor signals. SMAD7 is a negative
  regulator of TGF-β1 by recruiting E3 ligases to TβRI and blocking TβRI-induced SMAD2/3
  phosphorylation. Ligand activated AHR antagonizes TGF-β1 and collagen gene expression
  and protein production, which are associated with fibrosis. Ligand activated AHR
  also induces the degradation of collagen through the production of matrix metalloproteinase-1
  (MMP1). Renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS): Angiotensin I (Ang I) is cleaved
  by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) into Ang II. The binding of Ang II to AT1R
  or AT2R promotes the stable expression of HIF-1α and hypoxic responses. The ACE
  homolog, ACE2, inactivates Ang II by cleaving and processing Ang I and Ang II into
  Ang-(1–7), which is a ligand for the Mas receptor and AT2R. AHR regulates the expression
  of ACE2 and Mas. AT2R activation promotes TβRII degradation, inhibiting TGF-β1 signals.
  NAD de novo biosynthesis pathway (also known as the kynurenine pathway): Tryptophan
  catabolism is the defining feature of this pathway. The rate limiting enzymes are
  indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan dioxygenase (TDO). IDO1 is induced
  by AHR:ARNT transcriptional activation of the IDO promoter and promotes the production
  of kynurenine, which can be released as a cytokine. A series of additional enzymes
  (highlighted in white) catalyze the production of immunomodulatory and neuroregulatory
  molecules that are further processed into NAD. Anaerobic metabolism: The production
  of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the absence of oxygen occurs through enzymatic
  reactions in glycolysis and results in the production of lactate and the increased
  formation of NADH relative to NAD. Enzymes in this pathway are regulated by HIF-1α
  activated genes (highlighted in orange), which can be stabilized by the RAAS. NAD
  salvage pathway: The primary source of mammalian NAD is from the recycling nicotinamide,
  which is the amide version of vitamin B3 and a by-product from the enzymatic activity
  of Poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) and sirtuins. The rate limiting enzyme is
  nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), which is transcriptionally activated
  by HIF-2α and functions as an extracellular cytokine. Indicators of disruption in
  homeostasis: Factors and conditions along these pathways are induced during CKD
  pathogenesis.'
