caption: MYC’s role in (A) replication and (B,C) replication stress. (A) The origin
  recognition complex (ORC) binds to the replication origin site and recruits the
  DNA replication factor Cdt1 (CDT1) and the cell division control protein 6 homolog
  (CDC6), which aid in the loading of the DNA replication licensing factor (MCM2-7)
  helicases to form the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC). The pre-RC is phosphorylated
  by CDK2 and protein DBF4 homolog A/B (DBF4/DRF1)-dependent cell division cycle 7-related
  protein kinase (CDC7), permitting recruitment of cell division control protein 45
  homolog (CDC45) and the DNA replication complex GINS. During origin licensing, MYC
  physically interacts with pre-RC components such as ORC, CDC6, CDT1, and MCMs. MYC
  also promotes ORI activation by boosting CDC45 chromatin binding, a replication
  factor required for DNA replication initiation. (B) When the pRB-E2F pathway is
  disrupted, MYC protein can alleviate replication stress by enhancing nucleotide
  biosynthesis pathways, increasing the purine and pyrimidine pool, and relieving
  replication stress caused by high DNA synthesis rates. MYC proteins also directly
  enhance the expression of specific replication proteins, including the WRN helicase,
  which resolves odd replication intermediates, and the MRN nuclease. (C) Activation
  of MYC causes DNA damage and genomic instability by impairing DNA replication dynamics,
  causing collisions between replication and transcription machinery. The MYC-induced
  replication stress indirectly activates the cyclin E/CDK2 complex by inducing CCND2
  gene expression, inactivating the CDK inhibitor P27KIP1, or stimulating E2F–mediated
  gene expression. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 1 February 2022).
