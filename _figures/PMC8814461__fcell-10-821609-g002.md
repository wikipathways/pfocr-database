caption: The underlying mechanisms involved in circRNA-mediated chemoresistance in
  gastrointestinal cancer. CircRNAs function as master regulators of drug resistance
  in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer via diverse pathways. Circ_0000337 and circVAPA
  strengthen chemotherapy-resistant characteristics of GI cancer by activating the
  JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Circ_0000260 induces an increase in the expression
  level of MMP11, the downstream molecule of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. As a result,
  circ_0000260 promotes cancer cell metastasis and confers chemoresistance to GI cancer
  cells. Circ_0026359 and hsa_circ_0001546 exert opposite effects on the DNA damage
  repair pathway, and they serve as important players in GI cancer chemoresistance.
  Circ_0071589 and circDONSON accelerate cell cycle progression by elevating Cyclin
  D expression. Consequently, these circRNAs induce the drug-resistant phenotype in
  GI cancer. CircFAM73A causes CSC self-renewal in GI cancer via upregulating stemness-relevant
  transcription factors (e.g., Nanog, OCT4 and SOX2) by reinforcing HMGA2 expression.
  Hsa_circ_001680 promotes CSC growth by inducing the key regulator of CSC self-renewal,
  BMI1, leading to the acquisition of chemoresistance in GI cancer. CircAKT3 and hsa_circ_0000520
  affect the responsiveness of GI cancer cells to chemotherapy by regulating the PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway. CircPSMC3 reduces the proliferation of GI cancer cells by increasing
  PTEN expression and sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Circ_0032821,
  circ-PVT1, circCCDC66 and circ_0000338 facilitate the survival and proliferation
  of GI cancer cells by controlling the expression of their cellular targets (e.g.,
  SOX9 and HDGF). CiRS-122 and circNRIP1 favor glucose metabolism to fuel cancer cell
  growth, resulting in the development of drug resistance in GI cancer. Circ-FBXW7
  decreases drug efflux transporter MRP1 expression to augment the cytotoxicity of
  anticancer drugs toward GI cancer cells. In contrast, circ_0007031 raises the expression
  level of ABCC5 and thus protects GI cancer cells from chemotherapeutic agent-induced
  cell killing. Various circRNAs have been involved in cell death pathways (apoptosis
  and autophagy). Particularly, circHECTD1 and circ-PVT1 diminish the expression of
  pro-apoptotic Bax. cDOPEY2, circVAPA, circ-PVT1, circ_0071589, circCCDC66 and circHECTD1
  can target anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. CircDONSON,
  circ_0071589 and circ-PVT1 limit the expression of the apoptotic effector caspase-3,
  while circ-FBXW7 has an antagonistic role. Circ_0000338 suppresses cell apoptosis
  by sponging miR-217 and miR-485-3p. Both circMCTP2 and circCUL2 block the autophagic
  flux. Given the association between autophagy and drug resistance, these two circRNAs
  play a critical role in regulation of chemotherapy response in GI cancer. Circ-PVT1
  and circ-PRKDC mobilize the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade to drive the EMT process
  and cancer cell invasion. The EMT-inducing potential of circRNAs accounts for their
  promotive effects on the development of drug resistance in GI cancer. Arrows in
