caption: 'The maximally tolerated dose of rats was determined in pre-experiment (A).
  Pre-experiment was employed to determine a dose that can cause poisoning but is
  not lethal. The animals were divided into three groups: SSE 100, 125, and 150 mg/kg,
  with three rats in each group. The experimental workflow for SSE intoxication and
  ISL detoxification (B).'
