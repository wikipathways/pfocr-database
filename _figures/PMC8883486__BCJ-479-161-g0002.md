caption: Cellular senescence leads to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), which can induce senescence. ROS interact with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
  at various locations during signal transduction and induce DNA damage. DNA damage
  induces activation of NF-κB via ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase activating
  the inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) complex. ROS are thought to directly affect
  downstream targets by activating and deactivating the IKK complex, which occurs
  in a cell type-specific manner. Compared with canonical IKK activation, ROS can
  alternatively activate the NF-κB complex through the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)–casein
  kinase II (CKII) pathway by phosphorylation of IκBα at Y42. Phosphorylation of p65
  at S276 by ROS activates the DNA binding of p65, resulting in greater NF-κB activation
  (adapted from []).
