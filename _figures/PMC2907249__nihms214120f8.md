caption: This is a hypothetical model describing the possible mechanism(s) involved
  in the in vivo antitumor effect of the combination of celecoxib with docetaxel The
  combination of celecoxib with docetaxel significantly decreases the intratumor PGE2
  levels (by inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity of tumor stromal cells and possibly
  via reduced expression of mPGE synthase), which is associated with a concomitant
  increase in the intratumor levels of 15-d PGJ2. The inhibition of intratumor PGE2
  levels may contribute to the reduction in the tumor growth by inhibition of angiogenesis
  (supported by the reduced VEGF expression in tumor tissues obtained from the celecoxib
  with docetaxel-treated-mice as observed in our study and as reported elsewhere)
  and induction of stromal cell apoptosis. The combination treatment has an inhibitory
  effect on cPLA2 expression, which may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from
  membrane lipids and also contribute to the apoptosis as observed by Yu et al. The
  combination of celecoxib with docetaxel treatment resulted in an increase in the
  intratumor expression of PPAR-γ and p53 protein. As hypothesized of Badawi et al.
  that inhibition of PGE2synthesis and activation of PPAR-γ may switch the cells back
  to PGD2 and PGJ series dominated state, which may contribute to the inhibition of
  tumor growth. The upregulation of p53 is one of the important modes of apoptosis
  induction by taxanes and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs., Recent evidence
  suggests that COX-2 and p53 exhibit physiologically relevant interactions in A549
  cells, where it has been shown that endogenous p53 co-precipitating with endogenous
  COX-2 using COX-2 specific antibodies. It has also been shown that a COX-2 selective
  inhibitor potentiates p53-induced apoptosis. It has been hypothesized that overexpression
  of COX-2 in various tumors negatively affect p53 function that harbor wild-type
  p53 and further the antitumor activity of COX-2 inhibitors may be attributed to
  the inhibition of COX-2 activity, thereby protecting wild-type p53 from negative
  effects of COX-2 resulting in tumor growth inhibition. The direct effect of the
  combination of celecoxib with docetaxel is indicated by bold arrow. The arachidonic
