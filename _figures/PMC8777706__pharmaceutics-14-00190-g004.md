caption: 'The cancer-preventive mechanism of sulforaphane through the NF-kB pathway
  (A) and the Nrf2 pathway (B). (A)—Sulforaphane can inhibit the phosphorylation of
  IkB and consequently the nuclear translocation of the subunit p65 of NF-κB, which
  affects the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. (B)—Sulforaphane alters the
  interaction between Nrf2 and Keap-1, releasing Nrf2 and inducing its nuclear translocation.
  Subsequently, this transcriptional factor upregulates the expression of phase II
  enzymes and antioxidant enzymes. ARE: antioxidant response element; IκB: inhibitor
  of kappa B; Keap-1: Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; MAF: Nrf2 transcriptional
  cofactor; Nrf2: nuclear factor E2-related factor 2; ROS: reactive oxygen species.
