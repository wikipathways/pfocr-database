caption: The C3 inhibitor Cp40 and its targets in the setting of periodontitis. Complement
  is involved both in the dysbiotic transformation of the periodontal microbiota and
  in the inflammatory process that leads to the degradation of periodontal tissue
  which in turn exacerbates dysbiosis, leading to the generation of a vicious cycle
  of dysbiosis and destructive inflammation. Complement inhibition using the C3 inhibitor
  Cp40 (AMY-101) can block both dysbiosis and destructive inflammation, thereby reversing
  periodontitis.
