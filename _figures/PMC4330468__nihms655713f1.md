caption: Molecular targets and associated therapies to block three immunosuppressive
  checkpoints in a malignant brain tumor (glioma) model. Glioma cells overexpress
  IDO to convert l-tryptophan to N′-formyl-kynurenine, the first step in the kynurenine
  metabolic pathway, which induces the accumulation of immunosuppressive Tregs in
  the tumor microenvironment. Therapy 1, the tryptophan analog, 1-MT, used as an IDO-specific
  competitive inhibitor. CD80 molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells
  (i.e., APC) interact with CTLA4 on the T-cell surface in the context of antigen-presenting
  MHC class I, inhibiting T-cell activation and decreasing proliferation, resulting
  in suppressed antitumor effector function. Therapy 2, anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies
  bind to CTLA4, inhibiting its immunosuppressive signal, while promoting the interaction
  of CD80 with CD28, a T cell–activating receptor. Glioma cells express PDL1, which
  interacts with its cognate receptor PD1 on the T-cell surface to downregulate tumor
  lytic capacity and promote T-cell anergy in the context of tumor antigen-presenting
  MHC class I. Therapy 3, anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibodies bind to PDL1 on the surface
  of tumor cells to enable T cells to remain in an activated state characterized by
  high tumor lytic capacity and increased proliferation.
