caption: Major glucose metabolism pathway under physiological condition and diabetic
  condition. (a) Under a physiological condition, intracellular glucose is converted
  to glucose-6-phosphate, via hexokinase, then following isomerization to fructose-6-phosphate.
  Along glycolysis pathway, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate travels down to pyruvate and
  acetyl CoA via pyruvate dehydrogenase, which then enters tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle. NADH, as electron carrier and generated during the process of glycolysis
  and glucose oxidation, can donate reducing equivalents to the mitochondrial electron
  transport chain (ETC), thereby creating a proton gradient that is used by ATP synthase
  to produce ATP and converting O2 to H2O. (b) Under diabetic condition, glucose metabolism
  is impaired, causing accumulation of glucose and the glycolytic intermediates, resulting
  mitochondrial injury, thereby converting O2 to superoxide radical (O2•−) instead
  of H2O. As a result, ATP production is reduced.
