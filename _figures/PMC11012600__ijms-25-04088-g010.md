caption: A working model for the involvement of FvNAC29 in the regulation of cold
  and salt stress in plants. FvNAC29 receives signals to be activated when plants
  are exposed to low-temperature or high-salt environments. On the one hand, FvNAC29
  participates in the CBF pathway, binds to the promoters of AtCBF1 and AtCBF4 to
  promote their binding to CRT/DRE, and activates the expression of the downstream
  genes, AtCOR15a and AtCOR47, to enhance the plant’s tolerance to the low-temperature
  environment. On the other hand, FvNAC29 participates in the ABA signaling pathway
  and promotes the expression of the downstream genes AtRD29a, AtCCA1, AtP5CS1, and
  AtSnRK2.4 to realize the enhancement in salt tolerance in plants
