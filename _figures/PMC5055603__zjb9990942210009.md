caption: Schematic summarization of the regulatory roles of AphA in V. alginolyticus.
  The KEGG pathway analysis was performed with the Kobas 2.0 (). The various pathways
  and their respective cellular locations, as well as the regulatory roles of AphA,
  are illustrated with arrows (activation) or bar-ended lines (repression) and are
  discussed in the text. The inferred stronger inhibition of motilities by LuxR outcompetes
  CsrB-mediated activation of motilities and is depicted with a thicker bar-ended
  line. See the related text for detailed explanation.
