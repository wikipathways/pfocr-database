caption: 'Induction of interferons (IFNs) and establishment of an antiviral state
  in a model chicken cell. The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), detected by either chicken
  retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like helicase (RLH) [melanoma differentiation-associated
  gene 5 (MDA5) or laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) individually or
  in cooperation] or toll-like receptor (TLR)3 (endosomal, phagosomal, or transmembrane)
  initiates downstream signaling mediated through mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
  protein (MAVS) or TRIF, respectively. These adaptor molecules then activate the
  transcription factors IFN regulatory factor (IRF)7, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB),
  and activating protein 1 (AP-1) (ATF2/JUN) by orchestrating the assembly of multi-protein
  complexes. Once activated, IRF7, NF-κB, and AP-1 translocate to the nucleus where
  they stimulate the transcription of, among others, type I IFNs (e.g., IFN-β). The
  transcribed, translated, and secreted type I IFNs initiate the JAK–STAT pathway
  by both autocrine (depicted in the figure) and paracrine signaling through cognate
  type I IFN receptor recognition. Activated JAK–STAT leads to the phosphorylation
  of STAT1 and STAT2 molecules, which (together with factors that are currently unknown
  in chicken) results in the formation of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3)
  transcription factor complex. This multifunctional transcription factor then scans
  and recognizes unique IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) sequences to initiate
  the transcription of hundreds of chicken IFN-stimulated genes (chISGs), which subsequently
  establish the antiviral state against the invading viruses. Few examples of IFN-stimulated
  genes (ISGs) along with a summarized description of their functions are enlisted
  in the right panel of the figure. Abbreviations used in the figure and are not described
  in the main text are as follows: IκB kinase (IKK) epsilon (IKKε), alpha (IKKα),
  beta (IKKβ), and gamma (IKKγ); NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO); TANK-binding kinase
  1 (TBK1); inhibitors of NF-κB (IκB), NF-κB subunits p50 and p65; activating transcription
  factor 2 (ATF2); tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2); Janus kinase 1 (JAK1); signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), and STAT2. “P” represents the phosphorylation
  state of the protein, and dotted lines indicate the involvement of multiple intermediary
  steps.'
