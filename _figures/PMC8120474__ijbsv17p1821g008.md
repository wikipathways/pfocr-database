caption: 'Working model of AS-IV promoting osteogenesis along with preosteoclast-induced
  angiogenesis during DO by activating AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway. Under the administration
  of AS-IV, AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling is activated in BMSCs and macrophages.
  In BMSCs, the osteogenic potential is enhanced, and the expression of angiogenic
  genes is up-regulated. Additionally, in RANKL-induced macrophages, the activated
  AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling inhibits the maturation of multinucleated osteoclasts,
  increasing the production of PDGF-BB from preosteoclasts, thus enhancing the angiogenesis
  of ECs. In conclusion, AS-IV could directly promote osteogenesis and indirectly
  improve angiogenesis by activating AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling in BMSCs and macrophages
  simultaneously, thus enhancing the coupling of osteogenesis and angiogenesis and
  accelerating bone regeneration during DO. AS-IV: astragaloside IV. AKT: protein
  kinase B. GSK-3β: glycogen synthase kinase-3β. BMSCs: bone marrow derived mesenchymal
  stem cells. DO: distraction osteogenesis. RANKL: receptor activator for nuclear
  factor κB ligand. PDGF-BB: platelet-derived growth factor-BB. ECs: endothelial cells.'
