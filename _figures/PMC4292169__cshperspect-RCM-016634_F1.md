caption: The meiotic recombination pathway. A segment of one sister chromatid from
  each homolog (black, gray) is shown. Spo11 (ovals) catalyzes DSB formation, in association
  with partner proteins. Endonucleolytic cleavage on either side of the DSB (black
  arrowheads) releases Spo11 covalently attached to a short oligonucleotide. The DNA
  ends undergo 5′-to-3′ resection. A 3′ ssDNA tail invades a homologous duplex DNA
  and initiates repair synthesis. Repair can proceed by either a double Holliday junction
  (dHJ) pathway, or synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA). In the dHJ pathway,
  the second end of the DSB is captured to form a dHJ, and its resolution primarily
  gives rise to crossover recombinants. Only one cleavage pattern for dHJ resolution
  is shown (gray arrowheads). In SDSA, the invading 3′ strand is displaced after DNA
  synthesis and reanneals to the other 3′ end of the DSB, followed by further DNA
  synthesis and nick ligation, ultimately giving rise to noncrossover recombinant
  products.
