caption: GUN1 is involved in photosynthesis and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. The large
  subunit of Rubisco and the β-subunit of the thylakoid ATP synthase have been coimmunoprecipitated
  with GUN1, supporting a role for GUN1 in coordinating nucleoid activities with chloroplast
  metabolism. GUN1 also interacts with four enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis
  pathway, i.e., the D subunit of Mg chelatase (CHLD), porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD),
  uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase (UROD2), and ferrochelatase I (FC1), as shown
  by yeast two-hybrid and Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation. Note that the
  proteins RER4 and 2-Cys PrxA have not been included in this scheme for reasons of
  clarity.
