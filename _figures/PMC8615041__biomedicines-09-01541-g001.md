caption: Signaling pathways triggered by IL-36α, LPS, and autophagy inducers. (A)
  The IL-36α signaling pathway. IL-36α/β/γ bind to the IL-36R (IL-1Rrp2) and use the
  IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) as a co-receptor. Following ligand binding,
  the TIR domain—located in the intracellular portion of the IL-36R:IL-1RAcP heterodimer—recruits
  MyD88 adaptor protein, which in turn interacts with IRAKs and TRAF-6. The MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6
  platform activates AP-1, CREB and NF-κB transcription factors via IKK, ERKs, JNKs,
  and p38. (B) The LPS/TLR4 signaling pathway. LBP and CD14 bind and transfer LPS
  monomers to the TLR4/MD-2 heterodimer. The dimerized TIR domain in the cytoplasmic
  portion of TLR4 consecutively recruits TIRAP, MyD88, and IRAK proteins, thus leading
  to the assembly of a supramolecular complex termed the myddosome. The LPS-TLR4/MD2
  complexes can also be internalized into endosomes. The TIR domain of endosomal TLR4
  binds TRAM, which attracts TRIF resulting in the formation of another complex called
  the triffosome. Myddosomes and triffosomes recruit TRAF6 or TRAF3 and activate AP-1,
  NF-κB, CREB, and IRF-3 via MAPKs, IKK, and PI3K. (C) The autophagy-related signaling
  pathway. The major element in the regulation of autophagy is the mTORC1. Besides
  mTOR, mTORC1 is comprised of the Raptor and mLST8 molecules. The non-core components
  associated with mTORC1 include PRAS40 and DEPTOR. Autophagy inducers inhibit mTORC1,
  and thereby activate the autophagic cascade. Inhibition of mTORC1 results in the
  consecutive activation of the ULK1 and PI3KC3 complexes. The PI3KC3 complex contains
  Beclin-1 protein. The activated PI3KC3 induces local production of PI3P at the endoplasmic
  reticulum membrane and thereby promotes the generation of an omegasome from which
  the isolation membrane is generated. PI3P recruits two ubiquitin-like conjugation
  systems, the ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L1 and ATG7/ATG3 complexes, to the omegasome. ATG3
  forms a covalent bond between the membrane-resident phosphatidylethanolamine and
  the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B-I (LC3B-I) protein. The ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L1
  complex enhances the ATG3-mediated conjugation of LC3B-I. The lipidated LC3B protein
  is termed LC3B-II. LC3B-II is essential for the elongation and closure of the phagophore
  membrane, trafficking of the autophagosomes, and their fusion with lysosomes. AP-1,
