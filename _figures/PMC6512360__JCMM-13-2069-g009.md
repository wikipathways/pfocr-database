caption: 'Schematic representation of the type I immune response in M. avium infection
  and its transcriptional perturbation in Irf1‐ and Ifnγ‐deficient mice. The pathway
  components of IFN‐γ induction, signalling and effector functions are shown and assigned
  to macrophages and T cells as the prime host and effector cells during mycobacterial
  lung infection. The assignment of genes to the different effector function groups
  is tentative. Regulation of gene expression during M. avium infection in WT and
  gene‐deficient mice is depicted as fold change relative to the respective uninfected
  control in bar plots (WT: grey bars; IRF‐1‐KO: olive bars; IFN‐γ‐KO: orange bars).
  The corresponding values are listed in Table S3.'
