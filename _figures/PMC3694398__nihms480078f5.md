caption: Figure 5A. NFATc1 as part of the non-canonical Wnt-Frizzled pathway. Wnt-Frizzled
  pathway is implicated in many malignancies, most notably colorectal cancer in which
  Wnt activates its canonical β-catenin-TCF pathway for signal transduction and nuclear
  transcription. In CML cells, non-canonical Wnt pathway activates NFATc1 pathway,
  causing activation of IL-4, leading to the resistance to TKI therapy [].Figure 5B.
  NFAT promotes cancer metastasis and angiogenesis. In many cancer cell types, NFAT
  can activate COX2, c-Myc, Wnt, Frizzled, SFRP2 and others to cause increased cell
  migration, metastasis, and angiogenesis. This NFAT action is context dependent and
  is responsive to the external stimuli such as the activation of RTKs, integrin,
  and Wnt pathway (also see ).
