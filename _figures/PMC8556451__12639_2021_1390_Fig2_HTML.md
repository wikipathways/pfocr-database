caption: Enzyme catalyzed sterol biosynthetic pathway reactions leading to the formation
  of ergosterol and cholesterol in Leishmania and human, respectively. Enzymes required
  in each step of the reaction comprised HMGS, 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme
  A synthase; HMGR, 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase; FPPS, Farnesyl-pyrophosphate
  synthase; SQS, Squalene synthase; SQE, Squalene epoxidase; LSO, Lanosterol oxidase;
  CYP51, Sterol 14alpha-demethylase Cytochrome P450; 24-SMT, Δ24 Sterol methyltransferase;
  24-SR, Sterol C-24 reductase; Emopamil-Binding Protein (EBP), Sterol Δ8(7) – isomerase;
  SC5DL, Sterol C-5 desaturase; and DHCR7, Sterol- Δ7-reductase
