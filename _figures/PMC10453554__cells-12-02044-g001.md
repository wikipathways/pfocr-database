caption: The Cyclin K-CDK12/13 complexes affect important biological processes and
  contribute to cancer development by phosphorylating different targets. Cyclin K-CDK12/13
  phosphorylates the carboxy terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II to control
  transcription elongation and mRNA processing. This gives rise to the increased transcription
  of DNA damage repair genes and DNA replication genes, as well as multiple genes
  that are involved in the activation of cancer signaling. Cyclin K-CDK12/13 also
  phosphorylates 4E-BP1 to facilitate translation initiation. The mitotic regulators
  are the translation-specific targets in this process, allowing for accelerated mitotic
  progression. The p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) target is another phosphorylation
  target of Cyclin K-CDK12. By phosphorylating PAK2, Cyclin K-CDK12 activates the
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. As a result, Cyclin K-CDK12/13
  promotes oncogenesis, cancer progression, and drug resistance

  description: The Cyclin K-CDK12/13 complexes affect important biological processes
    and contribute to cancer development by phosphorylating different targets. Cyclin
    K-CDK12/13 phosphorylates the carboxy terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase
    II to control transcription elongation and mRNA processing. This gives rise to
    the increased transcription of DNA damage repair genes and DNA replication genes,
    as well as multiple genes that are involved in the activation of cancer signaling.
    Cyclin K-CDK12/13 also phosphorylates 4E-BP1 to facilitate translation initiation.
    The mitotic regulators are the translation-specific targets in this process, allowing
    for accelerated mitotic progression. The p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) target
    is another phosphorylation target of Cyclin K-CDK12. By phosphorylating PAK2,
    Cyclin K-CDK12 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
    pathway. As a result, Cyclin K-CDK12/13 promotes oncogenesis, cancer progression,
