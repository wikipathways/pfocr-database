caption: A proposed model of resveratrol (RES) exerts antiviral effects against ASFV
  and alleviates oxidative stress induced by ASFV infection through the Nrf2 signaling
  pathway. Black arrows indicate that oxidative stress caused by increased ROS level
  activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway. ASFV infection suppresses the Nrf2 signaling
  pathway, resulting in oxidative stress. RES induces the production of GSH by activating
  the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which in turn inhibits ASFV replication and reduces
  the ROS level induced by ASFV infection
