caption: Schematic representation of the proposed signalling pathway. Loss of JAM-A
  increases the abundance of PIP3 through (1) the activation of PI3K and (2) inactivation
  of PTEN. Consequently, in the absence of JAM-A, Akt is recruited to the membrane
  and phosphorylated at Thr 308 probably by its activating kinase PDK1. Active Akt
  phosphorylates β-catenin at Ser 552, which promotes its nuclear translocation and
  enhances its activity as a transcription cofactor for TCF. Thus, we propose that
  JAM-A (dimerization) restricts epithelial-cell proliferation by negatively regulating
  Akt/β-catenin signalling. JAM-A, junctional adhesion molecule-A; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase 1; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue; TCF, T-cell factor.
