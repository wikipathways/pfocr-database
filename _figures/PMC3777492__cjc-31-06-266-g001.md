caption: Together with G-proteins, IGFBP5 can induce phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and
  p38 MAPK. IGFBP5 can act independently of IGF-I to stimulate proliferation and up-regulate
  IGF-I production through Ras-dependent activation of Grb-Sos-Mek-Erk1/2 and p38
  MAPK. Activation of these pathways stimulates proliferation as well as IGFBP5 production.
  IGFBP5 and IGF-I secretion are linked by a positive feedback mechanism that reinforces
  their individual effects on cell growth. The PI3K-Akt pathway is also activated
  by IGFBP5 and IGFIR. Expression of IGFIR is stimulated by steroid and other hormones,
  resulting in an increase in Erk1/2 pathway activation, which in turn stimulates
  IGFBP5 production and proliferation. This suggests a positive feedback loop between
  IGFBP5 and Erk1/2. In some cancer cell lines, the small GTPases Rac, Rho, and Cdc42
  are requisite co-factors in Ras-dependent Raf activation and subsequent activation
  of Erk1/2. IGFBP5-induced growth mediated by the Erk1/2 or p38 MAPK pathways has
  been shown to involve these small GTPases, as well as Raf1, MKK1/2, and SHH, but
  the molecular interactions of these proteins remains unclear.
