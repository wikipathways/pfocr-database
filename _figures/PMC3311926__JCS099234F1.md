caption: 'Mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis. Left: in the intrinsic pathway of
  apoptosis, pro-apoptotic stimuli such as DNA damage activate BH3-only proteins that,
  in turn, activate BAX and BAK. Active BAX and BAK cause mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilisation (MOMP), leading to release of proteins from the intermembrane space,
  including cytochrome c and SMAC (and Omi; not shown), which activate caspases and
  thereby cause apoptosis. MOMP can also lead to caspase-independent cell death. Right:
  in the extrinsic pathway, activation of cell surface death receptors leads to activation
  of the initiator caspase-8. In type II cells, mitochondria are required for apoptosis.
  Following death-receptor ligation, caspase-8 is activated at the OMM where it cleaves
  and activates the BH3-only protein BID, leading to BAX and BAK activation, leading
  to MOMP.'
