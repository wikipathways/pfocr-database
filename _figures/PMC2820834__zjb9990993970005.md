caption: Roles of malyl-CoA/β-methylmalyl-CoA lyase and malyl-CoA thioesterase in
  different pathways. The reactions of malyl-CoA/β-methylmalyl-CoA lyase and malyl-CoA
  thioesterase in different pathways are highlighted in red and blue, respectively.
  (A) Acetate assimilation via the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway (EMPW) in Rhodobacter
  sphaeroides (, -). (B) CO2 fixation via the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle in the phototrophic
  bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus (modified from reference ). Here, malyl-CoA/β-methylmalyl-CoA
  lyase also catalyzes the hydrolysis of citramalyl-CoA into acetyl-CoA and pyruvate,
  the final CO2 assimilation product (). (C) C1 assimilation via the serine cycle
  and reactions of the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway (EMPW) in Methylobacterium extorquens
  AM1 (modified from references  and ). (D) C2 assimilation via the ethylmalonyl-CoA
  pathway in M. extorquens (modified from reference ).
