caption: The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzymatic machinery
  and key metabolic pathways. The mitochondrion is illustrated with its outer mitochondrial
  membrane, inner mitochondrial membrane, and mitochondrial matrix (yellow) along
  with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the fatty acid beta-oxidation with their
  functional link via acetyl-CoA. The reducing agents, NADH and FADH2, produced by
  the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and fatty acid beta-oxidation, are indicated
  along with their two points of entry in the OXPHOS pathway. Magnification of the
  OXPHOS enzymatic machinery with electrons transfer via the two-electron carriers,
  coenzyme Q10 (Q) and cytochrome c (c), is shown below. The electron donor, succinate,
  a product of the TCA cycle, is also indicated acting at the level of complex II.
  Finally, protons translocated from complexes I, III, and IV into the intermembrane
  space (orange) are shown along with protons being transferred back into the mitochondrial
  matrix via complex V, resulting in ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate
  (Pi).
