caption: HIF-1–mediated reprogramming of the glucose metabolic pathway from the mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, which is the so-called ‘Warburg effect’.
  The reprogramming coupled with the activation of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
  induces radioresistance of cancer cells.
