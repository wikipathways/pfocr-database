caption: 'Possible mechanisms for the anticancer activities of LBPs.Notes: LBPs inhibit
  the proliferation of various types of cancer cells and induce cell cycle arrest
  at the G0/G1, S, or G2/M phase. LBPs inhibit the growth of cancer xenografts in
  nude mice. In cancer patients, LAK/IL-2 plus LBP treatment leads to more marked
  increase in NK and LAK cell activity than LAK/IL-2 alone. LBPs regulate the expression
  of Bcl-2 and Bax to induce tumor cell apoptosis via increasing intracellular Ca2+
  concentration and mitochondrial pathway. LBPs inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells
  through activation of Erk1/2 and modulation of estrogen metabolism. LBPs downregulate
  the expression of cyclin D, cyclin E, and CDK2 in colon cancer cells. LBPs stimulate
  p53-mediated apoptosis in liver cancer cells due to inhibition of NF-κB.Abbreviations:
  LBPs, Lycium barbarum polysaccharides; IL-2, interleukin-2; NK, natural killer;
  LAK, lymphokine activated killer; MCF-7, Michigan Cancer Foundation-7; CDK2, cyclin-dependent
  kinase 2; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB.'
