caption: Schematic presentation of the fusion-activated Ca2+ entry (FACE). AT I cells
  release ATP to the extracellular space through the P2X7R (ATP receptor that can
  function as an ATP channel) provoked by mechanical deformation (compression or stretching)
  [, –]. The extracellular ATP activates the P2Y2Rs on the surface of the AT II cells
  in a paracrine manner. The G protein-coupled P2Y2 ATP receptor releases DAG and
  IP3 into the cytoplasm. DAG release leads to the activation of PKC-dependent pathway
  of fusion of LBs with the cell membrane. IP3 release results in the release of intracellular
  Ca2+ by stores that are sensitive to IP3 and Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space
  through several pathways (TRPV2 and STIM1/Orai1). Increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ level
  also promotes the fusion of the LBs with the cell membrane of the AT II cells. These
  two processes create a fusion pore causing the P2X4 ATP receptors in the membrane
  of the LBs to be exposed to extracellular ATP. Activation of these P2X4Rs by extracellular
  ATP strongly increases the local Ca2+ concentration to a much higher level around
  the membrane of the fused vesicles (FACE). FACE promotes a significant expansion
  of the fusion pore resulting in surfactant release by the AT II cells (LBs unpacking)
  and is accompanied by the FACE-induced cations and water migration from the alveolar
  space to the subepithelial interstitium. Clearance of the ATP molecules from the
  extracellular space occurs through the stepwise conversion by ecto-enzymes or by
  soluble extracellular enzymes (CD39 and CD73) to adenosine (ADO). ADO is returned
  to the cytoplasm through ENTs or CNTs and converted by ADA to inosine in the cytoplasm
  or converted by soluble ADA in the extracellular space. AT I alveolar epithelial
