caption: 'Overview of the characterized metabolite transporters of the heterotrophic
  plastid. Non-photosynthetic plastids rely on the import of photosynthates to drive
  the metabolic reactions in the sink tissues. Glucose 6-phosphate is transported
  by GPT to provide heterotrophic plastids with substrates further used to produce
  reducing equivalents and storage compounds. In maize, the substrate for starch synthesis,
  ADP-glucose, is produced in the cytoplasm and shuttled to the seeds by the brittle-1
  transporter. Abbreviations: ADP-Glc, ADP-glucose; BT1, Brittle-1 ADP-glucose carrier;
  Glc 1-P, glucose 1-phosphate; Glc 6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; GPT, glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate
  translocator; Mal, maltose; NTT, nucleoside triphosphate transporter; OPPP, oxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway; 3-PGA, 3-phosphoglyceric acid; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  Pi, inorganic phosphate; PPi, pyrophosphate; PPT, PEP/phosphate translocator; XPT,
  xylulose 5-phosphate/phosphate translocator; Xul 5-P, xylulose 5-phosphate.'
