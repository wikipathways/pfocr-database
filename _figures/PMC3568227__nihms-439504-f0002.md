caption: Role of mesothelin in cancer progressionOverexpression of mesothelin leads
  to higher IL-6 production by constitutively activating NF-κB. High IL-6 can trigger
  the transcription protein 3 (Stat3), resulting in higher expression levels of the
  cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK2) complex, as well as speeding the G1-S transition.
  In addition, activation of NF-κB and Stat3 may induce expression of Bcl-xl and Bcl-2
  and inhibit apoptosis signaling. Mesothelin can protect cancer cells from drug-induced
  apoptosis by stimulating Akt phosphorylation under PI3K activation or the MAPK/ERK
  signaling pathway to promote the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2
  and Mcl-1 or inhibit the expression of pro-apoptotic factors such as Bad and Bax.
