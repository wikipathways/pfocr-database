caption: 'The biosynthetic pathway of type 1 (Lc) and type 2 (nLc) HBGAs. The pathway
  starts with a disaccharide precursor of type1 or type 2 carbohydrate chains. Type
  1 disaccharide precursors are β1-3, and type 2 are β1-4 linked. FUT1 specifically
  generates type 2 H antigens, while FUT2 preferentially produces the type 1 H antigens,
  although it also has activity on the type 2 chain []. Further modification of the
  H type1/2 by A or B enzymes synthesizes the respective tetrasaccharides, adding
  the A and B antigens. FUT3 generates the trisaccharides Lewis A (LeA) or Lewis X
  (LeX) in non-secretors, as well as LeB and LeY in secretors, by attaching α1-4 fucose
  on type 1 chains or α1-3 fucose on type 2 chains. Abbreviations: Glu: glucose, Gal:
  galactose, GluNAc: N-acetylglucosamine, GalNAc: N-acetylgalactosamine, Cer: ceramide,
  R: residue'
