caption: 'MSCs reduce a central profibrotic factor, TGF-β1, using STC1 in bleomycin-induced
  pulmonary fibrosis. The model of our study quoted in Ref.  is shown in this figure.
  Oxidative stress induces ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) in AECs and
  AMs. Continuous UPR causes continuous secretion of TGF-β1 from AECs and AMs. On
  the other hand, TGF-β1 stimulates MSCs to secrete STC1 through PI3/AKT/mTOR pathway.
  STC1 increases UCP2 and UCP2 induces a reduction of ER stress through the reduction
  of ROS in AECs and AMs. Finally, STC1 derived from MSCs reduces the secretion of
  TGF-β1 from AECs and AMs.Abbreviation: BLM, Bleomycin.'
