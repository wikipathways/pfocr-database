caption: EBF3 regulates the expression of diverse genes involved in cell growth and
  proliferation. Specifically, ectopic expression of EBF3 activates the expression
  of p21 and p27 at early time points, which induce cell cycle arrest. At late time
  points following EBF3 expression, caspase-3 activation, PARP-1 (poly [ADP-ribose]
  polymerase 1) cleavage and apoptosis of tumor cells occur. Note that both p21 and
  p27 are downregulated at late time points. However, whether EBF3 directly mediates
  the repression of p21 and p27 gene is unclear. Nonetheless, enforced EBF3 expression
  also leads to marked downregulation of cyclins and CDKs as well as proteins involved
  in cell survival such as Daxx and Mcl-1 at earlier time points. Thus, EBF3 might
  directly repress these genes.
