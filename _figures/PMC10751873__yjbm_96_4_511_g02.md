caption: 'The high expression level of CRNDE contributes to CRC by upregulating the
  signaling pathways such as Ras/MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin. In addition, CRNDE is able to
  competitively bind to its miRNA targets: miR-217, miR-181a-5p, miR-136, and miR-126-5p
  to inhibit their regulatory activities. Meanwhile, CRNDE can bind to EZH2 to suppress
  the expression of DUSP5 and CDKN1A. Lastly, the accumulated cytoplasmic hnRNPUL2
  can increase the stability of CRNDE. Created with BioRender.com'
