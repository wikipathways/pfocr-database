caption: A plausible model for the EIN2–EIN3–NAC TFs regulatory cascade in the control
  of leaf senescence. EIN2-mediated senescence signalling, triggered by various senescence-inducing
  factors including age, hormones, and environmental stresses, activates EIN3. EIN3
  directly induces the expression of two key positive regulators of leaf senescence,
  ORE1 and AtNAP. Simultaneously, EIN3 directly suppresses the expression of miR164
  (), which negatively regulates ORE1 at the post-transcriptional level. ORE1 and
  AtNAP activate the expression of common as well as distinct downstream NAC TF genes.
  In addition, EIN2-mediated senescence signal is transduced to four NAC TFs (ANAC019,
  ANAC047, ANAC055, and ORS1) via an EIN3-independent pathway.
