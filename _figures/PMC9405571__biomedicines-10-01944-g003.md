caption: 'Autophagy dysregulation in lung disease progression. Representation of the
  main molecular mechanism underlying the role of autophagy pathway dysregulation,
  which is associated with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), Malignant Mesothelioma (MM), and
  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD. On the left (green rectangle), the impairment
  of different autophagy pathways contributes to the exacerbation of pulmonary inflammation
  in CF (top) and COPD (bottom). Deficit in these degradation pathways lead to the
  accumulation of degradation products, which ultimately leads pathogenesis progression.
  On the right (violet rectangle), the enhancement of different autophagy pathways
  linked to COPD (bottom) and MM (top) are also illustrated inside the zoom circles.
  Although COPD progression has been associated with impaired autophagy, enhanced
  autophagy pathways have also been associated with the worsening of the disease.
  Increased autophagy in MM has been associated with neoplastic transformation and
  chemoresistance. The main cause of each disease is also reported: mutation in CFTR
  for CF, asbestos fibers for MM, and cigarette smoke for COPD. All the altered autophagy
  mechanisms underlying the above-mentioned lung diseases are extensively described
  in the main text. Created with BioRender.com.'
