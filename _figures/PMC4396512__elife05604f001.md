caption: 'Arrows represent the steps involved in aliphatic glucosinolate (GSL) biosynthesis
  that have been validated through laboratory experiments and are naturally variable
  within A. thaliana. Gene names are listed next to or above the arrows. (A) Regulation
  of aliphatic GSL biosynthesis. The transcription factors MYB28 and MYB29 control
  accumulation of aliphatic GLS. A double knockout in these genes results in no aliphatic
  GLS accumulation, while a single knockout in these genes leads to a 50% reduction
  in aliphatic GSL (myb28) or a 25% reduction in aliphatic GSL (myb29), compared to
  WT Col-0. The biosynthetic enzymes MAM1 and AOP2 also influence aliphatic GLS accumulation
  and a non-functional allele at either locus leads to decreased GSL accumulation.
  (B) Amino acid chain elongation. During chain elongation, carbons are added to a
  methionine precursor through a series of reactions producing an elongated amino
  acid. Variation at the Elong locus controls the number of carbons added to the amino
  acid precursor and therefore, the length of the GSL side chain, R. A functional
  allele at this locus, MAM1, leads primarily to accumulation of GSL with four carbon
  (4C) length side chains, whereas a non-functional allele, gsm1 leads to accumulation
  of GSL with three carbon (3C) length side chains. The elongated amino acid is subsequently
  converted into a GLS via the core pathway (not shown). (C) Side chain modification.
  The GSL compounds produced can then undergo a series of side chain modifications
  that lead to the suite of diverse GSL compounds found in Arabidopsis. Side chain
  modification is controlled by variation of GSOX1, GSOX3, AOP2, AOP3 and GSOH. GSOX1
  & GSOX3 oxygenate a methylthio (MT) to methylsulfinyl (MSO) GSL. AOP2 converts MSO
  to alkenyl, such as allyl and but-3-enyl. AOP3, on the other hand converts only
  3C length MSO to OH-propyl GSL and cannot act on the 4MSO GSL. GSOH oxygenates the
  4C but-3-enyl to the OH-alkenyl GSL, OH-but-3-enyl. Since GSOH acts on but-3-enyl
  GSL, which is a product of AOP2, a functional AOP2 is necessary for GSOH to function
  and AOP2 is said to be epistatic to GSOH. Col-0 is functional for MAM1 and the GSOX''s,
  null for both AOP2 and AOP3, and functional for GSOH, resulting in accumulation
  of primarily 4MSO GLS. See  for images of GSL traces for each GSL genotypes in our
  mutant laboratory population. (D) GSL Activation. Once produced, GLS are stored
  in the vacuole in their stable, unreactive form until activation occurs. Upon cellular
  disruption, such as occurs during pathogen attack, insect herbivory or even wind
  damage, GLS come into contact with their own plant-made activating enzyme, myrosinase.
  After production, myrosinase is stored in vacuoles of idioblastic cells called myrosin
  bodies. Myrosinase activates the GSL compound by cleaving the glucose moiety, yielding
  an unstable aglycone structure that non-enzymatically rearranges to either nitriles
  or isothiocyanates, depending on the presence of the co-activators ESM1 and ESP.DOI:
