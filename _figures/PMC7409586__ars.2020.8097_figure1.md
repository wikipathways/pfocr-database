caption: Pathway of selenocysteine synthesis and its incorporation into selenoproteins.
  Sec is synthesized on its own tRNA (tRNA[Ser]Sec), which undergoes maturation through
  sequential modifications, with initial attachment of serine by SARS resulting in
  Ser-tRNA[Ser]Sec. Subsequent phosphorylation of this serine residue by PSTK generates
  O-Phosphoseryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec. Finally, SEPSECS catalyzes the acceptance of a selenophosphate,
  generated from selenide and ATP by SEPHS2, resulting in Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec. An intermediate
  complex that includes Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec, TRNAU1AP, and EEFSEC is subsequently formed.
  This complex is guided by an interaction with SECISBP2 to the SECIS-element of selenoprotein
  mRNA, ready for incorporation into the nascent polypeptide. Other factors (ribosomal
  protein L30, eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4a3, nucleolin, …) also have regulatory
  roles and influence the Sec insertion process. EEFSEC, Sec tRNA-specific eukaryotic
