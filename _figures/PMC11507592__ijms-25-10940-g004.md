caption: A schematic representation of the Ca2+ signaling pathway induced by salt
  stress. The Na+ receptor, GIPC, located on the plasma membrane, activates the Ca2+
  channel CNGC. This leads to the generation of Ca2+ signals within the cell and subsequently
  triggers a series of signaling pathways. Ca2+ in the cytoplasm are recognized by
  SOS3/SCaBP8, which recruits SOS2 to the plasma membrane to phosphorylate SOS1, facilitating
  the efflux of Na+. Additionally, the CBL-CIPK module plays a crucial role in the
  SOS pathway. SOS3 interacts with SOS2 upon sensing Ca2+, forming the SOS2/SOS3 complex
  to phosphorylate SOS1 and promote Na+ efflux. The activity of SOS2 is negatively
  regulated by 14-3-3 proteins; however, this inhibitory effect is alleviated by Ca2+-mediated
  binding of PKS5 to the 14-3-3 proteins. TPC1, located on the vacuolar membrane,
  helps maintain the appropriate balance of Na+/Ca2+, thereby promoting the proton
  gradient. Ca2+ binding to CPK3 can phosphorylate TPK1 on the vacuolar membrane,
  ensuring the stable Na+/K+ in the cytoplasm. Collectively, these ion transporters
  contribute to the plant tolerance to salt stress. GIPC, glycosyl inositol phosphoryl
  ceramides; CNGC, cyclic nucleotide gated Ca2+ channel; SOS, salt overly sensitive;
  SCaBP8, SOS3/SOS3-like calcium-binding protein 8; CBL, calcineurin B-like protein;
  CIPK, CBL-interacting protein kinase; PKS5, SOS2-like protein kinase 5; TPC1, two-pore
  channel 1; CPK3, calcium-dependent protein kinase 3; TPK1, two-pore K+ channel 1
