caption: Schematic diagram of the regulatory mechanism of circGARS in the pathogenesis
  of SLE. CircGARS directly combined with miR-19a regulate the expression of A20 to
  influence the immune responses regulated by the NF-κB pathway as a negative feedback
  mechanism. Moreover, circGARS enhanced the transcriptional level by directly binding
  to m6A modification proteins. In addition, miR-19a regulated A20 degradation by
  downregulating YTHDF2
