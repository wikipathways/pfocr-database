caption: Persistent inflammation at the tumour site drives increase in COX-2 expression
  leading to accumulation of PGE2. This in turn leads to the increase in expression
  of miR-21 and subsequent downregulation of PDCD4 protein levels facilitating progressive
  increase to more invasive and metastatic forms of colorectal cancer (from Dukes'
  A to B, C and D). Our experiments indicate that this pathway can be blocked by COX-2
  inhibitors (NS398 and Aspirin) by preventing accumulation of PGE2 as well as by
  miR-21 inhibitors. ↑ Activation,  Inhibition. See text for further details.
