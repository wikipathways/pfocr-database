caption: In Hh-dependent cancers such as BCC and medulloblastoma, the cilium may modulate
  the activity of signaling pathways in addition to Hh. For instance, localization
  of PDGF receptor-αα to the cilium is important for transducing downstream signals
  mediated by Akt and MAP kinases. The cilium may also normally restrain Wnt pathway
  activity by preventing the accumulation of β-catenin. The balance of the downstream
  effects of these pathways likely governs cellular decisions for proliferation and
  apoptosis.
