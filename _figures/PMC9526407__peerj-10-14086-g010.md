caption: The ischemia-reperfusion injury induced the secretion of IL-22 by Th cell
  and NK cell. The action of IL-22 was mediated by binding to the heterodimeric receptors
  of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2, which could phosphorylate the JAK2/STAT3 signaling. Subsequently,
  p-STAT3 molecule appeared to be dimerized, translocated into the nucleus, and bound
  to specific DNA sequence to induce the transcription of many gens that regulating
  apoptosis and proliferation. Ac2-26 could reduce ischemia-reperfusion induced hepatocytes
  damage via inhibiting the secretion of IL-22 and inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling
  pathway.
