caption: '(a) The canonical function of CD4+ T cells is the provision of help for
  B cells in germinal center formation, isotype switching, and affinity maturation
  of antibody responses. Follicular helper (TFH) cells are a specialized subset of
  CD4+ T cells that provide help to B cells through both cell-cell interactions, most
  notably CD40L: CD40, and through the release of cytokines. The generation of neutralizing
  antibody is a critical component of protection against many viral pathogens and
  the goal of most vaccine strategies. (b) The best characterized pathway for CD4+
  T cell help in the generation of CD8+ T cell effectors is through the activation
  (licensing) of APC via CD40L: CD40 interactions, and the provision of IL-2. A role
  for CD4+ T cell help in the initial generation of antiviral CD8+ T cell effector
  responses is often not clear, presumably because viruses can trigger PRRs and independently
  activate APC. However, a clear role for CD4+ T cell help in the generation of function
  of memory CD8+ T cells has been demonstrated upon infection with viruses. Down-regulation
  of TRAIL on CD8+ T cells is a prominent feature of ‘helped’ CD8+ T cells and at
  least in part facilitates their robust recall response during secondary infection.'
