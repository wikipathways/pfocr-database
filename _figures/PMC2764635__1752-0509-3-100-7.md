caption: 'Experimental results of Rap1 pathway knockout from Falco et al. (2007) []:
  On the left, is a schematic of the mutated RET/PTC1 pathway as presented in [].
  On the right, is a table containing a summary of the results from the Gab1 knock
  down experiment using si-RNA in two different human PTC cell lines (BHP 10-3 and
  BHP 2-7) from [] (please refer to Figure 5c in [] for original blots); pMEK and
  pERK represent the activated phosphorylated forms of MEK and ERK, respectively,
  whilst Rap1GTP represents the activated GTP loaded form of Rap1.'
