caption: The propagation of pressure in the epidermis and certain mechanotransducers
  involving the modulation of mechanical stimuli in keratinocytes. The upward maturation
  of keratinocytes within the epidermis contributes to the mechanical resistance of
  skin. Among all membranous channels and receptors, CaSR, TRP (TRPV4 as representative),
  and PIEZO channels are major categories in charge of mechanotransduction. Yoda1
  can act as an agonist of PIEZO1 channel and generates calcium influx in association
  with other signaling pathways, eliciting further neurochemical responses that expedite
  signal modulation. The release of ATP from keratinocytes also interacts with P2X4
  receptors of sensory neurons to mediate cellular mechanosensitivity toward physical
  stimulation. ATP—adenosine triphosphate; Ca2+—calcium ion; CaSR—calcium-sensing
  receptor; TRPV4—transient receptor potential channel subfamily V member 4.
