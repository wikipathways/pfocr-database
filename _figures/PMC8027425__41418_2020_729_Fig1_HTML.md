caption: a Glucose is converted to pyruvate via glycolysis. Pyruvate can be transported
  to the mitochondria through the MPC or reduced to lactate in the cytosol by lactate
  dehydrogenase (LDH). Inside the mitochondria, pyruvate can either be oxidised to
  acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) or carboxylated to oxaloacetate by
  pyruvate carboxylase (PC). Acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate can enter the TCA cycle and
  generate the reducing equivalents NADH and FADH2 used by the electron transport
  chain (ETC) to generate ATP. b Decreased MPC expression alone is sufficient to cause
  metabolic cardiac remodelling, hypertrophic growth and ultimately heart failure.
  Mice genetically engineered to have decreased cardiomyocyte MPC1/2 divert glucose
  into the pentose phosphate pathway that generates five carbon sugars such as ribose
  5-phosphate, a precursor for nucleotide synthesis and NADPH, which are necessary
  for anabolic metabolism and the growth of the myocardium. Shunting of fructose-6P
  from glycolysis towards the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway generates uridine diphosphate
  N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-N-GlcNAc) used by glycosyltransferases to transfer N-acetylglucosamine
  residues to proteins, termed O-GlcNAcylation. Other post-translational modifications
  are also likely to occur in cells as a result of changes in MPC abundance or activity
  due to the alterations in the TCA cycle or glycolysis caused by rerouting of pyruvate.
  ATP levels are maintained in heart with decreased MPC, perhaps because acetyl-CoA
  derived from ketone bodies is supplied to the TCA cycle, preserving the generation
  of reducing equivalents necessary for mitochondrial respiration.
