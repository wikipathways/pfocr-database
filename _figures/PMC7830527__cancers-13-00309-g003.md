caption: 'Proposed CD38-dependent mechanisms of hyperprogression. The upregulation
  and activation of CD38 after IC blockade therapy, together with the action of enzymes
  that catabolize ATP and ADP (not shown), lead to the release of adenosine into the
  tumor microenvironment. The activation of ADORA2a receptors on tumor cells by adenosine
  leads to the blockade of the IFN-γ pathway, making the tumor cell resistant to cytotoxic
  IFN-γ action, as well as the activation of oncogenic pathways, such as the JNK signaling
  pathway, which leads to the downregulation of p53. The action of adenosine also
  increases Treg cells and the polarization of M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment.
  CD38 also promotes the activation of AICD after the hyperactivation of tumor-specific
  CD8+ T cells by ICI therapy, and induces the expression of FasL on T cells. CD38
  also induces the release of Angiopoietin-2 from endothelial cells, leading to increased
  angiogenesis, PD-L1 expression on M2-like macrophages and enhanced tumor invasion.
  Finally, CD38 induces the expression of HIF-1α in tumor cells, which can, in turn,
  induce the production of VEGF and IGF factors. VEGF can establish paracrine signaling,
  promoting the recruitment of Treg cells, and autocrine signaling on tumor cells
  by binding VEGFR2, promoting tumorigenesis and invasion. The polymorphisms rs1870377
  A/T and A/A may make this binding stronger. HIF-1α can also induce the expression
  of IGF-pathway components, leading to autocrine signaling that results in tumor
  growth and survival. ANGPT2: Angiopoietin 2; IGF: insulin-like growth factor; IGF-1R:
  IGF-1 receptor; VEGFR2*P: VEGFR2 receptor with rs1870377 A/T or A/A polymorphisms.'
