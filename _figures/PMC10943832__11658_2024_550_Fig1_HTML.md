caption: Metabolic pathway of tyrosine into p-cresyl sulfate (PCS). l-tyrosine can
  be reversibly converted to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate by tyrosine transaminase, aromatic-amino-acid
  transaminase or phenylalanine dehydrogenase. 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate is the precursor
  of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, which is catalyzed by p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate oxidase,
  and can subsequently be decarboxylated to p-cresol by p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase.
  The majority of p-cresol is sulfated into the PCS by aryl sulfotransferases, and
  a small fraction is metabolized to p-cresyl glucuronide by UDP-glucuronyltransferases.
  The processes marked by the yellow box occur in the gut microbiota, and the processes
  marked by the blue box occur in the gut mucosa and liver of the host
