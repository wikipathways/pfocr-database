caption: A) Rsp5 is recruited to Mup1 in response to high levels of methionine through
  interaction with the Art1 adaptor protein. This association with Rsp5 results in
  the ubiquitination of Art1.B) Mup1 is also internalized in response to nutrient
  stress, where Rsp5 can be recruited to Mup1 via Sna3, which can act as a complementary
  adaptor protein. There is partial redundancy between Art1 and Sna3, each of which
  contributes to MVB sorting. Sna3 can also be ubiquitinated by Rsp5.C) A lysineless
  version of Sna3 (cytosolic lysine to arginine mutations), which can still associate
  with both Rsp5 and Mup1, fosters ubiquitination of Mup1 and uses Mup1~Ub to enter
  the MVB pathway.
