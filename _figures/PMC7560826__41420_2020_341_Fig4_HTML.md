caption: A PRODH has been implicated in the activation of apoptosis via both the intrinsic
  and extrinsic pathways. Activation of the intrinsic pathway by reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) is mediated by the p53-induced transcriptional activation of genes, including
  PRODH1. In the intrinsic pathway, the BH3-only proteins, such as NOXA and PUMA,
  inactivate the pro-survival proteins such as BCL-2 and lead to the release of pro-apoptotic
  proteins such as BAX. This allows the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer
  membrane. Cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria and stimulates assembly
  of the apoptosome containing APAF-1 and pro-caspase 9. The apoptosome leads to the
  activation of caspase 9, which, in turn, activates the effector caspase 3 resulting
  in apoptosis. The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is initiated by the activation
  of the death receptor of the TNF superfamily, such FAS and TRAIL. Receptor engagement
  and trimerization lead to the recruitment and activation of caspase-8 in the death
  inducing signaling complex (DISC), which in turn activates the effector caspase
  3, resulting in apoptosis. PRODH1 has been shown to induce expression of the death
  receptor 5 (DR5) and its ligand TRAIL through stimulation of the nuclear factor
  of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor. B Schematic representation of
  the proposed proline cycle. L-proline is oxidized to P5C by PRODH1 in the mitochondria.
  P5C is then reduced back to L-proline through the action of the PYCR3 enzyme in
  the cytosol, a reaction coupled with the oxidation of NADPH. The cycle shuttles
  electrons from the cytosol to the mitochondria and stimulates flux through the PPP
  via oxidation of NADPH. In this way, the proline cycle can potentially contribute
  to nucleotide biosynthesis.
