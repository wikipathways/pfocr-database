caption: Pro-apoptotic TRAIL signaling pathway. The TRAIL signaling pathway triggers
  apoptosis by binding to its receptors, forming the DISC. In type I cells, DISC formation
  activates caspase 8, initiating a complete caspase cascade, and inducing apoptosis.
  In type II cells, caspase 8 activation alone is insufficient due to inhibition by
  XIAP. To overcome this, caspase 8 cleaves BID, which activates BAX and BAK in the
  mitochondria, causing MOMP. MOMP releases SMAC, which relieves the inhibition of
  caspases by XIAP, allowing full caspase activation. Additionally, released cytochrome
  c forms an apoptosome with APAF1, activating caspase 9. This cascade enhances caspase
  3 activation, leading to apoptosis. APAF1 = apoptotic protease activating factor
  1, BID = BH3-interacting domain death agonist, DISC = death-inducing signaling complex,
  MOMP = mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, SMAC = second mitochondria-derived
  activator of caspases, tBID = truncated state of BID, TRAF = TNF receptor-associated
  factor, TRAIL = tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, XIAP =
  X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein
