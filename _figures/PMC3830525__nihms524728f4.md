caption: (A). Tyrosine kinase receptor ligands such as epidermal growth factor (EGF)
  and stem cell factor (SCF) through their interaction with their receptors (e.g.
  EGFR and c-Kit) activate small GTPases Rac and Ras in HSCs. Ras GTPase further activates
  Rac. Activated Ras and Rac, through MAPK pathway activation, induce the transcription
  of transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5). EGF and SCF-mediated activation
  of receptor tyrosine kinase also induce KLF5 transcription through PI3K pathway
  activation. Activated PI3K also stimulates Rac activation. The Wnt ligand through
  its receptor Frizzled (Fz8) activates Cdc42. Cdc42 activates Rac and consequently
  leads to the induction of Klf5 transcription. Klf5 protein is post-translationally
  regulated through modifications such as phosphorylation, sumoylation, acetylation,
  and ubiquitination. (B). The transcription factor Klf5 regulates the expression
  of early endosome protein Rab5a and Rab5b, and as well, the expression of Rac. Rab
  5, at the early endocytic compartment, regulates the endocytosis and recycling of
  active β1 and β2 integrin, which in turn regulate the adhesion and homing of HSC
  to the bone marrow.
