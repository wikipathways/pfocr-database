caption: Metabolic pathway of Aβ and GPCRs in Alzheimer's disease. The crystal structure
  of each protein is shown in a secondary structure cartoon representation, whereas
  each ligand is showed in a ball-and-stick model. The APP related proteins are painted
  in blue. The receptors are painted in green while the ion channel receptor (NMDAR)
  is painted in orange and green. The enzymes are painted in orange while the activator
  of an enzyme (p35) is painted in yellow. And other proteins are painted in purple.
  The GPCRs are marked with red descriptive texts. Black arrows represent direct molecular
  interaction while blue arrows with a minus sign represent the inhibiting effect.
  Green arrows with a plus sign represent the agonist stimulation of the GPCRs activating
  the related enzymes.
