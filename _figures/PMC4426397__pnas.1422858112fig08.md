caption: Model. (A) Model for the regulation of developmental timing by P. aeruginosa
  and the p38 MAPK pathway in C. elegans. (B) Model for the roles of heterochronic
  genes in pathogen resistance on P. aeruginosa. *Predicated targets of let-7-Fam
  miRNAs in the p38 MAPK pathway. X represents other possible pathways that are regulated
  by let-7 to promote pathogen resistance on P. aeruginosa. The dotted line indicates
  proposed regulatory interactions not yet tested experimentally.
