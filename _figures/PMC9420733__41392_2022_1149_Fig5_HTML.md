caption: GLP-1 signaling pathway in obesity pathogenesis. The anti-obesity effect
  of GLP-1 can be mediated by either peripheral or central signals. In the periphery,
  the activation of GLP-R by gut-derived GLP-1 enhances the glucose-stimulated insulin
  secretion, through PKA-dependent or Epac2 pathway. By enhanced PKA activity, GLP-1
  alleviates insulin resistance and leads to weight loss in obese diabetic mice by
  reducing ER stress and improving β-cell function. It also improves insulin sensitivity
  in peripheral tissue by suppressing AMPK-related pathway and elevating glyoxalase.
  By interacting with multiple signaling pathways including PI3K, MAPK, and Wnt4-β-catenin
  pathways, GLP-1 promotes pre-adipocyte differentiation by up-regulating PPARγ and
  FABP4, but suppresses lipogenesis in mature adipocytes by decreasing fatty acid
  synthase expression. GLP-1 also enhances lipolysis in WAT by increasing the expression
  and activity of Sirt1, through yet unknown mechanisms. Additionally, GLP-1 participates
  in the regulation of thermogenesis by inhibiting BMP4-related signaling pathway
  and thus induces the expression of thermogenic genes like UCP1. Gut-derived GLP-1
  also interacts with GLP-R expressed in vagus, through which the information is transmitted
  upward to the CNS, which in turns suppresses vagal activity and gastric emptying,
  so as to increase satiety and reduce food intake. Besides, peripheral GLP-1 plays
  a role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and BAT-related thermogenesis in
  a CNS-dependent manner. the latter is partially mediated by suppressing AMPK signaling
  pathway. Central GLP-1 produced by neurons in the caudal medulla is transmitted
  into the hypothalamus and functions to reduce food intake by activating POMC neurons
  while suppressing AgRP/NPY neurons in this area
