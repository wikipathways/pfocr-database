caption: Proposed mechanism of LPA signaling in osteoclasts. LPA is released by neighboring
  osteoblasts and binds to LPA receptors on an osteoclast. Binding of LPA to LPA1
  activates Gi/o to induce elevation of cytosolic-free calcium, activation of NFAT,
  and enhancement of survival. Binding of LPA to a distinct LPA receptor (LPAR), likely
  coupled to G12/13, causes retraction, which is maintained through the Rho/Rho-associated
  kinase (ROCK) pathway.
