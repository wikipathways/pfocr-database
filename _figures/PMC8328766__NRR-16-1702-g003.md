caption: Intracellular signaling pathways for astrocytic transformation (A1/A2) and
  roles in neurodegenerative disease.Dysfunctional cells (reactive microglia and neurons)
  secrete molecules recognized by specific receptors in the astrocytic cytomembrane.
  These extracellular signals activate intracellular signaling pathways including
  NF-κB, MAPK, S1PR, JAK/STAT3, and PI3K/AKT. (1) The NF-κB pathway is triggered by
  inflammatory mediators. Receptor-bound protein kinases activate the IKK complex,
  resulting in phosphorylation of IκBα, the stable inhibitor of NF-κB. p50 and p65,
  two subunits of NF-κB, translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of
  A1-related genes. DN-IκBα inhibits p50 and p65. (2) The MAPK pathway is partly initiated
  by cytokines and growth factors, which initiate a cascade amplification of phosphorylation.
  After triggering, JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 upregulate gene transcription of A1 astrocytes
  by initiating a large number of transcription factors (TF). (3) The S1PR pathway
  is activated by extracellular sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1PR binds to heterotrimeric
  G-proteins (GPs), such as Gi, Gq and G12/13, which in turn affect downstream proteins
  such as phospholipase adenylate cyclase (AC), Ras homolog (Rho), Ras-related C3
  botulinum toxin substrate (Rac), which translocate to the nucleus to activate expression
  of A1-related genes. (4) The JAK/STAT3 pathway is triggered by cytokines. Upon cytokine
  coupling, JAK kinase is initiated and STAT3 is gathered to gp130 (intracellular
  receptor). Consequently, STAT3 is phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus,
  whereby it upregulates gene transcription of A2-related genes. STAT3 also promotes
  SOCS3 expression, which inhibits the JAK/STAT3 pathway. (5) The PI3K/AKT pathway
  is activated by binding of insulin to insulin receptor (IR), which activates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase (PI3K). AKT is activated upon its interaction with phosphoinositide dependent
  protein kinase 1 (PDK1), which is indirectly phosphorylated by PI3K. Subsequently,
  AKT modulates transcription factors, such as glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3β),
  forkhead box (FOX), and mechanistic target for rapamycin (mTOR), which are associated
  with several functions of A2 astrocytes.
