caption: Hypothetical cellular model of UV-induced 3-DOA biosynthesis in pericarp
  of black sorghum. High-fluence UV exposure results in the generation of ROS that
  is proposed to play a key role in mediating downstream biological processes. The
  downstream processes are proposed to include kinase cascades and transcriptional
  activation of genes including TFs along with plant defense response genes such as
  resistance proteins, antioxidant systems, and conserved nucleotide-binding site–leucine-rich
  repeat proteins. Associated with these events is the transcriptional activation
  of structural genes in the biosynthetic pathway of 3-DOAs along with cellular transporters,
  which leads to accumulation of elevated levels of 3-DOAs in specific subcellular
  locations. Unlike anthocyanins that are localized in the vacuole, 3-DOAs are trafficked
  to the cell wall where they are proposed to serve as a protective sunshade against
  UV light
