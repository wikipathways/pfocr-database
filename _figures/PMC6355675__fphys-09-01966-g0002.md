caption: Non-local and local regulation in the context of a metabolic pathway. Depicted
  is the overall logical structure of a metabolic pathway module that converts food
  into energy and proteins, with binding of various factors serving as ON/OFF switches.
  This enables the top-down effect of the physiological environment. Transcription
  factors are TF's, enzyme pools are E's, metabolic pools are X's. From Goelzer et
  al. () (open access).
