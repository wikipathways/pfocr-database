caption: Contribution of AT-rich interactive domain 5A (Arid5a) in interleukin (IL)
  6 production and disease. (A) The innate immune response is generated by pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns, which are recognized by pathogen recognition receptors and lead
  to expression of proinflammatory mediators. For example, toll-like receptor 4 recognizes
  lipopolysaccharide and activates the IKK/NFκB signaling pathway. In the early phase
  of TLR4 signaling, the IKK complex phosphorylates Regnase-1 and also promotes transcription
  of Il6 and Arid5a. Regnase-1 binds to the Il6 mRNA and degrades it. In the late
  phase of LPS stimulation, internalization of TLR4 or TLR4 endocytosis under TRIF
  signaling augments noncanonical phosphorylation of Stat1 which further induces the
  expression of Arid5a. In the nucleus, Arid5a binds to genes encoding transcription
  factors, such as Pparγ2, to inhibit their expression. Furthermore, Arid5a is shuttled
  to the cytoplasm under inflammatory conditions where it interferes with the destabilizing
  effect of Regnase-1. Arid5a is involved in Il6 mRNA stabilization, and the resulting
  increase in IL6 production is associated with inflammation and autoimmune diseases.
  (B) Arid5a and Pparγ2 in adipogenic homeostasis. C/ebp activates Pparγ2, and both
  are involved in adipogenesis. Immune cells, such as macrophages and T cells, infiltrate
  adipose tissues and provide a framework to regulate energy homeostasis. In adipose
  tissue, these cells secrete cytokines, such as IL6 and IL17, which induce Arid5a.
  Arid5a further represses Pparγ2 transcription in fibroblasts, thereby inhibiting
  adipocyte development and inhibiting adipogenesis and obesity. “Reprinted from Frontiers
