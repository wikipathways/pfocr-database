caption: Regulatory network orchestrated by SOX21-AS1 in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
  SOX21-AS1 decreases the levels of miR-107 and miR-132 after sponging with them and
  influences the inactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and Wnt signaling pathway, affecting
  neuronal viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. The potential therapeutic significance
  of silencing SOX21-AS1 is highlighted as a strategy for mitigating neurodegenerative
  damage in Alzheimer's disease.
