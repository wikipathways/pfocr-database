caption: The phenolic compound biosynthesis pathway. A schematic representation of
  the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathway is shown. Major families
  of flavonoid compounds are highlighted. Flavonoids are characterized by the presence
  of the flavan nucleus with A, B, and C rings as indicated (inset). Final products
  of the flavonoid pathway such as pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside, are often glycosylated
  at the position 3 of the C ring of the flavan nucleus. Suppression of Fra a protein
  expression affects the expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and chalcone
  synthase (CHS) genes (red inverted triangles) and alters phenolic compound accumulation
  with an increase in the levels of catechin and a decreased accumulation of anthocyanins
  (as indicated by arrows) ().
