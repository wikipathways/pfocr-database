caption: Schematic representation of hyperglycemia-induced lung diseases. Hyperglycemia
  promotes airway hyperresponsiveness via the Rho-associated protein kinase (Rock)
  pathway. Hyperglycemia accelerates lung fibrosis through the activation of signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), connective tissue growth factor
  (CTGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ). Hyperglycemia increases cancer
  cell growth, chronic inflammation, inflammatory cytokine release and oxidative stress
  through activation of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B-cells (NFκB) pathway and NADPH oxidase (NOX) as well as the production of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Higher glucose concentrations
  in airway surface liquid (ASL) and lung immune cell dysfunction due to hyperglycemia
  promote a susceptibility to pulmonary infections
