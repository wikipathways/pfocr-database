caption: Blockade of Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate 3-kinase B (ITPKB) as a novel treatment
  for Graft-versus-Host Disease. TCR stimulation activates downstream PLCγ, thereby
  increasing intracellular IP3 levels. Binding of IP3 to IP3R activates the release
  of Ca2+ from intracellular storage compartments. Furthermore, STIM stimulate the
  influx of extracellular Ca2+ to activate NFAT signaling and gene transcription.
  ITPKB is a rate-limiting step as it catalyzes the formation of IP4 from IP3. IP4
  acts as a control mechanism for calcium signaling by blocking the respective channels
  in the extracellular membrane. Genetic deletion or inhibition of ITPKB disturbs
  this control mechanism and leads to increased calcium influx, which stimulates pro-apoptotic
  signaling pathways, leading to activation-induced cell death. Since ITPKB is predominantly
  found in hematopoietic cells, this kinase is thought to be a novel target molecule
  for the treatment of GvHD. Adapted from “NFAT Signaling Pathway”, by Biorender.com
