caption: Diagram of the Current StudyIn the AD brain, HDAC2 is upregulated and induces
  the deacetylation of the HNF-4A transcription factor, which leads to the inhibition
  of HNF-4A and the suppression of miR-101b expression. The loss of miR-101b induces
  AMPK overexpression and ultimately results in tauopathy. Data are presented as mean ±
  SEM.
