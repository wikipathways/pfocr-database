caption: Schematic diagram for lnc‐NONHSAT233728.1function in women with PCOS. We
  employed RNA sequencing analysis to identify differentially expressed protein‐coding
  genes and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles in granulosa cells from
  women with and without PCOS. It was established that the level of NONHSAT233728.1
  was diminished in women with PCOS. The present study demonstrated the role of NONHSAT233728.1
  in granulosa cells from patients with PCOS and further investigated the potential
  mechanism of NONHSAT233728.1 in the KGN cell line. Knockdown of lnc‐NONHSAT233728.1
  expression resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation, characterized
  by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We hypothesize that this accumulation
  activates the endogenous mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, resulting in granulosa
  cell apoptosis through the MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which contributes to follicular
  atresia
