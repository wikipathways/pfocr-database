caption: A Once a tumor grows to a certain size it requires an adequate supply of
  oxygen and nutrients from the vasculature. The hypoxic environment stimulates the
  release of pro-angiogenic factors that bind to receptors on endothelial cells, triggering
  the angiogenic switch. Pericyte detachment and basement membrane degradation facilitates
  endothelial tip cell migration towards the hypoxic source. Dll4 release from the
  tip cell binds to Notch1 on the adjacent cell to maintain the stalk cell phenotype.
  The imbalance of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic signaling contributes to the
  formation of tortuous and hyperpermeable tumor blood vessels that do not function
  properly and further exacerbate hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. B Angiogenic ECs
  primarily utilize glycolysis for ATP production, while quiescent ECs upregulate
  FAO and downregulate other metabolic pathways to reduce oxidative stress. Glutaminolysis
  provides TCA intermediates and nitrogen for nucleotide pools to promote EC growth
  and migration and serves as a substrate for glutamate and asparagine production.
  Serine can be synthesized from the glycolytic intermediate 3-PG or taken up by ECs
  to support protein and nucleotide synthesis and glutathione production. In tumor
  endothelial cells, the glycolytic activator PFKFB3 is upregulated to drive tumor
  angiogenesis. Tumor ECs also display increased PHGDH expression. Glutamine and glutamine-derived
  aspartate are also critical metabolites supporting tumor angiogenesis. *Denotes
  enzymes and pathways upregulated in tumor ECs compared to ECs in normal tissues.
