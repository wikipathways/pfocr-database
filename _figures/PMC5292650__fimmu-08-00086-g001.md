caption: Overview of human myeloid cells identified in the bone marrow, blood, and
  tissue of cancer patients. Cancer-associated inflammation upregulates the production
  of myeloid cells from hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow. This figure
  illustrates the network of myeloid cells that have been identified in the blood
  and tumor tissue in human cancer. Cell surface markers expressed by the various
  myeloid cell types are listed portraying the huge degree of phenotypic similarity
  between the cell subsets. The thick curved black line depicts a pathway of cell
  differentiation that has been suggested but has not yet been proven.
