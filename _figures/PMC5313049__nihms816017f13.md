  panel: Hippo pathway components and retention of their homeologous gene pairs. All
  genes for Hippo pathway components as indicated were identified in the whole genome
  of X. laevis. Blue icons indicate that both of the homeologous genes are expressed
  in normal development and adult organs. The red icon, Taz, indicates a singleton.
  Yap is interchangeable with Taz in most cases, but TAZ, but not YAP, serves as a
  mediator of Wnt signaling (broken line). Pie charts show the numbers of homeolog
  pairs (blue) and singleton (red) in each category of Hippo pathway components classified
  according to subcellular localization. Lower panel: Comparative analysis of syntenies
  around the taz gene. X. tropicalis scaffold247 is not incorporated into the chromosome-scale
  assembly (v9) and hence its chromosomal location is not known yet. The p arm termini
  of XLA8L and XLA8S are on the left.'
