caption: Condensed diagram for the distant cholesterol biosynthesis pathway showing
  the CYP51 enzymatic step, which can occur either immediately after lanosterol synthesis
  in the Bloch arm of the pathway or following reduction of lanosterol at C24 by dihydrocholesterol
  reductase 24 (DHCR24) in the Kandutsch-Russell arm of the pathway.
