caption: 'Signaling pathways involved in the antihypertrophic effects of GHRH in vitro.
  Antihypertrophic actions of GHRH include GHRH-R–dependent activation of the AC/cAMP/PKA
  pathway (Left). GHRH inhibits PE-induced signaling by blocking the α1-AR/Gq pathway
  and its downstream effectors (Right). GHRH also counteracts the increase in Epac1
  by PE through activation of PKA and inhibition of Epac1-induced hypertrophic pathways
  (Center). Cross-talk mechanisms between β1-AR/Gαs/Epac1 and α1-AR/Gq signaling are
  shown. “+” and “−” indicate stimulatory and inhibitory effects, respectively; interrupted
  lines indicate indirect effects. Abbreviations: Cn, calcineurin; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  Epac1, exchange protein directly activated by cAMP; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3
  β; HDACs, class II histone deacetylases; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; MAPKs, mitogen-activated
  protein kinases; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; PLN(Ser16) phospholamban
  at serine 16; PLN(Thr17) phospholamban at threonine 17.'
