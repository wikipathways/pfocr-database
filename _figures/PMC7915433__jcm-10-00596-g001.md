caption: Metabolic scheme relating 2H-enrichment in positions 5 and 6 of circulating
  glucose, UDP-glucose (UDPG), glucuronide and hepatic glycogen with the utilization
  of fructose and glucose from the test meal. On conversion of fructose to dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G-3-P), hydrogen exchange mediated
  by triose phosphate isomerase incorporates 2H from 2H2O into position 5 of glucose
  and glycogen pathway products, represented in red. In addition, a small amount of
  fructose may be converted to pyruvate via glycolysis before being incorporated into
  glucose and glycogen via gluconeogenesis. This possibility also holds for dietary
  glucose. Passage of these and other gluconeogenic precursors, including lactate
  and alanine, will generate glucose and glycogen pathway products enriched in both
  positions 5 and 6S (represented in grey). Glucose from the meal that is directly
  absorbed will not be enriched in position 5 or 6 nor will these positions become
  enriched during subsequent conversion to UDPG, glucuronide and glycogen via the
  direct pathway (represented in blue). Formation of glucuronide from UDPG results
  in the loss of the position 6 hydrogens, hence this metabolite informs enrichment
  of position 5 from all gluconeogenic precursors including fructose (represented
  in brown). Some metabolic intermediates have been omitted for clarity.
