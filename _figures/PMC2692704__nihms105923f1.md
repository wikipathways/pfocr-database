caption: N-type and T-type calcium channels in the primary afferent signaling pathway.
  High voltage-activated N-type channels are highly localized to presynaptic terminals
  in laminae I and II of the dorsal horn. Action potentials carried along dorsal root
  ganglion cells (mainly C- and Aδ-afferents) trigger the opening of pre-synaptic
  N-type calcium channels which in turn initiate the release of nociceptive transmitters
  such as glutamate, substance P and CGRP onto spinal interneurons and projection
  neurons. Low voltage-activated T-type calcium channels are primarily localized more
  upstream in the pathway and are thought to be both involved in generating sensory
  potentials out near free nerve endings, as well as being present in DRG cell bodies
  where they likely contribute to the generation and frequency of action potentials.
