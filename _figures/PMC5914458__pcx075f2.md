caption: 'Possible MBW and WRKY transcriptional models for the regulation of the flavonoid
  pigment pathway. In (A), the MBW complex controls the expression of the LBGs and
  the WRKY gene (PH3 in Petunia, TTG2 in Arabidopsis). The WRKY protein then possibly
  enters the MBW complex, via physical interaction with the WDR protein (AN11 in Petunia
  and TTG1 in Arabidopsis), and narrows the range of LBG targets to the vacuole acidification
  and transport genes: PH1 and PH5 in Petunia, TT12 and TT13/AHA10 in Arabidopsis.
  In (B), the MBW complex regulates the LBGs and the WRKY gene but then the WRKY and
  WDR proteins physically interact possibly to form a separate transcriptional complex,
  without the MYB and bHLH proteins, that narrowly targets the vacuole acidification
  and transport genes. Ph: Petunia hybrida; At: Arabidopsis thaliana; LBGs: late biosynthetic
  genes of the flavonoid pigment pathway.'
