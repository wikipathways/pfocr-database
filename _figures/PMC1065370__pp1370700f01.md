caption: 'The isoprene biosynthetic pathway in plants. The isoprene biosynthetic pathway
  in plants consists of the MEP pathway (modified from ) and isoprene synthase. Shown
  are the intermediates of the pathway: G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DXP; MEP;
  CDP-ME, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol 2-phosphate; CDP-MEP; ME-cPP,
  2C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate; HMBPP, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl
  4-diphosphate; IPP; DMAPP. The enzymes in the pathway are indicated in bold: DXS;
  DXR; CMS, CDP-ME synthase; CMK, CDP-ME kinase; MCS, ME-cPP synthase; HDS, HMBPP
  synthase; IDS, IPP/DMAPP synthase; IspS, isoprene synthase.'
