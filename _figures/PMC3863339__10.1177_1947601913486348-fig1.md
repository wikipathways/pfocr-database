caption: 'RACK1 signaling complexes. RACK1 links PKC signaling to the MAP kinase pathway:
  RACK1 binding to activated PKC leads to the recruitment of JNK into the complex.
  PKC-mediated phosphorylation of JNK augments JNK activation by the canonical JNK
  pathway. JNK activates c-Jun, which in turn regulates the transcription of cyclin
  D1 and RACK1. RACK1 further stabilizes c-Jun by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation
  through Fbw7. By enhancing JNK–c-Jun activity, RACK1 is implicated in tumorigenesis.
  RACK1 regulates apoptosis via MAPK and Src: RACK1 binds to MAP3K and activates stress-induced
  MAPK signaling, which results in apoptosis. In contrast, sequestration of RACK1
  into stress granules attenuates MTK1 activation, which results in the inhibition
  of apoptosis. Binding of RACK1 to Src inhibits Src kinase activity. Upon apoptotic
  stimuli, inhibition of Src results in the oligomerization of Bax at the outer mitochondrial
  membrane, caspase activation, and cell death. RACK1 induces the oligomerization
  of Bax at the outer mitochondrial membrane, caspase activation, and cell death.
  RACK1 regulates Src activity during migration: Tight regulation of Src activity
  is necessary to mediate paxillin dynamics at focal adhesions during migration. Src
  phosphorylates paxillin, and RACK1 regulates paxillin phosphorylation dynamics by
  binding and releasing Src at its site of action, thereby enabling migration.'
