caption: Overview of the cGAS-STING pathway in age-related diseases. cGAS is a cytosolic
  DNA sensor that detects dsDNA from senescent cells and dead cells, and some extracellular
  dsDNA, mtDNA and DNA in the micronuclei are also the main sources of cytosolic DNA.
  After combining with DNA, cGAS interacts with GTP and ATP, inducing the synthesis
  of cGAMP. In addition to intracellular synthesis, extracellular cGAMP can also enter
  the cell and acts as a second messenger, binding to STING located in the ER. Activated
  STING then transfers to the Golgi via ERGIC, where it can truly function, interacting
  with TBK1, IRF3, and NF-κB and mediating the production of type I IFN, SASP and
  ISG, promoting the inflammatory response and exerting biological effects.
