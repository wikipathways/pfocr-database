caption: 'APE1/Ref-1 role in inflammatory bowel disease and the potential of redox
  signaling inhibition. The activation of transcription factors through the redox
  function of APE1 is implicated in the promotion of inflammation in inflammatory
  bowel disease. Furthermore, the subsequent activation of downstream mediators directly
  affects the inflammatory responses. By inhibiting the redox signaling pathway using
  APX compounds, the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines,
  reactive oxygen species (ROS), and neuronal damage can be reduced, leading to the
  alleviation of inflammation and gastrointestinal functions. Additionally, the repair
  function of APE1 plays a crucial role in mending the DNA or RNA lesions caused by
  inflammation and oxidative stress. In summary, the utilization of APX compounds
  can effectively diminish inflammatory markers, ROS levels, and enteric neuropathy,
  while also enhancing the DNA repair function, thereby presenting a novel therapeutic
  opportunity for IBD (created with BioRender.com (accessed on 30 September 2023)).
