caption: Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed both in the nucleus (VDRn) and on cellular
  membranes (VDRm) []. In humans, the VDR gene encoding is located on chromosome 12q
  []. VDR is widely distributed in many body tissues; this includes intestinal tissue,
  pancreatic beta cells, kidney tubular epithelial cells, bronchial epithelial cells,
  skin epithelial cells, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, certain endocrine glands, reproductive
  tissue, and immune cells [].Being a nuclear steroid, Vitamin D exerts its actions
  through genomic and non-genomic mechanisms. The genomic actions involve binding
  of activated VDR with retinoid X receptor (RXR), making a complex that then interacts
  with vitamin D response elements (VDREs) residing on DNA, which further engenders
  gene transcription and subsequently protein formation () [].The non-genomic action
  of vitamin D comprises actuation of signaling molecules and protein kinases, resulting
  in second messenger generation and opening of Ca+2 and Cl-channels, leading to cross-interaction
  with the genome and regulation of gene expression []. In its calcitriol form, Vitamin
  D is classically responsible for the regulation of calcium-phosphate balance, osteogenesis,
  bone remodeling, and correct parathyroid hormone function (PTH). In the intestines,
  calcium absorption is increased by the binding of calcitriol to VDR within the enterocyte;
  subsequently, via genomic action, VDR upregulates the expression of enteric calcium
  transporters and calbindin, a calcium-binding protein. Additionally, it increases
  ATP-dependent calcium pump (PMCA) activity, allowing the enterocyte to pump out
  greater amounts of calcium into the bloodstream [,]. Classically, calcitriol paired
  with hypophosphatemia was thought to increase expression of intestinal sodium-inorganic
  phosphate (Na-Pi) cotransporter type II-b (Npt2b) via VDR transcription-dependent
  pathway []. Studies have suggested that low Pi levels may increase Npt2b expression
  independent of vitamin D mediated transcription. However, the genomic action of
  vitamin D cannot be entirely dismissed as it may affect factors involved in the
  post-transcriptional regulation of Npt2b expression [], thus still rendering it
  a contributor to intestinal Pi absorption.In the kidneys, active calcium reabsorption
  is seen in the distal renal tubules. Calcitriol increases renal calcium (Ca+2) uptake
  by stimulating nuclear transcription factors, as described above, increasing the
  expression of calbindin and plasma membrane Ca+2 pump. Renal tubular transport of
  Pi is also dependent upon the presence of calcitriol. Calcitriol increases the expression
  of renal Na-Pi cotransporters, types II-a and II-c, via VDR []. Calcitriol also
  affects renal Pi transport through a liposomes mechanism of action enabled by its
  modulatory effects on membrane phospholipid composition [] is another important
  function of vitamin D in bone homeostasis. Calcitriol regulates bone resorption
  by increasing the differentiation of progenitor cells into mature osteoclasts and
  by stimulating osteoclast-like cell formation via a mechanism involving osteoblasts
  [].Additionally, through its action on calcium and phosphate absorption, calcitriol
  enhances bone mineralization []. Lastly, vitamin D forms a stringent feedback cycle
  with PTH. PTH increases vitamin D synthesis in the kidneys, whereas vitamin D negatively
  affects PTH secretion []. Both vitamin D and PTH then exert regulatory action on
  bone resorption and mineralization.
