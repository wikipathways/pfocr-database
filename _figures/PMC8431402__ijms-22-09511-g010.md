caption: This image shows only the pathways of the resveratrol-induced radiosensitivity
  mechanism in MCF-7 cells that were investigated in this work (black arrows) or discussed
  on the basis of literature data (red arrows). Resveratrol potentiated the radiosensitivity
  in MCF-7 cells by decreasing antioxidant enzyme activity (SOD and CAT). Inhibiting
  SOD and CAT activity would result in increased ROS, thereby causing damage to cellular
  macromolecules. DNA damage leads to activation of the p53 protein. The p53 protein
  mainly acts as a transcription factor that induces and/or inhibits the activation
  of many genes associated with the induction of apoptosis. In the intrinsic pathway
  of apoptosis, p53 may directly activate the proapoptotic Bax protein or inhibit
  the antiapoptotic bcl-2 protein. The Bax protein causes the opening of mitochondrial
  channels and the release of cytochrome c. Cyt c, along with other proapoptotic agents,
  activates caspase 9, which affects the activation of executive caspases. DNA damage
  can also induce the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis associated with the activation
  of surface death receptors (FAS). The changes in the conformation of these receptors
  after attaching to the FADD protein lead to the activation of caspase 8, which can
  induce death via direct cleavage of caspase 7, or can activate intrinsic apoptosis.
  Thus, resveratrol enhances the process of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells that are exposed
  to IR.
