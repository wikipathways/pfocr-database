caption: Hyperglycemia alters the expression of multiple genes of the transforming
  growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) pathway through the polyol pathway in retinal vessels. Upregulated
  genes are shown in red and downregulated genes are shown in blue. The expected effect
  of overexpression of genes on Smad signaling is shown by arrowed lines (stimulation)
  or blunt lines (inhibition). The expected effect of downregulation of Hoxc8 is release
  of inhibition, and thus activation of signaling (dotted blunt line). BMP, bone morphogenetic
  proteins. The figure is a modification from the original in Gerhardinger et al.
