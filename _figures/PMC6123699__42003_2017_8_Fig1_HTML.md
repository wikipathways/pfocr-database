caption: Regulation of Muc1/Flo11 protein. External signals such as nitrogen starvation
  activate Ras2, which in turn triggers both MAP kinase and Ras/PKA pathways through
  a cascade involving Cdc24/Cdc42 and Cyr1, respectively. Several factors from both
  pathways have been shown to control Phd1 expression including Ste12 and Tec1 of
  the MAP kinase pathway and Mga1, Sok2, and Flo8 from the Ras/PKA pathway and Phd1
  itself. In addition, Cdk8 which is expressed in normally growing cells has been
  shown to cause Phd1 and Ste12 protein destabilization. Ultimately, several filamentous
  response genes (FRG) including Flo11 are regulated by Phd1, Flo8, Ste12, Tec1, Mga1,
  and Sok2 and direct the phenotype. Arrows indicate upregulation while lines with
  bars indicate inhibition,
