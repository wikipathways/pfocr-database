caption: The copper-binding protein MEMO1 is required for motility and metastasis
  of cancer cells in response to receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. MEMO1 is postulated
  to produce ROS at the leading edge of cancer cells which and activates pathways
  that influence cancer cell migration and invasion. Copper uptake via CTR1 facilitates
  ATOX1-mediated copper delivery to the ATP7A copper pump, which transports copper
  to the lysyl oxidase family of enzymes (LOX) within the secretory pathway. The LOX
  family of enzymes mediate the cross linking of collagen fibers generating H2O2 which
  facilitates activation of integrin-associated focal adhesion kinase (FAK1) and proto-oncogene
  tyrosine-protein kinase (SRC) which promote subsequent migration and metastasis.
  LOX enzymes also facilitate the formation of pre-metastatic niches at distant metastatic
  sites.
