caption: Possible sources of carbon and energy for microbial food production.A. Carbohydrates
  derived from edible biomass can serve as carbon and energy source of food microbes.B.
  Non‐edible materials, including lignocellulosic biomass, food waste and plastic,
  can be consumed by food microorganisms for sustainable production of microbial foods.C.
  Light energy derived from sunlight or other forms of renewable energy can directly
  drive fixation of CO2 to biomass through photosynthesis. In addition, renewable
  energy can be converted to chemical energies (e.g. H2, reduced metal ions, reduced
  sulfur compounds) and provide reducing power to food microorganisms for CO2 fixation.D.
  Renewable energy can be used to reduce CO2 into organic compounds, such as methane
  (CH4), formaldehyde (CH2O), methanol (CH3OH) and formic acid (HCOOH), that are easier
  to be consumed by microorganisms. The resulting products can serve as both carbon
  source and reducing power, enabling indirect fixation of CO2 into biomass. rAcetyl‐CoA
  cycle, reductive acetyl‐CoA cycle; rTCA cycle, reductive TCA cycle; RuMP cycle,
  ribulose monophosphate cycle; rGlyP, reductive glycine pathway.
