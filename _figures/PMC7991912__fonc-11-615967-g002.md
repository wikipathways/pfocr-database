caption: Pathway overrepresentation and gene ontology analysis of cisplatin-induced
  significantly deregulated proteins. (A) Top 10 canonical pathways identified by
  Ingenuity pathway analysis associated with cisplatin response ranked by significance
  (-log10P value) and predicted pathway activation or inhibition indicated by Z-score.
  (B) Gene ontology enrichment analysis assessed by Gene ontology (GO) biological
  processes with functional networks visualized using ClueGo. GO biological process
  terms listed as nodes with genes belonging to each term represented. Node size represents
  the term enrichment significance. (C) Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG)
  enrichment analyses assessing gene ontology with functional networks visualized
  using ClueGo. KEGG terms listed as nodes with genes belonging to each term represented.
  Node size represents the term enrichment significance. (D) Top five molecular and
  cellular functions identified by Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) ranked by P value
  range and listing the number of molecules identified.
