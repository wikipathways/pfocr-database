caption: (A) The standard pathway with 5-methyl-THF. (B) The reaction catalyzed by
  the core methionine synthases MesA and MesB. (C) The structure of methylcobalamin.
  Cobalamin has 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole as the lower ligand, but many organisms
  use cobamides with other lower ligands. (D) The structure of 5-methyl-THF. Although
  THF is shown with a single glutamyl residue (at right), in the cell, THF is usually
  polyglutamylated.
