caption: Schematic diagram of proposed signaling pathway representing PD-1, PD-L1,
  and their interactions. PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint protein, highly expressed
  in part of tumor cells, and promotes tumor cell escape from T cells. PD-1 expressed
  on T-lymphocytes can bind to PD-L1 and inhibit T cell proliferation and activity.
  IFN-γ derived from tumor-infiltrating immune cells induces transcription of PD-L1
  in tumor cells via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway along with NF-κB. MAPK signaling
  further increased the stability of PD-L1 mRNA, thus higher mRNA and protein levels,
  leading to increased PD-L1 membrane expression. IL-6 binds to IL-6R, resulting in
  homodimerization of the signal-transducing receptor subunit and activating the intracellular
  signaling cascades of JAK, STAT3, MAPK, and PI3K. Pathways converging with c-Jun
  include MAPK and JNK and their reactivation leads to c-Jun and STAT3 dependent enhancement
  of PD-L1 expression. YAP1 translocates to the nucleus interacting with transcription
  factors involved in the transcription of genes associated with cell growth and proliferation.
  Increased kinase activity of EGFR leads to hyperactivation of downstream signaling
  pathways including MAPK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and IL-6/JAK/STAT3 promoting tumorigenesis.
  PD-L1 mRNA is translated into PD-L1 protein, which is transported to the cell membrane.
