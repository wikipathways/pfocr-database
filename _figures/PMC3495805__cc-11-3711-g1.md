caption: Figure 1. Schematization of the potential signaling pathways that Oct4 and
  Nanog mediate to regulate self-renewal and differentiation of human ESCs and MSCs.
  (A) In human ESCs, Oct4 inhibits the BMP4 signaling pathway, which activates mesoderm
  and extraembryonic ectoderm/endoderm differentiation, while Nanog acts as a repressor
  of neural crest and neuroectoderm lineage. (B) In human MSCs, Oct4 and Nanog cooperatively
  induce Dnmt1 expression, which leads to DNA methylation and suppression of p16,
  p21, developmental markers and lineage genes, thereby promoting proliferation and
  maintaining undifferentiated states.
