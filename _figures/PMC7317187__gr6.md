caption: The proposed model for Thbs1 as a novel regulator for lipid metabolism in
  the liver. Serum Thbs1 levels are increased in humans of NAFLD, and decreased after
  liver-fat-lowering intervention. Pharmacologically administration of Thbs1 improves
  hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese mice. The Thbs1-CD36 axis may represent
  a novel molecular mechanism by which extracellular glycoprotein regulates intracellular
  metabolic pathway. These findings suggest that Thbs1 acts as a novel metabolic regulator
  with the therapeutic potential for treating hepatic steatosis via inhibiting hepatic
  de novo lipogenesis.
