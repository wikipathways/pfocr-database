caption: A schematic representation of OsRNSs regulation in the PHR2- and PHO2-mediated
  PSI signaling pathway for increasing internal Pi concentration in rice. PHR2, as
  a central regulator of the Pi signaling pathway, increases miR399 levels, thereby
  inhibiting the E2 ligase, PHO2, at the post-transcriptional level. Meanwhile, the
  direct binding of PHR2 on P1BS cis-regulatory element in the promoter region of
  PHO2 was reported for the possibility of transcriptional regulation of PHO2 by PHR2.
  After the PHO2 protein was generated, it ubiquitinates the phosphate transporters,
  PHT1s, for maintaining phosphate homeostasis. Our results suggest that OsRNS1, 3,
  4, and 5 are negatively regulated by OsPHO2 and that the RNSs are positively regulated
  by OsPHR2 through expression profiling analysis using the mutants. However, it is
  questionable that Pi contents were enhanced in OsPHR2 overexpression lines together
  with the increased amount of the total RNAs including rRNA, the substrate of RNS
  for rRNA catabolism. The shoot preferential OsRNS3, OsRNS4, and OsRNS5 and the root
  preferential OsRNS1 and OsRNS3 seem to be spatially separated and regulated. Finally,
  it is expected that the accumulation of OsRNSs in each tissue will promote RNA degradation
  and increase the internal Pi concentration. Proteins are represented by circle;
  cis-regulatory elements, rhombus; mRNA, distorted square; known pathway, solid line;
  unknown but expected pathway, dotted line.
