caption: Model of turgor pressure generation involving fatty acids, glycogen, glycerol
  and triacylglycerols in M. oryzae. Pathway (1) is where glycogen is carried into
  the glycolysis pathway to produced pyruvate, which then enters Krebs cycle for energy
  production for penetration of fungus into host []. Pathway (2) involves lipid bodies
  moving into the appressorium during maturation, where they are degraded by triacylglycerol
  lipase during turgor generation []. Pathway (3) explains the glycoxylate cycle that
  produces glycerol. Pathway (4) involves the fatty acid synthesis at the top of the
  route and ends with fatty acid degradation for turgor pressure of the appressorium
  [].
