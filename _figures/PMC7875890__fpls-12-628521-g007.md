caption: Simplified depiction of the influence of the OsAnt1:HvAlaAT transgene on
  the carbon and nitrogen metabolism pathway, consisting of glycolysis, TCA cycle,
  and GABA shunt. Increased gene activities are indicated with green arrows. Heatmaps
  of metabolites of the shoot and root where both transgenic lines show significant
  differences to WT in low N (0.5 mM N) and high N (2.5 mM N) are presented. Metabolite
  levels were processed by median normalization, log-transformed, and auto-scaling
  with MetaboAnalyst (). Processes associated with certain metabolites were also presented
  (Acetyl-CoA, Citrate, and Succinate), with dotted arrows linking the aforementioned
  metabolites to represent either an end product (arrow direction toward it) or a
  substrate/catalyst (arrow direction away from it).
