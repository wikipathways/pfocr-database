caption: A working model for the role of USP4 in the negative regulation of TNFα-induced
  TAK1 polyubiquitnation and NF-κB activation. On binding of TNFα, TNFR1 recruits
  several adaptor proteins including TRAF2, cIAP1/2 and RIPK1 to form a complex that
  subsequently leads to Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF2 and RIPK1. Possibly,
  the Lys63-linked TRAF2 polyubiquitination further recruits and activates TAK1 through
  binding of the TAK1 regulatory subunits TAB2 and TAB3 to the Lys63-polyubiquitinated
  chains. After recruitment of TAK1 to the TNFR1 complex, TRAF2 along with its cofactor
  S1P polyubiquitinate and activates TAK. Then, TNFR1 complex recruits IKK complex
  via Lys63-polyubiquitinated TAK1 and RIPK1. Activated TAK1 triggers the activation
  of the IKK, JNK and p38 MAPK, which leads to activation of NF-κB and AP-1. After
  TNFα stimulation, USP4 binds to the activated TAK1 and deubiquitinates TAK1 to disrupt
  TAK1/IKKs complex and inhibits TAK1-mediated downstream signaling pathway. Besides
  USP4, other deubiquitinases (A20, Cezanne, CYLD, USP21, USP15 and USP11) have been
  suggested to negatively regulate TNFα-induced NF-κB activation
