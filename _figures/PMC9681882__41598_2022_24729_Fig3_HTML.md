caption: Protein–protein pathway analysis illustrating significantly downregulated
  proteins in POTS. Protein–protein interaction analysis of 7 out of 11 upregulated
  proteins with association networks detected by STRING in POTS. In the network figures,
  each protein is represented by a colored node while protein–protein interaction
  and association are represented by a line. The strongest network interactions in
  POTS were particularly associated with a hypercoagulable state, inflammation, and
  enhanced cardiac contractility and hypertrophy. Complete names of proteins are found
  in Table .
