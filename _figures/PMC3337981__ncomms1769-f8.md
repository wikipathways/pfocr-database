caption: (a) BCR crosslinking activates the non-canonical NF-κB pathway by inducing
  expression of p100 and its processing to p52 in a PI(3)K-dependent fashion. TLR
  engagement (as exemplified by TLR4 engagement by lipid A) activates the canonical
  NF-κB pathway, resulting in limited Aicda expression and marginal CSR. BCR enhances
  the TLR-dependent canonical NF-κB pathway, likely through TRAF6 activation, and
  TLR enhances the BCR-activated non-canonical NF-κB pathway by inducing p100 expression,
  thereby synergizing in inducing AID and CSR. (b) Unlike lipid A, LPS triggers both
  BCR-signalling through its polysaccharidic moiety and TLR4-signalling through its
  lipid A moiety, thereby activating both the non-canonical and canonical NF-κB pathways
  to induce AID and CSR in a PI(3)K-dependent fashion. (c) CD40 activation of the
  non-canonical and canonical NF-κB pathways and induction of CSR depend on TRAF2/TRAF3,
  which, however, play no role in the BCR-signalling pathway; TRAF6 mediates activation
  of the canonical NF-κB pathway only and is dispensable for CSR induced by CD40-signalling.
