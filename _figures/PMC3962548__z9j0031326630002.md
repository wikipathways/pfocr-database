caption: 'Clot formation. Coagulation is an amplified cascade that begins with exposure
  of a few initiating molecules and ends with many thousands of thrombin molecules.
  The initiators are tissue factor (extrinsic pathway; primary in vivo initiator of
  coagulation) or contact activation of factors XII and XI (intrinsic pathway). Subsequent
  reactions repeat a simple amplification unit: a cofactor (green) binds an enzyme
  (red) on a phospholipid surface (lime green). This assembled trimeric complex binds
  a circulating zymogen precursor (yellow) so that the complexed enzyme can cleave
  and activate it. A new enzyme is created, and this is incorporated into the next
  amplification unit for activation of the next zymogen precursor. Each step requires
  calcium (factor IV), and activated platelets provide the majority of the phospholipid
  surfaces needed. By this mechanism, the prothrombinase complex (factors Xa, Va,
  phospholipid) cleaves prothrombin (factor II), releasing fragment 1.2 and creating
  thrombin. Thrombin removes fibrinopeptides A and B from fibrinogen, which creates
  fibrin. The fibrin monomers aggregate and are cross-linked into an insoluble fibrin
  mesh. This provides surfaces necessary for the fibrinolytic pathway, another set
  of activators and enzymes that cleave the clot and release clot fragments (fibrin
  degradation products, FDP; d-dimer) into the circulation. Thrombin is pluripotent,
  acting as a coagulation enzyme, a mitogenic growth factor, and a proinflammatory
  mediator. Thrombin activates protease-activated receptors (PARs) on platelets and
  endothelial cells to propagate inflammation signaling. Many feedback loops in the
  coagulation cascade fine-tune clot formation to serve the needs of the immediate
  environment. In a patient with severe sepsis and DIC, uncontrolled coagulation results
  in consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, which paradoxically create
  a bleeding risk and considerable therapeutic challenges.'
