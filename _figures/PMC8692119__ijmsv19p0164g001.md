caption: BAFF and BAFF-R signaling pathways. In the presence of BAFF, TRAF3 is intracellularly
  recruited to BAFF-R allowing NIK to activate the non-canonical NF-KB2 pathway which
  results in p52/RelB nuclear translocation and activation of cell survival genes.
  Another pathway activated after BAFF/BAFF-R binding is the canonical that upregulates
  the expression of various genes, such as NF-KB. Apart from these, PI3K pathway,
  which shares molecules with the BCR signaling, is additionally activated. Furthermore,
  it has been shown recently that BAFF interacts with NgR1 and NgR3, promoting B cell
  proliferation and maturation. Lastly, TACI and BCMA can also bind with BAFF and
  APRIL firing signals that promote antigen presentation and cell survival.
