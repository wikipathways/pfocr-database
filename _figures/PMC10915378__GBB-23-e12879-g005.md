caption: Neurodevelopmental and thalamocortical processes involved in epistasis driving
  spike‐and‐wave discharge (SWD) phenotypes in mice. Gene pairs identified through
  network‐based functional prediction and filtered for loci on chromosomes 2 and 7
  are involved in multiple brain‐related pathways that could contribute to SWD phenotypes.
  Top candidates are indicated in red. (A) Critical thalamocortical connections are
  made during neurodevelopment. (B) Microtubule development and stabilization with
  the gene pair Tubgcp4 and Ppme1, which involves microtubule nucleation with gamma‐tubulin
  ring complex (gamma‐TuRC), microtubule stabilization with tau proteins, activation
  of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by microtubule depolymerization and inactive, Ppme1‐bound
  PP2A. (C) Microtubule dynamics and transportation and anchoring with the golgi complex
  in the growth cone of the neuron, where beta‐catenin is also present. (D) Cell cycle
  regulation and mitotic spindle apparatus with microtubules during neurodevelopment.
  (E) Apoptotic signaling involving death‐inducing signaling complex (DISC) and caspase‐8
  as well as DNA damage pathways involving the pair Ddias and Dut. (F) Wnt/beta‐catenin
  signaling pathway turned on (pink) where beta‐catenin is possibly stabilized by
  Ddias and can enter the nucleus, and turned off (gray) where beta‐catenin is degraded
  by the beta‐catenin destruction complex, which also includes active PP2A. Created
