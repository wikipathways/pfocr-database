  and Known Human Genetic Vitamin-B6-Dependent EpilepsiesPyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP);
  pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP); pyridoxal (PL); pyridoxine (PN); pyridoxine 5′-phosphate
  (PNP); pyridoxine-5′-β-D-glucoside (PNG); intestinal phosphatases (IP); transporter
  (identity unknown; T1); pyridoxal kinase (PK); pyridox(am)ine 5′-phosphate oxidase
  (PNPO); tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP); pyridoxal-phosphatase
  (PLPase); aldehyde oxidase (Mo cofactor)/β-NAD dehydrogenase (AOX/DH). (1) PNPO
  is controlled by feedback inhibition from PLP. (2) PLP functions as a co-factor,
  forming Schiff bases with the ε-amino group of lysine residues of proteins. (3)
  PLP can be formed by recycling the cofactor from degraded enzymes (salvage pathway).
  (4) PLP levels are maintained, in part, by circadian-clock-controlled transcription
  factors with PAR bZip transcription factors (DBP, HLF, and TEF) targeting PK. (5)
  PNPO mutations cause a B6-dependent epilepsy disorder. (6) Disorders resulting in
  accumulation of L-Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid (P5C) and Δ1-piperideine-6-carboxylic
  acid (P6C) (hyperprolinaemia type II and pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy due to mutations
  in ALDH4A1 and ALDH7A1, respectively) cause decreases in bioavailable PLP as do
  reactions with exogenous small molecules.
