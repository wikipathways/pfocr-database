caption: The chronic signals of HSPCs under conditions with chronic inflammation.
  TLR4, IL-1, and IL-6 are important mediators in chronic signal pathways. They utilize
  the same downstream pathway to activate myeloid skewing. ROS are produced from mitochondria
  in reaction to chronic inflammation. ROS dysregulates HSPC function by upregulating
  the specific transcription factors such as FoxO and Gfi1. p38 MAPK pathway is also
  activated by ROS resulting in the inhibition of HSPC self-renewal. The sympathetic
  nerve system plays an essential role in HSPC differentiation as a part of the bone
  marrow niche. TGF-β is produced from glial cells ensheathing sympathetic nerves
  and negatively regulates HSPC proliferation. TGF-β noncanonical pathway (dashed
  line) has crosstalk with other signaling pathways to orchestrate HSPC function.
