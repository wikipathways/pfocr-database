caption: 'Summary of lymphomagenesis of SMZL created using BioRender.com thanks to
  these two reviews [,]. The mutation of NOTCH2 (arising in 10–25% of SMZLs) will
  lead to the translocation of its intracellular domain to the nucleus, inducing a
  constitutive activation of this pathway and resulting in the transcription of multiple
  genes. It is associated with mutations that will have the effect of activating the
  NFκB pathway, such as CARD11 (among 8% of cases) or MYD88 via Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs). The canonical pathway for the NFκB activation also passes through IKKb (itself
  mutated in 4% SMZL). Other mutations impact the MAP3K14 pathway, involving TRAF3
  and BIRC3 (mutated in 4% of SMZLs) complexes, leading to the activation of NFκB
  via its non-canonical pathway, passing through IKKa. Other mutations are inhibitory,
  such as the KLF2 (25%) or TNFAIP3 (13%) mutations. Apart from mutations, these two
  molecules play a role in inhibiting the NFκB pathway. Created with BioRender.com,
