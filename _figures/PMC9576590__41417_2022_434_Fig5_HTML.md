caption: G1/S cell cycle block (marked by a cross) driven by p53 is accompanied by
  accumulation of Rb protein, a critical suppressor of G1/S transition. Rb-triggered
  up-regulation of lysosomal compartment stimulates mTOR. In turn, mTOR activates
  PGC1α, a transcription factor involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. Up-regulated
  mitochondrial compartment accompanied by increase in respiration leads to increased
  ROS formation. It is followed by DNA damage, a main trigger of the ATM-mediated
  activation of NFκB pathway, p53, and PGC1α. As a result, positive feedback loops
  are forming that lead to senescence. NFκB-regulated transcription program triggers
  elevation of cytokines, chemokines, metalloproteinases (MMPs), and other molecules
  secreted by senescent cells (senescence-associated secretory phenotype, SASP). The
  secreted molecules attract immune cells, which induce inflammation in tissues populated
  with senescent cells.
