caption: Relationship between NLRP3-dependent pyroptosis and depression. In different
  models of stress-induced depression, NLRP3 inflammasome activation can worsen depression-like
  behaviour by inducing pyroptosis and triggering neuroinflammation. Hyperglycemia
  and X-ray can induce ROS production, which leads to NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  in hippocampal neurons. CS-induced glucocorticoid antagonism promotes NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation. hUC-MSCs reduce C3aR, which attenuated NLRP3 activation. SIM inhibits
  hippocampal microglia and NLRP3 inflammasome activation by suppressing the expression
  of P2X7R, TLR2, and TLR4. Ca(2+) disturbance caused by P2X7R and TRPV4 dysfunction
  can activate CaMKII and then promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Monosodium glutamate
  can upregulate GSDMD. These will lead to NLRP3-dependent pyroptosis and depression-like
  manifestations. NLRP3 inflammasome signaling is downregulated in CD36(-/-) mice.
  The TRPV4 inhibitor HC067047 inhibits hippocampal glial cell activation and NLRP3
  inflammasome expression. NLRP3 activation promotes ET-1 release and thus reduces
  ETBR expression. DaPa maintains the blood–brain barrier integrity by regulating
  the NLRP3/ET-1/E B TR/BDNF/ZO-1 axis. Ganoderic acid A inhibits NLRP3 activation
  by upregulating FXR in mice. NU9065, rapamycin, memantine, MOOs, catalpol, PDE4
  inhibitors, KXS, AF, SPJ, minocycline, and dexmedetomidine can also inhibit NLRP3
  activation. Dexmedetomidine can also inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes.
  The antidepressants fluoxetine, paroxetine, and mianserin induce autophagy and thus
  inhibit NLRP3 activation. Isoliquiritin inhibits NLRP3 activation by upregulating
  miRNA-27a. DMF reduces NLRP3 levels by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. VX-765,
  CORM-3, and rifampicin can reduce depression by inhibiting caspase-1/11. Downregulation
  of NLRP3-dependent pyroptosis-related pathways alleviates depression-like behaviors.
