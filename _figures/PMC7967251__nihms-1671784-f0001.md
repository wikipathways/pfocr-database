caption: Sphingolipid biochemical pathways.The sphingolipid metabolic pathway is centered
  on ceramide, where it can be generated via the de novo pathway, the breakdown of
  C1P, sphingomyelin and glycoceramides, or from the salvage of sphingosine. Sphingosine
  is phosphorylated to S1P by sphingosine kinases, and S1P signaling can be terminated
  either by conversion to sphingosine by S1P phosphatases or by the irreversible actions
  of S1P lyase.
