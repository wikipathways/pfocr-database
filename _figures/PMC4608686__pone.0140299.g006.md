caption: Transcripts measured in the current study are shown in the diagram as nodes
  and are colored based on the differences observed when cells are stimulated with
  Copaxone in comparison with cell culture media alone (P < 1e-3 [Student’s t-test];
  red for increase, green for decrease). Molecules with P > 1e-3 are shown in gray.
  Genes refer to the human ortholog. Human HLA-DMA, HLA-DMB, and HLA-DQB1 represent
  murine H2-Dma, H2-Dmb2, and H2-Ab1, respectively. Blue arrows show the flow of activation
  by major Th1- and Th2-influencing molecules in the pathway. For example, APCs produce
  IL-4, which binds to and activates the IL-4 receptor, leading to the phosphorylation
  and activation of the transcription factor STAT6. Red and green arrows show the
  expected transcriptional outcomes of Th1 and Th2 polarization; red and green arrows
  indicate that activation will cause the transcript to increase and decrease, respectively.
  Expected transcriptional outcomes are based on reports in the literature on Th1/Th2
  T-cell polarization and on studies conducted with GA [,,,,,–]. Gray lines indicate
  members of a group. APCs, antigen-presenting cells; CXCR1, chemokine (C-X-C motif)
  receptor 1; CXCR3, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3; CXCR5, chemokine (C-X-C motif)
  receptor 5; CXCL10, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10; GA, glatiramer acetate; HLADMA,
  major histocompatibility complex class II, DM alpha; HLADMB, major histocompatibility
  complex class II, DM beta; HLADQB1, major histocompatibility complex class II, DQ
  beta 1; ICOSLG, inducible T-cell costimulatory ligand; IL-4, interleukin-4; MHC
  class II, major histocompatibility complex class II; LTB, lymphotoxin beta (tumor
  necrosis factor superfamily, member 3); MYD, myeloid differentiation primary response
  protein; S100A10, S100 calcium-binding protein A10; STAT, signal transducer and
  activator of transcription; TCR, T-cell receptor; Th, T-helper.
