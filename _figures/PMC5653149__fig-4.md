caption: TSP1 regulation of NO synthesis. TSP1 binding to its receptor CD47 on the
  plasma membrane transduces signals by dissociating its lateral interaction with
  VEGFR2, by altering cytoplasmic calcium, and by other undefined pathways. Signaling
  downstream of VEGFR2 through Src and the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway controls the phosphorylation
  of eNOS at several sites and the phosphorylation of HSP90 associated with eNOS.
  TSP1, via CD47, also limits eNOS activation separate from effects mediated through
  VEGFR2. Altered cytoplasmic calcium regulates the binding of calmodulin, which controls
  the activity of eNOS and its production of NO versus O2•−. At higher concentrations
  (>10 nM), TSP1 inhibits CD36-mediated uptake of myristic acid (), limiting substrate
  for NMT to acylate Src. This modification is necessary for optimal tyrosine phosphorylation
  of eNOS. NMT, N-myristoyl transferase; VEGFR2, vascular endothelial growth factor
  receptor-2. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred to the web
