caption: Our working model illustrated that sequential release of pro-inflammatory
  factors suppresses later IL-10 production in LPS-stimulated microglia. In time frame
  of neuroinflammatory cascade, IL-10 expression was later than most pro-inflammatory
  factors such as TNF-α, COX-2 and PGE2. Directly treated cells with early released
  pro-inflammatory factors or microglia conditioned medium from enriched microglia
  treated with LPS failed to initiate IL-10 production in the absence of LPS. Thus,
  it is plausible that IL-10 induction was dependent on intrinsic signal events such
  as MAPK and NF-κb pathways, but not in need of early released pro-inflammatory factors.
  Conversely, deficiency in tnf-α and cox-2 gene significantly decreased PGE2 production
  but increased IL-10 production. Exogenous addition of PGE2 inhibited LPS-induced
  IL-10 production via EP2-mediating G protein-independent β-arrestin signaling pathway.
  Together, our results showed that an extracellular autocrine cascade from TNF-α
  and PGE2 plays a negative role in the regulation of LPS-induced IL-10 production
  in microglia.
