caption: The PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. (A) In healthy cells, PINK1, a mitochondrial
  serine/threonine kinase, is cleaved by an inner-mitochondrial membrane protease,
  and the cleaved PINK1 is then retro-translocated to the cytosol where it undergoes
  proteasomal degradation. (B) Under stress conditions, dissipation of mitochondrial
  membrane potential leads to the inhibition of PINK1 cleavage and supports the accumulation
  of full-length PINK1 at the MOM. PINK1 phosphorylates basal MOM ubiquitin which
  drives Parkin recruitment to the mitochondria and further phosphorylates Parkin
  to stabilize the binding of Parkin to ubiquitin. In addition, PINK1 phosphorylates
  mitofusin-2 (MFN2), a mitochondria fusion protein, which also serves as a receptor
  for Parkin at MOM. Ubiquitinated mitochondria are recognized by the autophagosome
  membrane through the autophagy receptor proteins, which interact with LC3 on the
  autophagosome membrane. (C) Signaling molecules regulating the PINK1/Parkin pathway.
