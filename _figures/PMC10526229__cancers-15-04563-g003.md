caption: 'Modulation of NICD release. ADAM protease inhibitors (Lomitapide, Aderbasib,
  Marimastat, ZLDI-8) block NOTCH S2 cleavage and, consequently, further activation
  of the NOTCH receptor. The use of γ-secretase inhibitors (γSI; GSI) prevents S3
  cleavage and subsequent NICD release. The NICD can be translocated to the nucleus
  where it is involved in canonical Notch signaling or interacts with other signaling
  pathways as a component of non-canonical Notch signaling. These events are influenced
  by proteasome activity (inhibited by Bortezomib) and a number of broad-spectrum
  substances collectively named as Pan-Assay INterference compoundS (PAINS) such as
  Resveratrol and Curcumin. Red: attenuation of Notch signaling; Blue: pleiotropic
  effect on Notch signaling.'
