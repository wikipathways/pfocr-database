caption: A proposed pathway of EGF-induced cell proliferation of ER− breast cancer
  cells. The interaction of EGF with EGFR and the proposed downstream events of NF-κB
  activation and cell-cycle progression are schematically shown. The shaded molecules
  are monitored. The sites of action of agents used to block individual steps of this
  pathway, such as EGF–EGFR interaction by EGFR-Ab, PI3 kinase (phosphotidylinositol
  3-kinase) activity by Ly294–002, PKC (protein kinase C) activity by G06976, and
  IKK activity by IKK-M (dominant-negative mutant of IKK) are shown. The role of G1-specific
  cell-cycle regulatory proteins, ccD1 and phosphorylated retinoblastoma (pRb), and
  unphosphorylated Rb is illustrated.
