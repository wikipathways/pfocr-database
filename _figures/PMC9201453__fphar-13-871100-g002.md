caption: TH/TR axis is involved in HCC growth, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis.
  The TH/TR axis upregulates endoglin, thus restraining P21 polyubiquitination-induced
  cell proliferation. The TH/TR axis inhibits hepatoma cell growth via repressing
  UHRF1 and relieves UHRF1-mediated P21 silence. TH induces the miR-214-3p expression,
  followed by interfering with PIM-1 and activating P21, thus blocking cell proliferation.
  The depletion of HCB by TH downregulates the TGF-β1/pSMAD-2/3 signaling pathway,
  thus increasing Dio1 levels and decreasing p21 and P27, ultimately suppressing cell
  proliferation. The silence of TGF-β mice promote the proliferation by increasing
  the expressions of CDK2, cyclin E, and cyclin A, as well as decreasing the expression
  of CDKn1a/p21. Depleting FOXM1 by TH interferes with cyclin D1, cyclin E, and CDK2,
  thereby inhibiting HCC cell proliferation.
