caption: 'Biochemical schema of 1C metabolism. One-carbon metabolism couples with
  three reactions: folate cycle, methionine cycle, and transsulfuration pathway [].
  The folate cycle produces purines and nucleotide synthesis. The methionine cycle
  plays a critical role in the control of methylation of target DNA, RNA, and proteins.
  The transsulfuration pathway is involved in the regulation of cancer stem cells
  by the reduction control of cells. Polyamines control cell proliferation and differentiation
  in cancer stem cells. ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH,
  S-adenosylhomocysteine.'
