caption: After leptin binds to the long isoform of the leptin receptor (OB-Rb), Jak2
  is activated at the box1 motif, resulting in the autophosphorylation of tyrosine
  residues and phosphorylation of tyrosines that provide docking sites for signalling
  proteins containing src homology 2 (SH2) domains. The autophosphorylated Jak2 at
  the box 1 motif can phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate1/2 (IRS1/2) that leads
  to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Akt can regulate
  a wide range of targets including FOXO1 and NF-κB. Activation of NF-κB after leptin
  binding has been shown to induce Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL expressions. Leptin binding to
  OB-Rb can also activate the phospholipase C (PLC) for stimulation of c-jun N-terminal
  protein kinase (JNK) via protein kinase C (PKC).Both Tyr1077 and Tyr1138 bind to
  STAT5, whereas only Tyr1138 recruits STAT1 and STAT3. STAT3 proteins form dimers
  and translocate to the nucleus to induce expression of genes such as c-fos, c-jun,
  egr-1, activator protein-1 (AP-1) and suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3).
  SOCS3 negatively regulates signal transduction by leptin by binding to phosphorylated
  tyrosines on the receptor, to inhibit the binding of STAT proteins and the SH2 domain-containing
  phosphatase 2 (SHP2). SHP2 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  pathways including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK and
  p42/44 MAPK through an interaction with the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound
  protein 2 (GRB2), to induce cytokine and chemokine expression in immune cells. SOCS2
  binds to Tyr1077 and might interfere with STAT5 binding. After stimulation with
  leptin, Src associated in mitosis protein 68 (Sam68) can form a complex with activated
  STAT3, leading to its dissociation from RNA. Sam68 can also be directly activated
  by Jak2 to phosphorylate IRS1/2 for Akt activation.
