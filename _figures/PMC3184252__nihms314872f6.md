caption: 'The pathways of androgen biosynthesis. In the classical pathway (solid gray
  arrow), C21 precursors (pregnenolone and progesterone) are converted to the C19
  adrenal androgens DHEA and androstenedione (AED) by the sequential hydroxylase and
  lyase activity of CYP17A1. DHEA and AED are converted to testosterone by a series
  of reactions involving the activity of HSD3B1 and 2, HSD17B3 and AKR1C3 enzymes.
  Testosterone is converted to the potent androgen DHT by the activity of SRD5A1 and
  2. Oxida-tive 3 α-HSD enzymes (including HSD17B6 (RL-HSD), HSD17B10, HSD17B13 (DHRS9),
  RODH4 and RDH5) can act to inhibit the pre-receptor catabolism of DHT. An alternative
  pathway (short gray arrows) has also been proposed in which C21 precursors are first
  acted upon by SRD5A and the reductive activity of AKR1C2, followed by CYP17A1, HSD17B3
  and subsequent oxidation to DHT Adapted from Mostaghel EA, Nelson PS. Intracrine
