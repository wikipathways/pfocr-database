caption: 'A Ligand-Independent Activation: In this scenario, the HH pathway is activated
  without the presence of the HH ligand. The Patched (Ptch) receptor is inactive,
  allowing the Smoothened (Smo) protein to remain active. This leads to the activation
  of the Gli-A transcription factor, which then moves into the nucleus and promotes
  the transcription of target genes that drive cancer cell proliferation. B Ligand-Dependent
  Activation: Here, the HH pathway activation depends on the presence of the HH ligand.
  The HH ligand binds to the Ptch receptor, which results in the inhibition of Ptch
  activity. This inhibition allows Smo to activate, leading to the activation of the
  Gli-A transcription factor. Gli-A then translocates to the nucleus and induces the
  expression of target genes involved in cancer progression. Created with BioRender.com'
