caption: The differentially hypomethylated genes found in the 450k microarray study
  were input into GeneMANIA for co-expression analysis, which revealed that they are
  related to type I interferon pathways, including “response to type I interferon”
  (FDR = 1.45e-34), “type I interferon-mediated signaling pathway” (FDR = 1.45e-34)
  and “cellular response to type I interferon” (FDR = 1.45e-34). Genes identified
  in these three co-expression pathways are overlapped with each other and are indicated
  in blue circles. Black circles indicate the differentially hypomethylated genes
  found in the 450k microarray, whereas circles with alternating black and blue stripes
  indicate hypomethylated genes that are overrepresented in type 1 interferon pathways.
