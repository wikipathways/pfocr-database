caption: The planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway regulates epithelial cell and tissue
  polarity by regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Following non-canonical Wnt ligand
  binding to Fz and co-localization of a co-receptor, Dsh is activated and localized
  to the inner membrane leaflet. PDZ and DEP domains simultaneously activate small
  GTPases Rho and Rac through parallel pathways, as well as the actin-binding protein
  Profilin. Activation of Rho and Profilin occur through a Dishevelled associated
  activator of morphogenesis 1 (Daam1)-dependent pathway; Rac activation is Daam1-independent.
  Activation of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and myosin occur downstream of Rho activation,
  leading to modification and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Rac GTPase
  activates JNK, whose downstream effects leading to cytoskeletal modification remain
  poorly characterized. This cytoskeletal modification regulates both the apical-basal
  polarity of cells and the polarity of cells within an epithelial layer.
