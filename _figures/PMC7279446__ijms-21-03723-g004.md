caption: Intracellular signaling in endothelial cells in the induction of angiogenesis
  by CX3CL1. Activation of CX3CR1 causes signal transduction in endothelial cells,
  which causes angiogenesis. The most important activated pathways in this process
  are ERK MAPK and PI3K → Akt/PKB. Activation of ERK MAPK causes migration, proliferation
  and tube formation of endothelial cells. This MAPK cascade may also participate
  indirectly in angiogenesis and increase the expression of HIF-1α, responsible for
  increasing VEGF-A165 production. This growth factor participates directly in angiogenesis.
  Another pathway activated by CX3CR1 is PI3K → Akt/PKB, which in turn increases the
  activation of eNOS and NO production. It is likely that it is activated directly
  by EGFR, and CX3CR1 plays only an indirect role. Another important pathway in angiogenesis
  caused by CX3CR1 activation is JNK MAPK. Activation of this cascade causes migration
  of endothelial cells.
