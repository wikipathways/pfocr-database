caption: A model of enhanced cancer invasiveness and proliferation elicited by adjacent
  fibroblasts. Cancer cells produce various secreted factors, including growth factors,
  cytokines, and chemokines, and these soluble factors presumably suppress p53 expression
  in fibroblasts, leading to the up-regulated expression of α-SMA, a marker of CAF-like
  characteristics. The down-regulation of p53 in fibroblasts derepresses TSPAN12 expression,
  and TSPAN12 is required to enhance cancer invasiveness and proliferation elicited
  by p53 down-regulated fibroblasts through contact between cancer cells and fibroblasts.
  The up-regulated expression of TSPAN12 promotes CXCL6 expression through the β-catenin–mediated
  pathway, which leads to enhanced cancer progression.

  cancer invasion.
