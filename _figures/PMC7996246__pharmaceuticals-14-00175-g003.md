caption: AT2R-mediated intracellular signaling pathways involved in neuronal cells.
  Several intracellular signaling pathways are associated with AT2R activation in
  neuronal cells leading to apoptosis via activation of the phosphatase MPK-1, neurite
  elongation via reorganization of the cytoskeleton, or neuronal differentiation in
  part via upregulation of growth-factors, depending on the cell type, the context,
  and the environment. To date, ATIP1 is identified as a partner of AT2R involved
  in intracellular signaling pathway and trafficking in neuronal cells. While the
  evidence of an ATIP/AT2R complex comes from experiments on central nervous system
  neurons, we could hypothesize that a similar system exists in PNS neurons. AT2R
  signaling may antagonize AT1R-mediated signaling by a direct heterodimerization
  between the two. As well, homodimerization of AT2R might result in ligand-independent
  signaling.
