caption: Summary of Potential Eph/Ephrin Tumor Promoting Pathways. A composite scheme
  of major tumorigenesis promoting Eph/ephrin signaling pathways is shown together.
  Ligand-independent forward signaling tumor promoting pathways shown for EphA and
  EphB receptors. Forward signaling pathways marked with an asterisk are known to
  be inhibited in ligand-dependent manner and participate in tumor suppression. Reverse
  signaling pathways are also shown for ephrin A and ephrin B. Yellow circles indicate
  phosphorylation of specific tyrosine/serine/threonine residues that are required
  for pathway activation. The broken bidirectional arrow represents cross-talk between
  Eph/ephrin and other types of receptors or pathways. Scissors symbol represents
  expression and/or function of proteases such as ADAM or MMP that are involved in
  the regulation of EphA and ephrin-B pathways, respectively. EMT indicates epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition. The figure is adapted from representative publications of Pasquale [],
  Lisle et al. [], Boyd et al. [], and Xi et al. []. In addition, some of the pathways
  are substantiated from observations presented in several reports in the literature
  related to trastuzumab [], COPII vesicles [], NMDA receptor [], E-cadherin [], WNT
  pathway [], and claudins [, ] for their relevance to tumor promoting pathways.
