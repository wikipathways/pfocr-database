caption: In general, MIF is an proximal mediator of host defense that up-regulates
  the expression of pattern recognition receptors (eg TLR-4) and perpetuates inflammatory
  responses by inhibiting activation-induced apoptosis in monocytes and macrophages.
  As mentioned above in chronic spondyloarthritis the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids
  on cytokine mRNA translation may be counter-regulated by MIF. Furthermore, dysbiosis
  could trigger TLR-4 ligands to induce ileal production of MIF, especially in CD163+
  macrophages, DCs and Paneth cells, which consequently activates CD14+ monocytes
  to produce TNF-α/IL-23 and primes adaptive and innate (Type 3) immune cells to produce
  IL-17A (Red box 1). Chemokine CXCL4 (MIF co-receptor) promotes IL-17 production
  in human CD4+ T cells by acting both directly on CD3/CD28-activated human (naive)
  CD4+ T cells or indirectly via myeloid antigen presenting cells (mDCs). On the other
  hand, IL-7 is a cytokine that, better than IL-23, stimulates IL-17 production in
  both innate and adaptive immunity, and suppress the function of regulatory T cells
  (Treg). High levels of IL-7 have been confirmed both in the intestinal tissue and
  in the inflamed synovium of patients with AS. The tissue-resident γδ T cells, ILC3s,
  circulating and/or gut-derived α4β7 γδ T cells, TH17 cells, or mucosal associated
  invariant T (MAIT) cells all are known to promote IL-17-driven joint/entheseal inflammation.
  MIF, along with TNF-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, also induces synovitis
  and enthesitis with bone erosions. Joint hypoxia induces hypoxia inducible factor
  (HIF) expression that augments inflammation-promoting Th17 cell development through
  recruitment to the IL-17 promoter. In parallel, HIF-1, by binding to Foxp3, restricts
  regulatory T cell (Treg) development. Through positive feedback loop HIF-1 induces
  MIF, which in turn causes HIF-1 expression via the MIF receptor (CD74). In contrast
  to early phases of SpA, axial inflammation is not dependent on IL-23, but rather
  on IL-17A and most likely MIF. MIF is inducing mineralization of primary osteoblasts
  in a dose-dependent manner, upregulates genes involved in osteogenesis and triggers
  stabilization of a known mediators of osteoblastic activity, namely β-catenin and
  wingless protein ligand (Wnt). (Red box 2). Beside MIF, upregulated PGE2, IL-1β,
  TNF-α, IL-17A, IL-22, IL-26 and IL-23, BMP-2, calcium-sensing receptor CaSR-PLCγ-signaling
  and downregulated sclerostin, ankylosis progressive homolog (ANKH) and Dikkopf-1
  (DKK-1) protein are important pathways involved in bone remodeling and tissue repair.
  Finally, activation of both the canonical Wnt/β-catenin and noncanonical Wnt/PKCδ
  pathways is required for inflammation-induced new bone formation (NBF) in SpA. Taken
  all together, it still unknow what is/are the most important factors in NBF, even
  TREGS were recently proposed to paradoxically, via IL-10, promote NBF through suppressing
  Th17 production [adapted modified from (, , , , –)]. Red line/box- MIF pathway;
