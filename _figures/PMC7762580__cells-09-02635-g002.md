caption: 'Fructose contribution to the pentose phosphate pathway. Fructose can contribute
  to the oxidative (blue) as well as the non-oxidative (red) pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP). To enter the oxidative PPP, fructose has to be either metabolized via the
  polyol pathway to glucose and further to G6P or directly via HK to F6P which can
  be converted to G6P. Direct phosphorylation via HK to F6P provides also a substrate
  for the non-oxidative PPP. Together with GA3P, F6P is converted by TKT to X5P and
  E4P. GA3P can also be provided by fructose metabolized via KHK. Both F6P and GA3P
  are used in further reactions of the non-oxidative PPP, demonstrating multiple entry
  points of fructose into the non-oxidative PPP. AKR1B1: aldo-keto reductase family
