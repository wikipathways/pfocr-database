caption: A systems glycobiology framework to link multi-OMICs data. a) Cell signaling
  proceeds to trigger TF activity. The binding of TFs to sites proximal to the TSS
  triggers glycogene expression. A complex set of reaction pathways then results in
  the synthesis of various carbohydrate types, many of which are either secreted or
  expressed on the cell surface. b) Data available at various resources can establish
  the link between cell signaling and glycan biosynthesis. The Reactome DB contains
  cell signaling knowledge. Chip-Seq and RNA-Seq data available at the Cistrome Cancer
  DB describe the link between the TFs and glycogenes. Pathway curation at GlycoEnzDB
  establishes the link between glycogenes and glycan structures. Cell illustration
