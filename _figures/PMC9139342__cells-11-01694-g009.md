caption: Mechanisms of resistance to molecularly targeted therapy in NSCLC. In TKI-resistant
  NSCLC cells activated EGFR leads to activation of the MAPK, FAK-Paxillin, and PI3K-AKT-mTOR
  downstream pathways, resulting in increased proliferation, survival, migration,
  and angiogenesis. EGFR TKIs inhibit this activation; however, due to mutations (primary
  L858R and secondary T790M mutations), tumor cells acquire resistance against these
  TKIs, activating these pathways further. Hypoxia also induces upregulation of VEGF.
  Upregulation of VEGF, VEGFR-2, and NP-1/2 may also lead to activation of the downstream
  pathways mentioned above, causing TKI resistance in NSCLC.

    In TKI-resistant NSCLC cells activated EGFR leads to activation of the MAPK, FAK-Paxillin,
    and PI3K-AKT-mTOR downstream pathways, resulting in increased proliferation, survival,
    migration, and angiogenesis. EGFR TKIs inhibit this activation; however, due to

    against these TKIs, activating these pathways further. Hypoxia also induces upregulation
    of VEGF. Upregulation of VEGF, VEGFR-2, and NP-1/2 may also lead to activation
    of the downstream pathways mentioned above, causing TKI resistance in NSCLC.
