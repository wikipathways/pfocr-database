caption: a) The known branched pathway from pyruvate to L-valine in KEGG. cr1, cr2
  are two sub-branched pathways in this known pathway. b) The found pathway of BPAT-M.
  c) The found pathway of BPAT-S. d) The found pathway of Retrace. e) The found pathway
  of BPFinder. dr1, dr2, dr3 are three sub-branched pathways in the found pathway
  of BPFinder. The compounds circled with dashed ellipses are the branched compounds
  in the pathways. In the found pathways, the reactions that appear with the same
  substrates and products in the known pathway are drawn in green. The conserved atom
  groups from pyruvate in the branched compounds are drawn in red in the dashed rectangles.
