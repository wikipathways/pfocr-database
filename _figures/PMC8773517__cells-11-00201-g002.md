caption: Mechanisms of oxysterol action in bacterial infections. Several oxysterols
  have host protective roles against bacterial pathogens. (a) In LPS models of infection,
  the anti-inflammatory role of the CH25H/25-OHC axis has been demonstrated in several
  macrophage models. In murine alveolar macrophages, 25-OHC administration led to
  a reduction in inflammation markers (TNFα, IL-6) though mechanisms yet to be elucidated.
  In BMDMs, 25-OHC represses cholesterol production by preventing SREBP2 translocation
  to the nucleus, preventing cholesterol-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and the
  subsequent downstream inflammatory response. (b) 25-OHC prevents the bacterial entry
  of Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri through the ACAT-dependent remodeling
  of cholesterol on cell membranes. In addition, CH25H/25-OHC protects against CDCs-induced
  pore damage by similar mechanisms, preventing CDCs from binding to cell membranes.
  (c) In Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, the GPR183/7α,25-OHC axis negatively
  regulates the type I IFN pathway and promotes autophagy, limiting mycobacterial
  growth in primary human monocytes. In addition, in human macrophages (THP-1s and
  monocyte-derived macrophages) Mtb-induced IL-36 facilitates the production of 25-OHC
  and 27-OHC, which inhibits cholesterol synthesis by activating LXR downstream.
