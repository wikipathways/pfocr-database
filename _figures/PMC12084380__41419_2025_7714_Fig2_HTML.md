caption: Under physiological conditions, fresh neutrophils are released from bone
  marrow, and the gene Bmal1 regulates CXCR2-dependent diurnal aging. Then, senescent
  neutrophils with high CXCR4 and low CD62L expression return to bone marrow and are
  engulfed by macrophages. However, during sepsis, gut microbiota can induce accelerated
  aging of neutrophils via TLRs-mediated Mdy88 pathways. And aged neutrophils exhibit
  functional alterations accordingly. Firstly, these cells are equipped with enhance
  chemotactic capacity due to the higher expression levels of β integrin via p38 MAPK
  activation. However, neutrophils with senescent phenotype are also reported to exhibit
  inaccurate migration, namely rTEM, which is induced by endothelial cell-derived
  EVs. Therefore, the chemotactic capacity of aged neutrophils needs further investigation.
  Secondly, aged neutrophils exhibit a higher phagocytic potential due to the enhanced
  expression levels of phagocytosis receptor Mac-1. Thirdly, they show greater capacity
  of releasing NETs via activation of NOX. Moreover, eCIRP, DAMPs released during
  sepsis, can induce APANs (CXCR4+CD62L–CD40+CD86+MHCII+). This subgroup of neutrophils
  can release high levels of IL-12 and present antigen to CD4+ T cells, which further
  induce Th1 polarization and the release of IFN-γ. IFN-γ released from T cells could
  ultimately induced NETosis (shown in the red zoomed-in section). Additionally, eCIRP
  upregulates SerpinB2 by combining with TLR4 on neutrophils and further suppresses
  caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. LPS is reported to induce premature aging of macrophages
  via the NAD+ imbalance. As shown in the red zoomed-in section, LPS can upregulate
  PRAPs and CD38 (increase NAD+ consumption), and downregulate QPRT (limit NAD+ synthesis),
  both of which contribute to NAD+ imbalance and induce macrophages to exhibit SASP.
  Moreover, LPS upregulates BRD4 via activation of NF-κB in macrophages, and enhances
  the release of inflammatory factors. Bacteria are reported to induce premature aging
  of T cells via DNA damage. As shown in the red zoomed-in section, CDT from bacteria
  can induce SASP in T cells via DNA damage, since DNA damage will induce cell cycle
  arrest and promote release of inflammatory cytokines via ATM-p38 axis. Moreover,
  cutaneous L. braziliensis can downregulate hTERT and impair DNA structure, which
  might also induce SASP in T cells. Mature CD163+CD14+ DCs increase in sepsis patients
  and might contribute to the excessive release of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6.
