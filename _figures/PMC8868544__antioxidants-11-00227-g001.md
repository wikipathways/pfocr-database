caption: AHR and NRF2 in xenobiotic detoxification. (a) The AHR signaling pathway.
  In the absence of a ligand, AHR forms a complex with HSP90, p23 and XAP2 in the
  cytoplasm. Upon binding of ligands such as PAHs or dioxins, AHR translocates into
  the nucleus and forms a heterodimer with ARNT. The AHR-ARNT heterodimer binds to
  XRE in regulatory regions of target genes, which mainly encode phase I detoxification
  enzymes. (b) The KEAP1-NRF2 system. Under physiological conditions, KEAP1 binds
  and ubiquitinates NRF2 in the cytoplasm and promotes the degradation of NRF2 through
  the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Upon exposure to oxidative or electrophilic stresses,
  reactive cysteine residues of KEAP1 are modified, which leads to dysfunction of
  the ubiquitin ligase activity of KEAP1. Under this condition, newly made NRF2 escapes
  from KEAP1, translocates into the nucleus and forms a heterodimer with sMAF. The
  NRF2-sMAF heterodimer binds to CsMBE (also known as ARE or EpRE) in the regulatory
  regions of target genes, which mainly encode phase II detoxication enzymes and phase
  III transporters. (c) Xenobiotic detoxification. Xenobiotic detoxification consists
  of three phases. The phase I detoxication reaction involves oxidation or reduction
  of hydrophobic xenobiotics. The phase II detoxification reaction involves conjugation
  of the hydrophilic moiety by transferases to phase I metabolites, leading to the
  transformation of hydrophobic xenobiotics into water-soluble molecules. In the phase
  III reaction, the conjugated metabolites are eliminated from the cells through MRPs.
