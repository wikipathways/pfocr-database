caption: The role of nitric oxide (NO) as a mediator of cancer phenotype has led researchers
  to investigate strategies for manipulating in vivo production and exogenous delivery
  of this molecule for therapeutic gain. Unfortunately, NO· serves multiple functions
  in cancer physiology. In some instances, NO or nitric oxide synthase (NOS) levels
  correlate with tumor suppression and in other cases they are related to tumor progression
  and metastasis. Understanding this dichotomy has been a great challenge for researchers
  working in the field of NO· and cancer therapy. Due to the unique chemical and biochemical
  properties of NO·, it’s interactions with cellular targets and the subsequent downstream
  signaling events can be vastly different based upon tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment.
  Simple explanations for the vast range of NO-correlated behaviors will continue
  to produce conflicting information about the relevance of NO· and cancer. Information
  on the relationship between neuronal NOS (nNOS) and cancer is scarce. One study
  examined 29 patients with grades II – IV astrocytoma and performed IHC staining
  for nNOS on surgically removed tumors. They found an increase in both distribution
  and intensity of staining with increasing grade of the disease (). No functional
  information was pursued in these studies. An earlier study found an increase in
  IHC staining of nNOS in grade III and IV gliomas compared to grades I and II. When
  they attempted to perform NOS activity assays, however, they could not detect increased
  NOS activity despite the IHC results(). It is possible that nNOS expression correlates
  with increased metastasis in some cases, but overall the data on nNOS and cancer
  are thin and inconclusive. The pathway deciphered in this study involving is shown
  in .
