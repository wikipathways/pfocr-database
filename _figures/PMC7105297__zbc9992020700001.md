caption: 'Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen for positive regulators of SL biosynthesis.
  A, schematic showing SL biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of Gb3. Genes
  required for the pathway are shown in green. B, cell viabilities of WT HeLa cells
  (control) and SPTLC1 KO HeLa cells with or without Shiga toxin (2 ng/ml) treatment
  for 72 h. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. (error bars) (n = 3). C, representative
  immunoblot analysis of SPTLC1 protein expression in WT (control) and SPTLC1 KO HeLa
  cells. β-Actin was used as a loading control. D, flow cytometry analysis of WT (control)
  and SPTLC1 KO HeLa cells stained with anti-CD77 antibody. Left, representative dot
  plot of cell-surface expression of Gb3. Right, quantification of Gb3 expression
  (mean ± S.D.; n = 3). Unpaired t test was used: **, p ≤ 0.01; ***, p ≤ 0.001. E,
  schematic representation of the genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening strategy undertaken
  to identify genes required for Shiga toxin resistance in HeLa cells. F, scatterplot
  showing the ranking of positively selected genes from MAGeCK analysis. The x axis
  indicates positive ranking of individual genes, and the y axis indicates −log10
  values of corresponding robust ranking aggregation (RRA) score. The 20 top-ranking
  genes are highlighted and labeled. Inset, scatterplot showing log -fold change for
  all of the genes. Genes involved in the SL biosynthetic pathway that show positive
  log -fold change in the toxin-resistant group are highlighted in green. AHR is highlighted
  in red.'
