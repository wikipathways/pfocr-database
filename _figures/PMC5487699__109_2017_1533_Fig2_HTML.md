caption: 'Regulation and execution of the autophagosomal-lysosomal degradation pathway.
  Two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems are involved in the regulation of autophagy.
  ATG12, a ubiquitin-like protein, is covalently bound to ATG5 by the E1 and E2 enzymes
  ATG7 and ATG10, respectively. In parallel, LC3 is cleaved by ATG4, primed by the
  E1 and E2 enzymes ATG7 and ATG3 to be covalently linked to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) by the E3 ligase complex ATG12/5/16 to generate the processed, lipid-bound
  form of LC3, LC3-II. LC3-II and the ATG12/5/16 complex act together in the elongation
  and finally closure of the phagophore. LC3-II also acts as anchor on the inner membrane
  for adaptor proteins such as p62 that recognize ubiquitinated substrates, e.g.,
  misfolded proteins or damaged organelles. On aged or dysfunctional mitochondria,
  PINK1 localizes to the outer membrane, where it is recognized and ubiquitinated
  by the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin. Ubiquitinated PINK1 recruits autophagy receptors
  such as p62 and renders the mitochondria attractive for degradation by autophagy
  (“mitophagy”). After closure, the autophagosome with its cargo is primed for fusion
  with lysosomes, which is accompanied by removal and recycling of LC3-II by ATG4.
  The resulting autolysosome degrades the cargo and releases the components (amino
  acids, lipids) for metabolic and energy consuming processes. Substrates selected
  for lysosomal degradation by the signal sequence KFERQ can reach their destination
  also by binding to the chaperone HSC70 and LAMP2A-mediated direct import into the
  lysosomal lumen (chaperone-mediated autophagy; CMA). The kinase LRRK2 is involved
  in regulation of CMA and mitophagy, the latter via direct interaction with parkin.
