caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed mechanisms by which IS improves the
  sensitivity of cancer cells to cisplatin. IS combined with cisplatin induced ER
  stress by activating the three branches of UPR signalling and the downstream PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP
  pathway, which ultimately enhanced the apoptosis of the cells.
