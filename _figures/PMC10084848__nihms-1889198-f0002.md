caption: A) Model for SARM1 activity in axon degeneration. As NMNAT2 levels fall,
  NMN levels increase concomitantly with decreases in NAD+ levels. Changes in the
  concentrations of these metabolites activate SARM1. Activation correlates with a
  phase transition to a higher ordered oligomer. NAD+ levels decrease further as SARM1
  cleaves NAD+ to nicotinamide, ADPR, and cADPR. The generation of (c)ADPR triggers
  calcium influx, which in turn activates calpains. The axonal cytoskeleton is subsequently
  degraded by calpains, resulting in the characteristic axonal fragmentation of Wallerian-like
  degeneration. B) Model for SARM1 activity in intestinal immunity. Under conditions
  of low cholesterol, TIR-1/SARM1 undergoes a phase transition that results in the
  activation of the p38/PMK-1 MAPK pathway and the expression of immune response genes.
  Activation of this pathway when environmental sterols are scarce, “preactivates”
  the immune response so the C. elegans may respond more effectively to pathogens.
