caption: Biochemical and structural similarity network displaying metabolic differences
  between SAT and VAT. Network nodes representing metabolites (shape displaying the
  biochemical domain) are connected based on biochemical (precursor to product, blue
  lines) or structural similarity (Tanimoto > 0.07, gray lines) or complex lipid class–specific
  relations (gray lines). The direction of the metabolic differences in VAT relative
  to SAT tissue (green, lower in VAT; red, higher in VAT, gray; inconclusive or FDR-adjusted
  P ≥ 0.05) is defined based on the number of matched samples (≥30) displaying the
  trend. The multivariate importance of the metabolomic differences for discriminating
  between VAT and SAT tissues is displayed based on the color brightness, which encodes
  the quartile for the partial least squares discriminant analysis VIP, with thick
  black borders displaying species with the top 5% VIP values. Node size is proportional
  to the number of higher/lower pairs (30 times out of 59 pairs lower/higher = small
  size, 59 times or 0 times higher/lower = big size). Cer, ceramide; DG, diacylglycerol;
  FDR, false discovery rate; MG, monoacylglycerol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine;
  SAT, subcutaneous adipose tissue; SM, sphingomyelin; TG, triacylglycerol; VAT, visceral
  adipose tissue; VIP, variable importance in projection.
