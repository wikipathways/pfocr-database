caption: Epithelial cell cycle arrest in G2/M and epigenetic changes in fibroblasts
  coordinately promote kidney fibrosis. After acute kidney injury, damaged epithelial
  cells initiate a wound-healing program. When the injury is of short duration (left),
  epithelial cells located near the lesion secrete modest amounts of TGF-β1, which
  induces fibroblast proliferation and secretion of extracellular matrix components
  such as collagen I. Epithelial cells also activate the cell cycle and begin to proliferate.
  In the absence of TGF-β1 and other profibrotic mediators, fibroblasts quickly return
  to the resting state, undergo apoptosis or both, whereas epithelial cells expand
  in number and quickly repair the site of tissue damage. In cases where the kidney
  injury is persistent or repeated (right), increasing numbers of epithelial cells
  stall between the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle, which stimulates the production
  of considerable amounts of TGF-β1. If the cell cycle is reactivated, TGF-β1 production
  decreases, and normal wound repair commences once again. However, if the epithelial
  cell cycle is arrested for an extended length of time, TGF-β1 production persists
  and contributes to downstream epigenetic modifications in fibroblasts that slowly
  transform these cells into activated myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts proliferate
  and secrete collagen in a progressively growth factor–independent manner. Although
  a variety of genetic modifications take place in fibroblasts at this stage, the
  gene encoding RASAL1 seems to become hypermethylated by the methytransferase Dnmt1.
  This epigenetic modification turns down RASAL1 expression leading to persistent
  Ras activation, perpetual fibroblast proliferation and fibrogenesis in the kidney.
  Epigenetic changes, such as RASAL1 methylation, are stable modifications that can
  be inherited through multiple cell divisions. This pathway shows how normal kidney
  repair mechanisms can quickly transform into pathogenic fibrotic responses.
