caption: Metabolic flux distribution around the 1,3-PDO-producing pathway. a Estimated
  data on strain TA2984 (parental strain for 1,3-PDO production) from experimental
  data of Fig. . b Simulation data on NDH-1 elimination based on the MOMA algorithm.
  Arrows and their thickness represent reactions and the scale of flux, respectively.
  The tilted values near arrows represent estimated flux [mmol/(g DCW)/h]
