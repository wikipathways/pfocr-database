caption: Cysteine-specific S-nitrosation of thioredoxin. Thioredoxin functions as
  a cellular reductant, shuttling between rTrx with a dithiol at the active site and
  oTrx with the formation of an active site disulfide. rTrx selectively reacts with
  GSNO at amino acid position C62, and the reaction proceeds more quickly than the
  selective reaction of oTrx at amino acid position C73. Transnitrosation between
  rTrx-C62-SNO and rTrx to form rTrx-C73-SNO was observed (pathway A). Although the
  physiological significance of the reaction is not clear, it possibly plays a role
  at locally high Trx concentrations. Different nitrosated forms of Trx may engage
  different protein partners, thereby directing different signaling pathways (B and
  C).
