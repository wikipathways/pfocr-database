caption: Influence of SNPs in the TCF7L2 gene in response to treatment with SU derivatives,
  GLP1-RA and DPP-4 inhibitors. In the pancreatic β-cell, GLP-1 phosphorylates β-catenin
  via cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). This avoids the degradation of the β-catenin
  that subsequently accumulates, enters the nucleus and forms the transcription factors
  β-catenin/TCF. This leads to activation of genes such as Isl-1 and Axin2. Overall,
  this pathway results in pro-insulin processing, β-cell protection from IL-1β and
  interferon-γ-mediated apoptosis, stimulation of β-cell proliferation and glucose/GLP-1-stimulated
  insulin secretion. Patients with TCF7L2 gene variants have impaired TCF7L2 expression
  in pancreatic β-cells resulting in reduced insulin secretion and impaired response
  to incretins (GLP1-RA, DDP-4 inhibitors). The abnormal response to GLP1-RA and DPP-4
  inhibitors is likely to depend on the direct effect of TCF7L2 on PKA.
