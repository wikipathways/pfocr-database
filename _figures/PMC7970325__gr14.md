caption: Statistically significantly enriched gene ontology (GO) molecular processes
  (GO-terms) identified for 871 differential genes between radioiodine resistant cancers
  and other thyroid cancer samples. Differential gene names are shown in red. Circle
  size inversely reflects FDR-adjusted p-value for a differential GO-term identified.
  Filled part of a circle represents percentage share of matched differential genes
  in gene set of the respective GO-term. Links between the terms are taken from the
  STRING database.
