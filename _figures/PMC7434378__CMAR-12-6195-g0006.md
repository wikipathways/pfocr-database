caption: The mechanism of fucoidan action. Fucoidan inhibited PI3K leading to the
  reduce of phosphorylated Akt. On one hand, phosphorylated Akt inhibits the expression
  of the CDK inhibitor P21 to cause cell cycle arrest. On the other hand, the expression
  of Bax was up-regulated by fucoidan to promote the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis
  of cancer cells.
