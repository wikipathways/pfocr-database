caption: Processing of CD8 ppCT T-cell epitopes. The ppCT signal peptide has a type
  II orientation (the NH2-terminal region exposed toward the cytosol and the COOH-terminal
  region facing the endoplasmic reticulum lumen). The ppCT16−25 epitope is processed
  by SP and SPP independently of TAP, and is released directly into the endoplasmic
  reticulum (left). After cleavage by SP and SPP, a ppCT1−17 signal peptide fragment
  is released into the cytoplasm, to be processed by the proteasome/TAP pathway so
  as to give rise to the ppCT9−17 epitope. The ppCT9−17 epitope may also be generated
  from a ppCT1−17 signal peptide fragment by cytosolic proteases before transport
  into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen by TAP (middle). ppCT50−59 and ppCT91−100 epitopes
  are generated by the TAP/proteasome pathway after retrotranslocation of the pCT
  precursor protein from the endoplasmic reticulum lumen into the cytosol by the ERAD
  pathway (right). All generated ppCT epitopes bind within the endoplasmic reticulum
  to HLA-A2 molecules before externalization to the target cell membrane for recognition
  and elimination by specific CD8 T lymphocytes. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MHC-I,
  MHC-class I; Ub, ubiquitin.
