caption: Plasmalogen-Biosynthesis Pathway and Associated PhenotypesPlasmalogen synthesis
  is a multistep process that involves several enzymes. On the luminal side of the
  peroxisomal membrane, GNPAT acylates DHAP (dihydroxyacetone phosphate) at its sn-1
  position. Then, AGPS is transported into the peroxisome by PEX7 and uses the 1-acyl-DHAP
  and the fatty alcohols, which are supplied by FAR1, as substrates and exchanges
  the acyl group for an alkyl group. The resulting 1-o-alkyl DHAP is then reduced
  to GPA (1-O-alkyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycerophosphate) by an acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase,
  which is located in both peroxisomal and ER membranes. Further processing is similar
  to the processing of diacyl glycerophospholipids and takes place in the ER. Mutations
  in GNPAT and AGPS cause a block in plasmalogen synthesis and lead to an accumulation
  of fatty alcohols that are no longer processed. Affected individuals develop RCDP.
  Mutations in PEX7 lead to an absence of peroxisomal AGPS and thus have similar effects
  on plasmalogen biosynthesis. In individuals V-1 and V-2 from family A and II-1 from
  family B, fatty acids are no longer metabolized to fatty alcohols by FAR1, likewise
  leading to a decrease in plasmalogen levels and an overlapping phenotype.
