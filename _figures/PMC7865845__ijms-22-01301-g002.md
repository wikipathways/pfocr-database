caption: 'Schematic representation of the role of the discussed NLRs in type I interferon
  signaling. The key viral sensing pathway components leading to type I interferon
  production are shown in the white boxes, and the interferon signal transduction
  pathways are depicted in bold lines in a schematically depicted cell. Cooperation
  and interference of NLRs are shown. Green: NLRs with enhancing activity, yellow:
  NLRs leading to reduced interferon (IFN) response due to degradation of key components,
  red: Inhibition of signaling by steric hindrance, orange: Negative regulation by
  unknown mechanism. Cooperating factors for viral RNA sensing by NLRs are shown in
  blue.'
