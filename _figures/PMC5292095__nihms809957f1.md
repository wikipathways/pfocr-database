caption: UDP-GlcNAc is synthesized from glucose via the hexose biosynthetic pathway
  (HBP), which also requires glutamine, acetyl-CoA and uridine from protein, lipid,
  and nucleotide metabolism respectively. Attachment of O-GlcNAc to proteins is catalyzed
  by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), and the removal catalyzed by O-GlcNAcase (OGA).
