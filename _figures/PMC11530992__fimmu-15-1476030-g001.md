caption: Canonical pathway and non-canonical pathway of NF-κB signaling pathway. The
  canonical NF-κB signaling pathway is initiated by various extracellular stimuli
  through different receptors, including TLRs, PRRs, TNFRs, GPCRs, TCRs, and BCRs.
  This activation occurs through the CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex and TAK1, leading
  to the phosphorylation and activation of the IKK complex (comprising IKKγ(NEMO),
  IKKα, and IKKβ) specifically through the phosphorylation of IKKβ. The activated
  IKK complex then phosphorylates members of the inhibitor of κB (IκB) family, such
  as IκBα, targeting them for ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent degradation in the proteasome.
  This degradation process releases the Rel-A/p50 or c-Rel/p50 or p50/p50(only Rel-A/50
  is shown in Figure 1), which translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription.
  In contrast, the non-canonical pathway is activated by the members of TNFR superfamily
  (such as CD40, LTβR and RANK), which specifically engage NIK. NIK then phosphorylates
  IKKα, leading to the phosphorylation of p100 on its carboxy-terminal serine residues.
  The phosphorylated p100 undergoes partial degradation to p52, which then associates
  with REL-B and translocates to the nucleus to participate in transcription events.
