caption: Oxidized lipids and cholesterol affect MSC differentiation. Oxidized lipids
  bind to and activate the PPARγ/C/EBP signaling pathway, promoting adipocyte differentiation,
  leading to fat accumulation. It also activates the EGF/MAPK pathway in MSCs and
  inhibits osteoblast differentiation. Cholesterol activates the BMP/TGF-β pathway
  and increases serum sclerostin levels, which leads to down-regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. Low activity of the Wnt pathway down-regulates Runx2 expression, thereby
  inhibiting osteogenic differentiation. The low-activity Wnt pathway also up-regulates
  PPARγ and C/EBPα to enhance adipocyte differentiation. MSCs, mesenchymal stem cells;
  PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer binding
  protein; EGF, epidermal-like growth factors; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; Runx2, runt-related
  transcription factor 2.
