caption: 'Overview of molecular pathways of oxidative stress and potential points
  of intervention in T cells in SLE. Upstream of oxidative stress, exposure to NO
  and/or depletion of glutathione generates ROI, which cause MHP, mitochondrial biogenesis
  and oxidative stress. In addition to biogenesis, an increase in the number of T-cell
  mitochondria in SLE has also been attributed to reduced mitophagy. NADPH is generated
  by the pentose phosphate pathway and is required both to generate NO and to regenerate
  glutathione. The glutathione precursor NAC is thought to work upstream of oxidative
  stress by replenishing glutathione and preventing MHP. mTOR is a sensor of MHP but
  precisely how it is activated by oxidative stress, and thus how NAC prevents its
  activation, is currently unclear. Downstream of oxidative stress, mTOR activates
  Rab4A and associated endocytic recycling of CD3ζ. These changes alter intracellular
  signal transduction and T-cell lineage specification, causing contraction of TH1-cell,
  TREG-cell and CD8+ T-cell subsets, and expansion of TH2-cell, TH17-cell and CD4−CD8−
  T-cell subsets., Rapamycin prevents the activation of mTOR without affecting oxidative
  stress. Abbreviations: FcεRIγ, high affinity immunoglobulin ε receptor subunit β,
  γ chain; MHP, mitochondrial hyperpolarization; mTOR, serine/threonine-protein kinase
  mTOR; ROI, reactive oxygen intermediates; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; TREG
  cell, regulatory T cell.'
