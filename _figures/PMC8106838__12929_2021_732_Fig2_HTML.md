  of human skin. The epidermis is the thinnest and most superficial layer of the skin,
  it is connected to the underlying dermis through the cutaneous basement membrane
  zone (BMZ), the highly specialized structure which connects the epidermis to the
  dermis ensuring skin integrity and stability against mechanical insults. Epidermis
  is arranged into four distinct layers: basal, spinous, granular and stratum corneum
  (or horny layer). The deepest layer of the epidermis, overlaying the BMZ, is the
  basal layer which is followed by the spinous and the granular layers whilst the
  stratum corneum is the outermost. Each layer is typified by keratinocytes (KCs)
  at various stages of differentiation. KCs of the basal layer are characterized by
  their ability to proliferate. Indeed, in the basal layer, epidermal stem cells (SCs)
  divide to self-renew and produce transient amplifying cells (also known as committed
  progenitors—CPs), which possess a more limited proliferation capability. In the
  early phases of differentiation, CPs detach from the BMZ and move toward the stratum
  corneum becoming terminally differentiated cells (TDs) devoid of nuclei. (Right
