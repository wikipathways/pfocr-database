caption: Schematic of GDF11 signaling in human liver cancer. GDF11 first binds to
  ActRIIB to recruit the type I ALK receptors ALK4, ALK5 and ALK7. The downstream
  pathways of GDF11 binding to its receptors include Smad and non-Smad pathways. The
  Smad pathway is the canonical signaling for transforming growth factor-β superfamily
  members. GDF11 first activates receptor Smads, including Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8 signals.
  After phosphorylation, the receptor Smads are released from the receptor and recruit
  the common Smad4 to form a complex, which then migrates into the nucleus and activates
  the transcription of specific target genes that have a role in liver cancer. GDF11,
  growth differentiation factor 11; p, phosphate; ActRIIB, activin receptor type IIB;
  ALK, activin receptor-like kinase.
