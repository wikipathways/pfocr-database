caption: Mutations of E3 ubiquitin ligase components cullin 3 (CUL3) and kelch-like
  3 (KLHL3) were identified to cause Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII) with
  increased WNK1 and WNK4 abundance in kidney. Gene mutations in WNK1 and WNK4 also
  cause PHAII with compromised cell volume homeostasis. In addition, osmotic stress
  can trigger WNK-SPAK/OSR1 complex activation, which leads to downstream phosphorylation
  of CCCs, especially stimulatory phosphorylation of NKCC1 and inhibitory phosphorylation
  of KCCs. Overstimulation of NKCC1 increases cytotoxic edema, enlarges infarction,
  and worsens neurobehavioral function in ischemic stroke. Hyperactive NKCC1 increases
  CSF secretion by the choroid plexus epithelium and causes post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus
  after intraventricular hemorrhage. On the other hand, phosphorylation of KCC2 by
  WNK-SPAK/OSR1 decreases its Cl- efflux and reduces GABA-mediated inhibition of spinal
  nerve transmission and causes neuropathic pain. To date, no direct evidence links
  oxidative stress or inflammation to WNK activation in the nervous system. However,
  oxidative stress can directly activate SPAK/OSR1, which in turn regulates WNK activity,
  thus indirectly activates WNK; inflammation-induced stimulation of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1
  pathway could also increase WNK activity. Dysfunction of KCC3, such as via KCC3
  mutation, leads to compromised cell volume homeostasis and causes hereditary motor
  and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum (HMSN/ACC), hearing
  loss and a reduced threshold for seizure. Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy
  type II (HSANII) caused by HSN2 gene mutations leads to a loss-of-function for WNK1
  activity. Taken together, the WNK-SPAK/OSR1-CCC signaling pathway emerges as a new
  therapeutic target for nervous and non-nervous system disorders.
