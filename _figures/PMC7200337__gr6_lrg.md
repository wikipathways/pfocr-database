caption: Available Therapeutic Options to Manage COVID-19 Immunopathology and to Deter
  Viral Propagation(A) Rdrp inhibitors (remdesivir, favipiravir), protease inhibitors
  (lopinavir/ritonavir), and antifusion inhibitors (arbidol) are currently being investigated
  in their efficacy in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections.(B) CQ and HCQ increase the
  pH within lysosomes, impairing viral transit through the endolysosomal pathway.
  Reduced proteolytic function within lysosomes augments antigen processing for presentation
  on MHC complexes and increases CTLA4 expression on Tregs.(C) Antagonism of IL-6
  signaling pathway and of other cytokine-/chemokine-associated targets has been proposed
  to control COVID-19 CRS. These include secreted factors like GM-CSF that contribute
  to the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages.(D) Several potential
  sources of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies are currently under investigation,
  including monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma
  from recovered COVID-19 patients.GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor; CQ, chloroquine; HCQ, hydroxychloroquine; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
