caption: Proposed model for CA utilization and response in P. luminescens. PAL converts
  phenylalanine to CA. CA is then processed via the ST biosynthetic pathway (encircled
  question mark) and via a catabolic pathway involving homologs of the Hca and Mhp
  enzymes. Final products (bold question mark) of the latter pathway are unknown.
  CA also induces its own synthesis by inducing the expression of stlA, coding for
  PAL via an unknown regulator (encircled question mark). CA also induces its catabolism
  by inducing the expression of the hca operon and the plu2201 and plu2202 genes,
  coding for the Hca and Mhp homologs. This induction requires the HcaR regulator.
