  group, suggesting that the abnormal expression of exosome miR-30a-3p derived from
  osteoclasts may be involved in the Pb-exposed group

caption: After Pb treatment, miR-30a-3p was up-regulated in OCs. In cell-to-cell communication,
  Exos-packaged miR-3 0 a-3p secreted from OCs regulates the expression of NF-κβ1
  and activates the caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway in OBs stimulating pyroptosis.
  Meanwhile, the inflammasomes IL-1β and IL-18 released from OBs promote the proliferation
  of OCs. Thus, the homeostasis between bone resorption in OCs and bone formation
  in OBs is destroyed, which affects the bone remodeling process and induces osteoporosis
