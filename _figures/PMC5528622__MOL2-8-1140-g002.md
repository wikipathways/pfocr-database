caption: 'The RAS‐RAF‐MEK‐ERK pathway: a therapeutic target in melanoma. A. In normal
  cells. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are activated by binding of their ligands,
  and they initiate growth signals through activation of various pathways including
  the RAS‐RAF‐MEK‐ERK MAPK pathway. B. In melanoma cells, the RAS‐RAF‐MEK‐ERK pathway
  is hyper activated through several mechanisms, including activating mutations in
  RAS (20% of cases) and BRAF (∼50% of cases), making the cells independent of the
  RTKs (dotted circles). Constitutively active RAS or BRAF cause sustained activation
  of MEK, which in turn activates ERK. Activated ERK regulates many cellular processes
  that are required for cell proliferation and survival. Selective inhibitors of BRAF,
  MEK and ERK have been developed to inhibit this hyper‐activated pathway at different
  steps. * indicates a mutation.'
