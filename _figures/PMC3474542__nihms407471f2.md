caption: Nongenomic and genomic estrogen signaling pathways. Endogenous estrogens
  including 17β-estradiol (E2) are nonselective activators of the three known estrogen
  receptors (ERs), ERα, ERβ and GPER. E2 activates nuclear ERs, inducing receptor
  dimerization, and binding of receptor dimers to the promoters of target genes. Alternatively,
  activated ERs modulate the function of other classes of transcription factors (TF)
  through protein–protein interactions. Subpopulations of ERs at the plasma membrane
  (mER) activated by E2 interact with adaptor proteins (adaptor) and signaling molecules
  such as c-Src, which mediates rapid signaling via PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways. E2,
  or selective agonists such as G-1, or SERDs such as fulvestrant, or SERMs such as
  tamoxifen, also activate GPER, which is predominantly localized intracellularly.
  GPER activation stimulates cAMP production, calcium mobilization and c-Src, which
  activates matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). MMPs cleave pro-heparin-binding-epidermal
  growth factor (HB-EGF), releasing free HB-EGF that transactivates EGF receptors
  (EGFR). EGFR in turn activates MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathway, which can induce rapid
  (nongenomic) effects (X), or genomic effects regulating gene transcription. E2-mediated
  transcriptional regulation may involve phosphorylation (P) of ER or other TFs that
  may directly interact with ER, or bind independently of ER within the promoters
  of target genes.
