caption: The links are defined by the LinkDB function from the KEGG website. The top
  ten over-represented pathways from the GWAS and expression studies () plus the top
  twenty over-represented pathways from the meta-analysis () are shown. The insulin
  signaling pathway, linking the MAPK signaling with the starch and sucrose metabolism,
  is also shown. Three pathways (drug metabolism - cytochrome P450, heparan sulfate
  biosynthesis and type 1 diabetes mellitus shown with gray thatched background) did
  not cross talk with the other top pathways over-represented in this study. The pathway's
  rank in the meta-analysis is provided in parenthesis. The pathways unique to the
  GWAS PD study are green, those unique to the expression PD study are pink and the
  pathways common to both expression and GWAS PD studies are yellow.
