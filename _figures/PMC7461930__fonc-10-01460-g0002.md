caption: 'Fighting cancer via p53 pathway can be implemented at all levels: cell,
  protein, and gene. (A) Cancer cells carrying mutant p53 can be targeted with immunotherapy
  using mutant p53-specific TILs or TCR-T cells. (B) At the protein level the DNA-binding
  and transcriptional functions of mutant p53 can be restored using small molecule
  re-activators that stabilize the protein in its active biological conformation.
  (C) At the gene level TP53 mutations can be repaired using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing
  approaches such as HDR, Base editing and Prime editing. HDR, homology directed repair;
  HLA, human leukocyte antigen; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocyte; RT, reverse transcriptase;
  TCR, T cell receptor; TIL, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte.'
