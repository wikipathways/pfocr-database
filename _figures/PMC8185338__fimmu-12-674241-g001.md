caption: 'Different steps of the autophagic pathway targeted by autophagy-modulating
  drugs. A schematic view of the different cell types populating the skin. Vertebrate
  skin is comprised of two major compartments: the epidermis and the dermis. The superficial
  part of the epidermis, known as the stratum corneum, is composed of dead keratinocytes
  and acts as a barrier. The epidermis is composed mainly of keratinocytes with few
  melanocytes. The major immune cells in this compartment include Langerhans cells
  (LCs) and CD8 T-cells. The dermis is composed of fibroblasts, NK cells, T-cells
  (CD4 αβ, and γδ), B cells, dermal dendritic cells, macrophages, mast cells, and
  neutrophils (non-exhaustive list). The knowledge of skin cell autophagy is mainly
  based in studies with dermal macrophages. Briefly, (1) autophagy is inhibited by
  mTOR and activated by AMPK. mTOR is inhibited by the autophagy-initiation signals
  as metabolic stress, ROS, infection and drugs, and leads to the activation of AMPK.
  After AMPK activation, the ULK1 complex (ATG13, ULK1/2, FIP200) initiates the phagophore
  formation (2), involving the targets (pathogens, dead cells, cellular components
  and organelles, protein aggregates), which in turn activates the Class III PI3K
  complex (Beclin 1, VPS34, VPS15, ATG14) (3). This complex completes the autophagosome
  maturation and elongation by forming PI3P in the omegasome membrane and recruiting
  downstream ubiquitin-like conjugation systems that convert LC3-I to LC3-II (4).
  Fully formed autophagosomes then fuse with lysosomes (autolysosomes), degrade the
  sequestered cargo via lysosomal hydrolases and recycle macromolecule components
  (5). Several drugs can interfere with the autophagic pathway by inhibiting or activating
  different parts of the process (see also ). Drugs as rapamycin, resveratrol and
  nitazoxanide, that inhibit mTOR, or carbamazepine, metformin and pyrazinamide, that
  activate AMPK, induce autophagy. Bedaquiline, ambroxol and linezolid increase the
  formation of autophagosomes. Loperamide and valproic acid increase the colocalization
  of LC3-decorated autophagosomes with M. tuberculosis. Ibrutinib and isoniazid facilitate
  the fusion of phagosome and lysosome. Vitamin D3 (1,25D3) induces the expression
  of antimicrobial peptides as cathelicidin and upregulates the expression of Beclin
  1 and ATG5, that are pivotal for the autophagosome formation. On the other hand,
  azithromycin was demonstrated to inhibit the acidification of the autolysosome impairing
  M. abscessus degradation.'
