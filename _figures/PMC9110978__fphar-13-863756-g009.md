caption: The sketch of the mechanism of JNK/Sab signaling pathway involved in mitochondrial
  dysfunction in NASH and the effect of Scoparone. Stimulated by free fatty acids,
  JNK is activated and binds to the outer mitochondrial transmembrane protein Sab,
  which then releases and promotes the activation of SHP-1 in mitochondria. Phosphorylated
  SHP-1 could induce the inactivation of Src, which leads to damage of mitochondrial
  electron transport chain, thereby reducing ATP production and increasing ROS generation.
  The mitochondrial damage in turn stimulates JNK and thus results in sustained activation
  of JNK. Scoparone can reverse this process partly through inhibiting the JNK/Sab
  signaling.
