caption: a The pathway identified in this work shows the enzymatic (for the monocyclic)
  and nonenzymatic (for the mero- and polycyclic) chemical conversions, where 6 is
  the core backbone and AspoA acts as a pathway switch. b The proposed mechanism of
  conversion of 7 or 8 to 2 or 1 via protonation of the C21 carbonyl group under acidic
  conditions and the proposed mechanism of AspoA-catalysed isomerization of 7 or 8
  to 11 or 12 by Glu538-mediated protonation of the C21 carbonyl group.
