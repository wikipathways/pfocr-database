caption: A meta-network of overlapping gene coexpression modules in blood (BLD) and
  brain [prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY), hypothalamus (HYP)] in female (left)
  and male (right) C57BL/6J mice. Each node represents a module of coexpressed genes.
  Nodes are labeled with tissue type and a module number. An edge between two nodes
  indicates a significant overlap of genes between two modules of different tissues.
  Thickness of connecting edges is proportional to the significance of the overlap.
  Module colors represent the direction and magnitude of regulation of CIE-induced
  alcohol dependence based on the significance of the enrichment with differentially
  expressed genes (yellow, upregulation; blue, downregulation in CIE mice; intense
  colors, p < 0.00001; light colors, p < 0.05). Only modules affected by CIE are shown.
  An overlap of a blood module and at least two modules from different brain regions
  indicates a cluster of highly conserved coexpression modules regulated by CIE in
  blood and brain (termed blood-brain modules in the text; represented by rectangular
  boxes in the figure). All overlapping modules within a blood-brain cluster were
  overrepresented with genes from a major biological category. These were the same
  for male and female mice apart from a Fatty Acid Metabolism and PPAR Signaling cluster
  unique to male mice. The top 5 enriched pathways and predicted upstream regulators
  from the IPA analysis for each of the broad categories (rectangular boxes) are reported
  in the text, but examples include GABA and Glutamate Receptor Signaling for the
  Cell-Cell Signaling cluster, Inflammasome Pathway and Th1 Pathway for the Immune
  Response cluster, Protein Ubiquitination Pathway and Oxidative Phosphorylation for
  the Protein Processing / Mitochondrial Function cluster, and Fatty Acid Oxidation
  and PPARA for the Fatty Acid Metabolism and PPAR Signaling cluster. The overlap
  between blood and brain modules was particularly strong for the Cell-Cell Signaling
  clusters in both male and female coexpression networks. The Cell-Cell Signaling
  cluster also contained genes known to play a role in alcohol-related behaviors in
  rodents (e.g., Bdnf, Npy, Gabra1, and Pdyn). Network visualization was performed
  using Cytoscape version 3.8.2.
