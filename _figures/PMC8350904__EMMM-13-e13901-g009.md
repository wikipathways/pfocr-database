caption: Schematic model of the regulation of glycolysis during sequential stages
  of HIV‐1 infection and of its potential therapeutic targeting (created with BioRender).
  Uninfected cells become susceptible to HIV‐1 infection upon activation by upregulating
  a number of metabolic pathways including glycolysis (Valle‐Casuso et al, ). During
  productive HIV‐1 infection, glycolysis is progressively downregulated, a process
  which is in part compensated by reliance on the parallel pentose phosphate pathway.
  Latent HIV‐1 infection can ensue either spontaneously, leading to further glycolysis
  downregulation, or be induced by agents such as dexamethasone (DEXA), which can
  directly inhibit glycolysis. During latency, the pentose phosphate pathway remains
  active and fuels, through NADPH activity, regeneration of the two main antioxidant
  molecules, i.e., Trx and GSH. Reversion to a productively infected state is accompanied
  by partial reactivation of the glycolytic pathway. Blocking Trx and GSH inhibits
  downstream effects of NADPH without restoring glycolytic activity, thus favoring
  death of latently infected cells. TrxR = thioredoxin reductase; GCLC = glutamate‐cysteine
  ligase; GSSG = oxidized GSH.
