caption: A summary of our present research about the metabolomic alteration (PPP)
  in the formation of 3D MCF-7 cells along with culture time (red and blue series
  denote an increase and decrease of intracellular metabolites, respectively) and
  further correlated with our previous findings, both of which revealed that impaired
  PPP communicating with cell signalling pathways through disturbed intracellular
  redox status contributed to MCR in 3D MCF-7 cells.
