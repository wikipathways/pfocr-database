caption: '(A) Chemical structure of curcumin (diferuloylmethane). (B) Chemical structures
  of the natural polyamines spermine, spermidine, and putrescine, the polyamine analogue
  bis(ethyl)norspermine (BENSpm), and the ODC inhibitor difluoromethylornithine (DFMO).
  (C) The mammalian polyamine pathway: ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) converts ornithine
  into putrescine, which acquires sequential aminopropyl groups to form spermidine
  followed by spermine. The aminopropyl group is derived from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine
  (dcSAM), and its addition onto putrescine or spermidine is mediated by spermidine
  and spermine synthases (SRM and SMS, respectively). Two routes exist for spermine
  catabolism: (1) it can be oxidized by spermine oxidase (SMOX) to produce spermidine,
  which is accompanied by H2O2 and aldehyde generation, or (2) it can undergo acetylation
  by spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT). Acetylated spermine is either
  exported from the cell or oxidized back to spermidine by peroxisomal N1-acetylpolyamine
  oxidase (PAOX). Spermidine also undergoes this 2-step acetylation/oxidation back
  to putrescine via an N1-acetylspermidine intermediate.'
