caption: a | Protein biosynthesis. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site for
  the biosynthesis of membrane and luminal proteins that function in the ER and in
  the classical secretory pathway, as well as for the biosynthesis of secreted proteins.
  In this process, a nascent polypeptide client is co-translationally translocated
  through the SEC61 translocon into the lumen of the ER (for luminal proteins) or
  laterally into the ER bilayer (for membrane proteins). The client protein then undergoes
  post-translational modifications to assist in its folding and assembly — tasks that
  are carried out by dedicated ER-localized enzymes or chaperones (oligosaccharyl
  transferase (OST), protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family members and binding
  immunoglobulin protein (BiP)). b | Protein secretion. After folding and assembly,
  the client is packaged into a coat protein complex II (COPII)-coated vesicle that
  buds out of the ER. The client protein is transported through the classical secretory
  pathway en route to other cellular destinations or to the cell surface for secretion.
  c | Unfolded protein response (UPR). When a client protein misfolds or misassembles,
  it triggers the UPR, which stimulates a stress signalling cascade (through the activation
  of ER membrane sensors) that is intended to rectify the misfolding of proteins.
  d | ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Despite this effort to rectify protein misfolding,
  if the client remains terminally misfolded, it is then subjected to degradation
  by a process known as ERAD. During ERAD, a misfolded substrate is processed and
  retro-translocated into the cytosol for proteasome-mediated degradation. e | Calcium
  homeostasis. The ER also stores Ca2+ and controls its homeostasis — a process that
  is regulated by different calcium channels and pumps in the ER membrane that directly
  communicate with calcium channels in the plasma membrane. f | Lipid biogenesis.
  The ER is also the centre for lipid biogenesis, in which different lipid biosynthetic
  enzymes that are embedded and/or associated with the ER membrane generate lipids
  (sphingolipids, phospholipids and sterols) that are used for structural or signalling
  purposes. SH, sulfhydryl group.
