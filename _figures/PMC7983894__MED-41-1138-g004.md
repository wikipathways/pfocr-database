caption: Source of ROS. Accumulation of ROS can be generated by either excessive formation
  or inadequate scavenging. Environmental stimuli like UV, trauma, pregnancy, stress,
  and vaccination promote ROS formation. External phenols including monobenzone, hydroquinone
  and 4‐TBP also give rise to ROS as known. Melanin biosynthesis and energy metabolism
  in mitochondria physically yield ROS. Neighboring keratinocytes also reportedly
  transfer ROS to melanocytes. With respect to inadequate scavenging of ROS, downregulated
  Nrf2 pathway and enzymic or nonenzymic antioxidant agents should be attributable.
