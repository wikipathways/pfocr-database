caption: 'Ingenuity pathway Analysis network 1 depicting relationships among up-regulated
  genes in SB300 infection group relative to that of SB1117 infection group at 8 hours.
  Intensity of the red color indicates the degree of up-regulation. Nodes are displayed
  using various shapes that represent the functional class of the gene product. Edges
  are displayed with various labels that describe the nature of relationship between
  the nodes: ___ represents direct relationship; ----- represents indirect relationship;
  → represents acts on.'
