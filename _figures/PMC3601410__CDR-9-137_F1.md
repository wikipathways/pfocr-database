caption: Nrf2 is bound to Keap1 in the cytoplasm. Keap1 acts as a substrate adaptor
  protein for the cullin 3-containing E3-ligase complex and targets Nrf2 for ubuquination.
  Then, Nrf2 is led to proteasome mediated degradation. Electrophilic and oxidative
  stressors or pharmacological inducers of Nrf2 signaling (CDDO-Im and sulforaphane)
  interact with cysteine thiols of Keap1to disrupt Nrf2 sequestration and proteolytic
  marking. Nrf2 can now accumulate, translocate into the nucleus and form heterodimers
  with the small Maf proteins, bind to Antioxidant Response Element (ARE) sequences
  in the regulatory domain of its target genes and activate their transcription. Nrf2;
  nuclear erythroid factor 2 like 2, Keap1; kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, CDDO-Im;
