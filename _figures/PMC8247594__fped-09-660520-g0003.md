caption: XIAP plays a key function in various immune pathways. (A) XIAP is required
  for pattern recognition receptors (PPR) mediated innate immune responses. (i) XIAP
  is essential for the NOD1/2 induced activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways and
  secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (). NOD1 and NOD2 are intracellular
  PRRs that bind DAP and MDP, respectively (, ). Upon ligand binding, XIAP, together
  with cIAP1/2, ubiquitinates RIPK2, which subsequently acts as a scaffold for the
  TAK/TAB1 and IKK complexes, leading to activation of the MAPK and NF-κB pathways,
  respectively (, , ). The TAK/TAB1 also links to the IKK complex, thereby inducing
  activation of the NF-κB pathway (, , , ). Upon NOD activation, XIAP also recruits
  LUBAC, which in turn conjugates linear Ub chains to RIPK2. The concurrent ubiquitination
  of RIPK2 by XIAP and LUBAC is necessary for efficient activation of the canonical
  IKK for NF-κB activation (, , ). (ii) XIAP is necessary in Dectin-1 signalling.
  Dectin-1 is a transmembrane PRR that detects β-glucan. Upon Dectin-1 stimulation,
  XIAP binds and ubiquitinates BCL-10, which is essential for the activation of the
  NF-κB and MAPK pathways and cytokine production. BCL-10 is also involved in Rac1-dependent
  phagocytosis, which again relies on ubiquitination of BCL-10 by XIAP (). (B) XIAP
  regulates the activation of inflammasomes via TLR/TNFR signalling. (i) Following
  TNFR1 and TLR signalling, RIPK3 can recruit RIKP1 to activate caspase-8 (, ). In
  this process, XIAP has an inhibitory effect on the ripopotosome by controlling the
  ubiquitination of RIKP1 in a RIPK3-dependent manner (, ). (ii) XIAP inhibits MLKL
  necroptotic signalling, which is promoted by RIPK3 in the absence of caspase-8 ().
  (iii) TLR-MyD88 signalling causes the proteasomal degradation of cIAP1 and its adaptor
  TRAF2 by inducing TNF and TNFR2 signalling. This proteasomal degradation is inhibited
  by TLR-TRIF induced IFN-β. Loss of XIAP promotes LPS-induced cIAP1 degradation.
  Subsequently, cIAP1 loss in the absence of XIAP promotes TLR-induced RIPK3 caspase-8
  and IL-1β activity, eventually leading to IL-1β maturation, caspase-8 cleavage and
  enhanced cell death (). (iiii) TNFR2 activation acts as a signal 1 for priming the
  canonical inflammasome and induces expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. XIAP
  loss and TNFR1 signalling play a role as signal 2 for activation of the inflammasome.
  This is mediated by RIPK1 and ROS production. In the absence of XIAP, TNFR2 stimulation
  leads to TNF production, followed by TNFR1 mediated cell death (). Created with
