caption: Folate synthesis pathway. a The figure shows the synthesis of dTMP by the
  enzyme TS which uses methylene tetrahydrofolate and converts it into dihydrofolate.
  It is then converted back to tetrahydrofolate by the enzyme DHFR. b The schematic
  diagram shows that the enzyme pteridine reductase (PTR1) can reduce both pterins
  and folates
