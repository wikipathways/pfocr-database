caption: Activation of apoptosis by HCoVs. Binding of death ligands to death receptor
  induces caspase 8 activation, which in turn activates effector caspases 3 and 7
  to stimulate apoptosis. On the other hand, intrinsic pathway is regulated by pro-apoptotic
  and anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins, such as Bcl-XL, Bcl2, Bax and Bak to induce
  MOMP. Subsequent caspase 9 activation caused by enhanced MOMP stimulates caspases
  3 and 7 activation. During HCoV infection, the virus or specific viral proteins
  (yellow-orange boxes) target at multiple stages of both the extrinsic and intrinsic
  apoptosis signalling pathways.
