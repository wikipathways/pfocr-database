caption: 'Type I IFN production and signaling pathway suppressed by SARS-CoV-2: Upon
  viral infection, the recognition by host innate immune sensors such as RLRs and
  TLRs triggers an antiviral signaling cascade, resulting in the production of IFNs
  and the activation of IFN signaling pathways, eventually ensuing in the production
  of ISGs. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 has developed strategies to counteract the host
  defense system by inhibiting protein–protein interactions (dotted purple lines),
  the phosphorylation of proteins (dotted black lines), degrading of host cellular
  proteins (scissors), and cellular localization of proteins (blue arrowed lines).
  DMV: double-membrane vesicles.'
