caption: Regulation of symbiotic nodule development in legumes. Rhizobia produce Nod-factors,
  which activate a signaling cascade leading to phosphorylation of the MtIPD3/LjCYCLOPS
  TF by CCaMK. MtIPD3/LjCYCLOPS and cytokinin-dependent pathway activate the expression
  of the NIN gene and other genes involved in the legume–rhizobia symbiosis. NSP1
  and NSP2 TFs act downstream of MtIPD3/LjCYCLOPS, and NSP1 is able to bind to the
  promoter of the NIN gene. A MYB coiled-coil type transcription factor IPN2 (Interacting
  Protein of NSP2) interacts with NSP1 and NSP2 to activate NIN expression [,]. The
  NSP2 transcripts are post-transcriptionally regulated by miR171. The KNOX3 TF activates
  cytokinin biosynthesis genes, IPT3 and LOG2, during nodulation, and other factors
  contribute to activation of cytokinin biosynthesis at the very early stages of nodulation.
  The NIN TF directly induces the expression of NF-YA1 and NF-YB1 which regulate nodule
  development and emergence, as well as nodule meristem formation. NF-YA1 is targeted
  by miR169. NIN also activates the ASL18/LBD16 gene involved in the LR developmental
  program. ASL18/LBD16 forms complex with the NF-Y transcription factors to regulate
  both LR and nodule development by activating auxin biosynthesis. Other components
  of the root developmental program, including the PLT, SCR, SHR, and WOX5 TFs are
  also induced during nodule primordia development. MtNOOT1 and MtNOOT2 establish
  and maintain indeterminate nodule identity. NIN upregulates the level of miR172
  which negatively regulates NNC1. NNC1 is а transcriptional repressor interacting
  with NIN and inhibit NIN activity. Both miR172 and NIN expression levels are negatively
  regulated by the autoregulation of nodulation (AON). NIN directly activates the
  expression of the CLE genes, including MtCLE13 in M. truncatula. In addition to
  NIN, the NLP TF activates the expression of the nitrate-induced CLE genes (MtCLE35
  in M. truncatula) in response to the nitrate. The CLE peptides are produced in the
  root in response to rhizobia inoculation and the nitrate treatment and move to the
  shoot where they are recognized by their receptors, including the CLV1-like receptor
  kinase (MtSUNN in M. truncatula). Activation of the CLV1-like receptor kinase in
  the shoot triggers a negative feedback response, which inhibits subsequent nodulation
  on the root. MtCEP7 expression is also upregulated by NIN, and it positively regulates
  nodule development. The CEP peptides involved in nodulation are suggested to move
  from the root to the shoot, where they are recognized by their receptor (MtCRA2
  in M. truncatula). MtCRA2-dependent signaling cascade upregulates and MtSUNN-dependent
  signaling cascade downregulates miR2111, which is a mobile miRNA transported from
  the shoot to the root. The TML transcripts, encoding an F-box-containing protein
  which negatively regulates nodulation, are the targets of miR2111 in the root. The
  GRAS TFs are highlighted by orange rectangles, the AP2/ERF TFs are highlighted by
  violet rectangles.
