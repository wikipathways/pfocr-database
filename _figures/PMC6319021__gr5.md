caption: 'Proposed mechanism for kCer acting as a Sema3A-like ligand. Sema3A binding:
  Sema3A binds to Nrp1, recruiting a monomer from an inactive PlexA dimer, resulting
  in the formation of a hetero-pentameric complex of Sema3A, Nrp1 dimer, and PlexA.
  Signaling pathway downstream molecule of the Sema3A, Cofilin is phosphorylated,
  resulting in suppression of actin turnover, causing an inhibition of cell migration.
  kCer also binds as a Sema3A-like ligand to Nrp1 without Sema3A and forms of the
  receptor complex to induces an inhibitory effect on cell migration.'
