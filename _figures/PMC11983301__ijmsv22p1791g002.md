caption: The role of podocytes, renal tubular epithelial cells, and glomerular mesangial
  cells in DKD. A.| High hyperglycemia stimulated the expression of Trim63 and VHL,
  which enhanced substrate ubiquitination and promoted podocyte apoptosis. The E3
  ligase APC/C is inhibited by an increase in MAD2B level, which results in podocyte
  apoptosis. Both Trim29 and NEDD4L enhanced substrate ubiquitination degradation
  triggered the NF-κB signaling pathway and resulted in podocyte pyroptosis and inflammation,
  respectively. B.| Under the influence of elevated glucose, RTECs undergo EMT induced
  by TIPE1 and the E3 ligases Parkin and RFFL. Reduced FBXW7 expression raises substrate
  content, which in turn raises the activity of important lipid metabolism enzymes
  and causes abnormal lipid buildup in RTECs. C.| Deubiquitinase USP25 and CYLD can
  inhibit the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways caused by AGEs-RAGE, and inhibit the
  inflammatory response of GMCs. USP22, Trim13, and Smurf1 can cause extracellular
  matrix aggregation and promote renal fibrosis
