caption: Model for orientation-dependent replicative instability DNA synthesis arrests
  within a CAG or CTG repeat array (see DNA structure 1) and strand slippage occurs
  either accompanied (b) or not (c) with stable secondary structure formation (a).
  A template containing CAG repeats will form less stable secondary structures (see
  DNA structure 2) and so primarily will adopt “deletion pathway A” whereas a template
  with CTG repeats will form more stable secondary structures (see DNA structure 3
  and DNA structure 4) and so primarily will adopt “deletion pathway B.” Some interconversion
  between well-folded and less well-folded structures (and between differently folded
  structures, not shown) may also be possible (interchange d). The observation that
  orientation dependence of repeat instability is lost in a dnaQ mutant implies that
  the initiation of slippage is independent of whether the template contains CAG or
  CTG repeats. This has the further implication that initiation of slippage occurs
  independently of the potential of the strand to form stable secondary structures.
  The requirement for the presence of SbcCD for loss of orientation dependence in
  a dnaQ mutant implies that SbcCD ensures the efficient processing of slippage intermediates
  initiated on both CAG and CTG repeats. Orientation dependence is generated by poor
  proofreading of the CTG template strand. In the model, this is envisaged to be because
  3′–5′ exonucleolytic proofreading does not remove a secondary structure if it is
  present (compare f with e) and so new synthesis has the potential to slip again
  on such a template (DNA structure 3 to DNA structure 4). In the absence of proofreading,
  intermediates with stable structures are committed to deletion (whether or not SbcCD
  is present) while intermediates with less stable secondary structures can escape
  through an inefficient disassembly pathway (g) that is significant only in the absence
  of SbcCD (and of proofreading).

  description: Model for orientation-dependent replicative instability DNA synthesis
    arrests within a CAG or CTG repeat array (see DNA structure 1) and strand slippage
    occurs either accompanied (b) or not (c) with stable secondary structure formation
    (a). A template containing CAG repeats will form less stable secondary structures
    (see DNA structure 2) and so primarily will adopt “deletion pathway A” whereas
    a template with CTG repeats will form more stable secondary structures (see DNA
    structure 3 and DNA structure 4) and so primarily will adopt “deletion pathway
    B.” Some interconversion between well-folded and less well-folded structures (and
    between differently folded structures, not shown) may also be possible (interchange
    d). The observation that orientation dependence of repeat instability is lost
    in a dnaQ mutant implies that the initiation of slippage is independent of whether
    the template contains CAG or CTG repeats. This has the further implication that
    initiation of slippage occurs independently of the potential of the strand to
    form stable secondary structures. The requirement for the presence of SbcCD for
    loss of orientation dependence in a dnaQ mutant implies that SbcCD ensures the
    efficient processing of slippage intermediates initiated on both CAG and CTG repeats.
    Orientation dependence is generated by poor proofreading of the CTG template strand.
    In the model, this is envisaged to be because 3′–5′ exonucleolytic proofreading
    does not remove a secondary structure if it is present (compare f with e) and
    so new synthesis has the potential to slip again on such a template (DNA structure
    3 to DNA structure 4). In the absence of proofreading, intermediates with stable
    structures are committed to deletion (whether or not SbcCD is present) while intermediates
    with less stable secondary structures can escape through an inefficient disassembly
    pathway (g) that is significant only in the absence of SbcCD (and of proofreading).
