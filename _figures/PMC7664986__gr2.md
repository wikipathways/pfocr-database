caption: 'Possible Mechanisms for Dementia Related to Hearing LossMechanism 1: common
  pathology due to Alzheimer disease (AD) or vascular disease affects the cochlea
  and/or the ascending pathway (causing hearing loss) and MTL (causing dementia).
  Mechanism 2: impoverished environment caused by hearing loss leads to altered brain
  structure in the auditory cortex and hippocampus and decreased cognitive reserve,
  and therefore decreased resilience to dementia. Mechanism 3: increased brain activity
  in the MTL and a wider network during speech-in-noise analysis competes for the
  resources within that network that are also needed for other aspects of higher cognition.
  We argue in the text that this may be a better model for cognitive deficits in elderly
  people due to hearing loss as opposed to dementia per se. Mechanism 4: interaction
  between altered activity related to pattern analysis in the MTL during difficult
  listening and the pathology of AD. The model is based on the same mechanism for
  increased activity as mechanism 3, but it differs in the incorporation of a specific
  interaction with the molecular bases of AD. This is based on an interaction between
  increased activity and synaptic changes associated with AD. We also consider a mechanism
  in the text due to decreased activity interacting with AD pathology (not shown here).
