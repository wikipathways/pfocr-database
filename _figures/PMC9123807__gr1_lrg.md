caption: 'Proviral functions of CypA in HCV replication. (Left panel) CypA roles in
  HCV replication. CypA recruits ISGylated NS5A to PKR, inhibiting the PKR signaling
  pathway and nuclear migration of IRF1. CypA participates in the genomic replication
  of HCV by interacting with viral proteins: NS5B and NS5A, within the double-membrane
  vesicles (DMVs) that provide an isolated compartment for HCV RNA-dependent RNA replication.
  (Right panel) Two ways of antiviral machinery of CsA – a CypA inhibitor. It interferes
  with CypA–NS5A interaction, resulting in activation of PKR-mediated antiviral response.
  Alternatively, CsA blocks CypA binding to NS5A and NS5B, the main components of
  the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex, finally resulting in disruption of DMV
  formation. Abbreviations: CypA, cyclophilin A; NS, nonstructural viral protein;
  ISG15, interferon-stimulated gene product 15; PKR, protein kinase R; IRF1, interferon
  regulatory factor 1; CsA, cyclosporin A.'
