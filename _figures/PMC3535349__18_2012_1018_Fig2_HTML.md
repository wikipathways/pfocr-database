caption: Iron transport across the placenta (syncytiotrophoblasts). Diferric transferrin
  (Tf-Fe2) from the maternal blood binds to Transferrin Receptor 1 (TfR1) and is taken
  up by syncytiotrophoblasts via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Inside the cell, specialized
  endosomes are formed and subsequently acidified by a proton pump. At pH 5.5, iron
  is released from transferrin molecules, while the transferrin itself remains bound
  to TfR1. Subsequently the Tf, in complex with TfR1, is recycled back to the cell
  surface, where, at the higher pH, its affinity for the receptor is reduced and it
  disassociates. Iron released from transferrin inside the acidified endosome is reduced
  to the ferrous state (Fe2+) by an oxidoreductase (potentially Steap3 in syncytiotrophoblasts)
  and is then transported to the cytoplasm via DMT1 or another as yet unknown transporter
  (question mark in the figure). Once in the cytoplasm, iron can be stored in ferritin
  (Ft), used for iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis and heme synthesis, or exported to
  the fetal circulation by ferroportin (Fpn), which, in syncytiotrophoblasts, acts
  in cooperation with zyklopen, a copper-dependent ferroxidase. The mRNA transcript
  encoding the second transferrin receptor (TfR2) has also been detected in the placenta,
  but the role of the TfR2 protein in iron import by syncytiotrophoblasts is elusive.
  Iron transport through the placenta is regulated at several levels. In response
  to changes in the intracellular iron pool, the iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) can
  regulate the expression of target genes (TfR1, DMT1, Ft, and Fpn) at the post-transcriptional
  level. In the absence of iron, both IRPs bind to specific sequences, called iron
  responsive elements (IREs), located within the untranslated regions (UTRs) of target
  mRNAs. Binding to the 3′UTR IRE increases mRNA stability (e.g., for TfR1 or DMT1),
  whereas binding to the 5′UTR IRE blocks its translation (which is the case for Ft
  and Fpn). When iron is abundant, IRP1 assembles an iron–sulfur cluster and IRP2
  is degraded by a FBXL5-dependent pathway. Both maternal and fetal hepcidin levels
  seems to regulate the rate of iron trafficking through the placenta. Fetal hepcidin
  most probably acts by binding to Fpn located in the basolateral membrane of syncytiotrophoblasts,
  thus promoting its internalization and subsequent degradation. Moreover, fetal hepcidin
  was also proposed to down-regulate TfR1 expression at the apical membrane of syncytiotrophoblasts
  by an unidentified transcriptional mechanism. In addition, hereditary hemochromatosis
  protein (HFE), a known regulator of hepcidin expression in hepatocytes, was recently
  shown to be an important player in the modulation of iron transfer across the placenta.
  Several mechanisms have been proposed for this regulation, depending on the source
  of the protein, i.e., maternal or fetal. Since syncytiotrophoblasts are genetically
  fetal in origin, and HFE protein was found to be expressed and interact with TfR1
  at the syncytiotrophoblast apical plasma membrane, it was proposed that, in placenta,
  fetal HFE can compete with transferrin for the binding site on TfR1 and thus negatively
  regulate maternal–fetal iron transfer. In contrast, HFE was proposed to localize
  at the basal membrane of human syncytiotrophoblasts and furthermore, colocalize
  with ferroportin, although its potential role at this location has not been elucidated.
  HFE, as an important component of a larger iron-sensing complex at the plasma membrane
  of hepatocytes, can govern the regulation of fetal and maternal hepcidin expression.
  However, this axis seems to be important only for fetal hepcidin expression, since
  Hfe knockout pups show a close relationship between very low expression of hepatic
  hepcidin and high levels of placental ferroportin. Interestingly, although maternal
  HFE (yellow) seems to regulate the expression of TfR1, DMT1, and Fpn in the placenta
  of dams fed a high iron diet, its inactivation neither changes the expression of
  TfR1, DMT1, and Fpn in the placenta in animals fed a low iron diet, nor does it
  modulate maternal hepcidin expression
