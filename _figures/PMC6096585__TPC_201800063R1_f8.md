caption: A Regulatory Pathway of Rice Tiller Angle via LA1-Mediated Auxin Asymmetric
  Distribution.HSFA2D may regulate auxin asymmetric distribution by regulating expression
  level of LA1, which in turn modulates the asymmetric expression of auxin downstream
  regulators WOX6 and WOX11 and thus modulates rice shoot gravitropism and tiller
  angle. The arrow marked with g indicates the direction of gravity.
