caption: A series of coordinated enzymatic reactions takes place during fatty acid
  biosynthesis. Typically, pyruvate produced by glycolysis is converted in the mitochondrion
  into acetyl-CoA, which enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce citrate.
  In conditions of carbohydrate excess, citrate is exported to the cytosol by the
  citrate/isocitrate carrier (CIC) and is broken down to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate
  (OAA) by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY). Acetyl-CoA is subsequently carboxylated by acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase (ACC) to generate malonyl-CoA, which is considered the first committed
  metabolic intermediate in fatty acid synthesis. Utilizing seven malonyl-CoA molecules
  and one acetyl-CoA primer, the synthesis of palmitate (16:0 fatty acid) is completed
  by repeating a cycle of condensation, reduction, condensation and dehydration catalysed
  by fatty acid synthase (FAS). An alternative carbon source of de novo lipogenesis
  (DNL) is acetate, which can be produced de novo from glucose through non-enzymatic
  and enzymatic reactions. Acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) catalyses the reaction
  of acetate and CoA to form acetyl-CoA, which is subsequently used for fatty acid
  biosynthesis. With hypoxia or CIC deficiency another alternative pathway for DNL
  is reductive carboxylation of glutamine via cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1
  (IDH1) and mitochondrial IDH2. αKG, α-ketoglutarate; ACP, acyl carrier protein;
  mKDH, mitochondrial ketoacid dehydrogenase; nKDH, nuclear ketoacid dehydrogenase;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species.
