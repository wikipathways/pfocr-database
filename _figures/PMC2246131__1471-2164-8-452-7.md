caption: Schematic diagram showing the possible effects of the reelin pathway in protection
  from CM. Reelin (RELN) is an extracellular matrix serine protease expressed in some
  neurons, such as GABAergic interneurons, which inhibit excitotoxic neurotransmission
  [45]. RELN that is secreted into the extracellular space acts by paracrine and autocrine
  mechanisms. RELN interacts with very low-density lipoprotein receptors (VLDLR) and
  apolipoprotein E type 2 receptors (ApoER2) leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of
  the adaptor protein Disabled-1 (DAB1) by the SRC family kinases (SRC) [42]. DAB1
  activation, in turn, activates PI3K/Akt signalling, which has been implicated in
  neuronal migration during development and adulthood. In addition, phosphorylated
  DAB1 interacts with LIS1, a protein encoded by Pafah1b1, which associates with microtubules
  and modulates neuronal migration [46]. LIS1 may be required for regulating crucial
  steps of reelin-dependent neuronal positioning. In parallel, phosphorylated DAB1
  inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), a kinase known to phosphorylate Tau
  protein at multiple sites. Therefore, the activation of RELN pathway diminishes
  the level of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein, which is a biomarker of brain injury.
  In particular, hyperphosphorylated Tau protein is a component of the neurofibrillary
  tangles involved in Alzheimer's disease. Reln, Dab1 and Pafah1b1 were shown to be
  over-expressed in CM-R mice compared to CM-S mice. The activation of RELN signalling
  may inhibit excitotoxic neurotransmission and Tau phosphorylation, and may activate
  neurogenesis in CM-R mice. This may lead to diminished brain injury and to increased
  brain injury repair. Solid arrows represent influences on the activity of proteins
  or physiological mechanisms. Dashed arrows represent impaired effects on the activity
  of proteins or physiological mechanisms. Negative signs indicate inhibition, and
  positive signs indicate activation.
