caption: 'P2X4R-p38 MAPK is a core signaling pathway through which spinal microglia
  and peripheral macrophages contribute to neuropathic pain and inflammatory pain.
  a Following injury to a peripheral nerve, expression of P2X4R is upregulated in
  microglia that reside in the spinal dorsal horn. Several factors have recently been
  implicated in the upregulation of microglial P2X4R: the fibronectin-Lyn kinase signaling
  cascade, cytokine IFN-γ, tryptase released from mast cells, and the chemokine CCL21.
  Influx of Ca2+ through ATP stimulated P2X4R activates p38-MAPK and drives the synthesis
  and SNARE-dependent release of BDNF. Acting on its cognate receptor, trkB, BDNF
  released from microglia signals to dorsal horn lamina I neurons to downregulate
  the K+-Cl− cotransporter KCC2, resulting in aberrant nociceptive output that underlies
  pain hypersensitivity characterized by hyperalgesia, allodynia, and spontaneous
  pain. b Like microglia, peripheral macrophages constitutively express P2X4R. Inflammatory
  challenges that activate P2X4R on macrophages trigger Ca2+ influx and p38 MAPK phosphorylation.
  In macrophages, the P2X4R-p38 MAPK pathway is a signaling hub that activates cytosolic
  PLA2 which liberates arachidonic acid (AA) resulting in a cyclooxygenase (COX) dependent
  synthesis and release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a key substrate that sensitizes
  primary sensory neurons and leads to hyperexcitability of peripheral nociceptive
  pathways that is a hallmark of inflammatory pain'
