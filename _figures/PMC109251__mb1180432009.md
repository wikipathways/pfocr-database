caption: Model for integration of growth factor-, retinoid-, and ECM-derived signaling
  pathways during normal mucosecretory cell differentiation. Randomly growing NHBEs
  express and secrete TGF-α and amphiregulin, one or both of which participate in
  an autocrine loop, signaling via the endogenous EGFR. In addition, NHBEs respond
  to exogenous EGF present in growth media or produced by neighboring cells in vivo.
  Differentiation-promoting ECMs (e.g., collagen) suppress autocrine and paracrine
  activation of the MAPK pathway by the EGFR, acting downstream of the EGFR and upstream
  of Raf. This is correlated with an inability to achieve high levels of tyrosyl-phosphorylated
  p66SHC and its association with GRB2. However, it remains possible that as yet unidentified
  differences in EGFR-dependent signaling may actually account for the ECM-dependent
  inhibition of Raf, MEK, and MAPK activation. Ultimately, reduction in MAPK activity
  inactivates an inhibitor of retinoid receptor activity and results in the strong
  induction of RARβ expression in the presence of retinoids.
