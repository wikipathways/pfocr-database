caption: Production of active vitamin D3. The storage form of vitamin D, calcidiol,
  or 25(OH)D (black box) is made following liver hydroxylation of vitamin D3 following
  dietary ingestion or skin synthesis from ultraviolet B exposure (peak skin production
  follows a 5- to 10-minute exposure of summertime sun between 10 am and 3 pm [produces
  about 10 000 IU of vitamin D3]). Active vitamin D produced either locally or through
  the kidney endocrine pathway has its biological effect by altering gene expression
  through a specific vitamin D response element.
