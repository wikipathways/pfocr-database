caption: KIF3AC stepping cycle and computational scheme.A, the cycle begins when one
  motor domain associates with the MT (E0A–E1A or E0C–E1C). Note that the KIF3A head
  is colored red and KIF3C blue. On MT association, ADP is released from the MT-interacting
  head, and ATP binds to the vacant nucleotide-binding site (E0A–E2A or E0C–E2C).
  Neck-linker docking results in a series of structural transitions where the tethered
  trailing head moves forward 16 nm, associates with the MT, and releases ADP (E2A–E4A
  or E2C–E4C). The ATP on the rear head is subsequently hydrolyzed, which is followed
  by coupled phosphate release from the active site and motor head dissociation (E4A–E1C
  or E4C–E1A). B, the computational scheme consists of five different intermediates.
  Either KIF3A or KIF3C motor head associates with the MT (states 1 and 3, respectively).
  ATP binds to the KIF3A (state 2) or KIF3C (state 4). The steps after ATP binding,
  which are collapsed in this model, consist of the motor undergoing a series of transitions
  that include neck-linker docking, forward movement, and MT association of the trailing
  head, followed by ADP release. Subsequently, ATP hydrolysis occurs followed by phosphate
  release with dissociation of the new trailing head (transitions 2-3 for the KIF3A
  pathway and transitions 4-1 for the KIF3C pathway). The kinesin can then bind another
  ATP molecule to undergo another turnover of ATP, or alternatively, phosphate release
  can result in detachment of the dimer from the MT (state 5). The rate constants
  associated with these steps in the cycle are defined in . MT, microtubule.
