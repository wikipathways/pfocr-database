caption: USPs and p53 signaling pathway. p53 forms tetramers and translocate into
  nucleus, where p53 binds and activates target genes transcription to regulate many
  different biological processes in response to cellular stress. p53 protein keeps
  at a very level under normal condition, it is tightly regulated by MDM2, which promotes
  ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of p53. p53 itself binds to
  MDM2 to form a feedback loop. ARF binds to MDM2, leading to the rapid degradation
  of MDM2 and accumulation of p53. p53 proteins and p53 transcriptional activators
  HIF-1α can be ubiquitinated and proteasomal degraded in normal condition, whereas
  it is oppositely regulated by DUBs in stress condition. ARF, alternate open reading
  frame; MDM2, Mouse double minute 2; HIF-1α, hypoxia inducible factor-1α; RBM28,
  RNA-binding protein; CYLD, cylindromatosis; USP, Ubiquitin-specific protease; Ub,
  ubiquitin; P, phosphorylation
