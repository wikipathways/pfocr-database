caption: 'Thyroid hormone signaling regulates adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus,
  the subventricular zone and, potentially, the hypothalamus. (A) In the hippocampal
  niche (SGZ), NSC gives rise proliferating progenitors (2a) and then, more committed
  progenitors (2b) and post-mitotic neuroblasts (type 3). Type 3 progenitors give
  rise to immature and mature granule neurons. A role of T3, in concert with TRα1,
  has been observed in non-proliferating progenitors, from type 2b cells to mature
  granule cell neurons. Adult-onset hypothyroidism or TRα1 overexpression (TRα2−/−
  mice) alters survival of post-mitotic neuroblasts, decreasing hippocampal neurogenesis.
  (B) In the adult SVZ, lining the lateral ventricle, three main cell types are located:
  NSCs that divide asymmetrically to give rise to proliferating progenitors. Progenitors
  divide rapidly producing neuroblasts that migrate along the rostral migratory stream
  (RMS) to the olfactory bulb (OB) where they differentiate into interneurons. SOX2
  and TRα1 are inversely expressed within the SVZ: cells expressing high levels of
  TRα1 express low levels of SOX2 (neuroblasts). T3 is involved in both progenitor
  proliferation and determination. TRα1 overexpression in NSC and progenitors drives
  progenitor commitment toward a neuronal phenotype since cells overexpressing TRα1
  are found in clusters entering the RMS. (C) In the adult hypothalamus, the third
  ventricle is lined by ependymal cells (in gray) interspersed with tanycytes (in
  blue). Some of these tanycytes are stem cells. They possess a long process that
  projects into hypothalamic nuclei (in pink). Some recent data support the idea that
  tanycytes are able to generate new neurons that migrate into adjacent hypothalamic
  nuclei. Tanycytes express many key actors of the TH pathway (Dio2, OATP1C1, and
  MCT8) thus, facilitating TH entry into the hypothalamus. These tanycytes could be
  considered as an “integrative platform” relaying central and peripheral signals
  to adapt adult neurogenesis to food intake and energy metabolism. A key role of
  TH in the regulation of adult hypothalamic neurogenesis is an exciting hypothesis.'
