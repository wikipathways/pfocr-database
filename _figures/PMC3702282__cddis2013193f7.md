caption: Proposed model of miR-129 function as a potential tumor suppressor in CRC
  and a sensitizer to 5-FU-based chemotherapy. miR-129 suppresses the protein expression
  of three critical targets, BCL2, TS, and E2F3. Downregulation of BCL2 activates
  the intrinsic apoptosis pathway by cleaving caspase-9 and caspase-3. Downregulation
  of TS and E2F3 inhibits cell proliferation by impacting cell cycle. Thereby, miR-129
  exerts a strong antitumor phenotype by induction of apoptosis and impairment of
  proliferation in tumor cells. Ultimately, this phenotype sensitizes CRC cells to
  fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy
