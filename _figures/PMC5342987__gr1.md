caption: BMP4 cellular signaling pathway including activators and inhibitors. BMP4
  may bind to preformed complexes (PFCs), in which, BMPR Type I and Type II receptors
  are bound at the cell surface; or to Type I receptors which then complex with Type
  II receptors to form BMP4 induced signaling complexes (BISCs). Co-binding partners
  (RGMs, DRAGON, BAMBI, etc.) may enhance BMP4 dimer binding of Type I receptors in
  both PFCs and BISCs. BMP4 receptor binding activates the canonical SMAD-dependent
  signal pathway, via phosphorylation of receptor associated SMADs (Smad1/5/8). Activated
  SMADs form complexes with Co-SMAD4, enter the nucleus and in combination with co-binding
  partners, such as p300 or STAT, act as transcription factors which drive neural
  and astroglial gene expression. Extracellular activators such as sulfated polysaccharides,
  BMP-1, or kielin and inhibitors of BMP4 including Noggin, Chordin, and Gremlin,
  enhance or inhibit activity of this signal pathway, respectively. Intracellular
  inhibitors SMAD6/7, Smurf1/2 and dorsomorphin may block pathway activity. BMP4 may
  also activate SMAD-independent pathways, for instance, MAPK/p38, JNK, Erk etc. Pseudo-receptors
  such as BAMBI can bind to BMP4 dimers, however these pseudo-receptor complexes do
  not activate downstream signaling cascades due to lack of kinase domains.

  description: BMP4 cellular signaling pathway including activators and inhibitors.
    BMP4 may bind to preformed complexes (PFCs), in which, BMPR Type I and Type II
    receptors are bound at the cell surface; or to Type I receptors which then complex
    with Type II receptors to form BMP4 induced signaling complexes (BISCs). Co-binding
    partners (RGMs, DRAGON, BAMBI, etc.) may enhance BMP4 dimer binding of Type I
    receptors in both PFCs and BISCs. BMP4 receptor binding activates the canonical
    SMAD-dependent signal pathway, via phosphorylation of receptor associated SMADs

    in combination with co-binding partners, such as p300 or STAT, act as transcription
    factors which drive neural and astroglial gene expression. Extracellular activators
