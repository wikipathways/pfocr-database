caption: 'Differential impact of MnPs on normal tumor tissue. Data generated by us
  and others demonstrate that MnP, in the presence of H2O2, drives radioprotection
  of normal tissue but suppression of tumor growth. Based on present studies, we came
  up with the following explanation. The rather simplified scheme aims to identify
  only major pathways that are involved in the actions of MnPs and presumably other
  metal-based drugs and which have been investigated in both tumor and normal tissue.
  The differential effects originate from the differences in the local redox environments
  of those tissues: that is, much larger tumor than normal cell/tissue levels of H2O2
  (black circles) and MnPs (black stars). In the presence of H2O2 and GSH, MnP catalyzes
  S-glutathionylation of protein cysteines, described by –. The reactants in both
  cells/tissues are the same and the underlying fundamental reactions would have the
  same rate constants. However, the different yields observed from these reactions
  derive from the different levels of those reactants. Due to its high intracellular
  levels, GSH is not a rate-limiting reactant. We have thus far demonstrated that
  NF-κB, a master transcription factor, has been suppressed in both tumor and normal
  cells/tissues. We have also shown that HIF-1α was suppressed in normal lungs exposed
  to RT and in sc flank 4T breast tumor model; HIF-1α might have been regulated by
  NF-κB (, , , ). The redox proteomic data show that NF-κB pathway is the main pathways
  affected in 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells treated with MnP/Asc as a source of H2O2—its
  massive S-glutathionylation was demonstrated (, , , , , , ). The suppression of
  NF-κB is larger in tumor than normal cell/tissue, as a result of the higher levels
  of reactants (H2O2, MnP), and leads to massive tumor apoptosis. With regard to other
  key transcription factor, Nrf2, we only have direct evidence for the effect of MnP
  on Nrf2 activation in the normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells; presumably,
  the oxidation of Keap1 cysteines by MnP might have been involved (). Indirect evidence
  was obtained in a rat kidney I/R injury model, where treatment of rats with MnTnHex-2-PyP5+-containing
  preparation upregulated numerous endogenous antioxidative defenses, including SODs,
  GPx, and peroxiredoxins (). Although we expect that Nrf2 is not activated in tumor
  cells/tissues, we do not have unambiguous experimental data to validate this expectation;
  morever, we do see S-glutathionylation of Keap1 when 4T1 breast cancer cells were
  treated with MnP/Asc (). Yet, Nrf2 may be controlled in ways other than oxidation
  of Keap1 cysteines with MnP (see Section V.B.5). MAPK and phosphatases, as well
  as the cross talk between Nrf2 and NF-κB, may be involved (). Both MAPK and phosphatases
  have redox-sensitive cysteines. Our redox proteomics indicate that MnP S-glutathionylates
  p38, MAPK, and PKC, as well as phosphatase type 2A (). Subsequent data from Park''s
  group () demonstrated the MnP-driven inactivation of p38, AKT, JNK, PKC, and ERK
  MAPK in 4T1 cells, which suggested the interaction of MnP with the cysteines of
  these entities as well; direct evidence on the S-glutathionylated cysteines of those
  kinases is still lacking. See review by Chong et al. () on the complex redox-sensitive
  pathways, some of which via NF-κB may be involved in the actions of MnPs. p38, p38
