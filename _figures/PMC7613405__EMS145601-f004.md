caption: A sending cell presenting a Dll or Jag ligand interacts with the receiver
  cell Notch receptor. After consecutive cleavages the Notch intracellular domain
  (NICD) translocates to the nucleus where it modulates the transcription of target
  genes. (A) In lateral inhibition the signaling cells induces Notch signaling in
  the receiving cell, upon which the receiving cell downregulates its Notch ligands.
  The cell fate difference between the two cells becomes more pronounced. This process
  contributes to tissue patterning. (B) In lateral induction the signal-receiving
  cells upregulate ligands and can thus function as both a sending and a receiving
  cell, propagating the signal through layers of cells. This process contributes to
  tissue homeostasis [].
