caption: Schematic diagram of NPFF and its receptors’ signaling pathways. NPFF binds
  to NPFFR1, NPFFR2, MasR, and other RFamide receptors. NPFFR1 and NPFFR2 are primarily
  coupled to inhibitory Gαi/o and inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. NPFFR2 can also
  couple to Gαs and stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in the mouse cerebellum,
  olfactory bulb, and spinal cord. NPFF weakly binds to MasR, activating an atypical
  Gαq-phospholipase C signaling pathway. The thick arrows show the principal mechanisms
  of NPFFR1 and NPFFR2 activation, while the thin arrows show ancillary mechanisms
  of NPFFR2 activation
