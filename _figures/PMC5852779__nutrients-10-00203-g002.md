caption: Schematic and simplified representation of the TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 signaling
  pathways. Upon ligand recognition, TLR2 is activated and dimerizes with TLR1 or
  TLR6 ①. A MYD88-dependent intracellular pathway is therefore initiated with ligation
  of MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88) to the cytoplasmic
  TLR domain TIR (Toll-IL-1 receptor) ②. MYD88 recruits the IRAK (IL-1R-activating
  kinases) complex and TRAF6 (TNF-receptor associated factor 6). Phosphorylation of
  the IRAKs induce activation and release of TRAF6 from the complex ③. TRAF6 then
  activates the TAK1-binding protein 2 and TGF-activated kinase 1 (TAB2-TAK1) complex
  ④. Finally, the IκB kinases-α and β (IKKα and IKKβ) complex, responsible for activation
  of the transcription factor (NF-κB) that translocates into the nucleus, where it
  regulates gene expression of mainly pro-inflammatory genes ⑤. Moreover, TRAF6 activates
  the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway (JNK and P38), whose
  final effect is the activation of transcription factors AP-1 and CREB. TLR4 homodimers,
  following TLR4-ligand interaction ⑥. Induce activation of a MYD88-dependent pathway
  ⑦, as well as MYD88-independent pathway ❶. The second pathway starts with recruitment
  of TRAM (TRIF-related adapter molecule) to the TIR domain of the TLR4 homodimers
  and follows with recruitment of TRIF (TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β)
  ❶. TRIF activates TRAF3 and, finally, the transcription factor IRF3 (Interferon
  Regulatory Factor 3) via recruitment of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKKϵ ❷.
  IRF3 translocates to the nucleus, where it induces the expression of type I interferon
  (INF) genes. TLR5 ligand (flagellin) activates TLR5 ⑧ and, because of this, the
  MYD88-dependent pathway described above and in the text ⑨. The final effect is the
  expression of pro-inflammatory genes.
