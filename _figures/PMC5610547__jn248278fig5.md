caption: 'Metabolic pathways. 1: Role of vitamin B-12 in the mitochondria (acyl-CoA
  utilization). Acyl-CoAs are released into the cytoplasm. 2: Participation of vitamin
  B-12 in folate metabolism and methionine salvaging. 3: Acyl-CoA enters the peroxisome,
  where biosynthesis of plasmalogens occurs. 4: Phospholipid synthesis occurs in the
  endoplasmic reticulum. Vitamin B-12 is required for the mitochondrial-mediated conversion
  of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This conversion apparently results in the
  liberation of free CoA, which is consequently used to generate acylcarnitines (1).
  Vitamin B-12 and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate are cofactors required to methylate homocysteine
  into methionine, the primary precursor of the principal methyl donor, SAM (2). Inadequate
  vitamin B-12 availability results in a reduced remethylation potential of homocysteine,
  thereby limiting methionine pools and redirection of homocysteine into the transsulfuration
  pathway, a source of free cysteine for glutathione synthesis (1). Reduced methionine
  availability limits SAM biosynthesis. SAM participates in the biosynthesis of PCs
  and plasmalogen-PCs via the addition of 3 SAM-derived methyl groups to the phosphoethanolamine
  headgroup of PEs and plasmalogen-PEs (3 and 4). Perturbed generation of plasmalogens
  has been linked to demyelination and dysmyelination. Sphingomyelin, an important
  component of the myelin sheath, is generated through the transfer of the phosphocholine
  headgroup from PCs to ceramides (4). ADPS, 1-alkyldihydroxyacetone-3-phosphate synthetase;
