caption: Metabolic pathways associated with 5-HT. The metabolic pathways branching
  from the catabolism of tryptophan are shown. Green and brown branches show kynurenine
  pathways from tryptophan. The dark blue branch displays the 5-HT generation pathway
  while the red branch displays the melatonin generation pathway (solid line) and
  the melatonin catabolism pathway (dashed lines). The 5-HT catabolism pathways are
  depicted in blue, purple, and cyan dotted lines. The most relevant compounds are
  circled with dotted lines and underlined compounds have no demonstrated effects.
  An additional catabolic pathway marked in pink from 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan generates
  5-hydroxy-kynurenine and 5-hidroxy-kynurenamine family compounds (paths C05648 and
  C05647), which have no demonstrated biological effects. The compounds in these pathways
  are denoted by their “Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes” (KEGG) code (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).
  Enzymes with their classification codes (EC, http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/)
  and UNIPROT gene names are shown in squares. The shading arrows show the most studied
  pathways.
