caption: 'Transactivation of Signaling Pathways. A bipartite network illustrating
  the potential for transactivation (i.e., crosstalk) between 12 signaling pathways
  (beige spheres) and 13 signaling proteins (green rectangles). The glucose signaling
  pathway was used as a reference for weighting the other 11 signaling pathways in
  terms of their percent similarity with proteins involved in glucose signaling (sphere
  size approximates percent relatedness). The 13 signaling proteins were those common
  to glucose signaling and to at least three of the other signaling pathways (e.g.,
  JUN is common to three pathways while AKT1 is common to ten pathways). Signaling
  proteins common to neurogenesis signaling are indicated by red arrows. The source
  of the signaling pathways and proteins was Pathways Online SABiosciences. For the
  neurogenesis signaling pathway, several sources were used., – A list of signaling
  pathways and proteins used to construct this network is provided in Supplemental
  Table . The selection of pathways and proteins was for illustrative purposes and
  not intended to be exhaustive. Abbreviations: Akt, serine/threonine kinase; cAMP,
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate; cAMP-DPKA, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent
  protein kinase A; CSD, cytoskeletal dynamics; CDK5, cyclin-dependent kinase 5; EGF,
  epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; Wnt, wingless-integration site 1'
