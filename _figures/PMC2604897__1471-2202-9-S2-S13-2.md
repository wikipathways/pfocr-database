caption: 'Putative biochemical pathways involving MGAT3. Shown are pathways and gene
  networks with reported interactions involving MGAT3 under various conditions. Pathway
  analysis was performed using IPA tools (Ingenuity). Interactions are shown by lines:
  lines with arrows represent direct interactions and lines without arrows indicate
  binding only. Solid lines show reported direct interactions and broken lines show
  indirect interactions. Functions are indicated by shapes: enzymes (diamonds), cytokines
  (squares), kinases (triangles), transcription regulators (horizontal ovals), transmembrane
  receptors (vertical ovals), transporters (trapezoids), complexes (concentric circles),
  and other (circles).'
