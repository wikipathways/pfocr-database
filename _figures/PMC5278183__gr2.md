caption: 'Regulatory Roles of the Cytoskeleton at the Base of the Cilia. (A) Periciliary
  actin (brown fuzzy lines) is regulated by several pathways, some of which are cell
  cycle (CC)-dependent. Because BBS proteins have been proposed to form vesicle coats,
  they may also enhance vesicle access to the cilia base by downregulating actin polymerization.
  Although this is not indicated in this figure owing to space constraints, many actin
  polymerization regulators localize to the ciliary base. (B) Actin affects ciliogenesis
  through at least three distinct mechanisms (brown arrows): (i) regulation of vesicle
  trafficking to the cilia base; (ii) providing a scaffold to localize ciliogenesis
  regulators, such as DIDO3/HDAC6; and (iii) through the activation of the YAP/TAZ
  pathway.'
