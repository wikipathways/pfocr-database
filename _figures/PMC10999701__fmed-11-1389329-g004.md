caption: Mechanism of anti fibrotic effect in attenuating liver fibrosis. (1) Ant
  fibrotic effect decreases phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO1, which leads to FoxO1
  nuclear translocation. This event leads to the upregulation of p21 and p27 protein
  expression, inducing G0/G1 phase arrest and subsequently inhibiting the proliferation
  of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), (2) this diagram illustrates how the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway reduces liver fibrosis by inhibiting collagen, α-SMA, and HSC
  activation. The pathway’s activation leads to the inhibition of profibrogenic gene
  expression, possibly through NF-κB inhibition via AKT activation. AKT also regulates
  the TGF-β signaling pathway, inhibiting downstream effects and contributing to anti-fibrotic
  actions. The suppression of TGF-β signaling is highlighted as a key aspect of the
  pathway’s anti-fibrotic effects
