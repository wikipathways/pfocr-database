caption: The effectors LecE and LpdA are indicated by grey hexagons near the steps
  in the lipids biosynthesis pathway they affect (grey arrows). Lipid compounds are
  marked in uppercase letters and bold case. Enzymes known to catalyze individual
  steps in the phospholipids biosynthesis pathways in yeast are indicated in circles.
  PA, phosphatidic acid; DAG, diacylglycerol; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine.
  Dgk1 is a DAG-kinase and Pah1 is a PA-phosphatase.
