caption: Therapeutic targets of RTK activation and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathways
  in DMG. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and/or G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
  are activated by a variety of growth factors, neurotransmitters and hormones, including
  insulin, brain-derived neurotropic factor, glutamate and cannabinoids (reviewed
  in []). Receptor activation recruits the intracellular association of the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) regulatory (p85) and catalytic (p110) subunits. The subsequent engagement
  of Ras results in the activation of the Raf–mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
  (MEK)–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway. Alternately, RTK-induced
  PI3K activation promotes AKT signalling involving the mechanistic target of the
  rapamycin (mTORC1/2) pathway. The triggering of these pathways initiates a variety
  of signals that promote DMG tumour cell proliferation, survival and tumour growth.
  A range of inhibitory compounds, shown in grey with dotted lines indicating specific
  mechanistic targets, have been tested within the setting of DMGs.
