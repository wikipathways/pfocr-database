caption: Model depicting the effects of CS exposure on ASM. CS disrupts mitochondrial
  networking in the ASM by decreasing the expression of the fusion protein Mfn2 and
  increasing the expression of the fission protein Drp1. In consequence, the bioenergetic
  function of mitochondria becomes defective, making ATP production more dependent
  on glycolysis than on oxidative phosphorylation. This switch in metabolic pathway
  preference (along with other possible mechanisms such as increased ROS production,
  and increased autophagy/ mitophagy) promotes cell proliferation contributing to
  airway remodeling.
