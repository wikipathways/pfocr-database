caption: The C. elegans Wnt/β-catenin asymmetry (WBA) signaling pathway. (A) Asymmetric
  subcellular localization of Wnt pathway components in a mother cell before cell
  division. Frizzled and Disheveled proteins localize to the cortex on the side from
  which the Wnt signal is received, whereas PRY-1/Axin, APR-1/APC, WRM-1/β-catenin,
  and LIT-1/NLK proteins are found on the opposite side. Events in the nucleus are
  not shown. (B) Asymmetric pathway activation in the two daughters after cell division.
  In the daughter on the left, the Wnt and MAPK pathways are inactive, nuclear levels
  of POP-1/TCF are high, while nuclear levels of β-catenin SYS-1 are low. POP-1/TCF
  interacts with repressors to keep target gene expression low. In the daughter cell
  on the right, Wnt ligand activates WBA and MAPK pathways. The β-catenin WRM-1 interacts
  with LIT-1/NLK to phosphorylate POP-1/TCF, targeting it for nuclear export, thereby
  lowering the levels of nuclear POP-1. An unknown mechanism leads to an increase
  in nuclear levels of β-catenin SYS-1 in this daughter cell (question mark). POP-1
  and SYS-1 interact to up-regulate expression of Wnt target genes (red rectangle).
  Unlabeled blue hexagons indicate high levels of nuclear POP-1 (left) or phosphorylated,
  cytoplasmic POP-1 (right).
