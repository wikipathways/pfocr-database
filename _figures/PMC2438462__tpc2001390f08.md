caption: Scheme of Proposed Model for MAPK Cascade Signaling Pathway Leading to NO
  and Oxidative Bursts.INF1 induces NO burst by means of MEK2-SIPK/NTF4 cascade and
  oxidative burst by means of MEK2-SIPK/NTF4 and (NPK1)-MEK1-NTF6 cascades. Based
  on loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses, SIPK and NTF4 play important
  roles in NOA1-mediated NO burst and Nb RBOHB窶電ependent oxidative burst. NTF6 is
  also responsible for Nb RBOHB窶電ependent oxidative burst. The question mark indicates
  unidentified MAPKKK(s).
