caption: Invariant NKT (iNKT) cell activity within the tumor microenvironment (TME).
  iNKT cells can function within the TME via direct or indirect interactions with
  tumor cells. (A) In the direct activation pathway, iNKT cells recognize lipid-CD1d
  complexes on the surface of tumor cells and then directly mediate killing of tumor
  cells. By making inflammatory cytokines like IFNγ, this also helps TME-resident
  NK cells perform their anti-tumor cell effector functions (, , , , ). (B) In the
  indirect activation pathway, iNKT cells recognize lipid-CD1d complexes on the surface
  of TME-resident antigen presenting cells (APCs) or tissue-associated macrophages
  (TAMs) (). This interaction leads to iNKT cell-mediated killing of immunosuppressive
  TAMs, leading to a less immunosuppressive environment where tumor-infiltrating NK
  cells can better perform their functions. Alternately, if the CD1d is on the surface
  of a TME-resident APC, the iNKT cell can activate that APC and stimulate production
  of IL-12, helping resident effector cells like NK cells overcome the immunosuppressive
  state of the tumor ().
