caption: ADAMs have been shown to regulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in
  two ways. ADAM13 can cleave the Ephrin B ligand, thereby blocking signaling that
  represses β-catenin. Thus, ADAM13 cleavage of Ephrin B increases β-catenin signaling,
  resulting in the robust expression of β-catenin target genes such as Snail2, CyclinD1
  and myc. Second, by cleaving cadherins that associate with β-catenin at the membrane,
  ADAMs can initiate a series of proteolytic processing events, leading to the release
  of the cadherin cytoplasmic domain/C-terminal fragment (CTF2) still associated with
  β-catenin and thus stimulating this pathway. By cleaving cell adhesion molecules
  such as cadherins, ADAMs positively control the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) as well as negatively affect contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL). EMT is
  also stimulated by the activation of β-catenin target genes, which can occur through
  the formation of a CTF2/β-catenin complex. In the quail trunk neural crest, ADAM10
  processes N-cadherin, forming a CTF2 that increases expression of β-catenin and
  CyclinD1, while chick cranial neural crest cells use ADAM10 and ADAM19 to cleave
  Cadherin-6B, liberating a CTF2/β-catenin complex that associates with chromatin
  and activates these and other EMT effector genes, including Snail2. This pro-EMT
  role for a cadherin cleavage fragment is also observed for the Cadherin-6B NTF,
  which furthers EMT by enhancing Laminin (LN) degradation, likely through activation
  of MMPs. ADAM13 cleavage of Cadherin-11 produces an extracellular fragment, EC1-3,
  that binds to the ErbB2/3 complex and stimulates the phosphorylation of AKT in CNC
  and eventual CNC migration. EC1-3 increases the persistence of migration while AKT
  phosphorylation has been shown to increase N-cadherin, a protein critical for CIL
  and controlling the onset of CNC migration. ADAM13 also controls the nuclear translocation
  of Arid3a and its ability to induce Tfap2α to define the neural plate border and,
  subsequently, the neural crest. At least two genes, PCNS and Calpain8a, which lie
  downstream of ADAM13/Arid3a/Tfap2α, are critical for CNC migration.
