caption: 'Proposed models for iron-dependent and iron-independent IRP2 regulation.
  Iron-dependent pathway: iron and/or heme transiently bind IRP2 modifying a specific
  amino acid(s), which is then recognized by a specific E3-ubiquitin ligase (HOIL-1)
  leading to IRP2 ubiquitination (UB) and proteasomal degradation. Alternatively,
  iron/oxygen activates a 2-OG-dioxygenase that hydroxylates IRP2, which provides
  a target site for a specific E3-ubiquitin ligase. NO+ stimulates IRP2 degradation
  while NO−stabilizes IRP2. Hypoxia, iron chelators and the 2-OG-dioxygenase inhibitor
  DMOG also stabilize IRP2. Proteasome inhibitors block IRP2 degradation. IRP2 iron-independent
  pathway: phosphorylation regulates IRP2 RNA binding activity independent of iron.
  IRP2 can switch between a high-affinity phosphorylated form and a low-affinity dephosphorylated
  form, which are regulated by specific protein kinases and phosphatases. Both forms
  are substrates for iron-mediated degradation. IRP2 phosphorylation may allow IRP2
  to alter iron-homeostasis independent of cellular iron concentration. IRP2 is displayed
  based on m-acon structure with three domains (I–III) connected by a linker to domain
  IV.'
