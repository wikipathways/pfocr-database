caption: Links between the fibrinolytic system, the contact system, and the coagulation
  system in AE pathogenesis. The figure shows the complex multiple relationships that
  modulate the interplay of the molecules belonging to the fibrinolytic system. The
  red, dashed arrows indicate the contacts between the molecular pathways, while the
  red arrows indicate the increase or decrease of molecules in the plasma from patients
  affected by angioedema disease (AE). The interaction between the fibrinolytic system
  and the contact system leads to an auto-amplification loop that sustains the generation
  of bradykinin, the main mediator of AE attacks. Plasmin is also able to activate
  the classical pathway of complement and to cleave C3 and C5, generating C3a and
  C5a, respectively. The anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a induce mast cells’ degranulation
  and inflammatory mediators’ release. The most important preformed mediator is histamine,
  which mediates allergic forms of AE.
