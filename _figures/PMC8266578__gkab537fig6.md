caption: The 3′OH that initiates the second nucleophilic attack of the group II intron
  circularization pathway is selected by a molecular ruler. (A) The 3′ ends of circularization
  intermediates were identified by 3′ RACE. Free intron 3′ ends were amplified by
  RT-PCR from L. lactis total RNA extracts. Intron 3′ ends were identified by first
  extending the intron RNA with a poly(A) tail followed by the synthesis of cDNA with
  an oligo dT. The RNA strand was removed by an RNAse H treatment and the single-strand
  DNA amplified by PCR. The same procedure was repeated for all constructs but extending
  a poly(U) instead of a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end of the intron (). (B) The nucleotides
  present at the circularization junction of released intron circles were identified
  by RT-PCR. The primers used are represented by grey (RT) and black (PCR) arrows.
  The absence of the branch point A residue is illustrated by an empty circle. (C)
  The 3′ splice site of five Ll.LtrB-ΔA constructs is depicted showing the last stem
  of DVI attached to E2 (boxed sequence). One or two nucleotides were removed [Ll.LtrB-ΔA(−A),
  Ll.LtrB-ΔA(−AC)] or added [Ll.LtrB-ΔA(+A), Ll.LtrB-ΔA(+AA)] to the linker between
  DVI and E2 of Ll.LtrB-ΔA. Vertical lines represent free 3′ ends identified by 3′
  RACE (A), while the nucleotides found at circularization junctions (B) are shown
  as percentages. The most represented sequences at the circularization junction mostly
  correspond for all the intron variants studied to the third nucleotide from the
  bottom of the DVI stem (red nucleotide). (D) Molecular details of both steps of
  the group II intron circularization pathway for the Ll.LtrB-ΔA construct. Prior
  to the initiation of the first step of the circularization pathway, the unspliced
  intron recruits free E1 through specific base paring interactions between the intron
  EBS1/2 and the E1 IBS1/2 sequences (vertical lines). The first step of the pathway
  is initiated at the 3′ splice site of the pre-mRNA by the 3′OH of the recruited
  free E1 (step 1). The first transesterification reaction is not always accurate
  (step 1, dashed arrows) and generates circularization intermediates with different
  3′ ends along with their corresponding ligated exons. Circularization intermediates
  with 5 and 6 nt from the base of the DVI stem (DVI + 5 nt, DVI + 6 nt) were identified
  by 3′ RACE (C, vertical lines). Next, the favoured nucleophile to initiate the second
  transesterification reaction is the 3′OH of the third nucleotide after the base
  of the DVI stem (DVI + 3 nt) (step 2, dashed arrow). The great majority of the Ll.LtrB-ΔA
  released circles (95%) have an extra C at the circularization junction and were
  generated by the circularization intermediate with 3 nt after DVI. The 3′OH of the
  third nucleotide seems to be at the optimal distance to be positioned within the
  intron active site. A small number of Ll.LtrB-ΔA released circles were generated
  from circularization intermediates with 2 nt (3%) and 4 nt (2%) after DVI. The 3′OH
  of the detected intermediates with 5 nt (CAU) and 6 nt (CAUA) after DVI is not used
  by the intron to initiate the second step of the pathway.
