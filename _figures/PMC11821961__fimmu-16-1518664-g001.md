caption: The two NF-κB signaling pathways include the classical (canonical) and alternative
  (noncanonical) routes. The classical NF-κB signaling pathway is activated by factors
  such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and Toll-like receptor
  ligands including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as through the activation of
  T cell and B cell receptors. This pathway plays a critical role in regulating gene
  expression associated with inflammation, cell proliferation, survival, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. However, the alternative NF-κB
  signaling pathway is initiated by molecules such as lymphotoxin (LT), receptor activator
  of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), CD40 ligand (CD40L), and B cell-activating factor (BAFF).
  It primarily induces genes essential for the formation and maintenance of secondary
  lymphoid structures and associated components within the tumor microenvironment
  (TME). While LPS can also stimulate the alternative pathway to a lesser extent,
  LT, RANKL, CD40L, and BAFF retain the classical pathway activation capacity as well
