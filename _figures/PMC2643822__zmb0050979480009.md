caption: Model for apoptin-activated signaling. Apoptin interacts with the SH3 domain
  of PI3-K, resulting in its constitutive activation, which leads to PDK1-dependent
  Akt activation and nuclear translocation of Akt. Nuclear Akt activates CDK2 by both
  direct and indirect mechanisms, including the proteasome-dependent degradation of
  p27Kip1. The activated CDK2 phosphorylates, among other substrates, apoptin at Thr-108
  and thereby enforces its nuclear accumulation in cancer cells. The abnormal CDK2
  activation, which might also involve apoptin-induced inhibition of APC/C, directly
  or indirectly influences the activity of regulators of the mitochondrial apoptotic
  pathway, including Nur77, Bcl-2, Bim, and others.
