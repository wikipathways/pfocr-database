caption: Schematic overview of proposed CCN3-mediated signaling pathways in placental
  diseases PE and AIP. This figure summarizes the results of this study and showed
  the proposed signaling pathway of CCN3 in placentas of PE and AIP diseases. In early-onset
  preeclamptic placentas, CCN3 may promote STB and CCT cell cycle progression via
  p21/Cyclin E1/pRB and FAK/Akt/mTOR pathway. We speculate that the invasion and migration
  capacities of the EVT may be decreased by subsequently inhibiting FAK/Akt pathway
  and cleaved Notch/p21 signaling. Increased p53 expression can induce cell apoptosis
  and decreased p21 that also inducing cell apoptosis, which may result in PE. However,
  in the late AIP group, CCN3 may mediate cell cycle arrest by bringing about senescence
  which is advantageous for the differentiation from CTB to STB and EVT. Furthermore,
  CCN3 may enhance invasion and migration capacities of the trophoblast by activating
  FAK/Akt pathway. Although an increase in p53 may increase the apoptosis of trophoblast
  cells, increased p21 may also promote cell viability through an anti-apoptotic pathway,
  which may contribute to the AIP disease. CCT, cell column trophoblast; EVT, extravillous
  trophoblast; STB, syncytiotrophoblast.
