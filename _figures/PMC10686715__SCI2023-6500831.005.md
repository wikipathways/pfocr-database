caption: Exosomes secreted by different sources of MSCs regulate the inflammatory
  microenvironment after myocardial infarction. (a) MiR-200b-3p in extracellular vesicles
  (EVs) secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) inhibits the activation of NLRP1
  by inhibiting the expression of Bcl-2-like protein 11 (Bcl2L11), which effectively
  inhibits the inflammatory response after myocardial infarction (MI). MiR-302d-3p
  in EVs derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) regulates the post-MI
  inflammatory microenvironment by mediating the BCL6/MD2/NF-κB axis. MiR-25-3p in
  exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSC-Exos) inhibits the
  inflammatory response of ischemic myocardial injury by downregulating enhancer of
  zest homolog 2 (EZH2) and inhibiting suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3)
  expression. (b) BMMSC-Exos regulate the postinfarction cardiac microenvironment
  by upregulating p27kip1 and downregulating CDK2 to inhibit the proliferation of
  CD3+ T cells after MI and inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of B cells.
  MiR-181a in exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSC-Exos)
  can significantly inhibit the inflammatory response and increase the proportion
  of Treg cells by targeting the inflammatory transcription factor c-fos, thereby
  inhibiting T-cell proliferation. (c) MiR-182 in BMMSC-Exos targets the TLR4/NF-κB/PI3K/AKT
  signaling cascade to promote M1-to-M2 polarization of macrophages. Meanwhile, BMMSC-Exos
  can promote macrophage differentiation to the M2 phenotype through miR-21-5p, thereby
  reducing inflammation. Exosomes derived from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells
  (ADMSC-Exos) promote macrophage M2 polarization and cardiac repair by activating
  S1P/SK1/S1PR1 signal transduction. BMMSC-Exos overexpressing fibronectin type III
  domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) play an anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting
  the NF-κB signaling pathway and promoting the polarization of M2 macrophages
