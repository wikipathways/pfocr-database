caption: 'Methionine (Met) metabolic cycle. Met is converted to homocysteine Hcys
  via a series of enzymatic reactions in a process known as transmethylation (TM).
  Met is first converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM has 2 possible fates:
  it is the major methyl donor for methylation reactions or it is used for polyamine
  synthesis. Upon its use for polyamines, SAM produces methylthioadenosine (MTA),
  whose disposal generates Met and adenine via a salvage pathway. When used as a methyl
  donor group, SAM forms S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH is converted by a reversible
  reaction to Hcys, which can be disposed via 2 pathways. In remethylation (RM) via
  methionine synthase, 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) donates the methyl group,
  and vitamin B12 is a required cofactor. Transsulfuration (TS) occurs only in a limited
  number of organs, and it disposes of Hcys via 2 enzymatic reactions that require
  vitamin B6 as a cofactor. The products of TS are cysteine and α-ketobutyrate, which
  enters into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and ultimately produces CO2. This
  diagram also illustrates the isotopic tracer used for the infusion studies and their
  metabolic fate. The isotopomer used in this study was [1-13C; methyl-2H3]methionine.
  This is converted via TM to [1-13C]homocysteine. This labeled homocysteine can enter
  TS and ultimately produce 13CO2 via the TCA cycle or enter RM to form [1-13C]methionine
  (not shown). THF, tetrahydrofolate.'
