caption: Proposed signaling pathways involved in the protective effect of CVB-D in
  septic cardiomyopathy. Cellular injury, ferroptosis and oxidative stress induced
  by LPS are attenuated by CVB-D. CVB-D downregulated cellular iron accumulation by
  alleviating cellular inflammatory responses. Furthermore, CVB-D also upregulated
  the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway. CVB-D may reduce the influx of calcium ions by inhibiting
  LTCCs, thus reducing myocardial injury. CVB-D, cyclovirobuxine D; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  LTCCs, L-type calcium channels; SLC7A11, solute carrier family 7 member 11; Nrf2,
  nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; p, phosphorylated; IL, interleukin; R, receptor; SLC3A2,
