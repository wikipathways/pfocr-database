caption: Production of unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids arise from
  a branch in the biosynthetic pathway at the 3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP intermediate.
  FabA is a unique 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase that is capable for forming trans-2-decenoyl-ACP
  and isomerizing this intermediate to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP. FabA is very selective
  for the 10-carbon substrates in vivo. FabB is absolutely required for the subsequent
  elongation of cis-3-decenoyl-ACP to 16:1-ACP. Interestingly, 16:1-ACP is a poor
  substrate for FabB, and its elongation to 18:1-ACP is controlled by the activity
  of FabF. FabF is a naturally temperature-sensitive enzyme, and this property account
  for the greater proportion of 18:1 in bacteria grown at low temperatures compared
  to those grown at higher temperatures. The trans-3-decenoyl-ACP is used by FabI
  followed by elongation by either FabB or FabF to form palmitic acid, the major saturated
  fatty acid in E. coli. The parentheses show isozymes from other bacteria that catalyze
  the reaction shown.
