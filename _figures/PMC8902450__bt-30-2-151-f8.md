caption: The anti-cancer effects of GA on A549 cells via PI3K/Akt pathway. GA inhibits
  PI3K/Akt pathway, and subsequently alters the expressions of Bax and Bcl-2. Increased
  Bax activates cleaved caspase-3, which induces apoptosis. GA also alters the expressions
  of p21 and p27 by regulating PI3K/Akt pathway, resulting in downregulation of Cyclin
  D1 and E1, which subsequently lead to cell cycle arrest.
