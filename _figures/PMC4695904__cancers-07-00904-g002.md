caption: Oncogenic miRNAs involved in the apoptotic pathway. Anti-apoptotic miRNAs
  exert their function in both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways by regulating
  pro-apoptotic mRNAs including caspases. Caspase 3-7-9 are downregulated by miR-106b-25
  cluster, miR let-7, miR-582-5p and miR-363. TRAIL ligand, involved in extrinsic
  pathway is downregulated by miR-22 and miR-222. Also PTEN, that promotes the formation
  of the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex Apoptosis, is regulated by several miRs.
  BCL-2 family members such as PUMA, BMF, BAX and BAK members, involved in intrinsic
  pathway, are downregulated by many anti-apoptotic miRNAs, which lead to resistance
  to apoptosis. FADD (Fas-Associated protein with Death Domain); TRAIL (TNF-Related
  Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand); DISC (Death-Inducing Signaling Complex); PTEN (Phosphatase
  and Tensin homolog); BMF (Bcl2 Modifying Factor); PUMA (BCL2 binding component 3);
  BIM (BCL2-like 11); BAX (BCL2-Associated X protein); BAK (BCL2-Antagonist/Killer
  1).
