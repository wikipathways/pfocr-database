caption: 'Schematics of the (h)GSH biosynthetic pathway. Depicted are also the enzymes
  forming the cysteine synthase complex, namely, serine acetyltransferase (SAT) and
  O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase (OASTL), as well as those involved in phytochelatin (PCn)
  and homophytochelatin (hPCn) synthesis. For the γECS enzyme, the redox switch is
  drawn as an equilibrium between the more active (oxidized) dimeric form and the
  less active (reduced) monomeric form. Other abbreviations not used in the text:
  O-Ac-Ser, O-acetylserine; γGlu-Cys, γ-glutamylcysteine.'
