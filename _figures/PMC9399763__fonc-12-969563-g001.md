caption: 'The methionine cycle in T cells. After entering T cells, methionine flows
  into the methionine cycle. The first step of the methionine cycle is the conversion
  of methionine into S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) by methionine adenosyltransferase
  II (MATII). SAM is converted into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) after donating a
  methyl group for methylation reactions. This step is mediated by Methyltransferases
  (MTs). SAH is then hydrolyzed by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) to generate
  homocysteine. Finally, homocysteine receives a methyl group from the folate cycle
  or betaine to become methionine, these reactions are mediated by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate:
  homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase
  (BHMT) respectively. The methionine cycle is interconnected with three important
  metabolic pathways by providing substrates. These pathways include the folate cycle,
  the transsulfuration pathway, the methionine salvage pathway, and polyamine synthesis,
  all of which support important cellular functions. DMG, dimethylglycine; 5-methyl-THF,
  5-methyltetrahydrofolate; THF, tetrahydrofolate; Glu-Cys, γ-glutamylcysteine; GSH,
  glutathione; MTA, 5′-Methylthioadenosine.'
