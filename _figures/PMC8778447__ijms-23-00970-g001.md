caption: 'Proposed molecular mechanisms of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum-mediated
  tumorigenesis in tumorous and nontumorous cells. Nontumorigenic pathways: (left).
  P. gingivalis promotes antiapoptosis by activating JAK1/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT prosurvival
  signaling pathways to inhibit caspase3 (casp3) and activate survivin. P. gingivalis-mediated
  activation of PI3K/AKT leads to the phosphorylation of Bad at serine residue 136
  and its activation results in its dissociation from antiapoptotic Bcl2 and Bcl-XL
  proteins, which enhances the antiapoptotic effect of the Bcl2 family reflected by
  the inhibition of apoptotic protein Bax. Furthermore, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are upregulated
  by P. gingivalis gigipain’s adhesin peptide A44, which also inhibits Casp9 activation
  at early stages. Inhibition of Bax impedes cytochrome c (cytc) release from the
  mitochondria and blocks the cleavage of casp9 and subsequent activation of effector
  caspase3, which obstructs the mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway. P. gingivalis
  inhibits P2X7 receptor (P2X7R)/NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production and subsequent
  apoptosis by blocking extracellular ATP (eATP) ligation to P2X7R through its ATP-scavenging
  enzyme, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK). Additionally, P. gingivalis induces
  antioxidant responses by increasing glutathione (GSH) levels intracellularly possibly
  by upregulating the uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). Carcinogenic pathways: (right).
  P. gingivalis activates protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4), which in turn activates
  the ERK1/2/Ets1 and p38/Hsp27 pathways resulting in pro-MMP9 production. P. gingivalis’s
  activation of PAR2 can mediate pro-MMP9 production via the NF-kB pathway. The cleaved
  active form of pro-MMP9 is MMP9. Metalloproteinase (MMP) families are involved in
  ECM and basement membrane degradation and enhance invasion in neoplastic cells.
  P. gingivalis through its virulent factor, a cysteine protease termed gingipain,
  can cleave pro-MMP9 into its active form MMP9. Gingipains consist of arginine-specific
  protease A (RgpA) and B (RgpB) and a lysine-specific protease (Kgp), which are responsible
  for the cleavage of pro-MMP9 into MMP9. Apple polyphenol (AP), hop bract polyphenol
  (HBP) and high-molecular weight HBP (HMW-HBP) are polyphenols that can inhibit the
  proteolytic activity of gingipains and can inhibit the PAR2/NF-kB release of pro-MMP9.
  Thus, P. gingivalis promotes invasion through gingipain-mediated activation of MMP9.
  F. nucleatum’s virulent factor FadA binds to the extracellular domain 5 (EC5) of
  E-cadherin receptor and activates β-catenin that stimulate cyclin D1 and Myc upregulation
  and binds to T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) to stimulate the secretion
  of Wnt7a, Wnt7b and Wnt9a, all of which promote cellular growth and proliferation.
  β-catenin enhances the production of cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and IL-18 and NF-kB1/2
  and promotes inflammation, an optimal microenvironment for the prosperity of cancerous
  cells. F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis can activate toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and
  mediate TNF-α and IL-6 cytokine production via the TLR2-NF-kB pathway. IL-6 stimulates
  the activation of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), which in turn activates STAT3, known
  to ultimately upregulate the production of cyclin D1 and promote cellular proliferation.'
