caption: Representation of the genes in glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and
  the TCA cycle. Genes identified as part of the growth modulon are highlighted in
  green and blue according to their gene expression profile. No genes of these pathways
  were found to exhibit the expression profiles of cluster 2 or 4.
