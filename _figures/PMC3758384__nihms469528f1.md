caption: A schematic drawing showing the main components of the circadian timing system
  in the mammalian brain. Arrows show neural pathways that convey these influences,
  but do not imply whether they are excitatory or inhibitory, which in some cases
  is not known. The neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) form a genetically
  based clock which is reset daily by the light cycle. The SCN drives some circadian
  rhythms, such as that of melatonin, by direct outputs to target cell groups such
  as the parventricular nucleus (PV), but most circadian rhythms are mediated by relays
  through the subparaventricular zone (SPZ). Body temperature is regulated by the
  dorsal SPZ via an unknown pathway. The ventral SPZ (vSPZ) drives the dorsomedial
  nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH), which in turn is responsible for circadian rhythms
  of wake-sleep, locomotion, feeding, and corticosteroid secretion, and can also reset
  the body temperature cycle. During periods of restricted feeding (food available
  for only a few hours a day during the normal inactive period), a second genetic
  clock is activated in the compact part of the DMH (DMc) that is set to the time
  of the food availability and can drive cycles of activity and body temperature that
  anticipate the feeding time. ARC, arcuate hypothalamic nucleus; OC, optic chiasm;
  PV, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus; PVd, dorsal parvicellular PV; PVm, medial
  parvicellular PV; nucleusVLPO, ventrolateral preoptic nucleus. Zeitgebers are in
  red; cell groups outlined in tan; circadian functions in blue.
