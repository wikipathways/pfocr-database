caption: Metabolism as a driver of T cell function. During its life cycle, T cells
  rely on specific metabolic pathways to satisfy the energy demand during differentiation
  and activation. Mature naive T cells (TN) that exit from the thymus are more reliant
  on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Upon encounter with antigen, T cells undergo
  proliferation and preferentially engage aerobic glycolysis through the action of
  mTOR to sustain the requirements of proliferation and effector function. The antigen-specific
  activated effector T cell (TEFF) resulting from clonal expansion is metabolically
  distinct as it engages both aerobic glycolysis and OXPHOS pathway. Differentiation
  of effector T cells to memory T cells (TMEM), switches the metabolic phenotype back
  to OXPHOS driven by fatty acid oxidation (FAO). However, upon secondary antigen
  exposure, TMEM cells rely on both OXPHOS and glycolysis to facilitate recall response.
  Chronic antigenic stimulation and exposure to inhibitory ligands can lead to a decline
  in T cell function, referred to as T cell exhaustion (TEX), which sees a marked
  reduction in both OXPHOS and glycolic activity.
