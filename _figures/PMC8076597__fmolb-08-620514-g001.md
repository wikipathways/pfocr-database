caption: The mechanism of drug-induced ERS caused drug resistance in intrinsic direction.
  Drugs induce ERS by ROS accumulation and Ca2+ overload. UPR is activated when ERS
  occurs. GRP78, which originally binds to the UPR sensors (i.e., PERK, IRE1α, and
  ATF6), inhibits their activation. GRP78 can upregulate the expression of lncRNA
  MIAT and Akt by positively regulating the expression of OCT4. AKT phosphorylation
  leads to drug resistance by promoting the proliferation of tumor cells. PERK trans-autophosphorylates
  after the dissociation of GRP78 and phosphorylates downstream eIF2α, which in turn
  activates CHOP by regulating the expression of ATF4. CHOP promotes protective autophagy,
  which leads to drug resistance by inhibiting mTORC1 and promoting the expression
  of the ATG5–ATG12–ATG16L complex. CHOP is also a mediator of apoptosis. miR-146a
  induces drug resistance by inhibiting CHOP-mediated apoptosis. Some intracellular
  drugs are pumped out of the tumor cells by P-gp that is increased by PERK, which
  in turn reduced drug-induced solid tumor cell apoptosis and led to drug resistance.
  IRE1α is activated after dissociating from GRP78, and the downstream XBP1 upregulates
  the expression of HSF1. HSF1 upregulates the expression of BAG3, which stabilizes
  the expression of antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, thereby inhibiting apoptosis and
  leading to drug resistance. In addition, both IRE1α and ATF6 promote the expression
  of XBP1 and downstream HSF1. HSF1 promotes the expression of Beclin-1 through the
  RIPK1-MAPK8/9 axis, inducing protective autophagy that leads to drug resistance.
  IRE1α also triggers the Wnt signaling pathway and NF-κB to promote solid tumor cell
  survival, which subsequently leads to drug resistance.
