caption: Activation of synaptic NMDAR mediates survival pathway and induces LTP and
  LTD. In classical synaptic plasticity model, synaptic NMDAR activity activates CaMKII
  and phosphatases, which triggers LTP and LTD, respectively. Moreover, the activation
  of synaptic NMDARs suppresses the pro-apoptotic signaling molecules and pathways
  such as caspases, APAF1 and Puma occurred in cytoplasm; and it also promotes the
  expression of the pro-survival transcriptional factors such as CREB and suppresses
  the expression of pro-apoptotic transcription factors such as FOXO and p53, which,
  in turn, inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell survival.
