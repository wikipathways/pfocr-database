caption: 'Metabolic control of T-cell related to tryptophan metabolism. Inflammatory
  cytokines like interferon known to enhance expression of key enzyme IDO. This results
  in tryptophan depletion as majority of the resident tryptophan is metabolized via
  KP, and increase in KYN. Depletion of Tryptophan activates the GCN2 kinase pathway
  and inhibits mTOR pathway. KYN can enhance AhR/mTOR activity, and may increase the
  risk of thrombosis in anti-phospholipid syndrome. KYN also through AhR/mTOR can
  increase Th17 differentiation and block Treg differentiation. GCN2 kinase pathway
  can inhibit mTOR activity and enhance autophagy. IDO inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors,
  and GCN2 agonist are some of the potential targets in this pathway that can be utilized
  to treat autoimmune diseases. Note: KYN = Kynurenine, KP = KYN pathway; IDO = indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase; AhR = aryl hydrocarbon receptor; mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin;
  GCN 2 = General Control Nonderepressible; TNF = tumour necrosis factor, IL = interleukin;
  IFN = interferon.'
