caption: Pathway for conversion of sphingosine to glycerophospholipid. The generation
  of sphingosine 1-phosphate is shown in . The enzyme sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase
  cleaves sphingosine 1-phosphate to generate phosphoethanolamine and hexadecenal.
  As shown, both the molecules trace two independent pathways. Phosphoethanolamine
  is converted to CDP-ethanolamine, followed by its sequential conversion to phosphatidylethanolamine.
  Hexadecenal enters the route to be converted to palmitoyl-coenzyme A via a series
  of intermediate steps, and could then re-enter the sphingolipid synthesis pathway.
  Sgpl, Sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase; Pcyt2, phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase;
  and Cept, cytidine 5′-diphosphate-ethanolamine phospholtransferase. The metabolites
  shown in orange and the enzymes shown in blue were measured in this study.
