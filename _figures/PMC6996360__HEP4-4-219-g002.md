caption: 'Genes involved in Wnt, PI3K‐Akt, MAPK, TGF‐β, microsatellite instability,
  and p53 signaling pathways were differentially expressed during developmental BA.
  Hepatobiliary transcriptomes at four landmark stages during developmental BA (M0,
  M2, M5, and JV) were analyzed with KEGG pathway mapping. Genes up‐regulated are
  highlighted in red, whereas genes down‐regulated are highlighted in green. Genes
  showing both red and green are up‐regulated or down‐regulated at different developmental
  stages. Dashed lines represent intermediate signaling steps omitted in the diagram.
  Abbreviations: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli protein; APPL, adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine
  interacting with PH domain and leucine zipper 1; Bad, BCL2 associated agonist of
  cell death; BAX, BCL2 associated X; CASP, caspase; DCC, deleted in colorectal carcinoma;
  GSK‐3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; M0, larval stage; LEF, lymphoid enhancer binding
  factor; M2, metamorphic stage 2; M5, metamorphic stage 5; MSI, microsatellite instability;
  +p, phosphorylation; RalGDS, Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator; TCF,
  transcription factor.'
