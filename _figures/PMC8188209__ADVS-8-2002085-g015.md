caption: Complement activation. Complement system is composed of three different pathways.
  The classical pathway (CP) is activated by immune complex formation on pathogen
  surface and by calreticulin expressed on apoptotic cells, leading to C1 complex
  association. The LP recognizes mannose‐terminating glycan on pathogens leading to
  MBL MASP complex activation. Both induce formation of the classical C3 convertases
  C4b2b. The AP is permanently activated at low level by spontaneous hydrolysis of
  C3 into C3 (H2O). Lack of complement inhibitor on pathogens induces alternative
  C3 convertase activation C3bBb. Complement activation leads to opsonization and
  phagocytosis by C3b deposition, bacterial lysis by C5b–9 complex formation and inflammation
  by recruitment of immune cells, endothelial and epithelial cell activation, and
  platelet activation. Membrane cofactor protein (MCP), decay accelerating factor
  (DAF), complement receptor 1 (CR1), and C4 binding protein (C4BP) inhibit the complement
  activation by the classical pathway. DAF, MCP, CR1, and Factor H inhibit the complement
  activation by the AP.
