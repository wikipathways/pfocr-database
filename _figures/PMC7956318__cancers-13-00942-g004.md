caption: Pathway of prostanoid synthesis and their respective receptors. Phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2) facilitates arachidonic acid production by acting on membrane phospholipids.
  Arachidonic acid is converted to many different prostanoids (PGE2, Thromboxane A2,
  PGI2, PGF2α and PGD2) via the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. These prostaglandins then
  mediate their functions through respective receptors. Figure adapted from Majumder
  et al., (2018) [].
