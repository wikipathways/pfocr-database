caption: 'The role of corrins in the acetyl‐CoA pathway. (A) The acetyl‐CoA pathway,
  redrawn from references [49, 54]. Methyl synthesis: pterin‐dependent methyl synthesis
  in the acetyl‐CoA pathway of bacteria and archaea from H2 and CO2 [49]. ACS, acetyl‐CoA
  synthase [53]; CODH, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase [55]; CoFeS, corrinoid iron–sulphur
  protein [52]; PFOR, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase [54]. The methyl group is
  highlighted in red, the corrinoid cobalt atom in blue, the proximal nickel atom
  of the ACS active site [53] in green and enzyme names or steps are given in sepia
  letters. (B) Corrinoid‐dependent methyl transfer from a pterin cofactor to the active
  site metal cluster (A‐cluster) of acetyl‐CoA synthase (ACS) (PDB ID: 7ZKJ [56])
  in the acetyl‐CoA pathway of acetogens and methanogens. The corrinoid iron–sulphur
  protein CoFeS catalyzes the methyl‐transfer reaction, in some cases aided by a separate
  methyltransferase (MeTr) [52, 57]. H4F and H4MPT: tetrahydrofolate and tetrahydromethanopterin,
  respectively. R1 = –H in H4F and –CH3 in H4MPT.For the chemical structure of R2,in
  H4F and H4MPT, , see[58]. Methylcobalamin is shown in the base‐off configuration
  [59], with –R3 replacing the nucleotide loop. Methyl groups derived from S‐adenosylmethionine
  (SAM) are shown in blue. Fe atoms are shown in orange, S atoms in yellow and Ni
  atoms in green. Lower left: Examples of two cobamide lower ligands (–R3 in A); 5‐hydroxybenzimidazole
  (HBI) is found in the cobinamides of some methanogens [39], while 5,6‐dimethylbenzimidazole
  (DMB, the lower ligand base of cobalamin) is found in some bacteria [52]. (C) Native
  metals catalyze formate, acetate and pyruvate synthesis from H2 and CO2 over Ni0,
  Fe0, Co0, Ni3Fe and other alloys [60, 61, 62, 63, 64], identifying a nonenzymatic,
  geochemical precursor of corrin‐dependent methyl transfer shown in panels A and
  B. More is known about the enzymatic reaction mechanisms [53] than about the metal‐catalyzed
  forerunners [60, 61, 62, 63, 64]. The catalyst‐bound methyl groups in panel C are
  probable intermediates in the reaction mechanism, as methanol and methane are sometimes
  observed as products [60, 61]. In some experiments, Fe3S4 and Fe3O4 are effective
  as catalysts, but it cannot be excluded that these catalysts are reduced to Fe0
  at some sites during the reaction with H2'
