caption: The synthesis of the linker (initiation) to that of heparosan (polymerisation)
  are shown with thick black arrows. The decision step following linker synthesis
  is where transfer of a GalNAc by CGAT1/2 to the tetrasaccharide linker leads to
  CS/DS biosynthesis and of a GlcNAc by EXTL3 to HS. The modification step is in two
  parts. Black arrows with red disaccharides denote the canonical pathway, blue arrows
  and blue disaccharides the minor pathway. Enzyme abbreviations are according to
  UniProt
