caption: Proposed pathway of cytosolic jadomycin-induced ROS and their metabolism
  within MCF7 breast cancer cells. Jadomycin-mediated ROS generation and cytotoxicity
  is enhanced by CuSO4 and blocked by the Cu(II)-chelating agent d-Pen, indicating
  intracellular ROS are being induced through a nonenzymatic reaction between jadomycins
  and intracellular Cu(II). The ability of DDC to enhance jadomycin cytotoxicity implicates
  cytosolic superoxide as a primary mediator of jadomycin cytotoxicity. Furthermore,
  it indicates SOD1 conversion of superoxide to H2O2 is an important step in the neutralization
  of jadomycin-induced ROS. The abilities of the GST inhibitor EA and TrxR inhibitor
  auranofin to enhance and the glutathione precursor NAC to inhibit jadomycin-mediated
  ROS generation and cytotoxicity indicates that H2O2 is also a mediator of jadomycin
  cytotoxicity, and that the subsequent conversion of H2O2 to H2O by the GST/GPx and
  Trx/Prx antioxidant pathways are important for jadomycin detoxification. Lack of
  an effect by the catalase inhibitor 3-AT suggests this antioxidant pathway is not
  vital in the cellular metabolism of jadomycin-induced ROS. Italicized compounds
  represent inhibitors (−) or promoters (+) used with arrows depicting where they
  exert their effects within the ROS metabolism pathway. Species in bold represent
  ROS. Oxidized species are labeled with (ox.).
