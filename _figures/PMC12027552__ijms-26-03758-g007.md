caption: 'Correlation network diagram of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and
  differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) in the plant hormone signal transduction
  pathway under the FR treatment. CK: The red-to-blue light ratio is maintained at
  7:3 (7R3B); FR: 7R3B + far red light. Diamonds represent metabolites, and circles
  represent genes, with the correlation between them shown using straight lines. Positive
  correlations are represented by orange or yellow lines, while negative correlations
  are represented by green or blue lines, and the larger the absolute value of the
  correlation coefficient, the darker the color of the lines. The larger the gene
  or metabolite node, the larger the degree of enrichment. The node color represents
  the log2 fold change (log2 FC) in the expression difference in differentially expressed
  genes or metabolites, with colors leaning toward orange indicating log2 FC > 0,
  and colors leaning toward blue indicating log2 FC < 0'
