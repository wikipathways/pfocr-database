caption: Consequences of dysregulated Wnt/b-catenin signaling on HIV replication in
  the CNS. HIV crosses the blood–brain barrier either through migration of HIV-infected
  monocytes or possibly transcytosis of cell-free virus that infects macrophages/microglia
  in the brain parenchyma. Infected cells begin to produce viral particles, inflammatory
  mediators (IFNγ), and viral proteins (Tat, gp120, Vpr) that lead to further activation
  and/or infection of local macrophages and microglia and contribute to dysregulation
  of the Wnt/ β-catenin pathway in neurons and glia. Dysregulated Wnt/ β-catenin signaling
  (a) primes astrocytes to support productive HIV infection and enhances HIV replication
  in macrophages/microglia and (b) contributes to dysregulation and/or apoptosis of
  neurons and glia. Active HIV replication, in turn, amplifies production of inflammatory
  mediators and HIV verotoxins that cause further dysregulation and/or apoptosis of
  CNS cells as well as recruitment of leukocytes into the brain
