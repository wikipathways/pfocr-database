caption: (A) When proteins with ER retention sequences move along the secretory pathway
  they encounter KDEL receptors in the cis-Golgi. KDEL rectors recognize the carboxy
  terminus ER retention sequence of these proteins and traffic the proteins back to
  the ER lumen. (B) KDEL receptors in the plasma membrane modulate cell surface binding
  of ERS-containing proteins. Following ER stress, there is an increase in KDEL receptors
  found at the cell surface. (C) ERS-containing proteins that escape from the ER interact
  with KDEL receptors in the Golgi. The KDEL receptor-protein complex moves from the
  Golgi to the ER through COPI-mediated retrograde transport and the ER protein is
  release into the ER lumen. (D) ER stress leads to dissociation of BiP and IRE1α
  complexes, allowing for IRE1α oligomerization. Auto-phosphorylation of oligomerized
  IRE1α activates its kinase and RNase activities to initiate XBP1 splicing. Spliced
  XBP1 translocates to the nucleus to induce transcription of UPR genes, like the
  KDEL receptors.
