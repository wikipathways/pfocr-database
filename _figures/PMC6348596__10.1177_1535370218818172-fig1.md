caption: 'Glial immune interactions. Following ischemic-stroke signaling, mediators
  trigger glial and immune cell responses leading to inhibition or stimulation of
  neuronal cell death. These mediators include PAMPs, LPS, DAMPs, and cytokines: IL-4,
  IL-13, IL-10, IL-15, IL-1α, IFNγ, TNF-α, C1q, and IL-2. When microglia are activated
  by PAMPs or DAMPs, they change from a resting state to anti-inflammatory state (M2)
  or pro-inflammatory state (M1), respectively. Microglia in the M1 state can activate
  resting astrocytes causing their phenotypic shift into reactive astrocytes, resulting
  in neuronal cell death and exacerbating infarct damage. Microglia in the resting
  state which express PD-L1 can inhibit CD8+ T-cells by binding to their PD-1 receptor.
  Activation of astrocytes post-ischemic stroke leads to trans-presentation of IL-15,
  NK cells, and CD8+ T-cells which facilitate neuronal cell death. Monocyte activation
  following infarction leads to a dominant M2 microglial/monocyte phenotype resulting
  in the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Helper T-cells (Th1), IL-2, IFNγ,
  glutamate clearance, and mast cells in the brain have been shown to play neuroprotective
  roles to inhibit damaging effects of ischemic stroke. Green arrows represent stimulation.
  Lines with blunted ends (red) represent inhibition. The dashed red line represents
  inhibition of the PD-L1: PD-1 pathway only. See text for details. CCR2: CC chemokine
  receptor 2; PAMPs: pathogen-associated molecular patterns; LPS: lipopolysaccharides;
