caption: Regulation of Redox Balance by DHFR-TS3 and Coupling of Folate Metabolism
  with ROS Scavenging and Thymidylate Synthesis.DHFR-TS3 inhibits DHFR-TS1 and DHFR-TS2,
  thereby lowering the folate level and causing a decrease in the conversion of 5,10-methylene-THF
  to 5,10-methenyl-THF, catalyzed by MTHFD. This results in a lower NADPH production
  leading to a decrease in GSH recycling rate through the glutathione-ascorbate cycle
  (Asada-Halliwell pathway) and, consequently, to an increased ROS abundance. dTMP,
  deoxythymidine monophosphate; dUMP, deoxyuridine monophosphate; 5,10-CH2-THF, 5,10-methylene
