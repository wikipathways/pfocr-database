caption: Tubulin folding cofactor D (TBCD) cooperates with Dscam during neuronal morphogenesis.(A,
  B) Schemes of wild-type (A) and TBCD mutant (B) projection neurons. (A) The dendrite
  of a wild-type projection neuron targets a single glomerulus (black circle) in the
  antennal lobe (pink circles), and the axon elongates to the mushroom body (MB; gray
  circle) and the lateral horn (LH; gray circle). (B) The dendrite of a TBCD mutant
  projection neuron targets the correct glomerulus (black circle) and makes ectopic
  branches (white circle). The axon of the TBCD mutant projection neuron degenerates
  soon after eclosion. (C) Model for the downstream of Dscam. Dscam makes a complex
  with Dock, DSH3PX, and Wasp, affecting the actin cytoskeleton. The intracellular
  domain of Dscam interacts with TBCD, regulating microtubule dynamics. In human,
  PAK1 binds and phosphorylates TBCB. The Dock/Pak signaling pathway and tubulin-folding
  cofactors may coordinate with each other during neuronal morphogenesis.
