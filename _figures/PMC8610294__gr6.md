caption: Activation of signaling cascades in plants after pathogenic infection. PR
  proteins are diverse proteins induced by different phytopathogens and signaling
  molecules. After pathogen attack defense signaling pathways (SA and JA) activated
  which leads to the accumulation of PR proteins and minimizes the pathogen disease.
  PR genes activated by the accumulation of SA and JA through selective transcription
  factors NPR1 and MYC, respectively. PR proteins activated SAR pathway which induces
  the expression of PR1 and PR2 and PR5, while JA pathway expresses PR3, PR4, and
  PR12 genes in a sequential manner which leads to accumulating local product to provide
  local acquired resistance (LAR). The pathway indicated that JA signaling triggers
  resistance against necro-trophic pathogens.
