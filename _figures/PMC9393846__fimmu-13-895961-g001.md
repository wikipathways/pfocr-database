caption: Antitumor immune responses can be activated by chromosome instability (CIN)
  and aneuploidy in many ways. In cells with CIN, lagging chromosomes form micronuclei,
  which are prone to rupture, and DNA is then exposed to the cytosol to activate the
  cGAS-STING pathway, further inducing an antitumor type I interferon response. Gene
  dosage changes resulting from CIN/aneuploidy lead to protein imbalances, followed
  by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ER stress increases the expression of activating
  natural killer (NK) cell ligands and redistributes endogenous calreticulin (CRT)
  to the surface of the plasma membrane, which are recognized by and activate NK cells
  and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), respectively, to eliminate transformed cells
  by innate and adaptive immune responses. ER stress also promotes cells with CIN/aneuploidy
  to acquire a senescence phenotype and to secrete a broad range of mediators to create
  an antitumor immunoenvironment. In addition, DNA damage resulting from a replication/repair
  machinery shortage, exposure to the cytosol, and oxidation, along with complicated
  DNA rearrangement, can increase the immunogenicity of CIN/aneuploid cells by creating
  many potential neoantigens.
