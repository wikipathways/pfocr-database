caption: 'Analysis tools and their enhanced functions in SysPTM2.0. (A) Exploration
  of ERBB signaling pathway regulated by phosphorylation and acetylation in both individual
  and combinatorial manners. PTMs on pathways are colored by mapping user-queried
  proteins into the KEGG reference pathways. Each color indicates a specified PTM
  type, e.g. purple denotes phosphorylation, orange denotes acetylation, green box
  indicates the presence of multiple modifications in one protein; (B) PTMPhylog searching
  result of human H31 protein (P68431). ECRs calculated by Rate4Sites are represented
  with red background, and EC-PTMs are colored with blue background; (C) PTM cluster
  result of human H31 (P68431) calculated from PTMCluster. The known PTM site clusters
  can be queried by either keywords or protein sequences at PTMCluster. User can also
  upload or define PTM sites to calculate site clusters in a real-time manner. Protein
  domains are shown in gray and site clusters are shown by yellow. PTM sites contained
  in the cluster are marked in the upper and lower sides of the protein box (upper:
  PTM sites from SysPTM-A, lower: PTM sites from SysPTM-B); (D) The top 20 enriched
  GO terms identified by PTMGO using human proteome acetylation data in (). The top
  enriched GO terms were identified by the elim algorithm. Rectangles indicate the
  most significant terms. Color represents the relative significance, ranging from
  dark red (most significant) to bright yellow (least significant). The GO identifier
  is displayed for each node.'
