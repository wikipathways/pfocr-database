caption: 'Two states of the Hippo pathway in the mammalian tumor microenvironment.
  Note: When the Hippo signaling pathway is activated, MST1/2 kinases, together with
  SAV1, phosphorylate and activate LATS1/2. LATS1/2, in conjunction with MOB1A/B,
  phosphorylates YAP and TAZ. The phosphorylated YAP/TAZ binds to 14-3–3 proteins
  and is sequestered in the cytoplasm, leading to suppression of YAP/TAZ activity.
  Additionally, phosphorylated YAP/TAZ undergoes ubiquitination mediated by casein
  kinase 1 (CK1) and β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), followed by
  proteasomal degradation. Conversely, when the Hippo signaling pathway is inactivated
  or suppressed, YAP/TAZ becomes dephosphorylated and activated, translocates into
  the nucleus, and binds to TEAD transcription factors. This interaction drives the
  transcription of oncogenic genes, promoting tumor growth, proliferation, and migration'
