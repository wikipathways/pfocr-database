caption: Necroptosis pathway. TNFα is the predominant upstream signalling component
  of necroptosis apoptosis.TNF-α activates TNFR1, which recruits scaffolding proteins
  TRADD, TRAF2, RIPK1 and cIAP1/2 to form plasma membrane-associated complex I. Linear
  ubiquitination stabilises complex I, which activates the NF-κB signalling pathway,
  leading to cell survival. When NF-κB is inhibited, complex IIa is activated, initiating
  apoptosis. Disruption of the signalling checkpoint early in cell survival leads
  to induction of complex IIb, which induces apoptosis via activated Caspase-8. When
  Caspase-8 is inhibited, phosphorylated RIPK1 and phosphorylated RIPK3 recruit and
  phosphorylate their substrate MLKL to form the necrosome complex. Activated MLKL
  oligomerises and migrates to the plasma membrane, thereby triggering necroptosis.
