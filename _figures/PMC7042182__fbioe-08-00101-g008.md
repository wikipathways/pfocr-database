caption: The sketch map of the signaling axis with the most significant co-expression
  pattern including YY1 (Yin and Yang 1 Transcription Factor), Hepatitis A Virus Cellular
  Receptor 2 (HAVCR2) and mTOR signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study inferred
  that the mechanism of YY1 regulating HAVCR2 and mTOR signaling pathway in the NK
  cells and the cellular communication between NK cells and CD14 + monocytes might
  play an important role in chronic phase of SCI and neuropathic pain.
