caption: The alternative splicing and immune function of RLRs-mediated signaling pathways
  in response to viral infection in teleost fish. RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2, MAVS, MITA, TBK1,
  IRF3 and IFN1 undergo alternative splicing. RIG-Ia functions as an enhancer in the
  RIG-Ib/MAVS-mediated signaling pathway, MDA5b as an enhancer in the MDA5a/MAVS-mediated
  signaling pathway, LGP2b as a negative regulator for LGP2a-elicited antiviral signaling.
  MAVS_tv1 cooperates with RIG-Ib in a positive feedback loop and enhances RIG-Ib-mediated
  antiviral signaling, whereas MAVS_tv2 synergizes with MDA5a and enhances MAVS_tv2-mediated
  antiviral signaling. MAVS_tv2 may also function as a negative regulator of IFN1
  by targeting IRF7. The function of those splicing isoforms of MITA, TBK1 and IRF3
  is still unclear at present, and need to be further investigated, which were indicated
  by the arrows with “?”. Importantly, fish possess a functional intracellular IFN
  system. The cross-regulation among excellular and intracellular IFN system function
  as a positive feedback loop in RLRs-MAVS signaling pathways. In the signaling schematics,
  the signaling pathways mediated by splicing isoforms are marked with red arrows,
  black arrows for normal form or wild type of PRRs signaling molecules, bidirectional
  arrows for the interaction between different PRRs signaling molecules. The broken
  arrow indicates that the direct interaction need to be confirmed.
