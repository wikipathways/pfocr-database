caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed signaling pathway underlying functional
  hyperemia deficits in EC-EGFR-KO mice. Whisker stimulation and subsequent neuronal
  activation, which increases perivascular K+ during neuronal repolarization, results
  in Kir2.1 channel activation in capillary ECs. Kir2.1 channel-initiated hyperpolarizing
  vasodilatory signal rapidly propagates upstream and dilates the precapillary arteriole,
  increasing downstream tissue perfusion. This local increase in blood flow in neuronally
  active regions of the brain is termed functional hyperemia, which is detected using
  laser Doppler flowmetry in this study. Genetic deletion of EGFR disrupts functional
  hyperemia in response to whisker stimulation by causing Kir2.1 channel dysfunction,
  which is likely attributed to lowering the level of PIP2, an essential co-factor
  of Kir2.1 channels.
