caption: Figure 2. Necroptosis induced by the DAI pathway. Cell survival (left panel)
  and cell death (right panel) signals transmitted by the DNA-dependent activator
  of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI) are schematically depicted. Pro-survival signaling
  involves the activation of IRF-3 and NFκB to support antiviral responses (left panel).
  Type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines are the main effectors induced by IRF-3/NFκB
  activation. In contrast, DAI activates RIP3 to induce necroptosis during viral infection,
  provided that caspases are inhibited. When viruses express caspase inhibitors, the
  RIP1/RIP3 necrosome plays a dominant role in the activation of cell death via necroptosis
  (right panel). If caspase-8 is active, RIP3 should get inactivated and apoptosis
  should be the dominant phenotype, though this scheme has not yet been experimentally
  confirmed. The mechanisms determining the choice between these two signaling pathways
  are unknown.
