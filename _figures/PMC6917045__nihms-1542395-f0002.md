caption: The ufmylation pathway can control different physiological processes depending
  on the stimuli and cellular background. A. The UFM1 pathway is canonically associated
  with the ER stress response (UPR, See  for details) and its expression is controlled
  by the major transcription factor XBP1s. The genetic deletion of the pathway engages
  ER-dependent apoptosis in many different background and its expression helps to
  cope with pharmacologically induced ER stress. B. Plasma B-Cell differentiation
  is activated by exposure to LPS, which induces a transcriptional increase in UFM1
  pathway interactor UFBP1 through XBP1s expression. UFBP1 represses the activation
  of the sensors IRE1 and PERK as a feedback response and promotes ER expansion, allowing
  immunoglobulin production. C. In breast cancer cell lines, exposure to estradiol
  (E2) promotes the interaction of the nuclear receptor ERα to ASC1 and subsequent
  poly-ufmylation. ASC1 ufmylation forms a scaffold to recruit p300 and SRC and activate
  cell proliferation. ASC1 is also a critical regulator of hematopoietic stem cells
  differentiation, and genetic deletion of ufmylation components is correlated with
  pancytopenia in a genetic mouse model. Overall, the ufmylation pathway appears to
  regulate cell fate either by reducing or preventing ER stress, or through transcriptional
  programs.
