caption: The characteristics, regulators and effects of the epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT). The EMT is an orderly process whereby epithelial cells lose their
  phenotype and gradually acquire the phenotype of mesenchymal cells. This process
  is accompanied by changes in the physical contacts between cells as well as in cellular
  polarity, cellular morphology, and biomarkers. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway cooperates
  with other signaling pathways, either directly or indirectly, to induce the EMT.
  This results in enhanced tumor aggressiveness, including proliferation, apoptosis
  resistance, invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance.
