caption: Activity-dependent gene expression in neurons. In response to membrane depolarization
  and neurotransmitters, an influx of calcium occurs through ligand- and voltage-gated
  ion channels, resulting in a rise of intracellular calcium levels. This activates
  both Ras-MAPK and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMK IV) pathways
  leading to the phosphorylation of CREB (pCREB). Within the nucleus, pCREB activates
  the transcription of their target genes, including bdnf and c-fos. BDNF protein
  is synthesized from their transcripts and released extracellularly. By binding to
  TrkB receptors, BDNF can augment the Ras-MAPK pathway, causing further phosphorylation
  of CREB.
