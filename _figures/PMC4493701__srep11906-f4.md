caption: Furthermore, under the tandem mass spectrometry positive scan mode condition,
  the parent compound GLB was detected as protonated molecular ions at m/z 499 ([M+H]+)
  and sodium adduct (520, [M+Na]+), and fragment ion m/z 441, respectively (). The
  metabolite M1 was detected as protonated molecular ions at m/z 529 ([M+H]+) and
  sodium adduct (m/z 553, [M+Na]+), and fragment ions m/z 457, 449, 435 and 401, respectively.
  These molecular ions were 32–34 Da (2O or 2OH) higher compared to the parent compound,
  may suggest modification of adding two hydroxyl groups into the molecule (). Therefore,
  M1 was tentatively identified as the di-hydroxylated metabolite and its possible
  metabolic pathway might be the di-hydroxylating reaction in phase I metabolism.
  On the other hand, the metabolite M2 produced protonated molecular ions at m/z 515
  ([M+H]+), m/z 537 ([M+Na]+), and fragment ions at m/z 457, 437 and 413, respectively.
  The molecular ions were 16–17 Da (O or OH) higher than the parent compound (), suggesting
  modification might be added one hydroxyl group into the parent molecule. Therefore,
  M2 could be tentatively identified as a hydroxylated metabolite. These results indicated
  that fragmentation pathway of GLB, M1 and M2 to support the metabolic site location,
  suggesting that di-hydroxylation (M1) and hydroxylation (M2) metabolisms might be
  the major metabolic pathways in rats. Furthermore, the present results showed that
  both of M1 and M2 had fragment ions at m/z 457, which might be attributed to the
  hydroxylation of the fructose group fraction ().
