caption: DDR components regulate JAK-STAT signaling pathways. After attachment of
  IFNs to its cell membrane receptors IFNAR1 or IFNAR2, the cytoplasmic domains of
  IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 enable the trans-phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2, one
  member of JAK tyrosine kinases) and JAK1. As phosphorylases, JAK1 phosphorylates
  STAT1/STAT2 to facilitate them forming a heterocomplex with IRF9, the IFN-stimulated
  gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex. After that, the ISGF3 translocates into the nuclei
  and combines the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) to induce ISG expression.
  To date, the FEN1, FANC1, BLM, or FANCD have been elucidated to participate in JAK-STAT
  signaling pathways. Compared to immune sensors, the JAK/STAT axis mainly functions
  as an effector of DNA-damage-induced immune response
