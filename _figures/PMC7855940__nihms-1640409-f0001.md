caption: 'Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) protein regions, functions,
  and applications. Amino acids (AAs) indicated in (a) are the major AAs that are
  vital for the APE1 functions shown in (b) []. The redox signaling region spans AA
  35–12,7 whereas the DNA repair region includes AA ~65–318. Lys at position 6 and
  7 affects the movement of APE1 from the nucleus to cytoplasm. Asp70 is involved
  in the 3′-phosphodiesterase activity of APE1, Lys98 is implicated in nucleotide
  incision repair (NIR), Arg 177 for base excision repair (BER) coordination, Asp210
  for general nuclease function, and Phe266 for 3′ to 5′-exonuclease.Cys involved
  in APE1 redox activity are Cys65, 93, and 99. The mitochondrial targeting sequence
  has been localized to AA 289–318. Maroon color reflects regions of APE1 functions
  and applications involved in redox signaling; gold indicates APE1 repair functions,
  nuclease functions and applications; green indicates mitochondrial targeting sequences;
  and blue indicates potential diagnosis applications. Red indicates redox inhibitors
  that have either reached clinical trials (APX3330) or are in the pre-investigation
  new drug (IND)-enabling stage for future clinical trials [,,]. (c) Applications
  that have been related to APE1 and potential indications for therapeutics or diagnosis
  of a variety of diseases. (d) Details of the DNA BER pathway and the role of APE1.
