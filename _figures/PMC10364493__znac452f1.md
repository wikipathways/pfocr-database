caption: Modes of response evaluation of neoadjuvant therapy in pancreatic cancera
  Diagnostic and staging pathway before neoadjuvant therapy; b conventional and emerging
  ways of evaluating response, either before surgery or after surgery, with advantages
  and disadvantages. A combination of methods will likely to be used in the future
  to best evaluate response at baseline, at interim evaluation, and after completion
  of therapy. PDAC, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; CA19-9, carbohydrate antigen
  19-9; ECOG, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status; NGS, next-generation
  sequencing; ctDNA, circulating free tumour DNA.
