caption: 'Succinic acid is produced in the cytoplasm and mitochondria through the
  rTCA pathway (yellow arrow) and oTCA pathway (green arrow), respectively. The enzymes
  can be enhanced to increase metabolic flux, as indicated by the bold arrows. The
  glyoxylate pathway is represented by the dark green arrow, while gene suppression
  or deletion is denoted by the red arrow. Transmembrane transport is shown by dotted
  arrows. GalP-GLK,It refers to a transport system in Escherichia coli (E. coli) that
  involves two components: galactose penetrase (GalP) and glucokinase (GlK); pflB,
  pyruvate formate lyase; cs, citrate synthetase; ldhA, lactate dehydrogenase A; can,
  aconitase; sdh, succinate dehydrogenase; frd, fumarate reductase'
