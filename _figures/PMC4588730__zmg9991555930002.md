caption: The functions of FGF19 and the corresponding mechanisms. Endogenous FGF19
  expression is induced in intestinal enterocytes by the activation of FXR/RXR heterodimers.
  Secreted FGF19 mediates multiple metabolic processes. On one hand, FGF19 can bind
  to FGFR4 in the presence of β-Klotho and activation of cAMP, followed by stimulation
  of bile acid filling into the gallbladder. In addition, liver is another key target
  organ of FGF19 that activates the SHP/CYP7A1 pathway by binding with FGFR4/β-Klotho
  that negatively regulates bile acid synthesis. On the other hand, by binding with
  FGFR1/β-Klotho, FGF19 mainly regulates glucose metabolism, including suppression
  of gluconeogenesis and enhancement of glucose catabolism via the inhibition of the
  CREB/PGC-1α pathway, and improvement of glycogen synthesis via inhibition of GS
  kinase (GSK) pathway. CYP7A1, cholesterol 7-a-monooxygenase; FXR, farnesoid X receptor;
  GSK3, GS kinase-3; RXR, retinoid X receptor; SHP, protein tyrosine phosphatase.
