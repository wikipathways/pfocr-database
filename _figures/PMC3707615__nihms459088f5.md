caption: (A and B) Differences in network architecture shape dynamical responses.
  (A) Transient activation of ERK in response to EGF is facilitated in part by negative
  feedback through SOS. Sustained ERK activation by NGF relies on positive feedback
  through PKC, which is not activated downstream of EGFR. (B) γ-radiation causes double-strand
  DNA breaks and leads to p53 pulses. Negative feedback through the phosphatase Wip1
  attenuates the damage signal by dephosphorylating ATM and thereby controls the amplitude
  and duration of p53 pulses. UV radiation activates ATR kinase. The lack of negative
  feedback between Wip1 and ATR in the UV pathway is responsible for the difference
  in p53 dynamics.(C and D) Network structure selectively interprets dynamics. (C)
  A network of early responding gene products, such as c-Fos, are induced by activated
  ERK. Transient ERK activation is not sufficient to productively accumulate c-Fos,
  whereas sustained ERK activation leads to accumulation of c-Fos. c-Fos is phosphorylated
  by ERK (pFos) and leads to expression of pro-differentiation genes. Thus, the accumulation
  of early gene products such as c-Fos serves as a persistence detector for sustained
  ERK activation. (D) A gene regulatory circuit discriminates transient from persistent
  TLR4 signals. NF-κB and C/EBPδ form a coherent feed-forward loop to stimulate maximum
  expression of Il6 transcription. Attenuation of transient LPS signals is mediated
  by inhibition through ATF3, whereas the dramatic increase in Il6 under persistent
  LPS stimulation is due in part to positive feedback through autoregulation of C/EBPδ.
