caption: Chemotaxis signalling pathway in (a) E. coli and (b) R. sphaeroides (adapted
  from []). Blue arrows indicate phosphotransfer. (a) In E. coli, attractant binding
  to the transmembrane receptors inhibits CheA autophosphorylation. Subsequently,
  CheA-P transfers the phospho group to CheY, allowing CheY-P to bind flagellar motors
  for ‘tumbling’. CheZ phosphatase dephosphorylates CheY-P to enable ‘running’. CheR
  and CheB are antagonistic proteins that fine-tune sensitivity of the receptors by
  methylation and demethylation, respectively. (b) In R. sphaeroides, transmembrane
  chemoreceptors can sense external concentration of attractants, and the cell presumably
  responds by CheA2 autophosphorylation. CheA2-P then transfers phospho groups to
  a range of response regulators including CheY3, CheY4, CheY6, CheB1 and CheB2. Cytosolic
  chemoreceptors may sense the internal metabolic state. When cytosolic cluster is
  activated, CheA3 and CheA4 cooperate to phosphorylate CheY6 and CheB2. (Online version
