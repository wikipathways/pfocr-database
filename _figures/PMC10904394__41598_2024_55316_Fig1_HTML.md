caption: 'Metabolic pathways and correlations of oxysterols. (A) Metabolic pathways
  of oxysterols. Metabolic pathways of oxysterols and corresponding enzymes or reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). Grey color indicates oxysterols that were not measured in
  our study (needed for completeness of this figure). *Please note that these are
  not fixed subgroups, but created with the purpose of providing a better overview
  of the results. Adapted from1,16–19 (B) Correlation matrix of circulating oxysterols:
  MARIE patient cohort. Spearman partial correlation coefficients, adjusted for age
  and center; using imputed, log2-transformed values. n = 2269, except 7-DC (n = 2209),
  24-DHLan (n = 1019), 22R-HC (n = 263), 24,25-EC (n = 86). Abbreviations: 24S-HC = 24S-hydroxycholesterol;
  7a-HC = 7α-hydroxycholesterol; 7b-HC = 7β-hydroxycholesterol; ; 7-KC = 7-ketocholesterol;
  5a6a-EC = 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol; 5b6b-EC = 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol; THC = 5α,6β-dihydroxycholestanol;
  7-DC = 7-dehydrocholesterol; Lan = lanosterol; 24-DHLan = 24,25-dihydrolanosterol;
  Desmos = desmosterol; 22R-HC = 22R- hydroxycholesterol; 24,25-EC = 24,25-epoxycholesterol;
  BMI = body mass index. *Please not that these are not fixed subgroups, but created
  with the purpose of providing a better overview of the results. **22R-HC and 24,25-EC
  are excluded from cross-sectional analyses due to high amount of values below LOD.
