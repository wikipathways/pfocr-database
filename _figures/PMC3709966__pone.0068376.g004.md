caption: Two relevant networks were generated from the Vpr-modulated proteins according
  to the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Criteria. A. Organ morphology, nucleic acid metabolism,
  small molecule biochemistry (score = 49). B. Carbohydrate metabolism, energy production,
  nucleic acid metabolism (score = 41). Red, up-regulated proteins; green, significantly
  down-regulated proteins; white, proteins known to be in the network but were not
  identified or identified in our study. The color depth indicates the magnitude of
  the change in protein expression level. The shapes are indicative of the molecular
  class (i.e., protein family). Lines connecting the molecules indicate molecular
  relationships. Dashed lines indicate indirect interactions, and solid lines indicate
  direct interactions. The arrow styles indicate specific molecular relationships
  and the directionality of the interaction.
