caption: 'Simplified scheme of established complement activation pathways. To date,
  three activation pathways for complement have been described. Antibody–antigen complexes
  or the acute phase protein CRP initiate the classical pathway by allowing C1q binding.
  The lectin pathway is initiated by MBL binding to pathogen surfaces and to pathogen-specific
  proteins. The alternative pathway is characterized by spontaneous hydrolysis of
  C3 to C3(H2O), which can in turn bind the plasma proteins FB and FD. All three pathways
  result in a C3 convertase, which cleaves C3 and subsequently generates C5 convertases
  and initiates MAC formation. Activation of the coagulation cascade generates thrombin,
  which can cleave C3 and C5 in a C3-/C5-convertase independent manner. Complement
  regulatory proteins are represented in green. CR1 facilitates the decay of C3 and
  C5 convertases and is a cofactor of FI. CD55 accelerates the decay of the C3 convertase.
  CD59 inhibits the MAC formation. Factor I regulates the processing of C3b to iC3b,
  where FHL-1, FH, and CR1 show cofactor activities. FH also regulates the formation
  of the alternative pathway C3 convertase. FHL-1 supports the decay of C3 and C5
  convertases. Abbreviations: Ag–Ab, antigen–antibody; CR1, complement receptor 1;
  CRP, c-reactive protein; FB, factor B; FD, factor D; FH, factor H; FHL-1, factor
  H-like protein 1; FI, factor I; MAC, membrane attack complex; MBL, mannan-binding
  lectin.'
