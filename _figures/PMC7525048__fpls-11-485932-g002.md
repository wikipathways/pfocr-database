caption: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate root stem cell maintenance. pWOX5:GFP
  marks the quiescent center (QC) in Arabidopsis roots. Multiple parallel signaling
  pathways integrate multiple transcription factors to converge as an ROS signal to
  regulate root stem cell maintenance. APP1 is upregulated, and ABO8 and PHB3 inhibit
  H2O2 signals, thus stimulating ERF109/114/115 or inhibiting WOX5. ERF109/114/115
  negatively regulates root stem cell maintenance, whereas WOX5 positively regulates
  it. Another cascade pathway converges on RITF1 to regulate the level of H2O2 and
  O2•−, and its downstream products regulate PLT1/2, thus controlling stem-cell fate.
  Furthermore, the brassinolide signaling pathway regulates the level of BRAVO and
  stem-cell fate in the roots. Arrow-head line indicates stimulation effect, and “T”-shaped
  line shows the inhibition.
