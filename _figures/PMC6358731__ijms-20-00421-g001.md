caption: A summary of the canonical miR biogenesis pathway and miR-mediated mRNA repression.
  In the nucleus, genes that encode miRs are transcribed by RNA polymerases to produce
  primary miR transcripts (pri-miR), which are subsequently processed by the microprocessor
  complex (minimally consisting of Drosha and DGCR8) into precursor miRs (pre-miR).
  These pre-miRs are taken up by exportin-5 (RanGTP-dependent) and transported to
  the cytoplasm. The pre-miRs are then released and further cleaved by the endoribonuclease
  Dicer (assisted by the recruitment of TRBP) into double-stranded mature miR duplexes,
  which are later incorporated into Argonaute (AGO) proteins. The guide strand of
  the miR is selected and retained, whereas the passenger strand is normally degraded.
  Argonaute proteins (AGO1-4 in human), together with the mature single-stranded miR
  and several other proteins, form the miR-induced silencing complex (miRISC), within
  which the target mRNA binds the miR (sometimes with base mismatches). The miRISC
  containing the target mRNA will localize to and condense in droplet-like cytoplasmic
  foci called processing bodies (p-bodies) that are enriched in GW182 proteins and
  enzymes involved in the turnover of mRNAs. This would result in translational suppression
  and active degradation of the target mRNAs, and p-bodies are essential for the coordinated
  storage of mRNAs, as these repressed mRNAs could exit the p-bodies and re-initiate
  translation upon environmental stimuli. Meanwhile, some of the mature miRs, pre-miRs,
  mRNAs, and miR processing proteins are sorted into multi-vesicular bodies (MVB),
  which later become exosomes [,]. This figure only describes the canonical pathway
  of miR biogenesis. More information about non-canonical miR pathways can be found
  in []. DGCR8—DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8; RanGAP—ran GTPase activating protein;
  TRBP—transactivation response RNA binding protein; GW182/TNRC6A—trinucleotide repeat-containing
  gene 6A.
