caption: Following TBI, the mechanical injury-stimulated cell membrane releases arachidonic
  acid (AA), which is metabolized into prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostacyclin (PGI2)
  by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and into leukotrienes (LTB4) by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO).
  The three inflammatory mediators initiate acute inflammation, including changes
  in blood flow, increased capillary permeability and inflammatory cell recruitment
  in the brain injury ambitus zone, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes (i.e.,
  neutrophils) and monocytes. Excess prostaglandins and leukotrienes contribute to
  chronic inflammation. The neutrophils are activated to further release chemotactic
  factors, devour necrotic tissue and sterilize bacteria. The influx of monocytes
  and resident microglial cells develop into macrophages, which secrete pro-inflammatory
  factors (e.g., TNF-α and IL-1β) and consume foreign bodies, necrotic tissue or apoptotic
  cells (e.g., efferocytosis). XFZY significantly suppressed the increased levels
  of blood AA, TNF-α and IL-1β in brain tissue, indicating that XFZY possesses anti-inflammatory
  effects. To target the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, XFZY significantly reversed
  the elevated phosphorylation of AKT/mTOR in brain tissue post-TBI, as well as the
  downstream p70S6K, resulting in a reduced translation ratio of inflammatory factors
  and exerting anti-inflammatory effects.
