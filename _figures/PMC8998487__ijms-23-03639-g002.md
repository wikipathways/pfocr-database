caption: 'Overview of SUMOylation process. Maturation: Sentrin-specific proteases
  (SENPs) family converts SUMO into a mature form, which depends on C-terminal hydrolase
  activity of the family to cleave SUMO precursors, thereby exposing its diglycine
  residues. Activation: Mature SUMO is activated by the E1 enzyme, the cysteine residue
  of E1 is attached by SUMO to form a thioester bond between SUMO and SAE2 in an ATP
  consuming reaction. Conjugation: The activated SUMO is then transferred to the catalytic
  cysteine of the sole E2 enzyme Ubc9, forming a SUMO-Ubc9 thioester bond via an isopeptide
  linkage. Ligation: The specific lysine residue of substrate is attached by SUMO
  with the help of E3 ligases. De-modification: SENPs remove SUMO molecules from substrates,
  and the released SUMOs can be used in next cycle [].'
