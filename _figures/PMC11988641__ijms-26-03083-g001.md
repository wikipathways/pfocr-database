caption: MMP13 orchestrates dynamic remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM)’s
  physical properties. In breast cancer, elevated levels of MMP13 in the extracellular
  matrix (ECM) degrade collagen, releasing growth factors such as TGF-β, which promote
  epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumour cells (characterised by downregulation
  of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin), thereby enhancing invasive capacity.
  MMP13 activates cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to secrete collagen and lysyl
  oxidase (LOX), promoting collagen crosslinking to form a dense stromal matrix that
  increases tumour stiffness. MMP13-activated MMP9 triggers the EGFR signalling pathway,
  enhancing glycolysis and elevating tumour temperature. Tumour-associated macrophages
  (TAMs) secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), synergising with MMP13
  to promote angiogenesis and increase local temperature
