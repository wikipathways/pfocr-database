caption: Glucose signals could take several possible routes, namely Snf3/Rgt2 and
  Mig1/Hxk2 pathways. Binding of glucose to the transmembrane proteins Snf3/Rgt2 inactivates
  the Rgt1 repressor function, leading to expression of several genes (HXTs, MIG2
  and HXK2). Rgt1 is the main downstream repressor of the Snf3/Rgt2 pathway controlling
  expression in the absence of glucose of several targets genes. Two of the targets,
  Hxk2 and Mig2, are directly involved, together with Mig1, in glucose signalling
  through the Mig1/Hxk2 pathway. Genes are depicted by rectangles, proteins by ovals
  and shaded proteins are discussed in the present work.
