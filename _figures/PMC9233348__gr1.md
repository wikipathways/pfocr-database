caption: COVID-19 and cytokine storm, focusing on Ang2 concentrationThe concentrations
  of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 are the most important mediator in cytokine storm formation.
  IL-6 receptors classify into two groups, mIL-6R and sIL-6R. During virus infection,
  host cells can express PRRs. PRRs detect PAMPs. ACE2 receptor acts as a PRR. ACE2
  cleaves Ang2. ACE2 binds to viral S protein, so Ang2 concentrations increase. Ang2
  has two types of receptors, AT1R and AT2R. The Ang2/AT1R complex activates PKC and
  NF-κB, leading to NOX2 activation and cytokine production. ROS production mediated
  by NOX2 and ROS activates NF-κB. NF-κB enhances the expression of IL-6, GM-CSF,
  MCP-1, etc. IL-6 induces the activation of NOX. IL-6, GM-CSF, and MCP-1 activate
  JAK-STAT signaling, resulting in an elevated level of SOCS, but, in severe disease,
  it leads to excessive cytokine production. SOCS blocks the JAK-STAT signaling. SOCS
  may provide a novel therapy for the treatment of COVID-19. The JAK-STAT pathway
  activates by ROS. IL-6 and JAK-STAT signaling pathway interaction can be defined
  as positive feedback. SOCS3 disrupts this vicious cycle by inhibiting IL-6 signaling.
  SOCS-1 inhibits NF-κB activation. NF-κB increases ACE2 expression. sFLT1 production
  is not clear (by binding the Ang2 to AT1 or directly induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection
  or upregulation of AT1 Receptor by TNF). sFLT1 inhibits PlGF, a VEGF, and impairs
  NO production, resulting in endothelial damage. Ang-(1–7) binds to the MASR and
  causes inhibition of ROS and anti-inflammatory properties. SARS-CoV-2, severe acute
