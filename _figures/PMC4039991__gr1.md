caption: Upregulation of a Steroid Synthesis Pathway in Th2 Cells In Vitro(A) Schematic
  representation of integrated steroid biosynthesis pathway with abbreviated metabolites
  (black) and protein factors (blue). Abbreviations are listed in the supplemental
  information. The first phase includes cholesterol biosynthesis and cholesterol uptake,
  the second phase is cholesterol transfer from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix,
  and the final phase includes steroid synthesis. mRNA expression of all the protein
  factors (blue) are shown as a color-coded map, where “white” indicates low expression
  and “red” indicates high expression level. FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript
  per million fragments mapped) values for each gene as obtained by RNA sequencing
  analysis were transformed to the color code (≤3 FPKM value as white and ≥15 FPKM
  value as maximum red). The comparison of the mRNA expression level between naive
  Th1 and Th2 cells is shown adjacent to the protein. The left-hand boxes represent
  color-coded expression levels in naive Th cells, middle is Th1, and right-hand boxes
  represent Th2 cells.(B) Differential upregulation of Cyp11a1 mRNA. Cyp11a1 mRNA
  expression levels obtained by RNA-seq were compared in different Th cell types (naive
  [N], Th1, and Th2). Data presented are averages of two independent repeats. Error
  bars are SDs from the mean.(C) Differential upregulation of Cyp11a1 protein. Comparison
  of Cyp11a1 protein expression in naive, Th1, and Th2 by western blotting.
