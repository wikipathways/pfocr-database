caption: Sphingolipid influence on Th17 and Treg imbalance. In a pro-inflammatory
  setting Th17 differentiation is mediated through mTOR which is activated by S1P1
  and IL6 Receptor signalling. MTOR activates S6 phosphorylation resulting in a Th17
  favouring expression pattern with ROR(γ)t and IL-17 expression. Blockade of Smad3
  activity mediated via S1P1 dependent mTOR pathway inhibits Foxp3 expression. When
  S1P1 is antagonized, mTOR signalling is diminished and activity of Smad3 mediated
  through the TGFβ pathway is sustained. Smad3 enhances Foxp3 expression, which impairs
  SMS1 transcription resulting in an increased level of ceramides in the cytosol.
  PP2A interacts with those ceramides and attenuates mTOR signalling.
