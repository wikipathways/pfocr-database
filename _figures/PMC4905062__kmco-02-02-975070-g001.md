caption: Gαs as a molecular switch to control sonic hedgehog signaling and medulloblastoma
  formation. (A) When Gαs GTPase activity is turned off due to Gαs inactivation or
  the presence of sonic hedgehog (SHH), intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) levels are reduced and the cAMP-dependent pathway is inhibited. Activation
  of smoothened (SMO) signaling then occurs in part through SMO translocation to primary
  cilia and Gli2 accumulation at the tip of primary cilia. The Gαs deletion phenocopies
  the gain-of-function SMO mutants by activating SHH signaling in cerebellar granular
  neuron progenitor cells (GNPs) and promotes medulloblastoma formation. (B) Upregulation
  of Gαs GTPase activity increases cAMP levels, which activates the cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase A pathway to initiate downstream signaling cascades. Gαs is highly
  enriched in the primary cilia of GNPs, and its activation blocks SMO ciliary translocation
  and maintains Patched1 positioning at the primary cilium to block SMO signaling
  activation and medulloblastoma initiation.
