caption: 'Type III Interferons Production and Activity. Type III IFNs act on epithelial
  cells and tissue-resident neutrophils, dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, and
  plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Like the type I IFN pathway, IFN-λ induction starts
  with PRR (TLR and RLR) recognition of the respective PAMPs. Receptor-ligand binding
  triggers the IFN-λ induction cascade via NFκß, resulting in the activation and translocation
  to the nucleus of IFN regulatory factors IRF3 and IRF7, which induce the expression
  of type III IFN. After its release to the extracellular milieu, IFN-λ binds to its
  heterodimeric receptor (IFNLR), which consists of two subunits: α-subunit (IL28RA)
  and β-subunit (IL10RB). IFN-λ-IFNLR trimeric complex formation leads to the activation
  of JAK1 and TYK2, followed by the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT-2. Afterward,
  STAT1 and STAT-2 translocate to the nucleus and induce the expression of hundreds
  of ISGs with antiviral activity. Type I and III IFNs both show a complex mechanism
  of feedback loops, leading to autocrine and paracrine signaling. Even though epithelial
  cells are the primary source of type III IFN, macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic
  cells can also secrete them. Created with BioRender.com.'
