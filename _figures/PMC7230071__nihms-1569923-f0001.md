caption: 'Three distinct processes can drive resistance to ferroptosis. Depletion
  of polyunsaturated fatty acyl phospholipids (PUFA-PLs, purple, lower left) depletes
  the key substrates needed for lethal lipid peroxidation. Depletion of iron by storage
  in ferritin or export driven by prominin2 blocks the iron-dependent peroxidation
  of PUFA-PLs. (blue, lower right). Finally, three parallel pathways act to suppress
  lipid peroxidation by intercepting intermediates in the process: the glutathione
  pathway (left), the ubiquinone pathway (middle, NADPH-FSP1-CoQ10), and the tetrahydrobiopterin
  (GCH1/BH4) pathway (right). These are further regulated by upstream genes and proteins
  as indicated.'
