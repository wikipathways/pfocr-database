caption: Extracellular PEPD induced expression of the β1-integrin receptor and IGF-1R
  signaling proteins in control and “scratched” fibroblast models. (A) The proteins
  of β1-integrin receptor and IGF-1R downstream signaling pathways, FAK, Grb2, and
  (C) NF-ĸβ and ERK1/2 were analyzed by Western blot in lysates of PEPD-treated fibroblasts
  (50, and 100 nM). Representative blot images were shown (densitometry of protein
  stains is presented under protein bands as a ratio versus control; ). GAPDH was
  used as a loading control. (B) Illustration of the β1-integrin receptor-downstream
  signaling pathway. Created with BioRender.com.
