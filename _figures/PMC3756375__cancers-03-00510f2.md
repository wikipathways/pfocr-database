caption: Nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling in breast cancer cells. NGF mediated
  autocrine signaling in breast cancer cells is carried out by two independent signaling
  pathways via TrkA and p75NTR. TrkA signals downstream to Ras/MAPK promoting proliferation
  of cells, as well as invasion and metastasis. p75NTRsignaling results in activation
  of the transcription factor NF-κB p50/p65 canonical pathway. The precise mechanism
  leading to NF-κB activation is not fully understood but is known to include TRADD
  and BEX2. This activation of NF-κB has been shown to be antagonized by the small
  peptide inhibitor SN-50. Activation of these pathways ultimately results in changes
  at transcriptional level. PI3K, Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; MAPK, Mitogen activated
  protein kinase; NF-κB, Nuclear factor-κB; IκB Inhibitor of κB; TRADD, Tumor necrosis
  factor receptor-associated death domain; BEX2, Brain expressed X-linked 2; DD, death
  domain; Ub, ubiquitin; P, Phosphate.
