caption: Changes in bone metabolism caused by cold environment. Cold exposure promotes
  bone loss by inhibiting osteogenesis and enhancing osteoclastic metabolism. In bone
  resorption, there is an increase in the number of OCs/bone surface, in addition
  to a significant increase in OC surface area, number of OCs, and percentage of eroded
  surface. Cold can also affect biomarkers of bone remodelling and blood-bone immune
  crosstalk, with an increase in SOST, RANKL, and CTX-1. This is because sympathetic
  nerve activation by low temperature leads to β-adrenergic receptor activation and
  subsequent initiation of OCs-associated bone resorption. In bone formation, the
  bone formation rate/bone surface decreases significantly, as well as a significant
  decrease in the percentage of mineralised surface, bone formation rate, number of
  OBs, and bone-like thickness. In addition, OCN levels are increased. With WBC, OPG/RANKL
  increases in the high-fitness group and decreases in the low-fitness group. PTH
  increases significantly after cold, while P1NP and β-CTX decreases significantly.
  Cold exposure also significantly upregulates Runx2 in the process of osteogenic
  differentiation of MSC, as well as the expression of OPN, BSP, and Col1. At the
  same time, phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK pathway is activated to promote osteogenic
  differentiation of BMSCs. This complex phenomenon is explained by the fact that
  cold exposure induces changes in bone metabolism and morphology by increasing sympathetic
  tone and increasing BAT. BAT can accelerate bone resorption through the secretion
  of FGF21, IL-6, and leptin. On the other hand, the regulation of bone metabolism
  by BAT is positive in humans, as it upregulates the levels of ALP, OCN, and Runx2,
  promotes osteogenic differentiation, and can reduce the resorption capacity of OCs,
  diminishing their resorption capacity
