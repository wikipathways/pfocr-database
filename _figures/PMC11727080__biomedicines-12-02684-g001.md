  from the transport of glucose and fatty acids, metabolic differences in M1 macrophages/HCC
  cells vs. M2 macrophages are shown, underlining the role of mitochondria. In M1
  macrophage/HCC cells, the glucose uptake increases for the overexpression of GLUT1.
  Glucose is converted by overexpressed HK2 into Glucose 6–phosphate, which is addressed
  toward glycolysis, supplying energy to cells, and the pentose phosphate pathway
  to provide NADPH for the biosynthesis of the fatty acids and inflammatory mediators.

  G6PDH for PPP. The fate of pyruvate is to produce lactate by the upregulated LDHA
  or acetyl-CoA through pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Acetyl-CoA takes part in the
  interrupted TCA cycle, leading to an increase in mitochondrial citrate. The citrate
  is transported by CIC into the cytosol, where it participates in the biosynthetic
  pathways. In M2 macrophages, glucose transport and glycolysis are not the primary
  pathways, whereas the uptake of fatty acids and the triacylglyceride mobilization
  increased. The β-oxidation of fatty acids is the predominant metabolic pathway;
