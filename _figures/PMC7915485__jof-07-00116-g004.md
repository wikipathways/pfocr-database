caption: Representation of Paracoccidioides spp. extracellular vesicles (EV). Several
  studies regarding proteomics, lipidomics, transcriptomics, and general EVs composition
  were performed in order to characterize Paracoccidioides spp. EVs composition and
  content. The secretory pathway can occur by conventional and unconventional release,
  however these mechanisms are not yet fully characterized in Paracoccidioides spp.
  The content and composition of EVs are distributed among (1) RNA (mRNAs, non-coding
  RNAs, small RNAs, and interference-RNAs); (2) carbohydrates (glucose, mannose, and
  galactose), including N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and mannan residues in EVs surface;
  (3) lipids (brassicasterol, ergosterol and lanosterol); and (4) proteins and enzymes
  involved with a myriad of signaling pathways and host immune system modulation.
