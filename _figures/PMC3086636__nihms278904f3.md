caption: Ste5 coordinates signal activation in the yeast mating pathway. (a) In response
  to the presence of pheromone, Ste20 is activated at the cell membrane and in turn
  activates its downstream target Ste11. This initiates a cascade of phosphorylation
  events leading to the activation and release of the terminal component Fus3 from
  the Ste5 scaffold. By spatially coordinating the kinases involved in the pheromone
  response, Ste5 ensures both the speed and accuracy of signaling. (b) AKAP-Lbc coordinates
  the activation and translocation of protein kinase D. The integration of calcium/phospholipid
  (diacylglycerol, DAG) and cAMP signals promotes the activation of PKA and PKC respectively.
  These enzyme activities act synergistically to promote the phosphorylation of PKD
  in the active-site loop and its release from the anchoring protein complex. The
  newly active enzyme is then free to translocate into the nucleus, where it can phosphorylate
  the DNA-modifying enzyme HDAC5. Phospho-HDAC5 then exits the nucleus, thereby promoting
  the relaxation of DNA. In cardiomyocytes, this leads to transcriptional activation
  of genes that propagate the hypertrophic responses.
