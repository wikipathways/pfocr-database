caption: A) Glucose metabolism pathways. Glucose is phosphorylated in the liver by
  GK to form G6P. G6P can then enter the pentose phosphate pathway by interacting
  with G6PDH, the glycogen synthesis pathway by binding to PGM, or form F6P by GPI
  isomerization. Residues involved in these interactions are shown in red, with dots
  indicating nonbinding sites within a linear sequence and spaces denoting larger
  linear distances. B) G6P interacting protein structures. The structures for GPI
  in Rat (1U0F), phospho-glucose/phospho-mannose protein in archaea (1X9I), and GlmS
  in E. coli (1JXA) have been crystallized. The backbone of residues within 5 Angstrom
  of G6P (red) are yellow and hydrogen bonds are shown by a green dashed line. We
  indicate the residues conforming to the G6P recognition motif with blue arrows and
  color the side chains black.
