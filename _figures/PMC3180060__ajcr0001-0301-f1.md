caption: PARP in DNA Repair, Induced Damage, and Tumor Cells. PARP plays an important
  role in BER pathway. Tumors with HR or DDR defects are more dependent on PARP and
  BER to maintain genome integrity. Chemotherapy induces DNA damages, lack of repair
  results in cancer cell death, while PARP inhibition leads to an increased SSBs and
  will eventually lead to DSBs via replication forks collapse. Synthetic lethal association
  between PARP inhibition and HR, DDR deficiencies to selectively kill tumor cells
  provides rational of clinical development of PARP inhibitors.
