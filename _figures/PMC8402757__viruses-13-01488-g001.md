caption: 'IGF-1 signal transduction via IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in viral infections.
  The phosphorylated tyrosine residues of IGF-1R act as docking stations for substrates,
  such as insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and Shc adaptor proteins, and then recruit
  additional factors to activate two major cascades, the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Ras/Raf participates
  in the activation of the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2, which phosphorylate and activate several
  proteins and stimulate cell proliferation. ERK activates a wide variety of substrates
  that regulate transcription and translation, controlling the cell cycle in some
  viral infections. Viral activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway slows apoptosis
  and prolongs viral replication. Some of the important proteins in this pathway are
  transcription factors such as c-Fos, c-Jun, c-myc and Elk1.1. IGF-1R+IGF-1, 2. IGF-2R,
