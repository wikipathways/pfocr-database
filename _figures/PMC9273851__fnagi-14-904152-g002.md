caption: 'The regulation of ferroptosis. Multiple pathways inhibit ferroptosis by
  resisting oxidative distress and inhibiting lipid peroxidation, including systemXC–/GSH/GPX4
  pathway, FSP1/CoQ10 pathway, GCH1/DHFR/BH4 pathway, DHODH/CoQ pathway, and p62/Keap1/Nrf2
  pathway. (1) systemXC–/GSH/GPX4 pathway: systemXC– consists of SLC7A11 and SLC3A2
  and is capable to exchange glutamate and cystine equally. Cystine is obtained from
  methionine through the Sulfur-transfer pathway and then converted to cysteine intracellularly
  to generate GSH. Selenoprotein GPX4 detects GSH, leading to the reduction of lipid
  hydroperoxides to lipid alcohols and the simultaneous oxidization of two GSH into
  oxidized GSSG. IPP, produced by the MVA pathway, transfers isopentyl groups to isopentyl
  transferases-catalyzed Sec-tRNA precursors which mediate the maturation of Sec-tRNAs
  responsible for Sec insertion into GPX4. (2) FSP1/CoQ10 pathway: FSP1 converts CoQ10
  to CoQ10H2 using NAD(P)H, which quenches lipid free radicals generated by lipid
  peroxidation. Membrane-associated protein complex ESCRT-III regulates membrane regeneration
  through membrane germination and cleavage. FSP1 transported in the plasma membrane
  can resist ferroptosis by enrolling ESCRT-III to activate the membrane restore mechanism.
  (3) GCH1/DHFR/BH4 pathway: BH4 is a potent free radical scavenger that exerts antioxidant
  effects in cells. The interconversion between the oxidation and reduction forms
  of BH4 is controlled by two enzymes, GCH1 and DHFR. The synthesis of BH4 by GCH1
  expression selectively prevents PUFA-PL depletion-induced membrane lipid remodeling.
  DHFR is an essential enzyme for BH4 regeneration, and its inhibition may synergize
  with GPX4 inhibitors to induce ferroptosis. BH4 can also quench ROS by promoting
  the synthesis of CoQ10. (4) DHODH/CoQ pathway: DHODH is an enzyme present on the
  inner surface of mitochondria that catalyzes substrates DHO to produce OA. DHODH
  cooperates with mitochondrial GPX4 to regulate mitochondrial ferroptosis by reducing
  CoQ to CoQH2 on the mitochondrial intima independently of the cytoplasmic GPX4 or
  FSP1 pathways. (5) p62/Keap1/Nrf2 pathway: Under oxidative distress conditions,
  p62 prevents the degradation of Nrf2 in the Keap1-CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase
  complex. Nrf2 undergoes nuclear translocation and binds to ARE to initiate transcription
  of multiple cytoprotective genes against ferroptosis. Nrf2-mediated protein-DNA
  interaction regulates the expression of FTH, FTL, FPN, TfR, HO-1, and so on for
  controlling cellular iron metabolism, promoting SLC7A11 expression, and increasing
  the production of NADPH, GSH, and CoQ10 to enhance the antioxidant capacity of cells.
