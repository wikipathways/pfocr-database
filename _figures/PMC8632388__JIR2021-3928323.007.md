caption: 'Our new integrated working model: multiple-hit trained immunity model with
  hyperlipidemia and hypomethylation (S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) decrease) for inflammation
  enhancement in various diet-induced and gene-deficient/genetic mouse models of nonalcoholic
  steatohepatitis (NASH)/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). (a) Schematic presentation
  of trained immunity in NASH and NAFLD. Hyperlipidemia (high-fat diet) acts as the
  first stimuli to prime the innate immune cells and induce trained immunity. Hypomethylation
  that is caused by methionine-related nutrient deficiency and SAM synthase deficiency
  is regarded as second stimulation. This restimulation establishes trained immunity
  and metabolic reprogramming, leading to a large number of inflammatory cytokine
  secretion. (b) Epigenetic reprogramming pathway of trained immunity: hyperlipidemia
  and hyperglycemia inducers bind to their receptors in the cell membrane, increasing
  trained immunity-related glycolysis, acetyl-CoA production, and mevalonate pathways.
  Upregulation of three trained immunity pathways leads to increased trained immunity-related
  histone acetylation (H3K27ac and H3K14ac) and enhance proinflammatory innate immune
  response. (c) Overview figure shows the trained immunity model in detail. Abbreviations:
