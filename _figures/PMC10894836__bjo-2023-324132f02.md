caption: The role of miRNAs on gliogenesis. During the differentiation of retinal
  progenitor cells (RPCs) into MGs, let-7 may inhibit the self-renewal ability of
  RPCs by targeting the DNA structural protein HMGA2, which promotes the differentiation
  of RPCs and, therefore, the gliogenesis of Müller cells. miR-7a can target Notch3,
  thereby attenuating Notch signalling, which promotes the differentiation of Müller
  cells from RPCs. MiR-9/9 and miR-124 may inhibit the expression of Sox9, which also
  affects the Notch signalling pathway and thereby regulates gliogenesis in Müller
  cells.
