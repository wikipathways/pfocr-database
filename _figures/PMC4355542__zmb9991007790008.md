caption: Schematic model for the integration of TORC2 into the Pkc1-Mpk1 MAP kinase
  (MAPK) cascade in S. cerevisiae. Details are described in the text. Briefly, heat
  shock stress is sensed by the stress sensor proteins Wsc1 and Mid2 on the cytoplasmic
  membrane, and the heat shock signal is transmitted to Rom2 (guanine-nucleotide exchange
  factor for Rho1), which in turn activates Rho1. GTP-bound Rho1 interacts with Pkc1,
  and Pkc1 activates the Mpk1 MAP kinase cascade (the so-called cell wall integrity
  [CWI] pathway). TORC2 phosphorylates Pkc1 at Thr1125 in the turn motif and at Ser1143
  in the hydrophobic motif. The phosphorylation of these amino acid residues is necessary
  for transmitting the MG signal downstream to the Mpk1 MAP kinase cascade. The phosphorylation
  level of Ser1143 in Pkc1 increases following treatment with MG.
