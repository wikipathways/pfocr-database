caption: 'Functional gene network developed from the transcriptome data of grains
  studied in present investigation. (a) Pathways co-expressing with the carotenoid
  biosynthetic pathway: pyruvate metabolism, lipid metabolism, secondary metabolism,
  cell differentiation, inositol phosphate metabolism, embryo development, phenyl
  propanoidpathway, MEP pathway and abiotic stress. (b) Pathways/processes directly
  linked with the carotenoid metabolic pathway: pyruvate metabolism, lipid metabolism,
  phenyl propanoid pathway, MEP pathway and abiotic stress.'
