caption: In sum, there is a critical clinical need for better understanding and treatment
  of inflammatory airway disease in general, and mucous cell metaplasia in particular.
  Although work is at an early stage, several lines of evidence already suggest that
  CLCA proteins (particularly hCLCA1) may be master regulators of mucin gene expression
  in humans. We have gradually developed the proposal that the airway maintains a
  special program for host defense and that changes in this same program may lead
  to airway disease. The same argument can be made for mucus secretion. Thus, under
  normal circumstances a physiologic level of mucus production allows for mucociliary
  clearance of particulate matter from the airway and aids in defense against respiratory
  pathogens. However, if mucus secretion is excessive, it leads to airway obstruction
  and consequent dysfunction. In both normal and abnormal conditions, there appears
  to be an immune axis that drives cytokine production, and in turn, a downstream
  mechanism that translates the cytokine signal into mucin gene expression. In humans,
  this downstream mechanism features hCLCA1, the first member of a newly defined family
  of “chloride channel calcium-activated” (CLCA) proteins in humans. It is possible
  that additional CLCA family members may mediate airway hyperreactivity, but this
  issue requires further study. In either case, the mechanism for how hCLCA1 might
  signal to cause mucin gene expression and mucous cell metaplasia is a goal of ongoing
  studies. Initial analysis of CLCA structure and function suggests that these proteins
  are secreted and cleaved into fragment polypeptides. We are particularly focused
  on defining the possibility that hCLCA1 is a secreted protein that is cleaved into
  an active polypeptide that in turn binds to a receptor on the cell surface and signals
  to activate mucin gene expression (). This scheme for hCLCA1 (and orthologous mClca3,5,6)
  control over epithelial behavior can be tested in isolated airway epithelial cells
  as well as mouse models and then in patients with mucous cell metaplasia due to
  asthma or COPD or other inflammatory airway diseases. A full understanding of this
  pathway will eventually provide multiple targets for therapeutic intervention, including
  modifications of hCLCA1 expression, processing, and signaling. A particular challenge
  for therapeutic strategies will be to block excessive mucus prduction without compromising
  host defense and thereby restore proper balance to the mucociliary system.
