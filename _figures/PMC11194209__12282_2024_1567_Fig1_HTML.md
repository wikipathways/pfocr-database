caption: Major abnormal signaling pathways in TNBC. Although no clear driver gene
  has been found for TNBC at present, the occurrence and development of TNBC are closely
  related to the abnormalities of many signaling pathways. After NGS sequencing of
  many clinical samples, it was found that the EGFR signaling pathway, Notch signaling
  pathway, and Wnt signaling pathway were the most common abnormalities in patients
  with TNBC. This figure is drawn by AI
