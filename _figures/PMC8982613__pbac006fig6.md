caption: 'Glycolysis promotes angiogenesis in IH. Glycolysis is defined as the conversion
  of glucose into pyruvate. In the presence of oxygen, glucose is finally converted
  into lactate, which is known as aerobic glycolysis or the “Warburg effect”. Several
  advantages exist for tumor endothelial cell reliance on glycolysis, including producing
  ATP faster, reducing reactive oxygen species production, providing more carbon skeletons
  for biosynthesis, and more adaptation to a hypoxic environment., Both the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway and HIF-1α pathway are involved in the pathogenesis of IH. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway and HIF-1α pathway are key regulators of glycolysis. Upregulated VEGF/VEGFR-2
  signaling in HemECs induced an autocrine signaling loop, which resulted in Akt activation.
  Activation of AKT can stabilize the glucose transporter Glut-1 at the plasma membrane,
  increasing aerobic glycolysis. Glycolysis promotes endothelial cell competitiveness
  for the tip position, thus promoting IH angiogenesis (This figure was created by
