caption: The mTOR pathway and epilepsy. A. The mTOR pathway involves two complexes,
  the rapamycin-sensitive, mTORC1, and the relatively rapamycin-insensitive, mTORC2
  (not shown), is regulated by a number of upstream signaling pathways, and activates
  a series of downstream effectors. Upstream regulators (PI3K/Akt, LKB1/AMPK) modulate
  the mTOR pathway in response to various physiological stimuli involved in energy,
  nutrient, and growth regulation. In turn, mTORC1 stimulates downstream signaling
  mechanisms primarily involved in ribosomal biogenesis (S6K, S6) and protein translation
  (4E-BP1, eIF4E). Genetic mutations in different components of the mTOR pathway have
  been identified that cause hyperactivation of mTORC1 and may lead to various disease
  phenotypes, including epilepsy. B. The mTOR pathway may coordinate multiple mechanisms
  of epileptogenesis due to diverse causes of epilepsy. mTORC1 may be abnormally activated
  by a variety of genetic defects or acquired injuries. In turn, mTORC1 hyperactivation
  may trigger multiple downstream mechanisms of epileptogenesis via regulation of
  protein synthesis and other cellular processes, such as expression of ion channels,
  axonal sprouting, oxidative stress, autophagy, neuronal death, and neurogenesis.
  Inhibition of mTORC1 may represent a rational therapy for multiple types of epilepsy
  involving abnormal mTOR pathway activation. AMPK - 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase; eIF4E, elongation initiation factor 4E; LKB1 - liver kinase B1;
  mTORC1 - mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; PI3K - phosphoinositide-3 kinase;
  PTEN - phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10; Rheb - Ras homolog enriched
  in brain; STRADα - STE20-related kinase adapter alpha; S6 - ribosomal protein S6;
  S6K - ribosomal S6 kinase; TSC1 - tuberous sclerosis complex 1 protein; TSC2 - tuberous
  sclerosis complex 2 protein; 4E-BP1 - elongation factor 4E binding protein 1.
