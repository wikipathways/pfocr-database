caption: Different models are proposed in literature. In “single fork” or “double
  forks” models, replication forks are stalled at DNA ICL and recognised by FANCM-FAAPs
  (FAAP24). FANCM promotes the ATR-kinase dependent checkpoint response. The FANC
  core complex is activated and monoubiquitylates the FANCD2-FANCI complex. FANCI-FANCD2-ub
  complex and SLX4 are located in the chromatin and promote SLX4/nuclease activities
  in ICL unhooking. A double-strand break (one-ended or double-ended) is generated
  to allow subsequent resection and strand invasion by homologous recombination mediators
  in a process named break-induced replication (BIR) or canonical HR. In “traverse”
  model, FANCM after FANCD2 recruitment on ICL translocates in another side by MCM
  interaction to continue DNA synthesis. ICL repair is postreplicatif.
