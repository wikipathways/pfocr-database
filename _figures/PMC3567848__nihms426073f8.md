caption: Schematic presentation of the proposed involvement of signaling pathways
  in expression of P450s and extracellular lignin degrading enzyme system (LDS) in
  P. chrysosporium. Expression of multiple individual components of the cAMP/MAPK
  pathways was observed in the defined liquid cultures (). Certain genes of the cAMP/MAPK
  pathways could be induced by different stimuli such as the physiological conditions
  (LN or HN conditions), natural substrates, and/or xenobiotic compounds. These pathway
  transducers initiate the downstream events which ultimately result in the expression
  of P450 or LDS system enzymes. Dashed arrows indicate multiple steps.
