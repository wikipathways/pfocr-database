caption: 'Central metabolic pathways of E. coli functional under anaerobic condition
  during glucose and xylose fermentation. Relevant genes and corresponding enzymes
  are shown. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) operon was expressed under anaerobic condition
  via promoter replacement and is represented as thick line. The competing pathways
  to ethanol were blocked as shown by two parallel bars. Broken arrows represent multiple
  reactions of a pathway. Extracellular metabolites are placed in boxes. Abbreviations
  are as follows: ADH, acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase; ACK, acetate kinase; FHL,
  formate hydrogen-lyase; FRD, fumarate reductase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PDH,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase; PFL, pyruvate formate-lyase; PTA, phosphate acetyltransferase;
  PYK, pyruvate kinase.'
