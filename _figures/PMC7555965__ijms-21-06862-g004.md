caption: 'Molecular pathways involved in aCML. Mutations in the ASXL1 and EZH2 genes
  are mainly point mutations that lead to impaired function of the polycomb repressive
  complex 2 (PRC2), which translate in decreased epigenetic repression of key genes
  involved in stem cell renewal, thus promoting myeloid proliferation and differentiation.
  Mutations of both NRAS and PTNP11 result in a constitutive activation of MAPK, promoting
  cancer cell survival and proliferation. SETBP1 encodes a protein named SET binding
  protein 1 (SEB) that regulates the SET inhibitory activity on tumor suppressors,
  including PP2A. In aCML, all the SETBP1 mutations result in an increased gene expression
  and, through SET, in a reduction of PP2A inhibitory activity on AKT and MAPK pathways,
  leading to increased cellular proliferation and survival. Fingolimod targets PP2A
  with an activating effect. ETNK1 encodes an ethanolamine kinase, which catalyzes
  the first step of the de novo phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis pathway, critical
  for regulating membrane architecture and the topology of transmembrane domains of
  membrane binding proteins. Due to the fact that the ethanolamine kinase 1 contributes
  to different processes in the cell, the mechanisms by which the mutant protein induces
  myeloproliferation have not yet been clarified. CSFR3 mutations may be membrane
  proximal mutations or truncation mutations or a combination of the two. All the
  activating missense mutations target the proximal domain leading to increased dimerization
  and activation of JAK-STAT pathway, sensitive to its kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib.
  Conversely, CSFR3 truncating mutations induce receptor signaling through SRC family
  kinase rendering the cells sensitive to the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib. Green
