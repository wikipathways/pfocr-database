caption: FAK signaling in FLNC cardiomyopathy. Our data indicate that FLNC is an important
  regulator of sarcomere structural stability in cardiac myocytes. The loss of FLNC
  causes structural defect, the activation of pathogenic PDGFRA/FAK signaling pathways,
  and the downregulation of AKT signaling, which is important for cardiac growth.
  In this study, we found that AKT activation was reduced with the expression levels
  of PHLPP1, an AKT-specific phosphatase. The PHLPPA transcript levels were increased
  in FLNCKO iPSC-CMs compared to isogenic healthy iPSC-CMs. Therefore, we hypothesized
  that the deletion of FLNC in iPSC-CMs upregulated the expression levels of PHLPP1,
  a finding that needs further investigation. --- broken line arrows indicate possible/alternative
