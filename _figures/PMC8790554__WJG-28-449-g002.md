caption: 'Main mechanisms of action of long non-coding RNAs in the cell. Cytoplasm
  - microRNA sponging: microRNAs are sequestered from their mRNA targets, resulting
  in mRNA translation; Interaction with signalling mediators: binding to pathway mediators
  can modulate downstream targets activation. Nucleus - chromatin remodeling: Long
  non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) interact with chromatin and modify its conformation; histone
  modifications: lncRNAs influence the activity of the enzymes responsible for histone
  modifications; sequence interaction: lncRNAs act on nearby genes transcription;
  transcription start site (TSS) binding complex: lncRNAs bind ribonucleoproteins,
  interfering with gene transcription; transcription factor (TF) sequestration in
  nuclear bodies: TF are moved to nuclear bodies from the promoter region of target
  genes, influencing gene transcription. Nuclear bodies like paraspeckles consist
  in a lncRNA scaffold and target proteins; alternative splicing: lncRNAs determine
  a preferential splicing in favour of an isoform respect to another one. The so-far
  investigated lncRNAs in celiac disease (CeD) are reported near their known mechanism
  of action, respecting their main cellular localization. lncRNAs in green were reported
  to be downregulated in CeD, whereas the ones in red were found upregulated in a
  specific cell compartment. The image is original and was created with the use of
