caption: JAK-STAT signaling in response to mosquito-borne flavivirus infection and
  its antagonism in humans (A) and mosquitoes (B). (A) Following their production
  and release from human cells, type I IFNs (IFN-α and -β) bind to their cognate IFN-α
  receptor subunits 1 or 2 (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) []. IFNAR activation results in phosphorylation
  of JAK1 and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) and the subsequent activation and homo- or
  heterodimerization of STAT1 or STAT2 []. STAT proteins then associate with IRF9
  forming the interferon-stimulated genes factor 3 (ISGF3) complex which is translocated
  to the nucleus, promoting the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [,].
  (B) The JAK-STAT pathway in mosquitoes is activated upon the binding of the unpaired
  ligand (Upd) to the transmembrane receptor Domeless (Dome), an ortholog of the mammalian
  type I cytokine receptor during development [,]. The JAK-STAT pathway is also activated
  by the binding of Vago, an insect cytokine-like factor, to an unknown receptor which
  may suggest that Vago acts in a manner similar to IFNs in human cells []. Notably,
  Vago is induced via the RNAi pathway dsRNA sensor Dicer-2, indicating a cross-talk
  between these pathways in mosquitoes []. The binding of Upd and Vago to their cognate
  receptors leads to the phosphorylation of Hop, a homolog of the mammalian kinase
  JAK [], which then results in phosphorylation of mosquito STAT proteins, which show
  a high degree of similarity to mammalian STAT5 []. STAT proteins are then translocated
  to the nucleus and consequently induce the transcription of JAK-STAT-regulated genes
  []. However, virus-encoded antagonists of mosquito-borne flaviviruses (DENV in purple,
  ZIKV in green, WNV in light blue, JEV in orange, YFV in black) are able to block
  these pathways in humans and mosquitoes. See main text for details.
