caption: FOXO3, a signaling hub for a protective immune response against mycobacterial
  infection. In order to compromise host resistance, M.tb predominantly activates
  the pro-survival pathway PI3K/Akt to inhibit apoptosis and induce IL-10 through
  FOXO3 inhibition. Activated Akt will then phosphorylate the pro-apoptotic transcription
  factor FOXO3 at three residues, Thr32, Ser253, and Ser315, leading to its translocation
  to the cytosol where it is stored as a complex FOXO3/chaperone protein 14-3-3 and/or
  degraded by the proteasome. However, PI3K/Akt inhibition leads to activation of
  FOXO3, which will accumulate inside the nucleus and restrict IL-10 secretion through
  direct binding to its proximal promoter. Inhibition of IL-10 signaling is necessary
  to restore the anti-mycobacterial capacity of the host and increase the polarization
  of macrophage toward a proinflammatory M1 phenotype, which is crucial for the shaping
  of an effective Th1 adaptive response against M.tb pathogenesis. Activation of FOXO3
  would also induce the expression of PUMA and NOXA, the two effectors of macrophage
  apoptosis. Apoptotic bodies charged with mycobacterial antigens will be ingested
  by the bystander dendritic cells (DC) to better cross-prime T cells. In conclusion,
  activated FOXO3 in infected macrophages benefit the protection against TB in many
  ways. (i) Induces apoptosis of infected-macrophages and disrupts the intracellular
  replication of M.tb within the host. (ii) Inhibits IL-10 and restore the antimicrobial
  host responses. (iii) Boost the adaptive immune response to M.tb.
