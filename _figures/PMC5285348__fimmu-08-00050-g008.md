caption: Mutual regulation between miRNAs and the Wnt pathway determine the survival
  of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis)-infected macrophage and the profile
  of the inflammatory response. Upon interaction of M. tuberculosis with TLR2 and
  TLR4, NFκB activation leads to increased miR155 levels which, besides its negative
  effect on autophagy and apoptosis, through the negative modulation of key inhibitors
  of the Wnt pathway (APC and HMG-box transcription factor 1) leads to β-catenin/TCF-mediated
  expression of miR2, miR125b, miR146b (a target of the Wnt5a signaling pathway),
  and miR29, thus wiping off the pro-inflammatory response. Additionally, miR29 further
  enhances Wnt signaling by targeting distinct set of Wnt negative regulators (Dikkopf-1,
  Kremen2, and sFRP2).
