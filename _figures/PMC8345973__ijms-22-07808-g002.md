caption: Schematic illustration of the crosstalk among NO, CO, and H2S and downstream
  nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)–heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling
  able to protect chronic kidney disease progression. Activation of the NRF2–HO-1–CO
  signaling pathway suppresses nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and transforming growth factor-β
  (TGF-β), consequently inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis.
  NO and H2S can activate NRF2 via S-nitrosylation and S-sulfhydration of Kelch-like
  ECH associated protein 1 (KEAP1), respectively. Via S-nitrosylation, NO can also
  inhibit NFκB-induced inflammation and activate hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α),
  a HO-1 inducer. Additionally, NFκB can also be regulated by H2S via S-sulfhydration.
  NO and H2S also reduce TGFβ-mediated fibrosis.
