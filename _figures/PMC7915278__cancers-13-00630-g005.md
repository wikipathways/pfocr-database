caption: '(A) Selected network of 138 proteins that were found in a functional screen
  for proteins involved in the pathway in cancer (KEGG: hsa05200). The network was
  created with the use of the STRING database. Edges connecting proteins represent
  interactions between two proteins, and the line thickness indicates the strength
  of data support. Red, blue, and green nodes represent the mTOR signaling pathway,
  MAPK signaling pathway, and chemokine signaling pathway, respectively. The overlapping
  areas indicate the shared proteins of any two or three groups. (B) Top 20 proteins
  with the highest degree of connectivity belonging to the pathway in cancer in the
  entire experiment. (C) Top 20 DAPs with the highest degree of connectivity. Colored
  tags indicated the abundance increase (red) and decrease (green) in FL compared
  to normal B-cells.'
