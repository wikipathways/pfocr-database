caption: Non-canonical activation of TGF-β signaling promotes tumor progression, EMT
  and metastasis via SMAD, MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways that up-regulate mesenchymal-associated
  transcription factors (e.g., Snail, Slug, Twist and ZEB) and repress E-cadherin
  expression. The Wnt signaling pathway also regulates EMT through its inhibition
  of GSK3β-mediated degradation of β-catenin, Snail and Slug. TGF-β can also activate
  Rho/ROCK/MLC signaling to drive dynamic actin reorganization required for metastasis.
  Iron chelators have been demonstrated to inhibit the EMT and metastasis by maintaining
  expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin at cell membranes, and may also mediate these
  effects through regulation of other upstream cascades (see text for more details).
  Molecules negatively regulated by iron chelators are indicated by red boxes, and
  those positively regulated are indicated by green boxes. Solid boxes indicate direct
  evidence for modulation by iron chelators, while dashed boxes indicate potential
  indirect modulation, e.g., through chelator-mediated up-regulation of NDRG1.
