caption: A. A diagram shows the sequence domains and motifs in BRCA1. BRCA1 contains
  an N-terminal RING domain that possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and a C-terminal
  tandem BRCT domain that facilitates phosphoprotein binding. BRCA1 possesses 3 phosphorylation
  sites that initiate the signaling cascade by the ATM-dependent phosphorylation.
  BRCA1 has two nuclear localization signals (NLS) which import BRCA1 into the nucleus,
  while two nuclear export sequences (NES) within the RING domain are responsible
  for the export of BRCA1 from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. B. Signaling cascade
  for BRCA1-mediated DNA damage repair. In response to DNA damage, ATM phosphorylates
  BRCA1. Upon phosphorylation BRCA1 forms a heterodimer with BRAD1, which then recruits
  additional partners such as BRCA2 and Rad5. Upon the assembly of a complex with
  these partners, BRCA1 is then relocated into the DNA damage site, where it serves
  to promote high fidelity repair processes.
