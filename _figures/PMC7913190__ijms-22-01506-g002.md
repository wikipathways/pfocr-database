caption: Caspase-11 upregulation occurs as a result of PAMP and/or cytokine signaling
  and can be amplified by complement signaling. TLR signaling—Exogenous PAMPs, such
  as LPS, that signal through TLRs result in MYD88-dependant activation of NF-κB.
  Endocytosed LPS-TLR4 signals through the TRIF adaptor protein, resulting in the
  activation of IRF3 and IRF7 and activation of type I IFNs, which are responsible
  for caspase-11 upregulation downstream of LPS. IL-1β signaling—IL-1β signals through
  the IL-1 receptor complex, which results in MYD88-dependant NF-κB activation and
  Type I IFN signaling. IL-1β-mediated upregulation of caspase-11 is dependent on
  type I IFN-signaling. Type I IFN signaling—IFNα/β, which is also generated following
  LPS and IL-1β stimulation, signals through IFNAR. This results in phosphorylation
  of STAT1/STAT2 and formation of the ISGF3 transcriptional complex, which significantly
  upregulates caspase-11. Caspase-11 upregulation via Type I IFNs, LPS, or IL-1β is
  significantly impaired in Ifnar−/− BMDM, highlighting the importance of IFNAR signaling
  for caspase-11 expression. Type II IFN signaling—IFNγ signals through the IFNGR,
  resulting in the formation of a phospho-STAT1 dimer, which is capable of directly
  upregulating genes, such as caspase-11, which have IFN-stimulatory-gene (ISG) promoter
  sequences. Complement pathway—the complement protein cleavage product, C3a, is modified
  to C3a-desArg by the carboxypeptdidase Cpb1, which is associated with the C3a receptor
  (C3aR). The modified cleavage product then signals through C3aR, resulting in downstream
  activation of the MAPK pathway. This pathway acts to amplify p38 activation downstream
  of TLR4 and IFNAR signaling, boosting caspase-11 expression.
