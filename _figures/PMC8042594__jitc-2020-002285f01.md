caption: (A) Monocytic and macrophage contribution to SARS-CoV-2 hyperinflammation.
  SARS-CoV-2 directly infects pulmonary pneumocytes, causing cell death and the release
  of danger-associated molecular patterns, activating macrophages. Viral spike protein
  also triggers release of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β,
  IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage inflammatory
  protine (MIP)-1 by alveolar-resident macrophages, promoting monocytic infiltration.
  Additionally, internalization of ACE2 on viral entry leads to increased angiotensin
  II, facilitating reactive oxygen species production, tissue damage, and an NF-κB-driven
  inflammatory gene expression program that includes production of chemokines, cytokines,
  and IL-6. (B) Contribution of IL-6 signaling to COVID-19 inflammatory cascade. Trimeric
  complex formation with IL-6, IL-6R and gp130 leads to dimerization and autophosphorylation
  of JAK1. Phosphorylated JAK1 triggers STAT3 phosphorylation and translocation to
  the nucleus, initiating acute-phase protein production, including chemokines, cytokines
  and IL-6. Phospho-JAK1 may also contribute to acute-phase transcription through
  an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway that relies on
  SHP2 and Ras. Notably, IL-6 also induces expression of SOCS1 and SOC3, which negatively
  regulate JAK/STAT signaling. The classical signaling pathway is largely restricted
  to the lymphocyte compartment, where it contributes to adaptive immunity, whereas
  trans signaling may occur in any tissue type and is generally pro-inflammatory.
  Interventions that may alleviate inflammatory IL-6 signaling (ie, tocilizumab or
  tyrosine kinase inhibitors) are shown.
