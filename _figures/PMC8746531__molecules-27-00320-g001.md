caption: 'Schematic representation of biosynthetic pathways leading from shikimic
  acid pathway to phenylpropanoid pathway. Solid arrow indicates known steps, whereas
  multiple arrows indicate multiple reaction steps. Enzyme abbreviations are as follows:
  EMB3004, Bifunctional 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase/shikimate dehydrogenase, chloroplastic;
  CM, chorismate mutase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl shikimate transferase; C3H, p-coumarate
  3-hydroxylase; CCOAMT, caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl CoA oxidoreductases;
  COMT, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone
  isomerase. ① Showing the ferulic acid biosynthesis via CCOAMT sub-pathway; ② Showing
  the ferulic acid biosynthesis via COMT sub-pathway; ③ Showing the flavonoid biosynthetic
  sub-pathway.'
