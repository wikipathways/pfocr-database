caption: Uptake of E1S from the blood by organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs)
  and other SLC-Transporters. Biotransformation is mediated by phase 1 biotransformation
  (cytochrome P450 and isoenzymes) and phase 2 biotransformation (sulfotransferase
  and sulfatase). The excretion of sulfated estrogens is achieved by the breast cancer
  resistant protein (BCRP, ABCG2) and multidrug resistance related proteins (MRPs).
  Uptake, biotransformation and excretion is transcriptionally regulated by nuclear
  receptors, for example, the pregnane X receptor (PXR), which acts as a xenobiotic-activated
  transcription factor.
