caption: Schematic depicting the canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling systems
  activated during mammary tumorigenesis. Transmembrane signaling by TGF-β is stimulated
  upon its binding and activation of the Ser/Thr protein kinase receptors, TβR-I and
  TβR-II. The physical interaction of TGF-β with either TβR-III or TβR-II facilitates
  the recruitment and transphosphorylation of TβR-I, resulting in its activation and
  subsequent phosphorylation of the receptor-activated Smads, Smad2 and Smad3. Once
  activated, Smad2/3 form heterocomplexes with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus
  to regulate the expression of TGF-β-responsive genes in concert with an ever expanding
  list of transcriptional coactivators and repressors. This branch of the bifurcated
  TGF-β signaling system represents the “canonical” or “Smad2/3-dependent” TGF-β pathway,
  which is the predominant pathway coupled to cytostasis and activated by TGF-β in
  normal MECs (left panel). Alternatively, TGF-β also activates a variety of “noncanonical”
  or “Smad2/3-independent” effectors, including Par6, NF-κB, ILK, FAK, Src, Rho-family
  GTPases, MAP kinases, and the PI3K:AKT:mTOR signaling axis (right panel). During
  EMT and mammary tumorigenesis, the balance between canonical and noncanonical TGF-β
  signaling systems becomes distorted and favors coupling to noncanonical effector
  systems, an event that manifests the “TGF-β Paradox” and the initiation of EMT,
  invasion, and metastasis. These events are further exacerbated by elevated deposition
  and eventual cross-linking of ECM molecules within tumor microenvironments (LOX,
  right panel), an event that promotes tumor rigidity and the activation of mechanotransduction
  pathways operant in amplifying noncanonical TGF-β signaling and its oncogenic activities
  in mammary tumors. See text for additional details.
