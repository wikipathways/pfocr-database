caption: Maintenance of stem cell osteogenic factor homeostasis and maintenance of
  chondrocyte phenotype through the HIF-1 pathway. HIF-1α increases TWIST expression,
  which in turn regulates osteogenic differentiation. Mechanical stimulation also
  promotes TWIST and inhibits E2A; TWIST and E2A interact to activate p21. p21 has
  different regulatory effects on osteogenic factors. Also, p21 positively regulates
  the expression of TWIST and negatively regulates the expression of E2A. Hypoxia
  and HIF-1α maintain the chondrogenic phenotype of cells by preventing cell osteogenic
  differentiation
