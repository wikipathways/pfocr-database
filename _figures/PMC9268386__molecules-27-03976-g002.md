caption: The regulatory mechanism of ERRα in the function of bone associated cells
  and bone metabolism. On the one hand, ERRα impacts osteoblast development and metabolism
  by upregulating BSP/ALP/OPN, Gls-mediated glutamine anaplerosis and inhibiting PPARγ/aP2,
  which ultimately results in the differentiation and proliferation of osteoblasts.
  On the other hand, ERRα interacts with PGC-1β to promote osteoclast formation, adhesion,
  and migration through regulating the expression of OPN and integrin β3, mitochondrial
  metabolism and oxidative processes in a synergistic manner. In the cartilage, upregulation
  of SOX-9 induced by ERRα promotes chondrocyte proliferation, while ERRα expression
  could be activated through the PGE2/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in response to IL-1β
  stimulation, the receptor modulated the synthesis of MMP-13 and caused osteoarthritis.
  Elevated iNOS or cytokines including IFN-γ and TNF-γ could activate M1 macrophages
  to release IL-1β, this positive feedback loop might lead to cartilage erosion and
  osteoarthritis. However, the interactive modulation between ERRα and macrophages
  in the cartilages is still unclear.
