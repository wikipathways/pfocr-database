caption: Model for GigA/B and PTSNtrregulatory pathway. Stress is perceived by and/or
  transmitted to GigA, which then removes a phosphate group from phosphorylated GigB
  (GigB-P). Unphosphorylated GigB functions as an anti-anti-sigma factor and sequesters
  the anti-sigma factor NPr-P from RpoE (σE), which then directs the transcription
  of stress response genes. Additionally, upon GigB binding NPr–P, the phosphate group
  of NPr is transferred to GigB, regenerating GigB-P and eliminating the GigB-NPr
  interaction. Unphosphorylated NPr can then acquire a new phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP) by transfer through EINtr. The active forms of the anti-anti-sigma factor
  (GigB) and the anti-sigma factor (NPr-P) are indicated with gray brackets. Additional
  details can be found in the text.
