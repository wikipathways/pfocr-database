caption: Arsenic affects NRF2 signaling pathway. The transcription factor nuclear
  factor erythroid-derived factor 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) has classically been associated
  with a cancer preventive function through the induction of cytoprotective proteins
  that inactivate reactive carcinogenic species and their intermediates. Arsenic can
  stimulate the activity of the NFR2 pathway mainly through generation of ROS. These
  events can protect the cell during acute/short-term exposure to low doses of arsenic.
  However, chronic arsenic-mediated activation of the NRF2 pathway may result in detrimental
  cellular effects associated with arsenic-induced pathogenesis.
