caption: Replication cycle of ZIKV and the actions of different flavonoids. Free viral
  particles can be disrupted by the actions of curcumin, Psiloxylon mauritianum extract,
  Aphloia theiformis extract, baicalin, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) before
  binding of the virus to cell receptors. ZIKV attaches to host receptors and is internalized
  by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This phase can be inhibited by curcumin and baicalin,
  but the inhibitory mechanism needs to be clarified. Isoquercitrin (Q3G) inhibits
  the internalization and trafficking of viral particles. The acidic microenvironment
  within endosomes allows the fusion between viral and endosomal membranes, resulting
  in viral RNA release into the cytoplasm. The viral RNA is translated into a polyprotein
  (inset in the upper left corner shows the sequential and structural organization
  of the ZIKV polyprotein) containing three structural proteins [capsid (C), premembrane
  (prM), and envelope (E)] and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3,
  NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). The viral polyprotein is cleaved by host and viral proteases.
  NAR, myricetin, quercetin, luteolin, isorhamnetin, apigenin, and curcumin can inhibit
  the NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3 pro). Conversely, sophoraflavenone G, baicalein,
  and baicalin can inhibit NS5-RNA polymerase (RDRP). Moreover, the NS3 protein interacts
  with RDRP to allow viral genome replication, and pinocembrin can impair viral RNA
  synthesis. Phloretin was demonstrated to decrease glycolytic metabolism by downregulating
  the pAKT/mTOR pathway and GLUT1 blockade, impairing ZIKV replication by downmodulating
  energetic metabolism. (?) Highlights molecules with inconsistent results.

  description: Replication cycle of ZIKV and the actions of different flavonoids.
    Free viral particles can be disrupted by the actions of curcumin, Psiloxylon mauritianum

    Isoquercitrin (Q3G) inhibits the internalization and trafficking of viral particles.
    The acidic microenvironment within endosomes allows the fusion between viral and
