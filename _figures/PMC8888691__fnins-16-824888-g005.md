caption: Known communication pathway between microglia and astrocytes in the human
  brain in response to disease. Receptors (underlined) and the signaling molecules
  (italic) are shown with the color of the arrow denoting the cell source (green =
  astrocytes, blue = microglia). The resulting phenotypic changes or movements are
  shown by gray arrows (single or triple, respectively). As microglia become activated
  by PAMP/DAMP signaling via TLR receptors (both blue), they become activated (gray
  arrow). Activated microglia release IL1β and TNFα which bind through IL1R and TNFR
  receptors to activate astrocytes and other microglial cells. This signaling with
  the addition of C1q signaling on astrocytes leads to a neurotoxic phenotype, with
  a loss of neuroprotective functions. Activated astrocytes release IL1β and TNFα
  to propagate a neuroinflammatory response. They also release ATP which binds to
  P2XR receptors on microglia, leading to extracellular vesicle release. Activated
  astrocytes and microglia may also release chemokines (CCL2–CCL5) which bind to receptors
  on microglia (CCR1–CCR5) and stimulate their chemotaxis toward the site of injury/pathogen.
  Inflammation is in part resolved by CD200 binding to CD200R on activated microglia,
  leading them to return to a homeostatic phenotype.
