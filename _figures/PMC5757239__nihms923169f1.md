caption: Cardiac development involves proliferation of cardiomyocytes (CM) from fetal
  stage throughout the early postnatal period. The maturation of CM involves increases
  in cell size, development of sarcomere structure and contractile apparatus, and
  maturation of mitochondria. Zhang et al have identified that inactivation of Tfam,
  a nuclear-encoded protein that controls mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication,
  causes mitochondrial dysfunction and embryonic lethality associated with myocardial
  hypoplasia. Mitochondrial dysfunction triggers excessive reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production and consequently activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway,
  which inhibits CM proliferation during prenatal and early postnatal periods. ROS
  scavenging or DDR inhibition by mito-TEMPO and WEE1 inhibitor, respectively, rescues
  the proliferation arrest. Increased ROS and reduced ATP level, due to impaired mitochondrial
  function, lead to diminished contractility of mature CMs.
