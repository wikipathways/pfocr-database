caption: Rapid sex-selective induction of PKA signaling by low-dose ketamine in the
  rat dHPC. Depiction of phosphoprotein abundance significantly altered by ketamine
  in female (A) and male (B) rats within the PKA signaling pathway. Phosphoproteins
  meeting the significance criteria (p < 0.05; FDR cutoff = 1%) in each dataset are
  outlined in fuchsia. IPA’s Molecule Activity Predictor (MAP) was superimposed upon
  the current dataset, and used fold change values (ketamine vs. saline groups) of
  differentially-abundant phosphoproteins (p < 0.05) within the pathway to predict
  the impact of such changes on upstream and downstream PKA signaling activity. Pathway
  images were produced in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (QIAGEN, Inc.).
