caption: Simplified biosynthetic pathway of sterols in  higher plants. 24-Methyl cholesterol
  is present in higher plants as a  mixture of its (24-R)- and (24-S)-epimers  campesterol
  and dihydrobrassicasterol (; ) and is a precursor for the synthesis of brassinosteroids.  The
  dashed arrows indicate more than one biosynthetic step not shown  here.
