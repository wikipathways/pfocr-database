caption: Diagram showing the mechanisms involved in D2R β-arrestin-dependent pathway-mediated
  ERK activation. After stimulation with an agonist to activate the D2R β-arrestin
  signaling pathway, Mdm2 moves out of the nucleus to ubiquitinate GRK2, which is
  in an Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation state. Ubiquitinated GRK2 then translocates
  to the plasma membrane and interacts with activated D2R, followed by the phosphorylation
  of D2R and recruiting β-arrestin to mediate downstream ERK signal transduction
