caption: '5-fluorouracil (5FU) metabolism pathways. The structure and atom numbering
  of 5FU is shown in the lower right corner of the figure. Antimetabolite activation
  pathways are marked in red. The degradation pathway for pyrimidines is marked in
  blue. The thymidylate synthesis is marked in green. Steps in simplified metabolic
  pathways: 1. Capecitabine, a 5FU prodrug, is bioactivated in the liver in a two-step
  process to 5’-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (doxifluridine; DFUR), while tegafur, another
  5FU prodrug, is bioactivated by CYP2A6. 2. DFUR is converted to 5FU by thymidine
  phosphorylase (TP). 3. 5FU is sequentially converted to 5-fluorouridine monophosphate
  (FUMP), diphosphate (FUDP) and triphosphate (FUTP), which is an active metabolite
  that is mistakenly incorporated into RNA, causing RNA damage. 4. FUDP is also sequentially
  converted to 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine diphosphate (FdUDP) and triphosphate (FdUTP),
  which is an active metabolite that is mistakenly incorporated into DNA, causing
  DNA damage. 5. TP converts 5FU to 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine (FdUR). 6. Thymidine
  kinase (TK) converts FdUR to 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP). 7. FdUMP
  is an active metabolite that irreversibly inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), an
  enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 2’-deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to
  2’-deoxythymidine monophosphate (thymidylate; dTMP). 8. Cyclically dihydrofolate
  (H2Folate) is reduced to tetrahydrofolate (H4Folate) which is then converted to
  5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2H4Folate). Leucovorin (folinic acid) is converted
  to CH2H4Folate and then stabilizes the bond formed between TS and FdUMP. 9. Dihydropyrimidine
  dehydrogenase (DPD) catalyzes the first step of the breakdown of 5FU (mainly in
  the liver) to 5,6-dihydro-5-fluorouracil (DHFU), which is further broken down into
  α-fluoro-β-alanine, carbon dioxide and ammonia, excreted from the body. 10. Thymidylate
  can be salvaged by TK from thymidine (dT) derived from dead cells. 11. FdUTP can
  be converted to FdUMP by dUTP pyrophosphatase and then converted back to FdUDP by
  UMP-CMP kinase. Based on information from Longley et al. () and maps in KEGG (Kanehisa
  et al. )'
