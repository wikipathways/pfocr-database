caption: The impact of sustained changes in cardiac O-GlcNAcylation. Pressure overload,
  diabetes, and other heart derangements lead to elevated O-GlcNAcylation that is
  associated with maladaptation. Pathologic phenotypes can be recapitulated by genetic
  and pharmacological upregulation of O-GlcNAc (indicated in blue) and counteracted
  by blocking the HBP or reducing O-GlcNAcylation (indicated in gray). Changes in
  O-GlcNAc are associated with pathology via changes in transcription, reactive oxygen
  and nitrogen species, calcium handling, ER stress, signal transduction, and mitochondrial
  energetics and function. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HBP, hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway
