caption: 'The molecular mechanisms contributing to liver steatosis following hepatitis
  B virus infection. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can induce the accumulation
  of lipids via three different regulatory mechanisms, including elevated expression
  of FABP1, up-regulation of LXR, SREBP1 and PPARγ and increased expression of GnT-III.
  On the one hand, up-regulation of FABP1 would increase fatty acid binding and transport.
  On the other hand, induction of LXR-mediated SREBP1 and PPARγ would result in increased
  transcriptional activity of hepatic lipogenic genes (FAS, SCD, ACC) and adipogenic
  genes (adipoQ, adipsin, AP2). In addition, elevation of GnT-III would cause glycosylation
  and dysfunction of apoB, finally leading to reduced secretion of VLDL (containing
  apoB, CHO and TG). LFA: Long-chain fatty acids; FABP1: Fatty acid binding protein
  1; FAS: Fatty acid synthase; SCD: Stearoyl-CoA desaturase; ACC: Acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
  adipoQ: Adiponectin; AP2: aP2/adipose fatty acid–binding protein; apoB: Apolipoprotein
  B; GnT-III: N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase III; CHO: Cholesterol; TG: Triglyceride;
  VLDL: Very low density lipoproteins.'
