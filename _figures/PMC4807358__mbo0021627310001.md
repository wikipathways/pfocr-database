caption: Lipid A and its biosynthetic enzymes. (A) Predicted lipid A biosynthetic
  pathway (Raetz pathway) in C. trachomatis. (B) Structure of E. coli Kdo2-lipid A.
  (C) Conservation of lipid A biosynthetic enzymes in E. coli and C. trachomatis.
  Essential enzymes are marked by red blocks, nonessential enzymes by blue blocks,
  and the absence of an enzyme in the genome of C. trachomatis is shown by a white
  block. The existence of an LpxH functional ortholog, LpxI, in alphaproteobacteria
  is denoted by the orange block next to LpxH.
