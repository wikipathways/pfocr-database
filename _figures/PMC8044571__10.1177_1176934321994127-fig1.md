caption: The ARF protein family regulation of auxin-inducible genes transcription
  by forming dimers with auxin response elements (AREs) in the promoters of Auxin-inducible
  genes. In the absence of Auxin, the AUX/IAA transcriptional repressor recruits TOPLESS
  family (TPL) co-repressors by interacting with ARFs, which in turn recruit chromatin-modifying
  enzymes that inhibit downstream Auxin-inducible genes transcription.The steps of
  the Auxin response pathway are indicated by numerical arrows. (1) In the presence
  of auxin, the Aux/IAA, and TIR1/AFB family F-box proteins bind together. (2) The
  F-box proteins are part of the SCF-type E3 ubiquitin protein ligase complex that
  transfers activated ubiquitin (Ub) from the E1/E2 enzyme system. (3) Polyubiquitylation
  of Aux/IAA leads to its degradation. (4) The dimer formed by ARF and AREs is released
  to activate Auxin-inducible genes transcription.
