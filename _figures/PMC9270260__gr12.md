caption: Model for PKCα-induced ERK-dependent cell cycle arrest in the intestinal
  epithelium.A, PKCα-induced RasGRP3–H-Ras–ERK–p21Cip1signaling. In the resting state,
  inactive PKCα associates with inactive Raf proteins in the cytoplasm (1); PKC agonists,
  such as PMA or DAG (generated by ligand induced hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids),
  recruit PKCα and associated Raf proteins to the plasma membrane (2); PMA/DAG also
  recruit RasGRP3 to the plasma membrane, where it is phosphorylated (P) and activated
  by membrane-localized PKCα (3); activated RasGRP3 promotes GTP-loading and activation
  of H-Ras (4); PKCα dissociates from Raf proteins, which can then interact with nearby
  activated Ras (5) for efficient activation of the ERK signaling pathway and induction
  of the cell cycle inhibitory molecule p21Cip1 (6) and growth arrest. B, PKCα-induced
  Ras–ERK–cyclin D1/Id1 signaling. PKCα also activates K- and/or N-Ras through at
  least one other undefined mechanism (7), leading to ERK-dependent downregulation
  of cyclin D1 and Id1 (8). PKCα also promotes ERK-dependent phosphorylation of SOS1
  (9), which may negatively modulate SOS1 interaction with Grb2, Shc, or the EGF receptor
  to dampen growth factor signaling, thereby downregulating growth factor–induced
  cyclin D1 and Id1 and inhibiting proliferation. DAG, diacylglycerol; PMA, phorbol
  12-myristate 13-acetate.
