caption: EZH2 is a RANKL inducible positive regulator of OCL differentiation required
  for silencing of MafB expression by both adding H3K27me3 as well as increasing C/EBPβ-LIP
  at the MafB gene promoter. Therefore, blocking EZH2 methyltransferase activity with
  GSK126 de-represses MafB both by decreased epigenetic silencing and by lack of proper
  RANKL-activation of the PI3K-pAKT-pmTOR signaling pathway. This results in increased
  C/EBPβ-LAP isoform levels with its enhanced binding/activation of the MafB gene.
  Since blockade of EZH2 methyltransferase activity in mature OCL results in condensed
  cytoskeletal architecture, impaired F-actin ring formation and reduced OCL resorption,
  we hypothesize that by modulating actin dynamics, EZH2 modulates cytoskeletal rearrangements
  in mature OCL.
