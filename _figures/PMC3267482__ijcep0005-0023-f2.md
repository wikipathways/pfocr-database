caption: Schematic summary of c-Ret-mediated signaling in SGNs. (A and B) Schematic
  illustration of a mechanistic model for c-Ret-mediated congenital deafness with
  neurodegeneration of SGNs in c-Ret-KI-mice. (A) Wild-type mice (WT) acquire normal
  hearing with phosphorylation of the c-Ret Y1062-mediated signaling pathway. P in
  A indicates phosphorylation. (B) Impairments of the c-Ret Y1062-mediated signaling
  pathway (blue double line and downward dashed arrows in B) cause decreased expression
  of calbindin D28k (blue arrow in B) via Akt/NF-κB signaling, resulting in auditory
  nerve degeneration in c-Ret-KIY1062F/Y1062F-mice (c-Ret Y1062F). This figure was
  drawn on the basis of results of previous studies [, ].
