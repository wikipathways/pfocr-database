caption: 'Models of RAF/MEK/ERK signaling in tumor cells with RTK activation and with
  V600EBRAF. (A) RTK-activated tumor cells: feedback inhibition occurs at multiple
  levels of the pathway, down-regulating both RAF/MEK activation and ERK phosphorylation
  levels. Steady-state levels of pERK are caused by low levels of both MEK activity
  and ERK dephosphorylation by DUSPs. Output of the pathway is low. (B) V600EBRAF
  cells: RAF kinase is active and insusceptible to negative feedback. Increased pathway
  output leads to increased DUSP6 expression. Steady-state levels of pERK are caused
  by high levels of MEK and DUSP6 dephosphorylation of ERK.'
papertitle: V600EBRAF is associated with disabled feedback inhibition of RAFâ€“MEK signaling
  and elevated transcriptional output of the pathway.
