caption: (A) 5mC formation is implemented by DNMT proteins, and can be sequentially
  oxidised by TET proteins to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC)
  and 5-carboxymethylcytosine (5caC). 5caC can be excised by Thymine DNA glycosylase
  (TDG) and replaced with an unmodified cytosine through base excision repair (BER).
  BER-mediated DNA demethylation pathway is referred to as active demethylation. Alternatively,
  the oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC can compromise DNMT1-mediated maintenance during replication,
  resulting in passive demethylation of 5mC DNA methylation. (B) Distribution of 5hmC
  across genomic elements, showing enhancers, promoters and gene bodies. In normal
  tissue, levels of 5mC are shown in orange and 5hmC is shown in light blue. In cancer,
  the levels of 5hmC, shown in dark blue, are reduced. White circle, unmethylated
  CpG; black circle, methylated CpG.
