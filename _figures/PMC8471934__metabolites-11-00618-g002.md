caption: 'The complex network of established and proposed metabolic pathways from
  which VOCs stem and their alterations in chronic liver diseases. Compounds found
  elevated in the breath of patients with cirrhosis are indicated in blue, those downregulated
  in green. Red arrows indicate changes in the metabolic pathways. From the bottom
  left: insulin resistance increases fatty acid (FA) shuttling from the adipose tissue
  to the liver. The resulting excess of acetyl-CoA is metabolised in the mevalonate
  pathway (MVA) to ketones and isoprene, the latter also generates from gut microbiota.
  Dietary limonene is converted to Perillyl alcohol (PA) and trans-Carveol (TC) mainly
  by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. PA and TC are more soluble in the aqueous environment and
  can be excreted in urine. In the cirrhotic liver, reduced activity of CYP enzymes
  leads to the accumulation of limonene in the adipose tissue and increases its permanence
  in the body, resulting in elevated levels in the breath. Incomplete metabolism of
  sulphur-containing amino acids in the transamination pathway, coupled with Cytochrome
  C oxidase deficiency in the cirrhotic liver, lead to elevated levels of Dimethyl-sulphide
  (DMS) in the breath of patients with cirrhosis. Dietary 2-butanol, a flavouring
  agent, and a compound contained in fruit is converted to 2-butanone by αα-ADH. A
  similar pathway may also involve 2-pentanol, a similar compound. Both 2-butanone
  and 2-pentanone have been found elevated in the breath of patients with cirrhosis.
  Lipid peroxidation, a process triggered by increased inflammation of the cirrhotic
  liver, has been proposed to generate alkanes, such as octane, pentane and ethane,
  and medium, long-chain aldehydes. These alkanes have been found elevated, while
  detected aldehydes are reduced. Both classes of compounds can be converted to corresponding
  alcohols by CYPs or aldo-keto reductases (AKR), respectively. Medium-chain primary
  alcohols can be further metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) back to aldehydes,
  which can be converted to corresponding fatty acids and feed beta-oxidation. Secondary
  alcohols such as 2-butanol and 2-butanone may also be generated and contribute to
  increasing the corresponding ketones. Ethanol (ETOH), which originates from the
  diet, sugar fermentation from gut microbiota, and oxidation of ethane, increases
  in the breath of patients with cirrhosis because of shunting and downregulation
  of the main metabolising pathway. However, acetaldehyde, the main bio-product of
  ETOH metabolism, has also been elevated due to downregulation of the downstream
  enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Dimethyl selenide (DMSe) is one of the excretion
  products of selenide metabolism. Selenide blood levels were reduced in patients
  with cirrhosis, to an extent related to disease severity. Therefore, reduced DMSe
  in breath may result from a lack of substrate and impaired selenide metabolic pathway.
  Benzene is a pollutant generated mainly by petrol products and readily adsorbed
  by the body by inhalation. Benzene is oxidised to phenol by the CYP system. Reduced
  CYP activity in cirrhosis may explain reduced breath levels of phenol. Exposure
  to styrene takes place mainly by adsorption of vapours through the lungs. Its reduced
  oxidation by the CYP system explains its increase in the breath of patients with
  cirrhosis. Trimethylamine (TMA) is derived from the diet by microbial degradation
  of precursors such as choline. TMA is readily absorbed and metabolised by flavin-containing
  monooxygenases (FMO) in trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) for urine excretion. Reduced
  FMO activity in cirrhosis may lead to increased TMA in the breath. Indole is a catabolic
  product of tryptophane (TRP) metabolism by tryptophanase (TNA) activity of gut microbiota,
  which alterations in cirrhosis may lead to reduced indole exhalation in the breath.'
