caption: Exposure to acidic pH in macrophages leads to perturbation of redox homeostasis
  and the appearance of redox-altered populations of Mtb. Acidity in phagosomes induces
  the accumulation of soluble forms of metal ions (Fe/Cu) as well as the redox-active
  amino acid cysteine (CySH). The former can catalyze the generation of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) by either driving the Fenton reaction or oxidizing CySH to cystine.
  Transcriptional profiling of intramacrophage Mtb fractions reveals that drug-tolerant
  EMSH-reduced Mtb are particularly efficient in dissipating reductive and metal stress
  during infection. This Mtb fraction channels the flux of CySH into the reverse transsulfuration
  pathway leading to H2S generation (MetB), Fe-S cluster biogenesis (SufR), and mycothiol
  (MSH) production. Induction of these pathways affords protection from oxidative
  stress by increased expression of redox- and acid-sensitive transcription factors
  (WhiB family and Suf system) that regulate Mtb’s antioxidant response, consume excess
  CySH and Fe, and induce the activity of metal and drug efflux pumps. Additionally,
  S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases are found to be highly expressed
  in reduced Mtb, where they can inactivate antibiotics by N-methylation. Blocking
  phagosomal acidification with lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine (CQ) reverses
  intramacrophage redox heterogeneity and reduces isoniazid (Inh) or rifampicin (Rif)
  tolerance in Mtb-infected macrophages as well as in chronically infected animals.
