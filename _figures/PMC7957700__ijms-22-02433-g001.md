caption: The Normal CD8+ T Cell Response. Infected cells will process and present
  a portion of the viral or bacterial protein on major histocompatibility complex
  (MHC) Class 1 molecules. The T cell receptor (TCR) on CD8+ T cells will recognize
  this antigen bound to MHC. The CD8 co-receptor helps with recognition of MHC Class
  I. Upon TCR/CD8 co-receptor binding, the intracellular CD8 and CD3ζ domain work
  together to produce activation signal 1. Additionally, a costimulatory signal involving
  B7 and CD28 is required in order to promote T cell activation, cytokine production,
  and prevention of anergy and apoptosis. Upon cytotoxic T cell activation, the T
  cell releases perforin and granzyme, which act upon the infected cell to initiate
  the extrinsic apoptosis pathway.
