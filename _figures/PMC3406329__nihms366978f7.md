caption: Left panel - Untreated budding yeast cells have the inactive α-factor pheromone
  receptor (Ste2) present at the cell surface in a complex with the inactive G protein
  α, β, γ subunits (e.g. Gpa1-GDP, Ste18, Ste4, respectively). Scp160 binds to mRNAs,
  interacts either directly or indirectly with a myosin motor protein (i.e. Myo4),
  and resides on cortical ER (cER) membranes. The existence of a putative adaptor
  required for Scp160 to bind to ER membranes and/or the myosin motor is illustrated.
  Center panel – Upon pheromone (α-factor) binding to the receptor, GDP-GTP catalyzed
  exchange on Gpa1 results in the release of Ste18/Ste4 to activate MAP kinase cascade
  involved in actin polarization, cell wall integrity, and cell cycle control (not
  shown). In addition, Gpa1-GTP binds to Scp160 and increases the amount of associated
  mRNAs (i.e. SRO7, SEC3, FUS3, STE7, etc.). Right panel – Scp160 and cER are targeted
  to the shmoo tip, perhaps via Myo4, along actin filaments oriented along the polarization
  axis via Ste18/Ste4 signaling. mRNA and cER delivery allows for the localized translation
  and enrichment of polarity/secretion and mating pathway components at the site of
  polarization (to facilitate shmoo growth).
