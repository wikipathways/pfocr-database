caption: MiRNA-mRNA correlation networks. MiRNA-mRNA correlation network was rendered
  in cytoscape. In this network, the miRNAs are demonstrated by diamond shape while
  mRNAs with ellipse. Upregulated miRNA are in red (A), while downregulated miRNA
  are in green (B). Upregulated mRNAs are in pink, light red, and pale yellow, while
  downregulated are in light blue and green, etc. Enrichment results for pathways
  analysis were added in the network. The pathway information was obtained from the
  KEGG database. Target genes in a pathway are marked by the same color. KEGG = Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, miRNA = microRNA.
