caption: Hypothetical concept for the dysregulation of lung epithelial ion and fluid
  transport by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, is endocytosed into the cell,
  and uses the host cellular machinery for RNA replication and translation resulting
  in the production of viral proteins. These viral proteins may potentially interact
  with G proteins, triggering the classic GPCR pathway and activating CFTR. Activation
  of CFTR in turn can inhibit ENaC. Secondary mediators may in parallel or alternatively
  activate GPCRs from the outside (, ). For example, ATP may serve as secondary mediator
  and engage A1AR [(green arrow) which in turn stimulates CFTR; activation of CFTR
  in turn can inhibit ENaC]. UTP can engage P2Y6R (blue arrow) and inhibit amiloride
  sensitive ion transport via ENaC. In addition, UTP can lead to purinergic-mediated
  calcium mobilization from intracellular stores, which may combine with the influx
  of calcium via TRPV4 (acting as a mechano- and/or chemosensor) to increase intracellular
  calcium levels that can in turn activate CFTR; this activation of CFTR can cause
  chloride and fluid secretion, and inhibition of sodium reabsorption via ENaC (ENaC
  is not depicted in the left side of the figure). The potential link between TRPV4
  and CFTR () could involve a Ca2+-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase and the
  classical PKA pathway, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation can cause PKA-independent
  CFTR activation (–). NHERF1 anchors CFTR (via ezrin, not shown) to the actin cytoskeleton.
  Increased levels of cAMP allow PKA and EPAC1 to promote opening and stabilization
  of CFTR at the plasma membrane (), again causing chloride and fluid secretion. ACE2,
  angiotensin converting enzyme 2; cAMP, cyclic AMP; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator; ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; EPAC1, exchange protein directly
  activated by cAMP; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GPCR, G protein coupled-receptor;
