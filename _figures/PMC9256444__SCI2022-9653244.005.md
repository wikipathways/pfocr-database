caption: 'Signaling pathways involved in cancer stem cells. (a) The JAK/STAT pathway
  (extreme left): JAKs get activated when ligands bind to its receptor; JAK1 and JAK2
  auto and transphosphorylate each other and also phosphorylate the tyrosine residues
  present in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. STATs upon phosphorylation by
  JAKs form dimers and are then translocated into the nucleus to initiate the transcription
  of the targeted genes. (b) The Hedgehog pathway (left): Hh, when secreted from the
  other cells, binds to PTCH and allows the activation (indicated by black arrows)
  of SMO. SMO protein complex secretes Gli1/2 and translocates it into the nucleus,
  leading to the transcription of Hh-associated genes (depicted by purple arrows).
  (c) The Notch pathway (right): the binding of the delta ligand to the other cell;
  two different enzymes responsible for two different cleavages are ADAM10 or TACE
  and a metalloprotease that catalyzes the S2 cleavage and hence producing a substrate
  for S3 cleavage via the γ-secretase complex. Due to proteolysis, it mediates the
  release of NCID, which upon translocation into the nucleus starts interacting with
  the DNA-binding CSL protein and MAML which further activate the transcription process
  of the targeted genes. (d) The Wnt pathway (extreme right): Wnt ligand binds to
  Fz, a receptor, and induces the phosphorylation of the coreceptors, LRP5/6, which
  further forms the docking site for AXIN. The binding of the ligand to the receptor
  signals Dvl to recruit AXIN 1 along with the other kinases CK1α and GSK3β to the
  membrane, which interrupts the destruction complex leading to impairment of the
  phosphorylation of β-catenin and results in its destruction. Accumulated β-catenin
  then translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as an activator
  of TCF/LEF-mediated transcription of Wnt target genes.'
