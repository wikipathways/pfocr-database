caption: ( Left) Under homeostatic conditions, CX3CR1 + macrophages sample components
  of the gut lumen and transfer luminal antigens to IRF8 +CD103 + dendritic cells
  (DCs), which in turn promote the formation of antigen-specific induced regulatory
  T (iTreg) cells. iTreg cells expressing retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma t
  (RoR-γt) may regulate tolerance to dietary antigens by a range of mechanisms, including
  the suppression of mast cell activation. iTreg cells may also prevent the conversion
  of naïve CD4 + T cells to antigen-specific helper T 2 (TH2) cells. ( Right) Under
  food allergic conditions, CD11b +CD103 – DCs encounter allergens that are made more
  accessible by a permeable epithelial barrier. Allergen-presenting DCs drive the
  differentiation of naïve T cells into allergen-specific TH2 cells expressing the
  interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R). iTreg cells also acquire a TH2 cell-like phenotype
  characterized by increased GATA3 and IRF4 expression and the release of IL-4 and
  IL-13. These ‘pathogenic’ Treg cells are unable to suppress mast cell activation
  through engagement of the OX40-OX40 ligand pathway. Binding of IgE to the high-affinity
  receptor for IgE (FcεRI) leads to uninhibited mast cell degranulation and IL-4 production.IRF8,
  interferon gamma regulatory factor 8; SCFA, short-chain fatty acid; TGFβ, transforming
  growth factor beta.
