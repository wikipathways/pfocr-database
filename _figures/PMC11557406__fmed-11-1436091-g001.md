caption: Mechanism diagram of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. When viral or bacterial
  infections or genomic instability occur in cells, endogenous or exogenous DNA enters
  the cytoplasm. cGAS binds to the DNA, undergoes a conformational change, and catalyzes
  the synthesis of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) from GTP and ATP. cGAMP then binds to STING,
  causing STING to translocate from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus,
  where it activates the downstream signaling molecule TBK1 (tank binding kinase 1).
  TBK1 subsequently phosphorylates and activates IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor
  3). The activated IRF3 enters the nucleus and initiates the release of type I interferons.
  Additionally, STING activates the IKK (I-κB kinase) complex, further activating
  the NF-κB pathway to promote the expression of inflammatory cytokines
