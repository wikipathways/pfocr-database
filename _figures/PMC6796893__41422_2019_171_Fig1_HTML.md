caption: 'Model for hierarchical activation of different subcellular pools of AMPK.
  Discrete pools of AMPK are activated by different intensities of stimulation: high-sensitivity
  (low stress) activates lysosomal-associated AMPK in response to a reduction in fructose
  1,6 bisphosphate (FPB); medium-sensitivity (moderate stress) activates the cytosolic
  fraction of AMPK in response to a modest increase in AMP (30–60 μM); low-sensitivity
  (severe stress) activates mitochondrial-associated AMPK in response to a marked
  increase in AMP (>100 μM). Binding of LKB1 to axin is necessary for phosphorylation
  of AMPK on Thr172 by the high- and medium-sensitivity pathways, whereas the low-sensitivity
  pathway is axin independent. The different subcellular pools of AMPK phosphorylate
  distinct downstream targets, here exemplified by phosphorylation of either ACC1
  (axin-dependent, lysosomal, and cytosolic pools) and ACC2 (axin-independent, mitochondrial
  pool). A potential implication of these findings is that the immediate effect of
  AMPK activation to low-stress conditions is inhibition of anabolic pathways (e.g.,
  lipogenesis). Activation of catabolic pathways (e.g., fatty acid oxidation) occurs
  only after more severe metabolic stress. AMPK activation in the nucleus was not
  detected even after severe metabolic stress, and this is consistent with a previous
  study, which reported that AMPK activation in the nucleus required elevation of
  intracellular Ca2+. As shown here, it is possible that activation of AMPK in the
  nucleus is downstream of CAMKK2 signaling, which would likely be independent of
  axin, and could lead to changes in gene expression, mediated by phosphorylation
  of transcription factors'
