caption: Wolbachia interferes with Arboviral life cycle by interfering with host factors
  and strengthening host antiviral mechanisms. Wolbachia blocks DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV
  by interfering with the same cellular mechanisms arboviruses control in Ae. aegypti.
  First, Wolbachia downregulates cytoskeletal structures that directly bind to arboval
  proteins for host cell infection. Next, Wolbachia competes for host’s lipid/cholesterol
  for its replication making this nutrient insufficient for the virus. Wolbachia can
  also deplete lipids namely sphingomyelins (SM), cardiolipins (CL), and acyl-carnitine
  that are essential for viruses. Wolbachia also strengthens the host’s immunity by
  activating Toll, IMD, and JAK/STAT via PGRP-LE. The endosymbiont further induces
  ROS release in the presence of an arbovirus by increasing oxidases in the cell.
  This inhibits viral replication and in turn, stimulates the Toll pathway. Wolbachia
  then counteracts the release of antioxidants to sustain its infection within the
  host. Lastly, Wolbachia upregulates receptor gene, AaNotch in Ae. aegypti. This
  receptor gene signals the Delta/Notch pathway. Consequently, the adhesion molecule
  Cadherin is increased strengthening the host’s reproductive ability and ensures
  maintenance of Wolbachia. Delta/Notch also promotes the regeneration of the midgut
  epithelia to prevent systemic viral infection.
