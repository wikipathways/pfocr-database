caption: (a) A gene network shows that mRNA levels of PDGFR and ECM-related genes
  are significantly correlated in human breast cancer. (b) A network shows that transcripts
  of LOX genes are significantly correlated with collagen genes. (c) A network composed
  of TGFβ- and ECM-related genes may represent the reciprocal regulation between the
  TGF-β pathway and the ECM microenvironment.
