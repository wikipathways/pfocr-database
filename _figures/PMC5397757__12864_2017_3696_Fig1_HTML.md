  is produced by a single P450-mediated hydroxylation of (–)-α-pinene. b Frontalin
  biosynthesis occurs through the mevalonate pathway to geranylgeranyl diphosphate
  followed by multiple steps likely catalyzed by P450s, a dioxygenase, and a cyclase.

  of unfed males involves steps catalyzed by P450s, a short chain dehydrogenase, and
