caption: Wild-type p53 (WT-p53) and mutant p53 differentially regulate Nox4 expression
  in both TGF-β-dependent and independent mechanisms. Wild-type p53 suppresses basal
  Nox4 and TGF-β-induced Nox4 expression, whereas mutant p53 (R175H and R280K) positively
  regulates or enhances the TGF-β/SMAD3 effect on Nox4. Expression of mutant p53 alone
  can upregulate Nox4 mRNA and protein expression. The downstream effects of Nox4-dependent
  ROS contributes to increased fibronectin mRNA, phosphorylation and activation of
  FAK, and subsequent cell migration and invasion. This pathway can be inhibited with
  specific chemical inhibitors to TGF-β receptor-1 and SIS3, or overexpression of
  Nox4-DN can diminish TGF-β-induction of these events. Moreover, depletion of endogenous
  WT-p53 by siRNA increases Nox4 expression, whereas depleting endogenous mutant p53-R280K
  reduces Nox4 expression. Collectively, Nox4 is a mediator of pro-migratory events
  downstream of TGF-β and mutant p53, and thereby acts as an attractive target for
  managing or suppressing metastatic disease.
