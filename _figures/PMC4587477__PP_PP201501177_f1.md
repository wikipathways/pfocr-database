caption: A, The trehalose biosynthetic pathway in plants. TPS converts Glc-6-P and
  UDP-Glc to UDP and , which can be dephosphorylated to trehalose by TPP. Pi, Inorganic
  phosphate. B, Model explaining the key function of  in balancing growth and reproduction
  with resource availability. Suc stimulates  accumulation, thereby inhibiting SnRK1
  and allowing growth. Low sugar promotes  conversion to trehalose by TPP, which signals
  resource sequestration in sinks, probably mediated by SnRK1. SnRK1 phosphorylates
  and activates C/S1 bZIP transcription factors that induce TPP gene expression, potentially
  creating a feed-forward loop for SnRK1 activation. C/S1 bZIPs are likely to have
  a function in promoting resource flow to sinks.  levels and SnRK1 activities are
  indicated by font sizes.
