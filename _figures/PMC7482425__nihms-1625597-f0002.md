caption: Schematic representation of synthesis, release and action of catecholamines
  and the respective metabolites released from cardiac paraganglioma and drugs that
  act on the catecholamine pathway. The α-adrenoceptor and β-adrenoceptor blockers
  reducethe effects of catecholamines on end organs such as blood vessels, heart and
  others that harbour adrenoceptors. Metyrosine blocks the rate-limiting step in catecholamine
  synthesis by inhibiting tyrosine hydroxylase. Calcium channel blockers cause smooth
  muscle relaxation in the blood vessel. Ivabradine, an If current inhibitor, acts
  on the sinoatrial node (SA node), thereby targeting the chronotropic effect of catecholamines
  at SA node. Agents such as sympathomimetic drugs (ephedrine, caffeine, amphetamine
  and nicotine) cause displacement of norepinephrine from the stores (vesicular sequestration,
  dominant mechanism indicated by bold arrow) and partly by inhibiting monoamine oxidase
  (MAO). MAO inhibitors block the conversion of catecholamines to dihydroxyphenylglycol
  (DHPG), thereby increasing the concentrations of norepinephrine. Antidepressants
  such as selective-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants
  that inhibit norepinephrine re-uptake leading to increased concentration of norepinephrine.
