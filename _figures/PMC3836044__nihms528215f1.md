caption: The canonical (Wnt/β-catenin) pathway. a In the absence of a Wnt signal,
  cytosolic β-catenin is phosphorylated by a destruction complex comprised of Axin,
  adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase-1α (CK1α), and glycogen synthase
  kinase-3β (GSK3β). Phosphorylation targets β-catenin for βTrcp-mediated ubiquitination
  and degradation by the proteasome. In the nucleus, T cell factor/ lymphoid enhancer
  factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors are bound to co-repressors such as transducin-like
  enhancer protein (TLE), c-terminal binding protein (CTBP), and histone deacetylases
  (HDACs). Nuclear β-catenin is inhibited from binding TCF/LEF through interaction
  with inhibitor of β-catenin and TCF-4 (ICAT). Canonical signaling may also be inhibited
  by binding of Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) to the co-receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein (LRP) 5/6. b When Wnt signaling is initiated, Axin is recruited to the plasma
  membrane and LRP 5/6 is phosphorylated by CK1α and GSK3β, leading to activation
  of Dishevelled (Dvl) and destabilization of the destruction complex. Hypophosphorylated
  β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and is able to translocate to the nucleus,
  where it interacts with TCF/LEF to displace its co-repressors and recruit positive
  co-factors including Bcl9 and Pygopus (Pygo) to activate transcription of Wnt target
  genes
