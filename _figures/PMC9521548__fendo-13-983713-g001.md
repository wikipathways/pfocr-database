caption: The scheme of glucose and lipid metabolism disorder in the diabetic heart
  contributing to diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diabetes-induced insulin dysfunction and
  insulin resistance cause the increase in fatty acid uptake characterized by up-regulation
  of fatty acid β-oxidation and lipid accumulation and the decrease in glucose uptake
  accompanying with hyperglycemia and down-regulation of pentose phosphate pathway
  and glycolytic pathway in the cardiomyocyte. Up-regulation of fatty acid β-oxidation
  further promotes the inhibition of glycolytic pathway and pyruvate oxidation, and
  increases lipid intermediates and lipotoxicity. These metabolic alterations in diabetes
  ultimately cause oxidative stress, further insulin resistance, and cardiac hypertrophy,
  which aggravates the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. NADPH, reduced form
  of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; GSH, reduced glutathione.
