caption: 'Crosstalk among microglia and astrocytes with neurons. During chronic morphine
  administration, there is crosstalk between neurons and glial cells (e.g., astrocytes,
  microglia). Substances such as ATP and glutamate released by neurons stimulate glial
  cell activation: activation of microglia activates signalling pathways (e.g., p38,
  NF-kB, ERK, etc.) and triggers the release of pro-inflammatory substances, which
  in turn act on neurons and glial cells; also, when astrocytes are activated, the
  activation of signalling pathways (e.g., JNK, ERK, etc.) also triggers the release
  of pro-inflammatory mediators, which together act on glial cells and neurons. These
  pro-inflammatory substances further exacerbate this response, leading to more glial
  cell activation and inflammatory response, and ultimately morphine tolerance'
