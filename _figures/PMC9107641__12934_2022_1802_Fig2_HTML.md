caption: 'Designed pathway for butanol and hexanol biosynthesis and the corresponding
  plasmids. A Schematic representation of the heterologous butanol and hexanol biosynthesis
  pathway. ThlA1/2: thiolase A1/2; Hbd1/2: hydroxybutyryl-CoA-dehydrogenase 1/2; Crt1/2:
  crotonase 1/2; Bcd-EtfA/B complex = Bcd 1/2: butyryl-CoA-dehydrogenase 1/2; EtfA/B
  1/2: electron transferring protein A/B 1/2 (all genes from C. kluyveri); AdhE2:
  bifunctional aldehyde-alcohol-dehydrogenase from C. acetobutylicum. Two molecules
  of acetyl-CoA are condensed by acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ThlA) to form acetoacetyl-CoA,
  which is then reduced to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA by 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase
  (Hbd) with NADH as the electron donor. In the next step, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is
  dehydrated by crotonase (Crt) to form crotonyl-CoA, which is then reduced with NADH
  and oxidized ferredoxin (Fd) by a Flavin-based electron bifurcating butyryl-CoA
  dehydrogenase (Bcd) to form butyryl-CoA. From here, butanol can be produced via
  two reduction steps with NADH as the electron donor, catalyzed by a bifunctional
  aldehyde dehydrogenase/alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE2). Alternatively, for the generation
  of hexanol, a third acetyl group derived from acetyl-CoA is added to the butyryl-CoA
  to produce 3-ketohexanoyl-CoA. Analogous to the steps in which acetoacetyl-CoA is
  converted to butyryl-CoA, 3-ketohexanoyl-CoA is again reduced with NADH, dehydrated,
  and reduced again by a bifurcating butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase to form hexanoyl-CoA.
  A bifunctional aldehyde dehydrogenase/alcohol dehydrogenase then catalyzes the final
  reduction steps to form hexanol, with NADH as the electron donor. Butyrate and caproate
  are potential side products and can be derived from butyryl-CoA and hexanoyl-CoA,
  respectively, with butyryl phosphate and caproyl phosphate as the corresponding
  intermediates. After reduction of the acids butyrate and caproate to the respective
  aldehydes via the native AOR (aldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase) the molecules
  can be further converted to the alcohols butanol and hexanol. These alternative
  pathways allow the conservation of energy in form of ATP production via substrate
  level phosphorylation and are shown in grey (adapted from []) B Schematic representation

  cluster and the adjacent ermC sequence is flanked by the mycomar sites (ITR–inverted
