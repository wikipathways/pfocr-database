caption: Cell death pathways can interact with each other, with the caveat that once
  a cell death pathway runs to completion, the interaction ends. The exception to
  this is the lysis of apoptotic bodies by secondary necrosis, which releases cytosolic
  contents, effectively converting apoptosis to lytic cell death. Signalling pathways
  running through RIPK1 will fail if Casp8 is deleted, affecting priming of NOD-,
  LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) and caspase 11,,,–. Caspase 1 driven
  IL-18 can have two interactions with other pathways, first by inducing interferon-γ
  (IFNγ) production to prime caspase 11, and second by stimulating NK cytotoxic activity.
  The terminal events occurring after the MLKL or gasdermin D pores open are catastrophic,
  resulting in loss of cellular potassium, which is the trigger for NLRP3 activation,.
  In the window between potassium loss and membrane rupture, NLRP3 activity will trigger
  caspase 1-dependent processing of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 processing. Finally,
  ASC and caspase 1 can activate caspase 8, triggering apoptosis,,,. Purple lines
  are interacting pathways.
