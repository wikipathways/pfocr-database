caption: Scheme of Tyr action mechanisms based on literature collected for this review.
  Despite a sufficient number of publications on the study of the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
  anti-apoptotic effects of Tyr, the studies performed on brain cells are sporadic
  and limited to studies conducted on cultures of neuronal cells [, ] and astrocytes
  [, ]. Therefore, the scheme reflecting the mechanisms of action of Tyr contains
  significant gaps that can be filled with the results of further studies. In neurons
  under conditions of oxidative stress, the action of Tyr is realized through up-regulation
  of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) и inhibition of apoptotic protein
  Bax translocation into mitochondria, which limits the release of cytochrome c and
  subsequent activation of the chain of caspase reactions, including a program of
  cell apoptosis. The downward trend in nNOS expression is manifested in a regular
  decrease in NO. Tyr significantly increases the expression of cytosolic SOD-1 and
  mitochondrial SOD-2, which reduces the severity of oxidative stress, and in an in
  vivo experiment on a global ischemia model can help reduce the content of lipid
  peroxidation products (conjugated dienes) in the brain tissue. In astrocytes under
  hypoxia/reoxygenation (as models of ischemia / recirculation) Tyr protects cultured
  astrocytes reduces ROS overproduction by increasing the activity of antioxidant
  enzymes (GR, GP, CAT), attenuates the released TNF-α and IL-6 from astrocyte via
  regulating of JNK. The reduction of cytokines from astrocyte might be due to its
  inhibition of astrocyte activation and regulation of the STAT3 signaling pathway
  since Tyr attenuates the expression level of GFAP and the phosphorylation of STAT3.
  At last, Tyr prevents the degradation of IκBα, which leads to the suppression of
  NF-κB function. + or - in the hexagon indicate the direction of Tyr action (activation
  or inhibition, respectively). (A higher resolution / colour version of this figure
  is available in the electronic copy of the article).
