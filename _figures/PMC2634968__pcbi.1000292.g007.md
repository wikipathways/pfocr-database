caption: The two critical network reactions MyD88 dimerization and TRAF6/IRAK1 ubiquitination
  are highlighted in red. Formation of the MyD88 homodimer favors recruitment of IRAK1
  into a complex with TRAF6 . The MyD88 dimer then dissociated from this complex to
  be either degraded or reused. The second critical network reaction, TRAF6/IRAK1
  ubiquitination, occurred via the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc13 and Uev1A,
  and was necessary for activation of NF-kappa-B and AP-1 through canonical IKK phosphorylation.
  Either of the two critical network reactions could completely abrogate the flux
  through the MyD88 pathway even though the TIR- or TIRAP-dependent TLR signaling
  was almost always active.
