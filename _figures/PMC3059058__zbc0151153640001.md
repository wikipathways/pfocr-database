caption: Purine salvage pathway in the intraerythrocytic P. falciparum. Adenosine
  and hypoxanthine salvaged from the host are converted to IMP, which then branches
  out to form AMP and GMP. Excess AMP is deaminated back to IMP to constitute purine
  nucleotide cycle. A molecule of fumarate is also generated for each molecule of
  AMP. The arrow and the question mark have been put in to emphasize that the reutilization
  pathway of fumarate has not been elucidated.
