caption: Mechanism of carbonyl stress and its detoxification with vitamin B6 and glyoxalase.
  Reactive carbonyl compounds (RCOs), which cause carbonyl stress, are detoxified
  by degradation into lactic acid and glutathione by glyoxalase enzymes. Glyoxalase
  1 and 2 (GLO1 and GLO2) are the rate-limiting enzymes in this metabolic pathway.
  Inhibition of RCO generation and the Maillard reaction by vitamin B6 results in
  the suppression of AGE accumulation. This figure is adapted from 2 previous publications,
  with partial modification.,
