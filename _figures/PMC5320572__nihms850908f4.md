caption: This overall pathway elucidation is based on the association of individual
  validated and statistically significant metabolites with KEGG pathways. The butanoate
  metabolism is shown in the center as it was linked to TCA cycle, glycolysis, vitamin
  B metabolism and glutamate metabolism. These pathways are central to energy production.
  Intermediates of these pathways have been found at lower levels in the urine of
  90Srexposed mice at 2.0 Gy (day 7 and 9 after exposure) and 5.0 Gy (day 25 and 30
  after exposure) compared to control mice.
