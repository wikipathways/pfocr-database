caption: Network analysis of the differentially expressed proteins between the Dex-treated
  and control rats identified by the IPA (ingenuity pathway analysis). (A) Brain network
  pathway converged on the central signaling pathway involving extracellular signal–regulated
  kinases (ERK1/2), janus kinase (Jnk), and Akt. The network with the highest score
  related to cell morphology, nervous system development, and function and neurological
  disease (score = 38). (B) Heart network pathway identified the involvement of Akt
  and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) signaling pathways. The network with
  the highest score related to cellular development, cellular function and maintenance,
  and connective tissue development and function (score = 43). (C) Skeletal muscle
  network pathway identified with the highest scoring network (score = 50) related
  to nucleic acid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, and vitamins and mineral
  metabolism. (D) Liver network pathway was identified with the highest scoring network
  (score = 41) related to lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, and nucleic
  acid metabolism. (E) Kidney network pathway was identified with the highest scoring
  network (score = 41) related to drug metabolism, organism injury, and abnormalities
  and renal damage. Nodes in green and red correspond to down- and upregulated proteins,
  respectively. Non-colored nodes were proposed by IPA and suggest potential targets
  functionally coordinated with the differential proteins. Solid lines indicate direct
  molecular interactions and dashed lines represent indirect relationships.

    The network with the highest score related to cell morphology, nervous system

    pathway identified the involvement of Akt and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3 kinase)
