caption: RA pathway is differentially regulated in stem cells from VS and SC fat depots.
  A schematic illustrating RA synthesis / metabolism and downstream pathway regulated
  by RA. RA is produced in 2 sequential steps from retinol to retinal (a.k.a. retinaldehyde)
  by RDH10 and DHRS3, then to all-trans RA by 3 isoforms of ALDH1. WT1, a developmental
  marker of mesothelial layer including VS fat, controls expression of ALDH1A2 isoform.
  CRBP1 transports cellular retinol and retinal. Finally CYP26 family metabolizes
  RA into hydroxy-RA. RA acts as a major signaling molecule that binds to its receptors,
  RARs and RXRs. RARs then bind to its response elements (RARE), leading to modulation
  of various downstream target genes. Genes highlighted in red are those upregulated
  in VS-ASCs whereas those highlighted in blue upregulated in SC-ASCs.
