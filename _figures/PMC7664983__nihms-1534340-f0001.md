caption: Orally administered statins (open circles) enter intestinal cells passively
  or through active transport. Simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin may undergo
  oxidative metabolism by CYP3A4/5 enzymes (triangles) within the intestinal cell.
  Next, statins are transported through the bloodstream into hepatocytes. OATP1B1
  is one of several transporters responsible for hepatic uptake of statins. In the
  liver, statins competitively bind to the active site of HMG-CoA reductase, inhibiting
  the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid (depicted by blunt-ended arrow), which
  is an early step in the cholesterol synthesis pathway (shown in center of hepatocyte).
  Simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin are metabolized by CYP3A4/5, while fluvastatin
  is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 (metabolites depicted by triangles). Pravastatin,
  pitavastatin, and rosuvastatin undergo limited cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism.
  In addition, statins may also undergo glucuronidation or sulfation mediated by polymorphic
  glucuronosyltransferase and sulfotransferase enzymes (metabolites shown as squares).
  Finally, statins may be transported out of the hepatocyte and into bile for elimination
  or into the bloodstream for renal elimination.Estrogens (filled circles) may be
  administered orally or transdermally, or may be endogenously produced. Orally administered
  estrogens must pass through the intestinal cells where CYP3A4/5-mediated metabolism
  may occur (metabolites shown as inverted triangles). Transdermally administered
  estrogens and endogenous estrogens enter the hepatocytes from the blood where they
  may be metabolized by CYP3A4/5 and/or undergo sulfate and glucuronide conjugation
  (diamonds), similar to statins. Sulfate- and glucuronide-conjugated estrogens may
  use the same transporters as statins, including OATP1B1.
