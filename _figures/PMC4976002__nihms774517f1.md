caption: Generation of oxidative stress by ambient UFP and its role in allergic airway
  inflammation. UFP carry a large amount of OC including PAHs and quinones. Once inside
  cell PAHs can be converted to quinones via metabolism catalyzed by CYP1A1 and epoxide
  hydrolase. Quinones on the UFP surface undergo redox cycling between semi-quinones
  and original quinones through one-electron reduction by NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase,
  resulting in the generation of ROS. Nrf2 defends cells against oxidative injuries
  by binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE), together with other transcription
  factors, in the promoters of antioxidant and phase II enzymes, leading to the activation
  of effective protective mechanisms. When the Nrf2-mediated pathway is functional,
  activated antioxidant and phase II enzyme metabolize UFP-associated chemicals and
  remove excessive ROS. However, if antioxidant defense fails, ROS accumulation will
  escalate to cellular oxidative stress, which may induce inflammatory response and
  alter cellular functions in the respiratory (e.g., airway epithelial cells) and
  immune system (e.g., DC, macrophages and mast cells). The resulting allergic airway
  inflammation can be further amplified by the interactions between airway epithelial
  and immune cells.
