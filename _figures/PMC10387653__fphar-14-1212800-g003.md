caption: 'Neuropathic pain involves neuro-immune crosstalk. The peripheral nerve macrophages/spinal
  microglia (Mφ) accumulate after a nerve injury around nociceptors and DRG, inducing
  a variety of mediators, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and CSE enzyme. A close-up shows a
  schematic representation of some elements of the indirect regulation via Cav3.2
  channels: 1) IL-6 (red) binds to sIL-6R (blue) and induces homodimerization of gp130
  (purple) to activate the JAK signaling cascade that triggers upregulation of the
  Cav3.2 channel in DRG neurons; 2) the IL-1β (orange) binds to IL1R (brown), producing
  a second messenger pathway; 3) the reducing agents, such as L-cysteine (L-Cys) and
  H2S molecule, augment T-currents, while the oxidizing agents, such as ascorbic acid
  (AcA), α-Lipoic acid (α-LA), and Zn2+ ion, inhibit T-currents, both processes occur
  through the H191 residue; 4) the Cav3.2 channel can be phosphorylated through kinases,
  such as PKA, PKC, PKG, and PLC enzymes; 5) the Cav3.2 channel can be regulated through
  the glycosylation site; and 6) the expression of the Cav3.2 channel is regulated
  by USP5, a deubiquitinating enzyme that protects the channel from proteasomal degradation.'
