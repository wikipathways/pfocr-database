caption: Chromatin modification upon growth factor stimulation and the effect of small
  molecule inhibitors. (A) Quiescent cells have a variety of co-repressors and chromatin
  remodeling complexes associated with specific cellular promoters through the association
  with the E2F-DP complexes. Growth factor signaling leads to the eventual dissociation
  of these complexes, facilitating transcription and cell cycle progression. (B) Inhibitors
  of Rb-Raf-1 interaction, MAP/ERK kinase pathway, cyclin-cdks and E2F can prevent
  the dissociation, resulting in transcriptional repression of proliferative promoters
  and growth arrest.
