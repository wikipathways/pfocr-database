caption: At steady state, DAF accelerates the decay of C3 convertases, inhibiting
  the formation of C3a and C3b and subsequent complement activation. Upon IAV infection,
  the cell will produce viral proteins, and in particular HA (in blue) and NA (in
  orange). NA is a potent sialidase that will remove the sialic acid content of DAF
  both in the cytoplasm and at the surface. This processing of DAF by NA may lead
  to DAF loss/alteration of function. Desialylation of DAF would then impair the inhibition
  of C3 convertases leading to overactivation of the complement pathway. In parallel,
  the presence of HA at the cell surface may exacerbate complement activation that
  could then not be controlled by a desialylated DAF. The activation of complement
  pathway via HA, combined with the lack of inhibition due to NA sialidase activity
  would induce complement overactivation, leading to C3a release. Moreover, the presence
  of HA at the cell membrane and recognition of desialylated surface proteins by PRR
  would induce an exacerbated immune response (red asterisks). Consequently, an excess
  of innate immune cell recruitment and inflammation would promote tissue damage and
  ultimately immunopathology, worsening disease outcome. (Black arrows indicate confirmed
  events whereas grey arrows indicate speculative events needing further validation.
  Red arrows indicate events that will worsen disease outcome).
