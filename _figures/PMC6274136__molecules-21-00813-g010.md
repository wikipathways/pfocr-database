caption: Proposed mechanisms of 3EZ, 20Ac-ingenol-induced cell apoptosis in hepatocyte
  L-O2 cells. 3EZ, 20Ac-ingenol may directly activation of ROS, and then down-regulate
  Bcl-2/Bax ratio, increase the MPT and decrease the ΔΨm leading to the release of
  proapoptotic proteins, such as cytochrome c and AIF. Next, a group of cytochrome
  c was mediated by APAf-1 to apoptosome formation and consequently activating caspase-9
  activity, further, activating caspase-3 and inducing cell apoptosis. The other group
  of AIF located in the mitochondrial inter-membrane space and induced translation
  from the mitochondria to the cytosol and nucleus, and then cleaved DNA, which finally
  induced cell cycle arrest and caspase-independent mitochondrial pathway apoptosis.
