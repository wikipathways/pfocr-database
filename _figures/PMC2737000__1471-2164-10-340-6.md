caption: Androgen receptor pathway. The annotations of symbols and lines are the same
  as Figure 4. This figure suggests at HR stage, the aberrances in AR signalling can
  be manifested in two steps. The first step is the activation of AR including its
  transport into nucleus without androgen induction, and the second step is the regulation
  of nuclear coactivators and repressors for AR's transactivation.
