caption: 'Cell death pathway in tumor cells. If RNAs possess an RNase‐resistant stem
  structure, they are stably incorporated into endosomes of tumor cells. They are
  captured by Toll‐like receptor 3 (TLR3) in the endosome and evoke activation of
  the receptor‐interacting protein kinase (RIP)1/3 cell death pathways. In some tumor
  cells, two cell death pathways are activated as in macrophages: caspase 8‐dependent
  and ‐independent pathways. The two pathways are schematically illustrated. Apoptosis
  or necroptosis occurs through the presence or absence of the function of caspase
  8. The latter involves the scission of mitochondria and oxidative stress. cFLIP,
