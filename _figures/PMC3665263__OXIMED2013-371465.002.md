caption: 'Innate immune system in pneumococcal meningitis infection. The majority
  of TLRs utilize a common intracellular adapter protein known as myeloid differentiation
  factor 88 (MyD88): it activates IRAK, which is phosphorylated and dissociated from
  MyD88. Thus, it interacts with the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor
  6 dependent signaling pathway (TRAF6). TRAF6 stimulates to the transforming growth
  factor β-activated kinase (TAK1). TAK1 activates the IKK (Inhibitor of IκB kinase),
  resulting in the destruction of IkB and subsequently, NF-κB activation resulting
  in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. This cascade provides a link to NF-κB-inducing
  kinase, resulting in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which induces the production
  of cytokines, chemokines, and others proinflammatory molecules in response to bacterial
  stimuli.'
