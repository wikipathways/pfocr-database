caption: Structural features of the IL-6 family cytokine complexes and associated
  human phenotypes.Upon cytokine ligand engagement, GP130 forms hexameric (IL-6 and
  IL-11) and heterotrimeric (or heteroquaternery) complexes (IL-27, OSM, LIF, CT-1,
  CLC and CNTF) with subsequent signal transduction mediated through the JAK/STAT
  pathway and canonical STAT3 activation. The IL-6 family related cytokine IL-31 is
  shown since it signals via overlapping receptors and explains combinatorial phenotypes.
  Mendelian disorders caused by defects in IL-6 family cytokine signalling components
  are illustrated and inheritance patterns are indicated.
