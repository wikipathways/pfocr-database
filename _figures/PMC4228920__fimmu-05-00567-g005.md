caption: 'Oxidative stress-induced pathways of pPROM and spontaneous PTB with intact
  membranes. Risk factors of pPROM and PTB – like infection, obesity, poor nutrition,
  stress, behavioral risk factors (cigarette smoking, drinking, and drug abuse) –
  can cause oxidative stress (OS) in human fetal membranes that leads to OS-induced
  damages to all major cellular elements (lipids, proteins, and nucleic acid). Damages
  to DNA are especially lethal to fetal membranes and placental cells because they
  lead to oxidation of guanine base, resulting in mutagenic 8-OxoG formation. Telomeres
  are rich in G bases, and oxidation G bases lead to telomere attrition as a part
  of damage repair [base excision repair (BER)]. The pathway of pPROM and PTB may
  be delineated at this stage based on the type of risk and the type of OS response:
  overwhelming OS (chronic OS with smoking, alcohol use, obesity, poor nutrition,
  etc.) vs. infection/inflammation-related acute OS by fetal cells or immunocytes.
  Overwhelming OS can lead to persistent DNA damage and telomere reduction, 8-OxoG
  formation, resulting in DNA damage foci (DDF) formation. Telomere-dependent pathway
  – when OS is too high to be controlled by antioxidant mechanisms of the intrauterine
  tissues, especially fetal membranes, a telomere-dependent pathway arises where either
  OS itself or damaged DNA and other cellular elements can trigger p38MAPK activation
  either through NF-κB activation or direct cellular senescence. This is characterized
  by rounded, swollen organelles, and nuclear condensates. Additionally, senescing
  cells generate a unique set of biomarkers (senescence-associated secretory phenotype
  – SASP). SASP is characterized by cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases,
  growth and angiogenic factors, and eicosanoids, all of which are involved in promoting
  labor. Telomere-independent pathway – in this pathway, oxidized Gs are excised from
  the damaged region by 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1) as a part of BER. 8-OxoG:OGG1
  complex then activates Ras-GTPase and either promotes p53-mediated apoptosis or
  NF-κB-mediated inflammation. The exact mechanism of this switch is still unclear.
  Apoptosis is previously linked to pPROM. The latter pathway of NF-κB-mediated inflammation
  can be linked mostly to PTB with intact membranes.'
