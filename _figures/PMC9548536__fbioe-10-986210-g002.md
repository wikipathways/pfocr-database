caption: (A) Engineered closed-loop approach for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.
  The characteristic increase of blood free fatty acid concentration is used as a
  biomarker to activate GPCR40 and reroute the subsequent calcium signaling to an
  NFAT-operated promoter for the expression of a gene of interest (GOI) to deliver
  a therapeutic protein. Alternatively, a fusion transcription factor of TtgR DNA-binding
  domain and PPARα-sensing domain is used to control the expression of an appetite-reducing
  drug, pramlintide. (B) Engineered closed-loop approach for the treatment of type-1
  diabetes-associated ketoacidosis. The characteristic decrease of blood pH is used
  as a biomarker. Through activation of TDAG8 in engineered cells and rerouting of
  cAMP signaling for insulin production, a closed-loop ketoacidosis response loop
  was established. (C) Engineered closed-loop approach for the treatment of type-1
  diabetes. The characteristic increase of glucose concentration is used to generate
  a closed-loop circuit for the release of insulin. The hyperglycemia-induced intracellular
  increase in ATP triggers potassium efflux through ATP-gated channels, resulting
  in cell depolarization. This causes opening of voltage-gated calcium channels and
  induction of an NFAT-operated promoter, leading to the release of insulin. (D) Engineered
  closed-loop approaches for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. The characteristic
  increase of blood insulin concentration is used as a biomarker and activates insulin
  receptor signaling in engineered cells. This involves activation of the MAPK pathway,
  and subsequent activation of a chimeric TF consisting of Elk1 fused to the TetR
  DNA-binding domain, which drives the expression of adiponectin.
