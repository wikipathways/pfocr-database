caption: Downstream of each receptor, distinct signalling pathways have specific functions
  in proliferation and recombination. Interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R)-mediated signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation induces transcription
  of cyclin D3, which promotes proliferation. In addition, STAT5 directly represses
  Igκ gene accessibility and recombination. The IL-7R also activates phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K), which represses forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), an obligate inducer
  of recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1) and RAG2 gene transcription. By contrast,
  the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) is coupled to the RAS–extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) signalling pathway, which represses cyclin D3 and inhibitor of DNA
  binding 3 (ID3) while inducing E2A. This has the effect of inhibiting proliferation
  and increasing levels of free nuclear E2A. E2A with interferon regulatory factor
  4 (IRF4), downstream of B cell linker protein (BLNK), coordinately enhance Igκ gene
  accessibility. Preferential coupling of the PI3K pathway to the IL-7R, and not the
  pre-BCR, ensures that each receptor has opposing and antagonistic functions. The
  IL-7R induces proliferation and represses Igκ gene recombination while the pre-BCR
  represses proliferation and induces recombination.
