caption: Major routes of methylglyoxal (MG) production and detoxification system in
  plants. Methylglyoxal is produced as a result of spontaneous dephosphorylation of
  glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate (G3P) in the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis and from
  the dephosphorylation of triose phosphate intermediates (TPI) during glycolysis
  in the cytosol of plant cells. The major routes of enzymatic detoxification of MG
  in plants are by the two-step glyoxalase pathway mediated by GLYI and GLYII, which
  depends on the presence of reduced glutathione. A one-step process mediated by GLYIII
  that does not require reduced glutathione has also been proposed, but the functional
  role of this enzyme in MG detoxification is debatable.
