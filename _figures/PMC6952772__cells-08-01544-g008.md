caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the mechanism by which platyconic acid A (PA)
  inhibits hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. PA significantly suppressed α-SMA
  and collagen Iα1 expression in rat HSCs by blocking the transforming growth factor
  (TGF)-β1-dependent SMAD signaling pathways and TGF-β1-independent non-SMAD signaling
  pathways. The mechanism of the TGF-β1-dependent SMAD signaling pathway involved
  attenuation of smad2/3 by enhancing smad7 and the PPARγ. The mechanism of the TGF-β1-independent
  non-SMAD signaling pathway involved inhibition of Akt and ERK1/2. Therefore, PA,
  the active component of Platycodi radix-derived saponin, is a useful chemotherapeutic
  agent that may prevent HSCs activation.
