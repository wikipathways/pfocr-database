caption: Signaling pathways that induce necroptosis. During necroptosis, different
  stimuli are sensed by the cell receptor apoptotic signaling pathway including, TNF/TNFα,
  FASLG/FasL, and TNFSF10/TRAIL that subsequently lead to the activation of RIPK1
  and RIPK3 kinases. The process is followed through different signaling pathways,
  such as ROS generation, mitochondrial hyperpolarization, lysosomal impairment, and
  finally ends up with signs of necrotic cell death. NPs can induce necroptosis by
  stimulation of DNA damage and organelle dysfunctions as well as ROS production.
