caption: Extracellular matrix (ECM) genes include Col27a1, Lama1, Thbs3 and Spp1.
  Compounds and genes are represented by circles (nodes). Genes identified in the
  data are coloured according to the degree of fold change; up-regulated (red) and
  down-regulated (blue). Genes displaying a green border recovered upon CuII(atsm)
  treatment. Compounds and genes which associate with gene interests are coloured
  as grey and connected with black solid edges. Pathways are represented by squares.
  Solid and dash arrows indicate direct and indirect reaction respectively.
