caption: When MoRgs7 forms hydrophobic interaction with hydrophobic surface, MoCrn1
  interacts with MoRgs7, MoMagA and MoCap1 and directs them to endocytic sites. Subsequently
  MoRgs7 couples with MoMagA to undergo endocytosis to late endosomes. As MoMagA dissociates
  from Gβ and Gγ subunits and becomes GTP bound MoMagA, MoRgs7 and MoMagA function
  to promote MoMac1 activation and cAMP signaling, which led to the proper appressorium
  development and pathogenicity. To sustain signal transduction, MoMip11 that interacts
  to MoRgs7 can inhibit MoRgs7 interacting with GTP bound MoMagA to prevent GTP hydrolysis
  in MoMagA. As MoRgs7 and MoMagA are sent back to the PM via recycling pathways,
  MoMagA binds to Gβ-Gγ again following GTP hydrolysis in MoMagA.
