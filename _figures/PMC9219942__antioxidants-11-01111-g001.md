caption: 'Schematic experiments of the YA effect on diabetes in vitro and in vivo.
  In cell assays, YA treatment increased cell viability and decreased intracellular
  ROS accumulation and increased insulin secretion in INS-1 cells exposed to H2O2,
  human amylin, or high glucose stimulation, which was achieved by activating the
  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In in vivo experiments, T2DM model was established by
  feeding a high-fat diet daily for 10 weeks and injecting STZ for 3 days in the fourth
  week. In T2DM mice, YA administration for 6 weeks improved the mice’s health, increased
  insulin secretion levels, and decreased blood sugar levels. It also increased the
  expression of antioxidant enzymes and decreased the levels of TG and TC. (ROS: reactive
  oxygen species; InsR: insulin receptor; PIP2: phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate;
  PIP3: phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-triphosphate; AKT: protein kinase A; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; YA: Tyr-Ala; STZ: streptozocin).'
