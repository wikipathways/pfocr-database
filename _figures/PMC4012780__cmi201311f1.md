caption: Roles of IL-7 signals in pre-TCR development and the homeostasis of T cells.
  (a) The IL-7/Jak3/NFATc1 pathway functions as an alternative independent mechanism
  behind early T-cell development. Binding between IL-7 and the IL-7R induces the
  activation of Jak3, which phosphorylates Tyr371 of NFATc1, and facilitates NFATc1
  translocation into the nucleus. This translocation produces downstream effectors
  that are involved in the function and differentiation of T cells. IL-7/Jak3/NFATc1
  signaling cooperates with IL-7/Jak3/STAT5 signaling to synthesize Bcl-2, which is
  essential for early T-cell development. (b) IL-7 signaling regulates the homeostasis
  of CD8+ T cells in a duration-dependent manner. Intermittent IL-7 signaling together
  with TCRs is critical for the quiescence and survival of T cells. Continuous IL-7
  signaling leads to the production of IFN-γ, which triggers T-cell apoptosis, termed
  CICD. CICD, cytokine-induced cell death; IL-7R, IL-7 receptor; TCR, T-cell antigen
  receptor.
