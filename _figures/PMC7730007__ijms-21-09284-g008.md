caption: Mapping the S1P-S1PR1signaling pathway in differentiated SGBS and 3T3-L1
  adipocytes. WikiPathway was used to identify and visualize genes involved in the
  S1P-S1PR1signaling axis in S1P-treated differentiated SGBS and 3T3-L1 adipocytes
  compared to the vehicle control. S1PR1 refers to sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
  1.
