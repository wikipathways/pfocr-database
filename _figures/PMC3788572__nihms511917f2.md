caption: 'Mechanisms associated with accelerated sarcopenia due to disease conditions
  and behaviors. Although aging contributes to the presence of these atrophy-related
  mechanisms, these behaviors and diseases enhance their activity. The figure is interpreted
  directionally from outer to inner rings (light to dark grey) ultimately leading
  to myocyte and myofibrillar protein loss. Plus signs (+) indicate upregulation and
  negative signs (-) equate to downregulation of a specific pathway. The figure represents
  a step-down approach to how certain disease conditions and behaviors can modulate
  four of the major mechanistic pathways involved in sarcopenia: apoptosis, proteolysis,
  regeneration and protein synthesis. This figure is not intended to be exhaustive
  or detailed (i.e. a signaling pathway) and thus it may be prone to misrepresentation
  because of the complexity of interactions involved with multidimensional conditions.
  However, the model is drawn to illustrate the interactions that serve to feed the
  major pathways that accelerate sarcopenia. These interactions include, but are not
  limited to changes in: pro-inflammatory cytokines, anabolic hormones, denervation,
  mitochondrial function and tissue blood perfusion. Some pathways have feed-forward
  properties where disease etiology exacerbates the condition (e.g. denervation worsens
  muscle perfusion in PAD). PAD: Peripheral Arterial Disease, CKD: Chronic Kidney
  Disease.'
