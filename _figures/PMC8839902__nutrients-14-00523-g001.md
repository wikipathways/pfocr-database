caption: Schematic representation of osteoblast (left) and osteoclast (right) differentiation
  with the involvement of selected important signaling pathways and regulators. Positive
  effects are depicted by green arrowheads. The blue arrows and font show the production
  of selected molecules important in the signaling pathway and also for the processes
  of bone formation and resorption. Osteoblastogenesis is regulated by different signaling
  pathways (including TGF-β/BMP, WNT), resulting in activation of downstream transcription
  factors such as Runx2 and leading to the expression of osteoblastogenic markers
  by osteoblasts, e.g., type I collagen, ALP, OPN, BSP and OCN. The canonical WNT
  pathway activates downstream signaling cascades, resulting in β-catenin translocation
  into the nucleus which enhances osteoblastogenic target gene expression. TGF-β and
  BMPs are secreted growth factors belonging to the TGF-β superfamily, which play
  an essential role in development, tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Canonical
  TGF-β signaling mobilizes transcription factors Smad2 and Smad3 to interact with
  other transcription factors and induces Runx2-mediated gene expression. Similar
  to TGF-β, canonical BMP signaling also transmits signals through Smad transcription
  factors. Moreover, BMPs and TGF-β can induce Runx2 through the MAPK signaling pathway.
  Osteocytes represent a differentiated stage of the osteoblast lineage and they have
  key regulatory roles in bone and mineral homeostasis. Osteoclasts differentiate
  from cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage in response to the osteoclastogenic
  cytokines M-CSF, RANKL and ITAM. As a result, mononuclear osteoclast precursors
  finally fuse into mature polykaryons which produce protons and proteolytic enzymes
  (especially cathepsin K) to dissolve bone minerals and degrade bone matrix proteins.
