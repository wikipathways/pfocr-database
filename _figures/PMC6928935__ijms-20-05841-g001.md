caption: 'The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Activation of P13K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to form phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3
  prompts the activation of downstream processes such as AKT, which transmits signals
  to effectors including mTOR complexes to enhance cellular processes. mTORC1 is stimulated
  during cell activation, whereby T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulates the activation
  of P13K. mTORC1 includes catalytic subunits of mTOR such as regulatory-associated
  protein of mTOR (RAPTOR), mammalian lethal with sec-13 protein 8 (MLST8), proline-rich
  Akt-substrate 40 kDa (PRAS40), and DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein
  (DEPTOR). mTORC2 comprises three proteins: RICTOR, MLST8, and SIN1. Activation of
  mTORC2 occurs through the phosphorylation of AKT, while mTORC1, when activated,
  phosphorylates effectors that are major regulators of protein translation including
  translation-regulating factors ribosomal S6 kinase-1 (S6K-1) and eukaryote translation
  initiation factor 4E binding protein-1 (4EBP1) to enhance protein synthesis.'
