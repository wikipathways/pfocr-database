caption: 'Differentially expressed genes in rice roots following colonisation by H.
  seropedicae. Genes involved in siderophore synthesis and transport, the methionine
  salvage pathway and ethylene synthesis are shown. Numbers in parentheses represent
  the fold change. H. seropedicae SmR1 induces methionine recycling and mugineic acid
  (MA) synthesis as well as the expression of transporters involved in iron metabolism.
  The expression of those genes marked with an asterisk was confirmed by RT-qPCR Abbreviations:
  AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; ACC, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate; ACS, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate
  synthase; ACO, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase; MTA, 5′-methylthioadenosine;
  MTR, 5′-methylthioribose; MTK, methylthioribose kinase; MTR-1-P, 5′-methylthioribose-1-phosphate;
  KMTB, 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate; ARD, acireductone dioxygenase; SAMS, S-adenosylmethionine
  synthetase; NAS, nicotianamine synthase; NAAT nicotianamine aminotransferase; DMAS,
  deoxymugineic acid synthase; Tom1, transporter of mugineic acid 1; ENA1 (efflux
  transporters of nicotianamine 1); Nramp6, Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage
  Protein; IRT2(iron-regulated transporter 2); YSL16 (yellow strip-like gene 16);
