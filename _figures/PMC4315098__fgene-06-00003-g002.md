caption: Mammalian cardiolipin remodeling. CL that is synthesized by CLS on the matrix-facing
  leaflet of the IMM can by remodeled by three different pathways. While no single
  enzyme has been demonstrated to be required to initiate CL remodeling in mammals,
  several phospholipases of the iPLA2 family have been demonstrated to have a role
  in the process. Additionally, the submitochondrial localization of the phospholipases
  and the mechanisms by which CL gains access to these enzymes are unknown. After
  a fatty acyl chain is hydrolyzed from CL, generating MLCL, MLCL can be acylated
  back to CL by acyltransferases or transacylases. MLCLAT1 on the matrix-leaflet of
  the IMM, TAZ on the IMS-facing leaflets of the OMM and IMM, and ALCAT1 on the ER
  MAM all have the capacity to re-acylate MLCL. The acyltransferases, ALCAT1 and MLCLAT1,
  use acyl-CoAs as an acyl chain donor to acylate MLCL. In contrast, the transacylase
  TAZ uses acyl chains donated from other phospholipids. The activity of TAZ is required
  to establish the steady state physiological CL molecular form. In contrast, the
  CL formed by ALCAT1 is more sensitive to oxidative damage and associated with pathologic
  states. Dashed arrows describe uncharacterized steps and pathways. In the phospholipid
  key, unremodeled CL corresponds to the newly synthesized CL that enters the pathway
  at the point of CLS (black head group). CL can undergo either physiologically relevant
  CL remodeling (green head group) or pathological remodeling (red head group).
