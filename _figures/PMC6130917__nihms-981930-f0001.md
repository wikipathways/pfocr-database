caption: Sugar phosphate stress caused due to intracellular accumulation of phosphosugars
  triggers expression of the transcription factor SgrR. SgrR, in turn induces transcription
  of the 227 nucleotide sRNA SgrS, which also encodes a small 43 aa protein SgrT (blue).
  The other features of this sRNA include the base-pairing region (red) and the Hfq
  binding region (poly U tail). To relieve the sugar phosphate stress SgrS represses
  translation of mRNAs coding for sugar transporters (PtsG and ManXYZ) and other mRNAs
  involved in various metabolic pathways (Asd, AdiY, FolE and PurR) to help restore
  metabolic homeostasis during stress conditions. SgrS also activates translation
  of a phosphatase (YigL) that dephosphorylates the phosphosugars for export out of
  the cell. SgrT meanwhile is expressed from SgrS later and inhibits the activity
  of the glucose transporter PtsG, thereby both the sRNA and the encoded small protein
  act together in the same pathway to combat sugar phosphate stress.
