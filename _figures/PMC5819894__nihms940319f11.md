caption: Metabolic enzymes targeted by p53. p53 regulates basal expression of AIF
  and SCO2 and facilitates oxidative phosphorylation. The expression of GLUT1, GLUT4,
  and HK2 is negatively regulated by p53, whereas TIGAR expression is induced by p53.
  The net result of p53-mediated regulation of these glycolytic enzymes is the suppression
  of glycolysis. In addition, p53 directly binds and inhibits G6PD activity and downregulates
  the pentose phosphate pathway.
