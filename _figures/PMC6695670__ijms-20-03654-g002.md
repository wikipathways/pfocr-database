caption: Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent
  and -independent pathways. The main ligands associated to TLRs are indicated, and
  required their TLR homo- or hetero-dimerization for its activation. All TLRs, except
  TLR3, can activate the MyD88-dependent pathway. TIR domain containing Adaptor Protein
  (TIRAP) is associated to TLR1, TLR2, TLR4 and TLR6 and can activate the MyD88-dependent
  pathway, which involves the activation in cascade of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase
  (IRAK)-4, IRAK-1/2, TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-6, the IκB Kinase (IKK)
  complex and IκB proteins, which results in IκB ubiquitination and degradation. Then,
  NF-κB can freely translocate to the nucleus and modulate the expression of genes
  containing NF-κB binding sites. The MyD88-independent pathway is activated only
  by TLR3 and TLR4 through their association with the TIR Domain-Containing Adapter
  Protein Inducing IFN-β (TRIF) and the Translocation Associated Membrane Protein
  (TRAM), which phosphorylates the IKKε-IKKι-TBK1 complex. This finally activates
  interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which activates IFN-α and -β transcription,
  as well as other interferon-induced genes.
