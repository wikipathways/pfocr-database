caption: Signaling pathways regulated by SHP2.SHP2 binds to receptors and adaptor
  proteins and facilitates positive signaling to multiple signaling pathways involved
  in important cellular pathways that control proliferation, migration, differentiation,
  growth, and survival. SHP2 dephosphorylates Src, FAK, and p190RhoGAP, leading to
  activation of RhoA/ROCK (left panel). SHP2 also dephosphorylates IRS-1 to mediate
  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (middle panel). In addition, several mechanisms have
  been proposed for activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway, including dephosphorylation
  of the SPROUTY inhibitor and recruitment of GRB2/SOS activators (Right panel), but
  additional substrates are thought to be involved but have yet to be identified.
