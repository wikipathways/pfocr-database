caption: Molecular Mechanism Diagram illustrating the involvement of ZYJSW in Osteoblast
  Differentiation in SOP.In the aging process, Kidney Deficiency can lead to the manifestation
  of symptoms such as osteoporosis and muscle loss, accompanied by an increase in
  GCN5L1 expression. Subsequently, the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated, directly inhibiting
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, leading to the development of osteoporosis. Meanwhile,
  GCN5L1 causes a decrease in the expression of proteins related to mitochondrial
  biogenesis (such as TFAM, PGC-1α, and NRF-1), indirectly affecting the transduction
  of the Wnt signaling pathway. However, ZYJSW regulates PI3K/Akt and mitochondrial
  biogenesis through GCN5L1, thereby upregulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, ultimately
  exerting anti-osteoporotic effects and treating Kidney Deficiency syndrome
