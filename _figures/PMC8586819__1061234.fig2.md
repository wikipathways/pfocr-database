caption: 'T-cell differentiation. The differentiation pathway of exhausted T cells
  (left panel) is distinct from that of effector T cells (right panel), and these
  cells show clear phenotypic and functional differences. The differentiation pathway
  of dysfunctional CLL T cells (middle panel) is currently unknown and these cells
  show features of exhausted as well as effector T cells. The dotted lines represent
  the possibility of CLL T cells to be on the path towards exhaustion or effector
  cell. The phenotypic characteristics depicted here are cell-surface markers, metabolic
  features and transcription factor profiles. PD-1: programmed death protein-1, CTLA4:
  cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4, TIM3: T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain
