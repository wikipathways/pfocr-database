caption: Signaling pathway of melatonin via G-protein-coupled receptors. Melatonin
  primarily signals through two G-protein-coupled receptors, MT1 and MT2. Upon melatonin
  binding, the MT1 homodimer receptor and MT2 homodimer receptor couples with Gi proteins,
  inhibiting adenylate cyclase. This results in decreased cAMP production and subsequent
  reduced activation of PKA. MT1 and MT2 heterodimer activation can also couple with
  Gq/11 proteins to stimulate PLC. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of PIP2 into
  IP3 and DAG. IP3 subsequently promotes calcium release from intracellular stores,
  elevating intracellular calcium levels. Simultaneously, DAG and calcium can activate
  PKC, which influences a broad spectrum of cellular activities. PKC modulates numerous
  cellular processes by phosphorylating target proteins. The heterodimerization of
  MT1 and MT2 in the placenta has yet to be studied. However, the binding of melatonin
  on the MT1 homodimer and MT2 homodimer has been shown to elicit antioxidant and
  anti-inflammatory responses in placental cells by reducing oxidative stress and
  inflammation. Moreover, activating these receptors in these cells indicates autocrine
  and paracrine activity, imperative to placental homeostasis and fetal development.
