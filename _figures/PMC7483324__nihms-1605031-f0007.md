caption: Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Aph shown as grey circle) and hemin (H in black
  circle) increases the activity of TDO that leads to increased accumulation of L-kynurenine.
  Hemin and bacterial-mediated TDO activity and L-kynurenine accumulation scavenge
  and inhibit ROS resulting in favorable condition for A. phagocytophilum growth and
  survival. L-kynurenine in the presence of hemin allows rapid bacterial growth. However,
  conversion of L-kynurenine to 3-HK by KMO produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that
  probably controls the bacterial infection. The conversion of L-kynurenine to KA
  inhibits ROS production probably through its agonist action on NMDR. This could
  lead to the block of L-glutamate release and activation of NADPH oxidase. At low
  concentration, KA may support A. phagocytophilum growth probably through inducing
  L-glutamate release that prevents NADPH oxidase activation. Hemin could induce auto
  oxidation of 3-HK to hydroxanthommatin that can scavenge ROS through its action
  on superoxide anion. The metabolism of L-kynurenine and 3-HK could improve the level
  of L-glutamate release in the cells through direct participation of KAT reaction
  or after transamination of alpha-ketoglutarate by alanine transaminase (ALT) in
  the presence of L-alanine from KNYU reaction. L-glutamate can directly participate
  in A. phagocytophilum TCA cycle (Aph TCA in grey circles) or can be used to synthetize
  arginine to facilitate A. phagocytophilum survival. Finally, in the absence of hemin,
  KAT can prevent the accumulation of 3-HK by its conversion to XA, thereby facilitating
  A. phagocytophilum growth in tick cells.
