caption: Pathway of synthesis of PtdInsP. The reactions examined leading to the formation
  of PtdInsP starting from PtdOH are depicted. Note that PtdOH, in addition to being
  conveyed to CDP-DAG, can be channeled to DAG and the Kennedy pathway of phospholipid
  synthesis. Because this pathway is not examined, it was not included in the figure.
papertitle: c-Fos activates and physically interacts with specific enzymes of the
  pathway of synthesis of polyphosphoinositides.
