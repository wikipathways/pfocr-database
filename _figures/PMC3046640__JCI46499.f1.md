caption: (A) EBV is amplified by permissive epithelial cells (lytic infection) and
  infects mucosal naive B cells. The viral default pathway in B cells is latent infection,
  where EBV persists as an episome (red circle). A minority of infected B cells are
  transformed (TrB). In infectious mononucleosis, a significant expansion of transformed
  lymphoblastoid cells occurs. Anti-EBV antigen CD4+ and CD8+ T cells control the
  proliferation of transformed cells. EBV persists in B lymphocytes, as part of the
  long-lived memory B cell pool (MeB). (B) Early events during KSHV infection are
  less established. It is uncertain whether B cells become infected after amplification
  of KSHV in epithelium. Data presented in this issue suggest that KSHV induces significant
  spontaneous lytic replication ex vivo in tonsillar-derived B cells (). This lytic
  infection is suppressed when infected B cells come in contact with activated CD4+
  T cells. The suppression of spontaneous viral lytic cycle entry in B cells is MHC
  unrestricted and not dependent on killing of target cells. New data also suggest
  that the primary target for KSHV in tonsillar explants could be IgM+ memory B cells
  (). The majority of KSHV latent infected B cells after exposure of tonsillar explants
  to virus express IgMλ. KSHV induces plasmablastic differentiation of these IgMλ+
  cells. An enrichment of IgMλ-expressing plasmablasts also occurs in inducible vFLIP
  knockin mice, targeting vFLIP to different stages of B cell proliferation (). Such
  IgMλ+ infected plasmablasts are thought to cause KSHV-related MCD. Lytic infected
  cells are indicated by disrupted nuclear membranes.
