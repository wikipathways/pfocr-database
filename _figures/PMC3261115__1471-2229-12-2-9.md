caption: A proposed role of TDP biosynthesis and TDP-dependent enzymes in stress sensing
  and adaptation in plants. Environmental stress damages the main TDP-dependent enzymes
  in plants (TK, PDH, KGDH, DXPS) causing them to function as sensors of these stimuli.
  The further propagation of stress sensing processes activates the expression of
  thiamine/TDP biosynthetic enzymes (THI1, THIC, TH1 and TPK) that are necessary for
  the regeneration of the TDP-dependent pathways such as the Calvin-Benson cycle (CBC),
  the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCAC), and the
  isoprenoid phosphate biosynthesis pathway (IPP). This in turn facilitates the activation
  of certain defense mechanisms and the production of stress protecting molecules
  including thiamine which can function as an antioxidant or as a stress alarmone.

  thaliana seedlings under salt and osmotic stress conditions is mediated by abscisic
  acid at the early stages of this stress response.
