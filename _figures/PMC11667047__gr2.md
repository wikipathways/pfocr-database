caption: 'The molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological and pharmacological
  effects of 5-ALA (in the presence of Fe2+)The green line indicates positive regulation,
  the red line indicates inhibition, the dashed line represents indirect effects.
  5-ALA reveals an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway
  through IKK and activating PPARγ signaling (via PGC1α). Its impact on pro-oxidant
  cascades is mitigated by its ability to induce the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway and
  PPARγ. Enhanced Nrf2-dependent synthesis of HO-1 leads to the production of heme-derived
  reaction products (CO, ferrous iron, biliverdin, and bilirubin), which may contribute
  to cytoprotection through antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects. Additionally,
  5-ALA, whether imported into the mitochondrion exogenously (possibly via transport
  proteins like SLC25A38) or endogenously produced, regulates the expression of mitochondrial
  proteins (COXIV, UCP1, and UCP2), promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and activating
  oxidative phosphorylation. The increase in SREBP-1c expression driven by 5-ALA enhances
  the biosynthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides; however, it is subject to inhibitory
  control by another target of 5-ALA, AMPK. Furthermore, AMPK activates UCP1 and UCP2
  via PGC1α. The decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) due to UCP2 may
  reduce the potential for ROS/RNS formation in mitochondria: this occurs by decreasing
  the efficiency of electron transport, which reduces the likelihood of free radical
  formation. By increasing the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT2, 5-ALA enhances the cellular
  uptake of glucose. Once inside the cell, glucose can undergo glycolysis, a metabolic
  process that generates ATP. This promotes glucose uptake and utilization, supporting
  the energy requirements of the cell, thus ensuring proper cellular function and
  metabolism. Abbreviations: ABCB10, ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 10; 5-ALA,
