caption: Venous thrombosis is mainly triggered by a reduction in blood flow velocity.
  This reduced blood flow results in an aberrant activation of immunothrombosis, in
  which a sterile inflammatory response sets the coagulation cascade in motion (part
  a). Reduced blood flow activates mast cells within the venous vessel wall, which
  release histamine and activate endothelial cells to mobilize the adhesion molecules
  P-selectin and von Willebrand factor (vWF) to their surface. Innate immune cells
  and platelets are recruited to the endothelial surface, which is supported by the
  binding of all-thiol high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) released from platelets
  to the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor
  2 (TLR2) on monocytes and CXCR2 on neutrophils (part b). CXCR2 activation together
  with oxidized disulfide HMGB1 interacting with RAGE induce the release of neutrophil
  extracellular traps (NETs), which are formed in a protein-arginine deiminase type
  4 (PAD4)-dependent mechanism. Monocytes are activated by platelet-derived oxidized
  HMGB1 to release pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and IL-1β, reinforcing
  innate immune cell activation (part c). In addition, monocytes release tissue factor
  (TF), which is activated by protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI) and unleashes the
  extrinsic coagulation cascade. Clot formation is triggered by TF-dependent thrombin
  generation and supported by the intrinsic coagulation pathway initiated by the activation
  of factor XII (FXII) on NETs (part d).
