caption: 'Chemical induced senescence. Acetaminophen, acrolein, chlorpyrofos, chloroquine,
  and heavy metals exposure disrupts unfolded protein response, UPR. Nutrient utilization
  is then shifted toward glycolysis, leading to: (1) Enhanced AMPK signaling driven
  by excess AMP, resulting in proliferative latency and pRB/p16 pathway activation.
  (2) Excess pyruvate enters mitochondria for conversion into AcCoA; this leads to
  mitochondria! overload and swelling, ROS generation and toxic cell acidification.
  (3) Oxidative stress from mitochondria damages cytoplasmic proteins and DNA; AcCoA
  functions as a acetyl donor for localized histone hyperacetylation, while histone
  chaperones Asf1 and HIRA greatly remodels chromatin independently of replicative
  state of the cell. Gene expression resulting from chromatin reprogram results in
  senescent associated secretory phenotype (SASP), enriched in tumor suppressor proteins,
  transcription factors, microRNAs, growth factors, proteases, and inflammatory cytokines
  (e.g., p-galactosidase, p16INK4a, IL-6, CXCR2, IL-1 receptor, C/EBPp, and NF-KB).'
