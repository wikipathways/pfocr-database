caption: HMGB1-mediated EBI post-SAH. During SAH, after a HMGB1 translocation from
  nucleus to cytosol, extracellular HMGB1 interacts with TLR4 (via MD-2) and RAGE
  (via Ras) and initiates the MyD88 and JAK pathways. HMGB1 is also able to stimulate
  ERK1/ERK2 pathways. HMGB1 drives an inflammatory cascade via the JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway following SAH which ultimately resulted in the translocation of NF-κB p-65
  to the nucleus to activate transcription of pro-inflammatory genes (IL-1β and TNF-α).
  In addition, HMGB1 also amplifies the secretion of VCAM, ICAM and E-selectin. In
  this regard, HMGB1 mediate the early brain injury (EBI) followed SAH as well as
  vascular remodeling post-SAH (mainly by triggering VSMCs via IFN-γ interaction).
