caption: The schematic diagram illustrates the mechanism by which high Hcy levels
  promote hypertension. This occurs through the upregulation of H3K79hcy modifications,
  thereby epigenetically regulating the expression of TRX, GPX1, and related pathway
  factors such as NFkB to enhance oxidative stress, or by stimulating inflammation
  via the upregulation of ICAM1
