caption: Hippo pathway components that are known to function in microglia under cerebral
  ischaemia or stroke conditions (see ). On YAP activation by phosphorylation at tyrosine
  (Tyr) residues (‘YAP ON’), YAP translocates to the nucleus to initiate specific
  gene transcription. On YAP inactivation (phosphorylation at serine (Ser) residues),
  YAP translocates to the cytoplasm (‘YAP OFF’). Phosphorylation (P) at the relevant
  residues by the upstream kinase is indicated by arrowed lines. Solid lines indicate
  experimentally proven pathways. Dotted lines indicate potential or likely pathways
  that have not yet been shown experimentally. Components in the nuclear and cytoplasmic
  components are labelled.
