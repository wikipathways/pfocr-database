caption: ROS generation might play a critical role in the initiation of p,p′-DDT-induced
  apoptosis of human liver cells through two mechanisms, one was the mitochondria-mediated
  pathway including elevation of ROS, decrease in ΔΨm along with the cytochrome c
  release from mitochondria into the cytosol, and activation of the caspase 9 and
  3 in our previous study; and the other was the elevation of ROS, which resulted
  in the activation of NF-κB and expression of FasL, then triggered FasL-dependent
  pathway in the present study.
