caption: Schematic illustration of the role of inflammasomes in lupus nephritis. ATP
  released from dead cells activates P2X7 on the cell membrane, inducing the K+ efflux
  and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. The assembly of NLRP3 inflammasomes and maturation
  of caspase-1 caused the cleavage of pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-1β, as well as the release
  of the N-terminal gasdermin D to induce pyroptosis. The neutrophil extracellular
  trap releases a large amount of dsDNA and other cellular components and induces
  the formation of a dsDNA-containing immune complex, which promotes the activation
  of NLRP3 inflammasomes via TLRs. The endogenous RNA-containing complex can also
  activate NLRP3 inflammasomes through the endosome-located TLR7/8 signaling pathway.
  AIM2 and another IFI family member IFI16 can sense/recognize dsDNA, leading to the
  activation of caspase-1 and maturation of IL-18 and IL-1β. The signature cytokine
  of lupus, IFN-α, binds to IFN receptors on the cell surface, which regulate the
  expression and maximum activity of AIM2 inflammasomes. Released IL-1β, IL-18, and
  other inflammatory mediators resulted in endothelial leakage, immune cell infiltration,
  and finally tissue inflammation and functional deterioration of the kidney.
