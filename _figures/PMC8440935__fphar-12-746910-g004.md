caption: 'Changes in spermine metabolism related to HFS susceptibility. (A) Connections
  of correlations. The stacked bar charts show the connections between differentially
  expressed features (DEFs) from all omics datasets with spermine, serotonin, and
  spermidine (selected based on MOFA LF1 weight and pathway enrichment analysis).
  (B) Correlation network with spermine, serotonin, and spermidine, excluding DNA
  methylation. A spermine-spermidine-serotonin metabolite-gene correlation network
  was constructed. The network included only paired DEFs with significant correlations
  (Spearman correlation, p < 0.05) in all omics datasets, excluding DNA methylation.
  The relatively important DEFs are labeled with feature names. Visualization was
  achieved with Gephi software (v0.9.2). Node colors represent the type of omics,
  and node sizes represent the strength of connections between features. Red edges
  represent positive correlations, and green edges represent negative correlations.
  (C, D) Metabolism and related metabolic processes of spermine (C) and serotonin
  (D). Boxplots show the relative expression levels of the relevant DEFs in groups
  HFS0, HFS1, and HFS2/3 (from left to right). Statistical significance was set as:
  *p <  0.05 for HFS1 vs HFS0, HFS2/3 vs HFS0; #p < −0.05 for HFS2/3 vs HFS1 by differential
  expression analysis using limma.'
