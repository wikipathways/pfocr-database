caption: Schematic of the C. elegans synaptic signaling network with emphasis on the
  Gαspathway. Shown are the three major Gα-signaling pathways of the network with
  the Gαo and Gαq branches of the network in skeletal form (most components not shown).
  Solid lines indicate that direct interactions are known or likely, while dashed
  lines indicate predicted interactions, unknown components, or known components that
  are not shown. Proteins that promote locomotion and/or neurotransmitter release
  are shown in green, while proteins that inhibit locomotion and/or neurotransmitter
  release are shown in red. The model is based on findings from this study (for PDE-4)
  and the following previous studies.
