caption: Signaling pathways and targets for LAM. Binding of ligands to cell surface
  receptors such as the insulin receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor
  (PDGF) result in phosphorylation of downstream proteins (e.g., IRS 1, PI3K, PDK1
  downstream of IRS 1) and ultimately Akt. The estrogen receptor (ER) can also signal
  through Akt. Akt activates the TSC1/TSC2 complex, which in turn downregulates the
  activity of mTOR, the mammalian target of rapamycin, through an intermediate protein
  called Rheb. In the absence of TSC1 or TSC2, the mTORC1 complex (composed of mTOR
  and raptor and msLT8 (not shown)) is constitutively activated, resulting in inappropriate
  ribosome biogenesis, protein translation, and cell growth (through downstream effectors
  S6K and S6, as well as 4EBP1 and eIF4E), and downregulation of autophagy. mTORC2
  (composed of mTOR, msLT8, and rictor), which controls cytoskeletal arrangement and
  cell movement through downstream effectors ROCK and Rho, is also activated in the
  absence of TSC1 or TSC2. Various steps in this signaling pathway can be blocked
  by currently available agents, including selective estrogen antagonists, tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, lymphangiogenesis inhibitors, farnesyl
  transferase inhibitors, statins, mTOR inhibitors, metalloproteinase inhibitors,
  and Rho inhibitors.
