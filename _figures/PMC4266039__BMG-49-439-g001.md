caption: Overview of structural diversity in saponin aglycones. The saponin biosynthesis
  pathway begins with acetyl-CoA, which via the mevalonate pathway is converted to
  the linear 30-carbon precursor squalene (yellow). Squalene is oxidized to 2,3-oxidosqualene,
  which is cyclized to the cycloartane aglycone, the dedicated precursor for sterol
  biosynthesis in plants (green). Cholesterol is the dedicated precursor for the synthesis
  of steroidal saponins (violet) and steroidal glycoalkaloids (blue). The triterpenoid
  saponins (orange) are synthesized from 2,3-oxidosqualene that is cyclized to specialized
  triterpene aglycones. Enzyme and pathway names are italicized. Dashed arrows imply
  multiple steps in the pathway.
