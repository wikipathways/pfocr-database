caption: The effect of PCSK9 on atherosclerotic progression.,, Covered by inflammatory
  conditions, oxLDL and ROS at the plaque site, response cells (ECs, SMCs, and MAs)
  synthesize PCSK9, elevating SR (LOX-1, SRA, CD36) expression for more oxLDL intake,
  lowering ABCA1 and ABCG1 with decrease cholesterol outflow. Under this modulation,
  lipid-laden cells emerge as foam cells. Concomitantly, PCSK9 upregulates adhesion
  molecules VCAM-1 expression (more monocytes trafficking), and provokes macrophages
  to liberate inflammatory molecules (TNFα and IL-1β) based on TLR4/NF-κB pathway
  activation.
