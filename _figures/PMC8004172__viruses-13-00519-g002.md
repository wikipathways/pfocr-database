caption: Molecular components of the host contributing to the modulation of the immune
  response during human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection. (A) Zooming into an airway
  epithelial cell (AEC), the different mechanisms responsible for modulating the antiviral
  response against hMPV can be found. The protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) exacerbates
  the inflammatory response. The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins
  prevent the entry of the virus into the cell while also promoting the secretion
  of type I IFN. Additionally, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 promotes the secretion of
  proinflammatory cytokines. (B) Zooming into a cell from the innate immune response,
  such as a dendritic cell (DC), several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and
  modulatory molecules can be found. TLR7 and TLR3 are expressed inside these DCs
  (within the endosomes), and these receptors recognize ssRNA and dsRNA, respectively.
  TLR7 induces the secretion of type I IFN (IFN-α and IFN-β) and NF-κB, while TLR3
  promotes the expression of IFN-β and NF-κB. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)
  and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) can be found in the cytosol,
  which induce the secretion of IFN-α and IFN-β upon recognition of dsRNA. (C) Zooming
  into a cell from the adaptive immune response, such as a T lymphocyte, the different
  receptors and modulatory mechanisms associated with T cell activation can be found.
  An impaired T-lymphocyte activation has been described when these cells are cocultured
  with hMPV-infected DCs. The inhibitory receptors programmed death 1 (PD-1), LAG3,
  and 2B4 will induce an anergic state in these T lymphocytes. T-cell immunoglobulin
  and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM3) impairs the activation of the T helper 1 (Th1)
  signaling pathway, a response that is especially suited to fighting viral infections.
