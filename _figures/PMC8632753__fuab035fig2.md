caption: Viral induction of macrophage signaling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 infection of
  lung epithelial cells leads to induction of expression of CCL2 and CCL7 chemokines,
  which in turn, affect the release of a cascade of pro-inflammatory factors that
  include, but are not limited to, alveolar macrophage TNF-α and IL-6. This occurs
  in parallel with neutrophil chemoattractants, CXCL1 and CXCL2. CCL2 and CCL7 significantly
  increases the infiltration of leukocytes (macrophages and lymphocytes) with neutrophil
  accumulation. This leads to activation of macrophages and facilitates cell entry
  into alveoli through a leaky endothelium. In tandem, type I IFN responses are operative
  from alveolar epithelial cells leading to activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. This
  process increases transcription and translation of interferon-stimulated genes and
  additional inflammatory agents. NLRP3 inflammasome, formed due to infection, converts
  Pro IL-1β and Pro IL18 into IL-1β and IL-18, respectively, which work in autocrine
  fashion in both lymphocytes and macrophages. The cytokine GM-CSF further engages
  the JAK-STAT pathway serving to amplify the release of inflammatory molecules through
  the GMC receptor, and also by causing lymphocyte release of IFN-γ, TNF-α from activated
  NK cells and T cells. Phagocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 and oxidative stress causes signaling
  by TLR2, TLR4 to further drive synthesis of inflammatory molecules via NF-κB mediated
  protein kinase B signaling. Antibody bound SARS-CoV-2 also adds to this cascade
  by binding to Fc receptor binding and ITAM and spleen tyrosine kinase-based signaling
  (figure originally made in house by authors).
