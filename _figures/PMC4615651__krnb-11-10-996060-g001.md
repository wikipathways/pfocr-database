caption: The B. mori sex is determined by the piRNA pathway. (A) Models of ping-pong
  amplification cycles of piRNAs in B. mori embryos. The left panel shows a ping-pong
  loop involving Fem and Masc piRNAs, which controls the sex determination pathway.
  The right panel shows a canonical ping-pong cycle, resulting in transposon silencing.
  (B) Zygotic amplification of repeat RNA- and protein-coding mRNA-derived piRNAs
  by maternally transmitted antisense piRNAs. Density plots of Fem-, Masc-, and Pao-derived
  piRNAs are shown at 0, 6, 12, and 24 hours post-oviposition (hpo), respectively.
  Pao was used as a representative transposable element. (C) Two different roles of
  the piRNA pathway in B. mori embryogenesis. In B. mori embryos, the piRNA system
  plays critical roles not only in immune defense against active transposable elements
  but also in the sex determination pathway. Full-length sense transposons, which
  are piRNA precursors, are transcribed frequently from the W chromosome. They are
  silenced by Siwi, which is complexed with anti-sense piRNAs derived from truncated
  transposable elements located on each chromosome. In the sex determination pathway,
  Fem RNAs are transcribed from the sex-determination regions and are cleaved by the
  maternally transmitted Masc piRNA-BmAgo3 complex. The Fem piRNA-Siwi complex cleaves
  Masc mRNA, resulting in the accumulation of Masc piRNA and feminization.
