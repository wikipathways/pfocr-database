caption: Control of the FA pathway by SUMO and SUMO-like modifications. (A) Regulated
  release of the FAAP20 subunit from FANCA is required for SUMOylation of FANCA via
  the E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9. Removal of FAAP20 inhibits the recruitment of the
  downstream TLS polymerase REV1 during ICL repair, resulting in decreased TLS-mediated
  mutagenesis. SUMOylation of FANCA subsequently triggers RNF4-mediated polyubiquitylation
  and proteasome-mediated degradation. (B) The ID complex is targeted for SUMOylation
  in a manner dependent on the activities of the ATR kinase, the FA core complex,
  and the SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1/PIAS4. Alternatively, SUMOylation can be removed by
  the SUMO protease SENP6. SUMOylation of the ID complex allows for recognition by
  RNF4, leading to ID complex polyubiquitylation and removal from damage sites via
  the DVC1-p97 segregase complex. (C) The SLX4 complex acts as a SUMO E3 ligase by
  triggering its own SUMOylation in addition to that of the DNA repair/recombination
  endonuclease XPF. This SLX4-dependent SUMOylation is dependent on the E2 Ubc9, as
  well as its own SIMs and BTB domains, and is important to prevent mitotic catastrophe
  following CFS expression. (D) The SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and PIAS4 promote DSB repair
  by localizing to damage sites and SUMOylating multiple target proteins, including
  BRCA1 and 53BP1. This SUMOylation is required for proper ubiquitin-adduct formation
  mediated by RNF8, RNF168, and BRCA1 to initiate a DNA damage response (DDR). (E)
  The SUMO-like domain SLD2 of UAF1 directs USP1-UAF1 targeting to its substrates
  via SIMs located within FANCI and the PCNA-interacting protein hELG1. These SLD-SIM
  interactions regulate deubiquitylation of FANCD2 and PCNA-Ub substrates, respectively,
  to coordinate HR and TLS activities during FA DNA repair.
