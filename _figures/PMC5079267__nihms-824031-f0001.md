caption: 'GRK isoforms regulating the signaling of the dopamine receptors in the striatum.
  (A) Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) express D1, D2, and D3 dopamine receptors.
  The D1 receptor is selectively expressed by the direct pathway neurons, whereas
  the D2 receptor is found in the indirect pathway neurons. The D3 receptor co-expresses
  with the D1 receptor in the direct pathway neurons, at least, in the rodent (in
  the human, the D3 receptor expression is much higher and it extensively co-localizes
  with the D2 receptor). Cholinergic interneurons express the D2 and D5 receptors.
  MSN express four GRK isoforms, 2, 3, 4, and 5, as do cholinergic interneurons. The
  latter are enriched with GRKs 2 and 3, as compared to MSN, whereas the levels of
  GRKs 5 and 6 do not differ between MSN and interneurons. (B) Schematic representation
  of the homologous desensitization mechanism. Liganded receptor is phosphorylated
  by a GRK followed by arrestin biding. Arrestin binding precludes further G protein
  activation and initiates receptor internalization via coated pits by virtue of arrestin
  interaction with clathrin and AP-2 (adapter protein-2), main components of the coated
  pit. Following a sorting process, internalized receptor is recycled back to the
  plasma membrane or sent to lysosomes to be degraded. Arrestin binding to the receptor
  also promotes the formation of the multi-protein signaling complexes where arrestin
  acts as a scaffold capable of activating multiple signaling pathways. Here the mitogen
  activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is shown as an example. Arrestin binds the
  upstream MAPK kinase (MAP3 K), MAPK kinase (MAP2 K) and MAPK promoting their sequential
  activation due to proximity. (C) The GRK isoforms are classified into three subfamilies:
  GRK2, GRK4 and visual. The visual subfamily comprising GRKs1 and 7 is largely restricted
  to the retinal photoreceptors. GRKs are multi-domain proteins with unusual domain
  structure: their kinase domain (KD) is inserted inside the RGS homology domain (RH),
  so that the last two helices of RH (RHc) are positioned after KD. GRKs 2 and 3 possess
  pleckstrin homology domain (PH) that other isoforms lack.'
