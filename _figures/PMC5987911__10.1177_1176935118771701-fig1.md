caption: Logical regulatory network graphs for a mammalian cell cycle network (PN1)
  and a melanoma-related pathway network (PN2), modified from  and 1 in Qian and Dougherty,
  respectively. An arrow represents activation regulation, whereas an arrow ending
  with a bar represents inhibition. A different steady-state distribution resulted
  from P27 stuck-at-0 change (shaded node in PN1) or regulatory change (dashed arrow
  in PN2). PN1 indicates Pathway Network 1; PN2, Pathway Network 2.
