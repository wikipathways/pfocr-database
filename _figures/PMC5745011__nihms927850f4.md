caption: Pericytes (left, pink) – Tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β) secreted by endothelial
  cells and pericytes binds to TGF-β receptor 2 (TGFβR2) that phosphorylates activin-like
  kinase 5 (Alk5) (inhibited by Smad7) activating the downstream Smad signaling cascade.
  Activated Smad2/3 inhibits pericyte proliferation and migration. Recruitment of
  Smad4 to Smad2/3 complex transcriptionally promotes pericyte differentiation, expression
  of contractile/extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and pericyte attachment. TGF-β
  also inhibits nitric oxide (NO) generation promoting survival. Activated Notch3
  receptor cleaves its Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which promotes survival.
  Notch-NICD pathway works cooperatively with TGF-β/TGFβR2-Smad-4 pathway to stimulate
  Rbpj-mediated expression of N-cadherin that increases blood-brain barrier (BBB)
  stability. Endothelial cells (right, orange) – VEGF-A/VEGFR2 autocrine/paracrine
  pathway promotes survival via increased expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Survivin,
  and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). Vitronectin secreted by pericytes
  acts on integrin aV on endothelial cells resulting in NFκB-mediated transcriptional
  expression of VEGF-A and intracrine-mediated VEGF-A/VEGFR2-dependent Bcl-w expression
  promoting survival. Pericyte-derived Ang1 acts on endothelial Tie2 receptor, and
  endothelial-secreted Ang2 blocks Ang1 binding to Tie2, acting as a Tie2 antagonist.
  Ang1/Tie2 activates phosphatidyl inositol 3-phosphate (PI3K)/Akt pathway resulting
  in inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3P), an inhibitor of β-catenin;
  this leads to β-catenin nuclear translocation resulting in activation of TCF/LEF
  transcription factors that control expression of several proteins promoting BBB
  stability (shown in a box). Notch1/4 contributes to β-catenin-mediated BBB stability
  via the Notch-regulated ankyrin repeat protein (Nrarp), which increases β-catenin
  nuclear signaling by inhibiting LEF1 degradation and decreases Notch signaling via
  NICD destabilization. Additionally, Notch1/4-NICD pathway stimulates PDGF-BB expression
  and RBP-Jκ-mediated expression of N-cadherin contributing to BBB stability. As in
  pericytes, TGF-β/TGFβR2 pathway in endothelium similarly activates i) Alk5-Smad2/3/4
  complex to transcriptionally promote differentiation, inhibit proliferation, and
  induce RBP-Jκ-mediated expression of N-cadherin, ii) Alk1-Smad1/5/8 to promote proliferation,
  and iii) Alk1-PI3K/Akt pathway to promote survival and BBB stability. The major
  facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 2a (MFSD2A) facilitates luminal-to-abluminal
  transport of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an essential omega-3 fatty acid, and controls
  formation of the BBB; its expression depends on the presence of pericytes.
