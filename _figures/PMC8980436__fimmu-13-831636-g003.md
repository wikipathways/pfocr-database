caption: Cell cycle genes and the weaknesses associated with the initiation of glioma.
  Cell type transition and cancer cell initiation are a succession of events within
  the cell-mediated by external and internal factors. The overexpression of GDNF in
  normal cells contributes to the activation of the STAT3 gene and cyclin-dependent
  kinase (Cdks) binding with cyclin and their respective phosphorylation. The binding
  of Cdks-cyclin promotes the activation and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein
  (Rb) that stimulates the initiation of the cell cycle and cell division via DNA
  transcription. In inflammation, the extracellular overexpression of growth factors
  activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which controls glycolysis by antagonizing GSK3β
  activity. GSK3β activation promotes glycogen synthesis to promote the accumulation
  of glycogen that can be used later to produce energy for cell survival and division.
  GSK3β inhibition causes glycolysis to promote glioma initiation and epigenetic modification.
  In cancer, overexpression of GDNF or the activation of GDNF family ligands also
  promotes Ras/Raf signaling pathways leading to ERK1/2 activation and high expression.
  ERK1/2 translocate in the cell nucleus and regulate SOX1 family members’ overexpression.
  Activation of the metabolism pathway (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) regulates oncogene expression
  via gene methylation and chromatin acetylation (H3K4 and H3K9).
