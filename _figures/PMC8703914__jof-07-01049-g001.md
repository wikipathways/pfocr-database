caption: Overview of the Cell Wall Integrity Pathway. The CWI transmits signals through
  five transmembrane proteins, Wsc1p, Wsc2, Wsc3, Mid2p and Mtl1p. These proteins
  are anchored in the plasma membrane (PM) and extend into the cell wall. The transmembrane
  proteins signal through Rom2p to activate Rho1p. Rho1p is responsible for the activation
  of the 1,3-β-glucan synthase (GS), a formin (Bni1p), Sec3p, and Pkc1p. Rho1p is
  acted upon by four Rho-GAPs, Sac7p, Bag7, Lrg1, and Bem2p. The CWI pathway is a
  MAP kinase cascade that culminates in the phosphorylation of Mpk1p, which activates
  transcription factors Rlm1p and SBF (Swi4p/Swi6p) to activate genes involved in
  cell cycle regulation and cell wall biogenesis. (Adapted from Levin, 2005 and Levin,
  2011).
