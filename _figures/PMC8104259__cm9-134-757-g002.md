caption: 'Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin-9 (Siglec-9) as a regulator
  in neutrophil apoptotic and autophagic-like cell death. The engagement of Siglec-9
  by its ligands can recruit tyrosine phosphatase Src homology-2 domain-containing
  proteins tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) to its intracellular immune receptor tyrosine-based
  inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). Phosphorylation of SHP-1 is followed by reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) generation in the absence of proinflammatory cytokines, such as granulocyte
  macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), leading to neutrophil apoptosis in
  a caspase-dependent fashion. In compensatory pathway, phosphoinositide 3 kinase
  (PI3K), the anti-apoptotic signal, might be down-regulated by SHP-1 phosphorylation.
  In the presence of GM-CSF, neutrophils may undergo a caspase-independent cell death,
  which is also designated as an autophagic-like cell death. CASP: cysteine-aspartic
  proteases.'
