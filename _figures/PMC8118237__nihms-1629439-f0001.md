caption: 'Intracellular trafficking: Plasma membrane proteins involved in iron uptake
  are heme transporters FLVCR2 and HRG1; lipocalin 2 receptor LCN2R (also called 24p3R),
  which binds a lipocalin 2-siderophore-iron complex; DMT1 (which is also involved
  in endosomal iron efflux), which transports Fe2+; CD44, which binds an iron-hyaluronate
  complex; and TFR1, which binds diferric transferrin. Iron taken up by these pathways
  is delivered to a pool of redox-active iron termed the labile iron pool to supply
  iron to iron-containing proteins. The chaperone PCBP1 delivers iron to ferritin
  and LOX15, among other targets. Ferritin stores excess iron in a non-toxic bioavailable
  form. Iron in ferritin can also be redistributed following binding to NCOA4 and
  lysosomal degradation (ferritinophagy), or ferritin-bound iron can be effluxed from
  the cell via a multivesicular body (MVB)/exosome pathway. The major route of iron
  efflux is ferroportin (FPN), which is degraded by the secreted peptide hepcidin.
  Iron participates in producing the oxidized membrane lipids that mediate ferroptotic
  cell death. Ferroptosis inducers disable endogenous pathways that reduce oxidized
  lipids, including the peroxidase GPX4 and the cystine/glutamate antiporter SLC7A11.
  Intercellular trafficking: Pro-tumorigenic effects are mediated by tumor-associated
  macrophages, which provide iron to tumor cells, as well as by tumor-associated fibroblasts
  (TAFs). TAFs express the iron-dependent enzyme lysyl hydroxylase 2 (LH2) an enzyme
  that enhances matrix stiffness; TAFs also secrete IL6, which upregulates hepcidin,
  degrades ferroportin, and limits iron efflux from tumor cells. Anti-tumorigenic
  effects are exerted by PD-L1-stimulated CD8+ T cells, which promote ferroptosis
  by secreting interferon gamma and inhibiting SLC7A11. Excess exogenous iron resulting
  from hemolysis or provided by iron-containing nanoparticles can trigger a shift
  of M2-type tumor associated macrophages to a tumoricidal M1 phenotype. Note that
  this figure consolidates findings from multiple different tumor types; not all pathways
  are operant in all cancers.'
