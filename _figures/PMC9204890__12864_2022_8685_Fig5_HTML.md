caption: The protein-protein interaction network of DEAS genes in brown trout during
  PKD. Each node represents an individual protein and the interconnecting lines display
  the predicted functional interaction between the connected protein nodes. The numbers
  of lines are directly proportional to the strength of prediction for the functional
  association between proteins. Various sources of evidence were used to predict the
  association between proteins such as curated databases (light blue), experimentally
  determined (pink), gene neighbourhood (green), gene fusion (red), gene co-occurrence
  (dark blue), textmining (yellow) and co-expression (black). Proteins associated
  with local network clusters of Cation transporting ATPase, C-terminus, and Sodium
  / potassium ATPase beta chain (CL:20005), and mixed inclusion of Ion homeostasis,
  and EF-hand domain (CL:19893) are displayed in red and blue nodes respectively.
  Furthermore, proteins associated with Salmonella infection pathway (dre05132) is
  illustrated as a green node
