caption: Main therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs. These therapeutic ways are aimed
  at either activating the anti-tumoral activity, or inhibiting the recruitment, survival
  and protumoral functions of macrophages. The process of macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent
  cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) involves recognition of the therapeutic antibodies
  by Fc receptors (FcRs) on TAMs. The ‘don’t eat me’ signal including SIRPα-CD47 pathway
  and CD24-Siglec 10 pathway. The antibodies against SIRPα-CD47 pathway and CD24-Siglec
  10 pathway can activate macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis
  (ADCP). Here, the main therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs are generally summarized
  including the ‘don’t eat me’ signal pathways, repolarization, reducing and decreasing
  the recruitment and survival, and immune-checkpoints blockades with antibodies.
