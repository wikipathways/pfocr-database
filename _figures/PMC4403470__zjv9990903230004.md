caption: Proposed model of p35 upregulation in response to HSV-1 infection. HSV-1
  infection of neurons stimulates the ERK pathway, activates at least one component
  of the DDR, and triggers the oxidative stress response. These stimuli increase Egr-1
  expression, leading to the induction of p35. Elevated p35 protein levels result
  in the cytoplasmic localization of CDK-5 and enhance its kinase activity, which
  promotes neuronal survival of the infected neuron.
