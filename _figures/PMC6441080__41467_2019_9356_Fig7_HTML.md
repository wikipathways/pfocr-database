  aureus. The CapA1B1 tyrosine complex (blue) positively controls multiple enzymatic
  checkpoints to orchestrate CP biosynthesis and precursor consumption during late
  exponential growth phase (white box). By catalyzing tyrosine phosphorylation (blue
  ´P´) of biosynthetic enzymes CapE, CapO and CapM, CapA1B1 positively controls the
  synthesis of both soluble and lipid-linked CP precursors. The membrane-anchored
  component CapA1 possesses a dual function; CapA1 recognizes lipid-bound CP building
  blocks and catalyzes the cleavage of the pyrophosphate linkage, releasing the essential
  isoprenoid lipid carrier C55P. CP transfer is catalyzed by LcpC (red), which uses
  the ultimate peptidoglycan (PG) precursor lipid IIPG as an acceptor substrate. During
  exponential growth phase (grey shading), the insertion of new PG material (LIIPG)
  into the cell wall network is increased; UDP-GlcNAc and C55P are preferably channeled
  into PG and WTA biosynthesis, while CP production is low. The Ser/Thr kinase PknB
  (green) contributes to the control of cell wall biosynthesis and cell division.
  Control of CP formation during ongoing PG synthesis is achieved by PknB via Ser/Thr
  phosphorylation (green ´P´). PknB negatively controls the activity of the priming
  glycosyltransferase CapM to regulate the initial C55P-consuming reaction within
  the CP biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, PknB cross-talks with the CapAB complex,
  thus allowing control of the CP biosynthetic machinery on multiple levels, in response
  to the status of PG biosynthesis. The model highlights central biosynthetic precursors
  as important signal molecules situated at the interface of different pathways, integrated
  in feedback loops to control biosyntheses and the flux of shared precursors
