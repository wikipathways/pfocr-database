caption: Neurochemical signaling pathway organizing male rat sexual behavior and neuroanatomical
  correlates. Masculinization of male rat sexual behavior is initiated perinatally
  when testosterone is converted to estradiol by aromatase in the diencephalon. Estradiol
  binds to estrogen receptor-α, which increases COX-1 and COX-2 levels twofold in
  the POA. A subsequent sevenfold increase in PGE2 activates EP2 and EP4 receptors
  and recruits PKA signaling. PKA activity may induce AMPA/kainate and metabotropic
  glutamate receptor signaling, which then concurrently initiates dendritic spine
  formation in the POA. A higher density of excitatory dendritic spines synapses on
  POA neurons is highly correlated with expression of adult male sexual behavior in
  individual animals ().
