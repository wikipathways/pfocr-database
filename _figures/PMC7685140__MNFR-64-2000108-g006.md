caption: Proposed molecular mechanisms of BE‐induced reduction of vesicle release.
  Previous results demonstrated that anthocyanins (AC) enter ECs via bilitranslocases
  (1) and inhibit PI3K activation (2). This prevents Akt phosphorylation and reduces
  P2X7 transcription (3) that stands in line with our results. According to the literature,
  P2X7signaling pathway leads to Akt phosphorylation and further EV release (4). Moreover,
  our data shows that P2X7 cascade also augments transcription of vesiculation‐related
  genes Rab27b and Rab27a that are inhibited by BE treatment (5), possibly due to
  a decrease in P2X7 expression. We propose that P2X7‐evoked increase in Rab27b and
  Rab27a transcription reflects increased cellular demands after P2X7‐stimulated vesiculation.
