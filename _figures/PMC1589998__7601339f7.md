caption: Impact of excess eIF5 or eIF2Bɛ on MFC and eIF2/eIF2B complex assembly. Numbers
  in circles represent eIFs. (A, B) A standard initiation cycle is presented focusing
  on eIF2–factor interactions. Factors are numbered in black and connected in a currently
  accepted sequence with black arrows, but with the addition of an eIF2·GDP/eIF5 complex
  that is shown here as forming upon eIF release from initiating ribosomes. (A) Additional
  competing complexes, identified in this study, form in the presence of excess eIF5
  (gray circles labeled 5) and are shown in gray outlined square boxes with connecting
  gray arrows to indicate possible connection routes with the main pathway. However,
  TC+5 complex may transiently form as a natural MFC intermediate (). Likewise, it
  is possible that the eIF2B/eIF2/eIF5 complex is a transient intermediate before
  eIF5 displacement from the eIF2/eIF5 complex (see Discussion). (B) By analogy with
  hc eIF5, proposed complexes formed by excess eIF2Bɛ (gray diamonds labeled ɛ) are
  shown in gray outlined boxes connected with gray arrows to the main pathway (black
  factors and arrows).
