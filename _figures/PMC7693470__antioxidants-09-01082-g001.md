caption: 'Schematic simplified representation of thyroid hormone synthesis. Iodide
  (I−) enters thyroid follicular cells by active transport via the sodium (Na+)-iodide
  symporter (NIS), and is then exported via other channels into the follicular lumen
  (the colloid area), where it is oxidized to iodine (I) and used in the iodination
  of thyroglobulin (Tg). Coupling between di- and/or mono-iodinated tyrosines of Tg
  produces the thyroid hormones T4 and T3, attached to the Tg backbone. Tg is then
  endocytosed into the thyroid follicular cells, where it is degraded inside lysosomes,
  ultimately releasing T4 and T3 into the blood circulation via a monocarboxylate
  transporter (MCT). Steps affected by Keap1/Nrf2 signaling are highlighted in red
  font. They include: (i) a positive effect on the transcription of the gene encoding
  Tg; (ii) a positive effect on the transcription of antioxidant and selenoprotein
  genes such as Nqo1 (NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1), Gpx2 (glutathione peroxidase
  2), and Txnrd1 (thioredoxin reductase 1); (iii) a negative effect on Tg iodination;
  (iv) a positive effect on Tg proteolysis.'
