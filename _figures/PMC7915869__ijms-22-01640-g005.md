caption: 'Crosstalk between the immune and dopaminergic systems. A pro-inflammatory
  state is triggered by cytokines produced by microglia or entering the central nervous
  system (CNS) from the peripheral circulation (a). Cytokine-actions with increased
  oxidative stress through formation of ROS may reduce part of the BH4 pool, resulting
  in less availability of BH4 for dopamine synthesis (b). BH4 availability is further
  reduced when cytokines activate NOS, demanding BH4 as co-factor in production of
  NO, further adding to oxidative stress (c). To the right in the figure, the “neurotoxic”
  and cytokine-induced branch of kynurenine pathway is presented, which occurs in
  microglia (d). The KP-metabolite quinolinic acid has neurotoxic properties and adds
  to oxidative stress. Lastly, available dopamine in pre-synaptic clefts is further
  reduced as cytokines both decrease VMAT2’s packaging of dopamine into vesicles for
  release, and increase DAT expression and function for re-uptake (e) []. Abbreviations:
  nitric oxide synthase (NOS), nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), tetrahydrobiopterin
  (BH4), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2),
  dopamine transporter (DAT).'
