caption: 'The molecular mechanisms of CASC11 in different human cancers. (A) Ovarian
  squamous cell carcinoma: CASC11 may mediate cisplatin resistance in OSCC cells.
  (B) Esophageal adenocarcinoma: CASC11 may lead to the poor prognosis of ECa by regulating
  KLF6. (C) Prostate cancer: SNPs of CASC11 are associated with the susceptibility
  to PC. (D) Small cell lung cancer: Activation of TGF-β1 is mediated by CASC11 and
  induces the EMT process, which in turn promotes tumor metastasis and proliferation.
  (E) Cervical carcinoma: the activity change of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway
  is correlated to the mechanism by which CASC11 promotes CC progression. (F) gastric
  cancer: LINC01116 and CASC11 coordinatively promote GC metastasis and invasion.
  (G) Hepatocellular carcinoma: CASC11 not only promotes the proliferation of HCC
  cells after carboplatin treatment, but also interacts with miR-21 to improve the
  survival rate of HCC cells. (H) Osteosarcoma: CASC11 binds to Snail mRNA, inhibiting
  its degradation, promoting OS metastasis and EMT transformation. KLF6: Zinc finger
  protein transcription; SNPs: Single nucleotide polymorphisms; TGF-β1: Transforming
  growth factor-β.'
