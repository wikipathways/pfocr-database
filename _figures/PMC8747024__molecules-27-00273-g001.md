caption: The kynurenine pathway. The kynurenine pathway is the essential metabolic
  pathway for the catabolism of tryptophan. There have been significant advances in
  researching the roles this pathway plays in neurodegenerative diseases. It is believed
  that inhibiting KMO would lead to a decrease production of toxic products downstream
  in this pathway, which would avoid the buildup of toxic metabolites that lead to
  certain disease. Kynurenine pathway metabolites—toxic metabolites in red, neuroprotective
  metabolites in green.
