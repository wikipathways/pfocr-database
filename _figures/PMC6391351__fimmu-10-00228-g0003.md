caption: PU.1 and Notch collectively determine T vs. myeloid lineage fates. (A) Notch
  signaling within the thymus normally constrains PU.1 effects to support early pro-T
  cell development while blocking alternative fates that PU.1 would otherwise promote.
  Notch signaling itself does not repress PU.1 expression; however, other transcription
  factors induced by Notch signaling eventually silence expression of Spi1 during
  the DN2b stage. (B) Separation of the effects of PU.1 within the T-cell pathway
  from effects of PU.1 to promote lineage deviation, in PU.1 gain of function experiments.
  A fraction of cells expressing high levels of PU.1 shift to a myeloid-like state
  that can be phenotypically distinguished from cells remaining within the T-cell
  state. This distinction is necessary to relate gain-of-function effects of PU.1
  in pro-T cells to effects of loss of endogenous PU.1 in perturbation experiments.
  Lineage deviation is associated with a broad loss of Notch signal response in the
  cells, suggesting that the constraint mechanism shown in A has been overwhelmed
  in these cells. Biochemical mechanisms of these effects remain to be fully defined.
