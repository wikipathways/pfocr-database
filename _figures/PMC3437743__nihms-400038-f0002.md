caption: 'Major pathways for maintaining intracellular GSH balance include de novo
  synthesis, regeneration from GSSG, and extracellular GSH uptake. GSH synthesis takes
  place only in the cytosolic compartments in two ATP-dependent reactions catalyzed
  by γ-glutamate-cysteine ligase and glutathione synthase. Additionally, epithelial
  cells can import intact GSH from the extracellular space via specific plasma membrane
  transporters, such as MRP. Post synthesis, cytosolic GSH is distributed within the
  mitochondria, nucleus, or endoplasmic reticulum, creating distinct and independently
  regulated subcellular redox pools. As an antioxidant, intracellular GSH participates
  in: (a) glutathione-S-transferases-conjugation reactions with electrophiles, (b)
  glutathione peroxidase-catalyzed reduction of hydroperoxides, and (c) glutaredoxins
  and glutathione-S-transferase catalyzed reduction of protein-disulfides. Glutathione
  reductase-catalyzed regeneration of GSH from GSSG occurs at the expense of NADPH,
  generated from glucose metabolism in the pentose phosphate pathway. In transport
  epithelium, extracellular GSH is sequentially hydrolyzed by γ-glutamyl transferase
  and dipeptidase to yield glutamate, cysteine and glycine that are recycled for intracellular
  GSH synthesis. Known as the γ-glutamyl cycle, this GSH hydrolysis-resynthesis cycle
  reportedly constitutes a major system for intracellular GSH homeostasis in transport
  epithelial cells. The degradation of GSH to its constituent amino acids, glutamate,
  cysteine and glycine occurs only extracellularly in two sequential steps catalyzed
  by γ-glutamyl transferase and dipeptidase (DP). γ-GT, γ-glutamyl transferase; DP,
