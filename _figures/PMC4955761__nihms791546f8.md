caption: As described in the text, the curent data reveal that intestinal epithelial
  TLR4 activation leads to the development of NEC, and induces the release of high
  mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) from the intestinal epithelium, which then activates
  pulmonary epithelial TLR4. This leads to the induction of the neutrophil recruiting
  C-X-C motif chemokine-5 (CXCL5) and the influx of pro-inflammatory neutrophils to
  the lung, which causes the severe lung injury observed in patients and mice with
  NEC.
