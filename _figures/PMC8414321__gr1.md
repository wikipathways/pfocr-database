caption: The γ-glutamyl cycle shown highlights the relevant risk factors and their
  contribution to a pathological state of 5-oxoprolinaemia. With cysteine, glycine
  and glutathione depletion, the alternative pathway is favoured leading to the breakdown
  of γ-glutamyl cysteine into γ-glutamyl amino acid and a thus an accumulation of
  5-oxoproline. This is further confounded by inhibition of its breakdown by 5-oxoprolinase
  and renal impairment. Ultimately, this results in the pyroglutamic acidosis as discussed
  in this case and the pathophysiology that occurs.
