  the same time, it can inhibit the immune monitoring and make the tumor cells escape.
  Tumor treatment could result in the necrosis of tumor cells. Necrosis of the tumor
  cells chemotactic inflammatory cell aggregation, suppression of immunity; At the

  transformation promote each other and form a vicious cycle, which is conducive to
  distant metastasis of tumors. Inflammatory factors are closely related to the production
  of tumor cachexia.'
