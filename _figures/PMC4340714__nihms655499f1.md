caption: (A) In Drosophila, Ex, Mer and Kibra upon activation by Fat, activate Hpo-Sav
  complex. Activated Hpo-Sav complex phosphorylates and activates Wts-Mts complex.
  Activated Wt-Mts phosphorylates Yki, leading to its cytoplasmic retention and inactivation.
  In the absence of Hpo signaling, Yki binds transcription factor Sd and promotes
  cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. (B) In mammals, Merlin interaction
  with Lats leads to recruitment of Lats to the plasma membrane. At the plasma membrane
  Lats is phosphorylated and activated by Mst. Activated Lats phosphorylates Yap leading
  to its inactivation and cytoplasmic retention. Pointed arrowheads indicate activation
  and blunted ends indicate inhibition. Solid lines indicate direct interaction while
  dashed lines indicate unknown mechanism.
