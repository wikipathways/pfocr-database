caption: Models for RHAMM-regulated motogenic signaling in keratinocytes and temporal-spatial
  coordination of keratinocyte and fibroblast migration in excisional wounds. A, signaling
  model for regulation of keratinocyte migration by RHAMM. RHAMM/CD44 interactions
  block EGFR-regulated ERK1/2 activity and downstream expression of the motogenic
  target gene, MMP-9. Blocking extracellular RHAMM function releases the pathway and
  stimulates the expression and release of MMP-9, which promotes CD44 shedding, resulting
  in increased keratinocyte migration. B, RHAMM expression is ubiquitous in wounds
  by 24 h after excisional injury and then decreases over time. Maximal expression
  corresponds to influx of innate immune cells and initiation of fibroblast migration
  to form granulation tissue. As RHAMM protein levels decrease, keratinocyte migration
  is initiated. Aberrant RHAMM expression alters the timing of keratinocyte and fibroblast
  migration resulting in altered rate of wound closure and dysregulated differentiation
  within the wound site.

    RHAMM/CD44 interactions block EGFR-regulated ERK1/2 activity and downstream expression
    of the motogenic target gene, MMP-9. Blocking extracellular RHAMM function releases
    the pathway and stimulates the expression and release of MMP-9, which promotes

    is ubiquitous in wounds by 24 h after excisional injury and then decreases over
    time. Maximal expression corresponds to influx of innate immune cells and initiation
    of fibroblast migration to form granulation tissue. As RHAMM protein levels decrease,
    keratinocyte migration is initiated. Aberrant RHAMM expression alters the timing
    of keratinocyte and fibroblast migration resulting in altered rate of wound closure
    and dysregulated differentiation within the wound site.
