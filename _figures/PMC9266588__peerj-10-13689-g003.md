caption: The purple coloration of enzyme names indicates a significant upregulation
  from the S1 to S3 stage in the synthesis of amino acids, and blue indicates a significant
  downregulation. The log2 transformed values of DEGs based on transcripts per kilobase
  (TPM) value of unigenes of the enzymes are also indicated as changing from blue
  to red (low to high) across the S1, S2, and S3 developmental stages. The log2 transformed
  values of amino acids are indicated as changing from blue to red (low to high) across
  the S1, S2, and S3 developmental stages.
