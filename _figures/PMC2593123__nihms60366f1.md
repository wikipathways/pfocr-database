caption: A simplified schematic of the core left-right signaling pathway in the e8.5
  (6 somite) mouse embryo. The embryo is viewed from the ventral side to highlight
  the ventrally located node. Nodal (blue), a TGFβ family ligand, is expressed around
  the periphery of the mouse node (outlined in black). Leftward fluid flow across
  the node requires the correct placement and rotation of nodal cilia (green), and
  leads to expression of Nodal in the left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). Nodal signaling
  in the left LPM induces the expression of upregulates its own expression in a positive
  feedback loop and also induces expression lefty2 and Pitx2. Lefty2 (red) antagonizes
  the activity of Nodal and limits its range of activity. Nodal made in the left LPM
  also activates the expression of lefty1 (purple) in the left prospective floor plate,
  dorsal to the notochord (black line extending anteriorly toward the midline). Lefty1
  antagonizes Nodal and prevents the spread of left signaling to the right LPM. The
  homeodomain transcription factor Pitx2 (yellow) controls later left-sided morphogenetic
  events. Lack of nodal and Pitx2 expression in the LPM leads to right-sided isomerism
  in the thorax (e.g. right pulmonary isomerism); bilateral expression of nodal and
  Pitx2 in the LPM leads to left pulmonary isomerism.
