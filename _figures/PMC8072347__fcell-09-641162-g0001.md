caption: RANK-NFATc1 signaling in OCL differentiation. (A) Binding of RANKL to RANK
  leads to induction of NF-κB and AP1, which, in turn, results in increased expression
  of NFATc1, a key transcription factor regulating the expression of OCL-specific
  genes. Src-mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway downstream of TRAF6 is also
  required for OCL production, and inhibition of these pathways impairs osteoclastogenesis.
  (B) Sustained induction of NFATc1 leads to expression of OCL-specific proteins.
  The initial induction of NFATc1 mediated by NF-κB and AP1 is sustained through the
  activities of CAMK IV and the phosphatase calcineurin. This permits robust expression
  of NFATc1, which, together with several other transcription factors, upregulates
  the expression of OCL-specific genes (see text). Signaling through FcRγ and DAP12
  ITAM adaptors is required for the sustained induction of NFATc1, specifically through
  activation of PLCγ and subsequent release of calcium from intracellular stores.
  Activation of PLCγ may also need phosphorylation by Btk/Tec–BLNK/SLP76 complex which
  is stimulated downstream of RANK/RANKL and ITAM adaptor signaling.
