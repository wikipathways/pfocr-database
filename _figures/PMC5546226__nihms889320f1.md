caption: 'Core metabolic pathways (grey shaded) use most of the carbon equivalents
  derived from nutrients for the production of energy, to control redox balance and
  to generate biomass. The ‘peripheral’ pathways we describe in this review are also
  intertwined with core metabolism. In this figure we focus our attention on some
  of the documented interactions between ‘peripheral’ and core metabolic pathways.
  The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP, purple shaded) branches off glycolysis, feeds
  ribose-5-phosphate (ribose-5-P) to nucleotide synthesis and represents a source
  of reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH. NADPH is involved in fatty acid and
  cholesterol synthesis, and also enters the 1-carbon (1-C) metabolism to balance
  redox state. The 1-C metabolism (red shaded), together with amino acids and ribose-5-P,
  supports de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. Furthermore, the 1-C metabolism is the
  key source of S-adenosylmethionine required for spermidine and spermine synthesis
  (green shaded). The polyamine pathway also utilizes the amino acids arginine, glutamine
  and ornithine as precursors for polyamine synthesis. The production of hexosamines
  (blue shaded) integrates fructose-6-P, glutamine, nucleotides and acetyl-CoA to
  generate the amino sugar UDP-GlcNAc, involved in the post-transcriptional modification
  of proteins. Finally, acetyl-CoA is used to synthesize cholesterol (orange shaded)
  that together with its intermediates and derivatives coordinates intracellular signaling.ETC:
