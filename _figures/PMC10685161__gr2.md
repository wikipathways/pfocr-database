caption: Potential role of AGR2 as a critical regulator of maintaining intestinal
  barrier function by affecting the intestinal goblet cell differentiation, maturation,
  and secretion of MUC2. (A) Differentiation and maturation of goblet cells. (B) Mucin
  synthesis and secretion by goblet cells. (C) EGF is a key growth factor that binds
  to its receptor (EGFR) at the plasma membrane to regulate goblet cell differentiation.
  AGR2 interacts physically (through a CXXS motif) with EGFR within the ER before
  the receptor can progress to the plasma membrane (a). Physical interaction between
  AGR2 and MUC2 is a critical step in mucin synthesis and secretion. AGR2 forms disulfide
  bonds with the N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich sections of MUC2, thereby contributing
  to mucin synthesis (b). Under ER stress, such as ETEC infection, the UPR-AGR2 signaling
  pathway is affected, which in turn influences the interaction of AGR2 with EGFR
  and MUC2. AGR2 = anterior gradient 2; ATOH1 = atonal homolog 1; CBCs = crypt-based
  columnar cells; GFI1 = growth factor independent 1; SPDEF = sterile alpha motif-pointed
  domain ETS factor; UPR = unfolded protein response.
