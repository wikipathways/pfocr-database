caption: A simplified model of the relationship between Wnt signaling and AD pathology.
  Chronic noise exposure and aging could induce activation of Dkk-1, a Wnt pathway
  inhibitor. In the one hand, in absence of Wnt ligands, Dvl protein expression decreased
  and both β-catenin and tau are phosphorylated by GSK-3β, in the other hand, without
  the inhibition of Wnt, the expression of Aβ significantly increased, which further
  exacerbates the downregulation of wnt. All of this indicates that the AD-like neuropathology
  observed in mice of accelerated aging after chronic noise is likely to be the result
  of dysregulation of Wnt signaling. Dkk-1, Dickkopf-related protein 1; Dvl, disheveled;
  p, phosphorylation.
