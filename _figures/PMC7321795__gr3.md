  with miR-214. Formation of the circNfix/Ybx1/Nedd4l complex promotes Ybx1 degradation
  through the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. (B) The combination of ACR and Dnmt3B
  blocks Dnmt3B-dependent methylation of Pink1, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation
  of FAM65B and reduced autophagy. (C) By acting as a miR-652-3p sponge, MFACR increases
  mitochondrial fission and cardiomyocyte apoptosis by elevating expression of MTP18,
  which is a downstream target of miR-652-3p.
