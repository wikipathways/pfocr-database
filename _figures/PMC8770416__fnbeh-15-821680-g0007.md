caption: Examples in which the same stimulus can elicit different behavioral responses
  through competing pathways that are gated by state or context. Black arrows depict
  neural circuits generating behavior; blue arrows depict excitatory modulation whereas
  red arrows depict inhibitory modulation. Dashed lines indicate putative types of
  modulation that have not been experimentally confirmed. For example, it is not known
  whether fast walking switches the behavioral response to carbon dioxide by enhancing
  the pathway promoting approach or suppressing the pathway for avoidance.
