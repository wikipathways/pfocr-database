caption: 'WNT4 regulates at least three distinct intracellular signaling pathways:
  β-catenin, planar cell polarity (PCP)/JNK, and Ca2+/CaMK pathways. In canonical
  WNT pathway, extracellular WNT ligand binds to FZD and LRP5/6 on the cell membrane
  and recruits DVL protein to promote dissociation of the β-catenin destruction complex,
  followed by accumulation of β-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus to interact
  with target downstream signaling molecules and activate intracellular signaling
  cascades. In WNT/PCP/JNK pathway, WNT4 binds to FZD and interacts between DVL and
  Dvl-associated activator of morphogenesis (DAAM) to activate the small GTPases Rac1
  and Ras homolog gene family member A (RHOA). Rac1 activates JNK and phosphorylates
  c-Jun. In WNT/Ca2+pathway, WNT4 ligand binds to FZD2 receptor and G protein subunits
  at the cell membrane and recruits DVL protein to promote PLC, leading to open calcium
  channels for Ca2+ release, resulting in intracellular Ca2+ accumulation. Ca2+ can
  activate the phosphates calcineurin (CaN) and several calcium-dependent kinases,
  including PKC and calmodulin-mediated kinase II (CaMKII). The phosphates calcineurin,
  in turn, activates the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) to regulate downstream
  cascades. The G protein-induced activation of p38 via mitogen-activated protein
  kinase 3/6 (MAPK 3/6) results in phosphorylation of activating transcription factor
  2 (ATF2) on Thr69 and Thr71 to nuclear transcription.'
