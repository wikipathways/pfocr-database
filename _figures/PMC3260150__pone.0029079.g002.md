caption: '(A) Gene ontology analysis of microarray data (P value<0.01): The pie diagram
  shows the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes among SP and
  MP cells. The gene signature was enriched for genes in gene ontology biological
  processes of apoptosis, cell cycle, cell proliferation, transport, signal transduction,
  transcription, translation, protein modification, metabolism and proteolysis. Other
  represents genes involved in defense response, vasculogenesis, blood coagulation,
  visual perception, ontogenesis, cell matrix adhesion, and initiation of primordial
  ovarian follicle growth. (B) Graphical representation of the literature derived
  facts about the biological pathways involved in SP cells. Pathway Studio 6.0 software
  was used to identify the activated pathways in SP cells. Solid symbols representing
  the genes (EGFR, TNFRSF6, BCL2L11, FOXO3A, RUNX1) as down regulated in SP cells,
  the open symbols represents the upregulated genes (EPHB4, EPHB2, PAWR, AKT1) and
  gray symbols are the genes whose expression did not change significantly between
  SP and MP cells. (C) The Notch signaling pathway: The figure shows the schematic
  of Notch signal transduction elements. The overexpressed proteins in SP cells (FPTG,
  ST3GAL6 and ADAM19) are shown in blue color. Post-translational modification of
  precursor Notch-protein includes cleavage by proteases and glycosylations in the
  trans-Golgi. Adherence of Notch extracellular domain (ECN) with Notch intracellular
  domain (ICN) results in mature Notch heterodimers and they are transferred to the
  cell membrane. Receptor interaction with the ligands of the DSL family (Delta, Serrate,
  Lag3) on neighboring cells is modulated by glycosylations of ECN. Successful interaction
  of extracellular ligand regions with EGF-like repeats of ECN lead to the proteolytic
  cleavages of Notch transmembrane domain by two sequential steps by ADAM proteases
  and presenilins with γ–secretase activity. The released Notch intracellular domain
  is translocated to the nuclease where it interacts with CSL1, replacing CSL repressors
  and forming a transcription complex with Mastermind-like factors and transcriptional
  coactivators. This transcriptional complex activates downstream target genes and
  may account for cancer stem cell survival, self-renewal and tumor maintenance in
  ovary.'
