caption: 'Schematic presentation of a single neuron affected by the prion fibrils
  and oligomers. Accumulation of misfolded PrPSc results in the activation of microglia
  and subsequently activating two types of responses: (1) Inflammation, stress and
  death receptors response; This response activates two pathways, one branch activates
  mixed-lineage protein kinase 3 (MLK3) and transforming growth factor activated kinase-1(TAK1),
  MLK3 and TAK1 activates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3, 6 (MKK3, 6) MKK3,
  6 activates the p38 branch of MAPK pathways, while the other branch of Inflammation,
  stress and death receptors response activates GTP binding protein (RAC), RAC activates
  P21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-Activated Kinase 1 and 2 (PAK1, 2), PAK1, 2 activates mitogen
  activated protein kinase 1 and 4, MLK3 and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1
  (ASK1), MEK1/4, MLK3 and ASK1 activates MKK4/7 to ultimately activate JNK branch
  of MAPK pathway. (2) Mitogens synaptic activity response; this branch activates
  small GTP binding proteins (Ras), Ras activates serine/theronine protein kinase
  (Raf A, B and C), Raf-A, B and C activates MEK1/2, which activates third branch
  of MAPK pathway ERK1/2.'
