caption: 'Summary of the results in this study. GOT: Glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase;
  GPT: Glutamate-pyruvate transaminase; p-AMPK: phosphor-AMP-activated protein kinase;
  PPARγ: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; SREBP-1c: Sterol regulatory
  element-binding protein-1c. Fructose contained in the high fat HFD is transported
  via glucose transporter 5 (Glut-5) located on the villi in intestine into the blood
  stream and then distributed to many tissues, in particular, the liver carrying Glut-2
  via which fructose is transferred into the cytoplasm of cells, where HFD induces
  steatohepatitis, which can be alleviated by Antrodan at 20–40 mg/kg.'
