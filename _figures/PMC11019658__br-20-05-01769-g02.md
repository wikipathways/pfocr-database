caption: 'Mechanisms by which DHM inhibits tumour cell invasion and metastasis. The
  numbers in the figure indicate the following: (1) DHM inhibits metastasis via the
  NF-κB pathway. (2) DHM suppresses tumour cell invasion by regulating the Snail pathway.
  (3) DHM regulates tumour cell invasion and metastasis through the TNF-α/p38MAPK/MMP-2
  signalling pathway. (4) DHM inhibits the phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2 and JNK
  and decreases the levels of MMP proteins, thereby inhibiting tumour cell migration
  and invasion. (5) DHM inhibits tumour cell migration and invasion by regulating
  miR-21. DHM, dihydromyricetin'
