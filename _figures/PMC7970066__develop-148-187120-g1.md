caption: A simplified representation of the canonical auxin signaling pathway. A highly
  simplified snapshot of the nuclear-localized, canonical auxin response pathway.
  In the absence of auxin, Aux/IAAs connect A-ARFs to TPL co-repressors, thereby repressing
  auxin-responsive gene transcription. Auxin then triggers the association of Aux/IAAs
  with the SCFTIR1/AFB complex, leading to their polyubiquitylation and subsequent
  degradation. The removal of Aux/IAAs (and with them the TPL) activates A-ARFs and
  induces gene expression.
