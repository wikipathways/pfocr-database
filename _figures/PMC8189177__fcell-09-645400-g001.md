caption: The role of FGF10 in white and Beige adipocyte development. (A) FGF10-stimulated
  activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway induces proliferation of white preadipocytes
  via cyclin D2-dependent phosphorylation of p130. (B) Bone morphogenic protein 4
  (BMP4), acting downstream of FGF10, is known to regulate FGF10-mediated bud outgrowth
  during branching morphogenesis of the developing lung, thus contributing to controlling
  bud size. In adipogenesis, BMP4 stimulates commitment of pluripotent stem cells
  toward the white adipocyte lineage. However, whether a dynamic interplay between
  FGF10 and BMP4 occurs in adipogenesis, similar to that seen in embryonic lung development,
  remains to be elucidated. (C) FGF10 is part of a miRNA-327-regulated autocrine loop
  that stimulates development of Beige adipocytes from Pdgfrα+ white preadipocytes.
  However, Beige adipocytes are also thought to arise from mature white adipocytes
  via β-3 adrenergic stimulation, cold exposure, and chronic PPAR-γ induction. (D)
  FGF10, via a number of signaling routes, activates downstream PPAR-γ, which in turn
  induces white adipocyte differentiation. (E) FGF10 overexpression in intramuscular
  adipocytes enhanced the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and LPL-induced lipid
  accumulation, suggesting a possible role for FGF10 in regulating adipocyte metabolism.
  However, LPL is also known to be regulated by PPAR-γ, and thus whether FGF10 would
  target LPL directly or via PPAR-γ to exert its effects in adipocyte metabolism remains
  to be determined.
