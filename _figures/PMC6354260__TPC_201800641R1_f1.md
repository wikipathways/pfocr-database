caption: 'Triterpene Glycoside Structures and Avenacin Biosynthesis.(A) Avenacins:
  antifungal defense compounds from oat.(B) Soyasaponin Ab, a triterpene glycoside
  associated with bitterness and anti-feedant activity in soybean.(C) Current understanding
  of the avenacin biosynthetic pathway. The major avenacin, A-1, is synthesized from
  the linear isoprenoid precursor 2,3-oxidosqualene. 2,3-Oxidosqualene is cyclized
  by the triterpene synthase AsbAS1 (SAD1) to the pentacyclic triterpene scaffold
  β-amyrin (). β-Amyrin is then oxidized to EpHβA by the cytochrome P450 enzyme AsCYP51H10
  (SAD2; ). Subsequent, as-yet uncharacterized modifications involve a series of further
  oxygenations and addition of a branched trisaccharide moiety at the C-3 position,
  initiated by introduction of an l-Ara. Acylation at the C-21 position is performed
  by the AsSCPL1 (SAD7). The acyl donor used by AsSCPL1 is N-methyl anthranilate glucoside,
  which is generated by the methyl transferase AsMT1 and the glucosyl transferase
  AsUGT74H5 (SAD10; , ; ).'
