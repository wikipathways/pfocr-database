caption: Schematic overview of the Hedgehog signaling pathway and depiction of key
  regulatory interfaces. (a) The Hedgehog (Hh) protein N-terminal domain is cleaved
  by the C-terminal domain, yielding Hh-N products (Shh-N, Dhh-N or Ihh-N signified
  by the Hh protein), inside Hh-producing cells. Addition of cholesterol to the C-terminus
  and palmitoylation of the N-terminus produces the active, secreted signaling molecule.
  Shh-N binding to PTCH1 and the co-receptors CDO and BOC alleviates the inhibition
  of Smoothened (Smo), allowing the dissociation of Gli proteins from the Kif7 and
  SuFu proteins. Subsequent activation and transport to the nucleus allows the Gli
  proteins to carry out activation or repression of transcription, including the upregulation
  of Hh pathway proteins. (b) Cartoon diagram of the quaternary complex between the
  FNIII domain of co-receptor CDO, a human homologue of Interference Hedgehog (Ihog),
  bound to Shh-N (PDB entry 3d1m; McLellan et al., 2008). (c) Cartoon diagram of the
  quaternary complex of the PTCH1 transmembrane receptor bound to Shh-N (PDB entry
  6dmy; Gong et al., 2018). (d) Cartoon diagram of the quaternary complex of the HHIP
  membrane protein bound to Shh-N (PDB entry 2wfx; Bishop et al., 2009).
