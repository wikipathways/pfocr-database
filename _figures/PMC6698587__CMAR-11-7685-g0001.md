caption: Regulating mechanisms of UCA1 in multiple human cancers. (A) UCA1 acted as
  a ceRNA to bind with miR-204-5p to increase the expression of CREB1, BCL2 and RAB22A.
  (B) UCA1 functioned as a ceRNA to bind with miR-204 to upregulate SOX4 expression
  level. (C) Increased UCA1 could upregulate N-cadherin and vimentin expression, while
  E-cadherin, an epithelial marker, was downregulated. (D) UCA1 served as an endogenous
  sponge of miR-143 to increase the expression of HMGB1 then promote EMT process.
  (E) Silencing UCA1 could repress the expression of FGFR1to inhibit the activation
  of ERK signaling pathway. (F) UCA1 could regulate the expression of β-catenin to
  activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (G) The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was
  activated when UCA1 was highly expressed.
