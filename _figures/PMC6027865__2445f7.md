  in the wild-type and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase deletion strains. A., B. Maps
  of primary metabolism (glycolysis, TCA cycle and pentose phosphate pathway) showing
  the average levels of identified pathway-specific metabolites of 4 biological replicates
  in the wild-type (WT), ΔpkpA, ΔpkpB and ΔpkpC strains when grown for A. 16 h in
  glucose-rich or for B. 48 h in cellulose-rich medium.
