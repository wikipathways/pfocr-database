caption: Schematic representation of the primary epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR) signaling pathway. During normal EGFR signaling, receptor activation is dependent
  on ligand-mediated receptor dimerization. Once the subunits dimerize, a series of
  phosphorylation events serve to enhance EGFR kinase activity to stimulate the activation
  of downstream targets. Downstream signals are propagated by EGFR through three central
  pathways via both the direct phosphorylation of downstream targets (the JAK/STAT
  pathway) and the membrane recruitment of key adaptor proteins (the PI3K/AKT and
  MAPK pathways) to promote cell survival and proliferation. The EGFR signaling through
  a conserved core of three downstream signaling pathways demonstrates how the activation
  of this pathway via parallel RTKs, such as HER2, HER3, and MET, can circumvent the
  inhibitory effects of cetuximab and erlotinib on EGFR. EGFR, epidermal growth factor
  receptor; JAK/STAT, Janus activated kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription;
  PI3K/AKT, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; HER3, human epidermal growth
  factor receptor 3; MET, hepatocyte growth factor receptor; SOS, son of sevenless;
  GRB2, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; RAS, rat sarcoma family of proteins;
  RAF, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma; MEK, MAPK kinase; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin
  homolog; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; FOXO, forkhead box proteins; NF-κB,
  nuclear factor-kappa B.
