caption: 'Timeline of clinical trials of drugs targeting Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  This figure illustrates Part 5: Clinical applications of drugs targeting the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway, emphasizing the advancement of clinical trials for these pharmacological
  agents. Dates in black text denote the initiation of the trials, whereas dates in
  red text signify the publication of the initial clinical trial results. Notably,
  a portion of these trials has yet to release their findings'
