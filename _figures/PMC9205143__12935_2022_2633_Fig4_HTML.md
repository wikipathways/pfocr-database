caption: The role of MIR4435-2HG in the pathogenesis of ovarian and breast cancers.
  In ovarian cancer, MIR4435-2HG regulates migration, invasion and apoptosis through
  modulating the expression of CDK14. The effect of MIR4435-2HG is exerted via sponging
  miR-128-3p. In addition, MIR4435-2HG enhances the progression of ovarian cancer
  via activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. In breast cancer, MIR4435-2HG sponges
  miR-22-3p and results in a subsequent increase in TMEM9B expression and tumorigenesis
