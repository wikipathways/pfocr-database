caption: Map of molecular interactions involving GADD45 proteins and cell signaling
  pathways generated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA). Top functions
  identified by IPA were Cell Death, Cell Cycle and Cell Growth and Proliferation.
  Each of the node shapes denotes the function of the interacting protein or group
  of proteins. Molecular interactions are indicated by the lines between nodes. For
  the details on gene/protein abbreviations, see .
