caption: Non-apoptotic role of caspases in dendritic arborization neuron remodelling.
  (a) Overview of Drosophila white pre-pupae (grey) with abdominal dendritic arborization
  (da) sensory neurons in superficial position on dorsal body wall aspect (green).
  (b) Da sensory neurons undergo remodelling during early metamorphosis. Pruning starts
  with initial thinning of branches, followed by severing at 6 h after puparium formation
  (APF), and is completed with the clearance fragments of the severed branches by
  18 h APF. (c) The apoptotic machinery involved in the pruning of da neurons includes
  Dark (dApaf1), the fly caspaseDronc, DIAP1 and its regulator UbcD1. The question
  marks represent the current unknowns in the pathway. Ca2+, calcium ions; IBP, IAP-binding
  motif proteins; IK2, IκB kinase
