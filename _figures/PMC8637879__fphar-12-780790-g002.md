caption: 'Potential mechanism of pyroptosis in the pathogenesis of DN. Hyperglycemia-induced
  production of ROS plays a key role in the initiation and progression of DN. Left:
  One ROS signaling pathway leads to dissociation of TXNIP from Trx and subsequent
  activation of NLRP3 and the Casp1/GSDMD canonical pyroptosis pathway. Right: Another
  ROS signaling pathway leads to activation of Casp3 via Casp8 or via mitochondrial
  dysfunction; in both cases, there is induction of Casp3/GSDME-mediated pyroptosi,
  leading to inflammation and fibrosis. Abbreviation: DN, diabetic nephropathy; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; TXNIP, thioredoxin interacting protein; Trx, thioredoxin;
  NLRP3, NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing three; Casp1, caspase-1;
  Casp3, caspase-3; GSDME, gasdermin E.'
