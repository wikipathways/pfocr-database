caption: 'a Oxidative damage. Ferroptosis is caused by lipid peroxidation with the
  involvement of various enzymes (ACSL, LPCAT4, ALOX, and POR). This is further regulated
  by fatty acid metabolism, including CD36-mediated PUFA uptake, ACAC-dependent PUFA
  synthesis, or lipophagy-induced PUFA production. In addition, ferroptosis is activated
  by the iron-mediated Fenton reaction. Therefore, ferroptosis sensitivity is highly
  related to iron metabolism, including iron uptake (e.g., TF, TFRC, and LTF), storage
  (e.g., ferritin), utilization (e.g., NFS1), distribution (e.g., CISD1), and export
  (e.g., SLC40A1, PROM2, and LCN2). b Antioxidant defense. The SLC7A11-GSH-GPX4 pathway
  and GSH-independent pathway (CoQ10, BH4, dopamine, and PLA2G6) are the main antioxidant
  systems for ferroptotic cell death by inhibiting lipid peroxidation. c ESCRT-III–mediated
  membrane repair or cell adhesion also inhibits ferroptosis through blocking membrane
  damage induced by lipid peroxidation. Abbreviations: ACAC acetyl-CoA carboxylase,
