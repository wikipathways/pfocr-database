caption: Proposed mechanism of mechanical stress–induced activation of EGFR pathway
  in murine tracheal epithelial cells. The compressive stress–induced activation of
  EGFR depends on the TACE-dependent shedding of EGF-family ligands. The activation
  of EGFR, signaling via MAP kinase and the Akt pathway, leads to up-regulated gene
  expression, including select EGF-family ligands. These ligands can initiate a positive
  feedback loop in an autocrine manner, promoting an amplified and prolonged activation
  of EGFR. ADAM17, a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17; P, phosphorylation.
