caption: Examples of “one PSTF per BGC”. (a) PSTF with single conserved function.
  (b) PSTF in the relay of BGCs. (c) PSTF with extended function. (d) PSTF with function
  loss. AD-AfoA (green) means the activation domain (AD) from AfoA. DBD-AlnR (red)
  means the DNA-binding domain (DBD) from AlnR. (e) PSTF with function change. Purple
  indicates backbone genes; red indicates positive PSTFs; grey indicates tailoring
  genes involved in the SM biosynthetic pathway; white indicates genes not involved
  in the SM biosynthetic pathway; orange indicates mirA and mirB genes under the regulation
  of PSTF PbcR and responsible for transporting iron. The dotted black arrow indicates
  the process of protein translation by the PSTF gene; the solid black arrow indicates
  the process of SM(s) production by the BGC; the dotted red arrow indicates the positive
  regulation by the PSTF for all the other biosynthetic genes in the cluster; the
  solid red arrow indicates positive regulation by the PSTF for the specific gene;
  the dotted blue arrow with a stop end indicates the negative regulation by the PSTF
  for the whole cluster genes. (e) is based on Figure 6 in reference []. PSTF = pathway
  specific transcription factor, BGC = biosynthetic gene cluster.
