caption: 'Hypothetical positive feedback pathway necessary for tumor progression.
  In an inflamed region, pro inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 produced by macrophages
  and other immune cells activated epithelial signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 via IL6R signaling. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
  mediates cell proliferation and up regulation of S1PR’s. Signaling from S1PR maintains
  persistently activated STAT3 and up regulation of S1P kinases, which contributes
  to the overall increase in S1P pool. S1P auto-regulates epithelial cell growth and
  modifies immune cell recruitment including CD8+ T and Treg cells. S1P: Sphingosine-1-P.'
