caption: The respective balance between Gi- and Gs-dependent signalling pathways and
  their roles in the modification of FcαRI-mediated mast cell degranulation. For clarity,
  many of the intermediary steps in the FcαRI-dependent signalling pathway have been
  omitted. For further details concerning this pathway and the pathways regulating
  cytokine production and eicosanoid release, the readers are referred to the text
  and references [, ]. FcαRI aggregation leads to the phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)-mediated
  production of diaclglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) which respectively
  activate protein kinase C (PKC) and mobilize calcium from intracellular stores,
  essential signals for degranulation. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), primarily
  the p110δ subunit, contributes to a maintained calcium signal partly through the
  Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk)-dependent enhancement of PLCγ activation. Gi-coupled
  receptors impact these events positively by downregulating the production of cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) which is a negative signal for mast cell activation
  and by promoting the activation of PI3Kγ and PLCβ. In contrast Gs-coupled receptors
  impact FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation by enhancing the production of cAMP which,
  via activation of protein kinase A (PKA), inhibits mast cell activation by an, as
  yet, unknown mechanism. S1P2 and P2Y which are coupled to Gq-to induce calcium flux
  and result in degranulation (not shown in this figure). The green lines and positive
  symbols designate activating signalling pathways and the red lines and -symbols
  represent inhibiting signalling pathways.
