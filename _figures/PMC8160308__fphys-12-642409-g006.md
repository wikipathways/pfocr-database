caption: Schematic representation of ATRAP-mediated actions on c-Src phosphorylation
  status, ROMK expression at the plasma membrane, and ROMK activity. M-1 cells overexpressing
  control LacZ protein has a decreased K+ conductance after Ang II treatment, an effect
  that was associated with lower expression of ROMK at the plasma membrane and induction
  of c-Src phosphorylation, the classical signaling pathway for ROMK inhibition by
  Ang II. Conversely, M-1 cells overexpressing the ATRAP do not show significant decreases
  in K+ conductance after Ang II treatment and plasma membrane ROMK expression, which
  was also associated with a blunted response of c-Src phosphorylation.
