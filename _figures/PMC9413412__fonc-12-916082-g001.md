caption: The core signaling pathway of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is a special type
  of cell death characterized by excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species
  and lipid peroxidation. It is induced by the imbalance of oxidation and anti-oxidation.
  On the one hand, ferroptosis is induced by the accumulation of ROS from iron-induced
  Fenton reaction, NOX family and mitochondrion dysfunction. On the other hand, ferroptosis
  is prevented by anti-oxidation systems including the GSH-GPX4 pathway, FSP1-CoQ10
  pathway, GCH1-BH4 pathway and NRF2-HMOX1/MT1G pathway. SLC7A11, solute carrier family
