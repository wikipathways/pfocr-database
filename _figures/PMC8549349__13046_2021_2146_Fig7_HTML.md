caption: Proposed model of ZIP10 regulation of proliferation and chemoresistance in
  osteosarcoma. ZIP10 expression is elevated in OS, which might be a result of Zn
  deficiency and chemotherapy. ZIP10 increases Zn uptake and activates CREB and its
  binding to the ITGA10 promotor and thus promotes ITGA10 expression in OS cells.
  ITGA10 is an important membrane-anchored protein that confers OS cell proliferation
  and chemoresistance through activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Targeting
  ZIP10 in OS might increase chemotherapy sensitization in OS
