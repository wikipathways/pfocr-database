caption: Model for the potential role of altered cytokine-mediated signal transduction
  and mitochondrial metabolism in DPI- and DTI-related growth control. In this hypothetical
  model, activation of the Jak/Stat pathway (A) is blocked by drug-induced inhibition
  of ROS production from Nox isoforms that results in an enhancement of intracellular
  phosphatase activity (B). Whether DPI- or DTI-related alterations in mitochondrial
  ROS affect intracellular phosphatases remains speculative, and is probably cell
  context dependent, as indicated by the question mark in the figure. DPI or DTI may
  also directly or indirectly modify cell proliferation downstream of Jak/Stat by
  way of the Ras or PI3K pathways through dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 and/or Akt,
  or by direct effects on oxidative phosphorylation and other mitochondrial metabolic
  pathways distinct from the generation of ROS.
