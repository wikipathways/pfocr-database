caption: A Lung parenchymal epithelial cells undergo necroptosis due to direct exposure
  to toxic gases and particles (e.g. cigarette smoke). Excessive DAMPs are released
  and linked to PRRs on neighbouring macrophages after plasma membrane rupture, leading
  to pro-inflammatory cytokine production through multiple pathways and consequently
  causing inflammation and tissue remodelling in the lung parenchyma. In addition,
  the impaired ability of macrophages to phagocytose apoptotic epithelial cells in
  COPD and the slower clearance of necroptosis cells by macrophages can cause inadequate
  phagocytosis of dead cells, which triggers inflammation. B Epithelial cell membrane
  receptors bind to the corresponding ligands (e.g. TNF-α) and send signals to cause
  RIPK1 activation, followed by RIPK3 recruitment and phosphorylation. Mitochondrial
  ROS contributes to RIPK1 autophosphorylation, but the production is dependent on
  RIPK3. RIPK3 can also mediate MLKL phosphorylation, causing MLKL oligomerisation
  and translocation to the plasma membrane for forming plasma membrane pores and therefore
  releasing excessive DAMPs (including HMGB1 and ATP) to the extracellular environment.
  HMGB1 activates RAGE receptors on macrophages and promotes pro–IL-1β production
  via the MAPK/NF-κB pathway. Pro–IL-1β is cleaved by ATP-induced pathway products
  to form IL-1β. In addition, HMGB1 interacts with RAGE on the surface of macrophages
  and PS on the surface of apoptotic cells to participate in the inhibition of the
  macrophage uptake of apoptotic epithelial cells. ATP adenosine 5′-triphosphate,
