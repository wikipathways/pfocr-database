caption: ARA biosynthesis. ARA C20:4n-6 in humans is not synthesized de novo but from
  linoleic acid C18:2n-6. As linoleoyl-CoA C18:2n-6, this PUFA undergoes desaturation
  to γ-linolenoyl-CoA C18:3n-6 with FADS2/D6D. This fatty acyl-CoA is then converted
  to dihomo-γ-linolenoyl-CoA C20:3n-6 with ELOVL5 and, finally, to arachidonyl-CoA
  C20:4n-6 with FADS1/D5D. Dihomo-γ-linolenoyl-CoA C20:3n-6 can also be formed from
  linoleoyl-CoA via an alternative pathway. Linoleoyl-CoA C18:2n-6 first undergoes
  elongation with ELOVL5 and then desaturation with FADS2. The latter enzyme in this
  pathway exhibits Δ8-desaturase activity. ↑—higher expression of given enzymes in
  GBM tumor relative to healthy tissue.
