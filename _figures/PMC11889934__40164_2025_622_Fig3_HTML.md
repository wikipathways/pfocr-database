caption: 'Molecular modifications of lactylation in cancer. a) Autophagy in cells:
  Lactylation of DCBLB1 can inhibit the degradation of key enzymes in the pentose
  phosphate pathway, thereby extending their existence, while also inhibiting its
  own degradation to form a positive feedback loop. In contrast, the lactylation of
  Vps34 and TFEB-19 increases autophagy flux. b) Cancer metabolic reprogramming and
  stemness: High glycolysis in cancer creates an environment for lactylation modifications,
  which can affect cancer stemness by promoting the transcription of YTHDF2, NCL,
  and PDGFRβ, thus facilitating the occurrence and development of tumors. c) Angiogenesis
  and drug resistance: Lactate, mediated by MCT4, induces the lactylation of HIF-1α,
  promoting the expression of angiogenic factor VEGFA, while inhibiting the expression
  of semaphorin 3 A (Sema3A), thereby driving the transcription of KIAA1199, enhancing
  angiogenesis, and leading to chemotherapy resistance. d) Tumor proliferation and
  metastasis: Lactylation of H3K18 activates the transcription of GPR37, promoting
  cancer metastasis, and in another type of tumor cell, upregulates the transcription
  of VCAM1, thereby activating the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway to enhance the proliferation
  and migration of gastric cancer cells. e) Immune evasion: Lactylation modification
  of histones regulates IL and PD-1, thereby inhibiting the antiviral activity of
  immune cells and promoting immune evasion of tumors'
