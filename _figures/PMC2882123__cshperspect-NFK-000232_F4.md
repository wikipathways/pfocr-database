caption: Induction of Toll and Imd pathway by pathogens. Gram-positive bacteria are
  recognized by PGRP-SA with the cooperation of GNBP1 and PGRP-SD. This recognition
  results in activation of a proteolytic cascade culminating in the cleavage of Spaetzle
  via the serine protease Spaetzle Processing Enzyme (SPE). Dimeric cleaved Spaetzle
  binds to the Toll receptor, activating the intracellular signaling cascade shown
  in . Fungi are recognized by GNBP3 and induce a proteolytic cascade, which also
  activates SPE. Entomopathogenic fungi have been shown to also activate the Toll
  pathway through secreted proteases, which activate the circulating zymogen Persephone
  (virulence factor). Gram-negative bacteria are directly detected by the transmembrane
  receptor PGRP-LC, which recognizes the DAP-type peptidoglycan. The amidase PGRP-LB
  and PGRP-SC degrade PGN to nonimmunogenic moieties ().
