caption: '(A–C) Schematic overview of particle-based vaccines. (A) Three particle
  prototypes used to create therapeutic vaccines include porous silicon microparticles,
  poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles, and liposomes. Each type of particle has
  unique features that impact its function and loading capacity, but potential common
  attributes include danger signals, antigens, immunomodulatory agents, and targeting
  entities. (B) Particle vaccines are either preloaded into dendritic cells (DCs)
  ex vivo or administered as free particles for in vivo uptake by antigen presenting
  cells (APCs). The size of the particle impacts its mode of transport to the lymph
  node, with large particles relying on cell-based trafficking and smaller nanoparticles
  independently entering the lymphatics. (C) DCs process and present antigens delivered
  by particles to T cells by means of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
  I or II pathways.Notes: Antigen processing and association with MHC II occurs within
  the endolysosomal pathway, while MHC I-dependent processing occurs within the proteasome
  and ER. Schematic by Matthew Landry.Abbreviations: TCR, T-cell receptor; CD, cluster
  of differentiation.'
