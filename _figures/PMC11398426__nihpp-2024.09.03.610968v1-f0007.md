caption: Model of regulation of STING expression by CBF-β/RUNXIn basal conditions,
  CBF-β acts as a rheostat to fine-tune cGAS-STING pathway activity. In the absence
  of CBF-β/RUNX nuclear translocation, as occurs with sequestration of CBF-β by the
  lentiviral protein Vif, STING is abundantly expressed, thus amplifying the response
  to cGAS activation to stimulate signalling through TBK1 and IRF3, ultimately inducing
  an IFN/ISG-dependent antiviral state. Conversely, CBF-β and RUNX levels are elevated
  in ccRCC, permitting cell growth. Additionally, CBF-β and RUNX binding at the STING
  locus suppresses IFN signalling and likely promotes immune escape
