caption: 'One-carbon metabolism and glutathione (GSH) synthesis and metabolism. Abbreviations:
  B12, vitamin B12; BHMT, betaine homocysteine methyltransferase; DMA, dimethylarsinic
  acid; InAs, inorganic As; MMA, monomethylarsonic acid. Folic acid is reduced to
  tetrahydrofolate (THF) and subsequently converted to 5-methyl THF. In a reaction
  catalyzed by methionine synthetase (MTR), the methyl group of 5‑methyl-THF can be
  transferred to homocysteine, generating methionine. Methionine is activated to form
  S‑adenosylmethionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor. The by-product of methylation
  reactions, S‑adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), is hydrolyzed to homocysteine. Homocysteine
  is either used to regenerate methionine or is directed to the transsulfuration pathway.
  GSH is a product of the transsulfuration pathway. GSH can serve as a continuous
  source of cysteine, which is extremely unstable, via the γ‑glutamyl cycle (adapted
  from Lu 2009). GSH is exported from the cell, and the enzyme γ‑glutamyltransferase
  (GGT) transfers the γ-glutamyl moiety of GSH to an amino acid, often cystine, producing
  cysteinylglycine and γ-glutamyl amino acid. The γ-glutamyl amino acid can be transported
  back into the cell and ultimately metabolized to glutamate. Cysteinylglycine is
  converted to cysteine and glycine by dipeptidase (DP). Cysteine is unstable extracellularly
  and can oxidize to cystine; both cysteine and cystine can be imported back into
  the cell for GSH production.'
