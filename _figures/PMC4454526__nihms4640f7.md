caption: A model for the regulation of lifespan by mtROS signaling through the intrinsic
  apoptosis pathway. The intrinsic apoptosis pathway (composed of CED-9, CED-4 and
  CED-3) is sensitive to mtROS from the ETC when it is activated by the alternative
  BH3-only protein CED-13. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to an increase in mtROS
  which activates the CED signalling pathway to reduce ATP usage and redistribute
  it to protective rather than active functions. We propose that the mitochondrial
  dysfunction in isp-1(qm150) and nuo-6(qm200) mutants induces the mutant phenotypes,
  including longevity, both by directly lowering ATP generation and by stimulating
  mtROS signaling to alter ATP usage. In the wild type this mechanism could provide
  a protective role in case of transient mitochondrial dysfunction or nutrient shortage.
  In the mutants its continuous action leads to the mutant phenotypes, including longevity.
