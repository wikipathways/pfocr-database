caption: Naturally occurring products that inhibit mTOR in BCSCs. This figure illustrates
  the inhibitory effects of various natural compounds on the mTOR pathway in breast
  cancer. Compounds like quercetin, C3 (combination of SRg3 and RRg3), ursolic acid,
  dioscin, sophoridine, pentadecanoic acid, matcha green tea (MGT), and decarboxymethyl
  oleuropein aglycone (DOA) derived from extra-virgin olive oil inhibit mTOR activity
  through modulation of upstream regulators, including PTEN and Akt. These compounds
  reduce cancer cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, and self-renewal
  of BCSCs by disrupting key processes such as glycolysis and DNA methylation, inducing
  apoptosis, and reducing mammosphere formation. Mechanistic pathways involve inhibition
  of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis, highlighting their potential as adjunctive or alternative
  therapies for breast cancer, particularly in aggressive subtypes like TNBC
