caption: Molecular mechanisms of LPS bacterial interaction with dental stem cells.
  Binding of LPS induces dimerization of two TLR4-MD2 units, and dimerization of the
  TLR4-MD2 complex signals physiological recognition of LPS. The lipid A component
  is responsible for LPS binding to MD2. The resulting complex then binds to TLR4
  and triggers a signaling cascade leading to the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines that activate to NF-kβ pathway, Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and MAPK. These
  events accumulate pro-inflammatory signaling in DTSCs and surrounding causes, and
  decreased differentiation. The NF-kβ signaling pathway may have a dual effect on
  DTSCs, they may inhibit osteogenic differentiation or induce the activation of genes
  involved in odontogenic differentiation such as DMP-1 and DSP. On the other hand,
  the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway promotes osteogenic differentiation and the
  expression of odontogenic genes. In both pathways, the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1, TNF-α, and Wnt5a, is triggered. DTSCs, dental tissue-derived
