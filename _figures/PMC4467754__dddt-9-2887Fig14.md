caption: 'A scheme of possible mechanisms by which AT-101 enhances the anticancer
  activity of CDDP in NSCLC. AT-101 is a BH3 mimetic and pan inhibitor of Bcl-2 and
  CDDP acts as a DNA intercalator. CDDP can crosslink with the purine bases on the
  DNA, interfering with DNA repair, causing DNA damage, and eventually inducing apoptosis
  of cancer cells. AT-101 can enhance the antitumor effects of CDDP in NSCLC via inhibition
  of APE1/Ref-1 DNA repair and redox activities. As a primary DNA repair protein,
  APE1/Ref-1 recognizes and repairs mutagenic noncoding AP sites in DNA molecules
  resulting from spontaneous, chemical, or DNA glycosylase-mediated hydrolysis of
  the N-glycosyl bond via the BER pathway. APE1/Ref-1 mainly possesses 5′-endonuclease
  activity, but it also shows minor 3′-phosphodiesterase, 3′-phosphatase, and 3′→5′
  exonuclease activities. Accumulation of unrepaired AP sites will promote cell death
  by serving as blocks to DNA replication, stalling RNA transcription, or promoting
  double-stranded DNA breaks. As a redox protein, APE1/Ref-1 can activate multiple
  transcriptional factors including AP-1, p53, NF-κB, NRF1, ATF1, NF-Y, Myb, CREB,
  PEBP2, STAT3, NRF2, HIF-1α, PAXs 5 and 8, HLF, and Egr-1. Activation of APE1/Ref-1
  involves the reduction of Cys65 to a sulfhydryl state. Therefore, APE1/Ref-1 is
  involved in the regulation of cellular growth, proliferation and differentiation,
  cell cycle control, apoptosis, autophagy, and angiogenesis. Elevated levels of APE1/Ref-1
  have been linked to drug resistance, poor prognosis, and poor survival in cancer
  patients. Inhibition of APE1/Ref-1 may represent a useful approach to sensitize
  cancer cells to DNA intercalators such as CDDP and carboplatin. AT-101 also inhibits
  tumor angiogenesis via downregulation of the VEGF/VEGF receptor 2 pathway. In addition,
  AT-101 can induce or inhibit autophagy of cancer cells.Abbreviations: APE1, apurinic/apyrimidinic
