caption: Signaling functions of SIRT3 relevant to cancer metastasis. (A) SIRT3 regulates
  cancer metastasis by modulating tumor metabolism reprogramming. As a tumor-suppressing
  protein, SIRT3 deacetylates and inactivates ACO2 to inhibit adipogenesis and cancer
  metastasis. As a tumor-promoting protein, SIRT3 deacetylates and activates ACC1
  and the AMPK/PPAR pathway to mediate FA synthesis and promote cancer metastasis.
  (B) SIRT3 regulates cancer metastasis by modulating EMT. As a tumor-suppressing
  protein, SIRT3 up-regulates Twist and inhibits EMT-related markers such as E-cadherin,
  N-cadherin, and N-cadherin by affecting FOXO3α, AKT, and Wnt/β-catenin/FOXO3α pathway,
  thereby inhibiting EMT and cancer metastasis. As a tumor-promoting protein, SIRT3
  regulates the NFκB/SIRT3/MnSOD pathway to promote EMT and cancer metastasis. (C)
  Other relevant mechanisms that SIRT3 participates in cancer metastasis. As a tumor-suppressing
  protein, SIRT3 regulates autophagy, and inhibits ROS production through SOD2 and
  the Src/FAK pathway, leading to suppression of cancer metastasis. As a tumor-promoting
  protein, SIRT3 deacetylates and regulates SOD2, MTHFD2, PKMYT1, and the SIRT3 axis
  of the UPRmt to promote cancer metastasis.
