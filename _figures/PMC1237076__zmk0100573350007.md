caption: The Wnt-NLK pathway inhibits the activity of Myb family of proteins by two
  different mechanisms. The Wnt-NLK pathway inhibits A-Myb activity by blocking the
  interaction between A-Myb and CBP and inducing the methylation of histone H3-K9.
  In contrast, the Wnt-NLK pathway inhibits c-Myb activity by inducing proteasome-dependent
  c-Myb degradation.
