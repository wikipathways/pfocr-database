caption: A. muciniphila regulating mechanisms associated with metabolic diseases.
  (1) Pasteurized A. muciniphila reduces glycerol and fatty acid levels and triglyceride
  (TG) production through inhibiting carbohydrate absorption. A. muciniphila cellular
  lysate upregulates serine protease inhibitor peptidase inhibitor clade 3G (SERPINA3G)
  expression in adipocytes and inhibits adipogenesis. (2) Activation of toll-like
  receptors 2 (TLR2) by Amuc _1100, an outer membrane protein of A. muciniphila, increases
  the thickness of the mucus layer and promotes the expression of tight junction proteins
  ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin3. The enhancement of intestinal barrier function will
  hinder the insulin resistance induced by the activation of NF-KB/MAPKs signaling
  pathway caused by the combination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) penetration and toll-like
  receptors 4 (TLR4). The glucagon-like protein P9 produced by A. muciniphila binds
  to the intercellular adhesion molecule 2 (ICAM-2) on the surface of L cells and
  activates phospholipase C (PLC), intracellular Ca2+ signaling, and CREB. P9 is involved
  in the secretion of GLP-1. Short- chain fatty acids (SCFAs) increased by A. muciniphila
  supplementation interact with free fatty acid receptor (FFAR) 2 and 3 on the surface
  of L cells to stimulate the secretion of GLP-1. (3) Pasteurized A. muciniphila inhibits
  the conversion of trimethylamine (TMA) to trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) by reducing
  the expression of hepatic flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), and lowers the ratio of
  TAM/TAMO in plasma. A. muciniphila reduces the organism cholesterol (CHOL) and inflammation
  levels, indirectly reducing the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease
  (CVD). (4) A. muciniphila indirectly decreases liver fat by regulating the level
  of free fatty acids (FFAs) in plasma. Supplementation with A. muciniphila increased
  the levels of L-aspartate in the gut-hepatic axis. L-Aspartate stimulate lipid oxidation
  and released energy by activating the hepatic LKB1-AMPK axis, thereby reducing liver
  fat accumulation. The figure was created using Figdraw
