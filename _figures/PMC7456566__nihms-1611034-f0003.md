caption: Key processes of apoptosis, cell proliferation, cellular differentiation,
  and epigenetic homeostasis are deregulated by mutation or gene copy-number and/or
  gene expression alterations in fusion negative (FN) or fusion positive (FP) rhabdomyosarcoma
  (RMS). In FP RMS, chromosomal translocations result in PAX3–FOXO1 or PAX7–FOXO1
  fusion genes. The aberrant PAX3–FOXO1 fusion protein can synergize with loss of
  p16 or p53 functionality that is associated with CDKN2A gene loss and/or promoter
  methylation and TP53 mutation. The stability and subcellular localization of the
  PAX3–FOXO1 protein is dependent on phosphorylation of specific sites and it works
  in a complex that can include BRD4. The PAX3-FOXO1 containing complex acts as pioneer
  factor and drives expression of other transcription factors such as MYCN and MYOD1
  via super-enhancers that lead to reprogramming of the transcriptional and epigenetic
  landscape of tumors. The genes encoding MYCN and MYOD1 transcription factors may
  themselves be genetically amplified or mutated, likely contributing to RMS formation
  or progression in a subset of cases, respectively. The fusion protein also drives
  expression of specific receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Overexpression and activating
  mutations of genes encoding the same RTKs, and mutation of genes encoding downstream
  signaling components, are seen in FN RMS. Together this leads to frequent activation
  of PI3K and RAS pathway signaling in FP and FN RMS, which likely contribute to disease
  pathogenesis by altering cell proliferation, apoptosis, and other metabolic pathways
  in ways that are not yet precisely defined. Next-generation DNA sequencing and other
  molecular genetics tools have demonstrated deleterious mutations in genes encoding
  certain proteins involved in RMS pathogenesis (*). Exactly how these pathways driven
  RMS pathogenesis is not clear.
