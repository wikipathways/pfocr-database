caption: A brief diagram of the mechanisms of molecular hydrogen. The main mechanisms
  of action of hydrogen are anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, regulation of apoptosis,
  regulation of energy metabolism, and immunomodulation. The anti‐inflammatory effect
  is mainly exerted by inhibiting the secretion of proinflammatory factors and the
  activation of proinflammatory signaling pathways. The antioxidant effect is mainly
  achieved by the selective neutralization of •OH and ONOO‐, and inhibition of ROS
  and MDA production. Regulation of apoptosis is mainly achieved by inhibiting apoptosis
  in normal cells and promoting apoptosis in cancer cells. Regulation of energy metabolism
  is mainly achieved by promoting ATP production and inhibiting oxidative stress in
  the endoplasmic reticulum. The immunomodulatory effects are mainly exerted by maintaining
  the Th17/Treg balance and promoting the production of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells
