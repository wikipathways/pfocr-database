caption: Mechanism of action of SERDs. The selective estrogen receptor downregulator/degrader
  (SERD), fulvestrant, exerts anti-tumour effects via the inhibition, downregulation,
  and degradation of the ER, therefore hindering the proliferative effects of estrogen
  in breast cancer cells. The attenuation of ER dimerization via fulvestrant competitively
  binding to the ligand binding domain (LBD)/AF2 domain of the ER results in the impairment
  and inhibition of the fulvestrant-ER complex for nuclear translocation, thus preventing
  the fulvestrant-ER complex from binding to the estrogen response element (ERE) of
  target gene promoters. The impaired dimerization of the ER inhibits its activation,
  as receptor dimerization is critical for ER function and nuclear localization. Additionally,
  the conformational change of the ER via fulvestrant disrupts both the Activation
  Factor 1 and 2 (AF2)- and (AF1)-related transcriptional activity. The fulvestrant-ER
  complex is fragile and unstable, therefore resulting in the accelerated proteasomal
  degradation of the ER in comparison to the ER bound with estradiol or SERMs such
  as tamoxifen. Further, SERDs can influence the pathways involving transcription
  factors such as STAT and AP-1 through the mediation of altered ER-cofactor interactions
  (21, 158–161, 191). Figure generated using (50)
