caption: DARPP-32 regulatory pathways. (A) Simplified view of DARPP-32 pathway. The
  dopamine and glutamate cascades are shown on Left and Right (red and green), respectively.
  A partial view of the states of phosphorylation of DARPP-32 is shown in Center (blue).
  (B) Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation states of DARPP-32. DARPP-32 is phosphorylated
  at Thr-34 by PKA, at Thr-75 by cdk5, at Ser-97 by CK2, and at Ser-130 by CK1. Phospho-Thr-34
  is preferentially dephosphorylated by PP-2B (or calcineurin); phospho-Thr-75 is
  preferentially dephosphorylated by PP-2A; phospho-Ser-130 is preferentially dephosphorylated
  by PP-2C; the phosphatase for phospho-Ser-97 is not yet characterized. Green arrow
  indicates positive effect; red arrows indicate negative effects. [Adapted from Nairn
  et al. ().] (C) Detailed view of DARPP-32 subnetwork. Shown are the various states
  of phosphorylation allowed in our model.
