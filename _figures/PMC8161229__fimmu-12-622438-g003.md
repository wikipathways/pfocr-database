caption: The complicated chemokines and their receptors network in the microenvironment
  of T2DM. The chemokine system plays a variety of roles in the T2DM microenvironment.
  Pancreatic islets and PAT are exposed to an early damage by genetic or environmental
  factors and start to secrete numerous pro-inflammatory chemokines. The chemokines
  and their receptors can also cause a variety of immune cells to enter the pancreatic
  islets and PAT site to play the role of immune attack. Pro-inflammatory chemokines
  are bind to their receptors activating the NF-κB/IκBα and AMPK activation pathway,
  which stimulates a proinflammatory condition. Free fatty acid may also activate
  inflammatory pathways and DNA damage. As a result of the Free fatty acid dysfunction,
  superoxide and subsequently hydrogen peroxide generation (which can combine with
  nitric oxide, an example of ONOO-, to create peroxynitrite, such as ROS/RNS) may
  occur due to compromised mitochondrial ETC and reducing ATP synthesis. All these
  processes impact ER stress, leading to a reduction in the ability to secrete insulin.
  Moreover, T2DM progression is characterized by progressive secretion of pro-inflammatory
  chemokines/cytokines caused by β cell damage. Due to this process, various immune
  cell types (i.e., neutrophils, macrophages, NK cell, dendritic cell and specifically
  T cells) are recruited in the pancreatic tissue. These immune cells further release
  more innate inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to a rapid increase β cell
  death. T2DM, Type 2 diabetes mellitus; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS, reactive
