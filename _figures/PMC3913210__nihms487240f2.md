caption: A. The primary cilium is anchored at the plasma membrane through transitional
  fibers emanating from the basal body. The ciliary membrane maintains its unique
  membrane composition through multiple mechanisms including a diffusion barrier surrounding
  the ciliary base. Ciliary proteins pass through the ciliary gate to enter and exit
  the cilium. The ciliary gate is mostly made up of the transition zone. This specialized
  region is characterized by Y-shaped links that demarcate the ciliary necklace and
  connect the axoneme to the ciliary membrane. Septin ring and a nuclear pore-like
  structure also contribute to the ciliary diffusion barrier at its base.The transition
  zone contains several protein complex networks that function in ciliary assembly
  and sorting. For instance, transition zone proteins Tectonic 1 and 2 participate
  in targeting Smo and Arl13b to the primary cilium in some cell types. Septin appears
  to confer important barrier properties at the ciliary base and is known to control
  Smo trafficking. An intraflagellar transport (IFT) system is responsible for ciliary
  construction and maintenance. It consists of the IFT particles (A and B complexes)
  that are moved along the axoneme through their interactions with the anterograde
  (kinesin II) and retrograde (dynein 2) motors. IFT is known to be involved in Hh
  signal transduction. Several components of the IFT complexes have been shown to
  influence the distribution of Hh components on the cilium and affect Hh signaling
  in a complex manner. For instance, disruption of IFT139 (THM1) in IFT A complex
  or IFT122/25 in IFT B complex both leads to accumulation of Hh components on the
  cilium but Hh signaling is enhanced in Thm1/Ift122 mutants while it is reduced in
  Ift25 mutants. The coat-like BBSome complex is involved in the trafficking of molecules
  between the plasma and ciliary membrane and may contribute to the dynamic ciliary
  distribution of Smo and Ptch1. Taken together, these studies highlight the fact
  that multiple mechanisms regulate ciliary protein distribution and understanding
  how they interact to control Hh component distribution and signaling on the cilium
  is a key unresolved issue.B. Summary of changes in ciliary distribution of Hh pathway
  components and Hh pathway activity in various mutants that affect ciliary structure
  and function.
