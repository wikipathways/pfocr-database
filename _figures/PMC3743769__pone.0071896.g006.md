caption: After cells are exposed to IGF-1, IGF-1R is activated, which then activates
  the PI3K-Akt pathway. The activated Akt then phosphorylates FOXO3a, leading to its
  translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and thereby preventing FOXO3a from
  binding to the PRNP promoter (black arrows and streaks). With no or low levels of
  IGF-1 or in the presence of LY294002, the negative regulation of PI3K-Akt on FOXO3a
  is impaired. Then, FOXO3a is able to relocate to the nucleus, where it binds to
  the PRNP promoter and negatively regulates PRNP expression (red arrows and streaks).
