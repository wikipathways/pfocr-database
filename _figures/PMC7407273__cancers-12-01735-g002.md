caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially methylated genes (n = 996)
  in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. (a) Functional enrichment of the hypermethylated
  (n = 611) and hypomethylated genes (n = 385) annotated from the differentially methylated
  probes (DMPs); (b) interactions between the enriched pathways evidencing the number
  of shared differentially methylated genes. The pathways in red and green are those
  enriched for hyper- and hypomethylated genes, respectively, and those in lilac are
  enriched for both methylation profiles.
