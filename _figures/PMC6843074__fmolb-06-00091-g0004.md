caption: IL-22 signaling pathway for expression of acute phase response proteins.
  1. IL-22 receptor is a heterodimer of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2. Initially IL-22 binds
  to IL-22R1. 2. Upon binding, conformational change in IL-22 enhances its affinity
  toward IL-10R2. 3. leading to formation of heterodimeric receptor intracellularly,
  IL-22R1 is associated with JAK1 and STAT3 (STAT3 is recruited through tyrosine-independent
  recruitment) and IL-10R2 is associated with tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). 4. Binding
  of ligand with receptor initiates the phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2. 5. Receptor
  bound STAT3 is phosphorylated by JAK1. 6. Phosphorylation of STAT3 leads to dimerization
  of STAT3. 7. Dimerized STAT3 translocates to nucleus; in nucleus, it binds to response
  elements and regulate associated proteins. 8. STAT3 binds to different genes coding
  for acute phase proteins by different cells, viz. to viz. a). Epithelial cell (β-defensin
  2, β-defensin 3, lipocalin 2, MMP1 and MMP3, S100A7, S100A8, S100A9 b). tracheal
  epithelial cells (CXCL5); c). synovial fibroblast (CCL2/RANKL); d). hepatic and
  pancreatic cells (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, MCL-1, Cyclin D1, p21, CDK4).
