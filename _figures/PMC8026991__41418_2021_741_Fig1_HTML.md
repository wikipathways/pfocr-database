caption: 'PQM-1 is activated in response to hypoxic stress and represses the expression
  of the sorbitol dehydrogenase (SODH-1) and glycogen levels in worms. SODH-1 enzymatic
  activity converts sorbitol, the sugar alcohol form of glucose, into fructose. PQM-1
  promotes de novo lipid synthesis in hypoxia via expression of the Δ9-fatty-acid
  desaturase FAT-7 (SCD homolog) and positively regulates lipid transport to embryos
  through vitellogenin expression. PQM-1-mediated hypoxic activation of lipid metabolism
  limits parental survival, but is beneficial for progeny development and survival
  under hypoxic stress. Future studies are needed to identify a functional mammalian
  equivalent of PQM-1 downstream of mTORC2 signaling, and to dissect its role for
  tumorigenesis in hypoxic microenvironments. mTORC2 mammalian target of rapamycin
  complex 2, SCD stearoyl-CoA desaturase, SFA saturated fatty acid: stearic acid,
  MUFA mono-unsaturated fatty acid: oleic acid.'
