caption: Proposed pathway for regulation of endothelial cell signaling by breast cancer
  cell-derived EVs and a function-blocking CD47 antibody. CD47 is expressed on tumor
  cell-derived EVs and their target endothelial cells, and the function-blocking CD47
  antibody B6H12 could act at both locations. The right panel depicts previously identified
  CD47-dependent signaling pathways and the newly identified interaction between SIRPα
  and VEGFR2, which may be direct or mediated by the previously identified direct
  lateral interaction between CD47 and VEGFR2 (Kaur et al. ). Green arrows indicate
  targets regulated in their expression or phosphorylation by EVs, and red arrows
  indicate targets regulated by the CD47 function-blocking antibody
