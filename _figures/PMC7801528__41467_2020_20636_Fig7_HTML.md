caption: ISCs reside in intestinal crypts. CREPT maintains the proliferation and differentiation
  of Lgr5+ ISCs at homeostasis. Under damages such as irradiation, CREPT promotes
  the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway through facilitating β-catenin retention
  in the nucleus. CREPT is indispensable for intestinal regeneration, and the deletion
  of CREPT leads to impaired proliferation ability of ISCs and failure of intestinal
  regeneration.
