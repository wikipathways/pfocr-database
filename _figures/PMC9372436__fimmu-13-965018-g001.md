caption: TLRs regulate HBV-specific T-cell responses. TLRs are expressed in T cells,
  hepatocytes, and hepatic non-parenchymal cells, including LSECs, KCs, and DCs. TLRs
  may directly shape the T-cell response as costimulatory molecules. Stimulation of
  TLRs by their ligands leads to the activation of the downstream MyD88/TRIF-dependent
  signaling pathway in hepatic non-parenchymal cells and promotes the maturation of
  these cells, thus promoting antigen presentation to T cells and the production of
  IFNs, proinflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. IFNs exert antiviral effects against
  HBV in infected hepatocytes. Chemokines and inflammatory cytokines recruit DCs,
  macrophages, and specific T cells into the liver and promote HBV-specific T-cell
  activation and proliferation. Activated CLTs then kill infected hepatocytes. CTL,
  cytotoxic T cell; DC, dendritic cell; HBV, hepatitis B virus; IFN, interferon; LSEC,
  liver sinusoidal endothelial cell; KC, Kupffer cell; TLR, Toll-like receptor.
