caption: iTRAQ overview and workflow. Four labels from an iTRAQ 8-plex reagent kit
  were used to conduct our experiments in biological duplicate. Each experiment of
  four labels was combined and fractionated using strong cation exchange. Samples
  were then analyzed using a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer and searched using MaxQuant
  software. Statistical testing and pathway analysis was then performed on the identified
  proteins.
