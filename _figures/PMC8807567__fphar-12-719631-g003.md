caption: 'The cross-talk between the cell cycle and the circadian rhythm. The cross-talk
  between the cell cycle and the circadian rhythm can occur via three major molecular
  mechanisms. Firstly, mitosis inhibitor protein kinase WEE1 regulates the G2/M transition
  by phosphorylating the amino acids of Cdk1 thereby inhibiting the kinase activity
  and preventing entry into mitosis. Wee1 gene promoter consists of CLOCK/BMAL1 responsive
  E-box elements that control the expression of WEE1 in a circadian manner. Secondly,
  the transition of the G1 to S phase is under the circadian control ROR/REV-ERB pathway
  by targeting the p21Waf1/CIP1 a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that negatively
  regulates the cell cycle progression. Thirdly, the phosphorylation of REV-ERBα via
  CDK1 targets this clock transcription inhibitory component for ubiquitination and
  degradation by the F-box protein FBXW7. Abbreviations: BMAL1, Bone Muscle Arnt-like
