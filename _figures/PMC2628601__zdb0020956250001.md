caption: KATP-independent glucose regulation of α-cell glucagon secretion. Hypoglycemic
  stimulation of glucagon secretion occurs through membrane depolarization, which
  is independent of KATP activity (left panel). The stimulation of α-cells with glucose
  leads to reduction of glucagon secretion in part by reducing calcium influx presumably
  through membrane repolarization through an unresolved pathway, which is illustrated
  as “Unknown” and labeled in red. The unknown is sensitive to glucose levels, whereas
  it is insensitive to glucose metabolites; it may be an ion channel or receptor and
  may also be an intracellular signaling mechanism. SST, somatostatin.
