caption: Proposed model for the potential function of circPOLR2A in cRCC progression.
  In the nucleus, circPOLR2A was derived from exons 9 and 10 of the POLR2A gene by
  backsplicing. After export to the cytoplasm, circPOLR2A interacted with UBE3C and
  PEBP1 proteins, and formed a circPOLR2A/UBE3C/PEBP1 protein-RNA ternary complex,
  which facilitated the ubiquitination and degradation of PEBP1 and further activated
  ERK signaling in cRCC progression. Furthermore, circPOLR2A could be modified by
  m6A, and the m6A reader YTHDF2 inhibited circPOLR2A expression in cRCC
