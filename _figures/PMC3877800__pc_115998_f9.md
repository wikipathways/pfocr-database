caption: The Regulatory Mechanism of Pi Uptake and Root-to-Shoot Pi Translocation
  through PHT1s and PHO1 by PHO2.PHO2 localizes to the  and Golgi and suppresses Pi
  uptake and xylem loading of Pi by mediating the protein degradation of PHT1s and
  PHO1, which takes place in the outer cell layer and stele of roots, respectively.
  To simplify the illustration, these two activities are drawn in the same cell. The
  pathway indicated by the dashed line requires further evidence. See text for more
  details. MVB, multivesicular body.
