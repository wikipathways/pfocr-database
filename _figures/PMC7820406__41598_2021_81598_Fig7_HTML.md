caption: 'Proposed model for nodulation signaling and modulation by Bradryhizobium
  elkanii type III effector Bel2-5. A soybean root-derived genistein induces the production
  of Nod factors (NFs) in B. elkanii. Recognition of NFs by NF receptors triggers
  a signaling cascade leading to nodulation. The genistein also induces B. elkanii
  to inject effector proteins into soybean cells. NopL suppress plant defense responses
  by modulating the MAPK cascade. The ErnA effector triggers nodule organogenesis
  by a yet unknown mechanism. Bel2-5 effector likely interferes with the nodulation
  signaling pathway at least at two levels: (1) by modulating cytokinin biosynthesis-related
  genes that promoting nodule organogenesis and (2) by repressing ethylene biosynthesis-related
  genes and host-dependent defence responses that are deleterious to the bacterial
  infection. It should be noted that these DEGs may contain secondary and tertiary
  indirect effects as well as Bel2-5 direct effects.'
