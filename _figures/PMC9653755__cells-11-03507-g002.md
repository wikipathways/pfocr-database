caption: Important targets for osteosarcoma therapy and their main functions. Various
  receptors capable of acting as targets in OS cells serve different purposes. PDGFR
  promotes the survival and migration of OS cells, IGF-1 receptor promotes their differentiation;
  these two receptors can work together to produce mTOR in the PI3K pathway to enable
  OS cells to proliferate and metastasize. In addition to its vasculogenic role, VEGFR
  activates MEK, which has the effect of promoting OS gene expression. In addition
  to its angiogenic effects, VEGFR activates MEK, which also makes a useful contribution
  in promoting OS gene expression. Targets that also have important roles in the cell
  cycle, such as WEE1 acting at the G2/M test site, AURKA/B acting in mitosis, and
  CDKs produced in the G1 phase, show facilitative effects on OS.

  description: Important targets for osteosarcoma therapy and their main functions.
    Various receptors capable of acting as targets in OS cells serve different purposes.
    PDGFR promotes the survival and migration of OS cells, IGF-1 receptor promotes
    their differentiation; these two receptors can work together to produce mTOR in
    the PI3K pathway to enable OS cells to proliferate and metastasize. In addition
    to its vasculogenic role, VEGFR activates MEK, which has the effect of promoting
    OS gene expression. In addition to its angiogenic effects, VEGFR activates MEK,
    which also makes a useful contribution in promoting OS gene expression. Targets
    that also have important roles in the cell cycle, such as WEE1 acting at the G2/M
    test site, AURKA/B acting in mitosis, and CDKs produced in the G1 phase, show
    facilitative effects on OS.
