caption: Effect of amino acids and their derivatives on T cell signaling. A simplified
  scheme of the signaling events downstream of the TCR and costimulation or IL-2R
  signaling is provided. Early signaling (involving the successive recruitment and
  activation of the tyrosine kinases Lck and ZAP70) leads to the phosphorylation of
  the membrane-anchored linker for activation of T cells (LAT) adaptor, which represents
  a crucial signaling node. SLP76 and GADs are involved in pathways important for
  the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The phospholipase C γ (PLCγ) degrades
  the lipid phosphatidylinositol biphosphate (PIP2) to produce diacyl-glycerol (DAG)
  and inositol triphosphate (IP3), two major signaling intermediates, which drive
  three distinct late signaling pathways, involving calcium mobilization, protein
  kinase Cθ (PKCθ) activation and RAS activation, respectively. These three signaling
  pathways lead to the activation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factors
  NFAT, NFκB, and AP1. PIP2 can also be degraded by the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase
  (PI3K) to produce phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP3) which recruits AKT. PI3K
  is activated downstream of TCR signaling effectors, including RAS, but also by costimulatory
  molecules, such as CD28 and the signaling chains of the IL-2 receptor. AKT drives
  one of the signaling pathways leading to the activation of the mammalian target
  of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1 controls the initiation of protein synthesis
  and is central to the anabolic switch of activated T cells. High mTORC1 activity
  is linked to an increased effector (Eff) differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
  and a decreased differentiation of Tregs and memory (Mem) T cells. Amino acids and
  some of the toxic metabolites produced by amino acid-catabolizing enzymes (NO, H2O2,
  and Kyn) can affect some of the early or late steps of the TCR signaling pathways.
  The effects mediated by amino-acid catabolizing enzyme production of these catabolites
  are depicted; in addition, some effects attributed to the monoamines 5-HT and melatonin
  are represented. NO, H2O2, and a decrease in the amino acid level lead to defects
  in early TCR signaling, in particular by diminishing CD3ζ expression. IDO activity,
  potentially through Kyn production, eNOS through NO production modify signaling
  pathways driving actin polymerization. High amino acids levels participate to activating
  the mTORC1 pathway, whereas low amino acid levels lead to the accumulation of empty
  tRNAs which are sensed by the stress kinase GCN2. GCN2 diminishes the general protein
  synthesis but favors the synthesis of a small set of proteins, such as activating
  transcription factor 4 (ATF4). ATF4 induces the transcription of genes involved
  in autophagy and response to cellular stress, including C/EBP Homologous Protein
  (CHOP). The kinases mTORC1 and GNC2 have opposite effects on the differentiation
  of Th1, Th17, and regulatory T cells.
