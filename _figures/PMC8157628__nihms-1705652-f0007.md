caption: 'Working model for a possible G-1–GPR30–CYP7A1 pathway enhancing cholelithogenesis.
  We found that the GPR30-selective agonist G-1 activates hepatic Gpr30 expression,
  with the latter suppressing activity of Cyp7a1, the rate-limiting enzyme for the
  classical pathway of bile salt synthesis. As a result, these changes lead to increased
  biliary cholesterol concentration and hepatic bile salt hyposecretion, thereby reducing
  cholesterol solubility in bile and causing cholesterol-supersaturated bile that
  predisposes to solid cholesterol crystal precipitation and gallstone formation.
  Abbreviations: BS, bile salts; Ch, cholesterol; PL, phospholipids.'
