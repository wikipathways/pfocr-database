caption: The GLP‐1 gut‐renal axis. The role of GLP‐1 is to facilitate macronutrient
  storage through multiple pathways. Two of the pathways shown—the CNS and direct
  pathways—may affect the kidneys by decreasing intraglomerular pressure. This potentially
  may result in decreased nutrient loss or energy expenditure needed to reabsorb nutrients
  such as glucose or amino acids. GLP‐1 works through the pancreatic pathway to increase
  macronutrient storage in the liver, skeletal muscle, and fat by increasing insulin
  and decreasing glucagon levels in a glucose‐dependent manner. The dotted lines represent
  proposed mechanisms whereby the brain, potentially through the autonomic nervous
  system, may reduce sympathetic activity, insulin resistance, and intraglomerular
  pressure. Green text indicates an increase; red text indicates a reduction. ATP,
  adenosine triphosphate; CNS, central nervous system; GI, gastrointestinal; GLP‐1,
  glucagon‐like peptide‐1; NHE, sodium‐hydrogen exchanger
