caption: '(A) Scheme: putative mechanism(s) of signal transduction of cardiac H2-histamine
  receptors stimulated by histamine and antagonized by cimetidine. H2-histamine receptors
  (H2R) can activate adenylyl cyclases (AC) via stimulatory GTP binding proteins (Gs),
  which would enhance the 3′, 5′-cyclic adenosine-phosphate (cAMP)-levels in central
  compartments of the cardiomyocyte. This cAMP can activate cAMP-dependent protein
  kinase (PKA), which would increase the phosphorylation state and thereby, the activity
  of several regulatory proteins in the cardiomyocyte. For instance, PKA-stimulated
  phosphorylation increases the current through the L-type Ca2+ channel (LTCC) and/or
  the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the cardiac ryanodine
  receptor (RYR). This process is thought to initiate cardiac contraction. In diastole,
  Ca2+ is pumped via the SR-Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) from the cytosol into the SR. Activity
  of SERCA is increased when PKA phosphorylates phospholamban (PLB). PKA also phosphorylates
  the inhibitory subunit of troponin (TnI). The phosphorylation of TnI reduces the
  sensitivity of the myofilaments for Ca2+ and thus the muscle will relax faster in
  diastole. The latter effect might also follow from inhibition of PP2A (a serine/threonine
  phosphatase: PP) activity by MAP kinases (mitogen activated protein kinases) and
  subsequent increased phosphorylation state and thus activation of I-1 (a specific
  inhibitory protein of PP1 [serine threonine protein phosphatase 1]), which will
  lead to decreased activity of PP1. PKA can also phosphorylate and thus activate
  the cAMP-dependent transcription factor (CREB). Alternatively (sometimes called
  the non-canonical pathway) the phosphorylation state and thus the activity of ERK1/2,
  JNK (c-jun N terminal kinase), p38 (p38 mitogen activated protein kinase) could
  be enhanced by pathways acting via arrestins. In the human heart, via H2-histamine
  receptor, cAMP-content is increased, PKA is activated, phospholamban and troponin
  I phosphorylation is enhanced and the open probability of the LTCC is augmented.
  (B) Scheme: putative mechanism(s) of signal transduction of cardiac H1-histamine-receptors,
  stimulated after endogenous agonist binding (histamine) on the receptor which can
  be abrogated by an exogenous antagonist like mepyramine. Three putative pathways
  are indicated with Arabic numbers. H1-histamine receptors (H1R) via (labeled 1 in
  the scheme) the α-subunits of the inhibitory GTP-binding proteins (Giα) can inhibit
  the activity of adenylyl cyclases (AC) which would reduce the 3′-5′cyclic adenosine-phosphate
  (cAMP)-levels in central compartments of the cardiomyocyte and thus diminish the
  activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA), which eventually leads to a decline
  in the phosphorylation state of regulatory proteins in the cell. Alternatively (labeled
  2 in the scheme) the activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) might be increased leading
  to formation of arachidonic acid (AA) and finally activation of protein kinase C
  (PKC) leading to protein phosphorylation and hence increased force generation. Lastly
  (labeled 3 in the scheme), H1-histamine-receptors may via GTP binding proteins called
  Gq or G11 activate phospholipase C (PLC). This would increase the level of diacylglycerol
  (=DAG) in the cells and thus elevate the activity of PKC. In addition, PLC leads
  to the formation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which can release Ca2+ from storage
  sites like the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), where it binds to calsequestrin (CSQ)
  is taken up by SR-Ca2+ATPAse (SERCA) which is activated when phospholamban (PLB)
  is phosphorylated by PKA or CaMKII. Ryanodine receptor upon their phosphorylation
  release Ca2+ from the SR which then contributes to force generation. An elevation
  of cytosolic Ca2+ is expected to bind to calmodulin and this can activate a kinase
  (CaMKII). This kinase can phosphorylate and activate nitric oxide (NO) synthase
  (NOS). This activation would lead to the enhanced formation of NO which stimulates
  guanylyl cyclase (GC) thus increases 3′-5′cyclic guanosine-phosphate (cGMP) levels.
  Elevated cGMP can reduce the activity of phosphodiesterase III (PDE III) or enhance
  the activity of phosphodiesterase II (PDE II). This would elevate or reduce cAMP,
  respectively, which would activate or inhibit PKA and eventually increase or decrease
  force generation. In the human heart, H1-histamine receptor stimulation increases
  cGMP- and cAMP-levels, activate PKA and increase force of contraction (). In contrast,
  others reported a decrease of force, at least in some patients after H1-histamine
  receptor stimulation (; ).'
