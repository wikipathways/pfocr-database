caption: PCP signaling-regulated cell migration by endocytosis of adhesion plaques.
  Adhesion plaques serve as anchors to neighboring cells or substrates (1). Noncanonical
  Wnt signaling activates the internalization of the plaque components cadherin and
  protocadherin, predominantly in the rear of the cell (2). Cadherins are routed through
  the endocytic pathway from Rab5 early endosomes to Rab4/11 recycling endosomes (3).
  This allows for the assembly of new anchor points at the front of the cell. Cadherins
  are also routed for degradation to Rab7-positive endosomes and Lamp1 lysosomes (4).
  The differential rate between recycling and degradation determines the amount of
  Cadherin available for adhesion
