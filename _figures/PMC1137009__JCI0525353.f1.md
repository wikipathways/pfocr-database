caption: Lipoxin biosynthesis. There are at least 3 different biosynthetic pathways
  for lipoxin generation. All lead to the insertion of molecular oxygen at 2 sites
  in arachidonic acid by a variety of different enzymes that are generally segregated
  in different cell types and subject to regulation by cytokines and other inflammatory
  stimuli. In the first pathway (A), LXA4 is generated through the action of 15-LO
  from airway epithelia or myeloid cells (neutrophils, monocyte/macrophages), which
  is followed by the action of 5-LO in myeloid cells. In the second pathway (B), LXA4
  is generated from leukotriene A4 (LTA4) (itself a product of 5-LO activity, and
  a leukotriene precursor) through the action of 15-LO or platelet-derived 12-LO.
  In the third pathway (C), arachidonic acid is converted to aspirin-triggered lipoxins
  (ATLs) such as 15-epi-LXA4, via the action of epithelial or endothelial COX-2 in
  the presence of aspirin, which is followed by the action of 5-LO. The ATLs have
  similar activities but greater functional potency due to their relative resistance
  to metabolic inactivation. These pathways likely operate both independently and
  in a coregulated fashion in different tissues and biological situations. H(p)ETE,
  hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid; mono, monocyte/macrophage; PMN, polymorphonuclear
  neutrophil.
