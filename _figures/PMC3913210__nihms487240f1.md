caption: A. In the absence of the Hh ligand, the Hh receptor Patched (Ptch1) inhibits
  the accumulation of the signal transducer, Smoothened (Smo), on the ciliary membrane.
  As a result, at the base of the primary cilium, PKA and Kif7 promote proteolytic
  processing of the transcription factor Gli3 bythe proteasome into a repressor form
  (GliR) that suppresses Hh target gene expression in the nucleus. In addition, Sufu
  stabilizes the Gli proteins and inhibits the transcriptional activity of Gli2, while
  PKA prohibits the accumulation of full-length Gli2 (GliFL) in the cilium. All of
  these events ensure silencing of the Hh pathway without the ligand.B. The Hh ligand
  binds to its receptor Ptch1 and co-receptors Boc/Cdon. Ptch1 is internalized with
  Hh, relieving the inhibition on Smo. Smo accumulates in the ciliary membrane through
  both lateral transport and the secretory pathways. Phosphorylation of Smo, for instance,
  at the EvC zone in osteoblasts leads to its dimerization and activation. This in
  turn abrogates PKA function and promotes the movement of Sufu-Gli2/3 complexes and
  Kif7 to the ciliary tip and perhaps dissociation of Gli2/3 from Sufu in this process.
  Kif7 also facilitates the trafficking of Gli2/3 into the cilium (for example, in
  chondrocytes). Accumulation of Gli2/3 at the ciliary tip is associated with the
  production of Gli activators (GliA), which are derived from the full-length Gli
  proteins.Accumulation of GliA to the nucleus enables activation of Hh target genes
  such as Ptch1, Gli1 and Hhip1.
