caption: Schematic of the enhanced mathematical model used to represent the Gq-mediated
  calcium signaling pathway. Solid arrows represent either translocation or conversion
  reactions, while dashed lines represent enzymatic reactions. L = ligand (ligand),
  R = receptor, p = phosphorylated, G* = activated Gqprotein, PLC* = activated phospholipase
  C, PIP2 = Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, IP3 = inositol triphosphate, deg
  = degradation, IP3R = “open” IP3 receptor, IP3R(i) = inactivated IP3R, Ca2+(ER)
  = endoplasmic reticulum calcium. Release of calcium from the ER is mediated by the
  IP3Rs; the fraction of “open” IP3Rs dictates the amount of calcium released from
  the ER.
