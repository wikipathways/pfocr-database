caption: Genetic end product inhibition model of BrsR-dependent, natural competence
  stimulation. The proximal ComRS early competence regulatory system triggers the
  production of ComX proteins, which are exceptionally labile because of their efficient
  degradation by the Clp protease. When the BrsRM LRS is activated, positive feedback
  autoregulation results in a rapid increase in BrsR abundance, triggering the moonlighting
  anti-adaptor ability of BrsR to form BrsR–ComX heteromeric complexes that antagonize
  the Clp-dependent proteolysis of ComX. This substantially increases the half-life
  of ComX, resulting in ComX accumulation, increased ComX-dependent transcription
  of late competence genes, and ultimately, higher levels of natural competence. A
  functionally diverse set of late competence enzymes and structural proteins, such
  as DprA, ComYA, SsbB, etc., all have moonlighting adaptor abilities mediated by
  heteromeric complex formation with BrsR. Consequently, after the late competence
  proteins have been produced, the large number of newly synthesized BrsR-binding
  partners shifts the BrsR-binding equilibrium to disfavor ComX interactions and instead
  promote the creation of various BrsR–late competence protein heteromeric complexes.
  The resulting unbound ComX then reverts back to its basal state of low intrinsic
  stability, ending the production of nascent late competence proteins. In addition,
  BrsR–late competence protein heteromeric complexes deplete BrsR levels in the cell
  by antagonizing BrsR-positive feedback autoregulation of the brsRM operon, as well
  as by serving as adaptor proteins to stimulate the Clp-dependent degradation of
  extant BrsR proteins. The depletion of BrsR triggered by the terminal products of
  the competence genetic pathway resets the regulatory circuit, allowing for subsequent
  rounds of BrsR-dependent competence stimulation. This figure was partially created
