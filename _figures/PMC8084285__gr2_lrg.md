caption: A. The structure composition of COVID19. B. The S glycoprotein of the newly
  discovered SARS-CoV2 is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2, and is commonly represented
  as a sword-like spike. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) model of this glycoprotein reveals
  how the subunits comprise different regions that are fundamental to the infection
  process. S1 and S2 are linked together by a polybasic amino acid bridge, which may
  be necessary for studying viral targeting. C. Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Entry.
  D. This pathway overview the coronavirus replication cycle. The figure depicts viral
  development from initial binding and release of the viral genome to eventual exocytosis
  of the mature virion.
