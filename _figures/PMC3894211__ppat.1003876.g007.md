  formation in the organelle, this oxidation transfers reducing equivalents into the
  mtETC (QH2). OAA may leave the mitochondrion, thus completing a parasite-specific
  form of a malate shuttle, or be converted to citrate as part of canonical TCA metabolism.
  Deletion of pepc leads to an imbalance in redox metabolism in both cytosol and presumably
  also mitochondrion. D10Δpepc apparently adapted to this with increased generation
  of glycerol 3-phosphate with concomitant NADH oxidation, thus compensating partially
  for the loss of downstream generation of NAD+ through MDH. Increased flux through
  oxidative PPP is a mechanism for generating NADPH which may be compensating for
  the reduced flux through TCA metabolism and therefore a reduced generation of NADPH
  at the IDH step in D10Δpepc(purple boxes). The reduction in flux to lactate in D10Δpepc
  reflects the severely reduced growth phenotype of D10Δpepc. The flux from glutamine
  via glutamate to α-ketoglutarate and, within the mitochondrion, to succinate and,
  at an apparently lower flux, to fumarate and malate is shown, with α-ketoglutarate
  as an additional entry point into TCA metabolism. The flux through these metabolites
  is lower in D10Δpepc compared with D10, reflecting the general growth defect of
  D10Δpepc and also its reduced consumption of glutamine, although the pathway in
  which the carbon skeleton is incorporated is not dramatically affected.
