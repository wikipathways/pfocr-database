caption: TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC isoform expression and activation. The major isoforms
  of Trk receptors are the result of alternative splicing. A, activation of TrkA-I
  (neuronal) or TrkA-II (nonneuronal) isoforms by NGF leads to TrkA activation and
  signaling, ultimately resulting in survival and neuronal differentiation. In the
  absence of ligand, alternative pathways are activated leading to apoptosis. The
  TrkA-III isoform is constitutively active, ligand independent, and promotes survival
  mainly through the PI3K-AKT pathway. B, there are two full-length TrkB isoforms
  containing an intact kinase domain, and they are activated in neuroblastomas by
  endogenous expression of BDNF. There are at least two major subtypes of truncated,
  kinase-deficient TrkB receptor. One is truncated just beyond the transmembrane domain
  (TrkB-T1), and the other is slightly longer and includes the SHC binding site (TrkB-SHC).
  Both contain the ligand binding site, so they may inhibit activation either by competing
  for ligand binding or by forming functionally inactive heterodimers with full-length
  TrkB. C, there are two major kinase-active TrkC isoforms that have different C-termini.
  Signaling from exogenous NT3 promotes survival and differentiation. There are at
  least four truncated isoforms that lack an intact kinase domain, although the isoform
  TrkC-T1 is predominant. All are thought to function as decoy receptors by mechanisms
  similar to the truncated TrkB receptors.
