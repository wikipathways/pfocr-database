caption: Microglial regulation of neuronal networks and CNS homeostasis. By playing
  a phagocytic role, microglia engulf dead or degenerated neurons via TAM receptor-mediated
  recognition of GAS6-opsonised cells. Microglia control synaptic plasticity by downregulating
  AMPA receptor activity through ROS secretion and by modulating BDNF/Trk receptor
  pathways. Beyond this, microglia can strip synapses through Cx3cr1-Cx3cl1 interactions
  and microglial major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) []. They can also affect
  neuronal circuitry via interacting with astrocytes through the TNF-mediated pathway,
  which releases glutamate and ATP from astrocytes.
