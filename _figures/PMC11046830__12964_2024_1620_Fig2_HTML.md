caption: Mechanism of glycocalyx degradation in LPS or septic conditions. Mechanisms
  of intravascular coagulation in LPS or septic conditions. In LPS or septic conditions,
  anticoagulant and coagulant balance in the intravascular environment can be disrupted
  by the disruption of endothelial glycocalyx, down-regulation of endothelial thrombomodulin,
  and decline of plasma anticoagulant proteins such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor
  (TFPI) and antithrombin. Additionally, activated endothelial cells (ECs) and leukocytes
  release tissue factor (TF) into the bloodstream, triggering intravascular coagulation.
  Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) also contribute a plethora of proteins that
  participate in coagulation. In conditions induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or
  sepsis, fibrinolysis inhibitors such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)
  and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) are up-regulated, further
  hindering the fibrinolytic process and potentially leading to disseminated intravascular
  coagulation (DIC). Recombinant thrombomodulin (rTM) and antithrombin gamma (rAT)
  represent potential therapeutic agents that could rebalance anticoagulant and coagulant
  activity in LPS or septic conditions. Moreover, the upregulation of adhesion factors
  promotes ECs to secrete von Willebrand factor (vWf), which in turn recruits platelets
  to aid in the repair of damaged ECs. However, shedding of endothelial protein C
  receptor (EPCR) from ECs results in impaired conversion of protein C to activated
  protein C (APC), further complicating the coagulation imbalance in these conditions
