caption: (A) Free p65 can protect against TNF-α-induced apoptosis in the absence of
  IKK activity. IKK1/2−/− MEFs transduced with LV-GFP or LV-GFP-p65 were treated with
  TNF-α, 48 h after transduction. Cell survival was estimated by staining the cells
  with crystal violet 48 h after TNF-α treatment. (B) Subcellular localization of
  GFP-p65. Live IKK1/2−/− cells transduced with LV-GFP or LV-GFP-p65 were imaged at
  ×60 magnification by using a deconvolution microscope. (C) Model based on our studies.
  Cytokines such as TNF-α and interleukin-1 primarily employ IKK2, and lymphotoxin
  β (LTβ) and RANK ligand (RANKL) use IKK1 to activate NF-κB. Unlike these stimuli,
  DoxR can activate NF-κB in an IKK1- and IKK2-independent manner. Despite their different
  origins, all of the pathways of NF-κB activation are blocked by proteasome inhibitors.
  Based on data presented in this report, functional activation by p65/p50 complexes
  (shown in red) generated after TNF-α signaling (A) or DoxR induction (Fig. ) do
  not require further modification by IKK1 or IKK2.
