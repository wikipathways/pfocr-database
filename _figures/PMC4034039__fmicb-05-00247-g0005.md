caption: Proposed lignin degradation pathway in C. necator H16. Pathways and reactions
  with black solid lines have complete genes/enzymes identified in C. necator H16,
  while the red lines indicate those not completely identified. Genes encoding enzymes
  for metabolic reactions are bold red font.
