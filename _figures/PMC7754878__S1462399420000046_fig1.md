caption: The DNA damage signalling pathway. Accumulation of DNA damage and replication
  stress leads to activation of ATM- and ATR-dependent signalling pathways mediated
  through the CHK2 and CHK1 effector kinases, respectively. Phosphorylation of the
  CDC25 phosphatases (leading to inactivation or ubiquitylation-dependent degradation)
  or phosphorylation-dependent stabilisation of the p53 tumour suppressor protein
  ultimately leads to cell-cycle arrest at either the G2M or G1S checkpoints, respectively
  allowing for DNA damage repair. WEE1 is also a target of CHK1 kinase activity, leading
  to G2/M checkpoint activation.
