caption: 'Schematic diagram of this study: the primary mechanism of Iguratimod pretreatment
  ameliorating myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Specifically, the expression
  of COX2 in cardiac fibroblasts was elevated after cardiac I/R, leading to the upregulation
  and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Activated caspase-1 cut GSDMD into GSDMD-N,
  which further executed pyroptosis. Additionally, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 were also
  cleaved by activated caspase-1 and subsequently their mature forms were released
  into extracellular region and triggered amounts of inflammatory cells infiltration
  in the cardiac tissue, causing inflammatory reperfusion injury. Iguratimod reduced
  inflammatory cytokines secretion and cardiac inflammation response through inhibiting
  pyroptosis of cardiac fibroblasts via acting on COX2/NLRP3 signaling pathway, eventually
  improving myocardial I/R injury. I/R, ischemia/reperfusion.'
