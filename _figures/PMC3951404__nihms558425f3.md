caption: 'STAT-5 has important roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation.
  Normally, the cytoplasmic forms of STAT-5 are phosphorylated upon stimulation with
  cytokines, such as GM-CSF and IL-6. The activated form of STAT-5 translocates into
  the nucleus to turn on downstream genes, such as PPARγ. Upon HPV infection, HPV
  activates STAT-5 in the absence of exogenous cytokines. The phosphorylated STAT-5
  induces increased levels of PPARγ in HPV-positive cells, which activates the ATM
  DNA damage pathway. The ATM DNA damage is necessary for HPV genome amplification.
  E7 induces activation of ATM, which then turns on downstream effectors, such as
  BRCA1, CHK2 and p53, leading to cell cycle arrest and HPV amplification.P: Phosphate.'
