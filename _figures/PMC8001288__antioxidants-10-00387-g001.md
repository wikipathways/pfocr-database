caption: 'Platelet activation following exposure to collagen at the injury site and
  the production of free radicals. Protein tyrosine-phosphatases (PTPs) are the primary
  targets of ROS which, in turn, drive the upregulation of GPVI signaling. This event
  results in the overstimulation of platelets, inducing cytosolic calcium mobilization
  and the release of proaggregating factors from granules. Due to endothelial dysfunction,
  uncoupled eNOS uncoupling and NOX activation lead to the overproduction of ROS and
  RNS which are able to interact with platelets through the ADP receptor, triggering
  the same intracellular signaling pathway. Furthermore, nitrogen peroxide triggers
  the activation of fibrinogen and the stabilization of the fibrin clot. Thus, endothelial
  dysfunction and platelet activation in primary hemostasis, both consequences of
  a pro-oxidant state, converge and amplify each other, causing important prothrombotic
  effects. AA: Arachidonic Acid; COX-1: Cyclooxygenase-1; GP Ib: glycoprotein Ib;
