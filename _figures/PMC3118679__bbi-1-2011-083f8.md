caption: Overall results depicted in the networks of AA and glucose transporters and
  mTOR, Jak2-Stat5, insulin, and AMPK signaling with log2 fold change at 240 relative
  to −15 d postpartum. The overall pathway was built using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  software. Grey-shaded objects denote measured genes with not significant change,
  red-shaded object denote up-regulation, and green-shaded objects down-regulation
  in expression at the considered days relative to −15 days in milk. Arrow denote
  relationships (P = phosphorylation, PP = protein-protein interaction, PR = protein-RNA
  interaction, E = effect on expression, A = activation). The expression of LALBA
  has been previously measured in the same samples. Dotted lines denote indirect effect.
  See caption for  for detailed explanation.
