caption: Diagram of major NF-κB activation mechanisms. There are two primary mechanisms
  for NF-κB activation known as the “classic” and “alternate” pathways. Both can be
  initiated by a variety of membrane proximal signaling events which converge on the
  IκB kinase (IKK) complex or the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) complex. See text for
  further details. Of importance to this study is that activation through the classic
  pathway involves IκB phosphorylation and degradation, followed by nuclear accumulation
  of RelA/p50; whereas activation through the alternate pathway is characterized by
  processing of p100 to p52 with the nuclear accumulation of RelB/p52.
