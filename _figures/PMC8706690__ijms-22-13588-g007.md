caption: A model for sucrose-promoted skotomorphogenesis in the dark. The model illustrates
  the mechanisms whereby exogenously supplied sugar enhances brassinosteroid (BR)
  biosynthesis [], the interaction between BRI1 and BAK1 [], and the activation of
  the TOR-S6K2 pathway, resulting in the inhibition of GSK3 kinases and the enhancement
  of BIN2 degradation. Inactivation of BIN2 and its homologs leads to the accumulation
  of BZR1/2 for transcriptional regulation (including the upregulated expression of
  CESA genes []) and the enhancement of CESA complex activity [] for cellulose synthesis,
  which may synergistically promote skotomorphogenesis in the dark.
