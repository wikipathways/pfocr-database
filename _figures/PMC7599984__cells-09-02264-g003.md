caption: TGF-β family signaling pathway. Schematic representation of the TGF-β family
  signaling pathway, displaying the TGF-β and BMP pathway. (Left side) TGF-β signaling
  is activated by TGF-β ligand binding to the TGF-β receptor complex composed out
  of type I and type II family receptors. SMAD2 and SMAD3 (R-SMADs) bind to the intracellular
  domain of the receptor complex with the aid of Smad Anchor for Receptor Activation
  (SARA). Type I receptor then phosphorylates the R-SMADs which causes them to dissociate
  from the receptor complex. The R-SMADs form separately a complex with co-SMAD4 and
  translocate to the nucleus to bind to the transcriptional activator CREB-binding
  protein (CBP) to initiate target gene expression. Inhibitory Smads (I-SMADs) can
  repress the R-SMADs from binding to co-SMAD4. (Right side) BMP signaling is activated
  by BMP ligand binding to the BMP receptor complex composed out of type I and type
  II family receptors. SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD8 (R-SMADs) bind to the intracellular
  domain of the receptor complex. Type I receptor phosphorylates the R-SMADs which
  causes them to dissociate from the receptor complex. The R-SMADs form separately
  a complex with co-SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus to bind to the transcriptional
  activator CREB-binding protein (CBP) to initiate target gene expression. Inhibitory
  Smads (I-SMADs) can repress the R-SMADs from binding to co-SMAD4.
