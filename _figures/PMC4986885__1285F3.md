caption: Model for SRSF1's roles in transformation in breast cancer. Increased expression
  of SRFS1 in human tumors results from several distinct types of alterations, such
  as amplification of the Chr. 17q23 amplicon, transcriptional regulation of SRFS1
  downstream from MYC, or splicing regulation of SRSF1 pre-mRNA by Sam68. Up-regulation
  of SRSF1 promotes splicing changes in target genes involved in apoptosis, cell motility,
  proliferation, and other cellular functions. SRSF1 activates splicing by binding
  to an exonic motif recognized by its RRM1. SRSF1 overexpression promotes expression
  of anti-apoptotic isoforms unable to interact with pro-apoptotic factors, or that
  inhibit the action of pro-apoptotic factors, such as MYC or members of the Bcl-2
  family. In parallel, SRSF1 overexpression promotes expression of isoforms that stimulate
  translation and cell proliferation by increasing phosphorylation of translation
  activators, such as S6 or eIF4E, or by inhibiting translational repressors, such
  as 4EBP1. In addition, MYC can cooperate with SRSF1 in transformation, and has a
  synergistic effect in the activation of the eIF4E pathway. By increasing proliferation
  and decreasing apoptosis, SRSF1 promotes cellular transformation in mammary epithelial
  cells.
