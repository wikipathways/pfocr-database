caption: Coronaviruses induced neural neuro-inflammation was mediated via production
  of some cytokine and chemokine such as Interleukin (IL)-1,6,12,18,36 and Tumor Necrosis
  Factor alpha(TNF-α) and Interferon alpha(IFN-α) and Tumor Growth Factor beta(TGF-β)
  and some proteins such as chemokine chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2) such as activation,
  monocyte chemoattractant protein-1(MCP-1). All this biomarkers cause initiation
  of inflammatory signaling in astrocyte and neuron which led to activation of extrinsic
  pathway of apoptosis in neuronal cell and lead neurodegeneration
