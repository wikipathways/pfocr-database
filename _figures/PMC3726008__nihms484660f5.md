caption: Dose-dependent MeHg-induced gene expression alterations within the Wnt-signaling
  pathway. The degree of impact by MeHg is displayed in genes identified to be significantly
  altered by MeHg (ANOVA, P<0.0005) and linked with the Wnt Signaling Pathway ().
  Each gene is color coded based on fold change of response (log 2 scale) for each
  gene with 1, 4, and 6 mg/kg BW MeHg, respectively. Only fold change values associated
  with 8 h exposure data are displayed. Fold change values are not present for genes
  identified to be not significantly altered by MeHg. Pathways were generated via
  the Wnt-signaling pathway (http://www.genome.jp/) with modifications, including
  the addition of genes, Wnt5a and Celsr1 to the Non-Canonical Wnt-signaling pathway
  due to recent studies suggesting an important role in activation of this pathway
  (; , ; ; ; ). The Wnt-signaling pathway represented the most enriched KEGG pathway
  within genes significantly altered by MeHg.
