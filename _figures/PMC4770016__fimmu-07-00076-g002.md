caption: ITK acts as a rheostat for the TCR signaling pathway. While the expression
  of genes like CD69 and IL-2 is not directly proportional to the signaling input
  at the TCR, other genes like IRF4 have a graded response where expression continues
  to increase with higher affinity TCR stimulation. High-affinity antigens increase
  the duration of TCR binding, increasing the stability of activated Lck and Zap70,
  which amplifies downstream signaling by creating a larger pool of activated LAT
  signaling complexes. This creates a larger pool of activated ITK, represented here
  for simplification without the other signaling components in the pathway. We propose
  that the calcium signaling pathway is uniquely sensitive to ITK and can provide
  a mechanism for graded IRF4 expression.
