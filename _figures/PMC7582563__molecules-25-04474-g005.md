caption: Overview of the reconstructed metabolic pathway of 7′N-5F-ADB based on the
  results from all investigated models. The progress of phase I metabolism is represented
  and the two major metabolites detected in all ZF larvae exposed to 7′N-5F-ADB, which
  were M5 and M13, are highlighted by a green and yellow box, respectively. Resulting
  phase II metabolites are displayed in blue. a Major metabolites in human samples;
  b major metabolites in microinjected ZF larvae; c major metabolites in HepaRG cells.
  A schematic representation of the reconstructed pathway from all three models can
  be found in .
