caption: A) In yeasts, a self-organizing polarity circuit centered on Cdc42 assembles
  a polarity site via positive feedback, and makes it mobile via negative feedback
  (R, repressor). Pheromone sensing by GPCRs impacts Cdc42 location primarily by a
  single pathway that recruits GEF to sites with bound receptors. Cdc42 orients actin
  cables that deliver vesicles, which both perturb Cdc42 (enhancing mobility) and
  deliver new receptors (enabling local sensing of pheromone). B) In motile cells,
  complex excitable signaling and cytoskeletal circuits (F, self-reinforcing “front”
  factors; R, repressors of F that can create local “refractory” state) generate spontaneous
  locomotion. GPCR sensing displays adaptation and has been simplified as a Local
  Excitation/Global Inhibition (LEGI) incoherent feedforward loop (E, excitation factors;
  I, inhibition factors; RR, response regulators that integrate E and I). A memory
  module, also simplified as an incoherent feedforward loop (factors as in LEGI),
  endows cells with directional persistence. C) Generalized roles for positive feedback
  in generating a polarized front, and for negative feedback in destabilizing the
  position of the front, enabling relocation to track a gradient.
