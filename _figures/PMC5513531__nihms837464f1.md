caption: 'Epigenetic regulation plays a significant role in maintaining the pluripotent
  state of PSCs. For example, histone methylation and acetylation is affected by specific
  metabolites. Stem cells also show increased abundance of unsaturated metabolites
  and inhibition of the eicosanoid pathway can assist in maintenance of pluripotency.
  During differentiation, metabolism shifts from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation
  or fatty acid oxidation accompanied by a reduction in unsaturated metabolites. Metabolic
  pathway regulation can drive maturation of hPSC-CMs and hPSC-derived hepatocytes.
