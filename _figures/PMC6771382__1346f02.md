caption: Summary of HR processes and HR proteins reported for sumoylation and interacting
  with SUMO. The figure depicts an overview of recombinational repair of DSBs with
  only the budding yeast proteins shown for simplicity. Recombinational repair is
  initiated by a two-step 5′ end resection process to generate 3′ end ssDNA, which
  can be coated by RPA. Several HR mediator proteins can then help to replace RPA
  with the Rad51 recombinase. With the assistance of Rad54, the Rad51-ssDNA filament
  can pair and invade donor DNA, leading to the formation of nascent D-loop structures.
  New DNA synthesis by Polδ with the help of its cofactor PCNA can extend the D-loop
  structures, which can be subsequently processed in two different ways. In the SDSA
  pathway, DNA helicases, such as Srs2, Sgs1, and Mph1, can remove ssDNA from donor
  DNA, leading to noncrossover outcomes. Alternatively, second end capture can lead
  to the formation of Holliday junction (HJ) structures. These structures can be processed
  by the dissolution enzymes (Sgs1–Top3–Rmi1) to generate exclusively noncrossover
  products or by the resolution nucleases (Mus81–Mms4, Yen1, and Slx1/4) to produce
  both noncrossover and crossover products. Note that the Srs2 helicase plays multiple
  roles during DSB repair, and only its role in disfavoring D-loop formation is depicted
  here for simplicity (see the text for details). Proteins reported to be sumoylated
  are in red and those reported to contain SIMs are boxed in orange.
