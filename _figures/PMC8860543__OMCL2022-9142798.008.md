caption: 'Proposed model for the FOXO1/LepRb pathway to induce β cell dysfunction
  in the T2MD with inflammatory infiltration. Normally, leptin regulates the insulin
  metabolism of β cells through the JAK/STAT3 pathway. In the obesity state, phosphorylated
  FOXO1 is reduced by inflammatory factor TNF-α, and dephosphorylated FOXO1 is translocated
  into the nucleus to regulate transcription of LepRb gene. FOXO1 transcriptionally
  reduce LepRb via directly binding to the LepRb promoter as a negative regulator,
  thereby inhibiting the expression of LepRb gene and reducing the leptin signaling
  pathway, and ultimately induced leptin resistance and β cell dysfunction in T2MD.
  RIP: receptor-interacting protein.'
