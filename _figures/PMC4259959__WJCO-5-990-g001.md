caption: 'The biology of the estrogen receptor and a schematic representation of the
  key mechanisms of endocrine resistance. A: Estrogen induces gene regulation via
  the “classical” pathway. Estrogen passively diffuses through cell membranes and
  binds to the estrogen receptor (ER), inducing receptor dimerization. This complex
  recruits co-activators (CoA) and binds regions of DNA known as estrogen response
  elements (EREs), promoting transcription. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) negatively
  regulate ER activity by reducing circulating estrogen levels; B: The ER can also
  cooperate with other transcription factors (TFs) and regulate the transcription
  of genes not harbouring EREs via the “non-classical” pathway; C: ER strictly interacts
  with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) via their downstream effectors. ER can, in
  fact, be directly phosphorylated and activated, the final result being gene expression
  and a cascade of second intracellular effectors (the non-nuclear activity of ER);
  D: This strict and bi-directional crosstalk between ER and RTKs and downstream effectors
  is responsible for endocrine resistance; E: In breast cancer cells, SERMs [such
  as tamoxifen (Tam)] bind ER and induce the recruitment of co-repressors (CoR) that
  negatively regulate the activity of ER. Mutated forms of ER are able to enhance
  gene expression in spite of the presence of Tam.'
