caption: (a) Vitamin D can play a role in reducing inflammation through the reduction
  in C-reactive protein (CRP), which is an acute phase protein, subsequently leading
  to a reduction in inflammation; (b) Vitamin D plays a role in reducing the expression
  of tissue factor (TF) through reducing the expression of microRNA-346 (Mir-346),
  which will reduce thrombosis; (c) Vitamin D, through the MAP kinase 38 signaling
  pathway, reduces the expression of inflammatory factors IL6 and tumor necrosis factor
  α (TNF-α), subsequently reducing inflammation
