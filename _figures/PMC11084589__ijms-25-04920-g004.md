caption: 'Possible targeting pathway of ABA in PD. After binding with LANCL2, ABA
  regulates the functional status of microglia and improves the inflammatory response
  by activating the PPAR-γ pathway. In addition, after ABA, it may also affect the
  activation of AMPK and NF-κB pathways, co-regulate the state of microglia and the
  level of inflammation with PPAR-γ, and alleviate the occurrence and development
  of PD. ABA: abscisic acid; LANCL2: LanC like glutathione S-transferase 2 Gene; TLR:
  toll-like receptor; MyD88: myeloid differentiation primary response 88; NF-κB: nuclear
  factor-κB; PGC-1α:peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator-1alpha;
  CaMKK2: calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-2; IκB: ikappaB; AMPK: AMP-activated
  protein kinase; PPAR-γ: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ'
