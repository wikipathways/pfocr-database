caption: 'The pathways of ceramide metabolism examined in relation to insulin sensitivity.
  A: De novo synthesis. B: Deacylation. C: Phosphorylation of sphingosine (the work
  of Bruce et al. []). D: Hydrolysis of sphingomyelin. E: Conversion to glucosylceramide.
  F: Phosphorylation. De novo synthesis pathway is distinguished since it supplies
  all pathways of sphingolipid metabolism with ceramide.'
