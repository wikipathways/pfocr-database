caption: Mechanisms by which the miRNA-23b/27b/24-1 cluster inhibits HSC activation.
  ① Gremlin1 expression, down-regulation, synthesis, secretion, and related functions.
  ② LOX expression, down-regulation, synthesis, secretion, and ECM crosslinking. ③
  ITG2/5 expression, down-regulation, synthesis, secretion, and binding with collagens.
  ④ TGF-β2 expression, down-regulation, synthesis, secretion, and promotion of the
  TGF-β signaling pathway. ⑤ CTGF expression, synthesis, secretion, and related functions.
  ⑥ TIMP1 expression, synthesis, secretion, and inhibiting MMP expression. ⑦ Collagen
  expression, synthesis, secretion, and degradation. BMPR, bone morphogenetic protein
  receptor; CTGFR, connective tissue growth factor receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase.
