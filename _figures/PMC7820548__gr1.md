caption: Simplified outline of the Calvin-Benson-Basshmam (CBB) cycle with selected
  key enzymes indicated (a) and corresponding genetic constructs used in the present
  study (b). The CBB cycle is represented by black color and black lines while the
  inserted ethanol pathway by blue color and blue lines (a). The overexpressed enzymes
  are written in bold form and intermediates using abbreviations; 3PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate;
  G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  SBP, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; S7P, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate;
  Xu5P, xylulose-5-phosphate; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate; Ru5P, ribulose-5-phosphate;
  RuBP, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Enzymes; FBA, aldolase; FBP/SBPase, fructose-1,6/sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase;
  TK, transketolase; PDC, pyruvate carboxylase; ADH, alcohol dehydroge. The expression
  constructs were inserted in the plasmid vector pPMQAK1 (b). PnrsB and PpsbA2 represent
  the promoters and B0015 the terminator used. The ethanol pathway includes the genes
  pyruvate carboxylase (pdc) originated from Zymomonas mobilis and alcohol dehydrogenase
  (adh) from Synechocystis PCC 6803. The selected, overexpressed CBB genes were transketolase
  (tktA), aldosase (fbaA), and FBP/SBPase (70glpX). tktA and fbaA are the native genes
  of Synechocystis PCC 6803 while 70glpX is the homologue from the strain Synechococcus
  PCC 7002. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend,
