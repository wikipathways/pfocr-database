caption: The role of HERV in the pathogenesis of ALS. HERV-K activity is inhibited
  by nuclear TDP-43. In ALS patients, TDP-43 is deposited in the cytoplasm of neurons
  and glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia, and HERV-K is derepressed in
  neurons and glial cells. The cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 can be resolved
  by ASRGL1; however, HML-2 RNA induces antisense silencing of ASRGL1, thereby leading
  to the cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 [222]. HERV-K forms dsDNA by reverse transcription,
  and the dsDNA enters the cytoplasm, activates the cGAS-STING pathway, triggers an
  immune response, and releases inflammatory factors and other substances that act
  on neighboring neurons or glial cells, ultimately leading to neuronal apoptosis
  [115, 220, 221]. TDP-43 deposition in neurons leads to the release of mitochondrial
  DNA [116], while the toxic effects of glial cells can also lead to the release of
  DNA fragments from DNA damage [110, 224]. Both events activate the cGAS-STING signaling
  pathway through cytoplasmic DNA receptors, triggering an innate immune response.
  In addition, TDP-43 may inhibit the formation of RISC by inhibiting Dicer-2 activity
  in neurons, thereby reducing the inhibitory effect of RISC on HERV-K [220]. In astrocytes,
  HERV-K can translate into CTXLP, which has neurotoxic effects [225]
