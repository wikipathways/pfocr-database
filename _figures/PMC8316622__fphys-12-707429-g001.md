caption: 'The biogenesis of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Exosomes and ectosomes are
  two types of EVs secreted by cells. Exosomes (~30–200 nm in diameter) originate
  from the endosomal pathway and are secreted by the fusion of multivesicular bodies
  (MVBs) with the plasma membrane. Ectosomes (size range ~50–500 nm) are generated
  by the direct outward budding of the plasma membrane. The budding of EVs involves
  a variety of mechanisms, and is a combination of one or more of the following mechanisms:
  endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) complex, neutral sphingomyelinase
  2 (nSMase2) generating ceramide, GTPase Ral, and the Rho family. However, specific
  biogenesis mechanisms are not yet clearly known. EVs are highly heterogeneous population.
  The cargos of EVs contain different types of cell surface proteins, intracellular
  protein, genetic materials [such as DNAs, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and miRNAs], and
  lipid.'
