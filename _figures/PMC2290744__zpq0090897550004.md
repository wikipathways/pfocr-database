caption: Proposed model of the interaction between the Arabidopsis circadian clock
  and N-assimilatory pathway. Arrows indicate influences that affect the function
  of the two processes. The black arrow labeled “Clock regulation of N-assimilation”
  illustrates that clock function would affect N-assimilation. This influence is at
  least partly due to the direct regulatory role of CCA1 on N-assimilation. The gray
  arrow labeled “N-nutrient input” illustrates that N-assimilation would influence
  clock function through downstream metabolites such as Glu, Gln, and possibly other
  N-metabolites.
papertitle: Systems approach identifies an organic nitrogen-responsive gene network
  that is regulated by the master clock control gene CCA1.
