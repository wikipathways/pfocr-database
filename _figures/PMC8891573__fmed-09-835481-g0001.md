caption: Schematic representation of pathways of dimethylarginine biosynthesis and
  metabolism. Dimethylarginines are formed during (di-)methylation of protein-bound
  L-arginine residues by a family of protein arginine N-methyltransferases (PRMTs).
  Free ADMA and SDMA are released during physiological hydrolytic protein turnover.
  Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) inhibits nitric oxide (NO) synthesis from L-arginine,
  whilst symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) does not directly interfere with NO synthase
  activity. ADMA is metabolically degraded to L-citrulline and dimethylamine by either
  of two isoforms of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). Both ADMA and
  SDMA can be cleaved by alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase-2 (AGXT2); this enzyme
  is the major pathway of SDMA clearance. Minor amounts of both ADMA and SDMA can
  also be excreted into the urine.
