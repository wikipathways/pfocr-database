caption: There are two major theories concerning the role of cation-chloride cotransporters
  (CCCs) in chronic pain, and more specifically in touch-evoked pain (allodynia).
  Under normal conditions (part a), the activation of Aβ fibres, the myelinated fibres
  responsible for light touch sensation, leads to primary afferent depolarization
  in C fibres and consequent presynaptic shunting inhibition of pain-conducting C
  fibres by dorsal horn GABAergic interneurons. This requires the expression of Na+–K+–2Cl−
  cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) C fibre neurons. The inhibition
  blocks the signalling of the C fibres to lamina I projection neurons. Following
  injury, signalling cascades lead to phosphorylation and thereby kinetic activation
  of NKCC1 () in C fibre terminals. This may be linked to an increase in [Cl−]i, potentially
  converting Aβ fibre-mediated inhibition into frank excitation of C fibres and leading
  to activation of pain signalling via lamina I projection neurons. This provides
  a neurophysiological explanation for allodynia. Very recent evidence suggests that
  nociceptive-specific (NS) neurons in the deep laminae of the dorsal horn (lamina
  V) lose KCC2 expression following peripheral nerve injury (PNI), thereby altering
  the response of these neurons to GABA and unmasking an Aβ fibre-mediated input to
  NS neurons, effectively converting them to wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons (part
  b). As in the scenario outlined in part a, this gives the Aβ fibre pathway access
  to pain signalling through feedforward activation of projection neurons in lamina
  I/II. Importantly, conversion of NS neurons to WDR neurons following PNI is reversed
  by positive modulation of KCC2 and this treatment also reduces touch-evoked pain
  in behavioural assays. GABAAR, GABAA receptor.
