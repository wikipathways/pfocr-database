caption: Reconstructing the interactions among different modules of the MAPK pathway.
  Panel (a) shows a simplified representation of the EGF pathway which activates the
  RAF/MEK/ERK MAPK cascade when stimulated by EGF. The conceptual modules of this
  pathway is highlighted in Gray. The communicating intermediates of each module are
  shown in yellow boxes. Panel (b) shows the true interactions among different modules
  of the MAPK pathway. In this figure, the arrowheads represent activation and the
  blunt arrowheads represent inhibition. Panel (c) shows the AUROC and AUPR values
  calculated from the networks which were inferred by BVSA, MRA and SBRA respectively.
  The error bars depict the standard deviations of the corresponding AUROCs.
