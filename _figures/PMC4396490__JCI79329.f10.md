caption: Macrophage priming by IFN-γ and TLR ligands induces transcriptional upregulation
  of TF and proinflammatory interleukins. Activation of the macrophage P2RX7 by ATP
  triggers TRXR-dependent release of TRX, leading to reductive changes of the extracellular
  proteome, as indicated by the extracellular free thiol (SH) groups. The intracellular
  depletion of TRX abolishes regulatory functions of TRX and causes actin remodeling
  and filopodia formation as well as TXNIP-mediated inflammasome assembly and caspase-1
  activation. Active caspase-1 mediates maturation and release of the proinflammatory
  cytokine IL-1β and facilitates activation of calpain, which in turn reverses TF
  retention by filamin (indicated as a red rod on the cytoplasmic side of TF) and
  thereby allows raft-dependent trafficking of TF onto filopodia. Membrane receptors
  TF, integrin β1, and PSGL1 assemble with marker proteins of highly procoagulant
  MPs, γ-actin, and PDI when released from PS-rich filopodia, facilitated by caspase-1
  and resulting in highly procoagulant thromboinflammatory MPs. Key pharmacological
  inhibitors used here are placed next to their targets to indicate where the thromboinflammatory
  pathway is inhibited.
