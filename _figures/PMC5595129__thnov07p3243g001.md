caption: An overview of roles of miRNAs as a regulator of DDR in response to radiation
  in cancers. When SSB or DSB occurs, DNA damage repair pathway is initiated. This
  pathway contains a cascade of components including sensors (MRN and PAPR-1), transducers
  (ATM and ATR) and effectors (DNA-PK, RAD51 and BRCA1/2), in order to achieve DNA
  damage repair through NHEJ and HR pathways. Multiple miRNAs play important roles
  in up-regulating or down-regulating these biological processes in cancer radiation
  response. ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related

  joining; PARP-1, Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1; SSB, single-strand breaks. '⊣'
  indicates down-regulation and '⟶' indicates up-regulation.
