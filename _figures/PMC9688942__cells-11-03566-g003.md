caption: Proposed roles of cofilin-2 in cardiac hypertrophy. Neurohumoral factors
  (e.g., Ang II, ET 1 and leptin) lead to cofilin-2 phosphorylation through the RhoA/ROCK/LIMK
  signaling pathway. Phosphorylated cofilin-2 can lead to F-actin accumulation, which
  may subsequently contribute to cardiac hypertrophy through disrupting autophagy.
  In addition, it promotes the activation of ERK1/2 and p38, which contributes to
  the inhibition of autophagy and the reactivation of hypertrophy-related genes, which
  subsequently cause cardiac hypertrophy.
