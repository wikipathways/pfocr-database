caption: A. Top1-dependent 2–5 bp deletion mutagenesis can occur following Top1 incision
  at a ribonucleotide incorporated into repetitive DNA during leading strand synthesis
  by Pol ε. The steps of this pathway are described in detail in .B. DNA breaks are
  produced when Top1 incises unrepaired ribonucleotides. In the absence of RER, Top1
  cleavage at a ribonucleotide generates a DNA nick (single strand break; SSB) containing
  a 2′−3′-cyclic phosphate end (red triangle). If this is followed by cleavage by
  Top1 on the opposite DNA strand in close proximity to the first cleavage, this leads
  to formation of a double strand break (DSB). The presence of a covalently-linked
  Top1 is prone to intermolecular ligation with other DNA ends. Alternatively, the
  DSB can be repaired by homologous recombination (HR) involving the Rad51 and Rad52
  proteins.C. DNA breaks produced during Top1-processing of unrepaired ribonucleotides
  can lead to recombination and larger structural changes to the chromosomes. Single
  strand breaks (SSBs) can result from spontaneous hydrolysis or Top1-cleavage at
  a ribonucleotide. Double strand breaks (DSBs) can be generated directly or indirectly
  following Top1 cleavage events or conversion of a Top1-induced SSB to a DSB. Genome
  rearrangements that include gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs), loss-of-heterozygosity
  (LOH) and chromosomal translocations have been observed in yeast and mouse cells.
