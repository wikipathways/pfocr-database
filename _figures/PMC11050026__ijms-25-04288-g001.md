caption: 'Early biosynthetic pathway of type B trichothecenes in Fusarium species.
  Green arrows represent the enzymatic reactions of the Tri enzymes, while orange
  arrows denote non-enzymatic reactions. Minor routes are indicated in dotted green
  arrows. Interconversion between two bicyclic metabolites is shown by dotted orange
  arrows. The Tri3 disruptant accumulated higher levels of bicyclic metabolites, isotrichotriol
  and trichotriol, compared with those of the expected precursor, 15-deCAL. Abbreviations:
  TDN, trichodiene; 2-HTDN, 2-hydroxytrichodiene; ITDmol, isotrichodermol; ITD, isotrichodermin;
  15-deCAL, 15-deacetylcalonectrin; CAL, calonectrin; DHC, 7,8-dihydroxycalonectrin;
  NIV, nivalenol; DON, deoxynivalenol; 7-HIT, 7-hydroxyisotrichodermin; 7-H-15-deCAL,
  7-hydroxy-15-deacetylcalonectrin; 7-HCA, 7-hydroxycalonectrin; 8-HIT, 8-hydroxyisotrichodermin;
