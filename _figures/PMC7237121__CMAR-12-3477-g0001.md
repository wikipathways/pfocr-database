caption: 'Mechanism of CDK4/6 inhibitors and possible combined therapy with CDK4/6
  inhibitors. Activation of upstream signaling pathways, such as MAPK, PI3K and ER,
  promotes the formation of cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex, which phosphorylates Rb protein.
  With phosphorylation of Rb, E2F is dissociated from Rb-E2F complex. As a transcription
  factor, released E2F initiates DNA synthesis, resulting in cell cycle progressed
  into S phase from G1 phase. CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib)
  prevent the activation of CDK4/6 to cause cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Combination
  therapeutic strategies mainly focus on blockade of upstream of cyclin D-CDK4/6 signaling,
  including blockade of ER by AIs, fulvestrant and tamoxifen, blockade MAPK by BRAF
  inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib) and MEK inhibitors (cobimetinib and trametinib),
  and blockade of PI3K pathway by alpelisib and everolimus.Abbreviations: CDK, cyclin-dependent
  kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
  ER, estrogen receptor; AI, aromatase inhibitor.'
