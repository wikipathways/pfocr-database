caption: Functional Epistasis Underlying Complex Genetic Epistasis.(A) The known genetic
  epistasis linking six cloned QTL controlling glucosinolate accumulation within Arabidopsis
  is shown. The names of the QTL are shown with lines indicating genetic epistatic
  interactions identified within any of the existing natural Arabidopsis populations.(B)
  The current model of functional epistasis underlying the above genetic epistasis
  is shown. Small arrows show specific enzymes with names showing those enzymes that
  are the mechanistic basis of specific QTL in (A). Metabolic structures show the
  specific metabolites that accumulate from these enzymes. The line arrows show the
  proposed link between a glucosinolate metabolite and the control of transcription
  for the MYB28/MYB29 transcription factors. The double question mark shows that this
  is just one possible connection among many metabolite/gene interactions. The circles
  represent the MYB28/MYB29 proteins with line arrows showing the promoters with which
  these transcription factors interact. These genes encode the enzymes shown by the
  arrows for the metabolic pathway.
