caption: PBR-BuOH suppressed IgE/Ag-mediated allergic responses that are initiated
  by FcεRI signaling pathway. PBR-BuOH suppresses the level of FcεRI subunit mRNA
  expression and inhibits the activation of FcεRI-mediated signaling molecules, including
  Fyn and Syk. The level of p-IκBα and NFκB protein were inhibited by PBR-BuOH. PBR-BuOH
  also inhibited p-Gab, p-PI3K, and p-ERK which are other downstream signaling molecules.
  Red arrow indicates the inhibitory activity by PBR-BuOH through FcεRI-mediated and
  NFκB signaling pathway in IgE/Ag-mediated allergic responses.
