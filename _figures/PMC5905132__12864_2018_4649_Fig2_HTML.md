caption: Two examples of adversarial functional module (AFM) pairs. Each circle represents
  one gene. Edges show annotated PPIs in Reactome among genes in the two functional
  modules. Colors of circles show expression alteration scores. The upper panel shows
  the AFM pair M4-M14. Circles with grey border show genes in the network which participate
  in the pathway “RHO GTPases activates rhotekin and rhophilins”, with PPIs among
  them shown by the wider grey lines. The lower panel show the AFM pair M32-M39. Circles
  with grey border show genes which participate in the pathway “Clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis”. Interactions connecting genes participating in the pathway “Spry regulation
  of FGF signaling” are shown as blue lines, and interactions connecting genes in
  the pathway “EPH-ephrin mediated repulsion of cells” are shown as pink lines
