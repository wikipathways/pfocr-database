caption: 'Proposed model of hPer2 and hp53 interaction and function. Newly synthesized
  hp53, hPer2, and Cry localize in the cytosolic compartment where the Cry/hPer2/CKIε/δ
  (pool I) is formed, and hPer2 is incorporated in one or more complexes that constitutes
  pool II. Pool I: As extensively reviewed, cytosolic hPer2 is phosphorylated by casein
  kinase I ε/δ (CKIε/δ) and initially degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway
  (). Later, Cry accumulates and associates with hPer2/CKIε/δ, and this complex translocates
  to the nucleus, where Cry disrupts the Clock/Bmal1-associated transcriptional complex,
  resulting in inhibition of CRY, PER, and REB-ERVα and derepression of BMAL1 transcription
  and modulation of the expression of other clock-controlled genes (shown as “circadian
  circuit” for simplicity). Pool II: The hPer2 protein associates with cytosolic hp53,
  forming a stable complex () that translocates to the nuclear compartment and keeps
  hp53 in a functionally inactive but stable state, ensuring that basal levels of
  hp53 exist (“priming state”). This heterodimer eventually incorporates Mdm2, forming
  a trimeric and stable Mdm2/hp53/hPer2 complex. In response to, for example, a genotoxic
  stress (labeled as γ-IR in the cartoon), the trimeric complex disassembles by a
  yet-unknown mechanism, which leads to release of hp53 and downstream activation
  of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. An amplification loop exists
  in which hPer2, alone or in association with an unidentified partner, transcriptionally
  activates TP53, further sustaining the hp53-mediated response (boxed in orange).
  Alternatively, cytosolic hp53 enters the nucleus, where it is targeted by Mdm2 and
  either polyubiquitinylated and degraded back into the cytosol or monoubiquitinated
  and translocated to a different compartment, as has been described (for review,
  see ).'
