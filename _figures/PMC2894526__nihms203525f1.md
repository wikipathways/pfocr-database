caption: (A) Non-cleaved trimers of αβγENaC likely represent near-silent channels
  found on the cell surface with Po<0.1 (-). (B) αβγENaC is normally cleaved by furin
  as it transits the biosynthetic pathway and exhibits an intermediate Po (). Furin
  cleaves α twice to release a 26-mer inhibitory peptide (*) and γ is cleaved once
  (, ). (C) Subsequent cleavage of the γ subunit at a site distal to the furin cleavage
  site, releases a second inhibitory peptide (**) and increases the Po to near 1 (,
  , ). Several proteases cleave γ at this distal site (, , ). For review, see (, ).
