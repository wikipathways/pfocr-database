caption: 'Schematic representation of pathway engineering strategies for minimizing
  formation of glycerol as ‘redox’ sink for re-oxidation of NADH generated in biosynthetic
  reactions during anaerobic growth of S. cerevisiae. A: Biosynthetic reactions require
  a net input of ATP and NADPH, while yielding NADH. Ammonium assimilation is the
  key contributor to NADH production, and replacing the NADP+-dependent step by an
  NADH-dependent step, can reduce the NADH production in biosynthetic reactions. B:
  Native glycerol pathway. C: Bypass of NAD+-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase by heterologous non-phosphorylating, NADP+-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GAPN). D: Non-oxidative bypass of NAD+-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase by heterologously expressed phosphoribulokinase and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
  carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). E: Re-oxidation of NADH by A-ALD-expressing strain,
  using exogenous acetate as electron acceptor. F: Re-oxidation of NADH enabled by
  combined expression of heterologously expressed NADH-dependent acetylating acetaldehyde
  dehydrogenase (A-ALD), phosphoketolase and phosphotransacetylase. G: Re-oxidation
  of NADH enabled by combined expression of heterologously expressed A-ALD and pyruvate-formate
  lyase. H: Combined expression of a heterologous NADH-dependent glycerol dehydrogenase
  and the native dihydroxyacetone kinase enables ethanol formation from glycerol when
  combined with strategies D, E, F and/or G.'
