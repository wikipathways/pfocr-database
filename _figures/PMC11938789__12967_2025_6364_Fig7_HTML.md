caption: Proposed model for the role of ZBTB6 in BC proliferation. ARHGAP6 could inhibit
  STAT3 activation and thus subsequent cell survival-related STAT3/Survivin and STAT3/c-Myc
  signaling pathways. In contrast, ZTBT6 can bind to the ARHGAP6 promoter and inhibit
  its transcription, thereby activating STAT3 and the subsequent STAT3/Survivin and
  STAT3/c-Myc signaling pathways, which in turn promotes breast cancer progression
