caption: Some sphingolipid fundamentals. (A) Depictions of sphingomyelin and ceramide.
  The bonds cleaved by SMase C and SMase D are indicated. (B) De novo synthesis of
  sphingomyelin. The first four enzymatic steps of the de novo pathway take place
  at the cytoplasmic face of the ER, the last step at the cytoplasmic face of the
  Golgi complex. Breakdown of cellular sphingomyelin and resynthesis of sphingomyelin
  from ceramide also occur at other locations in the cell. Separate branches of the
  de novo synthetic pathway (not depicted) lead from ceramide to the two major classes
  of glycosphingolipids. (C) Sphingomyelin metabolism. Mammalian cellular enzymes
  are able to catalyze all the steps indicated, except the conversion of sphingomyelin
  to ceramide-1-phosphate. Specific SMase D enzymes that catalyze this step have been
  isolated from C. pseudotuberculosis and from spider venoms. The spider SMase D product
  is ceramide 1,3-cyclic phosphate rather than ceramide-1-phosphate (), adding a further
  nuance, since it is not clear whether the cyclic phosphate is readily metabolized
  by mammalian cellular enzymes. Although the mapped metabolic pathways provide guidance,
  it is still necessary to determine the actual extent and pattern of sphingomyelin
  metabolism for any specific cell type, localization in the cell, and experimental
  condition. CERK, ceramide kinase; LPP, lipid phosphate phosphatase; S1P phosphatase,
  sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase; S1P lyase, sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase. See  for
  a complete discussion of sphingolipid synthesis and degradation.
