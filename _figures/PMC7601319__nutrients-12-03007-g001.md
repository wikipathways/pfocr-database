caption: Selenium absorption and metabolism. The organic and inorganic Se sources
  are absorbed mainly in the small intestine. Organic Se is absorbed mainly through
  B(0)AT1 and rBAT, whereas inorganic Se is absorbed through SLC26. The liver and
  other tissues such as muscle and mammary gland are able to capture Se sources from
  circulation. Sec, selenite, and selenate form a metabolic reserve, whereas SeMet
  is incorporated into various proteins in place of methionine. The remaining SeMet
  is converted to Sec via the transsulfuration pathway. The organic Sec sources are
  converted to HSe− by the SCLY or transselenation, whereas the inorganic Se sources
  (selenite and selenate) are converted to HSe− by the TRXR in the liver. The glutathione–glutaredoxin
  pathway is also involved in the production of HSe− from inorganic Se. HSe−, through
  SPS2, is converted to Se-phosphate, necessary for the formation of Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec.
  The liver synthesizes SeP, which is responsible for the transport of Se through
  plasma to other tissues (not shown in image). Se, selenium; SeMet, selenomethionine;
