caption: Cellular processes regulated by SETD7. (a) Cell proliferation—Positive regulation
  can be achieved through SETD7 methylation of ROR-alpha2 promoting its binding with
  TIP60 to induce CTNND1 expression []; direct regulation of RUNX2, which can be prevented
  by TRIM21 []; and activation of the WNT/catenin beta-1 pathway to induce AXIN2,
  LGR5 and MYC expression []. Negative regulation can be achieved by SETD7 methylation
  of catenin beta-1 promoting its proteasomal degradation, thus preventing MYC expression
  []; methylation of RIO1, which is recognised by FBXO6 followed by proteasomal degradation
  and consequent inhibition of RIO1 phosphorylation by casein kinase to induce cell
  proliferation []; methylation of Sam68 to prevent its nuclear translocation [] and
  methylation of YY in YY2 to induce the expression of ABL1, TP53, RAD1, CCNT2 and
  CCNA2 []. (b) Differentiation/EMT/Migration/Invasion—SETD7 upregulate cadherin-1
  and inhibit vimentin, SNAI2 and cadherin-2 expression preventing EMT, but its mRNA
  can be methylated by METTL3 at N6 position, which is then recognised by DF2 for
  degradation []. SETD7 inhibits SNAI2 and vimentin and promotes cadherin-1 expression
  to decrease cell migration and invasion but its mRNA can also be destabilised by
  SNHG6/hnRNP L []. Cadherin-13 positively regulates SETD7 []. SETD7 methylates E2F-1
  and Dnmt1 inducing their proteasomal degradation to decrease snail expression and
  inhibition of cadherin-1 and SETD7 expression by reducing snail/Dnmt1 (feedback
  loop) []. SETD7 directly affects cadherin-1 expression [] through H3K4me enrichment
  at its promoter []. SETD7 inhibits MMP1, MMP7 and MMP9 [] preventing invasion, and
  MMP2, TWIST1 and VEGFA and/or JAK/STA pathway [] and/or alpha-tubulin acetylation
  by HDAC6 [] to prevent migration. miR-372/373 represses SETD7 to reduce differentiation
  and enhance stemness, since SETD7 downregulates Nanog and CD24 and up-regulates
  ATOH1 []. (c) Hypoxia/Oxidative stress—SETD7 inhibits KEAP1 and induces GSTT2 and
  Nrf-2 expression through H3K4me enrichment in their promoters supporting the expression
  of Nrf-2-target genes (TXRND1, ME1, GCLC, GLCM and NQO1) to prevent ROS []. ROS
  can inhibit HIF-1-alpha degradation [] which is induced by SETD7-mediated methylation
  []. HIF-1-alpha can be demethylated by LSD1 to induce VEGFA and promote tumour growth,
  angiogenesis and vascularization []. On the other hand, under hypoxic conditions,
  SETD7 interacts with HIF-1-alpha to increase its stability enhance the expression
  of HIF-1-alpha targets (HK2, LDHA, and PDPK1) through enrichment of their promoters
  with H3K4me1, to induce HIF-1-alpha-mediated metabolic adaptation and survival [].
