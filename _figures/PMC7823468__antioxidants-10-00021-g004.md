caption: Control by the cAMP pathway of mitochondria. PKA-dependent phosphorylation
  of CREB activates the PGC-1 alpha transcription cascade promoting the expression
  of nuclear genes coding for OXPHOS subunits and mitochondrial transcription factor
  (TFAM) []. In addition to the nucleus, CREB resides inside mitochondria, where it
  binds to the D-loop of mitochondrial DNA inducing expression of structural OXPHOS
  components [,]. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the NDUFS4 subunit increases its
  import into mitochondria and assembly in complex I [,,]. sAC-dependent cAMP production
  also promotes the complex I, IV and V activities [,,,]. PKA-dependent phosphorylation
  of DRP1, inhibits its pro-fission activity, thus promoting mitochondrial fusion
  and respiration [,]. sAC-dependent cAMP stabilizes SIRT3 expression and OPA1 proteolytic
  processing promoting mitochondrial fusion and resistance to apoptosis []. The nutraceutics
  are shown in green, closed to the target molecules, for details see the text. The
  cAMP/PKA pathway is shown in red, the nuclear protein transport in bluette and the
  mitochondrial protein import in yellow.
