  Normal liver function with hepatopetal blood flow. Ammonia released from the gut
  enters the portal circulation and is detoxified in the liver via the urea cycle.
  Normal systemic ammonia levels, no HE being present. (B) Chronic liver disease with
  hepatofugal blood flow reversal resulting in development of porto-systemic collaterals
  and splanchnic blood shunting into the systemic circulation. Hepatic urea cycle
  is bypassed resulting in elevated systemic ammonia levels with increased risk for
  HE due to neuronal dysfunction. (C) TIPS with predominantly hepatopetal blood flow
  towards the low-pressure shunt rather than liver parenchyma, achieving decreased
  splanchnic blood shunting. Intrahepatic portal vein flow is hepatofugal and into
  the shunt. The hepatic urea cycle is again bypassed resulting in elevated systemic
  ammonia levels with increased risk for HE, in an acute setting, due to the increased
  metabolism of ammonia to glutamine by the astrocytes, with a subsequent tendency
  to edema. (D) Endovascular shunt modification decreases the shunt flow achieving
  hepatopetal flow reversal in the portal vein. Ammonia detoxification in the liver
  via the urea cycle is increased, thereby improving HE. This cover was created with
