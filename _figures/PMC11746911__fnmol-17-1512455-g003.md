caption: 'Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signaling pathways. Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway:
  When Wnt ligands bind to the Frizzled receptor on the membrane of astrocytes, they
  activate DSH (Disheveled) protein, initiating downstream signaling. DSH inhibits
  GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase-3β) activity, preventing β-catenin phosphorylation.
  This leads to the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, allowing it to translocate
  to the nucleus, where it binds to transcription factors such as TCF/LEF, regulating
  gene expression and interfering with CSF circulation and absorption, which contributes
  to hydrocephalus. Additionally, activated DSH can activate Rac, which further activates
  the JNK signaling pathway, affecting CSF homeostasis. NF-κB signaling pathway: TNF-α
  binds to the TNFR1 receptor, directly activating NF-κB signaling; TLR4 recognizes
  endogenous or exogenous ligands, activating NF-κB through the MyD88-dependent pathway.
  AMPK activation, caused by cellular energy imbalance, stimulates SIRT1, which subsequently
  activates NF-κB signaling. IKK2 activation can also trigger NF-κB signaling. Activated
  NF-κB regulates downstream PI3K/AKT signaling, upregulating TNF-α, forming a positive
  feedback loop that exacerbates inflammation and further contributes to hydrocephalus
  development'
