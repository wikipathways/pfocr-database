caption: Role of macrophage iron content in atherosclerosis. (A) In early/mid-stage
  atherosclerotic plaques, exposure to NHBH and NTBI directs macrophages toward a
  proinflammatory phenotypic switching, with potential proatherosclerotic action.
  Iron and heme stimulate the activation of the TLR/NFkB signaling pathway, which
  is responsible for macrophage inflammatory activation. In a synergistic manner,
  oxLDL and iron activate the TLR4 pathway, which in turn triggers the autocrine release
  of hepcidin. This results in the exacerbation of iron accumulation, ROS production,
  and inflammatory response through a positive feedback loop. In addition, iron retention
  accelerates foam cell formation by (i) promoting LDL oxidation and (ii) inducing
  cholesterol mishandling through increased CD36-mediated cholesterol uptake and decreased
  ABC transporter ABCA1/ABCG1-mediated reverse cholesterol efflux via interference
  with the CYP27A1/27HC and PPARγ/LXRα signaling, respectively. Iron and lipids therefore
  show a synergistic action in accelerating foam cell formation. ROS and TLR4 signaling
  pathways play major roles in iron-driven macrophage inflammatory activation and
  foam cell formation, which are prevented by chelators, antioxidants, and TLR4 inhibitors.
  (B) In advanced hemorrhagic plaques, exposure to the Hp–Hb or Hx–heme complexes
  directs macrophages toward an iron-recycling phenotype characterized by increased
  ability to take up Hb via the CD163 receptor and export iron via FPN, which lead
  to reduced intracellular iron and ROS formation. These macrophages, defined as M(Hb)
  or Mhem macrophages, show reduced lipid retention, decreased production of inflammatory
  cytokines, and increased secretion of the anti-inflammatory atheroprotective cytokine
  IL-10. Reduced intracellular iron and ROS lower inflammatory cytokine production,
  and improve lipid handling by reducing cholesterol loading via CD36 downregulation
  and increasing reverse cholesterol efflux via ABC transporter upregulation. While
  these nonfoam M(Hb) macrophages are in principle atheroprotective, the progressive
  intracellular iron depletion leads to HIF1α stabilization and VEGF secretion. VEGF
  exerts proatherosclerotic effects by inducing vascular permeabilization, intraplaque
  neoangiogenesis, and immune cell recruitment. Whether M(Hb) macrophages play an
  initial protective effect, which turns into a proatherosclerotic one when severe
  iron depletion is achieved, remains to be determined. Whereas iron depletion and
  low hepcidin levels are desirable in early/mid-stage atherosclerosis to activate
  an atheroprotective phenotypic switching of macrophages, iron balance in late-stage
  atherosclerosis is preferred to prevent VEGF-related atherosclerotic effects. ABC,
