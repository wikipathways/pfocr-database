caption: Simplified schematic illustrating molecular mechanisms of neurite regulation.
  Extracellular events such as cell contact [], guidance cues [], neurotransmitter
  release [], and interactions with extracellular matrix components [] are detected
  by receptors and cell adhesion molecules at the membrane surface and are transduced
  via cytoplasmic terminals and multidomain scaffolding proteins [] to downstream
  signalling molecules [-]. Polarity and directional navigation is achieved by coordinating
  local calcium concentration [], Src family kinases [], cyclic nucleotide activation
  (cAMP and cGMP) [], and phosphoinositide signalling molecules which affect the spatial
  distribution and membrane recruitment of proteins that regulate the neuronal cytoskeleton
  []. Chief among these regulators are the small Rho family GTPases RhoA, Rac and
  Cdc42, which serve as molecular 'switches' to activate downstream effectors of cytoskeletal
  remodelling []. In developed neurons, this pathway further regulates the formation
  of actin-dependent microarchitecture such as mushroom-like dendritic spines at the
  postsynaptic terminals of excitatory and inhibitory synapses []. This simplified
  schematic presents components in an exploded format for tractability, and includes
  an abridged set of interactions. Additional File  presents autism candidate genes
