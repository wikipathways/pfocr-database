caption: 'A model for the role of puc in JNK signaling during dorsal closure. Halfway
  during embryogenesis, in the cells at the leading edge of the epidermis, the hep/bsk
  pathway becomes activated, probably by Drac. As a consequence, DJun is itself activated
  and gets involved in the maintenance of dpp and puc expression. Puc will drive its
  own down regulation through inactivation of bsk, and it will control the level of
  expression of dorsal closure effectors as dpp. dpp might have two different roles:
  to induce the cellular events required for dorsal closure in the lateral cells and
  to participate in the specializations in the dorsal-most cells required for the
  last steps of closure. In puc mutants, JNK signaling becomes hyperactivated in the
  leading edge, the dorsal-ward stretching of the lateral cells proceeds normally,
  but the excess of dpp interferes with proper cell differentiation and affects midline
  alignment. When puc is ectopically expressed early throughout the epidermis, it
  blocks signaling through the bsk pathway leading to the disappearance of dpp from
  the dorsal-most cells and to a failure in dorsal closure. Late Puc overexpression
  it affects only the cellular differentiation of the leading edge cells.'
