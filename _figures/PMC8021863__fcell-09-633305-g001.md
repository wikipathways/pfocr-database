caption: The relationship between the Pentose Phosphate Pathway and DNA damage and
  repair. The PPP comprises of two phases known as the oxidative and non-oxidative
  phases. The oxidative phase is responsible for the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate
  to ribose-5-phosphate, which releases NADPH to maintain the cellular redox balance
  and also reduces oxidative damage. In the non-oxidative phase, the activity of a
  key enzyme, G6PD is stimulated by ATM to promote the production of NADPH and nucleotide
  synthesis. The activation of G6PD is essential to maintain a reduced cellular environment
  and also synthesises nucleotide precursors for DNA damage repair. This figure was
  created with BioRender.com.
