caption: Regulation of ABCC8 Expression in Hypoxic and Inflammatory Conditions. Hypoxia-induced
  stabilization of HIF-1α interacts with HIF-1β, initiating ABCC8 transcription via
  SP1 activation. In parallel, TNF-α engagement with TNFR triggers the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, enhancing ABCC8 expression. Additionally, TLR4 activation by DAMPs, leading
  to MyD88 involvement, further influences ABCC8 transcription. These interconnected
  pathways underscore the complexity of ABCC8 regulation in the cancer microenvironment,
  driven by hypoxia and inflammation commonly associated with tumor progression. Cartoon
