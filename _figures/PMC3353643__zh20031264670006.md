caption: Proposed model of WNK4 signaling pathway mediating NCC regulation in DCT.
  WNK1 and WNK4 were shown to phosphorylate SPAK/OSR1 and subsequently phosphorylate
  NCC to activate NCC, whereas our present data also showed that WNK4 also phosphorylates
  ERK1/2 and subsequently decreases NCC protein expression, suggesting that WNK4-ERK1/2
  signaling pathway is inhibitory in NCC regulation. Aldo, aldosterone; SGK1, serum
  glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1; WNK4 PHA II mutant indicates either E562K or
  R1185C; ERK1/2 is one component of MAPK signaling pathway. Gray black lines indicate
  the known stimulatory signaling pathways. Thick black lines indicate the novel inhibitory
  signaling pathway. + Sign indicates a stimulatory effect and − sign indicates an
  inhibitory effect.
