caption: 'Model Schematic. (a) Receptor module. The signaling pathway begins with
  VEGF binding to receptor R2. Ligated R2 undergoes autophosphorylation and triggers
  the phosphorylation of Src and PLCγ. (b) Calcium module. Active PLCγ converts PIP2
  to IP3 through hydrolysis. IP3 binds to its receptor on the ER membrane and induces
  Ca2+ release into the cytosol. The ER store Ca2+ depletion triggers further Ca2+
  entry through the CRAC channel which is quickly balanced by several homeostatic
  mechanisms. (c) eNOS module. Ca2+ binds to and activates CaM, which in turn activates
  eNOS. eNOS converts its substrate arginine to citrulline, producing NO. (d) Src/Akt/Hsp90
  module. Active Src activates Akt and the chaperon protein Hsp90. Hsp90 facilitates
  Akt association with eNOS, which results in eNOS phosphorylation. The binding of
  eNOS with Hsp90 and phosphorylation of eNOS both enhance eNOS activity. (e) sGC
  module. NO triggers cGMP synthesis from GTP. cGMP is degraded by PDE. TSP1 sequesters
  VEGF in the extracellular space and binds to its own receptor CD47 on the EC membrane,
  disrupting the coupling of CD47 and R2. Furthermore, TSP1 has been shown to reduce
  VEGF-induced activation of R2, Akt, and eNOS, agonist-stimulated Ca2+ increase,
  basal eNOS activity, and basal or VEGF/agonist-induced cGMP production. The signaling
  species observed to be affected by TSP1 are highlighted in blue. Shading indicates
  the relative location of reactions in the network. Light red: Src/Akt/Hsp90; light
