caption: Schematic representation of the Wingless and Int-1 (WNT) signaling pathways
  and their role during the osteochondrogenic transition of synthetic vascular smooth
  muscle cells (VSMC). (A) Chronic inflammation stands at the beginning of early atherogenesis
  and initiates the β-catenin-independent WNT signal transmission, which sparks the
  osteochondrogenic differentiation of VSMC. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) binds
  to the low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LRP1), leading to the expression of WNT5a
  through an unknown mechanism in VSMC. WNT5a, mainly originates from surrounding
  macrophages and binds to frizzled receptors (FZD) and receptor tyrosine kinase-like
  orphan receptors 1 or 2 (ROR1/2). This activation induces the WNT/Ca2+pathway involving
  Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and Calcineurin (CaN). Subsequently,
  CaN dephosphorylates the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT), leading to
  the translocation of NF-AT to the nucleus where it initiates the transcription of
  the chondrogenic determinant SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9), inducing the
  expression of extracellular matrix proteins like Aggrecan (ACAN), Collagen type
  II alpha (COL2A1), SOX5, and SOX6. (B) In late atherogenesis, conditions like hyperphosphatemia
  increase WNT/β-catenin signaling activity by inducing the expression of WNT/β-catenin
  ligands such as WNT3a. Binding of WNT3a to FZDs, co-activates lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6) inducing the recruitment of dishelved (DVL) protein to the
  receptor complex. Subsequently, DVL binds the β-catenin destruction complex, containing
  glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and
  casein kinase-1 (CK-1). This leads to an accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm,
  followed by its translocation to the nucleus where it forms a complex with T-cell
  factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) to induce transcription of the osteogenic
  determinant runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and the PPARγ inhibitor
  Cyclin D1. RUNX2 controls the transcription of osteogenic factors such as Osteocalcin
  (OCN), Osterix (OSX), Osteopontin (OPN), matrix metalloprotease 13 (MMP13), and
  alkaline phosphatase (ALP).
