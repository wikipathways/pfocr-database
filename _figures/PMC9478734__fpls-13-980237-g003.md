caption: Light signaling pathway controlling plastid transcription. GLKs, HY5 and
  unknown regulators stimulate the expression of chloroplast proteins encoded by nuclear
  genes such as PhANGs, RPOTp, and RPOTmp (encoding NEP), SIGs and PAPs (encoding
  PEP components) in response to light exposure. NEP transcribes the rpo genes of
  the PEP core proteins. The PEP core is associated with PAPs, which include PAP5
  and PAP8, two dual-localized components implicated in PHY-mediated PIF1 and PIF3
  degradation in the nucleus. PEP activity is regulated by other proteins such as
  PRIN2 in a redox-dependent way. The PEP complex transcribes the photosynthesis-associated
  plastid-encoded genes (PhAPGs). Their products aid in the establishment of photosynthesis
  when combined with the proteins encoded by PhANGs.
