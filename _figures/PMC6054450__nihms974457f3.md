caption: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) develops from substantial changes in the genome
  that originate from ultraviolet light damage (including point mutations, amplifications,
  deletions and translocations) or integration of the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV)
  genome and expression of large T antigen (LT) and small T antigen (ST) that lead
  to perturbations in a variety of signalling pathways. The retinoblastoma-associated
  protein (RB1) pathway, which normally has tumour-suppressive roles, is altered by
  mutations in RB1 in MCPyV− MCC and by LT in MCPyV+ MCC, which perturbs the ability
  of RB1 to inhibit transcription factors of the E2F family. Cellular tumour antigen
  p53 (encoded by TP53) contributes to regulating the cell cycle by activating genes
  that negatively regulate cell division; NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 encode receptors involved
  in cell differentiation and proliferation. SNPs, single-nucleotide polymorphisms.
  *Mutation observed in most cases; ‡mutation observed frequently.
