caption: Schematic representation of the model. MDV systematically modulates cellular
  lipid metabolic pathways to support its replication through FAS and COX-2/PGE2 pathways.
  (1) Infection of CEFs with MDV results in an increase of de novo FAS pathway generation,
  which is required for MDV replication. (2) Fatty acid can be stored in lipid droplet
  organelles as a site for eicosanoid biosynthesis. (3) Subsequently, PGE2 is biosynthesized
  enzymatically from arachidonic acid by inducible COX-2. Signaling of PGE2 is mediated
  through its EP2 and EP4 receptors in MDV-infected cells. Specific enzymes studied
  along the pathway and their relative importance for MDV infection are highlighted
  in yellow. Major metabolites which were identified as essential lipids are highlighted
  in green.
