caption: Proteins involved in primary metabolic responses to HLB. A) Sucrose and starch
  metabolism; B) Raffinose metabolism; C) TCA cycle; D) Oxidative pentose phosphate. Proteins
  that were differentially expressed between control and infected trees are indicated
  by colors, based on their pattern of expression in the two genotypes (see color
  key). Each colored square represents expression change in a protein catalyzing a
  step in the pathway. More than one square grouped together indicates different members
  of the same protein family found to be differentially regulated
papertitle: Proteomic analysis highlights the role of detoxification pathways in increased
  tolerance to Huanglongbing disease.
