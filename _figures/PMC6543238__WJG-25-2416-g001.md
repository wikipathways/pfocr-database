caption: 'Modulation of tumor immunity by radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade.
  Radiation-induced cell death results in cytosolic DNA accumulation in the tumor,
  which in turn activates the production of type I interferon (IFN) genes via cGAS/STING
  pathway. Increased IFN activates antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells
  (DCs), which can prime T cells within draining lymph node. IFN also mediates recruitment
  of effector CD8+ T cells capable of killing cancer cells into irradiated tumor sites.
  Radiation triggers the release of tumor antigens and danger-associated molecular
  patterns, which can also activate DCs. Radiation-induced secretion of cytokines
  and chemokines play both pro-immunogenic and immunosuppressive roles in the tumor
  microenvironment. The antitumor effect of radiation therapy (RT) is frequently hindered
  by activation of immune checkpoint pathways. Thus, the combination of RT and immune
  checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-programmed death 1 inhibitor shows a synergistic
  effect in many types of cancer. The immune checkpoint blockade also enhances RT-induced
  systemic effect, called abscopal effect, which refers to the regression of an unirradiated
  tumor. cGAS: Cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase; CTLA-4:
