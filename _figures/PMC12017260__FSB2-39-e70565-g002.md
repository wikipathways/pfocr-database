caption: Related cellular signaling pathways in NOX carcinogenesis. ROS generated
  by NOX can cooperate with tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) to promote carcinogenesis,
  while TKRs can enhance the expression and activity of NOX isoforms. Additionally,
  ROS generated by NOX activity can maintain the TKR signaling pathway and the activation
  of transcription factors involved in carcinogenesis by inhibiting the activity of
  protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). NOX regulates oncogene expression by modulating
  several cellular signaling pathways related to stress signaling, including the Janus
  kinase‐signal transduction and transcription activator (JAK‐STAT) pathway, the phosphatidylinositol
  3‐kinase and protein kinase C (PI3K‐PKC) pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase‐AKT
  (PI3K‐AKT) pathway, and the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway
  (specifically the RAS‐ERK pathway). These interactions ultimately contribute to
  tumor invasion, migration, angiogenesis, and drug resistance
