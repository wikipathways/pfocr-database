caption: Basal ganglia circuit. The basal ganglia are a collection of interconnected
  deep gray subcortical nuclei that are essential in the control of motor function.
  The major input nucleus of the basal ganglia is the striatum (caudate and putamen).
  The cerebral cortex sends stimulatory inputs to the striatum, including primary
  motor cortex. The major output nuclei include the substantia nigra pars reticulata
  (SNr) and the internal globus pallidus (GPi). Two major parallel pathways project
  from the striatum to the major output nuclei of the basal ganglia. The direct pathway
  contains inhibitory projections from the striatum to the output nuclei. GABAergic
  neurons in the striatum that express D1 dopamine receptors project to the SNr and
  GPi. The indirect pathway is polysynaptic, and ends in excitatory projections to
  the output nuclei from the subthalamic nucleus (STN). GABAergic neurons in the striatum
  that express D2 dopamine receptors project to the external globus pallidus (GPe),
  and subsequently the GPe sends inhibitory projections to the STN. The result of
  disruption of the indirect pathway is disinhibition of the STN, and net increased
  excitatory stimulation to the output nuclei. The balanced activity between the direct
  pathway inhibition of the output nuclei and the indirect pathway excitation is essential
  for the normal control of motor activity. The action of dopamine in the striatum
  decreases transmission through the indirect pathway and increases transmission through
  the direct pathway. Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta
  (SNc) in PD leads to decreased inhibitory tone in the direct pathway with subsequent
  increased stimulatory tone in the indirect pathway, increased GABAergic tone at
  the thalamus and reduced excitation of the motor cortex. Metabotropic glutamate
  receptors are expressed throughout the basal ganglia. The Group I receptors (mGlu1
  and mGlu5) are expressed in multiple locations in the basal ganglia. They are located
  post-synaptically, and inhibit the basal ganglia response to dopamine. Group II
  receptors (mGlu2/3) are located presynaptically to the cortico-striatal, STN-SNr,
  and STN-SNc synapses. Of the Group III receptors, mGlu4 is known to modulate corticostriatal,
  STN-SNr, as well as intrastriatal GABAergic synapses. Cholinergic systems modulate
  basal ganglia function. Of primary importance, tonically active cholinergic interneurons
  in the striatum release acetylcholine to modulate basal ganglia and motor function.
  They act project to neighboring medium spiny neurons in the striatum. Muscarinic
  acetylcholine receptors are expressed in the basal ganglia. M1, M2, M4 receptors
  are expressed in the striatum, with M5 receptors expressed on dopaminergic neurons
  in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and SNc. M4 receptors colocalize with D1 expressing
  neurons in the striatum. The development of subtype specific allosteric modulators
  of muscarinic ACh receptors will allow for further characterization of their location
  and function in the basal ganglia circuit. Adapted from , , , and .
