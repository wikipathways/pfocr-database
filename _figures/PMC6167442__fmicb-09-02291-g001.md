caption: Schematic comparison of phospholipid synthesis in Escherichia coli (free
  living bacteria) and Chlamydia trachomatis (obligate intracellular bacteria). Modified
  from . (A) Phospholipid synthesis pathway in E. coli. (B) Phospholipid synthesis
  in C. trachomatis. C. trachomatis encodes all the genes necessary for type II fatty
  acid (FASII) and phospholipid synthesis from acetate, glycerol-3-phosphate, serine,
  and isoleucine typically found in free-living bacteria. Fatty acids are made in
  the type II fatty acid synthesis system (FASII). Two acyltransferases (PlsE and
  PlsC in C. trachomatis vs. PlsB and PlsC in E. coli) make phosphatidic acid (PA).
  Phosphatidic acid is the precursor to the various phospholipid species, and C. trachomatis
  encode for the genes to synthesize phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol
  (PG), and cardiolipin (CL) like E. coli. Exogenous fatty acids are converted into
  acyl-CoA in E. coli. Acyl-CoA cannot be elongated by FASII, and can only be used
  by the acyltransferases or broken down by β-oxidation. In contrast, exogenous fatty
  acids are converted into acyl-ACP in C. trachomatis, which can be elongated by the
  FASII or used by the acyltransferases. C. trachomatis is not predicted to encode
  for β-oxidation genes.
