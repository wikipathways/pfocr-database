caption: 'Viral modulation of kinase-dependent hypoxia responses. Different kinase
  signaling cascades lead to the activation of HIF-1⍺. (A) The EBV latent membrane
  protein 1 (LMP-1), through CTAR-1, activates TRAF3, which activates the p44/p42
  MAPK pathway and mediates the recruitment of ERK1/2/NF-κB to the promoter of the
  HIF-1A gene resulting in the induction of HIF-1⍺ transcription. (B) KHSV, through
  vGPCR is capable of inducing ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways, increasing HIF-1⍺.
  HPV type 16 oncoproteins E6 and E7 induce HIF-1⍺ protein accumulation by activating
  the ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways. (C) Hepatitis viruses have also been reported
  to have the capacity to activate kinases to upregulate HIF-1⍺. For instance, to
  promote HIF-1⍺ stabilization, HCV and the ORF3 protein of HEV can activate the PI3K/AKT
  pathway, while the ORF3 protein of HEV also induces ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation
  of CBP/p300 to transactivate HIF-1⍺. Moreover, HCMV induces the upregulation of
  HIF-1⍺ stabilization through the viral chemokine receptor US28, by modulating a
  Gαq calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). (D) To promote HIF-1⍺,
  HBV virus protein X (HBx) induces the nuclear translocation and activation of HIF-1⍺,
  by activating the MFK1/2 ERK pathway. On the other hand, HCMV may activate HIF-1α
  through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Similarly, KHSV has been shown to upregulate
  vGPCR, and induce the paracrine activation of the alpha subunit of a Gq protein
  receptor, which promotes p38-dependent phosphorylation of the regulatory domain
  of HIF-1⍺ and its concomitant upregulation. EBV: Epstein–Barr virus; KHSV: Kaposi’s
  Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus; HPV: Human papillomavirus; HCV: Hepatitis C virus;
  HEV: Hepatitis E virus; HBV: Hepatitis B virus; HCMV: Human cytomegalovirus.'
