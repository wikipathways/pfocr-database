caption: The central metabolic pathway and its immediate branches. The color reflects
  the direction of expression change with increasing latitude (green increasing, red
  decreasing). Thick arrows are genes with both significant clines and significant
  expression effects. They possess high PCA1 loadings. Thin colored lines have significant
  expression effects but no significant clines. Dotted lines have nonsignificant expression
  effects but may or may not have significant clines. The latter two groups are simply
  suggestive of change and direction. Black solid lines (ATPCL) are not available.
  The red and yellow dots represent NADH and NAD cofactors, respectively, and the
  large red dotted line is the cytoplasmic-mitochondrial boundary. The metabolities
  with highest connectivity are boxed. The results for Men, Gpt, and Pfrx are not
  included to prevent undue complexity.
