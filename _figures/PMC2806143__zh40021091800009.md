caption: Diagram of the pathway linking ouabain with Na+ pump α2-subunits, NCX1, TRPC1,
  and TRPC6 expression, upregulation of [Ca2+]cyt and Ca2+signaling, and their likely
  effects on vascular tone and blood pressure. Several known interactions, including
  those elucidated in this report, are indicated by solid arrows (outside the boxes).
  Links that have not been clarified and that require further investigation are indicated
  by dashed arrows. To focus on this proposed pathway, a variety of feedback regulatory
  mechanisms have been omitted. [Na+]cyt, cytosolic free Na+ concentration.
