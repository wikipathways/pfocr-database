caption: 'After entry via endocytosis, KSHV stimulates TLR3, which leads to upregulation
  of downstream cytokines such as CXCL-10 and IFN-β1 in monocytes, while KSHV can
  downregulate the expression of TLR4 after endothelial cell infection. KSHV vGPCR
  along with vIRF1 are responsible for this TLR4 inhibition. The KSHV ORF45 IE gene
  inhibits IRF-7, while KSHV RTA targets IRF for degradation via ubiquitination. vIRF-1
  binds CBP/p300, inhibiting the transcription of cellular IRFs and the IFN response.
  vIRF-3 blocks the activation of the IFN response by blocking IRF-7 binding to IFN
  promoters. vIRF-2 also blocks the IFN response via inhibiting the transcription
  function of cellular IRFs. Finally, in the context of latency, TLR7/8 stimulation
  with poly-(U)ridine or vesicular stomatitis virus, leads to reactivation of latent
  KSHV and infectious virion production. IFN: Interferon; IRF: Interferon regulatory
  factor; KSHV: Kaposi''s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus; TLR: Toll-like receptor;
  vGPCR: Viral G protein-coupled receptor; vIRF: Viral interferon regulatory factor;
  VSV: Vesicular stomatitis virus.'
