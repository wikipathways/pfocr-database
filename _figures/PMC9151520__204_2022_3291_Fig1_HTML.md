caption: Structure–Activity Relationship (SAR) of compounds that induce the p53 signaling
  pathway. All compounds with associated structures present in the library were clustered,
  based on structural similarity using the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm (Kohonen
  ). Then, each cluster was evaluated for enrichment with active agonists (compared
  to the library average) using the Fisher’s exact test. In the heatmaps, each hexagon
  represents a cluster of structurally similar compounds. Clusters are colored by
  the significance of enrichment (negative log p value) such that more significantly
  enriched clusters are colored closer to a maroon color and the other clusters are
  colored with different shades as indicated in the color bar. A light gray color
  shade represents that the degree of enrichment of the cluster is close to the library
  average
