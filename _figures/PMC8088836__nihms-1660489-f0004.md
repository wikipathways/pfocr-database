caption: 'Monocarboxylate transporters 1 and 4 (MCT1/MCT4) mediate the efflux into
  the TME of lactate and H+ generated by glycolysis []. Sodium bicarbonate transport
  channels (NBCs) maintain the alkaline intracellular pH (pHi) through the transport
  of HCO−3[]. Carbonic anhydrases (CAIX/CAII) play a key role in two pathways (MCT
  and NBC), facilitating H+ distribution and HCO−3 production, respectively []. Na+/H+
  exchangers release H+ into the TME through the influx of Na+ []. Cancer cells express
  vacuolar-ATPase (V-ATPase) on the cell surface through utilization of the a3 isoform,
  and this mediates the transport of cathepsins and H+ from lysosomes to the TME [].
  In cancer cells, inhibition of cellular respiration by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
  (PDK) and increased activity of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), that transports glucose
  into the cell, promote glycolysis (the Warburg effect) []. Forkhead box protein
  M1 (FOXM1) binds to the promoter of the mitochondrial D-lactate dehydrogenase (LDHD)
  gene and enhances the expression of LDHD that converts pyruvate to lactate []. Glucose-6-phosphate
  generates CO2 via glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and the pentose-phosphate
  pathway (PPP) []. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation increases hypoxia-inducible
  factor (HIF)-1α translation []. During normoxia, HIF-1α binds to von Hippel–Lindau
  (VHL) and undergoes ubiquitination, resulting in proteasomal degradation of HIF-1
  []. Abbreviations: HRE, hypoxia response element; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation;
  pHe, extracellular pH; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; Ub, ubiquitin.'
