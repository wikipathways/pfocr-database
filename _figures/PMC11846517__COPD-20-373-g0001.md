caption: A schematic representation showing the alterations in carbohydrate metabolites’
  metabolic pathways amid ARDS. During ARDS, the metabolic pathways encompassing carbohydrates,
  such as glucose and lactate, undergo transformative changes. This diagram tentatively
  demonstrates that perturbations in glucose and lactate concentrations instigate
  a cascade of intermediate receptor regulation, notably GPCR and PKC, affecting downstream
  signaling molecules. Concurrently, the disruption in energy metabolism precipitates
  ROS generation and free radicals, which consequently inflict DNA damage and instigate
  inflammation. For further information, refer to the main text
