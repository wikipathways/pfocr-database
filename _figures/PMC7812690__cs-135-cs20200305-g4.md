caption: 'Inhibition of ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) may lead to activation of the pro-apoptotic
  factor BAD. This leads to BAX activation and Cyt C release from mitochondria. This,
  in turn, leads to ATP depletion and activation of caspase 9 and can lead to apoptosis.
  Normally, ATP depletion would lead to activation of AMP kinase (AMPK); however,
  VEGFI inhibition of AMPK prevents this action, leading to increased activation of
  ACC and mTOR activity and further ATP depletion by fatty acid and protein synthesis.
  Inhibition of PDGFR-β leads to decreased PI3K, which may lead to up-regulation of
  pro-apoptotic BAD pathway. Direct inhibition of Raf-1 may down-regulate the MEK-ERK
  pathway, reducing cell survival. Additionally, Raf-1 inhibition may prevent the
  inhibition of pro-apoptotic kinases such as ASK-1. On-target inhibition of VEGFR-2
  may down-regulate PLC-γ leading to reduced IP3 and impaired calcium cycling, which
  may reduce myocardial contractility. Abbreviations: ACC, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase;
  ASK-1, apoptosis-signal-regulating kinase-1; BAD, BCL2-antagonist of cell death;
  BAX, BCL2-associated X protein; Cyt C, cytochrome c; IP3, inositol-trisphosphate-3
  kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K, phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase;
  PLC- γ, phospholipase C; PKC, Protein kinase C; PDGFR-β, platelet-derived growth
  factor receptor; Raf-1, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma-1.'
