caption: Model for mitochondrial oxidants as regulators of cellular metabolism. As
  described, an increase in metabolite flow to the mitochondria results in an increase
  in O2 consumption with the subsequent increased release of ROS into the cytosol.
  This increased ROS level is sensed by the cytosol, resulting in the activation of
  JNK1. In turn, JNK1 inhibits the activity of GSK-3β, most likely through a pathway
  involving RSK3. The resulting change in GSK-3 activity leads to augmented glycogen
  synthase (GS) activity. Increased glycogen synthase activity results in an increased
  conversion of glucose to glycogen, with a subsequent reduction in metabolic substrate
  and hence a fall in mitochondrial oxidants. In addition to the effects of peroxide
  on JNK activity, peroxide can also result in the decarboxylation of pyruvate and
  thereby reduce mitochondrial metabolism, represented as the flow of electrons (e−)
  through complexes I through IV. CoA, coenzyme A; CoQ, coenzyme Q; MnSOD, manganese
  superoxide dismutase.
