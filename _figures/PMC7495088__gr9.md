caption: Model of pIgR regulation in CF lung. First, accumulation of misfolded F508del-CFTR
  (CFTR*) is responsible for ER stress. Consequently, activation of UPR is able to
  downregulate SC and S-IgA secretion. Second, Pa infection modulates this pathway
  (orange arrows). Pa drives host IL-17 response which stimulates PIGR expression
  and further increases ER stress and UPR activation.[,] In addition, if ER stress
  caused by Pa infection becomes insufficiently counterbalanced by UPR activation,
  it may contribute to IgA upregulation, as previously shown. CFTR, cystic fibrosis
  transmembrane regulator; UPR, unfolded protein response; SC, secretory component;
  S-IgA, secretory immunoglobulin A; d-IgA, dimeric immunoglobulin A; Pa, Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa; IL-17, interleukin 17; pIgR, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor.
