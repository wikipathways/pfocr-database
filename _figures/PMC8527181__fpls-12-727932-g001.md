caption: A section of the proposed monolignol biosynthetic pathway in Populus spp.
  The H, C, G, and S refer to the type of subunits in lignin, 4-hydroxyphenyl, catechyl,
  guaiacyl, and syringyl, respectively. Reaction A indicates 4CL activity for the
  formation of 4-coumaroyl-CoA from 4-coumaric acid, and reaction B indicates 4CL
  activity for the formation of caffeoyl-CoA from caffeic acid. C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase;
  C3H, p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; C3′H, p-coumaroyl shikimate 3′-hydroxylase; 4CL,
  4-coumarate CoA ligase; HCT, 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimic acid hydroxycinnamoyl
  transferase; CSE, caffeoyl shikimate esterase. Enzymes in parenthesis indicate the
  distinguished reactions for the specific hydroxylation of monolignols.
