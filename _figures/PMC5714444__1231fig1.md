caption: Intracellular sugar-responsive gene regulatory network. The main regulators
  of sugar-responsive gene expression are the heterodimeric bHLH-Zip transcription
  factors Mondo and Mlx. Mondo-Mlx has a direct role in regulating gene expression
  programs, which are essential in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. In addition,
  Mondo-Mlx activates the transcription of a second tier of transcriptional regulators,
  including Sugarbabe and Cabut as well as other regulatory proteins such as protein
  kinase SIK3. In parallel, glucose regulates indirectly, through the generation of
  fatty acids and NAD+, transcription factor HNF4 and deacetylase Sirt1, respectively.
  The transcriptome regulated by Mondo-Mlx and HNF4 are partially overlapping. However,
  how these factors interact is yet unknown. bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; FA, fatty
  acid; HNF4, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4; Mlx, Max-like protein X; NAD+, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; OXPHOS,
  oxidative phosphorylation; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; SIK3, salt-inducible
  kinase 3; Sirt1, Sirtuin 1; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
