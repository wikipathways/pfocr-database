caption: Schematic representation of the death receptor signalling pathways. Upon
  ligation of TNF ligand to its receptor (TNFR1), several molecules are required to
  the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (TRAF, TRADD, RIPK1 and IAP). The cIAPs recruit
  the LUBAC complex causing ubiquitination of RIPK1 ultimately leading to the activation
  of NF-κB and induction of inflammation. Dysregulation of this pathway leads to the
  formation of complex IIa by recruitment of caspase-8 resulting in the induction
  of apoptosis. Under the conditions that also the activation of caspase-8 is hampered
  (complex IIb), RIPK1 will recruit RIPK3 resulting in the phosphorylation of MLKL
  and the induction of necroptosis. Next to the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, the intrinsic
  apoptosis pathway is described as the activation of the Bax-Bak-dependent mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Consequently, cytochrome C is released from
  the mitochondria thereby stimulating the activation of caspase-9 and downstream
  executioners caspases-3 and -7 to initiate apoptosis. Chemotherapy or cytotoxic
  metabolites enable, through MOMP, activation of a RIPK1-caspase-8-driven NLRP3 activation.
  Also, ZBP1 is a cytoplasmic sensor for viral RNA of Influenza A virus resulting
  in the activation of the same RIPK1/caspase-8 pathway. Moreover, caspase-8 by itself
  can cleave pro-IL-1β. Additionally, caspase-8 and FADD have been found to associate
  with the NRLP3 inflammasome resulting in the gasdermin D-mediated pyroptotic form
  of cell death.
