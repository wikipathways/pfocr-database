caption: 'Key reactions involved in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Ceramide is
  produced in the ER and later transported to the Golgi complex for further conversion
  to complex sphingolipids. In addition to de novo synthesis, ceramide is also generated
  by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin. Ceramide is subject to conversion to various other
  sphingolipid intermediates like ceramide-1-phosphate, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate.
  Cellular compartments are represented by boxes and enzymes are italicized. CDASE:
  ceramidase; CERK: ceramide kinase; CERS: ceramide synthase; CERT: ceramide transfer
