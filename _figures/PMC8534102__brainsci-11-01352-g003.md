caption: Hypothetical role of APP in the pathogenesis of mental illness, with differences
  among three of the major mental disorders. The process of neuroinflammation, which
  led to an altered APP metabolism, might be made up of different pathways for each
  mental pathology. Thus, whereas in schizophrenia, the pathway could be an alteration
  in BACE1 and in bipolar disorder it could be a response to neurotoxicity, depression
  might be influenced by two distinct ways—a neurodegenerative pathway (similar to
  AD) and an unknown pathway (different from AD).
