caption: The inner circle with black arrows illustrates how iron homeostasis is regulated
  by the hepcidin-ferroportin axis. Starting from the top, high plasma and/or tissue
  iron leads to the activation of the HFE/TFR2 system and the BMP/HJV/SMAD signaling
  pathway that upregulate hepcidin expression. Hepcidin degrades ferroportin which
  limits iron absorption and tissue iron release, thereby lowering plasma iron concentration
  (bottom). Starting from the bottom, iron deficiency activates TMPRSS6 and suppresses
  the HFE/TFR2 and BMP/HJV/SMAD signaling pathway, thereby lowering hepcidin expression,
  increasing ferroportin activity, and increasing iron absorption from the diet and
  mobilization from body stores to increase plasma iron. Anemia (bottom) stimulates
  erythropoiesis. Proliferating red blood cell precursors secrete ERFE that inhibits
  BMP/SMAD signaling to lower hepcidin and increase iron availability. The outer circle
  of this figure displays how genetic variants or diseases lead to iron deficiency
  or overload. In hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), genetic variants in HFE, TFR2,
  HJV, HAMP or FPN (gain of function) downregulate hepcidin and/or activate ferroportin,
  which eventually lead to iron overload. TMPRSS6 inactivation, inflammation or CKD
  upregulate hepcidin, leading to iron refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) or
  anemia of inflammation (AI). Ineffective erythropoiesis in iron-loading anemias
  such as β-thalassemia leads to excessive ERFE production, hepcidin downregulation
  and iron overload.
