caption: Metabolic fluxes and glycolytic enzyme isoforms in the Respiration and Glycolysis
  StatesRespiration State (low glucose, normal O2). In the Respiration State gluconeogenic
  enzymes such as fructose 1, 6 bis phosphatase (FBPase) are active and supply G6P
  for the pentose phosphate pathway. Other metabolic pathways are optimized to obtain
  energy by oxidation of non glucose substrates such as blood lactate, lipids, ketones,
  and acetate. Although glycolysis does not take place the activities of hexokinase,
  phosphofructokinase and other glycolytic enzymes in the upper portion of the pathway
  are high. The activity of enzymes in the lower portion of the glycolytic pathway
  are reduced, and the expressed isoforms of pyruvate kinase (e.g., PKM1) are insensitive
  to allosteric activation to prevent futile cycles.Glycolysis State (high glucose,
  low O2). After extended exposure to high glucose cancer cells in the Respiration
  state will replace (through gene expression and post translational mechanisms) their
  glycolytic enzyme isoforms, such as HK1, and PKM2, with isoforms characteristic
  of cancer cells such as HK2, and PKM2. In addition, the glycogen shunt and FBPase
  are suppressed, resulting in net ATP synthesis in glycolysis at the normal 2 ATP
  synthesized per glucose phosphorylated ratio. The PKM2 isoform is highly sensitive
  to being activated allosterically by FBP, and has similar kinetics as PyK1 in yeast
  (). As a consequence of these isoform changes the glycolytic pathway is stabilized
  without the need for the glycogen shunt, as are pathways connected to it at branch
  points such as the pentose phosphate pathway at G6P.VHK, flux through HK; Vshunt,
