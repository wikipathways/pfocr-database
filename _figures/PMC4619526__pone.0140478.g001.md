caption: Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is produced in the skin from UV photoconversion
  of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), which can be converted to cholesterol through a
  process mediated by 7-dehydrochlesterol reductase (DHCR7), or obtained through diet.
  Vitamin D3, as well as vitamin D2 from plant sources and dietary supplements, is
  metabolized in two hydroxylation steps. The first hydroxylation occurs in the liver
  largely by CYP2R1-mediated 25-hydroxylase action to form the most abundant circulating
  metabolite, 25(OH)D [] and the second in the kidney, breast, and other tissues by
  CYP27B1 to form the active metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D [, ]. The molecular actions of
  1,25(OH)2D occur upon its binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), prompting the
  association of the VDR with the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA), to activate or
  suppress transcription of downstream gene targets. 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D are broken
  down into 24-hydroxylated products by CYP24A1 and targeted for excretion []. Vitamin
  D and its metabolites are bound with varying affinities and transported in the circulation
  by the vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) [–].
