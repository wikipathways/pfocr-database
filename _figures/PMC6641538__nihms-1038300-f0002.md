caption: In eukaryotes, iron acquisition is mediated through metal or metal-siderophore
  transport. Cytosolic iron must first cross the semipermeable outer mitochondrial
  membrane and then be imported into the mitochondrial matrix for heme and Fe-S cluster
  synthesis through transferrin-mediated endosome-to-mitochondrial contact, termed
  kiss-and-run, and/or via divalent metal transporter (DMT1). Iron is transported
  across the tight diffusion barrier of the inner mitochondrial membrane by hydrophobic
  mitochondrial carrier proteins called mitoferrins (MFRN1, MFRN2), which may form
  a complex with ABCB10. In mitochondria, iron is inserted into protoporphyrin IX
  (PPIX) by ferrochelatase (FECH) to produce heme. The first step in the heme synthesis
  pathway involves the production of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). ALA is then transported
  to the cytosol where the next four steps take place to form coproporphyrinogen III
  (CoPIII), which is transported back into mitochondria to form PPIX. Heme is transported
  outside of mitochondria via the 1b isoform of FLVCR (feline leukemia virus subgroup
  C cellular receptor) for incorporation into hemoproteins. Mitochondrial iron is
  also used for Fe-S cluster synthesis, which among other factors involves frataxin
  (FXN) and GLRX5 (glutaredoxin-related protein 5), which are exported into the cytosol
  by ABCB7. Fe-S clusters are essential for the efficient functional of the electron
  transport chain (ETC) to generate ATP in a process called oxidative phosphorylation.
  Excess iron can be stored in mitochondrial ferritin (MTFT).
