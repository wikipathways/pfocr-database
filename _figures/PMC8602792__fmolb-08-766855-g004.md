caption: The different state of hedgehog signaling pathway. In the absence of ligands,
  the signaling is on “Off state”, PTCH1 inhibits the activity of Smo. Protein kinase
  (including PKA, CK1 and GSK3β), SuFu and KIF7 phosphorylate Gli, which leads proteolytic
  cleavage of Gli to Gli-repressor (Gli-R). Gli-R represses the expression of target
  genes. In Hhn secreting cells, the precursor of Hh is auto-cleaved and can be modified
  by a cholesterol at C-terminus to form Hhn on ER membrane. After this process, Hhn
  is secreted from the secreting cells and bind to PTCH1. PTCH1 is degraded in endosome,
  and consequently Smo repression is removed. Activated Smo inhibits the effect of
  PKA on Gli proteins, leading to the dissociation of SuFu, and Gli active form (Gli-A)
  is formed. Gli-A promotes the expression of target genes.
