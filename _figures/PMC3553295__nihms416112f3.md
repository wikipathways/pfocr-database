caption: 'Model based on Panther Pathway diagram (http://www.pantherdb.org). Venn
  diagram depicts color key for signaling components. Genes labeled yellow showed
  a sustained increase in Coc and W/D (cluster i), red genes increased in W/D only
  (cluster ii), and blue genes had decreased expression in both Coc and W/D (cluster
  v); overlap colors indicate contribution of > 1 cluster to signaling group. For
  example, GPCRs, which appear in all three clusters, are shown in magenta. Genes
  from Clusters i, ii, and v were used for this analysis. Abbreviations: Coc, Cocaine;
  W/D, Withdrawal.'
