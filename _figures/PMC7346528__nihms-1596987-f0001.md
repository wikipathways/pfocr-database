caption: Hedgehog signaling pathway. Initial ligand binding activates hedgehog signaling.
  Sonic hedgehog binds to the receptor PTCH1, which disrupts the inhibition of cytoplasmic
  smoothened, allowing it to translocate to the membrane where it is active. Membrane-bound
  smoothened then activates SUFU, which facilitates the translocation of GLI1–3 into
  the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the GLI1–3 transcription factors coordinate the
  expression of numerous genes. Due to its involvement in numerous sporadic tumor
  types, inhibitors of the Hh pathway activity have been developed. The two main targets
  of inhibition are smoothened and GLI1. The main inhibitors are labeled in red
papertitle: Mutations in the sonic hedgehog pathway cause macrocephaly-associated
  conditions due to crosstalk to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
