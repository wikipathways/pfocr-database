caption: 'Schematic of the canonical and noncanonical pathways by which the NACHT,
  LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is activated and
  elicits an inflammatory response. In the canonical pathway (above the horizontal
  red line), 2 steps are required: priming (left of the vertical red line) and activation
  (right of the vertical red line). The priming step is initiated when, for example,
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from a uropathogen binds to the membrane-bound Toll-like
  receptor 4 (TLR4). Ligand binding then upregulates the expression of inflammasome
  components such as pro-IL-1β and the Nod-like receptor NLRP3 via the NF-kB pathway.
  Preexisting NLRP3 is also deubiquitinated, a necessary step before oligomerization
  can occur. In the second, activating step, a signal is received in the form of 1)
  potassium efflux from the cell, 2) generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  3) mitochondrial damage with release of mitochondrial DNA and cardiolipin, and/or
  4) lysosomal disruption release of cathepsin. During this step, NLRP3 oligomerizes
  and recruits the adapter protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing
  the caspase recruitment domain (ASC). Pro-caspase-1 is recruited to complete the
  active inflammasome, where it is cleaved and released as active caspase-1. The activated
  caspase-1 then cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to their active forms. Caspase-1
  also cleaves gasdermin D, and the N terminus of this protein is responsible for
  inducing pyroptosis. Pyroptosis releases the mature cytokines [and many danger-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPSs)] through a lytic cell death process. The released proinflammatory
  cytokines then initiate the inflammatory process while the DAMPs propagate the inflammation
  by triggering inflammasome activation in neighboring cells. In the noncanonical
  pathway, LPS (or other triggering agent) binds directly to caspase-11, which then
  facilitates the oligomerization of the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent maturation
  of cytokines. Caspase-11 can also stimulate pyroptosis by direct cleavage of gasdermin
  D.'
