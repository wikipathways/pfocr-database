caption: Protein-protein interaction analysis by STRING. The data were extracted from
  curated databases (turquoise line) or determined experimentally (pink). The light
  purple line represents protein homology. The yellow line represents text-mining.
  Co-expressed proteins are linked by black line. The color of the node denotes the
  pathway in which proteins are involved.
