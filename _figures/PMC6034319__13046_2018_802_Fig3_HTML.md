caption: 'Cross-talk between tumor, MDSCs and immune cells for development of HPV-related
  carcinogenesis. As demonstrated in the figure and in the text, HPV-tumor cell plays
  a central role in HPV-related carcinogenesis. This cell is able to secret a number
  of proinflammatory and immunosuppressive factors, which induce macrophage differentiation
  towards M2 phenotype, iMC differentiation towards MDSCs as well as the recruitment
  and activation of both MDSCs and proinflammatory immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils
  and mast cells). Major molecules for the occurrence of these events are: CCL2 and
  CXCL12, for cell recruitment; TGF-β, IL-1β and IL-10, for immunosuppression; MMP-9,
  for tumor invasion; and STAT3, due to the activation of JAK/STAT3 intracellular
  signalling pathway which enables the occurrence of cell response to all stimuli
  caused by the engagement of the shown cytokines and factors to their respective
  receptors'
