caption: The molecular gene targets, respective signaling pathways and molecule mediators
  associated with the biological responses was demonstrated in NF3-treated HUVEC at
  6 h. Yellow molecules represented differentially expressed genes identified from
  microarray analysis. Blue box represented the suggested signaling pathway. Purple
  box represented the molecular mediators. Green box represented the biological responses.
  + indicated as positive regulation and–indicated negative regulation.
