caption: Activation of c-Rel signaling by the canonical NF-κB pathway in B cells.
  Major signaling and regulatory components described in the main text are illustrated.
  (1) Cardinal triggers of c-Rel signaling include B cell receptor (BCR), toll-like
  receptor (TLR) or CD40 stimulation. (2) In Btk-deficient B cells c-Rel DNA-binding
  activity is strongly reduced following stimulation. (3) The paracaspase mucosa-associated
  lymphoid tissue protein 1 (MALT1) which is part of the CBM complex is specifically
  required for BCR signal-induced c-Rel nuclear translocation. (4) In mature B cells
  the predominant NF-κB dimers are formed by c-Rel and p50. (5) c-Rel is sequestered
  in the cytoplasm by interaction with the inhibitory proteins IκBα, IκBβ and IκBε.
  Various upstream stimuli of canonical NF-κB signaling can target these IκB proteins
  for proteasomal degradation. (6) c-Rel is modified on a post-translational level.
  These post-translational modifications (M) can influence c-Rel transactivation and
  transforming activity. (7) Once released from the inhibitory IκB proteins, c-Rel
  translocates into the nucleus and binds to κB target sites to exert its function
  as a transcription factor. (8) PI3K signaling contributes to maintaining c-Rel levels
  in B cells. (9) Regulation of c-Rel is mediated by ubiquitination and subsequent
  proteasomal degradation. (10) REL mRNA levels are controlled on a post-transcriptional
  level. References as well as further details and abbreviations are provided in the
  main text. In addition to references cited in the main text, the content of this
  figure is based on Okkenhaug and Vanhaesebroeck, 2003 [], Siebenlist et al. 2005
  [], and Murphy et al. 2007 []. P, phosphorylation; U, ubiquitination; M, post-translational
  modification.
