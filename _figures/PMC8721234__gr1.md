caption: The cancer immunotherapy strategy by cooperating PCO nanovaccine with aPD-1.
  PCO nanovaccine was subcutaneously (s.c.) injected into the mice. After uptake the
  PCO, immature DC (iDC) was stimulated into mature DC (mDC), and further presented
  the antigen-peptide to T cell for activating antigen-specific T cell. However, tumors
  could adopt PD-L1/PD-1 pathway to instigate T cell anergy, so aPD-1 was utilized
  via tail vein injection (i.v.) to block the immune escape and mediate T cell rejuvenation.
  By cooperating the “T cell induction” of PCO nanovaccine and the “T cell maintainance”
  of aPD-1, the immunotherapy efficiency would be synergistically enhanced.
