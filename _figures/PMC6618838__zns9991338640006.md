caption: 'A model of memory retrieval processing of cross-modal SP. A, The procedure
  of cross-modal SP. B, A schematic representation of hypothetical associations that
  could be formed for memory retrieval processing of cross-modal SP. The solid arrows
  indicate the pathway of the former model for CS1 memory retrieval; the dashed arrow
  represents another hypothetical pathway for CS1 memory retrieval. C, Anatomical
  representation of unimodal memory retrieval. Separated neural structures for olfactory
  and visual elevation memory retrieval: the α/β and γ lobes of MBs are necessary
  for olfactory memory retrieval; F5 is necessary for elevation memory retrieval.
  D, A model of a circuit for memory retrieval of cross-modal SP. Two memory traces
  are formed after CS2 conditioning, each of which can be retrieved independently.
  The two pathways could correspond through the olfaction–vision association, which
  may require the α/β lobes of MBs. CR, Conditioned response; FB, fan-shaped body.'
