caption: Hypothetical mechanisms by which the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway prevents
  renal tubular cell injury by decreasing mitochondrial ROS production, preserving
  mitochondrial function, and ameliorating cytoskeletal damage and cell apoptosis
  under high lipid conditions. PA exposure induces an abnormal accumulation of lipids,
  which may induce mitochondrial injury accompanied by a reduction in ΔΨm, fragmented
  mitochondrial accumulation, and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway activation, which
  eventually leads to cell apoptosis. Mitochondria are the major source of intracellular
  ROS production and are also vulnerable to ROS, and mitochondrial damage can lead
  to excessive mtROS generation, which can induce cytoskeletal damage or further promote
  mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. The Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway is activated
  to reduce mtROS production, subsequently protecting against damaged mitochondria
  and attenuating cytoskeletal damage and cell apoptosis, thereby attenuating hyperlipidemia-induced
  tubular injury.
