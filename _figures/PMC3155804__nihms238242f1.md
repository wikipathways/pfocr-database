caption: The Q cycle depicted schematically is based on Trumpower et al. and Snyder
  et al. [, ] showing the pathway of electron transfer from reduced Q6 (QH2) to cytochrome
  c. At the P site, two electrons are transferred in a concerted manner from QH2 to
  the iron-sulfur protein and to cytochrome bL. Myxothiazol (Myx) binds to the P site
  and prevents electron transfer to the Rieske protein. At the N site, coenzyme Q
  (Q) is reduced by cytochrome bH first to the semiquinone and then to QH2. This step
  is inhibited by antimycin (Ant), which binds to the N site. The stippled arrows
  show the pathway of reduction of coenzyme Q to the semiquinone at the P site in
  the presence of antimycin A or myxothiazol. The semiquinone formed in the presence
  of myxothiazol is the result of a slow leak of electrons to the iron sulfur protein
  [].
