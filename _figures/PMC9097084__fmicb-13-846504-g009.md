caption: Model for two types of cells belonged to susceptible and resistance grape
  in response to downy mildew strains BS-4-MW. The diagram represents some of the
  characteristic features of two different grape cells during P. viticola infection.
  Left side (red) is as susceptible cell of Vitis vinifera cv. “Zitian Seedless” grape.
  Right side (blue) is as resistant cell of Vitis “Kober 5BB” rootstocks grape accomplices
  with HR-like cell death. The middle overlapping part (purple) is some signal pathway
  shared both in the susceptible/resistant cells. R gens Resistant genes; NBS-LRR
  nucleotide-binding site, leucine-rich repeats, as R receptors to recognize effecters;
  MAPK Mitogen- activated protein kinase; NADPH nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate hydrogen; Ca2+, Calcium ion; STS, Stilbene synthase; VPE, Vacuole processing
  enzyme; MC, Metacaspase; PLCP, Papain-like cysteine protease; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; TFs, Transcription factors; HR, hypersensitive response.
