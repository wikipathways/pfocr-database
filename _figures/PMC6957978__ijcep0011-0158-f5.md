caption: Scheme of engagement of ERK pathway by BLU. The tumor suppressor BLU was
  re-expressed by viral transduction or gene transfection. The expression of BLU inhibited
  the phosphorylation of ERK that was catalyzed by an upstream kinase(s), which opposed
  the effect of RAS proteins. Next, the activity of the CCND1 and CCNB1 gene promoters
  was down-regulated, leading to reduced expression of cyclins D1 and B1, and induction
  of G1 cell cycle arrest. It remains to be elucidated whether reduced proportions
  of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle was related to the change of cyclin
  B1 level.
