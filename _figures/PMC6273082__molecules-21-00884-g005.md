caption: The hypothetical mechanism of ursolic acid against MRSA. Initially, ursolic
  acid contacts MRSA and causes a destructive effect on the bacterial membrane. Later
  on, ursolic acid affects the proteins that are involved in the translation process
  with translational accuracy. The accumulation of mRNA and misfolded protein leads
  to an induction of ribonuclease and chaperon subunits. Furthermore, most of the
  metabolic enzymes involved in glycolysis display a decrease in their relative rate
  of synthesis upon treatment with ursolic acid. The repression of glycolysis and
  the pentose phosphate pathway induces the production of PtsI and Crr protein, the
  bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS), to mediate the uptake and phosphorylation
  of carbohydrates and to control the metabolism in response to energy deficiency.
  Finally, ursolic acid elicits the oxidative response in MRSA. AhpC is induced in
  order to protect bacterial cells against reactive ursolic acid.
