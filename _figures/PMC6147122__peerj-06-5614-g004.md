caption: 'Proposed energy metabolism in the MALP genome. (A) Hydrogen dependent reduction
  of methanol to methane. (B) Acetate disproportionation to methane and carbon dioxide.
  (C) Methanol disproportionation to methane and formate. Substrates of energy metabolism
  are indicated in red, products in blue. Enzymes are indicated by numbered circles:
  (1) Methanol:coM methyltransferase; (2) methyl-coenzyme M reductase; (3) [NiFe]-hydrogenase/heterodisulfide
  reductase; (4) Fpo-like complex/heterodisulfide reductase; (5) ATP synthase; (6)
  Acetyl-CoA synthetase; (7) Acetyl-CoA synthase; (8) N5-tetrahydrofolate:Coenzyme
  M methyltransferase; (9) CO-dehydrogenase; (10) carbonic anhydrase; (11) energy
  conserving pyrophosphatase; (12) N5-methyltetrahydrofolate oxidation pathway. CoM,
  Coenzyme M; CoB, Coenzyme B; Fd, ferredoxin; THF, tetrahydrofolate; THMPT, tetrahydromethanopterin.'
