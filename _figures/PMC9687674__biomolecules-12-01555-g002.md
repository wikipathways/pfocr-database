caption: Signaling of 4-HNE in Nrf2 and NF-κB pathway. Lower concentrations of 4-HNE
  lead to the induction of transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid-2-related
  factor 2) and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). This increase in Nrf2 causes
  an increase in gene expression, which leads to cardioprotection by enhancing synthesis
  of antioxidants. Increase in NF-κB leads to increased (↑) pro-inflammatory cytokine
  expression.
