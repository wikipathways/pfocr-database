caption: Pathogenic interactions (parasitism) cause degradation of proteins and nucleic
  acids in the arthropod vector. Intermediate metabolites direct metabolic regulators,
  such as transcription factors and hormones, to increase pathogenic immune responses.
  Enhanced glycolysis (blue) and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (gray)
  enhances pyruvate availability for conversion into lactate. Increased glycolytic
  intermediates (glucose-6-phosphate or G-6-P) feed into the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) to provide ribose sugars for anabolic processes. Mutualism increases mitochondrial
  activity and drives the energy towards lipid catabolism. Lipids are broken down
  into fatty acids (blue), which reduce competition for energy and drives interspecies
  relationships towards mutualism. Red depicts parasitism and green depicts mutualism.
  Metabolic pathways depicted in gray arrows are less utilized during parasitism and
  mutualism, respectively. Conversely, metabolic pathways depicted in white arrows
  are increasingly utilized during these interspecies relationships. Dotted lines
  indicate intermediate metabolites not shown. This figure was created according to
  the principles and tenets of ecology and evolutionary biology and based on an empirical
  framework of metabolic supply and demand observed in mammals [, –, , ]. Metabolic
  outcomes were then transposed to a conceptual outline in arthropod vector-microbial
  interactions.
