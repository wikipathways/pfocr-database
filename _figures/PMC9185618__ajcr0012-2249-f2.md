caption: 'Methionine and Folate Cycles are Linked by One-Carbon Metabolism. A. The
  methionine and folate cycles functionally interact to generate intermediates and
  cofactors for various anabolic processes. Available methionine largely depends on
  dietary input. Methionine cycle intermediates can be diverted into the methionine
  salvage pathway to promote purine synthesis and into the transsulfuration pathway
  to aid in the production of reduce glutathione. B. The methionine and folate cycles
  interact to divert intermediates based on methionine availability. SAM normally
  inhibits MTHFR and BHMT and promotes CBS to divert intermediates towards nucleotide
  and glutathione synthesis when methionine and SAM are plentiful. During times of
  low SAM, this inhibition in released, increasing the synthesis of methionine from
  homocysteine as well as allowing 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to begin to accumulate.
  5-methyltetrahydrofolate blocks GNMT to allow methyltransferases to utilize available
  SAM to maintain RNA, DNA, and histone methylation. MAT2A selectively increases during
  low methionine, further increasing SAM synthesis. Together, this regulation maintains
  intermediates around the folate and methionine cycle in times of low methionine
  input. Abbreviations: TS, tetrahydrofolate synthase; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; MS, methionine synthase; MAT,
  methionine adenosyltransferase; MAT2A, methionine adenosyltransferase 2A; GNMT,

  S-methyltransferase; CBS, cystathionine-β-synthase; MTAP, S-methyl-5’-thioadenosine
  phosphorylase.'
