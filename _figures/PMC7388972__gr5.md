caption: Schematic representation of S. pombe cell wall integrity pathway. Rho1 is
  activated by the sensors Wsc1 and Mtl2, which detect and transmit signals coming
  from the cell wall through the GEF Rgf1. Rho1 activates y the β-(1,3)-glucan synthase
  and stabilizes the kinases Pck1 and Pck2. Both kinases are activated by the Phospholipid-dependent
  kinase Ksg1 and in turn activate the β-(1,3)-glucan synthase. Rho2 is not activated
  by Wsc1 or Mlt2, but regulates the α-(1,3)-glucan synthase via Pck2. Additionally,
  Rho2-Pck2 are the main activators of the MAPK cell integrity pathway. Signaling
  of this pathway is transmitted through the MAPK module to Atf1 and Mbx1 transcription
  factors in the nucleus and to different targets such as the RNA-binding proteins
  Rnc1 or Ndr1 in the cytoplasm. Pmk1 also activates the Yam8/Cch1 calcium channel
  that in turns activates the phosphatase complex calcineurin. This phosphatase antagonizes
  the function of MAPK pathway in response to several stimuli. Other phosphatases
  including Pmp1, and the SAP-dependent phosphatases Ptc1, Pyp1 and Pyp2 negatively
  regulate Pmk1 activation.
