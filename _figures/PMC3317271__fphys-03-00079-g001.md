caption: Simplified scheme of cell death and survival pathways involved in ALF. Activation
  of TNF receptor-1 can mediate NF-κB activation, apoptosis, or necroptosis. The different
  outcomes are determined by distinct TNF receptor-associated signaling complexes.
  Activation of NF-κB is mediated by TRAF-2, RIP-1, and other signaling molecules
  that lead to activation of IκB kinase and subsequent activation of NF-κB target
  genes. FADD and caspase-8 are the essential adapter proteins involved in apoptosis,
  which in hepatocytes requires a mitochondrial amplification loop through caspase-8-mediated
  cleavage of Bid. The subsequent translocation of Bax and Bak results in mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c release, and effector caspase-3 activation.
  Under conditions of impaired apoptosis, TNF receptor-1 can induce necroptosis, which
  involves RIP-1 and RIP-3 kinases. Among other effects, RIP-3 can increase the production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to increased oxidative phosphorylation, resulting
  in intracellular calcium overload, mitochondrial membrane permeability transition
  (MPT), depletion of ATP, and necrosis. APAP-induced necrosis is essentially mediated
  by a toxic metabolite, which depletes glutathione and forms APAP protein adducts,
  triggering oxidative stress, compromised respiratory function, and ATP depletion.
  Although APAP treatment can instigate the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, high
  doses of APAP will ultimately mediate liver cell death by necrosis.
