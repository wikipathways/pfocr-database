caption: Tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway. Enzymes involved in the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic
  pathway are indicated by red. Important genes described in this article are shown
  in yellow boxes and genes encoding GUN proteins are indicated by red borders. It
  is noted that GUN2~GUN6 genes are found at the branch points of Chl and heme biosynthesis.
  GUN1 interacting proteins are indicated by blue borders.
