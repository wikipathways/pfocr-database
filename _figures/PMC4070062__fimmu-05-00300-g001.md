caption: TLRs and autophagy. (A) TLR4 stimulated with LPS induces autophagosome formation
  via TRIF–p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling axis. Similarly,
  TLR7 activation by ssRNA and imiquimod also promotes autophagy induction. These
  processes facilitate fusion of the autophagosomes with the lysosomes, which in turn
  finally result in the killing of intracellular mycobacteria. (B) TLR2 and NOD1/2
  mediate autophagy induction in response to Listeria monocytogenes. Autophagy induction
  in this process requires the ERK pathway. (C) LAP mediates the production of type
  I IFNs induced by TLR9 activation in response to DNA-ICs. Large DNA-ICs engulfed
  by phagocytosis are internalized using FcγR, which recruits LC3 and TLR9–UNC93B
  to the phagosomes. Unlike NF-κB-dependent inflammatory cytokine production, LC3
  is required for the trafficking of TLR9 into a specialized IRF7 signaling compartment
  for type I IFNs secretion. In response to the endocytosed CpG-ODN, however, AP3
  is required for delivery to the IRF7 signaling compartment. (D) Autophagy facilitates
  the viral sensing by delivery of cytosolic viral PAMPs to lysosomes, enabling endosomal
  TLRs to sense of virus and subsequently activating type I IFNs production.
