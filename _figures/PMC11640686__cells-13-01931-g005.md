caption: 'Schematic representation of chemically induced reprogramming of ESCs and
  iPSCs into neural stem cells and into neurons of the brain and retina [2,47,52,54,97,98,99].
  Chemically induced reprogramming utilized small molecules that acted on the cellular
  epigenome (Epi) and on various signaling pathways that control cellular identity
  (TGFβ, GSK3β, WNT, BMP, NOTCH, ROCK, and others). GF—growth factor; iPSC—induced
  pluripotent stem cell; ESCs—embryonic stem cells; RSCs—retinal stem cell; CiRGCs—chemically
  induced retinal ganglion cells; CiR—chemically induced retina; CiROD—chemically
  induced rods; CiRPE—chemically induced retinal pigment epithelium; CiPCs—chemically
  induced photoreceptor-like cells; m NOD-SCID—the nonobese diabetic/severe combined
  immunodeficient mouse; m Crxtvrm65/IL2rγ−/−—model of immunosuppressive mouse/retinal
  degeneration; m NOD.SCID-rd1—the nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient
  mouse model of retinal degeneration; RCS rat—rat model of retinal degeneration from
  Royal College of Surgeons; IVT—intravitreal injection; SRT—subretinal injection;
  mMNU—mouse model of N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU)-induced retinal degeneration, m—mouse,
  h—human. Pathway activators: green color; pathway inhibitors: red color. 2.3.4.
