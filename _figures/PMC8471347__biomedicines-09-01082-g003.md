caption: 'The TIF-IA-NF-κB nucleolar stress response pathway. When cells are exposed
  to specific stimuli, a cascade of events is triggered that leads to degradation
  of transcription initiation factor IA(TIF-IA) in a manner dependent on the second
  messenger ceramide, inhibition of cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) (depicted by
  T shaped line), recruitment of the nucleolar protein p14ARF (ARF) and the RNA polymerase
  I (PolI) complex component, upstream binding factor (UBF). Specifically, serine
  (s) 484 of this protein. This TIF-IA degradation results in degradation of IκBα,
  which allows NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus and regulate expression of target
  genes that control cellular processes such as apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation
  and senescence. Solid arrows depicts pathway to NF-κB nuclear translocation. Dashed
  arrows depict TIF-IA degradation pathway. NSAIDs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
  drugs.'
