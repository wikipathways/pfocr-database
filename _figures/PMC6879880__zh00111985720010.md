caption: 'Model of differential STAT1 and STAT3 signaling pathways in wild type (WT)
  and neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) knockout (KO) podocytes. Left: in WT podocytes,
  antigen/antibody (immune complexes) bind FcRn in the late endosome. Immune complexes
  (ICs) bound to FcRn are trafficked to the lysosome for proteolytic degradation.
  This trafficking pathway leads to IL-6 production via an unknown mechanism. IL-6
  in turns binds to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6 R) on podocytes and activates the JAK/STAT3
  pathway. IFNɣ signals via the IFNɣ receptor and the JAK/STAT1 pathway. Right: in
  FcRn KO podocytes, lack of FcRn leads to significantly less IL-6 production and
  thus little activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Signaling through the JAK/STAT1
  pathway via IFNɣ is unaffected in the KO. Unopposed signaling via phospho-STAT1
  may lead to further inhibition of signaling via phospho-STAT3. SOCS, suppressor
  of cytokine signaling; PIAS, protein inhibitor of activated STAT.'
