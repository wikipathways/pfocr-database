caption: Proposed gestational age-dependent changes in placental TRP metabolic pathways.
  The schematic illustration is based on gene expression studies and, in the case
  of rate-limiting enzymes/key transporters, also on protein, and/or functional activity.
  The first-trimester placenta preferentially utilizes TRP for generation of 5-HT
  involved in fetal development and synthesis of KYN metabolites implicated with neuroprotection,
  antioxidative and redox effects, and DNA repair. On the other hand, the term placenta
  synthesizes significant amounts of KYN important for immune regulation activities.
  Collectively, our findings strongly indicate gestational age-related changes in
  placental handling of TRP and its main metabolites, 5-HT and KYN. This may reflect
  the changes in placental and fetal demands for metabolites of either pathway to
  ensure proper embryonic and fetal development throughout pregnancy.
