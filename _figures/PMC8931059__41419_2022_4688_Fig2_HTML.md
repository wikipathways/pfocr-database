caption: Representation of the CD95-mediated conventional or apoptotic pathway. The
  interaction between CD95 and its membrane-bound ligand mCD95L, triggers the recruitment
  of the adaptor protein FADD, which then recruits procaspase-8 generating the oligomerized
  DISC. The oligomerisation and auto-cleavage of procaspase-8 into its active form
  induces then the activation of the effector caspases-3, -6, -7 leading to apoptosis.
  Active caspase-8 is also able to cleave Bid, generating t-Bid that promotes Mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and thus the apoptosome-mediated effector
  caspase activation.
