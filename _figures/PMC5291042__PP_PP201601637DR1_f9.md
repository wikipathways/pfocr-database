caption: Model of the relationship between C16 cutin precursor synthesis and the ultrastructure
  and physical properties of the petal cuticle. Cutin biosynthetic enzymes (in red)
  determine the ultrastructure of the cell wall-cuticle continuum and the physical
  properties of the cuticle. CYP776A performs the midchain hydroxylation of ω-OH C16:0,
  giving 10,16-diOH C16:0 that is esterified to glycerol by GPAT6. The resulting monoacylglycerol
  is further metabolized by DCR to a molecule required for nanoridge formation, potentially
  by linking it to a nonaliphatic component (?). Independent of 10,16-diOH C16:0 as
  substrate, DCR forms with unknown substrates cell wall-cuticle organizing molecules.
  The nanoridges present on petals reduce interactions with other surfaces, leading
  to a cuticle lacking adhesion. In the absence of DCR, CYP77A6 is hypothesized to
  be inactive, and only ω-OH C16:0 is incorporated in the cuticle via a GPAT6-dependent
  pathway not involving DCR. Defects in DCR, CYP77A6, and GPAT6 result in a nanoridge-free
  petal surface having a high degree of interaction with other surfaces and undergoing
  adhesion. The necessary transport steps that are involved in the transfer of cutin
  precursors to the cuticle are not shown. Blue dots symbolize possible zones of interaction
  with other surfaces. Cu, Cuticle; CW, cell wall; NR, nanoridge; OM; organizing molecule,
