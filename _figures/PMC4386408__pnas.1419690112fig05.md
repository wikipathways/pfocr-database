caption: Model for the mechanism of the switch off in Shh canonical signaling during
  spinal cord development. The transition from neural plate to spinal cord is accompanied
  by the appearance of Ca2+ spikes, which intercalate in the Shh-signaling pathway
  to down-regulate Gli activity. This switch off of the canonical Shh pathway is implemented
  at several levels including regulation of Gli subcellular localization, posttranslational
  processing, and transcriptional repression, all converging in inhibiting Gli activity.
