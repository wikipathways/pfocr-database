caption: GAB1 recruitment modes to activated receptors and major GAB1 signaling pathways.
  The direct mode of recruitment appears to be exclusive to the c-MET receptor (A),
  although it can also recruit GAB1 indirectly, like the other tyrosine kinase receptors
  (B). Physical interaction between GAB1 and CRK, SHP2, and p85 has been described,
  triggering the activation of the JNK, Ras/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT cell signaling pathways,
  respectively. ERK positively or negatively regulates GAB1 phosphorylation in a context-dependent
  manner, while SHP2 negatively regulates it. In addition, in response to HGF, PKC-α
  and PKC-β1 regulate GAB1 activation in a negative way. Red arrows denote negative
  regulation
