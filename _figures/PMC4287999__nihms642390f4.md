caption: Mechanism of T-helper-17 (Th17) cell-mediated lymphangiogenesis. Th17 cell-secreted
  interleukin-17 (IL-17) induces lymphangiogenesis via a vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF)-D/C–VEGFR-3 signaling pathway. In response to Th17-secreted IL-17,
  IL-17-receptor-expressing cells such as epithelial and stromal cells directly upregulate
  expression of VEGF-D; whereas VEGF-C expression is upregulated via IL-17-induced
  IL-1β-mediated pathway. Both VEGF-D and VEGF-C bind to VEGFR-3 on lymphatic endothelial
  cells and promote proliferation and tube formation by lymphatic endothelial cells.
