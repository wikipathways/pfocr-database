caption: Pathways disrupted by mutations in the CGC set, identified in clear cell
  sarcoma, revealing dysregulations in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, polymerase
  II transcription, DNA damage and mismatch repair, SUMOylation damage and chromatin
  organization-modifying enzymes. Red-coded nodes represent the significantly dysregulated
  pathways, and the significance is determined by the intensity of the color. The
  size of the node indicates how many genes are documented in each pathway. The edges
  represent the associations between the pathways, and the thickness is used to present
  the associated level.
