caption: The regulatory genes involved in seed deterioration during seed storage in
  rice. Most of the genes, such as OsLOX2/LOX3, OsALDH7, AKR1, and OsPLDα1/α3, regulate
  seed deterioration mainly through lipid peroxidation. Rice OsPIMT1, osa-miR164c/168a,
  Os4BGlu14, and OsGH3-2 regulate seed deterioration involved in the information of
  protein iso-aspartyl residues, membrane integrity, primary metabolism, and ABA pathway,
  respectively. Arrows and lines with slanted dashes indicate positive and negative
  effects, respectively. osa-miR164c/168a, microRNAs; OsLOX2/LOX3, lipoxygenase 2/3;
  OsALDH7, aldehyde dehydrogenases; AKR1, aldo-ketoreductase; OsPLDα1/α3, phospholipase
  D; OsPIMT1, protein–lisoaspartyl methyltransferase; Os4BGlu14, a monolignol β-glucosidase;
  OsGH3-2, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)–amido synthetase gene GRETCHEN HAGEN3-2.
