caption: The process of Hedgehog pathway begins on binding of specific ligands such
  as exo-secretion ligand Shh bind to the trans-membrane receptor PATCHED1 (PTCH1)
  it initiates the HH-GLI pathway. Binding of this ligand to the receptor inhibits
  SMOOTHENED (SMO) protein leading to its translocation to primary villi of the cell
  and inhibition of GLI repressors (mostly GLI3R) and activation of intracellular
  signaling cascade. The cascade causes translocation and nuclear activation of the
  transcription factor Gli2. In parallel to this, the transcription factor Gli2 is
  upregulated playing an important role in cell proliferation, regulation and cell
  fate determination by turning on specific gene expression. It also causes transcription
  of three GLI zinc finger transactivation factors PTCH1, GLI1, HIP. Targeted inhibition
  of SMO and GLI1 could lead to cell death. Therefore, directly or indirectly inhibiting
  HH-GLI pathway could potentially eradicate the tumor and CSC population in the tumor.,.
