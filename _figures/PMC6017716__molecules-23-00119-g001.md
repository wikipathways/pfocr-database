caption: Multidrug resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression
  in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells promotes tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)
  efflux and a consequent reduction of intracellular drug concentration. On the other
  hand, some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) may reduce Pgp drug efflux activity
  and then TKIs can inhibit Bcr-Abl protein. However, high intracellular drug concentration
  may induce Pgp mRNA transcription. Pgp may also contribute to apoptosis inhibition
  through IAP proteins (survivin and XIAP). Nevertheless, the new compound LQB-118
  could overcome MDR through ROS induction, NFκB pathway inhibition, and IAP downregulation.
  Anyway CML cells release cellular microvesicles (MV) carrying oncogenic molecules
  whose cargo can be transferred to microenvironment cells.
