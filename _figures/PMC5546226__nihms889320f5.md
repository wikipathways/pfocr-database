caption: The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is divided into an oxidative and a non-oxidative
  arm. In the former, the glycolytic intermediate glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized
  to ribose-5-phosphate that can then feed the non-oxidative PPP. The non-oxidative
  PPP converts ribose-5-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate that re-enters the oxidative
  PPP and sustains a cycle aimed at regenerating NADP+ to NADPH. Ribose-5-phosphate
  can otherwise fuel the de novo pathway of nucleotide biosynthesis to generate the
  building blocks for DNA replication and RNA transcription. Quiescent cells mostly
  use the salvage pathway of nucleotide regeneration that recycles senescent DNA and
  RNA to feed the nucleotide pool. The one-carbon metabolism is compartmentalized
  between cytosol and mitochondria and provided essential carbon equivalents for purine
  and pyrimidine biosynthesis. The THF cycle is the entry point of the essential amino
  acid serine to sustain proliferation of activate T cells.
