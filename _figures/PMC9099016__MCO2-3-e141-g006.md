caption: Important mechanisms and roles of lncRNAs in Wilms tumor. (A) HOXA11‐AS promotes
  apoptosis and maintains the cell cycle in the G1/S phase by binding to CCND2; (B)
  as an oncogene, LINC00473 binds to miR‐195 to promote cell viability and inhibit
  apoptosis; (C) the lncRNA XIST may promote migration by regulating microRNA‐193a‐5p.
  The lncRNA XIST can also undergo migration, invasion, and apoptosis through another
  axis, miR‐194‐5p/YAP; (D) SNHG6 can promote proliferation, migration and incursion
  through sponging miR‐15a; (E) MEG3 can promote Wilms tumor proliferation and metastasis
  by regulating the expression of β‐catenin through the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway (originally
  made on Adobe Illustrator)
