caption: Biosynthetic levulinic acid-production pathways proposed and/or assembled
  in vivo to enable production in microbial cells. The pathways depicted in the picture
  include those already assembled in vivo (in blue) and those identified by metabolic
  retrobiosynthesis (in green, red and yellow). Detailed identification of the enzymes
  involved in the different steps is provided in . Enzymatic steps are numbered to
  match the enzymes detailed in . Lumped reactions (involving multiple enzymatic steps)
  are depicted in dashed lines. For the pathways depicted in blue, one route starts
  with a β-ketoadipyl-CoA thiolase (1) and a 3-oxoadipyl-CoA transferase (2) and the
  other route entails the synthesis of protocatechuic acid (PCA) (4) and a dearomatization
  pathway (5), with both ending with a 3-oxoadipic acid decarboxylase (3). The red
  pathway entails an aldolase (7) and a series of redox reactions (8), while the green
  pathway starts with either a D-ALA transaminase (9) or a glutamate semialdehyde
  aminomutase (11) to yield 4,5-diaminovaleric acid, which is deaminated to LA by
  diaminovaleric ammonia lyase (10). The yellow pathway includes a 4-amino valeric
  aminomutase (12) and a 4-aminovaleric transaminase (13).
