caption: 'A: Networks of pathways unique in the HIV-1 regulated mPBMCs. The networks
  showing the relationship of genes in the antigen presentation, the T-cell receptor
  and the ERK/MAPK pathways are shown. B: Relationship networks of genes associated
  with the NK cell signaling pathway in both HIV-1- and SIV-infected mPBMCs. The networks
  were built by Ingenuity pathway analysis. Each dot represents a gene, with green
  indicating down-regulation of the gene, and red indicating up-regulation of the
  gene. Each line connecting two genes indicates a relationship between the gene products
  as reported in literature.'
