caption: The induction of IFNs and the antiviral state they exhibit in bat (P. alecto)
  cells. dsRNA is detected by either RIG-I/MDA5 or TLRs on endosomes, initiating downstream
  signaling via MAVS, TRIF, and TRAF3. These adaptors activate the transcription factors
  IRF3, IRF7, NF-κB, and AP-1 via the assembly of multi-protein complexes. Upon activation,
  these transcription factors translocate to the nucleus and stimulate the transcription
  of interferons, such as IFNβ. IFNβ then binds to its cognate receptor complex IFNAR
  via autocrine and paracrine manners to activate the JAK-STAT pathway. This terminates
  at the activated ISGF3 transcription factor which in turn, translocates to the nucleus
  and initiates the transcription of genes in ISRE promoters known as ISGs. ISGs then
  act in a multitude of ways to establish an antiviral state in the cell against invading
  pathogens.
