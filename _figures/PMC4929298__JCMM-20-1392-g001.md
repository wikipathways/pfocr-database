caption: 'General outline of ubiquitination. Ubiquitination is the covalent attachment
  of the glycine residue of ubiquitin to the lysine residue of the target protein
  via an isopeptide bond. This process is mediated by E1, E2 and E3 enzymes. E1 ligases
  forms thioester bonds with ubiquitin, which is subsequently transferred to E2 ligases
  through a thioester linkage. E3 ligases are grouped into two types: HECT type and
  RING‐finger/adaptor type. Only the HECT domain E3 ligase forms a covalent bond with
  ubiquitin during polyubiquitination of abnormal proteins, whereas the RING‐finger
  E3 ligases directly transfer ubiquitin from the associated E2 enzyme to the substrate
  protein. Proteins can be mono‐, multiple‐ or poly‐ubiquitinated. Mono‐ and multiple‐ubiquitinated
  proteins are degraded by lysosomes (autophagy), whereas the degradation of polyubiquitinated
  proteins depends on the type of ubiquitin linkage (K48, K63, K6, K11, K27, K29 and
  K33). K48‐linked polyubiquitinated proteins are generally degraded by the proteasomal
  pathway. Polyubiquitination via K6 is associated with DNA repair; via K11, with
  endoplasmic reticulum‐associated protein degradation and cell cycle regulation;
  via K27, with ubiquitin fusion degradation; via K29, with lysosomal degradation;
  and via K33, with kinase modification. DUBs remove ubiquitin from the substrate
  protein, and the monomers are recycled.'
