caption: (a) A schematic illustration depicting the metabolic pathway of B(a)P (i)
  elucidating its enterohepatic circulation and association with cancer development
  involving diverse bacterial interactions and (ii) delineating its toxicity, which
  induces damage to bacterial cells, subsequently contributing to immune disorders
  and resultant diseases. (b) Illustration of (i) several types of MP/NP characteristics
  on combined adsorption with B(a)P and (ii) mechanism of micro-/nanoplastic (MP/NP)
  co-exposure with B(a)P and single exposure of MPs/NPs on gut microbiome disturbances
  which induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, increasing antioxidant activity
  and causing several chronic diseases in different organs. Yet the co-exposure MPs
  and B(a)P study effects on gut microbiota require further research, this co-exposure
  may also damage gut microbiome cells potentially leading to dysbiosis
