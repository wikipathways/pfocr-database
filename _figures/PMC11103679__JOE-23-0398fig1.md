caption: 'Direct and indirect mechanisms of androgen signalling. (i) Ligand-dependent
  direct androgen receptor signalling: Upon androgen binding to the cytoplasmic androgen
  receptor (AR), AR begins to dissociate from the chaperone proteins and translocates
  to the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus AR binds to androgen target genes through
  androgen response elements to alter the transcription of target genes (Davey & Grossmann
  2016). (ii) Ligand-independent androgen receptor signalling: Cytoplasmic AR can
  be activated through phosphorylation due to activation of growth factor receptor
  mediated signalling pathways. The phosphorylated AR is then able to translocate
  to the nucleus and induce the expression of androgen target genes (Bennett et al.
  2010, Davey & Grossmann 2016, Kadel & Kovats 2018). (iii) Indirect membrane-bound
  androgen receptor signalling: Androgens can bind to a membrane bound form of the
  AR and induce signalling transduction which results in the binding of transcription
  factors to target genes altering gene expression. This induction of intracellular
  signalling pathways can also result in the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic form
  of the AR which can then translocate to the nucleus and induce AR-dependent direct
  signalling pathway (Kousteni et al. 2001, Estrada et al. 2003, Kang et al. 2004,
  Davey & Grossmann 2016, Thomas 2019). (iv) Indirect membrane associated androgen
  receptor signalling: Androgens can also exert their effects via the cytoplasmic
  AR that is localised at the cell membrane. Binding of androgens to this receptor
  leads to activation of intracellular signalling pathways that result in the transcription
  of target genes (Kousteni et al. 2001, Estrada et al. 2003, Kang et al. 2004, Davey
