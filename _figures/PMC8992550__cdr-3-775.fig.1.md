caption: The cellular response to radiation-induced DNA damage. Ionising radiation
  can generate a variety of DNA lesions, but where oxidative DNA base damage, abasic
  sites, and single-strand breaks (SSBs) predominate. The base excision repair (BER)
  pathway involves recognition of the damaged base by a damage-specific DNA glycosylase
  (DG) and incision of the abasic site by APE1. Following SSB generation and binding
  by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), deoxyribosephosphate (dRP) removal and
  gap filling is conducted by Pol β prior to ligation by XRCC1-Lig IIIα. DNA double
  strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by either non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) in
  G0/G1 or by homologous recombination (HR) in S/G2 phase of the cell cycle. In NHEJ,
  two general pathways exist, c-NHEJ and a-NHEJ. c-NHEJ utilises Ku70/80 to bind the
  DNA ends, followed by DNA-Pkcs and XRCC4-Lig IV to promote DNA ligation. On the
  other hand, a-NHEJ involves DSB end-resection by the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN)-C-terminal
  binding protein-interacting protein (CtIP) complex, PARP-1 binding to the DSB ends,
  and subsequent repair by XRCC1-Lig IIIα (or Lig I). During HR, DNA end-resection
  by the MRN complex promotes replication protein A (RPA) and RAD51 binding to the
  single stranded DNA overhangs in the company of BRCA1. This promotes strand invasion
  into the sister chromatid through a BRCA2-dependent process and subsequent DNA synthesis
  in the presence of RAD52/RAD54, followed by formation and resolving of Holliday
  junctions, completing the DSB repair process. Of note is that complex DNA damage
  (CDD) can consist of several different DNA lesions in close proximity and therefore
  is likely to utilise both BER and NHEJ/HR for repair
