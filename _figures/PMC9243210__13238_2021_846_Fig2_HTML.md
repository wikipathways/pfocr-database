caption: 'An overview of metabolic connections to epigenetic remodeling. Nutrients
  such as glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids are metabolized by cells to produce
  a variety of metabolites, such as acetyl-CoA, NAD+, SAM, α-KG, ATP, and succinate,
  which function as substrates or cofactors to modify chromatin and proteins. Specifically,
  1) UDP-GlcNAc, as a donor substrate derived from the HBP pathway integrating glucose,
  glutamine, fatty acid (acetyl-CoA), and nucleotide metabolism (UDP), is catalyzed
  by OGT for GlcNAcylation modification, and OGA controls the reverse reaction. 2)
  Lactate generates lactyl-CoA, which contributes a lactyl group to lysine residues
  of histone proteins through p300, generating a novel modification called lactylation.
  3) Glucose-, fatty acid-, amino acid-, and acetate-derived acetyl-CoA are widely
  involved in acetylation modification. Histone acetylation is catalyzed by HATs,
  and the reverse reaction is mediated by lysine deacetylases (HDAC and SIRT). 4)
  Based on the ratio of ATP:AMP, AMPK is required for the phosphorylation of histones
  under various stress conditions. 5) Histone lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb)
  depends on the metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), which is produced by the ketone
  body metabolic pathway. The enzymes involved in acetylation modification mediate
  this reversible reaction. 6) Citrulline is categorized into two types: free citrulline
  from the arginine-coupled urea cycle and the guanidine dehydration of arginine residues
  on proteins to create citrulline residues. Histone citrullination is a PTM that
  converts arginine residues to citrulline via PAD enzymes, which are Ca2+-dependent.
  7) TCA cycle-derived succinyl-CoA is the major substrate for succinylation, and
  the opposite reaction is mediated by KAT2A, CPT1A, and SIRT5. 8) Reversible chromatin
  methylation is coupled with SSP, the folate cycle, and the methionine cycle. SAM
  is the substrate for HMTs and DNMTs, leading to the production of SAH. Succinate,
  fumarate, and 2-HG inhibit the demethylases HDMs and TETs, which catalyze the demethylation
  reaction in an α-KG-dependent manner. In addition, NAD+ and NADH transitions are
  involved in modifications such as acetylation, β-hydroxybutyrylation, and succinylation'
