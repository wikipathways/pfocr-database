caption: 'Stem cell exhaustion and intercellular communication regulated by redox
  signaling. a Cellular senescence typically facilitates tissue repair following injury
  and shields the organism from oncogenic harm. This process occurs through four sequential
  steps: damage, senescence, elimination, and repair. Failure in each of these steps
  renders the organism susceptible to developing diseases. b The stemness of cells
  is regulated by multiple pathways. Among them, the redox modification of Keap1 regulates
  the stability of NRF2, thereby modulating the expression of its downstream effectors
  Notch1 and Shh. Notch1 and Shh serve as ligands of the Notch and Hedgehog pathways,
  respectively, and their activation is crucial for maintaining cellular stemness.
  In the Wnt pathway, FOXO is subjected to redox regulation, affecting the transcription
  of β-catenin. The TGF-β pathway is also implicated in cellular stemness. c The redox
  signaling pathways regulate extracellular signaling pathways. TGF-β and integrins
  respectively modulate the activation of p38 and ERK, thereby regulating the proliferation
  and survival of tumor cells. The Hippo signaling pathway is regulated by adherens
  junctions, tight junctions, and CRB, which prevent nuclear translocation by binding
  to phosphorylated YAP. GPCRs and integrins can regulate the actin cytoskeleton,
  and inhibit the process of the Hippo kinase core, thereby reducing YAP phosphorylation,
  promoting its nuclear translocation, and regulating organ size, cell survival, and
  proliferation'
