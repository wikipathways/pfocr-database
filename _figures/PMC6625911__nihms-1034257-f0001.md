caption: The role of CaMKK2 and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) within the bone
  microenvironment. In pre-adipocytes, CaMKK2 inhibits differentiation by maintaining
  Pref-1 and Sox9 expression via the activation of AMPK. Sox9 inhibits transcription
  of early adipogenic transcription factors CEBPβ and CEBPδ, which in turn reduce
  expression of CEBPα and PPARγ. Thus, inhibition of CaMKK2 would relieve Sox9 mediated
  repression of adipogenic gene transcription to promote adipogenesis. In osteoprogenitors,
  CaMKK2-CaMKIV signaling antagonizes the cAMP-PKA pathway as a checkpoint mechanism
  during MSC differentiation to OBs. Under homeostatic conditions, the CaMKK2-CaMKIV
  signaling cascade inhibits the production cAMP by adenylyl cyclase (AC), which is
  required for activation of PKA and the subsequent phosphorylation of CREB, a transcriptional
  activator of osteogenic gene expression. Inhibition of CaMKK2 would relieve this
  inhibition of PKA signaling to promote OB differentiation. In OC precursors CaMKK2-CaMKIV
  signaling leads to phosphorylation of CREB and upregulation and autoamplification
  of NFATc1 to drive OC differentiation. Additionally, in macrophages CaMKK2 regulates
  TLR4 mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement and cytokine production through an unknown
  mechanism. Additionally, accumulation of AGEs in bone tissue can exert pressures
  on bone cell differentiation and survival. AGEs inhibit osteogenic differentiation
  and, in OBs and osteocytes, AGE-RAGE signaling stimulates production of ROS and
  promotes expression of pro-apoptotic factors through activation of NFκB. On the
  other hand, AGE-RAGE mediated activation of NFκB promotes OC differentiation and
  survival.
