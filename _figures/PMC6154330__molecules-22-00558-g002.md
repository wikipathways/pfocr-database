caption: 'Comparing the assimilation pathways of: sulfur (left); and selenium (right),
  in plants of the genus Allium. After absorption of the sulfate and the selenate
  in the roots, these are transported to the leaves via apoplast (1); in the plastids
  are reduced to sulfide and selenide respectively. The first step is the activation
  of the molecule 5′AMP, by the action of the enzyme ATP Sulfurylase (3), encoded
  in Allium by the ATPS gene in the S pathway, and by the APS gene and isoforms in
  the Se pathway, forming 5′-adenosinphosphosulfate (APS) and APSe respectively. From
  these compounds arise the so-called primary route and secondary route or pathway
  of sulfation. In the primary route, APS (4) is reduced to sulfite (SO32−) and APSe
  to selenite (SeO32−) by APS reductase, which is encoded by the APSR gene in the
  S pathway and by the APS gene in the Se route. Subsequently, the sulfite and selenite
  are converted to sulfide and selenide, by the action of sulfite reductase, encoded
  by the SiR gene in the path of S. The gene encoding this enzyme in the Se pathway
  is not yet known. Subsequently, sulfide and selenide will be incorporated into the
  skeleton of acetyl serine by the enzymatic complex cysteine synthase (6), formed
  by the acetyl serine transferase and O-acetylserinatiolase, resulting in the formation
  of cysteine or selenocysteine. In Allium, the genes encoding this enzymatic complex
  are BASAS1 for the S and GCS pathway, along with their isoforms. For the Se path,
  it is thought to be similar to that reported in arabidopsis, where the genes CS26,
  CYSC1, CYSD1, CYSD2, DES1, OASA1, OASA2, OASB, and OASC participate. The amino acids
  cysteine and selenocysteine are the starting point of various metabolic pathways
  such as the formation of dimethyldisulfide by the methylation of Cys or dimethyl
  diselenide by the methylation of SeCys (7), incorporation into proteins (8) and
  formation of glutathione (GSH) in the S pathway and the sulfoxide Se-allyl-l-cysteine
  in Se (9). From the GSH the sulfoxides are synthesized, which originate thiosulfinates,
  volatile compounds characteristic of Allium, as well as the formation of hydrogen
  sulfide by the enzyme desulfhydrase and seleniuric acid (10), or the synthesis of
  the amino acid methionine, or its equivalent, selenium methionine, by the action
  of the enzyme methionine synthase, encoded for both elements by the MS gene in arabidopsis
  (11). From methionine, dimethylsulfide propionate (DMSP) or DMSeP can be obtained
  using the enzyme methionine methyltransferase, which is encoded by the HMT gene
  for S and by the MMT gene for Se, hence the synthesis of dimethyl sulfide DMS or
  DMSe which are volatile compounds (13). In the secondary or sulfation route, phosphoadenosine
  phosphosulfate (PAPS) is synthesized from APS, catalyzed by the enzyme sulfotransferase
  (2), resulting in sulfonated compounds such as glucosinolates (2). This secondary
  route has not been observed for Se.'
