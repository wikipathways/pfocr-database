caption: Schematic representation of proteins regulating MTs and actin in a migrating
  post-mitotic neuron. In general, MT regulating proteins are shown in green, and
  actin regulating proteins are shown in orange. Disruption of cytoskeletal proteins
  and their regulatory pathways leads to various consequences. Mutations in MAPs (Dcx,
  Dclk, Tau, Map2, Map1b), which stabilize MTs, can impair polarization, formation
  of the leading process, neurite outgrowth and/or lead to excessive branching that
  hinders migration. Lis1/Ndel1/dynein are required for nuclear movement during migration.
  Molecular motors, such as dynein and kinesins, serve important roles in migration
  by transporting cargo in opposite directions along MTs, or by transporting MTs themselves.
  Mutations in components of the reelin pathway lead to impaired migration, interactions
  with RG cells and final positioning of neurons via impaired regulation of cytoskeletal
  dynamics. Actin plays complex roles in the growth cone and trailing processes of
  migrating neurons, with mutations in regulatory pathways leading to overmigration
  or migration arrest, which may be consequential to progenitor defects observed in
  various rodent models.
