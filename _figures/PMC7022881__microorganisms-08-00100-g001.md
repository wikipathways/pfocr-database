caption: Two signaling pathways that respond to extracellular glucose in Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae. (A) The cAMP-PKA pathway. The membrane protein Gpr1 serves as a receptor
  for extracellular glucose and stimulates activation of Gpa2, which in turn stimulates
  adenylyl cyclase Cyr1. Ras responds to glucose-stimulated intracellular acidification
  and also stimulates Cyr1. Cellular levels of cAMP were determined by the competing
  activities of synthesis from ATP via Cyr1 and degradation to AMP by phosphodiesterases,
  Pde1, and Pde2. A high level of cAMP activates PKA by binding to the regulatory
  subunits Bcy1 which releases the catalytic subunits Tpk1, 2, 3. Additionally, Gpa2
  can activate PKA by inhibiting Gpb1, 2, which inhibits PKA and promotes ubiquitin-dependent
  proteolysis of Ira2. The active PKA suppresses the stress response and stimulates
  growth. (B) The Snf3/Rgt2-Rgt1 pathway. High and low levels of extracellular glucose
  are sensed by the membrane-spanning proteins Rgt2 and Snf3, respectively. Glucose
  binds to the glucose receptors Snf3 and Rgt2 and stimulates the Yck kinases that
  phosphorylate Std1 and Mth1. The phosphorylated Std1 and Mth1 are then degraded
  by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Without corepressors Std1 and Mth1, Rgt1 does
  not repress the expression of genes such as HXTs, etc.
