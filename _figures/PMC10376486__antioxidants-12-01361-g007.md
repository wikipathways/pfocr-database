caption: 'The pathway of cysteine, from methionine in the liver to GSH in the lung.
  In the liver, the state of oxidation of MAT determines its activity. When in a reduced
  state (MATRed), MAT catalyzes the limiting reaction in the transmethylation pathway,
  which ultimately leads to the synthesis of cysteine from methionine. Cysteine is
  the limiting substrate in GSH synthesis. GSH is exported from the liver by MRP in
  the hepatocyte membrane. In plasma, GSH is transported to extra-hepatic tissues
  containing γGT, such as the lungs. γGT breaks down GSH into cysteinylglycine and
  γ-glutamyl-amino acid, which are further broken down by membrane dipeptidases and
  imported by amino acid transporters, both represented by the blue circle. Once inside
  the pneumocytes, the amino acids can act as substrates for GSH synthesis. The oxidation
  of liver MAT blocks this interorgan pathway. GSH: glutathione; γGT: γ-glutamyl transpeptidase;
  MAT: methionine-adenosyltransferase; MRP: multidrug resistance protein.'
