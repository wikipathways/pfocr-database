caption: Proposed model for the role of the Rb/E2F pathway in the coordination of
  proliferation and differentiation during neurogenesis. I, In an uncommitted progenitor
  and in the absence of active Rb, high E2F levels control cell proliferation while
  repressing Dlx gene expression to prevent premature differentiation and depletion
  of the progenitor pool. When activated, Rb inhibits E2F activity to trigger cell
  cycle exist and simultaneously initiate differentiation of progenitor cells via
  the full induction of the Dlx1/Dlx2 genes. II, In Rb-null mice, the level(s) of
  repressor E2Fs, such as E2F7 (an Rb-independent repressor) or E2F4 along with other
  pocket proteins e.g., p107, are deregulated which could interfere with the transcription
  of key differentiation genes such as Dlx2 and Dlx1, thus impairing differentiation
  and migration in the developing brain.
