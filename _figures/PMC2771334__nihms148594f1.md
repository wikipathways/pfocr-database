caption: Dual role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in regulating synaptic plasticity.
  The diagram on the left depicts the critical role of constitutively expressed TNF-α
  in regulation of homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the normal brain. Decreased
  neuronal activity and consequently reduced glutamate release from axons is sensed
  by glia, which triggers release of TNF-α. TNF-α activates neuronal TNF-α receptors
  type I (TNFR1) leading to activation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway
  and up-regulation of specific adhesion molecule-β3 integrin, which in turn triggers
  α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor insertion to
  the membrane and increases synaptic strength. The diagram on the right depicts the
  various signalling cascades initiated by high pathophysiological levels of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines in the brain by activated microglia, which might underlie at least some
  aspects of the pathophysiology of depression. (1) TNF-α and IL-1 trigger production
  of quinolinic acid and release of glutamate by microglia; (2) TNF-α and IL-1 inhibit
  glutamate removal by astrocytes, leading to excess extracellular glutamate and neurotoxicity;
  (3) TNF-α acts via TNFR1 to up-regulate membrane expression of Ca-permeable AMPA
  receptor subunits, thus leading to increased Ca2+ influx and neuronal death; (4)
  TNFR1 activation coupled to activation of p38 and NF-κB pathways inhibits the early
  and late phases of LTP. These effects of pathophysiological levels of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines on synaptic plasticity at both morphological and functional levels might
  underlie the cognitive disturbances and impairments of memory seen in patients with
  depression.
