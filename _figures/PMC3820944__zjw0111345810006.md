caption: Representative Tyr phosphorylation sites affected by erlotinib in the EGFR
  and ErbB2 canonical pathways. The proteins are colored according to their association
  with the different pathways. Other known undetected members are indicated to complement
  the pathways. Even though ErbB3 is reported as an ErbB2 signaling pathway member,
  it is colored gray to avoid confusion. Only EGFR-ErbB2 and EGFR-ErbB3 heterodimers
  are represented for clarity. Arrows representing selected known interactions between
  proteins (black) and ErbB's phosphosites and adapter (blue) are indicated.
