caption: Potential mechanisms of therapeutic synergy between epigenetic modulation
  and PD-1 pathway blockade. Epigenetic modulation, originally tested in lung cancer
  based on its capacity to induce expression of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor
  genes, also has significant immunologic activity. Treatment of lung cancer cells
  with the DNA-demethylating agent 5-azacytidine (AZA) can induce the type I IFN pathway
  as well as multiple components of antigen presentation, thereby enhancing intratumoral
  inflammatory responses. However, PD-L1 is also induced on tumor cells, which could
  blunt immunity. Concomitant blockade of the PD-1 pathway would shift the balance
  such that the immune-enhancing effects of epigenetic modulation would dominate.
  DNA demethylation also induces expression of cancer–testes (C-T) antigens, which
  are known targets for tumor-specific T cells. Finally, epigenetic modulation can
  activate silenced effector cytokine genes in anergized T cells and induce PD-1 expression.
  Again, concomitant PD-1 pathway blockade would favor the immune-enhancing effects
  of epigenetic modulators on T cells. These potential mechanisms of synergy may account
  for recent preliminary clinical observations in 5 patients with NSCLC treated with
  either anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies after receiving a combination of 5-azacytodine
  and entinostat (a class 1-specific HDACi); durable objective responses were observed
  in 3 patients and stable disease for more than 6months in the other two patients.
  This combination approach is a potential example of leveraging the immunologic effects
  of "nonimmunologic" therapies.
