caption: Ubiquitination in cellular processes of cGAS-STING Pathway. Exogenous dsDNA
  released from cancer cell, cell death, virus, bacteria and endogenous dsDNA released
  from mitochondria are easily recognized by intracellular cGAS, which promotes the
  cGAS-STING-TBK1 signaling pathway and releases IFN I to elicit innate immune response.
  The ubiquitination of different ubiquitinating enzymes to different sites of cGAS
  and STING in different organelles is listed in the figure; the ubiquitination of
  cGAS and STING promotes or inhibits the activation and degradation of cGAS and STING,
  which affects the innate immune response of the cGAS-STING pathway in cells. However,
  in the nucleus, TRIM41 and CLR5 also cause ubiquitination of cGAS, which restricts
  L1 retrotransposition as well as degradation of cGAS via the ubiquitin protease
  hydrolysis system. Image created with BioRender.com, with permission
