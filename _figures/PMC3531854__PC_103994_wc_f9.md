caption: A Model for the Functional Interaction of COP1, FHY3, and HY5 in UV-B–Induced
  Photomorphogenesis.Under photomorphogenic UV-B, UVR8 monomerizes and interacts with
  COP1, triggering downstream signaling, including HY5-regulated gene expression,
  which is repressed by RUPs. COP1 is a UV-B–inducible gene. FHY3 and HY5 bind to
  the  motif and the  element in the COP1 promoter, respectively, and activate COP1
  transcription. This transcriptional modulation ensures more active UVR8-COP1-HY5
  core pathway. Red arrows, positive regulation in the core pathway; blue arrows,
  positive regulation in UV-B–mediated gene induction; black bar, negative regulation.
