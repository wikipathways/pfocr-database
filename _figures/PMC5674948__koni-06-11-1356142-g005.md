caption: Summary of age, BMI, and differential correlation results (a) BMI and age
  independently increase inflammation in adjacent normal tissue (arrow). Older age
  is associated with larger increases in ESR1 expression in tumors (arrow). Larger
  increases in estrogen levels from adjacent normal to tumor are inversely associated
  with tumor macrophage scores (dotted line). (b,c) Differential correlation pathway
  summary, where solid lines indicate direct correlation and dotted lines indicate
  inverse correlation in either (b) adjacent normal or (c) ER-positive tumors. Node
  color indicates relative expression levels compared with adjacent normal (gray),
  where red indicates increased and blue indicates decreased expression. Individual
  genes emblematic of the pathway are noted on the figure.
