caption: Intracellular trafficking pathways of TLR4 and TRAM. In unstimulated cells,
  TLR4 is present in the plasma membrane, Golgi apparatus and the ERC, whereas its
  adaptor protein TRAM is located in the ensosomes, the plasma membrane and Golgi
  apparatus. (I) After activation by LPS, TLR4 is internalized and translocates to
  Rab5- and EEA1-positive early endosomes where it interacts with TRAM and TRIF and
  initiates the TRIF-dependent signaling. (II) The association of TRAM with TLR4 and
  the activation of the TRIF-dependent pathway is sustained during maturation of early
  endosomes to Rab7a- or Rab7b-positive late endosomes. In late endosomes TMED7 and
  TAG disrupt the TRIF—TRAM interaction and facilitate termination of the signaling.
  (III) In early endosomes, Hrs and ESCRT recognize ubiquitinated TLR4 and sort it
  for degradation in late endosomes/MVB and lysosomes. (IV) TLR4 degradation and signaling
  can be regulated by proteins involved in the functioning of the endo-lysosomal compartment,
  like Lyst, GMFG, Rab7a and Rab7b, and Vps33B. (V) Upon stimulation with LPS, the
  intracellular TLR4 originally associated with the Golgi apparatus is transported
  via Rab10-positive endosomes to the plasma membrane. (VI) The intracellular pool
  of TLR4 derived from the ERC can trigger the TRIF-dependent signaling at the phagosome
  membrane. Both TLR4 and TRAM are transported to the phagosome membrane with a contribution
  from Rab11. (VII) Possible intracellular transport of TRAM in Rab11-positive vesicles
  to the early endosomes. It is unknown whether the well-established protein trafficking
  pathway from the early endosomes to the Golgi apparatus (dashed gray arrow) can
  be used by TLR4
