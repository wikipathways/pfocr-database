caption: The lignin synthesis pathway map. The color scale represents the module-trait
  correlation from −3 (purple) to 3 (orange). The color bar indicates the expression
  and correlation levels from low (purple) to high (orange). The place includes the
  secondary xylem (blue) and phloem (tender green). The year represents the different
  stages of development, including 1-year-old (red), 2-year-old (purple), and 3-year-old
  (grass green)
