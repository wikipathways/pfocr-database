caption: Three Gli proteins transduce the hedgehog signal. In the absence of hedgehog,
  the pathway repressor Gli3 is produced after ubiquitination and cleavage by the
  proteasome. This process requires protein kinase A, GSK3β, Casein kinase Iε, and
  the E3 ligase β-TrCP. Gli2 is also acted upon by β-TrCP and the same set of kinases,
  but is fully degraded rather than cleaved by the proteasome. Both the formation
  of the Gli3 repressor and the destruction of Gli2 are inhibited by Shh. Transcriptional
  activators Gli1 and Gli2 are degraded by a separate pathway that is also mediated
  by β-TrCP. At this time, it is unclear whether this destruction process is reversed
  by hedgehog addition. Several studies have also identified other E3 ligases, such
  as Speckle type Poz Protein, and degrons have whose function is still unclear. These
  studies have suggested a possible independent nuclear role for the proteasome in
  controlling Gli activator and repressor levels.
