caption: 'Representative protein-protein interaction networks of key pathways and
  proteins involved in sperm functions. A, annotation of the acetylated proteins by
  protein-protein network and pathway enrichment. The two significantly enriched pathways
  in the ATP synthase network were: (a) respiratory electron transport, ATP synthesis
  by chemiosmotic coupling, and heat production by uncoupling proteins (REACT_6305
  reactome) and (b) formation of ATP by chemiosmotic coupling (REACT_6759 reactome).
  The two significantly enriched pathways of the VDAC2 network were (a) Huntington
  disease, H. sapiens (human) path:hsa05016 KEGG and (b) Parkinson disease, H. sapiens
  (human) path:hsa05012 KEGG. Green color represents pathway a enrichment, and yellow
  color represents pathway b. Red color indicates enrichments in both pathways a and
  b. Gray color indicates the interactive proteins that were not enriched in the designated
  pathways. B, protein-protein interaction networks of the highlighted functional
  human sperm proteins in . Green color represents proteins identified in the present
  acetylproteome analysis, whereas gray color indicates proteins that were not identified.'
