caption: Mitochondria and the autophagy machinery are essential for neuronal function
  and health. Mitochondria are not only the major source of cellular energy but also
  a signaling nexus for metabolites and modulating redox status and the bioenergetic
  health may be used as biomarkers for disease prognosis and response to thereapeutics.
  Because of the high demand of cellular energy and the high content of fatty acids
  in neurons, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species can be generated intracellularly,
  as well as from neighboring glia cells, or even due to exposure to environmental
  toxins. Metabolic regulation of redox signaling, mitochondrial function and autophagy
  is of importance in the central nervous system via pathways including but not limited
  to glycolysis, hexoamine biosynthesis, and fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, protein
  homeostasis, as represented by α-synuclein and tau homeostasis is important for
  Parkinson’s disease. α-synuclein can target to and inhibit mitochondrial function,
  and itself is subject to HNE modification and nitration. Autophagy is a major pathway
  for α-synuclein degradation and the clearance of damaged mitochondria, but is also
  targeted by proteotoxic proteins including α-synuclein, tau and LRRK2. In this review,
  we highlight the evidence of how mitochondria are targeted by proteotoxic, redox
  and metabolic stress, while maintained by the autophagic surveillance. These areas
  present opportunities to better understand Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis and
  potential for development of effective therapies.
