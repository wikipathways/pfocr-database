caption: During canonical RNAi (lower right), siRISC recognizes a perfectly complementary
  mRNA, leading to Ago-catalyzed mRNA cleavage at a single site within the duplex.
  After cleavage, functional siRISC is regenerated, whereas the mRNA fragments are
  further degraded. siRNAs are also capable of recognizing targets with imperfect
  complementarity (upper right). In some cases, they can silence targets by miRNA-like
  mechanisms involving translational repression and exonucleolytic degradation, though
  the frequency with which natural siRNAs use these pathways is not clear. Finally,
  siRISC can direct heterochromatin formation (left) by associating with nascent transcripts
  and RNA polymerases (RNA Pol II in S. pombe and RNA Pol IV/V in A. thaliana). In
  plants, target engagement leads to the association or activation of a DNA methyltransferase
  (DMT) that methylates the DNA (lower left), leading to heterochromatin formation.
  In S. pombe and probably in animals (upper left), the pathway involves a histone
  methyltransferase (HMT) that methylates Lys9 of histone H3 (data not shown), thereby
  inducing heterochromatinization. In most eukaryotes other than insects and mammals,
  target recognition by siRISC induces the synthesis of secondary dsRNAs and siRNAs
  by RdRP enzymes (lower middle). The secondary dsRNAs are processed by Dicer into
  siRNAs, which add to the pool of siRISC. In nematodes, many of the secondary siRNAs
  arise as single-stranded, unprimed transcripts with 5′-triphosphates and do not
  require Dicer processing.
