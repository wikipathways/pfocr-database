caption: A Pollination occurred at anthesis, then the pollen tubes were observed at
  1 DPA, while fertilization markers were detected from 2 DAP onward. Cell number
  and length increased significantly from 6 to 10 DAP, and from 10 to 12 DAP, leading
  to fruit set at 12 DAP. Since exploratory RNA-seq suggested intense gene variation
  in IAA pathway, we explored the expression of auxin-related genes. From 0 to 2 DAP
  and from 2 to 6 DAP the expression of the auxin biosynthetic genes VvYUCCA10 and
  TAR2 decreased, respectively, possibly as the auxin response had already been triggered,
  which is consistent with the increase in the expression of the auxin-responsive
  genes VvGH3.5, VvSAUR50, and VvIAA11 from 2 to 6 DAP. The gene VvGH3.5 encodes a
  putative amido synthetase, which could also contribute to the control of the IAA
  levels after the auxin response activation. Dynamic metabolism of auxin is revealed
  by the presence of IPyA and IAM precursors, and the conjugates IAA-Asp, IAA-Glu,
  and OxIAA-Glu from pollination to fruit set. B When the auxin response inhibitor
  IAA-Trp was applied at 1 DAP, cell number and length decreased at 12 DAP compared
  with control fruits, and the expression of VvYUCCA10 was higher, which suggests
  that the auxin response inhibition might be counteracted with more auxin production.
  C A similar effect occurred when pistils remained unpollinated, where fruit set
  was even more impaired. Integrating A, B, and C, we propose that most of the fruit
  sizing effect of pollination is mediated by auxin during the grapevine fruit formation.
  Numbers within the fruits indicate the time after pollination (0, 1, 2, 6, 10, and
  12 days after pollination, DAP)
