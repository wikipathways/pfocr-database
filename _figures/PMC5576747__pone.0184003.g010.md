caption: 'Honokiol targets on the mitochondrial respiratory electron transport chain
  C I inducing ROS production (mainly O2·−) and mitochondria dysfunction. ROS induces
  mtDNA damage, mtΔψ decrease, oxidation of proteins and lipids. The transcriptome
  indicates that the cellular stress response increases including increased protein
  import to mitochondria, upregulate the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes, remove
  oxidized proteins by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome system. Mitochondrial dysfunction
  in C. albicans is associated with loss of cell wall integrity. (1) affect the activity
  of wall synthesis enzymes in plasma membrane; (2) impinge on GPI anchor synthesis;
  (3)activation of cell wall integrity pathway upon cell wall stress. mtΔψ: mitochondrial
  membrane potential.'
