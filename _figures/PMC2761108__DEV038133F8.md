caption: The roles of BMP signaling pathways during SNS development. Both  Smad4-dependent
  and -independent pathways are involved in SNS development. The  Smad4-independent
  pathway activates the paired homeobox factor Phox2b, which  regulates the survival
  of precursors and the expressions of bHLH factor Hand2  and zinc finger factor Gata3.
  The Smad4-dependent pathway is not required for  Ascl1 gene activation but is required
  for continued expression. Ascl1  regulates proliferation of neuroblasts but not
  their noradrenergic  differentiation. Both pathways converge to regulate noradrenergic  differentiation
  of sympathetic neurons.
