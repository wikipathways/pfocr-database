caption: 'TCL1A functions as a pleiotropic adapter molecule in stemness and survival
  signaling. Note that “roles” and “modes of actions” at various levels (e.g., cell
  function, impacted pathway, concise molecular interaction) are highlighted and are
  in part artificially separated (i.e., E part of C and D): (A) in murine blastomeres,
  Tcl1a is important in early proliferation, as Tcl1a−/− mice show a block of blastomere
  development at the 8-cell stage []; (B) Tcl1a regulated hair growth, as shown by
  hair loss in Tcl1a−/− mice. Tcl1a is expressed in the bulge cells (stem cell niche)
  and in the secondary hair germ/transit-amplifying (TA) cells (proliferative structure)
  during the catagen–telogen (resting phase) transition and early anagen stage (regeneration
  phase). In Tcl1a−/− mice, the bulge cells show reduced expression of the stem cell
  marker CD34. Furthermore, a Tcl1a knockout led to reduced proliferation of TA cells,
  needed for new hair formation []; (C) upregulation of Tcl1a leads to metabolic shifts
  toward aerobic glycolysis via activation of Akt and repression of Pnpt1, thereby
  contributing to pluripotency of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) []; (D) in
  cells of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL),
  TCL1A increases the responsiveness to B-cell receptor (BCR) and T-cell receptor
  (TCR) stimulation, respectively, by a kinase activating effect [,,]; (E) interaction
  of the TCL1A homodimer with AKT molecules leads to augmented trans-phosphorylation
  and catalytic activity of the oncogenic Ser/Thr kinase AKT, resulting in increased
  survival signaling []; (F) the interaction of TCL1A with AP-1 components—namely,
  JUN, JUNB, and FOS, leads to impaired AP-1 signaling and thereby sustained anti-apoptotic
  signals []; (G) TCL1A interacts with IκB and mediates its phosphorylation via ATM,
  leading to its subsequent ubiquitination-dependent degradation. Inhibition of this
  negative regulator IκB causes increased NF-κB signaling, which is additionally strengthened
  by the TCL1A-p300 interaction []; (H) physical interaction of TCL1A with DNMT3A
  reduces the methyltransferase activity of DNMT3A, which leads to a higher number
  of hypomethylated genomic regions [], which is implicated in the pathogenesis of
  CLL []. This figure was created using BioRender.com (accessed on 22 October 2021).'
