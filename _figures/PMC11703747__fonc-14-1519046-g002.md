caption: Cellular metabolic pathway involving GOT1. The expression of GOT1 is regulated
  by HIF-1α and ETC, which affects Asp synthesis and nucleotide production in cancer
  cells. Mutant KRAS and ziprasidone regulate the expression of GOT1, which influence
  NADPH production, oxidative stress, and Gln metabolism. GOT1 participates in glycolysis
  upon glucose deprivation. GOT1 participates in epigenetic regulation through lysine
  acetylation and deacetylation. GOT1 is involved in hematopoietic stem cell and T
  cell function, as well as T cell, macrophage, and adipocyte differentiation
