caption: 'Some p53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4 signaling pathways mediating PC mentioned in
  this review. P53 is a crucial tumor suppressor gene. The figure illustrates its
  three most common mutation forms. It influences the metabolism, metastasis, and
  proliferation of tumor cells through downstream signaling molecules. It interacts
  with the KRAS signaling pathway through hnRNPK and CREB and with CDKN2A via CD21.
  Mutated CDKN2A generates the p16 biomarker, which affects genomic stability and
  cell proliferation through cyclins and Rb. SMAD4 affects cell proliferation by regulating
  the expression of genes related to TGF-β in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, it impacts
  the cell glycolysis process via PGK1 and influences cell proliferation and tumor
  growth. “↑” indicates activation, stimulation or promotion, whereas “⊥” indicates
  inhibition, suppression or decrease. Abbreviations: TGF-β, transforming growth factor
  β; SMAD, small mothers against decapentaplegic homolog; PGK1, phosphoglycerate kinase
  1; CDKN2A, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 A; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase;
  CREB, cAMP response element binding protein; FOXA1, forkhead box A1; hnRNPK, heterogeneous
  nuclear ribonucleoprotein K; Rb, retinoblastoma protein. The figure was created
