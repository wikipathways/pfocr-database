caption: Activation of the cGAS-STING pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by
  various stimuli, including radiotherapy. Radiofrequency ablation, cell death, radiation,
  and nanomedicine can induce the release of mitochondrial DNA and/or dsDNA. This
  dsDNA binds to cGAS, leading to the production of cGAMP. cGAMP acts as a second
  messenger, activating STING localized in the ER. Activated STING translocates to
  the Golgi apparatus, where it recruits and activates TBK1 and IKK. TBK1 phosphorylates
  IRF3, leading to its dimerization and translocation to the nucleus, where it induces
  the expression of IFN. IKK phosphorylates IκB, leading to its degradation and the
  release of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB).
  NF-κB also translocates to the nucleus and induces the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. IFN released from the tumor cells can act in an autocrine or paracrine
  manner to upregulate MHC-I expression, promoting antigen presentation to CD8+ T
  cells. This can lead to cross-priming and activation of anti-tumor immunity. IFN
  can also promote DC maturation, resulting in enhanced antigen presentation and T
  cell activation. Additionally, IFN can reduce the number of regulatory T cells (Treg
  cells) and MDSC cells, which suppress anti-tumor immunity. These processes collectively
  contribute to the anti-tumor immune response and enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy
  in HCC
