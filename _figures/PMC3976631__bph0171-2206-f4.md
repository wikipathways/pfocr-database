caption: 'Mitochondrial regulation of calcium clearance: a point of convergence for
  retrograde and anterograde signalling. (A) The release of glutamate from the presynaptic
  vesicles opens postsynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDAR) to allow the influx of calcium
  (Ca) into the postsynaptic spine. This event leads to the induction of LTP. Ca will
  activate Ca/calmodulin, which, in turn, will activate (1) Ca/calmodulin kinase,
  which phosphorylates the AMPA receptors; (2) PKC; (3) tyrosine kinase; and (4) AC.
  The first three are involved in early stage LTP that is maintained by enhanced neurotransmitter
  release from the presynaptic spine via retrograde signalling. AC activates cAMP,
  which, in turn, activates cAMPK. cAMPK can either directly activate cAMP response
  element-binding protein (CREB) for the transcription of BDNF, which is involved
  in late phase LTP through the formation of new synapses, or it can activate CREB
  via the MAPK pathway. MAPK and BDNF can activate the transcription of pro-survival
  pathways. (B) The opening of NMDA receptors allow the influx of Ca into the cell,
  which is mopped up by mitochondria. As the concentration of Ca increases within
  the mitochondria, it triggers the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore (MPTP). This serves a dual purpose: (1) reducing the mitochondrial membrane
  potential, which, in turn, reduces ATP production, thus highlighting the areas that
  need the allocation of glucose for maintenance of LTP, and (2) releasing cytochorome
  c (Cyt c) and starting the apoptotic cascade. The release of Cyt c can be prevented
  by the transcription and release of pro-survival proteins like Bcl2; this process,
  in turn, relies on the concentration of intracellular calcium. Hence, inextricably
  linking the process of synaptic plasticity to mitochondrial energy production and
  intracellular calcium movements.'
