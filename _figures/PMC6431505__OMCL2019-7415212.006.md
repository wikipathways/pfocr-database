caption: 'A schematic graph of the proposed cardioprotective mechanism of H2 when
  rats were exposed to CIH. H2 reduced the high level of ROS by elevating SOD and
  GSH activities and decreasing NOX 2 and the MDA content. H2 inhibited ER stress
  by downregulating GRP 78, CHOP, and caspase 12 proteins. H2 decreased CIH-induced
  apoptosis via three major ER stress response pathways: PERK-eIF2α-ATF4, IRE 1-XBP1,
  and ATF 6. H2 attenuated the JNK-MAPK pathway involved in apoptosis.'
