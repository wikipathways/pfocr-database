caption: 'Reductive glycine pathway and a selection scheme for its activity in yeast.
  (A) The “metabolic engine” of the reductive glycine pathway: condensation of C1-moieties
  into the C2 compound glycine. Substructure of tetrahydrofolate (THF) is shown in
  brown. Lipoic acid attached to the H-protein of the glycine cleavage/synthase system
  (GCS) is shown in green. (B) Gene deletions (marked in red) required for the construction
  of a glycine auxotroph strain, which we used to select for glycine biosynthesis
  from the activity of the reductive glycine pathway; pathway enzymes are shown in
  green.'
