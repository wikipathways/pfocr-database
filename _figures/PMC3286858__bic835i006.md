caption: Proteins possessing an ER signal sequence are targeted to the ER and translocated
  through the Sec61 translocon (1). Properly folded proteins exit the ER and move
  along the secretory pathway. Misfolded proteins are retained by the ER quality control
  machinery (ER-QC) (2), handed over to the retrotranslocation machinery, polyubiquitinated
  and retrotranslocated (2). The retrotranslocated protein is deubiquitinated and
  deglycosylated (3) before being degraded by the proteasome. Accumulation of misfolded
  proteins in the ER lumen activates UPR signalling. ESI inhibits translocation of
  proteins across the ER membrane, leading to the production of non-translocated proteins
  (NTP) at the cytosolic face of the ER membrane. These aberrant species are degraded
  by the UPS and also activate the UPR through an unknown mechanism. ESI may also
  inhibit one or more steps of the ERAD pathway, including retrotranslocation or deubiquitination.
  Also shown are the points of action of CHX, PS2 and NSC687852 (NSC), a deubiquitinase
  inhibitor that induces accumulation of polyubiquitin in cells [].
