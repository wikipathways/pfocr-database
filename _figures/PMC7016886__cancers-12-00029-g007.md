caption: Visfatin mediates its effects both directly via cAbl/STAT3 and indirectly
  mediated by ADSCs via GDF15/AKT on promoting malignant behavior in breast cancer.
  Previously, we discovered visfatin mainly produced by adipocytes promoted breast
  cancer cells directly through activation of c-Abl and STAT3, which was blocked by
  Imatinib and Stattic inhibitor, respectively (black arrow). In this study, we showed
  that visfatin can act via an indirect pathway by priming ADSCs, which may be recruited
  from the adipose tissue to tumor site or generated from autologous fat transfer,
  to produce GDF15 that stimulated AKT activation in breast cancer cells to promote
  malignant behaviors (white arrow). The effect can be blocked by the treatment of
  GDF15 neutralizing Ab or Wortmannin inhibitor.
