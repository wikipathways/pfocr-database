caption: 'YAP/TAZ functions in metabolic heterogeneity. YAP/TAZ operate as nuclear
  and transcriptional mediators in different metabolic pathways during cancer, which
  results in increased tumor invasion, tumor progression and metastasis. (A) When
  YAP/TAZ activity is stimulated, the cell increases its glucose demand to promote
  glycolysis; the PFK1 enzyme is the coordinator of this interaction, considering
  that it regulates the stability of the union of the YAP/TAZ/TEAD complex in the
  cellular nucleus. (B) In terms of lipid metabolism, the release of free fatty acids
  induces the expression of the JCAD protein, while transcription of YAP occurs simultaneously
  through its dephosphorylation and union to the LATS2 domain. Consequently, translocation
  of YAP at the nuclear level, activation of the transcriptional module and transcription
  of target genes ensue. (C) The metabolism of mevalonate regulates the activity of
  YAP/TAZ through the production of geranyl pyrophosphate, which activates the Rho
  GTPase, which in turn dephosphorylates YAP/TAZ, promoting its accumulation in the
  cell nucleus and the transcription of its target genes. On the other hand, high
  levels of mevalonic acid boost the oncogenic activity of YAP /TAZ through the transcription
  of SREBP induced by the mutation of its cofactor p53. YAP: Yes-associated protein;
  TAZ: Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif; PFK1: Phosphofructokinase
