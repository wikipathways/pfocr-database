  transporter precursor (BT1); DBE, De-branching enzyme; FBA, fructose-bisphosphate
  aldolase; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; FK, fructokinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; GBSS, Granule bind starch synthase; GPI, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase;
  NSE, enolase; PGAM, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase;
  PGM, phosphoglucomutase; PK, pyruvate kinase; SPS, sucrose phosphate synthase; SuSy,
  Sucrose synthase; SBE, starch branching enzyme; SS, Starch synthase; PFK, 6-phosphofructokinase;
  TP, triose phosphates.'
