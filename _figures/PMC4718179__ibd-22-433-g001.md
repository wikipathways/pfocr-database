caption: Human EGCs can sense differences between pathogenic and probiotic bacteria
  in the gut. Pathogenic AIEC activate hEGC and induce cFos and MHC II. AIECs cause
  activation of the TLR/s100B-RAGE dependent iNOS-NO signaling pathway in hEGC. S100B
  release from hEGC is induced by pathogenic bacteria or by bacterial products (e.g.,
  lipopolysaccharides). EGCs can discriminate between pathogenic and probiotic (beneficial)
  bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus paracasei F19) in their recognition and activation
  of TLR. AIEC induce S100B overexpression/release and NO release from hEGC. NO release
  depends on TLR/S100B signaling. Once released, S100B interacts with RAGE, which
  is expressed on the surface of hEGC. As proposed by various studies, the S100B/RAGE
  complex may be internalized and interact, directly or not, with MyD88, a downstream
  mediator of the TLR signaling pathway, thus inducing iNOS expression and NO release,
  through induction and translocation of the nuclear factor NF-κB in hEGCs. NF-κB
  also induces S100B synthesis and release that sustains NO signaling. A common pathway
  linking S100B, RAGE, and MyD88 is suggested to be involved. Overall, enteroglial-derived
  S100B protein integrates bacterial product(s) signaling through TLRs and the RAGE-iNOS-NO
  signaling pathways in the reactive hEGC phenotype (described in detail by Turco
  et al). EGCs possess the molecular mechanisms and TLR signaling to be able to potentially
  trigger innate immune responses in the gut.
