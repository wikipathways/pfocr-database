caption: One pathogenic pathway by which high glucose in diabetes and hypertension
  work through prosclerotic growth factors to dysregulate ECM turnover. Both TGF-β
  and CTGF have been shown to induce TIMP-1 and PAI-1, resulting in reduced MMP and
  plasmin activity. This paradigm best applies to diabetic renal disease.
