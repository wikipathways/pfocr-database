caption: 'Overnutrition leads to increased gluconeogenic gene expression by altering
  gut microbiota and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production. (A) Overnutrition alters
  the composition of gut microbiota and increases LPS production along with decreased
  short chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels. Decreased SCFAs lead to the impairment of
  AMPK activity in intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in leaky gut and endotoxemia.
  (B) Elevated LPS induces acetyltransferase P300 via activation of the IRE1-XBP1
  pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in hepatocytes. Induced P300 upregulates
  gluconeogenic gene expression by directly binding to CREB, acetylating CRTC2 to
  prevent its nuclear exclusion and degradation, and driving Foxo1 gene expression.
  FOXO1 can bind to the promoter of the gluconeogenic gene to further increase gluconeogenic
  gene expression. TJ: tight junction. The solid arrows indicate the direct effects,
  and the dashed arrow indicates indirect effects.'
