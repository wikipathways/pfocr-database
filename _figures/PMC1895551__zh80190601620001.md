caption: Prosurvival signaling pathways and their downstream targets. This is a schematic
  illustration of the principal pathways that are discussed in this paper. Growth
  factors induce, or membrane-associated molecules dimerize, spontaneously to activate
  mitogen-activated protein kinases (Raf/MEK/ERK) and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.
  Transmembrane G protein–coupled receptors can activate PKC, which modulates the
  activity of Raf and MAPK pathway; both ERK1/2 and PKCα can serve as Bcl-2 kinases
  at serine 70. AKT and ERK induce phosphorylation of Bim (AKT, at serine 87 and ERK,
  at serines 55, 65, and 100), which attenuates the proapoptotic function of Bim,
  thereby promoting cell survival. Phosphorylation of Bad by MAPK (serine 112) or
  AKT (serine 136) inhibits apoptosis due to loss of the ability of Bad to heterodimerize
  with the survival proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Hence, prosurvival phosphorylation
  of Bcl-2 family proteins modulates their antiapoptotic or proapoptotic activity
  at the mitochondrial membrane. This is complemented by AKT- or MAPK-driven gene
  transcription, which includes cyclins D and E (MAPK), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
  p21, c-myc (AKT), which cause an increase in cell proliferation; and antiapoptotic
  proteins of the Bcl-2 (Mcl-1) and IAP (XIAP, survivin) families that regulate apoptosis
  at the level (Mcl-1) or downstream of mitochondria (IAPs). It is apparent that simultaneous
  activation of multiple signaling pathways might synergistically enhance prosurvival
  and proliferative potential of leukemic cells and the redundant downstream pathways
  negatively affect an ability of a particular signal transduction inhibitor to eliminate
  leukemia.
