caption: Interaction network of differentially methylated diabetic genes. Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to generate an interaction network using all the
  genes in our list and any first, second or third order interactions with other genes
  based on literature findings with specificity to the dermis, epidermis, and skin.
  Gray indicates genes that are differentially methylated in diabetic fibroblasts,
  while white represents genes that were not identified to be differentially methylated
  but interact with genes in our list.
