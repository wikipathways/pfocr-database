caption: PP-associated modulation of inflammatory chemokine production and repair-related
  processes in keratinocytes through EGFR system. (A) Cytoplasmic EGFR-regulated pathways.
  Pathway 1 connected with direct activation of EGFR by ligands (e.g., EGF and TGF-α),
  exogenous or formed from proligands by matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) cleavage
  is inhibited by distinct PPs (red asterisks) at the levels of EGFR and ERK phosphorylation,
  which may result in the enhancement of EGFR-regulated inflammatory responses (green
  asterisks). Normally, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated inhibition of RT-PTP
  maintains EGFR in an activated state. ROS-scavenging PPs could shift the balance
  of EGFR phosphorylation-de-phosphorylation in favor of the former, thus, limiting
  P-EGFR formation (red asterisk). Cytoplasmic TGF-α-activated STAT3 pathway is insensitive
  to PPs. Cytoplasmic EGFR-regulated p38-connected pathway could be either activated
  or inhibited by PPs (red and green asterisks). Pathway 2 connected with membrane
  receptors (R) for proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ converges with Pathway
  1 at the levels of EGFR proligand cleavage by MMPs. Stimulation of R by the combination
  of TNF-α/IFN-γ activates NFκB, which target genes coding proinflammatory cytokines
  and enzymes. PPs may inhibit either NFκB or AP-1 or both transcription factors (red
  asterisks). Since maximal activation of several chemokine genes needs cooperation
  of both transcription factors, PPs inhibiting NFκB and AP-1 may be considered as
  efficient anti-inflammatory agents. (B) Nuclear pathway depends on direct translocation
  of stimulated (by ligands or in a nonligand fashion) and phosphorylated EGFR from
  cellular membrane into nucleus, where it connects with DNA-binding transcription
  factors, thus inducing gene transcription followed by adaptive response of keratinocytes.
  As a result, cells escape apoptosis and their proliferation, migration, and adhesion
  increase. Growth factors produced by keratinocytes promote angiogenesis. PPs-enhancers
  of P-EGFR accumulation in the nucleus may promote all these processes, thus, facilitating
  wound healing. Red and green asterisks correspond to PPs-associated inhibition or
  promotion of inflammatory response, respectively. PI3K, phosphoinositol-3-kinase;
  RT-PTP, receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase.
