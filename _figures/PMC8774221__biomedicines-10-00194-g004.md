caption: Schematic representation of glucocorticoid receptor β (GRβ) contribution
  in hepatic lipid deposition. GRβ overexpression induces both the inhibition of the
  PPARα-FGF21 signal pathway, decreasing β-oxidation of fatty acid, and at the same
  time is involved in inflammatory process establishment by the secretion of TNF-α
  and upregulation of iNOS protein expression. This condition leads to further lipid
  deposition and macrophage hepatic infiltration.
