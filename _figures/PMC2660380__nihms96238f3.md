caption: Ligation of LPA to its G-protein-coupled receptors induces phosphorylation
  of EGF-R through PKCδ, Lyn kinase, MMP, and pro-HB-EGF pathway. PLD2 and PKCζ are
  involved in LPA-induced transactivation of EGF-R; however, the relationship between
  PLD2 and PKCδ or between PKCζ and Lyn kinase are unclear. Erk1/2 and C/EBPβ are
  downstream targets of EGF-R transactivation, which regulate cell proliferation and
  gene expression.
