caption: PIM/LAM biosynthetic pathway. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is converted to PIMs
  via substitution with up to six mannose units by mannosyltransferases, some of which
  have been identified. The sequence of reactions converting PIM1 to AcPIM2 may be
  flexible. PIM2, PIM4, and PIM6 can be substituted with one or two additional acyl
  groups. The underlined species accumulate as metabolic end products in wild-type
  M. smegmatis. AcPIM4 is modified by the α(1→2) mannosyltransferase PimE to form
  the higher PIMs and is thought to be hyperextended by α(1→6) mannosyltransferases
  to form LM, which is further extended with branched arabinans to form LAM. Thus,
  AcPIM4 is the likely bifurcation point of LM/LAM and polar PIM synthesis. The role
  of LpqW is unclear, but its loss leads to a decrease in LM/LAM biosynthesis.
