caption: (A) The NF‐κB pathway. Multiple signals, such as proinflammatory cytokines
  or growth factors, can induce NF‐κB activation. Following the ligand‐receptor binding,
  the activation of the IKK complex releases NF‐κB (RelA–p50 complex) from its inhibitor
  IκB. This is achieved through the phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation
  of the inhibitor. Then, NF‐κB translocates to the nucleus and induces the expression
  of target genes, including p62. (B) Two mechanisms of p62‐mediated NF‐κB activation.
  First, p62 seems to be required for NEMO ubiquitination by TRAF6. This ubiquitination
  is recognized by the NEMO subunits of other IKK complexes, bringing them into the
  close proximity required for their cross‐phosphorylation and activation. Second,
  p62 promotes the autophagic degradation of the ubiquitin‐editing enzyme A20, which
  otherwise inhibits NF‐κB activation by promoting RIP1 degradation and reversing
  NEMO ubiquitination.
