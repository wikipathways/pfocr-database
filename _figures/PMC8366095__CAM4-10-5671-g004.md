caption: Patterns of referrals to tertiary centers in Southern California. Survey
  participants were asked to which Southern California tertiary cancer center they
  most frequently refer their patients (if based at a tertiary center, participants
  were instructed to select a site outside their own). Participants are mapped geographically
  by the zip code of their practice (red pin =single respondent, red circle =cluster
  of respondents; the encircled numerical value denotes the number of respondents
  within the cluster). Colored arrows indicate referrals from practitioners to tertiary
  centers; multiple instances of the same referral pathway are denoted in parentheses.
