caption: Model summarizing current understanding of gonadotropin hormone receptor
  post-endocytic pathways and receptor signaling from VEEs. The trafficking of FSHR
  and LHR to the VEE is inextricably linked to the receptor's signal output, whereby
  the manipulation of which at distinct steps results in different trafficking and
  signal profiles. (A) Following ligand-activation FSHR internalizes to the very early
  endosome (VEE). The VEE differs from the early endosome (EE) in its smaller size
  and neither contain EEA1 nor Rab5, classical markers for the EE. During receptor-mediated
  endocytosis of FSHR into a clathrin-coated pit, the PDZ domain protein, GIPC, is
  recruited at the cytosolic interface of the GPCR. Receptor then enters the complex
  endosomal network where it is primarily localized to the VEE. There are two types
  of VEE depicted, one contains the adaptor protein, APPL1 (see text), and one is
  without. GIPC dissociates before FSHR enters the VEE. From the VEE receptor is able
  to elicit downstream signaling cascades, including cAMP generation and ERK1/2 activation.
  This cAMP/PKA signal phosphorylates APPL1 on Serine 410. Receptor is trafficked
  to APPL1 positive VEEs, where the unphosphorylated APPL1 negatively regulates endosomal
  cAMP signaling. The phosphorylated APPL1 is required for receptor recycling back
  to the plasma membrane. (B) The receptor can be rerouted from the VEE to the EE
  by the loss of GIPC or disruptions in the receptors ability to interact with this
  PDZ protein. Loss of GIPC results in the trafficking of the receptor from the VEE
  pathway to the EE and loss of plasma membrane recycling. While endosomal cAMP signaling
  is not affected, ERK signaling profile is more transient as the receptor only rapidly
  passes through the VEE to the EE. (C) Loss of APPL1 does not alter the endosomal
  organization of the receptor but inhibits recycling. The “trapped” receptor in the
  VEE compartment results in increases in endosomal cAMP signaling due to APPL1's
  role in negative regulation of G protein signaling, but without impacting ERK signal
  profile. (D) Manipulating the ability of APPL1 to be phosphorylated on Serine 410,
  either by inhibition of PKA activity or mutation of serine 410 to alanine, specifically
  inhibits recycling but not cAMP endosomal signaling.
