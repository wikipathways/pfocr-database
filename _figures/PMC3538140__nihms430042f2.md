caption: Death receptor pathway. TNF family death ligands (e.g., TNF, FAS, TRAIL)
  bind to their cognate receptors and initiate the formation of the death inducing
  signaling complex (DISC). All of the TNF family receptors which induce apoptosis
  contain a highly conserved death domain (DD) in their cytoplasmic tails. The adaptor
  protein FADD contains an N-terminal death effector domain (DED) and a C-terminal
  DD. FADD is recruited to the activated receptor by homotypic interations between
  the C-terminal DD of FADD and the DD of the receptor. Inactive caspase 8 and caspase
  10 zymogens are recruited to the DISC by homotypic interactions between the N-terminal
  DED domains of the caspases and FADD. cFLIP can be recruited to the DISC and prevents
  recruitment of caspase 8 or 10. The recruitment of caspase 8 or caspase 10 to the
  DISC results in activation of the caspases and auto-processing into the active forms
  of the caspase (reviewed in ). Activated caspase 8 or caspase 10 can directly activate
  effector caspases (e.g., caspases 3, 6, and 7). Activated caspase 8 or caspase 10
  also can cleave the BH3 only protein Bid. Cleaved Bid (tBid) translocates to the
  mitochondria where it activates the extrinsic pathway.
