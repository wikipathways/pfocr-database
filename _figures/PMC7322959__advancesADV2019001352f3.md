caption: Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in SPCs of GATA2 deficiency.
  (A-C) Results in total CD34+ HSPCs. (D-E) Results in HSCs. (A) GSEA of differentially
  expressed genes in GATA2 deficiency compared with those in healthy donors. (B) A
  network of upregulated genes in cell cycle and heme metabolism in HSPCs of GATA2
  deficiency. (C) A network of downregulated genes in B and T cell signaling and immune
  responses in HSPCs of GATA2 deficiency. (D) Lists of upregulated (top) and downregulated
  (bottom) genes in HSCs in GATA2 deficiency. (E) Networks of upregulated (top) and
  downregulated (bottom) genes in different pathways in HSCs in GATA2 deficiency.
  FDRq, false discovery rate q value; NES, normalized enrichment score.
