caption: Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (e.g., PTEN, NF1 and TP53) in GBM
  cells can increase the expression and secretion of various soluble factors through
  activation of distinct signaling pathways, which in turn recruit macrophages and
  microglia into the GBM tumor microenvironment, and then polarize them toward an
  alternatively activated phenotype in mouse and human GBM models [, , , , ]. The
