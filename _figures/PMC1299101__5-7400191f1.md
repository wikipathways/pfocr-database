caption: 'Apoptosis: the ''extrinsic'' and ''intrinsic'' pathways to caspase activation.
  Two major apoptotic pathways are illustrated: one activated via death receptor activation
  (''extrinsic'') and the other by stress-inducing stimuli (''intrinsic''). Triggering
  of cell surface death receptors of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily,
  including CD95 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-R1/-R2, results
  in rapid activation of the initiator caspase 8 after its recruitment to a trimerized
  receptor-ligand complex (DISC) through the adaptor molecule Fas-associated death
  domain protein (FADD). In the intrinsic pathway, stress-induced apoptosis results
  in perturbation of mitochondria and the ensuing release of proteins, such as cytochrome
  c, from the inter-mitochondrial membrane space. The release of cytochrome c, from
  mitochondria is regulated in part by Bcl2 family members, with anti-apoptotic (Bcl2/
  Bcl-XL/Mcl1) and pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak and tBid) members inhibiting or promoting
  the release, respectively. Once released, cytochrome c binds to apoptotic protease-activating
  factor 1 (Apaf1), which results in formation of the Apaf1–caspase 9 apoptosome complex
  and activation of the initiator caspase 9. The activated initiator caspases 8 and
  9 then activate the effector caspases 3, 6 and 7, which are responsible for the
  cleavage of important cellular substrates resulting in the classical biochemical
  and morphological changes associated with the apoptotic phenotype (reviewed in ;
  ).'
