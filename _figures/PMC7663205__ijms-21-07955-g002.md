caption: Role of PITPNM3 in cancer cell migration. CCL18 activates its PITPNM3 receptor.
  This results in signal transduction from this receptor. Pyk2 activation takes place,
  which leads to the activation of NF-κB. This transcription factor causes EMT. NF-κB
  also increases the expression of chemokines and VCAM-1, which cause the recruitment
  of TAMs in the vicinity of the tumor cell and, consequently, an even greater concentration
  of CCL18 in the vicinity of the PITPNM3 receptor. In addition to the NF-κB-dependent
  pathway, PITPNM3 causes the activation of ELMO1, which leads to changes in actin
  polymerization and tumor cell migration. At the same time, with the activation of
  Pyk2, the PI3K→Akt/PKB pathway is activated, leading to an increase in Snail expression
  and then to the EMT of tumor cells. CCL18 can also activate other signaling pathways,
  but some of them have not yet been associated with any of the receptors. CCL18 can
  activate mTOR, which leads to an increase in Slug expression. This leads to the
  EMT of tumor cells. CCL18 also causes directional migration of breast cancer cells
  by increasing ezrin acetylation by PCAF.
