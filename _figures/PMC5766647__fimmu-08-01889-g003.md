caption: Regulatory T cells are controlled by epigenetic mechanisms and T cell receptor
  (TCR) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) pathway. Histone acetylation facilitates FoxP3 gene
  expression and deacetylation inhibits gene expression. HDACi, such as butyrate,
  can lead to upregulation of the Treg-cell master regulatory gene, FoxP3, and enhance
  its function. TCR and IL-2 combined stimulation leads to PI3 kinase activation and
  subsequent downstream activation of mTOR signaling via Akt. Treg cells require lipogenic
  metabolism via the mevalonate pathway, which subsequently leads to upregulation
  of Treg-cell suppressive molecules cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)
  and ICOS in mTORC1-dependent manner. HDAC, Histone deacetylase inhibitor; PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Akt, Protein Kinase B; mTOR, mammalian target of
  rapamycin; GPCR, G protein–coupled receptor.
