caption: The known E. coli auxotrophic to tryptophan has trpC gene knocked-out (marked
  with a red X), blocking the synthesis of tryptophan from an intermediate metabolite
  in the pentose phosphate pathway. Our predictions show that if only this gene is
  knocked-out then E. coli may be able to utilize indole as a substrate to produce
  tryptophan, suggesting that a biosensor strain whose growth should depend specifically
  on the presence of tryptophan should hence also have its indole-to-tryptophan pathway
  knocked-out (marked with a green X).
