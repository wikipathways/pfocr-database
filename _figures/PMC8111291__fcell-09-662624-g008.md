caption: Schematic depicting the role of FOXC1 and DKK1 in the regulation of gastric
  cancer proliferation. FOXC1 is overexpressed in gastric cancer cells and acts as
  a transcription factor that negatively regulates DKK1 expression by binding to its
  promoter region, thereby modulating the activation state of the Wnt signaling pathway
  and upregulating expression of c-MYC, promoting the proliferation of GC cells. At
  the same time, FOXC1 also forms a complex with the unphosphorylated β-catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41)
  protein in the cytoplasm but dissociates in the nucleus.
