caption: 'Pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester synthesis proceeds either artificially by acylation
  of ACP with the monomethyl ester of pimelate or physiologically by elongation of
  a primer molecule of malonyl-CoA methylated at its ω-carboxyl group by BioC. In
  the physiological pathway the committed step is the BioC-catalyzed SAM-dependent
  methylation of malonyl-CoA (or malonyl-ACP) . Malonyl-CoA methyl ester enters the
  fatty acid synthetic pathway as a dedicated biotin precursor and acts as primer
  (in place of the acetyl-CoA normally used in fatty acid synthesis) for the FabH
  catalyzed condensation reaction. The product of the proposed FabH reaction would
  be 3-ketoglutaryl-ACP methyl ester, a five-carbon dicarboxylate carrying the methyl
  ester moiety that allows the substrate to interact with the other fatty acid synthetic
  enzymes. 3-Ketoglutaryl-ACP methyl ester would be reduced by 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase
  (FabG) to 3-hydroxylglutaryl-ACP methyl ester which would be dehydrated by 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP
  dehydratase (FabZ) to the enoyl-ACP methyl ester species. The double bond would
  be reduced by enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) to give glutaryl-ACP methyl ester. The
  product of the first elongation cycle would then be elongated by a second decarboxylative
  Claisen condensation with malonyl-ACP (probably by FabB or FabF) to give 3-ketopimeloyl-ACP
  methyl ester which would be reduced and dehydrated as above to give pimeloyl-ACP
  methyl ester. BioH cleavage of the ester prevents further elongation and the resulting
  pimeloyl-ACP utilized by BioF to make KAPA which would begin synthesis of biotin.
