caption: Proposed underlying mechanism of the antineoplastic effects of BBR, which
  involves the reversal of the Warburg effect via downregulating the Akt/mTOR/GLUT1
  signaling pathway. Treatment with BBR downregulates the expression levels of p-Akt
  in cancer cells, which in turn downregulates the levels of its downstream signaling
  protein, p-mTOR. Subsequently, the binding between GIPC and GLUT1 is weakened, which
  results in the cytoplasmic retention of GLUT1. The weakened binding of GIPC with
  GLUT1 also strengthens the binding between Ubc9 and GLUT1, which leads to the post-translational
  degradation of GLUT1 and further diminishes the glucose transport function of GLUT1.
  Consequently, the glucose uptake capacity of cancer cells and ATP synthesis are
  decreased, therefore the Warburg effect of cancer cells is reversed, which contributes
  to the antineoplastic activity of BBR. BBR, berberine; Ubc9, ubiquitin conjugating
  enzyme E2 I; GIPC, Gα-interacting protein-interacting protein at the C-terminus;
  GLUT1, glucose transporter 1; p-, phosphorylated.
