caption: The biosynthetic pathways and genes in the terpenoid (A) and flavonoid (B)
  secondary metabolite pathways. The numbers shown in the boxes are the genes/genomes
  that are enriched in the KEGG pathway that regulate response. The red box indicates
  that the gene is upregulated, the green box indicates that the gene is downregulated,
  and the blue box indicates that the genome has up-regulated genes and downregulated
  genes. The solid line represents a single-step synthesis reaction and the dashed
  line represents a multi-step synthesis reaction.
