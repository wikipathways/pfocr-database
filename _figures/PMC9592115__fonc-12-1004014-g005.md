caption: Gene ontology network of MBTPS1 KO. Overlap between pathways that are significantly
  enriched in the DE gene set of MBTPS1 KO compared to original HT-29 cells. GO terms
  are represented as nodes. The size of the node indicates the percentage of genes
  in the pathway that are DE. The node color represents the z-score, which calculates
  the trend of DE genes toward increased (Up ) or decreased (Down ) expression.
