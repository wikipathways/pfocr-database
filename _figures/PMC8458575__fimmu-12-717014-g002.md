caption: The mTOR-centered Metabolic Regulatory Signaling Pathway. mTOR is a crucial
  eukaryotic cell regulator, which affects the expression of cytokines in cells, participates
  in immunosuppression, and regulates cell growth. mTOR contains two complexes. mTORC1
  promotes cell growth by promoting glucose metabolism. It can enhance the translation
  of the transcription factor HIF-1α, thereby promoting glucose metabolism. It can
  also activate the transcription factor SREBP to promote lipid synthesis and meet
  the formation of membranes during cell growth. mTORC1 also promotes the synthesis
  of nucleotides required for DNA replication and ribosome synthesis during cell growth
  and proliferation. mTORC1 promotes the expression of ATF4, further increases the
  expression of MTHFD2, and provides carbon units for purine synthesis. Phosphorylation
  of S6K1 can activate the CAD enzyme and promote pyrimidine synthesis. mTORC1 is
  mainly regulated by upstream AMPK. AMPKa is activated by phosphorylation by LKB1,
  TAK1, or CaMKKb kinase. LKB1 promotes the enhancement of AMPK phosphorylation under
  a high AMP/ATP ratio. Activated AMPK can cause AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of
  Ser 1387 of TSC2 and reduce mTORC1 activation. AMPK can also directly phosphorylate
  Raptor to reduce the activity of mTORC1. The TSC1–TSC2 complex also integrates the
  PI3K–Akt pathway, which regulates the activity of mTORC1 through the AKT-dependent
  phosphorylation of Thr1462. In addition, amino acids can activate mTORC1 through
  the RAG family of small GTPases. The most important role of mTORC2 may be the phosphorylation
  and activation of Akt. Akt is a key effector of insulin/PI3K signaling. Once activated,
  Akt promotes cell survival, proliferation and growth through phosphorylation and
  inhibition of several key substrates, including FoxO1/3a transcription factor and
  TSC2. Finally, mTORC2 also phosphorylates and activates SGK1 and PKC, and regulates
  ion transport and cell migration. PI3K can directly activate mTORC2 through phosphorylation.
