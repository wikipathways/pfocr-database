caption: 'A: Potential routes of PARP-1 stimulation of inflammatory gene expression.
  First, at the level of chromatin remodeling, the modification of histone H1 by PARP-1
  (1) relaxes the highly compacted chromatin fibers and facilitates transcription
  machinery access to the target genes (2). Second, at the level of transcription,
  activated PARP-1 either directly binds to the promoter region of target genes (3)
  or acts on transcription factors and regulates their transcriptional activity (4).
  Third, at the level of posttranscription, activated PARP-1 affects p38 (MAPK) and
  then regulates the posttranscriptional stability of mRNAs (5). B: Potential routes
  of nuclear-mitochondrial cross talk in PARP-1–dependent cell death pathways. 1:
  Extensive PARP-1 activation leads to depletion of NAD+ from the cytosol and accumulation
  of poly(ADP-ribose) in the nucleus. NAD+ depletion can block glycolysis and thereby
  block the delivery of glucose-derived substrates to the mitochondria. 2: Poly(ADP-ribose)
  formed in the nucleus might be transported out of the nucleus and act directly on
  mitochondrial membranes. 3: Pro-apoptosis protein Bcl-2–associated X protein (Bax)
  is activated and translocates to mitochondrial membranes. The actions of both poly(ADP-ribose)
  and Bax on mitochondrial membrane lead to cell death through a process involving
  mitochondrial depolarization (Δψm), MPT, and mitochondrial release of AIF and cytochrome
  c (Cyto c). 4: Blocking the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) 1–TNF receptor (TRAF)–associated
  factor 2–c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signal transduction pathway can also inhibit
  PARP-1–induced mitochondrial events and resultant cell death. It remains to be established
  whether these three pathways are interrelated or are independent of each other.
  5: The localization of PARP-1 and the formation of PARs in mitochondria (mt) as
  mechanisms for impaired membrane potential (Ψm), NAD+ content, cellular respiration,
  and cell death factors (ie, Cyto c and AIF) remain to be examined in future studies.'
