caption: Schematic of the pathological mechanism of AEA-TRPV1/CB1R-induced hyperexcitability
  in nociceptors post-SCI. Increased AEA content induces transformation from the RA
  to NA state and hyperexcitability in nociceptors via the AEA-TRPV1-Ca2+ pathway
  after SCI. The early increase in CB1R inhibits VGCCs to maintain [Ca2+]cyto at low
  levels, suggesting adaptive neuroprotection via the AEA-CB1R signaling pathway.
  However, increasing levels of AEA and TRPV1 post-SCI leads to nociceptor maladaptation,
  inducing an increase in [Ca2+]cyto and transforming the RA to NA state, which contributes
  to chronic neuropathic pain. VGCC, voltage-gated calcium channel; TRPV1, transient
  receptor potential vanilloid 1; AEA, anandamide; CB1R, cannabinoid type-1 receptor
