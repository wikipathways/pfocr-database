caption: 'Schematic illustration of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) integrating
  different metabolic intermediates fluxing to UDP-N-Acetlyglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc).
  Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase yielding glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6P) which
  can be converted to fructose-6-phosphate (Fruc-6P) by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
  (GPI). Both Glc-6P and Fruc-6P can be metabolized by glycolysis or the HBP. The
  rate-limiting enzyme of HBP: Glutamine-fructose 6-phosphate aminotransferase (GFPT1
  or GFAT) mediates the diverge to HBP, conversing Fruc-6P to glucosamine-6-phosphate
  (GlcN-6P) from glutamine, the amide donor. Additionally, GFAT mRNA and protein expression
  was upregulated by saturated fatty acids (palmitate and stearate), whereas inhibition
  occurs owing to feedback from its enzymatic product GlcN-6P. Next, acetyl-CoA (AcCoA)
  and GlcN-6P are converted by D-glucosamine-6-phosphate N-Acetyltransferase (GNA1)
  to CoA and N-Acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6P). After that, another enzyme,
  GlcNAc phosphomutase (PGM3), converts GlcNAc-6P to N-Acetyl-1-phosphate glucosamine
  (GlcNAc-1P), employing glucose-1,6-bisphosphate as a co-factor. The nucleoside (UTP)
  is then added to the sugar by UDP-N-Acetylhexosamine pyrophosphorylase (UAP1) yielding
  UDP-N-Acetlyglucosamine(UDP-GlcNAc). Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI); Glutamine-fructose
  6-phosphate aminotransferase (GFPT1 or GFAT); D-glucosamine-6-phosphate N-Acetyltransferase
  (GNA1); GlcNAc phosphomutase (PGM3); Nucleoside (UTP); UDP-N-Acetylhexosamine pyrophosphorylase
  (UAP1).'
