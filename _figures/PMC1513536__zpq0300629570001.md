caption: Specific (A) and general (B) responsive back up circuitries. (A) The Hxt1/Hxt2
  responsive backup circuit. Extracellular glucose concentration is sensed by two
  membrane receptors on the outer yeast membrane, Rgt2 and Snf3. These receptors,
  once activated by glucose, initiate a signal cascade that induces the transcription
  of the Hxt gene family of hexose transporters encoding membrane channels for glucose
  intake. The flux of incoming glucose generates an increase in intracellular glucose
  concentration, that, in turn, represses the transcription of Hxt2. (B) Three possibilities
  for feedback in RBCs. For one duplicate gene to sense and respond to its partners’
  intactness, feedback mechanisms must be at play. In this diagram, duplicates are
  represented as ovals that lie embedded within a reaction pathway illustrated by
  the consecutive arrows. Lines A, B and C represent the three feedback possibilities,
  namely, simple negative regulation (A), substrate induction (B), and end-product
  regulation (C).
