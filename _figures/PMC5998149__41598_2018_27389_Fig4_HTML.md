caption: Pathway analysis of glycolysis and TCA cycle. Analysis of energy metabolites
  revealed no global alterations upon Anks3 protein depletion. However, within the
  energy metabolism fructose as well as pyruvic acid levels were found to be reduced.
  Amino acids were detected to be strikingly upregulated upon protein depletion. Especially,
  phenylalanine and tyrosine, but also cysteine and glycine were detected to be upregulated.
  mIMCD3 krab shANKS3 cells were represented in red. Luci-i controls were depicted
  in green. Shaded areas indicate the standard deviation at each time point.
