caption: 'A proposed metabolic model involving glutamine, proline and collagen. The
  depicted tumor cell is also applicable to nonmalignant proliferating cells. The
  sources for glutamine are shown on the upper left and the source for proline is
  shown in the upper right. These are not necessarily specific for cellular or other
  anatomic sites. GSA and P5C are tautomers. Their interconversions are spontaneous.
  Overall, the proposed pathway is that glutamine synthesized from adequate protein
  intake is used for energy and de-novo synthesis of purines and pyrimidines. Proline
  is an important amino acid product that is used for signaling as well as an alternate
  source of ATP. During nutritional plenty, proline is stored in collagen, the main
  component of ECM. This reservoir of proline can be mobilized during conditions of
  nutritional stress. ECM, extracellular matrix; GSA, glutamic-γ- semialdehyde; P5C,
  pyrroline-5-carboxylate; ORN, ornithine; PA, polyamines; PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway. The black circles designate specific enzymes numbered as follows: 1, proline
  dehydrogenase a.k.a. proline oxidise; 2, P5C synthase; 3, P5C reductase 1 and 2;
  4, P5C reductase L; 5, glutaminase.'
