caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for compounds 1–8. All faded structures (a–h)
  are hypothetical intermediates which were not observed in this study. Red brackets
  indicate unstable intermediates or equilibria between compounds existing simultaneously.
  Equilibrium and reaction arrows are connected to the curved arrows of the respective
  color.
