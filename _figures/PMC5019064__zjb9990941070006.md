caption: Model depicting potential mechanisms leading to repression of type 1 pili
  in the wild-type parent and the ubiI mutant under aerobic and anoxic conditions.
  (Left) When oxygen is present, aerobic ubiquinone synthesis requires the UbiI enzyme
  for the optimal synthesis of ubiquinones and the generation of appropriate PMF to
  sustain transport across the inner membrane. Deletion of ubiI lowers the PMF and
  compromises ATP-dependent transport. This leads to reduced translocation of Fim
  components and negative feedback that turns the fimS promoter to the fim OFF orientation
  by the action of the dedicated Fim recombinases that results in lack of fim operon
  transcription. This mechanism would also explain the reduction in pilus expression
  in previously published TCA cycle mutants. The mechanism by which the reduction
  in PMF is transduced to the Fim recombinase machinery or genes is still unknown.
  (Right) Under anoxic conditions, aerobic ubiquinone synthesis by UbiI is dispensable,
  due to the use of menaquinones for anaerobic respiration or use of the fermentation
  pathway. Under these conditions, the PMF across the inner membrane is restored,
  restoring ATP-dependent transport and the elaboration of macromolecular structures
  on the bacterial surface. However, a yet unidentified mechanism senses the lack
  of oxygen (or the presence of a fermentation by-product?) and somehow transduces
  this information to the regulatory network that controls expression of type 1 pili.
  The result is decreased fim expression and thereby pili on the surface of the bacteria,
  independent of an adequate energy supply typically required for their assembly.
  Whether this occurs differently in the ubiI mutant remains unknown.
