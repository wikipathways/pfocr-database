caption: Failure of endogenous regulation of wound-healing in idiopathic pulmonary
  fibrosis (IPF). Injuries to alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) result in upregulation
  of growth factor production, including tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Binding
  of TNF-α to TNF-α receptor (TNF-αR) activates the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway
  and induces synthesis of prostaglandins including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 6-keto-prostaglandin
  F1α (PGF1α). Prostaglandins exert negative feedback control of AEC TNF-α expression
  and autocrine inhibition, through raised intracellular cAMP levels, of the connective
  tissue growth factor (CTGF) response to transforming growth factor-β. This results
  in limited and healthy wound healing, and prevents further progression to fibrosis.
  In IPF, however, myofibroblasts exhibit marked deficiencies in TNF-α receptor expression
  and COX-2 induction that result in reduced synthesis of prostaglandins, and a failure
  in the normal self-limiting wound-healing response (broken arrows), ultimately leading
  to fibrosis. PRs, prostaglandin receptors.
