caption: Yin-Yang model of hair follicle regeneration tuned by Wnt/BMP signaling.
  The balance of BMP6 and Wnt10b regulates the telogen-anagen transition of hair follicles.
  a When Wnt10b is in the dominant role, it activates the Wnt signaling pathway and
  inhibits BMP signaling pathway, thus activates the HFSCs. Along with the proliferation
  of HFSCs, hair follicles enter anagen. b When BMP6 is in the dominant role, it activates
  the BMP signaling pathway and inhibits Wnt signaling pathway, thus inhibits the
  activation of HFSCs. HFSCs keep quiescent and hair follicles stay in telogen. Epi,
  epithelia. SG, sebaceous gland. Bu, bulge. HG, hair germ. DP, dermal papilla. ORS,
  outer root sheath. The red dots indicate HFSCs express Krt15
