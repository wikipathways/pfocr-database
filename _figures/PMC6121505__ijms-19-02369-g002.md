caption: Inhibition of apoptosis mediated by mFas and TRAIL. The pathway for the induction
  of mFas-mediated apoptosis consists of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation
  followed by the assembly of Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), and
  the cleavage of caspases 8 and 3. One of the inhibitory mechanisms of Fas-mediated
  apoptosis is mediated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and a downstream PI3K/Akt
  and NF-κB pathway including the expression of X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
  (XIAP). Another candidate is sFasL, which is shown to inhibit mFas-mediated apoptosis
  by combining with mFas. Although pro-apoptotic pathway in SS is similar to general
  apoptotic pathway, EGF-mediated inhibition of apoptosis might be specific in SS.
  TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) rapidly induces the apoptosis of cultured
  salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs), in which a mitochondrial pathway that includes
  a release of cytochrome C, the cleavage of caspase 9, and the activation of Apaf-1
  after the truncation of Bid is also involved. Bcl-2 family molecules such as Bcl-2
  and Bcl-xL are considered to inhibit this mitochondrial pathway by inhibiting cytochrome
  C release.
