caption: Pathways of hepatic energy metabolism reconstructed in the present study.
  The numbers in boxes represent the EC numbers of the pathway enzymes. The box in
  red refers to the enzymes whose expression was significantly upregulated in the
  MNFC group compared with the LNFC group. The box in blue refers to the enzymes whose
  expression was significantly downregulated in the MNFC group compared with the LNFC
  group. 1 refers to the pathway of glycerol synthesis; 2 refers to fatty acid metabolism;
  3 refers to ketone body metabolism; 4 refers to propanoate metabolism; 5 refers
  to acetate metabolism; and 6 refers to butanoate metabolism. The shared substrates
  of ureagenesis and energy metabolism are marked in red. This figure was modified
  from the KEGG pathway maps chx00010, chx00020, chx00030, chx00061, chx00071, chx00072,
  chx00561, chx00620 and chx00640. The written permission was obtained from the Kanehisa
