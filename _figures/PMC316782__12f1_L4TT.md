caption: '(A) Genetic pathways of sex determination in D. melanogaster (a) and C.
  elegans (b) are initiated by X:autosome (A) ratio but otherwise different (). (A,a)
  In the fly a high X:A ratio (2:2) activates sxl, which encodes a splicing factor.
  In turn, Sxl allows female-specific expression of the splicing factor tra, which
  together with tra-2, permits expression of female isoform DSXF. The pathway then
  ramifies. Intersex (ix), hermaphrodite (her), and fruitless (not shown) are other
  downstream elements. When the X:A ratio is low, male-specific isoform DSXM occurs
  by default; isoforms differ in carboxy-terminal domain (see Fig. A). (A,b) In nematode
  a high X:A ratio (2:2) is associated with absent her-1 expression, in turn enabling
  unrepressed expression of tra-2 and tra-3 (unrelated to Drosophila genes of similar
  nomenclature). Hermaphrodite-specific expression of tra-2 and tra-3 represses fem-1,
  fem-2, and fem-3. In their absence, tra-1 is expressed in hermaphrodite and turns
  off male-determinant mab-3 (encoding a DM transcription factor). TRA-1 has MAB-3
  independent targets as pathway ramifies. When the X:A ratio is low (1:2), HER-1
  (involved in cell–cell signaling) represses tra-2 and tra-3. Unrepressed expression
  of female genes represses tra-1 and therefore default expression of mab-3 directs
  male development and turns off hermaphroditic program. Nematode genes (b) that enumerate
  X:A ratio and control X dosage compensation (including xol-1 and sdc-2; ) are omitted
  for clarity. (B) Alignment of metazoan DM sequence motifs. Cysteines and histidines
  that coordinate Zn2+ are aligned as two intertwined binding sites (boxes): site
  I (red) and site II (green). Conserved residues in zinc module are otherwise shown
  in blue; conserved residues in tail are color coded (R, red; Q, green; A, magenta;
  D/E, violet; L/V/T/M, blue). Stable α-helical elements are highlighted by magenta
  ribbons above DSX sequence. Nascent carboxy-terminal α-helix is indicated by gray
  extension; it is not meant to convey a continuous α-helix (see text). (DSX) DM domain
