caption: '(A) Genetic pathways of sex determination in D. melanogaster (a) and C.
  elegans (b) are initiated by X:autosome (A) ratio but otherwise different (). (A,a)
  In the fly a high X:A ratio (2:2) activates sxl, which encodes a splicing factor.
  In turn, Sxl allows female-specific expression of the splicing factor tra, which
  together with tra-2, permits expression of female isoform DSXF. The pathway then
  ramifies. Intersex (ix), hermaphrodite (her), and fruitless (not shown) are other
  downstream elements. When the X:A ratio is low, male-specific isoform DSXM occurs
  by default; isoforms differ in carboxy-terminal domain (see Fig. A). (A,b) In nematode
  a high X:A ratio (2:2) is associated with absent her-1 expression, in turn enabling
  unrepressed expression of tra-2 and tra-3 (unrelated to Drosophila genes of similar
  nomenclature). Hermaphrodite-specific expression of tra-2 and tra-3 represses fem-1,
  fem-2, and fem-3. In their absence, tra-1 is expressed in hermaphrodite and turns
  off male-determinant mab-3 (encoding a DM transcription factor). TRA-1 has MAB-3
  independent targets as pathway ramifies. When the X:A ratio is low (1:2), HER-1
  (involved in cell–cell signaling) represses tra-2 and tra-3. Unrepressed expression
  of female genes represses tra-1 and therefore default expression of mab-3 directs
  male development and turns off hermaphroditic program. Nematode genes (b) that enumerate
  X:A ratio and control X dosage compensation (including xol-1 and sdc-2; ) are omitted
  for clarity. (B) Alignment of metazoan DM sequence motifs. Cysteines and histidines
  that coordinate Zn2+ are aligned as two intertwined binding sites (boxes): site
  I (red) and site II (green). Conserved residues in zinc module are otherwise shown
  in blue; conserved residues in tail are color coded (R, red; Q, green; A, magenta;
  D/E, violet; L/V/T/M, blue). Stable α-helical elements are highlighted by magenta
  ribbons above DSX sequence. Nascent carboxy-terminal α-helix is indicated by gray
  extension; it is not meant to convey a continuous α-helix (see text). (DSX) DM domain
  in D. melanogaster (accession no. M25292). (MAB-3a and MAB-3b) The first and the
  second DM domains in C. elegans protein (accession no. Z99278). Other C. elegans
  DM sequences: F10C1.5, cosmid F10C1 (accession no. U49831); C34D1.1, cosmid C34D1
  (accession no. Z78060); K08B12, cosmid K08B12 (accession no. U97001); F13G11, cosmid

  (accession no. Z69883); and Y43F8C (accession no. AL032637.1). Vertebrate DM sequences:
  DMRT1 and DMRT2, human homologs on the short arm of chromosome 9 (DMRT1: accession
  no. AF130728 and DMRT2: accession no. AF130729). Other homologs: mDmrt1 (murine,
  accession no. AF202778), pDmrt1 (porcine, accession no. AF216651), and cDmrt1 (chicken,
  accession no. AF123456). TERRA: DM domain of zebrafish terra (accession no. AF080622).
  Sequences shown include genes (such as TERRA; ) not known to be involved in sex
  determination. Arrows without parentheses indicate sites of point mutations in dsx
  or mab-3 associated with intersex development; substitutions in parenthesis indicate
  variants characterized only by biochemical assays (). Three additional putative
  DM genes of unknown function have recently been found in the genome of D. melanogaster
  (accession nos. AAF56919, AAF55843, and AAF48261; sequences not shown).'
