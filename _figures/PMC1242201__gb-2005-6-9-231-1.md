caption: Key components of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Complexes
  formed by a Wnt ligand, Frizzled receptor protein and LRP5 or LRP6 initiate signaling
  within the cytoplasm. The signal acts via Dishevelled (Dvl) and Axin to inhibit
  the β-catenin destruction complex and thus increase the stabilization of β-catenin
  (β-cat), which then accumulates in the cytosol and nucleus. In the nucleus, β-catenin
  forms a complex with TCF proteins that activates the transcription of specific target
  genes. For simplicity, Dvl and Axin are shown as part of the β-catenin destruction
  complex, but each protein can also be found associated with the receptor complex.
  Components shown shaded in gray have an inhibitory effect on downstream signaling
  in the nucleus. The nomenclature used is as for mammalian cells (see Table 1 for
  the nomenclature of equivalent components in Drosophila). APC, the adenomatous polyposis
  coli protein; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3.
