caption: 'Overview of the main metabolic pathways: Glucose enters the cell via glucose
  transporters and enters the glycolytic pathway. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) converts glucose
  into Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Glycolysis generates pyruvate from
  glucose with the help of Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2). This process generates energy
  in the form of adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP). Pyruvate is then either converted
  to lactate and secreted out of the cell or decarboxylated by pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH) and converted to Acetyl CoA which enters the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle.
  The TCA cycle generates NADH, FADH2 to feed into the Electron Transport Chain (ETC),
  which produces 36 molecules of ATP. Glycolysis also feeds into the Pentose Phosphate
  Pathway (PPP) at the level of G6PD to produce ribose, NADPH, and amino acids. Amino
  acid metabolism can also feed into the TCA cycle to drive ATP production by the
  ETC, amino acids such as Glutamine can have further downstream effects. TCA intermediate
  citrate drives fatty acid synthesis while fatty acid oxidation drives TCA cycle
  further by generating Acetyl CoA. Citrate and Succinate can act as ‘immunometabolites’.
  Citrate can also be converted to Itaconate via the enzymatic activity of IRG1 (ACOD1).
