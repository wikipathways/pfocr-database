caption: Proposed pathogenic mechanisms in TDP-43-mediated neurodegneration converge
  onto disruption of protein and RNA homeostasis. Proteins involved in protein and
  RNA homeostasis are labeled as grey and green, respectively. (Upper panel) Normal
  functions of ALS/FTD-linked proteins. 1) Three ALS-linked genes (VCP, p62 and CHMP2B)
  are required for proper turnover of TDP-43, which is degraded both by the proteasome
  and by autophagy. 2) TDP-43 regulates the expression of the same ALS-linked genes
  that are required for its own degradation as well as 3) a key autophagy induction
  protein, ATG7. TDP-43 also regulates two other RNA-binding proteins linked to ALS
  (FUS/TLS and Ataxin-2). TDP-43, FUS/TLS and Ataxin-2 form RNA-protein granules that
  are degraded through 4) autophagy/granulophagy. Thus, TDP-43 governs both protein
  and RNA homeostasis and 5) its own level is tightly maintained. (Lower panel) Disrupted
  protein and RNA homeostasis that fuels a feed-forward loop driving disease progression.
  An initiating event that triggers disease initiation can occur at multiple points
  in either protein or RNA homeostasis pathways, including genetic mutations that
  predispose one pathway to be more error-prone or other non-genetic factors, such
  as aging. The well-documented 1) decline in proteostasis during aging may lead to
  elevated accumulation of TDP-43. Subsequently, 2) the genes that are controlled
  by TDP-43 become de-regulated, including 3) loss of expression of ATG7, which in
  turn reduces 4) autophagy (and granulophagy). The net result of this produces 5)
  disrupted autoregulation of TDP-43 with an increased cytoplasmic concentration of
  TDP-43, which provokes 6) prion-like templating of it followed by propagation and
  spread. These gain-of-toxic properties induce over-production of “nonfunctional
  prion-like” TDP-43 that leads to further loss of TDP-43 function. Similar scenarios
  could operate for prion-like domain-containing RNA binding proteins, such as FUS/TLS
  and hnRNP A2/B1.
