caption: In cirrhosis, persistent PRR activation leads to upregulation and downstream
  signaling of various cytokine pathways, such as the interferon pathway, proinflammatory
  interleukins, growth factor-mediated signaling, NF-kB and JNK pathway as TNF-a signaling,
  which are also common to inflammatory downstream activation associated with COVID-19.
  The innate and adaptive cellular responses leading to immune exhaustion is also
  common to both cirrhosis and COVID-19 which worsens organ damage. AT, angiotensin;
  JNK, Janus-kinase pathway.
