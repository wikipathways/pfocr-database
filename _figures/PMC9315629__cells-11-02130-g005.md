caption: 'CircRNAs that downregulate glioblastoma growth: A schematic representation
  of the circRNAs involved in the regulation of glioma cell proliferation, migration,
  and invasion, among other functions. Numerous discovered circRNAs operate as miRNA
  sponges, therefore downregulating the amount of expression of the relevant target
  gene. These target genes or proteins further influence downstream factors involved
  in cancer signaling pathways by functioning as transcription factors, regulatory
  proteins. CircRNAs such as circ-CDC45, circ- 0029426, circ-ENTPD7, circ-FLNA, hsa-circ-
  0076248, circ-0006168, circ-ABCC3, circ-LGMN, Circ-FOXO3, Hsa-circ- 0005114, Circ-
  0074027, Circ-SKA3, Circ-0001801, Circ-FOXM1, Circ-NF1, Circ-MELK, Circ-NUP98, circ-ATXN1,
  circ-ARF1, circ-RFX3, and circ-PIK3C2A are responsible for the down-regulation of
  glioblastoma growth through different pathways including those of the VEGFA, Wnt/β-catenin,
  CDR1, PI3K/AKT, WWOX, and SMAD6 pathways. For example, cir-ITCH promotes the Wnt/-catenin
  signaling pathway via miR-214.'
