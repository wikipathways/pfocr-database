caption: Regulation of H2S production by 3MST. Disulfides, such as thioredoxin (TRX)
  and dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), are endogenous reducing substances, which can release
  H2S from 3MST. The activity of CAT is regulated by Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+,
  the production of H2S by 3MST/CAT pathway from cysteine and α–ketoglutarate is the
  maximum but is suppressed by Ca2+ in a concentration-dependent manner.
