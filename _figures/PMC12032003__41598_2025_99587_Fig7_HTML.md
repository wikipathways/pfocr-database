caption: Working model of G-Rg1’s functions in protecting the synaptic plasticity
  and mitigating neuroapoptosis via the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway in the stress
  model. Hippo-YAP signaling pathway is activated in nerve cells of stressed mice.
  By inhibiting the activation of the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, G-Rg1 facilitates
  the translocation of the YAP protein into the nucleus, thereby enhancing synaptic
  plasticity, reducing cellular apoptosis, and consequently alleviating the stress
  condition. Created in BioRender.com. https://app.biorender.com/illustrations/65794f3eb2971e95378d3ae4
