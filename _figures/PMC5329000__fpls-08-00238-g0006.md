caption: 'A proposed model of AR156-mediated ISR against biotrophic and necrotrophic
  pathogens. When plants are pretreated with AR156, an ISR omnipotent to pathogens
  with both biotrophic and necrotrophic life styles is induced. When plants in a potentiated
  immune status is infected by a biotrophic pathogen, such as Pst DC3000, both SA
  and JA/ET signaling pathways are activated. Through a mechanism dependent on NPR1,
  downstream defense-related genes, such as PR1, PR2, PR5, and PDF1.2 are expressed,
  and cellular defense responses, such as H2O2 accumulation, callose deposition are
  activated; when plants are challenged with necrotrophic pathogens, such as B. cinerea,
  only the JA/ET signaling pathways is activated. The necrotrophic-effective ISR is
  also dependent on NPR1. Dashed lings: protective function to other unidentified
  elicitors.'
