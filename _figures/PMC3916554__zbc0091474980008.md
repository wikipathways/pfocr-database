caption: Effect of different doses of EFV on the cerebral sterol profile in mice (n
  = 3 per dose and time point) when the drug is delivered by gavage. Thin gray lines
  correspond to the 2-week treatment (2-wk Tx), whereas thick black lines reflect
  the 4-week treatment (4-wk Tx). The percentages of the sterol change relative to
  the untreated control are also shown, as is a scheme of the cholesterol biosynthesis
  pathway. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.
