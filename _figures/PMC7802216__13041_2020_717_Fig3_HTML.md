caption: PSD-95 protein interactions are interrupted by Ca2+ influx which affects
  also PSD-95 relation with actin networks. A. PSD-95 is anchored on the postsynaptic
  membrane via palmitoylation at Cys3 and Cys5 and α-actinin anchoring. Through binding
  the N-terminus of palmitoylated PSD-95, CDKL5 is targeted to postsynaptic sites
  where it forms a complex with Rac1 to regulate the actin cytoskeleton via the Rac1
  signaling pathway. B. Upon activity-induced Ca2+ influx through NMDAR, activated
  calmodulin (CaM), due to Ca2+ binding, caps the N-terminal of PSD-95, leading to
  blocked accessibility of palmitoylation sites and binding sites for CDKL5 and α-actinin.
  This process results in downregulation of PSD-95 palmitoylation and release of PSD-95
  from the postsynaptic membrane. As a result, CDKL5 will also be released from the
  synapses and fail to form complexes with Rac1. Illustration based on [, –]. One
  squiggle denotes one palmitoyl chain attached to PSD-95
