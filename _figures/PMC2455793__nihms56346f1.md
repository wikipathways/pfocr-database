caption: Potential interaction between two known Egr1 target genes, PTEN and fibronectin
  achieves a delicate balance between attachment and apoptosis of detached cells (anoikis).
  It is known that Egr1 directly stimulates the expression and secretion of functional
  fibronectin leading to RGD-dependent attachment and FAK activation. This pathway
  activates Akt in other systems thereby inhibiting apoptosis and promoting survival.
  Cells with decreased attachment properties – a manifestation of transformation -
  experience relatively increased PTEN-mediated inhibition of Akt and increased apoptosis
  (anoikis). Thus Egr1 favors attachment and survival of normal cells but apoptosis
  of abnormal forms with deficient attachment properties.
papertitle: The transcription factor Egr1 is a direct regulator of multiple tumor
  suppressors including TGFβ1, PTEN, p53 and fibronectin.
