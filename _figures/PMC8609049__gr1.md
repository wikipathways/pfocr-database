caption: Schematic overview of metabolic pathway in IDH wild-type and mutant gliomas.
  Similar to other malignant tumors, IDH wild-type glioma is characterized by a high
  level of aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). Hypoxia induces upregulation of HIF1α,
  leading to overexpression of glycolysis-related proteins/enzymes, namely, GLUT,
  HK2, MCT, and LDHA, thereby accelerating glycolysis. On the other hand, HIF1α response
  to hypoxia is blunted in IDH mutant glioma, shifting the metabolism to oxidative
  phosphorylation. In this study, the extent of aerobic glycolysis was estimated by
  pH- and oxygen-sensitive imaging combined with perfusion imaging. The proteins/enzymes
  investigated in our study are labeled in black. Notably, MTRasym at 3.0 ppm increases
  not only in accordance with decrease in pH but also with increase in glutamine related
  to tumor activity. 2HG = 2-hydroxyglutarate, aKG = alpha-ketoglutarate, acetyl-CoA = acetyl
  coenzyme A, G6P = glucose-6-phosphate, GDH = glutamate dehydrogenase, GLS = glutaminase,
  GLUT = glucose transporter, HK2 = hexokinase 2, LAT = L-amino acid transporter,
  LDHA = lactic dehydrogenase A, MCT = monocarboxylate transporter, mTOR = mammalian
  target of rapamycin, PDH = pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDK1 = pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase 1, ROS = reactive oxygen species, TA = transaminase, TCA cycle = tricarboxylic
  acid cycle.
