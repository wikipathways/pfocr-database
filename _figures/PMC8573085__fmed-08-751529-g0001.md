caption: Lipid metabolism in renal tubules and the regulation mechanism in diabetes
  mellitus. Tubules mainly utilize the metabolism of FAs as an energy source, and
  the metabolism of FAs includes catabolism and anabolism. FAs entering the renal
  tubules mainly come from the blood circulation. Initially, FAs are esterified in
  the form of VLDL and CM-TAG; then, esterified FAs are catabolized by LPL to release
  FAs. Extracellular FAs enter the cell by autonomous diffusion or transporters as
  CD36 and FABP. FAs into the cell are activated by ACS to fatty acyl-CoA, and then
  part of fatty acyl-CoA enters the mitochondria via CPT-1 and CPT-2 for catabolism
  to produce acetyl-CoA, which enters TCA to produce ATP required by the kidney; and
  excess fatty acyl-CoA enters the anabolic pathway to generate TAG. In addition,
  the product of FAO acetyl-CoA can also be transported out of mitochondria by CACT
  and converted to malonyl-CoA by ACC, and malonyl-CoA resynthesizes new FAs by FAS.
  In diabetes and high glucose conditions, the proteins are high- or down regulated
  in the uptake, metabolism and synthesis of FAs, which are marked in red color.
