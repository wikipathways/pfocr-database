caption: NO/sGC/cGMP/PKG pathways in platelets. (Part in red). Activation of sGC by
  endogenous NO increases cGMP synthesis. cGMP is involved in regulation of cAMP concentration
  by PDE2 and PDE3 activation. PDE5 is the main PDE responsible for cGMP degradation.
  Activated PKG leads to changes in phosphorylation status of numerous proteins and
  some of them (VASP, IRAG, Rap1B, Rap1Gap2, GRP2, IP3 receptor and others, for details
  see ) are involved in platelet inhibitory pathways. An alternative hypothesis is
  presented in blue. However, the expression of any NOS isoform and whether platelets
  themselves could produce biologically active NO are still under question. In addition,
  until now, possible involvement of any PKG substrate in platelet stimulatory pathways
  was not shown (see ).
