caption: '(a) Metabolic pathway for sucrose synthesis from fructose in early plant
  development. Molecules that are supposed to be abundant in the cytoplasm, such as
  phosphate groups, are not described. The change in the concentration of each metabolite
  when the PPi-degrading enzyme was knocked down was determined by structural sensitivity
  analysis and shown by the color of each molecule []. Red: increase, blue: decrease,
  gray: no change. The dotted arrow indicates an example of modification of the newly
  added reaction. Adding this reaction does not change the qualitative response to
  PPi-degrading enzyme perturbations. (b) The effect on the sucrose response when
  various reactions are added to the plant metabolic pathway given in . Green: The
  addition of these reactions does not alter the sucrose concentration response to
  the disruption of PPi-degrading enzyme. An arrow with arrowheads at both ends means
  that the result does not depend on the reaction direction or whether it is reversible
  reaction or not. Blue: When any of these four reactions is added, the sucrose concentration
  decreases by the destruction of PPi-degrading enzyme. Red: When this reaction is
  added, the sucrose concentration rather increases with the destruction of PPi degrading
  enzyme.'
