caption: 'T cell activation: for full activation, T cells require interaction between
  the antigen‐specific T cell receptor and the antigenic peptide presented in the
  context of self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) by the antigen‐presenting
  cell. A “costimulatory” second signal is then required, delivered by the interaction
  between cluster of differentiation (CD)28 on the T cell with CD80/86 on the antigen‐presenting
  cell. Later, the T cell expresses CTLA4, which has higher affinity for CD80/86,
  and delivers a down‐regulatory signal, thereby “switching off” the immune response
  when the pathogen is cleared. Fusion proteins based on the CTLA4 structure have
  been developed to block the costimulatory pathway, for use in autoimmunity and transplant
  rejection (fig 4).'
