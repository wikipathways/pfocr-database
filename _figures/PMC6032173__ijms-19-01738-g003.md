caption: 'Regulatory mechanisms of selected modifications in PPARγ. (A) Activation
  of the MAPK pathway leads to the phosphorylation of serine 112 by p38/JNK or ERK1/2.
  S112ph decreases PPARγ activity, either through reducing its ligand binding affinity
  and co-activator binding, or by increasing Period circadian regulator 2 (PER2) binding,
  which leads to decreased recruitment to target genes. The adapter molecule Docking
  protein 1 (DOK1) modulates S112ph levels in response to nutritional inputs. S112ph
  is also targeted by CDK7 and CDK9. Phosphatases removing S112 phosphorylation from
  PPARγ are: Protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), Protein phosphatase Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent
  1B (PPM1B), and Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1). (B) Obesity-induced
  MAPK signaling leads to serine 273 phosphorylation, which enhances binding of the
  Thyroid hormone receptor associated protein 3 (THRAP3), and repression of certain
  PPARγ target genes. Phosphorylation levels are modulated by CDK5, either directly
  by CDK5-medatied S273 phosphorylation, or indirectly via phosphorylation of Dual
  specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 2 (MEK2) and suppression of
  MAPK signaling. Compounds with or without PPAR agonist activity can be used to block
  S273ph. (C) Acetylation of lysines 268 and 293 has been shown to increase NCoR co-repressor
  binding, whereas NAD (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1
  (SIRT1)-mediated deacetylation of K293 favours PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16)
  binding and expression of thermogenic genes. Ligand binding enhances SIRT1-PPARγ
  interaction and K268/K293 deacetylation. AF1: activation function 1 domain; DBD:
