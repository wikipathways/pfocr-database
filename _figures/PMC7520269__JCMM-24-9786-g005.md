caption: Path‐net analysis. The interaction network for all significantly enriched
  pathways was done as a Path‐net. Nodes represent different pathways and the size
  of each circle is determined by the number of other genes that interact with this
  gene. Mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway plays a central
  role with the highest number of interactions with other pathways
