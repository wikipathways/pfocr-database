caption: TH/TR axis may be involved in hepatitis of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis
  C virus infection and accelerates alcoholic liver disease. USP18 regulates the signaling
  of antivirus by the thyroid hormone signaling pathway. TRUP gene and thyroid hormone
  receptor associated protein 150 alpha gene are associated to the integration of
  HBV DNA into the liver cell DNA, which are key regulators of cell proliferation
  and viability. TH has been proven to increase the level of Dio2, thereby elevating
  susceptibility to hepatic steatosis in a model of alcoholism. The mRNA level of
  TRIP12 is significantly different in alcohol liver disease.
