caption: Schematic diagram of HSV-2 ICP22 inhibiting the host type I IFN pathway.
  (A) The mechanism by which HSV-2 blocks the IRF-3 signal transduction pathway. HSV-2
  infection yields a number of byproducts, such as dsRNA, which can be recognized
  by RIG-I and activate the RIG-I/Mda-5 pathway, thereby promoting IFN-β transcription.
  Under HSV-2 infection conditions, ICP22 interacts with the DNA binding domain of
  IRF-3, resulting in the suppression of IRF-3 association with the IFN-β promoter.
  Ultimately, the production of IFN-β is suppressed by HSV-2, contributing to viral
  immune evasion(94). (B) The mechanism by which HSV-2 ICP22 blocks the IFN-β-mediated
  signaling pathway. Type I IFNs are usually expressed at low levels and can be induced
  by viral infection. After IFN-1 binds to receptors on the cell surface, Jak1 and
  Tyk2 are activated, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. Phosphorylated
  STATs dimerize and associate with IRF9 to form ISGF3. ISGF3 translocates to the
  nucleus and binds to ISRE to activate the transcription of ISG so that the cell
  is in an antiviral state. After HSV-2 infection, ICP22 induces ubiquitination and
  degradation of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9, thereby blocking ISGF3 nuclear translocation.
  Finally, the production of ISG is inhibited by HSV-2, which promotes the immune
  escape of HSV-2(100). VZV IE63 interferes with type I IFN-mediated activation of
  JAK-STAT signaling by degrading IRF9, thereby inhibiting the expression of interferon-stimulated
  genes.
