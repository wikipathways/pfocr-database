caption: 'Atherosclerosis and autophagy. 7-KC can increase Nox4-mediated H2O2 formation,
  which triggers autophagy through the inhibition of Atg4B activity. ApoL6 induces
  degradation of BECN1/Atg6. ApoL6 causes p62 accumulation reciprocal to BECN1 degradation.
  TRPV1 activation significantly increases cytosolic Ca2β levels. AMPK is phosphorylated
  and activated by upstream kinases: the tumor suppressor LKB1 and Ca2β. AMPK, which
  is a positive regulator of autophagy with three layers of regulation, suppresses
  mTOR activity through phosphorylation of TSC2 and regulatory-associated protein
  of mTOR; phosphorylation of ULK1 (S555); and promotion of VPS34 kinase activity
  through phosphorylation of BECN1. Activated VPS34 increases PI3P production. MTOR
  negatively regulates autophagy through direct phosphorylation of ULK1 (S757) to
  inactivate ULK1 activity. ULK1 directly phosphorylates BECN1 and enhances VPS34
  kinase activity to promote autophagy. mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of ULK1 (S757)
  also prevents ULK1 interaction with AMPK and thus suppresses the AMPK-induced phosphorylation
  of ULK1 (S555) to activate ULK1 and autophagy. AMPK regulates autophagy of the ULK1
  complex, the most upstream component of the core autophagy machinery that is composed
  of ULK1, Atg13, FIP200, and Atg101. Moreover, AMPK also regulates the function of
  the BECN1 complex by directly phosphorylating VPS34 and BECN1, which is essential
  for autophagosome formation by providing PI3P. RsV increases cAMP levels possibly
  through activation of ADCY or inhibition of PDE activity, thereby activating the
  cAMP signaling pathway via PKA and increasing AMPK and SIRT1 activity to ultimately
  induce autophagy. The activation of JNK may play an important role in autophagic
  induction by DHEA by phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and dissociation of BECN1 from the
  Bcl-2/BECN1 complex. ox-LDL blocks autophagic flux resulting in the aggregation
  of p62/SQSTM1. Then, p62/SQSTM1 regulates gene expression of MMP-9 via NF-κB-dependent
  signaling. Moreover, the corresponding downstream effectors of mTOR, S6K1, and 4E-BP1
  were also upregulated in ox-LDL-treated macrophages. Telmisartan was found to partially
  activate PPARc and the induction of autophagy via the PPARc-AMPK-mTOR pathway. Apelin-13
