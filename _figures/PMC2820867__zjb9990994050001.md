caption: 'Bacterial methionine and cysteine interconversion pathways. The activated
  methyl cycle (AMC) regenerates the active methyl donor, SAM, from the toxic methyl
  transferase product, SAH. SAH is metabolized in one of two ways. Many bacteria,
  including H. pylori, generate homocysteine from SAH in a two-step manner: a nucleosidase,
  Pfs, converts SAH to SRH, and then LuxS converts this to homocysteine and DPD. The
  alternative route produces homocysteine directly from SAH in a one-step reaction
  requiring SAH hydrolase (, ). Many bacteria synthesize cysteine through the sulfate
  assimilatory cysteine biosynthetic pathway, which uses inorganic sulfur as a substrate
  (pathway bounded by a dashed triangle). Enzymes with previously described homologues
  in H. pylori are shown in red. Enzymes that do not have homologues in H. pylori
  are shown in black. The reactions of the transsulfuration and reverse transsulfuration
  pathways, which are a major focus of this paper, are shown in green and blue, respectively.
  We show in this paper that CysKHp is the candidate cystathionine β-synthase and
  MetBHp the candidate cystathionine γ-lyase in the reverse transsulfuration pathway.
  We suggest that these genes be renamed mccA (methionine-to-cysteine-conversion gene
  A) and mccB, respectively. CBL, cystathionine β-lyase; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase;
  CGL, cystathionine γ-lyase; CGS, cystathionine γ-synthase; DPD, 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione;
