caption: Proposed pathway for the investigation of endometrial adenocarcinoma/carcinosarcoma
  with MMR IHC, tumor and matched germline sequencing, and MLH1 promoter methylation.
  MMR IHC is performed and results in either deficient (dMMR) or proficient (pMMR)
  categorization. For dMMR cases showing a loss of MLH1/PMS2 protein expression, MLH1
  promoter methylation testing should then be performed, and an assessment of TMB
  may be considered by DNA sequencing (eg, by WES). Germline MMR (gMMR) testing is
  performed for dMMR cases (and if MLH1 methylation is negative), and if it is positive
  for a pathogenic variant, EC would be categorized as dMMR gMMR mutated (Lynch syndrome).
  If gMMR testing is negative, then DNA sequencing of the tumor may be performed as
  part of a panel or WES to categorize EC as dMMR somatic MMR (sMMR) mutated. EC on
  a pink background is favored to receive single‐agent ICI therapy. EC on the blue
  background is favored to be considered for combination ICI therapy. In the pink
  background, a transition from dark pink to pale pink indicates an immunologically
  hot tumor to a less warm tumor; the blue background indicates an immunologically
  cold tumor. The MMR genes are MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MLH1. dMMR indicates mismatch
  repair deficiency; EC, endometrial cancer; gMMR, germline mismatch repair mutation;
  ICI, immune checkpoint inhibitor; IHC, immunohistochemistry; meMLH1, tumor hypermethylation
  of the MLH1 gene promoter; MMR, mismatch repair; pMMR, mismatch repair proficiency;
  POLE, polymerase ε; POLE/POLD1, somatic mutation in the exonuclease domain of either
  the POLE or POLD1 gene; sMMR, somatic mismatch repair mutation; TMB, Tumor Mutational
  Burden; WES, whole exome sequencing; wt, wild type.
