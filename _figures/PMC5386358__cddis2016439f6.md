caption: A working model summarizing the role of Survivin in adipocyte homeostasis.
  During adipocyte differentiation, Survivin expression is gradually decreased and
  almost undetectable in mature adipocytes. Upon overnutrition condition, adipocytes
  are able to expression the Survivin gene via elevated insulin levels through the
  PI3K/mTOR pathway. Re-expressed Survivin inhibits isoproterenol-stimulated adipocyte
  lipolysis via decreased Adrb3 content, as well as increased Fsp27 expression. Survivin
  also attenuates TNFα-induced lipolysis and DNA damage-related stress responses.
  Taken together, the current findings suggest that Survivin may facilitate adipocyte
  maintenance in response to obesity-induced adipocyte stress
