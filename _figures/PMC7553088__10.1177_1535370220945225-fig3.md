caption: Schematic overview of chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1) involved in asthma
  via NF-κB signaling pathway. In a mouse model of asthma, CKLF1 expression was increased
  in lung tissue, meanwhile, NF-κB was less localized in cytoplasm but more in nucleus
  which may induce Th2 cells to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. (A color version
  of this figure is available in the online journal.)
