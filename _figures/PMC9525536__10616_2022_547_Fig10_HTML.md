caption: Possible mechanism(s) of P3-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60
  cells. P3 activates MEK1/2-ERK1/2 mediated differentiation through activation of
  cytoplasmic non-receptor tyrosine kinase (Yes, Fyn, and Src). Increased levels of
  CD11b and CD15 confirmed the granulocytic lineage commitment of differentiated HL-60
  cells. The presence of PD98059, an ERK1/2 specific inhibitor, inhibited differentiation
  of HL-60 cells by P3, suggesting involvement of ERK/MAPK pathway in P3-induced differentiation
