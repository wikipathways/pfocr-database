caption: Proposed model for substance P-induced suppression of GABAergic transmission
  in the PAG. Substance P (SubP) activates NK1, NK2, and NK3 (NK1–3) receptors located
  on glutamatergic (GLU) neurons to elicit action potential (AP) generation via the
  opening of a nonselective cation conductance (Icat) and suppression of a G-protein-coupled
  inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) conductance (). The resultant action potential-driven
  glutamate release is sufficient to overwhelm neuronal glutamate transporters, presumably
  excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) (), and engage postsynaptic mGluR5s. Synthesis
  of the endocannabinoid 2-AG subsequently occurs via catalysis of diacylglycerol
  by a 1,2-diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL). 2-AG then acts as a retrograde messenger
  to activate presynaptic CB1Rs located on the terminals of GABAergic neurons and
  to reduce GABA release. Activation of this dual excitatory and disinhibitory mechanism
  in PAG-RVM projection neurons would be predicted to then facilitate activation of
  this descending pathway.
