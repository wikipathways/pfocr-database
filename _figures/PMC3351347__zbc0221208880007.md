caption: Control of Pax3 expression in the caudal neurectoderm via NCE2. Induction
  of Pax3 expression in the posterior neural plate is controlled by the Wnt-Cdx pathway.
  Expression in the closed neural tube is later maintained by the activity of Tead2
  as well as Brn1/2 transcription factors. Restriction of Pax3 expression at the lateral
  neural plate and dorsal neural tube is ensured by repressive Shh signals emerging
  from the node, notochord, and floor plate. An unknown neuron-specific Cdx co-factor
  might also be involved in the spatial restriction of NCE2 activity.
