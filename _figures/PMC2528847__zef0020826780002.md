caption: 'Integration of genomic and nongenomic/rapid ER signaling and its crosstalk
  with growth factor receptor and cell kinase pathways in endocrine resistance: a
  working model. The ligand estrogen (E2) induces genomic ER activity in the nucleus
  (N), which results in increased gene transcription, including important genes in
  the growth factor receptor pathways. The SERM tamoxifen (Tam) antagonizes this activity.
  However, both estrogen and tamoxifen can turn on nongenomic signaling acting on
  ER that resides at the membrane (M) and/or cytoplasm (a signaling mode also known
  as membrane-initiated steroid signaling, or MISS). This induction, in turn, through
  multiple interactions with signaling intermediate molecules such as Shc and MNAR,
  can activate growth factor (GF) tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs), such as EGFR and
  HER2, and the IGFR and cellular kinases such as c-Src. Cytoplasmic signaling molecules
  such as metastasis-associated gene 1 (MTA1) can increase this non-nuclear fraction
  of ER. The interaction between membrane/cytoplasmic ER and TKRs turns on the TKR
  pathways and their downstream kinases, e.g., p42/44 MAPK and AKT. Other potential
  MISS activity involves the activation, either directly or indirectly, of G protein
  (GP)-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which can then trigger various signaling processes
  including the activation of c-Src and MMPs and subsequent cleavage and release of
  HB-EGF. The HB-EGF can then stimulate and activate the EGFR/2 signaling pathway.
  TKR-induced kinases phosphorylate (P) nuclear ER and its coactivators (CoA) as well
  as other transcription factors (TF), thus potentiating genomic ER activity, which
  results in enhanced gene expression including genes in the TKR pathways. These gene
  products in turn further augment GF-TKR signaling, thus completing the cooperative
  cycle between the two activities of ER and their crosstalk with the growth factor
  receptor and cellular kinase pathways. In the presence of excessive TKR signaling,
  such as in HER2-overexpressing tumors, the nongenomic rapid ER action may become
  more prominent. The resulting activation of downstream kinases can lead to endocrine
  resistance by modifying the activity of various transcription factors and/or negating
  the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen on nuclear ER. PKA, Protein kinase A.'
