caption: Schematic representation of IFN-I signaling in infection and cancer. (1)
  The stimulation of surface, cytosolic, and endosomal pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs), by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) during infection or by
  damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in cancer, induces IFN-I production.
  Upon activation, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) signals through TRIF and MyD88, RIG-I-like
  receptor (RLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) through MAVS, whereas DNA sensors
  engage STING. All of these adaptor molecules activate IKKε/TBK1 kinase complex,
  which in turn triggers the activation of transcription factors IRF3/7 and NF-κB,
  leading to the production of IFN-α and IFN-β. (2) Once released from infected or
  cancerous cells, IFN-α and IFN-β act in an autocrine, paracrine, and systemic manner
  by binding the heterodimeric receptor IFNAR1-2, which in turn activates JAK/STAT
  pathway leading to the transcription of multiple IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).
