caption: The proposed mechanism for CysLT1R-mediated AD pathology. Aβ accumulation
  upregulates Cys-LTs inducing CysLT1R expression, which activates NF-κB pathway followed
  by increased release of proinflammatory cytokines. Consequently, proinflammatory
  cytokines induce neuronal apoptosis and KP dysregulation with increased expression
  of IDO and KYUN and the synthesis of QUIN. Moreover, neuroinflammation accelerates
  amyloid deposition, forming a vicious circle. This leads to NMDARs overactivation
  and excitotoxicity correlated with synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits.
