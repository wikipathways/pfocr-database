caption: DNA sensors and their downstream signaling pathways. Known cytoplasmic (AIM2,
  cGAS, DAI, DDX41, DHX36, DHX9, DNAPK, LRRFIP1, MRE11, RNA Pol III) and nuclear (IFI16,
  IFIX, hnRNPA2B1) DNA sensors are indicated. Most DNA sensors converge on STING-TBK1-IRF3
  axis, where the activated DNA sensor eventually leads to the dimerization of STING.
  Subsequently, this results in the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3. Phosphorylated
  IRF3 dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus, leading to gene transcription
  of cytokines and interferons. Other pathways include the NF-κB pathway and the β-catenin
  pathway.
