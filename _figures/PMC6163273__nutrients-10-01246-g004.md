caption: Schematic representation of the gustatory pathway, depicting the major central
  synaptic relays and their connections with structures involved in metabolic, reward
  and learning, and memory processes. The lingual application of a long-chain fatty
  acid will trigger signaling events via CD36, localized in the circumvallate papillae.
  The gustatory information on dietary lipids will be conveyed to the NST via cranial
  nerves VII and IX. The NST that serves as the relay structure of the peripheral
  information will send the gustatory information to different brain areas, as mentioned
  in the Discussion section. Acb, accumbens nucleus; AI, agranular insular cortex;
  Arc, arcuate nucleus; BLA, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus; CeA, central amygdaloid
  nucleus; GI/DI, granular/dysgranular insular cortex; Hbn, habenula; Hipp, hippocampus;
  mPFC, medial prefrontal cortex; NST, nucleus of the solitary tract; PBN, parabrachial
  nucleus; PSTN/CbN, parasubthalamic nucleus/calbindin nucleus; VPM, ventral posteromedial
  thalamic nucleus; VPMPC, ventroposterior medialis parvocellularis; VTA, ventral
  tegmental area (adapted from Reference []).
