caption: Mechanisms of Hedgehog pathway activation in cancer. Ligand-independent activation
  is due to inactivating mutations in the negative regulators PTCH1 or SUFU, activating
  mutations in SMO, or amplification of GLI activators. Ligand-dependent activation
  occurs through autocrine, paracrine, or inverse paracrine mechanisms (see text for
  details). In the autocrine mechanism, tumor cells secrete and respond to HH ligands;
  in the paracrine pattern tumor cells produce HH ligands, which activate HH pathway
  in stroma cells; in the reverse-paracrine mechanism stroma cells produce HH ligands,
  which activate HH pathway in tumor cells. PTCH1, Patched 1; SMO, Smoothened; SUFU,
  Suppressor of Fused; HH, hedgehog ligand; GLIA, GLI activators; IL6, Interleukin-6;
  IGF, Insulin Growth Factor; VEGF, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor; Wnt, Wingless/Integrated.
