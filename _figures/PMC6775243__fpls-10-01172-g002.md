caption: Schematic representation of the phosphate (Pi) signaling pathway essential
  for plant adaptation to low Pi concentration. Under Pi deficiency (A), a set of
  phosphate starvation-induced (PSI) genes are transcriptionally activated through
  binding of the transcription factor PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 1 (PHR1) to the
  cis-element (P1BS) present in the promoter region of the PSI genes, and subsequently
  PHT1 and PHO1 mRNAs are induced to be necessary for Pi uptake and translocation
  in roots. The SPX1/2 and miR399 genes are also activated by PHR1 during Pi starvation.
  miR399 inhibits the ubiquitin E2 conjugase PHO2 in order to maintain the PHT1 protein
  activity at the PM. It could be proposed that the Pi signaling is activated for
  sensing external low Pi through an unknown PM Pi sensor, which induces the low Pi
  responsive genes PHT1, PHO1, SPX1/2, and miR399, whereas the PHO2 is repressed,
  thus activating the Pi regulatory pathway to modulate Pi uptake and homeostasis.
  Under high Pi concentration (B), the Pi signaling pathway is repressed, the diphosphoinositol
  pentakisphosphate kinases VIH1 and VIH2 function redundantly to synthesize InsP8,
  and InsP8 can directly bind to the SPX domain of SPX1 and is essential for the interaction
  between SPX1/2 and PHR1. This interaction leads to the inhibition of PHR1 binding
  to the cis-element P1BS present in the promoter region of the PSI genes. Thus, the
  PSI genes, including PHT1, PHO1, SPX1/2, and miR399, are transcriptionally repressed,
  while the PHO2 is activated to be responsible of the ubiquitination of PHT1 and
  PHO1 proteins to promote Pi transporters degradation. IPS1 encodes a non-coding
  RNA and enables post-transcriptional regulation under high Pi through RNA mimicry.
  IPS1-miR399 matching thus results in the inhibition of the miR399 activity to target
  PHO2. It is also predicted that there may exist an unknown PM Pi sensor responsible
  for high Pi sensing. PM, plasma membrane. The arrows and flat-ended lines refer
  to the positive and negative interactions, respectively. The dotted arrows represent
  the repression processes.
