caption: In diabetic conditions, CerS6-derived ceramide (d18:1/16:0) can bind to the
  mitochondrial channel protein VDAC1, initiating mtDNA leakage, activating the cGAS-STING
  signaling pathway, and ultimately promoting an immune-inflammatory response in the
  kidney. Collectively, we have identified a mechanism by which podocyte sphingolipid
  accumulation, mitochondrial damage, mtDNA leakage, and inflammatory responses are
  interconnected via a CerS6-mediated Cer (d18:1/16:0) synthesis pathway, which contributes
  to podocyte injury and DKD progression. This figure is Created in BioRender. https://BioRender.com/v99r843
