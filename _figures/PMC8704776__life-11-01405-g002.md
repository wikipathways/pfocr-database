caption: 'Interaction of the shelterin complex, CST complex and telomerase to maintain
  telomere length. (A) The shelterin complex is essential for telomere protection
  and for regulating telomere elongation. TIN2, RAP1, and TRF1/2 subunits of the shelterin
  complex associate with telomeric dsDNA, while POT1 and TPP1 bind telomeric ssDNA
  and are responsible for recruiting telomerase to the telomeres. The shelterin complex
  also stimulates extension of the G-overhang by telomerase. (B) The CST complex prevents
  telomerase from engaging the G-overhang and facilitates the C-strand fill-in. The
  CST complex has three components—conserved telomere protection component 1 (CTC1),
  suppressor of cdc thirteen 1 (STN1) and telomeric pathway with STN1 (TEN1)—which
  are thought to function in part in telomere lagging-strand synthesis. The human
  telomerase consists of the hTERT, the TERC, and accessory proteins. The hTERT can
  wrap the chromosome to add single-stranded telomere repeats. The TERC contains the
  template for telomere replication. When an ongoing extension of a stranded DNA is
  finished, telomerase activity is terminated at the ssDNA overhang by the CST complex,
  which also activates the C-strand fill-in: the CST complex recruits DNA polymerase
  alpha (Polα) for lagging strand synthesis of the telomeric C-strand to convert the
  newly synthesized G-overhang into double-stranded DNA.'
