caption: Global changes in metabolism and epigenome during fetal female germ cell
  differentiation, oocyte growth, and maturation. The shading of the bars represents
  the predicted activation state of each metabolic pathway, with darker bars indicating
  higher activity. The red text shows the metabolic pathways or metabolites that affect
  each process in female germ cell differentiation. PPP, pentose phosphate pathway;
  SGOC, Ser-Gly-one-carbon metabolism.
