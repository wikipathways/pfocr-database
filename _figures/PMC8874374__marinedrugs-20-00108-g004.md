caption: Two species in a microbial community interact with each other by sharing
  metabolites to fuel each other’s metabolic pathways. Metabolic pathway of species
  A needs metabolite “e1” that is not synthesized by its own metabolic machinery and
  needs to be taken up from species B through the environment. Therefore, species
  A must coexist with species B that synthesizes this metabolite. Components a1, a2,
  a3, a4, and a5 represent the genes in the metabolic pathway of species A, whereas
  b1, b2, b3, and b4 are genes in the metabolic pathway of species B. Components e1,
  e2, e3, e4, and e5 are different intermediate metabolites produced or needed by
  the two species.
