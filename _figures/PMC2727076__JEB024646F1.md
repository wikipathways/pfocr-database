caption: Leucokinin increases the paracellular Cl– conductance in  Malpighian tubules
  of Aedes aegypti. (A,B) Leucokinin-VIII increases  the transepithelial secretion
  of both NaCl and KCl. Numbers in red indicate a  statistical significant difference
  (P<0.05) from controls; (C)  electrophysiological effects of LK-VIII on the transepithelial
  voltage  (Vt) and resistance (Rt) and on the basolateral and  apical membrane voltages
  (Vbl, Va) indicate a  transepithelial short-circuit brought about by the sudden
  increase in  paracellular Cl– conductance; (D) model of transepithelial  electrolyte
  secretion in Aedes Malpighian tubules. The  transepithelial transport of Na+ and
  K+ is active and  mediated by principal cells; the transepithelial transport of  Cl–
  is passive and mediated by the paracellular pathway and  stellate cells. However,
  under conditions of diuresis triggered by aedeskinin  or kinin isoforms, the transcellular
  and paracellular pathways are  electrically so well coupled that the rates of transcellular
  cation secretion  and paracellular anion secretion are equivalent  (;  ;  ;  ).
