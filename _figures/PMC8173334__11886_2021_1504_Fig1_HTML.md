caption: 'Updates in diabetes and CVD. This review focused on recent updates in mechanisms
  underlying accelerated CVD in diabetes. In the field of epigenetics, high levels
  of glucose exert a long-lasting metabolic memory on vascular and immune cells, leading
  to molecular signatures linked to diabetes and CVD. High levels of glucose and their
  consequent increased formation of AGEs, leading to activation of RAGE, upregulate
  multiple elements of the interferon pathways, such as IRFs, IFNs, and ISGs, and
  downstream pathways that lead to CVD. Finally, evidence continues to accrue linking
  high levels of glucose and pathways such as aldose reductase (AR) and AGE-RAGE to
  oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction; such dysfunction affects a broad
  range of cell types that contribute to CVD. This review considered the evidence
  for cardioprotective roles for inhibitors of SGLT2 and for agonists of the GLP1
  Rs in clinical studies. Additionally, recent evidence links downstream consequences
  of high levels of glucose, such as increased flux through the AR pathway and AGE
  generation/RAGE activation with CVD-provoking mechanisms. Collectively, these considerations
  highlight that research has led to new therapies and new targets for therapeutic
  intervention in diabetes to prevent/mitigate CVD. Abbreviations: AGE, advanced glycation
