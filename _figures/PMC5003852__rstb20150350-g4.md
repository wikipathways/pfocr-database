caption: Cortical neuronal networks recruited by different afferent inputs. (a) Upon
  whisker stimulation, the release of glutamate (Glu) in the barrel cortex results
  in activation (c-Fos-positive, black nuclei) of pyramidal cells, including COX-2
  pyramidal cells, and of VIP interneurons that inhibit SOM interneurons, which results
  in further activation of pyramidal cells through disinhibition (blue arrow). (b)
  BF stimulation releases ACh in the cerebral cortex and activates pyramidal cells
  (and COX-2 pyramidal cells) and SOM interneurons, which results in inhibition of
  VIP interneurons contributing to further increases in cortical activity through
  disinhibition of pyramidal cells. (c) Stimulation of the LC-NA pathway recruits
  pyramidal cells and SOM (and PV) interneurons with a minority of VIP interneurons,
  which results in both activation and disinhibiton of pyramidal cells. Activation
  of these neuronal networks increases cortical activity and CBF by acting either
  directly on the blood vessels (COX-2 through PGE2) or indirectly through perivascular
  astrocytes. (?) A direct vasomotor role for GABA and co-localized peptide VIP or
  SOM in activated interneurons, or for ACh or NA released for basalocortical or LC-NA
  afferents could not be evidenced in the global CBF response. (*) the proportion
  of PV interneurons co-stained for c-Fos was not investigated in the BF pathway.
