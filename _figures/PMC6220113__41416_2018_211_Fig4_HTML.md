caption: Illustration of lipoprotein alterations in chemotherapy recipients after
  6 months. Lipoprotein metabolism subsequent to lipid absorption into the body consists
  of two interacting pathways. The endogenous pathway supplies lipids to tissues through
  VLDL, which is hydrolyzed sequentially into IDL and LDL by lipoprotein lipase (LPL),
  providing fatty acids (FA) to tissues. The reverse cholesterol transport pathway
  transports cholesterol back to the liver and to other lipoproteins by HDL. In chemotherapy
  recipients, VLDL, IDL and small LDL particles are increased, while HDL particles
  are decreased after 6 months. There is also triglyceride (TG) enrichment of LDL
  and HDL. The directions and number of arrowheads indicate the direction and magnitude
  of the change for each lipoprotein subclass. Figure by Ellen Tenstad/Science Shaped
