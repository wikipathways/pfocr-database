caption: A model of the effect of miR-377 on the NF-kB signaling pathway. A schematic
  model of the potential effect of miR-377 on the NF-kB signaling pathway in melanoma
  cells. Silencing of miR-377 upregulates MAP3K7. MAP3K7 phosphorylates and activates
  the IKK complex, leading to the phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation
  of NFKB1A. This frees NF-κB, which is then activated, trans-located to the nucleus
  and activates transcription of multiple genes.
