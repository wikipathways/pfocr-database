caption: 'Potential Targets for Directed Pharmacological Interventions to Prevent
  Immunotoxicities and Lower the Risk of Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses in Viral
  Vector Gene TransferImmunoglobulins in red indicate blockage of a pathway with a
  monoclonal antibody. Abbreviations are as follows: cGAS, cyclic guanosine monophosphate-AMP
  synthase; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; DC, dendritic cell; IL, interleukin; INF,
  interferon; MDA5, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5; MF, macrophage;
  mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible gene I; Teff,
  effector T cell; TLR, Toll-like receptor; and Treg, regulatory T cell. Receptor
  for a specific cytokine is indicated with “R” after the cytokine name.'
