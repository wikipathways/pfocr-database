caption: 'All AAS are androgens and have direct action through binding to nuclear
  androgen receptors (AR), as well as estrogen receptor α and β (ERα;ERβ) and progestin
  receptors (PR) [1.], promoting receptor dimerization, translocation to the nucleus,
  and regulation of gene expression through interactions with cognate hormone response
  elements (HRE) [2.]. Some AAS (such as nandrolone decanoate) may also be aromatized
  to estrogens [3.] providing an alternate pathway for interactions with classical
  ERα and β. AAS also promote effects in the nervous system through non-genomic mechanisms
  including putative actions through G protein-coupled metabotropic receptors linked
  to second messenger signaling pathways [4.]; direct allosteric modulation of gating
  of GABAA receptors [5.]; direct allosteric inhibition of aromatase by some AAS (such
  as 17α-methyltestosterone) [6.]: an action that can then indirectly affect classical
  signaling through ERα and β and regulation of MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of
  NMDA receptors [7].'
