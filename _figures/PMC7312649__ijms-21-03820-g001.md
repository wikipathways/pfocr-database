caption: 'Overview of the main cellular and mitochondrial energy metabolism pathways.
  Mitochondrial metabolic pathways are fueled by glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids
  through respective catabolic processes to produce acetyl-CoA, a primary substrate
  for the TCA cycle, which is also recycled in the fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) pathway
  producing NADH and FADH2 reducing equivalents that feed the ETC CI and CII, respectively.
  Glucose undergoes glycolysis in the cytoplasm to form pyruvate which is converted
  into acetyl-CoA in mitochondria by the PDHC. Acetyl-CoA enters a series of enzyme-catalyzed
  reactions in the TCA cycle producing reduced forms of NADH and FADH2 required for
  the transport of electrons to the ETC (the flow of electrons is illustrated by a
  grey dashed line). CI, CIII and CIV pump protons from the matrix to the IMS, generating
  a proton-motive force across the IMM, that drives the flux of protons back into
  the matrix via the ATP synthase to harness energy released in the form of ATP. The
  oxidation of NADH and FADH2 via CI and CII replenishes the electron acceptors NAD+
  and FAD to maintain TCA cycle activity. Fatty acids are imported into the mitochondria
  in the form of fatty-acyl-CoA via the carnitine shuttle system (CPT1 and CPT2) to
  enter the β-oxidation cyclic pathway. Initially, fatty acyl-CoAs undergo dehydrogenation
  resulting in a production of a FADH2 reducing equivalent that transfers electrons
  to the electron transfer protein ETF and subsequently to the ubiquinone pool via
  the ETF ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO), thus facilitating the entry of electrons
  to CIII. The remaining three catalytic steps involve hydration, second dehydrogenation
  during which NAD+ is reduced to NADH that is subsequently re-oxidized by CI, and
  thiolysis. In the final step, two carbons are removed from the fatty acyl-CoA ester,
  resulting in shortening of the entry product and its recycling via the FAO pathway.
  In addition, a molecule of acetyl-CoA is generated that contributes to the overall
  mitochondrial pool of acetyl-CoA used in the TCA cycle. Amino-acid degradation also
  contributes to the production of pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, or metabolic intermediates
  to be oxidized in TCA cycle. Abbreviations are as follows: CI: Complex I, CII: Complex
  II, CIII: Complex III, CIV: Complex IV, CV: Complex V, CoQ: coenzyme Q/ubiquinone,
  cyt c: cytochrome c, Acetyl-CoA: acetyl coenzyme A, PDHC: pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex, CPT1/2: carnitine palmitoyltrasnferase 1/2, ETF: electron transfer flavoprotein,
  ETF-DH: ETF dehydrogenase, NADH: nicotinamide adenine nucleotide, FADH2: flavin
  adenine dinucleotide, ADP: adenosine diphosphate, ATP: adenosine triphosphate.'
