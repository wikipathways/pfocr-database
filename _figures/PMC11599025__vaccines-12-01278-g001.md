caption: Innate immune responses against ASFV infection. Upon invading its primary
  target cells, macrophages, ASFV is recognized by both cell surface and intracellular
  pattern recognition receptors. This recognition triggers a cascade of signals transmitted
  through various signaling pathways, activating transcription factors such as NF-κB
  and IRF3, which regulate the production of IFNs and inflammatory cytokines. When
  IFNs bind to their receptor complex, they induce multiple downstream signaling pathways,
  leading to a range of biological effects. The classical STAT1/STAT2 signaling complex
  interacts with ISRE elements in gene promoters, resulting in the induction of numerous
  interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Additionally, STAT1 homodimers can signal inflammatory
  responses. The NLRP3 signaling pathway is also activated, leading to pyroptosis
  in infected cells. During the transcription stage of ASFV infection, ASFV proteins
  (highlighted in red) inhibit the production of both IFNs and inflammatory cytokines.
  Notably, different ASFV strains exhibit varying effects on the antigen presentation
  function of macrophages. Created with BioRender.com
