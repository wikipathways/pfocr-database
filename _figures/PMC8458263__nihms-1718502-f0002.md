caption: 'Inhibition of components of the RSR ultimately leads to cell cycle checkpoint
  abrogation and inappropriate mitotic entry of cells with unresolved DNA damage.
  This culminates in mitotic catastrophe and resultant micronuclei formation. Cytosolic
  DNA fragments released bind to and activate the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS, which
  binds to the adaptor STING. When activated, STING translocates into Golgi body compartments
  and activates TBK1, which phosphorylates IRF3. IRF3 enters the nucleus to facilitate
  transcription of Type I interferon, TNFα, and interleukins. Type I interferon upregulates
  chemokines CCL5 and CXCL10, which encourage effector T cell infiltration into the
  tumor. Created with Biorender.com. Abbreviations: ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated;
