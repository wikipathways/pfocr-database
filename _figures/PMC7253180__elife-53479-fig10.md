caption: (A) Starting from state A, which reflects the structure seen in WT CLC-ec1,
  a single Cl– is bound, and Gluex is in the ‘middle’ position. Gluin and E113 are
  in a H-bonded configuration, restricting water access to the center of the protein.
  Moving clockwise, binding of Cl– from the intracellular side displaces Gluex by
  a ‘knock-on’ mechanism (), making it available for protonation from the extracellular
  side (State B). This protonation step generates state C, which reflects the structure
  seen in E148Q CLC-ec1, with Gluex in the ‘up’ conformation. A subsequent H+-induced
  conformational change generates a state D (captured in the QQQ mutant structure),
  which has an open extracellular vestibule and new positionings for Gluex and Gluin.
  Conformational dynamics of Gluin allows water pathways to connect Gluex directly
  to the intracellular bulk water, as in state E. From State E, deprotonation of Gluex
  promotes its return to the anion pathway, in competition with Cl– (state F). Binding
  of Cl– from the intracellular side, coordinated with inner-gate opening () (reflected
  by the dotted lines) generates the original state A. (B) The updated transport model
  is consistent with Cl–/H+ exchange seen in transporters that do not have a titratable
  residue at the Gluin position, such as cmCLC. The upper panel shows a structural
  overlay of QQQ and cmCLC, highlighting the positions of the Thr and Lys residues
  occurring at the Gluin and E113 positions respectively. The lower panel is a cartoon
  depiction of the water pathway.
