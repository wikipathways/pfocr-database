caption: The 5S RNP complex (RPL5, RPL11 and 5S rRNA) regulates MDM2-p53 in response
  to cellular stress. Schematic overview showing the role of the 5S RNP in coupling
  disturbances in ribosome production that can be triggered by inhibitors of ribosomal
  RNA synthesis, mutations in essential ribosome components, nutrient stress, and
  replicative stress. Stabilization of p53 in response to illegtimate activation of
  oncogenes (c-Myc) relies partially on 5S RNP. Oncogenic stress also induces the
  ARF tumor suppressor that in turn inhibits ribosome biogenesis. Besides, ARF interacts
  with 5S RNP through RPL11/MDM2 association. Not shown in the figure is the DNA damage
  sensing pathway through ATM/ATR kinases that is connected to ARF and p53.
