caption: According to this model, early in the course of ovarian cancer, the FANCF
  gene is methylated, leading to chromosome instability. Chromosome instability allows
  for the inactivation of other tumor suppressor genes, by loss of heterozygosity
  (LOH), and the generation of new fusion oncogenes. The tumor is hypersensitive to
  cisplatin, but, after cisplatin exposure, the tumor reemerges as a cisplatin resistant
  tumor with unmethylated FANCF. Theoretically, an inhibitor of the FA/BRCA pathway
  may re-sensitize the relapsed tumor to cisplatin.
