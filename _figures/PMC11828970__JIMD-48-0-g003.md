caption: Simplified pathways of ammonia metabolism and treatment. Chemicals in green
  are involved in emergency treatment that is discussed in this article. Chemicals
  in yellow are used for the treatment of some conditions but not in emergencies and
  not discussed here. *Carglumic acid is a therapeutic analogue of N‐acetylglutamate.
  †Benzoate binds to and removes glycine. ‡Phenylacetate binds to and removes glutamine.
  §CPS1 is upregulated by CMP‐CPS‐001 (see text). ‖These amino acids are given to
  treat various disorders. ARG, arginase; ASL, argininosuccinate lyase; ASS, argininosuccinate
  synthetase; CPS1, carbamoyl‐phosphate synthetase 1; HCO3 −, bicarbonate; NAGS, N‐acetylglutamate
