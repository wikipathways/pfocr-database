caption: 'Proposed mechanism of platelet activation. When an activating HLA antibody
  (ab) binds to HLA on the platelet surface it crosslinks with FcγRIIa. This induces
  FcγRIIa-dependent signaling leading to the activation of Syk via the ITAM motif
  on FcγRIIa. Downstream signaling leads to platelet activation: α-granules are released
  (followed by e.g. CD62P exposure), integrin αIIbb3 is activated and platelets start
  to aggregate. This activation pathway can be inhibited by IV.3 (which blocks crosslinking
  with FcγRIIa) or Syk inhibitor IV (which blocks signaling via Syk). HLA antibodies
  that bind to an epitope on HLA preventing interaction with FcγRIIa do not induce
  platelet activation. FcγRIIa-dependent signaling also leads to phosphatidylserine
  exposure and induces enhanced phagocytosis by macrophages.'
