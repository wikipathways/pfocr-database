caption: TRIM25 regulates the RIG-I- and MDA5-mediated antiviral and TRAF2/TNFα signaling
  pathways. RIG-I/MDA5 remains in a closed conformation until the binding of viral
  RNA to open the RIG-I CARDs domain. TRIM25 ubiquitinates RIG-I to trigger RIG-I/IFN
  signaling. TRIM25 also binds to 14-3-3ε to enable RIG-I activation and accumulation
  and interacts with TRAF6 to induce downstream signaling. In addition, TRIM25 can
  modify TRAF2, a member of the TRAF family, independently of RIG-I/MDA5 signaling.
