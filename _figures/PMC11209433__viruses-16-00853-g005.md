caption: 'Potential interactions among genes involved in the type 1 interferon signaling
  pathway using STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins).
  The colored edges reflect different types of protein-protein interactions: red edges
  indicate interactions curated from known databases, green edges depict interactions
  predicted through gene fusions, and blue edges represent gene co-occurrence. The
  proteins jointly contribute to a shared function and do not necessarily physically
  bind to each other. The nodes are color-coded to represent query proteins and their
  interaction shells: dark red for the first shell of interaction and light red for
  the second shell. Similarly, nodes are colored dark and light blue to denote the
  interaction shells'
