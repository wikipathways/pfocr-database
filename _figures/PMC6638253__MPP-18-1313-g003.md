caption: Examples of the regulation of plant immunity by conventional and unconventional
  ubiquitination. The conventional K48‐linked ubiquitination usually targets substrate
  proteins for 26S proteasome‐dependent degradation, as in several examples shown
  in this figure. The U‐box proteins PUB12/PUB13 and PUB22 attenuate pathogen‐associated
  molecular pattern (PAMP)‐triggered immunity (PTI) signalling by targeting the pattern
  recognition receptor FLS2 and the exocyst complex subunit Exo70B2, respectively,
  for 26S proteasome‐dependent degradation. During the co‐evolution between pathogens
  and plants, pathogens have evolved effectors to modulate the host ubiquitin system
  to subvert plant immunity. The avirulence effector AvrPiz‐t from Magnaporthe oryzae
  targets the positive PTI regulators, APIP6 and APIP10, for degradation to suppress
  PTI in rice. As a mechanism of counterattack by the plant, APIP6 and APIP10 ubiquitinate
  AvrPiz‐t, leading to the degradation of the effector to promote host immunity. In
  addition, APIP6 ubiquitinates the negative immunity regulator OsELF3‐2 to promote
  PTI, and APIP10 functions as a negative regulator of the R protein Piz‐t‐mediated
  effector‐triggered immunity (ETI). Two other bacterial effectors, AvrptoB and XopL,
  exhibit C‐terminal ubiquitin ligase activity. AvrPtoB ubiquitinates the receptor
  proteins FLS2 and CERK1, as well as the protein kinase Fen, for degradation to suppress
  PTI and ETI, respectively. XopL specifically interacts with plant ubiquitin E2 enzymes,
  AtUBC28 and AtUBC11, to mediate the formation of predominantly K11‐linked polyubiquitin
  chains to target as yet unknown substrate(s). In the regulation of plant immunity
  by unconventional ubiquitination, K63‐linked ubiquitination has been shown to be
  involved in Fen‐mediated immunity. However, it is unknown at present how FNI3/SUV‐directed
  K63‐linked ubiquitination regulates Fen‐mediated immunity. K63‐linked polyubiquitination
  also functions as a dual targeting signal for BRI1 internalization and sorting along
  the endocytic pathway to remove the suppression effect of PTI by brassinosteroid
  (BR) signalling. The Arabidopsis ubiquitin E2 AtUBC1/AtUBC2 and RING‐type E3 ligases
  HUB1/HUB2 together mediate the monoubiquitination of histone H2B to tune plant immunity
  through an effect on the expression of plant immunity‐associated genes. BIK1, botrytis‐induced
  kinase 1; BSK1, BR‐signalling kinase 1; BSU1, BRI1 suppressor protein 1; CDG1, constitutive
  differential growth 1; CERK1, chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1; TGN/EE, trans‐Golgi
  network and early endosome; Ub, ubiquitin.
