caption: Administration of the Akt kinase inhibitor MK-2206 post BCG vaccination confers
  higher protection against aerogenic infection. Immunization with BCG induces IL-10
  production and also promotes macrophage survival by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway. The activated Akt translocate into the nucleus and phosphorylates FOXO3.
  The phosphorylation of FOXO3 results in cytoplasmic accumulation and its subsequent
  degradation. This subsequently results in suppression of Th1 immune response and
  host antimicrobial pathways, which favors bacterial intracellular replication. In
  contrast, inhibition of BCG-mediated Akt activation by MK-2206 subsequently results
  in FOXO3 activation which triggers apoptosis and reduces IL-10 secretion. This eventually
  results in disruption of growth niche for intracellular replication of BCG, promotes
  recruitment of APCs and efferocytosis, an important source of antigen presentation.
  Finally, this leads to optimal induction of antigen specific T cells and the generation
  of higher memory T cell response that translates into better protection against
  challenge with Mtb in mice and guinea pigs.
