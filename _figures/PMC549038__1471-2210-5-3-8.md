caption: Hypothetical cross-talk between phospholipase D and sphingomyelin pathways
  in astrocytes, and effect of ethanol. Phosphatidic acid (PA), the product of phosphatidylcholine
  (PC) hydrolysis by phospholipase D (PLD), inhibits hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM)
  by sphingomyelinase (SMase). Vice versa, ceramide (Cer), the product of SM hydrolysis
  by SMase, inhibits activation of PLD. Ethanol induces apoptosis by disrupting the
  mitogenic PLD signaling pathway thereby decreasing the PA:Cer ratio and disinhibiting
  the pro-apoptotic SMase pathway.
