caption: Interventions aiming to target neurovascular coupling dysfunction via reestablishment
  of •NO bioavailability. The •NO bioavailability can be increased either by stimulating
  its production (blue arrows) or by decreasing its degradation (orange arrows). The
  NOS-dependent •NO production can be increased by providing substrates for the enzyme
  (arginine or its precursor, citrulline) and via the post-translational regulation
  of the enzyme (e.g., signaling pathways stimulated by polyphenols and/or exercise).
  Additionally, the •NO synthesis can be enhanced via the alternative nitrate-nitrite-•NO
  pathway. The limitation of •NO scavenging can be achieved by decreasing the production
  of superoxide radical (both nitrate/nitrite supplementation and exercise can decrease
  the activity/expression of NOX enzymes).
