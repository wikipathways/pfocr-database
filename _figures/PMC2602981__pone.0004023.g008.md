caption: Diagram illustrating how inhibition of ABCG2 could lead to accumulation of
  PPIX and elevated levels of ROS, which in turn caused DNA damage and eventually
  activating p53 and γH2AX, Activation of p53 lead to downregulation of Nanog whilst
  γH2AX causes cell cycle arrest. Also depicted in the diagram is possible involvement
  of PI3K/AKT a well as hypoxia in this pathway.
