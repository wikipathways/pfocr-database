caption: 'The role of FXR in NAFLD. Activation of FXR by bile acid (BA) ligands leads
  to a reduction in bile acid production and an enhancement of lipid and glucose metabolism.
  In terms of the bile acid pathway, this activation results in the upregulation of
  FGF19 and the downregulation of CYP7A1, consequently leading to a decrease in bile
  acid synthesis. Additionally, the activation of FXR increases the levels of SHP,
  which subsequently lowers the expression of SREBP1c, PEPCK, and G6Pase. As a result,
  there is an increase in both lipid and glucose metabolism. Abbreviations: GLP-1:
  Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; FGF19: Fibroblast Growth Factor 19; FGFR: Fibroblast Growth

  Element; SHP: Small Heterodimer Partner; CYP7A1: Cholesterol 7 Alpha-Hydroxylase.'
