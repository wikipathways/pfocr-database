caption: The blockage of ERK1/2 and CREB inhibited the protection provided by artemisinin
  in DEXA-damaged BMSCs. The blockage of ERK1/2 and CREB inhibited the protective
  effect of artemisinin against DEXA-induced damage, including apoptosis induction,
  ROS accumulation, and Δψm loss. All the data strongly suggest that the protective
  effect of artemisinin against DEXA-induced damage in BMSCs is mediated, at least
  in part, by the ERK1/2-CREB signaling pathway.
