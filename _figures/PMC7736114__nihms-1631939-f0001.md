caption: 'BAG3 serves as a co-chaperone for both the constituitively expressed and
  the inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsc70/Hsp70): its BAG domain binding with the
  ATPase binding site of Hsc70/Hsp70. Hsp70-BAG3 interactions mediate chaperone assisted
  autophagy by shuttling client proteins along the cellular micro-tubular apparatus
  that are dedicated to eliminating mis-folded proteins. The BAG domain also couples
  with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. Two
  highly conserved IPV (Ile-Pro-Val) motifs allow BAG3 to interact with the small
  heat shock proteins HspB8 and HspB6 to support macroautophagy, a process in which
  mis-folded or damaged proteins and organelles (e.g. mitochondria) are sequestered
  in autophagosomes and degraded whereas the second IPV domain binds to αβ-crystallin
  with the subsequent inhibition of protein aggregation. The WW domain plays a pivotal
  role in chaperone-assisted selective autophagy or CASA, a tension-induced autophagy
  pathway that is essential for mechano-transduction in muscle and immune cells, .
  The WW region also couples with the PXXP region to modify the three-dimensional
  structure of the protein. The proline-rich PXXP region also facilitates binding
  to the SH3 (Src homology 3)-containing protein phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) with subsequent
  stimulation of invasion, adhesion and migration of cancer cells,  and the retrograde
  transport of mis-folded proteins to peri-nuclear aggresomes.'
