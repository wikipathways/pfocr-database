caption: '(A) Valinomycin synthetase contains two distinct NRPS enzymes Vlm1 (374
  kDa) and Vlm2 (284 kDa) that are composed of adenylation (A), ketoreductase (KR),
  thiolation (T), condensation (C), epimerase (E), and thioesterase (TE) domains.
  A domains select and activate three substrates (pyruvate, α-ketoisovalerate (α-Kiv),
  and l-valine (l-Val)). T domains are responsible for the translocation of the bound
  aminoacyl or peptidyl intermediate between adjacent catalytic positions. C domains
  catalyze the formation of peptide bond and elongate the peptide chain. The KR domain
  in Module 1 reduces α-Kiv to d-hydroxyisovalerate (d-Hiv). The E domain in Module
  2 converts l-Val to d-valine (d-Val). The KR domain in Module 3 reduces pyruvate
  to l-lactate (l-Lac). The four modules of valinomycin synthetase are iteratively
  reused to assemble three tetradepsipeptide monomers, which are eventually oligomerized
  and macrolactonized to form the 36-membered cyclododecadepsipeptide valinomycin.
  (B) Regeneration of the functionality of T domains in NRPS catalyzed by type II
  thioesterase (TEII). (C) Cell-free biosynthesis of valinomycin with different strategies:
  cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), cell-free metabolic engineering (CFME), and
  a coupled CFPS-MS approach. CE, cell extract.'
