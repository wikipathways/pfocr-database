caption: (A) Schematic representation of methanol dehydrogenase (MDH)- and MaDH-mediated
  methylamine metabolism in M. extorquens. Primary oxidation generates free formaldehyde,
  which is oxidized to formate by the H4MPT-dependent C1 dissimilation pathway. Formate
  is reduced by the H4F-dependent C1 assimilation pathway and assimilated using the
  serine cycle. The reaction highlighted in red, mediated by FtfL (formyl-tetrahydrofolate
  ligase), is unique to this topology. (B) Schematic representation of chloromethane
  metabolism in M. extorquens CM4. Primary oxidation produces H4F derivatives, using
  an H4F-dependent C1 dissimilation pathway, and completely bypasses formaldehyde
  production. Methylene tetrahydrofolate (CH2=H4F) is assimilated using the serine
  cycle. The reactions highlighted in orange, which are catalyzed by enzymes of the
  H4F-dependent C1 dissimilatory pathway (MetF, FolD, and PurU), are unique to this
  topology. (C) Schematic representation of the metabolic network involved in methylamine
  growth if the end product of the N-methylglutamate pathway is formaldehyde. The
  condensation of formaldehyde and H4F to form CH2=H4F, highlighted in blue, is unique
  to this topology. (D) Schematic representation of the metabolic network involved
  in methylamine growth if the end product of the N-methylglutamate pathway is CH2=H4F.
  CH2=H4F enters the H4MPT-mediated C1 assimilation pathway either by dissociation
  to formaldehyde (I) or by a direct cofactor switch (II). These two alternate reactions,
  indicated by green arrows, are unique to this topology.
