caption: Model outlining the proposed relationship between Gh_TT16, Re, MBW complex,
  and PABGs in proanthocyanin synthesis by Figdraw. We propose that Gh_TT2, regulated
  by the upstream transcription factor Gh_TT16, forms a complex with Gh_TT8 and Gh_WD.
  This complex binds to the promoter regions of pathway structural enzymes CHS, ANR,
  ANS, and LAR, exerting regulatory effects. During this process, the regulatory element
  Re involved in anthocyanin synthesis also binds to ANS as part of the complex. The
  competitive regulation between the complex and Re directs the metabolic flux, ultimately
  affecting the ratio of proanthocyanins and anthocyanins in cells. Consequently,
  different colors are manifested in cotton fibers. Phe, phenylalanine; PAs, proanthocyanins;
  A, anthocyanidins. The red crescent represents metabolic flow, the white wavy shape
  indicates bHLH transcription factor binding sites (E-box), the white 4-pointed star
  represents MYB transcription factor binding sites (MBS), and the white 5-pointed
  star represents ABS-MADS transcription factor binding sites (CArG box)
