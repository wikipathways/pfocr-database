caption: 'Serum-free medium harvested from mouse peritoneal macrophages that had been
  exposed to LDL (control cells) or acetyl-LDL (foam cells) was analyzed with LC-ESI-MS/MS.
  Pathway analysis was performed on all 542 proteins detected with high confidence.Panel
  A: Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of network proteins. Modules enriched in GO functional
  categories relative to the entire mouse genome were identified by Fisher’s exact
  test. The number of proteins in each module is proportional to the size of the box,
  while the number of proteins shared by 2 modules is proportional to the thickness
  of the line connecting the boxes.Panel B: Schematic representation of the protein
  interaction network determined by pathway analysis. The network is comprised of
  238 proteins (nodes) and 505 interactions (edges).Panel C: The 6 most highly connected
  proteins (circled in black in Panel B) in the interaction network. Sub-network of
  the 6 most highly connected proteins (hubs) in the overall network. Note that 5
  of the 6 hubs are themselves highly interconnected.Panel D: Immune response and
  complement regulation modules (purple and pink spheres in Panel B, respectively).'
