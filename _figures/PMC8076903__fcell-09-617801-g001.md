caption: 'TRPs-mediated signaling pathways in gliomas. (A) Anti-tumorigenic TRPs-mediated
  signaling pathways in gliomas. Cartoon depicting TRP channels signaling pathways
  suppressing gliomas progression through the inhibition of pro-tumorigenic pathways
  (in red) and/or the activation of anti-tumorigenic signaling pathways (in green).
  TRPM2 and TRPML1 upon ROS activation promote cell apoptosis through an increase
  in oxidative stress and intracellular Ca2+ concentration; due to its localization
  on the lysosomal membrane TRPML1 may also mediates the autophagic cell death pathway
  through the interaction with HSP; TRPA1 under hypoxia promotes apoptosis inducing
  ROS formation and inhibiting antioxidants such as GSH; TRPV1 upon stimulation with
  CPS triggers the apoptotic pathway through p38 MAPK and reduces glioma expansion
  via ER pathway in a ATF3-dependent manner; TRPV2 reduces cell proliferation and
  enhances the Fas-induced apoptosis in an ERK-dependent manner; TRPV2 also acts on
  cell differentiation since its overexpression is associated with GFAP and βIII-tubulin
  increased expression and its activation by CBD promotes Aml-1 up-regulation via
  PI3K/AKT pathway; finally, TRPV2 activation by CBD can improve cell sensitivity
  to chemotherapeutic agents favoring drug uptake. (B) Pro-tumorigenic TRPs-mediated
  signaling pathways in gliomas. Cartoon depicting TRP channels signaling pathways
  promoting gliomas progression through the activation of pro-tumorigenic pathways
  (in red) and/or the inhibition of anti-tumorigenic signaling pathways (in green).
  TRPC1 affects cell growth and cell proliferation mainly promoting cytokinesis in
  response to lipid activation, whereas upon stimulation with growth factors it induces
  chemotactic migration; TRPC6 affects cell proliferation, tumor growth and angiogenesis
  likely through the Ca2+-induced activation of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway, whereas
  TRPC6 effects on cell migration might rather involve Rho activation and subsequent
  actin cytoskeleton rearrangements; TRPV4 promotes cell migration and tumor invasiveness
  through the AKT-mediated Rac1 activation; TRPM8 supports glioma progression by inhibiting
  apoptosis through MAPK pathway and impairing the cell cycle through the activation
  of BK channels and the subsequent CaMKII-mediated inhibition of phosphatases like
  Cdc25C and Cdc2; TRPM8 effects on cell migration/invasion are also associated with
  BK channels activation and the function of TRPM8 in aggressiveness and resistance
  to treatment may also be potentiated by TKR-mediated HGF/SF stimulation; TRPM7 increases
  glioma cell proliferation and invasion through the down-regulation of miR-28-5p
  and the subsequent up-regulation of oncogenic signaling pathways involving AKT,
  ERK, IGF-1 and Rap1b; TRPM7 effects on glioma proliferation may also be mediated
  by Notch and/or JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways and through the activation of STAT3;
  TRPM7 might also be involved in GSC renewal and differentiation thanks to the up-regulation
  of the well-known GSC marker ALDH1; the hypermethylation of TRPM3 promoter through
  the down-regulation of miR-204 enhances cell migration; TRPML2 enhances cell proliferation
  and slows down apoptosis improving DNA repair and inhibiting Caspase 3 likely through
  PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 pathways. Abbreviations: ROS, reactive oxygen species; HSP,
  heat shock proteins; GSH, glutathione; CPS, capsaicin; ATF3, transcription factor-3;
  CBD, cannabidiol; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; Aml-1, acute myeloid leukemia
  transcription factors; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinases; AKT, protein-kinase B;
  HGF/SF, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PDGF,
  platelet-derived growth factor; TKR, tyrosine kinase receptor; NFAT, nuclear factor
  of activated T-cells; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BK, big potassium
  channels; CaMKII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; Cdc25C and Cdc2,
  cell division cycle proteins; JAK2, janus kinase 2; STAT3, signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases; IGF-1,
  insulin-like growth factor-1; GSC, glioma stem cells; ALDH1, aldehyde dehydrogenase
