caption: PAH exposure and resultant metabolism may produce inactive metabolites via
  the CYP, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), or glutathione S-transferase (GST) pathways.
  Active metabolites may also be produced during PAH metabolism when metabolized by
  CYP1-epoxide hydrolase pathway or the aldo-keto reductase pathway. Production of
  these metabolites occurs in the liver as well, which can contribute to the effects
  seen in the lungs. These active metabolites can then form DNA adducts, resulting
  in DNA mutations and altered gene regulation. They can also form protein adducts,
  which directly alters protein function. Finally, the active metabolites may oxidize
  DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids, contributing to altered function of macromolecules.
  All three of these alterations lead to lung cancer.
