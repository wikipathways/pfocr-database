caption: Working model of endosomal trafficking of LDLR. Following endocytosis, LDLR
  is transported to endosomes, where the receptor is directed to the late endosomes
  and lysosomes for PCSK9- or IDOL-mediated degradation or is retrieved from this
  pathway and recycled back to the plasma membrane. The CCC complex is known to facilitate
  recycling of LDLR by a direct interaction between CCC subunit COMMD1 with LDLR,
  whereas WASH drives formation of actin patches on endosomal sorting domains to regulate
  LDLR recycling. Although the function of retromer and retriever in LDLR recycling
  has not been fully elucidated, retromer might facilitate LDLR recycling by recruiting
  CCC and WASH complexes to the endosomal membrane, and retriever might regulate LDLR
  retrieval and recycling by coupling to SNX17, an adaptor protein binding to the
  NPxY-motif in the cytosolic tail of LDLR. ESCRT = endosomal sorting complex required
  for transport; Ub = ubiquitin.
