caption: Metabolic fate of 3-chlorotoluene with an in vitro-constituted pathway comprising
  TecA tetrachlorobenzene dioxygenase and TecB chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase
  (expressed by E. coli DH5α) (pSTE44) (), chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase (CC12O)
  (both TfdCI chlorocatechol dioxygenase, derived from Wautersia eutropha JMP222 [pBBR1
  M-I] [], and chlorocatechol dioxygenase, derived from Ralstonia sp. strain PS12
  [], were used) and chloromuconate cycloisomerase (CMCI) (both TfdDI chloromuconate
  cycloisomerase, derived from Wautersia eutropha JMP222 [(pBBR1 M-I] [] and chloromuconate
  cycloisomerase, derived from Ralstonia sp. strain PS12 [], were used). The relative
  amounts of 3-chlorobenzylalcohol and chloromethylcatechols formed by E. coli DH5α
  (pSTE44) () are given in parentheses. The relative amounts of lactones formed were
  calculated on the basis of their abundance after transformation by chlorocatechol
  dioxygenase and chloromuconate cycloisomerase, taking into account 3-chlorobenzylalcohol
  formation. NF, not formed.
