caption: 2PE biosynthesis in flowers. The 2PE biosynthetic pathways are shown for
  petunia (1), rose (2; 3), and plumeria (this study). The 2PE biosynthetic pathway
  in plumeria flowers is highlighted in pink. Solid arrows indicate reactions previously
  reported, stacked arrows indicate the presence of multiple steps, and the dotted
  arrow suggests a nonenzymatic reaction. PPDC, Phenylpyruvic acid decarboxylase.
