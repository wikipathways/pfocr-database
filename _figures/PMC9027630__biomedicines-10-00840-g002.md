caption: Osteopontin-related Pathways in Microglia. The interaction of OPN with CD44
  leads to the engagement of several signaling pathways. (A) The activation of the
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT-pathway may be triggered by CD44 activation,
  followed by activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling
  pathway leading to the phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) and the subsequent
  activation of the NF-κB pathway, which causes the expression of proinflammatory
  genes on a molecular level. Moreover, CD44 and TGF-R are known to interact with
  each other which may further promote the activation of proinflammatory signaling
  pathways. (B) The activation of integrin-related pathways leads to the activation
  of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) with the subsequent recruitment of downstream
  molecules that ultimately promote actin remodeling and cell migration. The activation
  of PI3K, followed by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK) 1 and AKT
  as well as the extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK)-related pathway via
  Raf and Mitogen-activated kinase kinase (MEK) by integrins increases phagocytic
  activity in microglia.
