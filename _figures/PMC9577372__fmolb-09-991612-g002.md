caption: Canonical (Smad-dependent) and non-canonical (Smad-independent) TGFβ signalling.
  (A) Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) receptor type III (TGFβRIII) presents TGFβ
  to the type II receptor (TGFβRII). The TGFβ-TGFβRII complex phosphorylates TGFβ
  receptor type I (TGFβRI), which in turn phosphorylates R-Smads, Smad2 or Smad3.
  Phosphorylated Smad2/3 are released from the Smad anchor for receptor activation
  (SARA) protein, and translocate into the nucleus or form heterodimers/heterotrimers
  with Smad4 prior to nuclear translocation. Once in the nucleus, Smads function as
  transcription factors or interact with other transcription factors to regulate gene
  expression. Examples of genes regulated by Smads include, cyclin-dependent kinases
  (CDKs), Snail Family Transcriptional Repressor 1 and 2 (SNAIL/SLUG), Zinc Finger
  E-box Binding Homeobox one and 2 (ZEB1/ZEB2), Twist-related Protein 1 (TWIST1),
  Forkhead box C2 (FOXC2), Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), Forkhead box A2 (FOXA2), Paired-related
  Homeobox 1 (PRX1), High Mobility Group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2), and SMAD7—which in turn
  dampens TGFβ signal transduction. (B) In non-canonical transforming growth factor-β
  (TGFβ) signalling, TGFβ receptor type I (TGFβRI) phosphorylates numerous downstream
  signalling molecules including TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), src homology domain
  containing protein A (ShcA), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Although partitioning
  defective six homolog (Par6) binds to TGFβRI, it is phosphorylated by TGFβRII. TGFβRI
  kinase activity is also important for Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and cell
  division control protein 42 (CDC42) activation. The Par6/CDC42/RhoA pathway regulates
  adherens junctions, tight junctions, and stress fiber formation. PI3K phosphorylates
  protein kinase B (AKT), which inhibits Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors
  that regulate genes responsible for DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, survival, and
  T-lymphocyte function. AKT also regulates cell growth, proliferation, motility,
  and survival by activating mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). After ShcA is
  phosphorylated, it forms a complex with growth factor receptor bound 2 (Grb2) and
  sons of sevenless (Sos) to phosphorylate membrane bound Ras. This initiates a signalling
  cascade involving mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (Raf), mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1). ERK1 upregulates
  activator protein 1 (AP1) and E-twenty-six Like-1 Protein (ELK1) transcription factors.
  AP1 upregulates genes that regulate differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis,
  whereas ELK1 upregulates genes involved with cell-cell attachments, cell-extracellular
  matrix (ECM) attachments, and motility. TGFβRI phosphorylation promotes lysine (K)63-linked
  polyubiquitination of tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6).
  TRAF6 forms a complex with TAK1 binding protein two and 3 (TAB2 and TAB3) to recruit
  TAK1. TGFβRI phosphorylates TAK1, which initiates signalling cascades that phosphorylate
  mitogen-activated protein kinase 3/6 (MKK3/6). MKK3/6 phosphorylates c-Jun amino-terminal
  kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. JNK regulates c-Jun and AP1 transcription factors, whereas
  p38 MAPK regulates activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), p53, and ELK1 transcription
  factors. cJun upregulates genes involved with proliferation and survival, whereas
  ATF2 upregulates genes that modulate development, motility, apoptosis, and inflammation.
