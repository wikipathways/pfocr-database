caption: Comparison of apoptotic pathways and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The left
  panel represents the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Death receptors trigger the
  movement of pro-caspase-8 to the mitochondria, where its activation is dependent
  upon the translocation of cardiolipin from the inner to the outer mitochondrial
  membrane. This translocation follows the generation of ROS and is accompanied by
  the oxidation of cardiolipin by cytochrome c (cyt c), resulting in the loss of cardiolipin–cyt
  c association, with cyt c remaining in the intermembrane space. Active caspase-8
  cleaves Bid to tBid, which in turn triggers mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
  (MOMP). Cyt c diffuses into the cytosol through the MOMP, where it binds to APAF-1,
  resulting in assembly of the apoptosome and inducing cell death. The right panel
  depicts a proposed model for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. NLRP3 agonists cause
  mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in the generation of mitochondrial ROS. It
  is postulated that increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ occur through voltage-dependent
  anion channels (VDAC) and the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU). This results in
  a transient loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). It is unclear if the
  mitochondrial dysfunction induced by NLRP3 agonists proceeds to MOMP. Cardiolipin,
  miofusin 2 (Mfn2), and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) have been
  implicated in the association of NLRP3 with the mitochondria and are required for
  efficient inflammasome activation.
