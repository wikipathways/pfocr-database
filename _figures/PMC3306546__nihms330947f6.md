caption: This schema shows the interconnected network of the key metabolic and signaling
  pathways, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, the pentose phosphate
  pathway, and critical cell signaling pathways. Biological macromolecular synthesis
  can be influenced by these key metabolic and signaling pathways. The critical metabolic
  and signaling pathways are labeled in blue with boxes. The up-regulated proteins
  are shown in red and down-regulated proteins are in green
