caption: Aurora-A inhibitor I and Alisertib inhibit the redistribution of aquaporin-2
  (AQP2) in renal principal cells by different mechanisms. (A) Under physiological
  conditions, the binding of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) to the vasopressin V2 receptor
  (V2R) activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) and increases intracellular cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate (cAMP). The redistribution of AQP2 to the plasma membrane involves
  actin remodeling. The actin regulatory protein cofilin-1 (CFL1) is phosphorylated
  (P) at serine (Ser) 3 and thereby inactivated by LIM kinase 1 (LIMK-1) and Aurora
  kinase A (AURKA). Inactive CFL1 promotes the formation and maintenance of filamentous
  (F-)actin stress fibers. The depolymerization of F-actin into globular (G-)actin
  monomers is induced after reactivation of CFL1 by dephosphorylation by slingshot
  phosphatase 1 (SSH-1) and chronophin (CIN). (B) Aurora-A inhibitor I inhibits AURKA
  and decreases the CFL1 phosphorylation in stimulated cells. It thereby promotes
  the F-actin depolymerization. (C) Alisertib inhibits AURKA and increases the amount
  of F-actin stress fibers without affecting the CFL1 phosphorylation, indicating
  that another signaling pathway is involved.
