caption: Metabolic dysregulation in GC‐derived B‐cell lymphoma. In the mitochondrion,
  the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle produces reduced NADH and FADH2 that are used
  by complexes I to V of the electron transport chain (ETC) to generate ATP through
  oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos). The TCA can be fueled by fatty acid‐ or pyruvate‐derived
  acetyl‐CoA. Alternatively, glutamine can be used to generate alpha‐ketoglutarate
  (aKG). DLBCLs have developed dependency on SIRT3 to replenish the TCA cycle (also
  known as anaplerosis). SIRT3 stimulates glutaminolysis by activating the glutamine
  dehydrogenase (GDH). Glucose can be converted into pyruvate through glycolysis or
  used through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to generate ribose 5‐phosphate
  (R5P) and NADPH. Some GC‐derived B‐cell lymphomas depend on PP2A and G6PD, a key
  PPP enzyme, to switch glucose carbon usage from glycolysis to the PPP. This provides
  antioxidant protection and supports ribonucleotide biosynthesis in proliferating
  cells. Pyruvate can also be converted into lactate as part of the “aerobic glycolysis”
  that tumor cells use to “bypass” the TCA cycle, to generate some ATP and to create
  biomass. This is known as the Warburg effect and can be induced by MYC and HIF1‐alpha
  stabilization in DLBCL and FL. Finally, mTORC1 activation in the GC happens downstream
  of T cell‐positive selection signals via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway or downstream
  of nutrient signaling via activation of RagA/C and the v‐ATPase. These components
  either carry gain‐of‐function (GOF) mutations, are hyper‐activated, or are expressed
  at high levels in GC‐derived B‐cell lymphomas, resulting in mTORC1 constitutive
  activation. mTORC1 is the master regulator of anabolism and while constitutive activation
  is detrimental to GC B cells, it appears to favor lymphoma growth. G6PD, glucose‐6‐phosphate
  dehydrogenase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; v‐ATPase, vacuolar ATPase proton pump
