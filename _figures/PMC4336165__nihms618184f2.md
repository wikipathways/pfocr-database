caption: Following detection of DNA double-strand breaks, the MRN complex (MRE11A–RAD50–NBN)
  activates the ATM kinase. ATM in turn phosphorylates downstream effectors including
  BRCA1, CHEK2 and p53. CHEK2 and p53 activate cell cycle arrest to provide time for
  DNA damage repair, and p53 also plays a key role in apoptotic signaling. PALB2 interacts
  with BRCA1 and BRCA2 and is important for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of
  DNA repair. BARD1 and BRCA1 are structural homologs and heterodimerize through their
  amino terminal RING domains. Phosphorylated CtIP (RBBP8) and BRIP1 interact with
  BRCA1s carboxy-terminal BRCT repeats; these BRCA1-containing complexes stimulate
  homologous recombination repair and inhibit the relatively mutagenic process of
  double-strand break repair by nonhomologous end joining. The central section of
  BRCA2 (encoded by exon 11) has eight RAD51 binding sites that play a role in concentrating
  RAD51 at sites requiring repair by homologous recombination. RAD51 and its paralogs,
  including RAD51C and XRCC2, then mediate strand invasion during repair by homologous
  recombination. Solid arrows represent a direct interaction between the proteins
  indicated. Dotted arrows represent the impact of a proteins activity on the cellular
  process indicated [–].
