  working model describes the relationship between miRNA‐31 and radiosensitivity.
  The left half mainly describes the results of bioinformatic analysis, which shows
  that miRNA‐31 increases its expression in tumors by regulating cell cycle and DNA
  repair. The experiment found that the miRNA‐31 decreased after radiotherapy, and
  the possible mechanism was DNA methylation. The right half side describes the miRNA‐31/STK40
  axis, which shows that miRNA‐31 increases CRC radiosensitivity by inhibiting STK40,
  and the possible pathway was NF‐κB pathway. In addition, same as function of cancer
  promotion, miRNA‐31 can increase radiosensitivity of CRC by inhibiting DNA repairing
  consistent with RT damage. In which red lines represent bioinformatic analysis results,
  blue lines represent experimental verification results, and dashed lines represent
  possible mechanisms
