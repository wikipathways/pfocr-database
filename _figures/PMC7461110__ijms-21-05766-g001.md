caption: A partial schematic of the DNA damage response network illustrating the importance
  of both the positive and negative regulatory activities of p53 and its downstream
  target p21 on proteins involved in cytoprotective/antioxidant and cytotoxic/apoptotic
  pathways. The arrows indicate stimulation, and the T-shaped lines indicate inhibition;
  the black lines/text refer to responses seen following exposure of cells to moderate
  concentrations/doses of DNA-damaging agents typical of those where the progressive
  loss of colony-forming ability is seen; and the red lines/text refer to responses
  to high/supralethal exposures. The green arrow represents the strategy discussed
  in  whereby pharmacological inhibitors of antiapoptotic proteins such as BCL-2 and
  BCL-XL might be clinically useful for transitioning chemotherapy-induced dormant
  cancer cells (which have the potential to cause tumour recurrence/metastasis via
  the generation of para-diploid cancer stem cell (CSC)-like tumour repopulating cells)
  into an apoptotic cell-death pathway from which they will not return. TCS, therapy-induced
  cell senescence; PGCC, polyploid giant cancer cell. The protein abbreviations are
  provided in the abbreviation list.
