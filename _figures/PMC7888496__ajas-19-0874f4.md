caption: A proposed model of the role of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in the development
  of FLHS in chickens. (A) IL6 and SOCS3 in macrophages inhibit IRS-1 induced inflammation,
  hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance. (B) A proposed model of the role of the JAK-STAT
  signaling pathway in the development of FLHS in chickens. In healthy chickens, leptin
  induces satiety and increases energy expenditure. While in FLHS affected chickens,
  the activity of leptin as satiety hormone is decreased due to leptin resistance
  by suppressor gene of SOC3, inducing the dysfunction of Jak-STAT signaling pathway
  and resulting in excessive amount of abdominal fat. FLHS, fatty liver hemorrhagic
  syndrome; IL-6, interleukin-6; SOCS3, suppressor of cytokine signaling-3; IRS-1,
  insulin receptor substrate 1.
