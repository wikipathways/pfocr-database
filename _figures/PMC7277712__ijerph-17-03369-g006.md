caption: 'The bisphenol A-induced synthesis of steroids: The bisphenol A (BPA) spreads
  out through the membrane and binds the cytosolic multi-protein aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor (AhR), allowing its release in the cytoplasm by the heat shock protein
  (hsp)-90. Then the ligand-AhR complex dimerizes with a nuclear protein AhR Nuclear
  Translocator (ARNT): this process converts the AhR into the high affinity binding
  DNA form. The binding of the multimiginous complex ligand AhR-ARNT to its specific
  DNA recognition site stimulates the transcription of these genes with subsequent
  production of mRNA for cytochrome P450A1. Cytochrome P450A1 activates an adaptive
  detoxification response and stereogenesis by inducing the conversion of cholesterol
  into pregnenolone, which in turn will enter the steroid hormone synthesis pathway.
  In the meantime, the activation of estrogen receptor- alpha, due to the excess of
  estrogens for the aromatase functioning, induces the activation of steroidogenic
  acute regulatory protein (STAR) and translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) that in
  turn enhance the transport of cholesterol across the mitochondrial membrane.'
