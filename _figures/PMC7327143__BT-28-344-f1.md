caption: Vanillic acid promotes the proliferation of dermal papilla cells. (A) Structure
  of vanillic acid. (B) The viability of the dermal papilla cells (DPCs) was determined
  by WST assay. The cells were stimulated with various concentrations of vanillic
  acid or minoxidil for 24 h. The data from three independent experiments are presented
  as the mean ± SD. *p<0.05 vs. vehicle-treated control. (C) DPCs were treated with
  vanillic acid (10 μg/mL) or minoxidil (10 μM) for 24 h, and the protein levels were
  examined by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. NT, not treated; DMSO, dimethyl
  sulfoxide.
