caption: 'MYC: regulator of post‐transcriptional mechanisms. MYC directly promotes
  cap addition at its target genes by recruiting TFIIH and by indirectly upregulating
  S‐Adenyl‐l‐homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH). MYC upregulates several components of
  the alternative and constitutive splicing machinery. MYC directly upregulates the
  expression of SAGA components, which are then recruited to several MYC target genes
  involved in splicing (e.g. Hnrnpc and Prpf4). U2AF1, SF3B1, BUD31 (core components
  of the U2 snRNP), and PRMT5, an arginine methyltransferase that is essential for
  snRNPs maturation, are MYC‐synthetic lethal genes. MYC indirectly regulates RNA
  degradation by modulating the expression of AU‐binding proteins (AUBPs) and components
  of the exosome machinery. On the other hand, MYC inhibits the Nonsense Mediated
  Decay (NMD) pathway. MYC upregulates the transcription of ribosomal RNAs by RNA
  polymerase I and III, enhances pre‐rRNA processing and rRNA post transcriptional
  processing (e.g. snRNAs upregulation). MYC also regulates the expression and the
  maturation of several miRNAs, broadly affecting translation efficiency of multiple
  targets.'
