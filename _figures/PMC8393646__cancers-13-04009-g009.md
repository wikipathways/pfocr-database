caption: 'Metformin and SHMT2 functioning: a working model. The pharmacological capacity
  of metformin to operate as a PLP-competitive inhibitor of the oligomeric state of
  mitochondrial SHMT2 might offer a new perspective for understanding the anti-cancer
  mechanism of action of metformin. First, mitochondrial SHMT2 is the key channeler
  of serine-derived carbon into the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial 1C pools of THF-based
  cofactors that are required not only for nucleotide synthesis but also for mitochondrial
  respiration, including assembly of the mCI, tRNA formylation-driven translation
  of mitochondrially encoded proteins, and methylation transfer reactions in cancer
  cells. Second, the selective advantage provided by the (SHMT2) mitochondrial 1C
  metabolism versus the (SHMT1) cytosolic pathway is based on the ability of the SHMT2-dependent
  rate of mitochondrial serine-to-formate catabolism to regulate a master metabolic
  switch in nucleotide and AMPK-sensed energy metabolism. Third, the inactive apo-SHMT2
  dimer is recognized as an unexpected driver of immune signaling capable of promoting
  inflammatory cytokine signaling via interaction with the deubiquitylating BRCC36
  isopeptidase complex (BRISC). The ability of metformin to directly target the enzymatic
  activity of SHMT2 may improve our understanding of the SGOC metabolism-related anti-tumor
  actions of metformin, which should not exclusively be viewed as a downstream consequence
  of mCI targeting, but also as a causal upstream inhibitory effect against SHMT2-driven
  mitochondrial serine catabolism. Although weak, the PLP-competitive behavior of
  metformin hindering the formation of active holo-SHMT2 tetramers might synergize
  with unfavorable catalytic conditions characteristic of the folate trap imposed
  by vitamin B12 deficiency (e.g., decreased formation of the SHMT2 substrate THF
  and augmented levels of folate-trapping intermediates that inhibit SHMT2 activity)
  occurring upon metformin treatment.'
