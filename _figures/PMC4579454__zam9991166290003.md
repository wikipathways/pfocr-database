caption: 'Tryptophan-dependent biosynthesis pathways for IAA production (). The biosynthetic
  pathway used by T. vaccinum (boldface) was confirmed by feeding cells labeled precursors
  (for which structural formulas are given). Genes coding for the enzymes involved
  were identified from T. vaccinum genomic sequences: tam1 (coding for a tryptophan
  aminotransferase; GenBank accession no. KP096350), ipd1 (coding for an indole-3-pyruvic
  acid decarboxylase; GenBank accession no. KP096351), ald1 (coding for an aldehyde
  dehydrogenase; GenBank accession no. HM363121), and iah1 (coding for an indole-3-acetamide
  hydrolase; GenBank accession number KP096352). Conversion of IAN to IAA has not
  yet been fully clarified; thus this potential route is indicated as a dotted line.'
