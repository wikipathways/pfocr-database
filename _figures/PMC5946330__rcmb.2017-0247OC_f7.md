caption: Proposed role of TGF-β1 signaling in HASM cell shortening and hyperresponsiveness.
  After activated TGF-β1 binding to TβR-I/II, TβR-I kinase activity induces the phosphorylation
  of Smad2/3. After association with Smad4, the phosphorylated Smad2/3 complex translocates
  to the nucleus to mediate gene expression. Through a Smad3-dependent pathway, TGF-β1
  augments HASM cell MLC phosphorylation and hyperresponsiveness to multiple agonists.
  Additionally, TGF-β1 exerts these effects through a ROCK-dependent, RhoA-independent
  pathway. However, further details regarding the mechanism by which Smad3 may induce
  ROCK, MLC phosphorylation, and hyperresponsiveness in HASM cells remain unclear.
  The dotted lines represent potential mechanisms regulating TGF-β1–induced HASM cell
  shortening and hyperresponsiveness. The figure is modified from a previously published
  image (). Ca2+ = intracellular calcium; Ca2+/CaMKII = calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  kinase II; GPCR = G protein–coupled receptor; MLCK = myosin light light-chain kinase;
  MLCP = myosin light-chain phosphatase; SR = sarcoplasmic reticulum.
