caption: (A and B) Schematic view of (A) a third instar larval CNS and (B) an adult
  brain each composed of the ventral nerve cord (vnc) and the brain lobes. The subperineurial
  and the perineurial glia establish the BBB. The remaining glial cell types are astrocyte-like
  glia (ALG), cortex glia (CG), wrapping glia (WG), ensheathing glia (EG), and midline
  glia (MG). The thoracic neuromeres (t1 to t3) expand during pupal development, while
  the abdominal neuromers a1-8 condense. Some neuropil areas of the adult are indicated.
  (C) Signaling pathways directing the innate immune response. The Toll pathway is
  preferentially activated by Gram-positive bacteria, and the peptidoglycan recognition
  proteins (PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE) detect mostly Gram-negative bacteria. All relevant
  components are indicated. For further details, see main text.
