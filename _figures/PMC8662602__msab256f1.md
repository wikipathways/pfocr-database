caption: Cell death pathways and host defense. (A) Apoptosis is a regulated cell death
  pathway that acts as a key line of host defense against pathogens, which is executed
  by caspases via an extrinsic or intrinsic route (). (B) Necroptosis is an alternative
  regulated cell death pathway triggered by suppression of death receptor-mediated
  apoptosis by pathogens () such as poxviruses. E3 () and vMLKL () are recently described
  poxvirus factors that counteract necroptotic signaling.
