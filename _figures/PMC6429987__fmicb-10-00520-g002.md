caption: AMPK-mTOR signaling pathways during Mtb infection. During infection, Mtb
  can activate mTOR pathway to enhance lipid body formation and ULK1 inhibition. AMPK
  activation, which is induced by AMP/ATP ratio, LKB1, intracellular calcium influx,
  as well as IRGM, is required for autophagy activation through ULK1 phosphorylation
  at Ser317/555/777. Either adaptive (Th1 cytokine IFN-γ) or innate (NOD2) signaling
  can induce IRGM activation, which is required for autophagy activation. AMPK-mediated
  Beclin-1 phosphorylation also activates autophagy to enhance phagosomal maturation.
  AMPK and mTOR pathways reciprocally inhibit each other to regulate autophagy, metabolism,
  and inflammatory responses in host cells during Mtb infection. AMPK-mediated TFEB
  activation leads to lysosomal activation and fatty acid β-oxidation to suppress
  lipid body formation. Mtb-mediated Akt phosphorylation can inhibit Foxo3A activation,
  which is also required for autophagy activation in the host cells.
