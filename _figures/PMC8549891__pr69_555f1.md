caption: Pathways of HIS catabolism. The main pathway of HIS catabolism begins with
  deamination catalyzed by histidase to urocanate and leads through 4-imidazolone-5-propionate
  and FIGLU to GLU. Alternative pathways of HIS catabolism include transamination
  to imidazolepyruvate and decarboxylation to histamine. 1) histidase, 2) urocanase,
  3) imidazolone propionate hydrolase, 4) glutamate formimino transferase, 5) glutamate
  dehydrogenase, 6) alanine aminotransferase, 7) glutaminase, 8) glutamine synthetase,
  9) histidine aminotransferase, 10) histidine decarboxylase. ALA, alanine, Asp, aspartic
  acid, FIGLU, formiminoglutamate, GLN, glutamine, GLU, glutamic acid, GLY, glycine,
