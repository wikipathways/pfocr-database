caption: A probabilistic network of protein associations constructed from coexpression,
  coinheritance, colocation, and coevolution data from C. crescentus  predicts that
  genes at two disjoint chromosomal loci (CC0859–CC0861 and CC1296–CC1302) are functionally
  associated (i.e. these genes are predicted to be part of the same KEGG pathway  or
  GO process ). Genes are shown as nodes and associations as edges, with edge widths
  denoting the strength of association (confidence interval for narrow lines is 30–60%;
  confidence for thick lines is >60%).
