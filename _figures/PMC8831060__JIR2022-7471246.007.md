caption: Schematic representation of the in vitro and in vivo function of ADSC-Exos.
  ADSC-Exos promoted DPC proliferation, migration, and inhibition of apoptosis and
  downregulated miR22 in vitro. In vivo, hair growth induction was initiated by accelerating
  hair cycle progression from telogen to anagen through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway.
