caption: 'Revised model of de novo PC synthesis in Arabidopsis. Denoted in red are
  the findings of this study: a) The Arabidopsis P-base methylation pathway is catalyzed
  by four enzymes, three catalyzing all three methylation steps in planta—NMT1, NMT3,
  and NMT2.2—and a fourth PEAMT (NMT2.1) much less efficient in methylating PEA, hence
  mostly catalyzing the two subsequent methylations. b) PC cannot be produced directly
  from PE (red cross on curved dashed-arrow). c) The methylation of PEA to PMMEA is
  the sole entry point to PC synthesis (red cross denoting the absence of enzyme for
  the conversion of PE to PtdMMEA).'
