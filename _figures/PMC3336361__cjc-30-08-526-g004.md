caption: Extrinsic apoptosis is triggered by cell-surface “death receptors” of the
  tumor necrosis factor family. Upon ligand-mediated activation, these receptors cluster
  and recruit adaptor proteins (including Fas-associated death domain or FADD proteins)
  and Caspase 8 into a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) which results in activation
  of Caspase 8. Caspase 8 in turn activates the executioner caspases 3 and 7, resulting
  in cell death. The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is triggered by signals of intrinsic
  cell damage or stress. These stress/damage signals result in the activation of the
  pro-death Bcl-2 proteins, Bak and Bax, resulting in oligomerization of these proteins
  and formation of Bak or Bax-based pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Cytochrome
  c is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol via these pores. Once in the
  cytosol, cytochrome c assembles with the proteins Apaf-1 and Caspase 9 to form a
  complex known as the apoptosome, which induces activation of Caspase 9. The initiator
  Caspase 9 in turn activates the executioner caspases 3 and 7, resulting in apoptosis.
  Cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways occurs at the
  level of Bak/Bax activation. Caspase 8 cleaves and activates the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2
  protein Bid, which in turn activates Bak/Bax. In addition to cytochrome c, other
  apoptogenic proteins are released from the mitochondria during the process of intrinsic
  apoptosis. Shown in the figure is the activity of one such protein, SMAC (also known
  as Diablo). SMAC promotes apoptosis by blocking the activity of XIAP, an inhibitor
  of caspases 9, 3, and 7.
