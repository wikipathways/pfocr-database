caption: The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The ubiquitination of target proteins is
  mediated by Ub-activating (E1), Ub-conjugating (E2), and Ub-ligating (E3) enzymes.
  Substrate proteins tagged with a multiple-ubiquitin chain are degraded by a large
  2000-kD protease complex called the 26S proteasome which is composed of a 20S catalytic
  core and two 19S caps.
