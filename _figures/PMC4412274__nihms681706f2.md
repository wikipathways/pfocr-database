caption: Mechanical forces influence growth rate. (A) Expression pattern of the morphogens
  Dpp and Wg in the developing wing imaginal disc. The central region of the disc
  (wing pouch, gray) will give rise to the adult wing. (B) Model of wing disc growth
  regulation by a combination of biochemical and mechanical signals. The secreted
  morphogens form a concentration gradient from the center to the periphery of the
  wing pouch (green gradient), providing a positive signal for cell proliferation
  in the center. Localized growth in the center causes stretching forces (blue) in
  the periphery promoting proliferation, and compressive forces (red) in the center
  inhibiting proliferation. Combination of morphogen signaling and mechanical feedback
  could promote uniform growth in the wing disc. (C) The signaling activity of the
  Hippo pathway integrates biochemical and mechanical signals to regulate growth.
  Biochemical activation of the Hippo kinase leads to activation of the Warts/LATS1/2
  kinase, cytoplasmic retention of the transcription factors Yorkie/YAP and TAZ, and
  inhibition of growth. Yorkie/YAP/TAZ activity is also regulated by mechanical signals.
  The mechanism linking force sensing to nuclear translocation of Yorkie/YAP/TAZ remains
  unknown and may or may not involve Warts/LATS1/2 inhibition, but does involve the
  formation of actin fibers.,–
