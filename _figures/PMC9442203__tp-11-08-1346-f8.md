caption: Representative pathway outline for the altered metabolites involved in oxidative
  stress metabolism in in SH-SY5Y cells by DHA. (A) Construction of the altered metabolic
  network associated based on KEGG pathway database. (B) Heat map visualization for
  cell samples from control and DHA groups. Black and red bar chart, normalized content
  in the control group and DHA group, respectively. All P values were calculated using
  Student’s t-test. *, P<0.05, **, P<0.01, ***, P<0.001 vs. control group. DHA, dihydroartemisinin;
