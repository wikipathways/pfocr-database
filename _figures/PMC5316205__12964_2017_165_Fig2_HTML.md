caption: 'Pathways of c-Met signaling. a Overview of HGF/c-Met signaling via the canonical
  and non-canonical pathway. Canonical or “classical” HGF/Met signaling involves ligand-dependent
  and independent receptor activation which leads to the induction of downstream signaling
  cascades (left). Non-canonical HGF/c-Met signaling is independent of receptor activation.
  Generation of c-Met receptor fragments takes place under various cellular conditions
  such as apoptotic and necrotic stimuli as well as in the context of specific physiological
  circumstances. HGF is also able to exert signals independently of c-Met, e.g. upon
  interactions triggered by its heparin-binding domain. b Generation of c-Met fragments
  via shedding and cleavage by γ-secretase: Sheddases or metalloproteinases cleave
  full-length c-Met within its extracellular domain, resulting in different in a soluble
  extracellular N-terminal fragment (Met-NTF) and a membrane-associated C-terminal
  fragment (Met-CTF). Met-CTF can be further processed by the γ-secretase complex
  by presenilin-dependent intramembrane proteolysis (PS-RIP) into an intracellular
  domain (Met-ICD) which is routed to proteasomal degradation. Full-length membranous
  c-Met can also be internalized and cleaved by sheddases giving rise to Met-NTF and
  Met-CTF. These intracellularly generated c-Met fragments undergo lysosomal instead
  of proteasomal degradation. c Origin of c-Met fragments through intracellular cleavage
  by caspases and calpains: In response to apoptotic stimuli, c-Met is cleaved at
  two distinct sites in the intracellular domain by activated caspase-3, resulting
  in membrane-anchored p100 Met, a 40 kDa cytosolic p40 Met fragment and a small peptide
  (M10). Under necrotic conditions, c-Met is cleaved by metalloproteinases and further
  processed by calcium-independent proteases (calpains) instead of γ-secretase. The
  resulting product p40 Metcalpain differs from p40 Metcaspase by a few amino acid
  residues and is not able to promote apoptosis'
