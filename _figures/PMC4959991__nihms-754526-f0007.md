caption: Ascorbic acid (AA) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) transport and recycling
  in human neutrophils in vitro () () () (, ). When normal human neutrophils in vitro
  were activated by pathogens (E coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhlis,
  Klebsiella oxytoca, Acinetobacter baumanii or C. albicans) (), neutrophils accumulated
  ascorbic acid. Intracellular vitamin C concentrations increased from ~ 1.3mM to
  8mM, and vitamin C in the culture media decreased to undetectable concentrations
  from 50µM. These findings did not occur when neutrophils were used from patients
  with Chronic Granulomatous Disease (). Patients with this condition are unable to
  make superoxide, and have dysfunctional neutrophils that cannot kill certain pathogens.
  The observed in vitro phenomena can be accounted for by the proposed model described
  below. Normal human neutrophils maintain internal vitamin C concentrations of about
  ~ 1.3mM by uptake of AA by sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2). Activated
  neutrophils secrete reactive oxygen species because membrane associated NADPH oxidase
  is able to transfer electrons across the cell membrane, using NADPH in the process.
  H2O2 is formed, which is a precursor for production of reactive oxygen species (ROS
  and RNOS). These oxidize extracellular AA to DHA. Neutrophil activation with oxidant
  formation and its consequent results are shown in red. DHA is rapidly transported
  into the neutrophil by glucose transporters, probably GLUT1 and GLUT3, and immediately
  reduced to AA by glutaredoxin, producing a 4 to10-fold increase in neutrophil internal
  AA concentration. When bacteria are engulfed by the neutrophil, a phagolysosome
  is formed. Myeloperoxidase containing vesicles fuse with the phagolysosome, such
  that the oxidant generating reactions occur in a sequestered space. Although superoxide
  cannot cross the plasma membrane, H2O2 can readily diffuse into the cell. Oxidants
  generated by H2O2 can be reduced by internal AA. Glutathione (GSH), used by glutaredoxin
  during DHA reduction, is regenerated from glutathione disulfide (GSSG) by glutathione
  reductase (GRD) and NADPH. NADPH essential for these reactions is derived predominantly
  from the pentose phosphate pathway. Two molecules of NADPH are produced by the oxidative
  phase of pentose phosphate pathway (shown in green) when glucose 6 phosphate is
  converted to ribulose 6 phosphate (shown in green). Ribulose 6 phosphate undergoes
  further metabolism in the non-oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway.
  As NADPH is oxidized to NADP, electrons are transferred to GRD so it can reduce
  GSSG to GSH. Modified and reproduced from (), with permission of the Journal of
  Nutritional Biochemistry.
