caption: AR antagonist induces cellular senescence in PCa through the Src/Akt pathway.
  Binding of AR antagonist to AR leads to conformational change of AR. AR antagonists
  compete with androgens for binding to AR. (1) Moreover, some AR antagonists reduce
  AR nuclear translocation, chromatin association and DNA binding. (2) As a result,
  the majority of AR resides in the cytoplasm and may interact with cytoplasmic factors
  to mediate cellular senescence. Co-treatment of the AR antagonist atraric acid with
  the inhibitors of Src (PP2) or Akt (Akti) reduce cell senescence suggesting that
  Src/Akt pathway is involved in AR antagonist-induced cellular senescence in PCa
  cells.
