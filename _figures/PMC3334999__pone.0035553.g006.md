caption: The PTEN signalling pathway was chosen from the pathways identified in the
  IPA analysis () for closer examination. The signalling pathway was outlined in IPA
  and the genes targeted by miRNA molecules are identified on the pathway alongside
  their targeting miRNA molecules (red unregulated in spermatogonia, green down-regulated
  in spermatogonia). Targets examined for gene and protein expression levels are colour
  coded according to their expression in gonocytes and spermatogonia, up-regulated
  molecules red, unchanged molecules yellow and down-regulated molecules green. In
  the PTEN pathway the expression of PTEN, AKT, ERK and MEK remained unchanged between
  gonocytes and spermatogonia while the expression of the growth receptor BMPR1a was
  significantly reduced in spermatongia when compared to gonocytes. The target protein
  Cyclin D1 is identified by blue highlighting.
