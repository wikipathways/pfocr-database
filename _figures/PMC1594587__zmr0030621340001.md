caption: Mammalian NAD+metabolic pathways. The biosynthesis of NAD+ occurs through
  both de novo and salvage pathways (). In mammalian cells, 90% of free tryptophan
  is metabolized through the kynurenine pathway, leading to the de novo synthesis
  of NAD+. The three different salvage pathways start either from nicotinamide (Nam),
  nicotinic acid (Na), or nicotinamide riboside (NR). In mammals, the origin of nicotinic
  acid is mainly nutritional. Nicotinamide, a product of NAD+ hydrolysis, is first
  converted into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and then into NAD+ by nicotinamide
  phosphoribosyl transferase (NamPRT) and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases
  (Na/NMNAT-1, -2, and -3), respectively. Nicotinamide riboside was recently shown
  to serve as a precursor for NAD+synthesis, connected to the Nam salvage pathway
  through NMN (). Nicotinamide riboside is converted to NMN by the ATP-consuming nicotinamide
  riboside kinases 1 and 2 (NRK-1 and -2) (). Nicotinic acid can be converted through
  the Preiss-Handler salvage pathway into nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaNM) and
  nicotinate adenine dinucleotide by the concerted actions of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyl
  transferase (NaPRT) and Na/NMNAT-1, -2, and -3, respectively. Nicotinate adenine
  dinucleotide is directly transformed into NAD+ by the glutamine-hydrolyzing NAD+
  synthetase (NADS). Na/NMNATs are ATP-consuming enzymes, using either NaMN or NMN
  as a substrate. Whether both NamPRT and NaPRT are also ATP-consuming enzymes in
  vivo is not certain. Thus, when the Preiss-Handler salvage pathway is used, the
  cell invests three or four molecules of ATP from Na to NAD+, depending on whether
  NaPRT is also an ATP-consuming enzyme in vivo. In mammalian cells, under the conditions
  where NAD+ is used as a glycohydrolase substrate, the Nam salvage pathway is required,
  since there is no nicotinamidase to produce nicotinic acid. Depending on whether
  NamPRT uses one ATP molecule to convert Nam into NMN, the Nam salvage pathway consumes
  two or three ATP molecules from Nam to NAD+. The de novo pathway is connected to
  the Preiss-Handler salvage pathway through NaMN. NAD+ can be hydrolyzed by various
  enzymatic activities, such as PARPs, MARTs, SIRTs, and ADP-ribosyl cyclases, which
  release the Nam moiety from NAD+ to produce poly-ADP-ribose, mono-ADP-ribosyl-protein,
  acetyl-ADP-ribose (O-AADPR), or cyclic-ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinate adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), respectively. These products are then further metabolized
  by different hydrolase activities, yielding ADP-ribose (ADPR), which, in turn, can
  be transformed into 5-phosphribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) by the ATP-consuming
  ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase (ARPP)/ribose phosphate pyrophosphokinase (RPPK) pathway.
  PRPP is used by the Nam salvage pathway enzymes NamPRT and NaPRT.
