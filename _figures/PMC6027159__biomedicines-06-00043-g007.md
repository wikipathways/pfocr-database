caption: TNF-R1 signaling pathway. Components and mechanisms ensuring signal transduction
  in this pathway are depicted on the left, with black arrows indicating ubiquitination
  processes and grey arrows phosphorylation. M1-, K11- and K63-linked polyubiquitination
  is indicated with yellow, pink and green hexagons, respectively. Components and
  mechanisms participating in signal shut-off are presented on the right. An induced
  proteolysis of RIPK1, in addition to its deubiquitination, is indicated although
  its relevance in NF-κB signaling is uncertain. K48-linked polyubiquitination is
  indicated with brown hexagons. See text for details.
