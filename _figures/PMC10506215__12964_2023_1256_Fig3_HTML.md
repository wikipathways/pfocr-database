caption: PTM of PGK1, including acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination and O-GlcNAcylation.
  A Under insulin stimulation, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulates the phosphorylation
  of HDAC3 Ser424, enhances the interaction between HDAC3 and PGK1, leads to the deacetylation
  of PGK1 K220, and stimulates the activity/function of PGK1. B Glutamine deprivation
  and hypoxia lead to inhibition of mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of NAA10/ARD1 S228,
  leading to PGK1 K388 acetylation and Beclin1 S30 phosphorylation, which activates
  the autophagosome to form the required complex. C Polarized M2 macrophages secrete
  IL-6 to increase PDPK1-dependent PGK1 phosphorylation at T243 in GBM cells. D The
  phosphorylation of PGK1 at serine 203 (S203) correlates with the promotion of the
  Warburg effect, hypoxia, expression of oncogenic genes, and cancer development.
  E FOXO3A/LINC00926/PGK1 axis regulates breast cancer glycolysis, tumor growth, and
  lung metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. F SNHG26 binds to PGK1 protein, inhibits
  its ubiquitination and activates the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. G NRSN2-AS1, transcribed
  by SOX2, exerts its tumor promoting activity by binding to PGK1. H PGK1 is dynamically
  modified reversely by O-GlcNAc at the threonine 255 (T255) site, enhancing PGK1
  activity while inducing PGK1 translocation to mitochondria. Ac, acetylation; P,
  phosphorylation; Ub, ubiquitination; G, O-GlcNAcylation
