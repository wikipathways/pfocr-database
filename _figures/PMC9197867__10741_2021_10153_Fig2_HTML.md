caption: Mechanisms of action of OPG and TRAIL in endothelial cells. OPG exerts its
  biological effect on the endothelial cells in three ways. Firstly, it binds through
  a specific domain to its ligand RANKL, preventing it from binding to its receptor,
  RANK. Secondly, OPG acts directly on ECs via a heparin-binding domain that has the
  ability to bind to heparan sulphate proteoglycans present on the surface of cells,
  triggering cell-surface signalling. Thirdly, it attaches to its other ligand, TRAIL,
  preventing TRAIL from binding to its receptors, thereby weakening or abolishing
  its effects. The binding of RANK to its ligand RANKL results in the activation of
  a signalling cascade activating NF-kB and AP-1. Acting at the level of the cell
  nucleus, these molecules increase the expression of OPG and ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. OPG
  also activates NF-kB in ECs inducing the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 at the
  level of the cell nucleus, which leads to increased adhesion of leucocytes to the
  endothelial surface in the early stages of endothelial dysfunction. OPG greatly
  enhances the adherence of leucocytes to the surface of ECs through its heparin-binding
  domain. An important connection also exists between OPG and RAS. Activation of the
  AT1 receptors for Ang II causes, inter alia, an increase in the expression of VEGFS.
  VEGF-A and VEGF-B increase inflammation and remodelling in blood vessels by activating
  pro-inflammatory mechanisms and pathological angiogenesis, which are strengthened
  by OPG. Mutual stimulating interactions between OPG and RAS have also been confirmed.
  In ECs Ang II increases OPG expression and OPG increases the expression of the AT1
  receptor for Ang II. TRAIL significantly increases the activity of eNOS and increases
  NO production in ECs. The augmented phosphorylation of eNOS and the increase in
  NO production in ECs under the influence of TRAIL occur through the activation of
  the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway. Additionally, TRAIL induces PGE2 production in ECs,
  mainly by increasing COX-1 activity. This effect of TRAIL is accomplished by increasing
  NO release. NO inhibits the activity of NF-kB and decreases the expression of ICAM-1,
  VCAM-1 and E-selectin in ECs and prevents increased adherence of leucocytes to the
  endothelial surface. Explanation of abbreviations in the main text
