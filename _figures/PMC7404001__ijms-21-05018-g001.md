caption: The monolignol biosynthetic pathway with associated glycosylated products
  and uridine diphosphate glucosyltransferases (UGT) catalyzing in vitro this glycosylation
  in Arabidopsis (indicated in blue), in presence of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose
  (references within the text). UGT72E1 has been localized in the nucleus []. PAL-dependent
  salicylic acid biosynthetic pathway is also represented []. Glycosylated molecules
  are represented in bold. 4CL, 4-coumarate ligase; AIM1, abnormal inflorescence meristem
  1; BA2H, benzoic acid 2-hydroxylase; C3H, 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; C3′H, 4-coumaroyl
  shikimate/quinate 3′-hydroxylase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol
  dehydrogenase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl CoA reductase;
  COMT, caffeate O-methyltransferase; CSE, caffeoyl shikimate esterase; F5H, ferulate
  5-hydroxylase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase;
  PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase.
