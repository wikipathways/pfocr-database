caption: A schematic diagram of the possible mechanism of dopamine receptor signaling-mediated
  lifespan regulation. In C. elegans, DOP-2 signaling extends lifespan while DOP-4
  signaling shortens lifespan. Pharmacological activation of DOP-2 using aripiprazole
  extends lifespan, whereas inhibition of DOP-2 using quetiapine shortens lifespan.
  Aripiprazole extends lifespan through a DR mechanism mediated by the AAK-2-DAF-16
  pathway. The DAG-PKC/PKD pathway served as a link between dopamine receptors and
  the AAK-2-DAF-16 pathway to transmit longevity signals. The role of DOP-4 in lifespan
  regulation requires further investigation
