caption: miRNA biogenesis pathway. In the nucleus, RNA polymerase II transcripts miRNA
  genes to produce primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA), then by the microprocessor
  complex Drosha-DGCR8 cleaved into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). After that, Exportin-5
  transports the pre-miRNA into the cytoplasm, where it is processed into a miRNA
  duplex by Dicer and its interaction protein, TRBP. Once the miRNA duplex has been
  unwinding, it is divided into two single-stranded miRNAs for further processing.
  Mature miRNA is attached to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and mediates
  mRNA degradation or repression of protein translation within the cytoplasm. Mature
  active miRNAs inter to cell proliferation regulation by controlling the angiogenesis
  process in the tumor cells.
