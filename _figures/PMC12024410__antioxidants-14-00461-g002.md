caption: Hyperphosphataemia-induced vascular calcification and NOX-mediated osteogenic
  differentiation. (A) Rats fed on adenine develop kidney dysfunction due to the accumulation
  of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA) crystals, leading to hyperphosphataemia and hyperaemia.
  Elevated phosphate levels promote the transdifferentiation of VSMCs into an osteogenic
  phenotype, ultimately contributing to vascular calcification. (B) Increased Pi levels
  upregulate NOX and its subunit p22, leading to elevated ROS production. This oxidative
  stress activates the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, which promotes the expression
  of osteogenic markers, driving vascular calcification. The arrows indicate stimulation
