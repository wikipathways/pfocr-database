caption: A schematic illustrating the role of Nupr1 in METH-induced apoptosis and
  autophagy in neuronal cells. METH exposure induces Nupr1 expression. Nupr1 mediates
  METH-induced apoptosis and autophagy in neuronal cells via triggering endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress. CHOP as an ER stress marker protein can mediate METH-induced
  apoptosis through activating effector caspases, such as caspase-3, which is one
  of main executor targets to cleave PARP. Cleaved PARP facilitates cellular disassembly
  and serves as a marker of neuronal cell apoptosis. Trib3 is also an ER stress marker
  protein that can inhibit the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR. As a classic inhibitor
  of autophagy, decreased phosphorylated mTOR increases the expression of Beclin-1,
  which activates the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, thereby inducing autophagy in
  neuronal cells.
