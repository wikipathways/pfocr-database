caption: Schematic representation of inhibition of exosome biogenesis and secretion
  by Manumycin A in CRPC cells. The inhibition of Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 pathway by MA leads
  to transcriptional down-regulation of hnRNP H1. A decrease in hnRNP H1 transcripts
  leads to inhibition of exosome biogenesis and secretion by suppressing ALIX and
  Rab27a. (EE) early endosome; LE, late endosome; MVB, multivesicular bodies; ESCRT,
  endosomal sorting complex required for transport.
