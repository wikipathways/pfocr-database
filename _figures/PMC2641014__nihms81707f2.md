caption: A role for PPAR signaling in alternative (M2) macrophage activation. Recentr
  studies suggest that cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 promote alternative macrophage
  activation through a pathway that requires PPARγ and PPARδ transcriptional activity.
  PPARs directly regulate expression of the M2 marker Arg I and promote mitochondrial
  biogenesis and oxidative metabolism to support the M2 phenotype. The balance between
  less inflammatory M2 cells and classically activated M1 macrophages is altered in
  mice lacking PPARs and has been proposed be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin
  resistance.
