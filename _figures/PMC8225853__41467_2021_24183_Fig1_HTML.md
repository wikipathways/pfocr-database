caption: 'A Pyl biosynthesis involves condensation of two lysine molecules by three
  enzymes—the radical SAM enzyme PylB, ATP-dependent PylC, and PylD. B Biosynthetic
  pylBCD operon was cloned into a selection phage (SP), while the constitutively expressed
  pylST and phage shock promoter-controlled gIII were cloned into accessory plasmid
  (AP) vectors. Numbered portions indicate selection circuit elements that were altered
  throughout evolution to control selection stringency, including (1) supplementation
  with BocK, (2) expression level of PylRS, (3) mutant variants of PylRS used, and
  (4) the number of amber codons present in gIII. C Each Alt-PANCE round entailed
  two phage passages: selective passage (left) entails operon activity-dependent expression
  of PIII (pink rods with circular tips); mutagenic passage (right) entails mutagenesis
  plasmid (MP)-dependent mutagenesis of the SP.'
