caption: FOXM1 involved in chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. FOXM1 targeted and up-regulated
  EXO1 expression, which promoted DNA damage repair and led to cisplatin resistance
  in cancer cells.FOXM1 activated the expression of KIAA0101, which acted through
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, enhancing the viability of cancer cells and
  promoting the development of chemotherapy resistance. FOXM1 inhibits the expression
  of hCTR1 and SP1, which prevents the entry of cisplatin into ovarian cancer cells
  and reduces the sensitivity of ovarian cancer to cisplatin. FOXM1 inhibited mitotic
  catastrophe by up-regulating the expression of KIF2C, enabling cancer cells to survive
  and proliferate under chemotherapeutic stress. hCTR1, a transmembrane transporter
  protein that allows cisplatin to cross the membrane barrier into cells. SP1, transcription
  factor that induces the expression of hCTR1. Mitotic catastrophe, a tumor suppressor
  mechanism that detects mitotic errors and subsequently drives cells to an irreversible
  anti-proliferative end, death or senescence
