caption: '(A-A’) Schematic diagram of a D. melanogaster ommatidium. Yellow cells are
  R1-7 photoreceptor cells; orange cells are R8 photoreceptor cells; grey cells are
  other cells in the ommatidium. Blue circles are photoreceptor nuclei (nuc.); red
  lines/circles are rhabdomeres (rhab.). (A) Longitudinal section of an ommatidium.
  Note that R7 and R8 cells share the same optic path. The thick black line indicates
  approximately where the transverse section (A’) is drawn from. The distal section
  of the retina (towards the lens and outer surface of the eye) is to the top; the
  proximal section of the retina (towards the brain) is to the bottom. (A’) Transverse
  section of the proximal section of an ommatidium, showing the R8 cell. The anterior
  of the retina is to the left; the equator of the retina is to the bottom. (B) The
  main photoreceptor subtypes, showing R7 and R8 cell specification in each subtype.
  In the pale subtype, the R7 cell expresses Rh3 (blue), signalling to the R8 cell
  to take on a pR8 cell fate through a bistable loop composed of Warts (Wts), Melted
  (Melt) and Yorkie (Yki) and promoting expression of Rh5 (magenta). In the yellow
  subtype, the R7 cell expresses Spineless (Ss) which promotes Rh4 (orange), while
  the R8 cell expresses Rh6 (green). The subtypes are found in the specified proportions.
  (C-C’) Schematic of the Hippo pathway in epithelial tissue growth. Proteins labelled
  in green regulate R8 cell fate; proteins labelled in grey do not regulate R8 cell
  fate; proteins labelled in white have not been studied in R8 cell fate. The spectrin
  cytoskeleton is shown beneath the plasma membrane, highlighting the three spectrin
  proteins: α-Spec (yellow), β-Spec (cyan) and Kst (magenta). The yellow box (C’)
  highlights the core kinase cassette. Crb, Crumbs; Ex, Expanded; Hpo, Hippo; Jub,
  Ajuba; Mats, Mob as tumour suppressor; Mer, Merlin; Sav, Salvador; Sd, Scalloped;
  Sqh, Spaghetti squash; Wts, Warts; Yki, Yorkie. (D-F) Confocal microscope images
  of adult D. melanogaster retinas stained with anti-Rh5 (magenta) and anti-Rh6 (green)
  antibodies. The indicated RNAi lines were driven by lGMR-Gal4. Retinas expressing
  β-gal RNAi had a wild type ratio of R8 subtypes (D); retinas expressing yki RNAi
  had almost exclusively pR8 cells (E); retinas expressing wts RNAi had almost exclusively
  yR8 cells (F). Scale bars are 50μm.'
