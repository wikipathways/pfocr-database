caption: Transcript levels of five major structural genes in the cannabinoid biosynthetic
  pathway. For each gene, transcript levels at different times after treatment with
  hormones at a range of concentrations are displayed as a heatmap based on normalized
  Ct values. Each value for color scale was derived from 2−∆∆Ct/the largest 2−∆∆Ct
  and multiplying by 2.5 for range 0–2.5. Statistical significance by Duncan’s multiple
  range test (p < 0.05, n = 3) is listed in Supplementary Table S3. GABA, γ-aminobutyric
  acid; ABA, abscisic acid; SA, salicylic acid; OAC, encodes olivetolic acid cyclase;
  PT10, prenyltransferase 10; THCAS, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase; CBDAS,
  cannabidiolic acid synthase; CBCAS, cannabichromenic acid synthase
