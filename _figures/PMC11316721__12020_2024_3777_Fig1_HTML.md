caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of RBP4 in insulin resistance. In skeletal muscle,
  RBP4 inhibited the phosphorylation of IRS1, and the activation of PI3K resulted
  in impaired translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and induced insulin resistance.
  In the liver, RBP4 increases the production or alters the tissue metabolism of retinoic
  acid isomers, the active forms of retinol that interact with RARs and RXRs to regulate
  the expression of the retinoid-regulated gene PEPCK. The increase in PEPCK expression
  in hepatocytes induced baseline glucose production and reduced insulin-induced suppression
  of glucose production. In adipose tissue, RBP4 induces insulin resistance via the
  following mechanism: (left) RBP4 interacts with STRA6, after which activated JAK2/STAT5
  signaling results in impaired insulin signaling; (middle) RBP4 inhibits IRS1, Akt1
  and GLUT4. (right) RBP4 interacts with TLR2, TLR4/MD2 and the downstream pathways
  MyD88 and TRIF, leading to inflammatory infiltration in adipose tissue and inducing
  systemic insulin resistance. AKT protein kinase B, GLUT4 glucose transporter type
  4, IRS1 insulin receptor substrate-1, JAK2 Janus kinase 2, MD2 myeloid differentiation
  protein 2, MyD88 myeloid differentiation primary response 88, PEPCK phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase, PI3K phosphoinositide 3-kinase, RAI retinoic acid isomers, RAR retinoic
