caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway for lovastatin and simvastatin. Heterologous genes
  integrated into the genome of P. pastoris were shown in red. lovB and lovF: two
  PKS genes; lovC: an enoyl-reductase gene; lovG: a thioesterase gene; lovA: a cytochrome
  P450 monooxygenase gene; and lovD: an acyl-transferase gene. NpgA is from A. nidulans.
  lovB, lovC, lovF, lovG, and CPR were amplified from the A. terreus genome. slovA
  and slovD are synthetic and codon-optimized DNA sequences for lovA and lovD, respectively.
