caption: STING signaling pathway. After binding with the cGAMP (which is produced
  after the cGAS enzyme senses the double-stranded DNA), STING protein is activated
  followed by the activation of TBK1, which then phosphorylates transcription factor
  IRF3, which is then translocated into the nucleus of the cell leading to induction
  of interferon genes and ultimately anti-viral and anti-cancer immunity.
