caption: Working model proposed for the synergistic action of GH and insulin on IGF-I
  and -II expression in the carp liver. In carp hepatocytes, IGF-I and -II mRNA expression
  can be up-regulated by GH via the JAK2/STAT5, MEK1/2/ERK1/2, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascades.
  Insulin also has similar effects on IGF-I and -II gene expression but these actions
  are mediated via PI3K/Akt/mTOR but not JAK2/STAT5 and MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathways. At
  the hepatic level, IGF-I and -II responses induced by GH can be markedly enhanced
  with insulin co-treatment. This potentiating effect can be observed with protein:protein
  interaction of GHR and InsR at the membrane level together with notable enhancement
  in InsR phosphorylation. Meanwhile, the levels of STAT5, ERK1/2, and Akt phosphorylation
  can also be potentiated by GH and insulin co-treatment. The aggravation in JAK2/STAT5,
  MEK1/2/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling caused by simultaneous activation of GHR and
  InsR probably can contribute to the synergist effect on IGF-I and -II expression.
  Of note, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activation can also be induced by insulin but the pathway
  is not involved in insulin-induced IGF-I and -II expression. However, the functional
  role of MEK1/2/ERK1/2 activation by insulin in the potentiating effects caused by
  GH and insulin co-treatment should not be excluded. In carp model, P38 MAPK of MAPK
  cascades is not involved in the synergistic action of GH and insulin. P38 MAPK may
  play a role in signal termination for the IGF responses induced by GH or insulin
  respectively, and interestingly, its inhibitory effect can be nullified by co-treatment
  with GH and insulin but the mechanisms involved have yet to be elucidated.
