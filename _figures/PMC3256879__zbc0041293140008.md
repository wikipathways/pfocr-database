caption: A hypothetical diagram of the involvement of ATF6 in BMP2-induced osteoblast
  differentiation. BMP2 increases Runx2 expression and transactivity through bone
  morphogenetic protein receptor signals, and Atf6 expression is increased with the
  enhanced direct binding of Runx2 to the OSE2 motif (ACCACA) of the Atf6 promoter.
  BMP2 elicits the cleavage of ATF6 from the ER membrane via inducing mild ER stress
  and induces translocation of ATF6 to the nucleus. The activated ATF6 increases Oc
  transcription by binding directly to the ATF6-binding element (ACTGCA) of the Oc
  gene. Finally, the BMP2-Runx2-ATF6-OC signaling pathway elicits osteoblast differentiation
  and extracellular matrix mineralization. ATFRE, ATF6 response element.
