caption: The metabolic changes affecting heart failure patients based in heart failure
  test performance includes glutathione anti-oxidative pathway, branched-chain amino
  acid (BCAA) biosynthesis, pentose cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), fatty acid
  (FA) metabolism, sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids metabolism, and tryptophan
  metabolism. Arrow represents predicted elevation or decrease variables in poor test
  performance. Only predictors with coefficients higher than 0.3 were used. Some metabolites
  not detected in the analysis were included in the figure to complement the metabolic
  pathways. Direction of pathways are proposed based in the metabolic modulation found
  in the study. TCA = tricarboxylic acid; PC = phosphatidylcholine; DAG = diacylglycerol;
  PI = phosphatidylinositol; Cer = ceramide; CE = cholesteryl ester; FA = fatty acid;
  LPC = lysophosphatidylcholine R* = reactive oxygen species.
