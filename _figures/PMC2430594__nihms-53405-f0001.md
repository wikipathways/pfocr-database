caption: Cartoon of two of the most promising DNA repair pathways for cancer therapeutics.
  A) The direct reversal pathway is made up of the AGT protein and recognizes O6-alkylguanine
  lesions in DNA. Clinically used inhibitor, O6-Benzylguanine (BG) acts as a pseudo-substrate
  and inactivates AGT resulting in a persistence of DNA lesions and an increase in
  sensitivity to agents that generate O6-lesions. B) The DNA base excision repair
  (BER) pathway is involved in repairing DNA damage caused by alkylating and oxidizing
  DNA damaging agents as well as ionizing radiation (IR). The DNA BER pathway is made
  of up both the short- and long-patch sub-pathways with APE1/Ref-1 playing a crucial
  role in both. Proteins that are currently good or potential targets for cancer therapeutics
  are shown in red letters.
