caption: Schematic representation of Zn and Fe homeostasis cross-talk in plants. The

  bases of the Zn-Fe homeostasis cross-talk, the FIT protein, ZIP family transporters
  (ZIP3 and IRT3), and metal tolerance proteins (FRD3, MTP3, and HMA3) function as
  potential integrators of Zn and Fe nutrient signals in plants. (A) Under excess
  Zn conditions, the IRT1 acts as a transceptor to sense excess Zn2+ and orchestrates
  its own degradation to protect plants from highly reactive Zn2+, while the low-Zn-adaptive
  bZIP19/23 transcription factors are inactivated and inhibit the plant ZIP gene family
  transporters (such as ZIP5 and ZIP9) to regulate Zn homeostasis. In addition, metal
  tolerance proteins MTP3 and HMA3 are activated to facilitate Zn loading into xylem.
  However, the ZIP2 subfamily genes are independent of the bZIP19/23-mediated pathway
  and are under the control of the PHR1-dependent pathway, resulting in the Zn overaccumulation
  in plants. Furthermore, the expression of MTP3 and HMA3 is partially dependent on
  the FIT and contributes to Zn tolerance, while the FIT-independent FRD3 and YSL2
  function in Zn and Fe homeostasis, respectively. (B) On the other hand, the deficient
  Zn-regulated ZIP family (such as ZIP3 and IRT3) and NAS1/4 transporters, contributing
  to Fe uptake and transport, are induced during Zn deficiency, leading to Fe sufficiency
  in plants. Consequently, the FBP (FIT-binding protein) inhibits the FIT activity,
  and the bHLH Ib and FIT transcription factors are repressed in adaptive to Zn deficiency
  and excess Fe, and then expression of NAS1/4, FRO2, and IRT1/2 are downregulated
  at the transcriptional level to modulate Zn and Fe homeostasis in plants. The arrows

  description: Schematic representation of Zn and Fe homeostasis cross-talk in plants.
    The excess zinc (Zn) results in the iron (Fe) deficiency (A), whereas excess Fe
    reduces the Zn concentration in plants at the physiological level (B). For the
    molecular bases of the Zn-Fe homeostasis cross-talk, the FIT protein, ZIP family
    transporters (ZIP3 and IRT3), and metal tolerance proteins (FRD3, MTP3, and HMA3)
    function as potential integrators of Zn and Fe nutrient signals in plants. (A)
    Under excess Zn conditions, the IRT1 acts as a transceptor to sense excess Zn2+
    and orchestrates its own degradation to protect plants from highly reactive Zn2+,
    while the low-Zn-adaptive bZIP19/23 transcription factors are inactivated and
    inhibit the plant ZIP gene family transporters (such as ZIP5 and ZIP9) to regulate
    Zn homeostasis. In addition, metal tolerance proteins MTP3 and HMA3 are activated
    to facilitate Zn loading into xylem. However, the ZIP2 subfamily genes are independent
    of the bZIP19/23-mediated pathway and are under the control of the PHR1-dependent
    pathway, resulting in the Zn overaccumulation in plants. Furthermore, the expression
    of MTP3 and HMA3 is partially dependent on the FIT and contributes to Zn tolerance,
    while the FIT-independent FRD3 and YSL2 function in Zn and Fe homeostasis, respectively.
    (B) On the other hand, the deficient Zn-regulated ZIP family (such as ZIP3 and
    IRT3) and NAS1/4 transporters, contributing to Fe uptake and transport, are induced
    during Zn deficiency, leading to Fe sufficiency in plants. Consequently, the FBP
    (FIT-binding protein) inhibits the FIT activity, and the bHLH Ib and FIT transcription
