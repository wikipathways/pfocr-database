caption: Disease network map generated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis depicting miRNAs
  involved in the inflammation of organs. miRNAs are color-coded (red or green for
  up- and downregulation, respectively) for the expression of miRNAs in Stachybotrys
  chartarum exposed versus control at 13 weeks, 48 h post-exposure. Gray dotted lines
  represent predicted regulated relationship.
