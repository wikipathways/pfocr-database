caption: 'The mechanism of action of existing drugs targeting KIT expression and mutations.
  In this figure we describe several inhibitors targeting KIT expression and function.
  Therapeutic strategies of TKIs targeting KIT mutations in gastrointestinal stromal
  tumors: fist-line therapy-Imatinib; second-line therapy-Sunitinib; third-line therapy-Regorafenib;
  fourth-line therapy-Ripretinib. Other new drugs targeting KIT mutations in gastrointestinal
  stromal tumors: Avapritinib, Larotrectinib, Entrectinib, Bezuclastinib, Carbozantinib,
  Sorafenib. The c-KIT-Hsp90Β-Apaf-1 complex inhibits the ubiquitination degradation
  of mutant KIT. Bortezomib binds to Cbl, destabilizing the c-KIT-Hsp90Β-Apaf-1 complex
  and releasing Apaf-1, and then KIT proteins are internalized and degraded in GIST
  cells. IPI-504, IPI-493, TAS-116, AT13387 and NVP-AUY922 are HSP90 inhibitors. HDAC
  inhibitors, SAHA and LBH589, attenuate the activity of HSP90 by acetylating on HSP90
  gene. For Hh pathway, HHs, SMO and GI1/2 have their own inhibitors. PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
  voxtalisib, the pan-PI3K inhibitor pilaralisib, and the PI3K-restricted inhibitor
  alpelisib all reducing GIST cell proliferation. TAT-N24 and the emerging PI3K or
  P55PIK inhibitors, such as Copanlisib, both inhibit NF -κB. BGJ398, PD173074 and
  nintedanib are FGFR inhibitor targeting FGFR1-4. ACK1 inhibitor AIM-100 or ACK1
  siRNA inhibits ACK1. CS-1 and CS-2 are functioned as FTO inhibitors preventing KIT
  m6A mRNA demethylation. BBIs can reverse the transcription abnormalities of KIT
  gene which are induced by BRD4. Mithramycin A inhibits the TF, SP1, and HZ1 decreases
  the transcriptions of OSR1'
