caption: (A) NF-κB and AP-1 pathways. Bacterial PG-derived peptides γ-D-glutamyl-m-diaminopimelic
  acid (iE-DAP) and MDP are recognized by the cytosolic receptors NOD1 and NOD2. These
  ligands bind to NOD1 or NOD2 through the LRR domain of these molecules. This interaction
  initiates the activation of NOD1 and NOD2 due to the induction of a complex conformational
  change that results in protein oligomerization and further interaction with downstream
  effectors. NOD1 or NOD2 assembly recruits RIP2 through CARD–CARD interactions, resulting
  in RIP2 ubiquitination by IAPs and recruitment of LUBAC complex by XIAP, with further
  binding of the TAB1/TAK1 complex. It is believed that TAK1 gets activated through
  autophosphorylation and stimulates downstream IKK complex, including Lys63-linked
  polyubiquitination of NEMO (IKKγ), the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex, which
  also consists of the catalytic subunits IKK1 (IKKα) and IKK2 (IKKβ). This event
  is followed by IKK2 phosphorylation, which further phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor
  IκBα. IκBα is then ubiquitinated by the SCF/β-TrCP complex and further degraded
  by 26S proteasome. The degradation of IκBα releases NF-κB dimers to translocate
  into the nucleus, where they up-regulate target genes involved in host defence and
  apoptosis. NOD oligomerization and further RIP2 activation also recruits TAB/TAK1
  complexes to mediate the phosphorylation of MAPKs, such as JNK, ERK and p38 MAPK,
  through the upstream activation of MKKs. These kinases translocate to the nucleus
  and then phosphorylate AP-1 transcription factors (c-fos, c-Jun, ATF and JDP family
  members) to mediate expression of target genes containing a TRE (TPA DNA-response
  element). (B) MAVS/IRF pathway. Activation of both NOD1 and NOD2 by bacterial products
  induces receptor oligomerization and RIP2 recruitment, which in turn binds TRAF3
  and induces TBK1/IKKϵ activation through a mechanism that is not completely understood.
  This is followed by IRF transcription factor dimerization and activation, resulting
  in binding to and induction of type I IFN genes. Similarly, virus-derived single-stranded
  RNA binds NOD2 and induces its association with mitochondrial receptor MAVS, resulting
  in the activation of IRF3 transcription factors and induction of type I IFNs. TRAF3
  also directly binds MAVS but its precise role requires further investigation.
