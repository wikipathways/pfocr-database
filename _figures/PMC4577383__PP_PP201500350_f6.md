caption: 'Nod factor perception initiates the biosynthesis of hormone precursors  and  via
  the /1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate biosynthetic pathway. Line graphs depicting
  read counts of differentially expressed  genes are shown. Differentially expressed
  genes leading to the biosynthesis of GA, , and strigolactones are listed in gray,
  and inhibitors are depicted in red. Full depictions of the individual hormone pathways
  are given in Supplemental Figure S5. Error bars represent se calculated from four
  independent biological replicates. Abbreviations used are as follows: Pyr, pyruvate;
