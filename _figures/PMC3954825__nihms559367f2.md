caption: Cell non-autonomous mechanisms that regulate cortical development consist
  of cell signaling events initiated by extracellular factors in the cytoplasm or
  through cell-cell interaction. Three key cell non-autonomous mechanisms involving
  DISC1 are the NRG1/ErbB and canonical Wnt pathways which play a role in progenitor
  proliferation, and the Reelin cascade which is important for neuronal migration
  and positioning. Roles for DISC1 have been reported in each of these pathways, suggesting
  that DISC1 may be an important molecule in studying how these pathways interact
  with one another. In the NRG1/ErbB signaling pathway, binding of NRG1 to its receptors
  ErbB2/3 activates PI3K/Akt signaling which increases expression of DISC1 in primary
  neurons. DISC1 also inhibits the formation of the β-catenin degradation complex
  by binding GSK3β, therefore leading to β-catenin stabilization and up regulation
  of Wnt signaling. DISC1 and APP interact with phosphorylated Dab1, a key downstream
  target of Reelin. Together with LIS1, which also interacts with phosphorylated Dab1,
  DISC1 is likely to play a role in modulating intracellular downstream signaling
  of Reelin.
