caption: Molecular mechanisms of ferroptotic cell death. Metabolic pathways such as
  iron metabolism (left), cysteine and glutathione metabolism (top right), and polyunsaturated
  fatty acid metabolism (bottom right) play an essential role in the ferroptotic pathway.
  Well established ferroptosis inducers and inhibitors and their mode of action are
  depicted in red and green respectively. BSO, Buthionine sulphoximine; DFO, Deferoxamine;
  DFP, Deferiprone; Fe2 +, Ferrous iron; Fe3 +, Ferric iron; FPN1, Ferroportin; GPx4,
