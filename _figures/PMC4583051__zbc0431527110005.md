caption: Schematics of cAMP/PKA regulation of polycystin-2. Hypothetical model of
  PKA regulation of PC2, based on the present findings in hST and the isolated protein,
  our previous results on PC1 dephosphorylation events on Ser-829 of PC2 (), and a
  local cAMP signaling pathway in primary cilia (). The cAMP production by local adenylyl
  cyclases (AC) activates PKA, which phosphorylates Ser-829 in the carboxyl terminus
  of PC2. This event in turn, increases channel open time, but not the conductive
  properties of the pore. Basal PC2 channel function in the hST is tightly coupled
  with phosphorylating/dephosphorylating events since alkaline phosphatase (AP) inhibits
  PC2 channel function and conversely, ortho-vanadate activates it. Possible feedback
  mechanisms include the triggering of Ca2+-dependent cAMP decreasing events elicited
  by its influx through the channel. Further, whenever present, PC1 facilitates the
  dephosphorylation of Ser-829 of PC2, by recruiting PP1α to the site (). The interaction
  between cAMP/PC2 in hST further suggests possible receptors and/or yet to be identified
  AKAPs in this preparation.
