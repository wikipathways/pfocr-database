caption: Outline of major DNA DSB repair pathway and its relationship with host anti-tumor
  immune response. Studies have shown that DNA damage response and repair (DDR/R)
  have a double effect on host immunity, either immune activating or immunosuppressive.
  DNA repair and especially HRR deficiency causes one hand the increased load of mutations
  and hence neo-antigens, which activate adaptive immune system and on the other hand
  the release of cytoplasmic DNA which activates innate immune system. Major DDR kinase
  ATM is also shown to be directly implicated in the upregulation of NKG2D ligand
  which mediates NK cell dependent killing of tumor cells. ATM/ATR/CHK1 axis also
  upregulates PD-L1 expression after DNA damage, via JAK/STAT/IRF1 pathway.
