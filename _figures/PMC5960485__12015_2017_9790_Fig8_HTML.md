caption: Network showing the most important gene interactions for the “regulation
  of canonical WNT signaling” (GO term GO:0060828) pathway. Interactions are retrieved
  from the STRING database []. The fill color of each node reflects the log-fold change
  of a gene in our microarray experiment with yellow to red indicating up-regulation
  and blue to cyan indicating down-regulation. The width of a node reflects the betweenness
  centrality of that node in the entire interactome; the height of a node reflects
  the betweenness only within this pathway. The node label color indicates how high
  the gene was ranked in the differential gene expression analysis, going from black
  to red with increasing significance. Thickness of an edge reflects the evidence
  strength for an interaction as reported by the STRING database
