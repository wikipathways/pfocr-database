caption: Schematic proposal for the mechanism responsible for syringaresinol-induced
  vasorelaxation. Syringaresinol activates both PLC and PI3K, which induce intracellular
  Ca2+ mobilization and Akt, respectively. Increased intracellular Ca2+ level promotes
  eNOS dimerization and CaMKKβ/AMPK responsible for eNOS phosphorylation. In addition,
  the PI3K/Akt pathway promotes eNOS phosphorylation. These biochemical events result
  in an increase in eNOS-dependent NO synthesis and subsequent activation of sGC in
  smooth muscle cells to synthesize cGMP from GTP, leading to vascular relaxation.
