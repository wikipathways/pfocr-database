caption: 'B-cell implications in the pathogenic processes involved in systemic sclerosis.
  (A) Organ infiltration: B-cell infiltrates are present in various organs involved
  in SSc. These infiltrates combine B and T cells, plasma cells, dendritic cells and
  macrophages, underlying their interactions. (B) B-cell subpopulations: B-cells express
  at their surfaces multiple molecules involved in activation or surviving pathway,
  as well as decreased levels of inhibitors coreceptors. B-cells also express co-receptors
  required for interaction with T cell. (C) B-cell intracellular signaling, genomic,
  transcriptomic and proteomic data argue a B-cell signature in SSc. (D) Autoantibodies.
  Several autoantibodies have demonstrated their involvement in cell activation, apoptosis
  induction, proinflammatory and profibrotic processes. (E, F) Cell to cell interactions
  and cytokines synthesis: B-cells interact with various immune cells, fibroblast
  and endothelial cell through direct (solid line) and indirect contact (i.e., cytokines
  and antibodies; dotted line). All participate in profibrotic, proinflammatory processes,
  vascular remodeling and immune dysregulations. Abs, antibodies; AECA, anti-endothelial
  cell Abs; AFA, anti-fibroblast Abs; anti-VSMC Abs, anti-vascular smooth muscle cell
  Abs; BAFF-R, calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand-interactor and BAFF receptor;
