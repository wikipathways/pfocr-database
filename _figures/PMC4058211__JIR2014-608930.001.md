caption: Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor-1-independent and -dependent anti-inflammatory
  activities of montelukast, pranlukast, and zafirlukast. The intracellular signalling
  pathways are depicted with the targets of the cysLTR1 antagonists indicated by means
  of a rectangle. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activation that is represented in pathway
  1 during which membrane phospholipids are converted to arachidonic acid (AA), which
  is subsequently metabolized to either leukotrienes (LTA4, LTB4, and LTC4) or prostaglandins
  (PGH2) by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and COX-1/2 enzymes, respectively. PGH2 is converted
  to PGE2 by PGE2 synthase. Phospholipase (PLC) activation is represented in pathway
  2 with the generation of inositol triphosphate (IP3) which releases cytosolic Ca2+
  from storage vesicles with subsequent downstream activation of PKC, NADPH oxidase,
  5-LO, and NFκB, with release of proinflammatory cytokines. ATP binds to purinergic
  receptors (P2YR) and is also converted to cyclic AMP by adenylate cyclase (AC) which
  is degraded by intracellular phosphodiesterases (PDE). Cyclic AMP downregulates
  the Ca2+-mediated activation of 5-LO and NADPH oxidase. Inhibition of cysLTR1 receptors
  attenuates the receptor-dependent effects of cysteinyl leukotrienes.
