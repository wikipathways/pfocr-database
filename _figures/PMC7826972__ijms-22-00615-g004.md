caption: Role of myosins I, II and VI in S. typhimurium invasion and intravacuolar
  replication in epithelial cells. S. typhimurium enters the intestinal epithelial
  cells by triggering membrane ruffling (in purple strips) and invagination (in red
  strips). Both mechanisms are facilitated by myosins whose activity is induced by
  Salmonella injected effector SopB (light blue). In the “ruffling-dependent entry”,
  the role of myosin VI is indirect as it facilitates the recruitment of PI(3)P under
  the phagocytic cup, which in turn activates signaling pathways leading to recruitment
  of cytoskeletal proteins. Myo1c would also promote “ruffling-dependent entry” by
  recruiting additional membrane from the exocyst complex to elongate membrane ruffles.
  In the invagination process, the SopB/Rho-Rho-kinase/myosin II pathway generates
  force under the bacterial entry site hence pulling the bacterium inside the host.
  Then, Salmonella effectors, SseF, SceG and SifA, and myosin II are required for
  optimal positioning of the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) to the perinuclear
  region for Salmonella replication.
