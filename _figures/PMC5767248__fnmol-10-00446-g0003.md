caption: 'AMPAR trafficking during Alzheimer’s disease (AD): early and later phases.
  (A) AMPAR trafficking during early phase of neurodegeneration: at early stages soluble
  Aβ oligomers may activate a NMDAR-dependent pathway that results in increased tau
  phosphorylation levels and further Aβ synthesis. A plausible candidate to mediate
  these effects is GSK3β which reduces synaptic transmission and enhances LTD. (B)
  AMPAR trafficking during later phases of neurodegeneration: combined effects of
  Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau prevent LTP expression in altered synapses likely
  by preventing the action of key protein kinases such as CaMKII and Fyn kinase. Aβ
  and hyperphosphorylated tau could form synaptotoxic aggregates at the PSD that further
  aggravate synaptic decay.'
