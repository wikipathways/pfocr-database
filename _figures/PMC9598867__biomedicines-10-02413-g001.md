caption: Pathways contributing to the maintenance of the cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype.
  Keeping intracellular ROS levels low is required for a stem cell to maintain quiescence
  and self-renewal properties. This is achieved to a large extent by expression of
  Nrf2-induced target genes. Thereby, antioxidative defense molecules and detoxifying
  enzymes including thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin, glutathione-S-transferases, heme oxygenase
  I are provided to keep the levels of reactive oxygen species derived from, e.g.,
  NADH oxidases (NOX), the respiratory chain, infiltrating/surrounding immune cells,
  or chemotherapeutic drugs low. Nrf2 and pathways initiated by the CSC surface receptors
  and markers to minimize ROS production in response to chemotherapeutics like Sonic
  Hedgehog, Wnt family members, CD13, CD44 or CD133 add to the strong induction of
  drug efflux transporters. In addition, pathways that contribute to the CSC phenotype
  act via preventing apoptosis, promoting angiogenesis and expression of stem cell
  transcription factors such as NANOG homeobox (NANOG HOMEOBOX) and SRY-box transcription
  factor 2 (SOX2). Note that the canonical β-catenin-dependent Wnt pathway, and GSK-3β
  in particular, is a downstream mediator shared by many of the CSC markers and CSC
  pathways.
