caption: 'The cGAS-STING pathway and its cellular and disease functions. The cGAS-STING
  signaling pathway surveils cytoplasmic dsDNA to initiate innate immune responses.
  Free cGAS, a cytoplasmic PRR, lacks a functional active site in resting cells. In
  the presence of mislocalized dsDNA in the cytoplasm, either the pathogens or the
  host, cGAS would bind and induce a conformational change, facilitating the oligomerization
  that simultaneously sandwiches the two dsDNA strands and catalyzing the synthesis
  of the second messenger 2′3′-cGAMP. cGAMP binds to STING on the ER, inducing a 180°
  clockwise rotation of STING LBD and unraveling the right-handed crosslinked helices.
  Subsequently, STING translocates to the ERGIC and the Golgi apparatus, where it
  oligomerizes and recruits the signaling essential kinase TBK1 and the transcription
  factor IRF3 to form the canonical signalosome. Activated TBK1 further phosphorylates
  IRF3 and triggers its dimerization and nuclear translocation to induce the production
  of IFN-I and ISGs. Additionally, STING recruits IKKs to facilitate the transcription
  of proinflammatory cytokine genes through the NF-κB signaling pathway. cGAS-STING
  signaling plays a critical role in cellular functions and diseases through IFN-dependent
  and independent routes. Abbreviations: LBD, ligand-binding domain; ERGIC, ER-Golgi
  intermediate compartment; IFN-I, type I Interferon; IKKs, inhibitor of kappa B kinase;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-B; SASPs, senescence-associated secretory phenotypes.
