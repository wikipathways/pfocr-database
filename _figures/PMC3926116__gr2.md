caption: Glucose use in the brain. Glucose is used for multiple functions in the brain.
  Glycolysis followed by oxidation of acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle provides reduced
  equivalents that can be used by mitochondria to synthesize ATP. Alternatively, oxidation
  through the pentose phosphate pathway provides NADPH, required for the reduction
  of glutathione, a central anti-oxidant in the brain. Glucose is also required as
  a precursor to synthesize neurotransmitters, and can be stored to some extent in
  astrocytes in the form of glycogen. In the absence of glucose, ketone bodies produced
  in the liver can cross the blood–brain barrier and partially replace glucose as
  an energy source.
