caption: Mitophagy in mitochondrial quality control. (1) Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) can target the mitochondrion and induce damage
  to proteins, DNA and lipids. (2) ROS and RNS may also be part of the signaling mechanism
  for autophagy and mitophagy regulation. (3) Furthermore, ROS and RNS may lead to
  modification of the glycolytic pathway, and perturbation of the cellular redox status.
  (4) Mitochondrial damage results in a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential
  or an increase in mitochondrial fission, and both have been shown to signal mitophagy.
  Elongated mitochondria or increase of mitochondrial fusion have been shown to protect
  mitochondria from mitophagy. (5) Mitochondrial PINK1 is unstable due to presenilin-associated
  rhomboid-like (PARL) protease activities. A decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential
  will inhibit PINK1 degradation by PARL. Stabilized PINK1 recruits Parkin to mitochondria,
  where Parkin has been shown to be able to ubiquitinate Mitofusin (Mfn1/2), VDAC,
  and TOM proteins, and lead to enhanced mitophagy. (6) Clearance of damaged mitochondria
  by mitophagy may facilitate mitochondrial biogenesis and enhance cell survival.
  (7) Activation of autophagy and mitophagy by rapamycin and other newly developed
  small chemical compounds have been investigated for their potential to enhance cell
  survival in response to ROS/RNS induced damage. Autophagy and mitophagy can be inhibited
  by (8) 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or Wortmannin that are PI3K inhibitors; by (9) bafilomycin
  and chloroquine that alter vacuolar and lysosomal pH, prevent autophagosomal–lysosomal
  fusion; or by E64 and pepstatin A that inhibit lysosomal protease activities. Inhibition
  of autophagy usually leads to enhanced cell death but in some circumstances autophagy
  can contribute to cytotoxicity. Identification and testing compounds that modulate
  autophagy and mitophagy is needed for treatment of a variety of diseases in which
  oxidative protein modification accumulates in the cell.
