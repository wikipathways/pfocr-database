caption: 'LAT1 ablation affects the initial metabolic adaptation that is necessary
  for the efficient repair after acute pancreatitis. Acinar cells have a pyramidal
  shape and display a typical secretory machinery with a well-developed rough endoplasmic
  reticulum (RER) and Golgi apparatus (Golgi), which are localized to the perinuclear
  region, as well as lysosomes (Lys). In the apical region, digestive enzymes are
  stored in zymogen granules (ZG). A: Amino acid transporters (AAT) are expressed
  on the basolateral membrane of acinar cells and are responsible for the transportation
  of amino acids into the cells to maintain the synthesis of secreted enzymes; this
  is so they can be used as an energy source and to guarantee cell growth and regeneration
  after injury. LAT1 exchanges leucine (Leu) with other neutral amino acids (nAA),
  and the amino acid flow acts as an upstream regulator of the mammalian target of
  rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which regulates protein synthesis and enables cell differentiation/survival.
  Morphology, enzyme expression, and other AAT expressions did not differ between
  healthy LAT1 wild-type (LAT1-wt, white, left-hand panel) and healthy LAT1 knockout
  (LAT1-ko, gray, right-hand panel) mice over the period observed in this study; B:
  During the early phase of AP, the remaining acinar cells entered a metabolic arrest,
  dedifferentiated, and temporarily reduced their secretory phenotype. An increase
  in autophagy (AL, autolysosome), followed by the re-activation of the mTOR pathway
  is decisive for the later steps of regeneration. LAT1 expression is maintained on
  acinar cells of LAT1-wt mice in this early phase, and it plays a role in the reactivation
  of mTOR. In LAT1-ko mice, the massive reduction of secretory enzyme expression was
  accompanied by markers of defective autophagy and a less-efficient activation of
  mTOR; C: Three days after the initial injury, LAT1-ko acinar cells were less differentiated
  and presented more areas of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), expressed less secretory
  enzymes, and showed increased fibrosis. The delayed regeneration observed in acinar
  cells lacking LAT1 suggests that this occurred as a result of the improperly activated
  early metabolic response after injury.'
