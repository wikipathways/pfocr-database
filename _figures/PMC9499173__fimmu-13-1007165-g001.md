caption: Gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and effects
  of RA therapeutic drugs on the gut microbiota. (A) Changes in the composition of
  gut microbiota at different stages of RA. Levels of Prevotella copri and Lactobacillus
  are increased, while those of Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacteria and Eubacterium rectale
  are decreased, at an early stage; Abundance of Lactobacillus salivarius, Collinsella,
  and Akkermansia is increased, while that of Haemophilus spp. is decreased, in the
  active RA phase. (B) RA treatment drugs can improve gut microbiota imbalance and
  relieve disease symptoms, mainly including methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine,
  etanercept, and traditional Chinese medicine. (C) Gut microbiota can lead to damage
  of the epithelium and to the opening of the paracellular pathway and can cross the
  epithelium and get in contact with the immune cells beneath the epithelial layer,
  which leads to inflammation. Furthermore, bacterial antigens promote activation
  of autoreactive immune cells (B cell and T cell) in the lymphoid tissues, resulting
  in an imbalance between regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells,
  leading to expansion of inflammatory response. Activated B cells produce autoantibodies
  (anti-citrullinated protein antibody and rheumatoid factor). (D) Gut microbiota
  imbalance can trigger the migration of autoreactive cells to the joints, causing
  cartilage and bone damage. ① Bacterial antigens trigger promotes inflammation in
  synovial membrane, attracting leukocytes into the tissue. ② Autoreactive cells activate
  macrophages, resulting in inflammatory cytokine production. ③ Cytokines induce fibroblasts
  to produce MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) and RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear
  factor κB ligand), which mediate destruction of bone and cartilage tissue, leading
  to the development of RA.
