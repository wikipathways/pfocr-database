caption: Glycerolipid biosynthesis in A. thaliana leave. An abbreviated biosynthetic
  scheme for the major plant glycerolipids is represented. Breaks in the pathway represent
  the mutation sites described in case studies 1 and 2. The set of reactions occurring
  within the chloroplast are termed the “prokaryotic pathway” and those that involve
  glycerolipid synthesis in the ER and subsequent transfer to the chloroplast constitute
  the “eukaryotic pathway”. Dashed arrows indicate the enhanced biosynthetic pathway
  of oligogalactolipids in the tgd3 mutant. For simplification, another pathway to
  transport ER-derived glycerolipid to chloroplasts, mediated by lipin-like phosphatases,
  is omitted (Nakamura et al. ). This metabolic pathway is illustrated according to
  Somerville et al. (Somerville et al. ) with modifications. ACP acyl carrier protein,
  PA phosphatidic acid, DAG diacylglycerol, PhosCho phosphocholine, PhosGly phosphoglycerol,
  t16:1 hexadec-3-trans-enoic acid, SQ sulfoquinovose, GGGT galactolipid:galactolipid
  galactosyltransferase, βGalβGal Gal(β1 → 6)βGal, βGalαGal Gal(β1 → 6)αGal
