caption: Schematic representation of the metabolic pathway of endothelial or neuronal
  production of nitric oxide (NO), which stimulates guanylyl cyclase (GC) promoting
  cGMP generation and relaxation of trabecular smooth muscle. The sites of action
  of the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor (NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), the cytochrome
  P450 oxygenase (CYP) inhibitor, miconazole, and the GC inhibitor, ODQ, are shown.
