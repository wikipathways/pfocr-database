caption: Candidate gene network regulating chitin synthesis and tying it to life-history
  variation via molting and immune function. (A, B) a set of highly conserved nuclear
  receptors (green) centered on ecdysone (EcRb-USP [RXR] network) and juvenile hormone
  signaling (Met - Kr-h1 – Broad) form a high-level control center for molting and
  maturation. We note that these two cascades are also tied to vetellogenin synthesis
  and the onset of reproduction. (C) This high-level control center is tied to the
  well-defined chitin synthesis pathway (purple), culminating in a synthesis bifurcation
  where cuticular chitin synthesis is likely tied to chitin synthase A and peritrophic
  membrane chitin is tied to chitin synthase B. (D) This is further supported by evidence
  that there are several genes/proteins linked specifically to either carapace or
  to tube-like anatomical features and peritrophic membrane structures (serp, veriform,
  and knk). Thus, these hormones, the nuclear receptors, and the chitin synthesis
  pathway ending in a split to carapace or gut chitin, form a hypothesized physiological
  backbone of any response to physical and temporal changes in chitin-rich structures.
  This putative and growing gene network should underpin the wide variety of predator
  and parasite-induced phenotypic plasticity we see throughout the arthropods. See
  text for details and references.
