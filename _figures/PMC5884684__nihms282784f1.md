caption: Connections between circadian cycles, C/EBPs and the NAD+-Sirt1 pathway may
  affect G-CSF induced granulopoiesis. The circadian oscillator is composed of transcriptional
  feedback loops (Red). Clock and Bmal1 drive expression of core clock genes Per,
  Cry and Rev-Erbα which in turn, inhibit Clock/Bmal1 activity. Throughout the body,
  these clock cycles are embedded into tissue-specific pathways to sustain local rhythmic
  physiologies. The Clock/NAD+-Sirt1 feedback loop (brown) couples circadian oscillations
  to metabolism. Diurnal cytokine patterns link circadian regulation to hematopoietic
  processes (orange). C/EBP transcription factors may form a feedback loop with the
  circadian clock (purple) as they regulate core clock genes and are themselves rhythmically
  expressed in some tissues. In myeloid cells, C/EBPs are part of a feedback loop
  (green) that regulates granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and G-CSF receptor
  (G-CSFR) in a NAD+-Sirt1 dependent manner, leading to induction of granulopoiesis.
