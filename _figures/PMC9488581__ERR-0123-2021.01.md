caption: Schematic illustration of proposed concepts of pathogenesis in antineutrophil
  cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-mediated lung disease including pulmonary capillaritis
  and interstitial lung disease (ILD). The pathogenesis of ANCA-ILD is thought to
  involve an interplay of factors (including environmental exposures such as silica
  or cigarette smoke, drugs including hydralazine, infection, immune dysregulation)
  and genetic predisposition (such as MUC5B, telomerase reverse transcriptase, desmoplakin
  and others). These factors lead to the generation of an aberrant autoimmune response
  including loss of T- and B-cell tolerance and ANCA production. ANCA induces neutrophils
  to secrete chemoattractants which lead to activation of the alternative complement
  pathway, with anaphylatoxin C5A as an important player, leading to amplification
  loops and further priming of neutrophils [, ]. ANCA-activated neutrophils locally
  release reactive oxygen species (ROS), proteolytic enzymes such as elastase or neutrophil
  extracellular trap (NET) formation, which injures vascular endothelial cells leading
  to pulmonary capillaritis. Furthermore, interleukin-17 (IL-17)-bearing NETs have
  been shown to trigger human lung fibroblast activation and differentiation into
  myofibroblasts []. Other proposed mechanisms for the development of ILD in AAV include
  repeated episodes of alveolar haemorrhage leading to pulmonary fibrosis.
