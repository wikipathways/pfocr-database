caption: Hyperploid pathway as a salvage survival strategy after moderate to high
  but not extreme concentration of platinum treatment (i.e. 20–100 uM). After platinum
  treatment, the activation of the G2-M cell cycle checkpoint led to the initial arrest
  of tumor cells at the G2-phase for DNA damage repair. Under the traditional regeneration
  pathway, tumor cells that did not perform sufficient DNA damage repair would undergo
  cell death such as by apoptosis or necrosis whereas others that achieved higher
  level of repair would eventually emerge from the G2 arrest and progress through
  mitosis to produce viable daughter cells. These normal progenies would predominantly
  contribute to the regeneration of the tumor cell line. However, an alternate salvage
  survival pathway was observed in which some of the initially G2-arrested tumor cells
  with residual DNA damage burden could avoid apoptotic cell death and aberrantly
  progress through mitosis at an intermediate to late time point. The perilous entry
  into mitosis while carrying residual DNA damage led mostly to mitotic catastrophe
  cell death. But there were occasional tumor cells that managed to exit mitosis via
  mitotic slippage and thereby avoided mitotic death. Following mitotic slippage,
  subsequent less-defined processes thought to result in the duplication of the genome
  led these cells to a hyperploid state. Although these de novo generated hyperploid
  tumor cells may continue to persist in this state, some may die while a substantial
  fraction would undergo mitosis. The chance for successful mitotic completion depended
  critically on the initial platinum treatment concentration and only those that were
  derived from the lowest treatment concentration could produce viable progenies.
  It remains to be further explored whether and how these unique progenies would contribute
  to the diversity of the regenerating tumor cell line.
