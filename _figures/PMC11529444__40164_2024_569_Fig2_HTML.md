caption: 'O-GlcNAcylation cycling and UDP-GlcNAc synthesis. The dynamic process of
  the O-GlcNAcylation cycle is controlled by OGT and OGA by adding and removing UDP-GlcNAc
  to proteins. Specifically, OGT utilizes UDP-GlcNAc to generate proteins, whereas
  OGA reverses this process by deglycosylation. This regulation of O-GlcNAcylation
  plays a key role in the control of various cellular activities and operations. Proteins
  labeled G have been shown to be O-GlcNAcylation. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
  (HBP) is an auxiliary pathway produced by glycolysis. Glucose is converted to glucosamine-6-phosphate
  (GlcN-6-P) by glutamine fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (GFAT1). Subsequent reactions
  produce the substrate of O-GlcNAc, UDP-GlcNAc. OGT has several isoforms in different
  cellular compartments: nucleoplasmic OGT (ncOGT) and truncated short OGT (sOGT)
  are found predominantly in the nucleus and cytoplasm; mitochondrial OGT (mOGT) and
  ncOGT operate within the mitochondria. The EGF structural domain-specific O-GlcNAc
  transferase (EOGT) is mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mediates
  the transfer of UDP-GlcNAc to extracellular proteins. There are two main isoforms
  of OGA: the nucleocytoplasmic long isoform (lOGA); and the short isoform of OGA
  present in mitochondria (sOGA)'
