caption: 'Growth factors stimulate the MAPK and insulin signaling pathways, leading
  to TSC2 phosphorylation and inactivation. TSC1/2 negatively regulates mTORC1 (containing
  raptor, DEPTOR, mLST8 and PRAS40) through its actions on Rheb, while it positively
  regulates mT0RC2 (containing rictor, protor [protein observed with rictor-1], mSini,
  mLST8 and DEPTOR). The insulin signaling pathway can activate mTORC1 without TSC1/2
  involvement by Akt-catalyzed phosphorylation of PRAS40, an inhibitor of mTORC1,
  thereby relieving the inhibition. Similarly, the MAPK signaling pathway can activate
  mTORC1 without TSC1/2 involvement via RSK-cataiyzed phosphoryiation of raptor, a
  component of the mTORC1 complex, leading to mTORC1 activation. Activation of mTORC1
  leads to protein translation and to a negative feedback loop on the insulin and
  MAPK signaling pathways. In the presence of amino acids, the Rag GTPase heterodimers
  promote the localization of mTORC1 to cellular compartments containing Rheb, thereby
  facilitating mTORC1 activation. In conditions of low cellular energy or hypoxia,
  AMPK phosphorylates and activates TSC2, while hypoxia increases the transcription
  of REDD1, which also activates TSC2, leading to inhibition of translation. Activation
  of the mTORC1 pathway leads to increases in HIF1α levels, probably by increasing
  translation of HIF1α. HIF1a activates genes related to hypoxia, such as VEGF. TSC2
  binds p27KIP1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, stabilizing it and resulting
  in inhibition of cell cycle progression. mT0RC2 may have a role in actin dynamics,
  through activation of PKCα and Rac and Rho GTPases. Sirolimus (rapamycin) inhibits
  mTORCI, while CI-1040 is a MAPK/ERK inhibitor. Roscovitine is an inhibitor of CDK2,
  whereas sorafenib is an inhibitor of VEGFR. Simvastatin is an inhibitor of Rho GTPases.
  IFN-β works with TSC2 to inhibit cell proliferation, probably through cell cycle
  arrest and apoptosis induction. 4E-BP1: Factor 4E-binding protein 1; Akt: Protein
