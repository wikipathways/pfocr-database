  to its receptor, activating the PI3K pathway, leading to CREB activation followed
  by the splicing of XBP1u mRNA to XBP1s mRNA in the ER. The XBP1s mRNA generated
  is translated to active XBP1s protein, a transcription factor for ADAM10. The nuclear
  translocation of active XBP1s can be promoted by the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α,,
  ,  but Tat-haFGF14–154 does not alter the level of p85α. LY294002 inhibits the phosphorylation
  of PI3K and the splicing of XBP1, inhibiting the expression of ADAM10.
