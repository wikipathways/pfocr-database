caption: Tumour necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor
  signalling. Schematic diagram showing the major intracellular signalling pathways
  activated following TRAIL ligation of its membrane bound receptors. For TRAIL receptors
  1 and 2 (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2) the dominant pathway is initiation of apoptosis.
  However, the ability to activate nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and c-Jun may modulate
  the outcome by inducing expression of both antiapoptotic and proapoptotic signals.
  Current evidence suggests that TRAIL-R4 may be able to activate NFκB, providing
  a mechanism by which it could antagonise the proapoptotic effects of TRAIL-R2 activation
  (adapted from Kimberley and Screaton and MacFarlane).
