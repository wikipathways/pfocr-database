caption: Proposed mechanism of TF activation by ATG. TF is maintained in a predominantly
  noncoagulant (cryptic) state by possible mechanisms of tonic inhibition by cholesterol-rich
  lipid rafts, homo- or hetero-dimerization, association with PDI, and/or sequestration
  of PS to the inner membrane leaflet (left). We propose that ATG binds to surface-located
  PDI in close proximity of the cryptic pools of TF and activates complement through
  the classical pathway. Formation of the initial membrane insertion complex C5b-7
  is critical for TF activation and PS exposure (right), but full MAC assembly leading
  to lytic PS externalization is not required. PDI-dependent thiol-disulfide exchange
  reactions occur following C5 conversion through engagement of complement regulatory
  proteins, resulting in depletion of membrane reductive equivalents (ie, thioredoxin-1)
  with consecutive PDI and TF oxidation. Rearrangements of the cell membrane by C5b-7
  insertion may lead to PS exposure in raft domains and thus facilitate dissociation
  of TF from regulatory proteins and/or TF oxidation.
