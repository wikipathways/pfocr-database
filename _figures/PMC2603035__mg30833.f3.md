caption: Model of diseases associated with ENG, ACVRL1, and MADH4 mutations. The type
  II (RII) and type I (RI) receptors are related serine/threonine kinases which form
  high affinity complexes upon ligand binding. In endothelial cells, TGFβ1 and TGFβ3
  isoforms bind the RII receptor (TβRII), and an RI receptor is then recruited (ALK‐5
  or ALK‐1, which phosphorylate Smad2/3 or Smad1/5, respectively). Endoglin interacts
  with either of these receptor complexes. In the case of BMP‐2, BMP‐4, or BMP‐6,
  the RI receptors (ALK‐3 and ALK‐6) first bind the ligand, engage BMPRII receptor
  and transit the signal through Smad1/5. Smad4 represents a common Smad through which
  signals from different receptors converge and translocate to the nucleus to regulate
  transcriptional responses. Mutations targeting different components (red) of the
  TGFβ signalling pathway contribute to several human disorders (in parentheses).
  Mutations in the endoglin gene are known to cause HHT1 and probably pulmonary arterial
  hypertension. ALK‐1 mutations are associated with HHT2 and PPH, the later being
  also caused by BMPRII mutations. Mutations in ALK‐3 also cause juvenile polyposis,
  while mutations in MADH4 coding for Smad4 lead to a combined syndrome of juvenile
  polyposis and HHT. BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; HHT, hereditary haemorrhagic
