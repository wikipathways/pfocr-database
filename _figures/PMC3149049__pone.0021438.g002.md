caption: The AccABCD proteins carboxylate acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA, followed
  by condensation of malonyl-CoA with acetyl-CoA to form acetoacetyl-CoA by FabH.
  Other proteins including FabG, FabZ, FabI and FabF elongate the acetoacetyl-CoA
  by two carbons every pass through the cycle. Transcription of each FAS gene is only
  slightly upregulated immediately following n-butanol addition but increases significantly
  after 75 and 135 minutes.
