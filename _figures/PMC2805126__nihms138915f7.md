caption: MATI/III and GNMT control DNA synthesis and hepatocyte growth. Hepatic SAMe
  content is maintained constant by the combined action of MATI/III and GNMT. SAMe
  induces DNA and histone methylation as well as the inactivation of the LKB1/AMPK/eNOS
  pathway. Under normal conditions, liver SAMe content is low enough not to induce
  spontaneous DNA and histone hyper-methylation resulting in epigenetic modulation
  of critical carcinogenesis pathways, such as the Ras and JAK/STAT pathways, but
  is sufficiently elevated to avoid the spontaneous activation of the LKB1/AMPK/eNOS
  cascade resulting in uncontrolled DNA synthesis and hepatocyte growth. During liver
  regeneration following PH, SAMe content transiently decreases releasing its inhibitory
  effect on the LKB1/AMPK/eNOS cascade, which contributes to normal DNA synthesis
  and hepatocyte proliferation. In MATI/III deficient mice, SAMe content is chronically
  reduced resulting in the activation of the LKB1/AMPK/eNOS cascade, increased DNA
  synthesis and hepatocyte growth, and impaired liver regeneration after PH. In SAMe-treated
  mice, the fall in hepatic SAMe content and the activation of the LKB1/AMPK/eNOS
  cascade following PH are prevented but without inducing DNA and histone hyper-methylation,
  resulting in the inhibition of DNA synthesis and impaired hepatocyte growth. In
  GNMT deficient mice, SAMe content is chronically about 50-fold higher that in WT
  animals resulting in inhibition of the LKB1/AMPK/eNOS cascade. We have previously
  demonstrated (), that in GNMT-KO mice liver DNA and histones are hyper-methylated
  leading to the activation of the Ras and JAK/STAT pathways. After PH, activation
  of the Ras and JAK/STAT cascades facilitates DNA synthesis and hepatocyte growth
  although the inhibition of multiple pathways playing a critical role in liver regeneration,
  such as the activation of the LKB1/AMPK/eNOS cascade, the cytoplasmic translocation
  of HuR, iNOS activation, and STAT3 phosphorylation, impair this process. SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine.

  description: MATI/III and GNMT control DNA synthesis and hepatocyte growth. Hepatic
    SAMe content is maintained constant by the combined action of MATI/III and GNMT.
    SAMe induces DNA and histone methylation as well as the inactivation of the LKB1/AMPK/eNOS
    pathway. Under normal conditions, liver SAMe content is low enough not to induce
    spontaneous DNA and histone hyper-methylation resulting in epigenetic modulation
    of critical carcinogenesis pathways, such as the Ras and JAK/STAT pathways, but
    is sufficiently elevated to avoid the spontaneous activation of the LKB1/AMPK/eNOS
    cascade resulting in uncontrolled DNA synthesis and hepatocyte growth. During
    liver regeneration following PH, SAMe content transiently decreases releasing
    its inhibitory effect on the LKB1/AMPK/eNOS cascade, which contributes to normal
    DNA synthesis and hepatocyte proliferation. In MATI/III deficient mice, SAMe content
    is chronically reduced resulting in the activation of the LKB1/AMPK/eNOS cascade,
    increased DNA synthesis and hepatocyte growth, and impaired liver regeneration
    after PH. In SAMe-treated mice, the fall in hepatic SAMe content and the activation
    of the LKB1/AMPK/eNOS cascade following PH are prevented but without inducing
