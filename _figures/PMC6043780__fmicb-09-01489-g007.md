caption: Graphical representation shows CHPV interacts with angiotensin II that leads
  to phosphorylation of PLC-γ. This PLC-γ induces calcium stored in organelles to
  come out in cytoplasm that leads to ROS generation. ROS induces mitochondrial dysfunction
  which further elevate ROS. This leads to activation of p38 protein which helps in
  FasL production through some unknown mechanism. FasL then induces apoptosis through
  extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
