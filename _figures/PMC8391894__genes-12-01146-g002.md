caption: Model of Polθ dependency in HR-deficient cells. (A) DSBs are predominantly
  repaired in S/G2 cell cycle phases by accurate HR, which is promoted by BRCA1/2,
  RAD51, and associated proteins. Polθ-dependent MMEJ serves as a backup DSB repair
  pathway that acts on 3′ ssDNA overhangs and causes large indels. (B) HR-deficient
  cells rely on Polθ-dependent MMEJ for DSB repair and cell survival. (C) Inactivation
  or suppression of Polθ causes synthetic lethality in HR-deficient cells as a result
  of insufficient DNA repair.
