caption: Cocaine, A2AR and STEP interactions activating STEP in the dorsal striatum
  can be increased through enhanced allosteric receptor–receptor interactions in A2AR-FGFR1
  heteroreceptor complexes in the dorsal striatal-pallidal GABA neurons with the A2AR
  protomer activation increasing FGFR1 signaling. In particular, the enhanced activity
  of the RAS/MAPK pathway (ERK1/2) of FGFR1 can activate transcription factors linked
  to the formation of STEP, PP1 and/or their interacting proteins. As a result of
  these transcription factors, enhanced activation of STEP can develop which can be
  one mechanism for the ability of the A2AR protomer to enhance STEP activity in the
  dorsal striatal-pallidal GABA pathway. Thus, an increased excitatory synaptic down-regulation
  can develop in these GABA neurons
