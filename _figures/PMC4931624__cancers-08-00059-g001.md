caption: Schematic representation of the Wnt signaling pathway and possible points
  for therapeutic interventions to restrict S100A4-mediated tumor progression and
  metastasis. Possible therapeutic intervention points downstream of active Wnt signaling
  complexes act via reducing β-catenin levels, lowering its nuclear accumulation,
  and/or inhibiting the formation of active target gene (here S100A4) transcription
  complexes by small molecules. The expression of specific target genes, such as S100A4,
  can be reduced by targeting its mRNA level by RNAi. Inhibition of intracellular
  S100A4 protein function is possible via small molecules. Inhibition of extracellular
  S100A4 can be achieved with S100A4-specific antibodies, interactions with its receptor
  (here RAGE) by using receptor-specific antibodies.
