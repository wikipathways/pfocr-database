caption: Under conditions of normoxia in wild-type neurons, mitochondria undergo a
  balance of fission and fusion. Exposure to anoxia shifts the balance towards smaller
  and fewer mitochondria by promoting the canonical fission process. Reoxygenation
  shifts the balance back towards elongated mitochondria by promoting the canonical
  fusion process. Depending on the dual activities of the hypoxia response pathway
  (EGL-9 and HIF-1) and the oxidative stress pathway (SKN-1 and STL-1), reoxygenation
  can trigger hyperfusion, rapidly resulting in enlarged mitochondria. Mitochondrial
  dynamics in turn affect the suspended animation behavior of the animal. Hyperfused
  mitochondria, perhaps through a more efficient generation of ATP, allow neurons
  to rapidly resume function and rapidly re-emerge from suspended animation. Green
  ellipses indicate mitochondria distributed along neurites. Arrows indicate stimulatory
  interactions, whereas T-bars indicate inhibitory interactions.
