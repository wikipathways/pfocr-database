caption: 'A simplified scheme of signaling pathways and cellular events involved in
  embryonic skeletal muscle formation. Paraxial mesoderm which forms somites is distributed
  bilaterally along the neural tube (NT) and notochord (NC) at the antero-posterior
  axis. The ventral region of the somite forms the sclerotome (S) (which becomes most
  of the axial skeleton: vertebrae, ribs), the dorsal part of the somite is called
  the dermomyotome (DM). Cellular migration from the dermomyotome gives rise to the
  epaxial myotome (EDM; the muscle of the back) [] and the hypaxial myotome (HDM;
  body-wall muscles, limb muscles, the diaphragm and the tongue) []. The hypaxial
  dermomyotome is specified by signals from the dorsal ectoderm (DE) (Wnt pathway:
  Wnt7a) and the lateral plate mesoderm (Bmp4) []; Wnt7a activates, while Bmp4 inhibits
  the expression of MyoD. The neural tube (NT) and notochord (NC) provide signals
  necessary for epaxial myogenic determination: Wnt1/3a, produced by dorsal NT [],
  acts together with Sonic hedgehog (Shh) produced by NC []. The epaxial myotome can
  be identified by Myf5 expression, while the cells of the hypaxial myotome predominantly
  express MyoD. Muscle progenitor cells delaminate from the dermomyotome (DM) and
  migrate laterally to form the myotome [] as well as migrate into the limb bud [],
  where they continue to proliferate and differentiate later. In limb muscle formation,
  Shh is also necessary []. A anterior, P posterior, D dorsal, V ventral, M myotome
  Bmp4 inhibition of the MyoD expression is accompanied by Notch signaling [] which
  is responsible for the prevention of early myogenic differentiation of limb buds
  progenitor cells []'
