caption: sdRNAs arise from full-length snoRNAs. (A) C/D box snoRNA structure and accessory
  proteins. (Left) The C/D box snoRNA consists of a 5′ C box (RUGAUGA) motif, a 3′
  D box (CUGA) motif, and the C’ and D’ boxes located internally. Antisense domains
  identify target rRNAs (red) via complementarity. (Right) The C/D box snoRNP complex
  consists of NOP56, NOP58, 15.5 K, and fibrillarin proteins [,,]. (B) H/ACA box snoRNA
  structure and accessory proteins. (Left) The H/ACA box snoRNA consists of a 3′ ACA
  box (ACANNN, N = any nt) and two hairpins that target rRNA (red) linked by an H
  box (ANANNA, N = any nt). (Right) The H/ACA box snoRNP complex consists of NHP2,
  NOP10, GAR1, and dyskerin proteins [,,]. (C) sdRNA biogenesis and function. Biogenesis
  of Argonaute 2 (AGO2)-associating sno-derived RNAs (sdRNAs) Full length small-nucleolar
  RNAs (snoRNAs) are generated either as products of transcription or splicing [,,,].
  snoRNAs produced by transcription can give rise to microRNA-like sdRNAs which are
  specifically excised from parent snoRNA transcripts by employment of the classical
  microRNA (miRNA) processing pathway. This occurs by processing of parent snoRNAs
  into smaller transcripts by the microprocessor complex which consists of Drosha
  Ribonuclease III (DROSHA) and DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8). The intermediate
  snoRNA then undergoes cytoplasmic exportation via exportin 5 (XPO5). Following this,
  the smaller cytoplasmic snoRNA is processed by Dicer RNase III endonuclease (DICER)
  to generate the mature sdRNA which associates with AGO2, leading to the formation
  of the RNA-induced Silencing Complex (RISC). Similar to miRNAs, these sdRNAs function
  in post-transcriptional gene suppression by antisense binding to target mRNA transcripts
  within RISC []. That said, snoRNAs produced by splicing can also enter the classical
  miRNA processing pathway. Spliced snoRNAs, however, can bypass processing from DROSHA/DGCR8
  and/or DICER as a result of trafficking to the nucleolus and subsequent processing
  by the fibrillarin complex followed by cytoplasmic export via a transporter belonging
  to the Exportin (XPO) family of proteins []. Biogenesis of PIWI-associated RNA (piRNA)
  like sdRNAs Spliced snoRNAs which arrive at the nucleolus for fibrillarin processing
  can be trafficked into Yb bodies via Nuclear RNA Export Factor (NXF1)/ Nuclear Transport
  Factor 2 Like Export Factor 1 (NXT1) where the 3′ end is cleaved by Zucchini (ZUC)
  and subsequently degraded. The remaining transcript is processed further within
  the Yb body by the papi-dependent trimmer. Following this, HEN1 double-stranded
  RNA binding protein binds at the 3′ end of the transcript where it adds a methyl
  group, generating a mature piRNA/PIWI complex which is exported to the cytoplasm.
  This piRNA/PIWI complex can then be shuttled back into the nucleus where it functions
  to inhibit transcription [,].
