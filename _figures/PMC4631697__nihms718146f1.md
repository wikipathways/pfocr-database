caption: 'A) Proposed response of CTCL cells with downregulated/absent expression
  of death receptors/ligands to conventional ALA-PDT. The generation of ROS by PDT
  triggers apoptosis via caspase 9 cleavage and activates pathways which are known
  to upregulate some death receptor ligands. B) Proposed response of CTCL cells to
  ePDT. The binding of fully functional death receptors with their ligands triggers
  an additional apoptotic pathway, the extrinsic caspase 8-mediated pathway, which
  leads to enhanced apoptosis. See discussion for further details.*DR: death receptor,
  e.g. FAS, DR4; **DRL: death receptor ligand, e.g. FASL, TRAIL; MTX: methotrexate;
  ROS: reactive oxygen species; t-BID: truncated BH3 interacting-domain death agonist;
  JNK: Jun N-terminal kinase.'
