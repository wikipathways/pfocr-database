caption: Biosynthetic pathways of phospholipid diversity. Phospholipids are first
  produced in the Kennedy pathway by acylation of G3P by GPAT to produce LPA, and
  subsequent acylation by LPLAT (LPAAT reaction in this case) to produce PA. This
  PA may be further metabolized to DAG and used to produce PC, PE, and PS, as well
  as TAG. Alternatively, the PA may be used to produce CDP-DAG and further metabolized
  to PI, PG, and CL. The phospholipids produced in the Kennedy pathway are remodeled
  by the concerted action of PLA1/2 and LPLAT in the Lands cycle. Lands cycle remodeling
  of a sn-2-acyl chain is illustrated; however, remodeling of sn-1 may also occur.
  The representative fatty acids shown are palmitic acid (blue), oleic acid (orange),
  and arachidonic acid (red). X represents any phospholipid polar head group. CDP-DAG,
  cytidine diphosphate-DAG; CL, cardiolipin; DAG, diacylglycerol; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate;
