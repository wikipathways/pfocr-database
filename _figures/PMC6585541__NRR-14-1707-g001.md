caption: 'Overview of HIV-1 cell death mechanisms involved in both astrocytes and
  CD4+ T lymphocytes.Two cellular scenarios are distinguishable according to HIV replication
  outcome: productive HIV replication (green cell) and abortive HIV replication (red
  cell). HIV attachment is the first step on its replication cycle mediated by contact
  between viral envelope glycoproteins with cellular receptor (CD4+)/coreceptors (CCR5/CXCR4).
  Next, viral envelope and cell membrane fuse (1), allowing the release of genomic
  RNA into the cell cytoplasm (2). Using reverse transcriptase, viral RNA is converted
  into DNA (3) which is the integrated into cellular genomic DNA in the nucleus (4).
  Once integrated into the cell DNA, HIV begins with transcription of its genes, de
  novo synthesis of genomes (RNA) and viral protein expression (5). These synthetized
  components are assembled into immature (non-infectious) viral particles, with expression
  of viral envelope glycoproteins on the cell membrane (6). These immature HIV particles
  are released by budding from the cell membrane. Finally, HIV maturation mediated
  by viral protease activity on long viral proteins occurs at extracellular sites
  (7). During viral replication, intracellular concentration of Ca2+ and inositol
  phosphate (IP3) increases and Ca2+ then diffuses through gap junctions to adjacent
  cells (8). Cell-to-cell fusion (by viral glycoproteins-coreceptor contact) facilitates
  the invasion of neighboring cells by immature particles and/or viral components
  (9). A cascade of events including mitochondria-derived oxidative stress, inflammasome
  activation (NLRP3-Caspase-1-GSDMD pathway) and bystander cell death by pyroptosis
  (10) and IL-1β release (11) may occur during abortive-infection. HIV: Human immunodeficiency
  virus; IL-1β: interleukin 1 beta.'
