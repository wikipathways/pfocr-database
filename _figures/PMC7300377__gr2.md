caption: INO80 complex is a component of the TOR signaling pathway that regulates
  metabolic gene expression. The model illustrates the INO80 complex at promoters
  targeted by Msn2/4, Tod6, and Dot6 that are phosphorylated in the TORC1 signaling
  pathway and regulate ribosome biogenesis, nitrogen metabolism, and stress responses.
  The INO80 complex is a model of the electron microscopy-derived structure bound
  to a nucleosome (PDB and 6FML) []. DNA is shown in green and the INO80-bound nucleosome
  in red. The INO80 complex regulates promoter accessibility and histone acetylation
  at target genes. TORC1 signaling regulates Msn2/4 subcellular localization and Tod6/Dot6
  chromatin recruitment.
