caption: 'Autophagy in liver fibrosis: different cell populations tell different stories.
  The liver lobule consists of epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and cholangiocytes,
  and of non-parenchymal cells, such as macrophages (also termed Kupffer cells), liver
  sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In chronic
  liver diseases, extension of the fibrotic scars correlates with the presence of
  ductular reaction (DR). DR refers to extension of reactive ductular cells (RDCs),
  located in the Canals of Hering, the boundary line between hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.
  The cellular origin of RDCs is complicated, with different lines of evidence suggesting
  that in addition to being the progeny of hepatic progenitor cells, RDCs might also
  be derived from the proliferation of cholangiocytes or from ductular metaplasia
  of periportal hepatocytes. Autophagy, a complex regulatory pathway in liver fibrosis,
  exerts its profibrogenic effects in HSCs and RDCs. On the contrary, autophagy maintains
  cellular homeostasis in hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, macrophages, and LSECs, thereby
  counteracting fibrogenesis in the liver.'
