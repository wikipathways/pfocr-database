caption: Schematic comparison of human and rabbit CECs cell proliferation pathway
  stimulated by FGF-2. ERK1/2 pathway activated by PI 3-kinase increase cell proliferation
  through phosphorylation of p27 at both Ser10 and Thr187 residues in response to
  FGF-2 stimulation in hCECs. In contrast, parallel ERK1/2 and PI 3-kinase pathways
  induced by FGF-2 increase cell proliferation in rCECs.
