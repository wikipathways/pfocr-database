caption: Figure 1. A model of the shuttling of H-Ras or N-Ras between the plasma membrane
  and endosomes. Activated Ras proteins stimulate the RIN1 effector, which then activates
  and recruits Rabex-5 to ubiquitylate Ras to facilitate retention in endosomes. One
  consequence of endosomal internalization is suppression of the signaling output
  from the Ras pathway (I).– A fraction of the GTP-bound and ubiquitylated Ras can
  also stimulate ESCRT-III components CHMP6 and VPS4A to enable sorting and recycling
  of components from the Ras pathway, such as EGFR (and possibly Ras itself) back
  to the plasma membrane. This pathway apparently enhances Ras signaling (II). Ubiquitylation
  of Ras in Pathway I forms a negative feedback loop to more efficiently attenuate
  Ras signaling, while Pathway II acts in a positive feedback loop for sustained and
  prolonged Ras signaling. Proper balancing of these two pathways can serve to fine
  tune Ras signaling outputs. Question marks denote many important questions that
  hopefully will be addressed in the future (see text).
