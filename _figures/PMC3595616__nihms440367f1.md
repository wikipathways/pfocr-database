caption: The branched isoprenoid pathway. The major metabolic flux is through the
  cholesterol pathway, with rate-limiting step at the level of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR).
  AY9944 blocks this pathway at the level of sterol-Δ7-reductase (7-dehydrocholesterol
  reductase, DHCR7), resulting in accumulation of 7DHC and reduced steady-state levels
  of cholesterol. Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) is the major branch-point intermediate
  in this pathway, and is an obligate biogenic precursor (through the enzymatic action
  of cis-prenyltransferase) of dolichol. The mevalonate shunt can divert carbon flux
  away from this pathway at the level of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) via its isomer,
  dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), resulting in formation of 3-methylglutaconic
  acid (MGA), which is a metabolite of leucine degradation
