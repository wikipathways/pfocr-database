caption: Alternative fates of a GAA•TTC tract-associated DSB results in deletions
  (left side of the figure) or point mutations (right side of the figure) of the URA3
  reporter gene. We suggest that the initiating event in mutagenesis is a DSB in G1-
  or G0-phase cells. The broken ends are processed 5’ to 3’ with the processing complex
  indicated by a black circle. In this figure, processing extends into the URA3 reporter
  gene. One possible fate of the broken ends is to be replicated (left side of figure)
  resulting in two broken chromatids. If the broken ends are rejoined by NHEJ and
  segregated into daughter cells, one daughter would have an ura3 gene whereas the
  other daughter would have a deletion of sequences that are centromere-distal to
  the tract. Only the strain with the ura3 deletion would be 5-FOAR. In the alternative
  pathway, the broken ends, following processing, reanneal within the GAA•TTC tract.
  We suggest that the resulting single-stranded gap is filled in by the error-prone
  DNA polymerase zeta. This error-prone synthesis could result in a mutation inserted
  within URA3 in one strand of the duplex (shown by the arrow and horizontal line).
  Replicative synthesis would result in one daughter cell with an ura3 point mutation
  and daughter with the wild-type URA3 gene.
