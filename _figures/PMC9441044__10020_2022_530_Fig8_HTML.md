caption: Inflammatory M1 macrophage negatively affects osteocyte maturation and mineralization
  via inhibiting Notch signaling pathway. Osteocyte maturation requires activation
  of the Notch signaling pathway. Only mature osteocytes produce DMP1 which is critical
  in bone mineralization. DMP1 is the transporter of calcium phosphate, only with
  which minerals and collagen fibers combine regularly to form well crystallized bone
  structure. Inflammatory M1 macrophages inhibit Notch signaling pathway in osteocytes,
  preventing osteocytes reaching maturity. Immature osteocytes cannot produce DMP1.
  Lack of DMP1 calcium phosphate cannot be transported into collagen gap zones, therefore
  minerals cannot integrate into collagen fibers in an organized manner and calcium
  deposition is formed. Disorganized bone mineralization finally forms abnormal bone
  structure(Schematic figure created with BioRender.com)
