caption: Colorectal cancer progression is a multistep process during which several
  phenotypic changes occur, leading to enhanced proliferative abilities, the activation
  of survival signaling, the loss of differentiation status, resistance to death,
  and the acquisition of invasive and migratory abilities. Mutated APC is unable (red
  signal) to inhibit the accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin; consequently, it translocates
  to the nucleus where it promotes the activation of transcription factors from the
  TCF/LEF family, leading to proliferation via enhancing cyclin D1 levels. Alternatively,
  the same pathway can become constitutively active when β-catenin is mutated (green
  signal). The expression of a constitutively active KRAS mutant triggers (green signal)
  downstream pro-proliferative signaling (BRAF/MEK/ERK) and pro-survival signaling
  (PI3K/AKT1/MTOR). This signaling can also be triggered by mutations in BRAF and
  PI3K (green signals). Mutations in SMAD4 or TGF-β (red signals) disrupt the TGF-β-induced
  formation of the SMAD2/3/4 complex, which contributes to the loss of differentiation.
  The mutated p53 protein is unable (red signal) to enhance the levels of the pro-apoptotic
  BAX protein, preventing cytochrome-c release from the mitochondria. This mutated
  form is also unable (red signal) to inhibit the anti-apoptotic BCL2 protein, leading
  to a death resistance phenotype.
