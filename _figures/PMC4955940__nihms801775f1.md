caption: T-cell activation is regulated by antigen presentation, as well as stimulatory
  and inhibitory co-receptors. (A) Overview of the MHC I and II antigen presentation
  and processing pathways. Canonical pathways of MHC I antigen presentation allow
  display of intracellular proteins following processing and transport to circulating
  CD8+ T lymphocytes. Canonical MHC II antigen presentation allows display of antigens
  derived from the extracellular environment to circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes. (B)
  Signals required for proper T-cell activation. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are activated
  following interaction with signal 1 provided through presentation of MHC I or II/peptide
  complexes at the cell surface with the T-cell receptor (TCR), as well as signal
  2 supplied by interaction of CD80/CD86 costimulation molecules expressed on antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs) with CD28 expressed on T cells. Only in presence of both signals will
  naive T cells be activated. Following activation, T cells may recognize and kill
  cells presenting only signal 1 (MHC/peptide). (C) Signaling pathways engaged following
  interaction of T cells with signals 1 and 2. T cells stimulated through the TCR
  engage MAPK pathway signaling, which results in production of cytokines such as
  IL-2. Signal 2 targets PI3K/AKT signaling, through which T-cell survival and proliferation
  result. Both signals are crucial for initial T-cell activation. (D) Overview of
  the receptors and ligands expressed on T cells and APCs, which may influence T-cell
  activation upon interaction. Several of these receptors may be expressed on T cells
  following T-cell activation as a mechanism to inhibit T-cell activation and prevent
  autoimmune disease.
