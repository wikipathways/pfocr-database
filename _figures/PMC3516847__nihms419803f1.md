caption: 'Roles of RKIP in intracellular signaling. (A) Downregulation of signaling
  mediated by inhibitory RKIP actions. (B) Activation of signaling elicited by removal
  of RKIP. Left: the ERK MAPK pathway. RKIP binds to activated RAF1 and inhibits its
  interaction with MEK, thus antagonizing MEK phosphorylation and activation. Phosphorylation
  of RKIP by protein kinase C (PKC) releases RKIP from RAF1. Center: the NF-κB pathway.
  RKIP interacts with the activating kinases of the NF-κB pathway: transforming growth
  factor β-activated kinase (TAK), IκB kinase-α (IKK-α), IκB kinase-β (IKK-β), and
  NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). Release of RKIP from TAK, IKKs, and NIK (by an unknown
  mechanism) results in the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB, which in turn
  releases NF-κB. Right: G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways. GPCR kinase-2
  (GRK2) antagonizes the activity of GPCRs. Phosphorylation of RKIP by PKC activates
  it for binding to GRK2, resulting in the inhibition of GRK2 activity. This allows
  GPCRs to interact with their cognate G-proteins (G), thus promoting GPCR-mediated
  signaling.'
