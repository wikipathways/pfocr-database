caption: TME lipids dictate CD8+ TILs functional heterogeneity. (A) CD8+ TILs utilize
  aerobic glycolysis to support their antitumor effects, which is inhibited in a glucose-deprived
  TME. Instead of relying on glucose, CD8 +TILs upregulate PPARα-mediated CPT1A expression
  in response to the environmental FAs and the FAO is therefore increased to compensate
  the energy deficit. This compensatory circuit is further reinforced by PD-1 signaling
  due to its inhibitory effects on aerobic glycolysis. (B) Increased uptake of TME
  FAs and oxidized lipids by CD36 drive CD8+ TILs dysfunction. Both Arachnoid acid
  (AA) and oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) induce abnormal cell death by
  ferroptosis, ox-LDL also increases p38 phosphorylation, which inhibits the transcription
  of effector cytokines like TNFα and IFNγ. LCFAs and VLCFAs poison CD8+ TILs through
  lipotoxicity and inhibit the VLCAD expression that in turn accelerates the accumulation
  of LCFAs and VLCFAs. (C) Tc9 cells are resistant to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis
  by its IL-9 autocrine-mediated STAT3/FAO pathway, which is impaired in the cholesterol-enriched
  TME. Oxysterol promotes the sumoylation of LXR that inhibits the p65 binding on
  IL-9 promoter and therefore decreased expression. Moreover, cholesterol accumulation
  in the cytoplasm promote ER stress sensor (XBP1) expression to directly induce inhibitory
  receptor expressions including PD-1 and 2B4.
