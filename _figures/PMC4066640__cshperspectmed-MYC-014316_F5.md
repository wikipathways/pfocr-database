caption: Model for MYC autorepression and general cellular gene repression by histone
  modification. In normal cells (left), MYC levels are low and EZH2 histone methyltransferase
  activity is suppressed by AKT phosphorylation. In cells with high MYC (center),
  the PTEN tumor suppressor is transcriptionally activated by MYC, leading to suppression
  of the PI3 kinase pathway and activation of EZH2 activity. Higher levels of EZH2
  promote increased H3K27 methylation, which is necessary and sufficient to mediate
  MYC autorepression and cellular gene repression. In cancer cells, which genetically
  lose the PTEN tumor suppression (right) or which might have mutations in the PI3
  kinase pathway, high levels of AKT activity continually suppress EZH2 activity and
  the accumulation of H3K27me3, preventing MYC autoregulation. (Figure based on data
  from ).
