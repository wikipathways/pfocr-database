caption: Repurposing of drugs on YAP (Yes-1 associated protein)-TEAD (transcriptional
  enhanced associate domain) system through cross-talking pathways. Hippo pathway
  core kinases (in blue) and final effector YAP are modulated by approved drugs through
  different cross-talking pathways. Dobutamine binds β1-adrenergic receptor and promotes
  LATS (large tumor suppressor) 1/2 phosphorylation through PKA (protein kinase A)
  signaling, while melatonin is believed to modulate YAP through pleiotropic mechanisms
  (GPCRs (G-protein coupled receptors) signaling in red). Statins, as HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
  CoA) reductase inhibitors, impair Rho signaling in orange and modulate actin cytoskeleton,
  impairing LATS1/2 activation altogether. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors target growth
  factors signaling in cerulean (PI3K-AKT pathway), green (MAPK (mitogen-activated
  protein kinase) pathway) and black and purple (MAPK pathway final effectors) according
  to the proper interested drug. Receptor autophosphorylation inhibitors, such as
  Gefitinib, Erlotinib, and Pazopanib, hit an ATP-binding site. Instead, Dasatinib
  is a Src/Bcr-abl dual inhibitor, while Losmapimod and Trametinib target downstream
  components of MAPK pathway. Dimethylfumarate inhibits GSK3β phosphorylation, preventing
  APC β-catenin destruction complex formation and undermining oncogenic β-catenin
  pathway in the process. Metformin, through AMPK phosphorylation and consequent half-time
  AMOT (Angiomotin) prolongment, promotes phosphorylation-independent YAP cytoplasmic
  sequestration by AMOT in yellow. Digitoxin, Verteporfin and Flufenamic acid and
  derivatives modulate YAP/TEAD interaction, as better discussed in paragraphs 3 and
  4.
