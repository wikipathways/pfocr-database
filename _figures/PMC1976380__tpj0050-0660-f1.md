caption: 'To make this figure more comprehensive, the results from this paper have
  been included. Enzymes are indicated by bold, capital letters. Regulatory proteins
  are given in gray boxes beside their target genes. Abbreviations are as follows:
  GPP, general phenylpropanoid pathway; PAL, phenylalanine ammonium lyase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumaroyl-CoA synthase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase;
  F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase;
  DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; F3GT, flavonol 3-O-glycosyltransferase; F7RT,
  flavonol 7-O-rhamnosyltransferase; FGT, flavonol glycosyltransferase; K, kaempferol;
  Q, quercetin; K 3-O-[glc-rha]-7-O-rha, kaempferol 3-O-[(rhamnosyl) glucoside]-7-O-rhamnoside;
  Q 3-O-[glc-rha]-7-O-rha, quercetin 3-O-[(rhamnosyl) glucoside]-7-O-rhamnoside; PFG,
  PRODUCTION OF FLAVONOL GLYCOSIDES. Note that the action of FLS is required for the
  biosynthesis of flavonols (light gray box) while DFR is necessary for the formation
  of anthocyanidins. Adapted from . The pathway leading to the formation of isorhamnetin
  is not illustrated.'
