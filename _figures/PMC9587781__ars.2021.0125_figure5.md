caption: Complement and the gut–kidney axis. During diabetes, there is an increase
  in serum levels of the anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, which ligate C3aR and C5aR1,
  respectively, on intestinal epithelial cells, leading to activation of the ERK pathway
  and IL-8 production. It is believed that this may be able to promote increased intestinal
  permeability. There is evidence that C5aR1 ligation decreases claudin-1 expression.
  The increased intestinal permeability permits the translocation of bacterial endotoxin
  and systemic inflammation, which may contribute to renal dysfunction. Whether C3a
  and C5a have direct effects at the level of the gut, or further downstream in diabetes
  has not yet been fully elucidated. Color images are available online.
