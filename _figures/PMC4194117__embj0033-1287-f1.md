caption: SIRT2 mediates deacetylation and activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PD), which catalyses the first committed step of the PPP. The PPP converts NADP+
  to NADPH and regenerates the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). A product of the PPP,
  ribose-5-phosphate, is used as a substrate for NAD+synthesis to increase SIRT2 activity
  and further activate the PPP. In this way, small increases in NAD+ may be amplified
  and sustained. Patients with a G6PD deficiency may benefit from molecules that raise
  NAD levels. Conversely, a decline in NAD+ with age could have deleterious effects
  on antioxidant defences and may underlie aspects of normal aging.
