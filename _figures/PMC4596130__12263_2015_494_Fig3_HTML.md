caption: Schematic showing hypothesised regulation of MT-2A gene expression by zinc.(1)
  Increased extracellular zinc is transported into the cell by the cellular zinc importer,
  ZIP1. (2) Higher concentration of intracellular zinc can activate transcription
  factor, MTF-1. (3) Zinc ions also can indirectly modulate the coactivator, C/EBPα,
  through the PI3K–Akt signalling pathway. (4) Activated MTF-1 and C/EBPα can translocate
  into the nucleus, binding to the promoter region of MT-2A gene, upregulating gene
  transcription. (5) Upregulation of gene expression can eventuate in increased MT-2A
  protein. (6) Higher concentration of MT serves to sequester intracellular zinc,
  thereby creating a negative feedback signal within the cell. PTP-1 protein tyrosine
  phosphatase-1β, PI3K phosphoinositide 3-kinase, GSK-3 glycogen synthase kinase-3,
  C/EBPα CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α, MTF-1 metal-regulatory transcription factor-1,
  MRE metal-responsive element

  expression of zinc transporters in healthy adults.
