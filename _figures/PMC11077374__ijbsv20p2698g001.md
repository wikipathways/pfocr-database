caption: The role of lncRNAs in modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in
  pancreatic cancer. Most lncRNAs indirectly regulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  through sponging miRNA, among which the top half of lncRNAs have an activation effect
  and the bottom two have an inhibitory effect. The targets of miRNAs are directly
  the components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, while other target proteins regulate
  the components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Among them, factors that can activate
  Wnt/β-catenin are marked in red, and those that inhibit Wnt/β-catenin are marked
  in blue. In addition, there are also lncRNAs (such as LINC01614 and LINC01197) that
  directly bind to Wnt/β-catenin pathway proteins and inhibit their physiological
  activity. Specifically, HuR can stabilize RNA, including mRNA and lncRNA. The combination
  of TSLNC8, HuR and β-catenin mRNA can promote β-catenin translation and HuR can
  stabilize WTAPP1, which enhances WTAP translation by collecting EIF3B into WTAP
  mRNA and finally regulates Wnt/β-catenin pathway
