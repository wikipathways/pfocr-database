caption: Diagram of the innate immunosuppression in hypoxic TME. Hypoxia induces the
  production of VEGF, EGFR, CCL2, CCL5, CSF-1 and other stimulators, leading to the
  recruitment and aggregation of TAMs. Oncostatin M, succinate, eotaxin and GM-CSF
  polarize M1 macrophages into M2 macrophages which demonstrate tumor-supporting and
  immunosuppressive functions. Hypoxia strongly up-regulates the expression of REDD1,
  it could inhibit mTOR to promote abnormal angiogenesis. HIF-1 directly up-regulates
  CD47, making breast cancer cells escape from macrophage-mediated phagocytosis through
  CD47-SIRPα axis. Hypoxia up-regulates GPER in CAFs, which is involved in the control
  of IL1R1, IL-β and VEGF, resulting angiogenesis and invasion of breast cancer cells.
  Hypoxia damages the cytotoxicity of NK cells by reducing the phosphorylation levels
  of ERK and STAT3. While Under 1.5% PO2, the ERK/STAT3 pathway reprograms preactivated
  NK cells through HIF-1α stabilization and higher expression of its target genes
  BNIP3, PDK1, VEGF, PKM2, LDHA to restore the cytotoxicity of NK cell. HIF-1a increases
  the expression of miR-210 in MDSC, regulating Arg1 Cxcl12 and IL16 to enhance immunosuppression
  of MDSC. Also, HIF-1a up-regulates VISTA in MDSCs mediating T cell inhibition.
