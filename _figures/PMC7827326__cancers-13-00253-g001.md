caption: Main target signaling pathways of antiangiogenics. VEGF was the first signaling
  pathway inhibited by antiangiogenic drugs. Unfortunately, the benefits of anti-VEGF/VEGFR
  are limited and patients develop resistance. Therefore, drugs were developed that
  inhibit alternative signaling pathways such as FGF and PDGF. Multikinase inhibitors
  (MKIs) simultaneously target different components of these pathways. HGF and its
  receptor c-Met can also be inhibited by antiangiogenics. The angiopoietin pathway
  can be inhibited by preventing it traditional signaling through Tie2 or through
  integrins. There are also antiangiogenic drugs against TGF-β and its receptors ALK1
  and endoglin.
