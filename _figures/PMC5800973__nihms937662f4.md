caption: CD81-positive EVs secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) enhance
  motility, protrusion and invasion in breast cancer cells via the autocrine Wnt-PCP
  signaling pathway. EVs from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) enhance tumor growth in
  vivo and promote VEGF and CXCR4 expression in tumor cells via the ERK1/2 and p38
  MAPK pathway. EVs derived from CAFs enhance viability of prostate cancer cells in
  nutrient-deprived condition by regulating their metabolism via miRNAs. Similarly,
  EVs from CAFs enhance growth in pancreatic cancer cells in nutrient-stressed microenvironment
  by supplying free metabolites that are incorporated into the central carbon metabolism.
  Platelets derived microvesicles chemoattract lung cancer cells by upregulating mRNA
  expression of MT1-MMP in cancer cells. MT1-MMP has is essential for reconditioning
  extracellular matrix components, activation of proMMP-2, cleaving a multifunctional
  adhesion molecule CD44, and cleaving integrin-binding adhesion receptor, subsequently
  enhancing cancer cell invasion. T-cells secrete bioactive EVs that induce cytotoxicity
  in dendritic cells (DCs) by activating the Fas/FasL pathway. These EVs also decrease
  pMHC1 expression on the surface of DCs, resulting in diminished antitumor immune
  response. FasL-positive EVs derived from CD8+ T-cell lymphocytes activate c-FLIPl,
  ERK, and NF-kB signaling pathways to increase the MMP9 expression in cancer cells,
  enhancing the invasive potential of tumors.
