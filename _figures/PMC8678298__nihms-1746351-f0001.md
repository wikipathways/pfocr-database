caption: '(A) The proximal tubule of the renal nephron is the principal site of urate
  (UA) handling through both secretion (blue arrow) and reabsorption (purple arrow).
  (B) Expression patterns of human urate transporter genes. Secretory transporter
  genes are shown in blue, while reabsorptive transporter genes are shown in purple.
  Gradients are displayed on the membranes of expression, with SLC22A6/7/8 and SLC2A9
  coding for basolateral proteins, and ABCG2, SLC17A1/3, and SLC22A11/12/13 encoding
  apical transporters. The darker the color, the higher the expression, based on data
  from the Kidney Interactive Transcriptomics database[]. Percentages delineate the
  amount of the original urate filtered load is either reabsorbed (purple arrows)
  or secreted (blue arrow) leading to a final fraction excretion of urate (FEUA) shown
  in black. Transporter protein localization and transport patterns are shown for
  the S1 (C) and S3 (D) segments. (C) Transporters most abundantly expressed in the
  S1 segments include transporters of the secretory pathway: NPT1 (SLC17A1), NPT4
  (SLC17A3), OAT1 (SLC22A6) and OAT3 (SLC22A8), shown in blue, and transporters of
  the reabsorptive pathway: OAT4 (SLC22A11), OAT10 (SLC22A13), and SLC2A9/GLUT9 (SLC2A9),
  shown in purple. (D) Transporters most abundantly expressed in the S3 segment include
  secretory pathway transporters ABCG2/BCRP (ABCG2), OAT1, OAT2 (SLC22A7) and OAT3
  shown in blue, and reabsorptive pathway transporters URAT1 (SLC22A12), SLC2A9, OAT4,
  and OAT10, shown in purple. Additional transporters that are functionally coupled
  to urate transport include the sodium cotransporters SMCT1 (SLC5A8) and NaDC3 (SLC13A3)
  shown in red. Blue and purple arrows indicate the direction of urate transport,
  while black and red arrows indicate transport of counter ions. (E) Urate is also
  excreted through the jejunum segment of the small intestine, where urate may enter
  through basolateral SLC2A9 (**well established in mice, requires further confirmation
  in humans), and is then secreted into the lumen primarily through ABCG2 with some
  potential contribution from SLC17A4 (SLC14A4). *Some transporters have many known
  endogenous substrates, with only the most relevant shown. Lac: lactate; αKG: alpha-ketoglutarate;
  OA: organic anion; Pi: inorganic phosphate. Endogenous OAs for the OATs may include
  the following: OAT1: medium chain fatty acids, citrulline, prostaglandin E2 prostaglandin
  F2, cyclic nucleotides (cAMP, cGMP), folate[, , ]; OAT2: cAMP, GMP, GDP, GTP, cGMP,
  glutamate, glutarate, α-ketoglutarate, L-ascorbate, orotic acid, trigonelline, hypoxanthine,
  prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2, estrone-3-sulfate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate[,
  ]; OAT3: cAMP, cortisol, glutarate, prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2α, dehydroepiandrosterone
  sulphate, estrone sulphate, estradiol-17β-glucuronide, taurocholate, cholate, indoxyl
  sulphate [, , , ]; OAT4 estrone-3-sulfate, prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2, dehydroepiandrosterone
  sulphate[, ]; OAT10: lactate, nicotinate, glutathione, succinate[, ]. An additional
  endogenous OA for NPT1 and NP4 is inorganic phosphate co-transported in cis with
  Na+[, ]. SMCT1 mediates sodium dependent transport of monocarboxylates including
  short chain fatty acids, pyruvate and nicotinate[], while NaDC3 mediates sodium
  coupled transport of di- and tri-carboxylates including, α-ketoglutarate, glutarate
  and its derivatives, citrate, succinate, and amino acid N-acetyl-L-aspartate[].'
