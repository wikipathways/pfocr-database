caption: Major pathways involved in PCNSL pathogenesis. Various molecular alterations
  converge on the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway, which is tonically activated. This
  is complemented by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway, which is activated by mutated
  MYD88, a master signaling instance of the TLR pathway. CD79B, encoding part of the
  BCR complex, is the second most frequently mutated gene in PCNSL. Several other
  genes that regulate the BCR pathway are mutated in a characteristic manner; genes
  with an inhibitory effect are rendered non-functional and genes activating the BCR
  pathway are constitutively activated. The BCM complex, consisting of BCL10, CARD11,
  and MALT1, functions as a gatekeeper of the NF-kB pathway. CARD11 is recurrently
  mutated; MALT1 is part of the recurrent 18q21 amplification, often together with
  the anti-apoptotic BCL2 gene. A hallmark of PCNSL is an activated NF-κB pathway,
  although the genes of the NF-κB pathway are not recurrently mutated. Tonic BCR signaling
  activates at least three different pathways, including the NF-κB pathway, the PI3
  kinase (PI3K) pathway, and the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway. TLR signaling also activates
  the NF-κB pathway, the PI3K pathway, and the JAK/STAT pathway. The tumor suppressor
  gene CDKN2A, which encodes p14ARF and p16INK4a, is rendered non-functional in PCNSL
  through either mutation or methylation. TBL1XR1 and PRDM1 mutations are responsible
  for a shift in B cell differentiation to an IgM memory B cell-like phenotype. The
  synergistic effect of the various activated pathways, together with mutations in
  distinct genes and the constitutive expression of important transcription factors
  for B cell differentiation, including MYC and PAX5, results in tumor cell survival
  with increased proliferation and blocked apoptosis. In addition, a loss of MHC class
  I facilitates immune evasion in an immunoprivileged organ.
