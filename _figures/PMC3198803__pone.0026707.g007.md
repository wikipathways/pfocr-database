caption: Transport of carbohydrates through the multi-protein phosphoenolpyruvate
  phosphotransferase system (PTS) ensures a typical PTS-mediated signal transduction
  pathway for CcpA regulation. CcpA-mediated regulation results in altered expression
  of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and classical virulence factors, including
  cell wall associated proteins, transcriptional regulators and phosphorylcholine.
  Repression and activation are represented by red and green arrows, respectively.
  Dashed lines indicate metabolic regulation. G6P, Glucose 6-phosphate; F6P, fructose
  6-phosphate; CW, cell wall; MA, mixed-acid fermentation; PcpA, choline binding protein
  PcpA; BgaA, beta-galactosidaseA; NanAB, neuraminidases A and B; PCho, Phosphorylcholine;
  SodA, superoxide dismutase, manganese-dependent; StrH, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase;
  TCS07 and ComDE, two-component systems.
