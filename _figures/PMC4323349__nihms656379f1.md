caption: Ethanol (EtOH) is subject to metabolism by catalase (CAT), cytochrome P450
  isoform 2E1 (CYP2E1) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Acetaldehyde is metabolized
  by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) isoforms 1A1, 1B1 and 2. In the glutathione (GSH)
  pathway, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), which includes two subunits the catalytic
  subunit (GCLC) and the modifier subunit (GCLM), catalyzes the synthesis of γ-glutamylcysteine
  (γ-GC). γ-GC is then coupled to glycine by glutathione synthetase (GSS) to form
  GSH. During oxidative processes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) form which can cause
  lipid peroxidation. ROS can be reduced by GSH, in the process forming GSSG, the
  oxidized form.
