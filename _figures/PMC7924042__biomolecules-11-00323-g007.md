caption: Catalpol on AMPK pathway in alleviating DN. Under normal circumstances, activation
  of AMPK could deactivate NF-κB. In DN, AMPK is being deactivated, which leads to
  activation of NF-κB. This could induce nuclear translocation and hence upregulate
  the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as NLRP3, ASC, and pro-CASP1. Later, caspase
  1 is being cleaved and turns pro-IL-1β into IL-1β. IL-1β is secreted out of the
  membrane and causes inflammatory response. Catalpol acts to reverse the AMPK deactivation
  and hence downregulate NF-κB, leading to decreased inflammatory response.
