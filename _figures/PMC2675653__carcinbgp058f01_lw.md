caption: 'CART analysis of NER pathway and esophageal cancer risk. ORs and 95% CIs
  (in parenthesis) are presented underneath each terminal node box. Please refer to  for
  name of the SNPs. For each SNP, ‘WW’ represents wild type, ‘WM’ represents heterozygous
  genotype and ‘MM’ represents homozygous variant genotype. Note: the total number
  of cases and controls does not add up to 387 and 465, respectively, because only
  subjects without missing SNP data were included in the analysis.'
