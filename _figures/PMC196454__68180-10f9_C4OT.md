caption: 'Transcriptional cascade regulating ASE(L/R) asymmetry. (A) Summary  of expression
  of transcription factors and their effectors in ASE(L/R).  Circles indicate gfp
  expressing (green)/nonexpressing (not filled)  ASEL and ASER cells. The ASE(L/R)
  patterns of expression of ubiquitously  expressed genes (unc-37 and lin-49) are
  not shown. Notes:  1Low levels of cog-1 activity in ASEL are inferred from  reporter
  gene assays as well as the observation that cog-1 is  required in ASEL in a ceh-36
  mutant to repress lim-6  expression. 2lim-6 is not required to initiate its own  expression
  but to maintain it (data not shown); the empty circles refer to  expression in the
  adult, after autoregulation has been established.  3flp-6::gfp was used to assess
  bilaterally  symmetric ASE fate. 4See  for an explanation of the reappearance of
  ASE asymmetry.  (B) A molecular model for the establishment of asymmetric  gcy-5
  and gcy-7 expression. Arrows reflect genetic pathway  interactions, which subsume
  either a direct interaction of a protein with the  respective transcriptional regulatory
  elements or the presence of intermediary  factors. Different sizes of the COG-1
  protein in ASEL versus ASER are meant to  reflect different protein levels brought
  about by differential activation or  repression of cog-1 transcription (model #1
  or model #2, which are  not mutually exclusive). Note that low levels of cog-1 must
  be  present in ASEL because, in a ceh-36 and lin-49 mutant  background, a role for
  cog-1 is revealed in ASEL  (). Differential  expression of COG-1 in ASEL and ASER
  is either achieved through differential  transcriptional repression in ASEL (model
  #1) or differential transcriptional  activation in ASER (model #2). Because the
  loss of lim-6 results in  activation of gcy-5 expression, we invoke CHE-1 as a potential
  direct  positive regulator of gcy-5 expression, a notion supported by  ectopically
  expressed CHE-1 being able to induce gcy-5 expression  (data not shown; ). We and
  others have also shown that CHE-1 regulates  bilaterally symmetric features of ASE
  fate  (; this  paper). CEH-36 and LIN-49 do not regulate these features (data not
  shown).'
