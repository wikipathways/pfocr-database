caption: Synthesis of ceramide occurs via three main pathways, each of which utilizes
  enzymes with multiple isoforms, pathway-specific localization, and/or reactants
  with variable R-groups to yield a diverse array of Ceramide species with unique
  bioactivity. The De Novo Pathway occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and begins
  with rate-limiting Serine Palmitoyltransferase-catalyzed condensation of Palmitoyl-CoA
  and L-Serine to form 3-keto-Sphinganine, which is then reduced to Sphinganine by
  3-keto-Sphinganine Reductase. Ceramide Synthases 1-6 add a fatty acid chain (blue)
  of variable length (R) to form Dihydroceramide, which is then is converted to Ceramide
  by Dihydroceramide Desaturase and transported to the Golgi. The Sphingomyelinase
  Pathway hydrolyzes Sphingomyelin to Ceramide via acid or neutral Sphingomyelinases
  1-5, which are found in the plasma membrane, cytosol, mitochondria, endosomes, and
  lysosomes, . The Salvage Pathway breaks down complex sphingolipids such as gangliosides
  in endo-lysosomal compartments to Sphingosine, which may then be transported to
  the ER and reacylated to Ceramide by Ceramide Synthases 1-5. Alternatively, Sphingosine
  (R1 = H) may be phosphorylated at R1 to Sphingosine-1-Phosphate by Sphingosine Kinase–.
  Ceramide may be phosphorylated at R1 by Ceramide Kinase to generate Ceramide-1-Phosphate,
  or it may be glycosylated to form Cerebrosides (Glucosylceramides and Galactosylceramides).
  Addition of a Galactose residue to a Glucosylceramide yields a Lactosylceramide,
  which may be further glycosylated or acquire sialic acid residues at various sites
  (Gn, Gn+1..) to form Gangliosides.
