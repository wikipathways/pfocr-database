caption: Co-expression network analysis reveals a transcriptional association between
  specialized metabolic pathways and hormones. (A) Nodes represent pathways, while
  edges connect significantly connected pathways. Edges within the same pathway type
  are colored blue, while edges connecting different pathway types are colored gray.
  Node colors represent different pathway types. (B) Ethylene (left) and phytosterol
  (right) biosynthesis pathways. Nodes represent enzymes, while edges connect enzymes
  correlated with r>0.6. Edges within the same pathway are blue, while edges connecting
  two pathways are gray.
