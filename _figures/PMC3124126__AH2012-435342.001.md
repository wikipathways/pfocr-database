caption: 'Molecular signaling cascades which normally control mTORC1 activity and
  may become dysregulated in B-cell lymphomas leading to aberrant mTORC1 signaling
  activation. The figure also demonstrates the functions of mTORC1 and mTORC2. (a)
  PI3K/Akt pathway: upon activation PI3K most possibly induces mTORC2 complex stimulation
  and also promotes the translocation of Akt and PDK1 to the cell membrane, where
  Akt becomes activated by PDK1 and mTORC2. Then, Akt activates mTORC1 by way of two
  mechanisms: (1) indirectly through downregulation of the inhibitory effect of the
  TSC1-TSC2 complex on Rheb protein and (2) directly through phosphorylation of PRAS40
  (proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kilodaltons), which is a component of the mTORC1
  complex. The tumor suppressor phosphatases PTEN and SHIP oppose PI3K-mediated Akt
  activation. (b) RAF/MEK/ERK pathway: once activated this pathway triggers mTORC1
  activity indirectly through inactivation of the TSC1-TSC2 complex by ERK and RSK
  (ribosomal S6 kinase, 90 kDa). The RAF/MEK/ERK pathway also directly activates mTORC1
  through excitatory phosphorylation of raptor, a component of the mTORC1 complex,
  by RSK. (c) p38 is suggested to induce mTORC1 activity by acting downstream of or
  in parallel to Rheb. (d) PLD/phosphatidic acid (PA) pathway: upon activation PLD
  hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine (PTDC) to generate choline (CHOL) and PA. Subsequently,
  PA activates mTORC1 by an unknown mechanism. (e) LKB1/AMP-dependent protein kinase
  (AMPK) pathway: the tumor suppressor kinase LKB1 activates AMP-dependent protein
  kinase (AMPK). AMPK, in turn, inhibits mTORC1 through activation of the TSC1-TSC2
  complex and direct inhibitory phosphorylation of raptor.'
