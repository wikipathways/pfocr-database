caption: UST treatments specifically target the IL-12/IL-23 signaling pathway. IL-12
  and IL-23 signal through different receptor complexes. IL-12 signals through a receptor
  complex composed of IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2, whereas IL-23 signals via IL-12Rβ1 and
  IL-23R. Both IL­12R and IL­23R interact with the JAK family members JAK2 and TYK2
  and then assist in phosphorylating of STAT4 and STAT3; IL­12 signals via pSTAT4,
  whereas IL­23 mainly linked to pSTAT3. The p40 subunit of both IL-12 and IL-23 attaches
  directly to IL-12Rβ1 and acts as a common regulator for both signaling pathways.
  UST targets the shared p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, thereby inhibiting the development
  of IFN-γ–producing Th1 cells, IL-17–producing Th17 cells, and the turning on of
  other immune cells such as NK cells, B cells, ILCs, NKT cells, and γδT cells. UST,
