caption: KEGG pathway analyses of DESR genes expressed across multiple time points
  implicated the Adipocytokine signaling pathway as playing a prominent role in successful
  CNS axon regeneration. Black pentagons identify DESR’s. Ellipses indicate differential
  expression (DE; FDR < 0.05) in response to injury (up or down) in at least one tissue,
  during at least one time point. The Adipocytokine signaling pathway image was obtained
  from KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes). Additional_File7_Adipocytokine_Signaling_Pathway_Gene_Expression_Data.xlsm
  contains an Excel spreadsheet with all 115 genes (S&L homeologs are separate entries)
  belonging to this pathway, together with their ΔFPKM values [log2(fold change, injury/control)],
  and their p and q (FDR-adjusted p) values for differential expression, at each time
  point, for all three tissues

  injury in Xenopus laevis reveals a core set of genes inherent in successful regeneration
  of vertebrate central nervous system axons.
