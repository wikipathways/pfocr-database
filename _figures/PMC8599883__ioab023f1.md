caption: 'Diagram of the signaling pathways that regulate GV arrest and GVBD. The
  NPPC secreted from peripheral MGCs binds to NPR2 in CGCs to upregulate cGMP synthesis.
  The cGMP passively diffuses into the GV oocyte via Cx37 predominant gap junctions
  to inhibit PDE3A, thus maintaining an elevated concentration of cAMP in the oocyte
  through constitutive activation of AC by GPR3/12. The high concentration of cAMP
  activates PKA to directly inhibit MPF through APC/C proteasomal degradation of CCNB1
  and WEE1B phosphorylation of CDK1 in addition to inhibiting Cdc25b activity. The
  CGCs also secrete ZIF that prevents uptake of free intracellular zinc by the oocyte,
  possibly through inhibition of Zip6/10. In the CGCs, zinc is required for SMAD2/3
  activation to maintain the cumulus phenotype, while in GV oocytes, zinc inhibits
  premature activation of the Mos–MAPK3/1 pathway. Following the LH surge, EGF-LPs
  secreted by MGCs bind to the EGFR in CGCs to initiate the closure of CGC–oocyte
  gap junctions, thus preventing further cGMP diffusion into the oocyte. Activation
  of the EGFR in CGCs also inhibits ZIF activity, allowing free intracellular zinc
  accumulation in the oocyte during maturation. The reduction in intra-oocyte cGMP
  concentration increases PDE3A activity to degrade cAMP. As PKA activity is subsequently
  reduced, MPF is activated by increased CCNB1 availability and CDK1 dephosphorylation
  by Cdc25b, leading to both activation of Mos–MAPK3/1 and GVBD. Abbreviations: AC,
  adenylyl cyclase; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; Zn++, zinc. Arrows indicate
  activation and bars represent inhibition. Solid lines indicate active pathways,
  while dashed lines represent inactive pathways.'
