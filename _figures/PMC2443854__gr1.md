caption: The Essential Components of Nodal SignalingTGF-β proteins are synthesized
  as pre-pro-proteins requiring cleavage of the signal peptide (black) and prodomain
  (orange) prior to dimerization of active ligand (red diamonds). Cells responsive
  to Nodal-like ligands display Type I/II Activin receptors on their cell surface
  with coreceptors of the EGF-CFC family required for certain ligands, such as Nodal
  and Gdf1. The Lefty proteins (yellow) interfere with mature ligand binding to receptors.
  Ligand binding triggers transphosphorlyation of type I receptors by the type II
  receptor serine-threonine kinase domain. Receptor-regulated R-Smads (green) become
  activated on the inner surface of the cell membrane through phosphorylation by type
  I receptors. Activated Smad complexes include two R-Smads and the common Smad4 (black)
  that translocate into the nucleus to affect gene expression. Target genes typically
  contain binding sites for Smads and cofactors such as FoxH1 (red triangle) to achieve
  tissue-specific gene expression. Human mutations have been previously described
  in LEFTYA (MIM +601877), LEFTYB (MIM ∗603037), ACVR2B (MIM +602730) (see reference  for
  review), CFC1 (MIM ∗605194),TDGF1 (MIM +187395), and GDF1 (MIM +602880).
