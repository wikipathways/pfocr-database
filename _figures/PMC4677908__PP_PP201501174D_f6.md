caption: Genomic and transcriptomic features of central carbon metabolism in C. pyrenoidosa.
  Metabolic steps are represented by arrows. Dashed lines represent multiple metabolic
  steps. Boxes indicate those nodes where carbon skeletons from amino acid degradation
  feed into the pathway. Genes encoding the enzymes of these pathways are labeled
  in red. Up- or down-regulation of mRNA expression under heterotrophic growth (compared
  with heterotrophy 0 h, leftward arrows) and the heterotrophy to photoautotrophy
  transition (compared with heterotrophy 72 h, rightward arrows) based on mRNA-seq
  data are indicated with red upward arrows and green downward arrows, respectively.
  The full names of the corresponding genes are given in Supplemental Table S9.
