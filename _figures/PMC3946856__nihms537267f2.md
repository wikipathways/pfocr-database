caption: Testosterone exerts slower genomic actions by diffusing through the plasma
  membrane and binding with intracellular androgen receptors to form complexes. These
  complexes can then homodimerize and translocate to the nucleus and act as transcription
  factors at androgen response element (ARE) DNA sequences to enhance or repress transcription.
  Testosterone can also exert a number of rapid nongenomic effects through actions
  at membrane bound receptors (shown as examples, G protein coupled receptor and epidermal
  growth factor receptor). Rapid effects of androgens can induce a number of intracellular
  events such as stimulation of the MAPK-ERK pathway.
