caption: 'Overview of the IL-17 signaling pathway in the pathophysiology of spondyloarthritis.
  Genetic predispositions, including HLA-B27, ERAP1, and IL23R, combined with environmental
  triggers, such as dysbiosis and mechanical stress, lead to the activation of the
  innate immune system. Under the influence of TGF-β and IL-6, naïve T cells differentiate
  into Th17 cells, while IL-23 drives the activation of Th17, Tc17, γδ T cells, and
  ILC3s. Once activated, these cells serve as potent sources of IL-17 cytokines, including
  IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17A/IL-17F heterodimers, which bind to IL-17RA/RC receptors
  on target cells. Receptor activation triggers intracellular signaling pathways,
  including NF-κB, MAPK, and C/EBP-β, leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory
  genes such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α. These cytokines recruit and activate mast cells,
  neutrophils, and basophils, further amplifying inflammation. This inflammatory cascade
  drives key pathological features of spondyloarthritis, including enthesitis (inflammation
  at tendon or ligament attachment sites), ankylosis (abnormal bone formation and
  joint fusion), and chronic joint inflammation. Abbreviations: BASO: basophils; C/EBP-β
