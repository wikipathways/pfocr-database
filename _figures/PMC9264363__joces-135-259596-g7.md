caption: Working model for the role of the BAG6 complex during MAVS biogenesis. The
  molecular basis for the post-translational targeting and insertion of TA proteins
  such as MAVS into the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) are poorly defined () (pathway
  1a). Failed mitochondrial import can result in the mislocalisation of MAVS to the
  cytosol, where it may be recognised by one or more quality control machineries and
  targeted for proteasomal degradation () (pathway 1b). A fraction of newly synthesised
  MAVS also engages the BAG6 complex either directly (pathway 3) or after transfer
  from SGTA (pathway 2). In the later case, SGTA may bind MAVS as its TMD leaves the
  ribosomal exit tunnel or after its release into the cytosol (). The BAG6 complex
  acts upstream of MAVS ‘misinsertion’ into the ER membrane, which is most likely
  facilitated by the EMC (pathway 4a). It is currently unknown whether additional
  factors act between the BAG6 complex and the EMC insertase (pathway 4a, see ?).
  BAG6 binding might also enable the proteasomal degradation of mislocalised MAVS
  () (pathway 4b). At the ER membrane, ‘mistargeted’ MAVS can be recognised by the
  P5A-ATPase ATP13A1 and extracted to the cytosol () (pathway 5a) for either proteasomal
  degradation (pathway 5b) or reinsertion into the MOM via an ER-SURF pathway () (pathway
  5c). The access of an ER-localised pool of MAVS to ER-MOM contacts sites (MAMs)
  that facilitate MAVS oligomerisation and downstream signalling () (pathway 6) may
  be modulated by the innate immune response.
