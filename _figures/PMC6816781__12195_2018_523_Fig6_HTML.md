caption: Schematic diagram of the signaling pathway regarding the cell cycle regulation
  in human bladder transitional carcinoma/BFTC-905 cells after stimulated by LSS.
  ↑ and ↓ denote up- and down-regulation of the protein induced by LSS. ⊥ represents
  an inhibitory effect on cyclin–CDK interaction. The block with black background
  indicates that the molecule is not involved in the mechanism of LSS-induced cell
  cycle arrest.
