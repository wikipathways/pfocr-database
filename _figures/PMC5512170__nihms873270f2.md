caption: The figure illustrates bipartite binding of SAP97 simultaneously to the ß1-AR
  PBM (via its second PDZ) and to AKAP5 (via the I3 domain of SAP97). The figure indicates
  that PDE4D8 was bound to SAP97 as well. Activation of the ß1-AR signaling pathway
  in the membranes increases cyclic AMP, which activates PKA. Spatiotemporal activity
  of cyclic AMP is contained through its degradation by receptosomal PDE4D8. Activated
  PKA in turn, faithfully phosphorylates the ß1-AR on the serine at position 312 to
  imprint a recycling signal onto the ß1-AR prior to its sequestration.
