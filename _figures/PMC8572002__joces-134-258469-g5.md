caption: Compartmentalization in mammalian cancer cells. (A) In HepG2 cells, a hepatocarcinoma-derived
  cell line, PFKL is localized in small clusters in normoxic conditions. Hypoxia generates
  large clusters of PFKL in an RNA-dependent manner as treatment with RNase prevents
  their formation. (B) Hypoxic conditions in the interior of solid tumors may induce
  an increase in the size of PFKL clusters to enhance glycolytic activity and promote
  survival. (C) Glucosomes, constitutive assemblies of glycolysis enzymes, are present
  in Hs578T cells and other cancer cell lines even in the absence of hypoxia. Treatment
  with metabolites that promote alternative glucose utilization pathways (serine biosynthesis
  or the pentose phosphate pathway) leads to changes in granule size which may correlate
  with flux of metabolites into these alternative pathways. Glucosomes may be identical
  with the small PFKL clusters in A. (D) Glucosomes contain both glycolytic and gluconeogenic
  enzymes, allowing potential control of glycolytic and gluconeogenic flux through
  PFKL (glycolysis) or FBPase (gluconeogenesis) activity via conversion of F6P and
  F16BP. Downstream reactions can promote gluconeogenesis by conversion of oxaloacetate
  from the TCA cycle to PEP via PEPCK or complete glycolysis by conversion of PEP
  into pyruvate and ATP catalyzed by PYK.
