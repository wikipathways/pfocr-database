caption: The EGFR is a growth factor receptor well known for its capacity to induce
  mitogenic stimuli. Nevertheless, it is also well established that the EGFR is important
  for the differentiation of specific cell types. In recent years it has been revealed
  that binding characteristics of EGF ligands and qualitative differences in signaling
  downstream of the receptor dictate the dynamics of gene expression and the fate
  of recipient cells. Sustained signals downstream of the receptor induces stable
  ERK activation and leads to growth arrest and cell differentiation, while an oscillating
  signal downstream of the receptor induces a repetitive activation and inactivation
  of ERK, leading to proliferation of the target cell. AREG is distinct from most
  other EGF-like growth factors in that it can not only induce a mitogenic signal
  but can also induce cell differentiation. This is explained by a single amino acid
  difference in the receptor-binding domain, which decreases the stability of the
  AREG-EGFR. Such interaction fails to induce receptor internalization and enables
  AREG to induce a sustained signal downstream of the receptor. In contrast, most
  other EGFR ligands, such as EGF, TGFα or HB-EGF, bind EGFR with high affinity and
  thereby induce internalization and degradation of the receptor, and induce negative
  feedback loops within the MAP-kinase signaling cascade. This activation and termination
  of an induced signal by the high-affinity ligands of the EGFR in effect lead to
  a ligand-specific oscillation of the MAP-kinase signaling pathway and thus a mitogenic
  signal in the recipient cell.
