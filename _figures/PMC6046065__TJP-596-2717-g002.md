caption: The yeast S. cerevisiae constitutes a versatile system that can be reconstituted
  with different components of the MCUC machinery (e.g. MCU and EMRE and additionally
  MCUb, MICU1 and/or MICU2, as represented with dashed lines). When D‐Lactate (D‐Lac)
  is supplied to mitochondria as the energy source, it provides a bioenergetic shunt
  pathway that minimizes the detection of false‐positive hits. This drug screen platform
  allows the quantification of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake kinetics based on mitochondria‐targeted‐aequorin
  luminescence emitted at 469 nm. MCUC modulators are accurately identified based
  on their effects on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake kinetics. MAS, mannitol‐sucrose buffer;
  DLD, D‐lactate:cytochrome c oxidoreductase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; Q, coenzyme
  Q; Cytc, cytochrome c; II, succinate dehydrogenase; III, coenzyme Q:cytochrome c‐oxidoreductase;
  IV, cytochrome c oxidase.
