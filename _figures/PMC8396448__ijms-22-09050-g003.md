caption: Hypothetic cell death pathways of RGCs under diabetic stress. Diabetic stress
  includes hyperglycemia, AGEs signaling, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and polyol
  pathway. These biochemical injuries are similar to physical injuries. In fact, some
  cell death mechanisms of biochemical injuries are, in part, common with those of
  physical injuries. Thus, the scheme partly includes evidence derived from optic
  nerve injury models and retinal culture studies. In cultured retinas, c-Fos is essential
  for neuronal apoptosis after injury []. C-Fos transfers the cell death signals to
  mitochondria by p53 upregulation resulting in Bax upregulation and Bcl-xL downregulation
  []. C-Jun is a partner of c-Fos and makes heterodimer activator protein-1 (AP-1).
  Retinas exposed to high glucose activate c-Jun and JNK in neurons in the ganglion
  cell layer []. Thus, the c-Fos/c-Jun (AP-1)/JNK signaling axis is related to neuronal
  cell death under diabetic stress []. Caspase -8, -9, and -3 are associated with
  neuronal cell death []. In fact, overexpression of Bcl-xL rescues damaged retinal
  ganglion cells []. In AGEs exposed retina, caspase-9, and apoptosis-inducing factor
  (AIF) expression are correlated with increasing neuronal cell death []. Thus, both
  caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways are associated with the AGE-induced
  neuronal cell death []. The AGE-RAGE signaling results in increasing the production
  of ROS which leads to ER stress-induced apoptosis. In fact, taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic
  acid (TUDCA) and anti-ER stress reagents reduce neuronal cell death in AGE-exposed
  retinas []. ROS production is also associated with pyroptosis via cleavage of GSDMD
  by caspase-1 or -11. Autophagy signaling is usually regulated by the mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway under physiological conditions. Under diabetic stress,
  the intrinsic survival pathway should be decreased resulting in activation of autophagy
  signaling. Over activation of autophagy signaling may cause to autophagic cell death.
