caption: The WNT signaling pathway and targeting therapeutic strategies. WNT ligands
  bind to FZD and LRP5/6 receptors to phosphorylate DVL, and then phosphorylated DVL
  recruits the destruction complex to the plasma membrane. This inhibits GSK3 and
  prevents phosphorylation of β-catenin, resulting in the stabilization and accumulation
  of β-catenin proteins to form a complex with TCF/LEF in the nucleus, thereby activating
  the transcription of downstream target genes. There are several targeting strategies
  that prevent the activation of WNT signaling, such as targeting WNT ligands and
  their receptors, inhibiting the WNT secretion by targeting porcupine, and disrupting
  the interaction between CBP and β-catenin
