caption: In cardiomyocytes, this study is the first to demonstrate that 20-HETE upregulates
  AT1 receptor expression, thereby amplifying the biological effects of Ang II. Concurrently,
  Ang II induces CYP4A expression through an AT1 receptor-mediated signaling pathway,
  promoting 20-HETE production. Subsequently, 20-HETE activates NOX2 and NOX4 via
  the GPR75 receptor, leading to excessive intracellular ROS generation and mitochondrial
  oxidative damage. The 20-HETE/GPR75 axis further mediates Ang II-induced intracellular
  Ca2+ overload, where elevated Ca2+ activate calcineurin (CaN) to form the Ca2+-CaN
  complex. This complex promotes NFAT3 dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation,
  thereby activating hypertrophy-associated gene expression and ultimately leading
  to cardiac hypertrophy
