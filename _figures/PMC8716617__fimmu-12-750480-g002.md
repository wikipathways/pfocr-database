caption: Role of PANX1 channels in mesenchymal cell migration. Intracellular regulation
  of PANX1 channels during migration of mesenchymal non-immune cells is described
  as a positive or negative regulation, here we summarize the positive regulation.
  (1) Increased cell migration is correlated with PANX1 overexpression via activation
  of ERK1/2 pathway, which could also play a major role during collective cell migration
  (not included in this figure). (2) Thy1/CD90, a surface protein expressed in normal
  cells, but overexpressed in certain pathologies, interacts with αVβ3-containing
  integrin and Syndecan 4, which promotes cell migration. The downstream signaling
  involves focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation, PI3K, PLCγ and IP3 production,
  leading to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, and opening of both CX43 and
  PANX1 channels. The latter promotes extracellular ATP release and subsequent P2X7
  activation, Ca2+ influx and PKCα activation leading to Rac1 activation and RhoA
  inhibition. (3) Mechanical deformation during transepithelial migration lead to
  PANX1 channel activation, releasing ATP and activation of P2X7 receptors, leading
  to cell death by caspase 3/7 activation. Alternatively, PANX1 mutations that change
  its function lead to P2Y activation, preventing caspase activation and cell death.
