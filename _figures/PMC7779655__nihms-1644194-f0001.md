caption: The transport of Cu(I) (black circles) into the cytoplasm occurs via the
  CTR1 copper importer, which is located at the plasma membrane and within endosomal
  compartments. The uptake of Cu(I) via CTR1 is thought to depend on the reduction
  of Cu(II) to Cu(I) by members of the STEAP family of metalloreductases. The oligomerization
  of CTR1 and another SLC31 protein, CTR2, facilitates the cleavage of the CTR1 ectodomain
  by cathepsin L to enhance Cu(I) transport from endosomal compartments into the cytoplasm.
  Cytoplasmic Cu(I) is bound to glutathione (GSH) and can be transferred to metallochaperones
  for targeted trafficking to proteins. The CCS metallochaperone is required for insertion
  of Cu(I) into apo-SOD1 in both the cytoplasm and the mitochondrial intermembrane
  space. The metalation of cuproenzymes within the secretory pathway occurs via ATOX1-mediated
  Cu(I) delivery to the P-type ATPases, ATP7A or ATP7B, which are located in the trans-Golgi
  network (TGN) and facilitate Cu(I) loading into this organelle. Cu(I) transport
  into the mitochondrial matrix is facilitated by SLC25A3 located within the inner
  membrane. The metalation of COX occurs within the intermembrane space of the mitochondria
  and requires copper to be exported from the matrix via an unknown transporter. COX
  metalation and maturation requires the metallochaperones COX17, SCO1 and COX11,
  and other assembly / redox control factors. Protective mechanisms of Cu tolerance
  include sequestration by metallothioneins (MTs) as well as Cu(I)-stimulated trafficking
  of copper transporters, including the endocytosis and degradation of CTR1 which
  reduces Cu(I) import and exocytic trafficking of ATP7A and ATP7B to post-Golgi vesicles
  and the plasma membrane to facilitate copper export from the cell.
