caption: Regulation of spermatogenesis processes by non-classical testosterone signalling.
  The non-classical signalling pathway resulting in Src, ERK and CREB activation is
  shown for a stage VII–VIII seminiferous tubule cross section. (1) FSH-mediated increases
  in cAMP and PKA activity result in blocking of the non-classical testosterone signalling
  pathway at the Raf kinase step so that p-ERK levels would be restricted except for
  stages VII–VIII when FSHR levels are lowest and AR expression is highest in the
  Sertoli cell. (2) ERK activation contributes to testosterone-mediated Sertoli–germ
  cell adhesion and ERK activation may be particularly important during stages VII–VIII
  to remodel the connections between Sertoli cells and spermatids as they begin to
  elongate. (3) Testosterone entering the Sertoli cell from the interstitial space
  or the tubule lumen acts through Src kinase to promote the release of mature sperm
  from the Sertoli ES, most probably by Src phosphorylation of adaptor proteins (filled
  round circles) that anchor the cell–cell adhesion proteins (represented by lines
  extending from Sertoli cell to mature sperm) to actin filaments.
