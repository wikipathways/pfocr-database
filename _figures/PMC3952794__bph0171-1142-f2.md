caption: CaSR-mediated control of ion transport across the thick ascending limb. On
  the basolateral membrane of cells in the cortical thick ascending limb (cTAL), Ca2+o-induced
  suppression of transepithelial Ca2+ transport is dependent on PLA2-mediated inhibition
  of renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channels (Wang et al., ; Huang et al.,
  ; Cha et al., ), which contributes to enhanced urinary excretion of Na+, Ca2+ and
  Mg2+. In addition, Ca2+o suppresses transcellular Na+ and Cl− re-absorption secondary
  to Gi/o-mediated inhibition of PTH- and vasopressin-stimulated cAMP production (de
  Jesus Ferreira et al., ; for review, see Gamba and Friedman, ). Blockade of K+ recycling
  across the luminal membrane and impaired NaCl reabsorption induce an attendant reduction
  in the lumen positive transepithelial potential that drives Ca2+o re-absorption.
  In consequence, paracellular transport of Ca2+ (and Mg2+) is impaired resulting
  in enhanced urinary excretion. In addition to this acute mechanism for Ca2+o-dependent
  inhibition of Ca2+ re-absorption, the CaSR has recently been reported to up-regulate
  the expression of claudin-14, a key inhibitor of a claudin-16/19-dependent divalent
  cation selective paracellular pathway in the thick ascending limb (Gong et al.,
  ).

  description: CaSR-mediated control of ion transport across the thick ascending limb.
    On the basolateral membrane of cells in the cortical thick ascending limb (cTAL),
    Ca2+o-induced suppression of transepithelial Ca2+ transport is dependent on PLA2-mediated
    inhibition of renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channels (Wang et al., ;
    Huang et al., ; Cha et al., ), which contributes to enhanced urinary excretion

    re-absorption secondary to Gi/o-mediated inhibition of PTH- and vasopressin-stimulated
    cAMP production (de Jesus Ferreira et al., ; for review, see Gamba and Friedman,

    induce an attendant reduction in the lumen positive transepithelial potential
    that drives Ca2+o re-absorption. In consequence, paracellular transport of Ca2+
    (and Mg2+) is impaired resulting in enhanced urinary excretion. In addition to
