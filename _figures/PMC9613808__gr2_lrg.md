caption: Host proteome targets involved in COVID-19 hyperimmune and their inhibitors.
  Cartoon representation of molecular components involved in hyperimmune reaction
  leading to the severe clinical presentation (ARDS) among COVID-19 patients. The
  lung fibrosis observed in COVID-19 patients and resulting hypoxia is the main reason
  for mortality in severe cases along with immunosuppressed conditions and concomitant
  infections. Classic pathways are hijacked in COVID-19-associated lung fibrosis by
  various proteins coded by SARS-CoV-2. In COVID-19 patients due to inflammation mediators
  such as IL-6 and cytokine storm or increased release from damaged/dying cells, there
  is a loss of lung surface area to fibrosis. There is an aggravation of the infection
  cycle due to hypoxia-induced ACE2, TMPRSS2 overexpression, and furin cell surface
  localization. Multiple immune suppressants and modulators have been effective in
  reducing the severity and mortality as seen in large trials. However, the mechanism
  for which is still not well established. There are many other agents known to modulate
  many members of this cascade, especially the NLRP3 pathway responsible for characteristic
  COVID-19 storm but not yet exploited due to a rather recent elucidation.
