caption: Principles for animal dry eye modeling. A schematic showing approaches to
  developing animal dry eye models, including major methods used in recently published
  studies, as described in this review. Lacrimal glands excision, neural pathway blocking,
  and autoimmune disease models, including Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus,
  have been developed by targeting the lacrimal gland. These result in an aqueous
  deficiency in the tear film. Conjunctival goblet cell damage can result in mucin
  deficiency in the tear film. Further, chemicals, drugs, and radiation hazards mainly
  cause corneal epithelium damage. Some gene-modified mice can present with dysfunction
  or direct damage of the Meibomian glands, resulting in lipid deficiency in the tear
  film. Environmental stress due to changing humidity, controlling airflow, and/or
  introduction of air pollution particulate matter, could also be significant in animal
  dry eye modeling.
