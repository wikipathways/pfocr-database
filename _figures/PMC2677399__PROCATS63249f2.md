caption: Overview of NF-κB activation pathways. In the canonical NF-κB activation
  pathway, which is stimulated by ligands such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS), and interleukin (IL)-1β, IKKβ is responsible for the phosphorylation of IκBα,
  leading to its subsequent ubiquitination and degradation through the proteasome
  pathway. This allows for translocation of RelA/p50 to the nucleus, and the subsequent
  activation of transcription of genes important in innate immunity and protection
  from apoptosis. In the noncanonical (alternative) NF-κB activation pathway, which
  is activated through ligands such as lymphotoxin β (LTB), B cell–activating factor
  (BAFF), and CD40 ligand (CD40L), among others, NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK)-dependent
  activation of IKKα leads to phoshorylation of p100, subsequent ubiquitination, and
  proteolytic processing to p52. This results in nuclear translocation of p52/RelB
  complexes, and activation of distinct transcriptional programs. For illustrative
  purposes, this is a simplified overview. Additional phosphorylation events are induced
  by IKK proteins, notably the phosphorylation of histone H3, CREB-binding protein,
  and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor by IKKα. Additional
  post-translational modifications of NF-κB members that include phosphorylation,
  ubiquitination and acetylation, function of transcriptional co-activators and repressors,
  and chromatin remodeling events are collectively important to shape the nature,
  strength, and duration of the NF-κB transcriptional response. While the canonical
  and noncanonical pathways are drawn separately for illustrative purposes, we point
  out that these pathways do not act independently. Both cooperative and inhibitory
  roles in reciprocal regulation have been reported, indicated by arrows (see References  and  for
  recent reviews).
