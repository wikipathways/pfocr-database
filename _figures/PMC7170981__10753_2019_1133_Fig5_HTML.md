caption: 'Evaluation of genes regulated by butyrate in controls and patients with
  UC. Gene expression was analyzed using PCR arrays for genes involved in antibacterial
  response and innate and adaptive immune responses in sigmoidal biopsies; data was
  logarithm transformed, mean values for significantly regulated genes were back transformed,
  and Log2 fold changes (FC) were calculated between butyrate 1.6 mM and none for
  each gene in controls (n = 8) and patients with UC (n = 8). a Heatmap displaying
  changes in biopsy gene expression by 1.6 mM butyrate. FC are displayed as colors
  ranging from blue (down-regulation) to red (up-regulation) as shown in the key and
  columns are clustered using correlation distance. Non-significant regulations are
  shown in white. b Visual representation of the analyzed genes in prediction of the

  with UC (right). Up-regulated genes are shown in red, down-regulated genes in green,
  and detected but not significantly regulated genes in gray. The intensity of the
  color in a node indicates the degree of up- or down-regulation. Orange lines and
  nodes indicate predicted up-regulation, whereas blue lines and nodes indicate predicted
  down-regulation. The intensity of the color in a node indicates the degree of predicted
  up- or down-regulation. Broken edge lines indicate indirect relationship. The shapes
  of the nodes reflect the functional class of each gene product: transcriptional
  regulator (horizontal ellipse), transmembrane receptor (vertical ellipse), enzyme
  (rhombus), cytokine/growth factor (square), kinase (triangle), and complex/group/other
  (circle).'
