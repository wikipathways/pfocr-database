caption: 'Predicted DTDP degradation and PMP production pathway. (A) Inherent DTDP
  degradation pathway of A. mimigardefordensis. (B) DTDP-to-PMP conversion pathway
  in the engineered strain. The double box indicates the A. mimigardefordensis cell.
  The deletion of mdo is indicated with a bold X. Dashed arrows across the periplast
  indicate transmembrane transport of relevant molecules. The bold arrow indicates
  the overexpression of phaCAm in plasmid pBBR1MCS5:: phaCAm. All reactions catalyzed
  by enzymes are numbered. Bold A, B, and C indicate three important manipulations
  for improved PMP production. The detailed genetic operations of these three steps
  are given at the bottom. The buk-ptb operon originates from C. acetobutylicum and
  is regulated under its native promoter. Other genes in this figure originate from
  A. mimigardefordensis DPN7 and are regulated under their own promoters. 3MP, 3-mercaptopropionic
  acid; DTDP, 3,3′-dithiodipropionic acid; 3SP, 3-sulfinopropionic acid; lpdA, disulfide
  reductase; mdo, thiol dioxygenase; sucCD, succinyl-CoA synthetase; caiA, acyl-CoA
  dehydrogenase; buk, butyrate kinase; ptb, phosphotransbutyrylase; phaCAm, poly(hydroxyalkanoic
  acid) synthase; caiB, acyl-CoA transferase; ahpD, alkylhydroperoxidase; rdgC, recombination-associated
  protein; recA, recombination protein; recX, recombination regulator protein; cfa,
  cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase; phaB, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase;
  phaR, polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis repressor protein; PphaCAm, native promoter
