caption: Dietary DHA is absorbed mostly as TAG in the chylomicrons (CM), which pass
  through adipose tissue, heart, and muscle, before entering the liver as CM remnants.
  Free DHA released from CM remnants is incorporated into sn-2 position of PC by the
  Kennedy pathway. Part of the PC-DHA is hydrolyzed by HL, to generate LPC-DHA, which
  is secreted into plasma, bound to serum albumin, and taken by the brain through
  the Mfsd2a pathway. In addition to HL, EL may also generate LPC-DHA to some extent
  in the plasma, especially at the blood brain barrier. Under inflammatory conditions,
  the relative contribution of EL may be increased because HL is down-regulated during
  inflammation [], whereas EL is up-regulated [, ]. HL activity may also be decreased
  in carriers of apo E4, leading to decreased transport of DHA into the brain. This
  might contribute to the increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease in apo E4 carriers.
