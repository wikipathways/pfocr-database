caption: Simplified metabolic pathway used in calculations. In this paper, the objective
  is to estimate the flux of molecules escaping the photorespiratory recycling—that
  is, ε values (εGly, εSer and εGat). The oxygenation rate is denoted as vo. Glycine,
  serine and glycerate are subdivided into two pools—one metabolically active pool
  of constant size, and a slow “inactive” pool of increasing size (due to build-up).
  Since the leaf pool of glyoxylate is very small (undetectable by 13C NMR), it is
  assumed that it does not accumulate and is turned over rapidly so that its 13C enrichment
  is 100%. HP, hydroxypyruvate; PGA, glycerate 3-phosphate.
