caption: 'The prostaglandin biosynthetic pathway (adapted from []) 15-deoxyΔ12-14-PGJ2
  is a metabolite derived from arachidonic acid. Several GSTs are implicated in the
  regulation of its formation: GSTS1 metabolized PGH2 in PGD2; GSTA1, GSTM1, and GSTP1
  conjugated GSH to PGJ2 and 15-deoxyΔ12-14-PGJ2. This conjugation led to the regulation
  of various transcription factors (PPARγ, NF-κB, and Nrf2).'
