caption: 'a Organization of the anisomycin biosynthesis operon and impact of SsoPox
  W263I on the anisomycin biosynthetic pathway. In operon representation, arrows indicate
  the direction of transcription. Pathway and nomenclature are from Zheng et al. Proteins
  (dashed line boxes) and metabolites (full-line boxes) normalized scaled intensities
  (NSI) are represented as the mean and standard deviations (metabolomic: n = 3 biological
  replicates, proteomic: n = 8, 4 biological replicates × 2 technical replicates).
