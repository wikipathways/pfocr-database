caption: The main cholesterol synthesis pathway is highlighted in grey. The impact
  of statin inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting step of cholesterol
  synthesis, is shown. Statins limit production of cholesterol and isoprenoid intermediates
  (FPP, GGPP). The latter are responsible for post-translational modification of a
  number of proteins including those of the small G protein family (Ras, Rho, Rac).
  The potential roles of isoprenoid- and cholesterol-dependent changes in modulating
  cardiac myocyte function are listed. From the present study, bold text indicates
  established effects, whereas grey text denotes effects which have been eliminated.
  ROS reactive oxygen species (which reduce bioavailable NO); PP phosphatase; AC adenylyl
  cyclase. See  for detailed mechanisms and references.
