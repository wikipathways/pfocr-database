caption: a Among P2X receptors, the P2X7 is highlighted within the context of BC.
  This receptor has a low affinity for ATP, requiring high concentrations of this
  molecule (such as those found in the TME) for its activation. When the interaction
  between ATP and P2X7 occurs quickly, there is the formation of the macropore that
  allows a selective passage of ions, with an influx of Na+ and Ca2+, and an efflux
  of K+. This passage of ions leads to the activation of signaling pathways such as
  AKT, which promotes increased levels of MMPs and decreased expression of E-cadherin,
  both of which are related to increased migration and invasiveness of the tumor.
  On the other hand, when the interaction between ATP and P2X7 becomes prolonged,
  there is a loss of channel selectivity, leading to a significant increase in intracellular
  Ca2+ levels. Under these conditions, there will be the activation of apoptotic and
  necrotic pathways. Ca2+ will promote the activation of calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinase II (CaMKII), which in turn will activate the mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore (MPTP), leading to the release of caspase-1, which is related to the necrotic
  process. Also, Ca2+ will also lead to the activation of caspase-3, related to the
  cell’s apoptotic pathway. Both caspases will promote cell death. It should be noted
  that one of the activities developed by ivermectin is to increase the sensitivity
  of P2X7 to ATP, causing a prolonged activation of this receptor to occur, thus activating
  the cell death pathways, favoring the control of tumor growth. b Among the P2Y family,
  the receptor that has a great correlation with BC is P2Y2. This receptor is found
  highly expressed in the cells that make up the edges of the tumor, and when activated
  by ATP, it promotes an increase in the Snail molecule that controls the expression
  of genes related to invasion and metastasis, and a decrease in E-cadherin. Such
  conditions favor the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Furthermore, the activation
  of P2Y2 promotes an increase in β-catenin, which in turn leads to an increase in
  the levels of the molecules c-Myc, cyclin D1, and CD44, all of them related to the
  control and progression of the cell cycle. Thus, P2Y2, in addition to promoting
  invasion and metastasis, also promotes the proliferation of BC cells
