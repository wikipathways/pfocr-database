caption: (A) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the 86 proteins in the dataset that
  were found to be significantly differentially expressed between the bulk/undifferentiated
  HC and OP samples. Some of the identified proteins (highlighted in pink) were shown
  to have cellular involvements in signaling network pathway interactions. In the
  core of the network (in red), interactions of MAPK, ERK 1/2, PI3K, and integrin
  connected to osteopathogenesis were identified. Proteins in grey and white colors
  represent molecules from the IPA database that make up the network. (B) Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA) of 196 proteins with marked expression changes between undifferentiated,
  osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiated MSSCs in both OP and HC cells. Some
  of these proteins (highlighted in pink, as described above) were implicated in different
  signaling networks involving bone and connective tissue disorders. The network analysis
  was generated through the use of IPA (QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com.
