caption: Network of the glutathione metabolism pathway. The location of the node is
  metabolites and the substances on the line are genes. Metabolites and genes in italics
  were not detected. Some of them that were unaffected by HS have been omitted from
  this graph. The red numbers represent the |log2fold change| of genes or metabolites
  for control and HS in 17CL30, while the blue number represents the |log2fold change|
  of genes or metabolites for control and HS in 05S180.
