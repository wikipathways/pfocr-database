caption: Hypothetical model depicting a potential role of SMAD3 activation in GCT
  development. In this model, we hypothesize that SMAD3 activation may serve as a
  converging point of dysregulated TGFB superfamily signaling and genetic aberrations,
  and play an important role in GCT development. Activin and TGFB-induced signaling
  converges on SMAD3 and promotes ovarian tumorigenesis, as is supported by studies
  using genetically modified mouse models, including Inha−/− [, ], Inha−/−; Smad3−/−
  [], Smad1/5 conditional knockout [], Bmpr1a/Bmpr1b conditional knockout [], and
  TGFBR1-CAAcre mice []. The activity of activins is regulated by follistatin and
  inhibins (i.e., negative modulators) and TGFBR3, an inhibin-binding protein that
  promotes the antagonism of activins by inhibins. BMP pathway suppresses GCT development
  at least partially through influencing SMAD3 activation. FOXL2, a key regulator
  of granulosa cell differentiation, may inhibit SMAD3 activation through inducing
  follistatin production and differentially modulating the expression of activin and
  BMP signaling components [–]. FOXO1/3 and PTEN seem to negatively impact SMAD2/3
  activation and GCT formation []. Additionally, it is postulated that molecules/pathways
  that influence TGFB signaling activity, particularly those interacting with SMAD3,
  are potential regulators of GCT development. Such candidates include, but are not
  limited to, TAZ/YAP, TRIB3, GATA4, WNT, and Notch [, , , , ]. Their specific roles
  and interactions with TGFB signaling in the pathogenesis of GCTs have yet to be
  experimentally tested. This model does not exclude potential contributions of dysregulated
  signaling events upstream or downstream of SMAD3, SMAD-independent signaling mechanisms,
  and other signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of GCTs.
