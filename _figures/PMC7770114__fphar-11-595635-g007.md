caption: 'The chronic administration of l-DOPA leads to a sensitization of D1 receptors,
  which maintain the over-activation of PKA in LIDs. PKA regulates the pathway that
  activates DARPP-32, which inhibits the modification by PP-1, of ERK1/2 signaling,
  which acts on nuclear targets, such as MSK1, and, along with histone H3, regulates
  the expression of early genes such as c-fos and zif268. CBD exerts antidyskinetic
  effects by increasing AEA concentration by inhibiting of FAAH, thus stimulating
  the CB1 receptors, which decrease PKA activity. The CB1 requiere the co-administration
  of a TRPV1 inhibitor (CPZ), because they stimulate TRPV1 via AEA and CBD, both of
  which generate opposite effects to the activation of CB1. Furthermore, increased
  OEA is generated via the inhibition of FAAH, an endocannabinoid able to block TRPV1
  and stimulate PPARσ receptors, reducing biochemical markers such as FosB and pAcH3.
  In addition, CBD activate the 5-HT1A receptor, a receptor that had previously only
  been implicated in the anticataleptic effect of CBD. By activating PPARγ receptors,
  CBD reduces the levels of molecular markers involved in LIDs, such as pERK, pAcH3,
  NF-Kβ and COX-2, while it also generates an anti-inflammatory effect by stimulating
  said receptors, which are present in the glia. Furthermore, CBD is able to reduce
  oxidative damage, decreasing the production of ROS by increasing the activity of
  mitochondrial complexes. The inverse agonism that CBD exerts on GPR6 could form
  part of its antidyskinetic mechanisms. Abbreviations: l-DOPA, L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine;
