caption: Schematic diagram for the role of CAFs in CCA cell resistance to gemcitabine
  and the presence of IL-6R blockage by tocilizumab. (A) CAFs secreted IL-6 to induce
  IL-6R/STAT3 signaling and upregulated the expression of proteins involved in the
  cell survival mechanism in CCA cells. (B) Blocking the IL-6-IL-6R binding in CCA
  cells by tocilizumab inhibited CAF-CCA interaction overcame the gemcitabine resistance
  and induced CCA cell death.
