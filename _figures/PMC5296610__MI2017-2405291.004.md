caption: The most significantly relevant pathways and highly linked molecules relevant
  to the merged bionetwork. In the network, molecules are represented as nodes, and
  the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as a line. Red symbols
  represent upregulated DEGs; green symbols represent downregulated DEGs. Yellow symbols
  indicate the highly linked molecules and signaling pathways from the Ingenuity Knowledge
  Database. “CP” is an abbreviation of “canonical pathway,” which represents signaling
  pathways related to the merged bionetwork. Solid lines between molecules show a
  direct physical relationship between molecules, whereas dash lines show indirect
  functional relationships.
