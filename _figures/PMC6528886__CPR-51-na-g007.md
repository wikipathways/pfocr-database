caption: Schematic diagram of the targets for DMOG. LPS promoted the activation of
  PI3K/AKT, NF‐κB and MAPK signalling pathway via TLR4/MyD88‐dependent manner to upregulate
  proinflammatory cytokine expression. Our study demonstrated that DMOG inhibited
  LPS‐upregulated TLR4 and MyD88 expression and subsequently suppressed the phosphorylation
  and degradation of IκBα. Afterwards, the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation
  of NF‐κB p65 were reduced. Moreover, DMOG inhibited AKT phosphorylation, which might
  interact with IKKs, the upstream kinase of NF‐κB. Likewise, the activation of MAPK
  which was also implicated in LPS‐induced inflammation was downregulated by DMOG.
  Consequently, LPS‐upregulated inflammatory cytokine expression was attenuated. LPS,
  lipopolysaccharide; TLR4, Toll‐like receptor 4; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary
