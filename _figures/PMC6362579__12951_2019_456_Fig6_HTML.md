caption: Overview of SiNPs-induced apoptotic and necrotic cell death pathways independently
  in HUVECs. The 20-nm SiNP exposed to the membrane of endothelial cells, leading
  to intracellular ROS level. NADPH oxidase (NOX), a non-mitochondrial source of ROS
  increase, generates superoxide anions through oxygen reduction mediated by the electron
  donor NADPH. NOX-derived ROS contribute ER stress and activate unfolded protein
  response (UPR), resulting that IRE1α dissociated from BiP responses the unfolded
  proteins. Subsequently, the resultant trans-autophosphorylation induce apoptotic
  cell death. In addition, 20-nm SiNP induce autophagy activation, independent of
  ROS, via PI3K/AKT/eNOS/nitric oxide signaling pathway. Under the induction of autophagy,
  RIP1 interacts with RIP3 to form complex Iib, which is involved in necroptosis.
  As a result, autophagy induced by 20-nm SiNP causes necrotic cell death
