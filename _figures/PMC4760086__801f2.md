caption: Inflammation in SCD. SCD has been recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease.
  Multiple cell types and molecules are involved in its inflammatory pathways. Hemolysis
  of RBCs leads to the release of heme into the circulation, which can activate endothelial
  cells through the TLR4 pathway and induce PlGF release from RBCs. PlGF activates
  monocytes, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β.
  The adhesion of platelets or sickle RBCs can also activate endothelial cells, producing
  increased expression of adhesion molecules including ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P-selectin,
  and E-selectin, and thus promoting the recruitment of neutrophils. iNKT cells exhibit
  an activated phenotype and contribute to pulmonary dysfunction in SCD by producing
  IFN-γ and inducing CXCR3 chemokines. Platelets can form aggregates with circulating
  leukocytes, including neutrophils and monocytes. Activated neutrophils roll and
  adhere to the endothelium, and initiate VOC by capturing sickle RBCs. Heme can also
  induce NET formation, which promotes acute pulmonary injury in SCD. HMGB1, high
  mobility group box 1; iNKT cell, invariant natural killer T cell.
