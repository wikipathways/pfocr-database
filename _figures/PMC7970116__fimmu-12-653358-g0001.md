caption: Potential mechanisms influencing immunotherapy response in the TIME in ccRCC.
  (A) The anti-tumor activity of cytokine (IL-2) therapies was primarily mediated
  by driving the proliferation and activation of NK cells and CD8+ TILs. (B) Resistance
  to cytokine (IL-2) therapies was correlated with the amplification of Tregs level
  mediated by IL-2 and NK cell dysfunction. IL-6, TGF-β, PGE2, and IDO, as well as
  lactate and adenosine generated under hypoxic conditions, inhibit the cytotoxic
  effects of NK cells. (C) The anti-tumor mechanisms of immune checkpoint inhibitors
  that contribute to the reactivation of CD8+ T cells were mediated by blocking the
  PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4/CD28 pathways. (D) Resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors
  is mainly mediated by CD8+ TILs anergy, which abundantly express immunosuppressive
  molecules (e.g., PD-1, CTLA-4, Tim-3, and LAG-3). Tregs and M2-like TAMs secrete
  IL-10 and TGF-β, which inhibit the cytotoxicity of CD8+ TILs and recruit Tregs.
  Tregs present a stronger immunosuppressive capacity under the action of PD-1 inhibitors.
  Ligands expressed on M2-like TAMs (including PD-L1/L2, CD80/86, and VISTA) can also
  promote exhaustion of CD8+ TILs. NO, ROS, and Arg-1 produced by MDSCs inhibit the
  anti-tumor immune function of CD8+ TILs, and promote differentiation into M2-like
  TAMs. Regulatory DCs can also inhibit CD8+ T-cell function via the L-arginine metabolic
  pathway and promote Tregs proliferation.
