caption: 'Mechanism of action of romosozumab.Notes: Romosozumab is a human monoclonal
  antibody that binds sclerostin (an inhibitor of Wnt pathway signaling). When this
  monoclonal antibody binds to sclerostin, sclerostin cannot bind to the LRP-5 and
  LRP-6 receptors and is unable to exert its inhibitory effect. Wnt binds to LRP-5
  or LRP-6 coreceptors and specific Frizzled family receptor, leading to activation
  of the Wnt signaling pathway and bone formation. Copyright ©2015. Dove Medical Press.
