caption: Potential role for AstC-R2 in nociceptor-bacterial-immune interactions in
  Drosophila. Upon bacterial infection by a Gram-negative pathogen, the IMD pathway
  is activated by DAP-type peptidoglycan, NF- κB is activated and translocates to
  the nucleus, and transcription of effector antimicrobial peptide-encoding genes
  related to this pathway (CecA1) occurs. Simultaneously, TRPA1 channels open by direct
  interaction with bacterial LPS or N-formyl peptides leading to nociceptive neuron
  firing and the subsequent release of Allatostatin C. In turn, Allatostatin C inhibits
  the IMD pathway as well as heat driven nociception through binding to AstC-R2 on
  the fat-body cells and nociceptors respectively, thus completing a negative regulatory
  circuit controlling IMD activation. Figure was modified from images from Servier
