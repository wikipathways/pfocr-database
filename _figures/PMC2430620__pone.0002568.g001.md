caption: Upon entry into enterocytes sulforaphane (SF) is rapidly conjugated to glutathione,
  exported into the systemic circulation and metabolized through the mercapturic acid
  pathway. Within the low glutathione environment of the plasma the SF-glutathione
  conjugate may be cleaved, possibly mediated by GSTM1, leading to circulation of
  free SF in the plasma. This free SF can modify plasma proteins including signalling
  molecules, such as TGFβ, EGF and insulin.
