caption: In the PD environment, the interaction between FGF1 secreted by oligodendrocytes
  and FGF9 in the SN with FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 receptors on astrocytes is weakened,
  which may reduce their ability to protect neurons from oxidative damage. Therefore,
  ferroptosis in the midbrain SN primarily occurs in astrocytes under the dysregulation
  of oligodendrocytes, subsequently leading to neuronal ferroptosis. The significant
  accumulation of ROS released by astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, the substantial
  buildup of iron ions in the SN, and the marked reduction of antioxidant factors
  NRF2/SLC7A11/GPX4 may be specific pathways leading to the substantial decrease in
  SN dopaminergic neurons
