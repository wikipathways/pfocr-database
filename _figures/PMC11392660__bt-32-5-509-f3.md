caption: The immunologic mechanisms following decellularized matrix transplantation
  involve several crucial steps. (i) During the immune recognition phase, Toll-like
  receptor 4 (TLR4) primarily recognizes membrane components of microorganisms, while
  TLR9 recognizes nucleic acids from pathogens or disease conditions. Both receptors
  utilize the adaptor protein MYD88 for intracellular signaling and upregulate the
  expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to facilitate antigen
  recognition and processing. (ii) The T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex specifically
  recognizes MHC molecules, providing the “first signal” of the dual signals required
  for initiating T-cell activation, which results in a regulated immune response.
  (iii) The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/SMAD signaling pathway is a key regulator
  of decellularized matrix-mediated ECM deposition. Recent studies suggest that miR-29a-3p
  may improve transplantation outcomes by modulating the TGF-β pathway
