caption: 'Human placental chorionic villus showing the different trophoblast subtypes:
  vCTB, STB, and EVTs in the maternal decidua, the latter arising from differentiation
  of vCTB through the cell column. Each placental trophoblast subcompartment expresses
  different combinations of the TEAD family members and their transcriptional cofactors,
  YAP1, TAZ, and VGLL family members. This particular spatial expression pattern suggests
  a dynamic exchange of binding partners that likely influences both cell fate and
  function.'
