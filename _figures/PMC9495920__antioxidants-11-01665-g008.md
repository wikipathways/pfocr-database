caption: Proposed schematic of Nrf2 signaling pathway activation through phosphorylation
  of AMPK following spinal cord injury. Following axotomy, synaptic terminals release
  all their neurotransmitters, including glutamate. This glutamate excessively activates
  its receptors (AMPA, NMDA, and Kainate), which leads to glutamate excitotoxicity
  in postsynaptic neurons (here, phrenic motoneurons). Intracellularly, it induces
  an increase in the calcium concentration, leading to increased reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production by mitochondria. These ROS, associated with the increased calcium
  concentration, provoke AMPK phosphorylation. pAMPK then facilitates Nrf2 nucleus
  translocation, leading to an increase in the antioxidant response mediated by Nrf2
  and its effectors (NQO1, HO-1).
