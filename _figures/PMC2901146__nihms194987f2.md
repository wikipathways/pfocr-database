caption: 'Overview of the Taxol biosynthetic pathway. The boxed MEP Pathway is the
  plastidial route from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (via methylerythritol
  phosphate) for C5 (IPP and DMAPP) precursor supply. The abbreviations are: IPP,
  isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; IPPI, isopentenyl diphosphate
  isomerase; GGPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; TS, taxadiene synthase; and
  PAM, phenylalanine aminomutase. OPP denotes the diphosphate moiety; Ac and Bz denote
  acetyl and benzoyl groups, respectively. Because the relative order of C1 hydroxylation
  and oxetane formation is uncertain, the hypothetical intermediate illustrated could
  be at the level of an acylated hexaol rather than a heptaol bearing the C1 hydroxyl.'
