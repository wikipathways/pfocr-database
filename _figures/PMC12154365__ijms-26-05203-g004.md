caption: EBF1-mediated oncogenic mechanisms and regulatory network in BCa. (A) EBF1
  may promote BCa invasiveness and bone metastasis by activating RBP7 and immune-related
  pathways, suggesting a potential role in malignant progression. (B) LINC00663 upregulates
  EBF1, which subsequently activates NR2F1 expression, promoting proliferation, invasion,
  inflammatory response, and angiogenesis in BCa cells. (C) EBF1 activates the oncogenic
  lncRNA TMPO-AS1 and forms a positive feedback loop via miR-98-5p, thereby enhancing
  proliferation, migration, and invasion of BCa cells while inhibiting apoptosis
