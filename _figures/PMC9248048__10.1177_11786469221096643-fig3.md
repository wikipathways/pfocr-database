caption: The effect of kynurenine and its metabolites on atherosclerosis. Inflammation
  and accumulation of oxidized lipoprotein stimulate the expression of IDO in inflammatory
  cells such as macrophages. Increased production of kynurenine accelerates T Reg
  cells differentiation and alleviates local inflammatory response. Kynurenine metabolites,
  particularly 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, can vigorously decrease inflammatory cytokines
  release. In addition, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid prevents the uncontrolled release
  of chemokines and hinders the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the vessel’s
  wall. It has been reported that 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid can attenuate hepatic
  lipogenesis and decrease blood level of LDL by downregulating SREBP-2, HMGCR, and
  ApoB.
