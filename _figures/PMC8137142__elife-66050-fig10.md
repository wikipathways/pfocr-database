caption: (A) A schematic illustrating the mechanism of mRNA multiplexing and its role
  in cell physiology. Gene loci located on different chromosomes undergo allelic coupling
  under different growth conditions to form intergenic associations. Upon transcription,
  intergenic association allows for the mRNAs to assemble into a mRNA ribonucleoprotein
  (mRNP) complex (transperon) that is exported to the cytoplasm and confers mRNA co-localization
  at different organelles (mitochondria, ER, cytoplasm). RNA co-localization and co-translation
  allow for coordination of the pathways responsible for the control of cell physiology.
  (B) mRNA multiplexing and transperon formation control the mating pathway in yeast.
  Yeast (MATa cells, as shown) express mRNAs encoding soluble secreted and membrane
  proteins (e.g., Mfa1, Mfa2, Aga1, Aga2, and Ste2, respectively) from genomic loci
  located on different chromosomes (as listed) that undergo allelic coupling to form
  intergenic associations. Histone H4 paralogs (Hhf1 and -2) are required for the
  mRNAs to assemble into a mating mRNA transperon that is exported to the cytoplasm
  and confers RNA co-localization at the endoplasmic reticulum peripheral to the nucleus
  (nER). Co-translational translocation of these proteins at the ER may coordinate
  the pathways responsible for the cellular responsiveness to pheromone of the opposite
  mating type (i.e., via both Ste2 signaling and Aga1 and Aga2 function in cell adhesion)
  and transmission of the cell’s own mating signal to cells of the opposite mating
  type (i.e., via Mfa1 and Mfa2 secretion).
