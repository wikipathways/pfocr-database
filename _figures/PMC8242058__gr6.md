caption: 'Regulatory mechanism of ER stress, apoptosis and oxidative stress in articular
  cartilage of broilers with spontaneous FHN. When broilers were stimulated by external
  environment, ER stress was activated, and through IRE1-α, ATF-6 and PERK pathways
  regulate UPR to maintain cell homeostasis. However, a series of reactions may occur,
  such as activating Nrf-2/ARE pathway through PERK to exert antioxidant function,
  or inducing autophagy or even apoptosis, may occur when the duration or degree of
  ER stress reaches the limit of cellular adaptive. Abbreviations: ATF-6, activating
  transcription factor-6; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FHN, Femoral head necrosis; IRE1-α,
  inositol requiring protein; PERK, protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase; UPR, unfolded
  protein response.'
