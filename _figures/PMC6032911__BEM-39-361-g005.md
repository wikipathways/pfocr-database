caption: Schematic representation of gene expression patterns in A. thaliana leaves
  and floral meristem under near‐null magnetic field (NNMF). Leaf gene regulation
  of clock, photoperiod pathway, vernalization pathway, gibberellin pathway, and regulatory
  network is depicted during early, intermediate, and late stages of flowering according
  to data of Table . An early downregulation of clock, photoperiod, gibberellin, and
  vernalization pathways is accompanied by a downregulation of AP1 and GA20ox. In
  the floral meristem (data from Table ), NNMF determines an early downregulation
  of the gibberellin pathway, AGL24 and AP1, with a significant upregulation of LFY,
  FD, and SVP. In both leaves and floral meristem data, upregulation is shown in green,
  downregulation in light red, and no regulation in white [Fornara et al., ; Jaeger
  et al., ; Valentim et al., ].
