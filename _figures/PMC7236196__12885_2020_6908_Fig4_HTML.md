caption: Metabolomics pathway network map of significantly altered metabolites in
  prostate cancer compared to benign prostate and additionally high Gleason score
  compared to low Gleason score. Metabolites significantly increased in PC are marked
  on red, significantly decreased in PC are marked on blue. Metabolites significantly
  increased and decreased in Gleason score ≥ 7 compared to Gleason score = 6 are represented
  by red and blue arrows, respectively
