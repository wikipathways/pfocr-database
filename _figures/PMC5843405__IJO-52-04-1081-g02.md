caption: The role of SUMOylation in representative cancer pathways. (a) SUMOylation
  in the NF-кB signaling pathway. SUMOylation and de-modification of NF-кB essential
  modifier (NEMO) proteins are observed both in the cytoplasm and nucleus at steps
  in this pathway. SUMOylation can positively or negatively regulate NF-кB activation.
  (b) SUMOylation in the JAK-STAT pathway. SUMOylation of STATs can inhibit phosphorylation
  and repress target gene expression activated by growth factors. (c) SUMOylation
  in the TGF-β pathway. SUMOylation exerts both promoting and suppressive effects
  on target gene expression through the regulation of SMADs.
