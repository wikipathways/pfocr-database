caption: IL-6, Epo, or growth factors bind their receptors on endothelial cells and
  induce a tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation cascade, which involves activation of receptor-associated
  Janus kinase family tyrosine kinases (Jak/Tyk) by cross-phosphorylation. STAT3 phosphorylation,
  homodimerization and/or heterodimerization (with STAT1) and translocation to the
  nucleus, is followed by binding to DNA elements to activate transcription of genes
  that promote angiogenesis and cell survival, such as vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF) and HIF-1α. Serine (Ser) phosphorylation of STAT 3 appears to be required
  for its action in mitochondria. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) bind to bone
  morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPRII), and induce growth arrest through
  intracellular signaling pathways of the Smad proteins, which act in part through
  interaction with, and inactivation of, STAT3. GAS, γ-activated site; SIE, cis-inducible
  element.
