caption: BYF alleviates COPD symptoms by promoting the expression of pro-inflammatory
  factors and suppressing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. BYF induces
  T naïve cells towards Tregs, producing IL-10, by up-regulating the FOXP3 expression
  via STAT5 pathway, while it inhibits the differentiation of Th17 cells, producing
  IL-17A, by down-regulating the RORγt gene via STAT3 pathway. Meanwhile, BYF also
  decrease the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α,
  which could alleviate the inflammation development of COPD.
