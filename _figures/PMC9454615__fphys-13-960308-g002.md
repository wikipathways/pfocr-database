caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrating the dual regulation of HIF. At high O2 concentration,
  HIF-1α is hydroxylated on proline by the prolyl hydroxylase PHD. The ubiquitin ligase
  VHL targets HIV-1α-OH for polyubiquitinylation and proteosomal degradation. Similarly,
  hydroxylation of TRP by PHD and asparaginyl hydroxylase FIH targets TRP-OH for ubiquitinylation
  and proteosomal degradation contributing to homeostasis. Under hypoxia, HIF-1α translocates
  to the cell nucleus where it forms heterodimers with the HIF-β subunit and binds
  to the HRE element (the HRE core binding site sequence is 5''-RCGTG-3'' with R being
  a purine) in the promoter of hypoxia-inducible genes and recruits histone acetyltransferases
  CREB Binding Protein (CBP)/p300. Hypoxia up-regulates ACE1 which contributes to
  Ang II production through the RAS pathway. Ang II can contribute to hypoxia through
  binding to AT1R which initiates signaling events including activation of PKC and
  c-Src that is required for superoxide production by NADPH oxidases (NOX1 and NOX2).
  NOX2 also stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria.
  HIF-1α nuclear translocation also activates the transient receptor potential ankyrin
  1 (TRPA1) gene expression which leads to increase in intracellular Ca2+ and cell
  injury. In parallel (not shown), Ang II triggers an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+
  that induces NOX5 to generate H2O2. The Kelch-like erythroid cell-derived protein
  (KEAP1) is a negative regulator of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like
  2 (Nrf2). Under hypoxia, KEAP1 is oxidated by ROS. This leads to the nuclear translocation
  of phosphorylated Nrf2 which maintains oxidative homeostasis in regulating PHD thereby
  promoting HIF-1α proteasomal degradation. The Nrf2/MAF (MAF BZIP transcription factor)
  heterodimers also induce transcription of anti-oxidant-response genes through binding
  to the antioxidant response element (ARE sequence: 5''-TGACNNNGC-3'') and reduce
  both the concentration of ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, chronic
  hypoxia triggers HIF-dependent down regulation of the ACE2 gene and activation of
  ADAM17 which leads to cleavage of the ACE2 protein (not shown).'
