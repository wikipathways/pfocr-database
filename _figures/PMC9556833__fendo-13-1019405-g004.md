caption: Coordinated regulation of distinct physiologic effects. Insulin signals through
  at least two signaling cascades to mobilize GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs). One involves
  Akt and the RabGAPs, Tbc1D4 and Tbc1D1, which regulate distinct Rab proteins on
  the GSVs (and on other membranes, such as endosomes). A second pathway involves
  the Rho family GTPase TC10α, which is coupled through its effector PIST to the TUG
  protease, Usp25m. Insulin stimulates TUG endoproteolytic cleavage to liberate the
  GSVs from Golgi matrix proteins, including Golgin-160 and others not shown. The
  N-terminal cleavage product, TUGUL, is a ubiquitin-like modifier. In adipocytes,
  TUGUL is attached to KIF5B, a microtubule motor that carries the GSVs to the cell
  surface; in muscle, this or another kinesin may be involved. Fusion of these vesicles
  at the cell surface results in the insertion of their specific cargo proteins into
  the plasma membrane. These include GLUT4, which promotes glucose uptake, IRAP which
  cleaves and inactivates circulating vasopressin, and LRP1 and sortilin, which bind
  the lipoproteins ApoE and ApoA5 and may regulate lipid metabolism. These proteins
  may have other effects as well. The TUG C-terminal product is extracted from the
  Golgi matrix by the action of p97 ATPases and is targeted to the nucleus. It binds
  the transcriptional regulator PPARγ and its co-factor PGC-1α, and stimulates the
  expression of genes to promote lipid oxidation and thermogenesis. The stability
  of the C-terminal product is regulated by the Ate1 arginyltransferase, and the product
  confers Ate1-dependent stability on PGC-1α. Degradation of these proteins makes
  their thermogenic effect transient, consistent with the transient increase in thermogenesis
  that is observed after meals.

  description: Coordinated regulation of distinct physiologic effects. Insulin signals

    One involves Akt and the RabGAPs, Tbc1D4 and Tbc1D1, which regulate distinct Rab
    proteins on the GSVs (and on other membranes, such as endosomes). A second pathway
    involves the Rho family GTPase TC10α, which is coupled through its effector PIST

    In adipocytes, TUGUL is attached to KIF5B, a microtubule motor that carries the

    Fusion of these vesicles at the cell surface results in the insertion of their
