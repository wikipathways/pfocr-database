caption: 'Antitumor effects of HDACi. multiple myeloma: Multiple myeloma: CUDC-907
  simultaneously targets HDAC and PI3K, reducing the expression of Bcl-xL and MCL-1,
  thereby inhibiting myeloma cell growth. Hodgkin lymphoma: Ixazomib combined with
  Belinostat can synergistically inhibit the NFE2L2 pathway, suppress proteasome activity,
  and thereby enhance cytotoxicity. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: Volasertib combined with
  HDACi induces DNA damage, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Lung cancer: 6a simultaneously
  targets HDAC and MIF, inducing histone acetylation and blocking the MIF-CXCR7-AKT
  pathway, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of NSCLC cells. Breast cancer: HDACi
  can promote metastasis by enhancing H3K9 acetylation of the NEDD9 gene promoter,
  upregulating NEDD9 expression, and activating FAK phosphorylation. FAK inhibitors
  can reverse this process. Pancreatic cancer: HDACi inhibits the SRF-FOXM1 transcriptional
  axis, downregulating the pro-fibrotic genes Acta2 and Col1a1 and the pro-inflammatory
  factor LIF, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Colorectal cancer: HDACi reduces the
  phosphorylation level of Rb, preventing E2F1 from being released from the E2F1/Rb/HDAC1
  complex. The retention of E2F1 prevents it from activating downstream target genes
  that drive the cell cycle process, ultimately inhibiting the growth of CRC cells.
  Cervical cancer, HDACi activates PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitochondrial autophagy,
  thereby inhibiting the growth of cervical cancer cells'
