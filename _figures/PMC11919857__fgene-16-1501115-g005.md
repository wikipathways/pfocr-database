caption: LncRNA-NEAT1 in cancer. (By Figdraw.) The interactions among non - coding
  RNAs (such as lncRNA and miRNA) and their related signaling pathways in different
  types of cancers, including non - small - cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma
  and colorectal cancer. Specifically, it details the key miRNAs, lncRNAs, their regulated
  target genes and signaling pathways in each type of cancer, which is helpful for
  understanding the molecular mechanisms of these cancers
