caption: 'Regulation of Ral subcellular localization and membrane association. CAAX
  motif-signaled posttranslational modifications. Ral is geranylgeranylated by GGTase-1
  on the first cysteine residue of the CAAX (RalA: CCIL; RalB: CCLL). By the canonical
  CAAX processing pathway, Ral is then modified at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  by Ras converting enzyme (Rce1) which cleaves between the two cysteine residues.
  Isoprenyl cysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT) then catalyzes methylation
  of the isoprenylated free cysteine residue, facilitating recruitment to the plasma
  membrane. A second non-canonical pathway has been described by which Ral is palmitoylated
  at the cysteine residue at the A1 position by Golgi-associated protein acetyltransferase
  (PAT) after geranylgeranylation. Palmitate addition is reversible and depalmitoylation
  is catalyzed by acylprotein thioesterase (APT). Whether this double lipid modified
  form is associated with a different membrane compartment has not been determined.
  Ral subcellular localization is also regulated by a dynamic and reversible protein
  kinase (PK)-mediated phosphorylation and protein phosphatase (PP)-mediated dephosphorylation
  cycle. RalA and RalB possess distinct C-terminal phosphorylation sites for different
  protein kinases (PK). Phosphorylation causes dissociation from the plasma membrane
  and translocation to specific endomembrane compartments, resulting in a switch in
  effector (E) interaction.'
