caption: All factors are based on molecular transport in IPA (p = 2.44e-09). Pink
  indicates previously established T2D-factors for three canonical pathways (i.e.
  insulin receptor signaling, leptin signaling in obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus
  signaling). Solid and dashed lines indicate direct and indirect interactions, respectively.
  The arrows indicate specific molecular relationships. Nodes are displayed by the
  functional classes of the gene product (square, cytokines; diamond, enzyme; circle
  in a circle, complex/group; triangle, kinase; rectangle, ligand-dependent nuclear
  receptor; dotted rectangle, ion channel; trapezium, transporter).
