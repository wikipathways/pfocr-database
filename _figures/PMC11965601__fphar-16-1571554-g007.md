caption: Mechanism of mitochondrial protection in Lycium barbarum L. LBP can effectively
  mitigate mitochondrial DNA damage, enhance membrane potential, and restore respiratory
  chain function, thereby improving the energy supply and physiological function of
  photoreceptor cells. Besides, LBP can inhibit the inflammatory response induced
  by photodamage and reduce further cellular damage from inflammatory factors. Carotenoids
  and flavonoids contribute to promoting ATP synthesis and provide adequate energy
  support for photoreceptor cells. Furthermore, they reduce ROS production within
  mitochondria, thereby preserving the structural and functional integrity of mitochondria
  and interrupting the critical pathway of retinal cell apoptosis at the mitochondrial
  level By Figdraw
