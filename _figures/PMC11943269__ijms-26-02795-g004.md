caption: The schematic model represents the possible RT role in adjuvant therapy for
  TNBC. During TNBC growth, poor interaction and immune invasion enhance TNBC tumorigenesis
  and progression. A lack of antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) is unable
  to activate cytotoxic T cells and NK cells hence TNBC gains EMT and metastatic phenotypic
  potential. On the other hand, RT induces immune-responsive TME by the indication
  of HMBG1, DAMPs, ATP, etc., from tumor cells that enhance DC maturation, able to
  capture tumor surface antigen for CD8+ T cell presentation. RT modulates CD8+ T
  cell and NK cell differentiation and expansion by releasing several tumor-related
  cytokines, chemokines, and other factors leading to immunogenic attacks. On the
  other side, RT induces infiltration of macrophage M2 and MDSC into TME and creates
  immunosuppressive TEM by inducing anti-inflammatory signaling. To enhance the immunotherapeutic
  impact, inhibition of M2 activity (anti-CD163) and MDSCs synthesis, use of immunotherapy-based
  anti-PD1 anti-CTLA4 antibodies, ICIs, PARP inhibitors, and tumor cell targeted transcription
  faction and signaling pathway inhibitors potentiate RT efficacy. The use of RT in
  adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and immunotherapy) curtails EMT and the metastatic
  potential of TMBC which leads to increased overall survival in TMBC patients. The
  schematic model was generated using BioRender
