caption: Core components of the Hippo pathway in mammalian cells. The core components
  of Hippo pathway consist of MST1/2, LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ. When the Hippo pathway
  is ON, MST1/2, in complex with SAV1, phosphorylate LATS1/2 and MOB1. MAP4Ks also
  phosphorylate and activate LATS1/2. NF2 is an additional and potent activator of
  LATS1/2 that is devoid of kinase activity. Activated LATS1/2 phosphorylate YAP and
  TAZ, resulting in 14-3-3-mediated YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic retention and ubiquitin-mediated
  proteasomal degradation. When the Hippo pathway is OFF, YAP/TAZ are dephosphorylated
  and translocate to the nucleus, where they compete with VGLL4 for TEADs binding
  and induce the transcription of downstream target genes, such as CTGF and CYR61,
  which are involved in growth, proliferation, and survival.
