caption: A system biology approach for the study of cell–cell interactions. (A) Cell
  populations in the uninjured heart, each cell population can be thought of as a
  module (dashed boxes). (B) Following an environmental perturbation, each cell population
  exhibits (C) changes in genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles, and new populations
  are also recruited such as inflammatory cells and cardiac progenitor cells (illustrated
  here as an example). (D) Changes in each cell population result in specific functional
  changes such as myocyte hypertrophy or fibroblast proliferation (thus each module
  is associated with specific functional changes with a defined environmental perturbation).
  (E) Functional changes in each cell population (module) result in organ-wide changes
  (such as increased cardiac mass and increased blood flow to enhance angiogenesis).
  The functional effects occurring in each module are critical for supporting organ
  function (e.g. increased blood flow supporting increased muscle mass). (F) (i) Appropriate
  and proportionate changes (green arrows) lead to organ-wide compensation and preservation
  of ejection fraction (EF), but (ii and iii) modular changes not commensurate with
  the demand (red bars) result in maladaptation and declining EF. (ii) Appropriate
  hypertrophy and appropriate fibrotic response but inappropriate decrease in blood
  flow cannot sustain organ compensation (thus, changes exclusively occurring in the
  endothelial cell module can be modelled against appropriate changes in the muscle
  and fibroblast module for predicting how a vascular response affects cardiac function
  after hypertrophy). (iii) Similarly, inappropriate changes in the fibroblast module
  cannot maintain cardiac function even with appropriate degrees of compensation from
  the muscle and endothelium modules. Green arrows indicate appropriate degree of
  compensation, while red bars indicate an inappropriate degree of compensation.
