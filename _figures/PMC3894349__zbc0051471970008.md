caption: Hypothetical model illustrating the actions of hirsutenone (HIR) and CDDP
  in chemoresistant OVCA. Although many further aspects remain to be determined, the
  PI3K/Akt pathway is known to be frequently overexpressed and XIAP stabilized at
  high levels in chemoresistant OVCA (). A, Akt appears to inhibit apoptosis by stabilizing
  both XIAP and MDM2 at the protein level via direct phosphorylation of these proteins
  (, ). B, hirsutenone suppresses Akt function by inhibiting PI3K and induces degradation
  of XIAP and MDM2. C, in the presence of CDDP, hirsutenone further enhances p53 activation,
  down-regulates XIAP and MDM2 content, and facilitates AIF nuclear translocation,
  the latter possibly through direct action of p53 at the mitochondrial level ().
