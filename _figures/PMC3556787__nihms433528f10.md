caption: In the presence of high JH and 20E levels (larval molting stage), the mRNAs
  for FKBP39 and Chd64 are induced, and these proteins interact with EcR, USP, and
  Met and bind to the DmJHRE1 sequence. This could result increased expression of
  DmJHRE1-containing genes and reduction in expression of ecdysone response genes
  due to a decrease in availability of EcR and USP. 20E increases in the absence of
  JH (metamorphosis), the FKBP39 and Chd64 levels are low, and EcR heterodimerizes
  with the other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, especially with the
  USP and other cofactors (, –), and induces the expression of ecdysone-response genes.
