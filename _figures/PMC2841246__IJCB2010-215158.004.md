caption: 'Effects of COX-2 inhibitors on apoptosis. Apoptosis can be mainly mediated
  by two pathways: the mitochondrial, intrinsic, or stress-induced apoptosis, which
  is activated in response to damaging stresses and the extrinsic pathway, triggered
  by the binding of ligands to specific death receptors []. COX-2 inhibitors are able
  to modulate stress-induced apoptosis as well as extrinsic apoptosis in several cell
  types. In this picture, some examples of these interaction discussed in the text
  are presented for different cell types: LNCaP, prostate cancer; K562, chronic myeloid
  leukemia; HT29, colorectal cancer; SK-Hep 1 and HLE, human hepatocarcinoma cells;
  HepG2, hepatocarcinoma; Be17402, hepatocarcinoma; SMMC-7402, hepatocarcinoma; MG-63,
  osteosarcoma. Abbreviation: AIF: apoptosis-inducing factor; Bcl-2, B cell lymphoma
  2; Bid, Bcl-2 interacting domain; Casp, caspase; Cyt, cytochrome C; DD, death domain;
  DED, death effector domain; DISC, death-inducing silencing complex; PI3K/PKB, phosphatidyl
  inositol-3 kinase/protein kinase B; FADD, Fas-associated death domain; GSH, glutathione;
