caption: After fear extinction, the conditioned fear response is supressed by the
  following three mechanisms. Excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission at mPFC synapses
  onto principal BLA neurons (BLA/PN) decreases (1), whereas feedforward GABA-mediated
  inhibition in these projections remains intact. This results in a reduced excitation/inhibition
  balance in the mPFC-BLA pathway, and a consequent increase in functional efficiency
  of inhibition in the BLA during the CS presentation. The synaptic efficacy at mPFC
  projections to BLA local circuit interneurons (2) as well as to ITC (3) is unaffected
  by extinction training. The activation of interneurons causes frequency-dependent
  heterosynaptic inhibition in the auditory cortex-BLA pathway (the input providing
  auditory CS information), also reducing fear response during the auditory CS presentation.
