caption: Relation between activated WNT/β-catenin pathway and Warburg effect in ASD.
  Mutations in ASD lead to activate the presence of WNT ligands. Then, WNT binds both
  Frizzled and LRP 5/6 receptors to phosphorylate the AXIN/APC/GSK-3β complex. Thus,
  β-catenin phosphorylation is stopped and this inhibits its degradation into the
  proteasome. β-catenin accumulates in the cytosol and translocates to the nucleus
  to bind the complex TCF/LEF co transcription factors. WNT target gene transcription
  is activated by nuclear β-catenin (PDK, c-Myc, cyclin D1, MCT-1). Glucose also activates
  the WNT signaling. MCT-1 favors lactate expulsion out of the cell. WNT/β-catenin
  pathway activates tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) activity. Activated PI3K/Akt
  pathway stimulates glucose metabolism. Akt-transformed cells protect against reactive
  oxygen species stress (ROS) by inducing HIF-1α, which suppresses glucose entry into
  the TCA cycle. Stimulation of HIF-1α activity activates the expression of the glycolytic
  enzymes (GLUT, HK, PKM2, LDH-A). Aerobic glycolysis is observed with the increase
  of lactate production and the decrease of mitochondrial respiration. HIF-1α induced
  PDK phosphorylates PDH, which resulting in cytosolic pyruvate being shunted into
  lactate by inducing LDH-A activation. PDK inhibits the PDH complex into the mitochondria,
  thus pyruvate cannot be fully converted into acetyl-CoA and enter the TCA cycle.
  c-Myc and cyclin D1 also stimulates LDH-A activity which converts cytosolic pyruvate
  into lactate. Activated PKM2 translocates to the nucleus to bind β-catenin and then
  to induce the expression of c-Myc
