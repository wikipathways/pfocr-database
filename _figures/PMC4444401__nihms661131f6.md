caption: The integrated signaling network is color-coded to track pathways activated
  by IGF-1 (green), IL-1β (red), OSM (blue), and IL-1β/OSM (parallel red and blue).
  Solid lines with arrows indicate pathway activation and kinase phosphorylation by
  indicated stimulus. The dashed line is to indicate that IL-1β by itself does not
  stimulate Akt phosphorylation but does when used in combination with OSM. The weight
  of the lines indicates the relative level of phosphorylation stimulated (eg, IGF-1
  is a strong stimulator of Akt phosphorylation and PG synthesis, so those green arrows
  are weighted heavily). This signaling network illustrates that while IGF-1 and the
  combination of IL-1β and OSM share activation of the PI-3K-Akt pathway, they have
  different downstream effects due to differential activation of the JNK and p38 MAP
  kinases as well as STAT3.
