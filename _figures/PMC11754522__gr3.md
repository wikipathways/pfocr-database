caption: Mechanisms by which nutritional interventions alter ceramide metabolism (created
  by Figdraw 2.0). Key dietary nutrients/components, such as the dairy products, dietary
  fibers, unsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, and calorie-restricted diet, are depicted
  in relation to their influences on ceramide synthesis and degradation pathways.
  The blue solid arrows represent the upregulation or downregulation of biochemicals
  or enzymes. Alk-SMase, alkaline sphingomyelinase; ApoB, apolipoprotein B; CDase,
  ceramidase; DES, dihydroceramide desaturase; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; SMase, sphingomyelinase; SMS, sphingomyelin synthase; SPHK, sphingosine
  kinase
