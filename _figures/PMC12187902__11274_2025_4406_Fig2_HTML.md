caption: Chemical structures of SMs induced in actinobacteria during co-culture with
  MACB. Chemical structure of keyicin from a co-culture of marine derived Micromonospora
  sp. WMMB235 and Rhodococcus sp. WMMA185 (a). Chemical structure of 5aTHQs (b) and
  streptoaminals (STAMs) (c) from a combined-culture of S. nigrescens HEK616 and T.
  pulmonis TP-B0596. The numbers in the compound names refer to the carbon length
  of the acyl chains. The prefixes “n,” “i,” and “a” denote normal-type, iso-type,
  and anteiso-type branching, respectively. Putative biosynthetic pathway for 5aTHQs
  and streptoaminals from the common precursor (d)
