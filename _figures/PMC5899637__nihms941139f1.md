caption: (Left panel) The blood-tumor-barrier associated with BCBMs has increased
  permeability mediated by desmin-positive pericytes and altered tight junctions.
  Although this allows trastuzumab to penetrate the brain parenchyma, inhibition of
  HER2 alone (Right panel, dashed arrow) is counteracted by brain-specific resistance
  mechanisms (see text for details). (Right panel) Brain-specific drug resistance
  mechanisms in BCBMs include loss of PTEN expression and activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR
  pathway as well as activation of parallel signaling pathways via neuregulin-HER3
  axis. Drug inhibition of these targets (colored bar-headed line) shows promising
  efficacy in pre-clinical models.
