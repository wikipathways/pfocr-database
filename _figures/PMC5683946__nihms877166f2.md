caption: NMD degrades mRNAs encoding UPR components. A simplified diagram depicting
  the three UPR pathways, activated by the PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 sensors, respectively.
  When chaperones, including BiP and TNRC5, leave these sensors to bind unfolded proteins,
  the sensors activate intracellular signaling, leading to transcriptional activation,
  as shown. UPR components encoded by high-confidence NMD target RNAs are designated
  in red font; UPR components encoded by mRNAs that less evidence suggests are NMD
  target mRNAs are designated in black font. XBP1u XBP1 unspliced, XBP1s XBP1 spliced
  isoform.
