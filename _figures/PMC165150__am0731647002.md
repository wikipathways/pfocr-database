caption: Schematic representation of the specific crtYB gene inactivation approach
  by single (A) and double (B) crossover. Prior to the introduction in X. dendrorhous
  by electrotransformation, the plasmids pPR16 and pPR19F were linearized with the
  endonucleases BstXI and EcoRI, respectively. SI, site of insertion (the insert was
  a blunted EcoRI fragment in a blunted BstXI site) (Table ).
