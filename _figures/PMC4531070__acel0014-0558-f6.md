caption: Model for the role of PRDX-2 in regulation of IIS and arsenite resistance.
  There is considerable complexity in the inputs and outputs of the DAF-2/insulin-like
  signalling pathway. This complexity is indicated by the coloured shading, with red
  signifying the aspects which require PRDX-2. PRDX-2 is required for the secretion
  of at least one insulin-like peptide, the DAF-2 agonist, DAF-28. DAF-2 signalling
  inhibits the activity of DAF-16, SKN-1 (Fig.A) and HSF-1. In the absence of PRDX-2,
  lower levels of insulin (DAF-28) secretion reduce the activity of DAF-2 (IIS) and
  hence increase the intestinal SKN-1 and DAF-16 activities sufficiently to increase
  arsenite resistance. However, further changes in IIS are required for DAF-16-dependent
  reprogramming of development (dauer) or fat metabolism. PRDX-2 is required for longevity
  at 15 °C, even when IIS is further reduced or the activity of IIS-inhibited transcription
  factors, DAF-16 or HSF-1 is genetically increased. This suggests that PRDX-2 promotes
  longevity at 15 °C independently from regulating IIS.
