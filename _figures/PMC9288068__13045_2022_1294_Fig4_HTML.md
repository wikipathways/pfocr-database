caption: 'Controversial roles of IFN-γ in the TME of CRC. Antitumor: IFN-γ signaling
  from immune cells and a high IFNG.GS/ISG.RS ratio were associated with increased
  CD8+ T cells and NK cell activation, and high response to ICB immunotherapy. IFN-γ
  can prompt CD8+ T cells and NK cells infiltration into TME, promote the MHC-I expression,
  boost Th1 cells polarization, directly induce tumor cells apoptosis or non-apoptotic
  death, establish tumor cells dormancy and inhibit tumor cells proliferation by IFN-γ/STAT1
  pathway or non-STAT1 signaling; immune evasion: IFN-γ signaling released by tumor
  cells and a low IFNG.GS/ISG.RS ratio were associated with resistance to ICB treatment.
  IFN-γ can induce tumor antigen loss, recruit MDSC and TAMs into the TME, induce
  tumor immunoediting, and facilitate the expression of PD-L1, IDO, and arginase in
  TME'
