caption: Schematic and simplified diagram of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway
  leading to the accumulation of anthocyanin in Brassica. The pathway is divided into
  three major parts; the upstream phenylpropanoid pathway, the early biosynthetic
  pathway, and the late biosynthetic pathway, based on the types of genes involved
  in each stage. The possible activation sites of the regulatory MBW complexes are
  indicated. Details of the genes involved in each stage are provided in Table . PAL
  phenylalanine ammonia lyase, C4H cinnamate-4-hydroxylase, 4CL 4-coumaratel-CoA ligase,
  CHS chalcone synthase, CHI chalcone isomerase, F3H flavanone-3-hydroxylase, FLS
  flavonol synthase, DFR dihydroflavanol reductase, ANS anthocyanidin synthase, UGT
