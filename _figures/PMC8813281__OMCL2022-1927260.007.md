caption: Molecular mechanism underling the circ_SMG6/miR-138-5p/EGR1 regulatory network
  in myocardial I/R injury. circ_SMG6 and EGR1 are abundantly expressed while miR-138-5p
  is weakly expressed in myocardial tissues of I/R mice. circ_SMG6 competitively binds
  to miR-138-5p to upregulate the expression of EGR1 and to promote the binding of
  EGR1 to the TLR4 promoter, thus activating the TLR4/TRIF signaling pathway. By this
  mechanism, a large number of neutrophils are recruited, and myocardial I/R injury
  is ultimately aggravated.
