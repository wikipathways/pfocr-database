caption: Role of mitochondria in embryonic heart development. Cardiomyocytes produce
  energy (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation or anaerobic glycolysis, and during embryonic
  heart development, energy metabolism shifts from anaerobic glycolysis to aerobic
  oxidative phosphorylation involving mitochondria. And mitochondria produce intermediary
  metabolites and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are involved in signaling pathways,
  redox homeostasis, and gene expression, and involve transcription factors including
  the κB family (NF-κB), activator protein-1 family (AP1) and hypoxia-inducible transcription
  factors (HIFs). Additionally, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c mediates apoptosis
  and regulates cardiac development during the embryonic period. Also, the closure
  of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) during the embryonic period
  facilitates oxidative phosphorylation, which reduces ROS levels in embryonic cardiomyocytes
  and promotes differentiation of embryonic cardiomyocytes. Mitochondrial quality
  control, including mitochondrial fusion, division, and mitochondrial autophagy is
  mediated by the PINK1-Mfn2-Parkin complex; Mitochondrial protein-2 (MFN2) regulates
  mitochondrial morphology and function by participating in mitochondrial fusion.
  While MFN2, which is highly expressed in embryonic stage, inhibits cardiomyocyte
  proliferation through the Ras-Raf-ERK signaling pathway. Mitochondria in the embryonic
  heart binds to ER and mediates the regulation of cardiac systolic-diastolic processes
  by Ca2+ concentration, and also activates the Ca +-dependent NFAT signaling pathway
  to regulate cardiac development. GSH, glutathione. ER, endoplasmic reticulum
