caption: Pathway analysis of proteins in higher abundance in TIS EVs. (a) The top
  overrepresented pathways in TIS EVs by IPA. (b) The top overrepresented pathways
  in control EVs by IPA. (c) Proteins from the data set (red) present in TIS EVs overlaid
  on the ‘Breast Cancer Regulation by Stathmin 1’ pathway created by IPA. (d) Sixty-nine
  proteins from the data set (red) present in TIS EVs associated with cell proliferation,
  generated by IPA. P-values reported for IPA results are calculated by IPA using
  a right-sided Fisher exact test for over-representation analysis and Benjamini–Hochberg
  correction for multiple hypothesis testing correction.
