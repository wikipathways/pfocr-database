caption: A model for the role of AGPs in pollen tube growth. (A) Accepted model for
  pollen tube growth [,], illustrating vesicle exocytosis (1), smooth endocytosis
  (2), clathrin vesicle endocytosis (3), the pathway into degradation (4) and the
  recycling pathway (5). The apical dome (red), the exocytosis region (green), the
  multivesicular body (purple) and the vacuole (blue) are shown. (B) Proposed model
  for AGP signaling role in the pollen tube apical dome. AGPs act as receptors for
  extracellular signals and interact with transmembrane proteins, possibly receptor
  kinases or C2 domain-containing proteins. These interactions lead to opening of
  calcium channels, triggering various intracellular events. During pollen tube growth,
  AGPs are recycled by endocytosis, and either reused or sent for degradation, through
  multivesicular bodies. (C) Proposed model for the sub-apical zone. The hardening
  of cell wall pectins resulting from complexing with calcium hinders AGP contact
  with putative signal molecules, rendering AGPs inactive.
