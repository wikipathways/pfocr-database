caption: 'Schematic representation of the core autophagy pathway and its regulation
  by miRNAs. Autophagy proceeds through a series of steps including induction, vesicle
  nucleation, membrane elongation, and autophagosome maturation into the lysosome
  for degradation and recycling. miRNAs regulation occurs at each dynamic step. Autophagy
  induction is directly and tightly controlled by the ‘nutrient sensor’ mTORC1, which
  under nutrient-rich condition precludes the assembly and the activation of the autophagy-initiating
  ULK complex comprising ULK1/2, Atg13, and FIP200 (Step 1). mTORC1 is inactivated
  in response to various stimuli (for instance, starvation, hypoxia), which enables
  the activation of the ULK complex and triggers the autophagy cascade. MiR-20a, miR106b,
  and miR-885-3P target ULK1/2 and suppress autophagy. Phagophore nucleation, which
  is confined to the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P)-containing vesicles,
  is driven by the Beclin1-associated PI3KC3 complex (Step 2). The activity of this
  kinase complex is suppressed by the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, a functional
  target of multiple miRNAs such as miR-182, miR-34a, miR-210, miR-205, miR-21, miR-195,
  miR-24-2, and miR-365-2. Beclin1 can also be targeted by miR-30a, miR-30d, miR-17-5p,
  miR-216a, miR-376a, and miR-365-2. In addition, UVRAG is a direct and functional
  target of miR-630 and miR-374a, while Atg14 being inhibited by miR-195. Autophagosome
  membrane elongation involves two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems: one is Atg12-Atg5
  conjugation and the other is LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugation, the
  latter of which is sequentially processed by Atg4, Atg7, and Atg3 (Step 3). Atg7
  can be suppressed by miR-375 and miR-17. LC3-II levels are posttranscriptionally
  controlled by miR-204. Fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome signifies the
  maturation stage of the autophagy pathway, a step that involves multiple membrane
  fusion factors and is negatively regulated by the Rubicon complex (Rubicon-UVRAG-Beclin1-PI3KC3-p150).
  Finally, the encapsulated contents, together with the inner membrane of the autophagosome,
  undergo breakdown by lysosomal hydrolases.'
