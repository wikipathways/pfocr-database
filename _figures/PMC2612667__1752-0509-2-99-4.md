caption: Cholesterol Regulatory Pathway. The cholesterol biosynthesis pathway is shown
  on this figure starting by its precursor Acetyl-CoA. Several of the key enzymes
  of this pathway regulated by SREBPs are also shown. The genetic regulation initiated
  by the effect of cholesterol on the Insig-SREBP-SCAP complex can be seen on the
  top of this figure. The action of statins, widely used hypolipidemic drugs, on the
  HMG-CoA-Reductase enzyme is also captured in this graph. Species of the model are
  grouped into cellular compartments as nucleus, golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum.
  Default cellular compartment is the cytosol. This graphical representation has been
  prepared with CellDesigner [,].
