caption: 'Working model for ADAM10 in lung cancer. ADAM10 is overexpressed in lung
  cancer, resulting in an overall increase in its activity and cleavage of oncogenic
  substrates such as Notch1, N-cadherin, and E-cadherin, which increases in MMP9 and
  Vimentin levels. The enhanced activation of the Notch signaling pathway also occurs
  and ultimately contributes to the EMT development in NSCLC. Note: The figure was
