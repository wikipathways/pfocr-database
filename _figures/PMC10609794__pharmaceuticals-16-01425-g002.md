caption: Role of the PRG4-CD44 axis in mitigating the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic
  signaling pathways in DJDs. In response to injury, monocytes migrate into the synovial
  joint and differentiate into macrophages. Priming the resident macrophages by DAMPs,
  IL-1β, or bacterial ligands via TLRs or IL-1β receptor triggers signaling cascades
  that activate NFκB translocation, pro-IL-1β production, and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly,
  an innate cytosolic multiprotein complex that triggers IL-1β maturation. NFκB translocation
  induces transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL-1β and TNF-α, that
  drive the inflammatory response (Signal 1). Detection of endogenous danger signal,
  e.g., MSU crystals or extracellular matrix breakdown products by CD44 receptors
  (Signal 2), provokes ROS production, NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, and IL-1β secretion
  (A). Activated resident macrophages also produce profibrotic mediators, including
  TGF-β that directly activate resident fibroblasts and promote their differentiation
  into collagen-producing myofibroblasts that possess enhanced de novo α-SMA expression.
  TGF-β signaling pathway leads to Smad2/3 phosphorylation. The activated Smad2/3
  form complexes with Smad4 and translocate to regulate downstream gene transcription.
  The TGF-β signaling pathway also activates the JNK/p38MAPK/Erk pathway, resulting
  in an increase in cell proliferation and migration (B). PGR4-CD44 interaction reduces
  endogenous danger internalization, DAMP-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation, IL-1β
  production, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The binding of PRG4 to CD44 receptor
  activates PP2A to inhibit ROS generation and NF-κB nuclear translocation. The PRG4-CD44
  axis regulates synovial fibroblast to myofibroblast transition as exhibited by a
  reduction in Smad3 phosphorylation, α-SMA, collagen expression, fibroblast proliferation,
  and migration. (Created with https://BioRender.com/).
