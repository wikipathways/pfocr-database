caption: Pathway and subcellular compartmentation of isoprenoid biosynthesis in M.
  polymorpha. In addition to plastidial, cytosolic, endoplasmic reticulum-cytosol,
  and mitochondrial sites of isoprenoid biosynthesis, we propose that in M. polymorpha
  and in other liverworts, the oil body is a new cellular site of isoprenoid metabolism
  in addition to its known sequestering role.
