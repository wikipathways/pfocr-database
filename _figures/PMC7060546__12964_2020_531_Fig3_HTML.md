caption: Schematic diagram of the roles of (P) RR in pathways that contribute to oncogenesis,
  as well as cancer progression and metastasis. In the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, (P)
  RR is an important component of the Wnt receptor complex and acts as an adaptor
  between LRP6 and V-ATPase, thus facilitates the binding of Wnt ligands (Wnts) to
  the Wnt receptor complex, internalization of the complex as a signalosome and Wnt
  signaling transduction. Full-length (P) RR or M8–9 fragment also interacts with
  the V-ATPase, on both plasma and vesicle membranes, thus assists it to generate
  a proton gradient across the plasma membrane that is crucial for LRP6 phosphorylation
  and subsequent β-catenin activation, as well as to acidize of the vesicles. On binding
  with the prorenin/renin, (P) RR further contributes to signal transduction of the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways, directly or through the induction of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) formation. The binding of prorenin or renin to (P) RR enhances
  their enzymatic activity, which further facilitates the catalysis of angiotensinogen
  (AGT) to angiotensin (Ang) I. Then, Ang I will be acted on by angiotensin-converting
  enzyme (ACE) to produce Ang II, which triggers Ang II receptor-mediated signal transduction,
  leading to elevated tissue RAS activity as well as the formation of NF-κB and transforming
  growth factor (TGF)β
