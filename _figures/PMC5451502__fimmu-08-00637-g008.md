caption: 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) treatment prevents M2-mediated pathogenesis through
  an AMPK-Hif-1α-dependent pathway. 2-DG treatment decreased glycolysis in macrophages
  which then activates AMPK pathway. The activated p-AMPK subsequently inhibits Hif-1α
  and finally decreased M2 polarized macrophages. 2-DG treatment significantly decreases
  anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage polarization and prevents disease progression in
  tumor and allergic airway inflammation.
