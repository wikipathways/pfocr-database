caption: Proposed model of the Notch-ROCK pathway and its biological significance.
  The cytoplasmic form of Notch1, independent of its transcriptional activity, triggers
  caspase-mediated cleavage (activation) of ROCK, which promotes increased expression
  of inflammatory factors, resulting in the exacerbation of myocardial inflammation
