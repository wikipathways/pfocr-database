caption: HJ-mediated repairs and the corresponding models. In HR and ALT pathway,
  the repair factor Rad51 binds one damage strand to initiate template search and
  strand invasion, resulting in the formation of single and double HJs, and these
  intermediates can be dissolved or resolved via different nucleases. In course of
  replication fork restoration, replication fork can undergo regression to form a
  single HJ when damage occurs, the end chain of single HJ invades into template to
  create a new HJ and then be removed by HJ nucleases. Besides, the regression may
  be reversed by BLM helicase, and the impaired fork may be cleaved to generate a
  single DSB for further recombinational repair. Again, the damage may be bypassed
  due to the discontinuous synthesis of DNA and eventually become a single-strand
  gap, which can be repaired by bypass synthesis or recombinational gap-repair.
