caption: 'Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of the hub gene
  secreted LY6/PLAUR domain and its connected genes. The results revealed that they
  are involved in DNA replication, cell cycle and P53 signaling pathways. The large
  colored indicate nodes with a P<0.05: Turquiose, 0.001; green, 8.097E−5; brown,
  1.236E−6. The small circles represent the proteins that are in the pathway denoted
  by the node. The small blue squares indicated the proteins that are regulated by
  the proteins in the pathways.'
