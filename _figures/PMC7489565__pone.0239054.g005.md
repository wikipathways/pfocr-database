caption: (X) In the first step of tetrahydrofuran formation, MadC catalyses epoxidation
  of the C24-C25 and C28-C29 E double bonds. (XI) The epoxide hydrolase MadB catalyses
  formation of the two tetrahydrofuran rings through a cascade epoxide ring-opening;
  (XII) Acetylation of the C41 hydroxyl group is catalysed by Mad17. (XIII) Elimination
  of the acetyl group by Mad18 forms the C40-C41 exocyclic double bond. (XIV) Hydroxylation
  of C36 by Mad29. It is possible this hydroxylation event takes place earlier in
  the biosynthesis (XV) Mad10 catalyses the formation of an oxadecalin containing
  intermediate 10. (XVI) The equivalent oxadecalin intermediate in tetronasin biosynthesis
  acquired a water at C3 to form a hemiacetal []. Given the structural similarity
  between tetromadurin and tetronasin, it is likely the tetromadurin oxadecalin intermediate
  can be hydrated at C3 to form 11. (XVII) Mad31 catalyses formation of the tetrahydropyran
  ring and dismantles the oxadecalin ring to form 12. (XVIII) Mad30 then catalyses
  hydroxylation of C38, forming tetromadurin 1. Bonds/atoms have been coloured red
  to highlight the chemical change.
