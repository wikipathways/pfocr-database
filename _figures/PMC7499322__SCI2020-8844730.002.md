caption: Promotional roles of MSC-derived exosomes in tumors. MSC-derived exosomes
  can promote tumor growth and cell migration and confer drug resistance on gastric
  cancer by activating the Akt, ERK1/2, CaM-Ks, and Hedgehog pathways and transporting
  miR-221 to cancer cells. MSC-derived exosomes support multiple myeloma progression
  by shuttling LINC00461. Moreover, MSC-derived exosomes support breast cancer cell
  proliferation, metastasis, and reorganization through Hippo and Wnt pathways and
  by delivering exosomal TGF-b, C1q, semaphorins, MMP-2, miR-21, and miR-34a. MSC-derived
  exosomes promote osteosarcoma growth through the Hedgehog pathway. MSC-derived exosomes
  facilitate nasopharyngeal carcinoma progression through the delivery of FGF19. MSC-derived
  exosomes enhance the aggressiveness of glioblastoma and growth of glioma stem cells
  through the delivery of miR-1587.
