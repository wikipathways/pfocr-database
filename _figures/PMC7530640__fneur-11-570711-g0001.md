caption: Role of microglia and canonical NLRP3 inflammasome in Alzheimer's disease.
  Cytokines, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), or danger-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) bind cell surface receptors [e.g., toll-like receptors
  (TLRs)] on the microglia, leading to activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
  pathway (signal 1). The activation of the NF-κB pathway promotes a signaling cascade,
  resulting in the expression of cytokines such as pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 as well
  as NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 protein (Nlrp3). Through the canonical activation
  pathway, Nlrp3 oligomerizes in response to an internalized, cytosolic danger signal
  (DAMP) (signal 2) then recruits Asc and procaspase-1, resulting in inflammasome
  assembly (Asc-spec assembly) and caspase-1 autoactivation. Activated caspase-1 then
  cleaves pro-IL-1β or pro-IL-18 and gasdermin (GSDMD). GSDMD cleavage is also induced
  by caspases 4/5/11 through a non-canonical activation pathway that detects internalized,
  cytosolic LPS, and other PAMPs/DAMPs that bypass membrane-bound pattern recognition
  receptors such as TLRs. Subsequently, GSDMD induces pyroptosis, presumably releasing
  Asc-specs that cross-seed extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and creates Asc-Aβ
  composites that induce a feed-forward cycle amplifying the proinflammatory response.
  In turn, proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and IL-18 induce neuronal damage
  and death, causing neurodegeneration. Degraded neurons can then trigger a feedback
  loop by activating microglia. IL-1R complexes are also activated, creating a positive
  feedback loop that drives additional pro-IL-1β production and primes local microglia
  for inflammasome activation. AD, Alzheimer's disease; IL, interleukin; NFT, neurofibrillary
