caption: Pathway connecting lipid synthesis, lysosomes dysfunction and iron accumulation
  in NBIA syndromes. PANK2, COASY, FA2H and PLA2G6 defects lead to harmed phospholipid
  membrane synthesis and impaired myelination or myelin maintenance. Dysfunctional
  membranes may lead to lysosomal and mitochondrial damage causing ROS production
  and iron uptake upregulation. WDR45 and ATP13A2 are involved in autophagosome formation/degradation.
  The decrease of WDR45 protein expression causes the accumulation of aberrant autophagic
  structures. Lysosomal dysfunction due to ATP13A2 defect, which may originate from
  impaired phospholipid recycling, could ultimately cause degradation of substrates
  and damage of autophagosome clearance. Moreover, perturbation of lysosomes is important
  for iron homeostasis and may promote deposits of iron. Dysfunction of FTL prevents
  the recruitment of iron excess and malfunctioning of CP causes impairment of iron
  export from the cell, responsible for iron overload. The higher free iron-dependent
  oxidative damage requires that the cell increases the degradation of oxidized molecules,
  which can affect the cellular recycling systems, such as lysosomes, and finally,
  lead to cellular death. The role of DCAF17 remains unclear, although its dysfunction
  leads to a neurodegenerative disorders, and hence, in some way, DCAF17 may be related
  to mitochondrial dynamics.
