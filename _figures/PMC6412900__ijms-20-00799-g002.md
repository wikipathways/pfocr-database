caption: Schematic representation of the salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway for salinity
  stress response. The SOS pathway regulates the Na+/H+ antiporters. The SS-induced
  increase in Ca2+ concentration in cytosol and is sensed by SOS3. SOS3 work together
  with SOS2 and triggers its kinase activity. The SOS2–SOS3 localized in plasma membrane.
  Then SOS2 phosphorylates SOS1 and triggers its antiporter (Na+/H+) activity assisting
  Na+ efflux from plant cell.
