caption: Microarray summary of proteasome subunits induced in mouse liver by D3T.
  (A) Proteasomes degrade oxidatively damaged proteins as well as ubiquitin-marked
  proteins. (B) Subunit components of the 19S and 20S proteasomes. Subunits in boldface
  italics are genes elevated by D3T in livers of wild-type, but not nrf2-disrupted,
  mice. Subunits in boldface only are genes induced by D3T in both genotypes.
