caption: Signaling pathways by which NPs induce apoptosis. Apoptosis is mediated through
  3 main apoptotic pathways including cell receptor, mitochondria and ER, that converge
  upon activating caspases. Mitochondria are central during apoptosis and can act
  as amplifiers of the cell receptor pathway through CASP8-mediated BID clevage (truncated
  BID, tBID) and BAX or BAK1 activation. NPs can induce apoptosis via organelle dysfunction,
  ROS generation, ER stress and DNA damage.
