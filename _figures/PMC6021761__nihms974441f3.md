caption: Tryptophan (Trp) catabolism proceeds through one of two pathways in mammals,
  leading to production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or serotonin. The kynurenine
  pathway accounts for ~95% and the serotonin pathway for 5% of tryptophan catabolism
  ❶, with possible implications on affect and quality of life in cancer patients where
  the kynurenine pathway is driven by IDO/TDO dysregulation. Epacadostat is >100-fold
  selective for IDO1 against TDO and represents a highly specific agent with competitive
  inhibitory kinetics for tryptophan binding. Navoximod is ~20-fold selective for
  IDO1 against TDO and exhibits non-competitive inhibitory kinetics for tryptophan
  binding. BMS-986205 is an irreversible inhibitor of IDO1 that is highly specific
  for that enzyme. None of these agents inhibit IDO2 appreciably. Indoximod is not
  a direct enzyme inhibitor and its action is complex; it has been reported to indirectly
  inhibit IDO2 and/or IDO1 in some settings. Its primary mechanism of action appear
  to be downstream, in its high potency as a tryptophan mimetic interpreted by mTORC1
  as L-tryptophan under conditions of high tryptophan catabolism and autophagy due
  to tryptophan deprivation by any catabolic enzyme. The targeted enzyme inhibitors
  affect both catabolic effector signaling pathways ❷. Kynurenine functions as a native
  ligand for the pro-inflammatory receptor AHR, which activates downstream gene expression
  ❸. Tryptophan deprivation triggers starvation-induced signals mediated by upregulation
  of the general stress kinase GCN2 and downregulation of the mTORC1 complex (which
  monitors amino acid pools for growth versus autophagy decisions, which are critical
  for T cell function) ❹.
