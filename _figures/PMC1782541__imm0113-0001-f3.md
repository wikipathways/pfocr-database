caption: 'Outline of possible scenarios for common mechanisms of pattern recognition
  of PAMPs and ACAMPs with differential macrophage responses illustrated by the pattern
  recognition receptor (PRR), CD14. 1: Proinflammatory response to a prototypic PAMP,
  LPS, in which the GPI-anchored CD14 cooperates with TLRs to activate NFκB and elicit
  proinflammatory responses. 2: engagement of CD14 by ACAMPs may engage a similar
  default inflammatory signalling pathway but here additional receptor–ligand interactions,
  e.g. the PS/PSR interaction shown, dominantly suppress the proinflammatory response
  and may also engage anti-inflammatory signalling pathway(s). 3: Alternatively, in
  a ligand-dependent manner, CD14 may associate with different signal-transduction
  partners that activate anti-inflammatory rather than proinflammatory responses in
  the phagocyte. 4: A further scenario is that CD14–ACAMP interactions merely tether
  the apoptotic cell to the phagocyte and that additional receptor/ligand interactions
  such as PSR/PS or, as illustrated, vitronectin receptor/MFG-E8/PS, activate anti-inflammatory
  responses in the macrophage.'
