caption: Schematic diagram of the role of ion channel function in cell cycle regulation.
  Ca2+/CaM regulates levels of CDK2, cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin D, and cyclin E (A).
  Calcium further regulates the cell cycle through the store-operated calcium entry
  (SOCE) Pathway. SOCE is upregulated at the G1/S phase transition and downregulated
  at the G2/M phase transition (A). Potassium flux hyperpolarizes the cell, which
  helps drive calcium into the cell regulating calcium influence on the cell cycle
  (B). Chloride flux is required for the cell shrinkage that is necessary for mitosis
  and also regulates levels of p21 (C).
