caption: Results of RT‐qPCR and ELISA validation for cAMP and Rap1 signal pathway.
  A‐E, The genic expression of ADCY1, ADCY5, ADCY8, cAMP and Rap1 was validated via
  RT‐qPCR in control, BLM, BLM + AS, KO, KOB and KOAS group. ***, P < .005; **, P < .01;
  *, P < .05; ns, no significant difference. F‐J, The protein expression of ADCY1,
  ADCY5, ADCY8, cAMP and Rap1 was validated via ELISA in control, BLM, BLM + AS, KO,
  KOB and KOAS group. ***, P < .005; **, P < .01; *, P < .05; ns, no significant difference.
  K, The schema chart showing the hypothesis that AS may attenuate bleomycin‐induced
  pulmonary fibrosis by activating cAMP and Rap1 signalling pathway assisted by A2AR
