caption: Functional contributions of seve ral Mtb-encoded sRNAs including B11/6C (A),
  MTS1338/DrrS (B), MTS0997/Mcr11 (C), ncRv11846/MrsI (D), sncRNA-1 (E), Ms1 (F),
  and Mcr7 (G). Indirect interactions are shown with a dashed line. (A) B11/6C is
  induced by undefined factors and positively regulates the expression genes (panD,
  dnaB) coupled to growth. (B) DrrS+ is induced by the DosR regulon upon nitric oxide
  stress. Then, it undergoes post transcriptional processing to yield MTS1338/DrrS.
  MTS1338/DrrS promotes the expression of three operons (rv0079-rv0081, rv0082-rv0087,
  and rv1620c-rv1622c), which cause defects in Mtb growth and promote persistence.
  The mechanism of this MTS1338/DrrS mediated regulation has not been characterized.
  (C) The expression of MTS0997/Mcr11 is regulated by AbmR, an ATP-bound transcription
  factor. After transcription, MTS0997/Mcr11 undergoes processing at the 3′ end and
  then regulates the expression of genes (lipB, fadA3, and accD5) involved in fatty
  acid production in a site-specific manner. This is negatively regulated by fatty
  acids. (D) In iron-restricted environments, the iron-responsive transcription factor
  IdeR induces the expression of ncRv11846/MrsI, which in return hinders the translation
  of nonessential iron storing proteins (hypF, bfrA, and fprA). This increases the
  level of free iron that can be used for essential functions. (E) sncRNA-1 is induced
  in infected macrophages and gets processed to yield 25 nts RNA. The processed sncRNA-1
  enhances the expression of rv0242c and rv1094, two genes involved in oleic acid
  production. This regulatory network then promotes Mtb growth and survival inside
  macrophages. (F) Ms1 sequesters RNA polymerase (RNAP) at the stationary phase. Upon
  entrance to the outgrowth phase, Ms1 is degraded by PNPase, and some other RNases
  not yet identified, which release RNAP to promote global transcription. (G) PhoP
  induces the expression of Mcr7, which abrogates the translation of tatC. tatC encodes
  TatC, which is involved in the protein secretion pathway.
