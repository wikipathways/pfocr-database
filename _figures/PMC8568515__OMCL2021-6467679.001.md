caption: Hypothetic involvement of MANF in UPR pathway and related diseases. (a) MANF
  displayed expression variation and protective effects on neurological and metabolic
  diseases involving neurodegenerative diseases, myocardial ischemia, type I diabetes,
  and several tumors, which could be a potential prognostic marker or a therapeutic
  target. The circulating MANF variated in diabetes mellitus and PCOS [, ]. With bioinformatic
  analysis, increased expression of MANF was correlated with a poorer prognosis in
  cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma [, ]. Moreover, MANF exhibited varying
  degrees of protective effects in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression or using recombinant
  MANF could promote dopaminergic neuron survival and improve behavior in neurodegenerative
  and stroke models. MANF overexpression ameliorated HepG2 cell steatosis and inhibited
  lipogenesis. Also, recombinant MANF protected cardiac myocytes from ischemia/reperfusion-mediated
  cell death. (b) When ER stress happens, ATF6, IRE2, and PERK separately activate,
  resulting in apoptosis and autophagy. MANF could interact with BiP, the endoplasmic
  reticulum chaperone, and finally promote cell survival. ATF6 would be transferred
  to the Golgi complex and be cleaved into two parts. Then, ATF6 acts as a transcription
  factor, resulting in the expression alteration of MANF, Xbp1, and CHOP. Meanwhile,
  IRE1 could be activated through phosphorylation and dimerization, resulting in upregulated
  expression of MANF and chaperones. Also, IRE1 enables JNK phosphorylation and upregulates
  the expression of NF-κB, then inducing apoptosis and autophagy. The activated PERK
  effects with eIF2α leading to the translation of ATF4 and antioxidant response.
