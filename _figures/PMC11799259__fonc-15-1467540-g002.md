caption: Interaction between genes/pathways in prostate cancer (A) Rb deletion promotes
  the expression of genes downstream of the AR pathway through transcriptional activation
  of E2F and facilitating promoter recruitment of the AR. (B) AR induces signals that
  promote CDK activity and promotes phosphorylation of Rb to inactivate it. (C) AR
  can promote prostate cancer progression by reducing p53 expression through G3BP3,
  which promotes the nuclear translocation of P53. (D) p53 overexpression inhibits
  androgen-induced transactivation of NKX3.1 by repressing the promoter of the AR
  gene and blocking AR-DNA binding activity. Conversely, p53 deletion promotes prostate
  cancer progression by facilitating the AR signaling pathway. (E) WNT can synergize
  with AR to promote the development of aggressive prostate cancer. (F) p53 and Rb
  deletion can mediate lineage plasticity, thereby enabling prostate cancer to evade
  targeted therapies and progress to CRPC. (G) The deletion of PTEN and p53 can lead
  to changes in the lineage of prostate cancer, resulting in the formation of CRPC.
  (H, I) Rb loss facilitates lineage plasticity and metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma
  initiated by PTEN mutation. The additional loss of p53 causes resistance to antiandrogen
  therapy. (J) MYC overexpression or targeted PTEN loss can each produce early prostate
  adenocarcinomas but are not sufficient to induce genetic instability or metastases
  with high penetrance. However, MYC activation and PTEN deletion induced genomic
  instability and aggressive prostate cancer. (K) MYC promotes the development of
  mCRPC by disrupting the transcriptional program of AR. PCa, Prostate cancer
