caption: A composite pathway map generated using the seed genes β-catenin (Ctnnb1),
  prostaglandin E receptor 2 (Ptger2), and cyclooxygenase-2 [prostaglandin-endoperoxide
  synthase 2 (Ptgs2)] for the effect of fluid flow shear stress on podocytes. Each
  significant pathway is highlighted by a corresponding color. The genes with names
  in red are present in more than one significant pathway. The genes shown in the
  V-shaped box are transcription factors. The pathway maps generated separately for
  each of the seed genes (Ctnnb1, Ptger2, and Ptgs2) are shown in Supplemental Figs.
  S1–S3.
