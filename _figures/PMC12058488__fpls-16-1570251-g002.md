caption: The effects of plant hormones on cotton fiber development. In the diagram,
  promoting effects are indicated by arrows, whereas inhibitory effects are represented
  using lines ending with blunt tips. The yellow line indicates the inactivation pathway,
  the green line indicates the synthesis pathway, the black line indicates the regulation
  pathway, and the red line indicates the suppression pathway. The figure is modified
  from reference (Jan et al., 2022)
