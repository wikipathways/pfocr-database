caption: Red color indicates down regulated genes and green color indicates up-regulated
  genes. Intensity of the colors indicates the fold change. Circle represents the
  fold change under non-inoculated and incubated, condition (I-NI) a. The square represents
  the fold change under inoculated, incubated (I-I) b conditions. The recognition
  of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) initiate PAMP trigger immunity via
  the activation of cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase (CRK), cyclic nucleotide
  gated channel (CNGC), calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK), respiratory burst
  oxidase homolog (Rboh), calcium-binding protein CML (CaM/CML), and NADPH oxidase.
  The activation of PAMP trigger immunity initiate the production of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), which might activate the plant hypersensitive response (HR), cell
  wall reinforcement, as well as stomata closure. Defense responses are also instigated
  upon recognition of the fungal effectors in the host cell by serine/threonine-protein
  kinase PBS (PBS) and the activation of MAP kinase cascades such as mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK),
  and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Effectors triggered immunity (ETI)
  initiate the production of several pathogen related proteins such as PR-1, β-1,3-glucanase
  (PR-2), chitinase II/V (PR-3), thaumatin-like (PR-5), and lipid-transfer protein
  (PR-14). Both PAMP triggered immunity and effectors triggered immunity alternate
  the production of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) by the action of distinct
  transcription factors WRKY such as WRKY 75, WRKY 70, WRKY 18, and WRKY 33. Pathogen-triggered
  SA signaling also by the activation of serine/threonine-protein kinase2 (SRK2),
  auxin receptors, and abscisic acid responsive element binding factor (ABF).
