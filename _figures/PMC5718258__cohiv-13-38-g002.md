caption: Lower microbial diversity and dysregulated bacterial metabolic pathways accentuate
  systemic inflammation in HIV infection. Panel (a) under steady state conditions,
  gut lumen contains a significant diversity of bacterial communities that differ
  between individuals but remain relatively stable within single individual. Intact
  gut epithelium together with normal innate responses mediated by macrophages and
  dendritic cells, as well as with the Th17 normal T-cell functions (production of
  IL-17A and IL-17F, IL-22 and induction of antimicrobial proteins such as defensins),
  protects against microbial translocation and further inflammation. Panel (b) under
  HIV infection, gut epithelium integrity is compromised by epithelial cell death
  through apoptosis [] and weakened tight junctions between cells [] thus leading
  to enhanced translocation of microbes and microbial products. Together with the
  HIV-mediated depletion of Th17 cells [] and enhanced expression of cytokines such
  as IL-32 [] that amplifies the inflammatory process, this induces a persistent activation
  of immune cells and high levels of inflammatory cytokines in circulation. The compromised
  gut immune response is associated with a decrease in the diversity of microbiota
  composition and a dysregulated metabolism (lower production of certain amino acids
  such as proline, phenylalanine and lysine and accelerated catabolism of others such
  as tryptophan) []. Accelerated tryptophan catabolism leads to increase in the kynurenine
  pathway, which is involved in the decrease of Th17 cell levels, thus further promoting
  a biased mucosal immunity. Dysregulated microbial metabolism also leads to increase
  in the trimethylamine [], a precursor for trimethylamine-N-oxide, a molecule involved
  in thrombosis risk []. Ag, antigen; DC, dendritic cells; EC, epithelial cells.
