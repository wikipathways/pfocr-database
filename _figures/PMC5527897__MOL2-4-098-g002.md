caption: N‐linked glycosylation. (For symbol explanation, see ) A) Initial steps of
  N‐glycan synthesis pathway. First, two GlcNAcs are added to the Dol‐PP anchor in
  the outer leaflet of ER's lipid membrane. Further, five mannose saccharides are
  attached to the structure. This precursor located in cytosol, is now flipped by
  a yet not fully elucidated mechanism to the inner leaflet. For the rest of the synthesis
  process, this glycan structure is situated inside the ER lumen. Here, four more
  mannoses as well as three glucoses are added to create the mature N‐glycan precursor.
  Genes encoding transferases that are responsible for these reactions are designated
  ALG (asparagine‐linked glycosylation). The mature precursor is then detached from
  its dolichol anchor and transferred to a target polypeptide sequence co‐translationally
  by the large enzyme complex, OST (modified from ). B) N‐glycan branching. After
  being transferred to a protein, the N‐glycan goes through glucose and mannose trimming,
  the former being involved in polypeptide folding quality control. The resulting
  Man5GlcNAc2 structure may be branched – a process mediated by the Mgat family of
  GlcNAc‐transferases. Up to four branches can be added by Mgat1, ‐2, ‐4 and 5 respectively
  and further elongated (orange arrows). Of these, Mgat5 appears to be the most interesting
  in carcinogenesis; the branch it initiates is preferentially elongated by polylactosamine.
  In addition to the four previously mentioned branches a so‐called bisecting β‐3
  branch may be added by Mgat3. This bisecting GlcNAc terminates all further branching,
  including that mediated by Mgat5. Thus, activity of Mgat3 might inhibit polylactosamine
  synthesis. The two key reactions, performed by Mgat3 and Mgat5, are highlighted
  in red. The Mgat transferases require UDP‐GlcNAc which is imported through a transporter
  (SLC35A3). Genes encoding relevant transferases are displayed in black italic font
  (modified from ). C) Core fucosylation. This is one of the possible modifications
  made to N‐glycans' core structure.
