caption: Proposed model for mechanisms underlying dysruption of the GA during HSV-1
  neuronal infection. Alteration of the normal neuronal GA morphology by HSV-1 involves
  the activation of Src kinase signaling induced by the interaction of HSV-1 with
  cellular receptor(s). The prolonged activation of Src kinase activity during HSV-1
  early infection triggers phosphorylation of Dyn2 (Tyr231), enhancement of Dyn2 assembly
  and GTPase activity at the GA. High Dyn2 activity induces membrane vesiculation,
  affecting GA morphology and function. In addition, assembly of HSV-1 virions ends
  with the acquisition of the viral envelope at the cis-Golgi, followed by their release
  from vesicles that emerge from the trans-Golgi network. We propose that activation
  of Src kinase and Dyn2 at the GA perturbs Golgi integrity affecting the secretory
  pathway in neurons. Consequently, alteration of the normal secretory pathway could
  impair and compromise neuronal function, and thereby contribute to neurodegenerative
  disorders development. L, ligands; R, cellular receptor; PM, plasma membrane; AF,
