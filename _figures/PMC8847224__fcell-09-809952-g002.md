caption: 'Regulation mechanism diagram of NF-κB pathway. (A) Canonical NF-κB signaling
  pathway. The classical pathway is triggered by TNFα, IL-1, or LPS, and subsequently
  activates the IκK complex, which induces phosphorylation of IκBα and promotes its
  degradation. This leads to the release of the NF-κB heterodimer RelA/p50, which
  then translocates to the nucleus and induces the transcription of target genes.
  (B) Non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. This pathway is activated by CD40L, LTβR,
  RANKL and BAFF gene, and mediated by NIK and the IκK complex containing two IκKα
  subunits, but not NEMO. In the non-canonical pathway, receptor binding leads to
  activation of the NF-κB-inducible kinase NIK, which phosphorylates and activates
  the IκKα complex, which in turn phosphorylates two serine residues adjacent to the
  C-terminal IκB domain of the p100 ankyrin repeat, resulting in its partial proteolysis
  and release of the p52/RelB complex. Abbreviations: NF-κB, Nuclear Factor-kappa
  B; TNFα: tumor necrosis factor α; IL-1: interleukin-1; LPS: lipopolysaccharide;
  IκB, an inhibitor of κB; IκK, IκB kinase; CD40L, CD40 ligand; RANKL, receptor activator
  of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand; LTβR, lymphotoxin beta; BAFF, B cell-activating
  factor; NIK, NF-κB inducing kinase.'
