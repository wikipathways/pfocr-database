  AMSC-EV and HUMSC-EV improve photoaging in UVB-irradiated nude mice, HaCaTs, HKCs,
  HDFs, and T-Skin models through anti-inflammatory effects, ECM remodeling, and anti-senescence
  properties. Mechanistically, proteomic analysis revealed that TIMP1 is highly expressed
  in both AMSC-EV and HUMSC-EV and exerts similar effects to MSC-EV. TIMP1 inhibits
  MMPs, thereby altering extracellular matrix remodeling. Additionally, TIMP1 downregulates
  the activated Notch pathway and inhibits its downstream targets Hes1, P16, P21,
  and P53
