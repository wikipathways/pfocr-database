caption: The genes identified from the enrichment analysis were significantly associated
  with OSA comorbidities. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to create gene-disease
  network. The selected candidate genes (n = 23) were significantly associated with
  anxiety disorders (2.8E−24), obesity (1.65E−23), obsessive-compulsive disorder (8.77E−21),
  dyslipidemia (5.87E−20), social anxiety disorder (1.28E−18), type 2 diabetes (5.14E−18),
  blood pressure (3.25E−17), eating disorder (3.75E−15), depression (3.61E−14), and
  metabolic syndrome (1.10E−13).
