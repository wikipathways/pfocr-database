caption: Mitochondrial function, features associated with mitochondrial disease and
  the features and consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction in autism spectrum disorder
  (ASD). The top panel outlines some of the features and metabolic markers used to
  diagnose mitochondrial disease. The features are divided up into those that are
  not typically clinically abnormal in ASD and those found to be clinically abnormal
  in some individuals with ASD. Features in which the association with ASD is unclear
  are not listed in this panel. The mitochondrion is represented diagrammatically
  in the middle of the figure. Glucose and fatty acids are processed through separate
  but overlapping pathways to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The fatty acid
  oxidation pathway, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex are located within the mitochondrion matrix which is located inside the
  inner mitochondrial membrane. Long chain fatty acids require the carnitine shuttle
  to enter the mitochondrial matrix while medium and short chain fatty acids do not
  require the carnitine shuttle. One of the enzymes for the TCA cycle, succinate dehydrogenase,
  is complex II of the electron transport chain (ETC). Electron carriers, NADH and
  FADH2, transfer energy from the TCA cycle and fatty acid oxidation pathway to the
  ETC. The ETC is the final common pathway for the generation of ATP from adenosine
  diphosphate (ADP). The bottom panel lists some of the physiological consequences
  of mitochondrial dysfunction.
