caption: Schematic illustration showing A20 regulation on Nrdp1-dependent signaling
  pathways. The black arrow indicates the known inflammatory signaling pathway, while
  the red line illustrates the inflammatory signaling pathway regulated by Nrdp1 interaction
  with A20. Our study reveal that A20 inhibits inflammation through two ways. On one
  hand, A20 promoted the polyubiquitination of Nrdp1 and then induces the degradation
  of MyD88, inhibits the activation of NF-κB through downregulation of TRAF6. On the
  other hand, A20 may also promote the deubiquitination of Nrdp1 and then deactivates
  TBK1, inhibits the secretion of IFN-β through downregulation of IRF3.
