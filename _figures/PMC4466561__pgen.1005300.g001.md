caption: 'Shown in red are: 1. loss-of-function mutation of the JA synthesis gene
  allene oxide synthase (aos); 2. treatment with exogenous JA; 3. loss-of-function
  mutations in the negative regulator NINJA; 4. gain-of-function mutation of MYC transcription
  factors. The dashed box surrounding MYC indicates that it is conceptually possible
  to use an overactive MYC to drive JA responses in the absence of JA synthesis (step
  1) and of negative regulators like NINJA (steps 1 and 3 combined). This was achieved
  using a novel myc2 mutant that amplifies JA responses.'
