caption: Effect of different rates of Warburg effect on tumor features. (Upper part)
  shows Warburg phenomenon cancer cells in different rates of aerobic glycolysis.
  In Warburg phenomenon tumor cells, mitochondria are inactive due to defects in their
  functions. So, in order to generate sufficient energy, they must uptake glucose
  with the highest possible rate and generate pyruvate/lactate through aerobic glycolysis
  pathway in normal glucose (or normoxia) condition. The high concentration of pyruvate
  leads to a decrease of PHD enzyme activity and consequently HIF-1α stabilization
  and increase in its transcription activity of tumor invasion genes like VEGF. In
  other hand, due to these cells uptake the glucose and generate pyruvate/lactate
  with the highest possible rate, inducing conditions like HG and hypoxia could not
  significant affect them in regard to Warburg effect. When they expose to 2-DG, as
  a glucose analog, they uptake vast 2-DG molecules leads to inhibit aerobic glycolysis
  pathway dramatically. Diminishing pyruvate leads to increase of PHD enzyme activity
  and consequently HIF-1α degradation and tumor regression. (Lower part) shows oxidative
  cancer cells in different rates of aerobic glycolysis. In oxidative tumor cells,
  mitochondria are active and so, the most energy is generated through oxidative phosphorylation.
  However, this amount of accumulated pyruvate leads to a minuscule decrease of PHD
  activity and consequently HIF-1α stabilization (as well as other pathways in tumor
  cells for HIF-1α stabilization). In contrast, in inducing conditions like HG and
  hypoxia, these cells show Warburg phenomenon through increasing of glucose uptake,
  inactivation of mitochondria and increase rate of aerobic glycolysis with high production
  of pyruvate/lactate. Like Warburg phenomenon tumor cells, the high concentration
  of pyruvate leads to decrease of PHD enzyme activity and consequently HIF-1α stabilization.
  Regarding 2-DG condition, oxidative tumor cells, in compare to Warburg phenomenon
  tumor cells, have lower rate of glucose uptake. So, oxidative tumor cells are lowery
  affected by 2-DG
