caption: Pictorial representation of altered GABA receptor signaling due to PCP-SI
  treatment. The proteins highlighted (filled circle over-written with name as text)
  correspond with mRNA levels found to be differentially expressed in PCP-SI rats
  following microarray analysis, all of which were identified as being down-regulated
  (see ). Figure generated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity Systems
  Inc., QIAGEN). PCP-SI, phencyclidine-treated pups housed alone in social isolation.
