caption: A model for the BRCA2/RAD51 pathway in the response to stalled forks. After
  their recruitment by BRCA1/MRN, BRCA2/RAD51 complexes may act in concert to (i)
  disassemble chromatin (A); (ii) maintain SCC/alignment (B); (iii) effectuate strand-switching
  and thereby recruit/activate ATR to enhance SCC/alignment (C); (iv) provide one
  DSB end, and thereby activate ATM and DNA-PK (D); and (v) twist the DSB end after
  its processing at least by error-free TLS polymerases into leading and lagging strands
  that would anneal back with the original templates, and thereby yield a hemicatenane
  (E). If needed, the harmless DSB end (D and F) may engage in HR, NHEJ or SSA between
  neighbouring stalled forks during termination of the replication (S) phase (not
  shown). By interfering with ATR recruitment/activation, short EMSY could induce
  RFR (RAD51-independent HR) and chicken-foot formation (F). HJ-resolving enzymes
  against crossover, such as BLM and WRN, may prevent fork collapse (G) by competing
  with HJ-nicking enzymes (red arrows) at the expense of CIN. Unlike hyper-recombination,
  BRCA2/RAD51-mediated strand switching at either stalled forks (hemicatenation/RFR)
  or DSBs does not require RAD51-filament formation, in which case the fourfold decrease
  in HR repair of I-SceI-induced DSBs by short EMSY could be attributed to apoptosis/senescence
  rather than decreased efficiency of strand switching. Consistently, meiotic HR does
  not require the loading of RAD51 oligomers by BRCA2 at programmed DSBs, since BRCA2∆ex27
  KO mice are as fertile as wild-type animals, except that they exhibit hypersensitivity
  to IR, senescence and reduced life span. Thus, whereas BRCA2/RAD51-mediated strand
  switching ensures survival, maintains chromosomal stability and acts as an anti-cancer
  barrier, SCRS and RAD51-mediated strand exchange/invasion can compete with RFR for
  ssDNA and thereby decrease the likelihood of forks collapse at the expense of CIN
  and human diseases. Only abnormally proliferating cells crippled in an essential
  gene are prone to gene mutation/reversion and fork collapse
