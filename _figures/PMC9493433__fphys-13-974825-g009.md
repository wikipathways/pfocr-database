caption: Schematic illustration of the mechanism of activated AMPK prevents the occurrence
  and development of FLHS. The mitigative effect of activated AMPK signal on the lipid
  metabolism disorder, oxidative stress and inflammatory response trigerred by PO-stimualtion
  is mainly achieved through the activation of NRF-2 signaling pathway and the inhibition
  of NF-κB signaling pathway in primary chicken hepatocytes; which implied that AMPK
  may be a potential target factor for the prevention of FLHS occurrence in laying
  hens.
