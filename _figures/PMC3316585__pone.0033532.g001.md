caption: 'The TLR2/4 signalling pathway starts with recognition (1) of PAMPs by TLRs.
  This activates (2) BTK which phosphorylates (3) MAL. MyD88 adapter protein and kinases
  are recruited (4) and activated around MAL. This eventually leads to the activation
  (5) of NF-B as IB is degraded. The proinflammatory cytokine genes are expressed
  (6) producing INCY that are secreted (7). INCY are responsible (8) for the production
  of inflammation and activation of their respective receptors. This again activates
  NF- B (9a) and through an alternate pathway induces the production of SOCS-1 (9b).
  SOCS-1 negatively regulates MAL by polyubiquitination (10a) and blocks NF- B mediated
  expression (10b). Abbreviations: TLR, toll like receptors; PAMPs, pathogen associated
  molecular patterns; BTK, bruton''s tyrosine kinase; MAL, MyD88 adapter like; MyD88,
  myeloid differentiation response protein; NF-B, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; IB, inhibitor of B; INCY, proinflammatory cytokines; SOCS-1,
  suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 , , .'
