caption: Toll-Like Receptors (TLR) signaling pathway involved in RSV and hMPV-induced
  gene expression. Binding to viral protein at the cell surface (TLR 2/6 and 4) or
  viral RNA in intracellular compartments (TLR 3 and 7/8) leads to activation of NF-κB-
  and IRF-dependent gene expression by engaging the adaptors (MyD88 and/or TRIF).
  P indicates phosphorylation.
