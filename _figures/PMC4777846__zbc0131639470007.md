caption: A schematic diagram of LRP1/Wnt5a-dependent inhibition of intracellular cholesterol
  accumulation. TGFβ through the LRP1 extracellular domain positively regulates a
  canonical Wnt5a signaling pathway. Wnt5a stimulates ABCG1-mediated cholesterol export.
  Wnt5a also inhibits SREBP-2 processing and cholesterol biosynthesis. Furthermore,
  the tail of LRP1 independently of Wnt5a blocks cholesterol accumulation through
  the binding of Erk2 to the second NPXY motif and the concomitant stimulation of
  ABCA1 and NCEH1 expressions. The synergy of the mechanisms that signal through both
  the extracellular domain and the cytoplasmic tail of LRP1 limits cholesterol intracellular
  accumulation. Conversely, in the absence of LRP1, Wnt5a is down-regulated, and cells
  accumulate cholesterol.
