caption: Biochemical profiling of CSF identified substantial increases of phenylalanine
  and phenyllactate and decreased homovanillate (HVA) in a pathway where the activity
  of the tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) was
  disrupted due to dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency.
