caption: The small intestinal response to radiation is altered by signaling induced
  by luminal bacteria or bacterial-based products. Experimental models and human trials
  suggest Lactobacillus species or their soluble secreted proteins alone may protect
  intestinal crypts against damage from radiation exposure [,]. Flagellin, a TLR5
  ligand that activates the NF-κB pathway, protected IECs from radiation-induced apoptosis
  and increased host survival when injected into mice before lethal doses of radiation
  []. LPS, a TLR4 ligand that is found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria,
  increased both endogenous intestinal prostaglandin production and intestinal crypt
  survival in mice exposed to 14-Gy radiation when injected parenterally 2–24 h prior
  to exposure []. Endogenous PGE2 has been shown to decrease murine IEC apoptosis
  and increase IEC proliferation in response to radiation []. Conversely, blocking
  pathways that are activated by bacterial products have been shown to have detrimental
  effects on the ability of IECs and crypts to survive radiation insults. The E. coli
  STa is a ligand for GC-C, an IEC transmembrane receptor. UGN is a peptide hormone
  that binds to and activates GC-C. Mice in which GC-C or UGN is knocked out have
  increased jejunal IEC apoptosis 3 h after 5-Gy radiation as compared with wild-type
  counterparts []. Indomethacin blocks PGE2 production by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2,
  thereby increasing IEC apoptosis and intestinal crypt ablation []. Similarly, irradiated
  COX-1−/− mice have diminished PGE2synthesis, leading to increased crypt epithelial
  apoptosis and decreased clonogenic stem cell survival []. Irradiated EP2 receptor−/−
  mice also have decreased intestinal crypt survival and a 1.6-fold increase in IEC
  apoptosis []. Blocking NF-κB activation by deleting the p50 subunit of the NF-κB
  complex [] or the canonical NF-κB activation kinase [] results in increased radiation-induced
  IEC apoptosis in mice. Although debate still exists as to the degree of importance
  of endothelial apoptosis in acute intestinal outcomes after high-dose radiation
  exposure [,], endothelial apoptosis is shown to be lower in germ-free than conventionally
  raised mice []. COX, cyclooxygenase; E. coli STa, heat-stable enterotoxin of Escherichia
