caption: The regulation of TGF-β via canonical and non-canonical pathways. In the
  canonical pathway, binding of TGF-β ligand to TGF-βR induces the phosphorylation
  of SMAD2/3. Phosphorylated SMAD2/3 forms a complex with SMAD4 and then translocates
  to the nucleus. Once it enters the nucleus, the SMAD2/3–SMAD4 complex binds to other
  transcriptional co-factors, which initiates the transcription of TGF-β target genes
  and the expression of SMAD7. SMAD7 recruits SMURF1 and SMURF2 to the TGF-βR and
  induces its proteasome-dependent degradation, which eventually weakens the TGF-β
  signaling. Inside the nucleus, the linker region of SMAD2/3 is phosphorylated by
  CDK8 and CDK9, enhancing the TGF-β signaling by promoting the binding of SMAD2/3
  to other transcriptional coactivators. The GSK-3β-phosphorylated SMAD2/3 can be
  recognized by NEDD4-L and then undergo the ubiquitin-mediated degradation, thereby
  attenuating the TGF-β signaling. In the non-canonical pathway, binding of the TGF-β
  ligand to its receptor promotes the binding of TRAF6 to the TGF-βRs. TRAF6-induced
  autoubiquitylation of TGF-βRs activates TAK1, which further triggers the downstream
  p38 and JNK pathways. TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; TGF-βR, TGF-β receptor;
