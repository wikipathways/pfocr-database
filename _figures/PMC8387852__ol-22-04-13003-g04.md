caption: 'Genes regulated by CGA. In the present study, miR-31 was quantified after
  treatment with CGA, which modifies its expression levels, as well as that of other
  biomarkers. miR-31 is an oncogene. It has been reported that other oncological biomarkers
  can be regulated through CGA: miR-155 modulates apoptosis. miR-144-3p is a tumor
  suppressor. BAX is an inducer of apoptosis. JNK participates in the programmed cell
  death pathway. Apocynin is a NADPH oxidase inhibitor. SOX2 participates in several
  stages of embryonic development. miR, microRNA; CGA, chlorogenic acid.'
