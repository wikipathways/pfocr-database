caption: Schwann cell laminins influence multiple cellular events that are necessary
  for normal Schwann cell development, including survival, proliferation, radial sorting,
  and myelin wrapping. Laminin β1-subunit containing integrin receptors (here, primarily
  α6β1) influence the PI3K/Akt pathway by way of ILK to promote Schwann cell survival.
  Laminins also influence proliferation downstream of FAK and cdc42, although it remains
  unclear which laminin receptor(s) may be responsible for this effect. Laminin-regulated
  integrin signaling critically modulates ILK activity, the PI3K pathway, and small
  Rho family GTPases (activating Rac1 and suppressing RhoA), to control the complex
  axon-glial interactions that mediate radial sorting. Finally, integrins influence
  myelin wrapping itself, at least in part by enhancing the activities of the PI3K/Akt
  pathway, Rac1, and cdc42. Dystroglycan also contributes positively to myelin wrapping
  but the signaling effectors remain unknown. Dystroglycan, together with α6β4 integrin,
  is necessary for myelin stability, although the downstream signaling pathways required
  for myelin maintenance remain unknown.
