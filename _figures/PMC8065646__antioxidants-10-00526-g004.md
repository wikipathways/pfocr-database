caption: Redox targets within insulin secretory pathway and proteins involved in extracellular
  redox signaling. Glucose entry through GLUT1 in humans or GLUT2 in rodents causes
  an increase in ATP/ADP ratio and elevation of ROS production in the cytoplasm (mediated
  by NOX4). Subsequently, the KATP channel closes, which causes depolarization of
  the plasma membrane, the opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) and
  Ca2+ entry into the cells. Ca2+ is required for insulin granule vesicles (IGV) trafficking,
  attachment and fusion with the plasma membrane (mediated by SNARE proteins) and
  finally, secretion of insulin from the cell. Repolarization of the membrane is mediated
  via voltage-gated K+ channels (KV). These repeating cycles lead to a high-frequency
  of action potential spikes and synchronized oscillations in the cytosolic Ca2+.
  ROS are utilized by redox-regulated proteins TRX, GPX and PRX, which can either
  neutralize the ROS action in the long-term or transform acute redox signal via redox
  relays. Targets of redox signaling involve KATP channels, VDCC, KV channels and
  proteins involved in granule exocytosis. TRX1 and PDIs are secreted from β-cells,
  and they interact with extracellular domains of transmembrane proteins. PDIs regulate
  the action of sheddase ADAM17, and TRX1 modifies the activity of integrins and TRPC1/5
  channels.
