caption: 'Major pathways involved in bilirubin production, conjugation, and excretion.Notes:
  Both the UB and CB forms are bound by albumin in the plasma and interstitial space
  and by ligandin in the hepatocyte. The mechanism responsible for transporting unconjugated
  bilirubin into the hepatocyte has not been identified. Bilirubin is conjugated in
  the liver by the UGT family of enzymes. CB is secreted into the bile by the ATP-coupled
  ABCC2/MRP2 transporter. CB can be recycled from the hepatocyte to plasma, leaving
  via, eg, the ABCC3/MRP3 transporter, and taken up by the OATP transport proteins.
  Renal excretion of CB can become important in obstructive diseases. The terms in
  red refer to the pathological conditions that influence the different pathways.
  The solid arrows represent the normal physiological pathways. The black dashed arrows
  indicate the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin, which may occur in certain
  pathological conditions. The green dashed arrows indicate a possible UB excretory
  pathway that may be important in conditions of severe hyperbilirubinemia.Abbreviations:
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CB, conjugated bilirubin; GI, gastrointestinal; UB,
  unconjugated bilirubin; UGT, uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase; ??, the mechanism
  is unknown.'
