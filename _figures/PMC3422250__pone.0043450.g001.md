caption: 'The GRN model is divided into two components: leaf and shoot apical meristem
  (SAM). It includes several pathways: light transduction, circadian clock, photoperiod,
  autonomous, aging, GA pathways and pathway integration. Thick lines are confirmed
  by genetic analysis. Thin lines are based on comparative genomics. Arrows between
  genes stand for promotion or activation. T bars between genes stand for inhibition
  or suppression. Dashed lines stand for putative relationships derived through comparative
  genomics. Genes highlighted in yellow background are selected for the DGN modeling.'
