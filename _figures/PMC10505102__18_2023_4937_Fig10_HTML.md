caption: 'Schematic representation of molecular events in aM1-mediated glucose uptake
  by insulin-resistant cells. Insulin binding to the insulin receptor activates insulin
  receptor kinase, which in turn activates IRS1/2, PI3K, and Akt. Activated Akt further
  triggers GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane and initiates glucose internalization.
  In insulin-resistant cells, accumulation of intracellular lipid (ICL) activates
  the DAG-PKCθ axis and impairs insulin signaling by degrading IRS1/2 and PI3K/Akt
  pathway proteins. aM1 enters cells through endocytosis, activates the PI3K/Akt pathway,
  and promotes glucose uptake. In insulin-resistant cells, aM1 inhibits ICL accumulation
  by restoring lipid homeostasis, further blocking activation of the DAG-PKCθ axis.
  Finally, aM1 prevents IRS degradation and restores insulin signaling. IRS1/2 insulin
  receptor substrate 1/2, DAG diacylglycerol, PKCθ: protein kinase C-theta, PI3K phosphoinositide
  3-kinase, Akt protein kinase B, ICL intracellular lipid, GLUT4 glucose transporter
