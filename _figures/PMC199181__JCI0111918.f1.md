caption: The biochemistry of NF-κB activation. NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm
  by the inhibitory IκB proteins. Stimulation by a diverse array of pathogens and
  other inducers including viruses, cytokines, and stress-inducing agents leads to
  the activation of signaling cascades that culminate with the activation of the IKK
  complex and phosphorylation of the IκB inhibitor. NF-κB DNA binding subunits are
  released and translocate to the nucleus where they transactivate NF-κB responsive
  genes containing the decameric sequence (5′-GGGRNNYYCC-3′). Target genes are selectively
  regulated by the distinct transcriptional activation potential of different NF-κB
  subunit combinations. TBP, TATA binding protein.
