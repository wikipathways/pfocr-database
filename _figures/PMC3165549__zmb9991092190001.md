caption: CK2 regulates ERK nuclear import. In the absence of growth-promoting signals,
  ERK mainly resides in the cytoplasm associated with MEK and other anchoring proteins.
  Growth signals stimulate the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway, leading to the phosphorylation
  of the ERK activation loop and its dissociation from the anchoring proteins. This
  allows CK2 to phosphorylate the ERK NTS, which provides a binding site for Imp7.
  The ERK-Imp7 complex is imported into the nucleus, where ERK targets its nuclear
  substrates, including transcriptional regulatory proteins.
