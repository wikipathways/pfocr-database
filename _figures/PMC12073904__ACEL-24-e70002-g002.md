caption: Mechanistic model of inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuromuscular
  junction characteristics of HF and LF octogenarians. (Right). Each participant has
  an inflammatory score assigned from 114 immune pathway proteins correlated with
  the physical functioning group, which showed a high pro‐inflammatory profile in
  LF. Skeletal muscle OXPHOS score correlation with serum inflammatory score is shown.
  HF octogenarians have low inflammatory profile with better OXPHOS score while NF
  has low OXPHOS function and high inflammatory profile. Higher abundance of Agrin
  associated with higher inflammatory profile. Each participant is represented as
  a gray circle and a blue/red regression line with confidence interval. Spearman's
  rank correlation p‐value is shown at the bottom of the graph
