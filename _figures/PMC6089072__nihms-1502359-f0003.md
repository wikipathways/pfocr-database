caption: Methods for observation and quantification of apoptosis. (A) The intrinsic
  and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis are triggered by different lethal stimuli but
  converge on the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7. (B) BH3 profiling measures
  the apoptotic priming of cells by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential after
  the addition of a BH3 peptide, which induces MOMP more readily in highly primed
  cells, resulting in decreased JC-1 fluorescence. (C) Reporters for various intermediate
  steps in the execution of the apoptotic pathway reveal the kinetics of these death
  mechanisms. For example, reporters for MOMP and effector caspase activity reveal
  that heterogeneity in death kinetics after application of TRAIL is attributable
  to cell-to-cell differences in time to MOMP, whereas time from MOMP to caspase-3
  activation is highly homogeneous. Caspase activity can be measured by Förster resonance
  energy transfer (FRET) reporters that contain peptide sequences that are recognized
  and cleaved by caspases. (D) The CaspaseTracker system allows for the identification
  of cells that have undergone anastasis and their descendants. Caspase activity activates
  FLPase, which irreversibly induces the expression of GFP. All cells expressing GFP
  have therefore either survived caspase activation by undergoing anastasis themselves
  or are descended from another anastatic cell. Analysis of Drosophila expressing
  the CaspaseTracker reporter reveals a high frequency of anastasis in vivo over the
  course of development.
