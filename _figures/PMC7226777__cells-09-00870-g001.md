caption: 'Principal functions of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO): initiation
  of programmed cell death, including apoptosis, as well as regulation of the cell’s
  nuclear gene expression. This figure presents an overview of the cellular pathways
  influenced by TSPO. TSPO favors neurosteroid synthesis by transporting cholesterol
  over the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore,
  it modulates ATP synthase activity, thus initiating reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  production, which can result in cardiolipin oxidation and opening of the mitochondrial
  permeability transition pore (mPTP). Opening of the mPTP allows for ATP and Ca2+
  release, and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. This depolarization results
  in opening of the Bax/Bak channel, allowing for the passage of cytochrome c into
  the cytosol as an initiating step for the mitochondrial apoptosis cascade. The mitochondrial
  ROS generation and ATP and Ca2+ release are also considered part of the mitochondria-to-nucleus
  pathway of cell nuclear gene expression modulation, which includes the modulation
  of hundreds to thousands of genes (see also [,,,]).'
