caption: Schematic diagram showing the mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects
  of Poncirin. Poncirin induced apoptosis by up-regulating FasL, and then activated
  caspase-8 and -3, which subsequently activated cleavage of PARP and DNA fragmentation.
  Poncirin does not alter MMP (ΔΨm) and mitochondrial regulatory proteins in AGS cells.
  Taken together, this study suggests that Poncirin induced apoptosis through extrinsic
  pathways in AGS cells, which is independent of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
  (→ indicates activation,  indicates inhibition, --- indicates indirect or multiple
  pathways, × indicates pathway blocked).
