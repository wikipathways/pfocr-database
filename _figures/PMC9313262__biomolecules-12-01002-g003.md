caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of deregulated proteins related to hepatocyte
  growth factor (HGF) signaling in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) treated with Endoret
  serum (ES) extract. (A) The IPA upstream regulator analysis suggested that several
  HDF proteins deregulated in the ES treatment were related to the activation by HGF.
  IPA downstream analysis also showed that numerous deregulated proteins were associated
  with an induction of (B) fibroblast proliferation and (C) protein synthesis of HDFs
  treated with ES. Finally, when the upstream and downstream processes were correlated,
  certain relationships were observed for ES-treated HDFs, such as HGF with an induction
  of (D) fibroblast proliferation and (E) protein synthesis.
