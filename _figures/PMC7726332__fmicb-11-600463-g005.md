caption: Model for the transcriptional response of G. sulfurreducens during growth
  under CoII stress. The figure illustrates pathways (upregulated, gold; downregulated,
  blue) differentially expressed under CoII stress. Proteins in gray represent proteins
  predicted to participate in the detoxification pathways that did not undergo differential
  expression. Additional information for the proteins and encoding genes is available
