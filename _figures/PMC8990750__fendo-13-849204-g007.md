caption: The vicious cycle of inflammation and ER stress accelerates the progression
  of diabetes in Wolfram syndrome. Schematic of the relationship between ER stress
  and sterile inflammation in Wolfram syndrome (WS). Diabetes in WS is caused by terminal
  ER stress-induced pancreatic β-cell apoptosis. Hyperglycemic conditions of WFS1-deficient
  pancreatic β-cells enhance terminal ER stress and induce sterile inflammation. Experimental
  high-glucose condition induces pro-inflammatory cytokine gene transcription via
  the PERK pathway and enhances TXNIP-mediated IL-1β processing through the PERK and
  IRE1α pathways. This high-cytokine condition accelerates ER stress-mediated cell
  death and upregulates the pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in WFS1-deficient
  pancreatic β-cells. Secreted chemokines or the hypervascularized environment in
  the WS islets may cause cell-nonautonomous pancreatic β-cell inflammation, including
  M1-macrophage infiltration.
