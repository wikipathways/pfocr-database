caption: Schematic view of the prepenetration apparatus (PPA) molecular background,
  as deduced from the presented results. In the presence of an AM fungal contact and
  after the perception of a putative fungal factor (FF), Exp-like and Nod-like are
  weakly activated independent of DMI3, a key component of the SYM signalling pathway.
  DMI3 activity, by contrast, further upregulates Exp-like and Nod-like, represses
  ACRE264 and is required for PPA assembly.
