caption: Primary nodes of signalling activity downstream of T cell receptor (TCR)–CD3
  and CD28 and inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS) co-stimulatory receptors overlap
  significantly. CD28 associates with proximal signalling molecules through the YMNM
  and PYAP motifs to co-stimulate several major signalling nodes, leading to activation
  of distal pathways involved in cell growth, activation of effector function and
  survival. ICOS lacks a PYAP motif but contains a YMFM motif that recruits the more
  active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) subunit p50α (indicated by a thick arrow),
  thus leading to enhanced AKT signalling. ICOS also induces interleukin-4 (IL-4)
  through a C-MAF pathway. Co-inhibitory signalling downstream of B and T lymphocyte
  attenuator (BTLA), programmed cell death 1 (PD1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen
  4 (CTLA4) suppresses T cell activation and function through the recruitment of the
  phosphatases SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP1), SHP2 and serine/threonine
  protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). These phosphatases dephosphorylate several of the
  major signalling nodes that are essential for co-stimulation of T cells. PD1 has
  also been shown to inhibit the RAS–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway.
  Additional co-inhibitory pathways have been posited for CTLA4, PD1 and BTLA. BTLA
  and CTLA4 may also transduce positive signals in some contexts. BTLA may associate
  with growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) to activate PI3K and promote
  T cell survival, whereas CTLA4 may also activate PI3K through a YVKM motif. AP,
  activator protein; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;
  NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; PKCθ, protein kinase Cθ; PLCγ, phospholipase
  Cγ.
