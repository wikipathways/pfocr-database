caption: Model of p66ShcA-mediated feed forward pathway of mitochondrial ROS and neurodegeneration
  in MS. Under normal cellular conditions, p66ShcA is sequestered by Prx1 in an inactive
  form. Under the excessive cellular stressors associated with MS disease processes,
  p66ShcA is disassociated from Prx1 and is serine phosphorylated by PKC-β. Phosphorylated
  p66ShcA forms a complex with Pin1 isomerase, which leads to p66ShcA translocation
  into the intermitochondrial space (IMS). There, p66ShcA oxidizes cytochrome c and
  reduces oxygen to form mitochondrial ROS, which induces opening of the mitochondrial
  PTP. PTP opening subsequently induces the influx of solutes into the mitochondrial
  matrix resulting in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and equilibrium of
  ionic gradients, which can prevent ATP synthesis, and promote matrix expansion,
  mitochondrial swelling, and membrane rupture leading to release of cytochrome c
  into the axoplasm and eventual neuronal death. Importantly, p66ShcA is part of a
  positive feed-forward signaling pathway that further elevates oxidative stress levels
  and activates mitochondria-mediated neuronal death.
