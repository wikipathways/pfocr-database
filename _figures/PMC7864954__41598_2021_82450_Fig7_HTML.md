caption: Proposed model for flooding tolerance in alfalfa. In flooding-tolerant cultivars,
  ABA is induced upon FS triggering PYL/PYR9 signaling molecules. This signaling pathway
  induces ABI2 and ABI5 while reducing the phosphorylated PP2C for increased expression
  of ABA-responsive elements, ABRE. ABA also induces a REM protein kinase SnRK1 along
  with its α and β subunits (KIN10 and KIN11) through ABI5. The increased expression
  of SnRK1 may trigger miR156 and channels resources towards the phenylpropanoid pathway.
  Induced miR156 expression silences SPL13, to mediate anthocyanin biosynthesis by
  its interaction with DFR, and other SPLs (SPL4, 7a, 8, 9 and 13a). The increased
  abundance of ABA metabolites antagonistically affects gibberellic acid, cytokinin
  and auxin hormones. To exploit the newly identified SPLs (1, 1a, 2a, 7, 7a, 8, 13a,
  14 and 16) in alfalfa breeding, it will be necessary to investigate their functional
  roles individually and in combination in response to FS and other physiological
  responses.
