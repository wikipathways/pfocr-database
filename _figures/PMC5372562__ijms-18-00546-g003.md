caption: The interaction and localization of proteins, belonging to the angiopoietin
  signaling pathway and found in samples 2 and/or 3. All proteins marked by a uniform
  green or blue rim were found in samples 2 and 3, while the proteins of CHUK, IKBKB,
  BIRC5, RAS1, PIK3R2, PAK1IP1 and AKT2, marked by a upper half red rim were found
  only in sample 3. Proteins of CHUK, IKBKB, BIRC5, RAS1, IKBKAP, IKBKG, PTPN11, NFKB1,
  NFKB2 and RELA belong to the angiopoietin pathway only. The rest of the proteins
  belong to the integrin signaling and the angiopoietin pathway simultaneously. Arrows
  indicate interaction, while T-bars show inhibition; schemes of a membrane bilayer,
  a nucleus (circle) and a mitochondrion outline localization.
