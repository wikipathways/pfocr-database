caption: 'Proposed nonnative pathway for muconic acid synthesis. The proposed nonnative
  pathway converts the 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHB) from the ubiquinone pathway to
  muconic acid. Abbreviations: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate;
  DAHP, 3-deoxy-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate; DHQ, 3-dehydroquinic acid; DHS,
  3-dehydroshikimic acid; SA, shikimic acid; S3P, shikimate-3-phosphate; EPSP, 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate
  3-phosphate; PHE, phenylalanine; TYR, tyrosine; TRYP, tryptophan; PYR, pyruvate;
  PHB, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid; PCA, protocatechuic acid. The genes shown encode proteins
  as follows: aroF, DAHP synthase; aroB, DHQ synthase; aroD, DHQ dehydratase; aroE,
  shikimate dehydrogenase; aroL, shikimate kinase; aroA, 3-phosphoshikimate-1-carboxyvinyltransferase;
  aroC, chorismate synthase; trpE and trpD, anthranilate synthase components I and
  II, respectively; tyrA and pheA, TyrA and PheA subunits of chorismate mutase, respectively;
  pobA, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrolyase; aroY, protocatechuic acid decarboxylase;
  catA, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase; ubiC, chorismate pyruvate-lyase; ubiA, 4-hydroxybenzoate
  octaprenyltransferase; and ubiD, 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase.'
