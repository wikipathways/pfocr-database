caption: Possible molecular mechanisms of Ngb neuroprotection by modulating cell death/survival
  signaling pathways. Ngb may function as an O2 and NO sensor. Ngb has guanine-nucleotide
  dissociation inhibitor (GDI) activity and can prevent Gα from binding to the Gβγ
  complex and activates the downstream signaling pathway. Ngb may inhibit the dissociation
  of Rac-1 from its endogenous GDI, thus preventing hypoxia-induced actin polymerization
  and microdomain aggregation. Ngb may interact with VDAC and inhibit hypoxia/OGD-induced
  mPTP opening and Cyt c release from mitochondria. Ngb could convert Cyt c3+ to Cyt
  c2+, and subsequently interfere with apoptotic signaling cascades or scavenge nitric
  oxide. Ngb may interact with Cyc1 and inhibit hypoxia/OGD-induced ROS generation
  by mitochondria complex III.

  description: Possible molecular mechanisms of Ngb neuroprotection by modulating

    Ngb has guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) activity and can prevent

    Ngb may inhibit the dissociation of Rac-1 from its endogenous GDI, thus preventing
