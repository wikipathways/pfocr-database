caption: Metabolic network of CcsR-dependent targets and influence on cell regulatory
  networks. (A) After stress-dependent transcription, sRNAs CcsR1–4 repress flhR directly
  and thereby indirectly repress several genes with roles in C1 metabolism and electron
  transport. Moreover, CcsR1–4 influence pqqA expression through an unknown mechanism.
  FlhR is a transcriptional activator that has been shown to regulate adhI and cycI
  in R. sphaeroides (). cycB and fghA were demonstrated to be regulated by FlhR in
  P. denitrificans (), while xoxJ is located in an operon together with cycB in R.

  and a dependence of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex gene pdhB on FlhR is indicated.
  XoxF and XoxJ are potential methanol oxidation proteins. TCA, tricarboxylic acid
  cycle. (B) Under oxidative stress, thioredoxins and GSH help to prevent oxidative
  protein and lipid damage by interacting directly with oxidized residues and CcsR1–4
  lead to repression of flhR. Through this, the stimulation of the AdhI pathway is
  indirectly decreased. In addition, the AdhI pathway is known to be regulated by
  PrrA and RfdR (, ). If protein oxidation is not sufficiently prevented, protein
  carbonylation occurs and reactive aldehydes are produced. These reactive aldehydes
  probably lead to activation of flhR and more AdhI is produced, which then, with
  the help of GSH, takes on a putative protective role in the oxidative stress response
  (). Through the influence of the CcsR RNAs, fine-tuning of GSH allocation in this
  network is achieved.
