caption: Regulatory mechanisms of actin dynamics in response to DNA damage. (A) Radiation-induced
  actin polymerization triggers the release of JMY from G-actin. JMY then enters the
  nucleus and binds to p53 for p53-dependent apoptosis; (B) When DNA damage occurs,
  polymerized actins may allow p53 binding to actin filaments and retain p53 in the
  cytoplasm. DNA repair would dominate p53-mediated apoptosis under this condition;
  and (C) DNA damage-mediated actin polymerization would be caused by p53 induction
  of the Rho/RCOK signaling pathway, followed by activation of LIMK2 to phosphorylate
  and inactivate cofilin. The actin depolymerization rate will be reduced to maintain
  polymerized actins.

  description: Regulatory mechanisms of actin dynamics in response to DNA damage.
    (A) Radiation-induced actin polymerization triggers the release of JMY from G-actin.
    JMY then enters the nucleus and binds to p53 for p53-dependent apoptosis; (B)
    When DNA damage occurs, polymerized actins may allow p53 binding to actin filaments
    and retain p53 in the cytoplasm. DNA repair would dominate p53-mediated apoptosis
    under this condition; and (C) DNA damage-mediated actin polymerization would be
    caused by p53 induction of the Rho/RCOK signaling pathway, followed by activation
    of LIMK2 to phosphorylate and inactivate cofilin. The actin depolymerization rate
    will be reduced to maintain polymerized actins.
