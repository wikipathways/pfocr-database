caption: Postulated signalling pathway of miRNA-mediated regulation of iron transport
  in transgenic rice plants. In TF plants, (1) during the milk stage of seed development,
  the higher abundance of iron in seeds induces signalling molecules (unknown) in
  roots, The signalling molecules may be (2) protein molecules (transcription factors)
  or (3) small RNAs which act as anti-miRNAs. (4) Signalling molecules in turn down-regulate
  four novel root-specific miRNAs, miR11, miR26, miR30, and miR31. (5) A lower abundance
  of miRNAs activates the transcription of the target transporter, NRAMP4, and (6)
  ultimately higher expression in roots; (7) a higher abundance of NRAMP4 along with
  other transporters such as OsYSL15, OsFRO2, and OsIRT2 facilitates iron transport
  through TF roots. (8) High iron (ferrous/ferric ion) is transported to the shoot
  from the roots. In contrast, (9) the iron concentration in WT seeds suppresses the
  formation of signalling molecules in roots, which in turn (10) activate accumulation
  of the four novel miRNAs in roots. (11) Elevated miRNAs inhibit NRAMP4 gene expression
  and (12) finally reduced transporter accumulation in WT roots. (13) Elevated amounts
  of iron are transported to seeds from flag leaves where no significant differences
  in transporter gene activation is recorded. (14) In WT seeds, OsNRAMP4, OsYSL15,
  OsFRO2, OsIRT1, and OsIRT2 are activated for (15) iron loading in grain that helps
  to maintain iron homeostasis. The arrows indicates activation of transporters, increased
  state of different transporters, and the step by step signal transduction mechanism.
