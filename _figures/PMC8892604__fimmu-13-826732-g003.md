caption: Main metabolic pathways in T cells. T cells generate ATP by glycolysis and
  oxidative phosphorylation. Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a branch of glycolysis
  pathway. Cells also generate energy by using glutamine (Gln), which is metabolized
  by glutaminolysis, and lipids(β-oxidation). Additionally, Serine enters the cell
  from the extracellular space and then, either enters one-carbon metabolism (1CM),
  which generating one-carbon (1C) building blocks for anabolism, or produces the
  ROS scavenger glutathione (GSH).
