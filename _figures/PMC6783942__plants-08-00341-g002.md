caption: Overview of the relationship between carotenoid and prenyl quinone biosynthesis.
  Biosynthesis of carotenoids and plastoquinone requires the MEP, terpenoid and homogentisate
  pathways. Older chemistry such as clomazone inhibits 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate
  synthase (DXS), the first step in the MEP pathway; a number of chemical classes
  inhibit carotenoid biosynthesis by targeting phytoene desaturase (PDS); the newer
  triketone herbicides inhibit p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) involved
  in homogentisate biosynthesis. The two newest target sites affect solanyl diphosphate
  synthase (SPS) responsible for the synthesis of the terpenoid tail of plastoquinone
  or homogentisate solanesyl transferase (HST), the enzyme combining solanyl diphosphate
  and homogentisate to form a plastoquinone precursor.
