caption: Accelerated aging model in HIV infection. Viral replication results in release
  of virions (infectious and noninfectious HIV) into circulation. Residual ongoing
  replication continues to activate immune cells despite highly active antiretroviral
  therapy. Microbial translocation adds to the antigenic burden. Loss of thymic function
  alters T-cell homeostasis. Immune activation due to circulating antigen is the central
  event in the senescent pathway. Activated cells undergo clonal expansion in response
  to the persistent antigen, resulting in differentiation and accumulation of nonfunctional
  end stage senescent cells. Activated cells release inflammatory mediators, causing
  optimal and suboptimal inflammation associated with non–AIDS-defining co-morbidities
  and premature aging.
