caption: A model depicting how M-MDSCs regulate alveolar bone loss in ligature-induced
  periodontitis. M-MDSCs expansion in periodontitis promotes inflammation and drives
  alveolar bone loss via upregulating Neat1, where it exerts its proinflammatory effect
  by activating NF-κB signaling. Subsequently, the NF-κB-dependent “canonical NLRP3
  inflammasome” pathway is activated, leading to increased secretion of proinflammatory
  cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α
