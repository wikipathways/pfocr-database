caption: Schematic presentation that demonstrates a link between purinergic receptor-mediated
  signaling and cellular metabolic pathways. Stimulation of purinergic receptors (presumably
  P2 subtype and, to a lesser extent, P1 subtype) by extracellular ATP, MeSADP, and
  adenosine (Ado) results in activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, upregulation of glucose
  transporter-1 (GLUT-1), as well as metabolic enzymes involved in glycolysis [hexokinase
  (HK) phosphofructokinase (PFK) B3, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] and oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-E1α, COX IV, succinate dehydrogenase
  (SDH), and F0F1ATP synthase]. As a result, activation of glycolysis and OXPHOS,
  and increase in mitochondrial Ca2+, can be observed in VVEC. P2R, P2 purinergic
  receptors; P1R, P1 purinergic receptors. Solid arrows indicate functional connection
  between proteins and pathways, dashed arrows indicate a cross talk between pathways,
  and dotted arrows indicate transport glucose and ATP and functional connection between
  Akt and its target proteins.
