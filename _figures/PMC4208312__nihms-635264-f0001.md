caption: The B-cell receptor (BCR) and its downstream pathways. The arrow indicates
  direction of signaling from plasmamembrane towards effectors. Antigen binding or
  cell autologous interaction activates BCR, resulting in phosphorylation of ITAMs
  in the cytoplasmic domains of CD79A and CD79B. SYK amplifies the initial signal
  by autophosphorylation and further phosphorylation of ITAMs (the initial amplifying
  complex is marked in green). LYN has a double function in initiating and terminating
  BCR signaling depending on interaction with CD19 (inhibitory molecules marked purple,
  bifunctional molecules light purple). SYK also activates the PI3K arm of the pathway
  (marked in yellow). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is phosphorylated
  by PI3K to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3, AXL, and BLNK form
  a signaling hub that recruits the upper part of the BCR pathway to the plasmamembrane.
  Inhibitory mechanisms include FcγRIIB that inhibits BCR signaling upon binding to
  immune complexes at the BCR. SHIP-1 and PTEN phosphatases inhibit the PI3K arm of
  the pathway by hydrolysis of PIP3. AKT and mTOR relay PI3K activation further to
  downstream targets and cell cycle regulation. The BTK arm of the pathway (marked
  in red) is initiated by recruitment of BTK to the plasmamembrane signaling hub.
  PLCγ2 is activated downstream of BTK, leading to subsequent activation of PKCβ.
  PKCβ phosphorylates IKK to activate NF-κB transcription factors that regulate gene
  expression of several survival factors. The complex of CARD11, MALT1, and BCL10
  is an important part of the pathway activating NF-κB whereas A20 is a negative regulator
  of NF-κB. The downstream effectors can be modulated towards the pro-apoptotic NF-AT
  – ERK arm or the pro-survival NF-κB arm depending on balancing of the signaling
  cascades. Please see the sections on specific parts of the signaling pathways and
  activation in B-cell malignancies for further details.
