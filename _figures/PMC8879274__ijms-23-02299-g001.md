caption: Compounds regulating adipogenesis through various signaling pathways. (A).
  Overview of the process of adipogenesis. Progenitor marked by αSMA, PDGFRα/PDGFRβ
  will firstly make a commitment to preadipocyte, and then differentiate into mature
  adipocyte. During the differentiation process, some transcription factors that are
  critical to adipogenesis, like PPARγ, C/EBPβ, C/EBPα et al., are required. (B).
  Compounds regulating adipogenesis through various signaling pathway. Adipogenesis-regulating
  compounds are shown in bold, and their pathway-modulating mechanisms are presented
  briefly. For regulated adipogenesis, the four processes including beiging, whiting,
  brown adipogenesis and white adipogenesis are of concern. Beiging stands for elevated
  thermogenic ability and increased brown adipocyte characteristics in white adipocyte
  or white adipose tissue. Whiting stands for the loss of thermogenic ability and
  brown adipocyte characteristics of brown adipocyte or brown adipose tissue. Brown
  adipogenesis stands for increased brown adipocyte differentiation or thermogenic
  ability in brown adipocytes or brown adipose tissue. White adipogenesis stands for
  increased white adipocyte differentiation in white adipocytes or white adipose tissue.
  In general, the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway through certain compounds
  is shown to inhibit white adipogenesis, and promote beiging of white adipogenesis
  and brown adipogenesis. Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway through
  certain compounds is shown to inhibit white adipogenesis, and its inhibition is
  shown to promote beiging of WAT. Activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway is
  shown to inhibit white adipogenesis.
