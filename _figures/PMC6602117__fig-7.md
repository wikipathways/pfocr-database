caption: Excitation/contraction energetics coupling in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
  cardiomyocytes. Left, HCM-causing mutations lead to higher myofilament ATPase-activity
  in cardiomyocytes, thereby enhancing cellular [ADP]. Defective CK and mitochondria
  function are unable to rapidly regenerate ATP. Elevated [ADP] leads to high myofilament
  Ca2+-sensitivity and Ca2+-buffering (sticky myofilaments, designed as a fishnet
  trapping Ca2+ at the myofilaments). Right, Zoomed view of the creatine (Cr)/phosphocreatine
  (PCr) export pathway in HCM cardiomyocytes. Impaired mitochondrial function in concert
  with reduced CK function and low PCr amount limits the capacity of the Cr-PCr pathway
  to buffer ATP, leading to ADP accumulation at the myofilaments. Color images are
  available online.
