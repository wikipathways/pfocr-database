caption: CCL25 acts on CCR9, a G protein-coupled receptor located on the SACC cell
  membrane, resulting in activation of the G protein and release of the Gβγ subunit,
  thereby activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Vercirnon is a CCR9 inhibitor,
  and LY294002 is a blocker of the PI3K/AKT pathway. PI3K/AKT pathway activation can
  upregulate the mitochondrial-mediated anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, thus inhibiting
  caspase 3-dependent tumor cell apoptosis. Furthermore, CCL25 activation of the PI3K/AKT
  pathway leads to an increase in the expression of the cell cycle regulatory protein
  cyclin D1 and the protooncogene c-Myc, thus promoting the proliferation of tumor
  cells. Furthermore, the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway activates its downstream
  transcription factor SLUG, leading to regulation of the expression of EMT-related
  factors (E-cadherin and vimentin) and ECM degradation-related factors (MMPs), which
  enhances the migration and invasion abilities of SACC cells.
