caption: Proposed signaling pathway for fragment C. Based on the results obtained
  by Aguilera and co-workers, fragment C can induce cerebellar granular cell survival
  under stress conditions, activating signaling pathways associated with Trk receptors
  that include the activation of PLC, the Ras/MAPK pathway and the PI3 pathway, leading
  to the survival of the cell [,]. Another possible retrograde pathway of fragment
  C of tetanus toxin is shared by p75NTR, TrkB and BDNF, which is strongly dependent
  on the activities of the small GTPases Rab5 and Rab7 [].
