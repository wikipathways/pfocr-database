caption: 'Nogo-B regulates de novo SL biosynthesis through the inhibition of SPT activity
  to control vascular tone and BP. Nogo-B, a membrane protein of the ER, is a negative
  regulator of SPT activity, the enzyme controlling the first and rate-limiting step
  of the de novo biosynthesis of SLs. A highly bioactive SL, S1P has been identified
  as a key player in vascular homeostasis: 1) S1P induces vasorelaxation through the
  activation of S1PR1,3 expressed on EC leading to eNOS-NO-mediated vasodilation.
  S1P plays an important role in flow-mediated vasodilation. Changes in flow stimulate
  endothelial S1P production and activation of S1P-S1PR1,3 autocrine signaling to
  regulate vascular tone. 2) S1P induces vasoconstriction by activating S1PR2,3 on
  VSMCs through the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway. Moreover, S1P signaling regulates the
  myogenic response to pressure.'
