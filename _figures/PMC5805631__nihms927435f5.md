caption: Downstream mTOR effectors in PVR categorized by disease stage (left). A constructed
  disease model highlighting the molecular phenotype with associated cytokines and
  correlation to clinical phenotype of PVR (right). Potential therapeutics which have
  already been approved for use in other diseases are represented based on upregulated
  cytokines and pathways.
