caption: Tau phosphorylation and its involvement in long-term depression (LTD). (1)
  Calmodulin (CaM) detects a Ca2+ increment due to NMDAr activation, leading to protein
  phosphatase-2B (PP2B) activation and the subsequent activation of the PP1. (2) PP1
  dephosphorylates Ser845 at the AMPAr subunit GluA1, Ser295 at PSD95, and GSK3β.
  (3) Active GSK3β leads to pTau near MD (microtubule domain). (4) pTau induced LTD
  by the dissociation of Tau/Fyn/PSD95 complex. (5) Dissociation of Tau/Fyn/PSD95
  leads to disruption of interaction between GluA2 and with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive
  factor (NSF) that cause clathrin-mediated endocytosis of receptors during NMDAr-LTD.
  (6) Inactive GSK3β (through the PI3K/AKT pathway) and dephosphorylated Tau (that
  recruits Fyn kinase to target the PSD95/NMDAr complex) promote long-term potentiation
  (LTP) (arrow = activation, flat line = inhibition).
