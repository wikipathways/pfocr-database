caption: Schematic overview of study findings. In βB1-CTGF mice, which develop glaucomatous
  damage, an activation of the complement, predominantly via the classical pathway
  (C1q), could be detected. The activation of C5 (Hc) eventually lead to the assembling
  of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which harms retinal ganglion cells directly.
  Further, C5 as well as C5a receptors, namely the C5a anaphylatoxin receptor (C5ar)
  and the complement component C5a receptor 1 (C5ar1, CD88), engage a pro-inflammatory
  response of INF-γ, CXCL-10, CXCL-1, and CXCL-2.
