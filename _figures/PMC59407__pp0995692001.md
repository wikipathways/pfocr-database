caption: Acyl-Glc biosynthetic pathway. Fatty acids are activated via UDP-Glc-dependent
  transglucosylation to form the high-energy acyl donor molecule 1-O-acyl-β-Glc. Two
  equivalents of the activated 1-O-acyl-β-Glc intermediate then undergo enzyme-catalyzed
  disproportionation to form 1,2-substituted diacyl-Glc and Glc. In this figure, isobutyrate
  represents the acyl group; however, branched and straight short (C4–C5) to medium
  (C10–C12) chain fatty acids are utilized in acyl-Glc biosynthesis and are activated
  by chain-length-specific UDP-Glc:fatty acid transglucosylases ().
