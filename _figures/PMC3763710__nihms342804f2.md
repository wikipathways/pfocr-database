caption: '(A) Cell-based screening. In this approach, small molecules are tested for
  their ability to activate p53 pathways in cultured cells. Activation can be detected
  by measuring endogenous levels of transcripts from p53 target genes or by using
  various reporter systems. In this second method, the promoter of a p53 target gene
  is placed upstream of a gene encoding a product that can be easily monitored, such
  as the enzyme luciferase (luc). Cell-based screening will identify compounds with
  certain biological activity but with an unknown direct target molecule. (B) Target-based
  screening. In this approach, p53 protein activators are sought in vitro. Specific
  methods include the following: (i) Direct protein binding assays, such as the SMM
  assay. In this example, a library of small molecules is assembled on a microarray
  and the ability of p53 to bind the molecules is tested. Here, p53 binding is detected
  by a set of antibodies. (ii) Forward structural design, in which the structures
  of mutant versions of p53 are analyzed and molecules are designed to interact with
  relevant regions of these structures. (iii) Direct DNA binding assays, in which
  molecules that allow mutant p53 to bind DNA are sought. Such methods will enable
  the identification of compounds with a defined molecular mechanism.CREDIT: C. BICKEL/SCIENCE
