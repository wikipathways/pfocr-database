caption: Illustration of exercise-induced myocardial hypertrophic preconditioning
  (EHP). After swimming training for 3 weeks, the mice developed physiological myocardial
  hypertrophy (PMH), which had regressed 1 week after stopping swimming. EHP upregulated
  the expression of lncRNA Mhrt779 by increasing the trimethylation of histone 3 at
  a4 promoter of Mhrt779 even after PMH has regressed. By binding to Brg1/Hdac2 in
  transverse aortic constriction (TAC) mouse heart, Mhrt779 downregulated Brg1 and
  inhibited the activation of the Hdac2 (histone deacetylase 2)/Akt/glycogen synthase
  kinase 3β (GSK3β) signaling pathway and consequently attenuated pathological myocardial
  hypertrophy. Brg1 could bind Hdac2 at Mhrt779 promoter to induce β-myosin heavy
  chain (β-MHC) and could inhibit Mhrt779 via feedback H3K4me3, histone 3 lysine 4
  trimethylation; H3K36me3, histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation; Smarca4, SWI/SNF–related,
  matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 4;
  ↑, promotion or upregulation; and ⊥, inhibition.
