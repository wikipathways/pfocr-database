caption: Coordination of developmental signalling pathways by USP9X. Interactors of
  USP9X (hexagons) are key regulators, or signal transduction molecules, of signalling
  pathways important for many aspects of embryogenesis. In Notch signalling (orange),
  USP9X is required in the signal sending cells to antagonise the proteasomal degradation
  of both Mind bomb1 (MIB1) and Epsin1, which control key endocytic events of Notch
  ligands (Delta, Serrate and Lag2; DSL) required for signalling competence. In EGF
  signalling (dark blue), USP9X protects ITCH from proteasomal degradation, which
  then inhibits the delivery of the EGF receptor to the lysosome and hence promotes
  signalling output. USP9X interacts with multiple components of the mTOR signalling
  pathway (green) including mTOR, Raptor and Rictor. Although the direct consequence
  of these interactions is unknown, Usp9x negatively regulates the signalling output
  of the two mTOR signalling complexes, mTORC1 and 2. USP9X can promote canonical
  Wnt signalling (light blue) by protecting the central signal transduction component
  β-catenin (βcat) from proteasomal degradation, thus promoting its accumulation,
  which is associated with nuclear translocation. USP9X can also affect TGFβ signalling
  (purple) both positively and negatively. USP9X protects SMURF1 from proteasomal
  degradation, which enables it to directly downregulate TGFβ receptors from the cell
  surface. In contrast, USP9X promotes TGFβ signalling by reversing the effects of
  mono-ubiquitylation of the common Smad4, which inhibits its ability to form signal
  transducing complexes with receptor SMADs (R SMAD). Adding further complexity, USP9X
  substrates can themselves regulate multiple signalling pathways, for example ITCH
  also negatively regulates Notch and Wnt signalling (dark blue dotted lines), whilst
  SMURF1 also negatively regulates Wnt signalling (purple dotted lines)
