caption: Lysine 5,6-aminomutase of Fold Type VI and Lysine 2,3-aminomutase of Fold
  Type VII are involved in the same metabolic pathway but are differentially regulated.
  (A) 5,6-LAM (Fold Type VI) is active as an α2β2 tetramer (known as the E1 component),
  but reactivation and ATP regulation are possible through interaction with another
  protein referred to as the E2 component. (B) 2,3-LAM (Fold Type VII) uses three
  cofactors, PLP, AdoMet, and [4Fe-4S]+, for catalysis. AdoMet and [4Fe-4S]+ work
  together for adenosyl radical formation, but this step is limited by 4Fe-4S cluster
  formation and reduction to the +1 state. Interaction between 2,3-LAM and a reducing
  protein (e.g., flavodoxin NADP+ reductase, flavodoxin, or ferredoxin) activates
  2,3-LAM.
