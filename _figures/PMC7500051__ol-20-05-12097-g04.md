caption: 'Opposite immune effects of M1-like and M2-like TAMs in the tumor microenvironment.
  Left: IL12, IFNγ and iNOS derived from M1-like TAMs activate NK cells and TLRs that
  cause Th1 pro-inflammatory response and anti-tumor activity. Inhibition of PI3Kγ
  strongly activates the NF-κB pathway, causing increased expression of proinflammatory
  factors, including IL12 and IFNγ. Right: TGF-β and IL10 derived from M2-like TAMs
  activate Tregs by upregulating Foxp3 in CD4+ T cells that cause Th2 anti-inflammatory
  response and pro-tumor activity. CCL5, CCL20 and CCL22 released by M2-like TAMs
  activate iTregs, Arginase-1 and NOS to suppress effector T cells to promote immune
  suppression in the TME. PI3Kγ works downstream of many chemoattractant-receptors,
  such as receptor tyrosine kinases (VEGF-R1 and CSF1R) and G protein-coupled receptors
  (CCR2 and CXCR4). Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway activates PI3Kγ, causing increased
  expression of anti-inflammatory factors, including ARG1, TGFβ and CCL5. mTORC1,
  mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; MyD88, Myeloid differentiation primary
  response 88 protein; PI3Kγ, phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ; TIR, toll/interleukin receptor
  domain; TLR/ILR, Toll-like receptor/interleukin receptor; ARG, Arginase; TGFβ, transforming
  growth factor β; CCL, C-C motif chemokine ligand; IL, interleukin; IFNγ, interferon
