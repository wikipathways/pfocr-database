caption: 'The role of key components of the Ca2+signalling machinery in the control
  of cell proliferation and the cell cycle. Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+
  channels (SOCE; consisting of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stromal interacting molecule
  (STIM)1 and Orai1), arachidonate-regulated Ca2+ channels (ARC; consisting of plasma
  membrane STIM1 and Orai1/Orai3 heteropentamers), transient receptor potential channel
  (TRPC)6, TRPV6, and the non-SOCE (plasma membrane secretory pathway ATPase (SPCA)-regulated
  Orai1) have all been implicated to regulate cell proliferation. Specific spatiotemporal
  patterns of Ca2+ signals can differentially regulate gene transcription (via calcineurin/nuclear
  factor of activated T cells (NFAT), CAMKII/cAMP response element-binding protein
  (CREB), immediate early genes (Jun, Myc, and Fos)), and the Ras/ERK signalling pathway.
  Localised Ca2+ entry can specifically activate the Ras guanine exchange factor (Ras-GEF),
  Ras-GRF, which converts the inactive Ras-guanosine diphoshpate (Ras-GDP) to the
  activate Ras-guanosine triphoshpate (Ras-GTP). Moreover, the amplitude of Ca2+ signals
  can specifically activate CAPRI and the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations can specifically
  activate RASAL, both of which are Ras guanine activating proteins (Ras-GAPs) that
  inactivate Ras-GTP. Ca2+ also has an important role in the control of the cell cycle
  and centrosome cycle. Specifically, Ca2+-dependent activation of retinoblastoma-1
  (RB1) regulates G1/S phase transition, CaMKII regulates G2/M phase transition, and
  CREB and NFAT can regulate M/G1 transition. Additional abbreviations include EGFR,
  epidermal growth factor receptor; PI3K, phosphinositide-3 kinase; PKB, protein kinase-B;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated kinase; cell cycle phases: G1 and G2, gap; S, synthesis;
  M, mitosis.'
