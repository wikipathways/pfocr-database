caption: 'Folates require several transport systems to enter the cells, the best characterized
  being the reduced folate carrier (RFC1). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)
  reduces 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF) to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF).
  Subsequently, methionine synthase (MTR) transfers a methyl group from 5-MTHF to
  homocysteine (Hcy) forming methionine (Met) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). Methionine
  is then converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in a reaction catalyzed by methionine
  adenosyltransferase (MAT). Most of the SAM generated is used in transmethylation
  reactions, whereby SAM is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by DNA methyltransferases
  (DNMTs) that transfer the methyl group to the DNA. Vitamin B12 is a cofactor of
  MTR, and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) is required for the maintenance of
  MTR in its active state. If not converted into methionine, Hcy can be used for the
  synthesis of glutathione (GSH) in a reaction catalyzed by cystathionine b-synthase
  (CBS) and other enzymes. Another important function of folate derivatives (THF and
  dihydrofolate: DHF) is in the de novo synthesis of DNA and RNA precursors (dUMP,
  dTMP, etc). This pathway is mediated by thymidylate synthase (TYMS), methylenetetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase (MTHFD), and phosphoribosylglycinamide transformylase (GART) enzymes.'
