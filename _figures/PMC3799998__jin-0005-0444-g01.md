caption: Comparison of autophagy pathways in Drosophila and mammals. In both flies
  and mammals, autophagy proceeds through three defined stages that depend on a number
  of conserved genes comprising the core autophagic machinery. Autophagy is regulated
  by the nutrient signaling pathway, in which the kinase TOR normally inhibits autophagy
  under nutrient-rich conditions. Autophagy initiation involves a multiprotein complex
  containing Atg13 and the serine/threonine kinase Atg1, which activates formation
  of the pre-autophagosomal membrane. Nucleation of the pre-autophagosomal membrane
  is mediated by a complex that contains the type III PI3K Vps34. Elongation of the
  membrane proceeds through two ubiquitin-like conjugation steps. Atg8 (LC3) acquires
  a phosphatidylethanolamine group to form Atg8-II (LC3-II), which is incorporated
  into the nascent autophagosomal membrane and helps recruit substrates for degradation.
  In the second reaction, Atg5 is conjugated to Atg12, which then associates with
  Atg16. Genes that have not been validated in autophagy in Drosophila are depicted
  as white boxes.
