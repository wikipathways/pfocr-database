caption: The bridging role of hepatokines in AD and metabolic disorders. This figure
  highlights the central role of hepatokines in linking AD and metabolic disorders
  through mechanisms involving IR, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. In IR,
  FGF-21 binds to KLB receptors to promote GLUT-1-mediated glucose uptake and alleviate
  IR, while ANGPTL3 increases blood TG levels by inhibiting LPL activity. SELENOP
  suppresses AMPK phosphorylation, reducing ACC phosphorylation, thereby enhancing
  fatty acid synthesis and exacerbating IR. Reduced levels of Fetuin-A attenuate TGFBR
  signaling in pancreatic islets, inhibit SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, and regulate insulin
  secretion. SHBG enhances IR by regulating glucose transporter expression through
  the cAMP/PKA/CREB1 signaling pathway. In neuroinflammation, ApoJ stimulates microglia,
  enhancing reactive nitrogen intermediates and pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α.
  Concurrently, Fetuin-A facilitates macrophage migration and polarization via the
  JNK-c-Jun-IFN-γ–JAK2–STAT1 pathway, intensifying adipose tissue inflammation. Conversely,
  FGF-21 inhibits NF-κB signaling via the TLR4 receptor, and MANF provides neuroprotection
  by suppressing NF-κB during ER stress and activating the AKT/GSK3β-Nrf2 axis. In
  oxidative stress, FGF-21 activates FGFR1 to destabilize the Keap1-Nrf2 complex,
  enabling Nrf2 to initiate the antioxidant response, while SELENOP binds to LRP-1
  to maintain Gpx4 activity and prevent lipid peroxidation
