caption: 'Cell diagram outlining some of the probable metabolic features of a E01-9C-26
  Gammaproteobacterial cells. These cells appear to have the ability to degrade or
  assimilate a methylated compounds, as well as amines, and may additionally have
  the ability to oxidize reduced sulfur, as well as use organosulfur compounds for
  energy or growth. THF: Tetrahydrofolate-mediated oxidation/assimilation pathway
  for methylated compounds. TCA: Tricarboxylic Acid cycle. Gray pathways indicate
  plausible sources of some specific compounds.'
