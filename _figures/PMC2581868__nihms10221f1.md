caption: 'Schematic diagrams of the dopamine biosynthetic pathway and the 4-gene-vector.
  (A) The dopamine biosynthetic pathway. Tyro-sine hydroxylase (TH) converts tyrosine
  to l-DOPA, and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) converts l-DOPA to dopamine.
  Cytoplasmic dopamine feedback inhibits TH (dashed line). Vesicular monoamine transporter
  2 (VMAT-2) transports dopamine into synaptic vesicles. The cofactor for TH, tetrahydrobiopterin
  (BH4), is synthesized in three steps: GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTP CH I) converts GTP
  to d-erythro-7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate (NH2P3); 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin
  synthase produces 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin (PPH4); and sepiapterin reductase produces
  BH4. (B) The 4-gene-vector, pINS-TH-NFH- flag-th/ires/aadc/INS-TH-NFHha-vmat/ires/gt-pch.
  An HSV-1 origin of DNA replication (oris, solid circle) and an HSV-1 a sequence
  (contains the packaging site, checkered segment) support DNA replication and packaging
  into HSV-1 particles, respectively. The vector contains two transcription units:
  the first transcription unit contains the INS-TH-NFH promoter (horizontally hatched
  segment), FLAG-TH (gray segment), an IRES (vertically hatched segment), a human
  AADC cDNA (gray segment), and the second intron and polyadenylation site from the
  mouse β-globin gene (triangle and Poly A, respectively). The second transcription
  unit contains the INS-TH-NFH promoter, an HA-VMAT-2 cDNA, an IRES, a human GTP CH
  I cDNA, and the second intron and polyadenylation site from the mouse β-globin gene.
  A cassette of three polyadenylation sites (cross-hatched segment) was inserted 3′
  to the HSV-1 immediate-early (IE) 4/5 promoter to reduce any effects this promoter
  might have on recombinant gene expression. Sequences from pBR322 (solid segment)
  were included to support propagation of the vector in E. coli.'
