caption: a The cartoon depicts four possible mechanisms responsible for the complex
  formation between VEGFR2 and αVβ3 on the surface of endothelial cells and the functional
  consequences of this cross-talk. Activation-induced complex was demonstrated in
  [, ], direct binding of extracellular domains was shown in [], cross linking by
  transglutaminases was demonstrated in [], possible coupling by the common ligands
  suggested based on []. Physiological and pathological consequences of the interplay
  between these two receptors are discussed in [, , ]. b The diagram shows possible
  sequence of molecular events involved in interaction between VEGFR2 and αVβ3. As
  discussed in the text, the process is likely to be initiated by activation of VEGFR2
  by VEGF, possibly, by intracellular-autocrine loop. It followed by the recruitment
  of c-src to phosphorylated VEGFR2 together with activation of a number of other
  signaling molecules. C-Src phosphorylates cytoplasmic domain of αVβ3 and in concert
  with other kinases (e.g. PI3K pathway) promote activation of this integrin, which,
  in turn, ultimately results in its conformational changes and increase in ligand
  binding affinity. Ligation of integrin triggers outside-in signaling which further
  augments cell activation
