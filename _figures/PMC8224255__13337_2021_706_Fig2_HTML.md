  targeted by phytochemicals. Virus sensing can trigger unregulated NFkB induced inflammatory
  pathway to produce IL6, TNFα, MCP-1. CD8 + contribute upregulation of inflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines. Reduced NK cell population results less production of
  IFNs (IFNγ & IFNα). Cytokine induced inflammation promote accumulation of reactive
