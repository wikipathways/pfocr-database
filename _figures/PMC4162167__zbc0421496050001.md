caption: Catalytic mechanism proposed for FgFCO1. The catalytic cycle starts with
  formation of a fucosyl-enzyme intermediate by nucleophilic attack from Asp-226 on
  C1 of fucose with concomitant leaving of the free aglycon (ROH) stabilized by a
  proton donated from the general acid Glu-288. The fucosyl-enzyme intermediate is
  then hydrolyzed to yield an enzyme-product complex with the aided deprotonation
  of water by general base Glu-288. The replacement of the product Fuc by fucosylated
  substrate completes the catalytic cycle. The conformation change of the Fuc moiety
  during catalysis follows a 1C4-3S1-1C4pathway with a possible 3H4 oxocarbonium-like
  transition state (intermediates and proposed transition states are based on crystal
  structures PDB 1HL9 and 2WVS) (, , ). The proposed transition state has an sp2-hybridized
  carbon center with oxygen atoms of nucleophilic and leaving group on each side of
  the plane. The other active-site residues like His-126, His-127, His-171, and Lys-272
  of FgFCO1 may also be involved in stabilization of the transition state via hydrogen
  bonding interactions.
