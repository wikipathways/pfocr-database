caption: The role of the MAPK signaling pathway in atherosclerosis development and
  progression. This diagram illustrates the role of the MAPK signaling pathway in
  the formation and progression of atherosclerosis. Various stimuli, including pro-inflammatory
  factors, extracellular stress, intracellular DNA damage, and protein misfolding,
  can activate MAPK/p38/JNK/ERK signaling. This activation promotes multiple pathogenic
  processes, including macrophage transformation, monocyte-platelet aggregate formation,
  endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), endothelial cell adhesion, inflammation,
  and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration. Additionally,
  modified lipids such as oxLDL and eLDL enhance MAPK activation through PPARγ, leading
  to increased foam cell formation. Other regulatory factors, such as Ereg and TGF-β,
  further contribute to MAPK-mediated endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis
  progression. These interconnected mechanisms highlight MAPK as a critical regulator
  of vascular pathology, making it a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis
  treatment
