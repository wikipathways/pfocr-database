caption: MYC proteins and the p53/MDM2/p14ARFpathway. In response to cellular stresses
  p53 can mediate the expression of genes involved in various cellular responses such
  as apoptosis (e.g., BAX, NOXA, and PUMA), cell cycle arrest (e.g., p21CIP1), differentiation,
  DNA repair or senescence. p53, MDM2 and p14ARF form an autoregulatory feedback loop
  to tightly regulate p53 expression and activity. p14ARF can be activated in response
  to aberrant oncogenic factors such as c-MYC, and possibly MYCN (as indicated by
  the dashed line). p14ARF can also exhibit p53-independent tumor suppressor activity
  by directly binding and inhibiting the activity of c-MYC and MYCN. Both p53 and
  MDM2 are direct target genes of MYCN. MDM2 can regulate MYCN mRNA stability and
  translation, thereby forming a positive feedback loop.
