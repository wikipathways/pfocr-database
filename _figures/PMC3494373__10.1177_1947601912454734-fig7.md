caption: The regulation of MDM2 by chronic stress and neurohormones. Chronic stress
  increases the levels of neurohormones, including glucocorticoids and epinephrine,
  both of which activate MDM2 and inhibit p53 function through distinct signaling
  pathways. Glucocorticoids bind to a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to induce the expression
  of SGK1, which phosphorylates and activates MDM2. Epinephrine functions through
  β2-adrenergic receptor (AR) to activate the PKA–β-arrestin-1 pathway, which then
  promotes AKT-mediated MDM2 activation.
