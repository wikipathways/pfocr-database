caption: Proposed regulatory network of bulbil initiation in P. ternata. Hormones
  are designated with black boxes, while genes regulating AM are denoted by oval shapes.
  Genes involved in hormone synthesis and signal transduction pathways exhibit upregulation
  in red, downregulation in green, and both upregulation and downregulation in blue.
  The dashed arrow with a pointed tip signifies the presumptive positive control relationship,
  the pointed arrow represents positive control, and the flat arrow line with a blunt
  tip indicates an inhibitory effect
