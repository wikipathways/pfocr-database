caption: 'Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling is initiated upon LPS binding to the
  leucine-rich repeats located in the N-terminal domain. The MyD88 pathway is initiated
  upon recruitment of the MAL and MyD88 adapters to the C-terminal TIR domains, which
  leads to activation of downstream signaling proteins for transcription and activation
  of pro-inflammatory genes, such as TNF and IL-6. TLR4 is then endocytosed for within
  30 minutes of LPS stimulation for initiation of the TRIF-dependent signaling through
  recruitment of the TRAM and TRIF adapters, leading to activation of cytoplasmic
  proteins and production of type I interferons, RANTES/CCL5, and IP-10. The TLR4/MD2/CD14-LPS
  receptor complex then undergoes a Rab7b-mediated lysosomal degradation or TLR4-mediated
  retrograde transport back to the plasma membrane. Abbreviations- Rantes: Regulated
  on Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted, IP-10: IFNγ-inducible protein,
  NO: nitric oxide, ROS: reactive oxygen species, COX2: cyclooxygenase II enzyme.'
