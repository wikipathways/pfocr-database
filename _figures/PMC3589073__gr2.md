caption: Major steps in phagocytosis and autophagy. The proper induction (A and B),
  cargo targeting (C), maturation (D and E), and completion of lysosomal clearance
  (F) are all important for both phagocytosis and autophagy. For phagocytosis, the
  recognition of danger signals from dead cells or microbial pathogens stimulates
  phagocyte migration. A number of different receptors are involved in capturing and
  internalizing bacterial, apoptotic, or particulate cargoes through a process enhanced
  by Atg proteins and dependent on a proper local redox environment maintained by
  EC-SOD. Once the phagocytic cargo is inside the phagosome, concentrated production
  of ROS or degradative enzymes are stimulated, depending on the ingested contents.
  Similarly, either general or localized insults within cells serve to trigger the
  membrane deposition of Atg 5—Atg 12 and of LC3 (through Beclin 1–dependent or independent
  mechanisms), which are essential for the extension of autophagic membranes. Whereas
  nonselective sequestration of cytoplasm is induced by starvation, damaged and potentially
  harmful cargoes need to be appropriately targeted to LC3-bound membranes. Autophagy
  is also induced by phagosome-derived signals to sequester pathogens that escape
  or damage the phagosome membrane. In turn, induction of the autophagic pathway serves
  to further promote phagosome–lysosomal fusion. Thus, these two complementary systems
  cooperate in removing exogenous and endogenous danger signals to limit proinflammatory,
  carcinogenic, and prodeath stimuli. For both phagocytic and autophagic pathways,
  inefficient lysosomal fusion or digestion can contribute to many classes of disease
  (red-shaded boxes). Accumulation of undigested lysosomal cargo is seen in aging
  and in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), neurodegenerative diseases, and many
  other diseases or disorders. Inefficient utilization of digested products for energy
  production or in the regeneration of mitochondria and other essential cellular structures
  may also contribute to cell death and neurodegeneration.
