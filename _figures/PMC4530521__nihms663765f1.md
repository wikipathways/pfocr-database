caption: The figure shows the principal events of the canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway
  and their actions in human cells. First, primary-miRNA (pri-miRNA) is transcribed
  by RNA polymerases II or III from either intronic regions within protein-coding
  genes or intergenic regions. Second, pri-miRNA is cropped by the Microprocessor
  complex (MPC) unit comprising of Drosha and DGCR8 (Pasha) into precursor-miRNA (pre-miRNA).
  Third, pre-miRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5,
  where pre-miRNA is further cleaved by Dicer into a short guide/passenger strand
  (miRNA/*miRNA) duplex. One of the strands is incorporated in the miRNA-induced silencing
  complex (miRISC) with GW182 and an Argonaute protein, most frequently Argonaute
  −2. The miRISC-attached miRNA binds to the 3’- untranslated region of a target mRNA,
  the CCR4-Not complex recruited by GW182 leads to translational inhibition of the
  mRNA and/or to deadenylation of the mRNA´s poly(A) tail and its subsequent degradation.
