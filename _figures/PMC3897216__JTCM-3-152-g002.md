caption: 'The possible mechanisms of action of Wu-Ling-San, Danggui-Buxue-Tang, or
  Danggui-Shaoyao-San on the amelioration of hyperglycemia-mediated renal injury in
  STZ-diabetic rats. The selected TCM formulas exhibit a renoprotective effect in
  an animal model of DN with an antihyperglycemic activity accompanied by suppression
  of AGE–RAGE signaling. These selected TCM formulas also protect the kidney of diabetic
  rats from oxidative damage by enhancing enzymatic antioxidative defense systems,
  thereby resulting in downregulation of NF-κB–TGF–β1-dependent pathway and, consequently,
  attenuation of ECM components such as fibronectin or type IV collagen expression
  in diabetic renal cortex tissue. ↓: decrease or reduction;↑: increase or enhance'
