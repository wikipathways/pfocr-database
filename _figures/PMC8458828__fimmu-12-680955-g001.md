caption: 'Aerobic glycolysis of NPC cell. GLUT1 expression is up-regulated and glucose
  uptake is increased. The expression level of HK is increased and promotes glycolysis.
  PKM2 over-expression promotes GLUT1 expression and glucose absorption. The expression
  of PDHB is down-regulated, which inhibits the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA.
  PDK1 is highly expressed, which leads to the inactivation of PDHB. The over-expression
  of IDH2 promoted the transformation of α - KG to 2-HG. LDH expression and lactate
  production increased. EBV secreted-protein LMP1 promotes glucose uptake and lactate
  production. In pentose phosphate pathway, EBV-miR-BART1 promotes G6PD over-expression.
  GLUT1: glucose transporter 1, HK: hexokinase, PKM2: pyruvate kinase M2, PDHB: pyruvate
  dehydrogenase B, PDK1: pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, IDH2: isocitrate dehydrogenase,
  α-KG: α–ketoglutarate, 2-HG: 2-hydroxyglutaric acid, LDH: lactate dehydrogenase,

  dehydrogenase.'
