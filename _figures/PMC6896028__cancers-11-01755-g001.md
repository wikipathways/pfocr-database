caption: 'Nrf2, through its targeted genes, has an anti-carcinogenic role in the case
  of normal cells and a pro-carcinogenic effect in the case of transformed malignant
  cells. Nrf2 stimulates the expression of SOD1, CAT, UGT2B7, G6PD, HO-1, PGD, TALDO1,
  TKT, and NQO1 genes, and it is involved in the protection of normal cells against
  intrinsic or extrinsic oxidative stress. Nrf2 also induces the expression of the
  KRT16 gene, which helps in the maintenance of cytoskeleton integrity. In pre-cancerous
  lesions or cancerous cells, Nrf2 causes metabolic alterations such as anaerobic
  glycolysis, altered pentose phosphate pathway, and fatty-acid biosynthesis, among
  others, which induce the shift to anabolism with the help of the following targeted
  genes: ABCA1, ABCG2, ALDH3A1, CYP4F3, GBE1, PTGR1, AKR1C1, GCLC, TXNRD1, SDHB, G6PD,
  PGD, TALDO1, and TKT. Nrf2 activation also leads to the stimulated proliferation
  and inhibition of apoptosis, by enhancing the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes
  BCL-2 and BCL-XL and the proliferation gene CDCA4. With the help of C-X-C Motif
  Chemokine Ligand 8 (CXCL8), Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and Hypoxia-inducible factor
  1 (HIF-1), Nrf2 was proven to induce angiogenesis in cancer. The overstimulation
  of Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) could also be involved in cancer.
  Nrf2 can either stimulate or inhibit invasion and metastasis. The targeted genes
  involved in the stimulation are FAK, MLC, ROCK, RHOA, and MMP9. Nrf2, however, also
  downregulates the invasion-promoting gene, Snail. Nrf2 inhibits Nrf2-induced inflammation
  with the help of its targeted genes iNOS, COX2, and IL-11, while it also inhibits
  the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (not illustrated) TNFα, IL-6, IL-8,
  and IL-1β. The most important cancer-promoting action of Nrf2 is the promotion of
  chemoresistance through multiple mechanisms due to its targeted genes GSTA2, GSTP1,
  CYP3A4, MRP1, ABCF2, ABCG2, GCLC, GCLM, MRP5, and HO-1.'
