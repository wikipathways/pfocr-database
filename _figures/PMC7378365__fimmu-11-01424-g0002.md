caption: Cytokine signal transduction. (A) General schematic of the JAK-STAT pathway.
  Cytokine binding results in the activation of intracellular kinases (JAKs) that
  phosphorylate and activate STATs, which subsequently translocate to the nucleus,
  resulting in altered gene expression, and negative feedback on the pathway through
  the SOCS proteins. (B,C) Models for complex activation. Cytokines are thought to
  either, (B) dimerise receptors on the cell surface, resulting in kinase autophosphorylation
  and activation or (C) bind to pre-dimerised receptors on the cell surface, resulting
  in receptor activation through conformational alterations of the receptor dimer.
