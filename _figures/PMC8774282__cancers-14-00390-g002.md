caption: 'Mechanisms of resistance to KRASG12C inhibition. (a) Under physiological
  setting, KRAS cycles between active and inactive status. (b) Mechanisms of resistance
  to KRASG12C inhibitors: (1–3) SHP2, SOS1, and KRAS-GTP activate KRAS and its downstream
  cascades, which provides positive feedback to RTKs and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway;
  (4) EMT increases the level of KRAS-GTP and renders KRAS-mutant cells less sensitive
  to KRAS inhibitors; (5) MAPK promotes PD-L1 expression and leads to the immune evasion
  of KRAS-mutant cancer cells. The red lines indicate the targets for therapeutic
  intervention to overcome KRASG12C inhibitor resistance.'
