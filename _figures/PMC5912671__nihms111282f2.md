caption: While an exact mechanism for the FA pathway has yet to be elucidated, it
  seems to function in sensing DNA damage induced by DNA crosslinking agents such
  as MMC and DEB likely plays some role in initiating DNA repair. A significant body
  of work has also pointed to a role for the FA pathway in cell signaling in response
  to stress stimuli and in apoptosis in the cytoplasm, affecting maintenance of the
  hematopoietic machinery so it is likely that at least some of these proteins are
  multifunctional.
