caption: These results and previous studies () demonstrate that two pathways present
  during valvulogenesis are also active in post-natal heart valves. In this study,
  we show that a VEGF-mediated pathway, signaling through KDR/VEGF-R2, results in
  intranuclear NFATc1 and valvular endothelial cell proliferation. A TGF-β-mediated
  pathway induces differentiation to a mesenchymal phenotype (). Whether or not cross-talk
  between these two pathways, as has been shown in the mouse (), occurs in post-natal
  valves and affects post-natal valve function or repair warrants investigation.
