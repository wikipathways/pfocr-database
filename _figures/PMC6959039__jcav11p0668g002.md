caption: Proposed hypothesis of Wnt-Rb interactions in response to treatment of neoplastic
  colonic cells by butyrate/histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis). Exposure to butyrate
  and other clinically relevant histone deacetylase inhibitors represses cell cycle
  progression and upregulate Wnt activity in neoplastic colonic cells; hyperactivated
  Wnt signaling contributes to enhanced apoptosis (and to repressed cell proliferation).
  This manuscript posits that the apoptosis induced by butyrate/histone deacetylase
  inhibitors affects those cells that do not immediately undergo cell cycle arrest
  and thus progress through the G1 to S transition (which includes the inactivation
  of Rb by phosphorylation). The combination of hyperactivated Wnt signaling and inactivated
  Rb induces apoptosis of cells mediated through energy stress (mTOR/TORC1 activity).
  This enhancement of apoptosis can be repressed by cell cycle inhibitors that block
  the G1 to S transition and prevent the inactivation of Rb, or by the mTOR inhibitor
  rapamycin at the level of cellular energy stress. This apoptotic pathway can be
  promoted by knockdown of Rb expression.
