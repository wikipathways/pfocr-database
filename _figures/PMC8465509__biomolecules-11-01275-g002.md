caption: Illustrating the inhibition of transcription factors activated in cancer
  through cardiac glycosides. The binding of CGs on the Na+/K+/ATPase (NKA) channel
  decreases the NKA pump activity and thus down regulates multiple signal transduction
  cascades especially targeting the TF proteins involved in the cell growth and cell
  proliferation by providing signals to the transcription machinery. Dysregulated
  TF and their targeted therapy through CG are represented in the pathway. The scope
  of targeting nuclear receptors via CG is an upcoming purview to be studied for therapeutic
  potential.
