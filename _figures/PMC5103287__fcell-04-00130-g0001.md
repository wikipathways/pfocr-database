caption: DGKα and DGKζ in T cell activation and anergy. Engagement of the TCR in the
  presence of co-stimulation results in strong activation of the PI3K-PDK1-Akt pathway
  (left panel). This pathway leads to mTORC2 signaling. Together with activation of
  the RasGRP1/Ras-Erk1/2 and PKCθ-CARMA1 pathways, they leads to mTORC1 activation.
  mTORC2 also promotes Akt activation via phosphorylation. Activated Akt phosphorylates
  Foxo1, leading to it sequestration in the cytosol and failure to activate DGKα transcription.
  In activated T cells, miR-34a is upregulated, which in turn downregulates DGKζ expression.
  Decreased DGKα and ζ expression leads to strong DAG-mediated signaling including
  increases of AP-1 and NFκB activity. AP-1 associates with NFAT to promote T cell
  activation. At the same time, AP-1 reduces monomeric NFAT to prevent it from inducing
  anergy promoting molecules. Strong DAG signaling together with IP3-CaN (calcineurin)-NFAT
  signaling allows full activation of T cells. In contrast, engagement of TCR in the
  absence of co-stimulation decreases PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling, leading to increased
  nuclear Foxo1 and DGKα transcription (right panel). miR-34a mediated repression
  of DGKζ might also be lost under anergy inducing conditions. Increased DGKα and
  ζ expression may lead to a skewed balance between IP3 and DAG toward strong or selective
  Ca++-NFAT signaling and induction of Egr1/2, which further induce transcription
  of DGKα and DGKζ as well as other anergy promoting molecules. Selective IP3-Ca++-NFAT
  signaling in the presence of weak DAG-mediated signaling induces T cells to enter
  an anergic state.
