caption: H2S acts as a node in plant sulfur metabolism. The transport of sulfate from
  roots is the main way for plants to absorb S elements, which are then transported
  to all parts of the plant through the xylem vessels. Part of the sulfate entering
  the cells will be stored in vacuoles, and the other part will enter the assimilation
  pathway in the chloroplast. After being activated to APS, sulfate is further reduced
  to sulfite via APS reductase with GSH as the reducing molecule. Then, through a
  six-electron reaction with reduced ferredoxin, sulfite is reduced to sulfide under
  the catalysis by SiR. The produced sulfide is a substrate for the synthesis of cysteine.
  Together with OAS, cysteine is synthesized under the catalysis of OAS-TL enzyme.
  Cysteine can be degraded to generate H2S by CDes. Another mode for obtaining S elements
  is from the atmosphere. H2S, COS and SO2 are captured by plants through the stomata.
  COS can be hydrolyzed to produce H2S under the action of CA, while SO2 can be hydrolyzed
  into sulfite and enter the assimilation pathway. The two absorption pathways interact
  and restrain each other
