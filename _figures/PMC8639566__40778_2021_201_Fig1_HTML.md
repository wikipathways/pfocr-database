caption: A RIG-I-Like receptors (RLRs), such as MDA5 and RIG-I, are activated by numerous
  cytosolic ligands, such as mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA), 5′-triphosphate RNA, dsRNA,
  and transposable element transcripts (TEs). cGAS is stimulated in both the cytoplasm
  and nucleus by several endogenous stimuli, such as micronuclei, mitochondrial DNA
  (mtDNA), RNA:DNA hybrids, cytosolic chromatin fragments (CCF), naked cytosolic DNA,
  stalled ribosomes, and most recently RNA. Activation of RLRs promotes oligomerization
  with the mitochondrial anti-viral signaling protein (MAVS), which triggers activation
  of kinases like Tank Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) and IκB kinase ε (IKKε). Stimuli binding
  to cGAS induces its synthetase activity resulting in production of the second messenger
  cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). STING activation by cGAMP results in induction of TBK1.
  Stimulation of either RNA or DNA sensor pathways can ultimately result in the translocation
  of Interferon Response Factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)
  to the nucleus leading to the induction of an IFN response and the secretion of
  proinflammatory cytokines. Cells possess negative regulators of the sensor pathways
  including LGP2 and ADAR1 for RLRs and nucleosome tethering and the circular RNA
  cia-cGAS for nuclear cGAS. B Nucleic acid sensor activation alters stem cell homeostasis
  in cell-type and context-specific manners. Pathway activation can result in diverse
  cellular outcomes, such as expansion, exhaustion, senescence, or cell death. Created
