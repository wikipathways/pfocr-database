caption: Apoptotic caspases elicit Tax-independent transcription of the HTLV-1 LTR.
  A schematic model as outlined by Abou-Kandil et al. is presented wherein ambient
  environmental stress triggers DNA damage in HTLV-1-infected cells. This leads to
  activation of a caspase 2, −9 pathway. In a still to be clarified mechanism, caspase
  9 activity promotes the formation of a Sp1-p53 transcription hetero-complex which
  activates the HTLV-1 LTR by binding to resident Sp1-site. Sp1-p53 bound LTR transcribes
  Tax mRNA which is synthesized into Tax protein. Tax protein feedsback to the LTR
  to further increase transcription. Tax also counters caspase 9-mediated cellular
  apoptosis and elicits additional events that lead to the eventual transformation
  of virus-infected cells.
