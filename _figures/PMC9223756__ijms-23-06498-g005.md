caption: Schematic illustration of sugar metabolism and senescence induction in detached
  N. tabacum YL (A) and FEL (B) discs in response to exogenous sucrose (Suc) application.
  The schematic model represents simulated metabolite dynamics induced by external
  Suc application. This includes Suc breakdown and absorption by the detached leaf
  discs, metabolism via dynamic sugar signaling (specifically G6P-HXK and T6P-SnRK),
  and signaling pathway regulation in detached YL and FEL discs during induced senescence.
