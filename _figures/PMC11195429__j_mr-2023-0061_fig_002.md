caption: Regulation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Different PTMs of cGAS-STING,
  including ubiquitylation, palmitoylation, acetylation, can directly trigger the
  function of cGAS-STING. DNA-PK, as a DNA sensor, has multiple roles in regulating
  the cGAS-STING pathway. In addition to direct regulation, DNA-PK can promote cytoplasmic
  translocation of PARP1, and inhibits cGAS-DNA-binding ability through PARylating
  cGAS. TREX1 and DNAse1L3 degrade the dsDNA, and ENPP1 hydrolyzes extracellular cGAMP,
  thereby all inhibit the activation of downstream STING. Nucleosome DNA can also
  inhibit the cGAS activation through H2A-B binding to the cGAS and maintain cGAS
  in a monomeric state. PTMs, posttranslational modifications; cGAS, GMP-AMP synthase;
  SITNG, stimulator of interferon genes; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; PARP1,
  polymerase 1; TREX1, 3′ repair exonuclease 1; ENPP1, ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase
  phosphodiesterase 1
