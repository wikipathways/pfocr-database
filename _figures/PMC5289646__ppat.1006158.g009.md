caption: 'Proline combustion occurs in tsetse flight muscle (right panel), which produces
  alanine as the main end product. Alanine is transported to the fat body by the hemolymph
  (left panel). Alanine and lipids constitute the major sources for proline synthesis
  in the fat body. Thus, in a transamination reaction, the amino group (-NH2) is transferred
  from alanine to oxoglutarate to yield glutamate and pyruvate. Pyruvate can be carboxylated
  to form oxaloacetate while β-oxidation of lipids becomes the main source of acetyl-CoA.
  The fat body TCA cycle goes from citrate to oxoglutarate, the latter which can be
  an acceptor of -NH2 in a new transamination reaction to produce glutamate. This
  glutamate is further reduced to proline, which is then transported by the hemolymph
  to the flight muscles. In the flight muscles proline is oxidized to glutamate, which
  acts as a donor of -NH2 in a new transamination reaction in which pyruvate is the
  acceptor, forming alanine and oxoglutarate []. Glutamate can also be deaminated
  to form oxoglutarate through glutamate dehydrogenase activity. Oxoglutarate is decarboxylated
  and oxidized to malate through the TCA cycle. The malic enzyme converts malate into
  pyruvate, which can in turn be a new acceptor of -NH2 transferred from glutamate
  (to form alanine and oxoglutarate, as described above) []. During a T. b. brucei
  infection, the parasites use part of the proline produced in the fat body and transported
  by the hemolymph to proliferate and colonize the MG (blue section). In T. b. brucei,
  the first steps of the proline catabolic pathway are similar to those of insect
  muscle cells: proline is oxidized to glutamate, which can either be converted to
  oxoglutarate after deamination or transaminated to produce alanine and oxoglutarate.
  Unlike in tsetse, oxoglutarate can be further converted into succinate, which is
  excreted into the extracellular medium. Succinate can also be converted into malate,
  which is further decarboxylated to produce pyruvate. An additional decarboxylation
  of pyruvate yields acetyl-coA, which can be used to produce acetate that is excreted
  to the extracellular medium. Succinate, acetate and alanine are the major excreted
  products of T. b. brucei insect forms resulting from proline degradative flux (dotted
  arrows). Alanine is excreted and could reach the hemolymph during procyclics proliferation,
  thus enriching the insect pool of available alanine. T. b. brucei also uses glutamate
  produced from proline for the synthesis of EP-procyclins, which are needed for midgut
  procyclic development. In addition, proline is critical to fuel electrons to support
  mt-inner membrane potential, respiratory capacity and ATP synthesis driven by OxPHOS.
  Midgut procyclics strictly depend on proline degradation capability for survival
  within tsetse fly midgut and TbP5CDH (in red) is essential for colonization and
  establishment of parasite infection within tsetse.'
