caption: . Insulin-signaling pathway. Interactions between insulin molecules and the
  insulin receptor initiate a signal transduction cascade via the activation of PI3-K.
  The downstream cascade stimulates the activation of Akt, which facilitates the translocation
  of GLUT-4 transporter towards the plasma membrane, where active glucose transport
  takes place. The transcription factor MEF-2 interacts with the GLUT4 enhancer regions
  to promote the transcription of GLUT4, and upregulate GLUT-4 expression. A, Functional
  glucose transport system, where transported glucose is either stored via glycogenesis,
  or broken down via glycolysis. B, T2DM glucose transport system, where insulin resistance
  inhibits the activation of PI3-K, and disrupts the signal transduction pathway that
  facilitates the translocation of GLUT-4 transporter. Accumulation of glucose molecules
  leads to the onset of hyperglycemia. C, Hibernation glucose transport system. Reversible
  suppression of carbohydrate-based metabolism during hibernation results in the deliberate
  downregulation of the Akt signal transduction pathway. However, enhanced MEF-2 activity
  coupled with upregulated GLUT4 expression during late hibernation suggests the possibility
  of alternative metabolic pathways that regulate the GLUT-4 transport system.
