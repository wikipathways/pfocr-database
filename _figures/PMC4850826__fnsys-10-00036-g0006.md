caption: Summary illustration of methionine metabolic pathways. Metabolites of the
  transmethylation pathway are indicated in red, the transsulfuration pathway is indicated
  in blue, and the gamma-glutamyl cycle is shown in green. Black arrowhead (▴) indicates
  changes in metabolite levels in the plasma of sTBI patients. Open arrows (▵) indicate
  significant changes measured in the mTBI patients as compared to HV. Up arrowheads
  indicate increased levels, whereas down arrowheads indicate decreased levels.
