caption: Regulation mechanism of lncRNA/miRNA axis on microglia polarization. It is
  very common to see that lncRNA can play a role in regulating the microglia through
  mediating the miRNA, like sponging the miRNA. By sponging the miR-136-5p, HOTAIR
  may activate M1 phenotype by upregulating AKT2 to upregulate NF-κB. Similarly, by
  sponging the miRNA, TUG1 may activate the microglia through NF-κB. Meg3 and sponged
  miR-7a-5p may together upregulate the NLRP3 to promote M1 phenotype. GAS5 may increases
  the expression of Notch1 protein signaling through sponging miR-146a-5p to promote
  M1 polarization in microglia, but this influence can be disrupted by STV-Na to convert
  to M2. Meanwhile, one of the crucial pathways in switching the polarization of microglia
  is the activation of STAT family. STAT1 and STAT3 are related to M1 phenotype, while
  STAT6 is related to M2 phenotype. SNHG15 may promotes STAT1 and its NF-κB expression
  by sponging miR-302a-3p. H19 may sponge let-7b to promote STAT3 activation, and
  in some cases, it might activate the M1 phenotype by increasing the HDAC1. However,
  H19 may also exert a promotion of M2 phenotype by sponging miR-29b-3p. Contrary
  to M1 phenotype, SNHG4 may promote M2 polarization in microglia and activate the
  STAT6 by sponging miR-449c-5p. LncRNA may downregulate the expression of miRNA.
  KCNQ1OT1 promotes M1 polarization in microglia by downregulating miR-873-5p to promote
  TRAF6 -mediated p38/MAPK pathway. SNHG14 promotes M1 phenotype by suppressing the
  expression of miR-145-5p on PLA2G4A. lncGm37494 promotes M2 polarization by inhibiting
  miR-130b-3p to promote the PPARγ pathway.
