caption: Schematic drawing of the signaling pathway by which Melatonin stimulates
  dendrite formation. Melatonin (MEL) binds to membrane receptors (MT2/MT1) to activate
  PKC through the diacylglycerol (DAG) pathway. Also, the indoleamine can diffuse
  through the plasmatic membrane to directly interact with protein kinase C (PKC).
  This enzyme may phosphorylate calmodulin (CaM), which can bind to Ca2+/CaM Kinase
  II (CaMKII) with higher affinity. CaM-activated CaMKII undergoes autophosphorylation
  which induces its targeting to the cytoskeletal compartment where it binds and phosphorylates
  MAP2 to constitute dendrites. Also, PKC may increase CaM levels in the soluble fraction
  by an enhanced biosynthesis or by targeting from the cytoskeletal to the soluble
  compartment.
