caption: Dysregulation of Ca2+ and redox signalling in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The
  calcium hypothesis of AD suggests that the formation of Aβ oligomers brings about
  an overall increase in Ca2+signalling that results in a permanent elevation in the
  resting level of Ca2+ to 300 nM that then erases memories soon after they are formed
  by activating calcineurin (CaN) inducing long-term depression (LTD). An elevation
  of Ca2+ sets up a positive feedback loop by acting to stimulate the hydrolysis of
  the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate the Aβ oligomers that bind to the
  cellular prion protein (PrPC) that then activates the InsP3/Ca2+signalling pathway.
  Vitamin D reduces the risk of AD by acting to maintain Ca2+ and redox signalling
  at their normal low resting levels.

  description: Dysregulation of Ca2+ and redox signalling in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
    The calcium hypothesis of AD suggests that the formation of Aβ oligomers brings
