caption: Upon receptor engagement, in addition to transduce apoptosis signaling pathway,
  TRAIL induces activation of TRAF6, at least in part through the E3 ubiquitin ligase
  activity of the TRAF6 RING finger domain via a distinct signaling pathway. In osteoclast
  precursors, TRAIL is not able to induce sufficient amount of signals to activate
  the downstream apoptosis signaling to induce apoptosis; instead, TRAIL induces signaling
  to activate TRAF6 after receptor engagement. TRAF6 is the key molecule linking cytoplasmic
  signaling to the nuclear transcriptional program in osteoclast differentiation and
  bone resorption. These signals include activation of NF-κB by a process of ubiquitination
  in which TRAF6 functions as an E3 ligase  and recruitment of the TAB1-TAB2-TAK1
  complex, which lead to the osteoclast-specific event, that is, autoamplification
  of NFATc1, the master transcription factor for osteoclast differentiation , , .
