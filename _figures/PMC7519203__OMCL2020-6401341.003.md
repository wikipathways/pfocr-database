caption: 'The major pathways of central metabolism and reactions that alter the ratios
  of coenzyme couples are shown. The mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm have independent
  coenzyme couple ratios. ATP synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix is exported
  to the cytoplasm in exchange for ADP by the adenine nucleotide translocase present
  in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Acetyl-CoA synthesized in the mitochondrial
  matrix must also be exported to the cytoplasm to provide two carbon units for fatty
  acid synthesis and protein acetylation. However, acetyl-CoA cannot cross the mitochondrial
  inner membrane. Therefore, the transfer of acetyl units across the inner mitochondrial
  membrane is accomplished using the citrate-pyruvate shuttle or the citrate-malate
  shuttle. These shuttles alter coenzyme levels and use inner membrane carrier proteins
  for the transport of citrate, pyruvate, and malate. The net result of the citrate-pyruvate
  shuttle on coenzyme levels is the use of energy from ATP hydrolysis and NADH oxidation
  to reduce NADP+ to NADPH. There is also a citrate-alpha-ketoglutarate shuttle system
  that has the net effect of using ATP hydrolysis to increase NADPH in the cytoplasm
  instead of increasing NADH or NADPH in the mitochondrial matrix. Synthesizing fatty
  acids in the cytoplasm and reducing antioxidants require NADPH. The malate-aspartate
  shuttle transfers reducing equivalents from NADH between the cytoplasm and the mitochondrial
  matrix. The glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle transfers reducing equivalents from cytoplasmic
  NADH to the mitochondrial ETC. Glucose is catabolized by three pathways including
  the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway that synthesizes uridine diphosphate (UDP) N-acetylglucosamine,
  glycolysis that reduces NAD+ to NADH and synthesizes ATP from ADP and Pi, and the
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) that reduces NADP+ to NADPH and synthesizes ribose
  sugars for nucleotide synthesis. When the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is
  inhibited, lactate is synthesized from pyruvate to recycle NAD+ from NADH so glycolysis
  can continue. However, the lactate is exported from the cell and may contribute
  to lactic acidosis and multiorgan failure []. R-BHB decreases the reliance of cells
  on glycolysis leading to reduced cellular lactate export. Abbreviations: Glut1 and
  Glut3: glucose transporters 1 and 3; MCT: monocarboxylate transporter; NNT: nicotinamide
  nucleotide transhydrogenase; PDC: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.'
