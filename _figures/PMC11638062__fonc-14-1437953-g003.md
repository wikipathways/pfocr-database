caption: Examples of protein phosphorylation and their roles in ovarian cancer. (A)
  Phosphorylation of MLK3 by CDK1/2 on Ser548/Ser770 reduces or increases MLK3 activity,
  which influence the activation of SEK1-JNK pathway, thereby regulating the cell
  cycle of OC cells. (B) RCP stabilizes the integrin β1 and induces the phosphorylation
  of FAK-EGFR, leading to the OC invasion and EMT. (C) Adipocytes induces the phosphorylation
  of SIK2, which then phosphorylates MYLK and activates its downstream effector MYL2,
  ultimately promoting the motility and metastasis of OC cells. (D) FER-mediated phosphorylation
  of IRS4 enhances recruitment of PIK3R2/p85β and then activates PI3K-AKT signaling
  pathway, eventually resulting in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. (E) Estrogen
  diminishes PTEN expression via the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) in OC cells and enhances
  the phosphorylation of PTEN by PKC, thereby promoting cell proliferation and migration
  via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. (F) PDK2-induced FOXK2 phosphorylation sustains
  glycolysis through a positive feedback manner in OC. (G) PBK interacts with TRIM37
  to induce its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, leading to the activation
  of NF-κB signaling and ultimately conferring drug resistance
