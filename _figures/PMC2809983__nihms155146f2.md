caption: 'Mechanistic stages of homologous recombination. Meiotic recombination is
  initiated by a Spo11-mediated double-stranded DNA break (DSB) (1). During presynapsis,
  the initial break is resected to form 3′-OH ending single-stranded DNA tails to
  allow formation of filaments by the DNA strand exchange proteins, Rad51 and Dmc1
  (2). During synapsis, a joint molecule is formed between the broken DNA and an unbroken
  template from the other homolog, positioning the 3′-OH end for DNA synthesis (3).
  During postsynapsis, meiotic recombination bifurcates into at least two primary
  pathways that repair the DSBs: most breaks are repaired to NCO products by SDSA,
  but a fraction of breaks are repaired to CO products by DSBR. SDSA (4b, 5b) dissolves
  the initial D-loop to reanneal the extended invading strand to the second end of
  the break site, resulting in NCO products (; ). Second end capture and dHJ formation
  (DSBR, 5a, 6a,b, 7) () account for the main CO pathway in budding yeast, nematodes,
  and mammals (termed CO pathway 1). Possible scenarios for CO pathway 2 (predominant
  in fission yeast) and 3 (predominant in Drosophila) are shown in . The joint molecule
  physically identified as the SEI intermediate (4a) appears to be a stabilized D-loop
  and is a CO-specific intermediate in meiosis (). The dHJ intermediate (5a) is critical
  for CO formation, possibly through resolution by structure-specific endonucleases
  resembling the bacterial RuvC enzyme (6a). Resolution of dHJs might be biased to
  CO products, such that there is no NCO outcome (“?” in 5a to 5b transition). Alternatively,
  a minor fraction of dHJs may be dissolved into NCO products by a RecQ-family helicase,
  a topoisomerase III, and a junction specificity factor, involving reverse-branch
  migration that confines heteroduplex DNA to the recipient chromosome (6b-7) () (see
  )'
