caption: Oncogenic MyD88 mutations activate the canonical NF-κB pathway. Activation
  of canonical NF-κB signaling can be induced by the triggering of members of the
  IL-1 receptor or the Toll-like receptor family, which localize to the cell surface
  or, in the case of TLR7 and TLR9, to the endosomal compartment. Ligand binding induces
  the recruitment of MyD88 to the activated receptor via its TIR domain and triggers
  subsequent downstream signaling. MyD88 oligomers nucleate the formation of the Myddosome
  which ultimately results in the activation of IRAKs and the recruitment of the E3
  ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. TRAF6 in turn recruits and activates TAK1 which mediates
  activation of the IKK complex resulting in canonical NF-κB activity. The oncogenic
  variant MyD88L265P promotes spontaneous oligomerization and activation of downstream
  signaling independently of receptor stimulation. Mutant MyD88 is denoted with a
  red asterisk. DD, death domain; IL-1R, interleukin-1 receptor; IKK, IκB kinase;
  IRAK, IL-1R-associated kinase; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response protein
  88; TAK1, TGFβ-activated kinase 1; TAB1/2, TAK1-binding protein 1/2; TIR; Toll/interleukin-1
  receptor domain; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TRAF6, TNF receptor-associated factor
