caption: Model for 1,2-propanediol degradation by S. enterica. 1,2-PD degradation
  occurs within the Pdu MCP. The function of the MCP is to sequester propionaldehyde
  to prevent toxicity and carbon loss. The first step of 1,2-PD degradation is its
  conversion to propionaldehyde. The protein shell of the Pdu MCP acts as a diffusion
  barrier and helps to channel propionaldehyde to propionaldehyde dehydrogenase and
  1-propanol dehydrogenase. It is thought that propionyl-phosphate leaves the MCP
  and feeds into the methyl citrate pathway, which provides additional energy and
  biosynthetic building blocks.
