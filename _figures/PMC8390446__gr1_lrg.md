caption: The Networks Involved in Akinetic Mutism Include the Reward Pathway and the
  Motivation-to-Movement Pathway, Otherwise Known as the Parallel Cortico-Striato-Thalamo-Cortical
  (CSTC Loops). Disruptions in the neurotransmitter flow or direct injury to key sites
  in these pathways will directly affect motivation and movement. Here we provide
  examples of locations where COVID-19 and associated systemic and local effects through
  various mechanisms may affect motivational circuity and produce the phenotype of
  AM. DA = dopamine; GABA = gamma aminobutyric acid; GP = globus pallidus; Glu = glutamate;
  MFB = medial forebrain bundle; NAc = nucleus accumbens; PFC = prefrontal cortex;
  Thal = thalamus; VTA = ventral tegmental area.
