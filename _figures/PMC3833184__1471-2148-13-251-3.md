caption: 'Lineage-specific positive selection in the naked mole rat BRCA1/FANC pathway.
  (A) The BRCA1/FANC pathway with genes under positive selection in naked mole rat
  denoted by a star. (B) Is a graphic of the BRCA1 protein from position 1 to 1853
  on the x-axis. Positively selected sites (red dots) from naked mole rat were mapped
  to model sequence (from human). The posterior probability for each site is given
  on the y-axis. Functional information extracted from the human entry in swissport
  is colour coded as follows: blue regions represent (i) Zinc Finger, (ii) Interaction
  region with PALB2, (iii) BRCT1 domain, and (iv) BRCT2 domain while purple vertical
  lines are cancer causing natural variants.'
