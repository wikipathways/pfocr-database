caption: Conceptual diagram of effects of inflammatory and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  (HPA)-axis activation on tryptophan and kynurenine pathways. Cancer and cancer treatment
  can activate inflammation and the HPA axis, which results in increased levels of
  inflammatory cytokines and cortisol. Stimulated by inflammatory cytokines and cortisol,
  the rate-limiting enzymes IDO and TDO are induced and catabolize tryptophan to kynurenine.
  CRP = C-reactive protein; IDO = indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1; IFN-ϒ = interferon
  gamma; IL = interleukin; KAT = kynurenine aminotransferase; KMO = kynurenine monooxygenase;
  TDO = tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase; TNF = tumor necrosis factor.
