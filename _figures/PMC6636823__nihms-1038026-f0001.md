caption: The canonical Wnt signaling pathway. (A) In the absence of Wnt, β-catenin
  (β-cat) interacts with the destruction complex formed by a scaffold protein Axin,
  casein kinase Iα (CKIα) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3b) as well as
  adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and is constitutively phosphorylated and degraded.
  (B) In the presence of Wnt, Wnt binds to frizzled receptor (Fzd) and co-receptor
  low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6). LPR5/6 is phosphorylated,
  which leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of Dishevelled (Dvl). Subsequently,
  Axin is recruited to the receptor complex and the destruction complex is disassembled,
  blocking the phosphorylation of soluble cytoplasmic β-cat. β-cat is then stabilized
  and translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes.
