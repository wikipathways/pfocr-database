caption: The direct Notch signaling effects on ILC biology. The Notch signaling pathway
  is activated by the binding to ligand presented by a neighboring cell. Here, interactions
  of ILC subsets with Delta (Dll) or Jagged (jag) expressing cells such as stromal
  fibroblastic, epithelial or dendritic cells are considered. The molecular steps
  involved in the Notch signaling activation are divided into the stage of Notch target
  gene repression and activation. In the absence of signaling, the DNA-binding protein
  RBP-JK recruits corepressor complexes and histone deacetylases to repress transcription
  of Notch target genes. Alternatively, in case of Notch ligand binding, the ADAM10
  catalyzes a specific S2 cleavage step at the Notch receptor. An S3 further cleavage
  performed by a γ-secretase releases the intracellular domain of Notch (NICD) that
  migrates to the nucleus. Then, NICD interacts with RBP-JK and coactivators like
  Mastermind (MAML-1) and other transcription factors are recruited to form a complex
  resulting in the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes. On the opposite
  cells, the Notch ligands are eliminated from the membrane by the endocytosis of
  the receptors. Globally, endocytosis and membrane trafficking regulate Notch ligand
  and receptor availability at the cell surface. Dtx1 is a Notch target gene found
  as commonly activated into all ILC subsets. For each ILC subset (ILC1, ILC2, ILC3
  and LTi/LTi-like), a number of target genes and effects have been proposed and the
  list here present those that have been experimentally shown to be Notch dependent
  or independent. The effects that might be related to the Notch pathway activation
  but not yet validated are indicated in italics. The figure was created using BioRender.com.

  description: The direct Notch signaling effects on ILC biology. The Notch signaling
    pathway is activated by the binding to ligand presented by a neighboring cell.
    Here, interactions of ILC subsets with Delta (Dll) or Jagged (jag) expressing
    cells such as stromal fibroblastic, epithelial or dendritic cells are considered.
    The molecular steps involved in the Notch signaling activation are divided into
    the stage of Notch target gene repression and activation. In the absence of signaling,
    the DNA-binding protein RBP-JK recruits corepressor complexes and histone deacetylases
    to repress transcription of Notch target genes. Alternatively, in case of Notch
    ligand binding, the ADAM10 catalyzes a specific S2 cleavage step at the Notch
    receptor. An S3 further cleavage performed by a γ-secretase releases the intracellular
    domain of Notch (NICD) that migrates to the nucleus. Then, NICD interacts with
    RBP-JK and coactivators like Mastermind (MAML-1) and other transcription factors
    are recruited to form a complex resulting in the transcriptional activation of
    Notch target genes. On the opposite cells, the Notch ligands are eliminated from
    the membrane by the endocytosis of the receptors. Globally, endocytosis and membrane
    trafficking regulate Notch ligand and receptor availability at the cell surface.
    Dtx1 is a Notch target gene found as commonly activated into all ILC subsets.
    For each ILC subset (ILC1, ILC2, ILC3 and LTi/LTi-like), a number of target genes
    and effects have been proposed and the list here present those that have been
