caption: 'IGF-1R and EGFR/HER2crosstalk occurs by two main mechanisms. Since both
  pathways share a common signal transduction mediator, IRS1, resistance to inhibition
  of one receptor pathway can result from activation of IRS1 by the alternate receptor
  pathway. In addition, the formation of IGF-1R and EGFR/HER2 heterodimers increases
  the functional pool of receptors capable of binding IGF or EGFR/HER2 ligands, thus
  conferring resistance to single-agent targeted therapy.Legend: Insulin like growth
  factor (IGF), IGF receptor 1 (IGF-1R), Hybrid receptors (Hybrid-Rs), epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), insulin
  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)'
