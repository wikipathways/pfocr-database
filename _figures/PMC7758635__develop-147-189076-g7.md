caption: 'BOC is a multi-functional regulator of HH signaling. (A) Summary of BOC
  contributions to HH signaling. Green indicates promotion of HH signaling; red denotes
  HH pathway antagonism; gray suggests no effect; yellow is unknown. (B) Proposed
  mechanisms of action for BOC in HH signal transduction. (1) Complex formation with
  PTCH1: the interaction of PTCH1 and BOC that allows the formation of a receptor
  complex that alternately activates or inhibits HH pathway activity. (2) Ligand sequestration:
  BOC binds HH ligands through its extracellular domain and could antagonize HH signaling
  by sequestering SHH in areas of low SHH concentration. (3) Cytoplasmic domain contributions:
  the unique cytoplasmic domain of BOC could regulate additional downstream signaling
  cascades that enable its tissue-specific functions. (4) HH-independent activity:
  BOC could mediate yet-to-be-identified HH-independent functions that either augment
  or counter the HH response.'
