  (TCM) monomers-loaded exosomes for the treatment of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion
  (CI/R). Curcumin (Cur), baicalin (Bai), quercetin (Que), and ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1)
  encapsulated into naïve or engineered exosomes played neuroprotective roles in CI/R
  injury, including anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis, pro-survival of neurons, enhancing
  the structure integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB), and anti-inflammation via
  inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced neurons apoptosis, decreasing tumor
  necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)/interleukin-1β (IL-1β), activating phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. Nrf2: nuclear factor erythroid-2-related
