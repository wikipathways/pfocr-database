caption: Overview of the distribution of DEGs in the metabolic pathway of oleic and
  linoleic acids during soybean seed development. Gene IDs or names and expression
  patterns are indicated. The expression pattern of each gene is shown by 6 grids,
  which representing the relative log2 (expression ratio) at LO 30, LO 40, LO 50,
  HO 30, HO 40, and HO 50, respectively.
