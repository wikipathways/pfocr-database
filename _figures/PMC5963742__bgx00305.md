caption: 'BPA increases downstream survival proteins and GPER while attenuating the
  growth inhibitory effects of EGFR inhibition. (A) SUM149 cells were treated for
  30 min with BPA at the indicated concentrations and western blotting carried out
  for Bcl-2, SOD1 and GPER expression with GAPDH used as a loading control. Numbers
  represent fold change of total protein relative to GAPDH normalized to untreated.
  (B) Schema: the effect of BPA in ER-negative, GPER-positive () SUM149 IBC cells.
  BPA activates EGFR and ERK signaling leading to an increased proliferative phenotype,
  increased alternate estrogen receptor GPER levels and upregulation of survival and
  antioxidant proteins Bcl-2 and SOD1. Antagonism of EGFR activation by GW583340 (,,),
  respectively, reverses the proliferative effect of BPA. However, BPA can overcome
  the growth inhibitory effect of GW583340 in a longer-term assay of cancer growth
  and progression. The numbers on the schema represent references as described above.'
