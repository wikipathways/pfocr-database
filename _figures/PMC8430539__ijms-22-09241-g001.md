caption: (a) Schematic of the normal autophagic, mitochondrial, and lysosomal pathways.
  The tight relationship between these pathways that become altered in PD enables
  the recycling of deficient organelles and degradation of outer material. Black solid
  arrows show the normal biological pathway. (b) Schematic of PD disrupted pathways.
  Dotted arrows indicate an up-regulation of the biological pathway specified due
  to variants in the genes involved. Meanwhile, inhibiting dotted lines indicate the
  down-regulation/inhibition of the biological pathway specified due to gene variants.
  Colored solid arrows show biological pathways that become disrupted in PD. Accumulation
  of damaged mitochondria and Lewy bodies due to dysfunctional lysosome degradation
  generates the typical PD physiopathology. Designed with biorender.com.
