caption: 'Native and engineered metabolic pathways involved in hydrogen production
  by E. coli. On the right is shown the main multiple pathways of mixed acid fermentation.
  Key enzymes and enzyme complexes are indicated by either the genetic nomenclature
  or the commonly used pathway abbreviation: Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP); Phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxylase (PEPC); Fumarate reductase (frdC); Lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA); Pyruvate
  formate lyase (PFL); Formate hydrogen lyase (FHL); Hydrogenase 3 (Hyd 3); formate
  dehydrogenase-H (FDHH); Uptake hydrogenases; hydrogenase 1 (Hyd 1) and hydrogenase
  2 (Hyd 2); fumarase (fumB); fumurate reductase (frdC). Points where NADH is produced
  or consumed are noted. On the left is a schematic of the SH hydrogenase, which,
  if functional, might consume NADH, reducing protons to hydrogen.'
