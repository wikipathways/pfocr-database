caption: Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (a) In the absence of Wnt protein,
  CK1 and GSK3β, as well as the anchor proteins Axin and APC form a destruction complex.
  β-Catenin in the cytoplasm is phosphorylated by CK1 and GSK3β, followed by bound
  to β-transducin-repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), leading to ubiquitylation and
  degradation by the proteasome. In the nucleus, TCF recruits transcriptional co-repressors
  such as Groucho/TLE (transducin-like enhancer) proteins to block Wnt target genes
  transcription. (b) After Wnt binds to co-receptor LRP5/6 and Frizzled receptor,
  CK1 and GSK3β phosphorylate LRP5/6. β-Catenin is released from destruction complex
  and translocated to the nucleus, which binds to TCF to activate transcription.
