caption: 'The unfolded protein response. The Ire1 pathway of the unfolded protein
  response: (A) Ire1-bound BiP/Kar2 (yellow) is released from the luminal domain of
  Ire1 when unfolded proteins accumulate leading to the oligomerisation and trans-autophosphorylation
  of Ire1 monomers. (B) Unspliced HAC1/XBP1 mRNA is spliced by the endoribonuclease
  domain of Ire1 and the two exons ligated together by tRNA ligase (pink). (C) The
  HAC1i/XBP1s mRNA is then translated into an active protein. (D) The newly synthesised
  protein then enters the nucleus and binds to the promoter regions of target genes.'
