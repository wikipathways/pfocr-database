caption: Working model of the effects of E2 on cell migration. This model is a hypothetical
  construct based on a comprehensive review of the literature and was used as a means
  of designing and interpreting our experiments. Components of the cell migration
  signaling pathways are divided into an input phase, a nodal point, and an output
  phase. This model provides us with a means of integrating the multiple signaling
  pathways involved in cell migration. In the diagram, we have highlighted the molecules
  examined in this study in red. Molecules highlighted in blue are upstream kinases
  or downstream mediators of cell migration not studied in this paper. In this model,
  E2 transactivates the EGF-R, perhaps through a Gα13 mediated GTP-coupled protein,
  and at the same time causes the phosphorylation and activation of c-Src. FAK and
  paxillin form a complex that acts as a nodal point to initiate downstream effects
  on the Rac-1, PAK-1, and Rho proteins responsible for migration. c-Src plays a central
  role in phosphorylating paxillin, in transactivation of the EGF-R, and in binding
  to FAK (). MAPK (ERK1/2) is one of the kinases that phosphorylates and activates
  paxillin. Downstream, PI-3 kinase activates Akt and VAV2, a guanosine triphosphatase
  protein exchange factor that is involved in activation of RAC-1. P-130CAS is activated
  by FAK, which results in the formation of a complex consisting of CRK II, DOCK180,
  and ELMO. This complex activates RAC-1, leading to activation of PAK-1. MAPK is
  involved in the regulation of RHO. RAF (MAPK kinase kinase) and MEK (MAPK kinase)
  are upstream kinases that activate MAPK.
