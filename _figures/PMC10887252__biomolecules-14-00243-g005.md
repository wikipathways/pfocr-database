caption: 'Molecular mechanisms for the involvement of the JNK pathway in insulin resistance.
  The JNK1/2 kinases were important for obesity-driven insulin resistance through
  four mechanisms: (A) In insulin-target cells, JNK1/2 directly phosphorylates IRS1
  and IRS2 at serine and threonine residues, resulting in reduced tyrosine phosphorylation
  of IRS1/2 molecules, which further weakens the response of the PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway to insulin. (B) In adipose tissue macrophages, JNK1/2 phosphorylates some
  transcriptional factors such as c-JUN, ATF2, and ELK1, stimulating gene transcription
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to increased levels of inflammatory “M1”
  cytokines (e.g., IL-6), which ultimately drive insulin resistance. (C) In pituitary
  thyrotropic cells, JNK1/2 phosphorylates c-JUN and c-FOS, sustaining the transcription
  and subsequent expression of DIO2, which mediates the shift from T4 to T3, finally
  leading to a T3-dependent reduction of TSHβ production. The reduced TSH ultimately
  causes low circulating levels of thyroid hormone, increases metabolic efficiency,
  and increases adiposity, finally driving insulin resistance. (D) In hepatocytes,
  JNK1/2 phosphorylates c-JUN, sustaining the transcription and expression of the
  transcription co-repressor NcoR1. Then, NcoR1 represses PPARα-driven gene expression,
  causing a reduction in FGF21 production, fatty acid oxidation, and ketogenesis,
  ultimately promoting fatty liver and insulin resistance'
