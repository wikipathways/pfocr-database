caption: Upon ER stress, IRE1 is activated by autophosphorylation and oligomerization.
  Activated IRE splices the mRNA encoding XBP1 to generate spliced XBP1 (XBP1s). XBP1s
  induces UPR target genes, thereby restoring ER homeostasis and promoting cell survival.
  XBP1s can bind to the VEGF promoter to regulate VEGF transcription. In addition,
  activated IRE1 recruits TRAF2, which, in turn, results in the activation of stress
  kinases, such as JNK and IKK; this leads to induction of inflammatory cytokines.
  Hyperactivated IRE1 degrades mRNA, such as micR-17 and netrin-1, and leads to increased
  pro-angiogenic factor expression.
