caption: Figure 1. Schematic diagram depicting A20-mediated regulation of inflammatory
  pathways. The model represents the two phases of feedback inhibition of inflammation
  with A20 (tnfaip3) as a central player. In the first phase, several stimuli such
  as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-17 induce A20 mRNA expression along with other inflammatory
  proteins. A20 induction is essential as it acts as a feedback inhibitor of its inducing
  inflammatory pathways. This regulation happens in the second phase where A20 functions
  as deubiquitinase enzyme and targets adaptor proteins such as Traf6 and RIP1, resulting
  in downregulation of inflammatory gene expression. These targets vary by the pathway
  being regulated and have been depicted in parentheses next to the stimulus being
  targeted. Further, several proteins such as Tax1BP1, Itch and RNF11 assist A20 in
  its role as a watchdog of inflammatory pathways. However, in case of IL-17, A20
  does not require these adaptors and instead associates with Anapc5.
