caption: The signal cascade of the plant response to HMS. HMs enter the apoplast (brown
  arrow) through passive diffusion. The apoplast HMs transports proteins into the
  symplast (blue arrow) or stimulates unknown receptors to activate the MAPK and CDPK
  signals, thus causing nuclear transcription factor activation under HMS. In addition,
  the Ca activates CDPK and induces phosphorylated NADPH oxidase (RBOH) to produce
  O2, which is converted to H2O2 under the action of superoxide dismutase (SOD). The
  H2O2 enters the symbiote through aquaporins and then causes nuclear transcription
  factor activation in two ways. One way is unknown, and the other is to activate
  the MAPK pathway. The yellow star, “*”, stands for HMs interacting with cell wall
  polysaccharides in the CW.
