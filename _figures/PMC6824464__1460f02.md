caption: Mitochondrial metabolic therapeutic targets. The mitochondria also serves
  as a major energy factory in leukemia cells in support of targeting oxidative phosphorylation
  with biguanide drugs (metformin and phenformin) and mitochondrial protein biosynthesis
  with tigecycline. Leukemia cells, which are highly dependent on arginine–creatine
  metabolism, are sensitive to cyclocreatine-mediated inhibition of creatine kinase.
  Activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway with BH3 mimetic drugs such as ABT199
  activate the BAK–BAX complex to introduce pores in the mitochondrial membrane, enhancing
  the activity of mitochondrial metabolism-targeting drugs.
