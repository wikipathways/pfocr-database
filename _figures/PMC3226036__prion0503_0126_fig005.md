caption: A schematic representation of the two classical apoptotic pathways in mammalian
  cells. The extrinsic is triggered at the cell surface by ligand (CD95L, FASL, TNFα)
  binding to death receptors (CD95, FASR, TNFR) and the ultimate formation of a death
  inducing signaling complex (DISC). Conversely the intrinsic pathway involves alterations
  in mitochondrion permeability as a result of intracellular signals such as DNA damage
  and oxidative stress. The activation of the aforementioned pathways leads to the
  cleavage and activation of initiator caspases 8 and caspases 9 respectively. These
  in turn activate the effector caspases 3 which facilitates DNA fragmentation and
  cytoskeletal protein degradation-leading to the morphological and physical features
  characteristic of apoptotic cells (adapted from reference ).
