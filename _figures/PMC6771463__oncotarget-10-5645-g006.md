caption: AKT2 and MAPK pathways were spontaneously overactivated in CDDP-R/Rad-R BE(2)-C
  cells and CDDP-R/Rad-R SK-N-AS cells growing up in neurosphere media. Despite targeting
  AKT2 by CCT128930, the MAPK pathway is still overactivated in neurosphere formation
  due to the effect of AKT2 inhibition. Therefore, dual-targeting of AKT2 and MAPK
  is far more effective in neuroblastoma cancer stem-like cells. Our data demonstrated
  that dual targeting of AKT2 and MAPK, by CCT128930 and PD98059 respectively, provides
  more effective therapeutic strategies for neuroblastoma cancer stem cells which
  can initiate a risk of relapse.

    Despite targeting AKT2 by CCT128930, the MAPK pathway is still overactivated in

    of AKT2 and MAPK is far more effective in neuroblastoma cancer stem-like cells.

    cancer stem cells which can initiate a risk of relapse.
