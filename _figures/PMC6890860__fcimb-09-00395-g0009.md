caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism by which T. gondii affects
  myogenesis. Upon serum withdrawal myoblasts begin the myogenic process, differentiating
  into myocytes and expressing MRFs in a coordinated fashion, leading to formation
  of mature myotubes, whereas infected myoblast cultures display undifferentiatiated
  cells and smaller myotubes (A). The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is activated in uninfected
  cultures, shutting down cell proliferation and inducing myogenesis, with TGF-β production
  (B). T. gondii infection leads to cadherin down-regulation, thus destabilizing the
  cadherin-catenin complex, inducing β-catenin destruction (C). In addition, intracellular
  parasites release effector proteins that translocate to host cell nucleus and direct
  the expression of inflammation-related genes such as NF-κB, increasing secretion
  of pro-inflammatory molecules (IL-6 and MCP-1) and reducing anti-inflammatory cytokine
  TGF-β1. Hence, infected cultures remain highly proliferative, regardless of parasitism
  rates.
