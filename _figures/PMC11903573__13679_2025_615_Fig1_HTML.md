caption: KATs and HDACs play a role in glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. HDAC3
  can contribute to increased insulin sensitivity, decreased hepatic glucose production,
  and promotion of lipid synthesis and storage within lipid droplets (LDs). By controlling
  GLUT4 to control glucose uptake, HDAC4 and HDAC5 can have an impact on insulin resistance.
  A number of cytoplasmic and/or nuclear proteins are reacetylated by HDAC5 and HDAC6,
  which results in the dysregulation of ICER, poor adipocyte secretion, adipocyte
  malfunction, and systemic insulin resistance. SIRT1 can control skeletal muscle
  insulin sensitivity by way of SF1 neurons. SIRT1 can activate the PI3K signaling
  pathway to improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. By attaching to exosomes
  and activating the TLR4/NF-B signaling pathway, SIRT1 can reduce insulin sensitivity.
  Sirt6 has the ability to inhibit IRS1 phosphorylation, which stops cardiomyocytes
  from developing insulin resistance. SIRT6 promotes mitochondrial health by preventing
  the generation of ROS and lipid buildup. In cardiomyocytes, SIRT6 can control Foxo1
  expression, which in turn controls insulin resistance. HDAC11 deficiency can impact
  lysophospholipid levels, plasma adiponectin levels, and adiponectin expression,
  all of which can impair glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. NuA4/Tip60 complex
  protein loss can result in intracellular insulin buildup and decreased basal insulin
  production. P300 has the ability to acetylate IRS1/2, block the interaction of insulin
  receptors with IRS1/2, and sabotage insulin signaling
