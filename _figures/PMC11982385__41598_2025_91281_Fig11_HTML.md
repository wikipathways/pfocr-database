caption: Integrating multiomics analysis. Metabolic pathway map of glycine, serine
  and threonine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism. The
  metabolites expressed in red and blue were statistically different between DKD and
  DM groups. Red metabolites express upregulated in the DKD group; blue metabolites
  express downregulated in the DKD group. Other related metabolic pathways were expressed
  in solid wire frame
