caption: TLR signaling pathway in innate immune cells. TLR5, TLR4, and the heterodimers
  of TLR2–TLR1 or TLR2–TLR6 prefer to recognize the membrane components of pathogens
  at the cell surface, whereas TLR3, TLR7–TLR8, and TLR9 localize to the endosomes,
  where they recognize the nucleic acids from both the host and foreign microorganisms.
  TLR4 localizes at the plasma membrane, but it is endocytosed into endosomes upon
  activation. Upon binding to their respective ligands, TLR signaling is initiated
  by dimerization of receptors, leading to the engagement of TIR domains of TLRs with
  TIRAP and MyD88 (or directly interact with MyD88) or with TRAM and TRIF (or directly
  interact with TRIF). The TLR4 signaling switches from MyD88 to TRIF once TLR4 moves
  to the endosomes. Engagement of MyD88 recruits the downstream signaling molecules
  to form Myddosome, which is based on MyD88 and contains IRAK4 and IRAK1/2. IRAK1
  further activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase-TRAF6 to synthesize the K63-linked polyubiquitin
  chains, leading to the recruitment and activation of the TAK1 complex. The activated
  TAK1 further phosphorylates and activates the canonical IKK complex, ultimately
  leading to the activation factor NF-κB. The activation of TAK1 also leads to the
  activation of MAPKs, including MKK4/7 and MKK3/6, which further activate JNK and
  p38, respectively. The activation of IKKβ also leads to the activation of MKK1 and
  MKK2, which further activate ERK1/2. The activation of these MAPKs leads to some
  important transcription factor activations, such as CREB, AP1. These transcription
  factors cooperate with NF-κB to promote the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  Engagement of TRIF recruits the TRAF6 and TRAF3. Activated TRAF6 can recruit the
  kinase RIP1 and activate the TAK1 complex and IKK complex, leading to the activation
  of NF-κB and MAPKs. TRIF also promotes the TRAF3-dependent activation of the TBK1
  and IKKϵ (originally IKKi), which further phosphorylates and activates IRF3. Among
  TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 signaling in pDCs, IRF7 can bind to the Myddosome and is directly
  activated by IRAK1 and IKKϵ. Activation of IRF3 and IRF7 leads to the induction
  of Type I IFN.
