caption: The proposed model for MST3 targeting of AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)
  and YAP (Yes-associated protein) in the Hippo signaling pathway to attenuate fibrotic
  functions. When cells reach high density, MST3-induced YAP phosphorylation promotes
  its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a process partially dependent
  on AMPK activation. Dashed arrows indicate a possible but unconfirmed direct link.
  In contrast, MST3-KD fails to activate AMPK, leading to impaired YAP phosphorylation
  and its retention in the nucleus. Nuclear YAP interacts with TEAD (transcriptional
  enhanced associate domain) to promote the expression of CTGF (connective tissue
  growth factor), which in turn stimulates TGF-β (transforming growth factor beta)
  release from tubular epithelial cells, contributing to MST3-KD-induced cell proliferation
  and fibrosis. Metformin-induced AMPK activation rescues YAP phosphorylation, thereby
  alleviating MST3-KD-induced cell proliferation and fibrosis
