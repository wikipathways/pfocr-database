caption: MDSCs are generated from bone marrow progenitor cellsimmature myeloid cells
  in the bone marrow and subsequently differentiate from blood vessels into M-MDSCs
  and G-MDSCs. Negative bacteria secrete CXCL1 to promote M-MDSCs transformation and
  generation, and M-MDSCs are converted into M0 Macrophages. Stimulation with cytokines
  such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, GM-CSF, or bacterial endotoxin induced the conversion of M0
  Macrophages into M1 Macrophages, and IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and IC induced the conversion
  of M0 Macrophages into M2 Macrophages. M2 macrophages induce the production of EMT
  through IL-10/STAT3 and AKT3/PRAS40 pathways. TWEAK produced by macrophages interacts
  with the Fn14 receptor on the surface of CCA cells and affects CCA progression.
  Tumor-derived exosome miR-183-5p up-regulates macrophage PD-L1 expression in TME
  through 315 miR-183-5p/PTEN/AKT/PD-L1 pathway, which promotes the development of
  immunosuppression in ICC. TAMs can interact with TANs, activate OSM/IL-11/STAT3
  signaling pathway, and promote ICC progression. G-MDSCs were converted to N0 TANs
  and subsequently IFNs induced TANs to exhibit an anti-tumor N1 phenotype, whereas
  TGF-β could modulate TANs to exhibit a pre-malignant N2 phenotype. CXCL5 is highly
  expressed in CCA cells and promotes CCA progression by inducing neutrophil recruitment
  in tumor tissues via PI3K-Akt and ERK1/2-MAPK.
