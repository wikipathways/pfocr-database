caption: 'The first proposed mechanism involves the NO/cGMP pathway: Activation of
  the endothelial M3 receptor by ACh induces an influx of [Ca2+]i. Following interaction
  with CaM (calmodulin), Ca2+ activates eNOS and release of NO. NO causes relaxation
  by interacting with the haem group of the enzyme, sGC, which then mediates the formation
  of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and activation of protein kinase G (PKG)
  that relaxes the VSMC. The second vasodilator mechanism is via the arachidonic acid
  (AA) metabolites synthesized through the CYP450 oxygenase pathway: The increase
  in [Ca2+]i elicits translocation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) to the membrane and
  its major hydrolysis product is AA, which can be metabolized by CYP450 oxygenase
  to EETs. The EETs function as messenger molecules that modulate gap junctions (GJ)
  to spread the conductance to the VSMC. EETs may also directly activate a channel/receptor
  on the VSMC to hyperpolarize and dilate the vessel. The third signalling pathway
  involves the AA metabolites generated via the LOX pathway: It is hypothesized that
  LOX and/or its metabolites, namely THETA and HEETA do not pass the GJ as EDHF per
  se but activate GJ to hyperpolarize the VSMC. The forth key players are the gap
  junctions. The fifth proposed mechanism involves the active participation of the
  Kir and Kv1.6 channels: It is hypothesized that both Kir and Kv1.6 channels on the
  VSMC are activated by the increase in extracellular K+ resulting in hyperpolarization
  and vasodilation. The precise identity of the putative channel(s) on the endothelial
  cells that is activated and opened for K+ efflux for hyperpolarization to occur
  is unknown. Question marks represent unknown receptors that are yet to be identified.
  Blockers and inhibitors are indicated in red boxes. Green arrows indicate the activation
  of the gap junctions and downstream receptor(s). Blue solid arrows show potential
  pathways for transfer of hyperpolarization from the endothelium to the smooth muscle
  cells. Blue quadrangular point arrow indicates the hypothesized transfer of hyperpolarization
  via an unknown receptor on the VSMC.'
