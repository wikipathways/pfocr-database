caption: 'Wnt signaling and macrophages. Wnt signaling pathway is one of the most
  important pathways regulating cells proliferation, differentiation, polarity, and
  migration. At least two distinct pathways transduce Wnt signals: canonical Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway and the β-catenin independent noncanonical Wnt pathway (Wnt/Ca2+signaling
  and Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling). Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is
  upregulated in many cancers. Lack of β-catenin degradation and its nuclear accumulation
  is an evidence of activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway. β-catenin acts in the nucleus
  as a transcription factor increasing cancer proliferation and survival. Activation
  of Wnt/PCP signaling during development results in cytoskeleton remodeling (by Rho,
  Ras, and JNK) promoting cell movement. Calcium dependent Wnt increases the motility
  of various cell types by regulating the formation of lamellipodia. It also increases
  expression of vimentin and therefore induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition,
  the crucial step in metastasis. Macrophages infiltrated to tumour mass inhibit cell
  proliferation as effect of inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. However canonical
  and noncanonical Wnt pathways work on the principle of antagonism, so macrophages
  inhibiting β-catenin pathway activate noncanonical Wnt pathway and lead to cytoskeleton
  remodeling in cancer cells and facilitate their motility.'
