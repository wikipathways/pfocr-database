caption: Cholesterol synthesis pathway, associated diseases and putative pathogenic
  mechanisms (reviewed in refs. ,  and ). Blockade of the C14 sterol step might lead
  to an accumulation of precursors with subsequent up or downregulation. This accumulation
  could affect important pathways such as farnesylation, heme and ubiquinone synthesis,
  or even the first hydroxyl methyl glutaryl CoA reduction step. Equally or more likely
  might be a deficiency in downstream products. LBR catalyzes an early step in post-squalene
  cholesterol synthesis. Failure in this step might subsequently result in different
  amounts or composition of derivates from intermediate steps, such as meiosis activating
  sterols, oxysterols, vitamin D, and finally of the end-product cholesterol and its
  derivates bile acids and steroid hormones. Cholesterol is a major component of membranes
  and lipid rafts and is produced in significant amounts by the fetus itself. Insufficient
  amounts and altered membrane composition could impair fetal development. Greenberg
  dysplasia could even feature a modified hedgehog pathway, as a result of cholesterol
  modification. Hedgehog proteins are modified by cholesterol. Altered hedgehog signaling
  was shown in other diseases of the post-squalene pathway and mutations in genes
  of the hedgehog pathway cause a number of skeletal defects. These defects include
  brachydactyly and polydactyly that are also seen in Greenberg dysplasia. Impaired
  vitamin D metabolism might be another potential effector in Greenberg dysplasia
  since LBR affects a step upstream of the vitamin D precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol.
  Vitamin D is essential for bone development. Vitamin D is produced in significant
  amounts in the placenta and the fetus itself. Though to our knowledge, whether or
  not there is de novo synthesis of vitamin D in the fetus is not entirely clear;
  however, at least locally such synthesis might be possible. There are overlapping
  pathophysiologic and histologic findings in Greenberg dysplasia, rickets in children,
  and osteomalacia in adults. Skeletal mineralization depends on the presence of sufficient
  amounts of calcium and phosphate at the sites of mineralization. Furthermore, chondrocytes,
  osteoblasts and collagen matrix must position and function properly. Mineralization
  occurs in chondrocytes. If osteoblasts produce more matrix than the chondrocytes
  can mineralize, rickets or osteomalacia can develop. Similar mechanisms could be
  operative in a very early stage of skeletal development in Greenberg dysplasia.
  The imbalance could either be due to absence or mal-position of calcium by vitamin
  D deficiency or by abnormal chondrocyte function. In addition, rickets show inadequate
  mineralization of the chondrocyte matrix in the growth plates. In both rickets and
  Greenberg dysplasia there is a disorganization or complete failure of chondrocytes
  to form chondrocyte columns. Epiphyses are stippled, growth of long bones is impaired
  in both conditions. Osteomalacia is also seen in neurofibromatosis and as a complication
  of anticonvulsive therapy.
