caption: 'The mechanism of CHOP regulation in ER stress induced apoptosis. Upstream
  regulatory pathway: Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, which results in the translation
  of ATF4. ATF4 translocates to the nucleus, which increases the expression of CHOP
  and ATF3. CHOP and ATF3 then bind to the promoters of the target genes, upregulating
  their expression. ATF6 translocates to Golgi apparatus where it is activated by
  proteolysis. Activated ATF6 transcriptionally upregulates CHOP expression. Additionally,
  ATF6 can regulate XBP-1 to activate CHOP. Activation of IRE1α processes unspliced
  XBP-1 mRNA into activated XBP1(s), which enters the nucleus and controls the expression
  of CHOP. IRE1α activates the apoptotic signaling kinase 1 (ASK1), which in turn
  phosphorylates p38 MAPK/JNK, and activates CHOP. In addition, Bag5 can reduce CHOP
  expression and increase Bcl-2 gene expression. Downstream regulatory pathway: CHOP
  triggers the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through the inhibition of BCL-2, BCL-XL,
  MCL-1, and the upregulation of BIM, which regulates BAX-BAK-mediated mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization. This leads to cytochrome c release and the caspase
  cascade. CHOP can also regulate apoptosis by upregulating the expression of the
  TRB3 gene and preventing Akt phosphorylation, which inhibits the activity of caspases-3/9.
  CHOP triggers the extrinsic apoptotic pathway through the upregulation of DR4 and
  DR5, which regulate the caspase-8-mediated cascade. This leads to Bid cleavage into
  tBid, which regulates the BAX-BAK-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathways. CHOP
  can also trigger the ERO1α-IP3R-Ca2+-CaMKII pathway. ROS can also trigger Ca2+-dependent
  mitochondrial apoptosis. CHOP can directly activate GADD34 (DNA damage protein),
  which, combined with phosphatase 1 protein (PP1), dephosphorylates eIF2α, and results
  in protein translation recovery, increased ER stress, and cell apoptosis.'
