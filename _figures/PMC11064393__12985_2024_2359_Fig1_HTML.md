caption: Schematic diagram of cGAS-STING signaling pathway. (cGAS, as an innate immune
  sensor, is able to recognize various cytoplasmic dsDNA from pathogens, apoptotic/dead
  cells, mitochondria, and others. The interaction between cGAS and dsDNA leads to
  enzymatic activation of cGAS and catalyzing the formation of 2’,3’-cyclic GMP-AMP
  (cGAMP) from ATP and GTP. cGAMP binds to the dimer of interferon gene stimulatory
  factor (STING) located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Then, STING moves
  from the ER to Golgi body via the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment, and then serves
  as a signaling platform for TBK1 phosphorylation. TBK1 phosphorylates the C-terminal
  domains of STING, and then IRF3 is recruited and phosphorylated. Finally, dimerized
  IRF3 can act as a transcription factor to initiate the transcription of type-I IFN
  and subsequent induction of ISG expression, eliciting antiviral defense)
