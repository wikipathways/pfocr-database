caption: Schematic diagram of the Notch pathway. The Notched mono-precursors are furin-cut
  in Golgi bodies to form mature Notched receptors and transferred to the plasma membrane.
  The Notch is activated when Notch ligands on adjacent cells combined with them,
  leading to second and third cut by ADAM and γ-secretes, releasing Notch intracellular
  domain NICD, which is transferred into the nucleus and combined with CSL to initiate
  downstream gene expression.
