caption: '(A) The mechanism of Aβ toxicity. Accumulating Aβ will initially results
  in Aβ oligomerization, gradually deposits as the forms of fibrils and senile plaques.
  Furthermore, Aβ aggregation alters the kinase/phosphatase activity that leads to
  the Tau protein hyperphosphorylated, which causes the formation of neurofibrillary
  tangles (NFTs), and eventual synaptic and neuronal dysfunction and AD. (B) The proteolytic
  processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ biogenesis. APP is a transmembrane
  glycoprotein with a large luminal domain and a short cytoplasmic domain, and it
  is processed through amyloidogenic or non-amyloidogenic pathway. The amyloidogenic
  pathway is the process of Aβ biogenesis: APP is firstly cleaved by β-secretase,
  producing soluble β-APP fragments (sAPPβ) and C-terminal β fragment (CTFβ, C99),
  and C99 is further cleaved by γ-secretase, generating APP intracellular domain (AICD)
  and Aβ. The non-amyloidogenic pathway is an innate way to prevent the generation
  of Aβ, as APP is firstly recognized by α-secretase within Aβ domain, generating
  soluble α-APP fragments (sAPPα) and C-terminal fragment α (CTFα, C83), C83 is then
  cleaved by γ-secretase, producing non-toxic P3 and AICD fragments.'
