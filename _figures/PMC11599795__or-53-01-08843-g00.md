caption: Hippo signaling pathway is a key regulator of cellular and systemic metabolism,
  maintaining organ size and tissue homeostasis by controlling cell proliferation,
  survival and regeneration. When the Hippo signaling pathway is activated (in the
  ‘ON’ state), MST1/2 kinases phosphorylate LATS1/2, which in turn promotes the phosphorylation
  of YAP/TAZ. This leads to the retention of YAP/TAZ in the cytoplasm and/or their
  degradation via the proteasome pathway, thereby inhibiting their transcriptional
  co-activator activity. Conversely, when the Hippo signaling pathway is inactivated
  (in the ‘OFF’ state), dephosphorylated YAP/TAZ can freely translocate to the nucleus,
  where they bind to the TEAD family of transcription factors and activate the expression
  of a range of genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, and survival. MST, macrophage-stimulating;
  LATS1/2, large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2; YAP, Yes-associated protein; TAZ, transcriptional
  co-activator with PDZ-binding motif; TEAD, TEA domain; SAV1, Salvador family WW
  domain-containing protein 1; MOB1, MOB kinase activator 1; P, phosphorylated
