caption: MiRNA-mRNA gene interaction network of four selected targets from the PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway. The miRNA-mRNA interaction network was constructed using Cytoscape.
  The most enriched PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was used to select 4 angiogenesis-associated
  genes which were dysregulated in PCOS and 4 miRNAs regulating these genes. Purple-colored
  nodes represent miRNAs that are selected for validation by gene expression studies.
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
