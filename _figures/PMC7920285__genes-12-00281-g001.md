caption: Schematic illustration of the differences in the localization of the upstream
  regulators and the core cascade components of the Hippo signaling pathway during
  murine and bovine embryogenesis. (a) Organization hierarchy of the upstream regulators
  (AMOT and Nf2) and core cascade components (large tumor suppressor 1 and 2 (LATS1/2)
  protein kinase) of the Hippo signaling pathway during pre-compaction stages (two-cell
  to eight-cell stages) of mouse embryogenesis. Arrows represent the direction of
  activation of the protein kinase components. (b) Protein localization of the upstream
  regulators (AMOT and Nf2) and the core cascade components (mammalian sterile twenty
  like 1 and 2 (MST1/2) and large tumor suppressor 1 and 2 (LATS1/2)) of the Hippo
  signaling pathway during the pre-compaction stages of bovine embryogenesis. Dotted
  arrows represent a potential link in the activation of the protein kinase components.
  (c,d) Localization of AMOT, Nf2, MST1/2, and LATS1/2 in TE (trophectoderm) and ICM
  (inner cell mass) during blastocyst formation in murine and bovine models, respectively.
  (c-i) The Hippo signaling pathway is inactive (Hippo “Off”) in the outer polar TE
  cells, where AMOT and Nf2 cause the nuclear retention of YAP1. (c-ii) The Hippo
  signaling pathway is active (Hippo “On”) in the apolar ICM cells, where AMOT and
  Nf2 cause the phosphorylation of LATS1/2 and the subsequent cytoplasmic retention
  of p-YAP1. (d-i and ii) Protein localization of upstream regulators (AMOT) and core
  cascade components (MST1/2 and LATS1/2) of Hippo signaling pathway components in
  TE and ICM during bovine blastocyst formation. Dotted lines represent the proposed
  mechanism of functioning of the Hippo signaling pathway during (i) TE and (ii) ICM
  formation.
