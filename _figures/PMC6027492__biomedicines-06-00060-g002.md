caption: Mitochondrial protein lipoylation. (A) Schematic of the pathway involved
  in the formation of lipoylated proteins, highlighting some of the enzymes involved.
  Octanoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) is formed from FAS II. Acyl-CoA Synthetase Family
  Member 3 (ACSF3) is thought to be the first enzyme involved in this pathway. Mitochondrial
  enoyl-CoA reductase (MECR) is involved in the formation of acyl-ACP. Lipoylated
  substrates consist of the E1 and E2 subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex,
  the E2 subunit of the branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex, and the H subunit
  of the glycine cleavage system (GCSH). GCSH is thought to be first octanoylated
  by Lipoyl(Octanoyl) Transferase 2 (LIPT2), and lipoic acid synthase (LIAS) then
  catalyses the formation of lipoate from the octanoylated protein. LIPT1 is thought
  to be involved in the transfer of the lipoate moieties to the other E1/E2 subunits.
  (B), The lipoyl moiety of dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (DLST) within the
  2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc) is shown.
