caption: 'A summary schematic overview highlights the signaling pathway proposed in
  the present study. Note: Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase is composed of 5 subunits,
  the membrane anchored catalytic subunits gp91phox (Nox2) and p22phox and the cytosolic
  subunits p47phox, p40phox, and p67phox. It is speculated that the intracellular
  increase in superoxide (O2−) leads to an increase in extracellular H2O2 (, ). P,
  phosphorylated; AA, arachidonic acid; PKC, protein kinase C; [Ca2+]i, intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration.'
papertitle: COX-1-derived PGE2 and PGE2 type 1 receptors are vital for angiotensin
  II-induced formation of reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ influx in the subfornical
  organ.
