caption: Development of low-grade [type I pathway with KRAS or BRAF mutation) and
  high-grade serous carcinoma [type II pathway with TP53 mutation] from tubal epithelium
  by way of a cortical inclusion cyst and cystadenoma or an intraepithelial carcinoma
  (STIC) implanting directly on the ovary developing into a high-grade serous carcinoma.
