caption: cAMP stimulates p70s6k and Akt through distinct pathways. cAMP robustly activates
  p70s6k (bold arrow) through a PKA-dependent pathway. In contrast, cAMP exerts modest
  effects on Akt and membrane ruffling (thin arrow) which are PKA independent. Both
  PKA-dependent and -independent effectors contribute to cAMP-stimulated mitogenesis,
  including mTOR/p70s6k, PI3K, and Rac1. cAMP effects on Akt and membrane ruffling
  are PI3K dependent, although the mechanism of PI3K activation by cAMP has not been
  elucidated (X). In contrast, cAMP effects on p70s6k are primarily PI3K independent,
  although a weak PI3K-dependent contribution (dashed arrow) potentially mediated
  by PDK1 or Akt may be present.
