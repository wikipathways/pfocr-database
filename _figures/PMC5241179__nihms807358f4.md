caption: 'In a low-cell-density community, the c-di-GMP content is elevated, resulting
  in expression and activation of VpsR and VpsT. Motility is diminished by binding
  of H-NS to the flrA promoter and inhibition of FlrA by c-di-GMP. In a high-cell-density
  community, HapR is expressed to lower the c-di-GMP pool and terminate transcription
  of vpsT. Environmental stress and the absence of VpsT favor expression of RpoS.
  RpoS further diminishes the c-di-GMP pool to enhance the activity of FlrA and activates
  expression of IHF that lessens H-NS occupancy at the flrA promoter. In addition,
  initiation of flrA transcription by σS is more resistant to H-NS remaining bound
  to the promoter. Downregulated or inactive transcription factors, as well as disabled
  regulatory conections, are represented in light graey font. Symbols: ↓, positive
  regulation; ⊥, negative regulation.'
