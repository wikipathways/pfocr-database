caption: 'Crosstalk between mTOR and novel pathways: A source of potential new targets
  for the treatment of NAFLD-associated HCC. (a). Notch and mTOR synergistically promoted
  gastric cancer cell proliferation, while Notch or mTORC1 combined inhibition inhibited
  tumor cell growth. Hepatic Notch signaling increases insulin sensitivity by acting
  on IRS1 and decreases mTORC1-mediated SREBP-1c activity and hepatic triglycerides.
  However, the role of Notch and mTOR crosstalk in NAFLD remains unclear. The combination
  of (b). mTOR pathway inhibitors and Hedgehog pathway inhibitors inhibited esophageal
  cancer cells by up to 90%. The Hedgehog signaling pathway directly regulates Hilnc
  (Hedgehog signaling induced long non-coding Rnas) that participates in mTOR regulated
  liver lipid metabolism. Gli1 is identified as the substrate of S6K1, providing a
  Gli1 activation mechanism between mTOR and Hedgehog signaling pathways that is not
  dependent on Smoothened, a G-coupled receptor-like signal sensor. Therefore, it
  is speculated that crosstalk between the mTOR and Hedgehog signaling pathways can
  regulate NAFLD and even HCC through lipid metabolism. (c). YAP has a positive control
  effect on both mTORC1 and mTORC2, and the YAP protein can inhibit the initiation
  of autophagy and affect the progress of HCC by activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway,
  suggesting that the mTOR signaling pathway and Hippo pathway are crosstalk regulating
  HCC.'
