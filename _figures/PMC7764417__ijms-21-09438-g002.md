caption: Putative model for the development of (cardiac) lipid-induced insulin resistance.
  Increasing concentrations of extracellular fatty acids (mostly palmitate) stimulate
  the uptake of lipids into myocytes via CD36, resulting in an increase in endosomal
  pH (1). This loss of endosomal acidification (red arrow) causes loss of endosomal
  CD36 retention, thus allowing an abnormal amount of CD36 molecules to relocate to
  the sarcolemma (2). Loss of endosomal acidification also impacts GLUT4, which is
  kicked out from the endosome to relocate to GSVs (3). The increased presence of
  CD36 at the plasma membrane (4) causes an increase in fatty acid uptake and subsequent
  accumulation of lipid species such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramide (CER). DAG
  is known to inhibit IRS-1 via activation of JNK/IKK and PKCθ, finally hindering
  the insulin signaling pathway. CER acts on Akt2 (5), making the kinase unable to
  exert the inhibitory phosphorylation on RabGAP AS160 (6). Consequently, Rab protein
  activity is impaired (7), thus halting the translocation of GLUT4 vesicles from
  GSVs to the sarcolemma (8). Accordingly, glucose uptake is inhibited (9). Note the
  resultant juxtaposed localization of CD36 and GLUT4 in the insulin-resistant myocyte.
