caption: The schematic diagram of therapeutic mechanism of Nar against Hcy induced
  endothelial dysfunction. Obviously, Nar can elevate AMPKα/Sirt1 signaling pathway
  consequently rescue the Ca2+ disrupted mitochondrial function and reduce the ROS
  production. Furthermore, activated AMPKα/Sirt1 signaling pathway will upregulate
  the activity of downstream protein of eNOS subsequently increase the production
  of NO, ultimately ameliorate the ED.
