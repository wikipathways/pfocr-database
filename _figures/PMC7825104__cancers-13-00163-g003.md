caption: Adrenergic signalling pathway and mechanisms. The binding of Epinephrine
  (E) and Norepinephrine (N) to β-adrenergic receptors (β-ADR) results in Gαs-mediated
  activation of adenylyl cyclase (1,2). This causes a transient influx of cyclic AMP
  (cAMP) (3). cAMP activates the two effector pathways, Protein Kinase A (PKA) and
  exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP (EPAC) (4). PKA phosphorylates
  Bcl-2 associated agonist of cell death (BAD) which makes the cells resistant to
  apoptosis and anoikis (5). It also phosphorylates β-adrenergic receptor kinase (BARK)
  which recruits β-arrestin, further phosphorylating Src and Focal Adhesion Kinase
  (FAK), resulting in cell motility (6). In cervical cancer cells, sustained adrenergic
  signalling that results in PKA activation causes inhibition of the tumour suppressive
  Hippo Yap pathway. PKA targets the tumour suppressor Neurofibromin 2 (NF-2), as
  a result of which the downstream phosphorylation of mammalian Ste20-like kinases
  ½ (MST1/2; homologs of Drososphila Hippo (Hpo)), large tumour suppressor ½ (LATS
  ½; homologs of Drosophila Warts (Wts)) and Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) is inhibited.
  The dephosphorylated YAP translocates into the nucleus and inhibits apoptosis (7).
  β-adrenergic receptors activated by stress lead to cAMP-PKA/AKT/mTOR/P70S6K/HIFα
  pathway-dependent proliferation and angiogenesis (8). EPAC leads to the activation
  of BRAF-MAPK signalling pathway (9). The transcription factors STAT3, CREB, ETS,
  AP1 are phosphorylated by PKA as well as by EPAC (10) which upregulate the expression
  of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs), SNAI-2 involved in angiogenesis and invasion. Adapted from [,,,].
