caption: T-cell immune axis and associated cytokines in the pathogenesis of psoriasis,
  hidradenitis suppurativa, atopic dermatitis, and alopecia areata. (A) Psoriasis
  develops through the aberrant activation of the dendritic cells producing IL-12
  and IL-23. The dendritic cells induce the differentiation of the Th 17 cells and
  Th1 cells. IL-23 promotes the Th17 cells to secrete IL-17, IL-22, and TNF-α. In
  keratinocytes, IL-17 also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides (S100A7/A8/A9
  proteins and beta defensins). These cytokines promote keratinocyte proliferation
  and neutrophil recruitment, resulting in the formation of psoriatic plaques. (B)
  In hidradenitis suppurativa, the T cells involved in the pathogenesis of hidradenitis
  suppurativa include the Th1 and Th17 cells. IL-23 induces the differentiation of
  the Th17 cells and overexpression of IL-17. IL-17 induces the expression of the
  proinflammatory proteins (S100A8/A9) and NLRP3 in the keratinocytes. More inflammatory
  cytokines are recruited to the follicular unit and perilesional skin. (C) In atopic
  dermatitis, with impairment of the skin barrier in patients with atopic dermatitis,
  the damaged keratinocytes produce inflammatory cytokines (IL-17E). The cytokines
  stimulate the ILC2s to secrete type 2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13). IL-17E also inhibits
  the synthesis of FLG. IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31 directly stimulate the sensory nerves
  to promote pruritus. (D) In alopecia areata, the elevated IFN-γ levels in the perifollicular
  area activate the differentiation of the CD4+ T cells into various types of T cells,
  as shown. Th17 cells act on the hair follicle by producing proinflammatory mediators
  (IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-26), ultimately leading to the disruption of hair growth.
