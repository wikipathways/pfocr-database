caption: Mechanism of GLP-1RAs in improving VSMC dysfunction. AngII promotes ROS production
  in VSMCs and activates the NF-κB signaling pathway. AGEs activate NOX expressed
  on endothelial cells to produce ROS. ROS leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, inducing
  phenotype switching and premature senescence of VSMCs. GLP-1RAs inhibit the activation
  of Rac1 via the cAMP/PKA pathway, thereby resisting Ang II-induced ROS production
  and corresponding VSMC senescence. In addition, GLP-1RAs inhibit VSMC proliferation
  and migration by suppressing inflammatory signaling pathways such as NF-κB, ERK1/2,
  and PI3K/AKT. Activation of AMPK by APN inhibits the ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathways and attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction. GLP-1RAs increases the expression
  of APN in VSMCs. AGEs, advanced glycation end products; AKT, protein kinase B; AMPK,
