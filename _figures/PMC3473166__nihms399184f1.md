caption: 'The figure illustrates the signaling cascade (left side of a generic myeloid
  leukocyte) by which extracellular ATP-induced gating of P2X7 receptor channels serially
  triggers changes in intracellular cation concentrations, perturbation of mitochondrial
  function, and assembly of NLRP3/ASC/Procaspase-1 inflammasome complexes in macrophages,
  monocytes, dendritic cells, or microglial cells. Accumulation of active caspase-1
  in the cytosol facilitates efficient proteolytic processing of cytosolic proIL-1β
  (a 33 kDa protein) to the mature, 17 kDa IL-1β cyotokine. The right sight of the
  figure illustrates the four major pathways of non-classical secretion (also termed
  unconventional secretion) by the cytosolic IL-1β can be exported to the extracellular
  compartment. These include: the 1) exosome pathway (violet); 2) the microvesicle
  pathway (black); 3) two variants of the autophagy pathway that may involve exocytosis
  of either autophagosomes (green) or autophagolysosomes (blue); 4) the secretory
  lysosome pathway (red). The bottom left of the figure illustrates a fifth pathway
  (brown) for IL-1b export as a secondary sequelae of regulated macrophage death by
  caspase-1 dependent pyroptosis or, possibly, damaged mitochondria-dependent necroptosis.
