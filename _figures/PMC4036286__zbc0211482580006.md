caption: Adenylate cyclase-cAMP pathway. Adenylate cyclase is activated by G protein-coupled
  receptors in response to extracellular stimuli. Adenylate cyclase converts ATP to
  cAMP which activates serine/threonine kinases PKA and Akt leading to activation
  of effector proteins such as adhesion proteins at the cell surface. cAMP is hydrolyzed
  to AMP by phosphodiesterases such as PDE4A whose function is activated by PKA-dependent
  phosphorylation (a feedback loop controlling cAMP levels). Our results indicate
  that hydroxycarbamide treatment is associated with an increase in PDE4A expression.
