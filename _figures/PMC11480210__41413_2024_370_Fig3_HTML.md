caption: The role of 14-3-3 proteins in the TNFR signaling pathway. Interacting with
  key signaling mediators downstream of TNFR activation, 14-3-3 proteins regulate
  apoptosis, inflammation, cell survival, and proliferation at various junctures.
  Upon TNF-α stimulation, both TNFR1 and TNFR2 trigger a multitude of intracellular
  signaling cascades. Notably, 14-3-3 directly associates with the TNFR2 receptor
  complex, potentially modulating the effects of progranulin (PGRN) and Atsttrin,
  which directly bind to TNFR2 and influence its signaling outcomes. This interaction
  may have implications for the regulation of downstream signaling events such as
  the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, ERK, and NF-κB transcriptional activity,
  all of which are critical for cell survival, proliferation, and immune responses.
  Furthermore, the binding of 14-3-3 to phosphorylated MEKK3 and p65 within the TNFR2
  signaling branch suggests a role in fine-tuning the balance between pro-survival
  and pro-inflammatory signals. Figure created with BioRender.com
