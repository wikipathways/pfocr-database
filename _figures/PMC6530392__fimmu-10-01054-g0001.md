caption: 'Sublytic C5b-9 promotes tumor growth and survival by activating several
  signaling pathways. The assembly of C5b-9 complexes in the cellular membrane activates
  the heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gi subtype (). The β-γ complex is thought to
  activate several intracellular signaling cascades, including: a) phosphatidylinositol
  3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway. Activated Akt phosphorylates and inactivates
  the pro-apoptotic factors Bad and Bim, resulting in the release of the pro-survival
  factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which migrate into the mitochondrial matrix and inhibit
  the release of cytochrome C (cyto C), thus inhibiting apoptosis. Akt also phosphorylates
  the transcription factor FOXO1, promoting its nuclear exclusion and inhibiting FOXO1-mediated
  transcription of pro-apoptotic factors (, ); b) Ras-Raf-MEK1-ERK1 signaling pathway,
  resulting in the activation of transcription factors associated with cell proliferation
  (AP-1 and Elk1); c) JAK1-STAT3 signaling pathway, leading to the formation of STAT3
  homodimers and their nuclear translocation (, –). Another recently described mechanism
  which may account for the activation of genes associated with cell proliferation
  is the activation of the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway by the endosomal
  C5b-9 complexes, involving the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (). An important consequence
  of C5b-9 assembly is the increased concentration of cytosolic calcium ions (Ca2+),
  either through direct entry of extracellular Ca2+ or by endoplasmic reticulum release
  triggered by intracellular second messengers () (not shown).'
