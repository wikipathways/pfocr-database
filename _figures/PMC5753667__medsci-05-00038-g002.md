caption: The mammalian polyamine pathway. Polyamines are derived from the amino acid
  ornithine, which is decarboxylated by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) to form the
  diamine putrescine. Putrescine undergoes the sequential addition of 2 aminopropyl
  groups to form spermidine followed by spermine. These reactions are catalyzed by
  the spermidine and spermine synthases (SRM and SMS, respectively), using decarboxylated
  S-adenosylmethionine as the aminopropyl donor. Catabolism of spermine back to spermidine
  can occur through direct oxidation via spermine oxidase (SMOX) or by acetylation
  at the N1 position by spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT), followed
  by oxidation by the acetylpolyamine oxidase (PAOX). This latter two-step mechanism
  also back-converts spermidine to putrescine via an N1-acetylspermidine (N1-AcSpd)
  intermediate. Alternatively, acetylated spermine and spermidine can be readily exported
  from the cell.
