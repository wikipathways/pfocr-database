caption: 'Circulating IGF-1 from multiple sources (bone, tumor cells, adipocytes,
  etc.) binds to IGF-1R, which leads to downstream activation of Akt and suppression
  of apoptosis. BMS-754807 inhibits IGF-1R phosphorylation and thus leads to partial
  inhibition of Akt1 and Akt2. While Akt2 phosphorylation is Src independent, Akt1
  phosphorylation is also Src mediated, so full blockade is dependent on dual inhibition
  of Src and IGF-1R. Activation of IGF-1R, but also of many other cell surface receptors
  (integrins, vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor [VEGF-R], Axl, c-Met, etc.),
  involves Src activation, which increases PCa cell motility, migration, and invasion.
  Dasatinib inhibits Src phosphorylation, thereby decreasing invasive/migratory properties
  of PCa cells. Since Akt is activated by both IGF-1R and Src, blockade of either
  pathway alone will only partially inhibit Akt phosphorylation, whereas the dual
  blockade almost completely abrogates Akt phosphorylation. FAK: focal adhesion kinase.'
