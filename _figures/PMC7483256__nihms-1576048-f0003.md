caption: Targeting DNA double strand break repair pathways. Double strand breaks (DSBs)
  are potentially lethal lesions which can be repaired by multiple pathways. A. Nonhomologous
  end-joining (NHEJ) is the primary repair mechanism for DSB repair throughout the
  cell cycle. Binding of the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer recruits the DNA-PKcs signaling
  kinase and Artemis end-processing nuclease. DNA polymerases fill gaps and then the
  nicks are sealed by the XRCC4-Ligase4 complex to complete repair. Repurposed drugs
  thought to target NHEJ may affect damage detection, end processing and/or ligation.
  B. Microhomology mediated end-joining (MMEJ) is an error-prone DSB repair pathway
  that serves as a “backup” for NHEJ. In a process that depends on PARP activity and
  MRE11/RAD50/XRS1 (MRN), 5′ ends can be resected by MRE11 and CtIP. When sequences
  of microhomology are exposed (marked in red), the two 3′ overhangs may anneal. After
  fill-in and trimming by Polymerase θ, nicks are sealed by Ligase 1 and Ligase 3,
  often resulting in insertion or deletion (indel) mutations. Repurposed drugs that
  suppress indels may have value in favoring homology-directed repair by CRISPR/Cas9.
  C. Homologous recombination (HR) uses the sister chromatid as a template for repair
  and is thus restricted to S/G2 phase. As in MMEJ, DSBs are recognized by the MRN
  complex, but resection of the 5′ end leads to assembly of RPA and then RAD51 on
  the 3′ strand. In a process driven by BRCA1, other factors and DNA polymerases,
  the homology search by the RAD51 nucleofilament enables priming off the 3′ end to
  copy the complementary sequence on the sister chromatid (marked in blue) across
  the break site. The two 3′ ends anneal and are trimmed and ligated to complete precise
  repair. Most repurposed drugs that inhibit HR appear to target RAD51 and/or BRCA1,
  redirecting repair to MMEJ.
