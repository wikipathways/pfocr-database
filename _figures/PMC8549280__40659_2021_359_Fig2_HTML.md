caption: 'The SREBP pathway in A mammals and B X. dendrorhous. The SREBP pathway is
  involved in the regulation of lipid homeostasis and metabolism, and is regulated
  by several independent mechanisms including the use of subcellular compartmentalization
  to ensure its activation, when required. In sterol-replete mammalian cells, the
  Insig proteins (isoforms: Insig-1 and Insig-2) bind cholesterol-loaded protein SCAP
  to retain the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. On the other
  hand, when cells are depleted of sterols, the SREBP-SCAP complex is transported
  to the Golgi apparatus where SREBP is sequentially processed by proteases S1P and
  S2P. As a result, the N-terminal domain (NH2) of SREBP, which contains the basic
  helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) domain, is released, migrates to the nucleus,
  and binds as a dimer to the sterol regulatory elements (SREs) in the promoter region
  of target genes activating their transcription. In X. dendrorhous, the SREBP homolog
  is Sre1, which is processed by a S2P homolog, named Stp1. Figure adapted from []'
