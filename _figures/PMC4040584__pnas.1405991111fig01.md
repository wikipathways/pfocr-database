caption: Expansion of the SDF-1/CXCR4 migratory signaling network in breast cancer
  stem cells. Using a model of human breast cancer, Yi el al. () isolated cells with
  tumor-initiating capacity (i.e., cancer stem cells). Following stimulation with
  SDF-1, the authors used quantitative (isotope reductive dimethylation) LC-MS to
  identify and quantify over 11,000 protein phosphorylation sites. This analysis revealed
  many previously unrecognized downstream phosphorylation events involving 60 cell
  mobility-related proteins, 50 kinases, and 8 negative-feedback regulators, of which
  43, 44, and 6 proteins, respectively, had not been previously associated with SDF-1/CXCR4
  signaling. To derive biological insight from this complex data, the authors used
  computational methods to integrate their phospho-proteomic data with known pathways
  from the literature, which allowed for identification of a novel PKA-MAPK2K-ERK
  pathway. Purple circles represent measured phosphorylation sites.
