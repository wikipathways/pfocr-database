caption: 'Conceptual illustration highlighting plausible mechanisms of action of seaweed
  extract with respect to fungal and bacterial disease control: seaweed extract may
  affect directly pathogen agents or indirectly through eliciting the plant defense
  machinery Such elicitation occurs via the up regulation of several defense genes,
  thus positively affecting specific metabolic pathways, namely the phenylpropanoid
  pathway, which induce the biosynthesis of several secondary metabolites involved
  in disease suppression. JA: Jasmonic acid, SA: Salycilic acid, PAL: Phenylalanine
  ammonia-lyase, CHS: Chalcone synthase, CHR: Chalcone reductase, IFS: Isoflavone
