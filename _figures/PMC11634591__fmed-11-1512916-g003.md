caption: cGAS-STING pathway plays a critical role in mediating obesity in adipose
  tissue. Overnutrition induces mitochondrial stress and dysfunction, leading to the
  release of mtDNA in adipocytes due to DsbA-L inhibition. This mtDNA is detected
  by cGAS, which subsequently activates the STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway, resulting in
  IFN-1 production or activation of the TBK1-NF-κB pathway, both of which promote
  the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Similarly, LPS activate IRF3 via TLR4
  receptor binding. The activation of TNFR1 by TNF-α and TLR4 by palmitate synergistically
  increases CCL2/MCP-1 production, promoting macrophage infiltration and inflammation
  in obesity. Additionally, IRF3 suppresses GLUT4 expression in adipocytes, leading
  to insulin resistance. On the other hand, STING activation of TBK1/IKKε inhibits
  PDE3B/4 expression, which suppresses cAMP-PKA signaling, thereby reducing thermogenesis
  and contributing to obesity attenuation
