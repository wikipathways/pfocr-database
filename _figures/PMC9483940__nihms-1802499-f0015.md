caption: Biosynthesis of tunicamycins. (A) Genetic organization of the biosynthetic
  gene cluster. NCBI accession number is tunicamycin (tun) from Streptomyces chartreusis
  NRRL 3882, HQ111437. (B) Pathway for the biosynthesis of the trisaccharide core
  and subsequence acylation/deacylation steps. Proteins labelled in bold blue have
  been functionally assigned in vitro using recombinant enzymes; the structure of
  TunA [Protein Data Bank (PDB) 3VPS] has been solved. PPi, inorganic pyrophosphate;
  AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine.
