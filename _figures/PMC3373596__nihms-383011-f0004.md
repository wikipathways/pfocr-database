caption: 'Pathway of EET synthesis and action in the vascular wall. EETs may hyperpolarize
  and relax vascular smooth muscle by two additional mechanisms: (A) EETs are released
  by the endothelium and activate TRPV4 channels on smooth muscle cells. The calcium
  (Ca) influx through TRPV4 channels promotes Ca sparks from the endoplasmic reticulum
  activating large conductance, Ca-activated K (BKCa) channels. This promotes K efflux,
  an increase in the membrane potential (Em) or hyperpolarization and relaxation.
  (B) EETs are released by the endothelium and stimulate cyclic AMP production through
  activation of adenylyl cyclase by the guanine nucleotide binding protein Gαs. Protein
  kinase (PKA) is activated by cyclic AMP leading to phosphorylation and activation
  of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. This promotes hyperpolarization and relaxation'
