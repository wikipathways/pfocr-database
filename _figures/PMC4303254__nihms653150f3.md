caption: Gene product interaction network of immune and inflammatory responsive genes
  associated with smoking in females generated from the information in the Ingenuity
  knowledge base, version 7.6. Genes or gene products are represented as nodes, and
  the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge (line).
  Solid lines represent direct relationship and dashed line represents indirect relationship
  between nodes. The intensity of node color indicates the degree of up- (red) or
  down- (green) regulation in smokers. Grey nodes represent molecules not altered
  in smokers added by Ingenuity to show network connections. The yellow node is a
  cigarette smoke toxicant manually added to the network. The shape of each node indicates
  the gene product’s functional class as shown in the key. The genes involved in immune/inflammatory
  responses are highlighted in yellow, and those involved both in immune/inflammatory
  responses and the NK cell signaling pathway are highlighted in purple. Immune/inflammatory
  genes known to be influenced by female hormones (progesterone and estrogen) are
  linked with yellow edges.
