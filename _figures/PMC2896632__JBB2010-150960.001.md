caption: Signaling pathway of the KRAS protein. Following EGF binding to its receptor
  and activation of tyrosine kinases, the KRAS protein becomes activated by binding
  to GTP, transducing the activation signal to the nucleus by MAPKs and PI3K/AKT-mediated
  cascades. Specifically, the active state of the KRAS protein is facilitated by binding
  to the Grb2 protein, which interacts with the SH3 domains of the SOS protein, a
  member of the nucleotide exchange factor family. In the GTP state, KRAS is able
  to activate downstream proteins and to regulate cell transformation.
