caption: Overview of signaling pathways involved by ncRNAs during the differentiation
  of DMSCs. Red indicates signaling pathways associated with osteogenic differentiation.
  Purple indicates signaling pathways associated with odontogenic differentiation.
  Arrow indicates promotion and T indicates inhibition. Collectively, ncRNAs related
  to Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway are miR-140-5p, miR-214, circRNA124534 and lncRNA
  POIR. MiR-20a-5p is involved in TGF-β, BMP and MAPK signaling pathway. NcRNAs associated
  with the BMP signaling pathway are lncPCAT1 and circRNA FAT1. LncRNA GAS5 is involved
  in BMP and MAPK signaling pathway. MiR-143-3p inhibits OPG-RANKL signaling pathway.
  NcRNAs related to the MAPK pathway are miR-143-5p, miR-218. MiR-875-5P is related
  to PDGF signaling pathway. There is a reciprocal positive feedback loop between
  miR-21 and STAT3 at low concentrations of TNF-α (1–10 ng/ml). MiR-140-5p inhibits
  the TLR-4 pathway under LPS stimulation. MiR-34a inhibits Notch signaling pathway.
