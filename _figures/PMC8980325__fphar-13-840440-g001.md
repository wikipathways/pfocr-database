caption: 'Lipid metabolism and pathways closely related to the occurrence and development
  of tumors. (A) PPAR signaling (). The complete transcriptional activity of PPAR
  requires the binding of homologous lipid ligands. Endogenous PPAR ligands are originated
  from the nuclear membrane or transferred from the cytoplasm. PPAR can shuttle between
  the nucleus and cytoplasm, and it is mainly located in the nucleus. Ligand binding
  promotes PPAR conformational changes, enabling PPAR to interact with another nuclear
  receptor (retinoic acid IDX receptor, RXR) to form heterodimerization. The combination
  of PPAR heterodimer with PPAR response element (PPRE) in the target gene promoter
  activates the expression of related genes. (B) The metabolism pathway of fatty acid
  and cholesterol (). There are two sources of intracellular fatty acids: intake of
  exogenous fatty acids and de novo synthesis of fatty acids. Exogenous fatty acids
  can be absorbed by cells through specific transporters, e.g., CD36, FATP, and FABPpm.
  Endogenous fatty acid synthesis begins with the product of acetyl-CoA from the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCA) and depends on the activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS). The intracellular
  fatty acids are stored in lipid droplets (LD). Fatty acids will be catalyzed through
  mitochondria β-oxidation to produce energy. Intracellular cholesterol homeostasis
  mainly includes the regulation of de novo synthesis, uptake, storage, and efflux.
  Cells can absorb exogenous cholesterol through receptors, e.g., LDLR and VLDL. Endogenous
  cholesterol is synthesized by the mevalonate pathway. Excessive cholesterol in the
  cells will be transported outside through transporters, e.g., ABCA1, ABCG1, or converted
  into cholesterol esters by ACAT1 catalysis and stored in a form of lipid droplets.
  Cholesterol can be converted into cholesterol derivatives under the action of related
  enzymes e.g., CYP27A1 to support life activities. (C) Arachidonic acid and PGE2
  signaling (). Arachidonic acid (AA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that forms the
  phospholipid domain of cell membranes and could be released from the cell membrane
  by cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Free AA is metabolized to PGG2 and PGH2
  by cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) or COX-2. PGH2 is relatively unstable and successively
  metabolized to PGE2 by cPGES and mPGES1/2. PGE2 could bind to four GPCRs (EP1-EP4).
  Different receptors are coupled to different signaling pathways. Reprinted under
