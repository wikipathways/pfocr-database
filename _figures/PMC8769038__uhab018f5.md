caption: Putative flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in G. biloba. The proposed metabolic
  pathways were drawn based on information in the literature and the KEGG database
  of metabolic pathways. The differentially abundant metabolites and differentially
  expressed genes between the control and truncation treatments are listed in blue
  and red text, respectively.
