caption: Tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrH) is a pterin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes
  the hydroxylation of tyrosine to form dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) using a non-heme
  iron atom in the active site to activate molecular oxygen (). Formation of DOPA
  is the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of the catecholamine neurotransmitters
  dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Because of the important physiological
  role played by TyrH, its activity is regulated at the posttranslational level by
  phosphorylation of serine residues and by feedback inhibition by catecholamines.
  The redox state of the iron plays a central role in this regulation, as shown in  (,
  ). For catalysis, the active site iron must be ferrous (); during catalysis it is
  oxidized to higher levels but returns to the ferrous form by the end of the catalytic
  cycle (). However, in a side reaction independent of catalysis, oxygen can oxidize
  the ferrous iron to the inactive ferric form (); the iron must then be reduced back
  to the ferrous form for DOPA formation to resume. The in vivo reductant for TyrH
  is unknown, although tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) has been proposed to be the natural
  reductant due to its role as substrate for the enzyme (). Oxidation of the ferrous
  enzyme to the ferric form results in an enzyme with high affinity for catecholamines
  (). Consequently, if these products of the catecholamine bio-synthetic pathway accumulate
  in the cell, the ferric enzyme can be trapped as the inactive catecholamine complex.
  Consistent with such a model, when TyrH is isolated from eukaryotic sources, the
  protein contains a mixture of catecholamines bound to the ferric iron atom (). To
  regain activity, this bound catecholamine must be released from TyrH. However, dissociation
  of dopamine and other catecholamines is extremely slow, such that the inhibition
  is effectively irreversible (). Phosphorylation of TyrH at Ser40 increases the rate
  constant for dissociation for dopamine and the other catecholamines by 3 orders
  of magnitude, effectively relieving the inhibition and forming the free ferric enzyme
  which can then be reduced to the active ferrous form (, ). A requirement for reductive
  activation has also been demonstrated for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheH) (-),
  but its role in regulation of that enzyme is not clear.
