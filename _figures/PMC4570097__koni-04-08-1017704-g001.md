caption: T-MPs function as novel cell-free cancer vaccines. Upon UV irradiation, tumor
  cells release MPs that contain tumor antigens and DNA fragments. After being taken
  up by DCs, DNAs of T-MPs induce the expression of type I IFN by activating the cGAS/STING
  pathway. Type I IFN, in turn, enhances DC maturation by upregulating CD80, CD86,
  and MHCII. Armed DCs then activate tumor-specific T cells, leading to cytolysis
  of tumor cells.
