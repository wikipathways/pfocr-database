caption: IAP antagonists and NF-κB signaling in osteoclast lineage cells. a NF-κB
  signaling in the absence of IAP antagonists. cIAP1/2 are required to activate classical
  NF-κB pathway (left side) downstream of TNFα, promoting cell survival. In the alternative
  NF-κB pathway (right side), NIK is eliminated by cIAP1/2-induced proteosomal degradation,
  keeping this pathway off in the absence of stimulating signals. b NF-κB signaling
  in the presence of IAP antagonists. The classical NF-κB pathway (left side) is critical
  for IAP antagonist-induced apoptosis. In the presence of IAP antagonists, cIAP1/2
  are degraded and the IKK complex is transiently activated, resulting in a pulse
  of TNFα synthesis. In the absence of cIAP1/2, the new round of TNFα-initiated signaling
  leads to caspase activation and promotes cell death. The alternative NF-κB pathway
  (right side) is responsible for IAP antagonists-enhanced osteoclast differentiation.
  IAP antagonist-induced cIAP1/2 degradation stabilizes NIK, resulting in a sustained
  activation of the alternative pathway, and a promotion of osteoclastogenesis
