caption: In KRAS mutant oncoprotein-expressing lung cancer cells, basal expression
  levels of CP110 protein are reduced. As a result, anaphase catastrophe is readily
  conferred after inhibiting CP110 activity by use of a CDK2 inhibitor. This increases
  sensitivity of KRAS mutant lung cancer cells to treatment with a CDK1 or CDK2 inhibitor.
  The font size is meant to convey the relative contribution of the highlighted species.
  The arrow size displays the relative extent of the indicated engaged pathway.
