caption: In an inactivated state, β-catenin in the hepatocyte membrane forms a bridge
  between actin and E-cadherin. When Wnt signaling is off, β-catenin (in a multiprotein
  complex with GSK-3β, axin, CK1α, β-TrCP and APC) is phosphorylated by GSK-3β and
  CK1α and ubiquitinated by βTrCP. In the end, β-catenin is degraded by the proteosome.
  When Wnt signaling is on, Wnt-Fz and LRP coordinate the activation of Dvl, leading
  to dissociation of the multiprotein complex and resulting in the inactivation of
  GSK-3β (no phosphorylation anymore). Excessive free β-catenin translocates to the
  nucleus and binds to TCF/LEF transcription factors, resulting in a transcriptional
  activation of Wnt target genes. GSK-3ß, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta; CK1α, casein
  kinase 1 alpha; ß-TrCP, beta-transducin repeat containing protein; Wnt-Fz, Wnt-Frizzled
  transmembrane receptor; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; Dvl,
  Disheveled gene; TCF/LEF, T cell-specific transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer
  binding factor.
