caption: Molecular alterations cause metabolic switching in cancer cells and severe
  metabolic changes in the tumor microenvironment. a Non malignant (quiescent) cells
  rely on OXPHOS as primary ATP source under normoxic conditions. FAO also contributes
  to the cellular ATP pool. Without extrinsic stimuli the PI3K-Akt1 pathway is inactive.
  Downstream targets are also blocked, e.g. HK, PFK2, FOXO, HIF1α, mTOR, and NRF2.
  In addition, AMPK keeps HIF1α and mTOR in check. p53 participates in the repression
  of glycolysis by expression of TIGAR, PTEN, and SCO2. Myc as well as PGC1α are not
  active in quiescent cells and do not contribute to glycolysis. In order to sustain
  cellular homeostasis cells have a low energy demand and low biosynthetic activity.
  b Cancer cells acquire a series of mutations that foster glycolysis in several ways.
  Oncogenic PI3K-Akt1 signaling and inhibited AMPK signaling promote activation of
  pro-glycolytic events. These include activation of glycolytic enzymes namely HK
  and PFK2 and activation of transcription factors such as FOXO and in combination
  with hypoxia- HIF1α, which in turn induce the expression of glucose transporters
  glut1 and glut4 and other glycolytic enzymes. Moreover, mTOR signaling is elevated
  which causes an increase in biosynthetic precursors. PI3K-Akt1-activated NRF2 induces
  expression of glycolytic genes as well as NADPH and anti-oxidants. PGC1α can also
  contribute to the cellular anti-oxidant pool. Mutation or deletion of p53 causes
  loss of glycolytic inhibitors like TIGAR, PTEN, and SCO2. Oncogenic Myc induces
  the expression of glycolytic genes, glucose and glutamine transporters. Additionally,
  Myc enhances the amount of biosynthetic precursors by expression of GLS and the
  amount of cellular NAPDH and anti-oxidants via PKM2. Expression of IDO mediates
  the degradation of tryptophan to N-formylkynurenin, the first step of tryptophan
  catabolism in the kynurenin pathway. These mutations elevate nucleotide, amino acid,
  and lipid biosynthesis paired with enhanced catabolic pathways to enable cancer
  cells to proliferate rapidly
