caption: Putative therapeutic mechanisms of action of 11-de in 6-OHDA-induced cell
  death. 6-OHDA increases the upregulation of DJ-1 protein expression and translocates
  from the cytosol into the nucleus and mitochondria. The cytosolic DJ-1 inhibits
  downstream signaling via PTEN. The 6-OHDA-induced downregulation of PTEN activates
  the Akt pathway and its downstream Nrf2 and p-CREB pathways. Activation of Akt induces
  Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus, and results in the upregulation of HO-1, but
  not SOD-1. Moreover, 6-OHDA increases the translocation of p-CREB into nucleus and
  the upregulation of BDNF expression. The compound 11-de not only significantly enhanced
  6-OHDA-induced upregulation of cytosolic DJ-1 expression but also promoted DJ-1
  translocation into mitochondria and the nucleus. In contrast, 11-de activates Akt
  and induces the upregulation of Nrf2 and p-CREB. The 11-de-induced upregulation
  of DJ-1 inhibits downstream PTEN and attenuates the 6-OHDA-induced downregulation
  of Akt. The translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus leads to the upregulation of
  HO-1 and SOD-1 expression. In contrast, 11-de also increases the expression of p-CREB,
  and increases its binding affinity with the CRE domain. In addition, 11-de upregulates
  expression that is downstream of the p-CREB pathway, such as BDNF expression.
