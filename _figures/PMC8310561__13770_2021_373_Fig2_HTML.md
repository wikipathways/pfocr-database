caption: Schematic diagram of various immune responses induced by particulate vaccine
  system. Upon encounter with an antigen, B cells convert themselves to antibody secreting
  plasma cells that produce antibodies for excreting the pathogens to mucosal surfaces
  (mucosal response) whereas dendritic cells (DCs) present the antigen via major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules to CD8 + and CD4 + T-cells. Activation
  pathway of CD8 + T cells and CD4 + Th1 cells produces cytotoxicT lymphocytes (CTL)
  and activated macrophages that kill intracellular pathogens or infected cells (cellular
  response) while activation pathway of CD4 + Th2 cells produce sactivated B lymphocytes
  that secrete antibodies for neutralization of extracellular pathogens (humoral response).Adapted
  from Singh et al., Chitosan-based particulate systems for the delivery of mucosal
  vaccines against infectious diseases. International Journal of Biological Macromolecules
