caption: GLN is protective in the intestine by preventing FN degradation after thermal
  injury, as well as by activating the protective FN-Integrin signaling pathway. GLN
  phosphorylates ERK1/2 via the FN-Integrin pathway leading to HSF-1 activation, which
  enhances HSP expression to prevent apoptosis.
