caption: 'Molecular mechanism of the PPO, R2R3-MYB, F3H genes and their role in oxidative
  stress and secondary metabolism: In wild-type potato tubers (left panel), PPO enzymes
  encoded by the StPPO gene are produced to catalyze the oxidation of chlorogenic
  acid to o-quinones upon tissue damage. These reactive intermediates polymerize into
  melanins, resulting in visible tissue browning and reduced tuber quality. Concurrently,
  two tandem R2R3-MYB transcription factors regulate the anthocyanin biosynthetic
  pathway by binding to the promoters of key structural genes (DFR, ANS, UFGT) and
  recruiting bHLH and WDR cofactors to form the MBW complex, promoting transcription
  and anthocyanin accumulation in the tuber flesh. F3H catalyzes an essential early
  step in this pathway by converting flavanones to dihydroflavonols, enabling flux
  toward anthocyanin biosynthesis and contributing to red and purple pigmentation.
  CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of StPPO genes (right panel) disrupts PPO activity,
  preventing quinone formation and subsequent melanin production, thereby reducing
  tissue browning. Simultaneously, knockout of both tandem R2R3-MYB genes abolishes
  MBW complex assembly and downstream transcriptional activation of anthocyanin pathway
  genes. As a result, anthocyanin synthesis is silenced, leading to unpigmented tuber
  flesh. Complete CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of all F3H alleles likewise terminates anthocyanin
  biosynthesis by blocking dihydroflavonol production, leading to stable, multigenerational
  tubers with yellow, unpigmented flesh, while preserving yield and general performance'
