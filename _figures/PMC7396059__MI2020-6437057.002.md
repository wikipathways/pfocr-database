caption: Model of signaling pathways by NCRs. After binding to their ligand, NKp46
  and NKp30 associate with the adaptors FcεRIγ and/or CD3ζ, while NKp44 binds to DAP12.
  Furthermore, ITAMs in the adaptor protein intracellular regions are phosphorylated
  by SFK. Phosphorylated ITAMs activate the tyrosine kinases Syk and/or ZAP70. This
  recruits and activates downstream molecules such as PLCγ, PI3K, and Vav1/2/3 with
  the help of LAT. PLCγ further causes Ca2+ influx. PI3K and Vav1 can recruit the
  small G protein Rac1 and activate the MAPK signaling pathway through cascade phosphorylation
  of the PAK1–MEK–Erk signaling pathway. In addition, the intracellular region of
  NKp44 contains an ITIM sequence that may be related to inhibitory signaling, but
  the specific mechanism is not yet clear.
