caption: 'Model of the visual motion pathway of the fly from the eyes to the spatial
  integration in the lobula plate. A spatial low-pass filter approximated by a two-dimensional
  Gaussian function (inset) accounts for the optic properties of the ommatidia. The
  peripheral processing is approximated by an array of temporal band-pass filters
  (indicated by the impulse response of the filter) followed by a lateral inhibition,
  together providing the input to an array of elementary motion detectors (EMD) sensitive
  to horizontal motion. Each EMD is subdivided into two mirror-symmetric subunits
  with oppositely preferred directions, each consisting of a temporal high-pass filter,
  a low-pass filter and a multiplication stage. The retinotopic motion information
  of the half detectors with the same preferred direction is lumped into one channel
  (broad gray lines). The motion information conveyed by the channels is spatially
  integrated by the model FD1 and by model cells presynaptic to the vCH cell. The
  models of the H1, HSE, HSS, Hu, and vCH cells are as developed and tested in a previous
  study [Hennig et al. ()]. The retinotopic motion information is shunted before it
  reaches the FD1 cell (box “shunting inhibition”). The shunting is accomplished by
  a division by the vCH cell signal. The transmission is characterized by a half-wave
  rectification and a sigmoidal transmission function. Before the spatial signals
  are integrated by the model FD1 (box “FD1”), the excitatory and the inhibitory input
  channels are individually transmitted via a sigmoidal transmission function and
  weighted according to the spatial sensitivity of the respective FD1 cell (inset
  “weighting function right FD1”). The retinotopic signals are spatially integrated
  by means of an electrical equivalent circuit of a one-compartment passive membrane
  patch. One channel controls the inhibitory, the other the excitatory conductances
  of the integrating element. The integrated signals of all elements are temporally
  low-pass filtered to account for time constants of the cell. Additionally, the model
  FD1 is characterized by a threshold, because as a spiking element, it cannot convey
  negative signals. Inset box at bottom right: explanation of symbols referring to
  the computations in the circuit.'
