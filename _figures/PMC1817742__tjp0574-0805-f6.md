caption: 'Schematic illustrating parallel signalling pathways mediating early LTP
  (E-LTP) at MPP–granule cell synapses in the dentate gyrus, as compared to the single
  pathway at LPP–granule cell synapses () and Schaffer collateral–CA1 synapses ()
  in the adult mouse. Blockade of CaMKII activity has little effect on E-LTP at MPP–granule
  cell synapses because PKA/MAPK signalling is unhindered. The reverse situation also
  holds: blockade of PKA/MAPK has little effect on E-LTP at these synapses unless
  CaMKII signalling is also disabled. At present it is not possible to conclude which
  of these signalling pathways, if any, predominates under normal circumstances.'
