caption: '(a) The state of the auxin signalling pathway under low auxin conditions.
  Auxin responsive factors (ARFs) are bound as dimers (CTD, C‐terminal dimerization
  domain) to auxin‐responsive elements (AuxREs) on the DNA with their B3‐type DNA‐binding
  domain. Aux/IAA dimers are bound via their domain III/IV to a type I/II Phox/Bem1p
  (PB1) protein–protein interaction domain. Domain I of Aux/IAAs interacts with TOPLESS
  and TOPLESS‐RELATED corepressors (TPL/TPR) that recruit a histone deacetylase (HDAC).
  Resulting modifications of the DNA lead to down‐regulation of the transcriptional
  activity of auxin‐regulated genes. (b) The state of the auxin signalling pathway
  under high auxin conditions. Auxin acts as molecular glue between domain II of Aux/IAA
  proteins and the SCFTIR1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (subunits: Skp1, S‐phase kinase‐associated
  protein 1; Rbx1, RING‐box protein 1; Cul1, Cullin 1; TIR1 F‐box, F‐box protein).
  Ubiquitin (Ub) is first activated by the E1 ubiquitin‐activating enzyme and then
  bound to domain II of Aux/IAA proteins via an E2 ubiquitin‐conjugating enzyme and
  the Rbx1 subunit of the SCFTIR1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. The ubiquitinated Aux/IAA proteins
  are degraded in the 26S proteasomes and are no longer bound to ARF dimers. ARF dimers
  are released and can now operate as transcriptional activators or repressors'
