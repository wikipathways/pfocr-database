caption: Pathways for ATP and GTP de novo synthesis. IMP is a precursor of both GTP
  and ATP. IMP dehydrogenase, encoded by guaB, channels IMP down a pathway for the
  synthesis of GTP, while adenylosuccinate synthetase (purA) generates the ATP precursor
  adenylosuccinate (). GTP is required for the PurA-catalyzed synthesis of adenylosuccinate.
  Thus, a block in GTP synthesis ultimately inhibits ATP synthesis. IMP dehydrogenase
  is the target enzyme for the inhibition of GTP synthesis by either ppGpp or mycophenolic
  acid (, ).
