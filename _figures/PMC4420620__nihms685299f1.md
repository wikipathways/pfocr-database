caption: Autophagy proceeds through a series of steps, which include induction, phagophore
  nucleation, elongation and fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome for degradation
  of the sequestered cargoes. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is
  a negative regulator of autophagy that, under nutrient-rich conditions, prevents
  the assembly and the activation of the autophagy-initiating ULK complex (which comprises
  ULK1, ATG13 and FIP200) (step 1). mTORC1 is inactivated in response to various stimuli
  (for example, starvation) and autophagy is induced. Viral G protein-coupled receptor
  (vGPCR), K1 and viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6) of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
  (KSHV) promote the constitutive activation of mTORC1, which may suppress autophagy
  in infected cells. Phagophore nucleation is driven by the class III phosphoinositol
  3-kinase complex (PI3KC3), which includes Beclin1 (step 2). The activity of this
  lipid kinase complex is inhibited by the anti-apoptotic viral B cell lymphoma 2
  (vBCL-2) of gammaherpesviruses, which strongly sequesters Beclin1 to suppress phagophore
  nucleation. Growth and closure of the autophagosome membrane involve the conjugation
  of the autophagy marker LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine in the membrane, which is
  sequentially processed by ATG4, ATG7 and ATG3 (step 3). KSHV FLICE-like inhibitory
  protein (vFLIP) competes with LC3 for binding to ATG3 to inhibit expansion of the
  autophagosome. The fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome to form a single
  membrane-bound auto-lysosome signifies the maturation stage of the autophagy pathway
  (step 4). Consequently, the encapsulated contents, together with the inner membrane
  of the autophagosome, undergo breakdown by lysosomal hydrolases. Maturation is negatively
  regulated by the host Rubicon complex, which comprises Rubicon, UVRAG (UV irradiation
  resistance-associated protein), Beclin1 and other members of the PI3KC3 complex.
  KSHV viral inhibitor of apoptosis (vIAP) forms a complex with Rubicon and enhances
  Rubicon-mediated inhibition of autophagosome maturation.
