caption: Thrombin-activated PAR1 couples to Gαq and promotes rapid increases in Ca2+
  binding to calmodulin (Cam), which initiates MLC phosphorylation, actin-myosin contractility,
  and endothelial barrier permeability. Activated PAR1 also couples to Gα12/13 and
  activates RhoA signaling, which also enhances MLC phosphorylation and endothelial
  barrier permeability. Here, we showed that thrombin-activated PAR1 initiated a p38-MK2-MK3
  signaling pathway that occurred independently of the RhoA-MLC pathway to regulate
  the phosphorylation and activity of HSP27 to control endothelial barrier recovery.
  GPCR-induced HSP27 phosphorylation and oligomer disassembly is expected to release
  actin, promote actin polymerization, and contribute to endothelial barrier disruption,
  whereas HSP27 dephosphorylation facilitates HSP27 oligomer reassembly and endothelial
  barrier recovery. Thus, GPCRs activate multiple signaling pathways that promote
  endothelial barrier disruption and resolution.
