caption: Indirect and direct effects seen by meformin in a preoperative window study
  in obese endometrial cancer patients. Metformin treatment resulted in a systemic
  decrease in serum glucose and enhanced lipolysis coupled with inhibition of the
  mTOR pathway and increased fatty acid oxidation and glycogen synthesis in the endometrial
  tumor cells themselves. These effects were more pronounced in responders versus
  nonresponders to metformin treatment.
