caption: 'Metabolic reprogramming and the Warburg effect in melanoma. A) Metabolism
  in normal melanocyte with depiction of glycolysis, TCA cycle and OXPHOS. Glucose
  enters the cytoplasm via GLUT-1 and undergoes glycolysis to pyruvate. After entering
  the mitochondrium, the enzyme PDH converts pyruvate to Ac-CoA, which is metabolized
  and burnt in the TCA-cycle and during OXPHOS. Anaerobic glycolysis results in less
  efficient ATP generation along with lactate production during hypoxia. Lactate can
  leave the cytoplasm via MCTs. B) The Warburg effect refers to the metabolic switch
  in highly proliferating cells. Somewhat counterintuitive, these cells prefer less
  efficient ATP generating glycolysis as main metabolic pathway despite the presence
  of oxygen (i.e., aerobic glycolysis). C) Warburg effect is exploited by rapidly
  proliferating melanoma cells when nutrients are abundant. This is mediated by multiple
  mechanisms that result in increased glucose uptake, accelerated glycolytic flux
  and decreased mitochondrial respiration. Glycolytic intermediate metabolites can
  be recycled and synthesized into macromolecules for synthesis of DNA, lipids and
  cellular proteins that are needed for proliferation. Adopted from []. Abbreviations:
  Ac-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; GLUT, glucose transporter;
  HIF1α, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha; MCT, monocarboxylate transporter; PDH, pyruvate
