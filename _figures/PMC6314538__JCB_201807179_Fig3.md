caption: 'Cell cycle timing and regulation of replicative histone genes. The replicative
  variant H3.1 is deposited by CAF-1 in a DNA synthesis–coupled manner, mostly during
  replication in S phase. Expression peaks at the G1/S transition, and its transcription
  is regulated in concert with other replicative histone genes located within the
  histone clusters. Their pre-mRNAs are processed through a distinct pathway that
  involves the recognition of two unique cis-regulatory elements: a 3′ stem-loop structure
  and an HDE. Transcription and pre-mRNA processing are compartmentalized in the nucleus
  and coordinated in HLBs. HLB assembly and transcriptional activation is initiated
  by NPAT. NPAT is phosphorylated by the Cyclin E/CDK2 complex at the G1/S transition.
  The maturation of histone pre-mRNAs requires the endonucleolytic cleavage of its
  3′ tail and is mediated by several factors recruited to HLBs. The U7 snRNP binds
  the HDE via hybridization of the U7 snRNA. It interacts with SLBP, a protein that
  specifically recognizes the 3′ stem-loop structure and stabilizes the U7 snRNP association.
  FLASH is another essential coactivator that promotes the recruitment of transcription
  factors and interacts with the Lsm11 subunit of the U7 snRNP to recruit the components
  of the histone cleavage complex. These transcription factors include Symplekin and
  the CPSF73/CPSF100 heterodimer that catalyzes the 3′ end endonucleolytic cleavage.
  Mature mRNAs are cleaved downstream of the 3′ stem-loop, which is required for mRNA
  degradation. SLBP is also degraded at the end of S phase after phosphorylation by
  the Cyclin A/CDK1 complex. H3 availability is further modulated at the protein level
  by NASP, a H3-H4 histone chaperone that protects soluble histones from degradation
  via chaperone-mediated autophagy counteracting Hsc70 and Hsp90.'
