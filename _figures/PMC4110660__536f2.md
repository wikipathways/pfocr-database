caption: 'In silico network and pathway enrichment analysis. Lists of the proteins
  in the CRBN complex that upregulated (A) or downregulated (B) in response to lenolidomide
  were evaluated against the latest versions of the following databases (covering
  >50% of human proteins): CellMap, Reactome, KEGG, NCI-PID, and BioCartel. Linker
  genes were included in the network modeling and pathway enrichment predictions.
  Results were filtered for a P value < .05 and a false discovery rate < 0.05. The
  separate networks modeled from downregulation vs upregulation lists are presented
  in (A) and (B), and the association or connection between IKZF1 and CRBN was a custom
  annotation added to the figures.'
