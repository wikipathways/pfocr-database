caption: Proposed model for the evolution of nitrogenase metal specificity from an
  ancestral, alternative, and/or simplified pathway for Mo‐cofactor incorporation.
  Full description of stages (a–d) in the evolution of nitrogenase metal dependence
  is provided in the main text (Section 4.2). Possible alternative pathway for nitrogenase
  Mo‐cofactor synthesis indicated in stages (a–b). Phases (a–d) are also mapped to
  analyzed ancestors within the nitrogenase phylogeny. The presence of NifB, NifE,
  and NifN in represented taxa indicated next to each clade of the phylogeny (F‐Mc
  clade has only one species that harbors NifN)
