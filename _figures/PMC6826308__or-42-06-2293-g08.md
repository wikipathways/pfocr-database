caption: Model for the pathway of nucleolar instability following IR. Following activation
  of cell cycle checkpoint arrest after IR, irradiated cells are arrested at each
  cell cycle phase. Since the G1/S checkpoint arrest is sensitive, G1 cells are arrested
  until most DSBs are repaired, if p53 is present. G2/M checkpoint arrest is released
  when the number of DSBs in G2 cells becomes 10–20, and cells progress into the M
  phase. During mitosis, micronuclei with or without a nucleolin signal may form.
  After mitosis, G1 cells that have progressed from irradiated S/G2 cells may undergo
  p53-dependent apoptosis. Thus, surviving cells may exhibit normal transcriptional
  activity of rDNA. By contrast, as irradiated cells may not be effectively arrested
  under conditions of p53 deficiency, the formation of micronuclei is a frequent occurrence
  following mitosis. In addition, as p53-deficient G1 cells with micronuclei are not
  able to undergo apoptosis, surviving cells displaying a damaged nucleolus may exhibit
  low transcriptional activity of rDNA. IR, ionizing radiation, DSBs, double-strand
  breaks.
