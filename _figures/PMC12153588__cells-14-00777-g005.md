caption: 'Schematic of microtubule dynamics regulated by interconnected pathways coordinating
  polymerization and depolymerization. RhoA-ROCK-formin-GSK3β signaling promotes polymerization
  via end-binding proteins (EBs), which recruit TOG-domain proteins like XMAP215,
  to MT plus-ends. Destabilization is mediated by stathmin (inactivated by CDK1-cyclin
  B1, RSK2, or IL-10-NFκB-CDC2 pathways) and balanced by stabilizing MAPs like tau,
  modulated by GSK3β, CDK5, and MARKs. XMAP215-EB1 interactions and tau binding ensure
  spatiotemporal precision. While CLASPs collaborate with EBs, their link to Rho GTPases
  remains unclear. Aurora kinases, Plk1, and other regulators further integrate signals,
  highlighting a complex network balancing dynamic MT remodeling. These signaling
  pathways regulate microtubules (the green tube in Figure 5) by polymerization, depolymerization
  or destabilization. Red arrows: the sequence of signals activation; black arrows:
  the direction of microtubule dynamics'
