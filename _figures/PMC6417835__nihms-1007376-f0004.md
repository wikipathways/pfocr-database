caption: 'Roles of FA proteins in replication stress. (a) The FANCI-FANCD2-Ub complex
  stabilizes the extracentromeric CFSs and mediates loading of the Bloom complex (BLM,
  RMI1, RMI2, and TOPOIII) on these under-replicated CFSs to ensure their protection,
  repair, and unperturbed mitosis. The endogenously produced R-loops (RNA-DNA hybrids)
  at some susceptible genetic loci are remodeled by the components of the FA pathway.
  (b) At low doses of replication stress, nonubiquitinated FANCD2 binds and inhibits
  the MCM2–7 helicase complex to restrain DNA synthesis. ATR stimulates binding of
  FANCD2 to MCM 2–7 to prevent p21-mediated cellular senescence by precluding the
  accumulation of ssDNA. FANCI also binds to MCM2–7 to fire dormant origins. The dormant
  origin firing by FANCI is inhibited by its phosphorylation by ATR kinase and the
  FANCD2-BLM complex. FANCM opposes fork movement, possibly by remodeling the stalled
  replication forks. (c) High doses of replication stress elicit the classical FA
  pathway. FANCA, FANCC, FANCJ, and FANCM, together with BOD1L, bind to nascent DNA
  strands to protect them from MRE11- or DNA2-mediated unwanted nucleolytic degradation.
  RAD51-ssDNA filaments on stalled replication forks are protected by BRCA1, BRCA2,
  and FANCD2-Ub by nucleases. Abbreviations: CFS, chromosomal fragile site; FA, Fanconi
  anemia; ssDNA, single-strand DNA; UFB, ultrafine bridge.'
