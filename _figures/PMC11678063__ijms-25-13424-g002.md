caption: 'Calcium–calmodulin mediated signal transduction in normal neurons (top panel)
  and neurodegeneration (lower panel). This essential signaling pathway mediates learning
  and memory as well as the essential functions and survival of brain cells. During
  neurodegeneration, the unregulated influx of calcium ions mediated by various receptors
  and ion channels increases cytosolic calcium to toxic levels, in turn increasing
  the level of Ca2+-CaM, causing changes implicated in memory loss, nerve degeneration,
  and death. Abbreviations: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Mito, mitochondria; Lyso, lysosomes'
