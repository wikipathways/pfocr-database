caption: 'Three mechanisms are involved in the regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis:
  redox status, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis.
  (a) Redox: under stress conditions, mitochondria generate a massive amount of ROS,
  which are mainly composed of the O2−, H2O2, and •OH species. H2O2 acts as a signaling
  molecule that inhibits cytoplasmic Keap1, resulting in the transfer of Nrf2 to the
  nucleus, where it increases the transcription of antioxidant genes, such as those
  expressing SOD, GPx, and catalase, by binding to ARE in their promoters. (b) Mitochondrial
  dynamics: damaged mitochondria are split into normal mitochondria and severely damaged
  mitochondria, via a process mediated by Drp1. Normal mitochondria and other slightly
  damaged mitochondria fuse to form intact mitochondria, via a process mediated by
  mitofusins and OPA1, while severely damaged mitochondria undergo mitophagy induced
  by the aggregation of PINK1 and Parkin in the OMM following a decrease in membrane
  potential. (c) Mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis: under oxidative stress conditions,
  the injured mitochondria bind to the phagophores indirectly via the PINK1/Parkin
  pathway or directly via outer membrane protein receptors (BNIP3, BNIP3L/NIX, and
  FUNDC1), leading to the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes, thus leading
  to their removal by lysosomes. The activation of the PGC-1α/Nrf1/TFAM pathway induces
  mtDNA transcription and the production of new mitochondria. Nrf2 not only increases
  mitophagy by promoting the expression of PINK1 but also facilitates mitochondrial
  biogenesis by promoting the expression of PGC-1α and Nrf1. Therefore, Nrf2 acts
  as a link between mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis.'
