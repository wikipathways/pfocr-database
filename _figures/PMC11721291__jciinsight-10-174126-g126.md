caption: The results of this study are summarized schematically for male (A) and female
  (B) T2DN rats. The old male renal tissue showed clear signs of increased cGAS/STING
  pathway activity, with an elevation in IFN causing a significant inflammatory cell
  recruitment in comparison with their age-matched counterpart sex
