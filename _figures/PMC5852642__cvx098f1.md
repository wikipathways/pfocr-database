caption: Example of microRNAs involved in the differentiation of white, beige, and
  brown adipocytes. These microRNAs are involved in regulating adipocyte differentiation
  through effects on their targets that control expression of metabolic genes, inflammation,
  or insulin resistance. Activation of brown and/or beige adipocytes may contribute
  to favorable effects on energy expenditure, insulin resistance, and potentially
  cardiovascular remodeling. Solid lines with arrows followed by (+) indicate positive
  regulation of the indicated adipocyte differentiation pathway. Dashed lines followed
  by (+) or ( ++) indicate that the adipocyte differentiation pathway may be favorably
  implicated in regulating cardiovascular disease.
