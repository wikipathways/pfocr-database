caption: Differentially expressed genes with a p-value < 0.05 were mapped to their
  associated protein product within the public Reactome pathway. Proteins in the pathway
  were color-coded according to how many DEGs contribute protein component(s) to each.
  Intracellular organelles or locations are labeled.
