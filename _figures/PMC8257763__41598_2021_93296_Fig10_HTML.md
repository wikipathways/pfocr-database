caption: Working hypothesis representing the potential effects of high glucose on
  PRR cellular preferential distribution to the plasma membrane. In the collecting
  duct, the principal cell is the main source of prorenin in diabetes. Prorenin released
  to the lumen, binds PRR, thus leading to its activation and stimulation of MAPK/ERK1/2
  intracellular pathway which is known to induce profibrotic factors in these cells.
  Upregulation of PRR is mediated by high glucose, but not osmolality. In this scenario,
  it is likely that GLUT-1 and GLUT-12 transporters contribute to the HG-dependent
  PRR trafficking through mechanisms including glycolysis and metabolic intermediaries
  such as succinate and alpha-ketoglutarate through their receptors.
