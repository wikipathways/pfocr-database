caption: 'Fusion hallmarks: trends in cellular pathways fusions by fusion event cluster.
  REACTOME gene pathway annotation was mapped onto parent proteins in fusion events
  and enrichment was assessed using randomization analyses. Nodes indicate pathways,
  and edges indicate the occurrence of a fusion between them (i.e., between two genes
  which participate in the pathways). Edge widths denote the number of unique fusion
  events associated with a specific pathway fusion, and edge colors represent enrichments,
  whereby enrichments are calculated as the log10 fold change between observed fusion
  frequencies and expected frequencies derived by randomly pairing any two human protein-coding
  genes 1 000 000 times (see Online Methods). Using only parent proteins as the sampling
  set for generating background frequencies results in highly similar results (see
  Figure S2). Only pathways that were fused in 10 or more different fusion events
  are shown.'
