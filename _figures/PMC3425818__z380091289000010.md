caption: Role of stathmin in thrombin-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction and
  acute lung injury. Thrombin stimulation decreases the pool of phosphorylated stathmin,
  which leads to stathmin-dependent microtubule disassembly, activation of microtubule-released
  Rho-specific GEF-H1, and stimulation of Rho-dependent pathway of endothelial permeability.
  This pathway involves Rho-kinase mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of myosin
  phosphatase MYPT1, accumulation of phosphorylated MLC, actomyosin contraction, cytoskeletal
  remodeling, and endothelial barrier disruption. Activated Rho-kinase also phosphorylates
  tau at S262 and S409, leading to tau dissociation from microtubules and microtubule
  destabilization. This mechanism triggers a positive feedback loop of microtubule-dependent
  Rho activation. Stabilization of microtubules, reduction of Rho signaling, and attenuation
  of pulmonary endothelial permeability and acute lung injury may be achieved by stathmin
  knockdown or stathmin inactivation via cAMP-induced phosphorylation on S16 and S63.
