caption: 'Anticancer effects of SBAs in gastric cancer (GC). TCDCA: suppresses gastric
  cancer proliferation and invasion while inducing apoptosis. DCA: triggers apoptosis
  via the intrinsic mitochondrial-dependent, p53-mediated cell death pathway, characterized
  by an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential.
  Induces MUC2 expression, which inhibits tumor progression. UDCA: promotes apoptosis
  and autophagy, overcoming drug resistance. Both UDCA and DCA exhibit suppressive
  effects on gastric cancer cells by activating ERK signaling pathways. Inhibits invasion
  by suppressing chenodeoxycholic acid-induced PGE2 production and promotes apoptosis
  by activating death receptor 5 (DR5) within lipid rafts'
