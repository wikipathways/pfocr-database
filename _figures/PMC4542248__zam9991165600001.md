caption: Schematic representation of the ergosterol and HA biosynthetic pathways.
  Chemical structures of HA and the intermediates have been included. The tri4 and
  tri5 genes, belonging to the trichothecene pathway, which were expressed in the
  T. harzianum strain to produce EPT, are labeled with circles. Genes and enzymes
  are indicated in italic and capital letters, respectively.
