caption: In the AKI model, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is transiently activated,
  and activated β-catenin can protect the kidney from apoptosis by inhibiting p53
  expression or inhibiting p53 activity. In the CKD model, p53 can increase the expression
  of Wnt ligands through transcriptional regulation, thereby inducing the continuous
  activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which leads to the dissociation
  of the destruction complex composed of axin, CK1, Dvl, APC, and GSK3β, and finally
  leads to the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. The accumulated β-catenin
  enters the nucleus and promotes renal fibrosis by regulating the transcription of
  target genes. In addition, the accumulation of β-catenin may also increase the expression
  of p53, thereby inducing apoptosis and aggravating kidney damage in the process
  of CKD.AKI, acute kidney injury; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; CBP, cyclic adenosine
