caption: mTORC1 consists of mTOR, regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor),
  Akt/PKB substrate 40 kDa (PRAS40), mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8 (mLST8),
  Tti1/Tel2 complex and DEP domain containing mTOR-interacting protein (Deptor). In
  response to growth factors, activation of the classical PI3K-Akt pathway leads to
  the phosphorylation and inhibition of TSC2. Subsequent activation of Rheb-GTP increases
  mTORC1 activity toward its various substrates, including 4E-BP, ULK1, Lipin1, S6K,
  and Grb10. Akt activation also promotes mTORC1 activity by inhibiting PRAS40, a
  negative regulator of mTORC1. Phosphorylation of Grb10 by mTORC1 switches its binding
  affinity from the insulin receptor to Raptor, thereby destabilizing mTORC1 through
  a novel negative feedback mechanism. Similarly, S6K can negatively feedback on the
  insulin signaling pathway by inducing the degradation of IRS. Amino acids activate
  mTORC1 signaling through GTP-loaded RAS-related GTP-binding Protein (RAG) A or B
  and GDP-loaded RAG C or D complexes. In addition, AMPK suppresses mTORC1 signaling
  by activating TSC and inhibiting Raptor. WNT signaling stimulates mTORC1 by inhibiting
  GSK3β-mediated TSC2 activation. Promotion of Hippo signaling triggers a kinase cascade
  that phosphorylates and inhibits Yes-associated protein (YAP) by large tumor suppressor
  (LATS) kinases. Meanwhile, YAP is able to regulate expression of microRNA miR-29
  which can activate mTOR signaling through PTEN suppression. Notch signaling also
  regulates mTOR activity in liver.
