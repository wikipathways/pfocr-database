caption: 'S-allylcysteine (SAC) prevents the progression of Alzheimer''s disease (AD)
  by multiple mechanisms: (1) antioxidant, SAC scavenges free radicals and oxidant
  specie (direct antioxidant) and restores glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase,
  and superoxide dismutase levels (indirect antioxidant). Consequently, SAC diminishes
  lipid peroxidation, DNA fragmentation, protein oxidation, and endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress. The decrease in endoplasmic reticulum stress attenuates Ca2+ release
  and the subsequent activation of calpain and the caspase-12-dependent pathway, which
  altogether decrease the cell death; (2) antiamyloidogenic, SAC decreases Aβ formation
  and/or increases Aβ clearance. SAC lowers amyloid precursor protein (APP) mRNA expression,
  BACE (β-site APP cleavage enzyme 1) expression and activity and restores PKC activity
  under AD-like condition, which benefits APP cleavage and decreases the available
  APP for Aβ. In addition, SAC can bind to Aβ-inhibiting Aβ fibrillation and destabilizing
  preformed Aβ-peptide fibrils; (3) anti-inflammatory, SAC decreases IL-1β and TNF-α
  levels and IL-1β-positive plaque-associated microglia; (4) antitangle, SAC reduces
  tau2 reactivity and its phosphorylation; this reduction in tau appears to involve
  GSK-3β protein; (5) anti-glycative; SAC declines both activity and mRNA expression
  of aldose reductase (AR), which subsequently decreases the production of sorbitol
  and prevents advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formation, such as carboxymethyllysine
  (CML) and pentosidine, decreasing glycative stress.'
