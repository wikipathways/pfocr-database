caption: 'Complement during infection with a pathogen. The permanent activity of the
  alternative pathway allows it to immediately identify pathogens that are not specifically
  protected against complement. Danger-associated molecular patterns on its surface
  of pathogens are recognized by C1q, MBL, and ficolins allowing classical and lectin
  pathway activation, C3 convertase, C4b2a generation, and C3 cleavage. Opsonization
  due to covalent binding of C3b to the target is accelerated by the amplification
  loop of the complement pathways. The effector functions resulting from this complement
  activation are: pathogen lysis by C5b-9 membrane attack complex, opsonization and
  phagocytosis of the pathogen, activation of host immune and non-immune cells by
  complement anaphylatoxins, inflammation, stimulation of an adaptive immune response,
  and antibody generation. Secreted antibodies will bind to the pathogen and create
  immune complexes that will be recognized by C1q and will activate the classical
  pathway. Altogether these mechanisms contribute to pathogen elimination.'
