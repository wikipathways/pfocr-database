caption: PI3K pathway components showing the level at which the inhibitory compounds
  used in this study have their activity. Optimal induction of cell death requires
  inhibition of both PI3K/Akt and of mTORC1 signalling. This can be achieved by dual
  inhibitors PI103 and BEZ235 or by combining PIK90 or AKTi1/2 with rapamycin.
