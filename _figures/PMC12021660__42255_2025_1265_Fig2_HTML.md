caption: The relative expression (Yki versus Ctrl, average log2-transformed fold change)
  at days 5 (5D) and 8 (8D) of genes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glycogenesis,
  and fatty acid (FA) synthesis. Shared enzymes of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis
  are shown in grey; upregulation is indicated by green, downregulation is indicated
  by magenta, and no significant change is indicated in grey (NoC). See also Extended
