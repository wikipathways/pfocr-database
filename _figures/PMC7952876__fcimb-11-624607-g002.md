caption: The lactate shuttle hypothesis illustrates a metabolic relationship between
  hypoxic and normoxic tumor cells. As glucose and oxygen diffuse out of tumor vascular
  supply, a gradient develops, with normoxic regions developing closer to the periphery
  and hypoxic regions developing within the lesion core. Hypoxic cells import glucose
  and rely on the glycolytic metabolic pathway to generate pyruvate. Pyruvate is converted
  to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), and then exported in large quantities
  by monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4). This lactate is imported by normoxic cells
  via monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1). These normoxic cells preserve glucose
  that is needed for hypoxic cell metabolism and instead convert lactate back into
  pyruvate via lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB). This lactate-derived pyruvate can then
  be used as fuel for the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial
  respiration. Image produced using BioRender.com.
