caption: P-Rex family Rac GEFs in insulin signaling. Insulin activates the insulin
  receptor (IR), leading to receptor conformational changes which promote transphosphorylation
  and subsequent activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Insulin receptor
  substrate-1 (IRS1) is phosphorylated and recruits PI3K to the plasma membrane. Class
  1 PI3Ks phosphorylate PtdIns(4,5)P2 to generate PIP3 []. PIP3 promotes the translocation
  of PDK1 and Akt to the membrane through interaction with the PH domains, and phosphorylation
  of Akt by PDK1 and mTORC2 (PDK2) leads to the full activation of Akt. P-Rex1 and
  P-Rex2 are direct binding partners of mTORC1 and mTORC2 [], both of which are important
  effectors of the insulin-signaling pathway. Both P-Rex proteins activate Rac1, and
  P-Rex1 has been implicated in the insulin-dependent translocation of GLUT4 to the
  plasma membrane in adipocytes []. P-Rex2 has been identified to inhibit PTEN through
  a mechanism independent of the GEF activity, and thus regulates the PIP3 signal
  [,]. Inversely, PTEN also inhibits P-Rex2 []. Figure made with BioRender.
