caption: 'PPARy‐mediated effects in the liver. PPARγ serves distinct functions in
  the various cell types of the liver. In hepatocytes, PPARy has a steatogenic role,
  mediating expression of adipogenic genes such as Ap2 and CD36 inducing increased
  FFA uptake. The simultaneous induction of FAS and ACC1 promotes intracellular TG
  accumulation. In liver macrophages, both Kupffer cells and infiltrating monocytes,
  PPARγ promotes the alternatively activated (M2) macrophage phenotype, while inhibiting
  activation of the classically activated (M1) macrophage. This decreases the release
  of inflammatory cytokines (EG TNFα and MCP1) and growth factors (TGFβ), resulting
  in reduced inflammation, and hepatic stellate cell activation in turn attenuating
  fibrosis. Finally, PPARy is associated with the quiescent phenotype of HSC limiting
  activation of HSC and subsequently fibrosis. ACC1, Acetyl‐CoA Carboxylase 1; Ap2,
