caption: 'Comparison of the roles of VEGF and Delta-Notch pathways in angiogenesis
  and vascular development. Vascular endothelial growth factor from hypoxic tumour
  cells and surrounding tissue provides a signal to endothelial cells (via cell-restricted
  VEGF receptors) that calls for an increase in vascular function. The Delta-Notch
  pathway (particularly Dll4) acts within the vasculature to help the endothelial
  cells respond appropriately to the activating VEGF signal. At least two settings
  in the developing vasculature apparently utilise VEGF as a driving signal and Delta-Notch
  to make cell fate decisions: the specialisation of tip cells and stalk cells within
  the growing front of angiogenic vessels and the specification of arterial cell fate.'
