caption: (a) Interaction of the pathogenicity factors p25 from beet necrotic yellow
  vein virus (BNYVV) and replicase (Rep) from tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) with the
  Aux/IAA proteins BvIAA28 from sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) and AtIAA26/27 from Arabidopsis thaliana.
  This interaction inhibits the nuclear localization of Aux/IAAs and suppresses their
  regulatory properties, leading to the release of the auxin response factors (ARFs),
  which can then take up their roles as transcription factors again. (b) Interaction
  of rice dwarf virus (RDV) with the auxin signalling pathway of rice (Oryza sativa).
  OsIAA10 is stabilized by the viral protein P2 in a dose‐dependent manner. An interaction
  of the SCFTIR1/AFBs complex with domain II of OsIAA10 is prevented by P2 even under
  high auxin concentrations. OsARF12 and 16 are still suppressed by OsIAA10 and genes
  involved in early synthesis of indole acetic acid (IAA) as well as auxin‐responsive
  genes are down‐regulated during infection. (c) Interaction of the rice‐infecting
  viruses southern rice black streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV, SP8), rice black streaked
  dwarf virus (RBSDV, P8), rice stripe virus (RSV, P2), and rice stripe mosaic virus
  (RSMV, M protein) with ARFs. SP8 from SRBSDV and P8 from RBSDV were found to specifically
  interact with the C‐terminal dimerization domain (CTD) of OsARF17, preventing its
  dimerization. The RSV protein P2 was found to interact with the DNA‐binding domain
  (DBD) of OsARF17, which impedes the interaction with AuxREs, and the M protein from
  RSMV interacts with the MR‐CTD of OsARF17. All these interactions lead to suppression
  of transcriptional activity of OsARF17
