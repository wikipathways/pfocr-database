caption: Proteasome inhibitor and IMiD mechanisms of action relating to solute carrier
  transporters. xCT (and CD98hc) imports extracellular cystine in exchange for glutamate.
  Cystine is converted to cysteine which feeds into the glutathione synthesis pathway.
  Glutathione is an antioxidant which lowers reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels,
  increasing cell survival. Inhibition of xCT reduces intracellular glutathione and
  increases the efficacy of PIs. MCT proteins, for example, MCT1 which forms a complex
  with CD147, export the large quantities of lactate produced by cancer cells to avoid
  apoptosis due to the acidosis caused by elevated lactate levels. IMiDs competitively
  bind MCT1/CD147, preventing CRBN from binding and stabilizing the complex. The LAT1/CD98hc
  complex imports various large neutral amino acids, increasing angiogenesis as well
  as the proliferation and migration of cancer cells. IMiDs bind CRBN (which is responsible
  for quality control of LAT1/CD98hc), causing destabilization of the complex.
