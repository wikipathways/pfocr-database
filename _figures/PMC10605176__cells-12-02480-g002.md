caption: Schematic overview of neuroprotection by the gaseous molecules H2S and CO.
  (a) H2S suppresses apoptosis of neuronal cells by reducing the expression of the
  pro-apoptotic Bax protein and increasing the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein
  BCL-2. Regulation of the p38/Erk1/2 signaling pathway and the heat-shock response
  are key elements in facilitating the neuroprotective effect of H2S. Furthermore,
  H2S decreases the expression of apoptotic and pro-inflammatory markers, such as
  caspase-3, ICAM-1, VEGF, and iNOS. (b) CO reduces neuroinflammation by downregulation
  of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CO also differentially regulates
  the activation of MAP kinases ERK1/2 and p38, resulting in anti-apoptotic signaling.
  Moreover, CO promotes neuronal cell survival and modulates the heat-shock response.
