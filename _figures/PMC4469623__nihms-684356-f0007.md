caption: A model of a conserved MST1/2-YAP axis in regulating lung development A model
  of MST and YAP interactions in the lung. Control of YAP/TAZ activity by MST1/2 regulates
  many aspects of cellular behavior during lung development. YAP plays a more dominant
  role than TAZ in Hippo signaling. In this model, loss of MST1/2 shifts YAP toward
  the non-phosphorylated state, which is no longer sequestered in the cytoplasm and
  also free from degradation. Instead, non-phosphorylated YAP is enriched in the nucleus
  to activate YAP targets, leading to cell proliferation and fate determination and
  other changes in cellular properties. This canonical relationship between MST and
  YAP is observed in many tissues. The mediator of Hippo signaling between MST1/2
  and YAP in the lung could be LATS (another conserved feature of the Hippo pathway)
  or some other unknown kinases. Factors that activate MST1/2 have been inferred from
  cell-based studies but signals that control MST activity in the lung remain unclear.

  description: A model of a conserved MST1/2-YAP axis in regulating lung development
    A model of MST and YAP interactions in the lung. Control of YAP/TAZ activity by
    MST1/2 regulates many aspects of cellular behavior during lung development. YAP
    plays a more dominant role than TAZ in Hippo signaling. In this model, loss of
    MST1/2 shifts YAP toward the non-phosphorylated state, which is no longer sequestered
    in the cytoplasm and also free from degradation. Instead, non-phosphorylated YAP
    is enriched in the nucleus to activate YAP targets, leading to cell proliferation
    and fate determination and other changes in cellular properties. This canonical
    relationship between MST and YAP is observed in many tissues. The mediator of
    Hippo signaling between MST1/2 and YAP in the lung could be LATS (another conserved
    feature of the Hippo pathway) or some other unknown kinases. Factors that activate
    MST1/2 have been inferred from cell-based studies but signals that control MST
    activity in the lung remain unclear.
