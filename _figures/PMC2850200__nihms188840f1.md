caption: Pathway by which the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids down regulates
  bile acid biosynthesis. Bile acids traversing the ileal enterocyte activate FXR,
  the nuclear receptor for bile acids (shown as a heterodimer with RXR, the retinoid
  X receptor). FXR activation promotes the synthesis of a protein, fibroblast growth
  factor – 19 (FGF19), which exits the ileal enterocyte by an unknown mechanism, and
  travels to the liver in portal venous blood. FGF19 interacts with a FGFR4/βklotho
  receptor complex present on the sinsudoidal membrane of the hepatocyte. The activated
  receptor initiates a phosphorylation cascade that culminates in the transcriptional
  repression of the gene encoding cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the rate limiting enzyme
  in bile acid biosynthesis.
