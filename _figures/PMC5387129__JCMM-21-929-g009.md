caption: 'Schematic picture of the oxLDL regulation of MCP‐1 release, and the mechanism
  of the regulatory effect of oxLDL antibody. oxLDL‐induced MCP‐1 release from monocytes/macrophages
  is regulated by Ca2+ and K+ channels, and both of them are TLR‐4‐ and MAPK‐dependent.
  The oxLDL antibody inhibited oxLDL‐induced Kir channel closure and inhibited the
  oxLDL‐induced ERK activation through binding to FcγRIIB. Four kinds of Fcγ receptors
  have been identified: FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB and FcγRIII. FcγRI/III transduces
  activation signals through its immunoreceptor tyrosine‐based activation motif (ITAM)
  in cell membranes. Once activated, ITAM recruits spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and
  its downstream targets, such as phospholipase C (PLCγ), GTPase (Rho, Rac) and phosphatidylinositol
  3‐kinase (PI3K), to activate macrophages. FcγRIIB transduces inhibitory signals
  through immunoreceptor tyrosine‐based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which recruits SH2
  domain‐containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP), and specifically hydrolyses the PI3K
  product PIP3 to PIP2. We hypothesize that the oxLDL monoclonal antibody (BI‐204)
  inhibits oxLDL‐induced macrophage activation through its FcγRIIB by activation of
  MAPK phosphatase (MKP), which might specifically inactivate the ERK MAPK pathway.'
