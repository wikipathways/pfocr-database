caption: At low calcium levels, apo-CaM and the ATPase domain of Hsc70 independently
  bind AtBAG5. The AtBAG5/Hsc70 complex promotes ROS production and SAG transcription,
  leading to accelerated leaf senescence. At high calcium levels, holo-CaM alters
  its binding mode to AtBAG5, which disrupts Hsc70 binding. The release of Hsc70 inhibits
  the amplification of ROS and further inhibits the senescence pathway.
