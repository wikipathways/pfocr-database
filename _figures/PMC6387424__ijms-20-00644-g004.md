caption: Triacylglycerols are synthesized from acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-coA is metabolized
  to malonyl-CoA via acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which in turn is converted to Palmitate,
  the principal product of the fatty acid synthase system in animal cells. Palmitate
  is lengthened to form stearate by enzyme fatty acid elongase. Stearate, a saturated
  fatty acid is subsequently metabolized by stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme, that forms
  a double bond in stearoyl-CoA, leading to the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid.
  Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), the enzyme in the outer mitochondrial membrane,
  converts long-chain acyl-CoA species to their corresponding long-chain acyl-carnitines
  for transport into the mitochondria. CPT induces mitochondrial β-oxidation, which
  is a complex pathway involving energy metabolism. FASN inhibits CPT with resultant
  inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. T-bar in red denotes inhibition.
