caption: The elucidated pathway of starch biosynthesis in maize. The model summarizes
  the elucidated key enzymes involved in starch synthesis. Basically, ADP‐glucose
  as the glucosyl donor for starch biosynthesis is activated by ADP‐glucose pyrophosphorylase
  (AGPase), which is composed of two large subunits (AGP LSU) and two small subunits
  (AGP SSU). In amyloplast, the amylose is synthesized by granule‐bound starch synthase
  (GBSS), while amylopectin biosynthesis requires three more coordinated enzymes of
  soluble starch synthase (SS), starch‐branching enzyme (BE) and starch‐debranching
  enzyme (DBE).
