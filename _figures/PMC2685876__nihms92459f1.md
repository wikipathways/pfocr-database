caption: 'Carbon flow from [U-13C]-glucose through glycolysis, Krebs cycle, PPP, pyruvate
  carboxylation, malate/Asp shuttle, and synthesis of GSH and pyrimidine nucleotides.
  Solid oval represents the plasma membrane and the dashed oval represents the mitochondrial
  space. Double-headed arrows: exchange or reversible processes.Glc = glucose, G6P
  = glucose-6-phosphate, Rib = nucleotide ribose, DHAP, GAP = dihydroxyacetone phosphate
  and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, PEP = phosphoenolpyruvate, Pyr=pyruvate, Lac = lactate,
  Cit=citrate, 2=OG = 2-oxoglutarate, Mal=malate, OAA = oxalacetate, U = uracil base.Critical
  enzymes are shown in cyan. HK= hexokinase (entry to glycolysis), G6PDH = glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (entry to the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway),
  TK, TA transketolase and transaldolase (non –oxidative pentose phosphate pathway),
  PK = pyruvate kinase, PDH = pyruvate dehydrogenase, PC = pyruvate carboxylase, AAT
  = aspartate amino transferase, MDH= malate dehydrogenase, ME = malic enzyme. Glutaminolysis
  is the pathway from Gln to pyruvate via ME, leading to unlabeled malate, Asp, Ala
  and lactate.'
