caption: 'Characterization of central metabolic model in developing L. glauca fruits
  for the regulation of carbon partitioning and energy supply for oil synthesis. The
  identified metabolic routes of carbon flux allocation and energy provision for FA
  synthesis are based on the transcriptome data from Illumina and 454 sequencing,
  and temporal transcript pattern analysis by qRT-PCR. Purple arrows indicate carbon
  flux drains into oil synthesis, brown arrows represent the transports of metabolite
  and energy across intracellular membrane by specific transporters, and green curved
  arrows represent all reactions for generation and consumption of energy in FA biosynthetic
  pathway, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP), glycolysis, and tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle. All transporters and enzymes involved in carbon flux allocation
  and energy provision for FA synthesis are shown in red. Abbreviations for the enzymes,
  metabolites, and transporters are as follows: AAC ATP/ADP carrier, ACC acetyl-CoA
