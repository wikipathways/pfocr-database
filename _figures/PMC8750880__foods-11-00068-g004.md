caption: 'Scheme of a metabolic pathway based on the heatmap generated from GC-MS
  data from Meju samples reveals metabolic changes during fermentation for 0–24 h
  among samples using different starters. Metabolite compounds described as color
  of compound name: Blue, higher levels in Group B inoculated only A. oryzae than
  in Group C individually inoculated with A. oryzae and B. velezensis; Red, higher
  levels in Group C than in Group D co-inoculated simultaneously with A. oryzae and
  B. velezensis; Black, higher levels in Group D than in Group C.'
