caption: E2 rapidly initiates signaling through membrane associated ERα that complexes
  with and signals through metabotropic glutamate receptor 1a (mGluR1a). This activates
  a PKC pathway that stimulates the release of neuropeptide Y (NPY), which binds to
  the NPY-Y1 receptor (Y1R) on β-END neurons that project to the medial preoptic nucleus
  (MPN). NPY increases β-END transmission to inhibit lordosis through MOR activation.
  Simultaneously, E2 acts on membrane associated ERα and STX responsive Gq-mER signaling
  through PLC/PKC/PKA and PI3K/nNOS/NO pathways to decouple the opioid receptor-like
  receptor-1 (ORL-1). This reduces inhibitory K+ currents and increase β-END transmission
  to the MPN MOR to inhibiting lordosis. Later actions of E2 that rapidly facilitate
  lordosis activate of G protein-coupled ER (GPER) located in orphanin FQ (OFQ/N)
  neurons. OFQ/N binds to its receptor, ORL-1, on MPN projecting β-END neurons. Activation
  of ORL-1 increases potassium (K+) currents through G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying
  potassium (GIRK) channels that inhibit β-END transmission, allowing lordosis to
  proceed. Modified from [, , ].
