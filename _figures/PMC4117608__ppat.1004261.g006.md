caption: The figure illustrates a network predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  that is centered by viral infection and associated with molecules involved in host
  energy metabolism and immunity. Solid and dashed connecting lines indicate the presence
  of direct and indirect interactions, respectively. Nodes indicate input of genes
  into the pathway analysis and the different symbols indicate gene functions (Legend
  in bottom left). The intensity of the node color-(red) indicates the degree of up-regulation
  while the intensity of the node color-(green) indicates the degree of down-regulation.
  The numbers shown in each node indicates the fold change in response to IAPV infection.
