caption: Mutations in the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway and related second messenger
  systems. The ERK/MAPK signaling pathway and related second messenger systems play
  a central role in neuronal and synaptic plasticity, affect regulation, and response
  to chronic stress. Mutations in genes related to these pathways could lead to reduced
  resilience and increased vulnerability. In a family with bipolar disorder and co-morbid
  anxiety spectrum disorders, we have identified potentially damaging mutations in
  genes related to these pathways. The genes encode proteins that are key regulators
  at several levels, from the cell membrane to the nucleus. IQUB and GOLGB1 are involved
  in G-protein coupled receptor recycling. FGGY, VRK2, GADD45A, and PLSCR proteins
  influence signal transduction through the ERK/MAPK messenger cascade. MESDC2 and
  JMJD1C influence CREB-regulated gene expression in the nucleus. Direct physical
  interaction has been reported between GADD45A and JMJD1C. These second messenger
  systems are also the target of lithium and valproic acid, which are commonly used
  to treat bipolar disorder. Green arrows indicate activating influences and red arrows
  indicate inhibiting influences.
