caption: 'Proposed model for the actions of dietary hydrolysable tannins (HTs) on
  skatole synthesis and degradation. Panel (A): Skatole is produced via the fermentation
  of L-tryptophan (Trp) by the gut microbiota []. The last step of the pathway is
  performed by the decarboxylases of several Clostridiales (Clostridium scatologenes,
  Clostridium nauseum) and several Lactobacillales (Lactobillus helveticus, Lactobillus
  sp 11201), among others []. Tryptophan originates from the naturally occurring cell
  debris of apoptotic cells, and its amount is increased by the inflammatory response
  in the gut []. Skatole is then transferred from the gut to the plasma where it can
  be either incorporated into adipose tissues or degraded in the liver and subsequently
  excreted by the kidney. Panel (B): Dietary HTs and/or their metabolites positively
  enhance the proportion of the Oscillospira species in the gut. Oscillospira-mediated
  butyrate inhibits the inflammatory response in the gut, thus leading to less cell
  debris and tryptophan available for S production. In addition, dietary HTs reduce
  the proportion of Streptococci and Proteobacteria in the gut, thus limiting the
  Streptococci and Proteobacteria-born inflammatory response. Moreover, dietary HTs
  decrease the amounts of Lactobacillaceae, which are involved in S production from
  tryptophan.'
