caption: Autophagy is initiated by the formation of a double-membrane structure known
  as the phagophore, which sequesters cytoplasmic components for degradation. This
  process requires the ULK1 complex, which is regulated by the mTOR pathway. Under
  nutrient-rich conditions, active mTOR suppresses autophagy by inhibiting the ULK1
  complex. However, during stress or nutrient deprivation, mTOR inhibition activates
  the ULK1 complex, triggering autophagy. The phagophore then expands and captures
  cytoplasmic components, forming an autophagosome. Autophagosome fuses with lysosomes
  to form autolysosomes, where degradation occurs. Autophagy is coordinated by various
  proteins, including the ATG family, Beclin-1, and LC3, which facilitate phagophore
  formation, elongation, and autophagosome maturation
