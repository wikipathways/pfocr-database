caption: 'Osteopontin (OPN)-induced β1-integrin activation and HIV-1 envelope signaling
  converge on mTORC1/2 pathways in a mechanism that promotes neurite outgrowth. HIV
  X4-tropic envelope protein is a well-known neurotoxin. A novel phenotype of increased
  neurite growth was observed in primary rat cortical neurons exposed to increasing
  doses of osteopontin in the presence or absence of HIV X4-tropic envelope. Osteopontin
  promoted neurite growth as assessed by increases in b3-tubulin and MAP2 staining.
  Increases in osteopontin-mediated b3-tubulin expression were inhibited by rapamycin,
  a well-known inhibitor of mTORC1, thus implicating this pathway in the mechanism
  of action. The signaling cascade can be initiated through β1-integrin receptors,
  as functional antibody blocking studies abrogate the effect of osteopontin. A modest
  level of activation of downstream mTORC1 substrate p70 S6 kinase was found suggesting
  activation of mTORC1. However, in the presence of HIV IIIB envelope and osteopontin,
  SGK1 and Akt, both established targets of mTORC2 signaling, are activated. Interestingly,
  the activation of SGK1 in neurons cotreated with HIV IIIB envelope and higher levels
  (50–100 pM) of osteopontin are insensitive to rapamycin inhibition confirming the
  activation of mTORC2. In contrast, low levels of osteopontin (6–12.5 pM) induce
  SGK activation in a manner that depends on mTORC1 signaling. Collectively, our data
  suggest that there is a feedback loop operating between mTORC1 and mTORC2, the outcome
  of which is increases in neurite growth. The mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways as well
  as signaling via β1-integrin receptors have been implicated in the regulation of
  actin cytoskeletal dynamics, learning and memory, axon guidance, and synaptic plasticity.
