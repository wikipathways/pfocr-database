caption: Proposed model showing how CD11b mediates P + M-induced LC/NE neurodegeneration.
  P + M exposure in mice elevates CD11b expression in the LC. Genetic deletion of
  CD11b attenuates P + M-induced LC/NE neurodegeneration, indicating a CD11b-dependent
  pathway. Our results show that CD11b mediates NLRP3 inflammasome activation in P
  + M-treated mice. Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome by glybenclamide suppresses P
  + M-induced microglial proinflammatory activation and NADPH oxidase activation as
  well as ROS production, which are associated with LC/NE neuroprotection
