caption: 'From genetics to pharmacological treatment.Notes: Bone morphogenetic protein
  receptor II, BMPR-II; BMP-responsive element, BRE; Caveolin-1, CAV1; 12-kDa FK506-binding
  protein, FKBP12. BMP-II signaling in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells may be
  mediated by the ligands BMP9 and BMP10 through the ALK1/BMPR2 receptor complex.
  Endoglin may serve as an accessory receptor. Pathway may be mediated via phosphorylation
  of the receptor Smads (Smad1, 5 and 8), which in turn may interact with Smad4 and
  translocate to the nucleus, modulating genes that contain BREs. CAV1 may promote
  receptor colocalization, while KCNK3 encodes a potassium channel that may enhance
  pulmonary vascular tone. Genes that are mutated in HPAH are in bold. Potential therapeutic
  strategies targeted to these signaling pathways may include: administration of BMP9
  ligand, enhancing availability of functional BMPR2 receptors (hydroxychloroquine,
  etanercept), enhancing readthrough of nonsense mutations to restore functional BMPR2
  or Smad8 protein (ataluren), promoting downstream signaling by relieving FKBP12
  inhibition of BMP type 1 receptors (FK506), enhancing CAV1-mediated receptor recruitment
  (elafin), or recovering KCNK3 potassium-channel current (ONO-RS-082). Adapted with
