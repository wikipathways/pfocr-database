caption: Schematic representation of perturbed TGF-β/Smad and mitogen-activated protein
  kinase signalling pathways in Dupuytren's fibroblasts. The TGF-β/Smad canonical
  Smad2/3 pathway and the noncanonical ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase
  signalling pathways are depicted, as well as the PDGF-induced Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2/MAP
  kinase pathway. TGF-β induces the production of PDGF and other growth factors. The
  symbols of corresponding downstream regulated genes are shown in italics. Inhibition
  by STI571, SB-431542 and PD98059 of the aberrantly overactivated signalling pathways
  in Dupuytren's fibroblasts is indicated. The mechanism by which BMP6 inhibits TGF-β
  expression and downstream responses is unclear. SB-431542 inhibits not only TGF-β/activin
  receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) signalling but also activin/ALK4 and nodal/ALK7 signalling.
  Our experiments do not rule out a role for these signalling pathways in Dupuytren's
  fibroblasts. Our data suggest that the TGF-β/Smad and PDGF/ERK MAP kinase pathways
  are targets for therapeutic intervention strategies to treat DD.
