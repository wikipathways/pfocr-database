caption: 'Retrograde signalling and cellular adaptations. (A). In yeast, Rtg dependent
  signalling is the first found major pathway through which mitochondria communicates
  with nucleus. Rtg1p and Rtg3p are basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLH/LeuZip)
  transcription factors and nuclear translocation of Rtg1/3p is dependent on partial
  dephosphorylation of Rtg3p. Rtg2 promotes the dephosphorylation of Rtg3p and its
  nuclear translocation []. Osmotic stress activates Hog1 SAPK. Hog1 SAPK binds to
  the Rtg1/3p transcription factor and allows its translocation to the nucleus [].
  (B). Mitochondrial dysfunction, such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion or OXPHOS
  inhibition, triggers mitochondrial retrograde signalling in mammalian cells. For
  example, mitochondrial stress can activate a Ca2+-dependent retrograde signalling
  that is comprised of two branches: one mediated by calcineurin for the nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB or CREB or NFAT and the other directly dependent on activation of Ca2+-dependent
  protein kinases, such as PKC, JNK, MAPK and CAMKIV. Horizontal transfer of healthy
  mitochondria from stromal cells in the TME can restore mitochondrial functions and
  is suggested to participate in the retrograde signalling. Emerging evidences show
  that ROS stimulates horizontal transfer of mitochondria [,].'
