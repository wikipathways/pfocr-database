caption: Model highlighting the identified dual role of GPS2 during human adipocyte
  differentiation. In the early stage of adipogenesis, loss of GPS2 triggers the commitment
  of fibroblast-like progenitors toward the adipogenic lineage by the responses to
  the adipogenic cocktail and the expression of inflammatory and metabolic genes.
  In the late stage of adipogenesis, the loss of GPS2 results in adipocyte hypertrophy
  with increased triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Consistent with this phenotype, the
  loss of GPS2 increases transcription and activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) that
  acts on circulating lipoproteins to promote intracellular TG accumulation. Additionally,
  the loss of GPS2 increases ABCG1 expression that contributes to the depletion of
  intracellular sphingomyelin (SM) via increased efflux from adipocytes, further contributing
  to adipocyte hypertrophy.
