caption: 'Schematic representation of metabolic changes in significantly affected
  pathways in osteoblasts at different time points after ACLT. Dotted arrows indicate
  multi-step reactions, whereas solid arrows represent single-step reactions. Changes
  in metabolite concentrations are color coded: red indicates an increase, blue indicates
  a decrease, and gray indicates no significant change. The schematic highlights key
  pathways, including glutathione metabolism; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism;
  glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; and
  phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, illustrating the complex metabolic
  network affected by ACL injury and OA progression'
