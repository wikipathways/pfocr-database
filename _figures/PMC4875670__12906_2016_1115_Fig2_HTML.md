caption: Network of gene interaction NF-KB pathway obtained from the subtraction of
  the control Hep-2 cells. Ingenuity Systems© software reveals a network of gene interactions
  associated with cancer, squamous cell tumor, benign tumor, apoptosis, proliferation,
  aggregation, morphology, viability, development and cell signaling, cell cycle control,
  cell membrane fusion, cleavage RNA fragment, protein transport, angiogenesis, activation
  of the complement system, innate immune response, release and activation of the
  calcium ion, inflammatory, antimicrobial response, inherited disorders, organ hypoplasia,
  oral cancer and laryngeal cancer process
