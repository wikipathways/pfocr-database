caption: Schematic diagram of effector intercrossing network under physiological condition.
  Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c is involved in multiple gene
  regulation, including insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2, pancreatic and duodenal
  homeobox (Pdx-1), granuphilin, uncoupling protein (UCP) 2, and ion channels. Pituitary
  adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and silent information regulator
  2 protein 1 (Sirt1) could regulate the expression of UCP2 as well. Farnesoid X receptor
  (FXR) upregulates the expression of Pdx-1, NeuroD1, and MafA. Forkhead box-containing
  protein O1 (FoxO1) is the downstream mediator of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt
  pathway, which could modulate the activity and/or expression of Pdx-1 and BAX. N-myc
  downstream-regulated gene (NDRG2) (substrate of Akt) and deubiquitinating enzyme
  ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L (UCHL1) are both involved in beta-cell survival.
  Perilipin and adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADFP) can regulate the
  triglycerides (TG) storage in beta cells. The function of ghrelin includes the activation
  of PI3K/Akt pathway, the nuclear exclusion of FoxO1, the reduction in cytoplasmic
  TG synthesis, and the downregulation of BAX, SREBP-1c, and CHOP-10. Frame in bold
  line, direct target of lipid stress; ⊕, enhance; ⊖, inhibit.
