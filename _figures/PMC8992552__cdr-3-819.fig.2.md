caption: Metabolism and action of gemcitabine [difluoro 2’-deoxycytidine (dFdC)].
  dFdC is transported into the cell through nucleoside transporters (hNTs), then stepwise
  phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), nucleoside monophosphate kinase (NMPK),
  and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), to form active triphosphate metabolite
  (dFdCTP). This molecule then inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis. Diphosphate metabolite
  (dFdCDP) inhibits ribonucleotide reductase (RR), an enzyme that catalyses the conversion
  of ribonucleotide (CDP) to deoxyribonucleotide (dCDP). The majority of dFdC is inactivated
  mainly by cytidine deaminase (CDA) mediated conversion to difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU)
  and then excreted through the ABC transporter. Deamination of dFdCMP to dFdUMP by
  deoxycytidylate deaminase (dCMP deaminase) and subsequent dephosphorylation forms
  dFdU; this is another inactivation pathway of dFdC. dFdUMP inhibits thymidylate
  synthase (TS), resulting in the depletion of the dTMP pool. dFdCTP inhibits dCMP
  deaminase
