caption: '(A): glucose utilization; (B): nucleotide metabolism; (C): protein and amino
  acid metabolism; (D): cytoskeleton; (E): oxidative stress; (F): PI3K signaling pathways;
  (G): lipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism. The red ball represents the up-regulated
  genes, while the green ball represents the down-regulated genes. The connections
  of genes were generated from the data analysis consisting of GO analysis and KEGG
  pathway. The solid lines represent the relationships between genes. The dashed lines
  represent the genes that have an indirect effect. The arrow represents activation.
  The flathead represents suppression. ‘a’ represents activation; ‘b’ represents binding;
  and ‘c’ represents compound. The abbreviation ‘dep’ represents phosphorylation;
  ‘dis’ represents dissociation; and ‘inh’ represents inhibition.'
