caption: Diagrammatic scheme depicting targeted p53 pathway-related genes by upregulated
  miRNAs in prostate tumor cells. An integrated in silico and computational prediction
  databases (DIANA-micro T-CDS, miRBase, and TargetScan) were employed as described
  in “Materials and methods” section to predict potential targets of a subset of highly
  upregulated miRNAs (>2-fold) in prostate tumors. DIANA-miRPath “miRPath v2.0” was
  used to construct potential miRNA interactions in modulating p53 pathway-related
  genes. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)
