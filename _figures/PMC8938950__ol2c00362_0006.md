caption: 'Reaction conditions: 0.05 mmol substrate, 1 mol % A, 1 mL of DCM, 100 bar
  H2, 16 h, rt, unless stated otherwise. The stereochemistry was tentatively assigned
  by assuming a similar hydrogenation pathway to 1a, the absolute configuration of
  which was assigned by comparing the sign of the optical rotation with the literature
  value after the reduction of 2a with LiAlH4. Isolated yields. Enantiomeric excess
  was determined by SFC analysis using chiral stationary phases.2 mol % A was used.'
