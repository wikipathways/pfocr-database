  (A) Ranolazine. (B) Trimetazidine. (C) Dichloroacetate (DCA). (D) Glucagon-Like
  Peptide-1 (GLP-1). (E) Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN). (F) Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4
  (DPP-4) Inhibitors. (G) Elamipretide. (H) AMPK Activators AMPK Activators. (I) Pyruvate
  Dehydrogenase Kinase 4 (PDK4) Inhibitors. (J) Resveratrol (RE). Figure 4 outlines
  metabolic-targeted therapeutic interventions for cardiac functional recovery. Panel
  (A) (Ranolazine) highlights its inhibition of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to optimize
  myocardial oxygen utilization and alleviate angina symptoms. Panel (B) (Trimetazidine)
  emphasizes suppression of CPT1-mediated FA transport and enhanced pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH) activity to shift substrate utilization toward glucose. Panel (C) (Dichloroacetate/DCA)
  illustrates PDH activation to promote pyruvate oxidation and improve lactate clearance.
  Panel (D) (GLP-1) focuses on enhancing myocardial contractility and circulation
  efficiency through metabolic regulation. Panel (E) (NMN) depicts NAD+ biosynthesis
  to restore mitochondrial homeostasis and activate Sirt1-dependent cardioprotective
  pathways. Panel (F) (DPP-4 inhibitor) showing enhanced peptide hormones function
  and increased insulin secretion. Panel (G) (Elamipretide) stabilizes mitochondrial
  supercomplexes (CI/CIII/CIV) to enhance OXPHOS efficiency. Panel (H) (Metformin)
  promotes the uptake and utilization of glucose by the liver, adipose tissue and
  muscles to regulate energy balance. Panel (I) (PDK4 Inhibitors) (PDK4 inhibitor)
  targets PDK4 to improve energy metabolism to alleviate atherosclerosis. Panel (J)
  (Resveratrol/RE) emphasizes antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects to regulate
  blood lipids and inhibit atherosclerosis
