caption: Biological applications of light‐induced dimerization systems. a) The LightOn
  strategy with the VVD homodimerization system to control gene transcription. b) A
  combination of the CYR2‐CIB1 system with dCas9 and transcriptional modulators. Blue‐light‐induced
  dimerization recruited the transcriptional activator to a specific site in the genome
  targeted by dCas9, leading to upregulation of an endogenous gene. c) The optoSOS
  approach with the PhyB‐PIF system generated dynamic input stimulus patterns by red
  light. The altered pathway output downstream of signaling was monitored. d) Nvoc‐TMP‐CI
  molecules are anchored to the plasma membrane through artificial receptors immobilized
  on the glass surface. Uncaging with a focused laser beam allows patterns of activated
  signaling molecules to be generated at the plasma membrane. e) Organelle transport
  is controlled through the CONC system. Uncaging of the coumarinyl group stimulated
  recruitment of motor proteins to the cargo and subsequent transport along microtubules.
  Photocleavage of the NVOC group led to dissociation of motor proteins and cessation
  of transport. f) Maintaining the spindle checkpoint protein Mad1 on a subpopulation
  of kinetochores through the photocleavable TNH system was sufficient to halt the
  transition from metaphase to anaphase. Mad1 was released from a subpopulation of
  kinetochores within the cell by light. g) Uncaging of NvocTMP‐Cl stimulated recruitment
  of Rac1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane through dimerization between HaloTag
  and eDHFR. Addition of SLF′‐TMP triggered the dissociation of Rac1 and translocation
  to the nucleus through dimerization between eDHFR and FKBP′. Addition of TMP, which
  competed for binding to eDHFR, led to release of Rac1 to the cytosol. Multiple cycles
  could be achieved through washing out.
