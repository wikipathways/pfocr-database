caption: A schematic representation of an AntA-I plug-and-play biosynthetic scaffold
  extended with enzymes sourced from a range of organisms. Metabolites produced through
  addition of O-methyltransferase (from M. truncatula) and RadH (from Chaetomium chiversii)
  are shown in red and blue boxes correspondingly. Enzymes within AntA-I plug-and-play
  core biosynthetic pathway are represented in light grey boxes. Additional non-cognate
  secondary tailoring enzymes are shown in darker grey boxes. Dotted lines represent
  deviation away from the natural AQ256 biosynthetic pathway. ACP, acyl carrier protein;
  CLF, chain length factor; KS, ketosynthase.
