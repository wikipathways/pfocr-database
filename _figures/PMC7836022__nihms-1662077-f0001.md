caption: The key metabolic processes are highlighted in orange. Glycolysis is a 10-step
  process that converts glucose to pyruvate releasing energy in the form of ATP and
  NADH. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) generates NADPH used for the biosynthesis
  of fatty acids, cholesterol and reduced glutathione. In addition, the PPP generates
  ribose-5-phosphate required for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, nucleotides
  and nucleic acids. In the mitochondria, glycolytic-derived pyruvate is fed into
  the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. TCA cycle dehydrogenases consume NAD+ to produce
  NADH. Each turn in the cycle forms three NADH molecules. Nucleotide synthesis provides
  molecules that make up the nucleic acids RNA and DNA. Lipid synthesis is the synthesis
  of fatty acids from acetyl Co-A and malonyl-CoA precursors via fatty acid synthases.
  Glutaminolysis is a series of biochemical reactions that converts glutamine to α-ketoglutarate.
  This takes place outside and inside the mitochondria. GSH (glutathione) synthesis
  is the synthesis of GSH from glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. The grey shapes represent
  the signaling events that influence cancer metabolism. RAS activates the transcriptional
  program for metabolic enzymes through the activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway
  leading to upregulation of the MYC transcription factor. MYC promotes metabolic
  phenotypes through transcriptional regulation of key metabolic genes. Receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs) activate PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signaling. Through a series of downstream
  effectors mTORC1 promotes anabolic growth by converting available nutrients for
  lipid, nucleotide and protein synthesis. Mutant LKB1 results in the hyper-activation
  of mTORC1 signaling and elevated HIF signaling and glycolysis. Reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) are generated by the electron transport chain (complex I and III) on the mitochondria
  membrane and activate HIF signaling. 6PG, 6-P-gluconate; R5P, Ribose-5-phosphate;
