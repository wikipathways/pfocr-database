caption: Following synthesis through the activity of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR,
  encoded by the bifunctional DHFR-TS) or pteridine reductase 1 (PTR1), tetrahydrofolate
  (THF) can enter C1 metabolic pathways by direct formylation in an ATP-dependent
  reaction by formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase (FTL, LmjF30.2600). Alternatively, THF
  is converted into 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-THF) through the activity
  of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). 10-CHO-THF can be generated in two steps
  from 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-THF), through oxidation to 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate
  (5,10-CH=THF) by a NADP+-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (DH,
  LmjF26.0320), and hydrolysis to 10-CHO-THF by methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase
  (CH, LmjF26.0320). In L. major the DH and CH activities are contained in the single
  bifunctional protein DHCH1, which like FTL is localized exclusively to the cytosol
  (). While 10-CHO-THF is used in the de novo purine synthetic pathway in many organisms,
  this pathway is absent in Leishmania and many parasitic protozoans (). Current data
  suggest 10-CHO-THF may be utilized in the mitochondrion for methionyl-tRNA formylation,
  the only unique function thus far uncovered by genomic and metabolic studies in
  Leishmania.
