caption: LINE1 and CCF stimulate the SASP gene expression through the cGAS‐STING innate
  immune pathway. When cells undergo senescence, impaired integrity of the nuclear
  envelope contributes to the formation of CCF. In another aspect, high levels of
  LINE1 mRNA were found in senescent cytosolic, which leads to increased amount of
  LINE1 cDNA through reverse transcription. These two sources of cytosolic DNA bind
  to and activate cGAS to generate the second messenger 2,3‐cGAMP. cGAMP sequentially
  binds to and activate STING to recruit TBK1. TBK1 facilitates the phosphorylation
  of IRF3 and NFkB, which function as important transcriptional factors to promote
  the SASP gene expression. 2,3‐cGAMP, 2,3‐cyclic GMP‐AMP; AMP, adenosine monophosphate;
  ATP, adenosine 5′‐triphosphate; CCF, Cytoplasmic chromatin fragment; cGAS, GMP–AMP
