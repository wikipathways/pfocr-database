caption: Local and systemic signaling involved in lateral root growth in response
  to local N supply in Arabidopsis and graminaceous species. In Arabidopsis, NRT1.1-dependent
  auxin removal from the lateral root (LR) primordium prevents LR elongation into
  N-depleted sites, while local high NO3– promotes LR elongation involving the NRT1.1–ANR1
  signaling pathway that is probably conserved in cereals. Local N signaling is integrated
  in the shoot via the transcription factor TCP20 and cytokinin (CK) signaling pathways.
  Local NH4+ stimulates LR emergence in an AMT1;3-dependent manner. OsNAR2.1 and ZmPIN9
  modulate polar auxin transport that promotes LR initiation under local high NO3–
  in rice and maize, respectively. The dashed outline indicates hypothetical functions
  or signaling steps that require further experimental validation. tZ, trans-zeatin;
  IPT, isopentenyl transferase.
