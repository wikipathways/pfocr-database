caption: Schematic of the potential mechanism underlying the electroacupuncture (EA)-mediated
  analgesic effect. Noxious stimuli including heat or proinflammatory cytokines are
  transduced by the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) into the cells,
  thus phosphorylating and activating p38, which translocates from the cytosol to
  the nucleus and promotes transcription by affecting cAMP response element-binding
  protein (CREB), thus upregulating specific proteins including inflammatory cytokines
  or inducing apoptosis. These noxious stimuli can also directly activate protein
  kinase C (PKC). Nociception regulation by TRPV1 and Nav1.7/1.8 receptor stimulation
  in the peripheral nerves propagates the signal through the ascending pathway and
  upregulates proinflammatory cytokines including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and tumor
  necrosis factor-α (TNFα) in the central nervous system, and the signal is then perceived
  as “pain”. Chronic pain re-emerges when nociceptive signals cause prolonged stimulation
  through hippocampal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptors and some other
  areas of the limbic system, and the signals are transmitted through the descending
  pathway, stimulating TRPV4 and triggering pain. Endogenic analgesic mechanisms involve
  the release of opioidergic substances that bind to γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic)
  receptors and μ- or δ-opioid receptors that act locally in the central nervous system
  and inhibit the descending pain pathway. EA exerts therapeutic effects by inhibiting
  the ascending pain pathway and intracellular p38-mediated inflammatory pathway by
  stimulating peripheral opioid receptors. Furthermore, EA promotes endogenic analgesic
  mechanisms, thus exerting immediate local analgesic effects and rescuing CNS-induced
  chronic pain.
