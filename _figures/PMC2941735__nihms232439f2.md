caption: 'Membrane-bound wild type EGFR is activated after binding its ligands: epidermal
  growth factor (EGF) or transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α). The three domains of
  EGFR are highlighted with brackets: i (ligand-binding domain), ii (transmembrane
  domain), and iii (tyrosine kinase domain or TKD). Activated EGFR signals through
  the following pathways: 1) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-1 pathway, 2)
  Ras/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated (ERK)
  pathway, and 3) signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT) pathway
  (only the PI3K-Akt-1 pathway is shown for simplicity). The two commonest categories
  of mutations observed in EGFR are: 1) Somatic “gain-of-function” mutations in the
  TKD, seen prominently in lung cancers (not shown), and 2) deletion mutations in
  the extracellular domain, seen commonly in brain cancers (EGFRvIII). EGFRvIII is
  constitutively active and signals preferentially via the PI3K-Akt-1 pathway. In
  this pathway, activated phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI3K) phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate
  (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 anchors
  Akt-1 to the plasma membrane, where it is phosphorylated by mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)
  and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). Activated Akt-1 phosphorylates
  a plethora of downstream targets resulting in enhanced proliferation and decreased
  cell death. The PTEN tumor suppressor reverses PIP3 back to PIP2, negatively regulating
  PI3K-Akt-1 signaling. In response to ionizing radiation (IR), wild type EGFR can
  translocate into the nucleus and interact with DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase,
  catalytic subunit) stimulating its DNA repair activity (I). However, EGFR with somatic
  mutations in the TKD is defective in nuclear translocation and has a radiosensitizing
  effect (not shown). PI3K-Akt-1 signaling triggered by EGFR or EGFRvIII can also
  promote DSB repair (II). In response to IR, Akt-1 translocates into the nucleus
  and interacts with DNA-PKcs. DNA-PKcs phosphorylates Akt-1 in response to IR promoting
  survival (curved arrow) and we speculate that reciprocal phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs
  by Akt-1 (?) might promote DSB repair by NHEJ. As EGFR signaling promotes NHEJ,
  inhibitors of EGFR and Akt-1 can serve as effective radiosensitizers.'
