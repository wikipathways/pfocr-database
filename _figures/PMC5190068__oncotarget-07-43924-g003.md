caption: A. The KCNN4 and S100A14 centered interaction subnetwork. The minimum network
  connected KCNN4 and S100A14 constructed from a high quality STRING database (combined
  score >= 600) when restricted to 1-NN of KCNN4 and S100A14. Four communities were
  detected using fast greedy searching and are colored differently. The node sizes
  are proportional to the degrees of each gene; B. The regulation frameworks of the
  KCNN4-UBA52-KLF4-S100A14 axis determined by the Bayesian network based on hill-climbing
  scoring. The arrows are the regulation directions; C. Pairwise correlations of expression
  profiles of 4 genes in the TCGA dataset. The upper triangle showed the paired expression
  in all TCGA samples and the red lines represent the linear regression results. The
  lower triangle illustrated the pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficients; D. Hypothesized
  regulation modes of the KCNN4-UBA52-KLF4-S100A14 axis. The frames were colored according
  to the colors of the communities to which they belong. The arrows mean stimulation
  and the blocked arrow means inhibition. To the right is the proof for the regulation
  hypothesis; E. Word cloud representation of enriched GO and pathway terms on genes
  in the subnetwork (adjusted p<0.05). Their significance are illustrated with different
  font size and gray scale.
