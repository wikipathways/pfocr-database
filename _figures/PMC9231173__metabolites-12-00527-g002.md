caption: 'Schematic diagram of metabolic pathway containing toxic methylmalonyl-CoA
  and its toxicity mechanism and treatment options. In methylmalonic aciduria, branched-chain
  amino acids, fatty acids, or propionic acids produced by gut flora can feed into
  propionyl-CoA formation, leading to methylmalonyl-CoA production. The loss of MUT
  activity via mutations to the enzyme itself or via mutations to enzymes required
  to produce the adenosylcobalamin cofactor leads to an accumulation of methylmalonic
  acid. Methylmalonic acid appears to cause mitochondrial toxicity, and this mechanism
  may be at play in other disease contexts as well. Dietary restriction of branched-chain
  amino acids to restrict MMA production from above, or adenosylcobalamin supplementation
  to aid MUT activity, are current strategies. This diagram of MMA pathology suggests
  that a BCAT enzyme inhibitor, or therapies that aid mitochondrial function, may
  be considered as well. BCAT1/2: branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase1/2; PCC:
  propionyl-CoA carboxylase; MUT: methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.'
