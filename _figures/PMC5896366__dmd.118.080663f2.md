caption: EGF receptor (EGFR) effects on ABC transporters. The EGFR signals through
  both MAPK and PI3K pathways to affect ABC transporters, differentially, at the transcriptional,
  translational, and post-translational levels. Following ligand binding, the EGFR
  dimerizes and signals through its tyrosine kinase domain to lead to the phosphorylation
  and activation of MEK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK. ERK signaling
  increases the mRNA and protein expression of ABCG2, decreases the mRNA and protein
  expression of ABCC4, and decreases the mRNA expression of ABCB1 while preventing
  the degradation of ABCB1 protein by the proteasome. PI3K can also be activated downstream
  from EGFR tyrosine kinase activity leading to the activation of Akt. Akt signaling
  then increases the mRNA expression of ABCG2, ABCB1, and ABCC4, and also increases
  the protein expression and membrane localization of ABCG2. PI3K signaling can be
  inhibited by PTEN; PTEN is activated by PPARγ signaling. Pharmacological inhibitors
  used to elucidate this pathway have been noted at the level of their inhibition;
  mRNA changes induced by the ERK pathway are noted in blue, while changes induced
  by the Akt pathway are noted in orange.
