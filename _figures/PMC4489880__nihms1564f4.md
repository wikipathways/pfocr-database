caption: The core Hippo pathway was defined in Drosophila as a cassette composed of
  the Ste20 family kinase Hippo (Hpo), which forms a complex with the WW domain adaptor
  protein Salvador (Sav). Hpo phosphorylates and activates the NDR family kinase Warts
  (Wts), which is complexed with the adaptor protein MATS (‘Mob as Tumour Suppressor’).
  Wts phosphorylates the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki). Phosphorylated
  Yki is bound by 14-3-3 proteins and excluded from the nucleus. When in the nucleus,
  Yki promotes the transcription of growth-promoting and apoptosis-inhibiting genes,
  such as Cyclin E and Diap1. Upstream of Hpo lies the cadherin Fat, and the FERM
  domain proteins Expanded (Ex) and Merlin. Kibra is a WW domain protein that promotes
  Ex-Mer interactions, and enhances Hpo pathway activity. The analogous pathway in
  mammals is outlined on the right. YAP and TAZ are homologous to Yorkie, Mst1/2 are
  homologous to Hpo, Lats1/2 are homologous to Wts, Sav is homologous to WW45, NF2
  is homologous to Merlin and FRMD6 is homologous to Ex. The vertebrate homolog of
  Fat is Fat4, but this protein has not yet been shown to function in the vertebrate
  Hippo pathway.
