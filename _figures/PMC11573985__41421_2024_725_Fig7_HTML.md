caption: a The colonization of L.m. via adhesion-related Rib domain initiated metabolic
  reprogramming including the altered amino acid and lactate. The release of lactate
  could activate SAA via GPR81-p-NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. SAA then activates monocytes
  and DCs which subsequently stimulate Th1 cells, mediating AD-associated neuroinflammation.
  Other species bearing Rib, including Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium,
  Streptococcus suis, etc., may have similar adhesive potential and Th1 stimulating
  function in AD development. During this process, phenylalanine, isoleucine, and
  other amino acids also increase to stimulate Th1 cells as mentioned in our last
  report. b Oral administration of GV-971 inhibits Rib-bearing L.m. adhesion and decreases
  bacteria colonization, suppresses the lactate-GPR81-SAA axis, and inhibits phenylalanine,
  and isoleucine, which finally reduces Th1 cell activation
