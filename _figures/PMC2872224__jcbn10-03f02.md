caption: (A) Rescuing effects of Korea red ginseng against H. pylori-induced inflammation
  or cytotoxicity [] Red ginseng could block several pathways to H. pylori-associated
  gastric damages including the connection between inflammation and carcinogenesis.
  They can block signal transduction pathway to inflammatory signals, attenuate apoptosis
  execution, and repress redox sensitive transcriptional activation. (B) Inhibitory
  activities and attenuated expression of 5-LOX with red ginseng in H. pylori-infected
  gastric epithelial cells []. Besides of COX-2 activation after H. pylori infection,
  H. pylori infection triggered 5-LOX activation, leading to increased production
  of 5(S)-HETE. Red ginseng showed efficient blockade to 5-LOX activation as equivalently
  efficient to 5-LOX inhibitors, geraniin.
