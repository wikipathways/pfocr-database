caption: Schematic model. Anti-inflammatory effect of celastrol in TNBC cells. Celastrol
  downregulates IL1B through the inhibition of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. In addition,
  celastrol inhibits IL1B-induced signaling pathway in TNBC cells. Therefore, it is
  evident that celastrol suppresses IL1B-related inflammatory responses, including
  cell invasion. TNBC, triple-negative breast cancer; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase.
