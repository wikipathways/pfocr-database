caption: 'Iron absorption mechanisms at the enterocyte. Under normal conditions the
  regulatory pathway of iron absorption at the enterocyte involves the regulatory
  molecules DMT1, hepcidin, ferroportin and then iron transfer and uptake by transferrin
  in plasma. A parallel pathway of iron absorption may involve lipophilic dietary
  chelating molecules like maltol. Different pathway of iron uptake by the enterocyte
  also exists for haem iron. Adapted from ref. [22]. DMT1: Divalent metal transporter
  1.'
