caption: Model for how cysB mutations confer mecillinam resistance. In a ΔcysB mutant,
  the cysteine level is reduced and, as a result, the cysteine/cystine shuttle system
  (, ) cannot provide the periplasm with enough reducing agents, which results in
  a stress response that changes the expression levels of >450 proteins, including
  increases in LpoB and PBP1B levels. The increases in LpoB and PBP1B levels allow
  cell wall biosynthesis via an alternative pathway, bypassing the need for functional
  PBP2. Microscopy studies of the wild-type strain and the cysB mutant, with and without
  mecillinam, show that both strains are rod-shaped in the absence of mecillinam and
  spherical in the presence of mecillinam, with the difference being that the loss
  of functional PBP2 through mecillinam inhibition is not lethal in cysB mutants.
