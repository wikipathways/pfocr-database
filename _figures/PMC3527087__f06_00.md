caption: The pathway of starch biosynthesis in leaves.Carbon assimilated via the Calvin
  cycle is partitioned with a fraction exported to the cytosol for sucrose synthesis
  and a fraction retained in the chloroplast for starch synthesis. Redox and allosteric
  regulation of the enzyme AGPase controls the flux of carbon into starch. Mutants
  deficient in plastidial PGI, PGM1 and AGPase have major reductions in starch contents,
  although small amounts remain, suggesting an alternative minor route (see text).
