caption: a | In adipocytes, following binding of the steroid hormone oestradiol (E2),
  oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) engages in phosphorylation (P) of Ser (S) and Thr (T)
  residues in subunits of carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP)
  — a key transcription factor regulating the expression of genes involved in lipid
  biosynthesis. This phosphorylation (occurring through the activation of downstream
  kinases protein kinase A (PKA) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)) counteracts
  the dephosphorylation events (involving protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A)) stimulated
  by the binding of insulin to the insulin receptor and precludes ChREBP nuclear translocation.
  This decreases the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, such as fatty acid
  synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC; also known as ACAC). b | When bound
  to the xenoestrogen diethyl-stilboestrol (DES) in myometrial uterine cells, ERα
  activates the PI3K-AKT signalling pathway, which results in phosphorylation of an
  epigenetic modifier, enhancer of Zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), which functions as a
  histone methyltransferase and introduces repressive trimethylation of histone H3
  at Lys27 (H3K27me3). Phosphorylation of EZH2 decreases its histone methyltransferase
  activity and leads to derepression of genes, including ER-responsive genes. This
  altered expression of ER-responsive genes has been shown to disrupt uterine tissue
  morphology and function, increasing susceptibility to tumorigenic transformation.
  c | Extranuclear and intranuclear steroid signals can also cooperate in regulating
  gene expression. In prostate cancer cells, androgen (A) binds to membrane-localized
  androgen receptor (AR). This binding results in downstream signalling that activates
  metalloproteinases, which then act to release ligands of the membrane epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) from the extracellular matrix. This leads to transactivation
  of EGFR to trigger AKT (not shown) and ERK signalling. Activation of ERK signalling
  in part requires Src-mediated Tyr (Y) residue phosphorylation of paxillin. When
  ERK is activated, it regulates Ser phosphorylation of paxillin. Ser phosphorylated
  paxillin then enters the nucleus and assists in modulating both nuclear AR-mediated
  transcription and nuclear ERK-mediated transcription, promoting cell proliferation.
  Membrane AR signalling, in collaboration with nuclear signalling, therefore regulates
  prostate cancer epithelial cell growth.
