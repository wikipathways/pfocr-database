caption: Proposed model for the thermodynamic cycle observed for the triplet repeat
  oligonucleotides. Pathway A is determined only for the hairpins in isolation, which
  is indicated by the dashed arrows. The equilibrium for pathway B is shifted so far
  onto the side of the duplex that the reverse reaction (duplex to hairpin) is never
  observed, as indicated by the crossed arrow.
