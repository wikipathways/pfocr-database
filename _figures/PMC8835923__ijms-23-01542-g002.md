caption: Principal hallmarks of senescent cells. Many different stimuli may cause
  a DNA damage in the cell and activate the DNA-Damage Response (DDR), which may produce
  the expression of the Cell-Cycle Arrest (CCA) molecules. Prolonged activation of
  DDR and CCA proteins produce cellular senescence and the release of the Senescent-Associated
  Secretory Phenotype (SASP), enriched in different proinflammatory, profibrotic and
  growth factors that are regulated by NF-κB pathway activation and may cause activation
  of cellular senescence in a paracrine manner, inflammaging and fibrosis in the kidney,
  and other tissues.
