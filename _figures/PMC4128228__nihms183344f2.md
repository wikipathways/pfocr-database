  Top, schematics showing commissural axons before, during, and after crossing the
  CNS midline (grey). Bottom, enlarged schematics of pre- and post-crossing neurons
  indicating regulation and signaling output of axon guidance receptors. In pre-crossing
  fly commissural axons, Frazzled (Fra) mediates attractive signaling in response
  to midline-produced Netrin (Net). Fra also signals independently of Net to induce
  expression of commissureless (comm), a transmembrane sorting receptor that directs
  Robo-containing vesicles to the late endocytic pathway. After crossing, comm expression
  ceases and Robo is trafficked to the growth cone where it can mediate a Slit-dependent
  repulsive response and prevent re-crossing. Robo and Fra independently regulate
  crossing in fly axons. In vertebrates, the Fra homolog DCC signals Net-dependent
  attraction as axons approach the CNS ventral midline. Pre-crossing Slit sensitivity
  is antagonized by the Robo3.1 isoform of the Robo3/Rig-1 receptor. After crossing,
  Robo3.1 is replaced by Robo3.2, which functions alongside Robo1 (and Robo2, not
  shown) to prevent re-crossing. By analogy to Xenopus spinal axons, Robo1 could potentially
  act in post-crossing vertebrate commissural axons to silence the attractive output
  of DCC.

    In pre-crossing fly commissural axons, Frazzled (Fra) mediates attractive signaling

    Fra independently regulate crossing in fly axons. In vertebrates, the Fra homolog
    DCC signals Net-dependent attraction as axons approach the CNS ventral midline.
    Pre-crossing Slit sensitivity is antagonized by the Robo3.1 isoform of the Robo3/Rig-1
