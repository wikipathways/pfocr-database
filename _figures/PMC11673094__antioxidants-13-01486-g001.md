caption: 'The potential molecular pathways of fatty acid, especially PA-induced vascular
  endothelial dysfunction, are illustrated and summarized—PA uptake by endothelial
  cells through fatty acid transporter or passive diffusion. PA activated ASM to enhance
  ROS generation through NOX2 and NOX4. Moreover, PA inhibited the SERCA pump, which
  induced ER stress and increased JNK expression. ER stress induced by PA promoted
  endothelial mesenchymal transition (EndMT). PA also inhibited the TysR/PARP1 pathway
  to downregulate the expression of MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1, leading to the fragmentation
  of mitochondria. PA could activate autophagy but suppress autophagy flux, which
  may modulate the senescence of endothelial cells. Furthermore, PA increases NPM
  levels to activate the NF-kB pathway, leading to inflammation. Meanwhile, PA started
  the TLR4-dependent MyD88 and TIRF pathway, growing the inflammatory mediator MCP-1
  and ICAM-1 levels. PA suppressed DDK1 to induce CCN1-related cell apoptosis. In
  addition, PA activated the NLRP3/caspase-1 pathway to induce pyroptosis of endothelial
  cells. Moreover, PA enhanced the expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 to inhibit the PI3K/AKT/eNOS
  signaling pathway, leading to insulin resistance. ASM: acid sphingomyelinase; Bax:
