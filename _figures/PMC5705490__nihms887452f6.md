caption: Scopolamine or VU0255035 blockade of ACh-M1 receptors located on GABAergic
  interneurons results in disinhibition and a burst of glutamate that activates AMPA
  receptors. This leads to stimulation of voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCC)
  and influx of Ca2+ that activates BDNF release, which then stimulates TrkB signaling,
  including activation of the ERK1/2-mTORC1 pathway. This pathway controls the translation
  and synthesis of synaptic proteins (such as GluA1 and PSD95), which are required
  for the formation of new synapses, which is associated with the rapid antidepressant
  actions of scopolamine. Numbers indicate points in these pathways that were targeted
  by mutant and pharmacological approaches, including analysis of (1) BDNF Met knock
  in mice in which BDNF release is blocked or infusion of BDNF neutralizing antibody,
  (2) VDCC inhibitor, verapamil, (3) selective TrkB inhibitor, Ana-12, (4) AMPA receptor
  antagonist, CNQX, (5) blockade of neuronal firing, TTX, and (6) a neuronal silencing
  agent, the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol.
