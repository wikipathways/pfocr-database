caption: Autophagy-mediated elimination of pathogens. (A) Once a virus enters a cell,
  (I) viral DNA may be exposed in the cytoplasm, leading to cGAS-STING pathway activation
  and IFN-I expression, thus triggering the antiviral defense; or (II) viral RNA (endosome)
  can be recognized by TLR3 (dsRNA) and by TLR7 or TLR8 (ssRNA), triggering IRAK and
  TRAF6, which leads to IFN-I synthesis. Virus recognition by TLR2 or TLR4 may also
  trigger the cascade that leads to IFN-I (IRF3, IRF7, or NF-kB) and pro-inflammatory
  cytokine activation transcription factors. (B) Once pathogens enter the cell, a
  parasitophorous vacuole with glycosylated molecules starts enclose them. Galectins
  present in this vacuole bind to NDP52, which interacts directly with E3 ligase LRSAM1
  and indirectly with TBK1. TBK1 interacts with optineurin. NDP52 binds to LC3-II,
  resulting in xenophagy activation. LRSAM1 polymerize ubiquitin at different targets
  that are yet to be identified. This hypothetical model includes the pathogen and
  the parasitophorous vesicle as targets. NDP52 recognizes the ubiquitin tags, optineurin,
  and sequestosome-I. TBK1 phosphorylates optineurin and sequestosome (I) After these
  steps, the autophagic isolation membrane elongates to capture the pathogen to degrade
  it.
