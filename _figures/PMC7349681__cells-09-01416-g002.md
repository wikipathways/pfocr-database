caption: Types of extrusion. (A) Apoptotic cell extrusion. There are two known pathways
  for apoptotic cells to elicit extrusion responses in their nonapoptotic neighbors.
  [Left side] When a cell undergoes apoptosis, it becomes hypercontractile. This contractile
  force is sensed by its healthy neighbors through E-cadherin which leads, in turn,
  to assembly of an actomyosin complex through coronin-1B. [Right side] The apoptotic
  cell releases S1P. S1P binds to S1P2 receptors present on the healthy neighbors
  of the dying cell; this ultimately activates RhoA through a signal transduction
  pathway that involves p115 RhoGEF. The active form of RhoA mediates assembly of
  actomyosin complex in the neighbors. (B) Oncogenic cell extrusion. Depending on
  the type of oncogene expressed, a transformed cell elicits distinct signaling pathways
  which potentially converge to generate biomechanical changes. Activation of the
  Cdc42/ROCK signaling pathway and upregulation of cytoskeletal-interacting proteins
  (e.g., EPLIN, paxillin, and plectin) enhance contractility in the transformed cell.
  Simultaneously, in the neighboring wild-type cells, activation of the RhoA/ROCK
  signaling pathway upregulates other cytoskeletal proteins (e.g., Filamin A, vimentin).
  Mechanisms triggered in both the transformed and wild-type cells display mutual
  coregulation.
