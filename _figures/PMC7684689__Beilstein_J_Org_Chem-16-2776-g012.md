caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of fatty acids leading to the observed regioisomers
  of the isoprenyl esters. All acids shown were found in form of their isoprenyl esters.
  (Z)-9-Hexadecenoic acid is obtained from palmitic acid by a Δ9-desaturase (ds).
  Malonate elongation and reduction (red) leads to (Z)-3-hydroxy-11-octadecenoic acid,
  an intermediate of the fatty acid elongation cycle. The following elimination by
  a dehydratase (dh) leads to (2E,11Z)-2,11-octadecadienoic acid and after hydrogenation
  (hy) to (Z)-11-octadecenoic acid, completing the C2-elongation. A second elongation
  furnishes (Z)-3-hydroxy-13-eicosenoic acid. Similarly, a Δ11-desaturase gives (Z)-11-hexadecenoic
  acid, (Z)-3-hydroxy-13-octadecenoic acid and (2E,13Z)-2,13-octadecadienoic acid.
  Both desaturases might also act on octadecanoic acid, but only the elongation of
  (Z)-11-octadecenoic acid can be observed, leading to (Z)-3-hydroxy-13-eicosenoic
  acid. The saturated 3-hydroxyoctadecanoic and stearic acids as well as (E)-2-octadecenoic
  acids are obtained similarly directly from palmitic acid. The proposed biosynthesis
  likely takes place in form of the conjugated acids, e.g., coenzyme A esters or acyl
  carrier proteins. Finally, the acids are converted into the isoprenyl esters and
  the hydroxy acids are acylated.
