caption: Interplay between muscle and brain in BDNF-mediated redox regulation. Resistance
  exercise induces BDNF generation from CREB and mTor phosphorylation by the Pi3K/AKT
  signaling pathway. The BDNF release from muscle contraction reaches the brain and
  binds the TrkB receptor to induce the phosphorylation of different cascades of signaling
  pathways, which results in the additional secretion of BDNF. Brain BDNF leads to
  the activation of Nrf2, which regulates the expression of antioxidants molecules.

  description: Interplay between muscle and brain in BDNF-mediated redox regulation.
    Resistance exercise induces BDNF generation from CREB and mTor phosphorylation
    by the Pi3K/AKT signaling pathway. The BDNF release from muscle contraction reaches
    the brain and binds the TrkB receptor to induce the phosphorylation of different
    cascades of signaling pathways, which results in the additional secretion of BDNF.
    Brain BDNF leads to the activation of Nrf2, which regulates the expression of
    antioxidants molecules. BDNF =brain-derived neurotrophic factor; IGF1 = insulin-like
    growth factor 1; IGF1R = insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor; Pi3K = phosphatidylinositol
    3-kinase; IRS1 = Insulin receptor substrate 1; pAKT = protein kinase B phosphorylated;
    MEK = mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK = extracellular signal–regulated kinase;
    CREB = cAMP-response element-binding protein phosphorylated; mTORC1 = mammalian
    target of rapamycin complex 1; p70s6k = ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1; TrkB
    = Tropomyosin receptor kinase B; PLCγ = phospholipase C gamma; CamKII = calcium/calmodulin-dependent
    protein kinase II; ARE = antioxidant response element; pKeap1 = Kelch-like ECH-associated
    protein 1 phosphorylated; Nrf2 = nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2.
