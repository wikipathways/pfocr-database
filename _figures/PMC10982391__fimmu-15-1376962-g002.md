  Overview of TDEs indirectly regulate CD8+ T cells via the TME cells. The TME contains various subgroups of immune cells, such as DCs, B cells, macrophages, Tregs, MDSCs, etc. The figure demonstrates the regulatory effects of different cell subgroups on CD8+ T cells. It is noteworthy that TDEs transport a diverse range of regulatory molecules that interact with immune cells in the TME through various pathways, resulting in inhibitory effects on CD8+ T cells. DCs possess the capability to effectively capture and present antigens. TDEs impede the activation of DCs and the presentation of antigens (e.g., PGE2, ARG1, etc.), thereby suppressing the activation of CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, TDEs can also hinder the functionality of CD8+ T cells by influencing cell polarization (e.g., PIGF, MMP9, miR-1231-5p, PD-L1, etc.) in M2-like macrophages and Bregs, ultimately promoting tumor growth. Additionally, TDEs proficiently inhibit anti-tumor immune responses by augmenting the activation, proliferation, and functionality of Tregs and MDSCs (e.g., 4-1BBL, HSP-86, HSP-70, miR-21, etc.).
