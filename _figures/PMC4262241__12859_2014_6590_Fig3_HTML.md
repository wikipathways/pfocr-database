caption: Network enrichment analysis of point mutations in genome TCGA-02-0014. The
  likelihood that one of the 34 mutated genes in the genome (indicated by red and
  black nodes) was determined either based on their linkage to the set of other 33
  point mutations (black crosses), or in the context of known cancer pathways (red
  circles), or by both criteria (red crosses). Mutations that did not reveal any functional
  involvement are indicated by black circles. Linkage to cancer pathways is exemplified
  by the relationship between TGFBR2 and the genes of the KEGG05214 glioma pathway
  (green circles). Other relationships of this type are not shown.
