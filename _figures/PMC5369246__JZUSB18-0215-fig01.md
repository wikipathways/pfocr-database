caption: Signaling pathways of ATM and ATRThe DNA damage response is activated by
  ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs. All three play central roles in DDR. The ATM-CHK2 and ATR-CHK1
  signaling pathways activate the HRR. The ATM and ATR pathways can be activated respectively
  by DSBs and SSBs. ATM activation can be regulated by Tip60, MRN complex, ATR, and
  PP2A as well as Wip1. The activated ATM can further trigger the activation of CHK2,
  SMC-1, FANCD2, BRCA1, as well as H2AX. In addition, the activated CHK2 can phosphorylate
  Cdc25A and p53. The ATR pathway can be activated by ATRIP, TopBP1, claspin, and
  9-1-1 complex. The activation of ATR leads to phosphorylation of various downstream
  targets such as CHK1, SMC-1, ATM, and p21. Furthermore, CHK1 can facilitate phosphorylation
  of Wee1, RAD51, Cdc25A, p65, and Rb
