caption: Role of the inflammation-associated transcription factor signaling pathway
  (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in the inflammatory
  response. NF-κB and MAPK signaling can be activated by the binding of diverse ligands
  to receptors. In NF-κB signaling, various adapter proteins and signaling kinases
  lead to activation of the IKK complex, which then phosphorylates IκBα. Proteasomes
  can degrade phosphorylated IκBα. The free p50/p65 complex can translocate to the
  nucleus and activate transcription of active genes, such as cytokines, chemokines,
  adhesion molecules, and enzyme-related pro-inflammatory factors. In MAPK signaling,
  activated Myd88 by stimuli recruits TRAF6 to assemble a MyD88 signaling complex
  and subsequently facilitates TAK1 activation by TRAF6. Activated TAK1 mediates the
  stimulation of MAPKs, which activate AP-1, a transcription factor involved in inflammation.
  Additionally, activator protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-κB can induce the transcription
  of inflammatory genes. The signaling steps are affected by phytochemicals in the
  NF-κB and MAPK pathway axes.
