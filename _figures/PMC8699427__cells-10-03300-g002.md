caption: 'Dysfunctional intercellular signaling within macrophages, hepatocytes and
  adipocytes in the pathogenesis of obesity-related NAFLD. A2AR, STING and Per1/2
  are predominantly expressed in macrophages. Increased A2AR and/or Per1/2 in macrophages
  functions to protect whereas up-activated cGAS-STING signaling pathway in macrophages
  functions to aggravate fat deposition and inflammatory responses in hepatocytes.
  Furthermore, overexpression of Per1/2 in macrophages inhibits inflammatory responses
  in adipocytes. MiR-155 from macrophages aggravates insulin resistance. In contrast,
  miR-34a from the adipocytes promotes the polarization of macrophages toward M2 cells
  from M1 cells. Moreover, stressed hepatocytes release increased numbers of EVs and
  promote macrophage activation and accumulation. ps: EVs: extracellular vesicles.'
