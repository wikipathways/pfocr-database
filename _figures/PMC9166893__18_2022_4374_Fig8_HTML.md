caption: Model of CK2α-mediated regulation of cell cycle checkpoint response following
  induction of DNA replication stress. A Multiple replication factors contribute to
  regulate the DNA replication stress response preventing DNA damage and allowing
  completion of DNA replication. The slowing down or stalling of replication forks
  exposes ssDNA stretches which attract RPA whose function is to coat and stabilize
  these segments of DNA. It follows the recruitment of ATR–ATRIP complex which, in
  turn, phosphorylates CHK1 activating the checkpoint signalling. CLSPN interacts
  with CHK1 contributing to efficient ATR-mediated phosphorylation and activation
  of CHK1. We provide evidence showing that CK2α interacts with both CLSPN and CHK1
  and stabilizes their association. The replisome is connected to DNA replication
  stress checkpoint machinery. Evidence shows that several protein kinases including
  Cdc7, CDK2 and ATR, phosphorylate various components of the MCM protein complex.
  In particular, ATM/ATR-dependent MCM phosphorylation primarily responds to replication
  stress. Besides CLSPN, efficient phosphorylation of CHK1 is mediated by other proteins
  including MCM7, RAD17, TopBP1 and the MRN complex. We found that CK2α interacts
  with MCM7 and CDC45 contributing to their assembly and localization on chromatin
  during normal cell cycle and upon induction of DNA replication stress, respectively.
  B We propose that CK2α plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of the replisome
  by stabilizing the association of specific replication factors and ensuring optimal
  activation of the ATR-CHK1 checkpoint pathway upon induction of replication stress.
  Down-regulation of CK2α leads to destabilization of the aforementioned complex formations
  which results in compromised DNA checkpoint response
