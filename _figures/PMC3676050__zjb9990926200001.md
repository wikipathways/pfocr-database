caption: (A) Construction of an ntrX::kan insertion-deletion mutant in N. gonorrhoeae
  strain 1291, using a nonpolar promoterless kanamycin resistance cassette as detailed
  in Materials and Methods. The ntrY gene is upstream of ntrX. No polar effects are
  expected on the gene downstream of ntrX, dprA, as there is a large intergenic region
  of >80 bp between these two genes. The dprA gene is annotated as DNA processing
  chain A (NGO1865) in the FA1090 genome. (B) Summary of the N. gonorrhoeae respiratory
  chain. A number of different substrates can be used to provide reducing power to
  the electron transport chain, which transfers electrons from the ubiquinone-ubiquinol
  pool (UQ pool) to cytochrome c (cyt c) via the cytochrome bc1 complex. Electrons
  are then transferred to a number of final electron acceptors—oxygen (cytochrome
  cbb3 oxidase [Cco]), hydrogen peroxide (cytochrome c peroxidase [CCP])—or to nitrite
  and then nitric oxide (nitrite reductase [AniA] and nitric oxide reductase [NorB],
  respectively). The latter two enzymes comprise the partial denitrification pathway
  present in the gonococcus. NorB takes electrons directly from the UQ pool and is
  only energy conserving if used in tandem with the Nuo NADH dehydrogenase. All four
  terminal reductases (Cco, CCP, AniA, and NorB) are downregulated in the Ng-ntrX
  mutant.
