caption: 'The molecular mechanism of exosome biogenesis and secretion is not fully
  understood but is a very tightly regulated process governed by multiple signaling
  molecules that may be unique for each type of cells. The origin of exosomes is a
  result of late endosome inward budding of multivesicular bodies (MVB) that contain
  selective intraluminal contents. The process is mediated by three independent pathways:
  the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) dependent pathway,
  the tetraspanin dependent pathway, and the ceramide dependent pathway [, ]. The
  MVBs can either be degraded in the lysosome or be secreted in the form of exosomes
  into the extracellular space. The secretion of exosomes is mainly controlled by
  the proteins in the exosomal membrane, including RAB GTPase proteins and RAB effector
  molecules [, -]. Furthermore, exosomal secretion also can be affected by other factors,
  such as intracellular Ca2+, p53, microenvironmental pH, and expression of heparanase
  [-]. After secretion, the exosomes will migrate to the recipient cells, but this
  process has not yet been explained. In recent studies, uptake and internalization
  of exosomes by recipient cells have been revealed to depend on three dependent mechanisms:
  (1) surface receptor-ligand interaction; (2) internalization through direct fusion;
  and (3) internalization through endocytosis [, -]. Finally, the contents transferred
  by exosomes can influence the function of the recipient cell ().'
