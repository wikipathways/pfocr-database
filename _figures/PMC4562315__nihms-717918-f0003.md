caption: Yes-associated protein (YAP) can, in a context-dependent manner, function
  as a tumour suppressor by either inhibiting WNT signalling or triggering apoptosis.
  a | Cytoplasmic YAP dampens WNT signalling by multiple mechanisms. YAP recruits
  β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTRCP) to the destruction complex for β-catenin
  degradation, which leads to β-catenin downregulation in the absence of WNT. Cytoplasmic
  YAP also restricts the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and Dishevelled (DVL),,
  which facilitates the WNT transcriptional response when forming a complex with β-catenin–T
  cell factor (TCF). Expression of YAP abrogates the DVL-mediated upregulation of
  the WNT target genes, such as LGR5 (which encodes leucine-rich repeat-containing
  G-protein coupled receptor 5) and AXIN2 (REFS ,). b | Oncogene-induced DNA damage
  promotes the activation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)–JUN N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) axis to phosphorylate the adaptor protein 14-3-3 at the binding site
  of ABL1, releasing the ABL1 tyrosine kinase from the cytoplasm into the nucleus
  where it phosphorylates YAP on a tyrosine residue. Tyrosine-phosphorylated YAP then
  forms a complex with the tumour suppressor TP73 to support the transcription of
  pro-apoptotic genes, such as BAX (which encodes BCL-2-associated X gene) and PUMA
  (which encodes p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis; also known as BBC3). Mammalian
  STE20-like protein kinase 1 (MST1)-induced activation of the Hippo pathway suppresses
  this pro-apoptotic response by phosphorylating YAP at specific serine residues and
  thereby inhibiting its activity. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; GSK3, glycogen
  synthase kinase 3; LATS, large tumour suppressor.
