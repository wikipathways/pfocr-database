caption: 'MAMP (microbe-associated molecular pattern)-induced cellular signaling.
  (A) Schematic representation of the MAMP-induced cellular signaling pathway in plant
  cells, using flg22 peptide as an example of a classical MAMP. See introduction text
  for description. Highlighted in red are the events generated by in vivo activation
  of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), MPK3 and MPK6, by transgenic expression
  of a constitutively active MAPK kinase (MKK5-CA). (B) Western blot analysis for
  detecting activated forms of MAPKs in Arabidopsis protoplasts after flg22 treatment
  or transfection of c-myc-tagged MKK5-CA construct. The identities of the MAPK bands
  are indicated on the right. Protoplast transfection and western blotting to identify
  specific activated MAPKs was performed as described (Ranf et al., ; Eschen-Lippold
  et al., ; Lassowskat et al., ). Abbreviations used: FLS2, flg22 receptor; rbohD,
  NADPH oxidase responsible for flg22-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production;
  CDPKs, calcium-dependent protein kinases; CBL, calcineurin-B-like protein; CIPK,
  CBL-interacting protein kinase; CaM, calmodulin.'
