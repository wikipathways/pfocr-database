caption: Effect of small DNA viruses on the ARF-p53 pathway. Different viral proteins
  from DNA tumor viruses affect the ARF-p53 pathway both negatively and positively.
  Genotoxic and oncogenic stress created by small DNA virus infections can induce
  p53 activation, which in turn results in the activation of downstream effectors
  including p21/Waf1 and MDM2. If the DNA damage created by the stress is extensive
  and irreparable, cells undergo apoptosis. If the DNA damage is mild, the p53 pathway
  induces a cell cycle arrest through p21/Waf1 until the DNA damage is repaired. Middle
  t antigen (PyMT-Ag) from murine polyomavirus, and immediate early protein (E1A)
  protein from adenovirus can induce the ARF-p53 pathway, which results in cell cycle
  arrest/apoptosis. Therefore, different viruses have evolved a number of strategies
  to inactivate the p53 pathway. JCV LT-Ag, SV40 LT-Ag HPV E6, and AD E1A-55K/E4-ORF6
  can directly bind to p53 and inactivate it. AD E1B-19K inhibits p53-induced apoptosis.
  JCV LT-Ag, SV40 LT-Ag HPV E7, and AD E1A bind and inactivate pRB and thus bypass
  the p21/Waf1-induced cell cycle arrest. PySm t-Ag inhibits ARF-mediated activation
  of p53 by targeting PP2A. Sm t-Ag from SV40 and JCV may also inactivate the same
  pathway by targeting PP2A.
