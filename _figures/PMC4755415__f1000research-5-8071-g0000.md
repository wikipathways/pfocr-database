caption: ( A) Model of the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB)
  signaling pathway. Auxin promotes the formation of the TIR1/AFB Auxin/INDOLE-3-ACETIC
  ACID INDUCIBLE (Aux/IAA) co-receptor to promote the ubiquitylation and subsequent
  degradation of the Aux/IAA repressor. Aux/IAA degradation relieves repression of
  AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcription factors, allowing for auxin-responsive
  gene expression. One of the transcript families upregulated by auxin is the SAUR
  family. The small SMALL AUXIN UP RNA (SAUR) proteins encoded by these transcripts
  have been suggested to play roles in multiple processes, one of which is interaction
  with and inhibition of members of the PP2C.D family of phosphatases, which act to
  regulate H +-ATPase activity. Further, INDOLE-3-BUTYRIC ACID RESPONSE5 (IBR5) and
  MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE12 (MPK12) have been implicated in regulating auxin-responsive
  gene transcription; this regulation is not through destabilization of the Aux/IAA
  repressors, suggesting a yet-to-be discovered mechanism of regulating auxin-responsive
  gene expression. For in-depth reviews of the TIR/AFB signaling pathway, please refer
  to , . For an in-depth review of SAUR proteins, please refer to .( B) Model of the
  S-PHASE KINASE ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2A (SKP2A) signaling pathway. E2FC/DPB repress
  expression of cell cycle genes. The F-box protein SKP2A binds auxin and promotes
  degradation of E2FC/DPB in an auxin-dependent manner. Degradation of E2FC/DPB relieves
  repression of cell cycle genes and allows for binding by activating E2F+/DP+ complexes.
  For an in-depth review of the SKP2A signaling pathway, please refer to .( C) Model
  of the putative AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN1 (ABP1) signaling pathway. Apoplastic auxin
  is bound by ABP1, which allows for interaction with the TRANSMEMBRANE KINASE RECEPTOR
  (TMK) family of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases. ABP1 binding of auxin
  regulates RHO-LIKE GTPASE 2 (ROP2) and ROP6 activation and binding to ROP interactive
  CRIB motif-containing proteins (RICs) proteins to positively regulate microtubule
  polymerization and F-actin polymerization and also alter PINFORMED1 protein localization
  to alter auxin efflux. For an in-depth review of the ROP/RIC system, please refer
