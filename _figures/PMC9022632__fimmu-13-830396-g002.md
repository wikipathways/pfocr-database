caption: Molecular factors govern adaptive NK cell function. Fc segment of Abs can
  take shape specific signal of adaptive NK cells to recognize target cells by binding
  to CD16. NKG2C, CD2, TIGIT, and other unknown molecules may act as crucial signaling
  pathway for the activation or inhibition of adaptive NK cells. IL-12, IL-18, and
  other cytokines together constitute the pro-inflammatory cytokine signal, which
  guides adaptive NK cell differentiation, expansion, and activation. Epigenetic programming
  promotes stochastic DNA methylation-dependent allelic silencing of FCER1G, SYK,
  and SH2D1B. These ultimately contribute to IFNG promoter hypomethylation and format
  heterogeneous adaptive NK cell repertoire. The up-regulation of ARID5B and its inducing
  UQCRB with low H3K9Me2 in the promoter region alter metabolic reprogramming, prolong
  survival, and motivate abundant IFN-γ secretion of adaptive NK cells. Abs, antibodies;
  CD, cluster of differentiation; TIGIT, T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain; interleukin,
  IL; IFN-γ, Interferon-gamma; TNF-α, Tumor necrosis factor alpha; and ARID5B, AT-rich
  interaction domain 5.
