caption: Crosstalk between Wnt, Notch, TGFβ, BMP, and Hedgehog signaling pathways.
  β-catenin activates the Notch signaling pathway. GSK3β phosphorylates NICD and activates
  Notch signaling, while Notch degrades β-catenin and negatively regulates its stability.
  As for the Hedgehog pathway, Wnt inhibits it by Gli3. The expression of ligands
  and components, such as Wnts, LRP5, Axin, BMP2, and TGF-β, is determined by TGF-β/BMP
  signaling and Wnt signaling, and these two signaling pathways are connected by the
  interaction between Smad7 and Axin
