  at 12 . Log2 ratios for average microarray-based expression in  and  were loaded
  into MapMan to generate the overview. Each square represents an at least 2-fold
  differentially expressed transcript. On the log2 scale ranging between 3 and −3,
  dark blue color represents 8-fold or more expression in  seeds while dark red color
  signifies 8-fold or more expression in . CHO, Carbohydrate; OPP, oxidative pentose
  phosphate pathway.
