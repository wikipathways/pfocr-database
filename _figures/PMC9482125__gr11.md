caption: 'Modulation of the CyR61 pathway by endogenously produced 3-MST related H2S/polysulfides.
  Modulation of the CyR61 pathway by endogenously produced H2S/polysulfides: a working
  hypothesis. A: Endogenous, 3-MST-derived H2S and H2Sn biosynthesis in cancer cells
  induces Sp1 sulfhydration, S1PR activation and induces the p38MAPK signaling pathway
  through ATF1 and CREB activation, leading to increased levels of CyR61 mRNA and
  CyR61 protein. B: The reduction of H2S and H2Sn biosynthesis, achieved by a pharmacological
  3-MST inhibitor, suppresses this pathway. The reduction of ATF1 mRNA and protein
  levels after inhibition of 3-MST inhibition leads to Cyclin D1 downregulation, promoting
  cell cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis. Although inhibition of H2S and H2Sn biosynthesis
  suppresses CyR61 mRNA, this effect is not always reflected in a decrease in cell-associated
  CyR61 protein levels, which show a heterogeneous response (an increase in HCT116 cells
  and a decrease in HT-29 and LoVo cells). This is likely due to the combination of
  two effects: (a) after 3-MST inhibition, there is an increase of RhoA proteins in
  the cells, which can stabilize CyR61 mRNA and protein and (b) 3-MST inhibition produces
  a blockade of CyR61 secretion, thereby retaining some of this protein in the cell-associated
  fraction. The latter effect is likely related to the suppression of Snail and Caveolin-1,
  which have a known role in the stimulation of CyR61 secretion in cancer cells. The
  decrease of Caveolin-1, CyR61 secretion and Shh, contribute to the decreased HCT116
  migration demonstrated in our previous study []. Finally, when CyR61 is retained
  in the cell, it plays a role as an anti-apoptotic factor.'
