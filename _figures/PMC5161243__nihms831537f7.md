caption: (A) GIPR is recycled constitutively by the fast TR recycling pathway (black
  arrows). Upon GIP stimulation, the GIPR is sorted to the slower TGN pathway (blue
  arrows). This redistribution of recycling pathways results in a dynamic reduction
  of GIPR from the plasma membrane. The redistribution of GIPR from TR to TGN pathway
  is regulated by β-arrestin2 (βA2) binding, which in turn is recruited in response
  to ligand binding and GRK mediated phosphorylation.(B) Downregulation of the GIPR-354Gln
  variant is by a similar dynamic sequestration mechanism, requiring GIP stimulation
  and βA2 targeting of the variant from the TR to the TGN recycling pathway. However,
  βA2 binding to the variant is independent of GRK phosphorylation.
