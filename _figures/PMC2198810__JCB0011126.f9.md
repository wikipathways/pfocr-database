caption: Proposed involvement of PIP2 in stress-fiber assembly. The model is adapted
  from  and , and incorporates the finding that generation of a particular actin structure
  reflects the antagonistic as well as cooperative influences of multiple inputs.
  PIP5KI is regulated by multiple mechanisms. In this diagram, we focus on the Rho
  pathway, and show that the increase in PIP2synthesis after PIP5KI overexpression
  is at least partly mediated through ROCK, because the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 decreases
  PIP2 accumulation in cells. Our data suggest that inhibition may be due to a decrease
  in PI4P synthesis, although this is not yet established conclusively (?). The inhibitors
  used, and their sites of action, are indicated. The effect of PIP5KI overexpression
  on ADF/cofilin function was not determined, and hence the potential involvement
  of ADF/cofilin is denoted by a question mark. (Two-headed arrows) Reciprocal antagonistic
  actions, (black arrow) activation. The bar at the end of dashed line indicates inhibition
  after PIP5KI overexpression in CV1 cells. The dominance of signals to generate stress
  fibers in CV1 decreases the ability of the cells to ruffle their membrane, to form
  thin actin fibers, and to form actin comets.
