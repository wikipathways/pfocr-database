caption: Role of Rho/ROCK in the etiology of insulin resistance. Experimental evidence
  in cultured cells and mice show conflicting results, between different models, for
  the effect of Rho/ROCK on insulin sensitivity. While ROCK phosphorylation of IRS-1
  at Ser307 negatively impacts insulin signaling (left), ROCK phosphorylation of IRS-1
  at Ser632/635 enhances insulin signaling (right). IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate
  1.
