caption: Single-strand annealing (SSA) is a DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair (DSBR)
  system which uses homologous repeats flanking a DSB. Therefore, SSA is a pathway
  in the homology-directed repair (HDR), which includes homologous recombination repair
  (HRR), synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), and break-induced recombination
  (BIR). The other group of DSBR pathways, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), in its
  canonical form (C-NHEJ) is independent of homology, but its backup variant (B-NHEJ)
  uses microhomology (2-4 bp), taking the form of microhomology-mediated end joining
  (MMEJ). HDR and MMEJ, in contrary to C-NHEJ, require DNA end resection to expose
  3′ single-stranded DNA fragments. These fragments may undergo further, extensive
  resection and invade double-stranded DNA (Donor), which provides a template DNA
  as in HRR, SDSA, and BIR when active RAD51 (RAD51 Double Strand Break Repair Protein)
  is present. When there is no active RAD51 or, despite its presence, no donor DNA,
  3′ ss overhangs produced in the end resection process may be a substrate for SSA.
  After initial resection B-NHEJ may occur, especially when short homologous sequences
  are located near the DSB (MMEJ).
