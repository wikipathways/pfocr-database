caption: Parkinson's disease (PD)-related gene pathway in response to MG132 (A), methylmercury
  (MeHg, B), and cadmium (Cd, C) in MEF cells. PD pathway was modified from KEGG in
  GenMAPP program. Differential gene expression was based on treatment versus control
  expression change (1.5-fold and p ≤ 0.05, t-test). All the treatments upregulate
  the deubiquitination enzyme gene Uchl1 and downregulated Ube2c and 270084L22Rik
  genes. Cd induced significant upregulation of Snca gene, which produce α-synclein
  protein, Sncaip, and MAPT genes.
