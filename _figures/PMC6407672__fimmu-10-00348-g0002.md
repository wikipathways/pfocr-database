caption: Estradiol signaling. Estradiol (E2) can bind to its different receptors to
  activate the genomic pathway or the non-genomic pathways. In the first one, E2 binding
  to ERα and ERβ, each complex is directed to the nucleus where it joins with EREs
  in the DNA, recruiting different transcription factors (TF), co-activators (CA),
  or co-repressors (CR) in order to activate or suppress the transcription of target
  genes. In the non-genomic pathway, E2 binds to GPR30, triggering the activation
  of G proteins. The above turns out in the increase of different second messengers
  (cAMP, Ca2+, DAG). Additionally, E2 can activate different growth factor receptor
  (GFR) activity through the non-genomic pathway, which results in the activation
  of different downstream signaling pathways (MAPK and PI3K) and in the release of
  different ligands of GFRs.
