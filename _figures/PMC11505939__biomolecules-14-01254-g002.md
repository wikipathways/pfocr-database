caption: Signals from the gut traveling along the gut–microbiota–brain axis in healthy
  versus diseased states. In healthy states (left), the body maintains everything
  in balance, including the microbiome, metabolites, hormones, cytokines, etc. Following
  intestinal injury disease (right), this balance is disturbed on all levels in the
  gut–microbiota–brain axis. First, the microbiome changes its composition and has
  decreased microbial diversity. Changing the bacterial composition of the microbiota
  then affects the metabolites it releases; gram-negative bacteria tend to release
  lipopolysaccharide (dark blue, large), which can lead to intestinal damage, immune
  activation, and sepsis. Beneficial microbial metabolites that promote neurodevelopment,
  like short-chain fatty acids (light blue, small), are released in lesser quantities.
  Microbial metabolites also directly influence and perturb balanced hormone (green)
  release by enteroendocrine cells. Damaged intestinal epithelial cells (light and
  dark brown) will lose their tight junction integrity and have increased mucosal
  permeability (yellow caution triangle). The peripheral nervous system, and specifically
  the vagus nerve, is activated in response to intestinal damage and is a direct signaling
  pathway to the brain. Gut damage, as well as microbial metabolites like lipopolysaccharide,
  also activates the immune system, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (dark red, large), disturbing the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory (light
  red, small) signals. These mediators travel systemically and can bypass the blood–brain
  barrier, especially when the brain is immature. During early human development,
  the brain is particularly vulnerable to these imbalances, resulting in long-term
  neurodevelopmental and cognitive deficits when these harmful signals interact with
  cells (oligodendrocyte-green, astrocyte-purple, neuron-pink, microglia-yellow) and
  the blood–brain barrier. Amongst pediatric diseases, prematurity with nutritional
  imbalances and necrotizing enterocolitis are poignant examples of how gut injury
  alters the microbiome and leads to negative systemic imbalances that severely impact
  neurodevelopment. Created in BioRender. Sha, C. (2024) BioRender.com/r60o312
