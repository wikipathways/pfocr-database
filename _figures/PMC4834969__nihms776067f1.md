caption: Shown is a scheme of the biosynthetic pathway for Moco biosynthesis in bacteria
  and the proteins involved in this pathway (which were mainly identified by studies
  using the E. coli proteins). Mo-MPT is formed from 5′GTP with cPMP, MPT and MPT-AMP
  as intermediates. The first reaction involves an FeS cluster containing protein
  (schematically the MoaA protein is shown containing two 4Fe4S clusters). Mo-MPT
  can be further modified by formation of an bis-Mo-MPT intermediate, and further
  addition of a GMP molecule to each MPT unit, forming the bis-MGD cofactor. Both
  reactions are catalyzed by the MobA protein. Bis-MGD can be further modified by
  the addition of a sulfido-ligand at the Mo-active site, a reaction catalyzed by
  the L-cysteine desulfurase IscS. Alternatively, Mo-MPT is modified by the addition
  of CMP to form the MCD form of the cofactor. Here, a terminal sulfur ligand is added
  to the molybdenum site, generating sulfurated MCD, a reaction catalyzed by the L-cysteine
  desulfurase IscS. The names of the proteins involved in the reactions are colored
  in red, nucleotides required and molybdate are colored in blue.
