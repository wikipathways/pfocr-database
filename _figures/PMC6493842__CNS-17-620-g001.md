caption: Schematic representation of central histaminergic components. In the adult
  vertebrate brain, histamine (HA) is formed in histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary
  nucleus (TMN) of the posterior hypothalamus from l‐histidine through one‐step catalytic
  action of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) (1). HA is stored in presynaptic secretory
  vesicles (2), and released into the extracellular space (3) to activate four subtypes
  of postsynaptic G protein (G)‐coupled receptors (4) designated H1 to H4, thus eliciting
  a variety of physiological responses as indicated in the figure. Activation of postsynaptic
  H1 receptors has been associated with enhanced vigilance and attention and decreased
  feeding, while stimulation of the postsynaptic H2 receptors has been linked to enhanced
  working memory [18]. Binding to postsynaptic H3 and, possibly, H4 receptors leads
  to as yet poorly defined actions (?), which are currently undergoing rigorous investigation.
  Stimulation of presynaptic H3 autoreceptors (5) inhibits (‐) HA synthesis (1) and/or
  release (3), while HA binding to presynaptic H3 receptors on nonhistaminergic neurons
  (6) inhibits the release of a number of neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine
  (ACh), dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA), serotonin (5‐HT), and others in a pathway‐dependent
  manner. HA is inactivated (7) predominantly by methylation through neuronal histamine
  N‐methyltransferase (HNMT), without excluding the contribution of diamine oxidase
  (DAO) as a salvage pathway to produce imidazole acetic acid, a γ‐aminobutyric acid
  (GABA)A receptor agonist. Additional sources of brain HA may include (hypothalamic)
  mast cells and other nonneuronal components [cf. 3].
