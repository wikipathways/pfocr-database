caption: Summary model of rAdV-sensing cascades in RAW 264.7 cell line. Following
  endosomal entry of rAdV into the cell, viral DNA can trigger the TLR9 pathway, which,
  through the MyD88 adaptor protein, leads to activation of IRF7 and IRF5 but not
  IRF3. Alternatively, adenovirus escapes the endosomal compartment, revealing virus
  and viral DNA complexes to the cytosolic compartment. In RAW 264.7 cells, an array
  of DNA sensors are potentially available to bind viral DNA. Depending on the complexes
  formed, DNA sensor complexes engage STING (MITA) either directly or indirectly,
  leading to TBK1 activation and phosphorylation of IRF3. IRF3 dimerizes and translocates
  to the nucleus, where it associates with transcription units (IFN-β or ISG56). In
  collaboration with additional transcription factors (NF-κB, ATF/cJUN), gene expression
  is induced. AIM2 and p204 are Hin-200 proteins that have been shown to complex with
  ASC through Pyrin domains to form an inflammasome complex, leading to IL-1/IL-18
  secrestion. DNA template either in the cytosol or in the nucleus can be transcribed
  by RNA polymerase II (not depicted) and RNA polymerase III. Small viral RNAs have
  been implicated in stimulating the antiviral response through activation of RNA
  sensors (MDA-5, RIG-I), which in turn complex with IPS (MAVS) and activate TBK1.
  RIG-I has also been shown to complex with ASC to form an inflammasome complex.
