caption: 'External signals including antigen, costimulation, nutrients, cytokines
  and metabolic cues converge upon PI3K signaling pathway that results in the phosphorylation
  and activation of Akt (threonine 308) leading to further downstream activation of
  two distinct mTOR containing signaling complexes namely mTORC1 and mTORC2. In activated
  T effector cells, mTORC1 activation leads to increase in protein translation and
  activation of transcription factors (TFs) such as c-myc and HIF1α that in turn initiate
  the glycolytic and glutamine metabolic pathways. Concomitantly, mTORC2 phosphorylates
  Akt (serine 473), an event that phosphorylates FOXO family of TFs excluding them
  from nucleus and preventing the induction of Treg genetic program. In Tregs, however,
  reduced PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling results in nuclear localization of FOXOs and initiation
  of Treg genetic program as well as promotion of FAO through LKB1/AMPK signaling
  axis that inhibits mTOR via TSC1/2 complexes. Furthermore sirtuins (Sirt), a family
  of NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [oxidized]) dependent deacetylases that
  sense changes in NAD+ [oxidized]) /NADH [reduced] redox ratio in cells, deacetylate
  Foxp3 and target it to proteosomal degradation. The mechanistic actions of various
  inhibitors are shown in black boxes. (Abbreviations: S6K: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase;
