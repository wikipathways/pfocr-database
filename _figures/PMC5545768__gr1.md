caption: Schematic representation of oxysterols-induced ER stress on endothelial cells.
  At least three major signaling are involved in the UPR activation. Oxysterols may
  alter the lipid membrane composition and oxidize SERCA channels. Oxysterols are
  activators of SREBPs which are synthetized and located on the ER membrane and can
  modulate the activity of LXR. This last pathway can differently affects the ER status.
