caption: Model showing how PRRSV utilizes viral apoptotic mimicry and TIM-induced
  macropinocytosis as an alternative pathway to infect host cells. In addition to
  CME, TIM-1/4 recognizes PRRSV as apoptotic mimicry and induces macropinocytosis
  via the Rac1/Cdc42-Pak1 signaling pathway. PRRSV enters SNX5-macropinosomes via
  macropinocytosis as an alternative pathway, where CD163 functions as an indispensable
  receptor.
