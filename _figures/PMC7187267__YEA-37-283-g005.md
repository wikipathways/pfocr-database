caption: pABA and myo‐inositol de novo synthesis pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
  (a) The genes ABZ1 and ABZ2 code for a two‐step pathway producing pABA from chorismate
  via the intermediate 4‐amino‐4‐deoxychorismate. Chorismate is synthesized from erythrose‐4‐phosphate
  and phosphoenolpyruvate via the shikimate pathway. In addition to being precursor
  for pABA biosynthesis, chorismate also serves as precursor for tryptophan, phenylalanine
  and tyrosine biosynthesis. (b) myo‐Inositol is formed from glucose‐6‐phosphate via
  Ino1 yielding L‐myo‐inositol‐1‐phosphate, which is in a second step converted to
  myo‐inositol by Inm1 or Inm2. INO2, INO4 genes encode INO1 transcriptional activators
  while OPI1 encodes the antagonist regulator of the gene encoding the initial step
  of inositol synthesis. Metabolites, proteins, positive regulators, and positive
  regulators are shown in bold, blue, green, and red, respectively. pABA, para‐Aminobenzoic
  acid [Colour figure can be viewed at http://wileyonlinelibrary.com]
