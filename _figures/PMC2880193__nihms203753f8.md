caption: The oxidative conversion of proline to glutamate involves two enzymes, a
  flavin dependent proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and a NAD+-dependent Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  (P5C) dehydrogenase (P5CDH). PRODH and P5CDH help organisms respond to changes in
  the nutritional environment by initiating the breakdown of proline as a source for
  nitrogen, carbon, and energy [–]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Put1p and Put2p are
  the corresponding PRODH and P5CDH enzymes, respectively () []. In yeast and other
  eukaryotes, PRODH and P5CDH are localized in the mitochondria [, ]. PRODH catalyzes
  the first step of proline oxidation by generating P5C, an intermediate in the proline
  catabolic pathway (see ). The reaction involves two phases or two half-reactions.
  In the reductive half-reaction electrons are transferred from proline to the flavin
  adenine dinucleotide cofactor to form P5C. The second phase (i.e., oxidative half-reaction)
  of the catalytic cycle involves oxidation of reduced flavin (FADH2) to regenerate
  FAD. P5C is then hydrolyzed to γ-glutamic acid semialdehyde (GSA) which is subsequently
  oxidized by P5CDH to form glutamate and NADH.
