caption: 'Model for the two nucleotide excision repair pathways in E. coli: general
  global repair (GGR) and transcription-coupled repair (TCR). UV light induces thymine
  dimers in DNA which are either directly recognized by UvrA2B in the GGR pathway
  or indirectly recognized by RNA polymerase (RNAP) in the TCR pathway. Elongating
  RNAP stalls when it encounters a dimer in the template strand and recruits the mutation
  frequency decline (Mfd) translocase, which, in turn, removes RNAP while recruiting
  UvrA2B. The two pathways then converge after these initial damage-recognition steps,
  and UvrA2 dissociates, leaving a stable preincision complex consisting of UvrB bound
  to damaged DNA, which now has an altered structure. UvrC is recruited to generate
  the coupled dual incisions, and UvrD removes UvrC and the damaged oligonucleotide.
  Repair is completed by synthesis and ligation of the repair patch by DNA polymerase
  I (PolI) and DNA ligase, respectively.'
