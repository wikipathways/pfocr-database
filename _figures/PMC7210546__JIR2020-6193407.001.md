caption: 'TLRs and signaling molecules on the basis of literatures. The majority of
  TLRs seem to function as a homodimer, but TLR2 forms a heterodimer with TLR1 or
  TLR6. TLR signaling consists of two distinct pathways: the MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent
  cascades. TLR4 can activate both MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways.
  TLR3 in the endosome recruits TRIF and mediates the MyD88-independent pathway. The
  engagement of TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 in the endosome membrane leads to the formation
  of a complex that consists of MyD88 and IRAK. TLR2, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 can only
  activate MyD88-dependent pathway. LPS, lipopolysaccharides; dsRNA, double-stranded
