caption: Model of MB neurogenesis regulated by the ecdysone-induced miRNA let-7. Temporal
  cues such as systemic steroid signalling via the differentially expressed let-7
  miRNA regulate a spatially distributed target Abrupt to adjust cell adhesion. During
  prepupal stages, a cell fate intrinsic determinant Ab is present in the nuclei of
  early-born α′/β′ neurons. At the pupal stage, the chronologically regulated pulse
  of ecdysteroids induces let-7 expression. let-7 targets the transcription factor
  Ab and modulates levels of the cell adhesion molecule Fas II. Since cell adhesion
  is a critical characteristic of neuronal identity, regulation of cell adhesion levels
  allows for MB neuron differentiation. Therefore, cell adhesiveness regulated by
  the ecdysone-let-7 pathway is important for an establishment of neuronal temporal
  identity.

  description: Model of MB neurogenesis regulated by the ecdysone-induced miRNA let-7.
    Temporal cues such as systemic steroid signalling via the differentially expressed
    let-7 miRNA regulate a spatially distributed target Abrupt to adjust cell adhesion.
    During prepupal stages, a cell fate intrinsic determinant Ab is present in the
    nuclei of early-born α′/β′ neurons. At the pupal stage, the chronologically regulated
    pulse of ecdysteroids induces let-7 expression. let-7 targets the transcription
    factor Ab and modulates levels of the cell adhesion molecule Fas II. Since cell
    adhesion is a critical characteristic of neuronal identity, regulation of cell
    adhesion levels allows for MB neuron differentiation. Therefore, cell adhesiveness
    regulated by the ecdysone-let-7 pathway is important for an establishment of neuronal
    temporal identity.
