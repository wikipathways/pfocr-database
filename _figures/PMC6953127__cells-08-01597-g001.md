caption: The process and mechanism of autophagy signals that activate the autophagic
  process (initiation) typically originate from various conditions of stress, such
  as starvation, hypoxia, oxidative stress, protein aggregation, endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress and others. The common target of these signaling pathways is the uncoordinated
  51-like kinase (ULK) complex (consisting of ULK1/2, ATG13, FIP200 and ATG101) and
  cause ULK complex translocate to a domain of ER. Upon entry into the ER, the ULK
  complex initiates nucleation of the phagophore by phosphorylating the class III
  PI3K complex I (consisting of Beclin-1, PIK3C3/VPS34, PIK3R4/p150, AMBRA1 and ATG14/Barkor).
  At present, the source of membranes involved in the formation of phagophore remains
  unclear, possibly ER, mitochondria, Golgi and plasma membrane. After phagophore
  formation, it will expand and separate damaged organelles (including ER, ribosomes
  and mitochondria, etc.) and misfolded proteins. As the phagophore expands, the membrane
  bends, eventually forming a bilayer membrane structure-autophagosome. The ATG12-ATG5-ATg16L1
  complex and the LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugate play an important role
  during phagophore elongation and closure. Finally, autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes
  to form autophagosomes and the cargo in autophagosomes is degraded by acid hydrolases
  in lysosomes. In addition, the nutrients produced by the degradation are released
  back to the cytoplasm and reused by the cells.
