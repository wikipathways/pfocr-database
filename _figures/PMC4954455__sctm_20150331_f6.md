caption: 'A working model of the molecular mechanisms of HDACi (e.g., abexinostat)
  on human skeletal (mesenchymal) stem cell differentiation into adipocytes and osteoblasts.
  (A): In early adipogenesis, the synergistic interaction of KLF15 and CEBPA induces
  the expression of PPARγ. PPARγ in turn interacts with CEBPA to produce FABP4 and
  AdipoQ genes involved in the expression of mature adipocyte phenotype. (B): HDACi-induced
  conical WNT signaling pathway. WNT interacts with LRP/FZD receptor complexes, which
  leads to stabilization and increases in the intracellular levels of β-catenin; the
  latter, in turn, translocates into nucleus and forms a complex with TCF/LEF, inducing
  osteogenic gene transcription (details are provided in main text). ∗, genes identified
  from the chromatin immunoprecipitation for H3K9Ac combined with high-throughput
  DNA sequencing data; $, genes identified from the gene expression microarray data.
  Abbreviations: BMAD, bone marrow adipocyte; HDACi, histone deacetylase inhibitors.'
