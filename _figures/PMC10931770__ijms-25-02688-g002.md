caption: Positive and negative regulation of osteoclast differentiation. Initially,
  osteoclast precursors are located in the periosteal vasculature due to high concentrations
  of S1P. Subsequently, they migrate into the bone cavity in response to varying S1P
  concentrations and chemokines such as CXCL12 and CX3CL1. Upon reaching their destination,
  the osteoclast precursors differentiate and mature under the influence of pro-osteoclast
  genesis factors, including RANKL. (A) RANKL binds to RANK receptors expressed by
  osteoclast precursors, forming complexes with TRAF6, TAB1, and TAB2. This interaction
  activates TAK1 and triggers MAPKs and NF-κB cascade signaling. Consequently, activated
  c-Fos induces the expression of NFATc1. NFATc1 then binds to AP-1, CREB, PU.1, and
  other targets, including its own promoter, leading to the transcription of various
  osteoclast-specific genes (such as Ctsk, MMP9, etc.), creating a self-induced closed
  loop. NFATc1 also induces the transcriptional repressor BLIMP1, which inhibits the
  generation of anti-osteoclast genes like Irf8, Bcl6, and Mafb. CaMKIV-CREB signaling,
  PPARγ, PGC1β, and C/EBPα signaling can synergize with NF-κB signaling to induce
  c-Fos and consequently promote NFATc1 expression. Additionally, SEMA6D enhances
  osteoclast formation by activating ITAM signaling, followed by CaMKIV-CREB signaling,
  through the formation of the Plexin-A1-TREM2-dap12 complex. (B) OPG competes with
  RANKL for binding to RANK, thereby blocking the signals triggered by RANKL in the
  positive regulatory pathway described above. Notably, Irf8 and Bcl6 directly interact
  with and inhibit the expression of NFATc1. Furthermore, other transcription factors
  including ATF4, LRF, and Jdp2 negatively regulate NFATc1. Pax5 inhibits BLIMP1 expression,
  FcγRIIB inhibits ITAM signaling, and the SEMA3A-nrp1 axis restricts ITAM signaling
  by segregating Plexin-A1 from TREM2. Additionally, miR-34a acts as a negative regulator
  of osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting NF-κB signaling. Another receptor for
  RANKL, lGR4, functions similarly to OPG in blocking RANKL signals
