caption: Overview of RAGE signaling pathways. RAGE ligands induce a variety of signaling
  cascades, which lead to upregulation of inflammation and cellular mechanics. The
  PI3K/Akt and the Src/RhoA pathways may signal through mDia1 to increase NFκB and
  Egr-1 induced transcription. Downstream signaling of RAGE also includes the JAK/STAT
  and MAPK/Erk pathways, which also lead to upregulation of NFκB and Egr-1 and other
  transcriptional mechanisms. NFκB transcribed genes upregulate inflammation, and
  Egr-1 transcribed genes are involved in cell structure, motility, and adhesion and
  in tissue injury.
