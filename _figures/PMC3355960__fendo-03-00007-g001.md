caption: A schematic representation of the cross-talk between extracellular and intracellular
  progesterone signaling pathways in female reproductive behavior. Classical mechanism
  of action by progesterone- and ring-A class of progestins, mediated by nuclear PRs,
  promotes interactions with coactivators, and plays a predominant role. Progesterone
  effects mediated by second messengers (cAMP, cGMP) and extranuclear signaling kinases
  (PKA, PKC, CaMKII), activates MAPK signal transduction cascade, phosphorylation
  of nuclear transcription factors (TFs), PRs/PR coactivators, and CREB. Progesterone
  and progestins, act via the Src kinase, interact with extranuclear PRs to activate
  MAPK cascade. Progesterone acting via the extranuclear PKA/MAPK/DARPP-32 pathway
  can cause a decrease in phosphatase activity and an increase in phosphorylation
  of PR and/or its coactivators. Mating stimuli (VCS) and dopamine D1 agonist can
  stimulate PKA activation. D1 agonist-stimulated PKA-mediated pathway phosphorylates
  DARPP-32, which inhibits PP1, leading to the activation of CREB/PR/coactivators.
  VCS-stimulated PKA activation can also interact with MAPK cascade. Neuropeptides,
  nucleotides, GnRH, and PGE2 can act through various receptor- and/or second messengers
  (cAMP, cGMP, NO) and transmit signals to the nuclear PRs or other TFs. Interactions
  between the signal transduction pathways may serve as an amplification mechanism
  to converge on nuclear TFs and/or coactivators to regulate gene transcription and
  translation to facilitate female reproductive behavior.
