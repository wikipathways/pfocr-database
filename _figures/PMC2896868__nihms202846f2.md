caption: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) signal through proximal adaptors. TLR2 (+1 or
  6), TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 signal through MyD88 and the interleukin-1
  receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) complex to activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
  and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways, leading to the expression of
  a broad set of genes involved in inflammatory responses. For TLR2 and TLR4, the
  Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter protein (TIRAP) is required
  for efficient and complete activation of this MyD88-dependent pathway. TLR7, TLR8,
  and TLR9 also activate IRF7 in a MyD88-dependent fashion leading to the expression
  of interferon-β(IFN-β) and type I IFN-associated genes. TLR3 signals through TIR
  domain-containing adapter-inducing IFN-β (TRIF), which activates the type I IFN
  response through IRF3 and also can activate NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways through
  receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1). TLR4 also engages the TRIF pathway and this
  is facilitated by TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM). The TLRs that can activate
  type I IFN responses are shaded gray. Several negative regulator of TLR signaling
  are shown in black. Single Ig interleukin-1 receptor-related molecule (SIGIRR) is
  a TIR domain containing cell surface molecule that is believed to compete with TLRs
  for MyD88. IRAKM inhibits activation of the IRAK complex. TNFAIP3 inactivates TRAF6,
  blocking activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases. Activating transcription factor 3
  (ATF3) binds to the promoters of some TLR-regulated genes and alters chromatin structure
  to affect gene expression.
