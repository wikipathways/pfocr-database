caption: 'Schematic showing some of the major centers in the auditory pathway and
  areas in the CNS showing increased FC with the auditory cortex (ACx). Black lines
  show the neural transmission path from the cochlea through the cochlear nucleus
  (CN), inferior colliculus (IC), medial geniculate body (MGB), and ACx; black double-line
  reflects SS-induced increases in ALFF and/or increased FC. SS increased ALFF response
  magnitudes and FC in a central auditory subnetwork (gray shaded area) comprised
  of the IC, MGB, and AC. The AC serves as a major hub with side branches to the amygdala
  (AMY), reticular nuclei (RN), and parafloccular lobe (PFL) and cerebellar lobules
  4 (CB4); these side branch regions contribute to the emotional, motoric, and conscious
  awareness of tinnitus and/or hyperacusis. Enhanced activity in the MGB and IC combined
  with the increased FC of these auditory structures with the hippocampus (HIP) could
  facilitate tinnitus memory storage or retrieval or assign spatial location to phantom
  or real sounds.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06576.010'
