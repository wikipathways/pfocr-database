caption: Notch signaling is initiated through binding of Notch ligands expressed an
  adjacent cell, followed by enzymatic cleavage and release of intercellular of Notch
  (ICN). The ICN then translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to CSL transcription
  repressor and converts it to activator by recruiting MAML (mastermind-like protein)
  to the complex including p300 and co-activator. Notch signaling is also regulated
  by other cellular proteins including Deltex, Nrarp (Notch-regulated ankyrin-repeat
  protein) and MINT (Msx2-interacting nuclear target protein).
