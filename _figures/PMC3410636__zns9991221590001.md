caption: Schematic illustration depicting a proposed effect of MeCP2 overexpression.
  In this model, MeCP2 participates in the REST pathway to repress gene expression
  of GluA2 subunits (green). Decreased expression of GluA2 results in an increase
  in the proportion of AMPA receptors lacking this subunit (indicated here by all-blue
  receptors), which can lead to deficits in LTP (1) and increased calcium-mediated
  apoptosis (2).
