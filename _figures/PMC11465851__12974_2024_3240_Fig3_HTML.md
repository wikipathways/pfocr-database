caption: 'Pattern recognition receptors on ependymal cells are involved in inflammatory
  signaling The TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway induces the release of inflammatory
  cytokines like IL-1β and TNF-α, while promoting phagocytic apoptosis. This mediates
  persistent brain inflammation and neurological tissue damage. Activation of NF-κB
  and pro-inflammatory mediators facilitates macrophage recruitment and inhibits ependymal
  ciliogenesis. NF-κB-independent IKK2 can stabilize Foxj1, while some viruses such
  as HSV-1 and growth factors can inhibit IKK, which in turn strongly induces Foxj1
  degradation and subsequently leads to hydrocephalus. Besides, unmethylated CpG in
  bacteria relies on TLR9 signaling to mediate damage and induce ependymal destruction.
  LPS: lipopolysaccharide; TLR: toll-like receptor; PACAP: Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating
  polypeptide; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa B; IKK: inhibitor of kappa B kinase'
