caption: 'Bile acids stimulate D2 expression in brown adipocytes. Schematic representation
  of the bile acid-TGR5–D2 pathway in brown adipocytes. Bile acids in the general
  circulation derived from the enterohepatic circulation potentially may stimulate
  TGR5 increasing cAMP, and thus leading to an increase in D2 expression in tissues
  where both proteins are coexpressed, e.g., BAT and skeletal muscle. This pathway
  has been shown to increase energy expenditure and protect against diet-induced obesity
  in mice (). [Reproduced in part with permission from Baxter and Webb: Nature 439:402–403,
