caption: Schematic representation of the coagulation system and sites of action of
  new oral anticoagulants. The coagulation response is triggered by tissue damage
  and exposure of components of the extracellular matrix, including collagen and tissue
  factor, which will activate factor VII and form a complex that triggers the activation
  of factors × and IX. This initiation phase will be rapidly inactivated by the tissue
  factor pathway inhibitor. The generation of small amounts of thrombin from prothrombin
  by the initial activation of factor × will in turn activate factor XI and the non-enzymatic
  factors VIII and V, resulting in a rapid amplification of the coagulation response
  with the subsequent generation of large quantities of thrombin and the subsequent
  conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. The steps of the coagulation system that are
  affected by the new anticoagulant drugs are shown in boxes. Roman numerals indicate
  coagulation factors; a subindex 'a' indicates an activated coagulation factor. TF,
  tissue factor.
