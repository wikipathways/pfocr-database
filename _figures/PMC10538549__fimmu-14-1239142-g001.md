caption: Overview of the cGAS-STING pathway. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator
  of interferon genes (STING) pathway is involved in multiple biological processes.
  Cytoplasmic cGAS can recognize exogenous and endogenous double-strand DNA (dsDNA)
  from various sources, including DNA viruses, reverse-transcription of RNA viruses,
  bacteria, parasites, cell debris, extracellular vesicles (EVs), as well as the damaged
  mitochondria- and self-DNA from the nucleus. Interferon-gamma inducible protein
  16 (IFI16) directly interacts with cytosolic dsDNA, cGAS and STING, facilitating
  the activation of cGAS and STING. Activated cGAS then catalyzes the synthesis of
  the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) from ATP and GTP. Cyclic dinucleotides
  (CDNs) of bacteria, cGAMP or dsDNA binds to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-located STING
  that is retained by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and initiates STING translocation
  to the Golgi apparatus via coat protein complex II (COPII) and ER-Golgi intermediate
  compartment (ERGIC). Then STING recruits and phosphorylates TBK1 and IRF3 and simultaneously
  activates IΚB kinase (IKK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription
  6 (STAT6), triggering the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines, antiviral
  chemokines, IFN-stimulated genes and Type I IFN. In parallel, some cGAMP can be
  delivered to the outside of cells through the GAP junction, binding with the plasmatic
  membrane (pmSTING) and driving the same activation response or enter other cells
  through solute carrier family 19 member 1 (SLC19A1) and SLC46A2. The rest of cGAMP
  can be degraded by membrane hydrolase ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase
  1 (ENPP1). Post-Golgi STING vesicles are either fused or encapsulated by lysosomes
  and gradually eliminated. After type I IFN and cytokines (e.g. IL-6) are secreted
  outside, they can bind to IFN receptor and cytokine receptor (e.g. IL-6R/GP130)
  on the membrane respectively and then activate Janus kinases (JAK)-STAT signaling
  pathway. Created with BioRender.com.
