caption: Under this model, when tissue O2 levels fall, O2 is released from haemoglobin
  contained within circulating erythrocytes. The fall in haemoglobin oxygen saturation
  results in a conformational change in haemoglobin and subsequent activation of the
  heterotrimeric G-protein, Gi. In this pathway activation of Gi stimulates adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) activity resulting in increases in 3′5′-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),
  activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR). The final conduit for ATP release in response to exposure to low
  O2 is pannexin 1. The cAMP required for ATP release is hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterase
  3 (PDE3B). Released ATP binds to purinergic receptors (PR) on the endothelium (Endo)
  stimulating production of vasodilators that cause both local relaxation of vascular
  smooth muscle (SMC) and dilation that is conducted to upstream resistance vessels.
  (+) = activation.
