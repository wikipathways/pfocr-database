caption: 'Model of R3/R4 signaling events leading to aos upregulation in R4. (a) Schematic
  presentation of ommatidial clusters (with focus on R3/R4) during the OR process,
  which is regulated by Fz/PCP, Notch and EGFR signaling. (b) Model of intercellular
  signaling events in the R3 and R4 cells, leading to the transcriptional upregulation
  of aos in R4. Fz/PCP signaling within the R3/R4 pair leads to transcriptional activation
  of Dl in R3, which in turn activates Notch signaling in R4. The activated Notch
  pathway in R4 has two functions: (1) it specifies the cell as R4, and (2) it upregulates
  aos transcription to coordinate EGFR-mediated regulation of the OR process.'
