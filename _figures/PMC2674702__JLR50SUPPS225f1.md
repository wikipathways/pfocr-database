caption: 'Metabolism of extracellular and intracellular bioactive lipids. A: LPC is
  metabolized by ATX to LPA, which is converted to MAG by the ecto-activities of the
  LPPs. Production of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) could activate cannabinoid receptors
  (CB1 and CB2). Hydrolysis of 2-AG can produce arachidonate, which can be converted
  to eicosanoids. Lipids that stimulate receptors are shown in red and by dashed arrows.
  A similar pathway occurs with other molecular species of LPC, except that the MAG
  that is formed is not bioactive and will not produce eicosanoids. B: The possible
  formation of bioactive lipids (in red) following activation of PLD1 and PLD2. PA
  also activates sphingosine kinase-1 to produce S1P, as indicated by the dashed line.
  LPP1 may also decrease PLD activity ().'
