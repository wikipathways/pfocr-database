caption: 'Role of BLHs in light, stress and hormone signaling pathways. The composition
  of BLH signal pathway is divided into three parts, which is represented by three
  different colors. Light signals are described in green, stress signals in yellow
  and hormone signals in orange. The main downstream genes and downstream signaling
  pathways are described in rectangular boxes. BLH protein and its interacting proteins
  were described by oval box. Arrows indicate promotion and vertical lines indicate
  repression. Gene prefixes represent different species (At: Arabidopsis thaliana;
  Sl: Solanum lycopersicum; St: Solanum tuberosum; Gh: Gossypium hirsutum; Ps: Medicago
  truncatula; Os: Oryza sativa; Gm: Glycine max L.).'
