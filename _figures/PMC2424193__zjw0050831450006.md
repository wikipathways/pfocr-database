  HSP70 system protein-regulated expression of cytokine connectivity map was created
  using Pathway Architect software by customizing software tools for regulatory pathway
  specific for cytokine regulation. Blue squares, protein-protein interactions; purple
  squares, protein expression; green squares, regulation with positive/negative signs;
  green triangles, transport mechanism of cytokines; red ovals, specific set of HSP70
  system proteins modulated by 4-PBA; blue ovals, multiple cytokines; and yellow ovals,
  receptor-associated factors regulated by 4-PBA-modulated proteins. The entire map
  is documented by 88 literature citations. TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor;
  IKB, inhibitor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells; NFKB, nuclear factor
  of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells; IFNG, interferon γ; STAT3, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3).
