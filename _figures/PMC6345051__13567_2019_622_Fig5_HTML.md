caption: 'Visual representation of molecular interactions in the TSF flock. The network
  was inferred using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA v01-13). The genes in the network
  included those with significantly different abundance between the resistant and
  susceptible lines in the TSF flock in response to a primary Haemonchus contortus
  infection for 3 days. Solid lines imply direct relationships between gene products
  while dotted lines imply indirect interactions. Red: the genes with a significantly
  higher abundance in the Resistant line than in the susceptible line. Green: the
  genes with a significantly lower abundance in the Resistant line than in the susceptible
  line. The degree of changes in gene abundance is represented by the intensity of
  the color.'
