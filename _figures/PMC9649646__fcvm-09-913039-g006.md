caption: Graphic summary. In response to vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic
  change, methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) is dramatically up-regulated and catalyzes
  a global increase in m6A. METTL3 increased the m6A modification of Pi3k mRNA, which
  hindered its degradation and activated the PI3K-AKT pathway, thereby promoting VSMCs
  phenotypic switch and neointimal hyperplasia. Inversely, Mettl3 knockdown reversed
  this facilitated phenotypic switch in VSMCs, as demonstrated by downregulated m6A-dependent
  decay of Pi3k mRNA thus inactivating the PI3K/AKT signal to inhibit VSMCs phenotype
  switching and neointimal hyperplasia. Overall, this study highlights the importance
  of METTL3-mediated m6A in VSMCs phenotype switching and offers a novel perspective
  on targeting METTL3 as a therapeutic option for VSMCs phenotype switching modulated
  pathogenesis, including atherosclerosis and restenosis.
