caption: Implications of PC12 cell microarray/transcriptome analysis for pituitary
  adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) actions, and PACAP-activated signaling
  pathways, in vivo. Depiction of pathways leading to cell survival, neuritogenesis,
  and proliferation/growth arrest in PC12 cells in vitro and in neurons and neuronal
  progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo. Only the portion of the sonic hedgehog signaling
  pathway for cell proliferation through which PACAP modulation is thought to occur
  is shown. Note that both canonical (protein kinase A [PKA] -dependent) and noncanonical
  (cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP] -dependent, PKA-independent) signaling pathways
  may exist separately or together, and that either type of calcium-dependent signaling
  may also coexist with either of these two pathways, depending on cell type. (Adapted
  from Chen et al.)
