caption: Hypothesized tumorigenic pathway consequent to succinate accumulation. C-II
  dysfunction leads to accumulation of the succinate. Excess succinate is transported
  into the cytoplasm where it inhibits prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), thereby inhibiting
  HIF degradation. This leads to constitutive activation of HIF, facilitating increased
  expression of genes commonly associated with tumorigenesis
