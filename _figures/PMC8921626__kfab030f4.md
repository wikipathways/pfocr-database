caption: Pathway overrepresentation analyses in 1,4-DX-exposed mice. Ingenuity pathway
  analyses were conducted on the 65 genes that were differentially expressed in the
  livers of mice exposed to 5000 mg/L 1,4-DX in drinking water for 4 weeks. Pathways
  shown to be enriched included those involved in DNA damage response (p = 8.1E-7)
  and repair (p = 1.0E-2), and hepatocellular carcinoma (p = 2.2E-4). Molecules in
  red have increased expression in 1,4-DX-exposed mice, whereas green molecules are
  decreased. Blue dashed lines indicate a predicted inhibitory effect, whereas orange
  dashed lines indicate predicted activation. Gray lines mean that the effect cannot
  be predicted. The darker the color, the greater the fold change in DEGs between
  1,4-DX-exposed and control mice. PHLDA3; Pleckstrin homology-like domain family
  A member 3, DDIAS; DNA damage-induced apoptosis suppressor, GSTP1; glutathione S-transferase
  pi 1, PPPLR10; protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 10, BTG2; BTG anti-proliferation
  factor, ID1; inhibitor of DNA binding 1, AOX1; aldehyde oxidase 1, CCNG1; cyclin
  G1, UGT1A1; UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1.
