caption: Interleukin (IL)-13 and IL-4 signaling pathway. When the receptor subunits
  IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1 bind to their respective ligands, heterodimerization occurs
  (IL-4Rα-IL-13Rα1 or IL-4Rα-γC), which enhances Janus kinase (JAK) activity. Subsequently,
  signaling molecules such as signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)6,
  STAT3, and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) are phosphorylated and activated. STAT6
  and STAT3 are transcription factors that can initiate transcription of target genes
  including eotaxin-3 and, potentially, periostin. IRS can initiate other pathways
  such as PI3K/Akt and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which can regulate
  survival and proliferation. The function of IL-13Rα2 is unclear but may operate
  as a decoy or inhibitor. *Protein has been linked to EoE.
