caption: A schematic model for the cell cycle- dependent control of the p97/p47 pathway.
  When a cell enters mitosis, p47 comes to the cytoplasm. However, p47 is phosphorylated
  by Cdc2 and its binding to Golgi membranes is inhibited, resulting in the Golgi
  fragmentation. At late mitosis, the p47 is dephosphorylated, and p97/p47 functions
  in membrane fusion for the Golgi reassembly. When a nuclear envelope is formed in
  a daughter cell, p47 is localized to the nucleus and the function of p97/p47 is
  suppressed. See Discussion for details.
papertitle: The localization and phosphorylation of p47 are important for Golgi disassemblyâ€“assembly
  during the cell cycle.
