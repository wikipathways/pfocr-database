caption: The aspartate pathway for lysine biosynthesis and saccharopine pathway for
  lysine catabolism. (A) Schematic representation of the aspartate pathway. Only the
  key biosynthetic steps are represented. Aspartate is converted into β-aspartyl phosphate
  that is used in a serial enzymatic step by steps to produce lysine, threonine, methionine
  and Isoleucine. The aspartate pathway is localized in the plastids and thus lysine
  needs to be transported to the cytosol and other organelles. (B) The core reactions
  of the SACPATH involve the conversion of L-lysine into α-aminoadipate. The first
  two steps of the pathway are catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme LKR/SDH; the LKR
  domain condenses L-lysine and α-ketoglutarate into saccharopine using NADPH as a
  cofactor and the SDH domain hydrolyzes saccharopine into α-aminoadipate semialdehyde
  and glutamate using NAD(P)+ as cofactors. The α-aminoadipate semialdehyde is then
  oxidized into α-aminoadipate by the enzyme AASADH using NAD(P)+ as cofactors.
