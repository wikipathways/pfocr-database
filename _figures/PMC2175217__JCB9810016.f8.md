caption: Model for aggresome formation. Numbers indicate various steps in the aggresome
  biogenesis pathway and are explained in the Discussion. Membrane proteins are cotranslationally
  translocated to the membrane of the ER (1). Some molecules fold to adopt a maturation-competent
  conformation (1a). Others misfold and are dislocated from the ER membrane (2). Some
  proteins may escape the translocation machinery and be delivered directly to the
  cytoplasm (4). Dislocated, ubiquitinated, misfolded protein can either be rapidly
  degraded by cytosolic proteasomes (3) or aggregate (5 and 6). Because aggregates
  are difficult to unfold, they are likely to be slowly degraded by the proteasome
  (7a and 7b). Misfolded, aggregated protein is transported to the MTOC by MT where
  it becomes entangled with collapsed IF (8). In the absence of MT, protein aggregates
  coalesce at dispersed sites throughout the cytoplasm (8a). N, nucleus; Ubn, ubiquitin
  conjugates; +, orientation of MT in the cell.
