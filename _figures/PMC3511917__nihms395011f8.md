caption: The role of the K+ channels. A, top). Schematic diagram of ROMK on the apical
  membrane of the thick ascending loop of Henle. Na+, K+ and Cl− are taken up by NKCC2,
  however, as luminal K+ is low, K+ must be recycled back to the lumen by ROMK. The
  removal K together with the activity of ClC-Kb ensures that the cell maintains a
  transcellular electrical potential, that in turn enables Na absorption by the paracellular
  pathway. Bottom, Disruption of ROMK impairs both the activity of NKCC2 and also
  disrupts the transcellular extracellular electrical potential. Thus, Na+ absorbtion
  is impaired. Note, however, that the phenotype of the ROMK knockout mice is not
  as severe as NKCC2 mutations, suggesting that alternative K+ influx pathways are
  still available. B, top). Schematic diagram of the role of Kir4.1 on the basolateral
  membrane in the distal convoluted tubule. Bottom, Mutations to Kir4.1 impair moment
  of K+ out of the cell
