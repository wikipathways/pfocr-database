caption: Crosstalk between benign non-immune cells and cancer cells. CAFs secret TGF-β
  to promote ECM deposition and blocking TGF-β effectively inhibits this procession.
  Besides, CAFs-derived MMPS contribute to ECM degradation. IL-6 secreted from CAFs
  promotes the release of SOCS3 and various pro-tumor molecules via JAK/STAT, MAPK
  and PI3K pathway. Tumor-derived VEGF promotes EC proliferation and neovascularization.
  Adipocytes release FFAs to supply energy for tumor survival and stored as triglycerides
  and cholesterol esters in tumor cells. Moreover, adipocytes secret IL-6 and leptin
  to enhance tumor invasion and metastasis via PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT3 pathway. CXCL8-derived
  from adipocytes upregulates PD-L1 expression on tumors. Tumor cells release CXCL12
  to attract SCs to the tumor cite by binding to CXCR4/7 and SCs produce IL-6, collectively
  weakening pain signaling. Overproduced Wnt5a promotes the EMT of cancer cells via
  STAT3 signaling pathway. PCs-derived LIF inhibits tumor angiogenesis via Src/P53
  signaling pathway
