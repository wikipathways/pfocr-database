caption: 'Common metabolic pathway motif. Pathways represent synthesis of (a) sphingosine-1-P
  and sphinganine-1-P, (b) oleic and linoleic acids, (c) diacyl glycerol and lysophosphatidyl
  serine. Rectangles represent enzymes present in human metabolism. Enzyme genes with
  altered transcript levels are named. Metabolites are in unboxed text, with signaling
  molecules in bold font. Red and blue colouring respectively denote elevated and
  reduced levels. Arrows denote products/substrates linking enzymes, except at the
  start/end of pathways. Enzymes degrading lysophosphatidyl serine (LPCATs) are generally
  confined to the endoplasmic reticulum. Abbreviations: C16—hexadecanoic acid, CoA—Coenzyme
  A, FA—fatty acyl, P—phosphate, Sph-1-P—sphingosine-1-phosphate, Sphg-1-P—sphinganine-1-phosphate.'
