caption: 'Proposed pathways influencing adiposity in C. elegans. Sensory neurons secrete
  (a) serotonin, (b) insulin and (c) TGF-β in response to nutritional cues. These
  signals are perceived by receptors (blue boxes), and signals are transduced by kinases
  and other signaling pathways (grey boxes). At least four transcription factors (pink
  ovals), in addition to the transcriptional mediator MDT-15 (green), are required
  for efficient transcription of the Δ9 desaturase genes fat-5, fat-6 and fat-7. These
  and other fat-synthesis genes (purple boxes) promote fat storage, whereas expression
  of genes encoding β-oxidation enzymes in mitochondria (brown oval) promote increased
  fat oxidation, culminating in decreased fat stores. Experiments performed to determine
  the downstream pathway from serotonin used exogenous serotonin. Abbreviations: TGF-β,
  transforming growth factor-β; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-βinding protein;
  GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; TF, transcription factor; NHR, nuclear hormone
  receptor.'
