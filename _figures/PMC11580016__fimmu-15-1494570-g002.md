caption: 'Summary of the sources of AHR ligands. AHR ligands fall into two categories:
  endogenous and exogenous. Exogenous ligands include synthetic aromatic hydrocarbons
  from pollutants and carcinogens, as well as natural compounds from vegetables and
  fruits. Endogenous ligands mainly come from tryptophan metabolism by the host and
  microbiota. Within the host, Trp is predominantly metabolized through the kynurenine
  (KYN) metabolic pathway. Trp is enzymatically converted by either indolamine-2,
  3-dioxygenase (IDO) or tryptophan-2, 3-dioxygenase (TDO) to Kynurenine. Kynurenine
  undergoes conversion to kynurenic acid via the enzymatic activity of kynurenine
  aminotransferase (KAT), and to 3-hydroxykynurenine through the action of kynurenine
  3-monooxygenase (KMO). Subsequently, it is metabolized into various products, including
  kynurenic acid, kynurenine, and quinolinic acid. 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole
  (FICZ) is produced as a result of the light or ROS in the skin. Another important
  source of ligand for AHR are microbial metabolites of tryptophan. Bacteria metabolize
  tryptophan into indole via the tnaA enzyme and can further metabolize it into indole-3-pyruvic
  acid (IPYA), indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), indole-3-acetaldehyde (IA), and indole-3-propionic
  acid (IPA). Additionally, they can convert tryptophan into tryptamine, indole-3-acetaldehyde
  (IAald), and tryptophol, or into indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indole-3-acetaldehyde
  (IAld)'
