caption: '(A) A summary of the main metabolic pathway for ATP production and where
  metabolic inhibitors affect this pathway. Inhibitors that are underlined are those
  used in this study, whereas those that are not underlined were used by B치r치ny. The
  net ATP production per molecule of glucose is shown in green. (B) Schematic representation
  of glycolysis, with metabolic inhibitors shown in red. 2-DG: 2-Deoxy-D-glucose;
  3PO: (2E)-3-(3-Pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one; IAA: iodoacetic acid;
  NaAsO2: sodium arsenite; NaF: sodium fluoride; NaCN: sodium cyanide; NaN3: sodium
  azide; DNP: 2-4-Dinitrophenol.'
