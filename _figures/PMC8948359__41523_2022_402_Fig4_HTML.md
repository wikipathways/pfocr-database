caption: a The workflow of the mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analysis.
  b Principal-component analysis of all identified normal proteins and phosphorylation
  sites shows that samples cluster tightly according to biology. The log2 ratios of
  normal proteins and phosphorylation sites in the control group was defaulted to
  0.
