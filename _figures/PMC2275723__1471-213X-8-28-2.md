caption: Model of body size regulation by nutrients availability in C. elegans (from
  L3 onwards). Our results suggest that food availability may regulate body size in
  at least two ways. First, by the "caloric pathway", that is, simply considering
  that food intake and its absorption by the digestive tract facilitates nutrition,
  which in turn may inhibit autophagy. Second, by the "sensory pathway", which refers
  to the sensing food through organs such as the amphids, with their ciliated neurons
  expressing genes like che-2, would inhibit EGL-4. Downstream, this cGMP-dependent
  protein kinase downregulates DBL-1 signalling, which in turn promotes hypodermal
  endoreduplication, upregulator of body size [36]. LON-1 inhibition by DBL-1 [28]
  would not influence ploidy upon nutrient activation. This model explains why the
  nutrient-dependent regulation that the sensory cilia proteins, EGL-4 and DBL-1 are
  all playing on hypodermal polyploidization has not been observed for body size;
  their role on body size, but not upon endoreduplication, may be obscured by the
  dominant influence of caloric restriction.
