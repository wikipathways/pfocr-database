caption: 'A. Graphical representation of the ‘NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response’
  Ingenuity pathway annotation mRNA set indicating mRNAs either induced (red icons)
  or repressed (green icons) by L-SUL treatment. Three discrete clusters of mRNA expression
  level changes were able to be identified: i) PD-specific (blue shading), ii) Control
  hONS-specific (red shading) and iii) those common to both PD and Control hONS cultures
  (yellow shading). B. Graphical representation of the ‘PI3K / AKT signalling’ Ingenuity
  pathway annotation mRNA set indicating mRNAs either induced (red icons) or repressed
  (green icons) by L-SUL treatment. Three discrete clusters of mRNA expression level
