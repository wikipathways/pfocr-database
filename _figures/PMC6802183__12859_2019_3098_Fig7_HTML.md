caption: 'The model structure consists of HIF-1α signaling, tumor signaling, and ATP
  depletion modules. a Summary block diagram of the input, output, and the interaction
  between core sub-system components. Inputs: hypoxia, drug inhibition of protein
  kinases and inhibition of VEGF binding. Outputs: ERK and Akt activation. b The kinetic
  model of the HIF-1α signaling pathway. c The kinetic model of VEG and other growth
  factor signaling network. Stimulation and inhibition are represented as ─●and ─┤,
  respectively. Single arrow head toward the species denotes synthesis. The two sub-models
  were connected by using VEGF mRNA and the output of the HIF-1α signaling pathway
  model as input to the tumor signaling pathway model to drive VEGF production (arrows
  with yellow shadow). The hypoxia induced ATP depletion model was linked to the tumor
  signaling model via additions of ATP-dependent phosphorylation reactions (denoted
  as *). See Additional files  and  for more details'
