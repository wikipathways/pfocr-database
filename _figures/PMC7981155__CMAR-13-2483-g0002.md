caption: In WNT/PCP signaling pathway, WNT5a can activate Dvl by forming complexes
  with FZD and Ror2 receptors, and furthermore, small GTP enzymes of the Rho family
  are activated, including RhoA and Rac, and their downstream effectors, Rho-associated
  protein kinase (ROCK), the actin-binding protein, Filamin A and c-Jun N-terminal
  protein kinase (JNK), and in turn PCP pathway is activated. This process leads to
  the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and regulating polarized cell morphology and
  migration within tissues. WNT5a activation of the WNT/Ca2+ signaling pathway leads
  to the mobilization of free intracellular calcium, which regulates many cellular
  processes, including actin cytoskeleton remodeling and cell motility through activation
  of calcium-dependent signaling molecules. In the canonical pathway, WNT5a plays
  two roles. On the one hand, WNT5a can activate canonical pathways to regulate embryogenesis
  and cell fate specificity. On the other hand, WNT5a can repress the canonical pathway
  by promoting glycogen synthase kinase3-independent degradation of β-catenin in regulating
  mammalian limb development.,
