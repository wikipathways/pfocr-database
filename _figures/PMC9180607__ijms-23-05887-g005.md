caption: Metabolic yin–yang regulation of CCN2 and CCN3 during fibrotic disorder development.
  TGF-β signal stimulates CCN2 both directly through specific transcription factors,
  including Smad3, TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1), specificity protein (SP) 1/SP3
  and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) -extracellular signal regulated kinase
  (ERK) kinase (MEK), and indirectly through the activation of glycolysis by accumulating
  hexokinase (HK)-2, which is mediated by yes-associated protein (YAP) 1. Glycolysis
  activation by TGF-β through HK-2 contrarily represses RFX1 expression, resulting
  in the repression of antifibrotic CCN3 production. Smad-independent negative regulation
  of CCN3 by TGF-β observed in nucleus pulposus cells could occur through this metabolic
  pathway. Finally, CCN2 protein promotes fibrosis in collaboration with TGF-β.
