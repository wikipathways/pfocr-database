caption: Pathway that supplies acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis (Evans et al.,
  ; Ratledge & Wynn, ) and ASX (Chavez-Cabrera et al., ) in oleaginous yeast shortly
  after occurring a nitrogen limitation. Nitrogen limitation promotes high cellular
  NADH and ATP that inhibit NAD+ isocitrate dehydrogenase. This elicits mitochondrial
  accumulation of intermediaries upstream of α-ketoglutarate in the TCA cycle, that
  is, citrate. Then citrate is exported from mitochondria to cytoplasm and cleaved
  by the enzyme ATP:citrate lyase (ACL) to give cytosolic acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate.
  Citrate is considered the most important source of acetyl-CoA for the syntheses
  of fatty acid synthesis and ASX in yeasts grown under nitrogen-deficiency. P. rhodozyma
  possesses a citrate-malate shuttle for the translocation of citrate to cytosol.
