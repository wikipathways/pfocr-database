caption: Targeting the TGF-β signaling pathway in cancer. Various molecular mechanisms
  by which TGF-β signaling is targeted for therapeutic gain are depicted. TGF-β inhibitory
  targeting agents (), including TβRI kinase inhibitors, AON targeting ligand or receptor
  gene expression, and antibodies interfering with ligand-receptor interactions, have
  been developed to curtail excessive TGF-β pathway activation. Inhibitory signals
  are indicated with inhibitory red arrows; Stimulatory signals are indicated with
  green arrows.
