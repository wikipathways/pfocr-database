caption: Hippo signalling contributes to renal fibrosis and damage in diabetic conditions.
  The core Hippo pathway comprises a kinase cascade involving MSTl/2 and LATSl/2.
  In diabetic conditions, when the pathway is switched on, YAP/TAZ phosphorylate,
  leading to YAP/TAZ inhibition, thus preventing their nuclear translocation and downstream
  gene activation. When the pathway is off, YAP/TAZ translocates to the nucleus to
  activate downstream genes involved in fibrosis. Dysregulated Hippo signalling in
  the diabetic kidney results in decreased MSTl/2 activity, which favours YAP/TAZ
  translocation to the nucleus, where they promote fibrosis by activating profibrotic
  genes such as CTGF and TGF-β1. The TGF-β signalling pathway via Smad 1 and 4 (Smad-dependent
  and non-Smad pathways) activates the translocation of the Smad 1/4/YAP/TAZ complex
  into the kidney, which upregulates fibrotic markers, leading to epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix (ECMJ accumulation, thereby amplifying
  renal fibrosis
