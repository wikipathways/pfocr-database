caption: 'Schematic depicting the response of steroidogenic cells to stressors such
  as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ROS. TSPO responds to stress-related increases
  in ROS by working with voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1)
  to increase the level of ROS in the mitochondria, thereby amplifying ROS signaling
  in the cell, driving the upregulation of cyclooxygenases, nitric oxide synthases,
  lipoxygenases, and NAPDH oxidase.,, It also has been shown to play a role in blocking
  ubiquitination of the mitochondria by other factors, thereby blocking mitophagy.
  Among the regulatory elements that drive expression of the TSPO gene is an ROS response
  element in the promoter that binds specificity protein 1 (SP1), which accumulates
  in the nucleus upon activation by ROS. Additionally, a PXR binding site in the TSPO
  gene promoter plays a part in the allopregnanolone stress response. On the other
  hand, 3α-HSD3 plays a role in detoxification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
  PAH first undergoes a phase I detoxification reaction by the P450 family enzymes
  (but not P450scc, which strictly plays a role in steroidogenesis; this family is
  also known as the CYP enzymes), to form a dihydrodiol.– 3α-HSD3 then converts the
  dihydrodiol into an ortho-quinone, which is further conjugated to glutathione by
  a quinone reductase, thus producing a nontoxic metabolite for excretion from the
  body.– Both the dihydrodiol and the ortho-quinone intermediates are capable of producing
  ROS and are considered genotoxic., However, the reaction pathway through 3α-HSD3
  is the major route for eliminating PAHs, making the synthesis of these intermediates
  necessary. 3α-HSD3 is regulated by the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2),
  which dissociates from its repressor Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1)
  upon exposure to increased ROS levels in the cell., Nrf2 binds to the antioxidant
  response element (ARE) in the promoter of 3α-HSD3 and upregulates its expression
  to meet the detoxification demands of the cell. Both TSPO and 3α-HSD3—enzymes responsible
  for allopregnanolone synthesis—are upregulated in response to these stressors, highlighting
  a role for allopregnanolone in stress response. OMM: outer mitochondrial membrane;
