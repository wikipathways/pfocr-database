caption: Three genes of the methionine biosynthesis pathway were positively regulated
  by (p)ppGpp in B. suis. The different genes encoding the enzymes involved in the
  pathway from L-Aspartate to L-Methionine are represented. Gene BR0793 was identified
  by microarray analysis and RT-qPCR, genes BR1871 and BR1274 by RT-qPCR.
