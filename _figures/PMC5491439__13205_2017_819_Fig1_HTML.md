caption: 'Basic representation of flavan-3-ol/anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in
  plants. The enzymes are represented in abbreviated form: CHS chalcone synthase,
  CHI chalcone isomerase, DFR dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, F3H flavanone-3-hydroxylase,
  LAR leucoanthocyanidin reductase, ANR1 anthocyanin reductase1, ANR2 anthocyanin
  reductase 2, ANS anthocyanin synthase, GTs glucosyl transferase. The tea cDNA-encoded
  enzymes (red color) were used to be overexpressed simultaneously in transgenic tobacco
  plants'
