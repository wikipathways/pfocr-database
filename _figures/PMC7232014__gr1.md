caption: Autophagy pathway overview, with childhood-onset neurodegenerative diseases
  affecting the pathway either directly or indirectly highlighted in red font. Signals
  that activate the autophagic process (initiation) in response to stress are mediated
  via mTOR and AMPK pathways and colocalise at the UNC51-like kinase (ULK)1 complex.
  This complex consists of ULK1, autophagy-related protein 13 (ATG13), RB1-inducible
  coiled-coil protein 1 (FIP200), and ATG101. This complex then initiates phagophore
  nucleation by the phosphorylation of proteins in the PI3KC3/VPS34 complex (class
  III PI3 kinase PI3KC3 also known as vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34), Beclin
  1, ATG14, activating molecule in Beclin 1-regulated autophagy protein 1 (AMBRA1)
  and general vesicular transport factor (p115)). The next step is the activation
  of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) generation at an endoplasmic reticulum
  structure (Omegasome). PI3P interacts with the effector proteins WD repeat domain
  phosphoinositide-interacting protein (WIPI1 and 2) and zinc-finger FYVE domain-containing
  protein 1 (DFCP1), recruiting them to the omegasome via interaction with their PI3P-binding
  domains. WIPI2 interacts with the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex. This complex facilitates
  ATG3-mediated conjugation of ATG8 proteins, such as microtubule-associated protein
  light chain 3 (LC3) proteins and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated proteins
  (GABARAPS) to membrane-resident phosphatidylethanoloamine (PE). This leads to the
  formation of lipidated forms that can bind to membranes. ATG8s attract additional
  proteins in the autophagy pathway containing LC3-interacting regions (LIR). They
  are required for membrane extension and sealing of the phagophore membrane to create
  the autophagosome. ATG9-containing vesicles mediate the delivery of some of these
  membranes. The sealing of the membrane produces the autophagosome. The next step
  is the removal of the ATG proteins, followed by fusion with lysosomes. Lysosomes
  contain acid hydrolases, which break down the autophagic cargo, allowing rescued
  nutrients to be returned to the cytoplasm. TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex; MPAN,
  mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration; HSP, hereditary spastic
  paraplegia; NBIA, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. Inhibitory phosphorylation
  events shown as ‘P’ encircled, in yellow/light gray, activating phosphorylation
  events shown in red/dark gray.
