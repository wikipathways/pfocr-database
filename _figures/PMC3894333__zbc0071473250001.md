caption: 'Scheme for the generation of NADPH by rod inner segment metabolic pathways
  utilizing glucose and glutamine as substrates. The generated NADPH is a necessary
  cofactor for the reduction of retinal to retinol in the rod outer segment. The metabolic
  substrate for the pentose phosphate pathway is glucose, which can enter the pathway
  after its phosphorylation to glucose-6-phosphate (Gluc-6-P) by a hexokinase. Through
  the pentose phosphate pathway, one molecule of glucose generates two molecules of
  NADPH: one is generated through the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone
  by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), and one more is generated through the
  oxidative decarboxylation of 6-phosphogluconate to ribulose-5-phosphate by 6-phosphogluconate
  dehydrogenase (PD). NADPH can also be generated by cytosolic NADP+-dependent isocitrate
  dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and malic enzyme (ME), which catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation
  of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate and the oxidation of malate to pyruvate, respectively.
  Isocitrate and malate originate from the mitochondria where they also participate
  in the TCA cycle. Rh, rhodopsin; MRh, metarhodopsin; Gluc, glucose; Gln, glutamine;
  Pyr, pyruvate.'
