caption: Schematic diagram showing the apoptosis effects of MB8 in HepG2 cell. Increasing
  the expression of GLUT4 protein as well as promoting β-oxidation of fatty acids,
  thereby activating the TCA cycle in the mitochondria and increasing the production
  of ROS. These signal transduction activates the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, and
  cleavage of caspase 8 activates the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Through these various
  pathways, MB8 induces strong apoptosis in HCC.
