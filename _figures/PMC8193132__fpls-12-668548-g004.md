caption: Simplified mechanism of auxin perception through the TIR1-AFB signalling
  cascade leading to the activation of primary auxin response genes. Transcription
  of auxin response genes is repressed by the Aux/IAA and ARP proteins (top). The
  presence of the auxins PAA, IAA, and 4-Cl-IAA degrade Aux/IAA and allow for gene
  transcription by ARF (bottom). The effect of the auxin IBA on transcription by ARF
  is mediated via conversion into IAA and the auxin IPA does not significantly activate
  the signalling pathway. Members of three primary response gene families can be activated
  by this system, of which various members are differentially regulated in feeding
  sites of cyst and root-knot nematodes (indicated in purple) (). There is partial
  overlap between the genes that can be activated by PAA and those that are activated
  by IAA. On the other hand, it is unknown which primary response genes 4-Cl-IAA can
  activate.
