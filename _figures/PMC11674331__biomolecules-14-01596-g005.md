caption: Role of PAK1 and PAK2 in angiogenesis. PAK1 and PAK2 can target MMPs and
  the cell cycle, thereby influencing the extracellular matrix and the proliferation
  of endothelial cells. Additionally, PAK1 can target Rac1, which affects the migration
  of VSMCs. PAK2, on the other hand, influences the formation of endothelial cells
  through the MAPK/Erk 5 pathway, as well as through the activation of VEGF and paxillin
  to regulate the cytoskeleton
