caption: Complement pathways. There are three well-recognized pathways of complement
  activation; (1) the classical pathway, (2) the lectin pathway, and (3) the alternative
  pathway. The classical and lectin pathways are activated when specific triggers
  are recognized by host pattern-recognition receptors while the alternative pathway
  is constitutively active. Activation of all there pathways ultimately leads to generation
  of a C3 convertase (C4b.C2a for the classical and lectin pathways and C3b·B for
  the alternative pathway), which cleave C3 to generate C3a and C3b. C3a is an anaphylatoxin.
  C3b is quickly inactivated when it lands on a healthy host cell but triggers a rapid
  amplification loop when it binds to a pathogen or altered host cell. C3b also complexes
  with the C3 convertases to form the C5 convertases (C4b·C2a·C3b and C3b·Bb·C3b)
  that cleave C5 into C5a (an anaphylatoxin) and C5b. C5b combines with C6-9 to form
  C5b-9, also called the membrane attack complex (MAC). Regulatory factors including
  decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55), CD59, factor H (CFH), factor I (CFI), membrane
  cofactor protein (MCP) and C3b/C4b receptor 1 (CR1) act at various stages of the
  cascade to control complement activation.
