caption: Aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways of rice. In the aerobic pathway,
  pyruvate, which is produced by pathways such as glycolysis, is converted to acetyl-coenzyme
  A (CoA) by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and is used for the trichloroacetic acid
  (TCA) cycle and the electron transfer chain in mitochondria. In the anaerobic pathway,
  pyruvate is converted to acetaldehyde by PDC. At the same time, acetaldehyde is
  converted to ethanol by ADH and to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH).
