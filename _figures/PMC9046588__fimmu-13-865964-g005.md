caption: The crosstalk between arginine methylation and cGAS-STING pathway. PRMT5
  methylates IFI16, attenuates IFI16 binding to dsDNA, and restrains dsDNA-stimulated
  activation of cGAS/STING signaling. Moreover, PRMT5 directly interacts with cGAS
  and impairs cGAS-DNA binding. The arginine methylation of TBK1, catalyzed by PRMT1,
  enhances TBK1 kinase activity, and PRMT6 inhibits TBK1-IRF3 complex assembly by
  binding to IRF3, thereby limiting type I IFN production by the TBK1-IRF3 pathway.
  cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; TBK1, TANK-binding
  kinase 1; IRF3, Interferon regulatory Factor 3.
