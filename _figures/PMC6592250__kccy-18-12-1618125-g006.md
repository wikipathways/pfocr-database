caption: Coordinated interactions between glycolysis, citrate cleavage enzyme, and
  glutaminolysis for the fatty acids biosynthesis in growing tumor cells. Based on
  the very low activity of the TCA cycle in growing tumor cells, glucose is diverted
  away from mitochondrial acetyl-CoA and citrate production. Alternatively, glutamine-derived
  α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and its subsequent reductive carboxylation by NADPH-dependent
  isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) results in citrate production. The latter is then
  converted to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate by the citrate cleavage enzyme (CCE). This
  extramitochondrial acetyl-CoA is used for long chain fatty acids biosynthesis. The
  enzymic decarboxylation of oxaloacetate by the cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
  1 (PEP-CK1) results in phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) formation which finally is primarily
  converted into lactate which leads to tumor acidic microenvironment. Marginal amount
  of pyruvate is also dispatched to mitochondrion. The oxaloacetate-to-malate conversion
  by NADH-dependent malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and the subsequent malic enzyme mediated
  decarboxylation of malate into pyruvate maintain the regeneration of NAD+ and a
  continual supply of NADPH, respectively. NAD+ regeneration ensures the perpetuation
  of the glycolysis pathway, whereas the generation of NADPH supports lipogenesis.
  The energy-linked nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) acts as an effective
  buffer system and catalyze the direct transfer of a hydride ion between NADH and
  NADPH. The interconnection between the NADPH consuming reductive carboxylation and
  NADPH producing oxidation of α-KG is also demonstrated.
