caption: Schematic overview of HIV-1 assembly process. Gag and Env traffic via different
  routes to reach a common site of assembly on the PM. The path taken by Gag to reach
  the PM remains uncertain. Env travels through the secretory pathway to the PM, and
  then is rapidly endocytosed. Depicted here is a role for the recycling endosome
  in the outward movement of Env to the site of particle assembly. Following the assembly
  of the immature virion and packaging of the viral gRNA, cleavage of Gag occurs,
  leading to dramatic structural rearrangements and the formation of the mature virion.
