caption: 'Simplified scheme of the flavonoid and lignin biosynthetic pathway. Some
  critical up-regulated (green) or down-regulated (red) enzymes of P. pinea are indicated
  and abbreviated as follows: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumarate: CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, flavanone isomerase;
  F3H, Flavanone 3-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin
  dioxygenase; OMT, O-methyltransferase; UFGT, UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyl
  transferase; RT, putative rhamnosyltransferase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase;
  CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; FLS, flavonol
  synthase; LAR, leucanthocyanidin reductase. Individual differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) with annotated functions are listed along the Y-axis for P. pinea and
  P. radiata. The bars in the X-axis represent the level of log2 fold change value
  based on the comparison of the transcript levels between the pine seedlings infected
  by F. circinatum and mock-inoculated control. Red bars denote the level of down-regulation,
  and green bars indicate the level of up-regulation.'
