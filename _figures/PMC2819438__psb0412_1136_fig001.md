caption: Biosynthetic pathway of serotonin and melatonin in plants. Serotonin, melatonin
  and IAA synthesized from Tryptophan. SER is synthesized from tryptophan by two enzymes,
  tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) and tryptamine 5-hydroxylase (T5H). Serotonin is
  converted in to melatonin by two enzymes, serotonin N-acetyl transferase and Hydroxyo-methyl
  transferase. Recent report suggests that exogenously applied melatonin raises Indole-3-acetic
  acid levels in roots of etiolated seedlings of Brassica juncea.
