caption: Model of UCB interaction with neural plasma membrane (A) and pathways by
  which UCB may affect neuronal function (B). Cell membrane includes a bilayer of
  packed phospholipids, cholesterol, and integral proteins. (A) The inset represents
  a phospholipid of the outer membrane containing a phosphatidyl-glycerol polar (hydrophilic
  head) and two fatty acids (hydrophobic tails). The phosphate group is attached to
  the glycerol and form ester links with a variety of other molecules. UCB decreases
  phospholipid mobility and the polarity at carbon (C) 5, while increased it at C7,
  and less markedly at C12 and C16 (orange). The intercalation at C5 may trigger the
  release of phospholipids and cholesterol, as well as the externalization of the
  phosphatidylserine, a recognition signal for phagocytosis. (B) UCB-induced protein
  oxidation and lipid peroxidation may arise from increased reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production. UCB impairs Mg2+-ATPase activity, responsible for the maintenance
  of phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet, and Na+, K+-ATPase, which may trigger
  the intracellular intrusion of calcium (Ca2+). Opening of Ca2+channels, as well
  as the activation of NMDA receptors by UCB, recognized to modulate the exocytosis
  of glutamate, can also account to it. Changes in membrane polarity and fluidity,
  equally produced at the mitochondrial membrane by UCB, lead to the collapse in the
  mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), translocation of proapoptic Bax to
  the mitochondria, inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase activity (complex IV of the
  respiratory chain), and efflux of cytochrome c. Then, activation of caspases 3 and
  9 (intrinsic apoptotic cascade) takes place, as well as UCB-induced activation of
  caspase-8 (extrinsic apoptotic cascade) and the cleavage of Bid into truncated Bid
  (tBid). Oxidation of GSH to GSSG and inability to be restored is associated with
  the increased ROS generation, which may determine DNA damage. DJ-1 that is early
  up-regulated, to diminish UCB-induced oxidative stress, is latter on oxidized and
  proteolitically degraded due to the reduced levels of GSH. Increased superoxide
  anion radical production  and decreased NADPH upon exposure to UCB also account
  to the oxidative stress. Glycolysis upregulation by UCB lead to increased intracellular
  lactate content and inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), providing
  ATP to support the bioenergetic crisis. UCB-asscociated nitrosative stress derives
  from the increased expression of nNOS and generation of NO and cyclic guanosine
  3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP). Actually, NO signaling, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2)
  stimulation, activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) with translocation to the
  nucleus, ROS generation, and activation of caspases are key players in the induction
  of genes involved in UCB-induced neuronal demise by necrosis and apoptosis.
