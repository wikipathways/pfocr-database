caption: This schematic summary illustrates the predicted structure-activation relationship
  of the AT1 receptor within the LOX-1-AT1 complex in renal component cells. This
  highlights how the simultaneous binding of angiotensin II (Ang II) to AT1 and oxidized
  low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) to LOX-1 induces conformational changes in AT1.
  These changes were more pronounced than those triggered by the individual ligands.
  Such structural alterations have been proposed to amplify G protein αq subunit (Gq)
  signaling pathway activation, subsequently leading to renal damage
