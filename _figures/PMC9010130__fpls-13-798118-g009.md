caption: Hypothetical schematic diagram for the mechanism of tolerance to abrupt freezing
  stress in alfalfa. Freezing stress induced calcium signal transduction through CaMs,
  CMLs, CBLs, and CPKs. CPKs directly responded to the signal transduction and active
  MAPKs were involved in the downstream CBFs/DREB1 expression. CaMs and CBLs interacted
  with CAMTAs and CIPKs, respectively, and regulated the genes of CBFs/DREB1. CBF1,
  CBF2, and CBF3 trigged an expression of COR genes, which resulted in an increase
  in the activities of SOD, POD, CAT, and APX. We hypothesize that the hub gene ABCC3
  was involved in the MAPK signal pathway and regulated the related genes of CBFs
  expression. This may have triggered the COR genes and led to an increase in antioxidant
  enzymes that counteracted abrupt freezing stress in the alfalfa leaves. The dashed
  arrows indicate that the mechanism is unclear, and CBF2 reduced the expression of
  CBF1 and CBF3.
