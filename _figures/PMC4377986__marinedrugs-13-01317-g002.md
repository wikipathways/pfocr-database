caption: (a) Compartmentalization of glycerolipid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. The
  FA synthase of type II (FASII) is located inside chloroplasts. Neo-synthesized acyl-ACP
  can be converted into free FAs (FFA), exported and thio-esterified to coenzyme A.
  Cytosolic acyl-CoA can serve for the esterification of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P)
  into phosphatidic acid (PA) and its dephosphorylated form diacylglycerol (DAG).
  In the ER, PA, and DAG are precursors for phospholipids like phosphatidylcholine
  (PC). PC can undergo an acyl-editing cycle (Lands cycle), by the hydrolysis of a
  FA at position sn-2 followed by a re-acylation with an FA obtained from the acyl-CoA
  pool (dashed lines). In Arabidopsis, this process is known to incorporate more neo-synthesized
  fatty acids into ER glycerolipids than the stepwise acylation of G3P. Polar head
  exchanges can occur by the action of a PC-DAG phosphocholine transferase (PDCT),
  leading to the coexistence of de novo-synthesized or PC-derived DAG molecules with
  distinct FA molecular species. A third acyl can be added to DAG to form TAG, either
  obtained from the acyl-CoA pool by a DAG acyltransferase (DGAT) activity or by transfer
  from a PC molecule by a PC-DAG acyltransferase (PDAT) activity. Overall, this pathway
  in the ER is called the eukaryotic pathway. In chloroplasts, the prokaryotic pathway
  generates PA and DAG and lipids like mono and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG,
  DGDG), sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG), or phosphatidylglycerol (PG). Some
  eukaryotic precursors are imported to the chloroplast; (b) Compartmentalization
  of glycerolipid biosynthesis in Phaeodactylum. Similar pathways are predicted to
  occur. Some specific features, like the import of very-long chain polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (VLC-PUFA) in plastid, via the omega pathway, are highlighted.
