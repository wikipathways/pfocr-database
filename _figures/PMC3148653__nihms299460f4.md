caption: 'Network of HNF4A-regulated genes. Pathway Explorer was used to build a network
  of all transcriptional targets of HNF4A from the Ingenuity Knowledge Base (IPA)
  that were differentially expressed after irradiation with 0.1 Gy (panel A). The
  nodes were colored by overlaying significant expression ratios from the data for
  0.1 Gy (panel A) or 2.5 Gy (panel B), with red indicating upregulation and green
  downregulation. The time after irradiation when a response was observed is indicated
  by the background shading of the figure (blue: 4 h, pink: 16 h, purple: both 4 and
  16 h, yellow: 24 h).'
