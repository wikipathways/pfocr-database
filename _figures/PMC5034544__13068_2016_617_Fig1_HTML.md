caption: 'Modular and metabolic engineering of S. elongatus PCC 7942 for photosynthetic
  amorpha-4,11-diene and squalene productions from CO2. a Heterologous expression
  of key enzymes derived from E. coli were introduced to direct the carbon flux to
  the native 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway as a module of OverMEP.
  The second module (TPS terpene synthase) is an enzymatic conversion of farnesyl
  diphosphate (FPP) to either heterologous sesqui- or triterpene as a final carbon
  sink. Based on the OverMEP strains, heterologous amorphadiene synthase (ADS) and
  squalene synthase (SQS) were expressed, respectively. A molecule of FPP was converted
  to amorphadiene catalyzed by ADS, or a reductive dimerization of two molecules of
  FPP was catalyzed by SQS to produce squalene. b Schematic diagrams of the construction
  of S. elongatus PCC 7942 strains that produce either amorphadiene or squalene. The
  heterologous genes dxs, dxs-idi, dxs-dxr-idi, dxr-idi-ispA, dxs-idi-ispA, dxs-dxr-idi-ispA
  were introduced to a neutral site I (NSI) of S. elongatus genomic DNA, respectively.
  Subsequently, the ADS or SQS genes were introduced to neutral site II (NSII). Each
  strain was verified by PCR using a pair of oligonucleotides shown as red arrows
  and their sequences are listed in Additional file : Table S1. The corresponding
  DNA fragments (1, 2 and 3) are shown in gel images. Also, the DNA sequences were
