caption: The quantitative system pharmacology approach for a schizophrenia model is
  based on actual preclinical neurophysiology and human neuroanatomy. For instance,
  the different types (direct vs. indirect pathway projecting) of striatal medium
  spiny neurons (MSN) are driven by cortical afferents, gated by the amygdala and
  hippocampal projections and their activity is modulated by dopaminergic afferents
  from the ventral tegmentum area (in the case of the N accumbens), cholinergic input
  from local tonically active interneurons, serotonergic afferents from dorsal raphe,
  and noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus. All these processes modulate
  the MSN membrane potential that further define the timing of the action potential
  train into the other subcortical regions and ultimately through the thalamus back
  to the cortex. The model output is calculated as an information content (i.e., bandwidth)
  from the action potential spike train in the MSN (see text for a detailed description).
  A larger cortical network of 120 neurons (80 pyramidal cells and 40 inhibitory interneurons)
  simulates the cortical pathology and pharmacology that drives the MSN activity.
  The D1-mediated direct pathway MSN then further projects into GPi; the D2-mediated
  indirect pathway projects to the GPe and STN before converging in the GPi and further
  projecting to thalamic nuclei. The number of circles reflect the total number of
  cells simulated in the network except for the cortical model (where there are 120
  neurons). There are 16 neurons in the GPe, GPi, and STN and four excitatory and
  four inhibitory cells in the thalamic nuclei. At various positions in the circuit,
  different types of neuromodulatory receptors (29 in total) mediate the effect of
  various neurotransmitters on the membrane excitability and subsequently the nature
  of the emergent network properties. These receptors are indicated by tags like D1
  (dopamine D1), M1 (muscarinic M1 receptor), and 5HT4 (serotonin-receptor type 4),
  and affect various ion channels (indicated by Kir (indirect rectifier K+ channel),
  Nap (persistent Na+-channel), Hva (high-threshold activated Ca++-channel), leak
  (leak current), etc.). The specific interaction between neuromodulatory receptors
  and voltage-gated ion-channels is derived from the preclinical literature data.
  By virtue of their pharmacology, drugs might affect certain postsynaptic receptors
  as they enter in competition with the endogenous neurotransmitter and affect neuronal
  membrane excitability through changes in appropriate ion-channel conductances. BC,
  basket cell interneuron; GPe, globus pallidus externa, GPi, globus pallidus interna;
  Pyr, pyramidal cell; RE, reticular (inhibitory) cell; STN, subthalamic nucleus;
  TC, thalamocortical cell.
