caption: 'The lines show the interaction between the players: arrows indicate activation
  or generation; solid line indicates a direct influence or direct connection; dotted
  line indicates the influence in an indirect manner. The agr regulatory molecule
  RNAIII inhibits Rot (Repressor of toxins) translation to derepress the expression
  of Rot-controlled genes, including tarH. WTA biosynthesis may affect the Und-P flux
  into the lipid II biosynthesis pathway, as both processes compete for the Und-P
  lipid carrier to initiate biosynthesis.'
