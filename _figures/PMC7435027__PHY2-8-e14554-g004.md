caption: 'Illustration of the effects of acetaminophen on glutathione, antioxidant
  processes, and metabolic processes. Acetaminophen depleted glutathione in the liver
  causing oxidative stress. It also reduced the activities of catalase and glutathione
  peroxidase (GPX) that neutralize oxygen radicals, but did not change the activity
  of glutathione reductase (GR) that requires NADPH to regenerate reduced glutathione.
  Responses of NADPH‐producing enzymes were complex; increased isocitrate dehydrogenase
  1 (IDH1), decreased IDH2 and malic enzyme 1 (ME1), and unchanged glucose 6‐phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1). According
  to NMR analysis of glucose, the production of triple‐labeled ([1,2,3‐13C3] and [4,5,6‐13C3])
  glucose remained unchanged with acetaminophen treatment, informing intact gluconeogenesis
  directly from [U‐13C3]glycerol in the cytosol. However, both [1,2‐13C2]glucose produced
  through the PPP and [5,6‐13C2]glucose produced through the TCA cycle were suppressed.
  In NMR analysis of liver extracts, triple‐labeled ([1,2,3‐13C3] and [2,3,4‐13C3])
  succinate was reduced with acetaminophen, informing suppressed pyruvate carboxylation
  to enter the TCA cycle. Abbreviation: DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; GA3P, glyceraldehyde
  3‐phosphate; Glu, glutamate; GSSG, glutathione disulfide; α‐kG, alpha‐ketoglutarate;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; THF, tetrahydrofolate'
