caption: Schematic representation of the effects of RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway inhibition
  on membrane FasL expression and lymphocytes apoptosis. In vitro treatments of B16F10
  melanoma cells with inhibitors of the RhoA/ROCK pathway increase the membrane FasL
  expression on these treated tumor cells. This (over)expression promoted the apoptosis
  of Fas-sensitive lymphocytes.
