caption: 'Engineered metabolic pathways for bioproduction of alkanes in bacteria as
  reported previously (). The overall strategy for conversion of exogenous fatty acid
  and glucose to alkane is shown. Abbreviations used are: CoA, coenzyme A; TEs, thioesterases;
  ACP, acyl carrier protein; Fdred, reduced ferredoxin; Fdox, oxidized ferredoxin.'
