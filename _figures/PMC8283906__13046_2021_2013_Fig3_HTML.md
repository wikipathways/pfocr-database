caption: The strategy of targeting NETs or blocking NETs-mediated effect. a The induction
  of cancer-associated NETs formation is mediated by the interaction of cancer or
  stroma –derived chemokines/cytokines and the specific receptor present on neutrophils.
  Blockade of the chemokines/cytokines or the receptors on neutrophils can inhibit
  the induction of NETs formation. b Inhibition of NETs formation via targeting key
  players such as NOX2, NE, MPO or PAD4 in the formation pathway. c Direct destruction
  of NETs structure via DNase. d NETs-mediated pro-tumor effect is through the interaction
  of NETs and cancer cells. Block their interaction via targeting the mediators can
  prevent NETs effect on cancer cells
