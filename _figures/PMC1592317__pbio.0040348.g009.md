caption: Our data suggest the following model of DCN axon extension and retraction.
  DCN axons extend due to active JNK signal. These axons encounter Wnt5 and probably
  Wnt2 as well, resulting in activation of Disheveled. Disheveled, via its DEP domain,
  has a negative effect on the activity of the Rac GTPase, thus keeping JNK signaling
  active. After DCN axons cross the second optic chiasm they encounter a spatially
  regulated FGF/Branchless signal that activates the FGFR/Breathless pathway. Breathless
  in turn activates Rac, which inhibits JNK signaling in a subset of axons. These
  axons then retract back toward the lobula. The wide expression of the different
  components of these pathways and the modulation of JNK phosphorylation by Dsh and
  Rac in whole-head extracts strongly suggests that this model may apply to many neuronal
  types.
