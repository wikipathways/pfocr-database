caption: Overview of the A. flavus–groundnut interaction showing proteins related
  to resistance in HIGS lines infected with A. flavus. Detailed information on these
  proteins is shown in Table 2 and Supplementary Table S7. Information on proteins
  related to calcium signaling (Table 2), heat shock proteins (Table 2), phytohormones
  (Table 2), transcription factors (Table 2), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
  (Table S7), secondary metabolic pathway genes, lipoxygenase (LOX), glycerol-3-phosphate
  acyltransferase (GPAT), lysophosphatidyl acyltransferase (LPAT), phospholipase D
  (PLD), sphingolipid Δ-8 desaturase (SLD), ceramide kinase-related protein (CERKL),
  and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase proenzyme 1 (PISD-1) are presented in Table
  2. While the upregulated and downregulated proteins at 0, 30, 48, and 72 hpi are
  indicated as green and red squares, the absent proteins are indicated as white squares
