caption: 'Subcellular trafficking and residences of PCs in a virus-infected cell.
  The scheme shows the initial infection steps of an enveloped virus with glycoprotein
  spikes (blue) and the biosynthetic pathway of virus spikes from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane where assembly and release of the virus take
  place. PCs relevant for virus maturation (magenta) are shown on the exocytic pathway
  from ER via the Golgi apparatus, the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and the secretory
  vesicles (SV) to the plasma membrane. PCs recycle via endosomes to their residences:
  furin and PC5B and PACE4 accumulate in the TGN. PC7 is enriched and enzymatically
  active in sialyltransferase-deficient vesicles (SDV) and in minor quantities directly
  exported to the plasma membrane circumventing the Golgi/TGN complex. SKI-1/S1P is
  mainly active in the cis-Golgi region. The furin ectodomain is cut off by an unknown
  protease, and SKI1/S1P is probably released by autocatalysis. Soluble enzymatically
  active furin (sfurin) and soluble sSKI-1 are released into the extracellular matrix;
  PACE4, PCSK9, and PC5A interact with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs)
  and form tertiary complexes with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) ready for
  cleavage of extracellular substrates. PC1/3, PC2, PC5A, and PCSK9 (black) are most
  probably irrelevant for processing of viral proteins'
