caption: ABL Kinase Activation and Signaling in Solid Tumors. ABL kinases are activated
  by hyperactive receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), chemokine receptors, and SRC family
  kinases as well as by oxidative and metabolic stress. By activating multiple MMPs
  and actin-regulatory proteins such as RAC, cortactin, N-WASP, ABL interactor 1 (ABI1),
  and WAVE, activated ABL kinases promote cancer cell migration and invasion. ABL1
  regulates cyclin D1 signaling downstream of the EPHB2 receptor to promote the activation
  of proliferative response factors in the intestinal epithelium and adenomas. In
  response to high fumarate levels, the ABL1 kinase becomes hyperactive in FH-deficient
  renal cancer cells (HLRCC); activated ABL1 promotes aerobic glycolysis via the mTOR-HIF1/pathway
  and also induces nuclear localization of the transcription factor NRF2 to induce
  the expression of NQO1 and other antioxidant response factors in HLRCC. NOTCH activation
  in the Apc+/D716 polyposis mouse intestinal epithelium promoted RBPJ-mediated transcription,
  leading to increased levels of DAB1, a substrate and activator of ABL kinases; activated
  ABL in colorectal cancer cells induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of TRIO on Y2681,
  leading to increased TRIO Rho-GEF activity.
