caption: The networks were generated in IPA using triangle connectivity based on focus
  genes (those present in our data set) and built up according to the number of interactions
  between a single prospective gene and others in the existing network, and the number
  of interactions the prospective genes have outside this network with other genes
  as determined by IPA . Network A (score = 39), shows interactions between LTBP1,
  LTBP2, COL14A1 and TNXBI indicating extracellular matrix signalling and network
  B (score = 28), shows involvement of Wnt pathway members WNT2B and FRZB. Interactions
  between molecules, and the degree and direction of regulation are indicated with
  up- (red) or down-regulation (green) and increasing color intensity with degree
  of fold change.
