caption: 'The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling pathway and major downstream
  effects on cancer cells. The activation of IGF1 by the ligation to its receptor
  (IGF-1R) activates two pathways: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/AKT) and
  Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras/MAPK). (a) PI3K/AKT activates nuclear
  factor-κB (NFκB) and mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) for cell survival and inhibits
  apoptosis through inhibition of BCL2 associated agonist of cell death (BAD) and
  Forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 (FKHR), resulting in decreased apoptosis, increased
  protein synthesis, cell growth, and cell proliferation, among various other effects
  not represented here. (b) Ras/MAPK contains an elaborate kinase cascade that ultimately
  leads to increased cellular proliferation by promoting the activity of transcription
  factors, such as ELK1. The ligation of IGF-1 to IGF-1R is modulated by IGFBPs through
  direct binding in the extracellular space. IGFBPs also exert several IGF-independent
  effects via direct interaction with cell membrane-bound proteins, such as integrins.
