caption: Figure 4. Main effects of manipulation of RhoGTPase signaling by toxigenic
  and invasive bacteria on pathogen dissemination. Toxigenic bacteria secrete toxins,
  which upon biochemical RhoGTPase modification alter the actin cytoskeleton and subsequently
  epithelial and endothelial barriers opening a breach for bacterial dissemination.
  Invasive bacteria modulate the RhoGTPase signaling mainly by injecting virulence
  factors which mimic regulatory proteins of the RhoGTPase cycle or by triggering
  a cell surface receptor mediated pathway which activates RhoGTpases leading to bacterial
  invasion in epithelial cells or to prevention of phagocytosis by professional phagocytic
  cells. Activation of RhoGTPase state is sensed by the NOD1 pathway of innate immunity
  which controls a proinflammatory defense response.
