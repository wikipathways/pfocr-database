caption: The four flux sensors of the in silico cell. The four flux-signaling metabolites
  are established through enzyme kinetics and regulations that realize the motifs
  ‘pathway usage' and ‘flux direction.' The simulated dependencies of the flux-signaling
  metabolites on the fluxes they measure show that these metabolites exhibit markedly
  distinct levels not only for balanced growth (filled dots), but also for up to 80%
  lower glucose (regular lines) or acetate (dashed lines) uptake rates. The levels
  of these metabolites thus report extracellular glucose and acetate. These distinct
  metabolite levels propagate into distinct activities of their target TFs, which
  adjusts the transcriptional regulation exerted by these TFs to the present carbon
  sources.
