caption: Neurofibromin is a negative RAS regulator. Growth factor binding to cognate
  receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR, RTK) or chemokine binding to G-protein coupled
  receptors (GPCR) lead to activation of RAS and subsequent phosphorylation of downstream
  RAS effectors, including AKT (mTOR) and RAF (MEK/ERK). Neurofibromin functions in
  part as a RAS-GTPase activating-related protein that stimulates inherent GTPase
  activity of RAS, increasing the conversion of active GTP-RAS to inactive GDP-RAS.
  Loss of neurofibromin leads to increased RAS/RAF effector activity, and greater
  cell growth. Signals from the microenvironment, HIPPO pathway, Janus kinases, epigenetic
  regulators, and protein stability pathways also contribute to malignant cell growth.
  Drugs that have been tested in clinical trials for MPNST are depicted in red alongside
  their respective targets. Potential drug targets to include in novel combinations
  for MPNST are depicted in blue alongside the respective targets.
