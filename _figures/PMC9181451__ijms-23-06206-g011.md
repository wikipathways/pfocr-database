caption: FL118 mechanism of action (MOA). DDX5 is a multifunctional master regulator
  involved in (1) co-activation of transcription of many oncogenes through the direct
  interactions of different transcription factors (e.g., c-Myc) in the oncogenic gene
  promoters, (2) regulation of miRNA and pre-RNA splicing (e.g., U1, U2, U3, …, snRNP),
  and (3) ribosome biogenesis (e.g., 32S rRNA, pre-ribosome). The small-molecule drug
  FL118 directly binds to and functionally dephosphorylates and degrades DDX5 protein
  (without decreasing DDX5 mRNA) through the proteasome degradation pathway. This
  suggests that FL118 could glue both DDX5 and ubiquitin-involved protein stability/degradation
  regulators (i.e., FL118 acts as a “molecular glue degrader”). All the DDX5 downstream
  protein targets were known to be involved in cancer initiation, development, metastasis,
  recurrence, and treatment resistance. Therefore, indirectly blocking DDX5 downstream
  targets through direct dephosphorylation and degradation of DDX5 by FL118 could
  result in FL118 high antitumor efficacy as demonstrated in our recent study, which
  used human CRC and PDAC cell and tumor models [].
