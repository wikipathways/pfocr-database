caption: 'The PINK1-Parkin pathway regulates IPAS expression and inhibits neuronal
  death. (A) A model for the action of IPAS in transcriptional repression and apoptosis.
  Nuclear IPAS is bound to HIF-1α and inhibits hypoxic responses by inhibiting HIF-1α
  transcriptional activity. Mitochondrial IPAS is bound to Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and A1a
  on the mitochondria and blocks the interaction of these proteins with Bax; thus
  activating of Bax, followed by release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3.
  p38-activated MK2 phosphorylates IPAS at Ser184, activating the pro-apoptotic functions
  of IPAS. IPAS has dual functions involved in the transcription repression of HIF-1α
  and cell death. (B) In healthy neurons, IPAS Thr12 is phosphorylated by PINK1 and
  then ubiquitinated by Parkin at lys167–169 in the PAS-like region, leading to the
  proteasomal degradation of IPAS. Phosphorylation of IPAS at Thr12 may induce a conformation
  change of IPAS to make the PAS-like region accessible to Parkin (top). The dopaminergic
  neurotoxin, MPTP, and other oxidative stresses strongly induce IPAS expression in
  the SNpc. Parkin is inhibited by S-nitrosylation or its ligase-dead pathologic mutation
  in PD. p38-activated MK2 may phosphorylate IPAS at Ser184 under these conditions.
  These events activate IPAS pro-apoptotic activity which leads to dopaminergic neuronal
  death in the SNpc (bottom). KD: kinase domain. Arrow tracks indicate signal transduction
  or IPAS translocation to nucleus/mitochondria. An up-arrow indicates high level
  of expression and activation.'
