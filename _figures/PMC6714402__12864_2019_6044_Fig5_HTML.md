caption: The networks of DEGs involved in estrogen (a) and prostaglandin (b) signaling
  pathways. The sources of co-expression, physical interactions, co-localization,
  pathway, shared protein domains, and genetic interactions were selected to weight
  the network. One edge indicates one source, and one node means one gene

  and between female and male porcine embryos.
