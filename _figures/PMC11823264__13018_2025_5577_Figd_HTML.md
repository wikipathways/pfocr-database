caption: JNK signaling pathway. JNK belongs to the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) family and can be activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including
  inflammatory factors (e.g., TNF-α and IL-1β), mechanical stress, and oxidative stress.
  These stimuli signal through small GTPases (e.g., Rac, Ras, and Cdc42), which activate
  upstream MAPKKKs (e.g., MEKK1-4) or mixed-spectrum kinases (MLKs), which in turn
  phosphorylate and activate MAPKKs (e.g., MKK4 and MKK7). TGF-β mediates the activation
  of JNK through TAK1 and MEKK, thereby regulating the activation of JNK through TAK1
  and MEKK, thereby regulating the inflammatory response and apoptosis. At the same
  time, it can alleviate the effects of oxidative damage on cells by regulating the
  generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and regulating apoptosis in synergy
  with the signaling of JNK. JNK can activate NF-κB and promote the generation of
  inflammatory factors, leading to a cellular inflammatory response and even apoptosis.
  Moreover, JNK can affect the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9) by regulating
  the TGF-β and NF-κB pathways, which can maintain the dynamic balance of ECM degradation
  and repair
