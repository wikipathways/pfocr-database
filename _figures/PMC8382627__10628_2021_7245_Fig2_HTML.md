caption: Signaling pathway of the unfolded protein response during simulation of hypoxia
  with CoCl2. Unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bind to the BiP
  protein, which releases the PERK, IRE1α, and ATF6 proteins. All three branches of
  this pathway are aimed at compensating for endoplasmic stress; however, upon failure
  of adaptation, they increase the expression of the proapoptotic transcription factor
  CHOP.
