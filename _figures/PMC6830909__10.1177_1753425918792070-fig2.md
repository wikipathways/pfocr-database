caption: 'The top three enriched networks of interacting proteins in SBDE-treated
  BEAS2B cells, as determined by IPA. These networks were defined as: (a) cell signaling,
  inflammatory response, antimicrobial response (score, 29; 17 differentially phosphorylated
  proteins); (b) Cell signaling, cellular function and maintenance, cell death and
  survival (score, 25; 15 differentially phosphorylated proteins); (c) Cell death
  and survival, organismal injury and abnormalities, gastrointestinal disease (score,
  25; 15 differentially phosphorylated proteins). Proteins represented in green (decreased)
  and red (increased) were differentially phosphorylated on the kinome array relative
  to control untreated cells. Proteins shown in white were not present in our data
  set but were added by IPA due to their connection to the enriched proteins. Scores
  were calculated from hypergeometric distribution and right-tailed Fisher’s exact
  test.SBDE: Swine Barn Dust Extracts; IPA: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.'
