caption: Genetic pathways implicated in vascular anomalies. The majority of identified
  mutations in vascular anomalies occur within two key intracellular signaling pathways—the
  RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is crucial for many
  cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, proliferation, and migration,
  and is often termed the “anti-apoptosis pathway.” Several activating mutations within
  this pathway are associated with vascular anomalies and complex vascular syndromes.
  The RAS/MAPK pathway is also crucial for cell cycle regulation, proliferation and
  migration, and is often referred to as the “proliferation pathway.” Several vascular
  anomalies are associated with mutations in this pathway and frequently termed “rasopathies.”
  There is also crosstalk between these 2 main pathways. The TGF-β Signaling Pathway
  is also key for regulation of numerous biological processes, has been implicated
  in the pathophysiology of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Each pathway and
  their overlap are demonstrated pictorially here. The known associations with vascular
  malformations and syndromes are highlighted in red.
