caption: 'Diagram of the Notch and APP signalling pathways. The diagram shows the
  possible common mechanisms between both pathways in controls (A) and patients with
  ALS (B). (A) Healthy control. In the Notch signalling pathway, Notch1 activation
  requires direct contact between the membranes of 2 cells. Once the receptor is active,
  the protein undergoes two consecutive cleavages by α-secretases (ADAM10 and ADAM17),
  followed by transmembrane cleavage by γ-secretases. NICD is internalised into the
  nucleus, activating transcription factors and promoting mechanisms of cell plasticity,
  proliferation, and neurogenesis. The APP signalling pathway may follow two routes.
  The non-amyloidogenic (neuroprotective) APP pathway: after α-secretase–mediated
  cleavage, γ-secretases generate AICD and decrease APP levels. Cytosolic adaptor
  protein Fe65 binds to AICD; this complex translocates to the nucleus where it interacts
  activating signalling to promotes neurite growth and cell plasticity. The second
  pathway is the amyloidogenic APP pathway, where APP is processed by α-secretase
  and γ-secretase, forming Aβ. AICD is also generated, which may activate NICD expression
  via the lysosomal system or interact with Fe65. Both pathways converge in the activation
  of substrates by α-secretases. (B) A possible pathogenic mechanism in ALS is increased
  Notch1 expression due to poor processing of α-secretases, given the competition
  between the Notch and APP pathways. This results in poor NICD activation, leading
  to transcription block and the subsequent decrease in plasticity, proliferation,
  and neurogenesis. In the APP pathway, the competition for α-secretases (ADAM10,
  ADAM17) causes β-secretase activation, leading to the formation of Aβ oligomers;
  Aβ plaque formation in the intracellular space generates AICD, directly affecting
  Fe65 expression. AICD and Fe65 form a complex that translocates to the nucleus,
  where it may activate the apoptotic pathway. Increased AICD expression and low Fe65
  activity may affect other lysosomal degradation pathways, increasing cytoplasmic
  TDP43 inclusions.'
