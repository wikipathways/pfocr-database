caption: a Chaperone-mediated autophagy degrades the LD coat proteins perilipin 2
  and perilipin 3 through the coordinated action of heat-shock cognate 71 kDa protein
  (HSC70) and receptor lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2A (LAMP2A). b Degradation
  of the LD coat proteins PLP2 and PLP3 allows lipase- and fat-soluble organelles
  to enter and undergo lipolysis. c Lipophagy induces engulfment of small cytoplasmic
  lipid droplets or large cytoplasmic lipid droplets by LC3-II-positive membranes.
  Lipid droplets are transported to lysosomes and degraded by lysosomal acid lipase
  (LAL). Rab7 promotes the decomposition of LDs by interacting with its downstream
  effector RILP. The fatty acids produced are mainly directed to the mitochondria
  to participate in the β-oxidation pathway.
