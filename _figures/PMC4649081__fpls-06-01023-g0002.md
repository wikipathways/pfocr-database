  root cap through the epidermis to the basal meristem and then back toward the root
  tip (). (A) Nitrate is reduced to nitrite by root nitrate reductase (NR). NO biosynthesis,
  mediated by NIA/NR- and AtNOA1 (Nitric Oxide-Associated1), is active and responsible
  for most of the NO production in Arabidopsis (). NO inhibits IAA oxidase, so reducing
  auxin degradation (). However, increased NO levels have an interfering effect on
  acropetal auxin transport through PIN1 auxin efflux carrier, which shows a good
  correlation with a reduction in auxin response (; ). NO also has a positive effect
  on auxin signaling by S-nitrosylation of the auxin receptor F-box protein TIR1 ().

  in the root n contributes to keep the gradients and maxima that are required to
