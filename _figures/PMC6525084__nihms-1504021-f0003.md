caption: 'A – In aDN-Disc1 mice exposed to Δ9-THC, there were 145 differentially expressed
  genes (FDR < 0.20; see circle at upper right). Over a third of the 145 genes (56,
  38.6%; see red shaded portion of circle) were synergistic (GxE) genes since they
  were not found to be differentially expressed by aDN-Disc1 or THC alone. Two of
  the genes (Ddit4, Sgk1) were also differentially expressed by aDN-Disc1 or THC alone,
  and 87 genes were differentially expressed by aDN-Disc1 alone. The oval represents
  six genes differentially expressed after THC treatment: three were differentially
  expressed in wild type mice, and three in the aDNn-Disc1 mice of which two were
  in aDNA-Disc1 mice treated with THC.B – GxE genes are enriched for membership in
  the NF-kB activation by viruses pathway (z-score = 2.00; p = 1.74E-03; BH-adjusted
  p-value [FDR] = 0.0253, 4 genes; all up-regulated: Akt2, Cd4, Itga5, and Prkch).'
