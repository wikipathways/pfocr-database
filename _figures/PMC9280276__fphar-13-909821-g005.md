caption: Ferroptosis and cancer metastasis. (1) Various changes in the E-cadherin-Merlin-Hippo-YAP
  axis are associated with ferroptosis. When E-cadherin, Merlin, and Hippo are inhibited,
  YAP is activated to further induce ferroptosis, while NF2/Merlin Deficiency drives
  cancer metastasis. (2) EMT is favorable to the survival of cancer cells and metastasis,
  which blocks E-cadherin-induced cell–cell interactions and activates YAP, thus leading
  to ferroptosis. MTDH contributes to ferroptosis by reducing intracellular GSH levels
  by downregulating GPX4 and SLC3A2. (3) HIF has a dual role in regulating ferroptosis
  in cancer cells. Activated HIF-2α upregulates lipid and iron-regulated genes and
  enhances lipid peroxidation of PUFAs, thus enhancing their sensitivity to ferroptosis.
  In contrast, it prevents ferroptosis in cancer cells by improving the cellular uptake
  of fatty acids and lipid storage by upregulating FABP3 and FABP7.
