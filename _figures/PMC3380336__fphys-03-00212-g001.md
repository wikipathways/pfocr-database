caption: Regulation of ENaC and NCC by Nedd4-2. (A) Under resting conditions, Nedd4-2
  inhibits ENaC and NCC, as does WNK4, ensuring no excess Na+ (and fluid) reabsorption
  takes place, especially in the kidney. An alternative model suggests that WNK4 activates
  NCC to a low degree by activating the kinases SPAK and OSR1, which then phosphorylate
  (P) NCC. WNK4 also inhibits the K+ channel ROMK, to restrain K+ excretion. (B) In
  Liddle syndrome, PY motif mutations in ENaC prevent Nedd4-2 from properly binding
  and suppressing ENaC, thus leading to increased ENaC abundance/function and excessive
  Na+ (and fluid) reabsorption in the kidney, causing hypertension. (C) Removal of
  Nedd4-2 in lung epithelia by gene knockout in mice leads to cystic fibrosis – like
  lung disease due to excessive abundance/function of ENaC. (D) Aldosterone (or Angiotensin
  II, AngII?) stimulation of Sgk1 leads to Sgk1-mediated phosphorylation of Nedd4-2
  on two sites, thus preventing Nedd4-2 from suppressing NCC and ENaC. This results
  in increased abundance/function of these Na+ absorbing proteins. In addition, phosphorylation
  of WNK4 by Sgk1 interferes with the ability of WNK4 to inhibit ENaC. Collectively,
  this leads to aldosterone-mediated increased in Na+ and fluid reabsorption in the
  kidney, hence to elevated blood pressure. (E) In PHAII, WNK4 mutants either divert
  NCC to the recycling pathway instead of lysosomal degradation, and/or enhance phosphorylation
  (and activation) of SPAK/OSR1 and hence of NCC. Both of these effects, coupled with
  loss of inhibition of ENaC by WNK4, lead to increased Na+ reabsorption (and paracellular
  Cl− permeability) in the kidney, and hence to increased fluid absorption and hypertension.
  Mutant WNK4 also strongly suppresses ROMK, preventing K+ excretion and causing hyperkalemia.
  (F) Knockout of Nedd4-2 in the distal nephron leads to increased abundance and activation
  of NCC (and ENaC), causing hypertension and possibly mimicking features of PHAII.
