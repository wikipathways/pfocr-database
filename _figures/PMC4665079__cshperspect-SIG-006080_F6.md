caption: The autophagic signaling pathway. Under metabolic stress, AMPK activation
  and/or mTORC1 inhibition lead to the activation of the preinitiation complex (ULK1,
  FIP200, and ATG13). The latter activates the initiation complex (beclin 1, VPS15,
  and VPS34) that generates PI3P and recruits ATG7 to the phagophore. ATG7 functions
  similarly to an E1-ubiquitin ligase and initiates two conjugation pathways necessary
  for membrane elongation and closure of the autophagosome. In the ATG5-ATG12 conjugation
  pathway, ATG12 is sequentially transferred to ATG7, ATG10, and ATG12. The ATG5-12
  conjugate recruits ATG16L and forms a complex necessary to stabilize the phagophore
  and to complete the second conjugation pathway. In the LC3-PE pathway, LC3 is cleaved
  by ATG4 and sequentially conjugated to ATG7 and ATG3. The ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L complex
  carries out the final step by transferring LC3 to PE to form an LC3-PE conjugate
  (also called LC3-II). LC3-II associates with the autophagosomal membrane and is
  crucial for the targeting of autophagosomes to lysosomes, as well as for the selective
  autophagy of organelles and protein aggregates.
