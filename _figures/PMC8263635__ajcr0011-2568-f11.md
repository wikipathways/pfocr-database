caption: Schematic illustration of the regulatory pathway by ELOVL2. The uptake ratio
  of Tam across plasma membrane in MCF-7/TamR cells is similar to that in the parental
  MCF-7 cells. ERa and ELOVL2 crosstalk to regulate each other. ELOVL2 blocks the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway via inhibiting THEM4 and PI3K. In TamR cancer, ELOVL2 is downregulated
  by hypermethylation, resulting in loss of inactivation of AKT and also downstream
  genes such as CREB and mTOR, or activation of downstream genes such as BMF, eventually
  leading to Tam resistance and increased cell proliferation.
