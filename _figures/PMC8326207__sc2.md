caption: Pathway diagram showing the formation and oxidation of long-chain EOS species
  in human skin. The same enzymes will be responsible for metabolizing EOH and EOP
  isomers. Gene names in red are all significantly elevated in human psoriatic lesions.
  EOH, hydroxysphingosine; EOP, phytosphingosine; EOS, esterified omega-hydroxy sphingosine.
