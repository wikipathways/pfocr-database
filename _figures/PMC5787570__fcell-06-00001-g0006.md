caption: Inclusion membrane proteins and secreted effectors from C. trachomatis co-opt
  host vesicular trafficking pathways to promote inclusion development. Chlamydia
  trachomatis replicates in a parasitophorous vacuole, termed the inclusion. Early
  in the infection cycle the inclusion is modified through the incorporation of type
  III secreted effector proteins known as inclusion membrane proteins (Incs). IncA
  possesses 2 coiled-coil domains that are homologous to eukaryotic SNARE motifs and
  these domains are required to mediate homotypic fusion of inclusions. IncA is also
  able to interact with VAMP8 on lysosomes and may prevent inclusion fusion with lysosomes.
  C. trachomatis manipulates and recruits Rab and Arf GTPases to the inclusion membrane
  through interactions with the inclusion membrane proteins CT229 and CT813, respectively.
  While the mechanism of CT229-Rab interactions is ill-defined, CT813 is presumed
  to modulate Arf GTPases to control Golgi ministack positioning by regulating microtubule
  posttranslational modification. IncE interacts with SNX5/6, components of the retromer
  complex, to disrupt trafficking to the trans-Golgi network and to promote chlamydial
  infection. To acquire the sphingomyelin precursor ceramide, IncD interacts with
  the Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of CERT allowing ceramide to be directly transferred
  from the ER to the inclusion membrane. C. trachomatis also secretes a large repertoire
  of type III proteins into the eukaryotic cells. CT619, CT620, CT621, CT711, CT712
  are type III substrates that interact with Hrs and/or Tsg101, components of the
  ESCRT pathway.
