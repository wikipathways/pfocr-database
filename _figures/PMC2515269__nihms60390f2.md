caption: If 4 is indeed a precursor of the polycyclic aglycone and the cross–bridging
  reactions are all post-cyclization events, oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl group of
  4 to a keto group (4 → 5), and deprotonation at C-14 to form the C-3/C-14 linkage
  (5 → 6 → 7) likely occur first (, route A). Subsequent deprotonation at C-14 of
  7 and elimination of the 11-hydroxyl group to give 8 is expected to trigger the
  second cross-coupling reaction (8 → 9) to produce the as-indacene core. However,
  it is also possible that the initial oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl group takes place
  on the linear precursor 3 when it is still linked to the acyl carrier protein (ACP)
  associated with the polyketide synthase SpnE (, route B). The keto product 10 is
  next cleaved from ACP catalyzed by a thioesterase (TE) to give 5, which then undergoes
  sequential cyclizations in a similar manner as described above. In this pathway,
  compound 4 is bypassed.
