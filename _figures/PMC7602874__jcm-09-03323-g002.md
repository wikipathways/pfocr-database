caption: A schematic diagram of the role of the cGAS-STING pathway in cancer immunity.
  cGAMP can be recognised by host immune cells, notably DCs and NK cells (1) [,,].
  cGAS is constitutively active in most tumour cells and results in the production
  of cGAMP which can be internalised by NK cells and immature DCs through the folate
  transporter SLC19A1 (2). This results in the activation of cGAS-STING in these cells
  (3) []. In NK cells, the STING-dependent production of Type I IFNs (4) enhances
  NK cell cytotoxicity and subsequent tumour cell lysis (5) [,,]. Immature DCs can
  be activated and mature through the recognition, uptake and processing of tumour
  antigens (6) as well as by pro-inflammatory cytokines produced as a result of cGAMP
  uptake and subsequent cGAS-STING activation (7) [,,]. The mature/activated DCs display
  antigens via MHC molecules (8) and present them to T cells in the lymph node, potentiating
  T cell differentiation into CTLs or Th cells (9). The primed CTLs the migrate to
  and infiltrate the tumour site (10) resulting in cancer cell death and the release
  of more tumour antigens, perpetuating the cancer-immunity cycle (11) []. This is
