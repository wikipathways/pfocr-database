caption: Elevated EREG expression in certain cell types may alter tumorigenesis and
  therapeutic response in the tumor microenvironment. (A) Inter-tumor heterogeneity
  may hinder the therapeutic efficiency of anti-EGFR treatments in head and neck squamous
  cell carcinomas (HNSCC). This may be caused by the dysregulated expression of factors,
  such as EREG, involved in the EGFR signaling pathway. Notably, basal-like cell lines
  are more sensitive to EGFR blockade alone or in combination with treatments targeting
  MEK, mTOR, or ERBB2. Additionally, EREG expression may be a predictive functional
  marker of anti-EGFR therapy in basal-like HNSCC. (B) The local resident normal fibroblasts
  (NFs) are converted to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in oral squamous cell
  carcinoma (OSCC), which exhibit tumor-supportive properties. EREG is the most remarkably
  upregulated gene in CAFs. Overexpression of EREG in NFs activated the CAF phenotype.
  Mechanistically, the JAK2/STAT3 pathway was enhanced by EREG in parallel with increased
  IL-6 expression. IL-6 induced the JAK2/STAT3/EREG pathway in a feedback loop. Moreover,
  EREG-induced CAF activation promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  necessary for migration and invasion, which depends on JAK2/STAT3 signaling and
  IL-6. (C) Among EGFR ligands, EREG significantly reduces the sensitivity of cells
  to EGFR TKI, which may be correlated with the resistance to erlotinib in NSCLC patients.
  EREG induces AKT phosphorylation in an ERBB2-dependent manner and attenuates TKI-induced
  apoptosis. Regardless of treatment, EREG induces the formation of EGFR/ERBB2 heterodimers.
  However, overexpression or knockdown of EREG in cancer cells has little effect on
  TKI sensitivity. EREG-rich macrophage conditioned medium induces EGFR-TKI resistance.
  (D) Rab27b mediates radioresistance in highly malignant glioblastoma (GBM) cells.
  In addition, Rab27b promotes the proliferation of neighboring cells through EREG-mediated
  paracrine signals after irradiation.
