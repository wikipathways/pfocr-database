caption: Illustration of the contribution of liver and gut microbiome to the BA metabolism
  dysregulation associates with cancer cachexia. Liver health, BA profile, and gut
  microbiota composition are closely connected. On the one hand, in liver, BA synthesis
  decreases while the conjugation of BAs is enhanced in the development of cancer
  cachexia. On the other hand, in intestine, there is microbiota dysbiosis which resulted
  in decrease in the microbial metabolism of BAs. Change in intestine BA profile induced
  activation of intestine‐specific FXR signalling pathway thus produces FGF15 to inhibit
  expression of BA synthesis enzymes and modification enzymes in liver. Expression
  of BA transporters in intestine and liver was also changed by FXR signalling pathway
  or other BA metabolism‐related signalling pathways. Importantly, there are feedback
  mechanisms in BA metabolism regulation and possible compensatory mechanisms in the
  development of cancer cachexia; thus; the BA metabolism might be dynamically changed
  in the different stages of cancer cachexia. BA, bile acid.
