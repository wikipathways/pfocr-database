caption: 'The ocular sensory pathway. The stroma of the cornea contains a dense network
  of nerve fibers expressing: mechanoreceptors, polymodal receptors and cold receptors.
  Following damage to the corneal epithelium, inflammatory mediators are released
  and immune cells are recruited to the site of injury. These inflammatory mediators
  include: cytokines, H+, ATP, adenosine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, bradykinin,
  5-HT, platelet-activating factor, histamine and neuropeptides, all of which contribute
  to the alteration in nociceptive signaling by activating Transient receptor protein
  (TRP) channels of nociceptors, which are responsible for nociceptor signaling (;
  ; ; ; ). These first order neurons project to the trigeminal ganglion and synapse
  with second order neurons in the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis before projecting
  to the spinothalamic pathways and the thalamus or the periaqueductal gray (PAG).
  Third order neurons from the thalamus relay information to the somatosensory cortex
  and paralimbic region, while those from the PAG modulate trigeminal activity (;
  ; ; ). Activation of this pathway contributes to hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain
  by sensitizing corneal nociceptors. Chronic neuropathic pain results after the initial
  lesion has healed and occurs due to a decreased threshold of stimulation, spontaneous
  depolarization of nociceptors and altered excitability of voltage gated channels
  which modulate excitability of polymodal nociceptors. Reproduced and adapted with
