caption: 'ASN toxicity on S1P metabolism and action. Orange arrows terminating with
  → (activation), or ┴ (inhibition/deterioration) mark alpha-synuclein (ASN) toxic
  effects. This includes promotion in palmitate uptake [], which may increase ceramide
  synthesis (bright blue), inhibition of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) [,,] (regular
  blue), as well as expulsion of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor (S1P1) from
  lipids rafts, and suppression of inhibitory G (Gi) protein [,] (navy blue). ASN
  acts in opposition with S1P in an intracellular and receptor-dependent effect on
  mitochondrial homeostasis (bright green), including inhibition/up-regulation of
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) [,].
  S1P may also regulate assembly of complex IV of respiratory chain by interaction
  with mitochondrial protein prohibitin 2 (PHB2) []. Pathogenic ASN and S1P inhibit
  and activate, respectively, the Akt kinase (serine/threonine protein kinase B)/brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway [,,,] (regular green). S1P inhibits
  histone deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and HDAC2), thus enhancing histone acetylation
  [], while ASN hinders access of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) by interacting
  with histone H3 [] (dark green). Remaining abbreviations: CoA—coenzyme A; SPT—serine
  palmitoyl transferase; CER—ceramide; SPH—sphingosine; CERS—ceramide synthase; SPP—S1P
  phosphatase; S1P1–5—sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. Please note that sphingosine
  kinase was abbreviated Sphk1, which is an isoform down-regulated by ASN. However,
  S1P acting intracellularly on PHB2 and HDACs is synthesized by Sphk2 isoform [].'
