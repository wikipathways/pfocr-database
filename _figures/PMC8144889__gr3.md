caption: Summary of therapeutic strategies to target the NCC via its regulatory pathway.
  Over activation of the Na+–Cl– co-transporter (NCC) leads to salt retention and
  hypertension. The CUL3/KLHL3–WNK–SPAK/OSR1 regulatory pathway of NCC (black arrows)
  presents 6 points of interventions. Red arrows represent the therapeutic inhibition
  of 1) NCC, 2) WNK, 3) SPAK, 4) MO25, and 5) WNK–SPAK/OSR1 interactions which would
  all suppress NCC activation. The green arrow represents 6) the stabilisation of
  CUL3/KLHL3 interactions which would increase degradation of WNK and thus suppress
  NCC activation by the WNK–SPAK/OSR1 pathway. Glycosylation of the NCC is critical
  for the function and trafficking of NCC to the plasma membrane and thus (7) impairment
  of glycosylation could also suppress NCC activity and potentially be therapeutic.
