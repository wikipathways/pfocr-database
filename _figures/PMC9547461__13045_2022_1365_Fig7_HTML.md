caption: 'Adverse effects of chemotherapy drugs and nonchemotherapy drugs in pyroptosis
  pathway. a Tissue damage: pyroptosis triggered by chemotherapy drugs in normal cells
  with high GSDME-expression contributes to their cytotoxicity mainly via GSDME-mediated
  pyroptosis. b Cytokine storm: immune cells like CD8 + T cells and NK cells release
  a large amount of perforin, GzmA and GzmB, thus promoting pyroptosis and pore-forming
  process. Cytokines like IL-1β, IL-18, ATP, LDH, and HMGB1 are released into the
  intercellular substance which subsequently activate immune cells, resulting in severe
  positive feedback regulatory between immune response and pyroptosis. Activation
  of pyroptosis in macrophages can release IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α, thus further exacerbating
  cytokine storm'
