caption: Schematic representation of the molecular mechanisms involved in PAC1R mediated
  neurotrophic effect. The stimulation of PAC1R by PACAP activates the protein kinase
  A (PKA) signaling pathway, which can potentiate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors
  and/or induce downstream the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK). In both cases, CAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is activated
  and enhances brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) transcription. Increased BDNF
  protein levels activate the TrkB receptor, which can also be potentiated by PKA.
  Finally, TrkB associated trophic signaling pathways promote neuronal survival, differentiation,
  and synaptic plasticity.
