caption: A schematic model for the Nedd8-mediated activation of the DNA damage-inducible
  FANCD2 monoubiquitination. While interruption of the Nedd8 conjugation system suppresses
  the ATR-mediated signaling pathways, particularly CHK1 phosphorylation and FANCD2
  monoubiquitination, ATM-mediated pathways or PCNA ubiquitination remain unaffected.
  We hypothesize that specific protein neddylation events, most likely the activation
  of specific CRL E3 ligases, is required for damage-inducible CHK1 phosphorylation
  and FANCD2 monoubiquitination. We suggest that disruption in the CRL-mediated destruction
  of FANCM is one mechanism leading to the abrogation of the FA pathway.
