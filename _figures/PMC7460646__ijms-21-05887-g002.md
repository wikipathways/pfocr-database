caption: Inflammation contributes to leptin resistance in the brain at the hypothalamic
  arcuate nucleus, and as a result, alters food intake and energy expenditure leading
  to obesity. Adipocytes and central nervous system (CNS) cells interact via several
  secreted factors. In obesity, the adipose tissue is characterized by hypertrophy
  and increased infiltration of macrophages and other immune cells. The metabolic
  consequences of adipose tissue dysfunction are an increased synthesis of proinflammatory
  cytokines and adipokines, such as leptin, which impair adipocyte function. This
  adipose tissue dysfunction leading to chronic inflammation, not only at the local
  level but also at the brain level. Moreover, inflammation produced by chronic infection
  and autoimmune diseases contribute to leptin resistance. Recruitment and activation
  of NF-KB signaling molecules by proinflammatory cytokines induce SOCS3 and protein
  tyrosine phosphatases-1B (PTP1B), which are involved in a negative feed-back loop
  to block LEPR signaling via the JAK/STAT pathway and promoting leptin resistance.
