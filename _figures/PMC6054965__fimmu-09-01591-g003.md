caption: Schematic representation of hypoxia upregulating immunosuppressive adenosine
  signaling pathway in cancer cells. Under hypoxic conditions, the upregulation of
  CD39 and CD79 expressions lead to increase of adenosine, which has been shown to
  have immunosuppressive effects on Teff, DC, and NK cells.
