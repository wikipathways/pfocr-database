caption: Signal Transduction pathways downstream of activated HER family of receptors.
  Two kinds of cell survival strategies that operate downstream of activated HER family
  of tyrosine kinases (represented as homo and hetero dimers) with the cascade of
  signaling events with some of the key signaling components are shown. The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK
  pathway is shown in the left and phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase PI3K-AKT pathway
  is shown in the right. The key points along the pathway that can have targeted inhibition
  are depicted with a “star”. ERK- Extracellular Regulated kinase, GRB2- Growth Factor
  receptor bound protein 2, mTOR- mammalian target of Rapamycin
