caption: 'ELE enhanced 5-FU effect through different molecular pathways.Notes: In
  apoptosis pathway, ELE and 5-FU synergistically inhibited Bcl-2, increased Bax due
  to which the cyt-c was released from the mitochondria to cytoplasm where they increased
  the cl-caspase-3 and cl-parp expression levels due to which cell the apoptosis happened.
  NF-kB/COX-2 pathway ELE and 5-FU synergistically downregulated the expression IKKβ,
  IKKα and p65 in cytoplasm due to which the translocation of p50 and p65 decreased
  and led to COX-2 expression downregulation and cell inhibition. The activity of
  PI3K/AKT pathway were also inhibited by ELE and 5-FU in combination through the
  inhibition of p-AKT, P-85, p110r, p-PDK1, and p110a proteins, thereby causing triple-negative
  cancer inhibition. ELE and 5-FU in combination modulated the MAPK pathway through
  p-38 upregulation and c-raf and ERK downregulation, thereby inhibiting sphere formation
  through CD44, OCT4, and Nanog. Cell invasion was promoted through E-cadherin upregulation
  and N-cadherin downregulation. ELE and 5-FU also in combination inhibit cell migration
  through MMP-9 and vimentin downregulation. The modulation of all of these pathways
  showed that ELE and 5-FU in combination inhibit triple-negative TNBC.'
