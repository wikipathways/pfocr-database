caption: Proposed model of body size regulation by the DBL-1 pathway and dpy body
  size–associated genes in C. elegans. Within the sending cell, DBL-1 may be modified
  by DPY-19/C-mannosyltransferase and transported by the AP2 complex, which includes
  the DPY-23/AP2 mu subunit. Signaling through the receptor complex may also be controlled
  by DPY-23. DBL-1 signaling directly controls the expression of cuticle components,
  which affects body size (arrow 1). DPY-11/disulfide oxidoreductase may process DBL-1-regulated
  cuticle components before secretion. DBL-1–regulated gene expression, in part through
  BLMP-1, may modulate signaling within the receiving cell (arrow 2) or between the
  sending and receiving cells (arrow 3), or may feed back on the sending cell (arrow
  4). Cues from the receiving cell or cuticle may be received (indirectly) by the
  sending cell and affect DBL-1 expression or secretion (arrow 5) or affect signaling
  downstream of DBL-1 secretion (starred arrowhead in arrow 5 and starred DPY collagens).
  Other cell-signaling pathways act independent of DBL-1 to control body size (arrow
  6). Dashed lines represent potential indirect regulation. dpy gene products that
  had no effect on DBL-1 signaling are not included in this model.
