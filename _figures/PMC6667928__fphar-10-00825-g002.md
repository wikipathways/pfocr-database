caption: Pivotal functions of the molecules in heme metabolic pathway in inflammation.
  Free heme is transported by an unknown transporter into intracellular side. Heme
  can activate spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and subsequently induce reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) generation. Furthermore, heme can activate Toll-like receptor4 (TLR4)
  inducing ROS production dependent on NADPH oxidase and promoting proinflammatory
  cytokines [e.g., tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)] generation. HO-1 have immunomodulatory
  effects in dendritic cells (DCs), antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and regulatory
  T cells. In heme metabolic pathway, the end product ferrous iron (Fe2+) is proinflammatory
  and could be sequestered by iron storage protein ferritin. The ferritin inhibits
  interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IgG production. In addition, it is involved in mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. CO downregulates the production of proinflammatory
  cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6) and upregulates the anti-proinflammatory cytokines
  (e.g., IL-10) relating to MAPK signaling pathway. CO inhibits ROS generation and
  regulates inflammasome activation followed by impacting IL-1β maturation and secretion.
  Of note, CO could augment the interaction between caveolin-1 (cav-1) and TLR4 suppressing
  TLR4-mediated signaling. BV/BR exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects
  about innate and adaptive immunity. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokine
  TNF-α can be secreted into extracellular side. TNF-α binds to its receptor inducing
  necrosis mediated by receptor-interacting protein (RIP1/3).
