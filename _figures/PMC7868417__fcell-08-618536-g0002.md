caption: miRNAs modulate monocyte/macrophage function to affect inflammation in DN.
  In the diabetic state, chronic hyperglycaemia activates NF-κB through multiple intracellular
  signaling pathways, such as ROS/NO, AGE-RAGE, the Hexo/Poly pathway, and the PKC
  pathway. Then, NF-κB moves into the nucleus to enhance the expression of several
  pro-inflammatory genes (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-18). These pro-inflammatory cytokines
  contribute to M1 macrophage polarization and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, causing
  macrophage infiltration and renal inflammation. NF-κB binds to the 3′-UTR of miR-146a
  to promote its transactivation, and upon processing and maturation, miR-146a enters
  the cytoplasm and prevents the translation of IRAK1 and TRAF6 mRNAs. Both IRAK1
  and TRAF6 activate IKKs, which in turn phosphorylate IκB to release NF-κB. Subsequently,
  the released NF-κB reduces inflammation to ameliorate diabetic renal inflammation.
