caption: Vitamin D synthesis pathway. The figure depicts the synthesis of vitamin
  D and its metabolites derived by ergosterol and cholesterol. CYP24A1 = cytochrome
  P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1, also named 25(OH)-D 24-hydroxylase; CYP27A1
  = cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily A member 1, also named sterol 27-hydroxylase;
  CYP27B1 = cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily B member 1, also named 25(OH)-D 1α-hydroxylase;
  CYP2R1 = cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily R member 1, also named vitamin D 25-hydroxylase;
  DBP = vitamin D binding protein; UVB = ultraviolet B; VDR = vitamin D receptor
