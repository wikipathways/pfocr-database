caption: Pathogenesis of antibody‐mediated rejection and potential therapeutic targets.
  A primary trigger of B cell alloimmunity may be the interaction of follicular T
  helper cells with naive B cells. This leads to B cell proliferation and differentiation,
  and the generation of B memory cells and antibody‐producing plasma cells. Binding
  of alloantibodies to the endothelium may trigger direct signalling, induce Fc gamma
  receptor (FcγR) dependent cellular effects, such as natural killer (NK) cell (and
  macrophage) activation, and trigger complement activation via the classical pathway
  (CP). Costimulation blockers, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that target the interleukin‐6
  (IL‐6)/IL‐6 receptor (IL‐6R) axis, or B lymphocyte stimulator may prevent proper
  B cell activation/differentiation and affect the generation or integrity of plasma
  cells. IL‐6 antagonists may also enhance the formation of regulatory T cells. Proteasome
  inhibitors and CD38 mAb may deplete alloantibody‐producing plasma cells, the latter
  affecting also NK cells and regulatory T cells. Complement inhibitors and membrane
  filtration target the C1 complex, a key component of the CP, or by interference
  with the terminal component C5 (eculizumab), the formation of the membrane attack
  complex and anaphylatoxin C5a. The mode of action of intravenous immunoglobulin
  is multifaceted and may include interference with B and T cell activation, antibody
  formation and recycling, as well as complement activation.
