caption: 'Role of 4-HNE in aging-related diseases. AD and PD: 4-HNE induces protein
  aggregation, abnormal aggregates of Aβ forms SP, and hyperphosphorylation of tau
  protein to form NFTs, which eventually leads to AD; aggregates of α-synuclein form
  Lewy body-like inclusions leading to PD. ARHL: 4-HNE (1) causes DNA damage; (2)
  increases p21, p38, and p-p38 activity; (3) reduces p19 and BubR1 activity. Cancer:
  4-HNE (1) causes DNA damage; (2) affects protein function; (3) directly modifies
  cysteine residues (Cys 513, 518) on KEAP1, thus leading to KEAP1/Nrf2 pathway activation
  and increases the expression levels of Nrf2-ARE target genes, thus, activating the
  antioxidant-related pathways to influence cancer progression. AMD: 4-HNE (1) causes
  DNA damage; (2) activates NF-κB, p53, Caspase-3, and NOX4 activity, thereby, inducing
  retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) apoptosis.'
