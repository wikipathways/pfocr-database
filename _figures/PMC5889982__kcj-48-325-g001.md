caption: β-arr is a potential therapeutic target for various diseases. (A) β-arr signaling
  in cancer cells. When a peptide such a obestatin binds to a receptor, phosphorylation
  of GPCR occurs leading to the attraction of β-arr. β-arr is then translocated which
  allows for its association with Src. The β-arr/Src interaction results in EGFR transactivation
  and Akt signaling. (B) β-arr signaling in mature cardiac cells. Catecholamines (e.g.,
  epinephrine) can elicit a reaction through G-protein signaling or through β-arr2-mediated
  signaling which leads to improved cardiac response and contractility. Wound-healing
  associated inflammation also occurs via NF-κB pathway as activated by β-arr2, which
  are essential to preservation of cardiac function post-MI. (C) β-arr signaling in
  cancer stem cells. When CXCL12 binds to CXCR7, β-arr pathway is activated through
  GRK to internalize CXCR7 resulting in CXCL12 scavenging. It can also signal PLC
  to activate ERK 1/2 which leads to cell survival in certain cancer cells (for example,
  glioblastoma). (D) β-arr signaling in metoprolol-mediated cardiac fibrosis. Cardiac
  fibrosis induced by metoprolol via GRK5/β-arr2 is fairly miniscule compared to the
  fibrosis caused by heart failure. In addition, β-blocking capacity by metoprolol
  induces a positive action that can overshadow the fibrosis induced. (E) Possible
  β-arr signaling in cardiac progenitor cells. β-arr2 can affect expression of β-catenin
  via PI3K/GSK-3β signaling, resulting in cell survival brought about by regulation
  of cell mobility and tube formation. An alternative pathway can trigger β-arr-dependent
  ERK signaling via ERK 1/2.AC = adenylyl cyclase; Akt = protein kinase B; ATP = adenosine
