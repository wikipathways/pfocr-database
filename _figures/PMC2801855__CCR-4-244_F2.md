caption: NO activates sGC, and produced cGMP regulates PKG, PDE2, PDE3, and/or protein
  phosphatase (PPase). NO also induces protein s-nitrosylation. ICa,L suppression
  by progesterone is via the sGC/cGMP pathway, while IKs activation is via the protein
  s-nitrosylation. Inset shows the antagonistic action between cAMP and cGMP for ICa,L
  regulation. It has been reported that in rabbit and frog ventricular myocytes, it
  occurs at the PDE2 level, while in guinea-pig and rat ventricular myocytes, it occurs
  at the PKG level []. The inhibition of PDE3 by cGMP and the activation of PPase
  by cGMP/PKG signaling pathway may also be involved.
