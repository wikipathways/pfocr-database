caption: Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) mediates effects on multiple metabolic pathways
  in a tissue-specific manner. In the liver, FXR reduces conversion of cholesterol
  to bile acids by downregulating the expression of enzymes involved in bile acid
  synthesis, such as cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1) and CYP8B1. FXR also reduces bile
  acid toxicity in the liver by increasing other bile acid-modifying enzymes including
  sulphotransferase 2A1 (SULT2A1), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B4 (UGT2B4) and CYP3A4.
  Bile acids are conjugated to either glycine or taurine before secretion into the
  bile; FXR enhances bile acid conjugation by increasing the expression of bile acid
  CoA synthase (BACS) and bile acid CoA–amino acid N-acetyltransferase (BAAT), and
  FXR promotes the transport of bile acids to the gall bladder via bile salt export
  pump (BSEP), multidrug resistance protein 2 (MDR2) and MDR3 (membrane transport
  proteins are depicted as ovals). Within the intestine, FXR reduces bile acid absorption
  via downregulation of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT),
  promotes bile acid movement across the enterocyte via ileal bile acid binding-protein
  (IBABP) and promotes recycling of bile acids to the liver via organic solute transporter-α
  (OSTα) and OSTβ. In addition, FXR reduces hepatic uptake of bile acids by reducing
  the expression of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) and sodium taurocholate
  cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). FXR also promotes the release of fibroblast growth
  factor 15 (FGF15) in mice or FGF19 in humans from the intestine. FGF15 or FGF19
  travel to the liver, acting on FGF4 receptor (FGF4R) to reduce CYP7A1 expression
  and thus repress bile acid synthesis. In the liver, FXR also acts on glucose metabolism
  by reducing gluconeogenesis via the downregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
  (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), two key enzymes in the glucose synthesis
  pathway. Futhermore, FXR reduces lipogenesis via inhibition of sterol-regulatory
  element-binding protein 1C (SREBP1C) and fatty acid synthase (FAS).
