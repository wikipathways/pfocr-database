caption: MCTs mediate the lactate exchanges between glia and neurons in the brain.
  Astrocyte, oligodendrocytes, and microglia are highly glycolytic cells that take
  up circulating glucose through glucose transporters (GLUTs; GLUT1 for astrocytes
  and oligodendrocytes, and GLUT1 and GLUT5 for microglia). GLUT3 facilitates neuronal
  uptake of glucose. The glucose is metabolized to pyruvate using glycolysis, and
  pyruvate to lactate using a glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Although
  unknown for microglia, astrocyte and oligodendrocyte-derived intracellular lactate
  is transported to neurons through a pathway involving monocarboxylic acid transporters,
  MCT1/4 and MCT2, as depicted in figure. Gly, glycolysis; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
