caption: The correlation of HDAC7 and three signaling pathways. (A) The schematic
  demonstrates the correlation of HDAC7 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. HDAC7
  facilitates β-catenin redistribution to the nucleus by deacetylating β-catenin and
  inhibiting its phosphorylation, which results in that the nuclear accumulation of
  β-catenin binds to TCF/LEF to activate related gene expression. Wnt5A promotes the
  expression of HDAC7 and exerts synergistic effects on the activation of Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. (B) The schematic shows the correlation of HDAC7 and PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway. HDAC7 can directly promote the expression of PI3K and AKT proteins and
  decrease the expression of PTEN the repressor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  to trigger the activation of the signaling transduction. (C) The schematic shows
  the correlation of HDAC7 and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. HDAC7 inhibits phosphorylation
  of STAT3 by deacetylating STAT3 and downregulating the expression of the protein
  kinase JAK1 to repress the activation of the signaling pathway
