caption: 'The phenylpropanoid pathway leads to the biosynthesis of both canonical
  (no background) and non-canonical monolignols (light yellow background), while other
  non-canonical monolignols are produced through different but connected pathways
  (pink background). Phenylalanine (Phe) is sequentially converted to p-coumaryl alcohol
  (H unit) by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate:CoA
  ligase (4CL), cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR), and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase
  (CAD). p-coumaric acid (red circle) is the ‘hinge’ of all these biosynthetic paths,
  since not only it is the precursor of p-coumaryl alcohol, but directly (via p-coumarate
  3-hydroxylase, C3H) or through p-coumaryl-CoA (the so-called shikimate shunt (blurred
  red arrow). Enzymes involved: p-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:quinate/shikimate (HCT), p-coumaroyl
  shikimate 3-hydrolase (C3′H), and caffeoyl shikimate esterase (CSE)) also lead to
  the production of caffeic acid and then to that of all non-canonical phenylpropanoid
  monolignols. There, multiple and redundant pathways lead to coniferyl (G unit) and
  sinapyl alcohols (S unit) and involve caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT), caffeoyl-CoA
  O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), and ferulate 5-hydroxylase (F5H). Please note that
  among the non-canonical, phenylpropanoid-derived monolignols here we consider also
  compounds absent in , such as ferulic acid (used in the formation of polysaccharide-lignin
  complexes, see later) or dihydroconiferyl alcohol, which is present in the lignin
  of CAD-deficient trees []. PMT: p-coumaroyl-CoA monolignol transferase (PMT). FMT:
  feruloyl-CoA with feruloyl-CoA monolignol transferase. For the non-phenylpropanoid
  pathway, hydroxystilbenes are produced through stilbene synthase (STS), and flavonoids
  are produced through chalcone synthase (CHS), whereas hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:tyramine
  N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (THT) and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:putrescine hydroxycinnamoyltransferase
  (PHT), respectively, mediate the biosynthesis of diferuloylputrescine and of feruloyltyramine.'
