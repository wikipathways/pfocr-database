caption: Examples of functional networks of regulated genes shared by different tissues.
  The 147 differentially expressed genes commonly listed in longissimus muscle, liver,
  perirenal and subcutaneous adipose tissues were submitted to Ingenuity速 Pathway
  Analysis to visualize small networks of co-expressed genes. Highly-interconnected
  non-redundant networks were released from specified genes (represented as nodes)
  and relationships (represented as edges) between them or with neighboring genes
  were established based on literature records in the Ingenuity速 Pathway Knowledge
  Base. This allows identifying functional networks related to response to oxidative
  stress, apoptosis, immunity and(or) protein metabolism. Two small functional networks
  are shown. More networks can be viewed in Additional files  and . a Relationships
  through low density lipoproteins (LDL), between SOD2 and PON1 (response to oxidative
  stress), IL1 and CTSC (immunity) and NTN1 (apoptosis). b Relationship between different
  molecules acting in protein translation (RPL6, RPL14), protein catabolism (PSMA3,
  26S proteasome, and heat-shock proteins HSP70) and protein transport (YWHAZ)
