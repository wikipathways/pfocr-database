caption: The signal pathways involved in the microglia phenotypic transition. Several
  signal pathways are involved in the regulation of the microglia phenotypic transformation,
  mainly including the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, NLR pathway and JAK/STAT pathway. Additionally,
  AMPK pathway and MAPK pathway can also affect the microglia phenotypic transition.
  These pathways influence neuroinflammation by regulating the microglia phenotypic
  transition, thus influencing the occurrence, development, and prognosis of CNS diseases.
