caption: Mechanism of the cGAS-STING Signaling Pathway in Lung Cancer Immunotherapy
  (By figdraw). When cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is recognized by cyclic
  GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), cGAS catalyzes the production of the second messenger molecule,
  cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). cGAMP activates the STING protein located on the endoplasmic
  reticulum membrane, which subsequently recruits and phosphorylates the kinase TBK1
  and the transcription factor IRF3. Phosphorylated IRF3, together with NF-κB, translocates
  into the nucleus, initiating the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, thereby activating the innate immune response. The activation of this
  pathway is regulated by multiple factors. Positive regulators include TET2, ESYT3,
  and NR1D1, which enhance STING signaling and activate the pathway. Small molecules
  such as GPR162, Rocaglamide (RocA), WEE1, and BIBR1532 directly enhance the function
  of the cGAS-STING pathway. Conversely, factors such as Flotillin-1, CD73, pINx1,
  and SAMHD1 inhibit the cGAS-STING pathway
