caption: These data suggest that arsenicals activate MAPK signaling both through ROS,
  as well as by direct association (). If the effect of ROS in MAPK signaling by arsenicals
  occurs mainly downstream of Src activation, it suggests activation of the pathway
  upstream of Src by direct association of the arsenical with proteins in the signaling
  pathways, in addition to ROS performing as a signaling molecule. Support for this
  idea comes from studies by Simeonova and Luster, where it was found that arsenicals
  may activate MAPK by binding cysteine rich areas of epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR) leading to Ras and subsequent ERK activation (; ).
