caption: Quaternary amine-dependent methylation of THF by Eubacterium limosum. Our
  previous (, ) and current data support a model of quaternary amine metabolism in
  E. limosum in which MttB superfamily members have specialized for utilization of
  distinct substrates, such as MtpB, MtcB, and MtyB. Each superfamily member has retained
  recognition of a single cognate corrinoid-binding protein, Co(I)-MtqC, which further
  allows utilization of the same ATP-dependent reductive activation enzyme, RamQ,
  and the same methyl-Co(III)-MtqA:THF methyltransferase, MtqA to methylate THF with
  distinct quaternary amines. CH3-THF formed by demethylation of the quaternary amine
  can then directly enter the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, where it is oxidized for reducing
  power and used directly in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA (), which is used in the
  further synthesis of catabolic products acetate and butyrate (, ). THF, tetrahydrofolate.
