caption: The key pathways most frequently mutated in MPM all contribute to global
  downregulation of microRNA levels. Tumor suppressor miRNAs are often downregulated
  in MPM, and several mechanisms appear to play a role in this observation. In addition
  to specific control of microRNA transcription, other pathways are involved in indirect
  control of microRNA levels via effects on processing. In mesothelial cells (left
  panel), the p53 pathway (1) is intact, and cell stress induces microRNA levels via
  direct transcription as well as by p53-induced pri-miR processing. Similarly, normal
  signaling of the Hippo pathway (2) through NF2 and LATS2 phosphorylates YAP1 which
  is retained in the cytoplasm. BAP1 deubiquitinase activity (3) destabilizes EZH2,
  a key component of the polycomb repressor complex 2. In mesothelioma (right panel),
  frequent mutation or deletion of the CDKN2A locus leads to loss of p14ARF and increased
  MDM2-mediated p53 degradation. Loss of function mutations of NF2/Merlin or LATS2
  (or gain-of-function mutations of YAP) dysregulate Hippo signaling leading to accumulation
  of YAP in the nucleus where it can inhibit the microprocessor complex via interaction
  with Drosha. Inactivating BAP1 mutations prevent control of EZH2 which can alter
  miRNA levels. Additionally, MYC amplification or mutation can lead to transcriptional
  suppression of multiple miRNA genes. Whether these changes are also involved in
  the upregulation of oncogenic miRNAs in MPM remains to be determined.
