caption: Network one comprising of upregulated genes (>2.5-fold) involved predominately
  in cell death, cancer and morphology. A total of 25 focus genes were used in the
  construction of the network. ADM (adrenomedullin/progesterone biosynthetic process),
  CTGF (connective tissue growth factor/angiogenesis), CYR61 (cysteine-rich angiogenic
  inducer/patterning of blood vessels), EMP2 (epithelial membrane protein 2/cell death),
  ETS1 (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (avian)/DNA dependent
  transcription), ETS2 (DNA dependent transcription), HMGCS1 (transporter 2, ATP-binding
  cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP)/protein complex assembly), IL1RAP (interleukin
  1 receptor accessory protein/transmembrane receptor activity involved in the inflammatory
  response), ITGA6 (integrin, alpha 6/cell adhesion and calcium ion binding), KLF4
  (Kruppel-like factor 4 (gut)/DNA dependent transcription and nucleic acid binding),
  KLF6 (Kruppel-like factor 6/DNA dependent transcription and nucleic acid binding),
  NET1 (neuroepithelial cell transforming gene 1/regulation of Rho protein signal
  transduction), NME1 (non-metastatic cells 1, protein (NM23A)/nucleic acid binding),
  ODC1 (ornithine decarboxylase 1/polyamine biosynthetic process), PIM1 (pim-1 oncogene/protein
  serine/threonine kinase activity), PSAT1 (phosphoserine aminotransferase 1/phosphoserine
  transaminase activity), RND3 (Rho family GTPase 3/cell adhesion), SGK (serum/glucocorticoid
  regulated kinase/serine/threonine kinase activity), SLC7A1 (solute carrier family
  7, (cationic amino acid transporter, y+ system) member 11/amino acid transport activity),
  SPRR1B (small proline-rich protein 1B (cornifin)/epidermis development), TAF5L (TAF5-like
  RNA polymerase II, p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF)-associated factor, 65 kDa/DNA
  dependent transcription), THBS1 (Thrombospondin 1/cell motility, adhesion in response
  to inflammation), TUBB3 (tubulin, beta 3/microtubule-based movement), TUBB2A (tubulin,
  beta 2A/microtubule-based movement), UGT1A6 (UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family/xenobiotic
