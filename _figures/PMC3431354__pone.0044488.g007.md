caption: Periostin expression is upregulated in cancer cells. Periostin in turn upregulates
  VEGF-C expression in cancer cells. Periostin secreted from the cancer cells promotes
  migration and tube formation of lymphatic endothelial cells through the activation
  of Src and Akt. Src may activate VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 –. Moreover, Secreted VEGF-C
  from cancer cells also promotes migration and tube formation of lymphatic endothelial
  cells. Thus, in addition to activation of VEGF-C signaling pathway, periostin-integrin
  interaction may trigger the intracellular signaling and activation of certain genes
  that are involved in tube formation and migration of lymphatic endothelial cells
  through Src and Akt activation.
