caption: Production of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and association with atherosclerosis
  and thrombosis resulting in cardiovascular diseases. Trimethylamine (TMA) is generated
  by the action of TMA lyases in the gut microbiota from dietary TMA-containing nutrients
  (e.g., choline, phosphatidylcholine, L-carnitine). Then, TMA is rapidly further
  oxidized to TMAO by hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs). TMAO promotes
  macrophage foam cell formation, development of platelet hyperreactivity, altered
  bile acids and cholesterol transport, and activation of the inflammatory pathway.
  All factors are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases including
  stroke, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease.
