caption: Biomaterial-triggered complement activation drives early thromboinflammatory
  changes during hemodialysis. Passive adsorption of multiple plasma proteins onto
  the HD filter or dialysis tubing, including antibodies and pattern recognition molecules
  such as ficolin-2, MBL, properdin, C1q and C3(H2O), may trigger simultaneously multiple
  routes of complement activation in the HD circuit. All routes of complement activation
  converge at the level of C3 and lead to the generation of proinflammatory effectors
  and immunostimulatory molecules such as C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins and of cell-activating
  soluble C5b-9 complexes (sC5b-9). Sequestering of fluid phase complement regulators,
  such as factor H, to the biomaterial surface through possible entrapment in the
  adsorbed plasma protein mesh or fibrin coat, favors the forceful amplification of
  complement C3 fragment deposition on the surface via the AP amplification loop.
  Moreover, C5aR1 stimulation on monocytes and neutrophils leads to upregulation of
  adhesion receptors and increased expression of the complement phagocytic receptor
  CR3. C5aR1-mediated activation of monocytes/neutrophils foster a procoagulant environment
  via the de novo release or increased surface expression of TF which in turn initiates
  the intrinsic coagulation pathway leading to thrombin activation, fibrin formation
  and platelet-neutrophil complex formation via CR3-iC3b tethering in the vicinity
  of the HD biomaterial surface. Targeted inhibition of C3 by members of the compstatin
  family of peptidic inhibitors blocks the cleavage of C3 by all convertases, abrogates
  the generation of downstream proinflammatory effectors (C3a, C5a, sC5b-9) and attenuates
  the procoagulant response which is elicited following blood-biomaterial surface
  contact. The ‘X’ sign denotes points of therapeutic intervention with a C3 inhibitor.
