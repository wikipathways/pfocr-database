caption: Effect of the growing season on the expression profiles of the flavonoid
  synthesis pathway during the development of the ‘Muscat Hamburg’ and ‘Victoria’
  grapes in 2014. Heatmaps showed the log2 fold changes between seasons (winter season/summer
  season). Red block indicated higher gene expression in the winter season berries.
  Blue block indicated lower gene expression in the winter season berries. Boxes with
  bold margins indicated differentially expressed genes between the summer and the
  winter season berries.
