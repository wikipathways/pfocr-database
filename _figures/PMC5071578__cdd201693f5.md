caption: Role of TSN in carcinogenesis. TSN is implicated in a subset of cancer-related
  processes. In particular, TSN can promote tumor cell proliferation through activation
  of the Wnt and IGF signaling pathways. Furthermore, TSN interacts with c-Myb, sustaining
  breast cancer proliferation. TSN supports angiogenesis by activating NF-kB, resulting
  in the induction of the oncomiR-221, angiogenin and CXCL16. TSN is involved in the
  regulation of migration and invasion. Interaction of TSN with AEG-1, SAM68 and miR-361-5p
  promotes tumor metastasis. TSN is a direct target of miR-184 in the regulation of
  malignant glioma invasion. TSN was also reported to support epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) via association with the TGFβ1 signaling pathway in breast cancer.
  In addition, TSN is involved in the regulation of chemoresistance in lung cancer
  acting through TSN-S100A11-PLA2 axis
