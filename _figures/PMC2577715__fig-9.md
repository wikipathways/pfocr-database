caption: Nrf2 and transcriptional regulation of γ-GCSh expression. Under nonstress
  conditions, Nrf2 is complexed with Keap1 and targeted to Cul3–mediated ubiquitination
  and protein degradation. Under oxidative-stress conditions, such a degradation pathway
  is inhibited, and Nrf2 accumulates. Nrf2 then translocates into the nucleus, where
  it complexes with MafK, which transactivates target genes. Oxidative stress also
  induces Nrf2 phosphorylation. γ-GCSh is a target gene of Nrf2. Overexpression of
  γ-GCSh leads to elevated biosynthesis of GSH, which in turn suppresses oxidative
  stress.
