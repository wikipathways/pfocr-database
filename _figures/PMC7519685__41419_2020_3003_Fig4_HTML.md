caption: Whereas the intrinsic apoptotic mechanism is initiated by intracellular stimuli
  such as oxidative stress, ER stress or organelle dysfunction, the extrinsic pathway
  is activated in response to external stimuli, namely by binding of death ligands,
  such as TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), TNFα or Fas (CD95/APO-1),
  to their respective death receptors (DR) in the cell surface. In hepatocytes, the
  apoptotic signals from DR are not robust enough to trigger the effector caspase
  cascade, so the intrinsic pathway is also activated to boost the apoptotic response,.
  The induction of the intrinsic pathway involves a decrease of anti-apoptotic proteins
  such as Bcl2 and the translocation of pro-apoptotic members (Bax, Bak) to the mitochondria
  triggering cytochrome c release and other apoptosis-inducing factors to the cytosol,
  thereby activating procaspase-9 and downstream apoptotic effectors.
