caption: In the absence of heavy metal stress, FOS-1 forms homodimers and binds to
  the TRE2 motif in the kreg target promoter. FOS-1 dimerization potentiates recruitment
  of HDA-1 to the promoter. The FOS-1/HDA-1 repressor complex represses transcription
  of kreg target genes (left panel). In the presence of heavy metal stress, the KGB-1
  pathway is activated and FOS-1 is phosphorylated by KGB-1. FOS-1 phosphorylation
  leads to a switch from dimer to monomer, resulting in dissociation of the FOS-1/HDA-1
  repressor complex from the target promoter that activates transcription of kreg
  genes (right panel).
