caption: The proposed pathways underlying the protective roles of hydrogen sulfide
  (H2S) against COVID-19. H2S as a novel gasotransmitter regulates a variety of physiological
  functions and provides protection against organ damages (box 1). H2S also displays
  beneficial roles in preventing lung disorders (box 2) and viral replication (box
  3). Cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE)-derived H2S (box 4) or exogenously applied H2S may
  block severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry into the
  host cells by interrupting angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane
  protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), inhibit virus replication by attenuating syncytium
  formation and virus assembly/release, and protect SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage
  by suppressing the immune response and inflammation development. The dotted line
  indicates the prediction, and the red line means the blockage of the pathway. CVB3,
  coxsackie virus B3; PPG, dl-propargylglycine; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus.
