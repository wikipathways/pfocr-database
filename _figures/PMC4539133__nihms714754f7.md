caption: Carnitine and acylcarnitine roles in transportation of long-chain fatty acids
  into the mitochondrial matrix and the β-oxidation pathway. Free fatty acids (FFAs)
  are transported into the cytosol by fatty acid transport proteins. Very long-chain
  (VLC) FFAs >22C do not enter the mitochondria and are metabolized by peroxisomes.
  β oxidation of FFAs results in 2-carbon units (acetyl-CoA) released to enter the
  TCA cycle. The remaining acyl is further metabolized. Perturbations of the fatty
  acid β-oxidation pathway may affect energy production. TAG = triacylglyceride; FFA
  = free fatty acid; VLC = very long chain; LC = long chain; CoA = coenzyme A; CPT
  = carnitine palmitoyl transferase; CAT = carnitine acyl transferase; GLC = glucose;
  ETC = electron-transport chain; ACS = acetyl-CoA synthetase.
