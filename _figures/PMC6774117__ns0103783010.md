caption: NGF-driven differentiation of PC12 cells requires a signal(s) generated from
  the UPAR immediate-early gene product. NGF binding to its receptor activates a signal
  transduction pathway(s) that preferentially induces UPAR expression (shortbroken
  andthicksolidlines), as well as a pathway(s)—shared by EGF—that induces other immediate-early
  genes (thicksolidline). Induced UPAR protein is incorporated into the cell membrane,
  where it generates a signal (shortbrokenline), along with other primary response
  genes (thinsolidline), that is required for the induction of secondary response
  genes such as collagenase-1 and transin. Continued progress along the NGF-induced
  differentiation pathway requires both a signal(s) generated from the induced UPAR
  protein and additional signals that continue to be generated by the NGF–TrkA complex.
  As described in the text, PKCδ may modulate the NGF-restricted signal transduction
  pathway (), leading to the differential expression of UPAR observed in response
  to NGF versus EGF. MAPKK, MAP kinase kinase.
