caption: Schematic summary of the interaction between human NP and macrophages in
  the in vitro model and effects of ES on the degenerative IVD models. In this study,
  we first confirmed that soluble factors derived from macrophages activate the NF-κB
  signaling pathway in human NP cells, inducing the protein production of IL-6, IL-8,
  MMP-1, and MMP-3 via translocation of NF-κB p65 protein into the nucleus. Second,
  we also mimicked a degenerative IVD in vitro model by coculturing human NP cells
  and macrophages by using a newly developed microfluidic platform. The interactions
  between the human NP cells and macrophages induced inflammatory milieu through the
  production of inflammatory mediators and ECM-modifying enzymes. Third, ES demonstrated
  an inhibitory effect of the production of inflammatory mediators IL-6 and IL-8 in
  human NP cells under these conditions. Cumulatively, these findings can provide
  therapeutic target molecules for macrophage-mediated inflammation in degenerative
  IVD.
