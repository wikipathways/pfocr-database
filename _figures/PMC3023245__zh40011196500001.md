caption: Schematic representation of steps involved in flow-mediated dilation (FMD)
  generation from the initiation of the shear-stress stimulus (step 1) to the resultant
  vessel diameter change (step 6). Blood flow-associated shear stress is sensed by
  deformation of mechanosensitive structures at the cell membrane. These structures
  could include the glycocalyx, the primary cilia, and mechanosensitive ion channels
  (). Shear-stress mechanotransduction activates a signaling cascade that results
  in vasodilator production (step 2). The vasodilators produced and predominantly
  involved in FMD appear to depend on the nature of the shear-stress stimulus () and
  the endothelial phenotype (). Vasodilators must diffuse from the endothelial cell
  into the smooth muscle cell (step 3). Nitric oxide (NO) may react with reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), decreasing its bioavailability (). In the vascular smooth
  muscle, vasodilators trigger a signaling cascade that results in a lowering of calcium
  concentration and vasorelaxation (step 4). Vessel wall structural factors (e.g.,
  relative proportions of collagen and elastin or wall-to-lumen ratio) may influence
  the diameter change that results from a given degree of smooth muscle relaxation
  () (step 5). FMD is quantified as the change in vessel diameter from baseline dimensions
  before the application of the shear-stress stimulus (step 6). Given the established
  vasoprotective properties of NO, FMD is often intended as an index of NO bioavailability
  (, ). Thus efforts have been directed at identifying specific protocols and stimulus
  profiles that are able to isolate the NO pathway (step 7). Examining vasodilatory
  responses to exogenous nitroglycerin can isolate and interrogate function downstream
  of the endothelium. EDHF, endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor; PG, vasodilatory
  prostaglandins; CYP 450, cytochrome P450; eNOS, endothelial NO synthase.
