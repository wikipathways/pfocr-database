caption: Death receptor mediate death ligand-induced apoptosis through the formation
  of a death inducing signaling complex (DISC) containing the death receptor, adapter
  proteins such as Fas-associated death domain (FADD), and initiator caspases such
  as pro-caspase-8 or pro-caspase-10. Consequently, pro-caspase-8 or pro-caspase-10
  is activated by autoproteolytic processing, which then cleaves and activates downstream
  effector caspases, such as caspase-3 (extrinsic pathway). Additionally, the Bcl-2-interacting
  protein Bid is also cleaved by caspase-8.Truncated-Bid causes the loss of mitochondrial
  membrane potential and caspase-9 cleavage, resulting in apoptosis. Thus, truncated-Bid
  is a mediator that transduces the proapoptotic signal from the extrinsic pathway
  to the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway.
