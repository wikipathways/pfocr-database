caption: 'FGF23 regulation and its interaction with the traditional paradigm on mineral
  homeostasis. FGF23 is mainly produced by osteoblasts and osteocytes, which is stimulated
  by calcitriol via the VDR signaling pathway and hyperphosphatemia via sensing of
  extracellular phosphate levels mediated by PiT2 (dominant pathway) and FGFR1c. In
  proximal tubular cells, FGF23 binding with the αKlotho/FGFR complex causes hypophosphatemia
  by inhibiting NaPi-2a and decreased calcitriol levels by suppressing the vitamin
  D activation process. Decreased calcitriol also reduces calcium and phosphate absorption
  from the GI tract. In parathyroid cells, PTH secretion is dominantly controlled
  by circulating calcium via CaSR, which overrides the inhibitory effect of FGF23.
  Increased PTH induces calcium resorption from bone and also causes hypophosphatemia
  by inhibiting NaPi-2a activity. Consequently, hypophosphatemia and decreased calcitriol
  levels will act as the negative feedback control of FGF23 production by diminishing
  VDR, PiT2 and FGFR1c signaling. This figure was generated with publication licensed
