caption: Proposed model for CDK9-cyclin K in the Replication Stress Response. CDK9
  has multiple functions. With cyclin T, CDK9 functions in promoting RNA polymerase
  II elongation. In response to replication stress, CDK9 with cyclin K is mobilized
  to chromatin where it functions to prevent the breakdown of stalled replication
  forks and promote cell cycle recovery. CDK9-cyclin K interacts in a complex with
  ATR and other DNA damage response and repair proteins but likely functions downstream
  or in a parallel pathway to ATR and CHK1.
