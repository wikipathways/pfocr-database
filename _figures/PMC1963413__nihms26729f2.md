caption: Blocks of iNOS-blocking signaling pathways. The central idea of blocking
  iNOS transactivation involves interfering with activation of transcription factors.
  (A) Blocking of JAK-STAT pathway. SHP-1 and SHP-2 can block recruitment of JAK to
  the receptor tyrosine kinase and thus prevent activation of the JAK-STAT pathway.
  This scheme is utilized by Curcumin {diferuloylmethane,1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione}
  and PPARγ ligands, as they can activate SHP. PPARγ ligands can also upregulate SOCS
  expression, which subsequently blocks recruitment of JAK to the RTK. PPARγ ligands
  furthermore, block activation of NF-κB. (B) Dampening by cAMP. Presence of excess
  cAMP in astrocytes blocks activation of p38-MAPK thereby attenuating signals downstream
  of it. It also binds with PKA and subsequently activates it, which then somehow
  blocks activation of NF-κB.
