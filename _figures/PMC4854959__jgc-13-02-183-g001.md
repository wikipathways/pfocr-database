caption: 'The steroidal androgens, testosterone and DHT, mediate their biological
  effects predominantly through genomic pathway by binding to the AR and translocation
  into the nucleus, thereby facilitating the ability of AR to bind to its cognate
  response element, and recruiting coregulators to regulate the expression of target
  genes (left side). The nongenomic stimulation of second messenger cascades by androgens
  exerts biological effects through modulation of the transcriptional activity of
  AR or other transcription factors (right side). AR: androgen receptor; ARA: androgen
  receptor activator; ARE: androgen response element; cAMP: cyclic adenosine monophosphate;
  DHT: dihydrotestosterone; GPCR: G-protein coupled receptor; HSP: heat shock protein;
  MAPKs: mitogen-activated protein kinases; PKA: protein kinase A; PKC: protein kinase
  C; SHBG: steroid hormone binding globulin; SHBGR: SHBG receptor; Src: tyrosine kinase
  C; SHC: Src homology 2 domain-containing.'
