caption: Proposed metabolomics platform for identification of inhibitory metabolites
  in CHO bioprocess. Cell culture samples are collected, after which culture supernatant
  are screened through LC-MS for untargeted identification of potential metabolite
  features. Metabolites impact screening study is conducted on candidate metabolite
  features to verify their inhibitory impact on CHO cultures. Metabolites that show
  no inhibitory effect on CHO cultures, elucidated through spike-in study, are further
  considered in downstream metabolomics pipeline. Pathway analysis study is conducted
  on metabolites identified to be growth or productivity inhibitors, after which metabolites
  are mapped to their pathway of generation for identification of their metabolic
  precursors. Finally, inhibitory metabolites impact characterization is conducted
  on CHO fed-batch process to characterize inhibitory impact of metabolites on growth,
  titer productivity and titer quality due to exposure of cells to inhibitors for
  a prolonged period.
