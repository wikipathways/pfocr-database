caption: Schematic of signaling pathways involved in α-TEA-induced apoptosis in human
  ovarian cancer cell lines. Based on previously reported data [] and data reported
  here, we propose both blockage of prosurvival and activation of proapoptotic signaling
  pathways are involved in α-TEA-induced apoptosis of human ovarian cancer cell lines.
  α-TEA triggers activation of the proapoptotic Fas (CD95) pathway, leading to a caspase-8-
  and mitochondria/caspase-9-dependent proapoptotic cascade []. Additionally, α-TEA
  downregulates ErbB1 (in the A2780/CP70R cells) and ErbB2 and ErbB3 in both A2780
  and A2780/CP70R cell lines, leading to suppression of PI3K/Akt signaling and expression
  of the downstream antiapoptotic factors FLIP and survivin, which potentiates the
  α-TEA-induced proapoptotic cascade via enhancing the activation of caspase-8 and
  caspase-9/3, respectively, [–].
