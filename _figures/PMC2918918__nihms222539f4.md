caption: Current evidence suggests that Src kinases and protein kinase C (PKC) are
  activated in various tissues and organs in obese, hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic
  rats and mice. Once activated, Src kinases and PKC activate G6PD, which increases
  oxidative stress and inflammation. When this occurs in the vasculature, it can lead
  to endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery disease and heart failure.
