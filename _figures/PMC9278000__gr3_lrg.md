caption: The role of p38 MAPK pathway inhibitors in alleviating COVID-19 inflammatory
  response. Ang II and AT1R binding activate p38 MAPK pathway, which could remarkably
  increase pro-inflammatory cytokines release. On the other hand, Ang (1–7) and Mas
  receptor binding could diminish p38 MAPK pathway and counterbalance the effect of
  Ang II. ACE2 receptor transfers Ang II to Ang (1–7), and its binding to S protein
  of SARS-CoV-2 leads to the loss of ACE2 upon viral entry , , .
