caption: How placenta and maternal systemic cardiovascular systems interact for the
  women adaptation to the pregnancy. Spiral artery modification (obtained thanks to
  the trophoblast invasion process) reduces the utero-placental flow resistance. This
  artery modifications are associated with the placental secretion of angiogenic factors
  (i.e., vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF, placental growth factor PlGF) increasing
  nitric oxide (NO) and other vasodilatory factors such as prostacyclin (PGI2) and
  endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). Pregnancy hormones (human chorion
  gonadotropin HCG, estrogen, progesterone, relaxin) and placental secreted factors
  show many functions during pregnancy. They act as angiogenic factors and are able
  to activate the renin-angiotensin system, inducing the increase of aldosterone level
  and water and sodium reabsorption from the kidney, leading in turn to plasma volume
  expansion and hemodilution. Moreover, estrogens are indirectly able to intervene
  in the regulation of the pathway of NO and relaxin acts in the maternal hemodynamic
  adaptation, playing a role in the reduction of renal artery resistance. The increased
  NO in renal arteries also contributed to the reduction of renal vascular resistance.
  The result is an increased maternal blood volume with increased cardiac output and
  reduction in peripheral resistance. A detailed review of placental signaling of
  the maternal organism has been recently performed by Osol et al. []
