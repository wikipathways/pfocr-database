caption: Metabolic map of virus-encoded carbon metabolism host genes from 10 viromes
  in dark Pacific Ocean waters. Blue lines represent genes encoded in the aphotic
  zone. The width of the lines corresponds to the normalized read abundance as shown
  in the legend and arrows correspond to the proposed flow through these pathways
  during viral infection. Enzymes are listed in blue and compounds in black. (A) Virus-encoded
  host genes in glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway,
  and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway towards dNTP biosynthesis. (B) Virus-encoded host
  genes in glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle,
  the electron transport chain, and components of the 3-hydroxypropionate Bicycle
  towards energy production. For map generation, see iPath [].
