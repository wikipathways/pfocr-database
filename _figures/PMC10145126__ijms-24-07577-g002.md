caption: Pathway of PD-L1 regulation by IFNγ. PD-L1 expression by tumor cells correlates
  with IFNγ production by T cells. Binding of interferon to its receptor induces phosphorylation
  of JAK1 and 2 and then STAT1. STAT1 dimers induce IRF1 which leads to transcription
  of the PD-L1 promoter. This pathway regulates the production of PD-L1 and its expression
  on the surface of tumor cells.
