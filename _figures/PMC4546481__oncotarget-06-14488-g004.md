caption: A, Green arrows indicate blockaded pathways. The JAK2-STATs pathway was blockaded
  and may be responsible for decreased downstream gene expression, inhibiting cell
  proliferation. B, Microarray results of shRNA-COL6A1 PC-3 cells (left) were validation
  by western blots, compared to shRNA-mock PC-3 cells (right).
