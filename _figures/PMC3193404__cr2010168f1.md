caption: 'NF-κB signaling pathways initiated by TLR4, TCR, TNF receptor 1, CD40 and
  genotoxic stress. Left: canonical NF-κB signaling is initiated by the inducible
  formation of multiprotein complexes that can undergo non-degradative polyubiquitination
  (K63-linked or linear) and which are recognized by TAK1 and IKK kinase complexes.
  This leads to the activation of IKKβ, which phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor protein
  IκBα, resulting in its proteasomal degradation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB
  (depicted as p50/p65). TNF receptor 1 can also initiate the formation of a caspase-8-containing
  complex that signals apoptosis. The places where caspases have been proposed to
  regulate NF-κB signaling are indicated. Middle: some receptors initiate a non-canonical
  NF-κB signaling pathway that results in the activation of IKKα, which phosphorylates
  the NF-κB inhibitor p100, resulting in its processing to p52 and the formation of
  p52/RelB NF-κB complexes. Receptors initiating this pathway also initiate the formation
  of multiprotein complexes and ubiquitination (not shown in the figure), which results
  in the activation of the kinase NIK, which activates IKKα. Right: NF-κB activation
  by genotoxic stress results in the activation of a multiprotein complex (PIDDosome)
  in which the IKK adaptor NEMO is recruited. This is the beginning of a sequential
  series of modifications on NEMO, which alter its subcellular localization, providing
  a means to link genotoxic stress to the cytosolic IKK complex. An alternative PIDDosome
  complex recruits caspase-2 and initiates apoptosis.'
