caption: Cisplatin resistance mechanism of circRNA in lung cancer. So far, 16 circRNAs
  have been studied in lung cancer. The mechanisms of cisplatin resistance in these
  articles include the most common ceRNA NET, exosomes, PI3K pathway, autophagy, ABC
  transporter, DDR (NER), and CSCs. Three circRNAs, namely, hsa_circ_0096157, hsa_circ_0046264,
  and CircAMARCA5, play roles in cisplatin resistance in lung cancer. However, their
  specific mechanisms have not been explored.
