caption: The transcription regulation of mitochondrial gene expression by CREB, ER,
  GR, and PPARγ2 have been reported. PKA mediated phosphorylation of CREB leads to
  CREB binding to cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) within the mitochondrial genome
  that promotes neuronal survival. Alongside p53-dependent transcription from mitochondrial
  genome may also result in neuronal cell death. It is well established that p53 and
  Nur-77 complexes with Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 present on mitochondrial membrane which subsequently
  triggers the downstream cascade of apoptosis via mitochondrial transcription independent
  pathway.
