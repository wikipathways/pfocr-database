caption: Extracellular signals and their signaling pathways cause posttranslational
  modifications of SRCs, which regulate the cellular concentrations, activities and
  specificities of SRCs. In general, SRCs enhance steroid receptor functions and facilitate
  hormonal promotion of breast, prostate and ovarian cancers. Specifically, SRC-1
  enhances Ets-2-mediated HER2 expression and PEA3-mediated Twist expression and upregulates
  CSF-1 expression to promote breast tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis.
  MOZ and SRC-2 fusion gene causes AML (acute myeloid leukemia). SRC-3 upregulates
  its own expression through serving as a coactivator for E2F1 and SP1. The overexpressed
  SRC-3 enhances PEA3 and AP-1 mediated MMP expression to promote breast and prostate
  tumor cell metastasis. SRC-3 also enhances E2F1-mediated cell cycle progression
  and Gab2 expression that activates Akt. In addition, SRC-3 upregulates IGF-I, IRS-1
  and IRS-2 to promote the IGF-I signaling pathway and to activate EGFR and ERBB2
  to enhance Akt and MAPK activities, resulting in hyperactivation of Akt and MAPK
  which contribute to cancer cell proliferation, growth, survival, migration, invasion
  and metastasis.
