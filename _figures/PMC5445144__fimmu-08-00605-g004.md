caption: 'Regulatory T cell (Treg) action mechanisms. Tregs induce immune suppression
  by four classical mechanisms: the contact cell-to-cell is mediated by surface markers
  cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and lymphocyte activation gene
  3 (LAG-3) that interact, respectively, with molecules CD80/86 and MHC II on the
  target cells, regulating cell function. AMPc is also a mediator of this mechanism,
  which is released directly through the gap junctions and inhibits the proliferation
  and differentiation of the target cell. Cytokine production, in which transforming
  growth factor (TGF)-β and interleukin (IL)-10 modulate the activation and function
  of Treg. Competition for growth factors, in particular IL-2, the constitutive expression
  of CD25 on Treg, and their deprivation induce target cell to apoptosis through the
  B cell lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2)/BIM pathway. A fourth mechanism is found in lineages
  Type 1 Treg that secrets Granzyme B (GZB) and perforin (PRF) that act specifically
  in myeloid precursors. The cytolytic activity of GZB in target cells induces apoptosis
  by caspases or BID pathway.'
