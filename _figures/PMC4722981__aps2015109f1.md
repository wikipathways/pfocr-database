caption: The mechanism of TRPC5 in mediating chemoresistance. (A) TRPC5 mediates the
  development of chemoresistance. In chemoresistant cancer cells, (1) overexpressed
  TRPC5 leads to the activation of the Ca2+signaling pathway. (2) NFATC3, β-catenin,
  and HIF-1 are activated and lead to (3) p-gp overexpression, EMT pathway activation,
  and angiogenesis, respectively. (4) Overexpressed p-gp localizes onto the plasma
  membrane (PM), which can pump out chemotherapeutic drugs, and thus directly induces
  chemoresistance, EMT pathway activation, and angiogenesis and indirectly induces
  chemoresistance by modulating apoptosis, metastasis, and other pathways. (B) TRPC5
  mediates the spreading of chemoresistance. In chemoresistant cancer cells that overexpress
  TRPC5, (1) Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are formed with the TRPC5 protein on the
  EV membrane and TRPC5 mRNA inside the EV. (2) The EVs are transferred to chemosensitive
  recipient cells, where TRPC5-mediated chemoresistance develops. (3) The EVs spread
  into the circulating system, and TRPC5 levels in the EV positively correlate with
  clinical level of chemoresistance. Therefore, TRPC5 levels in the EV represent a
  diagnostic marker for chemoresistance.
