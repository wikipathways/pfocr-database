caption: A schematic model illustrates that temozolomide (TMZ) triggers loss of K+i,
  Cli and apoptotic volume decrease (AVD), and leads to apoptotic cell death in glioblastoma
  cancer cells. In response to TMZ, the novel Cl−/volume-sensitive regulatory kinases
  WNK-mediated signaling transduction pathway is stimulated and activates NKCC-1 protein
  by phosphorylation. Activation of NKCC-1 accumulates intracellular Na+, K+, and
  Cl− and obligated water molecules (regulatory volume increase, RVI) to counteract
  ionic dysregulation and AVD and promote cell survival of the TMZ-treated cells.
  In contrast, inhibition of NKCC-1 activity with bumetanide facilitates loss of intracellular
  K+, Cl− and AVD, thus sensitizes glioma cells to the TMZ-mediated apoptosis (adopted
  from Algharabil, et al []).
