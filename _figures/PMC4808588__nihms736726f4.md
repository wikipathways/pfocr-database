caption: 'pDCs sense DNA viruses, synthetic CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODN) and
  endogenous DNA through TLR9. All TLR9 signaling requires MyD88 but additional factors
  determine whether TLR9 engagement will result in type I IFN (IFN-I) or pro-inflammatory
  cytokine production. These factors include mode of ligand entry, and the intracellular
  compartment where TLR9 encounters its ligand. TLR9 is transported to appropriate
  intracellular compartments by UNC93B, and requires cleavage in order to recruit
  MyD88,. DNA viruses, CpG ODN and small DNA immunecomplexes (DNA-ICs) enter pDCs
  through endocytosis and meet TLR9 in the early endosome. In contrast, large DNA-ICs
  are internalized by phagocytosis and encounter TLR9 and UNC93B in the early phagosome.
  If AP3 or LC3 are recruited then the IRF7 endosome or IRF7 phagosome is formed which
  leads to IFN-I production. Several molecules/pathways are involved in this process
  including IKKα, osteopontin (OPN), SLC15A4, BTK, BLOC1, BLOC2, DOCK2, PACSIN1, PLSCR1,
  VIPERIN, SCARB2 and the mTOR pathway. Alternatively, TLR9-containing compartments
  can form NF-κB endosomes or NF-κB phagosomes resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines (i.e. IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α, etc). This process requires IRF5,
  BTK and SLC15A4. CpG ODN have different structures which results in trafficking
  to different compartments: CpG-A is transported to the IRF7 endosome and is a strong
  inducer of IFN-I, while CpG-B aggregates in the NF-κB endosome and is a potent stimulator
  of maturation and cytokine/chemokine production. CpG-C exhibits properties of both
  CpG-A and CpG-B in that it can induce both IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  TLR7 stimulation by viral and endogenous RNA may follow similar pathways.'
