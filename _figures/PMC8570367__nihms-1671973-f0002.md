caption: 'Emerging combination therapy: Combined blockage of glutaminolysis with inhibition
  of other pathways.CB-839 or BPTES, small molecule inhibitors of GLS, combined with
  other drugs, is an emerging cancer treatment strategy. (1) CB-839 combinations:
  CB-839 combined with cabozantinib, a small molecule inhibitor of growth factor signaling,
  or with everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, are currently undergoing clinical trials.
  In addition, CB-839 synergizes with nivolumab, a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody
  blocking PD-1, and this combination is also undergoing a Phase II clinical trial.
  Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is important for cancer cells to reduce ROS
  stress and sustain genome integrity. GLS inhibition by, e.g. CB-839 treatment, suppresses
  the generation of nucleotides and causes replication stress, which may activate
  PARP-dependent DNA repairs. Treating cancer cells with a combination of CB-839 and
  PARP inhibitor, such as olaparib, has been shown to achieve synergistic antitumor
  activity. NAAG has been identified as a glutamine reservoir in cancer cells and
  is hydrolyzed to generate glutamate and NAA by carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), which
  can be inhibited by 2-PMPA. Combining 2-PMPA with CB-839 showed a more significant
  decrease in tumor size compared to treating the tumor with either of these drugs
  alone. (2) BPTES combination: BPTES combined with metformin, a glucose metabolism
  inhibitor, results in greater inhibition of tumor growth. The glutaminase II pathway
  provides cancer cells with a mechanism for bypassing GLS inhibition. Inhibition
  of both GLS1/2 and the glutaminase II pathway is a novel strategy for treating glutamine-addicted
  cancers. The effect of each drug or shRNA (highlighted in yellow) is shown in red,
  metabolites are shown in black, and enzymes are shown in blue boxes.'
