caption: Antigen processing through MHC I molecules. MHCI is a tripartite complex
  that is composed of a non-covalent association of heavy chain (blue) with β2m (red).
  The third component is represented by a short peptide of 8–10 aa (orange), which
  is processed by the proteasome and translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  lumen through Tap protein (TAP1; TAP2; yellow) where it is loaded onto the MHC complex
  through the tapasin (Tsn; yellow). After loading, MHCI dissociates from TAP/Tsn
  and traffics to the cell surface along the secretory pathway, where it is monitored
  by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Normally, the exposure of a self-peptide on the cell
  membrane avoids the activation of an immune response. Conversely, the exposure of
  a non-self-peptide (red) induces the activation of an immune response by CD8+ T
  cells with induction of the immunoproteaseome in which three catalytic proteasome
  β subunits are replaced by three immunosubunits (Lmp7, Lmp2, and Lmp10).
