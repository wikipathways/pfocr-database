caption: Multiple suppressive mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2-infected DCs from patients
  with severe COVID-19. The number of DCs in patients decreases after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  Increased apoptosis, alterations in distribution of DCs, and inhibition of MDSCs
  may be associated with a decrease in DC number. IFN-I secretion is inhibited by
  various viral proteins that have been shown to be effective against IFN-I signaling
  in SARS-CoV infection (). In addition to the effects of viral proteins, anti-IFN
  antibody and reduced expression of TLR7 have been observed in some patients with
  severe COVID-19. The capability of antigen presentation is impaired in cDC1 and
  cDC2. Inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway, activated DC-SIGN pathway, and activated
  Wnt5 pathway could contribute to downregulation of MHC-II and co-stimulatory molecules.
