caption: The synthesis process of RuPc-BSA and the mechanism of alleviating HHBI.
  (A) The synthesis principle of RuPc-BSA and its schematic diagram alleviating oxidative
  stress damage in HHBI mice by targeting CO release, reducing ROS production and
  activating Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway. (B) Construction process of HHBI mouse
  model and treatment by RuPc-BSA
