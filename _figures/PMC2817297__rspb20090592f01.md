caption: 'A gene network implicated in the seed dormancy in Arabidopsis. Dormancy
  is established during seed development when a transcription factor network (orange)
  and chromatin modifications (blue) programme pathways associated with seed development.
  In the imbibed seed, the interaction of the gibberellin signalling pathway (green)
  with the abscisic acid signalling pathway (yellow) and an environmental signalling
  network (red) control germination potential. The collective action of the regulatory
  genes controls events before or after germination. Connections in red indicate known
  direct protein–protein interactions in the network, black-dashed lines indicate
  regulation. Numbers in orange represent the first points at which environmental
  information modulating dormancy enters the network: 1, light quality and fluence;
  2, temperature; 3, dry after-ripening; 4, nitrate.'
