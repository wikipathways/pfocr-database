caption: (A) Sphingolipid metabolic pathway in normal and psoriatic keratinocyte.
  In psoriatic keratinocytes, the level of ceramides is lowered, while the level of
  S1P is increased. (B) Possible effect of metabolic disturbances of sphingolipids
  on the development of psoriasis. Red arrow indicates a reduced level of ceramides,
  while green arrow presents an elevated level of S1P.
