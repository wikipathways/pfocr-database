caption: A. Targeting MUC1-C genetically or pharmacologically with the GO-203 inhibitor
  downregulates EZH2, SUZ12 and EED expression in TNBC, NSCLC and prostate cancer
  cells, demonstrating that MUC1-C induces multiple PRC2 components. B. MUC1-C drives
  EZH2 transcription by two mechanisms; (i) E2F-mediated activation of the EZH2 promoter,
  and (ii) binding of NF-κB p65 complexes to consensus sites in the EZH2 intron 1
  enhancer region . The EZH2 promoter and enhancer regions include CpG islands (−1046
  to −56; +161 to +914)  and CTCF binding sites (−603 to −598, −468 to −463; +292
  to +297, +702 to +707) for forming a potential loop structure by the CTCF-cohesin
  complex. C. MUC1-C also activates SUZ12 and EED transcription by E2F, in concert
  with previous work , , and by NF-κB p65 (unpublished data). MUC1-C thereby integrates
  EZH2, SUZ12 and EED expression by E2F signaling and by the inflammatory NF-κB pathway.
