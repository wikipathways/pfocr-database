caption: The process of protein O-GlcNAcylation. a Isoforms of OGT and OGA. The main
  difference between the three isoforms of OGT is the number of TRPs. These TRP units
  are stacked to form a super spiral structure, which is related to the recognition
  of the protein substrate. However, they share common carboxy-terminal catalytic
  regions, where CD I is related to UDP recognition and catalysis, and CD II is related
  to GlcNAc binding. The PPO can interact strongly with PI(3,4,5)P3 and participate
  in the insulin signaling pathway. The MTS is unique to mOGT. The intervening domain
  is a flexible connecting domain, which seems not conservative, only exists in metazoa.
  It is also one of the reasons why it is very difficult to crystallize OGT in higher
  metazoa. b Nutrient flux through HBP regulates protein O-GlcNAcylation. The characteristics
  of HBP pathway and UDP-GlcNAc connect the metabolism of glucose, lipid, amino acid,
  and nucleotide in a series. Coupled with the reversible and highly dynamic nature
  of protein O-GlcNAcylation, O-GlcNAcylation can function well as a “stress receptor”
  and “nutrition sensor” in many physiological processes. ncOGT, nucleocytoplasmic
