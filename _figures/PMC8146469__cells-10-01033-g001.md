caption: Schematic diagram showing mast cells receptors (FcεRI and MRGPRX2), MRGPRX2
  ligands (agonist and antagonist) and different states of mast cells. The agonists
  are broadly divided into peptides and non-peptides (drugs). In an unbound state
  (where no ligand binds to MRGPRX2), the mast cells are in resting state. For agonists
  binding to MRGPRX2, the conformational changes in the receptor lead to activation
  of the G protein and downstream signaling pathway. This state is known as the degranulation
  state; the activated MRGPRX2 leads to exocytosis, MC degranulation and release of
  vasoactive and inflammatory mediators. However, the binding of antagonist to MRGPRX2
  prevented receptor activation and inhibited MC degranulation and release of inflammatory
  mediators, which is known as the non-degranulation state.
