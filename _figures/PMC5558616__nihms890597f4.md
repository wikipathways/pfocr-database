caption: Targeting mTOR in fibrosis. First generation mTOR inhibitors are effective
  at targeting the mTORC1 complex, which is implicated in the control of protein and
  limped synthesis, autophagy, and senescence. mTORC1 inhibition may not suppress
  the pathway sufficiently in some cases due to compensatory Akt activation. Second
  generation agents capable of suppressing mTORC1 and mTORC2 more effectively blunt
  signaling through these pathways.
