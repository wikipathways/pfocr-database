caption: Schematic summary of alkaliptosis pathway induced by JTC801, a pH-dependent
  form of cell death. Upon binding to its receptor, JTC801 activates two distinct
  signaling branches. (1) JTC801 activates the NF-κB pathway, which subsequently upregulates
  carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9). CA9 plays a role in maintaining cellular pH by modulating
  the acid–base balance. (2) JTC801 activates ATP6V0D1 and STAT3. ATP6V0D1 contributes
  to the alkalinization of the intracellular environment, further promoting the increase
  in cellular pH [11,43,44]
