caption: Formation of bioactive sphingolipids and toxic deoxy-sphingolipids in mammalian
  cells. Sphingolipid de novo synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme SPTLC through the
  condensation of palmitoyl-CoA (or other activated fatty acid) and L-serine to form
  sphinganine. This condensation and ceramide synthesis process takes place in the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In HSAN1, mutant SPTLCs prefer alanine or glycine instead
  of serine and form deoxy- or deoxymethyl-sphingolipids, which can no longer be metabolized
  to complex sphingolipids or degraded by the canonical degradation pathway, thus
  leading to toxic accumulation. This phenomenon is also seen in diabetes and metabolic
  syndrome. Under normal conditions, ceramides are transported to the Golgi where
  the synthesis of sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids take place. Sphingomyelin
  and glycosphingolipids are then transported to the plasma membrane.
