caption: The synthesis regulation responsible for the synthesis of pulcherriminic
  acid in Bacillus. The black line with an arrow indicates the synthesis pathway of
  pulcherriminic acid, the black line with bars indicates inhibition, the black dashed
  line with bars indicates negative feedback, the red cross indicates deletion inhibition,
  and the red font indicates missing genes (except Fe3+). The dotted line with arrow
  indicates the promotion effect, and the dotted line indicates the effect of iron
  ions on protein. BCAAs, branched chain amino acids.
