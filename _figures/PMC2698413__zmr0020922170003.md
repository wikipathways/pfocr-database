caption: 'Quorum-sensing circuits and biofilm formation. (A) V. cholerae. Three quorum-sensing
  circuits converge on HapR to regulate biofilm formation. A HapR-independent quorum-sensing
  pathway involving Qrr1 to -4 and VC0939, which encodes a GGDEF family protein, has
  also been identified. This protein is likely to be a DGC that makes c-di-GMP, which
  is a positive activator of biofilm formation. HapR inhibits biofilm formation via
  multiple pathways, one of which is by indirectly decreasing c-di-GMP concentrations
  in the cell. Curved arrows denote the flow of phosphate under low-cell-density conditions.
  Phosphate flow is reversed at high density. H and D refer to the histidine and aspartate
  residues, respectively, which accept and shuttle the phosphoryl group. Dotted lines
  denote hypothesized effects. The question mark refers to a hypothesized intermediate
  effector in the pathway that has not been identified. (Adapted from reference  with

  PII and PIII operons. The PII operon encodes the machinery to synthesize, process,
  and detect AIP, while the PIII operon encodes RNAIII, the major effector of the
  quorum-sensing response. RNAIII regulates numerous downstream genes, two of which
  encode Aur and Spl proteases that are negative effectors of biofilm formation. The
  RNAIII transcript also encodes δ-hemolysin, which also inhibits biofilm formation.

  involved in exopolysaccharide production, eDNA, and biofilm formation. Broken lines
  connect the genes to their gene products.'
