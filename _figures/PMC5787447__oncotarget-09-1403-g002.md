caption: (A) HOTAIR promotes cell growth and angiogenesis by inducing VEGFA expression
  directly or indirectly; (B) MALAT1 promotes cancer stem cell activity and induces
  radioresistance to up-regulate slug by reducing miR-1 activity; (C) ANRIL enhances
  the proliferative and transforming capacity, reprograms cell glucose metabolism
  and induces SP cells possibly through activation of the mTOR signal pathway; d.
  low LET expression is induced by EZH2-mediated H3K27 histone methylation in the
  LET promoter region; (D) down-regulated LINC0086 promotes proliferation and inhibits
  apoptosis by decreasing the expression of miR-214; (E) down-regulated lncRNA LOC401317
  promotes NPC cell cycle progression by down-regulating p21 and up-regulating cyclin
  D1 and E1, as well as inhibits apoptosis by inhibiting PARP and caspase 3; (F) ROR
  promotes metastasis and invasion by inducing EMT; (G) H19 induces EMT and promotes
  migration and invasion via modulating the miR-630/EZH2 axis; (H) AFAP1-AS1 promotes
  metastasis by increasing expression of AFAP1 and some cytoskeleton-regulated proteins.
