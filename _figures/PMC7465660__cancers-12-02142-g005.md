caption: Relationship between EBV proteins, hTERT, and NOTCH signaling pathway and
  the modes of action of compounds with lytic induction potentials. hTERT inhibits
  the expression of BZLF1 through the NOTCH2/BATF pathway. EBNA2 is regarded as the
  functional homolog of active NOTCH intracellular domain (Notch-IC) and LMP2A can
  activate the NOTCH pathway. NOTCH2 inhibits the reactivation of lytic cycle of EBV
  through the upregulation of Zeb2 by NOTCH-IC, a transcription factor that represses
  BZLF1 transcription. γ-secretase inhibitors such as compound E and dibenzazepine
  can reactivate lytic cycle of EBV by preventing the release of Notch-IC. Other compounds
  that may reactivate the lytic cycle include hTERT inhibitor, BIBR1532, which selectively
  inhibits telomerase activity, and another γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT.
