caption: Scheme of the relationship between AhR modulators and BaP–DNA adduct formation.
  Broken arrows indicate the pathway of BaP metabolism. Solid arrows indicate the
  activation or inductive commitment, whereas the T-shaped lines indicate inhibition.
  The “protective pathway” and “aggravating pathway” are indicated in blue and red,
  respectively. AhR modulators influence BaP adducts through CYP1A1/1B1 gene induction
  (a), reduction (b), and/or inhibition of enzyme activity (c). Note that only CYP1A1
  has a BPDE metabolic detoxification indicated by a blue arrow
