caption: Cross-talk between insulin and inflammatory signaling pathways. Inflammatory
  signaling pathways activated by SFA or by pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6,
  and TNF-α initiate a cascade of events that promote the release of further inflammatory
  mediators. These signaling events converge at the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, resulting
  in the translocation of transcription factors to the nucleus, transcriptional activation,
  and cytokine production. The inflammasome is activated through a two-hit process;
  with obesity the first hit occurs when TLR4 is activated by SFAs and this results
  in pro-IL-1β production, ATP or ceramides then provide the second hit. The NLRP3
  inflammasome acts on pro-caspase-1 causing the release of caspase-1; caspase-1 then
  acts upon pro-IL-1β cleaving this precursor to the active IL-1β form. Insulin signaling
  promotes glucose uptake by promoting the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface
  plasma membrane. Inflammatory signaling pathways can alter the phosphorylation status
  of IRS-1. IRS-1 is crucial in the insulin signaling pathway, tyrosine phosphorylation
  is associated with an insulin sensitive state. IKKβ and JNK can promote serine phosphorylation
  of IRS-1 and this phosphorylation state is linked to insulin resistance and reduced
  glucose uptake.
