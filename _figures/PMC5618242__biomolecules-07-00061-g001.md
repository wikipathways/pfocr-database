caption: Pathways of ethanol metabolism. Ethanol is oxidized mainly by cytosolic alcohol
  dehydrogenase (ADH) to acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde then enters the mitochondria where
  it is oxidized to acetate by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Another
  major pathway of ethanol metabolism includes its oxidation in microsomes by cytochrome
  P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) enzyme and requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (NADPH) instead of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as for ADH. Reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) are formed due to alcohol metabolism by CYP2E1 and the re-oxidation
  of NADH in the mitochondria. A catalase-mediated reaction in the peroxisomes is
  considered a minor metabolic pathway of alcohol metabolism.
