caption: Schematic diagram of mRNA-miRNA interactions associated with the vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. The network is built based on
  the VEGF signaling pathway map (hsa04370) from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG), identified by enrichment analysis of miRNA targets. The genes are
  represented by circles and miRNAs are by squares (whole plasma), triangles (EV)
  and diamonds (EV-depleted plasma). The identity of genes and miRNAs involved in
  the process are indicated. The miRNA concentration changes in MMD patients are reflected
  by either red- (increased concentration in MMD) or green- (decreased concentration
  in MMD) filled shapes. The miRNA–mRNA interactions are based on validated gene targets
  from miRTarBase and indicated by light blue lines.
