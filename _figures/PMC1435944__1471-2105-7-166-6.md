caption: Graphical Interface for the KnowledgeNet of candidate genes for hypertension.
  The four larger ovals circle the clusters of genes in each of the primary blood
  pressure regulation pathways. Oval symbols are used for genes involved in monogenic
  disease, rectangular symbols for the rest. Red indicates that one or more population
  SNPs are classified as harmful at the molecular level. Italic red text indicates
  that one or more population SNPs with population frequency information are predicted
  to be deleterious. The length and color of the edges represent the strength of the
  link between pairs of genes. Red edges link genes sharing the same abstracts. Short
  edges link genes sharing a large number of biological keywords. Subsets of nodes
  can be highlighted by a number of criteria, such as membership of the same KEGG
  pathway, or homology, or SNP frequency.
