caption: pDC utilize a variety of cell-surface receptors to endocytose viruses into
  endosomes where the viral nucleic acid is uncoated. There, the RNA or DNA interacts
  with TLR7 and -9, respectively, to induce type I IFN gene expression independent
  of viral replication and in a MyD88-dependent manner. pDC express high constitutive
  levels of the transcription factor, IRF-7 that is required for the induction of
  IFN-α. cDC also utilize a TLR-dependent pathway for the sensing of viral RNA – TLR3,
  which recognizes dsRNA within the endosomes. This IFN response, however, requires
  autocrine IFN feedback to upregulate IRF-7 expression to get the full range of IFN
  subtype expression. In addition to the TLR-dendent IFN induction, both types of
  DC have MyD88 independent mechanisms for recognition of cytoplasmic viruses following
  infection of the cells with virus, including the RIG-I system for recognition of
  cytoplasmic dsRNA and an as yet undefined cytoplasmic sensor for DNA.
