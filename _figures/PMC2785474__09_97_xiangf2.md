caption: TLR signaling (an example in macrophages and dendritic cells). TLR2 (TLR2
  in association with TLR1 or TLR6), TLR4, TLR5 and TLR11 are localized on the cell
  surface for ligand recognition. TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 are localized in the endosome
  for ligand recognition in the lumen of endosome. All TLRs, except TLR3, recruit
  MyD88, and TLR1, TLR2, TLR4 and TLR6 recruit the additional adaptor TIRAP, which
  links the TIR domain with MyD88. TLR3 and TLR4 recruit TRIF. TLR4 requires the additional
  linker adaptor TRAM, which links the TIR domain of TLR4 with TRIF. Stimulation of
  the cells with TLR1, TLR2, TLR5, TLR6 and TLR11 ligands initiates the MyD88-dependent
  pathway whereas TLR3 ligands initiate the TRIF-dependent pathway. TLR4 activates
  both MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways. In the MyD88-dependent pathway,
  MyD88 recruits the IRAK family of proteins and TRAF6. In turn, TRAF6 activates TAK1.
  The activated TAK1 activates the IKK complex, which activates NF-κB subunits. The
  activated TAK1 also activates the MAPK pathway. In the TRIF-dependent pathway, TRIF
  interacts with RIP1 and TRAF6. Activated TRAF6 and RIP1 activate NF-κB and MAPKs.
  TRIF also interacts with TRAF3 and activates TBK1/IKKi, which activate IRF3 and
  IRF7. Cells stimulated with TLR7 and TLR9 ligands activate NF-κB and MAPKs via the
  MyD88-dependent pathway. To induce type I IFNs, MyD88 associates with the IRAK family
  of proteins. IRAK1 and IKKα activate IRF7. IRAK1 also interacts with TRAF3 and activates
  IRF7. The activated NF-κB subunits and IRFs are translocated to the nucleus. NF-κB
  and MAPKs initiate the transcription of inflammatory cytokine genes whereas IRFs
  initiate the transcription of type I interferons. (The figure is adapted from []
