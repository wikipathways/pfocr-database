caption: The carbon shunting model of hepatic steatosis in FKBP52-deficient mice.
  Under HF-diet conditions, an excess of glycerol and FFAs are generated by peripheral
  hydrolysis. In WT mice (A), the excess glycerol enters the gluconeogenesis pathway
  as GAPDH through the initial actions of glycerol kinase (data not shown). FFAs simultaneously
  promote glucose production by increasing the expression and activity of PDK4, which
  along with PEPCK and G6Pase are also up-regulated by GC activation of GR. In FKBP52-deficient
  mice subjected to HF (B), reduced GR activity at PEPCK and G6Pase leads to reduced
  utilization of the glycerol-derived carbons for glucose synthesis, whereas reduced
  GR activity at PDK4 causes derepression of the PDC (data not shown). Thus, FKBP52
  loss under HF causes a shunting of three-carbon substrates to pyruvate, leading
  to elevated lipid synthesis and increased susceptibility to hepatic steatosis. Contributing
  to the steatotic phenotype is stimulation of lipogenesis by hyperinsulinemia (data
  not shown). *, Although a reduction of intrinsic hepatic glucose production is proposed
  in these mice, serum hyperglycemia is observed that may result from secondary peripheral
  insulin resistance (untested).
