caption: Pathway, regulation, and inhibitors of heme metabolism. The first enzyme
  of the heme biosynthetic pathway, ALAS is the rate-controlling enzyme of this pathway.
  Heme formation is subject to end-product regulation by negative feedback, but the
  exact point of metabolic control differs between hepatocytes and erythroid cells.
  In the liver, ALAS is regulated negatively by heme, the end product of the pathway.
  In contrast, in erythroid cells, ALAS is not under the same regulatory mechanism.
  HO is the rate-controlling enzyme of the heme degradation pathway. SA is a potent
  inhibitor of ALA dehydratase activity. ZnPP9 is a potent inhibitor of HO activity.
