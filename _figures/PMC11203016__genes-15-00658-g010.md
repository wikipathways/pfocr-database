caption: Illustration of the Toll-like receptor signaling and apoptosis pathways in
  M. chilensis gills under hypoxia conditions. (A) Toll-like receptor is an inducible
  transcription factor that inactivates JUN, thereby regulating the hypoxia process.
  (B) Heatmap and hierarchical clustering show JUN downregulated under hypoxic conditions
  and upregulated under reoxygenation. (C) In the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, cellular
  stress leads to Bak oligomerization, which permeates the mitochondrial outer membrane,
  releasing apoptogenic factors, including cytochrome c. In the cytosol, cytochrome
  c activates caspase 9, which cleaves and activates executioner caspases, such as
  caspase 6 and 7. In the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, ligating death receptors lead
  to the recruitment of adaptor proteins and subsequent activation of caspase 8, which
  activates executioner caspases. In addition, activation of apoptosis by the extrinsic
  pathway was mediated by TNF-α. (D) Heatmap and hierarchical clustering show genes
  regulated under hypoxia conditions and reoxygenation in the apoptosis pathway
