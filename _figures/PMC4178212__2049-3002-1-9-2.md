caption: Activation of p53 is predicted to increase the flux through gluconeogenesis.
  The pathways supplying precursors to gluconeogenesis and the glucogenic pathway
  are depicted. Red arrows represent the transcriptionally-regulated reactions of
  gluconeogenesis. Bold arrows represent reactions predicted to carry higher flux
  in p53-expressing cells according to iMAT. Proteins whose genes are induced by p53
  are depicted in purple rectangles. DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate, G6P, glucose-6-phosphate, iMAT, integrative metabolic analysis tool;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.
