caption: Therapeutic interventions targeting the CXCR2 signaling pathway. (A) CXCR2
  signaling has been shown to be relevant for glioma invasion which was inhibited
  by treatment with an IL-8 antibody in vitro. (B) Proliferation and tumor growth
  are reduced by anti-CXCR2 treatment alone and in combination with anti-VEGFR treatment
  in vivo. (C) Anti-CXCR2 treatment also reduces angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.
  (D) CXCR2 signaling leads to vascular mimicry which is also induced by antiangiogenic
  treatment and can be inhibited by anti-CXCR2 treatment alone and in combination
  with anti-VEGFR treatment in vivo. AAT = antiangiogenic treatment with VEGF/VEGFR
  pathway inhibitors. Created with BioRender.com.
