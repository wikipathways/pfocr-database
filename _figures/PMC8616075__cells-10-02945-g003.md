caption: Excessive energetic substrates in diabetes leads to mitochondrial defects
  that cause reductive stress, oxidative stress, and energy deficit. Decreased insulin
  activity in diabetes provides an excess of circulating energetic substrates (i.e.,
  glucose, free fatty acids) that enter the kidney cells by an unregulated route and
  are used in metabolism. An increase in the glycolytic flux that is not matched by
  an active mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation leads to an accumulation of glycolytic
  intermediates that follow alternative metabolic pathway in the cytosol, which are
  responsible for inflammation, fibrosis, and epigenetic changes. The increased fatty
  acid (FA) oxidation observed in early diabetes, which is driven by PGC1α overexpression,
  leads to increased mitochondrial oxidative stress. During more advanced diabetes,
  mitochondrial defects limit FA oxidation and increase the NADH/NAD redox ratio (reductive
  stress) that restrains the mitochondrial lysine deacetylase, sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) activity.
  SIRT3 deacetylates and activates FA oxidation enzymes, ETC components, and PGC1α.
  Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple pathogenic mechanisms including decreased
  PGC1α -mediated mitochondrial biogenesis and posttranslational modifications of
  mitochondrial proteins (oxidation, lysine acetylation).
