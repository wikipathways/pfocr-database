caption: Overview of the biosynthesis of steroids in mammals. This overview combines
  the classic pathway (in blue) and the backdoor pathway (in red). In the classic
  pathway, cholesterol is converted into pregnenolone through cleavage of the side
  chain, followed by multiple steps towards testosterone synthesis. 3β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD3B2) converts Δ5 steroids to Δ4 steroids. In humans, production
  of testosterone is favored through 17OH-pregnenolone, as the catalytic efficiency
  of CYP17A1 is largely higher with this derivative than with 17OH-progesterone. The
  backdoor pathway bypasses production of dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione.
  Actions of 5α-reductase of type 1 (SRD5A1) and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C4)
  lead to production of androsterone, the major androsteroid of this pathway.
