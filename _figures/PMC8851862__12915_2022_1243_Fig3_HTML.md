caption: Functional convergences of gene losses between NMRs and BMRs in DDR pathway.
  A part of DNA damage response pathway is represented. Genes highlighted in green
  and blue are gene losses from NMRs and BMRs, respectively, and the gene highlighted
  in orange indicates shared gene loss between NMRs and BMRs
