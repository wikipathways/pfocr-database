caption: UPRmt signal transduction pathway in mammals and worms. Upon mitochondrial
  proteotoxic stress, CLPP‐1 activity is required to induce UPRmt. In C. elegans,
  peptides processed by CLPP‐1 are exported into the cytosol by the transporter protein
  HAF‐1 and attenuate mitochondrial protein import. Consequently, the transcription
  factor ATFS‐1, which would normally be degraded in the matrix by Lon protease, accumulates
  in the cytosol. Upon accumulation, ATFS‐1 translocates to the nucleus together with
  DVE‐1 and UBL‐5 to activate UPRmt responsive genes. Protein translation can be attenuated
  in a complementary pathway that depends on ROS signaling. In mammals, it is not
  completely clear how the signal is propagated to the nucleus. ClpP activity is also
  required for mammalian UPRmt induction, although the putative transporter protein
  (HAF‐1 ortholog) is yet to be identified. Furthermore, it involves attenuation of
  mitochondrial import through YME1L1‐mediated degradation of TIM23 component (TIM17A).
  Activation of JNK2 kinase and subsequent activation of transcription factor c‐Jun
  induces expression of CHOP and C/EBPß leading to the induction of UPRmt responsive
  genes. PKR inhibits translation through the phosphorylating eIF2α, and is also involved
  in c‐Jun activation. The UPRmtsignaling components confirmed in worms are depicted
  in gray, the mammalian confirmed signaling components in blue, and proteins confirmed
  in both are shown in purple.
