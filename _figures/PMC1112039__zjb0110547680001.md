caption: A comparison of the V. harveyi and V. fischeri quorum-sensing systems. Parts
  of the pathway in V. fischeri are modeled after those described for V. harveyi and
  are described further in the text. The colors reflect proteins that are homologous
  between the two species. The acyl-HSL synthases are depicted as ovals. Although
  the V. fischeri AinS and LuxS proteins are homologous to LuxM and LuxS of V. harveyi,
  the acyl-HSL signaling molecules (represented by small circles) produced by the
  different bacteria are distinct. It is not known whether sRNAs are involved in bioluminescence
  control in V. fischeri. OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane.
