caption: 'The top of the figure illustrates the two firsts pathways arising from a
  naïve B-cell and characterized by a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7. Pathway
  n°1 is supposed not to pass through the germinal center. SMZL developed from this
  pathway presents a repertory bias with a preferential use of IGHV1-2*04 and is supposed
  not to undergo somatic hypermutation. Pathway n°2 is supposed to pass through the
  germinal center where somatic hypermutation happens, and mutations involving the
  non-canonical NFκB pathway and NOTCH1/2 are added (sometimes associated with KLF2
  mutations). The third pathway is characterized by mutations of DNA repair genes
  (TP53) or TLRs genes (MYD88). More studies are required to precisely define these
  pathways and correlate them with histological patterns, immunohistochemistry, and
  clinical data (particularly prognosis). Created with BioRender.com. Abbreviations:
  BIRC3, baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 3; IGVH, immunoglobulin G heavy
  chain; KLF2, Krüppel-like factor 2; MYD88, myeloid differentiation primary response
