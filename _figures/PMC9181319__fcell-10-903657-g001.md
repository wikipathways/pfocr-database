caption: The RANK/RANKL/OPG signaling pathway in bone. RANKL is produced by osteoblasts
  in membrane form and is cleaved by metalloproteinases to its soluble form. The soluble
  form of RANKL is neutralized by circulating OPG or is bound to RANK at the osteoclast
  membrane, inducing a signaling cascade involving TRAF−2, −5, −6, PI3K, and MAPK,
  leading to the activation of the transcription factors NFATC1 and NF-κB, which are
  essential for bone resorption. Mature osteoclasts can also produce small extracellular
  RANK vesicles on their surface. These vesicles bind to the membrane form of RANKL
  on osteoblasts, inducing reverse signaling and promoting osteoblast differentiation.
