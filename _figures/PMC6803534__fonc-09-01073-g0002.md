caption: Immunotherapy against PD-1/PD-Ls in gynecological cancers. Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1
  immune checkpoint pathway by anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies suppresses cancer
  cell survival and enhances the antitumor responses of T cells, leading to tumor
  regression and rejection. Actually, several clinical trials are ongoing testing
  anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade alone or in combination, in patients with endometrial,
  cervical, vulvar, and ovarian cancer, while there are no ongoing clinical trials
  using anti- PD-L2. In all gynecological cancers ORR is around 10–15%, argues for
  combinatorial treatments are taken in consideration.
