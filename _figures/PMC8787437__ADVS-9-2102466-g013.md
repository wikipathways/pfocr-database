caption: 'A) Schematic diagram of nanocarrier transport. Five potential pathways for
  the transepithelial transport of nanocarriers: a) transcellular pathway; b) paracellular
  pathway through TJs located between epithelial cells; c) receptor‐mediated endocytosis;
  d) adsorptive‐mediated endocytosis; and e) M cell‐associated pathway across the
  epithelium. B) Mechanisms of stimulus‐responsive drug release: pH, temperature,
  redox potential, enzyme, light, or ultrasound stimulation changes nanocarrier structure
  (swelling or degradation), which leads to drug release. C) The potential antidiabetic
  mechanisms of NPs containing elements with insulin‐like activities (selenium, zinc,
  chromium, vanadium, and so forth). (↑): activation or increase, (↓): inhibition
  or decrease, (┤): inhibition, (?): not clear, HbA1c: Hemoglobin A1c, IRS‐1: insulin
  receptor substrate‐1, NPs: nanoparticles, SeCys: selenocysteine, GPx: glutathione
  peroxidase, and NO: nitric oxide. D) Inhibition of diabetes and the complications
  through the antioxidant activity of NPs. (↑): activation or increase, (↓): inhibition
  or decrease, (┤): inhibition, P38 MAPK: P38‐mitogen‐activated protein kinase, JAK:
  Janus tyrosine kinase, JNK: Jun N‐terminal kinase, Nf‐ĸB: nuclear factor‐ĸB, NPs:
  nanoparticles, and TGF‐β: transforming growth factor beta. Signal transduction pathways
  mediated by P38 MAPK, JAK, JNK, JUN, Nf‐kB and TGF‐β promote the occurrence and/or
  development of diabetic complications.'
