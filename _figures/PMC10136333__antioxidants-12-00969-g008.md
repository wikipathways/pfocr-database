caption: A schematic diagram of the underlying mechanisms of the effect of EGCG on
  SE-induced leukocyte infiltration. SE led to NF-κB-mediated MCP-1 induction in microglia,
  which was attenuated by EGCG. Released MCP-1 from microglia recruited blood-derived
  monocytes and activated MIP-2 upregulation in astrocytes via the CCR2-67LR-ERK1/2
  signaling pathway. EGCG and U0126 also attenuated MIP-2 induction in astrocytes
  by facilitating 67LR-mediated ERK1/2 inactivation, which ameliorated neutrophil/monocyte
  infiltration.
