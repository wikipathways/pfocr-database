caption: 'Microarray analysis also indicated an increase in Wnt signaling and cell
  cycle regulation in women. (A) Increased turnover of epithelial cells is associated
  with an increase in expression of genes in the Wnt β Catenin signaling pathway with
  downstream nuclear effectors such as SOX, HDAC1. (B) A compensatory increase in
  cell cycle regulation via the G1/S Checkpoint was also observed at the transcriptional
  level. (Red: Increase in expression, Green: decrease in expression).'
