caption: Model of the role of Asc1 in translation initiation. (A) Schematic representation
  of the interactions of Asc1 and AIMPs with eIF2, eIF3a, and Rps0a/uS2 (40S ribosomal
  subunit). (B) Asc1 functions as an accessory protein interacted with multiple protein
  complexes, including eIF2, eIF3, and the 40S ribosomal subunit, to stabilize the
  formation of the 43S preinitiation complex in the assembly of the elongation-competent
  80S ribosome. The results of this study demonstrate that the defect of the interaction
  between eIF3a and Rps0A/uS2 in the asc1 mutant was ahead of and not due to the activation
  of the Gcn2-eIF2α signaling pathway. (C) MRS and ERS associated with eIF3a. Coimmunoprecipitation
  was performed with extracts prepared from strains expressing the proteins of interest
  in the presence or absence of Asc1. GFP-Trap affinity resin was used to pull down
  the GFPs. Immunoprecipitates (IPs) were analyzed by Western immunoblotting using
  antibodies against GFP and Flag. The levels of Flag-tagged proteins in the asc1-deleted
  strain relative to that in the wild type (given as averages from three independent
  experiments) are indicated beneath each lane.
