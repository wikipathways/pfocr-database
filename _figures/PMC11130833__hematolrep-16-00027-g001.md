caption: 'Molecular activity of BTK- and BCL2- inhibitors in CLL. The interaction
  between the B cell receptor (BCR) and its antigen stimulates BTK activity through
  the SYK protein kinase and the BLNK adapter protein, resulting in the transcriptional
  activation of genes linked with B cell proliferation and survival. In CLL, the BCR
  signaling pathway is frequently hyperactivated. Consistently, BTK inhibitors impair
  this signaling cascade by binding covalently or non-covalently to BTK. On the other
  hand, the physiological role of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 is to sequester
  BAX, hampering its dimerization with BAK, resulting in heightened cell survival
  through the impairment of apoptosome formation. Cellular damage causes the inhibition
  of BCL2 through the BH3-only proteins, stimulating the formation of the BAX-BAK
  dimer, which promotes cellular death. In the context of CLL, BCL2 is frequently
  found to be overexpressed, and, for this reason, the BH3 mimetic venetoclax is used
  to hamper BCL2 activity, resulting in the induction of apoptosis. Abbreviations:
