caption: Proposed mechanisms of toxicity in SOD1-mediated ALS. (A) Excitotoxicity
  is the hyperactivation of motor neurons resulting from failure to rapidly remove
  neurotransmitter glutamate from synapses due to deficiency in the glutamate transporter
  EAAT2 in the neighboring astrocytes. (B) ER stress is induced by abnormal interactions
  of mutant SOD1 with ER proteins (see text for details). (C) Proteasome inhibition
  due to “overload” of the proteasome degradation pathway with ubiquitinated misfolded
  protein aggregates may damage astrocytes and motor neurons. (D) Mitochondrial dysfunction
  mediated by mutant SOD1 deposition on the mitochondrial membrane provokes release
  of cytochrome c in motor neurons, whereas in astrocytes it leads to nitroxidative
  stress. (E) Toxic extracellular mutant SOD1 is secreted from motor neurons and astrocytes
  (not depicted) after interaction with components of neurosecretory vesicles. (F)
  Superoxide production from microglia or astrocytes can damage neighboring motor
  neurons. (G) Altered axonal transport including an increase in retrogradely transported
  stress-related proteins was reported in mutant SOD1-expressing motor neurons. (H)
  Synaptic vesicle defects such as stalling and loss from distal synapse in vulnerable
  motor neurons is an early event in ALS. (I) Loss of tight junction proteins within
  capillary endothelial cells results in the disruption of the blood–spinal cord barrier
  and the occurrence of microhemorrhages within the spinal cord well before disease
  onset.
