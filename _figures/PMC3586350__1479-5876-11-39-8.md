caption: Schematic representation of proposed Adipose Stromal Cell-derived IL-6 signaling
  pathway. The ADSC-secreted cytokine IL-6 and growth factors, which enhance the proliferation
  of cardiomyocytes through canonical signaling i.e. STAT3 activation and through
  non-canonical signaling i.e. Erk1/2 activation. The balance between STAT3 and Erk1/2
  signaling is governed by STAT3, which can suppress Erk1/2 activation, through an
  unknown intermediate. In the absence of STAT3 signaling, IL-6-RAS-activated Erk1/2
  can compensate for the potential loss of stimulatory effect on the proliferation
  on cardiomyocytes.
