caption: Two major pathways are involved in bile acid synthesis. The neutral (or classic)
  pathway is controlled by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in the endoplasmic
  reticulum. The acidic (or alternative) pathway is controlled by sterol 27-hydroxylase
  (CYP27A1) in mitochondria. The sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) is required to synthesis
  of cholic acid (CA). The oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) is involved in the formation
  of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in acidic pathway. The neutral pathway is also able
  to form CDCA by CYP27A1.
