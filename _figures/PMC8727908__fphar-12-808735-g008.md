caption: EMP controls myofibroblast expansion. Shown is a schematic of the transition
  of the epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit (EMTU) of the small airway. Under resting
  conditions, the small airway epithelium interacts with a thin sheath of subepithelial
  fibroblasts. In response to epithelial injury produced by respiratory viruses or
  aero-allergens, growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases released by injured
  epithelium trigger the subepithelial fibroblasts to acquire pro-fibrotic characteristics
  including expression of αSMA, FN1 and COL1 resulting in ECM expansion of the lamina
  reticularis of the airway.
