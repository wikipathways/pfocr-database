  oxidation to pyruvate via glycolysis is a fast reaction generating 2 mol of ATP
  per mol glucose. This aerobic glycolysis is complemented by the PPP that can produce
  further metabolic precursor molecules and is involved in ROS production. Pyruvate
  can be converted to lactate or can be further oxidized to acetyl-CoA entering the
  mitochondrial TCA cycle (yellow box). The TCA cycle (red box) generates reducing
  equivalents NADH and FADH2 which are utilized in the mitochondrial respiratory chain
  to build up the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane by complexes
  I–IV of the respiratory chain. As a by-product, ROS and RNS are produced. Oxidative
  phosphorylation produces larger amounts of ATP (36–38 mol/mol glucose) by complex
  V. Immune cells are also able to utilize substrates such as glutamine, which enters
  these pathways via the TCA metabolite α-ketoglutarate, and fatty acids, which are
  oxidized to acetyl-CoA via β-oxidation. Granulocytes and M1 macrophages have a highly

  and respiratory chain activity is kept at low level. Tn, Tm, and Treg cells as well

  fatty acids and glutamine in order to fuel the TCA cycle (red box). Teff cells have
  a highly active metabolism including all of the pathways described (green box).
