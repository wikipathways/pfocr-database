caption: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the severity sub‐phenotypes and
  functional analysis. (A) Volcano plot representing DEGs are shown with log2 fold
  change of ±1 and adjusted p‐value <.05 in different disease sub‐phenotypes; moderate
  versus mild, severe versus mild, mortality versus mild, severe versus moderate,
  mortality versus moderate, mortality versus severe. (B) Bar plot for the total count
  of significantly upregulated and downregulated genes in clinical sub‐phenotypes;
  Venn diagram illustrating the unique and shared significant DEGs among the comparison
  groups. (C) The DEG profile of study‐specific genes on an average log2 scale of
  normalised counts per million. (D) Dot plot visualisation of enriched pathways for
  different sub‐phenotypes; the colour of the dots represents upregulation and downregulation;
  the size of dots represents the combined score that displays the significance of
  the gene set with their respective pathway. (E and F) Protein–protein interaction
  (PPI) network of study‐specific DEGs across (E) moderate versus mild and (F) mortality
  versus mild, moderate and severe. The red circles represent the upregulated genes,
  the green circle represents the downregulated genes, and the small circles represent
  the interacting genes of the network
