caption: Three-state model for myosin VI kinetic cycle. (a) Schematic of kinetic pathway
  (based on de la Cruz et al. ()) showing which states are grouped together or ignored
  in the simplified kinetic model. (Green) States in which myosin is bound to actin
  in the absence of nucleotide. (Yellow) States in which myosin is detached or weakly
  bound to the actin filament. (Red) States in which myosin is bound to actin and
  ADP. The remaining states (gray) are assumed to have negligible contributions. (b)
  Cartoon of the modeled kinetic cycle of a single myosin head. States and transitions
  between states are colored to match panel a. The prestroke state (yellow box) is
  bound to ADP.Pi (green circle) and unbound from actin. At rate krebind, myosin rebinds
  to actin, releases phosphate, and strokes, bringing it to a poststroke state (red
  box) where it is bound to actin and ADP (red circle). Note that krebind may actually
  be limited by phosphate release or the weak to strong transition instead of rebinding.
  ADP is released at rate kADPoff to enter a state where the motor is in a poststroke
  conformation and bound to actin but not nucleotide (green box). The cycle is completed
  when myosin binds ATP at rate kATPon and releases from the actin filament. (c) Diagram
  of transitions in a dimeric motor, highlighting the paths that predominate with
  different mechanisms of gating. Motor begins in state A, and forward steps are directed
  toward the left (black arrow). Myosin heads are marked as containing ATP or ADP.Pi
  (green dot), ADP (red dot), or no nucleotide (no dot) at the nucleotide binding
  site. Transitions that are in competition with rebinding (thinner arrows) have low
  probabilities because the rebinding rate is the fastest rate in the cycle. Shading
  indicates the predominant pathways in the case of gating of ADP release (pink);
  in the case of gating of ATP binding (green shading, which includes the pink shaded
  region); and in the case of no gating (blue shading, which encompasses all states).
  Inhibition marks indicate rates that are slowed by gating of ADP release (red) or
  gating of ATP binding (green).
