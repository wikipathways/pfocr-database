caption: A schematic representation of the relationship between AR activity and PSMA
  expression, and the strategy to exploit this relationship for PET imaging. Several
  reports have shown that PSMA is an androgen repressed gene, and that AR inhibition
  elevates PSMA expression. ChIP-Seq data has shown AR to bind the PSMA gene, advancing
  the putative mechanism outlined in this figure.
