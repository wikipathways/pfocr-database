  preoptic area and anterior hyopothalamus (PO/AH), and peripherally by ACh. The fibers
  descend through the ipsilateral brainstem and medulla to synapse with the intermediolateral
  cell column neurons. The preganglionic fibers emerge from the anterior roots to
  reach (via the white rami communicantes) the chain ganglia. Unmyelinated postganglionic
  sympathetic class C fibers arise from the sympathetic ganglia to join the major
  peripheral nerves to reach the sweat glands, providing them with cholinergic innervations
  (Figure modified from ). (B) Diagram of the sudomotor axon reflex. The sudomotor

  impulse travels orthodromically to a neighboring population of eccrine sweat glands
  causing an indirect axon mediated sweat response [AXR (1) and AXR (2) sweating].'
