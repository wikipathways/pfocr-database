caption: Advances of the STAT3 signaling pathways involving breast cancer proliferation
  and apoptosis. Classical IL-6 /JAK/STAT3 pathways can activate the transcription
  of cyclin D-1, c-myc, bcl-2 and Bax to promote the proliferation and inhibit the
  apoptosis of breast cancer. miR-125a, miR-25-3p and p16 can promote the binding
  of IL-6 to its receptors, whereas Wwox has the opposite effect. CCL-18 binding to
  its receptor can activate the phosphorylation of STAT3, which can be inhibited by
  IL-32θ. The circuit loop of phosphorylated STAT3, TMEM16A and EGF leads to continuous
  activation of STAT3. miR-93-5p, SMYD2, TRIM14 and PKT-M2 induce the activation of
  STAT3, whereas miR-124 and miR-9 inhibit the activation of STAT3 and breast cancer
  proliferation. Let-7a-5p, hnRN-A and phosphorylated STAT3 dimers form a circuit
  loop to upregulate PKM2 and promote the proliferation and inhibit the apoptosis
  of breast cancer cells. DPF3 suppressed by phosphorylated STAT3 can promote breast
  cancer proliferation. Additionally, transcription factor EB (TFEB) can combine with
  phosphorylated STAT3 dimers to promote the transcription of target genes involved
  in breast cancer proliferation
