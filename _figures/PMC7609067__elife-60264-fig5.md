caption: (Left) Wnt signaling triggers the assembly of 2D membrane clusters containing
  the receptors Frizzled and LRP as well as Dvl, Axin, and other components of destruction
  complex, thus disrupting destruction complex regulating degradation of β-catenin.
  Consequently, β-catenin accumulates and enters the nucleus, where it may localize
  to condensates at super-enhancers to elicit the transcription of target genes. (Right)
  In the absence of a Wnt ligand, Axin, and APC assemble into a destruction complex
  condensate that recruits kinases such as GSK3 and casein kinase I (CKI). This in
  turn promotes phosphorylation of β-catenin and subsequent ubiquitin-mediated degradation
  of β-catenin by the proteasome. Ubiquitination of phosphorylated β-catenin is mediated
  by the ubiquitin ligase SCFβTrCP.
