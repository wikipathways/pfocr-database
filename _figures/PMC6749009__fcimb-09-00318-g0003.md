caption: 'Translational regulation in response to glucose availability: The presence
  of glucose results in the activation of PKA promoting high levels of protein biogenesis.
  At the translational level, this may be achieved through the phosphorylation of
  Dcp1/2 or Pat1. Phosphorylation of the decapping enzymes may weaken interactions
  with the 5′ cap, instead allowing the translational machinery to associate with
  the mRNA. PKA may also act to stimulate translation through post-translational modifications
  of Pab1. Snf1 kinase is known to promote the transcription of the alternative carbon
  utilization pathway. Long term effects of its deletion may promote a proteome that
  is already preadapted to glucose mediated translational suppression.'
