caption: A schematic diagram of VWA1 and Rac2’s roles in condylar cartilage under
  mechanical stress. VWA1 mediated compensatory responses via regulating FGF9/FGFR3
  pathway with upregulation of anabolic COL2A1 and ACAN as well as anti-apoptotic
  Bcl2, contributing to homeostatic maintenance. Rac2 mediated decompensatory responses
  via regulating p38 MAPK pathway with upregulation of catabolic MMP13 and ADAMTS5
  as well as apoptotic Caspase3, contributing to homeostatic disruption

  FGF9/FGFR3 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways in condylar chondrocytes under distinct
