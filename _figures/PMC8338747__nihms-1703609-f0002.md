caption: Treg conversion to exTregs involves inhibition of CD25 and Foxp3 expression.
  The signaling pathways, transcription factors, and cytokines or chemokines, and
  their receptors that are involved in exTreg conversion are shown, along with factors
  responsible for the maintenance of Foxp3 stability in Tregs. (A) TCR activation
  induces PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling which inhibits CD25 expression. mTOR induces proteasomal
  degradation of Foxp3 through E3 ubiquitin ligase Stub-1 and thus represses Foxp3/PTEN
  mediated inhibition of PI3K (, ). Foxp3 mediated upregulation of PTEN is important
  for Treg stability. (B) The anti-inflammatory factor DEL-1 binding to integrin receptor
  αvβ3 on Tregs induces heterodimerization of the transcription factors RUNX1-CBFβ.
  This heterodimer binds to the CNS2 region of the Foxp3 promoter to induce Foxp3
  expression and inhibit Eomes transcription, thus preventing Eomes mediated Foxp3
  suppression (). (C) The proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 binds to its receptor, IL-6R,
  to induce JAK2/STAT3 signaling. IL-6 induces expression of DNMT3a, which binds to
  and induces methylation of the Foxp3 enhancer region, inhibiting Foxp3 expression.
  Transcription factor Blimp1 inhibits DNMT3a transcription and maintains Treg stability
  (). (D) Alarmin IL-33 binds to its cognate receptor, ST2, induces GATA3 recruitment
  to the Foxp3 and St2 promoters, amplifying stable Foxp3 expression. IL-23 inhibits
  IL-33/ST2 signaling. Alarmin IL-1 inhibits Foxp3 expression via the mTORC1/HIF1α
  pathway (). Created with BioRender.com.
