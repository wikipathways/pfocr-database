caption: Hypothetical Model of Chemoresistance in Human Ovarian Cancer Cells. In a
  chemosensitive ovarian cancer cell (A), cisplatin increases p53 content, leading
  to upregulation of proteins promoting cell cycle arrest, such as p21, and of pro-apoptotic
  proteins such as Bax and Fas. This activates both the intrinsic (mitochondrial)
  and extrinsic (death-receptor) apoptotic pathways, the overall result of which is
  the activation of the execution caspase-3 (and -7, not shown). In these cells, cell
  survival mediators such as Xiap, Akt, and Flip (shown in red) are downregulated
  or are in their inactive state. Prohibitin may also play a role in inhibiting cell
  cycle progression through the Rb-E2F pathway by binding to Rb. Conversely, in a
  chemoresistant cell (B), increased p53 ubiquitination by MDM2 results in the maintenance
  of low levels of p53, despite the presence of cisplatin. Moreover, cisplatin fails
  to downregulate Xiap, thereby maintaining an active state of the PI3K/Akt pathway.
  In addition, binding of TNFR2 by TNFα leads to upregulation of FLIP through the
  NFκB pathway, thus inhibiting the pro-apoptotic actions of the cytokine through
  TNFR1. Overall, as a consequence of a failure to activate the caspase cascade in
  response to the chemotherapeutic agent, these cells have lost their capacity to
  undergo apoptosis, and thus became chemoresistant.
