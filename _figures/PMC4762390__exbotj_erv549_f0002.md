caption: Biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanins. This pathway is constructed based on
  the KEGG pathway and literary references. Dk, dihydrokaempferol; Ka, kaempferol;
  Ap, apigenin; Pg, pelargonidin; Pt, petunidin; Pn, peonidin; Dp, delphinidin; Mv,
  malvidin; Rham, rhamnose; Hex, hexose; Coumaroyl, coumaric acid; Caffeoyl, caffeic
  acid; Feruoyl, ferulic acid; A, Atlanic potato; H, Hongyoung potato; J, Jayoung
  potato. Each colored cell represents the normalized intensity of each compound ion
  according to the color scale (six biological replicates×three cultivars, n=18).
  Box-and-whisker plots are shown for changes of phenylprophanoids, polyamine conjugates,
  flavone glycosides, flavonol glycosides, dihydroflavonol glycosides, and anthocyanins
  in each potato cultivar. Maximum and minimum values of a metabolite among six biological
  replicates are represented at the upper and lower ends of the whisker, respectively,
  and their 75th and 25th percentiles are represented at upper and lower ends of the
  box, respectively.
