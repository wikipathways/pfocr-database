caption: Signal transduction initiated by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1).
  The increase of the lysyl oxidase (LOX) mRNA and activity induced by TGF-β1 is mediated
  through the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), drosophila
  mothers against decapentaplegic protein 3 (Smad3), and mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MAPKs) pathways. The reciprocities among these signalling pathways have
  been noticed. Akt phosphorylation and the increase in total Akt expression are PI3K-dependent.
  Moreover, the activation of p38-MAPK is necessary for the induction of TGF-mediated
  Smad3 signalling. Meanwhile, there is a cross communication between the PI3K and
  Smad3 signalling pathways in which the inhibition of Smad3 reduces the activation
  of Akt by TGF-β1 and that PI3K inhibition reduces the activation of Smad3. In MAPK
  signalling pathway, TGF-β1 induces the phosphorylation of p38-MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) and extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2). Moreover,
  TGF-β1-mediated increase in expression of bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1) may
  also activate TGF-β1 and provide positive feedback to generate more LOX in the formation
  of the extracellular matrix (ECM). ➀ represents the MAPK pathway; ➁ represents the
  Smad3 pathway; ➂ represents the PI3K pathway [, , , ]
