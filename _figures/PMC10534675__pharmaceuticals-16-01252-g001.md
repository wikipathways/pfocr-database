caption: 'Patients with connective tissue diseases (CTD) may develop pulmonary hypertension
  (PH) belonging to different groups: (1) pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), (2)
  PH due to left heart disease, (3) PH secondary to lung disease and/or hypoxia (CTD
  patients mostly develop interstitial lung disease), and (4) chronic thromboembolic
  pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), especially in the setting of antiphospholipid syndrome
  (APS). A specific treatment for PAH-CTD is currently available and recommended (solid
  arrows): prostacyclin derivative (treprostinil, epoprostenol, iloprost, selexipag),
  nitric oxide and natriuretic pathway: stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC:
  riociguat) and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5i: sildenafil, tadalafil) and
  endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA: bosentan, macitentan, ambrisentan). Two other
  pathways are under intensive investigation (dashed arrows): (1) affecting BMPR2:
  trapping the ligands of TGF-β and reducing the activity of ACTRIIA (sotatercept,
  KER-012) or inhibiting PDGFR (imatinib, seralutinib), (2) inhibiting the serotonin
  pathway by blocking the serotonin-producing enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (rodatristat
  ethyl).'
