caption: The signalling pathways mediated by vGPCR. Constitutive active vGPCR promotes
  the transcription of inflammatory cytokines and cell transformation. vGPCR through
  the Rac-NF-κB pathway promotes production of proinflammatory cytokines that in turn
  leads to recruitment and transformation of neighbouring cells by a paracrine mechanism.
  The pathway indicated by the red arrows show the activation of the P38 signalling
  pathway with the consequent increase in VEGF and bFGF production and secretion.
  The pathway indicated by the blue arrows shows the inactivation of pro-apoptotic
  genes (PAGI) and the activation of survival genes (SGEA). The green arrow shows
  activation of Akt/PKB by vGPCR-induced VEGF leading to cell survival.

  description: The signalling pathways mediated by vGPCR. Constitutive active vGPCR
    promotes the transcription of inflammatory cytokines and cell transformation.
    vGPCR through the Rac-NF-κB pathway promotes production of proinflammatory cytokines
    that in turn leads to recruitment and transformation of neighbouring cells by
    a paracrine mechanism. The pathway indicated by the red arrows show the activation
    of the P38 signalling pathway with the consequent increase in VEGF and bFGF production
    and secretion. The pathway indicated by the blue arrows shows the inactivation
    of pro-apoptotic genes (PAGI) and the activation of survival genes (SGEA). The
    green arrow shows activation of Akt/PKB by vGPCR-induced VEGF leading to cell
    survival.
