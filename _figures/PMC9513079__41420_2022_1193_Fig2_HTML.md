caption: LSC interact and adhere to various niche cells (such as MSCs, osteoblasts,
  adipocytes, and endothelial cells) and various ECM molecules secreted by them. The
  interaction between LSC and BMM can activate many important signaling pathways,
  thereby regulating the biological function of LSC and remodeling BMM accordingly.
  (1) The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis plays a key role in LSC maintenance and can activate multiple
  signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR, to regulate the survival and proliferation
  of LSC []; (2) The interaction between VLA4 from LSC cells and fibronectin (FN)
  from MSCs activates the PI3K/AKT/BCL2 pathway, allowing LSCs to be resistant to
  cytotoxic drugs []; (3) The binding of E-selectin to CD44 activates the Wnt [] and
  PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway [], and promotes LSC survival; (4) The binding
  of Jagged to Notch activates the Notch signaling pathway, and the intracellular
  domain NICD of Notch is then released and translocated into the nucleus to activate
  the transcription of related genes []; (5) Hypoxia can promote the HIF-1α-VEGF signaling
  pathway and angiogenesis. In addition, NF-κB can promote the production of MMPs
  and VEGF, which in turn accelerates angiogenesis []; (6) LSC-secreted exosomes can
  induce the expression of DKK1 in MSCs, a suppressor of normal hematopoiesis and
  osteogenesis, thereby leading to the loss of osteoblasts []. BCL-2 B-cell lymphoma
