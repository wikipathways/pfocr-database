caption: The network consists of 35 nodes and includes 11 out of 12 differentially
  expressed proteins (shaded green). Note the interactions of NASP, RPS10, HSPA8,
  and HSPA1B with TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6), a key factor acting upon
  the TNFα/TGFβ signaling axis, as well as the involvement of NFκB-, HSP-70-, TP53-,
  and IFNγ-associated pathways.
