caption: mTORis reduce the number and function of Tregs via multiple mechanisms to
  inhibit tumor progression. The canonical PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling cascade is initiated
  when PI3K activates and phosphorylates downstream Akt. Activated Akt then inhibits
  TSC1/2, thereby lifting TSC1/2 inhibition on Rheb. The activated Rheb subsequently
  activates mTORC1. mTOR inhibitors regulate CD4+ T cell differentiation by inhibiting
  mTORC1, thereby restricting CD4+ T cell differentiation and subsequently reducing
  Treg populations. Additionally, mTORis inhibit mTORC1, which leads to decreased
  FOXP3 expression, reduced glycolysis, and enhanced fatty acid oxidation, ultimately
  resulting in reduced Treg populations. These Tregs promote distant tumor metastasis
  through increased IL-10 secretion and inhibited IL-2 production. Through this pathway
  of reducing Treg populations via mTORC1 inhibition, mTORis effectively inhibit tumor
  progression. Rheb, Ras homolog enriched in brain; Treg, regulatory T cell; CD4+
  T cell, cluster of differentiation 4 T cell; Th17 T cell, T helper 17 cell; FOXP3,
