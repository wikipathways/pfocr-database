caption: The recognized receptors for TRAIL. TRAIL connects with two agonistic receptors,
  termed TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (DR5), and three antagonistic receptors, termed
  TRAIL-R3 (DcR1), TRAIL-R4 (DcR2) as well as a soluble receptor, known as osteoprotegerin
  (OPG). TRAIL, Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand.
