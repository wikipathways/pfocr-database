caption: 'FAT4 participates in tumor transformation through the Hippo–Wnt signaling
  pathway by inducing YAP–TAZ activation.Notes: Src-mediated tumorigenesis also results
  from Src activation to repress FAT4 gene expression via MEK/ERK or cofilin1. In
  addition, FAT4 interacts with well-known anti-oncogenes through indirect interactions,
  such as p53 and p21. Mutations in p53 and APC are major drivers of tumor development.
  FAT4 is a novel SMG. Solid and dashed lines indicate interactions that appear to
  be direct and indirect, respectively. Oval represents the cell nucleus.'
