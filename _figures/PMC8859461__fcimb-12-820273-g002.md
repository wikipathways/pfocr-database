caption: Proposed model depicting how defect in the FA pathway could induce pathological
  IFN-I production. FA proteins prevent genome instability by repairing DNA damage,
  repressing retrotransposition and allowing accurate cell division. In addition,
  FA proteins modulate anti-oxidative response and participate in mitochondria clearance
  by autophagy and mitophagy processes. Mutations in FA genes or loss of FA proteins
  contribute to DNA damage accumulation, genome instability, reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production and defect in mitochondria’s clearance. Under these pathological
  conditions, many types of self-nucleic acids such as ssDNA and dsDNA (A), micronuclei
  (B) chromatin bridges (C) retroelements (RTE) and R-loops (D), mtDNA/RNA (E), can
  activate type-I Interferon (IFN-I). This would occur by cGAS and RIG-I detection
  of cytosolic DNA and RNA molecules respectively and subsequent production of IFN-I.
  In addition, elevated levels of ROS might contribute to fuel the production of IFN-I
  by creating more DNA and mitochondria damage (F).
