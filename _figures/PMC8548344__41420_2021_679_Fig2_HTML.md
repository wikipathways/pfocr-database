caption: β-catenin is a target gene of Hh/Gli2 signalling. Hh signalling can enhance
  Wnt signalling by inducing the expression of β-catenin in the colon during IBD and
  CAC. Epithelial Ihh and Shh upregulate the expression of Wnt2B in intestinal mesenchymal
  cells during chronic intestinal inflammation. The subepithelial Gli1-positive mesenchymal
  cells express high levels of Wnt2B. Dhh-activated Hh signalling positively regulates
  epithelial cell-produced Wnt2B expression following IEC injury and regeneration.
  Gli1-expressing mesenchymal cells serve as a reserve Wnt source during recovery
  from DSS-induced colitis in mice, thereby enhancing Wnt signalling. Shh is a target
  gene of NK-κB and can be induced by the activation of NK-κB in inflamed intestinal
  epithelial cells. NK-κB mediates NOD2-iNOS/NO-NUMB-mediated Shh signalling activation,
  which plays a role in modulating inflammatory responses in IBD. TNF-a/NF-κB signalling
  promotes the activation of Hh/Gli1/Gli2 signalling in DSS- or AOM/DSS-induced colitis.
  Arrows and blunt ends indicate activation and inhibition, respectively. The blue
  arrows indicate a special condition where Gli1 is overexpressed in mesenchymal cells.

  description: β-catenin is a target gene of Hh/Gli2 signalling. Hh signalling can
    enhance Wnt signalling by inducing the expression of β-catenin in the colon during

    mesenchymal cells during chronic intestinal inflammation. The subepithelial Gli1-positive
