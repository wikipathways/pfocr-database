caption: The allantoin degradation pathway—an adaptation to growth under oxygen-limiting
  conditions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the classical purine degradation pathway,
  xanthine is converted to urate and then to allantoin, in two successive oxidation
  steps catalyzed by the peroxisomal enzymes xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and urate
  oxidase (UOX). XDH genes are present in filamentous fungi but not in yeasts. To
  use purine derivatives as a nitrogen source yeasts must therefore import urate,
  allantoin or allantoate from outside the cell. Yeasts that lack the DAL cluster
  (e.g., Kluyveromyces lactis, Saccharomyces kluyveri, and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii)
  are all able to grow on urate as a sole nitrogen source, presumably using urate
  permease (UAP) to import it, UOX to oxidize it and the DAL pathway enzymes to break
  it down to urea. In contrast, S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces castelli have lost
  the ability to use urate, have no UOX or UAP genes, and instead import allantoin.
  The allantoin permease gene DAL4 is a duplicate of the uracil permease gene FUR4.
  The Dal4 and Fur4 proteins are members of a purine-related transporter family. The
  subsequent degradation steps involve the same DAL pathway genes in all yeasts, but
  in S. cerevisiae and S. castelli the genes have been organized into a cluster and
  the malate synthase gene MLS1 has been duplicated to produce DAL7. MLS1 and DAL7
  both encode malate synthase but they are regulated differently. The glyoxylate cycle
  gene MLS1 is glucose repressed, whereas DAL7 is nitrogen-repressed. The reaction
  catalyzed by UOX requires molecular oxygen as a substrate and takes place in the
  peroxisome. Biochemical reorganization of the purine degradation pathway to enable
  import of allantoin instead of urate eliminates the oxygen-requiring step mediated
  by UOX and coincided with the formation of the DAL gene cluster. This biochemical
  reorganization may have been driven by selection for ability to grow under conditions
  of oxygen limitation. Reproduced from []
