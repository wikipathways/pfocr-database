caption: (A) MMF inhibits IMPDH, suppressing DNA synthesis and ultimately blocking
  the progression of the cell cycle. (B) Tacrolimus and cyclosporine exert their immunosuppressive
  effects by inhibiting calcineurin, which in turn prevents the dephosphorylation
  of NFAT. This inhibition leads to suppression of gene transcription and ultimately
  disrupts the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of T cells. (C) Sirolimus
  inhibits nucleotide synthesis by suppressing the mTOR signaling pathway, consequently
  hindering cell cycle progression. (D) Infliximab binds to transmembrane TNF-α on
  the cell membrane surface, thereby inhibiting its forward signal transduction and
  consequently attenuating inflammatory responses. E. IL-2 binds to IL-2R, enhancing
  the immunosuppressive ability of Treg cells. F. In AIH, B cells generate autoantibodies
  that target liver cells, resulting in inflammation and necrosis. Rituximab specifically
  binds to the CD20 antigen on B cells, leading to their depletion and consequently
  reducing the production of these autoantibodies. G. Belimumab can block the interaction
  between BAFF and its receptor, thereby leading to weakened BAFF receptor signaling
  and inhibiting abnormal B cell activation. (Created with image.medpeer.cn). BAFF,
  B cell-activating factor; AIH, autoimmune hepatitis; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated
  T cells; MMF, mycophenolate mofetil; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL-2, interleukin-2
