caption: In response to invading pathogens, (1) Cytosolic DNA (e.g. viral dsRNA) is
  recognized by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) which converts ATP and GTP to the second
  messenger, cyclic GMP- AMP (cGAMP). cGAMP activates STING (TMEM173) promoting recruitment
  of TBK1. STING promotes activation of TBK1 and subsequent phosphorylation and dimerization
  of IRF3. Translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus promotes transcription of type I inteferons
  (IFNα/β). (2) In response to a viral infection, cytosolic ssRNA or dsRNA are recognized
  by RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). Signals from retinoic
  acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I, DDX58) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein
  5 (MDA5, IFIH1) are transduced through mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein
  (MAVS; a.k.a. IPS1, VISA, CARDIF) to activation IRF3 and NF-κB signaling through
  TBK1 and TRAF proteins []. Translocation of K38/K401-polyubiquitinated and pSer172
  phosphorylated TBK1 to the Golgi apparatus following RLR or TLR3 stimulation requires
  the ubiquitin-binding protein optineurin (OPTN) to promote IRF3/IFN type I signaling
  []. (3) In response to LPS, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is regulated by two supramolecular
  organizing complexes (SMOCs), the myddosome (containing MyD88) and the triffosome
  (containing Trif) []. This pathway can active IRF3 and NF-κB signaling, as well
  as promote metabolic changes (e.g. regulation of glycolysis). (4) TBK1 (and IKKε)
  limit cell death following tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) treatment by promoting
  the phosphorylation of RIPK1 []. This requires NEMO (IKKγ), the linear-ubiquitin
  chain assembly complex (LUBAC), and the known TBK1/IKKε interacting proteins NAP1
  and TANK. TANK-dependent TBK1 signaling has been shown to promote NF-κB activation
  [], although the precise role of TBK1 in regulation NF-κB signaling remains unclear.
