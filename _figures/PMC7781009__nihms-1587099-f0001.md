caption: (A) MET activation is initiated after ligand binding of the hepatocyte growth
  factor (HGF) to the SEMA domain to the extracellular portion of the MET receptor,
  inducing receptor dimerization and phosphorylation of the intracellular domain leading
  to downstream signaling of several pathways. The E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL binds to
  reside Y1003 in the juxtamembrane domain (encoded in part by exon 14), resulting
  in receptor ubiquitination and degradation. MET exon 14 alterations including mutations
  or deletions in splicing regulatory sites, leading to exon skipping, deletion of
  a portion of the juxtamembrane domain, impaired CBL binding, decreased MET turnover,
  and ongoing oncogenic downstream pathway signaling. (B) Point mutations in the tyrosine
  kinase domain result in ligand-independent MET activation through autophosphorylation
  of the tyrosine kinase domain, conveying sustained oncogenic downstream pathway
  signaling. (C) Focal MET amplification leads to higher levels of MET transcription
  and MET expression. MET amplification (high MET/CEP7 ratio) differs from chromosome
  7 polysomy or copy number gain in which the entire chromosome is duplicated (low
  MET/CEP7 ratio). Focal MET amplification and, consequently high MET expression,
  leads to enhanced ligand-independent oncogenic signaling by receptor auto-dimerization
  or oligomerization and auto-phosphorylation. (D) Gene rearrangements involving the
  MET tyrosine kinase domain result in fusion proteins that typically self-dimerize
  in a ligand-independent manner, leading to phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase
  domain.
