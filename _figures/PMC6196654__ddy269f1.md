caption: Network of the two sets of top genes with P-value < 0.01 in the case–control
  and family-based analyses focusing on rare, deleterious variants. The nodes in red
  are the top genes identified in the COPDGene case–control analysis; the nodes in
  pink are the first neighbors of the red nodes; the nodes in blue are the top genes
  identified in the BEOCOPD-ICGN family-based analysis; the nodes in light blue are
  the first neighbors of the blue nodes. Genes that are in both sets are colored in
  purple. Edges connecting genes to the largest hub TULP3 are colored in red. These
  genes form one large well-connected component. Larger sized nodes indicate hubs
  (circle) and genes reported to be associated with COPD or lung function (diamond).
  Hubs include TULP3, VNN2, ACVR2B, KCNA5 and GRB2, which are the top genes with the
  most number of degrees in this network. A total of 14 out of 513 genes are near
  GWAS loci for COPD or lung function (CHRM3, DNLZ, EFEMP1, EFEMP2, EGFL8, GANAB,
  GNG3, PARN, PIP4K2B, NOTCH4, RUVBL1, SEC16A, TARS, TEKT5, THSD4). The zoomed-in
  panel on the left shows the genes in the intraciliary transport particle A pathway
  (GO:0030991). The zoomed-in panel on the right shows the genes in the TGFB-receptor
  binding pathway (GO:0005160) and ACVR2B.
