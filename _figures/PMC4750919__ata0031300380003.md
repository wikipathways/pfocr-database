caption: The potential role of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE)-ligand
  system in the pathophysiology of aortic aneurysms. (1) Ligands that bind to the
  RAGE receptor, such as AGEs, S100, HMGB1, amyloid B, etc., primarily induce inflammation.
  An activated transmembrane RAGE receptor induces cytokine activation and genetic
  transcription within the cell. (2) Other factors, such as hypertension, matrix metalloproteinases,
  atherosclerosis, etc., play a role in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms. (3)
  All these factors activate the inflammatory cascade and produce an inflammatory
  response of the aorta. *RAGE-ligand interaction seems to accelerate the pathogenesis
  through amplifying signal transduction. (4) Soluble receptor for advanced glycation
  end-products (sRAGE) is produced by cleavage of a full-length RAGE receptor or alternative
  splicing of the RAGE mRNA. In the circulation, sRAGE may exert inverse influences
  to RAGE-induced damage.
