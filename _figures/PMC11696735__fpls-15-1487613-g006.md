caption: The biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids in P. odoratum. the average expression
  levels are shown in the heatmaps. One-step reactions are represented with solid
  lines while the dashed lines represented multi-step reactions. The circles represent
  metabolites in pathways and circles filled with red color represent metabolites
  that were identified and significantly accumulated. CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI,
