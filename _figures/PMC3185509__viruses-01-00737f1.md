caption: Activation of antiviral and proinflammatory responses during HSV infections.
  HSV is recognized by cells through several mechanisms. (i) Virus-receptor interactions
  can induce intracellular signal transduction leading to cytokine expression. Potential
  recognition receptors include TLR2 and the virus entry mediators HVEM. (ii) Viral
  genomic DNA is recognized by TLR9 and a DNA receptor in the cytoplasm, including
  RNA polymerase III. (iii) Accumulating of viral dsRNA during viral replication is
  potentially sensed through several mechanisms, including TLR3 and the RLRs. (iv)
  Recognition of the virus results in activated signalling pathways, such as the MAPK
  pathway (AP-1), NF-κB and IRF3/7 regulating the expression of IFN-β and other cytokines.
