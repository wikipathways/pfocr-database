caption: Phase separation-mediated MAPK/ERK activation of T cell signaling pathways.
  a Upon activation of the T cell receptor (TCR) by an MHC-antigen complex, CD45 enzymatic
  activity is disrupted, allowing Lck to phosphorylate the TCR. This event promotes
  the membrane enrichment of ZAP70 protein, which phosphorylates LAT (Linker for Activation
  of T cells). LAT then undergoes phase separation and recruits its binding partner
  proteins, forming signaling complexes that act as upstream signal transducers of
  the MAPK/ERK pathway. This activation cascade ultimately enhances T cell signaling
  and immune responses. b Mutations in the SHP2 protein associated with Noonan syndrome
  and related disorders (NS/NS-ML syndrome) lead to phase separation-mediated recruitment
  of wild-type SHP2 protein. This recruitment enhances activation of the MAPK/ERK
  pathway, contributing to dysregulated cell signaling observed in these syndromes
