caption: 'mtDAMPs in cystic fibrosis Under stress, mitochondria generate and/or release
  immunogenic molecules, named mitochondrial damage associated molecular patters (mtDAMPs),
  that influence significantly the inflammatory response in CF lung disease. The accumulation
  of dysfunctional mitochondria leads to excessive ROS production in CF airway cells
  with detrimental effects on mitochondrial constituents, inducing oxidative damages
  on mtDNA and mitochondrial respiratory complexes or the lipidic peroxidation of
  mitochondrial membranes. The ROS may also active: I) oxidative-stress sensitive
  transcriptor factors, which after nuclear translocation, up-regulate the expression
  of cytokines and inflammasomes; II) or the NLRP3 inflammasome to promote the release
  of interleukine-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes are also activated
  by direct interaction with mtDNA and cardiolipin (CL), released following mitochondrial
  damage or PTP opening, with consequent activation of caspase-1. The abnormal ER-mitochondria
  Ca2+ transfer, due by increased interorganelle crosstalk mediated by VAPB-PTPIP51
  tethering during pathogen infection in CF, contributes to mitochondrial stress inducing
  ROS production, PTP opening and UPRmt activation, which facilitate the activation
  of NF-kB and NLRP3 inflammasome. Increased levels of extracellular ATP, induced
  by P. aeruginosa-ASGMR1 signaling pathway, mediate ionic flux and intracellular
  potassium (K+) depletion through the ATP-binding to ligand-gated ion channels P2X
  receptors, sensitizing the CF airway cells to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Indeed,
  mediating P2Y receptors, the extracellular ATP induces the Ca2+-dependent activation
  of classical Protein Kinase C (PKC) isoforms through the IP3-triggering ER Ca2+-release,
  resulting in NF-kB activation (). Several classes of molecules may exert anti-inflammatory
  activity targeting mitochondria at different levels. In this figure are shown the
  discussed drugs that may counteract the mito-inflammation in CF lung disease. Plasma
