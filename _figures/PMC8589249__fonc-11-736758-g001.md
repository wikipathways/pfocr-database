  to CD30 can result in trimerization and signal mediation through TRAF proteins to
  stimulate the NFκB pathway resulting in CCR7 gene expression (, ). In addition,
  CD30 can signal through MAPK pathways, including ERK1/2 and the nuclear transcription
  factor AP-1, all leading to enhanced CCR7 transcription (, , ). (E) In T-ALL cells,
  release of intracellular Notch1 (ICN1) from membrane-tethered heterodimeric Notch1
  protein upregulates PI3K/mTORC2/NF-κB pathways and activation of the CCR7 gene (,

  of DUSP22 phosphatase thus facilitating the accumulation of activated STAT3 which
  mediates CCR7 gene transcription (). (F) Mutations in the C-terminal amino acid
  Trp355, located in the cytoplasmic region of CCR7, impair internalization upon ligand
  stimulation resulting in increased expression of the surface receptor in ATLL cells
  (, ). (G) Dysregulation of the endocytic machinery of CCR7, e.g. in CLL, impacts
  receptor turn-over and increases CCR7 membrane expression. Deficiency of the cytoplasmic
  p66Shc protein causes enhanced activity of the PP2B/calcineurin phosphatase on the
  endosomal CCR7 pool, which enhances its recycling back to the plasma membrane (,
