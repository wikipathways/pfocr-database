caption: Therapeutic targets of tumor metabolism. Tumor cells have a high glycolytic
  rate and overexpress key enzymes of glucose metabolism. Several drugs have been
  used in preclinical trials to test their effectiveness, such as 2DG, a glucose analog
  whose metabolic product (2-DG-P) is unable to be metabolized, therefore inhibiting
  glycolysis. Oxamic acid is a competitive inhibitor of LDHA, an enzyme overexpressed
  in breast cancer cells; the result of this inhibition is lower levels of lactate,
  a critical oncometabolite for cell migration and tumor progression. In tumor cells,
  approximately 90% of glucose is metabolized to lactate; to replenish the deficit
  of carbon molecules, there is an increase in glutamine metabolism. The ASCT2 transporter
  is overexpressed in breast cancer; glutamine is metabolized in the cytosol to glutamate
  and subsequently transported to the mitochondrial matrix and incorporated into TCA
  in the form of α-KG. The antitumor effect of two glutamine analogs (6-diazo-5-oxa-L-norleucine
  and Aza-L-serine) has been shown. Acetyl-CoA is a central molecule in metabolism
  as it participates in catabolic (glycolysis and beta-oxidation) and anabolic reactions
  (lipogenesis, steroid synthesis, acetylcholine synthesis, etc.). In addition to
  this crucial role in cellular metabolism, Acetyl-CoA is the sole donor of acetyl
  groups for the acetylation of proteins and particularly histones. Histone acetylation
  is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), whereas removal of the acetyl
  group is mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). It has been shown that short-chain
  fatty acids such as valproic acid and butyrate, among others, can inhibit HDACs.
  Increased levels of acetyl-CoA promote fatty acid synthesis associated with FASN
  overexpression. Different inhibitors of the key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis have
  been used (C75, C93, and orlistat, among others), which are inhibitors of the thioesterase
  domain of fatty acid synthase (FASN). The epigenetic mechanism classically described
  is DNA methylation. The pathway that supplies methyl groups for both DNA methylation
  and histone and protein methylation is the one-carbon (1C) pathway metabolism, in
  which two distinct pathways, the folate and methionine cycle, converge, resulting
  in the product S-adenosylmethionine. The epigenetic mechanism classically described
  is DNA methylation. While no inhibitors of these metabolic pathways have been identified,
  several molecules have been used to inhibit the activity of enzymes involved in
  DNA methylation (DNMT1, DNMT3/B).
