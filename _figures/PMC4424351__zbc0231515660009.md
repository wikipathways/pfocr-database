caption: Model for the role of UV radiation in the modulation of STING-dependent IRF3
  activation. Cyclic dinucleotides (3′,3′-cGAMP and c-di-GMP) released during microbial
  infection or 2′,3′-cGAMP produced by cGAS upon binding to cytosolic DNA following
  viral or microbial infection stimulate STING to mediate phosphorylation and activation
  of IRF3 by TBK1, which results in inflammatory and immune responses. These cyclic
  dinucleotides also stimulate an LKB1-AMPKα-ULK1 signaling pathway that inhibits
  the STING pathway. In cells exposed to UV or a UV-mimetic, high levels of DNA damage
  induce apoptotic signaling (mediated by caspases and calpains) that destabilize
  AMBRA1 and ULK1. This loss of the STING negative regulator ULK1 results in an amplified
  response to cytosolic DNA and cyclic dinucleotides.
