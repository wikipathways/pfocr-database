caption: NMN Module Is a Fine Tuner of Nodule NumberNIN and miR172c are positive regulators
  of nodulation, and NNC1 is a repressor of nodulation. The NMN module integrates
  both nodulation signaling and AON signaling pathways to systemically control nodule
  number in legumes. In low-nitrogen conditions, plant exudes flavonoid signals from
  its root, which are perceived by rhizobia to induce the production of Nod factors.
  The Nod factors are perceived by the Nod factor receptors (NFR1α and NFR5α in soybean)
  localized in the plasma membrane of root hair and activate NF signaling pathway.
  The transcription factors, such as GmNINa in soybean, are induced by NF signaling
  to activate the expression of miR172c, which then represses NNC1 expression by cleaving
  its mRNA. NNC1 in turn downregulates the expression of miR172c or interacts with
  GmNINa to repress its binding to miR172c to form a negative feedback loop. GmNINa
  and NNC1 activate or repress the expression of GmRIC1 and GmRIC2 in soybean. GmNINa
  can promote the transcription of GmRIC1 and GmRIC2 alone and/or through alleviating
  NNC1 inhibition on GmRIC1 and GmRIC2 by activating miR172c. The CLE peptides are
  transported to the shoot to activate the nodulation autoregulation receptor, GmNARK
  in soybean, SUNN in Medicago, and HAR1 in Lotus. The activation of AON produces
  the SDIs, including cytokinins, miR2111, or other factors, which are transported
  to the root to inhibit the expression of NIN and GmNINa, leading to suppression
  of the downstream nodulation genes (e.g., EOND40s) that regulate nodulation. In
  high-nitrogen conditions, nitrogen induces the subcellular localization of NLP1
  in Medicago and NRSYM1 in Lotus from cytoplasm to nucleus. NLP1 interacts with NIN
  to repress its activation of downstream target genes. NRSYM1 promotes production
  of CLE peptides to activate AON.
