caption: 'Inducing autophagy independent of the mTOR pathway.The cyclical mTOR-independent
  pathway consists of the cAMP-Epac-PLC-ɛ, phosphoinositol and Ca2+-calpain-GSα pathways
  and has multiple points where it can be modulated to induce autophagy in order to
  treat polyglutamine diseases. Intracellular cAMP levels are increased by adenylyl
  cyclase (AC), which activates Epac, which in turn activates the small G-protein
  Rap2B that activates phospholipase C (PLC)-ɛ. PLC-ɛ activation results in the production
  of IP3 from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and IP3 binds to the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) IP3Rs releasing Ca2+ from ER Ca2+ stores. Intracytosolic Ca2+ levels
  are also increased by Ca2+ influx due to L-type Ca2+ channel agonist binding. Increase
  in intracytosolic Ca2+ activates the cysteine protease calpains which cleave and
  activate GSα. GSα activation results in an increase in AC activity elevating cAMP
  levels, therefore as part of a loop. Activation of this loop pathway inhibits autophagy.
  Drugs targeting targets at different stages within the loop can induce autophagy
  and are protective in various polyglutamine disease models such as: imidazoline-1-receptor
  (I1R) agonists (clonidine and rilmenidine) and the AC inhibitor 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine
  (2′5′ddA) that act to decrease cAMP levels; agents that reduce inositol and IP3
  levels (lithium, L-690,330, sodium valproate and carbamazepine); Ca2+ channel blockers
  (verapamil, loperamide, amiodarone, nimodipine, nitrendipine, niguldipine and pimozide);
  calpain inhibitors (calpastatin and calpeptin) and the GSα inhibitor NF449. JNK
  phosphorylation of Bcl-2 results in the dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin 1 causing
  an induction of autophagy. The thiol antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and glutathione
  inhibit JNK activation and thus inhibit the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 resulting in
  the inhibition of autophagy as shown in cell, fly and zebrafish models of HD.'
