caption: 'Short osmotic stress model. (A) The regulatory part of the model contains
  10 paths in the short time-series data, where each path represents a collection
  of gene expression profiles. The x-axis displays the time points at which gene expression
  is measured. The y-axis shows log2 fold change in expression. The nodes following
  a bifurcation event are annotated with the TFs that are predicted to control the
  split, providing temporal resolution to the static protein–DNA interaction data.
  TFs are only shown the first time they are active along a regulatory path. (B) This
  subset of the oriented interaction network contains three types of nodes: upstream
  proteins given as sources (red), predicted signaling proteins (blue), and active
  TFs from DREM (green). The blue nodes consist of all proteins that appear in at
  least 1% of high-scoring paths and are not sources or targets. Dashed edges are
  protein–DNA interactions, and solid edges are oriented PPIs. (C) An enlarged view
  of a subsection of the interaction network identified shows that the core transcriptional
  unit of the HOG pathway was recovered. These TFs were inferred in the regulatory
  component of the model, and the network displays SDREM''s explanation of how they
  are activated.'
