caption: PARPs regulate the RNA sensors-mediated antiviral innate immune responses.
  (A) ZAP inhibits Sindbis virus (SINV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) probably
  by enhancing the RIG-I signaling pathway. (B) PARP9 recognizes and binds to dsRNA
  from reovirus or poly(I:C) and subsequently binds to and activates the PI3K regulatory
  subunit p85, and then further triggers the downstream AKT3 activation to phosphorylate
  IRF3 and IRF7 for IFN-I production. (C) The infection of vesicular stomatitis virus
  (VSV), influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Sendai virus (SeV), encephalomyocarditis
  virus (EMCV), or herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) could activate the aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor (AhR), which subsequently upregulates the expression of PARP7. PARP7 physically
  interacts with TBK1 and inhibits its activity by ADP-ribosylation, abolishing the
  antiviral IFN-I signaling pathway. Dashed lines indicate uncertain interactions
  or that the underlying mechanism is not known.
