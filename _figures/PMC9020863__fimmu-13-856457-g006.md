caption: Pathogen-encoded miRNAs regulating insect immunity. Pathogen-derived miRNAs
  often translocate via extracellular vesicles (EVs) to regulate insect host immunity.
  Upon fungal invasion, translocated fungal miRNAs downregulate the insect Toll signaling
  pathway by repressing the expression of critical genes, such as Spz4, or inhibiting
  the peroxisome pathway, repressing the expression of the PXE16 gene. At the late
  stage of infection, fungi act by decreasing the expression of their miRNAs to escape
  the melanization process (yellow). Upon viral attacks, translocated virus-derived
  miRNAs act individually or synergistically to negatively regulate the expression
  of insect key genes (Ran, Apaf-1, etc.) by targeting their 3′UTR regions. The latter
  downregulation reduces host miRNAs’ production, leading to viral replication and
  proliferation (purple). However, the figure does not show the bacterial-derived
  miRNAs due to missing data on their role in insect–bacterium interaction.
