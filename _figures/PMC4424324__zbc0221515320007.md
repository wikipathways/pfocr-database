caption: Schematic illustration of integrin-mediated signaling pathway that regulates
  actin polymerization, actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and microcluster formation.
  Binding of ICAM-1 to activated integrin receptors initiates outside-in signaling.
  The ligand binding leads to integrin aggregation and recruitment of scaffolding
  proteins such as integrin-linked kinase (ILK) to cytoplasmic tail of integrins (,
  ). ILK interacts with Particularly interesting Cys-His-rich protein (PINCH) and
  Parvin to form an ILK-PINCH-Parvin (IPP) complex that functions as a signaling platform
  for integrins (, ). This leads to activation of paxillin and proline-rich tyrosine
  kinase 2 (Pyk2) and the formation of Pyk2/Paxillin complexes (). The formation of
  these complexes is facilitated by the interaction with vinculin, talin, and multiple
  F-actin binding and regulating proteins. The latter regulate the Cdc42 pathway,
  which directly controls actin polymerization, cytoskeleton remodeling (), and formation
  and growth of micrtoclusters in distinct, multiple loci. It is also thought that
  vinculin plays an important role in linking de novo actin polymerization to integrin
  activation ().
