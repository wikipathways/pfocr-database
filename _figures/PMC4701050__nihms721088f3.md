caption: Origin and in vitro generation of eCPCs. (A) Lineage tracing method has been
  applied to describe specific stages and the origin of CPCs during heart development.
  Specific marker genes are used to define different stages. In this process, Wnt
  signaling pathway plays important roles. (B) Stage specific differentiation protocol
  of CPCs from ES/iPS cells was generated according to the Wnt signaling pathway.
  An optimized one-step differentiation protocol was developed to generate CPCs in
  plate. Both methods derived CPCs could further differentiate into cardiomyocytes,
  smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells.
