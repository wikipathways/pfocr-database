caption: Proposed mechanisms by which PKM2‐mTORC1 regulatory pathways contribute to
  resistance in RCC cells. Overexpression of PKM2 leads to accumulation of anabolic
  intermediates and activation of mTOR signaling, which promotes utilization of anabolic
  intermediates and inhibits autophagy. Meanwhile, mTORC1 activates PKM2 to form a
  positive loop to enhance the anabolic processes. Signals that activate either PKM2
  or mTORC1 can result in anabolic functions. In this pathway, mRCC cells can be sensitized
  to everolimus by combination treatment with MC‐4 via inhibition of PI3K/PKM2/mTOR
  signaling pathways

  M2 and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 pathways.
