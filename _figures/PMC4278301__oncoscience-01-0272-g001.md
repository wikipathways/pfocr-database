caption: The first reaction of the NAE-synthesis is the N-acylation of phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE), which is catalyzed by N-acyltransferase (NAT). The most important second step
  is a phospholipase (PDL)-type hydrolysis of the resultant N-acylethanolamine-phosphatidylethanolamine
  (NAPE-PE) by the NAPE-PLD leading to the formation of the NAEs, N-arachidonoylethanolamide,
  N-palmitoylethanolamide, and N-oleoylethanolamide and a related substance, N-arachidonoyldopamine
  (NADA). Other suggested pathways are a two-step process involving a PLC-like hydrolysis
  of N-arachidonoyl-PE with subsequent dephosphorylation of anandamide phosphate by
  PTPN22 and the double-deacylation of NAPE by α/β-hydrolase 4 (Abh4) with subsequent
  hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond of the resultant glycero-phospho-NAE (GP-NAE)
  by glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 1 (Gde1). The major pathway for the biosynthesis
  of 2-AG involves sequential hydrolysis of arachidonic acid-containing inositol phospholipids
  by PLC and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL). The degradation of the NAEs as well as
  2-AG is catalyzed by the N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing amidase (NAAA), fatty acid
  amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), respectively, and results
  in arachidonic acid.
