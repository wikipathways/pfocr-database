caption: Schematic illustrating the suppressive effect of 6M3HSC (compound 3) against
  the RAGE-RAGE ligand signaling pathway. A potential mechanism of the suppressive
  effect of this compound 3 on HMGB1-RAGE-ERK 1/2 signaling pathway is shown. The
  interactions of multi-ligands with RAGE up-regulate the RAGE downstream signaling
  pathway. Consequently, RAGE-regulated genetic programs of pro-inflammation and carcinogenesis
  (TEM and oncogenesis) or cell repair and tissue regeneration (homeostasis and ontogenesis)
  start driving by the action of transcription factors, such as NF-κB and AP-1. RAGE
  structure includes the variable (V), constant (C1 and C2) domains, the transmembrane
  region (TM), and the cytoplasmic tail (CT).
