caption: G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway. Human GPCRs are seven-transmembrane
  receptor proteins divided into six classes (A, B1, B2, C, F, and Taste2). They receive
  signals from various stimuli (hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, etc.)
  and transduce the signal through G proteins in the cytosol. G proteins are made
  up of three subunits (α, β, and γ) and are anchored in the plasma membrane by binding
  through the α and γ subunits, while GPCRs bind G proteins through the α subunit.
  In the absence of stimuli, the Gα subunit binds ADP and is inactive. However, upon
  activation, the α subunit binds ATP and dissociates from the β and γ subunits. There
  are four different types of Gα subunits (Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13), which
  further relay the signal to downstream targets, ultimately leading to gene transcription.
  The dissociated Gβ-Gγ dimer also participates in various downstream signaling pathways.
  In cancer, GPCR signaling is altered, leading to the activation of genes involved
  in cancer cell survival and progression.
