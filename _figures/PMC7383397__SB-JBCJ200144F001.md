caption: Lipoprotein biosynthetic pathways with Lnt and Lit N-terminal tailoring.
  The first two steps of the lipoprotein biosynthetic pathway are highly conserved
  in all prokaryotes. Lgt catalyzes thioether bond formation using a glycerophospholipid
  donor, followed by proteolytic cleavage of the signal peptide by Lsp to make DA-LP.
  In E. coli and other Gram-negative bacteria, Lnt then transfers the sn-1 lipid from
  a glycerophospholipid to the α-amino position of a lipoprotein (top). Lit from E.
  faecalis and other Firmicutes is proposed to function as an O-to-N intramolecular
  transacylase (bottom), in which case [d5]-DA-LP substrate with ω-labeled acyl chains
  (labels colored red) should be retained in the lys0-LP product. IM, inner membrane.
