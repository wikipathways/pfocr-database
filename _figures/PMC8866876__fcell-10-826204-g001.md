caption: Nrf2 associated pathways. Proteases degrade nrf2 ubiquitinated by the Keap1-CUL3
  complex under normal conditions in the cytoplasm. However, under oxidative stress
  conditions, Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1, accumulates in the cytoplasm, and is transported
  into the nucleus to bind to target genes. The selective autophagy substrate p62
  could compete with Nrf2 for Keap1 binding at the bottom of the DC domain, dislocating
  Nrf2 from Keap1 and leading to the accumulation of Nrf2, initiating the transcription
  of antioxidant protective genes and phase II detoxification enzyme genes. PKC phosphorylates
  Ser40 in Neh2, dissociating the Keap1 homodimer, and transporting Nrf2 into the
  nucleus to recognize and bind the ARE. Neh6 in Nrf2 can be phosphorylated by GSK-3β,
  leading to degradation through being recognized by β-TrCP. PI3K-AKT signaling could
  inhibit GSK-3β through phosphorylation. ARE, antioxidant responsive element; β-TrCP,
  β-transducin repeats-containing protein; GSK-3, phosphorylated by glycogen synthase
  kinase 3; Keap1, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; Nrf2, nuclear factor-erythroid
  2-related factor 2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; sMAF, small musculoaponeurotic
  fibrosarcoma oncogene homologue.
