caption: The relationship between Toll-like receptor (TLR)4, tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF), and IL-1. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) produced in response to signals traversing
  TLR4 (or other TLRs) stimulates the transcription of inflammatory cytokine genes,
  including TNF and IL-1. The cytokines that are produced, in turn, trigger receptors
  that also activate NF-κB, via Toll/IL-1/resistance (TIR) domain containing receptors
  (in the case of IL-1) or TNF-family receptors (in the case of TNF). Hence, there
  is the potential for an amplification loop, dampened by feedback inhibition of the
  TLR4 pathway (endotoxin tolerance). IL-1R, IL-1 receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  RIP, receptor interacting protein; TNFR, TNF receptor.
