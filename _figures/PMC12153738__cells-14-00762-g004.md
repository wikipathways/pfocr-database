caption: PGRN’s multifaceted roles in lysosomal function, autophagy, and metabolism
  impacting cardiovascular health. The figure is divided into two panels illustrating
  distinct but related functions of Progranulin (PGRN). The Left panel depicts PGRN’s
  influence on lysosomal function and autophagy. PGRN regulates essential lysosomal
  enzymes, like cathepsins and glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and influences bis(mono-acyl-glycero)phosphate
  (BMP) levels, all critical for maintaining lysosomal integrity and function. PGRN
  deficiency is shown to lead to the accumulation of autophagosomes, indicated by
  increased levels of p62 and LC3-II, and causes alterations in lysosomal-associated
  membrane protein (LAMP) dynamics, reflecting impaired lysosomal degradation and
  autophagic flux. The E6-AP mediated ubiquitin–proteasome pathway is also illustrated,
  modulating C/EBPα levels, which affects inflammatory responses. The Right panel
  focuses on PGRN’s impact on metabolic and cardiovascular processes. PGRN is shown
  to interact with CD36, a receptor involved in fat taste perception, suggesting a
  role in regulating feeding behavior. It associates with apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I),
  primarily within the context of HDL, influencing HDL metabolism. This association
  is described in the text as contributing to athero-protection by inhibiting the
  conversion of PGRN into pro-inflammatory granulins. While the figure connects this
  interaction to “atherosclerotic plaques”, the text clarifies that PGRN within plaques
  (expressed by SMCs, macrophages, and foam cells) exerts protective effects by suppressing
  inflammation, modulating cholesterol metabolism, and inhibiting plaque progression,
  rather than directly causing or stabilizing plaque structure. The PGRN-sirtuin1
  signaling pathway is depicted regulating FoxO1 activity, which is crucial for cardiovascular
  metabolism, aging, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, PGRN’s
  modulation of IL-6 production and the JAK-STAT pathway is shown to lead to SOCS3
  expression and subsequent insulin resistance. The panel also indicates PGRN’s influence
  on mitochondrial function, affecting ATP production and ROS levels. This dual depiction
  highlights PGRN’s essential contributions to maintaining cellular homeostasis, regulating
  metabolic processes, and supporting cardiovascular health through diverse mechanisms
