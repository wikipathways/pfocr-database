caption: The proposed mechanisms of the P4 immunomodulatory effects. (a) P4 induces
  PIBF and LIF production, which inhibit the Th1 pathway and reduce the production
  of proinflammatory cytokines; (b) P4 upregulates Th2 differentiation and anti-inflammatory
  cytokine synthesis, which downregulate Th1 differentiation; P4 decreases CD8+ T
  cytotoxicity and upregulates Tregs, which also decrease CD8+ T cytotoxicity; (c)
  by stimulation of the secreting amphiregulin, P4 activates proliferation and repair
  in the respiratory tract (RT). P4 decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines
  IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α by NK (natural killer) and dendritic cells, as well as decreases
  NO synthesis by macrophages. Red arrow—inhibition, green arrow—stimulation.
