caption: 'Regulation of peripheral tolerance by the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis
  pathways in T and B cells. Both apoptosis pathways cooperate to eliminate no longer
  functional or required activated T and B lymphocytes in peripheral lymphoid organs.
  Under non-inflammatory conditions T cells recognizing self-antigen presented by
  APCs undergo apoptosis after cross-presentation that is mediated by the intrinsic
  apoptosis pathway by induction of the BH3-only protein Bim. In contrast, when acute
  viral infections induce strong TCR signals or when they are becoming chronic the
  extrinsic pathway by Fas–FasL interaction (either in an autocrine or paracrine manner)
  is required for elimination of activated T cells. The intrinsic pathway contributes
  to the termination of both, acute as well as chronic immune response because of
  activation on cytokine-deprivation. During affinity maturation in germinal centers,
  the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway cooperate to select B lymphocytes expressing
  high-affinity BCRs. In B-cell clones that receive insufficient stimulation by their
  low-affinity BCR, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family members (e.g., Bcl-2, A1)
  drop. This response is accompanied by a reduced level of NF-κB activation leading
  to reduced FLIP-levels, in the absence of CD40 signals, making them more susceptible
  to Fas/FasL-induced apoptosis. In contrast, ligation of high-affinity BCRs increases
  the amount of pro-survival molecules of the Bcl-2 family, as well as NF-κB and FLIP,
  resulting in increased resistance to cell death. After elimination of the pathogen,
  a drop of survival factors or FcγRIIb ligation can activate BH3-only proteins such
  as Bim and maybe Puma and Bmf to secure clearance of plasma cells. This can be counteracted
  by cytokines such as BAFF that lead to up-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
  proteins like Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and A1. Abbreviations: APC, antigen presenting cell;
  BCR, B-cell receptor; BAFF, B-cell activating factor of the TNF family; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor ‘kappa-light-chain-enhancer'' of activated B cells; FLIP, FLICE-like inhibitory
  protein'
