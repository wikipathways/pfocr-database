caption: Models for the regulation of germline proliferation and meiotic entry. In
  each case, GLP-1 signaling is shown to repress three meiotic entry pathways. For
  simplicity, the targets of the third pathway are not shown. (A) Model 1. ATX-2 activity
  is repressed by GLD-1 and GLD-2. ATX-2 may positively regulate genes required for
  proliferation (Y) and/or negatively regulate genes required for meiosis (Z). (B)
  Model 2. ATX-2 acts in parallel with the GLD-1 and GLD-2 pathways to regulate common
  targets. For example, ATX-2 upregulates Y, a negative target of GLD-1, and represses
  Z, a positive target of GLD-2. Other possibilities exist. (C) Model 3. ATX-2 represses
  the third meiotic entry pathway. Components of the third pathway are not known,
  therefore we simply indicate it as lying downstream of NOS-3. Since ATX-2 can suppress
  gld-2 gld-1 double mutants, we have shown ATX-2 as interacting with the third pathway
  at a point downstream of NOS-3. See text.
