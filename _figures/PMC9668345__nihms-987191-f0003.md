caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that the proteins, which were DE in Sjogren’s
  Syndrome pSS vs HC for PS and WS samples, were networked with proteins that are
  involved in this disease and in psoriasis, another autoimmune condition. (1) Salivary
  DE proteins (red, up-regulated; blue down-regulated) identified in the iTRAQ analyses
  that are involved with psoriasis; (2) proteins associated with Sjögren’s Syndrome
  (purple outline); (3) direct (physical ± functional; solid lines) or indirect (functional;
  dashed lines) interactions; and (4) shapes outlining the protein names denote the
  family to which they belong (refer to  for shape definitions). The results suggested
  that many of the observed alterations were networked with pivotal immune and signaling
  pathway that also implicated in the disease etiology of psoriasis.
