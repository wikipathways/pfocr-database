caption: 'NMDAR -Ca2+-CREB signaling pathways in neuroprotection. NMDAR activity can
  activate CREB-dependent gene expression. CREB must be phosphorylated at serine-133
  in order to recruit its co-activator CREB binding protein (CBP). Phosphorylation
  of CREB is mediated by the fast-acting nuclear Ca2+/CaMK pathway and the slower
  acting, longer lasting Ras-ERK1/2 pathway, both of which are promoted by activation
  of synaptic NMDARs. (1) Nuclear Ca2+-CaM-CaMKIV/CaMKII-CREB: nuclear Ca2+-dependent
  CaMKIV/CaMKII phosphorylates CBP at serine-301. (2) ERK1/2-CREB: CBP is also phosphorylated
  by Ras-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway or CaMKII/PKC/PKA-ERK1/2 pathway. CREB phosphorylated
  at serine-133 recruits its CBP. In addition, nuclear translocation of TORC activity
  is a key step in CREB activation. (3) Ca2+-TORC-CREB: synaptic NMDAR-induced Ca2+
  signals promote TORC import into the nucleus by CaN-dependent dephosphorylation.
  TORC acts at least in part by assisting in the recruitment of CBP to CREB. (4) Ca2+-CRTC1-CREB:
  CRTC1 dephosphorylates at Ser-151 and is recruited from cytoplasm to the nucleus,
  where it competes with FXR for binding to CREB and drives autophagy gene expression.
  (5) Ca2+-TRPC6-CREB: Ca2+ influx through TRPC6 activates CREB, an important transcription
  factor linked to neuronal survival. (6) PI3K-AKT-GSK3β-CREB.'
