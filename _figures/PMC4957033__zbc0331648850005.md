caption: Top network of THC-regulated miRNAs. Mice were treated with SEB and vehicle
  or THC, and LN cells or CD4+ T cells were analyzed as described in the legend to
  . Ingenuity pathway analysis indicated that cell death and survival was the most
  overrepresented network by miRNAs whose precursors were differentially expressed
  in the vehicle and THC-treated lymphocytes. THC up-regulated miRNAs are shown in
  red and THC down-regulated miRNAs are shown in green.
