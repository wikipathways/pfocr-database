caption: The proposed model showing the different actions of ticagrelor in macrophages/monocytes
  and platelets. Ticagrelor controls NLRP3 inflammasome activation independent of
  the P2Y12 receptor, inhibiting ASC oligomerization by blocking chloride efflux to
  disrupt the formation of the inflammasome; this activity differs from the process
  of inhibiting platelet activation, in which ticagrelor binds to the P2Y12 receptor
  on platelets, inhibiting the intracellular signaling pathway
