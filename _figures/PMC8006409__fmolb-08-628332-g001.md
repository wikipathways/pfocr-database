caption: TRAIL signaling pathway. TRAIL binds to TRAIL-R1, R2, DcR1 and DcR2 receptors
  with a similarly high affinity. Death receptors TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 contain a
  conserved death domain (DD) motif and thus, binding of TRAIL transmits the apoptotic
  signal by causing a trimerization of the receptor and a formation of the death-inducing
  signaling complex (DISC). The recruitment of an adaptor molecule, FADD, is associated
  with the DISC formation and a subsequent binding and activation of caspases 8 and
  10. This process allows the activation of other effector caspases, including the
  executor caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7, triggering the final steps of apoptosis.
  TRAIL is known to trigger the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, while multiple other
  stimuli, such as chemotherapeutic agents or stimuli causing the DNA damage or ER
  stress, trigger the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway. Depending on the
  cellular context, both intracellular inhibitors, such as c-FLIP and Nf-kB, and extracellular
  inhibitors, such as TRAILshort and DcR1/2 can restrain the caspase activation and
  contribute to the resistance to TRAIL-induced cell death.
