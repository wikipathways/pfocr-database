caption: Asparaginase catalyzes asparagine and glutamine to aspartic acid and glutamic
  acid respectively, and the resulting amino acid deficiency concurrently induces
  caspase 3-dependent apoptosis and autophagy in K562 cells. Moreover, the Akt/mTOR
  and Erk signaling pathway are involved asparaginase-induced autophagy in K562 cells.
  Inhibition of autophagy by the autophagy inhibitors can significantly enhance asparaginase-induced
  growth inhibition and cell apoptosis in K562 CML cells.
