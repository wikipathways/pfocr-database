caption: Endometrial carcinoma (EC) cells strategically employ immune checkpoint pathways,
  with a notable focus on the programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1
  (PD-L1) axis. The intricate mechanism, as illustrated, involves the up-regulation
  of PD-L1 expression by cancer cells, allowing them to interact with PD-1 on T cells.
  This interaction leads to T cell exhaustion and anergy, effectively suppressing
  the anti-tumor immune response. Extensive studies have recognized the clinical relevance
  of these pathways and emphasized their significance in gynecological cancers. Unraveling
  these complex interactions provides crucial insights for developing immunotherapies
  tailored to combat EC effectively
