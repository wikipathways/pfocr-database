caption: Schematic diagram illustrating intracellular signaling pathways in a macrophage
  involved in cytokine regulation by adrenergic and cholinergic agonists and receptors
  following lipopolysaccharide challenge. Norepinephrine (NE) binds to adrenergic
  receptors (ARs) and induces cyclic AMP and protein Kinase A (PKA) activation which
  inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production by inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation.
  Acetylcholine (ACh) binds to the α7nACh receptor and inhibits phosphorylation and
  nuclear translocation of NF-κB. In addition, ACh activates the JAK2/STAT3 pathway
  leading to increased transactivation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and decreased
  transcription of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and proinflammatory cytokines.
