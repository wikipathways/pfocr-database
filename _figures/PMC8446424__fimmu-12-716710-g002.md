caption: The diagrammatic view of TREM2 signaling pathway. Once TREM2 binding to one
  of its ligands such as bacterial products, DNA, LDL, Apo E and Aβ, the TREM2 signaling
  pathway was propagated through the interaction of TREM2 and DAP12/DAP10 via oppositely
  charged residues, thus resulting in the tyrosine phosphorylation of DAP12/DAP10
  within its ITAMs by Src tyrosine kinases, then SYK was recruited and phosphorylated
  by the ITAM regions to activate some downstream signaling molecules such as PI3K,
  Akt, mTOR, p38 MAPKs, ERK, JNK and β-catenin.
