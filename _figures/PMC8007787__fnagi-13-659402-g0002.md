caption: Neuroprotective processes influenced by hydrogen sulfide (H2S). H2S mediates
  neuroprotection by modulating multiple pathways, including maintenance of mitochondrial
  function and redox balance in the brain. At physiological concentrations, H2S facilitates
  long-term potentiation (LTP) in a manner dependent on the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)
  receptors. H2S inhibits the expression and activity of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1)
  and thus inhibits amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)
  to prevent the accumulation of β-amyloid plaques. H2S also mediates persulfidation/sulfhydration
  of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and inhibits activity, preventing hyperphosphorylation
  of Tau which would prevent its aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).
