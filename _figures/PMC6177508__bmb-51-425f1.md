caption: Schematic model for phosphorylation-dependent YAP translocation by DVL. When
  the Hippo pathway is activated, Lats1/2-phosphorylated YAP leads to inhibition of
  the nuclear transcriptional activity through cytoplasmic translocation. The phosphorylated
  YAP is exported by DVL into cytoplasmic space. Note that p53 and LKB1/AMPK tumor
  suppressors maintain Lats1/2 activities which are responsible for YAP trafficking
  controlled by the contact inhibition from tight/adherens junctions or metabolic
  regulation.
