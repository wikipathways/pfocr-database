caption: 'hCG signaling and effects on leiomyomal cells. In human myometrial smooth
  muscle and leiomyomas cells, hCG: (I) activates the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway causing
  changes in the expression of several target genes mediated by related transcription
  factors such as CREB; (II) promotes cell cycle, increasing expressions of key proteins
  like PCNA, cyclin E and cdc2; and (III) promotes production of prolactin that, directly
  and through autocrine/paracrine effect, increases cell proliferation. The signaling
  pathways regulating cell cycle progression genes in leiomyomal cells have not been
  clarified yet. hCG: human Chorionic Gonadotropin; LH: luteinizing hormone; LH/hCG
  rec: LH/hCG receptor; AC: Adenylate cyclase; PKA: protein kinase A; CREB: cAMP Responsive
  Element Binding Protein; CRE: cAMP Responsive Element; PCNA: Proliferating cell
  nuclear antigen; CDK1: cyclin-dependent kinase 1; PRL: Prolactin; PRL-R: Prolactin
  Receptor; the red arrows represent increased expression.'
