caption: Construction of the auxin signalling regulatory network. DES and their target
  genes were used for direct interaction analysis by Pathway Studio 9.0. Upregulated,
  downregulated and unchanged sRNAs and targets in hybrid rice were represented with
  red, green and purple, respectively. TAS3, trans-acting siRNA 3; ARF2, auxin response
  factor 2; ARF3, auxin response factor 3; ARF6, auxin response factor 6; ARF8, auxin
  response factor 8; NAC1, NAM/ATAF/CUC 1; PHV, PHAVOLUTA; REV, REVOLUTA.
