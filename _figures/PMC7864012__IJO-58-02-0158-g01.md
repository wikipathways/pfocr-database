caption: Overview of one-carbon metabolism around the folate cycle, methionine cycle
  and trans-sulfuration pathway. The folate cycle provides one carbon for the methionine
  cycle, as well as homocysteine, an intermediate product of the methionine cycle,
  which can be converted into GSH through the trans-sulfuration pathway. Yellow ovals
  represent metabolic enzymes. 3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; BHMT, betaine homocysteine
  methyltransferase; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; CTH, cystathionase; DHFR, dihydrofolate
  reductase; DMG, dimethylglycine; F-THF, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate; GLDC, glycine
  dehydrogenase; GSH, glutathione; HMT, histone methyl transferase; MAT, methionine
  adenosyltransferase; me-THF, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate; mTHF, 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate;
  MTHFD, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase; MTR, methionine synthase; SAH, S-adenosyl homocysteine; SAHH, SAH hydrolase;
  SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; SSP, serine synthesis
  pathway; THF, tetrahydrofolate.
