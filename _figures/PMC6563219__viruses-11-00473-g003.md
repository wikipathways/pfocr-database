caption: Pathway visualization using downregulated differentially-expressed unigenes
  in Axon guidance, Regulation of actin cytoskeleton and Adherens junction. Transcripts
  from enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms from the downregulated unigene set were mapped
  on to KEGG Axon guidance pathway (A), Regulation of actin cytoskeleton (B) and Adherens
  junction (C) pathways and visualized manually. Boxes in color represent protein
  coding genes that were present within the enriched GO terms. The gradient of the
  color represents their fold change. Grey boxes represent protein coding genes not
  present in the enriched GO terms. Dotted lines represent individual modules within
  the parent pathway. Pathway components present on double grey lines represent cell
  membrane receptors. Log2FC differences between the two conditions can be referenced
  in .

  description: Pathway visualization using downregulated differentially-expressed
    unigenes in Axon guidance, Regulation of actin cytoskeleton and Adherens junction.
    Transcripts from enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms from the downregulated unigene
    set were mapped on to KEGG Axon guidance pathway (A), Regulation of actin cytoskeleton
    (B) and Adherens junction (C) pathways and visualized manually. Boxes in color
    represent protein coding genes that were present within the enriched GO terms.
    The gradient of the color represents their fold change. Grey boxes represent protein
    coding genes not present in the enriched GO terms. Dotted lines represent individual
    modules within the parent pathway. Pathway components present on double grey lines
    represent cell membrane receptors. Log2FC differences between the two conditions
    can be referenced in .
