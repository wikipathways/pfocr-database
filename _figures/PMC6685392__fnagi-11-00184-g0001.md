caption: 'Dysfunctions in canonical Wnt-Signaling contribute to the neuropathology
  of Alzheimer disease (AD). (A) Functional Wnt and Nonamyloidogenic Processing—Glycogen
  Synthase Kinase 3β (GSK3β) is a constitutively active kinase that phosphorylates
  and targets β-catenin for proteasomal degradation. The binding of Wnt ligands to
  LDL Receptor-Related Protein 6 (LRP6) and Frizzled induces the receptor pair to
  bind Dishevelled (DVL), a protein that serves as a docking platform for GSK3β. The
  sequestration of GSK3β by the Wnt receptor complex permits β-catenin to accumulate
  and translocate into the nucleus, where it binds transcription factors to induce
  gene expression. This includes promoting anti-amyloidogenic α-secretase expression
  (blue mRNA) and inhibiting pro-amyloidogenic β-secretase expression. (B) Dysfunctional
  Wnt, Amyloidogenic Processing, and Tau Hyperphosphorylation—The LRP6 antagonist,
  Dickkopf 1 (DKK1), prevents Wnt-induced GSK3β inhibition (broken red line). Thus,
  (i) GSK3β causes β-catenin depletion, contributing to a decrease in α-secretase
  expression and increase in β-secretase expression (red mRNA). In addition, (ii)
  GSK3β phosphorylates the intracellular domain of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP),
  making APP a better substrate for β-secretase and further promoting amyloidogenic
  processing and the production of Amyloid β (Aβ) by β- and γ-secretase. Aβ inhibits
  Frizzled and induces DKK1 expression to feedback and prevent GSK3β inhibition (broken
  red line). Aβ also forms extracellular plaques. The leftover phosphorylated APP
  Intracellular Domain (p-AICD) induces GSK3β expression. Finally, (iii) GSK3β, also
  known as Tau Kinase I, phosphorylates tau, contributing to microtubule instability
  and to the formation of neurotoxic oligomers and phospho-tau (p-tau) Neurofibrillary
  Tangles (NFTs). (C) Human Neuropathological and Genetic Data are Consistent with
  the Wnt/GSK3β Model of AD—In the Alzheimer brain, as compared to the healthy aged
  brain, the levels and activities of Wnt-signaling components are indicative of pathway
  hypoactivity: DKK1 levels are elevated, LRP6 levels are reduced, GSK3β activity
  is high, and β-catenin is depleted. Furthermore, LRP6 loss-of-function and GSK3β
  gain-of-function alleles are risk factors for AD.'
