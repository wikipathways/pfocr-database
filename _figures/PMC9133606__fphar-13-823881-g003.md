caption: The regulatory mechanism of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant and cytoprotective
  actions against photoaging, inflammation and hyperpigmentation. Phytochemicals play
  a photoprotective role against skin photodamage directly via scavenging reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and indirectly via activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling, leading to upregulation of antioxidant and cytoprotective
  genes. In response to ultraviolet ray (UVR)-induced oxidative stress, ROS, produced
  in keratinocytes, melanocytes and fibroblasts, can modulate several related signaling
  pathways involved in photoaging, inflammation and melanogenesis. Exposure of human
  skin to UVR causes cells to produce ROS, which can modulate the signaling pathways
  involved in upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which includes MMP-1/3/9,
  leading to collagen degradation, inflammation (nuclear factor kappa B also known
  as NF-κB and its downstream signaling) and the upregulation of melanogenesis-related
  genes including the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase
  (TYR), and tyrosinase related proteins (TRP-1). Dietary phytochemicals as natural
  sources of antioxidants play the protective roles against UVR-induced ROS by the
  inhibition of ROS formation and the activation of Nrf2 signaling. In response to
  oxidative insults, Nrf2 is activated by the phosphorylation and disassociation of
  Nrf2 from Kelch-ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1), a repressor protein in the cytoplasm.
  Then, Nrf2 translocated to the nucleus binds to the ARE in the promoter region of
  downstream genes encoding antioxidant and phase II detoxifying enzymes including
  glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), glutathione S-transferase (GST), NAD(P)H quinone
  oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). The activation of Nrf2 improves
  oxidative status of the cells and promotes cytoprotection against skin oxidative
  damage and inflammation. The black/red arrows and bar-headed lines mean activation
  and inhibition of the pathway, respectively. The dash arrow means dissociation of
  the Keap1–Nrf2 complex.
