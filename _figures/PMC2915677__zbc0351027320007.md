caption: Crc-mediated regulation of the TOL pathway genes. A, the structural genes
  (in gray), the regulatory genes xylS and xylR (in white), and the Pu, Pm, PS1, PS2,
  PR1, and PR2 promoters of the TOL pathway are shown at the top of the figure. Black
  arrowheads indicate the direction of transcription. The mRNAs corresponding to the
  upper and meta operons and to the xylS and xylR genes are indicated by dotted arrows.
  The Crc binding sites at these mRNAs are indicated by filled arrowheads (strong
  sites) or open arrowheads (weak sites). The open triangles over promoters Pu, Pm,
  and PS1 indicate the indirect repressing effect of Crc on these promoters, derived
  from the direct effect of Crc on translation of the XylR activator. B, proteins
  involved in toluene uptake and assimilation. Proteins or genes directly regulated
  by Crc are shown in boldface, whereas those not directly affected by Crc are indicated
  in Roman text. XO, xylene monooxygenase; TO, toluate/benzoate dioxygenase; DHCDH,
  dihydroxycyclohexadiene carboxylate dehydrogenase; AZDH, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase;
  CW, cell wall.
