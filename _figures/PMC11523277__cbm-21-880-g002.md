caption: 'Ubiquitin-mediated regulation of key signaling pathways in tumor cells.
  Ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases have pivotal roles in modulating the activation
  or inhibition of TGF-β, NF-κβ, WNT, PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, and P53 signaling pathways
  in tumor cells. These pathways, in turn, influence the malignant behavior of tumors.
  Notably, the activation of some signaling pathways can also lead to the activation
  of downstream ubiquitin ligases, further impacting tumor progression. TGF-β: deubiquitinases
  ubiquitin-specific protease 16 (USP16), USP33, USP8, USP19, and the makorin ring
  finger protein 1 (MKRN1) activate the TGF-β signaling pathway. The activation of
  TGF-β further activates ring finger protein 12 (RNF12). These events collectively
  contribute to the malignant behavior of tumors. Conversely, USP2 inhibits TGF-β
  signaling, suppressing tumor growth. NF-κβ: USP10 and cullin-3/ speckle-type POZ
  protein (CUL3/SPOP) activate the NF-κβ signaling pathway, promoting tumor formation.
  NF-κβ activation also upregulates CUL4B, further driving tumor growth. WNT: USP7,
  USP5, and zinc and ring finger 3 (ZNRF3), tripartite motif containing 26 (TRIM26)
  activate the WNT pathway, promoting tumorigenesis. Conversely, USP10 and recombinant
  F-box and WD repeat domain containing protein 7 (FBXW7) inhibit tumorigenesis by
  suppressing the WNT pathway. PI3K/AKT: RNF43 and USP3 activate the PI3K/AKT pathway,
  promoting tumorigenesis. Conversely, CUL2 and USP10 inhibit PI3K/AKT, suppressing
  tumorigenesis. Activated PI3K/AKT can further activate ubiquitin ligase Itch, contributing
  to tumorigenesis. JAK/STAT: RNF7, TRIM66, and HERC5 activate the JAK/STAT pathway,
  promoting tumorigenesis. USP17 and USP4 inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway, suppressing
  tumorigenesis. p53: TRIM21 activates the p53 pathway, while growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible
  gene 34 (GADD34) competitively binds to mousedouble minute 2 (MDM2) to promote p53
  expression. These events collectively inhibit tumorigenesis. TRIM37 and ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzyme E2T (UBE2T) inhibit p53 expression, while myeloid leukemia factor 2 (MLF2)
  inhibits the binding of USP7 to p53, further promoting tumorigenesis. Additionally,
  p53 interacts with MDM2, which in turn promotes the expression of OVO-like zinc
  finger 2 (OVOL2) and inhibits tumorigenesis'
