caption: The activation of the canonical Wnt pathway in head and neck cancers is mediated
  by various factors. The synthesis of Wnt ligands is enhanced, which is related to
  the elevated activity of enzymes responsible for post-translational modifications—glycosylation
  and palmitoylation. The increased activity of Wnt ligands results from the reduced
  expression of extracellular Wnt antagonists. After secretion, Wnt ligands activate
  FZD/LRP receptors, which destabilizes the destruction complex, which can no longer
  phosphorylate β-catenin and stimulate its degradation. The destabilization of the
  destruction complex may also be mediated by the activation/overexpression of other
  molecular factors (e.g., EGFR, PI3K, c-MET, CIP2A), including HPV infection (details
  provided in the text). The resulting translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus activates
  TCF/LEF-mediated transcription of WRE-regulated genes, which relies on the cooperation
  with histone modifying proteins (MLL, CBP).
