caption: (a) Schematic presentation of the Nrf-2/ARE pathway. In response to oxidative
  stress ROS causes nuclear translocation of Nrf-2, which then forms a heterodimer
  with a small Maf protein. This complex then interacts with the ARE element and induces
  transcription of its target antioxidant genes. (b) Schematic presentation of the
  HIF-1/HRE pathway. Under normoxia HIF-1α is rapidly degraded in the cytosol. In
  response to hypoxia HIF-1α becomes stabilized, translocates to the nucleus where
  it dimerizes with HIF-1β and then binds to the HRE element and induces transcription
  of its target genes.
