caption: Hypothetical choreography of antigen-dependent ATLO B-cell response pathways.
  Advanced ATLOs are powerhouses of B-cell immunity. ATLO B-cell responses are two-pronged
  in nature containing a comprehensive B-1 and a multi-faceted B-2 maturation pathway.
  Although similarities of B-cell immunity in ATLOs and SLOs are apparent, differences
  include a large PC component and a distinct B-1 B cell compartment which differs
  from that in the peritoneal cavity. This schematic figure has been modified from
  Srikakulapu et al. () [see Ref. () for detailed data].
