caption: ISO stimulates both β1-ARs and β2-ARs via Gs-adenylate cyclase (AC)/cAMP
  signalling to increase ICa,l. In addition, ISO or ZIN act via β2-ARs and Gi-/PI-3K/Akt
  signalling to activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and NO release ().
  NO acts via guanylate cyclase (GC)/cGMP-inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE) III
  to raise endogenous cAMP and stimulate ICa,l. ACh acts via muscarinic receptors
  coupled to Gi-protein to inhibit AC activated by β1-AR/Gs-signalling. However, ACh
  is unable to effectively inhibit β2-AR/Gi-NO signalling. In addition, NO released
  by β2-AR stimulation acts locally via S-nitrosylation to decrease β2-AR/Gs-/AC signalling.
  As a result, β2-AR signalling is due primarily to Gi-NO signalling, which is not
  effectively inhibited by ACh. Not shown in this diagram is the effect of FEN. Although
  FEN acts via β2-ARs, it preferentially stimulates only the Gs-/AC signalling pathway
  and therefore does not release NO. As a result, β2-AR/Gs-/AC signalling is not depressed
  and therefore ACh-induced inhibition of ICa,l stimulated by FEN is prominent, similar
  to that obtained with stimulation of ICa,l via β1-ARs.
