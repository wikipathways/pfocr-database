caption: Metabolic profiling is an indicative of cell biological processes. ROS are
  a main stimulus for monocyte-to-endothelial-cell differentiation and endothelial
  cell proliferation. In this differentiation process, monocytes present increased
  glycolysis and amino acid metabolism with decreased pyruvate metabolism and fatty
  acid recycling. The ROS-dependent activation of proliferation is accompanied by
  a glucose-recycling metabolic adjustment, which will favor glucose-dependent pathways
  as the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and purine and pyrimidine syntheses. Cysteine
  inhibits monocyte-to-endothelial-cell differentiation and endothelial cell proliferation,
  with a concomitant upregulation of glutathione metabolism, and activates the glycine
  shuttle from one-carbon metabolism into the PPP/phosphoribosyl diphosphate pathway
  (PRPP) and fatty acid synthesis. Propranolol inhibits endothelial cell proliferation
  [], and this accounts for a decrease in metabolic efforts, since a reversion of
  the metabolic pathways enhanced upon the stimulation of cell proliferation resembles
  a metabolic impairment consistent with cell quiescence. ↓—decrease; ↑—increase.
