caption: Putative model of the functions of HSPGs in CRC cells. The cell surface HSPG
  syndecan-2 (Syn-2) is upregulated and promotes cancer cell adhesion, proliferation,
  migration, and metastasis. Syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 (Syn-1; Syn-4), generally antitumor
  molecules, are reduced in colon carcinoma cells. The cell surface HSPG glypican-1
  (Gly-1) is increased in CRC and is involved in tumor progression. The augmentation
  of matrix HSPG perlecan favors angiogenesis and tumor growth. The SULF enzymes are
  upregulated, and the edition of HS chains promotes proliferation and invasion of
  CRC cells. In addition, SULFs release growth factors that were bound to HS, stimulating
  the Wnt signaling pathway and the activation of β-catenin.
