caption: 'Schematic diagram of the hypothetical molecular signaling pathways of the
  expression of p27 by which moderate increase in the concentration of D-(+)-glucose
  down-regulates and deficiency of D-(+)-glucose or L-leucine up-regulates the expression
  of p27. This summary diagram shows the outline of how 4-hydroxytamoxifen uses primarily
  pathway #1 to up-regulate the expression of p27, arrest the G1-to-S phase transition
  of cell cycle, and inhibit DNA replication in human breast cancer cells in vitro.
  4-Hydroxytamoxifen preferentially phosphorylates 4E-BP1 over S6K1. The diagram also
  shows the outline of how the deficiency of D-(+)-glucose uses primarily pathway
  #2 to up-regulate the expression of p27, arrest the G1-to-S phase transition of
  cell cycle, and inhibit DNA replication in human breast cancer cells in vitro. D-(+)-Glucose
  deficiency preferentially phosphorylates S6K1 over 4E-BP1. The diagram also shows
  that the deficiency of L-leucine enters the pathway #2 at points different from
  the deficiency of D-(+)-glucose. Finally, the diagram shows that deficiency of D-(+)-glucose
  or L-leucine uses L-upstream molecular signaling pathway #2 of the expression of
  p27 to up-regulate the phosphorylation of AMPK and the expression of mitochondrial
  ATP5A and SIRT3. The mitochondrial SIRT3 exerts anti-aging and other metabolic effects
  on the cells.'
