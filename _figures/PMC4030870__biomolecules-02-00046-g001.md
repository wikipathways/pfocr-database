caption: Complement activation pathways and the regulatory role of factor H.Complement
  activation is initiated by the recognition molecules of the classical (C1q) and
  lectin (MBL, ficolins) pathways or by the hydrolysis of the C3 thioester bond (alternative
  pathway). All three activation cascades lead to the assembly of C3 convertase enzymes
  that cleave the central C3 molecule into C3a and C3b. C3b deposits to nearby surfaces
  and, if not inactivated, it forms additional C3 convertases (amplification loop).
  The binding of C3b to an existing C3 convertase results in a C5 convertase that
  cleaves C5 into C5a, a potent anaphylatoxin, and C5b. C5b binds to surfaces and
  by binding C6, C7, C8 and several C9 molecules a terminal membrane attack complex
  is formed that allows target cell lysis. The system is controlled by several fluid
  phase and membrane-bound regulators that act at various steps of the activation
  cascade. Factor H is the major fluid-phase regulator of the alternative pathway,
  as it prevents the formation of the C3 and C5 convertases, facilitates the disassembly
  of already formed convertases and acts as a cofactor for the inactivation (enzymatic
  cleavage) of C3b.
