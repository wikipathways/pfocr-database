caption: 'Nutrient sensing machinery in K- and L-cells. As in other endocrine cells,
  secretion is triggered by an elevation in cytosolic Ca2+, which promotes fusion
  of hormone containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. This can be achieved in
  different ways: (i) Uptake: (left) Electroneutral uptake of nutrients increases
  metabolic flux and elevates cytosolic ATP-levels. These close ATP-sensitive potassium
  channels (KATP), permitting depolarization of the plasma membrane and opening of
  voltage gated sodium and calcium channels (), leading to an elevation in cytosolic
  Ca2+. (right) Electrogenic transport of nutrients directly depolarizes the plasma
  membrane and triggers all the subsequent steps. (ii) Alternatively nutrients might
  trigger hormone release without ever entering the cell by interaction with surface
  sensors. Examples for this type of detection involve activation of ligand gated
  ion channels (hence electrogenic (left) and feeding into the same triggering pathway
  as the depolarizing transport mechanisms) or (right) electroneutral activation of
  second messenger cascades. Examples of transporters/receptors identified in incretin-secreting
  cells are given for each of these mechanisms, with the colours corresponding to
  the macronutrients detected (see text for details).'
