caption: Biosynthesis and metabolic engineering of squalene production in E. coli.
  Squalene biosynthesis proceeds through a multi-step metabolic pathway beginning
  with acetyl-CoA, which is derived from various carbon sources via glycolysis. The
  MVA pathway subsequently converts acetyl-CoA to isoprenoid precursors, followed
  by condensation reactions catalyzed sequentially by IspA and SQS to yield squalene.
  To enhance production efficiency, strategic modifications to the pentose phosphate
  pathway were implemented to optimize NADPH regeneration and maintain cellular redox
  homeostasis. Additionally, a systematic investigation of lipid metabolism genes
  was conducted to expand intracellular squalene storage capacity
