caption: Dynamics of phosphosites in the ErbB pathway (between pre- and post-treatment
  the HER2-positive gastric cancer groups). Proteins in the ErbB signaling pathway
  are selected from the KEGG database. Proteins with quantified phosphosites are shown
  as white boxes with solid lines. Proteins without quantified phosphosites are shown
  as grey boxes with dotted lines. Differentially expressed phosphosites with a tendency
  (log2 |FC| > 1 and and 0.05 ≤ p < 0.1) are depicted by a green line.
