caption: 'A: TLR3 exclusively employs TRIF to recruit RIP1 in order to activate TAK1-driven
  activation of NF-κB and to trigger activation of TBK1/IKKe kinases to phosphorylate
  and activate IRF3 and IRF7, leading to the induction of type I IFNs. TRAF6 promotes
  K63-linked polyubiquitination of IRF7, facilitating its activation and nuclear translocation.
  TBK1/IKK-ε pathway up-regulates expression of Pellino-3, leading to Plelino-3-mediated
  polyubiquitination of TRAF6, which blocks TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination and activation
  of IRF7 and impaired induction of type I IFNs. B: Upon microbial infection of the
  gut, bacterial-derived MDP, a component of peptidoglycan, is recognized by NOD2,
  resulting in receptor oligomerization and signal transduction. The signaling cascade
  involves recruitment of RIP-2 to NOD2, RIP2-Pellino-3 association and Pellino-3-mediated
  K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP2, promoting recognition of polyUb moieties
  via Ub recognition domains of TAB1/TAB2 associated with TAK1 and by NEMO (IKKγ)
  associated with IKKα/IKKβ, facilitating their recruitment and activation. TAK1 subsequently
  activates MAPKs, AP1 and NF-κB to drive expression of cytokines, chemokines and
  antimicrobial peptides.'
