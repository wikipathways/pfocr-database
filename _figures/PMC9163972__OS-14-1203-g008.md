caption: Detailed illustration of the experiment. (A) BMMs were collected from women
  and analyzed using RNA‐seq to examine the expression of CCL2 and CCL7. (B) CCL2
  and CCL7 protein and mRNA levels were examined in aged and young mice, and OVX mice
  were treated with E2 and Bnd to examine their effects on bone loss and bone turnover.
  (C) BMMs and osteoblasts were extracted from mice and treated with Bnd during differentiation.
