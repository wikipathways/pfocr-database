caption: A. Venn diagram illustrates the number of genes (in brackets) regulated by
  pioglitazone in control PBMCs (black left circle) and in lupus PBMCs (red right
  circle), as well as their directionality (bar graphs). In the overlap of both, the
  Venn diagram shows in the middle the number of genes modified by pioglitazone in
  control as well as in lupus PBMCs, and on each side the number of genes modified
  by pioglitazone only in control PBMCs (left) or only in lupus PBMCs (right). In
  the genes modified by pioglitazone in control and lupus PBMCs, 9 genes were not
  regulated in the same direction (down-regulated in control PBMCs, but up-regulated
  in lupus PBMCs or vice-versa). B. T-cell receptor signaling pathway in SLE PBMCs
  is modulated by pioglitazone, as assessed by Ingenuity Pathway Systems. Genes highlighted
  in green are significantly transcriptionally repressed in the pioglitazone-treated
  PBMCs, while genes highlighted in red are upregulated by the drug. C. Resulting
  transcriptional network analysis displays IFN- γ as an important regulatory node
  in pioglitazone-treated lupus PBMCs. T-cell related genes are in red characters.
  The figure displays the transcriptional network (Genomatix Pathway System) obtained
  from the genes that were co-cited in PubMed abstracts in the same sentence linked
  to a function word (128 of 372 genes regulated with a q-value<0.05 and fold-change
  ≥ 1.5 for the up-regulated genes and ≤ 0.7 for the down-regulated genes).
