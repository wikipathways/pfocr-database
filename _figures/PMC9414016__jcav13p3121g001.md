caption: 'Pathways associated with fucose metabolism. A. The de nova pathway is the
  one of fucosylation pathway. GDP-mannose is converted to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose
  by GMD(s). Then, under the catalyzation of Fx protein, it converted to GDP-L-fucose,
  followed by transfer to Golgi apparatus by GFT. In Golgi apparatus, the substrates
  including polysaccharide and protein are linked to GDP-L-fucose with the participation
  of FUT to form a fucosylated substrate, which is further transported to cell membrane
  , . B. The salvage pathway utilizes fucose transported into the cytosol from an
  extracellular origin or released by catabolism of fucosylated glycans in lysosome,
  and then transported into the cytosol. Fucose is transported across the plasma membrane
  through a poorly characterized mechanism, L-fucose-specific facilitated diffusion
  . The salvage pathway is enabled by FUK and GFPP, with L-fucose-1-phosphate as the
  metabolic intermediate, and the following steps are the same as the de novo synthesis
  pathway. C. The defucosylation pathway is a defucosylation process mediated by AFU
  in lysosome. GMD(s): GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase. Fx: Fx protein. GFT: GDP-L-fucose
