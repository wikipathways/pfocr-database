caption: The mechanism of CDK5 activation. The expression of p35 can be transcriptionally
  regulated by upstream regulators N-Myc, Menin, EGR1 and miR-505. Myristoylation
  on Gly2 of p35 determines its affinity to cell membrane, which signals for proteasomal
  degradation. Activated CDK5 phosphorylates p35 on Ser8 to sustain its cytoplasmic
  localization. When the cell faces with the death signal, the N-methyl-D-aspartate
  (NMDA) receptor on the cell membrane can be activated, enhancing the uptake of calcium
  for calpain activation. Calpain has proteolytic activity to cleave p35 into p25
  fragment, a more stable protein than p35. This cleavage leads to the translocation
  of CDK5/p25 complex into the nucleus and prolongs the activation time of CDK5, which
  induces the pathological signal pathway of cell death
