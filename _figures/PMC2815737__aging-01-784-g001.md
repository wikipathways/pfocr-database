caption: The proposed hypothesis states that (a) the increased level of mitochondrial                                         generated
  ROS in aged tissues/cells results in a locked-in cycle of ROS production                                         and
  the amplification of oxidative stress signaling (p38 MAPK/SAPK-JNK).                                          The
  chronic increase of endogenous levels of ROS stabilizes the increased                                         basal,
  intrinsic changes in activity of regulators of the stress response                                         which
  is the basis for the development of a state-of-chronic-stress and                                         progressive
  decline in tissue function.  (b) Longevity and resistance to                                         oxidative
  stress is associated with the elevated levels of the (SH)2Trx-ASK1                                         complex
  which attenuates the activity of stress response signaling  pathways                                         (p38
  MAPK/SAPK-JNK).  The levels of the (SH)2Trx-ASK1 complex decrease                                         as
  the levels of endogenous ROS increase in aging tissues.  In long-lived                                         mouse
  models the levels of the complex are elevated and part of the                                         resistance
  to oxidative stress.
