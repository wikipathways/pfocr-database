caption: (A) Base damage (red flag) is recognised by one of 11 damage-specific DNA
  glycosylases that are monofunctional (removes base creating an AP site); bifunctional
  (removes base and cleaves phosphodiester backbone 3′ to the lesion) or Nei-like
  (cleaves phosphodiester bond either side of lesion). APE1 incises the AP site, or
  removes the 3′-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde remaining from bifunctional DNA glycosylase
  action. PNKP is required to remove 3′-phosphate termini following Nei-like DNA base
  excision. At this stage, PARP1 recognises SSB/gap intermediates protecting these
  from degradation, and facilitates repair through protein recruitment. Polβ through
  its lyase activity excises the 5′-dRP moiety, and simultaneously fills the one nucleotide
  gap (green nucleotide). XRCC1-LigIIIα complex interacts with Polβ and repairs the
  remaining nick in the DNA, thus completing SP-BER. (B) When the 5′-DNA end is not
  amenable to Polβ, LP-BER is employed. A polymerase switch to Polδ/ε stimulates strand
  displacement and creates a 2–8 nucleotide 5′-flap. FEN1 cleaves the flap and LigI
  ligates the subsequent nick, both of which are stimulated by the PCNA clamp slider.
  Each enzymatic step of the pathway can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors,
  as indicated by the red cross.
