caption: Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), activated by growth factors (GFs) signal
  through several pathways to drive changes in the transcription of specific RNAs.
  Adapters (yellow), kinases (green) and other signaling proteins (gray) bind to phosphorylated
  tyrosines (encircled P letters) on the activated RTK, and then stimulate particular
  downstream pathways. For instance, upon binding to phosphotyrosine, phospholipase
  C, PLC, is activated to cleave the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate,
  PIP2, into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, IP3, and diacylglycerol, DAG. Pathway activation
  culminates in changes in transcription factor (TF) activity, leading to changes
  in RNA expression. The extent of activation of each of these pathways will vary
  depending on the identity of the RTK. Also shown is the negative regulator CBL,
  which binds to phosphorylated tyrosines and ubiquitinates the RTK driving its internalization.
  Other RTK specific negative regulators such as MIG6 are not shown.
