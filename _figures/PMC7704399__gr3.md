caption: 'Schematic mechanism of hypomagnesemia-mediated overproduction of methylglyoxal
  leading to neurotoxicity. Hyperglycemia results in an increased glucose influx,
  which is metabolized in mitochondria (Krebs cycle) or alternatively through the
  PPP. Several enzymes involved in glucose metabolism require magnesium for catabolic
  activity (marked purple). Hypomagnesemia (Mg2+↓) leads to reduced glucose metabolism
  in mitochondria and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), increased levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  (GA3P), and consequently dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). This results in increased
  formation of methylglyoxal from DHAP by methylglyoxal synthase (irreversible reaction).
  The accumulation of methylglyoxal leads to an increased level of detrimental methylglyoxal-mediated
  protein/DNA modifications and neurotoxicity. Abbreviations: CEL, N(epsilon)-(1-carboxyethyl)lysine;
  GLO1, glyoxalase 1; GLO2, glyoxalase 2; GLUT, glucose transporter; KGDH, α-ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase; MG-H1, methylglyoxal 5-hydro-5-methylimidazolone; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  PK, pyruvate kinase; TK, transketolase.'
