caption: 'LKB1 loss alters cancer cell biology. LBK1 loss and consequent lack of AMPK
  activation lead to mTORC1 assembly, resulting in autophagy inhibition. High metabolic
  requirements imposed by sustained proliferation are met through aerobic glycolysis
  (i.e., Warburg effect), driven by HIF-1α stabilization, which provides cancer cells
  with ATP and intermediates for anabolic reactions (not shown). Pyruvate is preferentially
  converted to lactate, which is excreted in the tumor microenvironment. Activation
  of ACC1 and ACC2 promotes fatty acid synthesis in the cytosol, by using citrate
  coming from mitochondria. NOX1 expression drives the assembly of NADPH oxidase complex,
  which produces ROS in the microenvironment. NOX-produced ROS enter the cell, thus
  inducing oxidative stress and activating NRF2 through the oxidation of KEAP1. Reduced
  expression of MFN1 and OPA1 and increased activity of DRP1, induced by HIF-1α activation,
  lead to mitochondrial fragmentation. Increased ROS levels and mitochondrial fission
  promote the secretion of proangiogenic factors in the microenvironment. Yellow circles:
  phosphate groups. Red phospholipids in membranes: peroxidised phospholipids. Red
  stars in the nucleus: DNA damage sites. G6P: glucose 6-phosphate; F6P: fructose
  6-phosphate; F1,6BP: fructose 1,6-biphosphate; G3P: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
