caption: CD95-mediated cell migration occurs through a Bcl-2/BclxL/VDAC1/MCU-driven
  mitochondrial calcium loading. Death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and motility-inducing
  signaling complex (MISC) are formed through protein–protein interaction. For the
  CD95-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway, type II cells (e.g., hepatocytes) rely
  on the release of apoptotic factors (i.e., cytochrome c, smac/Diablo, Omi/Hrt2A)
  by the mitochondria to implement the apoptotic cue while Type I (e.g., T lymphocytes)
  does not. The CD95-mediated calcium response is initiated by PLCγ1 activation leading
  to release of the ER-stored Ca2+ in the cytosol (1), followed by a store-operated
  calcium entry (SOCE) through activation of the Ca2+ channel Orai1 (2). This study
  shows the pivotal role played by the calcium transfer from ER to mitochondria (3)
  in TNBC cell migration induced by cl-CD95L
papertitle: The apoptotic members CD95, BclxL, and Bcl-2 cooperate to promote cell
  migration by inducing Ca2+ flux from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria.
