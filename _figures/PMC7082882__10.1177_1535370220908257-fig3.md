caption: How PHB1 exerts tumor suppression in the liver. There are several mechanisms
  by which PHB1 acts as a tumor suppressor in the liver. (a) PHB1 negatively regulates
  the expression of multiple WNT ligands, thereby inhibiting the activation of the
  canonical WNT signaling pathway. (b) In the nucleus, PHB1 and CTCF cooperate to
  negatively regulate the H19-Igf2 axis and inhibit cell proliferation. (c) Nuclear
  PHB1 heterodimerizes with MAX and MATα1 to repress the expression of the oncogenes
  c-MYC, MAFG, and c-MAF and enhance the expression of PHB1 itself and MATα1, which
  also acts as a tumor suppressor. (d) PHB1 reduces the expression of importin α3,
  inhibiting NF-κB nuclear translocation. (e) PHB1 reduces IL-8 transcription and
  release by lowering the nuclear content of NF-κB and c-JUN, thus inhibiting cell
  invasion and migration. (A color version of this figure is available in the online
  journal.)
