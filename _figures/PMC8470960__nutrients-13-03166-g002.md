caption: 'Biochemical pathways involved in the metabolic switch. During intermittent
  fasting, glucose levels drop and through the process of lipolysis, fats (triacylglycerols
  and diacylglycerols) are metabolized to free fatty acids (FFAs). These lipids are
  then transported to the liver where they through the process of β-oxidation and
  the intermediate stages acetyl CoA and HMG-CoA are transformed into the ketones:
  acetoacetate (AcAc) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). BHB and AcAc are transported from
  the blood into the brain and then into neurons. In addition to ketones metabolized
  in the liver, astrocytes are also capable of ketogenesis, which may provide an important
  local source of BHB for neurons. The reduction in availability of glucose and elevation
  of ketones lowers the AMP: ATP ratio in neurons, which activates the kinases AMPK
  and CaKMII and, in turn, through the activation of CREB and PGC1α stimulates autophagy.
  In addition, lower levels of glucose during fasting decrease the activity of the
  mTOR pathway, leading to autophagy. BHB can also upregulate the expression of brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and may thereby promote mitochondrial biogenesis, synaptic
  plasticity, and cellular stress resistance. IF leads to lower levels of circulating
  insulin in the blood, which enhances neuroplasticity and protection against metabolic
  and oxidative stress through the insulin/IGF signaling pathway. Retrieved from []
