caption: 'Fig. 7. Possible actions of CsA on PrP metabolism. (A) The influence of
  CsA on PrP metabolism. (i) In the absence of CsA, ∼90% of nascent PrP molecules
  in the ER gain their native conformation (stage 1) and are exported to the secretory
  pathway (stage 2, filled diamonds). ER cyclophilins (presumably cypB) may play a
  role in normal PrP folding, perhaps through their PPIase activity. PrP chains that
  fail to fold properly (horizontal triangles) are directed to degradation via the
  ERAD machinery. In the course of ERAD, these misfolded PrP molecules are dislocated
  into the cytosol (stage 4) and are degraded by proteasomes (stage 5). Degradation
  is inhibited by ALLN. (ii) The action of CsA is likely to be manifold and may target
  several of the normal metabolic steps outlined above. (a) By inhibiting the PPIase
  activity of cyclophilins, CsA may interfere with stage 1, perhaps by hampering the
  rescue of a minority of PrP molecules with cis X-Pro peptide bonds (see text and
  panel B). As a result, specific CsA-induced PrP molecules are formed (filled triangles).
  The CsA-induced PrP are likely to include non-native X-Pro isomers. (b) CsA could
  also act on some spontaneously misfolded PrP molecules (horizontal triangles) and
  convert them into CsA-induced species (stage 3, filled triangles). In either case,
  the CsA-induced species (filled triangles) are dislocated into the cytosol (stage 4).
  However, in contrast to the normally misfolded species, they escape proteasomal
  degradation and accumulate in aggresomes (stage 6). We envisage two mechanisms whereby
  CsA-induced PrP could avoid proteasomes. First, they might form tight aggregates
  at the exit of the sec61p dislocon, and these deposits may be unresolvable by the
  cytosolic chaperone system in the absence of cyclophilin activity. Another possibility
  is that these species cannot be unfolded to permit proteasomal degradation, perhaps
  because correcting their aberrant X-Pro bonds requires cytosolic cyclophilins, which
  are inhibited by CsA. (B) Model for the generation of misfolded PrP by wtPrP and
  by the P102L and P105L mutants. Upper panel: in all cases the majority of both wild-type
  and mutant (P102L and P105L) PrP is formed with predominantly trans X-Pro (or trans
  X-Leu) peptide bonds (which are energetically favored). Lower panel: (i) in untreated
  cells expressing wtPrP, the small minority of nascent PrP with cis X-Pro bonds is
  corrected to trans by ER cyclophilins and adopts a native conformation (filled diamonds);
  (ii) when cells expressing wtPrP are exposed to CsA, the cis-containing PrP molecules
  fail to be rescued and they misfold and adopt prion-like biochemical properties
  (panel A, filled triangle); (iii) a very small minority of mutant P→L-PrP molecules
  is formed with aberrant cis X-Leu bonds (at positions 102 or 105, depending on the
  mutant). Since cyclophilins fail to correct these molecules, they misfold into prion-like
  PrP. These molecules are normally degraded, hence ALLN is needed to enable their
  accumulation in aggresomes. Because spontaneous cis X-Leu bonds (in the mutants)
  are less probable than their cis X-Pro counterpart (in wtPrP), this model predicts
  that less prion-like PrP will be generated in (iii) than in (ii).'
