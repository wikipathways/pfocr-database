caption: Models of HJV, MT2, and neogenin trafficking in hepatocytes. A, model of
  MT2 cleavage of HJV at the plasma membrane after retrograde transport. Nascent HJV
  traffics from ER to plasma membrane bypassing the Golgi compartment (1), and MT2
  and neogenin follow the traditional biosynthetic pathway and undergo post-translational
  modifications in the TGN/Golgi compartment (2). Upon reaching the plasma membrane,
  HJV forms a complex with MT2 and neogenin, which triggers the internalization and
  retrograde trafficking of the complex into the TGN/Golgi compartment for post-translational
  modifications of HJV (3). Then the complex traffics back to the plasma membrane
  (4) to allow MT2 cleavage of HJV. The cleaved HJV is released from the cells (5).
  B, model of MT2 cleavage of HJV during retrograde transport. Nascent HJV, MT2, and
  neogenin traffic from ER to plasma membrane as described in A (1 and 2). Upon reaching
  the plasma membrane, HJV forms a complex with MT2 and neogenin, which triggers the
  internalization and retrograde trafficking of the complex into the TGN/Golgi compartment
  for cleavage (3). The cleaved HJV by MT2 in this compartment is rapidly secreted
  from the cells (4).
