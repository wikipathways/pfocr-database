caption: Known genes and pathways of the different cell types of the developing testis
  in mouse (modified from Wainwright and Wilhelm ). a Postulated molecular pathways
  underlying Sertoli cell specification, including the regulation of Sry, induction
  of Sox9 expression, and the maintenance of Sox9 expression. b Differentiation of
  peritubular myoid (PM) cells is regulated by signaling from Sertoli cells via desert
  hedgehog (DHH) and its receptor patched 1 (PTCH1). In addition, Dax1 expression
  in Sertoli cells is required for PM cell differentiation, but the molecular mechanism
  still remains to be elucidated. The interaction between Sertoli cells and PM cells
  results in the secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules by both cell types,
  which finally leads to the formation of basement membrane (BM). Both cell types
  contribute distinct components to the ECM, with PM cells secreting fibronectin,
  collagens, and proteoglycans. c–f The regulation of Leydig cell development via
  Sertoli cell and Leydig cell interactions. The morphogen DHH is secreted by Sertoli
  cells and induces Leydig cell specification through its receptor PTCH1. Signaling
  via the receptor NOTCH3 and its effector HES1 is crucial for the maintenance of
  the progenitor population and the restriction of their differentiation to fetal
  Leydig cells. Platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGFA) signaling via the receptor
  PDGFRα plays a role in Leydig cell differentiation. In addition, Sertoli cell expressed
  DAX1/NR0B1 has been implicated in Leydig cell survival. As Leydig cells start to
  differentiate, they start expressing genes required for steroid synthesis, such
  as side chain cleavage (Scc). Differentiated Leydig cells synthesize testosterone
  using the four enzymes P450 side chain cleavage (SCC), 3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta-5-4
  isomerase type 2 (HSD3B2), cytochrome P450 17-hydroxylase (CYP17), and 17β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase 3 (17βHSDIII). The biosynthesis of testosterone leads to the masculinization
  of the developing embryo. Furthermore, fetal Leydig cells express insulin-like factor
  3 (INSL3), which regulates testis decent. Both INSL3 and SCC are regulated by SF1/NR5A1
  at the transcriptional level. Gene products from the female pathways known to interact
  with the male-specific pathway are shown in red. Solid lines in this figure do not
  indicate if the interactions occur in a direct or indirect manner. Genes/gene products
  shown in gray are not mentioned in the text, but have been included to provide a
  more accurate summary of or current knowledge
