caption: TGF-β/Smad classic pathway. Activated TGF-β first integrates TGF-β receptor
  type II (TβRII) and TGF-β receptor type I (TβRI) to form ligand receptor complex.
  This association results in the downstream phosphorylation and activation of Smad2
  and Smad3. Phosphorylated Smad2/3 combines with Smad4 to form a Smad complex in
  cytoplasmic domain and gets nuclear translocation. After translocated into nucleus,
  the adjusted Smad complex is integrated with EMT-related Smad binding element in
  gene promoter region to play regulatory roles. Simultaneously, activated TGF-β can
  also upregulates Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor-2 (Smurf2), an ubiquitin
  ligase which can degrade TGF-β pathway inhibitors like Smad7, SnoN, Ski, and TGIF.
  Through this two aspects, activated TGF-β can lead to podocyte EMT independently.
