caption: 'LOX pathways in the tobacco HR. Hypothetical scheme depicting the role of
  oxylipin RES produced during cryptogein-induced tobacco leaf HR: (1) the production
  of the fatty acid 9-hydroperoxides is at the origin of cell death processes (; )
  that do not include massive production of 9-specific oxylipin RES and conjugation
  to GSH; and (2) the 13 LOX pathway produces downstream oxylipin RES involved in
  the signaling of the response (; ). These oxylipin RES may add to GSH, change the
  redox balance, and add to proteins including putative transcription factors.'
