caption: 'Biochemical pathway for phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis. Small-molecule
  abbreviations: AGN, L-arogenate; CHA, chorismate; DAHP, 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate
  7-P; DHQ, dehydroquinate; DHS, dehydroshikimate; E4P, erythrose-4-P; EPSP, enolpyruvylshikimate
  3-P; HPP, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PHE, phenylalanine;
  PPA, prephenate; PPY, phenylpyruvate; SHK, shikimate; S3P, shikimate-3-P; TYR, tyrosine.
  Enzyme acronyms: [Aat], aromatic aminotransferase; [AroA], DAHP synthase; [AroB]
  DHQ synthase; [AroC], dehydroquinase; [AroD], SHK dehydrogenase; [AroE], SHK kinase;
  [AroF], EPSP synthase; [AroG], CHA synthase; [AroQ/AroR/AroH], CHA mutase; [PheA],
  prephenate dehydratase; [TyrAc], prephenate (cyclohexadienyl) dehydrogenase; [*Aat],
  periplasmic aromatic aminotransferase; [*AroQ], periplasmic chorismate mutase; [*PheC],
  periplasmic cyclohexadienyl dehydratase. (In P. aeruginosa, the only organism so
  far shown to have *Aat, it belongs to the *AatIβ grouping.) The flow route that
  progresses from PPA → AGN → TYR is shown in grey because this is a minor route in
  both P. aeruginosa and S. typhimurium. Different homology groups known so far that
  correspond with a given catalytic step are distinguished by Roman numeral subscripts,
  for example AroAI or AroAII. Subgroups within a homology group carry a further identifier,
  for example AroAIα or AroAIβ . As far as possible, these identifiers have been chosen
  to accommodate (within the constraints of logical naming) established precedents
  of naming. For example, the two homology groups of AroA were originally distinguished
  as class I or class II [50], and α and β subgroups for family-I DAHP synthases were
  defined recently [24]. AroCI and AroCII have been distinguished as biosynthetic
  or catabolic dehydroquinase, respectively, but this is a misnomer as many genomes
  use AroCII for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis (G.X. and R.A.J., unpublished data).
  Thus far, AroEI is used exclusively in Bacteria, and AroEII exclusively in Archaea
  [14]. The AroQIα group of chorismate mutases has been so named to reflect previous
  reference to them as AroQ [22, 46]. Likewise, AroRIβreflects previous reference
  to it as AroR [32]. The α, β and γ subgrouping identifiers for Aat reflect the subgroupings
  within family-I aminotransferases defined by Jensen and Gu [3]. Color-coding is
  used to illustrate the substantial difference between P.aeruginosa and S. typhimurium
  in deployment of different homolog or analog proteins (numbers within boxes indicate
  the number of paralogs), chorismate mutase fusions (peg-and-hole matches) and periplasm-localized
  enzymes.'
