caption: Different redox state between naïve CD4+ T cell and synovium in rheumatoid
  arthritis. In naïve CD4+ T cell of rheumatoid arthritis patients, glucose shunting
  into pentose phosphate pathway due to the change of metabolic key enzymes (PFKFB3
  and G6PD) activity leads to a special microenvironment characterized by low ATP,
  high reducing equivalences (GSH and NADPH) and exhausted ROS. Whether glutaminolysis
  is associated with this remains to unclear. In contrast, synovium of patients experienced
  oxidative stress and abnormal aerobic glycolysis that result from hypoxia in the
  joint. These two split situation destruct joints together by the integration of
  up-regulated TKS5 in naïve CD4+ T cell and high lactates in synovium.
