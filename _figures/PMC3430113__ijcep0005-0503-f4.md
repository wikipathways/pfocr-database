caption: 'Schematic depicting a central role for transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1
  signaling in osteoclastogenesis and immune dysregulation of osteolytic Langerhans
  cell histiocytosis (LCH). Specifically, TGF-β1 expression [,] and signaling in osteolytic
  LCH correlates with and could lead to:1) interleukin (IL)-11 [,,,] and in turn,
  both osteoclastogenesis [,] and the activation of signal transducer and activator
  of transcription (STAT)3 pathway [], evidenced by nuclear expression of phosphorylated
  (p)-STAT3 (Tyr 705) and subsequent expansion of the FoxP3 + population via IL-23
  [,,]; 2) nuclear expression of glioma-associated oncogene protein (Gli)2 [,] leading
  to the formation of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and then to activation
  of RANKL with osteoclastogenesis [,,,]; 3)fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression

  in LCH []) and phosphatidlycholine [], the substrate for phospholipase (PL)D1 with
  subsequent phosphatidic acid(PA) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) formation and in

  activation of PKC-α [-]; and 5) downregulation of CD8+ cell-associated immune surveillance[]

  Gli2 and IL-11 signaling [-,,] and in turn, inhibition of PTHrP and RANKL signaling

  substrate for the PLD1/PKC-α/TGF-β signaling axis; and 3. Inhibit STAT3 activation
