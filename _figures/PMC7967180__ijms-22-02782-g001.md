caption: (A) The leukotriene signaling pathway. Leukotrienes arise from arachidonic
  acid (AA), which is converted to LTA4 by the enzyme 5-Lipoxygenase (5-Lox) and its
  activating protein (FLAP). LTA4 is either metabolized to LTB4 by LTA4 hydrolase
  or to LTC4 by LTC4 synthase. From LTC4, the other cysteinyl leukotrienes, i.e.,
  LTD4 and LTE4, arise. Cysteinyl leukotrienes bind to the receptors CysLTR1, CysLTR2
  and GPR17. Leukotriene signaling can be inhibited by targeting the receptors for
  cysteinyl leukotrienes with the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast. (B)
  Experimental setup. Five-month-old 5xFAD transgenic mice were treated daily with
  vehicle or montelukast in two different doses for 89 days. Behavioral tests were
  performed between day 72 and day 89. On the last day of the behavioral tests, the
  mice were perfused, and tissue samples were collected.
