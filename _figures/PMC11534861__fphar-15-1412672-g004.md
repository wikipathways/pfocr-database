caption: The relevant mechanisms of lactylation in the development of cancer by modulating
  TME. Lactate can also be transported into cells via MCT1 and is converted to lactoyl-CoA,
  (a) which stimulates the expression of METTL3 in TIMs via H3K18 Kla lactylation
  and ultimately promotes the immunosuppressive capacity of TIMs. (b) Lactate accumulation
  and Kla promotes the expression of VEGFA and KIAA1199 via HIF-1α lactylation, thus
  participating in tumorigenesis via angiogenesis pathways. (c) Lactylation of MOESIN
  protein upregulates TGF-β signaling in Treg cells, thereby promoting the proliferation
  of Treg cells and enhancing the tumorigenesis
