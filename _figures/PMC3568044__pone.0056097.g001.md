caption: 'Representations of the nadA (A), farR (B), and mtrR (C) promoter regions
  showing regulatory protein binding sites, intergenic sequences of interest, and
  primer annealing locations with oligonucleotide sizes. White arrows represent each
  open reading frame with the translation start codon noted by “ATG” and a vertical
  line to indicate if a primer overlaps the start codon. Grey arrows represent the
  respective primers including oligonucleotide sizes with the following nomenclature:
  DNA probe for EMSAs - “orf”_prom_F & R; promoter region with start codon fused with
  lacZ - “orf”_F_Bam and “orf”_R_lacZ. IHF and Fur are binding sites for integration
  host factor and ferric uptake regulatory protein, respectively.'
