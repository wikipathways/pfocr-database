caption: 'The production of insulin and the classical insulin signaling pathway. A,
  The production and structure of insulin. Insulin is synthesized by the β-cells of
  the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. It consists of two polypeptide chains,
  linked by disulfide bonds, with a total of 51 amino acids. Insulin plays a crucial
  role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, ensuring the proper balance of blood
  glucose levels in the body. B Classical insulin signaling pathway. In the classical
  insulin signaling pathway, insulin binds to the extracellular α-subunit of the insulin
  receptor (InsR), leading to the dimerization and autophosphorylation of the β-subunit,
  which subsequently activates its kinase activity. The phosphorylated InsR then catalyzes
  the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on insulin receptor substrates (IRS), which
  in turn recruits and activates the PI3K complex. The catalytic subunit of PI3K,
  p110, phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), converting it
  into phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). The phosphatase PTEN can
  counteract the actions of PI3K and Akt by dephosphorylating PIP3, thus reducing
  Akt phosphorylation levels in the cell. It is important to note that PI3K does not
  directly activate Akt. Instead, PI3K interacts with signaling proteins containing
  PH domains, such as Akt and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), which facilitate
  Akt''s translocation to the cell membrane. Once at the membrane, PDK1 catalyzes
  the phosphorylation of Akt at Thr 308, partially activating it. However, full activation
  of Akt requires phosphorylation at Ser 473. This phosphorylation is carried out
  by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2), which fully activates
  Akt’s enzymatic activity. Activated Akt has numerous downstream effects, including:
  1) Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) regulates the activity of glycogen synthase
  (GS), thereby promoting glycogen synthesis. Phosphorylation of GSK3β by Akt inhibits
  the constitutive activity of this key kinase, resulting in the activation of GS
  and the deposition of glucose as glycogen. 2) Activated Akt induces the phosphorylation
  of Forkhead Box O1 (FoxO1), causing its translocation from the nucleus and the loss
  of its transcriptional activity. Glucose-6-phosphatase G-6-pase (G6Pase) and Phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase (PEPCK) are two rate-limiting enzymes in the gluconeogenesis pathway.
  FoxO1 can bind to promoter regions of the G6Pase and PEPCK genes, increasing their
  transcriptional activity. This enhances hepatic glucose production, leading to elevated
  blood glucose levels. 3) Akt directly phosphorylates Tuberous Sclerosis Complex
  (TSC) 2 at multiple sites, thereby reducing the inhibitory effect of the TSC1-TSC2
  complex on Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) and mTORC1. This leads to the activation
  of mTORC1 in response to insulin signaling, regulating lipid, nucleotide, and glucose
  metabolism. 4) The most significant correlation with systemic blood glucose control
  is the phosphorylation of AS160, a 160-kDa Akt substrate. AS160 regulates the translocation
  of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) to the cell membrane, facilitating glucose
  uptake into muscle, adipose tissue, and certain neurons. FoxO1 forkhead Box O1,
