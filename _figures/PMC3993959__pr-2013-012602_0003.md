caption: Bioinformatic analyses expose alterations in nucleic acid binding and regulatory
  proteins. (A) PANTHER analysis revealed enrichment for nucleic acid binding proteins
  (top). Expansion of this family of proteins identified RNA binding proteins (center)
  involved in mRNA processing (bottom) as substantially enriched. In addition, transcription
  factors (top) and other DNA binding proteins (center) were also enriched. (B) KEGG
  pathway analysis revealed dysregulation of spliceosomal components. Robust coverage
  of proteins was observed for proteins involved in spliceosomal processing of mRNA
  (yellow for identifications) and several spliceosomal components were differentially
  regulated in HIV-1 infected MDM (green = decreased expression in HIV-1-infected
  cells, pink = increased expression). The corresponding protein ID for each gene
  name provided by KEGG is available in .
