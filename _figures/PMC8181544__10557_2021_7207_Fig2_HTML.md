caption: 'Therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes in COVID-19 patients may include
  molecules addressing different targets involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.
  The battery of therapeutic compounds include the following: antivirals (remdesivir,
  convalescent plasma), molecules with effects against the inflammatory pathways (corticosteroids,
  tocilizumab, baricitinib), anticoagulants (heparins, DOAC), complement inhibitors
  (eculizumab, anti-complement C3 antibodies), or compounds reducing endothelial damage
  (defibrotide, Ang-II pathway antagonists, ACE inhibitors)'
