caption: TGF-β can signal through both the classical pathway and the non-canonical
  pathway. Signaling through the classical pathway is initiated upon binding of ligand
  to the type II TGF-β receptor (TGF-βRII). The type II receptor is autophosphorylated,
  and recruits and transphosphorylates a type I receptor (TGF-βRI). The activated
  type I receptor in turn phosphorylates and activates a receptor-Smad (R-Smad). The
  R-Smad then binds the common co-Smad and translocates to the nucleus. Once in the
  nucleus, it binds transcriptional co-factors and forms an activated transcriptional
  complex capable of inducing transcription of profibrotic genes. In the non-canonical
  pathway, TRAF6 associates with the type-I TGF-β receptor (TGF-βRI). It recruits
  and activates TGF-β associated kinase-1 (TAK1), which in turn activates p38MAPK.
  The p38MAPK is able to activate an R-Smad independent of TGF-β receptor kinase activity.
  Alternatively, p38MAK can initiate a signaling cascade resulting in altered transcription
  through other mediators that lead to enhanced matrix degradation.
