caption: Three apoptotic pathways (Extrinsic, intrinsic and granzyme pathways). In
  the extrinsic pathway, the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway is triggered by
  ligation of a death receptor, followed by the assembly of a caspase activation platform
  called the DISC complex. This activation platform recruits and activates caspase-8
  via adaptor molecules, and then subsequently leads to caspase 8-mediated activation
  of downstream effector caspases. In the intrinsic pathway, in response to various
  cellular stresses, pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl2 family mediate mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), permitting the release of pro-apoptotic
  factors such as cytochrome c into the cytosol. Cytochrome c then binds to APAF1,
  mediating its oligomerization and recruitment of caspase 9 into the apoptosome,
  which in turn leads to the activation of caspase 9 and subsequent proteolytic activation
  of effector caspases. In the granzyme B pathway, the injection of granzyme B by
  cytotoxic T-Cells can lead to the direct proteolytic activation of caspase 10, among
  other targets, which subsequently leads to the activation of effector caspases.
