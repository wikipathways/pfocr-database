caption: Abbreviated summary of monocyte activation pathways. Proteins depicted as
  red ovals were selected as candidate markers of monocyte activation. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) requires the presence of LBP (lipopolysaccharide binding protein) and sCD14
  (soluble cluster of differentiation 14), to TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) and the
  NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) (). Activating
  monocytes cleave surface CD163 (Cluster of Differentiation 163) in to a soluble
  form (sCD163) (). Monocytes may also be activated by pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPS) which lead to release IL-18 via the inflammasome pathway (). Classical
  monocytes (CD14+, CD16−) eventually transition to intermediate (CD14+CD16+) and
  eventually non-classical monocytes (CD14low, CD16+) (), the latter of which are
  a source of CCL18 (chemokine C-C motif ligand 18) ().
