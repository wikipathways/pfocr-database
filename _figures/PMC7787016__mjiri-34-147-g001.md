  On the other hand, it may interfere with the normal function of ACE2 and lead to
  cardiovascular complications (, ). ACE2 dysfunction results in elevated concentration
  of Ang II, which increases oxidative stress and inflammation and could lead to development
  of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and diabetes-related complications (). ACE2/Ang(–)
  pathway has the protective effect in patients with type 2 diabetes and can be a
  treatment strategy in Ang‐II‐mediated T2DM through modulating blood glucose by adjusting
  the levels of Ang II and/or Ang-(-) in pancreatic cells and regulating insulin secretion
  (-) ().
