caption: Significant reaction steps involved in the biosynthetic pathway of individual
  ketocarotenoids from β-carotene in transgenic maize transformed with ParacrtW. The
  dotted ovals indicate the different substrates competitively modified by CRTW and
  BCH, leading to the formation of monoketocarotenoids and diketocarotenoids.

  phenotypes for the carotenoid pathway in maize.
