caption: 'Schematic drawing of the modulation of P2X3 receptors by LPA. Left: The
  LPA1 receptor couples to heterotrimeric Gq/11 proteins to activate PLCβ. PLCβ hydrolyzes
  membrane PI (4, 5) P2 to IP3 and DAG. DAG activates PKC, which enhances the activity
  of P2X3 receptors. LPA activates LPA1 receptors, resulting in the potentiation of
  P2X3 receptor activity via the above signal pathway, while the potentiation was
  blocked by inhibition of LPA1 receptors, Gq/11 proteins and PKC signaling by Ki16198,
  GDP-β-S and GF109203X. Middle: Activation of P2X3 receptors by α,β-meATP causes
  an inward-current, which drives nociceptors to the threshold and initiates action
  potentials (APs). Right: Intraplantar injection of α,β-meATP activates P2X3 receptors
  in peripheral nociceptors to produce nociceptive information, which is transmitted
  to the brain and then elicits pain. The LPA potentiation of α,β-meATP-activated
  currents in DRG neurons resulted in an increase of action potentials number and
  then an amplification of α,β-meATP -induced pain.'
