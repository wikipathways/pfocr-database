caption: Schematic model of AmpC β-lactamase induction in Gram-negative organisms.
  The AmpG–AmpR–AmpC pathway as well as the BlrA/BlrB two component regulatory system
  are indicated. The presence of β-lactams results in excessive breakdown of the murein
  sacculus and thus in accumulation of muropeptides. This accumulation causes either
  the activation of AmpR (AmpG–AmpR–AmpC pathway shown on the left) or the phosphorylation
  of BlrA (BlrA/BlrB two component regulatory system shown on the right); in both
  situations, there is induction of the ampC gene. LT, lytic transglycosylase; PBP,
  Penicillin-Binding Protein.
