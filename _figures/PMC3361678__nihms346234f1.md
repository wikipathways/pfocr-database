caption: Many host factors are involved at each step of the HCV life cycle, which
  starts with virus binding to its specific receptors (CD81, CLDN1, OCLN, and SR-BI).
  The receptor tyrosine kinases EGF-R and EphA2 also appear to participate in viral
  entry at a post-binding step. After viral uncoating, the positive-sense HCV RNA
  is translated and also serves as a template for RNA replication and polyprotein
  translation. Viral RNA replication occurs on an altered host membrane compartment
  known as the membranous web; a short list of host factors believed to support web
  formation and/or RNA replication is shown here. Viral assembly and secretion occur
  through the secretory pathway with the help of other host factors such as DGAT1,
  apoB, and/or apoE.
