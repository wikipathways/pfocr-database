caption: Schematic figure depicting the potential role of LPS on endometrial receptivity
  in sheep. In the presence of LPS, the TLR 4/ERK signaling pathway is activated,
  and TLR4 and ERK phosphorylation inhibitors significantly reduced the expression
  of TLR4 and p-ERK, down-regulated Th1 cytokines, up-regulated Th2 cytokines, and
  alleviated the disruption of genes for attachment
