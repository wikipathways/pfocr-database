caption: 'Hair follicle cycling. The initial developmental phase of hair follicle
  development terminates with catagen and the first telogen, after which repetitive
  cycles of anagen (the growth phase), catagen (the regression phase), and telogen
  (the resting phase) occur throughout the life span of the animal. In general, the
  hair follicle spends most of its time in anagen, but cycle duration varies according
  to location, gender, age, and species. The bulge is the source of stem cells for
  the regenerating hair follicle that is responding to signals from the dermal or
  follicular papilla (FP). ORS: outer root sheath, IRS: inner root sheath, HS: hair
  shaft, mel: melanin for the hair shaft, HM: hair matrix, BM: basement membrane,
  SG: sebaceous gland, and APM: arrector pili muscle [].'
