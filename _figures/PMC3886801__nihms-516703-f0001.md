caption: A. Cytokines such as IL-6, or growth factors including EGF and FGF, initiate
  STAT-3 signal transduction when they bind to their receptors and activate intracellular
  kinases. JAK proteins or receptor tyrosine kinases recruit inactive STAT-3 monomers
  and phosphorylate them on tyrosine 705. STAT-3 is also activated directly through
  interaction with the oncogenic kinases Src and Bcl-Abl. Tyrosine phosphorylated
  STAT-3 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, where STAT-3 transcriptional regulation
  is further modulated by serine phosphorylation. Active STAT-3 dimers bind to consensus
  sequences in the promoters of genes that regulate cell growth and anti-apoptotic
  behavior. B. Multiple STAT-3 endogenous inhibitors attenuate STAT-3 signaling. SOCS-3
  inhibits JAK activation and subsequent signal transduction in the cytoplasm, while
  PIAS3 inhibits STAT-3 DNA binding in the nucleus. Protein tyrosine phosphatases
  such as SHP-1 and SHP-2 dephosphorylate active STAT-3 complexes.
