caption: Bcl-xL is necessary for the survival of small pre-selection DP thymocytes
  during αβT cell development. c-Myb, RORγt and TCF-1 are all required to efficiently
  up-regulate Bcl-xL expression in DP thymocytes. RORγt also promotes the large to
  small pre-selection DP transition. Increased c-Myb expression in small pre-selection
  DP thymocytes promotes the expression of Bcl-xL by a genetic pathway independent
  of RORγt and TCF-1. Expression of RORγt appears to be TCF-1 dependent.
