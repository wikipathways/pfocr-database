caption: Platelet activation and effect on tumor growth. During platelet activation
  prostaglandin synthesis by COX-1 is directly inhibited by aspirin, thus preventing
  proliferative cell signalling pathway activation. Aspirin also inhibits platelet
  ‘realesate’ and tumor factors released during platelet-tumor crosstalk promoting
  tumor growth. VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PDGF, platelet derived growth
  factor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PG, prostaglandin;
  TxA2, thromboxane A2; ADP, adenosine diphosphate. Reproduced from Ornelas et al.
