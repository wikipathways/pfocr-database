caption: Development of ovarian high-grade and low-grade serous carcinomas involves
  two distinct pathways. Low-grade (Type I) carcinomas arise from serous borderline
  tumors (SBTs), which in turn develop from serous cystadenomas. This stepwise tumor
  progression in the low-grade pathway contrasts with the rapid progression pathway
  of high-grade (Type II) carcinomas, for which precursor lesions are not well recognized.
  High-grade carcinomas may arise from ovarian surface inclusions, peritoneal mesothelium
  or the distal portion (fimbriae) of the fallopian tube. These carcinomas disseminate
  to pelvic and peritoneal organs early in their progression.
