caption: Schematic representation of the model for partially adapting PIP2 hydrolysis
  induced by the Gq pathway. Initial PIP2 hydrolysis upon Gq–GPCR activation is due
  to the formations of highly efficient GαqGTP–PLCβ–Gβγ sandwich complex. The subsequent
  partial adaptation (recovery) of the hydrolysis, indicated by the PIP2 synthesis,
  is due to the dissociation of Gβγ from this complex. Therefore, the steady-state
  partial PIP2 hydrolysis is primarily governed by the less-efficient GαqGTP–PLCβ
  complex. Injection of fresh Gβγ (from other GPCR pathways) converts GαqGTP–PLCβ
  to the sandwich complex, rescuing the PIP2 hydrolysis. The ability of Gβγ to stay
  bound to the PM is determined by the PM affinity of Gγ in the Gbγ dimer. Therefore,
  in the presence of Gβγ with high-PM affinity Gγ such as Gγ3, the PIP2 hydrolysis
  adaptation is slower than that of cells expressing low-PM affinity Gγ9. PIP2, phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate; PLCβ, phospholipase C β.
