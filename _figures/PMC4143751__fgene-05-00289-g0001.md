caption: Nutritional methyl-supplements and the DNA methylation reaction. Methyl groups,
  either synthesized via the folate cycle or donated directly from betaine, are activated
  by the methyl activation cycle. Activated methyl groups are used to methylate cytosine
  residues of DNA. Both vitamin B12 and zinc are cofactors used in the transfer of
  methyl groups. Compounds listed in bold and underlined are methyl donors or cofactors
  included in various methyl supplemented diets. Select enzymes involved in this pathway,
  including MTHFR, where single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) variant genotypes have
  been documented (as detailed in the manuscript) are shaded.
