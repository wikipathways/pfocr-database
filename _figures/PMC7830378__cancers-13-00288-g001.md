caption: Metabolic reprogramming of glucose metabolism in UC. Oxygen-dependent hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) and oxygen-independent PI3K/AKT/mTOR and PPARy signaling
  (yellow boxes) drive metabolic reprogramming in UC by controlling the activity of
  rate-limiting enzymes (blue boxes) or transporters. Numbers (orange boxes) indicate
  which gene drives activation of particular rate-limiting enzymes or transporters.
  Glucose is imported into the cell by glucose transporters (GLUT) 1 and 3. Glycolysis
  starts with phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase (HK) to glucose-6-phosphate,
  preventing glucose from diffusing outside the cell. Glucose-6-phosphate can be dehydrogenated
  by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) to enter the pentose phosphate cycle
  (PPP) to produce pentoses like ribose-5-phosphate required for the synthesis of
  nucleotides and NADPH, which is necessary for reductive processes such as lipid
  biosynthesis. If glucose-6-phosphate is not oxidized by G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate
  is isomerized by phosphoglucose isomerase/phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI) to fructose-6-phosphate.
  Next, phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate
  to fructose-1,6-biphosphate, which irreversibly channels the glucose-derived metabolite
  into the glycolytic pathway towards phosphoenolpyruvate. At the end of the glycolytic
  pathway, pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP) to produce one pyruvate and one ATP molecule. Pyruvate is then metabolized
  into lactate-by-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Lactate is transported outside the
  cell by monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) 1 and 2, which leads to an increased
  concentration of extracellular lactate and an acidified tumor micro-environment.
  Pyruvate can also be metabolized into acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which participates
  in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle inside mitochondria to give rise to ATP and
  intermediary metabolites that are required for lipid and amino acid biogenesis.
