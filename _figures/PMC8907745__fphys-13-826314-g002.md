caption: Principal hormonal, autocrine/paracrine modulators of adipocyte lipolysis.
  The binding of insulin to its receptor, IRS-1, leads to the activation of both PI3K/Akt
  and mTORC1 pathways, which result in the inhibition of lipolysis, either through
  the decrease of cAMP levels by PDE-3B (PI3K pathway) or by inhibiting the transcription
  of ATGL. The gut hormone ghrelin is also considered anti-lipolytic since it stimulates
  the PI3K pathway as well. Furthermore, lipolysis can also be inhibited by adiponectin,
  which inhibits PKA, through the reduction of its regulatory subunit of RIIα. In
  contrast, many of lipolysis’ regulators act on the pro-lipolytic PKA pathway, which
  is typically activated by catecholamines and can be inhibited by different factors
  upon binding to their respective Gi-coupled receptors. Of note, catecholamines and
  adenosine can both have pro- and anti-lipolytic effects depending on which receptor
  is predominantly expressed. AC, adenylyl cyclase; AR, adrenergic receptor; ATGL,
