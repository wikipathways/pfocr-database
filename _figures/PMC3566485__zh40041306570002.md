caption: Role of G6PD in both antioxidant and oxidant formation pathways. The pentose
  phosphate pathway produces NADPH through G6PD and 6PGD. NADPH supports the antioxidant
  glutathione pathway in which glutathione reductase (GR) uses NADPH to reduce oxidized
  glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH) for use by glutathione peroxidase
  (GPx) to reduce H2O2 to H2O. On the other hand, NADPH is also used to produce superoxide
  (O2·−) via NADPH oxidase, uncoupled nitric oxide synthase, and xanthine oxidase.
  O2·− is converted to H2O2 by O2·− dismutase (SOD), and the overproduction of these
  reactive oxygen species may adversely affect cell function.
