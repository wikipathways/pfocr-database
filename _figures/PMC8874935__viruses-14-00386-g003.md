caption: Proposed mechanisms by which ZIKV may affect Vav and Rho GTPase signaling.
  (A) ZIKV can bind and enter cells via TAM receptors, including through an interaction
  with the TAM ligand Gas6, which can signal via Vav and Rho GTPases with unknown
  outcomes for this signaling pathway; (B) ZIKV NS2A binds to and disrupts adherens
  junctions, a structure that is regulated by Vav and Rho GTPases, with Vav itself
  a potential adherens junction component; (C) ZIKV NS4A/B inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway,
  which is part of a positive feedback loop via PIP3 activation of Vav to drive neurite
  outgrowth; (D) ZIKV induces SOCS1 and USP9X expression which can affect Vav ubiquitination
  (Ub) and proteosomal degradation, or ZAP70-induced Vav phosphorylation, which would
  be predicted to influence Vav activation of Rho GTPases. Predicted outcomes are
  reduced adherens junctions’ formation and alterations in the actin cytoskeleton
  that affect the polarization and NPC environment leading to a reduced NPC pool.
  In neurons, reduced Vav/RhoGTPase signaling is predicted to lead to reduced neurite
  outgrowth or growth cone collapse, affecting the dynamic changes that influence
  development of the complex brain architecture. AJ = adherens junctions. Created
