caption: Model for the dichotomous effects of VCD on follicular development. Short-exposure
  VCD treatment transiently activates key proteins in the PI3K-Akt pathway and mTOR
  pathway, with the phosphorylation levels of different phosphorylation sites of Akt,
  Foxo3a, P70S6k, and rpS6 increasing to varying degrees, thereby activating a portion
  of the primordial follicle pool. Upon extended VCD exposure (i.e., exposure time
  exceeding 6 h), the expression of negative regulatory factors for follicle activation
  increases (Foxo3a and Foxl2) but the expression decreases for transcription factors
  that promote early follicular development and PFA (e.g., Nobox, Gdf9, Figla, Sohlh1,
  and Sohlh2). Additionally, the Pten level is elevated after 24 h of VCD exposure.
  Thus, starting from around hour 6 h of VCD exposure, a “braking mechanism” is activated
  that inhibits the activation or further development of resting primordial follicles.
  VCD induces the expression of aromatase in secondary follicles, thereby promoting
  further development of secondary follicles. VCD therefore exhibits dichotomous effects
  based on dosage and treatment time and has specific effects on follicles at particular
  development stages.
