caption: 'Altered signaling pathways and inhibitors. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),
  EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs). In GBM, 40–60% of cases exhibit EGFR amplification and high EGFR protein
  expression levels. PDGFR is overexpressed at the transcriptional level. EGFR activation
  initiates signal transduction such as the PI3K/Akt pathway. EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII)
  is a constitutively activated mutation of EGFR, that is, expressed in approximately
  25% of GBM cases but not in normal tissues; Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), SHH is a secreted
  protein critical for pattern formation in the central nervous system. SHH ligand
  binding to its receptors, patched homolog (PTCH) and smoothened homolog (SMO), leads
  to the activation of gliotactin (GLI) transcription factors that are translocated
  into the nuclease to regulate various cellular activities, including the maintenance
  of cell stemness, survival, and proliferation; NOTCH, The Notch pathway is initiated
  by the binding of transmembrane ligands on one cell to the notch receptors on an
  adjacent cell. This binding causes the γ-secretase-mediated proteolytic release
  of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Released NICD translocates into the nucleus
  and then turns CSL (a transcriptional factor) from a repressor to an activator,
  causing various effects; WNT, Wnt signals are divided into 2 different pathways:
  the canonical or WNT/β-catenin pathway is involved in cell fate determination and
  the noncanonical pathway is involved in the control of cell movement and tissue
  polarity []. Following the binding of Wnt protein to a receptor complex comprising
  Frizzleds/low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (Fz/LRP), cytoplasmic
  disheveled (Dvl) is phosphorylated. The phosphorylation of Dvl inhibits the activity
  of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), elevating nonphosphorylated β-catenin levels
  in the cytoplasm. β-Catenin translocates into the nucleus and forms a complex with
  members of the T-cell transcription factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor
  (LEF) family of transcription factors.'
