caption: In plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs, neurofibromin loss deregulates multiple
  proteins from both the classic Ras and R-Ras subfamilies. NF1 stimulates an intrinsic
  GTPase activity in Ras proteins, causing them to cleave a phosphate from bound GTP
  and inactivate themselves. Ras is reactivated when guanine nucleotide exchange factors
  (eg, Sos), which themselves are activated by stimuli such as growth factors, cause
  Ras to release GDP and bind a new molecule of GTP. Despite their similar regulation,
  classic Ras and R-Ras proteins have overlapping (proliferation) and distinct (migration,
  survival) effects. This reflects the ability of different Ras families to differentially
  activate signaling pathways. Classic Ras proteins activate the Raf/MEK/ERK1/2/RSK
  and PI3K/Akt/mTORC1/S6K1 pathways, thereby enhancing proliferation and survival.
  It is known that R-Ras proteins can activate the PI3K pathway as well, but little
  is known about the cytoplasmic pathways they activate to promote migration. Note
  that, for the sake of simplicity, the illustration of the PI3K pathway was simplified,
  and some key regulators of this pathway are not shown (eg, Rheb, TSC1/2). ERK, extracellular
  signal-related kinase; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; MEK, mitogen-activated
  protein ERK kinase; MPNST, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; NF1, neurofibromin; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RSK,
  ribosomal S6 kinase.
