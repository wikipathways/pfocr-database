caption: 'Mechanisms by which OPV confers immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and mitigates
  its severity (1) OPV inhibits PVR/CD155 receptor and its downstream binding with
  TIGIT, thereby removing its immuno-inhibitory effect on NK cells and T cells, so
  they are in active state to combat invading pathogen. (2) OPV stimulates trained
  innate immunity by activating PRR through PAMP. PRR initiates metabolic reprogramming
  and epigenetic modifications which increase the chromatin accessibility for rapid
  binding of transcription factor at promoter and enhancer region of pro-inflammatory
  gene, thus resulting in enhanced gene expression and heightened response on re-exposure
  to invading pathogen by increase release of cytokines and interferon through activation
  of NF-kB pathway. (3) Increase cytokine release in the adjacent microenvironment
  mediates TCR-independent activation of T-cell as a bystander effect, despite the
  weak binding of PV antigen to TCR. (4) OPV inhibits PVR and its binding to CD226
  which is a costimulatory molecule, thereby preventing excessive cytokine release
  and subsequent cytokine storm, thus mitigating the severity of COVID-19. OPV: Oral
  poliovirus, APC: Antigen-presenting cell, TCR: T-cell receptor, NK cell: Natural
  killer cell, NK-T cell: Natural killer T-cell, NF-kB: Nuclear factor kappa beta,
  PV: Poliovirus, PVR: Poliovirus receptor, TCR: T-cell receptor, PAMP: Pathogen-associated
  molecular pattern, PRR: Pattern recognition receptor.'
