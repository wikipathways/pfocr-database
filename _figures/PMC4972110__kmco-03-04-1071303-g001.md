caption: Oncogenic addiction versus synthetic lethality to explain GSK621-induced
  cytotoxicity in AML. (A) In the oncogenic addiction model, GSK621 activates AMPK.
  Upon activation, AMPK inactivates mTORC1 (mTOR/raptor complex) by direct phosphorylation
  of raptor. AMPK also indirectly inhibits mTORC1 via an activating phosphorylation
  of TSC1/2 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ½) harboring a GAP (GTPase activating protein)
  activity toward rheb (ras-homolog enriched in brain), a small G-protein involved
  in mTORC1 activation. Hence, AMPK-dependent TSC1/2 activation favors inactive GDP-bound
  rheb, ultimately inhibiting mTORC1 activity. (B) In the synthetic lethality model,
  AMPK and mTORC1 activities are uncoupled. In AML cells, mTORC1 is overactivated
  due to unidentified upstream signals. Co-activation of AMPK and mTORC1 activates
  the eIF2α signaling pathway, which triggers autophagic cell death accounting for
  GSK621-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, eIF2α activation and autophagy might stimulate
  cancer immunogenicity through dendritic cell-mediated activation of cytotoxic T
  lymphocytes.
