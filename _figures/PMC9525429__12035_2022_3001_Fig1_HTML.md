caption: 'Pattern of a potential final common mechanism of antidepressant action.
  Acute or chronic SD increases the adenosine levels in the brain and activates A1Rs
  and A2ARs. Subsequently, ARs act on various signaling pathways, including cAMP,
  PKA, Ca2 + , and MAPK in the cytoplasm, and converge on the phosphorylation of the
  transcriptional factor CREB. The phosphorylated CREB enters the nucleus and binds
  with the CRE sites on Homer1 and Per1/2 promoters to regulate their transcription.
  Simultaneously, these genes are transcriptionally regulated by CLOCK/BMAL1 via E-box
  elements on their promoters. Concurrently, PER form complexes with CRY in the cytoplasm,
  which in turn compete with CLOCK/BMAL1 complexes and block their transcription,
  as well as Homer1a expression. SD, sleep deprivation; AC, adenylate cyclase; PLCb,
  phospholipase C beta; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate;
  IP3, inositol triphosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. Arrows
  indicate activation: the thicker arrow indicates that adenosine may have a preferential
  activation effect on A1R during acute SD. In parallel, the red lines indicate inhibition,
  where the thicker line indicates greater inhibition of A2AR by caffeine'
