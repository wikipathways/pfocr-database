caption: Three patterns of abnormal hedgehog signaling activation in cancer. Positive
  and negative regulatory components, Smo and Ptch are depicted in red and blue, respectively.
  a Type 1 - ligand independent oncogenic Hh pathway (autonomous). The gain-of-function
  mutant Smo (red asterisk) and the loss-of-function mutant Ptch or Sufu (blue asterisk)
  can activate the Hh signaling pathway. b Type 2 - ligand dependent oncogenic Hh
  pathway (autocrine or juxtacrine). The autocrine Hh ligand of tumor cells is taken
  up by the same tumor cells (autocrine) or adjacent tumor cells (juxtacrine), and
  stimulates the Hh signaling in cancer by interacting with Ptch and Smo. c Type 3/a
  - ligand dependent oncogenic Hh pathway (paracrine). This is the paracrine mode
  in which stromal cells take up the Hh ligand secreted by tumor cells, and then secrete
  some growth factors, such as VEGF and IGF, which provide a suitable environment
  for tumor cells growth. d Type 3/b - ligand dependent oncogenic Hh pathway (reverse
  paracrine). This is the reverse paracrine mode in which tumor cells directly take
  up the Hh ligand secreted by stromal cells, triggering cascade response of Hh signaling
