caption: The functional dichotomy of CXCR4 and ACKR3/CXCR7 in platelets. CXCR4 is
  a Gαi-coupled GPCR which may exert its influence on platelet biogenesis (megakaryopoiesis),
  and pro-thrombotic response. CXCL12/SDF1α engages CXCR4 on platelets to trigger
  intraplatelet-calcium mobilization, the platelet activatory signaling pathway involving
  PI3K, Akt, which promotes platelet activation, aggregation, and a pro-thrombotic
  response. Moreover, Gαi-coupled CXCR4 induces a canonical signaling cascade following
  ligation by CXCL12/SDF-1α that imposes an inhibitory effect on AC and impedes the
  generation of cAMP. On the contrary, ACKR3/CXCR7 is an atypical GPCR, which does
  not engage a G protein but mostly β-arrestin. Physiological and pharmacological
  ligands of ACKR3/CXCR7 promote platelet survival. ACKR3/CXCR7-ligation by a pharmacological
  agonist (VUF11207) counteracts calcium mobilization induced by platelet-activating
  stimuli. ACKR3/CXCR7-ligation triggers the platelet inhibitory signaling cascade
  involving AC-cAMP-PKA, while counteracting activatory signaling mediators to impose
  an inhibition on platelet activation, degranulation, aggregation and pro-thrombotic
  response (red arrows denote an inhibitory effect on the process). This exemplifies
  the functional dichotomy of platelet CXCR4 and ACKR3/CXCR7 in mediating pro- and
  anti-thrombotic effects respectively.
