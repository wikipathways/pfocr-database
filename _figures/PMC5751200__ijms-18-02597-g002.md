caption: The BMP-2 signaling pathway plays an important role in the osteogenic differentiation
  of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). BMP-2 signaling induces downstream effectors
  SMAD 1 and SMAD 4, which in turn activate the key osteogenic transcription factors
  Runx2 and Osterix (Osx). Several miRNAs are expressed during this process that can
  attenuate this osteogenic pathway at various steps (red bars). * miR-23a interacts
  with Runx2, but there are numerous miRNAs targeting Runx2 in addition to miR-23a
  (Refs. [,]).
