caption: BPS-induced placental dysfunction working model. Trophoblast cell fusion
  is a cAMP-activated of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway which triggers the expression
  of the transcription factor glial cell missing factor 1 (GCM1). GCM1 in turn stimulates
  transcription activity of fusogenic genes, such as endogenous retrovirus envelope
  genes (ERVW). ERVW genes, such as enJSRV in sheep, can promote cell fusion, resulting
  in binucleate cell formation. However, before cell fusion can occur, cell to cell
  communication between two adjacent cells has to take place. E-cadherin, a transmembrane
  protein, facilitates cell to cell communication by the formation of adherens junctions
  in trophoblast cells (red cellular membranes). Under physiological conditions (left
  side), e-cadherin expression facilitates cell-to-cell communication enabling trophoblast
  fusion to occur and binucleate cells to form, resulting in normal placental endocrine
  function. Our findings demonstrate that gestational BPS exposure (right side) results
  in lower placental e-cadherin expression, preventing the formation of adherens junctions
  required for cell fusion and thus reducing the number of binucleate cells and expression
  of fusogenic genes (enJSRV and HYAL2). Altogether, this results in placental endocrine
  dysfunction. We hypothesize that the upregulation of GCM1 expression is a compensatory
  mechanism to overcome reduced trophoblast fusion rate.
