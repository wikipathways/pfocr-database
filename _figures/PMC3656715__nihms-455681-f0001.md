caption: Hippocampal BDNF/TrkB signaling pathways that modulate depressive behavior
  and antidepressant responses. Binding of BDNF to TrkB activates different intracellular
  signaling cascades, including the PI3K/Akt, Ras/ERK (MAPK) and PLCγ pathways [].
  Phosphorylation of Y490 of TrkB leads to recruitment of adaptor proteins such as
  Shc, Grb2 and Gab1 and subsequent activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway [] and Rho
  family of GTPases (RhoA, Rac, Cdc42), which positively regulate actin polymerization
  through downstream signaling including ROCK/PAK, LimK and Cofilin [-]. Another downstream
  effector of the PI3K/Akt pathway is GSK-3, whose activity is negatively regulated
  by Akt-mediated phosphorylation []. One of the downstream targets of GSK-3 is β-catenin,
  which can be translocated into the nucleus to promote gene expression. The mTOR
  pathway, which facilitates local translation and the rapid antidepressant effects
  of ketamine, is also regulated by PI3K/Akt signaling []. Activation of PI3K/Akt
  signaling is believed to positively modulate spinogenesis, synaptogenesis and neurogenesis,
  thus inducing antidepressant effects. In addition to inductive effects on gene expression,
  the Ras/ERK (MAPK) pathway also acts through Rho family of GTPases, mTOR signaling,
  and synapsin to induce spinogenesis, synaptogenesis and neurogenesis (not shown)
  [, , ]. Phosphorylation of Y816 of TrkB recruits PLCγ [], inducing the hydrolysis
  of PIP2 to IP3 and DAG. IP3 regulates calcium release and CAMK activation, while
  DAG activates PKC. Both IP3/CAMK and DAG/PKC signaling regulate synaptic plasticity
  [], however their roles in depression remain largely unknown.
