caption: A schematic diagram of the function of T cells regulated by Drp1-mediated
  mitochondrial fission. Under the action of the ERK pathway, the phosphorylation
  of Ser616 activates Drp1, and the activated Drp1 mediates mitochondrial fission.
  After fragmentation, the mitochondria migrate along the microtubule to the uropod,
  where they provide ATP for T cell movement. The initiation of mitochondrial fission
  begins with contact between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, then
  resting T cells transition to migrating T cells. Part of the fragmented mitochondria
  migrates to the immune synapse, where calcium ions are absorbed to regulate calcium
  currents. Under a suitable calcium current, mTOR and cMyc are further activated
  to enhance the transcription of activation-related genes. The main metabolic pathway
  of these T cells is glycolysis, and the T cells differentiate into effector T cells
  (TE). Fragmented mitochondria also produce ROS, activate CD95L transcription, further
  activate CD95 and mediate T cell apoptosis. T cells are converted to a memory-like
  phenotype (TM) when knockdown of Drp1 inhibits mitochondrial fission and distributes
  fused mitochondria within T cells.
