caption: 'A proposed model of the interaction between extracellular ATP signaling
  and JA signaling in plants based on Tripathi et al. (2018). Extracellular ATP, released
  after cellular damage by pathogen attack, binds to the P2K1 receptor on the plasma
  membrane. The activated P2K1 receptor turns on extracellular ATP signaling, which
  directly enhances JA signaling by changing the interaction of the COI1-JAZ1 complex.
  Eventually, P2K1-mediated ATP signaling induces the defense response against pathogens
  by crosstalk with the JA-mediated pathway in addition to the ATP-specific pathway.
  This ATP-activated JA signaling requires the formation of second messengers (Ca2+,
  ROS, and NO) and is probably a bypass event that occurs before bona fide JA synthesis
  to prime plant defense responses. TF: transcription factor.'
