caption: Synergistic effect of H2S and NO on vascular smooth muscle relaxation. The
  3MST/CAT pathway mainly produces H2S in the endothelium, while CSE produces H2S
  in smooth muscles. There is a synergistic effect of H2S on vascular smooth muscle
  relaxation with NO, which is produced by NOS from arginine. NOS, nitric oxide synthetase.
