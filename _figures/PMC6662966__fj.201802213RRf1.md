caption: 'Genome-wide CRISPR depletion screen. A) Schema of the screen. Human HCC
  cell lines, HCCLM3 and SNU449, were transduced with a GeCKO v2 lentivirus gRNA library
  at an MOI of 0.2 and selected with puromycin (Puro) (4 µg/ml), and the resultant
  GeCKO-ready cells were allowed to grow for 10 doublings in normal growth conditions.
  Cells harboring gRNAs that knock out cellular targets that are important for cell
  growth and survival will have a disadvantage in proliferation and therefore result
  in the respective gRNAs being depleted from the final population. gRNAs from samples
  collected at end point are compared against those at d 0 using next-generation sequencing
  (NGS) to identify hits, which are defined as growth-promoting genes with multiple
  targeting gRNAs significantly depleted in end point samples. B) Hits from the CRISPR
  depletion screen were significantly enriched in essential cellular pathways. Top:
