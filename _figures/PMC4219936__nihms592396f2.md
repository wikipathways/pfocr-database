caption: 'Bile acids activate FXR, TGR5 and cell signaling pathways to inhibit CYP7A1
  and CYP8B1 gene transcription. 1) Hepatic FXR/SHP pathway: bile acid activated-FXR
  induces SHP, which inhibits HNF4α and LRH-1 trans-activation of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1
  gene transcription in hepatocytes. Bile acid response element binds HNF4α and LRH-1.
  2) Intestinal FXR/FGF19/FGFR4 pathway: in the intestine, FXR induces FGF15 (mouse)
  /FGF19 (human), which is secreted into portal circulation to activate FGF receptor
  4 (FGFR4) in hepatocytes. FGFR4 signaling stimulates JNK1/2 and ERK1/2 pathways
  of MAPK signaling to inhibit CYP7A1 gene transcription by phosphorylation and inhibition
  of HNF4α binding activity. 3) FXR-independent signaling pathways: Conjugated bile
  acids activate PKCs, which activate the MAPK pathways to inhibit CYP7A1. Bile acids
  also activate insulin receptor (IR) signaling IRS/PI3K/PDK1/AKT, possibly via activation
  of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, MAPKs (MEK, MEKK), to inhibit
  CYP7A1 gene transcription. The secondary bile acid TLCA activates TGR5 signaling
  in Kupffer cells. TGR5 signaling may regulate CYP7A1 by an unknown mechanism. TCA
  activates sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 2 (S1PR2), which may activate AKT
  and ERK1/2 to inhibit CYP7A1. S1P kinase 1 (Sphk1) phosphates sphingosine (Sph)
  to S-1-P, which activates S1PR2. On the other hand, nuclear SphK2 interacts with
  and inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC1/2) and may induce CYP7A1. The role of S1P,
  SphK2, and S1PR2 signaling in regulation of bile acid synthesis is not known.'
