caption: 'Mannose metabolism in Trypanosoma brucei. The parasite is able to take up
  Glc and Man from the environment and transport them into the glycosome. The de novo
  pathway to GDP-Man involves the conversion of Glc to Glc-6P to Fru-6P to Man-6P
  to Man-1P to GDP-Man. The salvage pathway involves the conversion Man to Man-6P
  to Man-1P to GDP-Man. The de novo pathway from Glc to UDP-Galp, via UDP-Glc, is
  also shown. The figure also shows the fate of GDP-Man as the direct donor for the
  synthesis of Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol and as the indirect donor (via Dol-P-Man) to Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol
  Man. These molecules are used in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the parasite
  as donors for the oligosaccharyltransferases of protein N-glycosylation. GDP-Man
  is also used as the indirect donor (via Dol-P-Man) for the synthesis of the ethanolamine-P-Man3GlcN-PI
  GPI anchor precursor. The enzyme abbreviations are: HK, Hexokinase; GPI, Glc-6P
  isomerase; PMI, Phosphomannose isomerase; PMM, Phosphomannomutase; MPGT, GDP-Man
  pyrophosphorylase; UGP, UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase; GalE, UDP-Glc 4′-epimerase.'
