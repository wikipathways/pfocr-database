caption: Model for p53 function in NPC self-renewal and nephrogenesis. (A) Loss of
  self-renewing cells in Six2Cre+;p53fl/fl CM. Cited1+ cells are lost (green circles)
  in Six2Cre+;p53fl/fl CM. A Cited1−/Six2+ domain (gray circles) is present, but with
  defects in organization and integrity loss. Stromal cells (navy blue circles) are
  interspersed in between the Six2+ cap cells. Thus, a distinct CM-stroma and CM-UB
  interface that is present in wild-type kidneys is lost in the Six2-p53-null kidneys.
  Disorganization of the niche would result in impaired signaling and cross-talk between
  the different lineages (denoted by dashed arrows in the Six2Cre+;p53fl/fl CM). (B)
  A physiological change in energy metabolism pathway usage to drive the Cited1+/Six2+
  self-renewing cells (dotted arrow) to Cited1−/Six2+ transit cells (purple energy
  flash sign) in normal development. An untimely change, however, in cellular metabolism
  of p53−/− Cited1+/Six2+ cells (orange energy flash sign) might result in precocious
  arrest of self-renewal and an en masse transition to the Cited1−/Six2+ non-renewing
  state. Adhesion defects could either precede or follow an altered metabolism status,
  resulting in a loose, disorganized CM that is unable to undergo efficient MET.
