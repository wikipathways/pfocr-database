caption: The underlying mechanism of obesity and hyperuricemia. (A) Protein-protein
  interaction (PPI) network obtained from STRING database and constructed by Cytoscape.
  Each node size and color depth are proportional to their node degree. Edge width
  is proportional to the edge betweenness. (B) Grouping of KEGG enrichment analysis
  of the 235 intersected targets of obesity leading to hyperuricemia. Functionally
  related groups partially overlap. KEGG pathway is represented as a node. The nodes
  of a group are labeled in the same color. Two groups share the nodes with two colors
