caption: Pathways regulating intestinal sterol absorption and homeostasis. Dietary/biliary
  cholesterol and other sterols are transported across the brush border principally
  via NPC1L1, a 13-transmembrane domain protein (shown only schematically here) with
  a sterol-sensing domain, that functions possibly in association with CD36. Note
  that the figure illustrates a conformational change in NPC1L1 upon sterol binding.
  NPC1L1 is expressed in subapical domains but not within the brush-border membrane
  and undergoes clathrin-mediated internalization following sterol binding, after
  which the sterol cargo is vectorially delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum for
  esterification via acyl cholesterol acyltransferase-2 (ACAT2). NPC1L1 then recycles
  back in proximity to the brush border. Sitosterol and other sterols are less effective
  substrates for ACAT2 and are preferentially secreted back into the intestinal lumen
  through the paired half-transporters ABCG5/G8. A portion of cytoplasmic intestinal
  free cholesterol is also selectively secreted back into the lumen through ABCG5/G8.
  An alternative pathway has been proposed to account for the portion of intestinal
  cholesterol excretion that operates independently of ABCG5/G8, referred to as transintestinal
  cholesterol efflux (TICE). The transporters involved and the metabolic source of
  cholesterol are unknown. Other apical transporters have been described, including
  SR-B1 and CD-36, but the significance of these two transporters in absorption of
  cholesterol and other sterols is yet to be established. Intestinal cholesterol ester
  (CE) is partitioned into distinct metabolic pools, including a dominant apoB48-dependent
  chylomicron pathway (CM) that requires microsomal triglyceride transfer protein
  (MTTP). Cholesterol, in the form of cholesterol ester (CE), can also be secreted
  via apoA1-dependent pathways, although the quantitative importance of this pathway
  is unknown. The metabolic pool of free cholesterol (FC) arises through de novo synthesis,
  from receptor-dependent lipoprotein uptake and also through mobilization of membrane
  free cholesterol. These pathways are summarized schematically by the dashed arrow.
  Intracellular free cholesterol from any of these sources may also enter the metabolic
  pool from which ACAT2 derives its substrate. In addition, membrane free cholesterol
  may be mobilized, along with phospholipid, through the export pump ABCA1, resulting
  in transfer to an extracellular apoA-I acceptor with the formation of discoidal
  HDL particles that enter the lymphatic circulation.
