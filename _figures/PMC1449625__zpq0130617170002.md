caption: Model of the potential roles of the ENTH domain of Ent1/2p. Clathrin and
  endocytic regulatory proteins (purple), including Ent1/2p (the ENTH domain alone
  is shown), localize to sites of endocytosis where they contribute to membrane deformation
  and curvature. By means of the actions of Arp2/3, actin (green) assembles into an
  actin patch that contributes to membrane invagination. The ENTH domains bind and
  sequester/inhibit Cdc42 GAPs, allowing for local activation of Cdc42. Through a
  Gic1/2/Bni1 pathway, actin cables are assembled that direct secretory vesicle in
  a myosin-dependent manner. Cdc42·GTP can also contribute to actin patch formation
  by signaling to activation of Arp2/3.
