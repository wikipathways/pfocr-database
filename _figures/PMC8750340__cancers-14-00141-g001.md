caption: Engagement of CD47 (i.e.,”don’t eat me” signal) on lymphoma cells with SIRPα
  on macrophages causes activation and phosphorylation of SIRPα ITIM motifs and the
  recruitment of SHP-1 phosphatases (right) preventing myosin-IIA accumulation at
  the phagocytic synapse (left), which results in inhibiting lymphoma cell phagocytosis.
  IgG activates the FcγR receptor on the phagocyte and induces actin cytoskeleton
  assembly. IgG-opsonized target cells lacking CD47 results in binding FcγR, leading
  to activated assembly of paxillin, F-actin, and non-muscle myosin IIA at the phagocytic
  synapse (left). This F-actin assembly is independent of the signaling pathway of
  CD47. In contrast, parallel interactions with CD47 signals through SIRPα to inhibit
  myosin assembly and contraction contribute to efficient phagocytosis (right). αCD47
