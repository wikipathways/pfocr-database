caption: Insulin resistance as trigger of atherothrombosis. In subjects with obesity
  or type 2 diabetes the increase in FFA activates TLR leading NF-kB nuclear translocation
  and subsequent up-regulation of inflammatory genes IL-6 and TNF-α. On the other
  hand, JNK and protein kinase C phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1),
  thus blunting its downstream targets PI3-kinase and Akt. This results in down-regulation
  of glucose transporter GLUT-4 and, hence, insulin resistance. Impaired insulin sensitivity
  in the vascular endothelium leads to increased FFA oxidation, ROS formation, and
  subsequent activation of detrimental biochemical pathways such as AGE synthesis,
  PKC activation, protein glicosylation as well as down-regulation of PGI2. These
  events blunt eNOS activity thereby leading to endothelial dysfunction. Lack of insulin
  signalling in platelets impairs the IRS1/PI3K pathway resulting in Ca2+ accumulation
  and increased platelet aggregation. FFA, free fatty acids; TLR, toll-like receptor;
  JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; IRS-1, Insulin receptor substrate-1; NO, nitric
  oxide; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide shyntase; IL-6, interleukin-6; TNF-α, tumor
  necrosis factor.
