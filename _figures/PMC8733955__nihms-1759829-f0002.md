caption: Multiple nutrients and metabolites facilitate the invasiveness and migratory
  abilities of cancer cells (part a) and their survival in the circulation (part b).
  Differential availability of nutrients and metabolites in the circulation of healthy
  individuals, patients with non-metastatic cancer (primary tumour) or patients with
  metastatic cancer have been reported. In the circulation, increased pyruvate levels
  have been observed in patients with non-metastatic versus metastatic breast cancer
  (BCa) and for patients with multiple types of cancer compared with healthy individuals.
  Increased lactate levels have been observed in patients with metastatic colorectal
  cancer (CRC). Low glutamine and high glutamate levels have been observed in patients
  with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Enhanced lipid levels have been
  observed in patients with colorectal and breast cancer, but not patients with oral
  cancer (part c). Fatty acid metabolism is depicted in light indigo. Lactate and
  pyruvate metabolism are depicted in green. Glutamine metabolism is depicted in dark
  indigo. Acetate metabolism is depicted in indigo. Asparagine metabolism is depicted
  in orange. Proteins whose function is regulated by metabolism pathways are shown
  in light blue. Enzymes depicted in box shape and membrane transporters not coloured
  in beige have been discussed as targets in the main text. Dashed lines indicate
  regulatory events. Multiple metabolic reactions are summarized for clarity reasons.
