caption: Pathway analysis of metabolomics alterations associated with asthma. The
  KEGG database was used to search for each differential metabolites. The illustration
  was generated using the reference maps from KEGG to construct the altered TCA cycle,
  urea cycle and amino acid metabolic pathway in asthmatic patients.
