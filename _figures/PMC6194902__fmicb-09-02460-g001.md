caption: Overview of terpenoids biosynthesis pathway (A), and pathway engineering
  strategies (B,C). Terpenoids biosynthesis is comprised of carbon assimilation, isoprene
  unit synthesis, terpenoids backbone synthesis, and terpenoids decoration. C6 or
  C5 sugar enters the central pathway of glycolysis. MEP and MVA pathways use central
  metabolites to initiate synthesis of IPP and DMAPP, the building blocks of terpenoids.
  Terpenoid synthesis pathways could be assembled and engineered in a tractable host
  (e.g., E. coli or yeasts) to create cell factories for their mass production. Two
  fashions of static and dynamic engineering have been used to optimize the synthesis
  pathways and coordinate them with host metabolic network. Static engineering approach
  generally constructs a matrix of genes, promoters, and regulatory elements (e.g.,
  UTRs) to screen the best orchestra, while dynamic engineering approach relies on
  biosensors (metabolite response or transcription factor-based) to dynamically control
  the synthesis pathway. The red dots present the key intermediates of terpenoid biosynthesis,
  and the yellow and cyan dots present primary terpenenoids and decorated terpenoids,
  respectively (A,B). TF presents transcription factor (C).
