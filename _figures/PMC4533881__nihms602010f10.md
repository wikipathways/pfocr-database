caption: The network is composed of two microenvironmental inputs (pro-growth indicated
  by white triangle and pro-death represented by black triangles), 7 internal nodes
  and two cell phenotypes (pro-growth and pro-death). White arrows indicate stimulation
  or activation, while black arrows represent inhibition or repression.
