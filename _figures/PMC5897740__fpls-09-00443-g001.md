caption: 'Thiamin biosynthesis in plants. Synthesis of pyrimidine and thiazole moieties
  as well as their condensation occurs in plastids. Biosynthesis pathway is shown
  in blue, enzymes in black. Transport across membranes is proposed to be carrier-mediated
  (barrels), of which the identified mitochondrial TPP carrier is indicated (red barrel)
  (). The chemical structure of thiamin is depicted, of which the free hydroxyl group
  can be pyrophosphorylated by action of thiamin pyrophosphokinase (TPK). End product
  feed-back, performed by TPP on the THIC riboswitch, is depicted in red. Products:
  Gly, glycine; NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine;
  AIR, 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide; HET-P, 4-methyl-5-β-hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate;
  HMP-P, 4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate; HMP-PP, HMP-pyrophosphate;
  TMP, thiamin monophosphate; TPP, thiamin pyrophosphate. Enzymes: THIC, HMP-P synthase;
  THI1, HET-P synthase; TH1, HMP-P kinase/TMP pyrophosphorylase; TPK, thiamin pyrophosphokinase;
  TH2, TMP phosphatase, PALE GREEN1.'
