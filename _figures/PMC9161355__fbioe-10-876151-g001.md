caption: The biogenesis and cellular-uptake of extracellular vesicles. Microvesicles
  are released directly from the plasma membrane via outward budding. The biogenesis
  of exosomes follows the endocytic-exocytic pathway, inward budding from the plasma
  membrane to form early endosomes. Late endosomal membrane invagination results in
  the loading of cytosolic proteins/RNAs, which further forms the exosomal precursor–intraluminal
  vesicles (ILVs) in multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Exosomes are then secreted into
  the extracellular space after fusion with the plasma membrane via an ESCRT-dependent
  or ESCRT-independent pathway. Exosomes can be taken up by recipient cells through
  endocytosis, direct fusion, or binding to surface proteins, causing the transfer
  of oncogenic cargoes, and changing the biological behaviors of recipient cells.
  A multitude of non-coding RNA species (e.g., miRNAs, circRNAs, lncRNAs) are contained
  in exosome. The roles of exosomes in ovarian cancer are also shown. ESCRT, endosomal
  sorting complex required for transport; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; miRNA,
  microRNA; circRNA, circular RNA; lncRNA, long non-coding RNA.
