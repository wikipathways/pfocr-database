caption: Figure 5. Graphic illustration of a lignocellulose conversion to biodiesel
  in a single microbe by consolidated bioprocess (CBP). The enzymatic hydrolysis of
  the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions to fermentable hexoses and pentoses requires
  the production of both cellulases and hemicellulases (dashed lines). The subsequent
  conversion of the hexoses and pentoses to biodiesel initiated by the modifying fatty
  acids pathways, introducing ethanol producing pathway and overexpressing acyltransferase.
  FFA, fatty acid synthesis; WS/DGAT, acyltransferase for fatty acid esters synthesis;
  EtOH, ethanol producing pathway.
