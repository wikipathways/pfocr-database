caption: Targetable metabolic pathways and inhibitors in NSCLC.This schematic highlights
  key metabolic pathways reprogrammed in NSCLC cells and outlines current therapeutic
  targets under investigation. Central carbon metabolism—including glycolysis, the
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), TCA cycle, and OXPHOS—is regulated by oncogenic
  signaling pathways such as PI3K/mTOR and MAPK/ERK, often activated by mutations
  in receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR, ALK, MET). Metabolic enzymes (e.g., HK2, PFKFB3,
  LDHA, PHGDH, PKM2, ACLY, FASN, SCD, GLS1) and transporters (e.g., SLC1A5/SLC7A5)
  are shown with corresponding small-molecule inhibitors (e.g., 2-DG, BAY-876, PFK158,
  Oxamate, PX-478, CB-839, TVB2640, MF-438, JPH203), many of which are being evaluated
  in preclinical or clinical settings. The diagram also illustrates amino acid metabolism
  (e.g., glutaminolysis, serine biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism), emphasizing
  the metabolic plasticity of NSCLC and the opportunities for combinatorial metabolic
  interventions. This comprehensive map provides a framework for rational design of
  therapies targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in NSCLC
