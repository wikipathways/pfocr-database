caption: Interleukin (IL)-6 signals through a receptor composed of a 130-kDa (gp130)
  protein subunit. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor initiates cellular events, including
  activation of Janus kinases (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription
  (STAT). JAK inhibitors interfere with JAK/STAT signalling. Tofacitinib is a JAK
  inhibitor approved recently by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment
  of RA. Phosphorylated STAT-3 forms a dimer and translocates into the nucleus to
  activate the transcription of genes containing STAT response elements. STAT is essential
  for gp130-mediated cell survival. This signalling pathway induces B cells to differentiate
  into antibody-forming cells (plasma cells).
