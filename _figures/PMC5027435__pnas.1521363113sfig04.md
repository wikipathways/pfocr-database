caption: Proposed model. BIN2, an important negative regulator in the BR signaling
  pathway, is regulated by upstream BR signals through phosphorylation. Phosphorylated
  and acetylated BIN2 has higher activity to phosphorylate the downstream transcription
  factors BES1 and BZR1 to inhibit BR signaling. Under energy-limited conditions,
  HDA6 interacts with BIN2 and deacetylates BIN2 on the K189 site to inhibit BIN2
  activity and promote BR signaling. The expression of HDA6 can be feedback-inhibited,
  likely through BES1- and BZR1-mediated transcription regulation. HDA6 may also interact
  with BES1 to regulate its transcription activity.
