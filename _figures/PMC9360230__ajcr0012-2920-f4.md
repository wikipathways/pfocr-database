caption: HER2 is a cancer-causing gene with four membrane tyrosine kinase receptors
  (HER1-HER4), a molecular switch, and more than ten ligands. Ligand binding causes
  a conformational change in HER1, HER3, and HER4 that facilitates homo- or heterodimerization
  with another family member. HER2, which is gene-amplified and/or overexpressed in
  20% of breast cancers, lacks a ligand and lies in an open conformation in the membrane.
  Due to its heterodimerization capability and increased expression, HER2 activates
  itself by homodimerizing with other ligand-bound HER members. In response to dimerization
  of the HER receptors, their TKs are activated. This initiates a phosphorylation
  cascade, which triggers downstream signaling pathways, including Ras/p42/44 MAPK
  and PI3K/AKT. By modifying and phosphorylating transcription factors and other parts
  of the transcription and cell-cycle machinery, downstream kinases stimulate the
  transcriptional and cell-cycle machinery. As a result, tumor cells can be stimulated
  to proliferate, survive, become angiogenic, and metastatic. Because HER3’s TK is
  inactive (X), the downstream signaling pathway can only be activated by heterodimerization
  with other HER members. According to the FDA, the HER2-targeted drugs approved for
  treating HER2+ breast cancer are trastuzumab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab DMT-1, and
  lapatinib.
