caption: After uptake through glucose transporters (GLUTs), glucose is phosphorylated
  by hexokinase (HK) to glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P), which undergoes a series of
  enzymatic reactions of hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) to form UDP-GlcNAc.
  Carbons of glucose may also be shunted to other metabolic pathways. As a key sugar
  derivative, UDP-GlcNAc may be used for various glycosylations. UDP-GlcNAc is a substrate
  for O-GlcNAcylation, a prominent post-translational protein modification on serine
  or threonine sites. Cardiac stress like ischemia, pressure overload, and diabetes
  leads to activation of HBP and O-GlcNAcylation. While acute elevation of HBP by
  ischemia confers cardioprotection, chronic activation of hexosamine biosynthesis
  by sustained pressure overload and uncontrolled hyperglycemia in diabetes causes
  cardiomyopathy. PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; GPI, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase;
  GFAT, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase; Fruc-6-P, fructose-6-phospate;
  GlcN-6-P, glucosamine-6-phosphate; UDP-GlcNAc, uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine;
  OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase; OGA, O-GlcNAcase.
