caption: (left) On pro-integrin clustering surfaces, which could be either smooth
  or composed of certain nanotopographical features, integrins could undergo free
  lateral recruitment and ligation with ECM proteins, and thus cluster and form mature,
  stable FAs together with the unhindered recruitment of FA adaptor proteins. This
  process initiates signals from plasma membrane, enhancing FAK/ERK signaling, as
  well as RhoA activity, which further promoting CSK contractility (through RhoA/ROCK)
  as well as stress fiber formation. CSK contractility, as an important mediator of
  mechanotransduction, could provide positive feedback to the FAs. In addition, CSK
  force could also induce phosphorylation of emerin, a nuclear envelope-located protein,
  and thus initiate nuclear mechanotransduction through enhanced nuclear actin polymerization
  and subsequent nuclear translocation of MAL, a transcription cofactor of SRF. In
  the meantime, prominent stress fibers formed in cells on smooth surfaces could promote
  the nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ, a transcription co-factor of TEAD. Nuclear
  shuttling of SMAD 2/3 (R-SMAD), the transcription factor downstream of TGFβ signaling,
  is also controlled by YAP/TAZ translocation. (right) On surfaces containing anti-integrin
  clustering nanotopographical cues, although integrins could still freely diffuse
  laterally, the nanoscale surface features restrict the ligation of additional integrins
  to the ECM proteins, which further restrict successful recruitment and clustering
  of integrins and other FA proteins, resulting in smaller, less stable FAs. Such
  process disrupts the activation of RhoA and therefore limits the formation of stress
  fibers and might induce high cytoplasmic G-actin level, which inhibits the nuclear
  translocation of MAL and thus SRF signaling. Unlike nanotopographical surfaces that
  promote integrin clustering, anti-integrin clustering surfaces containing different
  types of nanoscale structures could not sustain FAK activation and downstream signaling.
  Last but not the least, compromised stress fibers and FAs on nanotopographical substrates
  could potentially intersect with Hippo/YAP pathway by enhancing YAP/TAZ phosphorylation
  via either Lats-dependent or –independent mechanisms, resulting in cytoplasmic retention
  of YAP/TAZ.
