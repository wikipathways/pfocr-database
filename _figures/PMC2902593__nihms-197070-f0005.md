caption: 'Model for potential functions of intracellular peptides. Top: Classical
  neuropeptides are produced within the secretory pathway by the selective processing
  of precursor proteins in the late Golgi and secretory vesicles by endopeptidases
  (prohormone convertases 1/3 and 2) and carboxypeptidase E., Following synthesis,
  peptides are stored in secretory vesicles and then secreted in a regulated fashion.
  Secreted peptides can interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) located
  on adjacent cells, and are degraded by extracellular peptidases. Middle: The term
  “non-classical neuropeptide” is used to refer to peptides that are formed within
  the cytosol or other intracellular compartments and are secreted via an unknown
  mechanism where they can interact with GPCRs or other targets (enzymes, etc) on
  a nearby cell. In this proposed mechanism, signaling does not have to proceed from
  presynaptic to postsynaptic but can also occur in a retrograde fashion (similar
  to the signaling of non-classical neurotransmitters like NO and anandamide). The
  enzymes that produce the bioactive peptides are not known; candidates include proteasomes,
  calpains, caspases, and other intracellular proteases. Bottom: Intracellular peptides
  may also function by binding to proteins and either activating them (i.e. mimicking
  a protein-protein interaction) or blocking them (i.e. inhibiting a protein-protein
  interaction). This potential function is termed “microprotein” by analogy with microRNA.
  In addition to the intracellular proteases that cleave proteins into peptides, there
  are several peptidases within cells that further process peptides into smaller ones;
  these enzymes include thimet oligopeptidase (also known as endopeptidase 24.15),
  neurolysin (endopeptidase 24.16), insulin-degrading enzyme, and prolyl oligopeptidase.
  Degradation of cysolic peptides occurs via aminopeptidases and possibly via carboxypeptidases.'
