caption: The development of dendritic cells (DCs) from progenitor cells is associated
  with mitochondrial biogenesis, which is driven by peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-γ (PPARγ) co-activator 1α (PGC1α) and promoted by PPARγ, mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) and MYC. Differentiated DCs populate their niches as immature
  DCs. Immature DCs use fatty acid oxidation as a core metabolic process. Activation
  of DCs by Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists leads to a rapid increase in flux through
  glycolysis and the associated pentose phosphate pathway, with an accompanying increase
  in spare respiratory capacity and fatty acid synthesis. These metabolic changes
  are initiated by a pathway downstream of TLRs that involves AKT, TANK-binding kinase
  1 (TBK1), inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB kinase subunit-ε (IKKε) and hexokinase
  2 (HK2), and they are crucial for DC activation. After being activated, DCs remain
  glycolytic. This process is essential for continued DC survival and is controlled
  by mTOR and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). CDP, committed DC progenitor; OXPHOS,
  oxidative phosphorylation.
