caption: A model for the effect of JCAD CAD risk genotype on the Hippo signaling pathway.
  The Hippo signaling pathway consists of a core kinase cascade comprising MST1/2
  and LATS1/2 and is regulated by multiple extracellular signals. Our data suggests
  that JCAD acts downstream of RhoA to inhibit LATS2. We propose that in individuals
  with the non-risk genotype, lower JCAD expression results in more active LATS1/LATS2,
  increased phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ and its exclusion from the nucleus. Conversely,
  in individuals with the risk genotype, higher JCAD expression results in lower LATS1/2
  activity, reduced YAP/TAZ phosphorylation and more active nuclear YAP, resulting
  in increased expression of pro-proliferative, anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory
  genes, promoting endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis.
