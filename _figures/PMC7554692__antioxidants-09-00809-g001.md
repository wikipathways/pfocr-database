caption: A schematic model explaining the mechanism underlying the melatonin-mediated
  drought stress response. At the cellular level, a stress signal from the cell membrane
  is received by the nucleus, which starts to activate the melatonin biosynthesis
  pathway from its precursor, tryptophan, in mitochondria and chloroplasts by upregulating
  the melatonin-biosynthesis genes. Melatonin sends its feedback on such stress to
  the nucleus to activate omics regulation. Consequently, the genes encoding the proteins
  related to plant anatomical, physiological, and biochemical responses are regulated
  directly and/or indirectly via a simultaneous defense network. The omics-mediated
  responses include photosynthesis, biosynthesis, enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants,
  photoprotection, cell membrane stability, ROS and oxidative damage, osmoprotection,
  water status, and leaf senescence, in addition to the anatomical changes, which
  lead to drought tolerance. Consequently, the whole plant status is enhanced, including
  growth and development, flowering, yield, quality, and survival rate, while the
  toxic substances are decreased.
