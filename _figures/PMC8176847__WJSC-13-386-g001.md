caption: 'Mechanisms of intrinsic apoptotic pathways in stem cells. Cell stress from
  various damage causes a rapid response leading to apoptosis via BH3-only activator
  (Way I) or active Bax directly from the Golgi (Way II) to the mitochondria, which
  subsequently induces a co-pathway [MOMP, cytochrome C (cyt C) releasing, etc.].
  I: Stress inducers, such as DNA damage could stabilize and activate p53, which leads
  to p53 nuclear translocation. Subsequently, p53 exerts an impact on transcription
  of apoptotic genes via DNA-binding activity and its transcriptional activity (e.g.,
  PUMA, NOXA, and Bax); II: Bax, which is monomeric in the cytoplasm, could be activated
  via stabilized p53 and active-Bax translocates from the Golgi to the mitochondrion.
  Once instigated with the apoptotic signals, active-Bax could lead to the alteration
  of MOMP, which undergoes dimerization and transfers to the OMM, so that relevant
  proteins (such as cyt C) are released into the cytosol usually confined in the intermembrane
  space. The released cyt C is involved in apoptosome formation via binding to the
  cytosolic Apaf-1. This complex recruits and activates initiator pro-casp-9, and
  then act-casp-9 activates downstream executor casp-3/-6/-7, leading to apoptotic
  cell death. In the cytoplasm, IAP antagonists (e.g., SMAC, ARTS, and HTRA2) could
  bind and suppress XIAP, causing the activation of casp-9 for the apoptotic pathway.
  The T-shaped lines indicate inhibitory interactions involved in this pathway, while
  the solid arrows indicate activating interactions. Bax: Apoptosis regulator Bcl-2
  associated X protein; OMM: Outer membrane permeabilization; MOMP: Mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization, cyt C: Cytochrome C; PUMA: p53 upregulated modulator
  of apoptosis, NOXA: Pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, also known as PMAIP1, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced
