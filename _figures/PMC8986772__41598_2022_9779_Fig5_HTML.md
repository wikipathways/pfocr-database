caption: Model effects of DNA damage and repair on EGFR signaling and cellular response.
  (A) Under homeostatic conditions binding of ligand to EGFR induces canonical signals
  supporting cell proliferation and survival. (B) Upon induction of DNA damage, the
  MRN complex is assembled around sites of DSBs leading to a decrease in Mig-6 expression
  and amplifies ligand-induced EGFR signaling. In turn, amplified EGFR signaling enhances
  DDR-induced p53 pathway and cell cycle arrest and facilitates DSBs rejoining. Images
  created using BioRender.
