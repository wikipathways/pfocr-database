caption: 'A proposed mechanism of CD4+ T cell priming after Leishmania major infection.
  Infectious metacyclic promastigotes are introduced into the dermis of the host by
  the bite of a sandfly or through needle inoculation. The promastigotes are taken
  up by skin dermal macrophages, within which the parasite can replicate in the form
  of amastigotes. Amastigotes released from ruptured macrophages can infect nearby
  dermal DCs, which results in the activation of dermal DCs and release of factors
  such as IL-1 and IL-12. In the case of needle injection of a large number of promastigotes
  (105–107), the promastigotes can be taken up by the dermal DCs and processed for
  MHC class II presentation. Either the amastigote-infected dermal DCs (following
  sandfly bite) or promastigote-loaded dermal DCs (after needle injection of >105
  parasite) migrate to the draining LNs and enter the T cell area to present parasite
  antigens to CD4+ T cells in the context of MHC class II (reference ). Langerhans
  cells infected with the parasite may also migrate to the draining LNs but whether
  they present parasite antigens and induce CD4+ T cell activation needs to be further
  elucidated. IL-1 secreted from the DCs promotes Th1 differentiation of the antigen-specific
  T cells in several mutually nonexclusive ways: (a) IL-1 may facilitate the migration
  of dermal DCs from the site of infection to the draining LNs (reference ), (b) IL-1
  may induce activation of DCs through signaling of their IL-1RI/IL-1RAcP complex
  via the MyD88 pathway, and (c) IL-1 may directly activate CD4+ T cells leading to
  their Th1 differentiation. Signaling of IL-1RI on DCs may lead to increase in the
  expression levels of costimulatory molecules and release of cytokines such as IL-12
  and IL-18. Alternatively, a separate microbial stimulus present on Leishmania parasite
  may trigger the secretion of IL-12, which is enhanced by the concomitant IL-1 signaling.
  In the resistant strains, this IL-1 production from DCs is optimal, leading to the
  activation of CD4+ T cells to secrete IFN-γ (references  and ). In contrast, IL-1
  secretion from DCs is reduced in the susceptible strains, leading to suboptimal
  DC activation and Th2 differentiation (references  and ). Factors other than IL-1
  likely also contribute to the intrinsic differences between the CD11b+ DCs of the
  susceptible and the resistant strains, such as differences in the expression of
  costimulatory molecules (reference ), other cytokines, chemokine/chemokine receptors,
  and perhaps TLRs.'
