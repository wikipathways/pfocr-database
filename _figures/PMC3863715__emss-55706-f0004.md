caption: The appearance of ssDNA breaks involves the BER pathway components (APE1,
  XRCC1 and PARP1) in the process of DNA demethylation. Several molecular pathways
  can lead to the activation of BER in the course of DNA demethylation. 5mC could
  be subject to a chemical modification such as cytosine deamination although we did
  not detect expression of known candidate enzyme. Alternatively, 5mC may be converted
  to 5hmC by tet1 or other such enzymes that are expressed in PGCs, which would trigger
  a response from glycosylases. Alternatively, 5mC specific glycosylases, which have
  been identified in plants may have equivalents in mammals but none have yet been
  found. Note the temporal connections between DNA demethylation, appearance of ssDNA
  breaks and the activation of BER and the chromatin remodelling observed in PGCs.
