caption: After entry of ciglitazone into the cell (purple arrow), it increases DR4/DR5
  as well as TRAIL expression (blue arrow) leading to the activation of the caspase
  cascade and thus to apoptosis (green arrow). Extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways
  are interconnected by the caspase 8-mediated cleavage of Bid (tBid, truncated Bid)
  induced by ciglitazone. The thiazolidinedione decreases HPV16 E6 viral oncoprotein
  (red arrow) reported to block TRAIL pathway (refs. 62, 63, red dotted arrow). Ciglitazone
  sensitizes tumour cells to TRAIL-dependent cell death through the downregulation
  of the caspase 8 inhibitor c-FLIP (red arrow).
