caption: A schematic diagram of potential causes of hyperkalemia in neonates exposed
  to ritodrine and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4). Ritodrine crosses the placenta, inducing
  insulin secretion from the fetal pancreas and glucose from the fetal liver. This
  activates the glycolytic pathway and citric acid cycle in fetal cells, enhancing
  ATP synthesis. MgSO4 also crosses the placenta, increasing intracellular magnesium
  and promoting glucose uptake, further enhancing glycolysis. This results in elevated
  citric acid and ATP levels, with increased ATP facilitating extracellular potassium
  uptake into cells. After delivery, the discontinuation of ritodrine and MgSO4 reduces
  the fetal blood levels of insulin, glucose, and magnesium, causing potassium efflux
  from the cells. As a result, this leads to rebound hyperkalemia in the newborn
