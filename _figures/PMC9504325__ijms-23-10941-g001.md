caption: H. pylori infection and host antimicrobial response. H. pylori attach to
  host cells surface via bacterial outer membrane proteins (OMPs such as BabA, SabA,
  OipA, et al.) interacting with ligands (Lewis et al. blood group antigen) on cell
  surface. Once attached, the bacterial type IV secretion system (T4SS) delivers a
  variety of virulence factors into host cell. The translocated CagA is phosphorylated
  by c-Src and c-Abl on the inner face of plasma membrane, leading to the change of
  numerous cellular signaling pathways. Specifically, CagA can activate mTORC1 to
  enhance cathelicidin/LL-37 expression. Meanwhile, T4SS-dependent internalization
  of bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) can activate NOD1 pathway to induce hBD-2/β-defensin
  expression. The attached bacteria induce cellular endocytosis wherein they are surrounded
  by the double-membrane structure autophagosome. The autophagosome would then fuse
  with lysosome to form autolysosome, resulting in bacteria degradation by lysosomal
  hydrolytic enzymes. However, H. pylori could secrete cytotoxin VacA to impair autophagic
  flux and lysosomal function by inhibiting TRPML1-mediated outflow of Ca2+ on lysosome
  and suppressing the activity of cathepsin D (CTSD), respectively. Bacterial products
  can bind to TLRs (Toll-like receptors) to activate NF-κB signaling, resulting in
  induction of NOX and iNOS and subsequent ROS and RNS generation to kill H. pylori.
  The autophagosome membrane-located NOX and iNOS are also involved in the clearance
  of intracellular H. pylori. Nevertheless, H. pylori could produce SOD and catalase
  to attenuate ROS damage. Moreover, the release of bacterial arginase can eliminate
  RNS to protect H. pylori.
