caption: Heterogeneous responses of normal and malignant B cells upon CpG ODNs stimulation.
  Activation of TLR9 results in the recruitment of MyD88 to initiate the activation
  of NF-κB, JNK, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Arrows represent activation. Bars
  represent inhibition. Activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway exerts both antiapoptotic
  and proapoptotic effects. In normal B cells (black lines), activation of NF-κB upregulates
  the expression of BCL-XL, which blocks cytochrome c release and protects B cells
  from apoptosis. However, upon treatment of the mouse B-cell lymphoma cell line CH27
  with CpG ODNs, overexpression of c-Myc results in transient activation of NF-κB
  and subsequent inhibition of NF-κB activation (red bar). And then, c-Myc promotes
  tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis by decreasing BCL-XL expression and increasing
  FAS expression. In MM cells (purple lines), NF-κB is involved in the activation
  of Ras-dependent MAPK cascades and the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, which is associated
  with the proliferation of processed IL-6. In B-CLL cells (blue lines), activation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway induces autocrine IL-10 secretion, which further
  induces phosphorylation and activation of the signal transducer and activator of
  transcription 1, resulting in the cleavage and activation of caspases as well as
  the subsequent apoptosis of B-CLL cells (MyD88 myeloid differentiation antigen 88,
  IFN interferon, CLL chronic lymphocytic leukemia, MM multiple myeloma, MAPK mitogen-activated
  protein kinases, PI3K phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, DR5 death receptor 5, TRAIL
  TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, STAT1 signal transducer and activator of
  transcription 1)
