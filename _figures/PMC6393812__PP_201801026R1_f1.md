caption: Carotenoid biosynthesis and branching pathways. The methylerythritol phosphate
  pathway (MEP) produces IPP and its isomer DMAPP which is condensed into geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate (GGPP) in plastids by GGPP synthase (GGPS). GGPS11 is the most abundant
  among the six plastid-localized GGPS isoforms. GGPP is metabolized into plastoquinones
  via solanesyl-diphosphate synthase (SPS), into gibberellins via ent-copalyl diphosphate
  synthase (CPS), and into phythyl-diphosphate via geranylgeranyl reductase (GGR),
  which represents a precursor for chlorophyll and tocopherols. Phytoene synthase
  (PSY) is the first enzyme of the carotenoid pathway producing colorless phytoene,
  which is subsequently converted into red-colored lycopene and orange-colored β-carotene.
  Lycopene synthesis requiring four enzymes in plants is carried out by the enzyme
  CrtI in bacteria. In this work, we employed a translational fusion between GGPS11
  and PSY in order to direct isoprenoid pathway flux into carotenoid biosynthesis.
