caption: Model of our findings. HDAC3 regulated TNF-α-triggered apoptosis in the ERα-positive
  MCF-7 human breast cancer cells via the activation of the p53 signaling pathway.
  The HDAC3–ERα heterocomplex was formed, occupying the p53-binding site of the p21
  promoter, thus blocking its mRNA expression. TNF-α treatment led to the dissociation
  of the HDAC3–ERα complex. P53 bound to p300 and stabilized it through acetylation
  modification; subsequently, the acetylated-p53–p300 complex replaced the HDAC3–ERα
  complex at the p53-binding site of the p21 promoter, thus enhancing the transcriptional
  activity of p21.
