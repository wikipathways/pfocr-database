caption: Each row represents a simulated individual with a heterogeneous presentation
  of risk factors related to lung function. Case 1 (top row) represents an individual
  with good lung function (pink lung tissue) and genomic and environmental components
  consistent with healthy lung function (grey to red nodes). These have a neutral
  to positive influence on lung function represented by the grey and red edges (arrow),
  respectively. Case 2 has high fasting glucose and neutral (grey) loading of genetic
  variants (pharmagenic enrichment score [PES]) associated with lung function pathways.
  After treatment with antihyperglycaemic agents, or some other intervention to lower
  blood glucose, lung function is improved (red edge) sufficiently for therapeutic
  effect, represented by pink lungs. Case 3 has enrichment of genetic variants (PES)
  associated with poorer lung function in the class b2 secretin pathway. To improve
  lung function, they are treated with drugs, such as pramlintide (which targets RAMP1,
  RAMP2, and RAMP3) and exenatide (GLP1R agonist), which works by modulating genes
  in the class b2 secretin pathway to ameliorate the enrichment of poor lung function
  variants in that pathway. The broken edge between fasting glucose and the class
  b2 secretin pathway represents the probable connection or shared genes between these
  nodes as receptors in this pathway are involved in glycaemic regulation. Case 4
  also presents with poor lung function (blue lung tissue) and enrichment of poor
  lung function-associated variants in the circadian clock pathway (blue node). This
  individual’s lung function was then treated by compounds, such as doconexent, which
  act on the circadian clock pathway. This schematic is only representative of many
  thousands of treatment scenarios potentially informed by this treatment decision
  tool, which could be applied to any phenotype with large genome-wide association
  studies available.
