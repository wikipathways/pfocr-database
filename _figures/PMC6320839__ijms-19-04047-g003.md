caption: 'Interplay between the HD-Zip III protein PHB and CKs in the regulation of
  root meristem size. DIC image of the Arabidopsis root tip with different developmental
  zones indicated, stem cell niche (SCN), proximal meristem (PM), transition zone
  (TZ), and elongation and differentiation zone (EDZ), together with a schematic representation
  of the molecular interactions involved in the determination of RAM size. PHB induces
  CK biosynthesis in the PM of the root; cytokinin is delivered to the transition
  zone where activates ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR) 1. ARR1 represses the
  expression of PHB at the TZ, thus restricting PHB expression to the distal part
  of the PM. Remarkably, ARR1 also represses the transcription of MIR165A []. In addition,
  ARR1 induces the expression of SHY2, a CK primary target necessary and sufficient
  to promote cell differentiation at the TZ. White arrowhead indicates the TZ of the
  cortex tissue, placed at the boundary between the last meristematic cell and the
  first differentiating cell []. A color code has been used to indicate different
  pathways: CK pathway, red; IAA pathway, green; PHB/miR165, blue. Scale bar, 20 μm.'
