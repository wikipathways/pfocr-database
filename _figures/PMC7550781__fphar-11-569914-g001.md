caption: This figure shows a simplified overview of nitric oxide (NO) pathway with
  most of the molecular steps. The substrate for nitric oxide synthases, the amino-acid
  L-arginine can enter into three main metabolic pathways. It is either used by arginase,
  producing urea, and L-ornithine or used by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) to produce
  NO or methylated, producing methylated L-arginines, which being a false substrate
  inhibit NOS. Other metabolic pathways are connected that are modifying the level
  of NO or affected by NO.
