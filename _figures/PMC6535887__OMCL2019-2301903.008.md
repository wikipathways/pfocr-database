caption: TNFα-mediated necroptosis aggravates IRI in the fatty liver by regulating
  the inflammatory response. Macrophages were activated during IRI, which secreted
  more TNFα in the fatty liver compared with the normal liver. Necroptosis induced
  by TNFα was activated in NAFLD, leading to more severe IRI. Necroptosis promoted
  the production of DAMPs, which increased signaling pathways of inflammation and
  the soakage of inflammation cells to aggravate IRI. Inhibition of necroptosis with
  Nec-1 and GSK′872 could decrease the signaling pathway of inflammation and ROS production
  to protect the liver from IRI.
