caption: Tamoxifen modulation of membrane and nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) signaling.
  Transduction of the extracellular environment occurs at the cell membrane. This
  is mediated by transforming growth factor-β1 receptor (TGFβ-R), integrin linked
  kinase (ILK), caveolin ion channels and membrane bound receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs), for example, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In the TGF-β1 canonical
  pathway, TGF-β1 first binds to TβR-II, and then the recruitment of TβR-I occurs.
  Both receptors then form the TβR complex, in which TβR-II phosphorylates and activates
  TβR-I. The active TβR-I then phosphorylates SMAD2/3. This results in the cytoplasmic
  retention of p-SMAD2/3 and association with SMAD4. The resulting SMAD complex is
  translocated to the nucleus and activates SMAD-dependent transcriptional activity.
  SMAD7 decreases the stability and activity of TβR-I by inducing receptor degradation.
  SMAD7 also competes with SMAD4 to associate with SMAD 2/3. Tamoxifen blocks canonical
  TGF-β1 signaling by inhibiting SMAD2/3 and promoting SMAD7 (red blockade arrows).
  The activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src occurs via the phosphorylation
  of membrane bound RTKs, including estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α). There is a reciprocal
  phosphorylation of Src, ER-α and RTKs—this is dependent, in part, on the tissue
  levels of tamoxifen and the expression levels of membrane ER-α. Estrogen, tamoxifen
  and fulvestrant are agonists of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER-1).
  Estrogen regulates Hippo signaling via GPER in breast cancer by phospholipase C
  (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC), Yes associated protein (YAP), and transcriptional
  coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). In ER-α negative breast cancers, GPER
  activation turns on the Hippo pathway, causing the phosphorylation of YAP and the
  cytoplasmic retention of pYAP, which is then marked for proteosomal degradation.
  However, when the Hippo pathway is turned off (for example by aberrant Src activation),
  unphosphorylated YAP is able to be translocated to the nucleus and activate transcription
  targets. Estrogen receptors also influence non-canonical TGF-β1 signaling via PI3K
  (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and Akt (Protein Kinase B) pathways. Tamoxifen can
  act as an ER-α antagonist in some tissues (breast) and an ER-α agonist in others
  (endometrium, osteoblasts, endothelium), hence its pleiotropic effects. It is thus
  classified as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) [,].
