caption: 'Reciprocal impact of cancer cell metabolism on TME. (A) Oxidative Stress
  and TME. TAM: ROS signaling promotes M2 polarization through the ERK signaling pathway;
  TIL: TIL activation (differentiation in CD4+, CD8+ T cells) and expansion increase
  rates of glycolysis and generate excessive amount of glycerol-3-phosphate. G3P is
  oxidized by the mitochondrial G3P dehydrogenase 2, which in turn increases ROS production;
  CAF: ROS promote CAF activation and conversion of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts
  through TGF-β and CXCL12 (SDF-1)-dependent pathways. (B) Nutrient availability and
  TME. Both immune and stromal cells participate in a complex metabolic interplay
  with neoplastic cells. They can collectively adapt in a dynamic manner to the metabolic
  needs of cancer cells and thus participate in tumorigenesis. Metabolic competition
  between immune and tumor cells: Tumor cell metabolism modulates nutrient availability
  in TME, impacting macrophage polarization and immune response. High nutrient availability
  in the TME favors glycolysis through mTOR signaling and promotes M1 polarization
  and Teff differentiation. mTORC1 is involved in naïve CD4+ T-cell differentiation
  into T helper 1 (TH1) and T helper 17 (TH17) cells, supporting an antitumor effect.
  In contrast, mTORC2 promotes the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into the
  protumorigenic T helper 2 (TH2) cells. Moreover, M2 macrophages exhibit an OXPHOS
  metabolism. Interestingly, blocking OXPHOS metabolism induces M1 polarization, while
  forcing OXPHOS metabolism in M1 macrophages potentiates M2 polarization. Glutamine
  deprivation promotes the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into FOXP3+ Treg
  cells and thus induces a shift in the immune response balance, which becomes immunosuppressive.
  Glutamine deprivation also impacts M2 phenotype by promoting a protumorigenic response.
  Moreover, glucose availability is also another layer of TIL regulation. As progressing
  tumors have higher glucose consumption than the regressing ones, TILs from progressing
  tumors are glucose restricted and exhibit impaired effector functions. Blocking
  PD-L1 in tumor cells reduces their glycolysis rates by inhibiting mTOR activity,
  which consequently increases extracellular glucose availability for TILs. Thus,
  by modulating tumor cell metabolism, one can control nutrient availability for T
  cells, thus promoting either their antitumor or immunosuppressive functions. Metabolic
  symbiosis between CAFs and tumor cells: Increased ROS production by cancer cells,
  in particular the highly diffusible H2O2, stimulates HIF-1 signaling in CAFs. As
  a consequence, CAFs switch their metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis, through an
  HIF-1- and oxidative stress-dependent mechanism. This highly glycolytic rate in
  CAFs provides nutrient and energetic fuels, such as lactate and ketone bodies, to
  cancer cells. This symbiotic relationship between CAFs and tumor cells is reversible,
  thus representing a metabolic optimization in cancer treatments. CAF, carcinoma-associated
