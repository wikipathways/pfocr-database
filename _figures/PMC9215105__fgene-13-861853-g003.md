caption: Four major KEGG pathways. (A) Phosphatidylinositol signaling system. (B)
  Hippo signaling pathway–multiple species. (C) Hippo signaling pathway. (D) Wnt signaling
  pathway. The colors in the graph from red to green indicate the change from high
  to low in m6A dysregulation on genes. The colors in the graph from yellow to blue
  indicate the change from high to low in m6A dysregulation on compounds.
