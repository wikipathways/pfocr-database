caption: (A) Strategy of microarray analyses. CL and Mat tissues were dissected from
  Med1 KO and CON mice at 4 wk and 10 wk. Array 1 calculated fold changes in CL/Mat
  in control mice revealed genes that are enriched in CL compared to the Mat stage,
  which are DE-SC signature candidates. Array 2 calculated fold changes in KO/CON
  at CL shows genes up-or down-regulated in Med1 KO compared with CON. Arrays were
  performed on RNA samples from Med1 KO and CON. (B) These analyses revealed a list
  of DE-SC signatures affected in the CL of Med1 KO in comparison with gene pools
  identified through other stem cells of ESC or HF-SC. Green letters show down-regulation,
  and the red letters indicate up-regulation. Fold increases and other details are
  listed in  (10 wk). (C, D) The IPA pathway analysis predicted that Notch1 (C) and
  calcium (D) are potential upstream regulators to cause these changes in Med1 KO.
  The sub-cellular location and the up- and down-regulation of genes are shown by
  red and green, respectively. (E) The protein expressions of Notch1 at 4 wk are shown
  in CL of Med1 KO and CON.
