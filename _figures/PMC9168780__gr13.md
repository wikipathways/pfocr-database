caption: Various roles of H2S in the stimulation of angiogenesis. H2S can stimulate
  intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in endothelial cells, which stimulates eNOS via
  the calcium-calmodulin system. H2S can activate PI3K/Akt pathway resulting in eNOS
  activation through phosphorylation at Ser1177. H2S can also induce a direct posttranslational
  modification of eNOS via sulfhydration on Cys443. This action, in turn, can further
  activate and stabilizes eNOS by promoting its dimerization. H2S can also stimulate
  the expression of eNOS mRNA, increasing eNOS protein levels. Further downstream,
  NO produced by eNOS binds to soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and induces the formation
  of cGMP. H2S can inhibit PDE, suppressing the degradation of cGMP and increasing
  cGMP levels enhancing the activation of its downstream protein kinase, PKG. H2S
  can open KATP channels on the endothelial cell membrane. H2S can upregulate VEGF
  and its receptor through HI–F1α upregulation but also through Flt induction. H2S
  can stimulate angiopoietin/tie system, possibly via the upregulation of Ang1, Ang2
  and Tie. H2S can also stimulate various endothelial cell receptors with pro-angiogenic
  roles, including VEGFR, CXCR1 and VCAM.
