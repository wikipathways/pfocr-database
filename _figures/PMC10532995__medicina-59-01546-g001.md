caption: This diagram illustrates the vital roles of RANKL/RANK, Jagged1/Notch1, and
  Wnt/β-catenin pathways in preserving bone health, maintaining bone homeostasis,
  and regulating bone mineral density (BMD). Although each pathway operates autonomously,
  they intricately interact to collectively oversee the multifaceted process of bone
  remodeling. By interconnecting, these pathways ensure the perpetual renewal and
  durability of bone tissue.
