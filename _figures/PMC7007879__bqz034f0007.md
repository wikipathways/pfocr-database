caption: 'Model for potential differences between Socs3 and Cish gene expression.
  Under normal conditions, when 3T3-L1 adipocytes are stimulated with GH, the JAK-STAT
  signaling pathway is activated. STAT5 dimerizes and binds to STAT binding sites
  within the Cish and Socs3 promoters. For the Cish promoter, BRD2 is recruited by
  GH treatment. Then, BRD2 binds acetylated histones and recruits the positive elongation
  factor (P-TEFb), which is composed of 2 CDK9 and 2 cyclin T1 subunits. P-TEFb is
  responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser2 on the RNA Pol II C-terminal domain
  (CTD) to promote elongation. When the cells are pretreated with JQ1 before GH stimulation,
  BRD2 is displaced from chromatin. Therefore, P-TEFb is not recruited to Cish promoter.
  At the Socs3 promoter, GH treatment stimulates the recruitment of P-TEFb by another
  factor, possibly the super elongation complex (SEC). P-TEFb then phosphorylates
  RNA Pol II and productive elongation occurs. When the cells are pretreated with
  JQ1, in addition to release of BRD2 from chromatin, it also releases P-TEFb from
  its inhibitory complex. P-TEFb then becomes more available to promote Socs3 elongation.
  Abbreviations: GH, growth hormone; JAK, Janus Kinase; RNA Pol II, ribonucleic acid
  polymerase II; Ser2, serine 2; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription.'
