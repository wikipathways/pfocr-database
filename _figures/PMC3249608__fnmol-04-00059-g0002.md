caption: RA-dependent non-transcriptional involvement in neurite outgrowth. Inhibition
  of PTEN leads to increased levels of PIP3 via PI3K. This in turn activates AKT by
  phosphorylation. Active pAKT has many functions such as the inhibition of GSK-3,
  Bad, or Bax, conversely it can activate Raf, RacI, and NF-κB. Recently in axonal
  regeneration it has been shown that active pAKT leads to the activation of the mTOR
  pathway (which can be inhibited via rapamycin). This leads to increased protein
  synthesis and ribosome biogenesis as well as cell growth through the phosphorylation
  of the ribosomal protein S6 and the release of the eukaryotic initiation factor
  4E (eIF-4E) from inhibition. RA-RARβsignaling has shown an inhibition of PTEN and
  a direct activation of pAKT in two separate studies. It will be of interest to examine
  if RA signaling induces downstream mTOR signaling in axonal regeneration.
