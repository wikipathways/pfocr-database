caption: Mechanisms of the immune response induced by polygenic diseases related to
  the composition of the intestinal microbiota in patients with IBS and healthy subjects.
  Bacteria such as Bacteroidetes, Clostridium, E. faecalis, and Firmicutes, promote
  the activation of different signaling pathways in the epithelial cells of the intestinal
  mucosa through various mechanisms, while commensal bacteria stimulate the induction
  of a Th1/Th2 response by the production of cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10,
  IL-12, and TNF-α in healthy controls (HC). Differentiation of antigen-specific Th17
  cells can be promoted by the increase in cytokine levels such as IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10,
  IL-17, IL-18, IL-23, TNF-α and INF-γ in patients with IBS. the green arrows represents
  the signaling pathway that is activated for the production of IL-23; the yellow
  arrows are the signaling pathway for the production of IL-8 and IL-10 in patients
  with IBS; the black arrows represents the path of activation of NFκB in healthy
  subjects; the blue arrows represent the caspase activation pathway and the production
  of IL1β and IL18; The truncated red line represents the inhibition of transcription
  factors or other molecules.
