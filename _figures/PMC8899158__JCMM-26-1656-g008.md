caption: Schematic model of CTNNAL1 mediating mucus hypersecretion through YAP‐ROCK2
  signalling pathway. In asthmatic model, CTNNAL1 deficiency stimulated YAP expression,
  which translocated into nucleus and bound with ROCK2 promoter. ROCK2 led to the
  expression of MUC5AC, IL‐4 and IL‐13 increased, which secreted from airway epithelial
  cells into airway lumen
