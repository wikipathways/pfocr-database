caption: 'Shows protection mechanisms used by the bacteria under various stresses
  through differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the shikimate pathway. Gene symbol
  in red, blue and black represent up-regulated, down-regulated and unchanged genes,
  respectively. NPG, 60-NPG and 110-NPG represent glyphosate, 60 gL−1 of glyphosate
  and 110 gL−1 glyphosate, respectively. Pale yellow dotted lines and solid lines
  represent shikimate feedback regulation, the accumulation of shikimic acid by NaCl
  (355 mM), HCl (pH 4.46) and glyphosate stresses through distinct causes. Dark yellow
  dotted line and solid line represent parts of the shikimate pathway of NRS-1, which
  responds to 110-NPG and 60-NPG. Red bold solid line: glyphosate regulates the sensor
  gene directly. Red dotted line and solid line: two different regulatory mechanisms
  of sensors for 110-NPG and 60-NPG, respectively'
