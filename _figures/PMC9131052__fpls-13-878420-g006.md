caption: Differentially expressed genes involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism
  pathways in response to CR and LR irradiation. Red letters represent DEGs and the
  heatmap represent the expression of the corresponding DEGs induced by CR and LR
  irradiation. The rectangle filled in red, blue, and gray represent the upregulated,
  downregulated, and non-different genes in the pathway after irradiation, respectively.
  Black arrow indicated a direct product.
