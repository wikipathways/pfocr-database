caption: The hypothesized pathways of volatile anesthetics induced neuropathology
  associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Volatile anesthetic was demonstrated to promote
  toxic Ab production and aggregation, and such effect was shown to be downstream
  of VA-induced caspase-3 cleavage and activation. The cleaved caspase 3 could inactivate
  Golgi-associated, gamma adaptin ear-containing, ARF-binding protein 3 (GGA3), which
  degrades b-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE, or b-secretase). The overall effect is
  cellular stabilization of BACE/b-secretase and increased processing of amyloid progenitor
  protein (APP) by β-secretase and γ-secretase, leading to accumulation of neurotoxic
  Ab aggregates. Reciprocal regulation of this pathway may also exist, whereby inhibiting
  Ab oligomerization could reduce caspase 3 activation. Caspase 3 activation and Ab
  accumulation could also be upstream of tau phosphorylation, as Ab oligomerization
  inhibitor prevented tau hyper-phosphorylation. In addition, owing to their small
  molecular size, volatile anesthetics have been shown to directly interact with residues
  G29, A30 and I31 of Ab to promote Ab oligomerization. Ab amyloid-beta protein, AICD
