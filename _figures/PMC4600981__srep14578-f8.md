caption: Oxalic acid, in the extracellular medium might result in the change in concentration
  of cytosolic Ca2+ that might activate FvCamlp via calmodulin/calcineurin mediated
  Ca2+signaling pathway leading to OXDC transcription. Blocking of this signalling
  pathway either by use of calmodulin (CaM) inhibitor (W-7) or siRNA specific to FvCaMLP
  leads to significant downregulation of OXDC in presence of oxalic acid. Besides
  oxalic acid also being an organic acid creates low pH stress, leading to activation
  of an additional low pH response pathway which might turn on the OXDC transcription
  through low pH response factor (LPRF). In presence of any other general acid like
  HCl, only low pH response pathway gets activated and calcium signaling pathway is
  probably not involved. LPRE, Low pH response element.
