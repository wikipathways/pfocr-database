caption: (A) Chemical structure of the compounds targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway used
  in this study. (B) Scheme of Akt signaling pathway, which regulates cell survival,
  showing the point of action of the drugs shown in A. Akt phosphorylation and activation
  result from its recruitment to PIP3 at plasma membrane, after which it exerts cytoplasmic
  and nuclear functions. Accumulation of PIP3 classically follows ligand (L) binding
  to tyrosin kinase cell-surface receptors (RTK), adapter proteins (AP) recruitment
  to RTK and finally, PI3K activation to phosphorylate PIP2 to PIP3. While Akt can
  be activated by the UPR it is not known if Akt can also regulate the UPR.
