caption: 'Hypothetical diagram showing dopaminergic and adenosinergic mechanisms inducing
  bladder dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The micturition reflex is controlled
  by the spinobulbospinal pathway passing through the PAG in the midbrain and the
  PMC in the pons. This neural circuit is under the control of higher centers including
  the striatum and the cortex region. A. Under normal conditions (Intact), tonic firing
  (+) of dopaminergic neurons in the SN activates dopamine D1 receptors expressed
  on GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the striatum to induce tonic GABAergic (−) inhibition
  of the micturition reflex at the level of the PAG. At the same time, D1 receptor
  stimulation suppresses the activity of adenosinergic neurons, which exert an excitatory
  effect on micturition via adenosine A2A receptors [Adenosine A2A (+)]. B. In PD,
  dopaminergic neurons in the SN are lost (lesion), leading to the loss of dopamine
  D1 receptor activation [D1 (loss of activation)], which results in reduced activation
  of inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the striatum [GABA (loss of inhibition)]. At
  the same time, reduced D1 receptor stimulation enhances the adenosinergic mechanism
  to stimulate adenosine A2A receptors [Adenosine A2A (++)], leading to facilitation
  of the spinobulbospinal pathway controlling the micturition reflex (activity). Administration
  of dopamine D1 receptor agonists (D1 agonist) can restore the GABAergic nerve activity
  and suppress A2A receptor-mediated activation to reduce bladder overactivity in
  PD. Also, administration of adenosine A2A receptor antagonists (A2A antagonist)
  can suppress A2A receptor-mediated activation of the micturition reflex to reduce
  bladder overactivity in PD. Dopamine D2 receptors [D2 (+)] expressed in the spinal
  cord enhance the micturition reflex. Abbreviations: dopamine D1 receptor (D1); dopamine
  D2 receptor (D2); gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA); periaqueductal gray (PAG); pontine
  micturition center (PMC); substantia nigra pars compacta (SN).'
