caption: 'LPS biosynthetic genes and their structural modifications: (a) Schematic
  drawing of the waa locus. Orientations of three operons and genes encoding various
  biosynthetic enzymes are shown. Also shown is co-transcription of RirA sRNA with
  waaQ. (b) Depiction of the role of various glycosyltransferases and acyltransferases
  in LPS biosynthesis. The bottom panel 1 highlights inner core alterations that result
  in the incorporation of a third Kdo and Rha. In panel 2, a shift of Rha attachment
  to the third Kdo upon the EptB-dependent incorporation of phosphoethanolamine on
  the second Kdo, when RpoE is induced, is shown. (c) Schematic drawing of the Raetz
  pathway of biosynthesis of Kdo2-LAhexa. Critical steps that regulate LpxC levels
  are depicted.'
