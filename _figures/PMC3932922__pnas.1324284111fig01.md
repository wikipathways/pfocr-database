caption: (A) Cartoon presentation of LRRK2 showing multidomain structure. Termini
  and predicted domains labeled along approximate domain boundaries. Cartoon of domain
  structures were rendered using coordinates of homology models built based on other
  proteins with known structures. The N-terminus region preceding the LRR domain consists
  of sequence similarity to more than one additional protein–protein interaction domain,
  including HEAT [Huntingtin, elongation factor 3 (EF3), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A),
  and the yeast kinase TOR1] repeats and Ankyrin repeats; however, their boundaries
  are more difficult to approximate. (B) A simplified drawing of the vesicular endocytosis
  pathway showing GAK/Hsc70 involvement in uncoating clathrin-coated vesicles. BAG5
  might also be involved in the same process by interacting with Hsc70, and Rab7L1
  functions in the retromer sorting process. LRRK2 interacts with all three proteins
  (GAK, BAG5, and Rab7L1); thus, the process of vesicular endocytosis, sorting, recycling,
  and degradation might be important in the pathogenesis of PD.
