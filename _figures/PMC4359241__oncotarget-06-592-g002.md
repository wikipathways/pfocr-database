caption: 'Testosterone circulates in the blood and is bound to albumin, whereas free
  testosterone is introduced into prostate cells and is subsequently converted to
  DHT by 5-alpha-reductase. Binding of DHT to the AR induces dissociation from HSPs
  and receptor phosphorylation. The AR dimerizes and can bind to androgen-response
  elements in the promoter regions of target genes, leading to growth, survival and
  production of PSA. Enzalutamide, formerly called MDV3100, exerts its mechanism of
  action during several steps in the AR signaling pathway including inhibition of
  AR binding to androgens, inhibition of nuclear translocation of AR, inhibition of
  AR association to DNA, and AR amplification. As some of those aberrations may occur
  late in the disease, it is unknown at this point if enzalutamide will have a role
  upfront in the management of prostate cancer. Abbreviations: AR, androgen receptor;
  DHT, dihydrotestosterone; GTA, general transcription activation; HSP, heat-shock
  protein; SHBG, sex-hormone-binding globulin; AKT, akt serine/threonine kinase; DHEA,
  dihydroepiandrosterone; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; P, phosphorylated
  residues; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PTEN, phoshatase and tensin homolog.'
