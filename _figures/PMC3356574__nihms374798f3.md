caption: A model of the signaling pathways regulating radiation-induced bystander
  effects through expression and secretion of soluble biologically active factors.
  α-particle irradiation caused DNA damage, which induces ATM activation in normal
  and cancer cells. ATM further activates the NF-κB pathway, which targets gene expression
  of numerous cytokines and COX2. Cytokines initiate specific signaling pathways in
  directly irradiated and bystander cells resulting in the secondary activation of
  IKK-NF-κB, JAK2-STAT3 and the MAPK pathways with the subsequent induction of cytokine,
  COX2 and inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) gene expression. COX-2-produced
  PGE2 is involved in regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, iNOS
  controls synthesis of NO. Effects of ROS and Nitric oxide (NO) in the mitochondrial
  damage and bystander response were previously described []. On the other hand, NF-κB
  regulates expression of numerous genes controlling a general cell survival and anti-apoptotic
  activity. Exogenous IGF-1 via ligation of IGF-1R activates the PI3K-AKT pathway
  that using suppression of GSK3β stabilizes β-catenin protein levels; LEF1--β-catenin
  heterodimer goes to the nucleus and further controls gene expression. Furthermore,
  AKT controls numerous general metabolic, survival and anti-apoptotic functions in
  the cell. IGFBP-3 stabilizes the exogenous IGF-1 and extends its action time further
  activating the basal PI3K-AKT pathway. An additional level of cell-cell communications
  is a usage of gap junctions that could transmit signaling molecules, such as NO.
