caption: Schematic diagram of the therapeutic strategies targeting the AIM2 inflammasome
  in cancer. (A) The natural flavonoid luteolin exerts an anti-tumoral activity by
  blocking the AIM2 inflammasome activation leading to the G2/M phase arrest of the
  cell cycle and the inhibition of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).
  (B) The AIM2 inflammasome inhibition by means of Thalidomide induces a lower release
  of Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and IL-1β and IL-6, reducing the tumor growth
  associated with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines ameliorating the intestinal side
  effects associated with irinotecan treatment in cancer patients. (C) Chimeric antigen
  receptor T (CAR-T) treatment induced AIM2 inflammasome activation in macrophages
  with the ensuing release of IL-1β and macrophages phenotypic switch, which highly
  expressed programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
  (IDO). (D) Tumor treating fields (TTFields) led to AIM2 triggering, favoring the
  activation of adaptive immunity via IL-1-like cytokines and a type I IFNs release
  leading to DC activation and favoring T cell activation and clonal expansion. (E)
  The vaccination with AIM2-deficient DCs promotes the activation of the cGAS-STING
  pathway, which is responsible for the release of type I IFN secretion which favors
  the infiltration of CD8+ T cells through the production of CXCL10 and reduces the
  recruitment of regulatory T cells (T regs). (F) The use of nanoparticle drug carriers
  for plasmid delivery, the Folate-grafted PEI600-CyD (H1)-based plasmid AIM2 (pAIM2)
  nanoparticles, is able to augment the expression of AIM2, to trigger cells apoptosis,
  and to limit cancer cell migration and invasion
