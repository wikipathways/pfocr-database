caption: At the cellular level, ferroptosis is driven primarily by iron-dependent
  lipid peroxidation. Many aspects of iron metabolism such as the absorption, storage
  and utilization of iron have important roles in regulating ferroptosis. In addition,
  the activation of long-chain fatty-acid CoA ligase 4 (LACS4), lysophospholipid acyltransferase
  5 (LPLAT5), lipoxygenase (LOX) or NADPH oxidase (NOX) in the lipid metabolic pathway
  promotes lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. The canonical ferroptosis-suppressing
  pathway involves the uptake of cystine (Cys) via the cystine–glutamate antiporter
  (system xc−), which results in glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis. Using GSH as a cofactor,
  the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) reduces phospholipid hydroperoxides to their
  corresponding alcohols. The peroxidation of phospholipids is also kept in check
  by the ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)–coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) system. Ferroptosis
  is also regulated by the iron metabolism pathway that involves iron absorption,
  transport, storage and utilization. At the cellular level, non-haem iron is transported
  into cells by either transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFR1)-mediated, transferrin
  (TF)-bound iron uptake or metal transporter solute carrier family 39 member 14 (SLC39A14;
  also known as metal cation symporter ZIP14)-mediated, non-TF-bound iron uptake.
  In addition, haem degradation and nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-mediated
  ferritinophagy can increase the labile iron pool (LIP), thereby sensitizing cells
  to ferroptosis via the Fenton reaction. FPN, ferroportin; Glu, glutamate; GSSG,
