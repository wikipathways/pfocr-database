caption: Metabolic routes for the production of isoprenoid-based biofuels in a living
  system. The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is from acetyl-CoA, and the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate
  (DXP) pathway is from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate. IPP, isoprenyl diphosphate;
  DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; IDI, isoprenyl diphosphate isomerase; nudiX, nucleoside
  diphosphate hydrolases; GPP, geranyl pyrophosphate; FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate;
  GPPS, geranyl pyrophosphate synthase; FPPS, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase; PS,
  pinene synthase; FS, farnesene synthase; BS, bisabolene synthase; PPS, endogenous
  pyrophosphatase.
