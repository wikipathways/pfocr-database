caption: Origins and subcellular localizations of the tetrapyrrole synthesis enzymes
  in different eukaryotes. A. Heme biosynthesis starting with C4 pathway of primary
  heterotrophic eukaryotes. The localization of CPOX differs between the animal cell
  (continuous line) and yeast (dashed line). B. Tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway
  that is shared by most of the photosynthetic eukaryotes starting from glutamyl-tRNAGlu.
  C. Origins and suggested locations of the two tetrapyrrole pathways in Euglena gracilis.
  Origins of the enzymes are inferred from the phylogenetic trees that are depicted
  in  ( online). The locations of PPOX and FeCH in the plastid of E. gracilis are
  implied only by their origins because the N-terminal sequences are not available
  for these enzymes. Dashed arrowheads indicate possible dual localizations of UROS
  and UROD in the plastid and either cytosol or mitochondrion of E. gracilis. The
  question marks stand for enzyme orthologues that are present in either photosynthetic
  or heterotrophic eukaryotes but were not found in the limited sequence data of E.
