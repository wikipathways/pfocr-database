caption: 'Cross talk between immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-associated
  receptor signaling and toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways in conventional dendritic
  cells (cDCs), MΦ, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs): an ITAM-centric view. ITAM-mediated
  activation pathways are shown by green arrows; ITAM-mediated inhibitory pathways
  are shown by red lines. Positive or negative control of immune responses in macrophages
  (MΦ) is determined by avidity of ITAM-associated receptors to their ligands. Production
  of interferons (IFNs)-I is facilitated by interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)
  in macrophages, by IRF5 in cDCs, and by IRF7 in pDCs. In cDCs, ITAM-associated receptor
  signaling can result in the IRF5-mediated production of IFN-β without engagement
  of TLRs (). Alternative pathway in cDCs () is shown by dotted arrow.'
