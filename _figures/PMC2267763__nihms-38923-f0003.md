caption: The role of FAK in the establishment of cell tension. FAK is recruited to
  developing adhesions, resulting in autophosphorylation and activation of c-Src.
  Downstream signals of FAK and/or Src include mediators of the Rho pathway which
  would stimulate cytoskeletal contraction, leading to adhesion growth, the development
  of tension, and further activation of FAK. In addition, exogenous force (such as
  stretching or resistance by a rigid substrate) would result in increased tension
  and additional FAK activation. This positive feedback loop between FAK and the contractile
  cytoskeletal network would serve to maintain tension at critical sites of the cell.
