caption: Genes involved in apoptotic pathways were altered in type II cells isolated
  from Stat3Δ/Δ mice. Genes associated with apoptosis were identified via literature
  mining using Pathway Studio 4.0 (Ariadne Genomics, Inc.). STAT3 regulates apoptosis
  positively and negatively, via processes occurring in multiple intracellular compartments.
  Genes up-regulated in Stat3Δ/Δ mice are framed in red. Genes down-regulated in Stat3Δ/Δ
  mice are framed in green. Each dashed line demarcated with a larger dot linking
  "apoptosis" and each gene node indicates a regulatory relationship based on the
  literature references. Regulatory relationships are denoted by line colors (green,
  positive  regulation; red, negative regulation; and gray, regulation direction is  unknown).
