caption: Illustration of selective components in the BMP signaling pathway, important
  for bone and cartilage formation and fracture healing. Bone morphogenetic proteins
  (BMP) induce intracellular signaling by binding the transmembrane receptors BMPR-II
  and BMPR-I. When these serine/threonine receptors are activated by BMPs, BMPR-I
  becomes phosphorylated. When both BMPR-II and BMPR-I are bound to BMPs and phosphorylated,
  downstream signaling is activated via the phosphorylation of transcription factors
  SMAD 1/5/8. Activated pSMAD 1/5/8 forms a complex with cofactor SMAD4, allowing
  for the regulated transcription of downstream target genes.
