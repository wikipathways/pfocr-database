caption: Schematic of the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. (A) In the absence of
  Sonic hedgehog (Shh), the 12 transmembrane receptor Patched (Ptch) suppresses the
  seven transmembrane G-coupled receptor Smoothened (Smo) and the transcription factor
  Gli is sequestered into the cytoplasm by the Suppressor-of-Fuse (SuFu) preventing
  it from translocating to the nucleus and is degraded leading to a block of transcription.
  (B) In the presence of Shh, the suppression by Ptch is relieved and Smo activates
  Gli1 that is translocated to the nucleus and induces the transcription of Gli targets,
  including many proproliferative genes. (C) In medulloblastoma, loss of Ptch and
  mutations in Smo or SuFu lead to the constitutive activity of Smo, accumulation
  of Gli and increased transcription of proproliferative Gli-dependent targets. Asterisk
  (*) identifies proteins mutated in medulloblastoma.
