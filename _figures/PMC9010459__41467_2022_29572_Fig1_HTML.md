caption: a The design, chemical structure, and properties of Ru1085, which is excited
  at 808 nm and emitted over 1000 nm with chemotherapeutic, photodynamic/photothermal
  properties. b The underlying antitumor mechanism illustrates the internalization
  of Ru1085 into A549 cells through endocytic pathway, and subsequently induces mitochondria-mediated
  apoptosis and arrested cell cycle at S and G2/M phase. c Ru1085 is utilized in NIR-II
  fluorescence imaging for guiding and monitoring chemo-phototherapy in tumor-bearing
  mice models.
