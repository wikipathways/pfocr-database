caption: TSLP signalling pathways through JAK1 and JAK2. TSLP signaling pathways require
  a heterodimer of IL-7Ra and TSLP receptor (TSLPR). Interaction between TSLP and
  its receptor cascades in a signaling pathway through JAK1 and JAK2 which varies
  depending on the cell type. JAK1 and JAK 2 can activate STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 as
  well as NF-kB and MAP kinases through PI3K, but all these pathways have not been
  fully resolved. The outcome of activation also varies with the type of cell affected,
  but includes upregulation of IL-6, IL-8, cell proliferation; in dendritic cells,
  activation by TSLP causes their migration and maturation to a Th2 phenotype.
