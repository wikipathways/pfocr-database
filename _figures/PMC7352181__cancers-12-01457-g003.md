caption: Angiotensin-associated pathways involved on hypoxia and angiogenesis in lung
  tumor microenvironment. In cancer cells, upon binding of Ang II to AT1R, a pleiotropic
  downstream signaling cascade is triggered, ultimately causing, either directly or
  indirectly, upregulation of angiogenesis and metastasis. Activated AT1R subunits
  trigger potent oxidant signaling through NADPH complex, which is involved in angiogenesis.
  Activated Gαq/11 units also activate the JAK-SHP2/STAT pathway and receptor tyrosine
  kinase (RTK) transactivation. Subsequent signaling upon activation of EGFR is herein
  represented. Macrophages, endothelial cells and fibroblasts are important components
  of the tumor microenvironment and capable of generating and expressing RAS components.
  These cells, beyond their functional ligands and receptors that are altered in tumor
  microenvironment, and reflect the crosstalk between all cell constituents, also
  use the RAS signaling pathway (mostly AT1, but also MasR in endothelial cells) to
  yield functional characteristics that ultimately may favor the cell itself and enhancing
  tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. 4E-BP1, Eukaryotic translation initiation factor
