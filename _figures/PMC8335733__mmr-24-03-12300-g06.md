caption: A diagram of the proposed model explaining the observations of ROS/Nrf2-mediated
  regulation of autophagy following TBI and potential mechanisms underlying the effect
  of the DEX intervention. ROS, reactive oxygen species; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2; TBI, traumatic brain injury; HO, heme oxygenase; DEX, dexmedetomidine.
