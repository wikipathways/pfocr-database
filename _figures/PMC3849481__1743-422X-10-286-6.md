caption: Schematic diagram showing CSFV triggers RIG-I and MDA5 dependent signaling
  pathway to IRF-3 and NF-κB activation to promote the production of antiviral and
  inflammatory cytokines in porcine alveolar macrophages. Detection of CSFV Shimen
  strain by RIG-I and MDA5 activated a cascade of changes that lead to the higher
  protein expression of IPS-1, stimulated the nuclei accumulation of IRF-3 and NF-κB.
  As a result of such activation, antiviral factors IFN-α and IFN-β were apparently
  promoted, and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-β were heavily enhanced
  in PAMs following CSFV Shimen strain infection. Ablation of RIG-I and/or using shRNA
  resulted in negative modulation of the secretion of antiviral and inflammatory cytokines.
  ↑- up-regulation.
