caption: Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on intestinal epithelial cells and immune
  cells represent a contact-dependent signalling pathway where the activation of PRRs
  eventually leads to alterations in gene expression via nuclear receptors (such as
  nuclear factor, IL-3-regulated (NFIL3)), epigenetic alterations or other mechanisms
  (contact-dependent mechanism). Bacterial products (for example, metabolites) are
  responsible for contact-independent mechanisms; of these, bacterial fermentation
  of fibre and the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) regulate satiety
  and the function of metabolic organs (liver, pancreas and adipose tissue). FFARs,
  free fatty acid receptors; GLP1, glucagon-like peptide 1; MyD88, myeloid differentation
  primary response protein 88; NLRs, NOD-like receptors; PYY, peptide YY; TLRs,Toll-like
  receptors.
