caption: During cellular growth, pyrimidine sufficiency dictates whether S. aureus
  needs to turn on the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Pyrimidines promote
  SaeS kinase activity, in part, by promoting and maintaining cell envelope and membrane
  integrity. Under pyrimidine-limited conditions where S. aureus cannot synthesize
  pyrimidines de novo, cell envelope biosynthesis goes unchecked, resulting in increased
  LTA production, thickening of the cell wall, and formation of a bottleneck in phospholipid
  biosynthesis. This results in an unstable membrane due to accumulation of phospholipid
  precursors, including free fatty acids, that act to reduce SaeS kinase activity
