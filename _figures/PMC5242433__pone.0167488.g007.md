caption: '(A) Neutrophil responses. (B) NK-cell responses. To the right: Heatmaps
  of subject-specific baseline log2 fold changes for KEGG Antigen processing and presentation
  genes across post-vaccination days by vaccine group. Colored in red: up regulated
  from baseline; colored in green: down regulated from baseline. To the left: KEGG
  pathway maps for post-vaccination days at which this pathway was significantly perturbed
  (day 1 for neutrophils, day 28 for NK-cells). Pathway node color gradient encodes
  log2 fold change difference (LFCD) between vaccine groups (for multi-gene nodes
  the median LFCD was used). In red: increased log2 fold change response for the SV-AS03
  group relative to the SV-PBS group, in green: decreased log2 fold change response
  for the SV-AS03 group relative to the SV-AS03 group, and vice versa, in black: fold
  change close to 1, in dark grey: genes filtered out due to low overall expression,
  light grey: gene missing database mapping, white: non-human gene. DE genes are highlighted
  using red and green label colors.'
