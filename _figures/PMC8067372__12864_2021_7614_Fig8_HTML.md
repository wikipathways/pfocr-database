caption: Metabolic pathway in which some DEGs related to tribenuron-methyl were involved.
  Boxes generally represent enzymes, small circles represent metabolites, and rounded
  boxes represent another metabolic pathway diagram. Green represents down-regulated
  gene, red represents up-regulated gene, and blue represents both up- and down-regulated
  gene. The expression of gene in this figure refers to comprehensive performance
  among in Rt VS St, St VS Sck and Rt VS Rck
