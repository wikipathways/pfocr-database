caption: Radiation exposure generates superoxide in fibroblasts leading to transformation
  to myofibroblasts. MnTE-2-PyP treatment coverts this superoxide to hydrogen peroxide,
  which can oxidize redox sensitive proteins. KEAP1 is a redox sensitive protein that
  can be oxidized by hydrogen peroxide. Oxidized KEAP1 dissociates from NRF2 (inactive
  state) in the cytoplasm and can lead to a reduction in KEAP1 levels. NRF2 upon dissociation
  (active state) translocates to the nucleus to bind ARE elements in the promoter
  region of genes such as NQO1 and SOD2. An increase in NQO1 causes metabolic changes
  that can lead to an increase in NAD+ that serve as a cofactor for the sirtuin (SIRT)
  family of proteins. We have observed an increase in sirtuin activity in the mitochondria
  that also correlates with deacetylation of SOD2 (K122) protein. An increase in SOD2
  expression and deacetylation by mitochondrial sirtuin proteins leads to enhancement
  in SOD2 activity, further augmenting superoxide scavenging capacity upon MnTE-2-PyP
  treatment. Therefore, we observe a significant decrease in superoxide levels in
  fibroblast cells, which prevents its transformation to myofibroblasts. We have previously
  observed inhibition of TGF-β1/SMAD signaling pathway that decreases α-SMA by MnTE-2-PyP
  treatment. We believe this could be a consequence of NRF2 signaling activation and
  a decrease in superoxide levels.
