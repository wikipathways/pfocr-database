caption: 'Roles of sclerostin in cardiometabolic regulation and disease. Figure incorporates
  findings from animal models and humans. Sclerostin is predominantly secreted from
  osteocytes [], although a smaller amount can also be produced in other tissues,
  such as vasculature during CVD as a possible compensatory mechanism to counter vascular
  calcification []. In physiological states, sclerostin downregulates energy metabolism
  via enhancing adiposity and reducing insulin sensitivity [,]. It also enhances gluconeogenesis
  in liver []. However, it could also benefit energy expenditure via promoting beige
  adipogenesis []. Sclerostin levels have been reported to elevate in cardiometabolic
  syndromes [,]. Increased sclerostin promotes adipocyte hypertrophy in WAT and fatty
  liver, leading to an enhancement in inflammatory factor expression and oxidative
  stress [,]. During CVD, sclerostin in vasculature has been suggested to benefit
  cardiovascular health by reducing aortic aneurysm, decreasing atherosclerotic plaque
  formation, and preventing vascular calcification [,,]. It also plays an anti-inflammation
  role by attenuating the inflammatory factor expression and aortic macrophage infiltration
  []. Moreover, sclerostin probably has a direct suppressive effect on monocytes/macrophages
  by reducing cell adhesion [,], inhibiting cell migration [], decreasing cholesterol
  uptake [], and mitigating inflammatory factor production [,], via the inhibition
  of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in these cells. Short-head arrows: secretion; differentiation.
  Long-head arrows: suggested sclerostin effects. Long-head arrows with dash line:
  hypothesized sclerostin effects. Green texts: direct beneficial effects on cardiometabolic
  tissues in T2D or CVD conditions. Blue texts: anti-inflammatory effects in T2D or
  CVD conditions. Orange texts: direct detrimental effects on cardiometabolic tissues
