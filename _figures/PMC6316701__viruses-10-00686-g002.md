caption: 'Effect of SUMO on IFN pathways. In SUMO1-expressing and SUMO3-expressing
  cells: 1. STAT1 activation by IFN stimuli is inhibited by its SUMOylation []. 2.
  p53 SUMOylation is required for the induction of apoptosis in VSV infected cells
  []. 3. IRF3 is SUMOylated, which causes an inhibition of VSV-induced and RABV-induced
  IFN synthesis. This results in a higher RABV replication []. 4. SUMOylation of MxA
  in SUMO-expressing cells leads to MxA stabilization and to increased resistance
  to VSV infection []. 5, 6. SUMO1 (S1) and SUMO3 (S3) have different effects on PKR
  and eIF-2α activation [].'
