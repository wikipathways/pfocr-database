caption: Overview of key altered metabolites found in differentiated SH-SY5Y human
  cells exposed to high level BMAA (1000 µM) as compared to untreated control cells.
  Main pathways involved are alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. This map
  is a graphical adaptation based on pathway maps obtained from MetaboAnalyst (Xia
  et al. ), metabolites in bold are significantly upregulated as compared to vehicle.
  Also, see Table  for additional information. NAA N-acetylaspartate, l -Asp l-aspartate,
  l -Asn l-asparagine, ASA argininosuccinate, l -Ala l-alanine, d -Asp d-aspartate,
  l -Gln l-glutamine, glucosamine-6-P glucosamine-6-phosphate, L-Glu l-glutamate,
  GABA gamma aminobutyric acid
