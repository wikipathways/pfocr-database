caption: 'Possible pattern of interaction between CRC cell and adjacent nerve. Neurons
  secret neurotrophic factors such as NGF, BDNF and GDNF, which then form signaling
  complex with their cognate receptors (TrkA, TrkB and GFRα respectively) on CRC cells.
  These complexes initiate intracellular MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathway and eventually
  turn on NF-κB transcription, facilitating tumor survival and invasion. Besides,
  neurotransmitters released by neurons also switch on growth pathways in CRC cells
  and prompts extracellular matrix remodeling: adrenaline binds to β receptor and
  activates PGE2/COX2 axis, resulting in increased expression of VEGF and MMP9; acetylcholine
  binds to M3 receptor, which upregulates EGFR signaling and downstream production
  of MMP1 and MMP7. 2) Tumor cells themselves and mesenchymal cells may also release
  BDNF and GDNF to bind TrkB and GFRα expressed on newborn nerves, assisting in neurogenesis
  in the tumor microenvironment, thus “placing” nerves in proximity to tumor cells.
  Adhesion molecules such as L1CAM and N-Cadherin are expressed on CRC cells and neurons,
  allowing for further migration and dissemination of cancer cells along the adjacent
  nerve. 3) Glia cells may be stimulated by CRC cells to activate cancer stem cell,
  which serves as a replenishing pool for CRC cells, constituting a positive feedback
  loop.'
