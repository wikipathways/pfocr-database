caption: This figure shows the association of NK receptors with MHC class I molecules
  and portions of the resulting signaling pathway, as described in the text. “Src
  Kinase” represents various kinases capable of participating in this interaction,
  such as Syk and ZAP70. SHP2 (PTPN11) is used in place of SHP1 (PTPN6) in some circumstances,
  such as associating with KIR2DL4. Symbols show the continuation of the pathway where
  arrows are not drawn. −, negatively charged residue; +, positively charged residue;
  AKT1, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (also called RAC); DAG1, dystroglycan
  1; FcɛRI-γ, receptor for Fc fragment of IgE, high affinity I, gamma polypeptide;
  GRB2, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; INPP5D, inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase,
  145kDa (also called SHIP); ITPKB, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase B (also
  called IP3KB); LAT, linker for activation of T cells; LCP2, lymphocyte cytosolic
  protein 2 (also called SLP76); P, phosphate group; PAK1, p21/Cdc42/Rac1-activated
  kinase 1 (STE20 homolog, yeast); PIK3CG, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, gamma
  polypeptide (also called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase); PLCG1, phospholipase C,

  oncogene homolog; SH3BP2, SH3 domain–binding protein 2; SHC1, SHC (SH2 domain–containing)
  transforming protein 1; SOS1, son of sevenless homolog 1; VAV1, vav 1 oncogene;
