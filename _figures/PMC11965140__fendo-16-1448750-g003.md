caption: Immune activation and immune imbalance induced by CORT. CORT activates the
  immune system via Toll-like receptors. Innate immune cells are the first responders
  to CORT. The intracellular signaling pathways triggered by CORT produce two main
  effects, on the one hand, the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors to enhance immune
  activity. On the other hand, the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors to protect
  the cells themselves and to restrain excessive immune responses. The sustained high-level
  CORT further activates adaptive immune cells and expands immune activity. At this
  time, a large number of immune cells participate in the circumstance and transmit
  signals to each other through inflammatory factors. If CORT persists as an upstream
  signaling molecule, it will continue to deplete the immune system, leading to the
  exacerbation and spread of inflammation
