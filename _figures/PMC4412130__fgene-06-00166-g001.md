caption: Eukaryotic mechanisms that manage replication– transcription conflicts. Schematic
  representation of a head-on encounter between the replisome and RNAPII. The cotrascriptional
  processing of nascent RNA, including its export through the nuclear envelope mediated
  by the THO/TREX and TREX2 complexes, can impede replication forks progression. The
  ATR checkpoint pathway temporarily inhibits RNA export by phosphorylating nucleoporins,
  thus allowing fork advancement. However, this process may generate harmful R-loop
  structures, more likely in head-on replication–transcription encounters. Multiple
  factors, including the accessory DNA/RNA helicases of the replisome Sen1/SETX and
  Pif1, the RNA exosome, RNaseH2, and Toposomerase I, may cooperate in limiting R-loop
  accumulation at the fork. The FACT complex, which interacts with SETX, could be
  involved in the re-establishment of chromatin status upon replication–transcription
  collisions. R-loops can be also processed into DSBs by XPG and XPF endonucleases.
  Hog1-dependent Mrc1 phosphorylation and RecQL5 modulate the speed of the replisome
  or RNAPII, respectively, while Dicer dislodges RNAPII at fork passage. Failure to
  promptly remove R-loops (gray box) causes not only DSBs, but also chromatin condensation
  through the accumulation of H3S10P and H3K9me2 markers, which contributes to fork
  arrest and gene silencing. Unrestrained R-loop accumulation has been also linked
  to repeats expansion and inflammation events, thus contributing to cancer and neurodegeneration
  (refer to text for further details).

  description: Eukaryotic mechanisms that manage replication– transcription conflicts.
    Schematic representation of a head-on encounter between the replisome and RNAPII.
    The cotrascriptional processing of nascent RNA, including its export through the
    nuclear envelope mediated by the THO/TREX and TREX2 complexes, can impede replication
    forks progression. The ATR checkpoint pathway temporarily inhibits RNA export
    by phosphorylating nucleoporins, thus allowing fork advancement. However, this
    process may generate harmful R-loop structures, more likely in head-on replication–transcription
    encounters. Multiple factors, including the accessory DNA/RNA helicases of the
    replisome Sen1/SETX and Pif1, the RNA exosome, RNaseH2, and Toposomerase I, may
    cooperate in limiting R-loop accumulation at the fork. The FACT complex, which
    interacts with SETX, could be involved in the re-establishment of chromatin status
    upon replication–transcription collisions. R-loops can be also processed into
    DSBs by XPG and XPF endonucleases. Hog1-dependent Mrc1 phosphorylation and RecQL5
    modulate the speed of the replisome or RNAPII, respectively, while Dicer dislodges
