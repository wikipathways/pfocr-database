caption: 'Model linking HSP70 induction to p33ING1b-induced apoptosis. Previous studies
  have linked HSP70 to TNF-α-mediated apoptosis by impairing NF-κB survival signaling
  through binding IKK-γ. p33ING1b has also been implicated in the p53-inducible expression
  of the proapoptotic Bax member of the Bcl2 family. In this study, we show that p33ING1b
  induces significant levels of HSP70, that it inhibits NF-κB activity, and that it
  acts synergistically with TNF-α to induce apoptosis. The p33ING1b protein, therefore,
  is proposed to induce apoptosis by at least two mechanisms: by activating p53 and
  inducing signaling through the mitochondrial pathway and by inhibiting the NF-κB
  survival pathway through the induction of HSP70.'
