caption: PK/ADA model for immunogenicity assessment. This PK/ADA model is based on
  the empirical modeling of protein drug–ADA interactions. With repeated dosing of
  the drug (e.g., via s.c. or i.v. route), ADA may be raised against the drug. The
  dashed arrow denotes the accumulated drug dose driving the generation of ADA [Eq.
  () in the text]. To account for the time delay to generate ADA, putative ADA doses
  are injected as boluses into a hypothetical compartment “ADA depot”. The ADA subsequently
  pass through a series of delay compartments with a time delay t lag before entering
  the central compartment. The circulating ADA can bind to the drug reversibly with
  rate constants k on and k off, form complex, and alter the drug PK by adding additional
  elimination pathway. The affinity maturation of ADA is modeled by decreasing k off
  in concert with the drug exposure time [Eq. ()]. By accounting for the ADA-mediated
  drug clearance in the PK/ADA model, the ADA parameters can be estimated by fitting
  the drug PK profile
