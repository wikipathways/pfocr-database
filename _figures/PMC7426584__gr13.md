caption: 'Parkin/PINK1-mediated pathway in stimulation of autophagy in PD. Mitophagy
  activated by mitochondria-targeted drugs decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential.
  PINK1, which normally is processed by mitochondrial peptidase, accumulates at the
  outer mitochondrial membrane and triggers the recruitment of Parkin, which initiates
  the autophagic machinery. Adapted from Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience, 55,
