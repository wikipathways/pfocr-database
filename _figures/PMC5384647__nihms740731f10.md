caption: In cellular contexts that favor HIFα protein instability (normal oxygen levels,
  but also low ID2 expression and high DYRK1 expression) prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1)
  is active and positively regulates DYRK1 kinases. Active, tyrosine phosphorylated
  DYRK1 kinases keep ID2 under functional constraint by phosphorylation of Thr-27.
  The VCB-Cul2 ubiquitin ligase complex efficiently ubiquitylates HIFα (left). With
  decreasing oxygenation and PHD1 inactivation but also in the presence of downregulation
  of DYRK1, elevated expression of ID2, or ID2-T27A mutation, the un-phosphorylated/un-phosphorylatable
  pool of ID2 exerts an inhibitory function towards the VCB-Cul2 complex by binding
  directly VHL and Elongin C proteins and displacing Cul2. This results in HIFα accumulation
  (right). The transcriptional activation of the ID2 gene, a HIFα target, by HIF2α
  generates a feed-forward ID2-HIF2α loop that amplifies the effects.
