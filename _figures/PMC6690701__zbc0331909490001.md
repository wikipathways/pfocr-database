caption: Schematic diagram showing the intersection between sulfide oxidation and
  energy metabolism. a, in proliferating cells, oxidation of nutrients for biomass
  synthesis leads to electron capture by NAD+ and other cofactors, which are recycled
  by the ETC. An H2S-induced ETC backup leads to a shortage of uridine and aspartate.
  DHO and DHOD, dihydroorotate and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, respectively. b,
  reactions catalyzed by the sulfide oxidation pathway enzymes.
