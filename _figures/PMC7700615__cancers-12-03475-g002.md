caption: Schematic illustration of signaling via TGFβ receptors initiated at different
  intracellular locations and sites of inhibition by RAC1B. TGFβ binding to its receptors
  on the cell surface activates both Smad-mediated and non-Smad signal transduction
  pathways. Receptors are distributed between different compartments/microdomains
  of the plasma membrane. In the clathrin-coated pits (left-hand side) activated TGFβ
  receptors bind and phosphorylate SMAD2/3, initiating the canonical Smad pathway.
  In the lipid rafts/caveolae of the plasma membrane (right-hand side) the receptors
  preferentially associate with SMAD7. This inhibitory Smad negatively regulates Smad-mediated
  signaling by competing with SMAD2/3 for interaction with ALK5/TβRI and recruits
  the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases Smurf1 and Smurf2, which direct ubiquitin-dependent
  degradation of the TGFβ receptor complex (right-hand side). SMAD7 can also function
  as an adaptor protein, facilitating the activation of non-Smad signaling pathways
  (center). In early endosomes (EEs) Smad-mediated signaling is further enhanced by
  accessory proteins (SARA and endofin). In the nucleus, the intracellular domain
  of ALK5 (TβRI-ICD) can act as a transcription factor to regulate the expression
  of genes like SNAI1 and MMP2. Stimulatory interactions of RAC1B are denoted by green
  arrows, inhibitory ones by red lines. Gray arrows or lines indicate the still hypothetical
  nature of the interactions. Adapted from [], modified.
