caption: The TLR pathway is overactivated in various types of inflammatory and autoimmune
  diseases by ligands binding to the TLR. In 30% of ABC DLBCL and in several other
  B cell lymphomas, MyD88, which links TLRs to the IRAK1 and IRAK4 kinases, is affected
  by activating L265P mutations. Activity of IRAKs leads to activation of the canonical
  NF-κB pathway. IRAK4 is essential for TLR signaling through MyD88. The newly developed
  IRAK4 inhibitors ND-2158 and ND-2110 abrogate signaling mediated by TLR receptors
  or mutated MyD88. In ABC DLBCL, NF-κB is also activated though chronic active B
  cell receptor signaling, which involves the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). Inhibition
  of BTK by ibrutinib has shown clinical efficiency in first clinical studies. Notably,
  coapplication of ibrutininb and ND-2158 has synergistic toxic activity for ABC DLBCL
  cell lines in vitro and in a xenograft model. For the signaling pathways, not all
  components are shown.
