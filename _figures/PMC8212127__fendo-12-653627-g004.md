caption: Cartoon proposed model of Graves’ disease and thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy
  (TAO) pathogenesis. (A) Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) drive the over-production
  of thyroid hormones by activating the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR), thus overriding
  the normal regulatory role of thyrotropin on the process. B and T cells and antigen-presenting
  cells which infiltrate the gland produce interleukins 1β, 6, 12, 13, interferon
  γ, tumor necrosis factor α, and CD40 ligand. These cytokines then activate thyroid
  epithelial cells, promote inflammation, and induce genes ordinarily unexpressed
  by these cells such as major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II). Anti-thyroid
  drugs are useful therapeutically by reducing excess thyroid hormone production as
  well as modulating the expression of pathogenic intrathyroidal cytokines. (B) The
  pathogenesis of TAO also involves the infiltration of professional immune cells.
  Orbital fibroblasts exhibit particularly robust responses to inflammatory mediators.
  Among these cells are CD34+ fibroblasts which we propose derive from fibrocytes,
  monocyte-derived progenitor cells that traffic from bone marrow. Fibrocytes circulate
  in Graves’ disease at higher frequency than that found in healthy individuals. When
  cultivated from the peripheral circulation, fibrocytes express several thyroid-specific
  proteins, including thyrotropin receptor (TSHR), thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase
  and sodium-iodide symporter. They also express MHC constitutively and can present
  antigens. When exposed to the appropriate culture conditions, they undergo differentiation
  into myofibroblasts (through Smad pathway activation by TGF-β) and adipocytes (through
  the activation of PPAR-γ). Many of the genes expressed by fibrocytes are detected
  at considerably lower levels in CD34+ orbital fibroblasts. We have found recently
  that these lower levels of expression result from the actions of Slit2 which acts
  through its cognate receptor, Roundabout 1 (ROBO1). When activated, CD34+ fibrocytes
  and CD34+ fibroblasts generate several pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines,
  including interleukins 1β, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, tumor necrosis factor α, and regulated
  on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), CXCL-12 and CD40-CD154.
  Both CD34+ and CD34- orbital fibroblasts cell-surface display insulin-like growth
  factor-I receptor (IGF-IR). Orbital fibroblasts express three mammalian hyaluronan
  synthase (HAS) isoenzymes and UDP glucose dehydrogenase and synthesize hyaluronan,
  the glycosaminoglycan associated with expanding orbital tissue in TAO. The vast
  majority of hyaluronan synthesis occurs in CD34- orbital fibroblasts. From N. Engl.
