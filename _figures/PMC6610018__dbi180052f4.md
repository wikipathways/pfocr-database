caption: The cross talk between the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway and autophagy/mitophagy.
  Autophagy is initiated with the activation of ULK1 complex. ULK1-induced activation
  of beclin-1 complex favors the nucleation of autophagosome precursors and promotes
  autophagy. Mitophagy is a selective form of autophagy. Activation of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING
  pathway may stimulate autophagy via a cGAS/beclin-1 interaction窶電ependent mechanism.
  The cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway also promotes autophagy/mitophagy by TBK1-dependent
  phosphorylation and activation of receptors OPTN and p62 (SQSTM). Alternatively,
  activation of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway promotes an autophagy-dependent negative
  feedback regulation by 1) the interaction of cGAS with beclin-1, which in turn inhibits
  cGAS activity; 2) cGAMP-induced activation of ULK1, which promotes STING degradation
  by phosphorylation at Ser366; and 3) TBK1-p62/SQSTM1窶電ependent ubiquitination and
  degradation of STING. PINK/Parkin-induced mitophagy also restrains cGAS-cGAMP-STING
  signaling and innate immunity by mitophagy-mediated mtDNA clearance.
