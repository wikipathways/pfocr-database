caption: The protein–protein interaction map of the upstream regulators that significantly
  altered after the exposure to V. amygdalina leaf extract interaction prediction.
  The proteins functioning in GO biological processes are highlighted according to
  each process, i.e., GO:0042981 (regulation of apoptotic process) in dark green,
  GO:0010941 (regulation of cell death) in blue, GO:0010942 (positive regulation of
  cell death) in light green, GO:0043068 (positive regulation of programed cell death)
  in yellow, GO:2001233 (regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway) in red, and GO:0043065
  (positive regulation of apoptotic process) in pink. The upstream protein regulators
  that were involved with all cell death and apoptosis pathways were PTEN, XBP1, and
  ADORA2A
