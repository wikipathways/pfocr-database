caption: 'Regulatory mechanisms of ectodomain shedding. Mechanisms as diverse as protein–protein
  interactions, phosphorylation, intracellular trafficking, polarized secretion, and
  activation of sheddases contribute to the regulation of ectodomain shedding at the
  cell surface. Several examples are shown. (1) Intracellular protein–protein interaction:
  Calmodulin constitutively bound to the cytoplasmic tail of substrates (e.g., L-selectin,
  ACE) inhibits ectodomain shedding, and the dissociation of calmodulin induced by
  calmodulin kinase enhances shedding. In contrast, PMA stimulation induces the association
  of moesin, potentiating the shedding of substrates (e.g., L-selectin). (2) Extracellular
  protein–protein interaction: Binding of ARTS-1 to cytokine receptors, such as TNFRI
  and IL-6R, activates shedding possibly by inducing a conformational change in the
  substrate or by displacing an inhibitory factor from the substrate. (3) Intracellular
  trafficking of substrate: BiP binds to substrates (e.g., ACE) and retains the substrate
  in the ER, preventing its encounter with the sheddase at the cell surface. (4) Phosphorylation
  of sheddase: PTKs or PKCs may activate the sheddase through Tyr or Ser/Thr phosphorylation
  of the cytoplasmic tail of the membrane-associated sheddase. (5) Activation of sheddase:
  Sheddases belonging to the ADAM or MMP family are activated by removal of the prodomain
  by furin and furin-like PCs in the trans Golgi compartment and also at the cell
  surface. (6) Intracellular trafficking of sheddase: TACE/ADAM17 is trafficked to
  the cell surface in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. For example, gastrin-releasing
  peptide activates a Src-PI3K-PDK pathway that induces Ser/Thr phosphorylation and
  promotes ADAM translocation to the cell surface. (7) Mobilization to specific membrane
  compartments: The substrate and sheddase can be secreted or sequestered in a polarized
  fashion to a specific membrane compartment on the cell surface or in intracellular
  compartments, which can accelerate the encounter of sheddase and substrate. (8)
  Interaction with modifying proteins on an adjacent cell: Binding of DSL ligand to
  heterodimeric Notch on an adjacent cell induces the endocytosis of the Notch-DSL
  ligand complex by DSL ligand expressing cells, providing a mechanical force to dissociate
  heterodimeric Notch and activate Notch shedding and signaling.'
