caption: Adenovirus VA RNA inhibition of both the Interferon/PKR pathway. VA RNAs
  (with imperfect-stemloop secondary structure) inhibit IFN-induced PKR signaling
  leading to downstream eIF2α phosphorylation and ultimate protein translation inhibition.
  Ras signaling via MEK and its substrate ERK may also inhibit IFN-induced PKR activation
  by preventing PKR phosphorylation. Additionally, VA RNAs may also be processed into
  siRNAs and inhibit the functionality of the host cell’s Dicer/RISC RNAi pathway,
  thus blocking degradation of short viral dsRNAs as well as the cell’s endogenous
  miRNA/siRNA synthesis pathway.
