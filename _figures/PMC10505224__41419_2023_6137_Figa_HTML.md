caption: By hindering hnRNPA2B1 from binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21, whose
  mediated ubiquitin-dependent degradation was thereby inhibited, CRNDE protected
  the stability of hnRNPA2B1’s high protein expression in CRC. Supported by the high
  level of the oncogenic molecule CRNDE, hnRNPA2B1 bound to KRAS mRNA and promoted
  KRAS mRNA nucleus export to enter the ribosomal translation program, subsequently
  activating the MAPK signaling pathway and ultimately accelerating the malignant
  progression of CRC.
