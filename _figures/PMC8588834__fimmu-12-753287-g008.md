caption: G-protein coupled receptor (GPR109A, GPR43 and GPR41) is predominantly expressed
  on epithelial and immune cells. GPR is activated by its ligand short chain fatty
  acids (SCFAs). In absence of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Abx), beneficial commensals
  produce SCFAs that activate GPR pathway. SCFA engage GPR-NLRP3 pathway for the maintainance
  of epithelial barrier. SCFA also engage GPR on immune cells to induce regulatory
  T cells. Patients who do not receive Abx show an upregulation of GPR expression
  in the presence of aGvHD suggesting a counterregulatory mechanism. Abx suppresses
  commensals leading to reduced SCFA hence less GPR. GPR-NLRP3 axis and GPR-Tregs
  axis are strongly abrogated by Abx. Abx also interfere with the upregulation of
  GPR during aGvHD.
