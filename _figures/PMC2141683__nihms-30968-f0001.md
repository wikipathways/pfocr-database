caption: After entry to cells, galactose is phosphorylated by galactokinase (GALK)
  to form galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-p). In the presence of galactose-1-phosphate
  uridyltransferase (GALT), gal-1-p reacts with UDP-glucose to form UDP-galactose
  (UDP-gal) and glucose-1-phosphate (Glu-1-p). Glucose-1-phosphate formed can either
  enter glycolysis or react with UTP to yield a new molecule of UDP-glucose in the
  presence of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP). UDP-galactose can also be produced
  from UDP-glucose directly by UDP-glucose-4-epimerase (GALE). Gal-1-p can also be
  dephosphorylated by inositol monophosphatase (IMPase).
