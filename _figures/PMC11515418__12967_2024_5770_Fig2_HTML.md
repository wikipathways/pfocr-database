caption: 'mtDNA damage signals can regulate the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells
  to platinum-based drug by modulating the cGAS/STING pathway and cell death signaling
  pathways. In addition to the apoptotic signaling pathway, signals derived from damaged
  mtDNA could potentially impact the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to platinum-based
  drugs by influencing antitumor immunity and the cell’s responsiveness to other cell
  death signals. GSH: glutathione; PUFAs: Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids'
