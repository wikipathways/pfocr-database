caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) network diagram of differentially expressed
  genes in patient vs. control buccal biopsies. The gene expression analysis was conducted
  on 4 APECED patient and 2 control buccal biopsy samples. Differentially regulated
  genes were analyzed by IPA. Network analysis with the highest score consisted of
  23 focus molecules and 12 interconnecting molecules. Network, which had the highest
  score (score 51), was categorized by IPA function: “antimicrobial response, cellular
  function and maintenance, inflammatory response.” Two genes were considered to be
  connected if there was a path in the network between them. The intensity of the
  gene color indicates the degree of upregulation (red) or downregulation (green)
  of a given gene. The legend of figure shapes and relationships can be found in .'
