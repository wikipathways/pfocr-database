caption: Multifaceted roles of βC1 in the scope of viral pathogenesis. A schematic
  model depicting the roles of pathogenicity determinant, βC1 in successful pathogenesis.
  In the host cell, βC1 interacts with ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 1 (AS1) in the molecular
  disguise of ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 (AS2), thereby affecting the jasmonic acid (JA)
  response and the leaf polarity leading to symptom development (1). The interaction
  of βC1 with MYC2 diminishes the dimerization of MYC2 and subsequent downstream expression
  of terpene biosynthesis genes is hampered (2). The βC1 protein‐mediated inhibition
  of syntheses of JA and terpenes attributes to its influences on virus‐host‐vector
  tripartite interaction. βC1 acts as a strong suppressor of RNA silencing and affects
  both transcriptional and post‐transcriptional gene silencing (TGS and PTGS) machinery
  of the host. βC1 suppresses PTGS by inducing the host rgs‐CAM expression and repressing
  RDR6 (3). βC1 suppresses TGS by interacting with S‐adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase
  (SAHH), a methyl cycle enzyme. βC1 inhibits SAHH enzyme activity and eventually
  impedes the production of S‐adenosyl homocysteine (SAM), an active methyl group
  donor for methylation (4). As a defence mechanism, host SnRK1 protein phosphorylates
  βC1, thereby inactivating its ability to act as a suppressor of TGS and PTGS (5).
  The host RING‐E3 ubiquitin‐ligase (RFP1) polyubiquitinates and degrade the βC1 protein
  through the ubiquitin/26S proteasome system. βC1 interferes with host ubiquitin‐proteasome
  pathway via interaction with ubiquitin conjugase E2 (6). βC1 interacts with SKP1
  inhibiting SKP1‐CUL1 interaction, and obstructs the SCF‐E3 ligase complex formation,
  and subsequently preventing the UPS‐mediated viral protein degradation (7). The
  chloroplast‐mediated defence response is hampered as the ultrastructure and function
  of the organelle are damaged. The expression of various important host genes including
  those involved in photosynthesis and defence are impeded by βC1 (8). Differential
  regulation of diverse set miRNAs that are responsive to betasatellite infection
  contributes to disease symptom development (9). The various strategies adopted by
  βC1 to counter the plant defence correlate to its role in pathogenicity determination,
  the establishment of disease and the symptom development. CH3 indicates methylation,
  (P) indicated phosphorylation, and (U) indicates ubiquitination.
