caption: Ferroptosis in Tumor Immunity. Ferroptosis enhances the release of HMGB1
  and ATP from tumor cells, boosting proliferation, activation, and immunogenicity
  of dendritic cells (DCs). Activated CD8+ T cells secrete IFN-γ, which downregulates
  the expression of system Xc- subunits SLC3A2 and SLC7A11 in cancer cells, increases
  lipid peroxidation, and heightens sensitivity to ferroptosis. Increased expression
  of CD36 on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells promotes fatty acid uptake via a CD36-dependent
  pathway, leading to accumulation of intracellular lipid peroxides and promoting
  ferroptosis. Ferroptotic tumor cells induce M1 polarization of macrophages, releasing
  TNF to enhance inflammation and immune response. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs)
  transfer granules containing peroxidases to tumor cells, causing accumulation of
  iron-dependent lipid peroxides and inducing ferroptosis
