caption: Schematic depicting how PC1/3 knockdown impacts macrophage activation based
  on the data presented in –. PC1/3 knockdown promotes the formation of endosomes
  and MVB release of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines via the noncanonical secretion
  pathway (1). Danger signal molecules (DAMs) can activate TLR4 (2) and induce the
  MyD88-dependent pathway with increased NF-κB (3) nuclear translocation (4) linked
  to Ca2+ mobilization in PC1/3 KD macrophages (5). Both of these phenomena are also
  implicated in cytokines, chemokines, DAMs and tumor viability inhibitor release
  (6) as well as cytoskeletal rearrangements leading to the formation of filopodia
  (7). We then noticed that during LPS challenge, the amplification loop was amplified
  and driven toward the induction of increased Ca2+ release from the ER, greater numbers
  of filopodia and MVBs, the release of additional immune factors, an M1 phenotype
  refractive to IL-10 inhibition and a greater number of anti-tumor factors.
