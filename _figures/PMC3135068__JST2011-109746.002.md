caption: Negative feedback regulation of MAPK signaling mediated by an RNA-binding
  protein Rnc1. Rnc1 binds to the UCAU repeats located in the 3′-UTR of the Pmp1 mRNA.
  The activated Pmk1 phosphorylates Rnc1, leading to the enhanced activity of Rnc1,
  thereby binding to and stabilizing an otherwise unstable Pmp1 mRNA. Upregulated
  Pmp1 dephosphorylates and inactivates Pmk1, thus creating a negative-feedback loop
  that regulates the MAPK signalling.
