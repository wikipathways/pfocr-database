caption: Sub-network found among the genes in a differential expression experiment
  that compares FA patients to controls. (A) Genes up-regulated in FA. A total of
  44 of 55 highly expressed genes are densely connected to a big network component
  (P = 0.0015), comprising 560 proteins. These genes are related to ribosome and spliceosome
  processes. (B) A total of 24 of 30 genes significantly down-regulated in FA (P = 0.041),
  connected by 70 intermediate proteins conforms the network which is differentially
  more expressed in controls than in FA. As mentioned in the text, some of these genes
  are related to the mTOR signalling pathway (in green) and to the Chronic myeloid
  leukaemia pathway (in red).
