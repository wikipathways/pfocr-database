caption: 'Metabolomics analysis of the mechanisms of hUCMSC treatment for POI. The

  of the hUCMSC-treated group compared to those of the POI group. a Map of regulation
  pathways involved in total metabolite. b Map of regulatory pathways between amino
  acids, purines, pyrimidines, and carbohydrate metabolism. Significantly upregulated
  metabolites are shown in red, significantly downregulated metabolites are shown
  in blue, and nonsignificant different metabolites are shown in black. The names
  in bold are the relevant metabolites detected in the nontarget/target metabolomics
  analysis. The substance in the red ellipse represents the enzyme or its corresponding
  protein. The solid arrow indicates that metabolites (enzymes/proteins and metabolites)
  have a direct relationship with each other, while the dotted arrow indicates a distant
  relationship. Tissues or parts of metabolic processes (such as lysosomes) are represented
  by solid frames, and related pathways (such as glycerolipid pathways) are represented
  by dotted frames. The underlined metabolites represent the metabolites that recovered
  after hUCMSC transplantation compared to the changes after POI induction. The green
  arrows represent the paths recovered. Abbreviations: Cer, N-acylsphingosine; DG,
