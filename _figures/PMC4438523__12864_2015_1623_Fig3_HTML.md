caption: The “Actin Cytoskeleton Signaling” pathway highlighting differentially expressed
  genes of birds affected with Wooden Breast myopathy. Canonical pathways were identified
  and depicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA®) software. This pathway shows the
  “Actin Cytoskeleton Signaling” as related to significant differentially expressed
  genes in affected birds from the sample population. Genes that are highlighted in
  green are considered to be downregulated in affected birds. Genes that are highlighted
  in red are considered to be upregulated in affected birds
