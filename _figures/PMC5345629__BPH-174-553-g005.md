caption: Validation and interaction networks of the differentially expressed miRNAs.
  (A) Confirmation of miRNA expression levels by qRT‐PCR. The data are presented as
  the mean ± SD (n = 5). *P < 0.05, significantly different from control groups. (B)
  The interaction networks of the 11 differentially expressed miRNAs and their target
  genes. The up‐regulated miRNAs were marked in red, and the down‐regulated miRNAs
  were marked in green. Akt1 is marked in yellow in a red circle.
