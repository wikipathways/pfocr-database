caption: A model for cyclin E degradation regulated by two E3 ligases. Both Cul1 and
  Cul3 are involved the regulation of cyclin E levels in mammalian cells. There are
  two possible mechanisms for these two ligase complexes to share a substrate. One,
  the parallel pathway model shown in the upper panel, would propose that both complexes
  work on the ubiquitination of cyclin E independently through different degrons and
  signaling pathways. In this model, both ligases are required for efficient degradation;
  however, loss of either one results in a modest reduction in cyclin E levels. The
  other model, the cooperative pathway shown in the lower panel, suggests that both
  complexes are needed, either because one passes the substrate to the other or each
  one marks cyclin E differently, and both sets of signals are required for efficient
  degradation. Ubiquitin molecules are represented by the multiple red spheres attached
  to cyclin E.
