caption: a ∣ Model based on the influential proposal by Albin and colleagues, according
  to which the output of the basal ganglia is determined by the balance between the
  direct pathway — which involves direct striatonigral inhibitory connections that
  promote behaviour — and the indirect pathway — which involves relays in the external
  globus pallidus (GPe) and subthalamic nucleus (STN), and suppresses behaviour. The
  balance between these two projections was thought to be regulated by afferent dopaminergic
  signals from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental
  area (VTA) acting on differentially distributed D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. b
