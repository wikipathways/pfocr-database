caption: Two-stage reduction of biopterin (BIO) to 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (DHB) and
  5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (THB) catalyzed by PTR1 and of folate (FOL) to 7,8-dihydrofolate
  (DHF) and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (THF) catalyzed by both dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate
  synthase (DHFR-TS) and PTR1. Enzymes are shown next to the reactions that they catalyze.
  The thicker arrows indicate that the enzyme can contribute to the metabolic step
  only under specific metabolic conditions. Indeed, DHFR-TS is mainly responsible
  for the folate-reduction pathway, whereas PTR1 accounts for the biopterin one, being
  involved in the folate-reduction subsequently to DHFR inhibition.
