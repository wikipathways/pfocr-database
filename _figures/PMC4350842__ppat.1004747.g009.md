caption: (A) (a) During infection, B. abortus triggers the activation of IRE1, presumably
  by secreting effector molecules into the cytoplasm of host cells through a secretion
  system. (b) IRE1 molecules form high-order complexes at ERES with the aid of Yip1A,
  which are activated by autophosphorylation. (c) The activated IRE1 in turn triggers
  the biogenesis of ER-derived vacuoles. Atg9 and WIPI1 may be recruited to the IM
  at ERES, and support the formation of ER-derived vacuoles. The upregulation of the
  COPII components Sar1, Sec23 and Sec24 could facilitate the formation of such vacuoles.
  (d) The ER-derived vacuoles then fuse with endolysosomal vesicles. Given that B.
  abortus that have reached the ER are located in late endosomal/lysosomal compartments,
  they should be able to fuse with these vacuoles. (e) Once they have acquired the
  ER-derived membrane, BCVs retain functional features of the ER, and multiplication
  of B. abortus in individual vacuoles might be supported through continual accretion
  of ER membranes derived from the IRE1-specific UPR. (B) Knockdown of Yip1A prevents
  the activation of IRE1. Consequently, ER-derived membranes are not generated for
  bacterial replication and B. abortus remains in endosomal/lysosomal compartments.
  (C) Knockdown of IRE1 leads to loss of the activation of IRE1. Consequently, ER-derived
  membranes are not generated for bacterial replication and B. abortus remains in
  endosomal/lysosomal compartments.
