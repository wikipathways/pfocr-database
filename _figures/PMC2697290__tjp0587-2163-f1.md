caption: Cl− channels and their corresponding molecular entities or candidates are
  indicated. ClC-3, a member of voltage-gated ClC Cl− channel family, encodes Cl−
  channels that are volume regulated (ICl,vol) and can be activated by cell swelling
  (ICl,swell) induced by exposure to hypotonic extracellular solutions or possibly
  membrane stretch. ICl,b is a basally activated ClC-3 Cl− current. ClC-2, a member
  of voltage-gated ClC Cl− channel family, is responsible for a volume-regulated and
  hyperpolarization-activated inward rectifying Cl− current (ICl,ir). Membrane topology
  models (α-helices a-r) for ClC-3 and ClC-2 are modified from . ICl,acid is a Cl−
  current regulated by extracellular pH and the molecular entity for ICl,acid is currently
  unknown. ICl,Ca is a Cl− current activated by increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration
  ([Ca2+]i); Molecular candidates for ICl,Ca include CLCA1, a member of a Ca2+-sensitive
  Cl− channel family (CLCA), bestrophin-2, a member of the bestrophin gene family,
  and TMEM16, transmembrane protein 16. CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator, encodes Cl− channels activated by stimulation of cAMP–protein kinase
  A (PKA) pathway (ICl,PKA), protein kinase C (PKC) (ICl,PKC), or extracellular ATP
  through purinergic receptors (ICl,ATP). CFTR is composed of two membrane spanning
  domains (MSD1 and MSD2), two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) and a regulatory
  subunit (R). P, phosphorylation sites for PKA and PKC; PP, serine–threonine protein
  phosphatases; Gi, heterodimeric inhibitory G protein; A1R, adenosine type 1 receptor;
  AC, adenylyl cyclase; H2R, histamine type II receptor; Gs, heterodimeric stimulatory
  G protein; β-AR, β-adrenergic receptor; P2R, purinergic type 2 receptor; proposed
  intracellular signalling pathway for purinergic activation of CFTR. VDAC, voltage-dependent
  anion channels (porin); mito, mitochondrion.
