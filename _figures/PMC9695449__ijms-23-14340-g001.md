caption: Legend. Complement-Glycosphingolipid Axis leads to the tissue inflammation
  in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Gaucher Disease (GD). The
  interaction of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with
  its cellular receptor (e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme-2; ACE2) triggers the
  massive generation of complement 5a (C5a) by SARS-CoV-2 and/or glycosphingolipid
  (GSL; glucosylceramide; GC)-specific immunoglobulin G1 immune complexes (SARS-CoV-2/GSL-IgG1-ICs)-mediated
  classical, SARS-CoV-2-IgM-ICs-mediated alternative, and crosslinking of SARS-CoV-2
  mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-mediated lectin pathway of complement activation (A,B).
  The interaction of C5a and its C5aR1 receptor triggers glucosylceramide synthase
  (GCS)-mediated excess synthesis of GSLs, which ameliorates SARS-CoV-2 replication
  (C), as well as the overproduction of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors (D).
  These pro-inflammatory mediators cause excess tissue recruitment and activation
  of innate and adaptive immune cells, i.e., polymorphonuclear cell (PMN), monocytes
  (MO), macrophage (Mɸ), dendritic cell (DC), T cells, and the resulting excess production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines (E; and listed in , ,  and ) and tissue destruction
  in patients with COVID-19 and GD patients with COVID-19 (F). Accordingly, the combined
  targeting of C5a–C5aR1 and/or GSL synthesis pathway could stop the SARS-CoV-2-mediated
  tissue inflammation and organ damage in patients with COVID-19 and GD patients with
  COVID-19.
