caption: 'Several mechanisms may account for the toxic effects of saturated fatty
  acids: 1. Palmitic Acid is used by Serine Palmitoyl Transferase to generate cytoplasmic
  ceramide, which activates JNK1/2 that interacts with Bax in the mitochondrial membrane
  and results in the release of cytochrome C due to reduction of cardiolipin (ceramide-dependent
  mechanism). 2. Palmitic acid can inhibit AMPK, which increases malonyl-CoA levels,
  inhibits CPT-1, and causes accumulation of fatty acids and lipotoxicity. 3. Palmitic
  acid contributes to the increase of DAG that induces the upregulation of PKC. PKC
  inhibits the insulin-signaling pathway by blocking IRS-1. 4. The insulin-signaling
  pathway can be inhibited by ceramide-mediated increased PP2A, which dephosphorylates
  (inactivates) the anti-apoptotic PKB/Akt; inhibition of PKB/Akt may induce apoptosis.
  Dephosphorylated Akt reduces AMPK activity that can lead to lipotoxicity (see above).
  5. Palmitic acid may be incorporated into phospholipid and TG species in microsomal
  membranes, resulting in compromised ER membrane integrity and redistribution of
  protein-folding chaperones to the cytosol (ER stress). 6. Esterification of palmitate
  can also cause ER fission directly. Intensive ER stress may result in apoptosis.'
