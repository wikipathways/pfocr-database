caption: Bone is a tissue that consists of diverse cell types (osteoblasts, osteoclasts)
  that interact in a complex manner. In particular, bone marrow-derived stem cells
  differentiate into osteoblasts, which in turn are converted into osteocytes following
  their incorporation into the mineralized matrix. As cells age, they undergo apoptosis
  or senescence. An imbalance between osteoclasts and osteoblasts may result in the
  development of fragile porous bone. RANKL is required for osteoclastogenesis, whereas
  OPG hinders the osteoclast route. Sclerostin, the Wnt pathway, SERM and estrogen
  are key factors involved in the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts. When sclerostin
  antibodies are present owing to their production by osteocytes, the Wnt signaling
  pathway renders osteoblastogenesis inactive. ER, estrogen receptor; MSC, mesenchymal
  stem cell; OPG, osteoprotegerin; PTH, parathyroid hormone; RANKL, receptor activator
  of nuclear factor-κB ligand; SERM, selective estrogen receptor modulator.
