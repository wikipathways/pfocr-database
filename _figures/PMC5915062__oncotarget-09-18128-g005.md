caption: The pathway analysis resulted in the finding of the network “DNA Replication,
  Recombination, and Repair” containing 27 out of the 140 significant proteins. The
  network itself consists of 35 proteins. The up-regulated proteins in late stage
  cervical cancer are marked red and two proteins which were up-regulated in healthy
  epithelial cells are indicated with a green color. The intensity of the color (red
  or green) relates to fold-change. Proteins (n = 5) indicated with a red asterisk
  have been identified minimal once (99% protein- and 95% peptide probability with
  at least one peptide) by LCM, although not differential. The symbols shown in the
  network are explained at http://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis
