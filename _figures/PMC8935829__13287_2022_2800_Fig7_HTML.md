caption: Ex-4 and ED-71 synergistically promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs
  through M2 macrophages polarization via PI3K/AKT pathway. Ex-4 and ED-71 synergistically
  activate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to polarize macrophages into M2, thereby
  producing a large amount of TGF-β1. Subsequently, BMSCs migrate and undergo osteogenic
  differentiation under the action of TGF-β1. In addition, the combination of these
  two drugs can synergistically reduce blood glucose levels to indirectly improve
  diabetic osteoporosis. Ex-4 Exendin-4, ED-71 Eldecalcitol, GLP-1R glucagon like
  peptide-1 receptor, VDR vitamin D receptor, PI3K phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,
  AKT protein kinase B, TGF-β1 Transforming growth factor-β1, BMSCs bone marrow mesenchymal
  stem cells, ALP alkaline phosphatase, Col I collagen I
