caption: 'Downregulation of TGFβ pathway genes in iMYC cells. (A) Network analysis
  of the iMYC signature showed that a large number of the 263 commonly downregulated
  genes form a broad functional network as indicated by the connecting lines, each
  representing a known literature-based link between the genes (Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis database). A color key defining the types of interactions between the genes
  is shown. The network centered around the TGFβ pathway is enlarged for better visualization
  and the genes are highlighted in blue to show direct involvement in TGFβ signaling
  or in gray to show indirect association with the pathway. Other major nodes are
  centered around IL-6 and IGF-1 (schematics of these pathways and the genes that
  are altered in iMYC cells are shown in ). (B) Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)
  analysis of genes in the iMYC signature that are involved in TGFβ signaling. Two
  of the three iMYC cell lines (iMYC 1: black bars; iMYC 2: gray bars) that were used
  in microarray experiments were used for qPCR validation. Expression levels are normalized
  to GAPDH and shown relative to expression levels of eMYC cells set as “1.”'
