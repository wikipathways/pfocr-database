caption: Schematic diagram depicting the polyamine metabolic pathway. Spermidine (Spd)
  and spermine (Spm) are synthesized by the sequential addition of aminopropyl groups
  derived from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM) onto putrescine (Put) and
  Spd to form Spd and Spm, respectively. Catabolism of polyamines proceeds via the
  backconversion pathway or via the 1-step Spm oxidation by spermine oxidase (SMO).
  In the spermidine/spermine N-1-acetyltransferase (SSAT)/polyamine oxidase (PAO)-mediated
  polyamine backconversion pathway, Spm and Spd are first acetylated by SSAT, the
  rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway, and then oxidized by PAO, leading to Put and
  cytotoxic by-products (i.e., H2O2, acetyl-3-aminopropionaldehyde). SAM, S-adenosylmethionine;
  SAMDC, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase; MTA, 5-methylthioadenosine; ODC, ornithine
  decarboxylase.
