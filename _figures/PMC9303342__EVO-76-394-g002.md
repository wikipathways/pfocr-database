caption: How progesterone changes the effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling
  in endometrial stromal cells. Prostaglandin E2 is an inflammatory signal that is
  produced in response to the presence of an implanting embryo. The endometrial fibroblasts
  usually express the PTGER4 receptor, which activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  that is supporting proliferation. However, in the presence of progesterone, which
  indicates that ovulation has happened and an embryo could be on its way, the stromal
  fibroblast expresses PTGER2, which signals through the cAMP/PKA pathway supporting
  differentiation. PGE2, in conjunction with progesterone, is thus signaling to the
  stromal cells that an embryo is likely implanting and that it should differentiate
  into a decidual stromal cell (modified after fig. 7 in Stadtmauer and Wagner, ).
