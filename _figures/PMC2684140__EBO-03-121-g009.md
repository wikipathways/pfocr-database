caption: Schematic representation of the S. cerevisiae RAM network. The protein kinase
  Kic1 associates with the proteins Sog2 and Hym1 to form a complex necessary for
  proper localization and function of Cbk1. In analogy to its counterpart Cdc15 in
  the MEN network, Kic1 likely activates Cbk1 directly. Pag1 interacts with Kic1 and
  Cbk1 facilitating its activation. Cbk1 requires the interaction with Mob2 for activation
  and to regulate the transcription factor Ace2, essential for cell separation to
  occur, through the transcription of genes involved in cell wall synthesis in a daughter
  cell specific way. The Cbk-Mob2 complex also regulates polarized growth of cells,
  proper bud site selection and formation of mating projections through a largely
  uncharacterized Ace2 independent pathway.
