caption: 'Functional gene networks identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
  from differentially expressed genes between the control and treated discs. (A) Network-1:
  cell death, cell cycle, and DNA replication, recombination, and repair (score 31).
  (B) Network-2: cellular growth and proliferation, tissue development, and cancer
  (score 27). Node color indicates degree of overexpression (red) and the degree of
  downregulation (green). Colored nodes represent genes of focus, whereas genes in
  uncolored nodes were not identified as being differentially expressed and were consequently
  integrated into the networks based on information in the IPA database.'
