caption: A) GNN explainer outputs node and edge importance for each sample. We averaged
  these values across the same age groups used to show test set errors. After averaging,
  we excluded zero-importance nodes and low-importance edges, forming subnetworks
  of connected nodes. Here, we show one such subnetwork and a magnified version. The
  graph is annotated based on its trend of importance (increasing or decreasing) and
  methylation status (hypomethylatng or hypermethylating). See Importance analysis
  section for details. Additionally, we identified the genes of the CpG sites in the
  subnetwork. Based on whether they are hypo- or hypermethylating with age, we separated
  the genes and performed Enrichr analysis. B) Here, we show the pathway analysis
  for the genes that become hypermethylating with age. The analysis indicates that
  the Cardiac Muscle contraction pathway becomes hypermethylating with age, leading
  to reduced gene expression. C) We also identified the pathway of genes that become
  hypomethylating with age as Ovarian steroidogenesis pathway becomes hypomethylating,
  resulting in increased gene expression. These pathways in (B) and (C) also affect
  each other in the aging process which can be seen in (A)
