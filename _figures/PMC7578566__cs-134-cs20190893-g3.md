caption: The diagram highlights the different pathways that ECM proteins activate
  and the downstream targets that potentially contribute to cellular senescence in
  fibrosis. Fibronectin binds to integrin αvβ3 and activates the PI3k/Akt pathway,
  resulting in the inhibition of cellular senescence. Decorin binds to receptor tyrosine
  kinase and activates the RAS/RAF pathway, which eventually leads to the up-regulation
  of the cell-cycle inhibitors p16, p21 and phospo-p53. CCN1 binds to the α6β3 integrin
  which colocalises with HSPG to activate the downstream RAC1 pathway, resulting in
  increases in ROS production. Subsequently, increased levels of ROS leads to a DNA
  damage repair response that induces cell-cycle arrest via increases in p16, p21
  and phospo-p53. Elastin fragments binds to EBP to interact with PPARγ, which lead
  to cell-cycle arrest via changes in the expression of p16. Tenascin-c binds to αvβ3
  and induce the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB which leads to increases
  in apoptosis resistance as well as the up-regulation of growth factor and cytokine
  expression. Fibulin-1 may increase ROS production leading to cell-cycle arrest while
  limiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway which protects against senescence. Periostin
  can directly activate the TGF-β pathway which leads to increase production of profibrotic
  factors. Laminin can directly activate the TGF-β pathway leading to profibrotic
  factor production and NF-κB activation which reinforce growth factor production
  and resistance to apoptosis.
