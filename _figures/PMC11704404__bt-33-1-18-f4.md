caption: 'Antioxidant Response via AMPK/Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathway. Under basal conditions,
  Nrf2, a master regulator of antioxidant response genes through the Antioxidant Response
  Element (ARE), is suppressed by KEAP1, which promotes its ubiquitination and degradation
  via E3 ligase activity. In response to oxidative stress, AMPK is activated and plays
  a dual role in promoting Nrf2 activity: it directly phosphorylates Nrf2 at specific
  serine residues, such as Ser448, and indirectly prevents its degradation by inhibiting
  the GSK-3β/βTrCP axis. This AMPK-mediated activation of Nrf2 leads to the enhanced
  expression of antioxidant genes, including HO-1, NQO-1, and SOD, which protect cells
  from oxidative damage caused by carbon monoxide, ROS, and hydrogen peroxide. Nuclear
