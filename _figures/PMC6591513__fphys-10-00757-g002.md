caption: Integration of TRP channel involvement in mechanotransduction-associated
  mechanisms during cell migration. Some TRP channels interact with proteins at focal
  adhesions and/or with the actin cytoskeleton. These associations might lead to focal
  adhesion turnover and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement through a mechanism involving
  the conducting function of TRP channels, whereby Ca2+ influx plays a key role. In
  addition, non-conducting effects of TRP channels might contribute to regulation
  of focal adhesions and actin dynamics during cell migration. The putative role of
  TRP channels as structural component or “transduction hubs” in these mechanosensitive
  structures appears as a novel perspective to understand the involvement of these
  channels in mechanotransduction during cell migration. Furthermore, TRP channels
  could promote pro-migratory long-term effects by gene reprogramming (e.g., Hippo
  pathway- and/or NFAT activation-mediated), representing a putative new mechanism
  through which these ion channels could contribute to cell migration.
