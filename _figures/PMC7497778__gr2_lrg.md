caption: Functions of HSCARG in the cytoplasm. (A) HSCARG blocks signal transduction
  in innate immunity. In canonical NF-κB signaling, HSCARG cooperates with USP7 and
  PP2A to inhibit the K63-polyubiqutination of NEMO and phosphorylation of IKKβ, thereby
  decreasing the activity of IKK complex, repressing the degradation of IκBα, and
  restraining NF-κB in the cytoplasm. In RLR pathway, HSCARG stimulates the deubiquitination
  of TRAF3 by OTUB1, which further attenuates the phosphorylation of IKKε and IRF3,
  and finally decreases the production of type I interferons; (B) HSCARG is involved
  in intracellular NADPH homeostasis. Decrease in NADPH concentration leads to disaggregation
  of HSCARG dimer into monomers, and thus activates its functions. HSCARG reduces
  overproduction of NO and ROS via suppressing the activity of ASS and blocking the
  transcription of p47phox, respectively.
