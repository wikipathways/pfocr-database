caption: 'Gene regulatory networks are altered in the human oocytes that are delayed
  in their maturation. (A) Canonical pathways predicted by IPA using the differentially
  expressed gene (DEG) list of MII versus dMII. Significant terms are indicated in
  red colors: the darker the color, the more significant the term is (p < 0.05, Fisher''s
  exact test). Closely related terms are connected to each other. A green arrow indicates
  Sirtuin signaling pathway as explained in the relevant text. (B) Downstream targets
  of SMARCA4 were found in the DEG list by IPA. Gene regulatory networks of SMARCA4
  in human oocytes were predicted. SMARCA4 affects molecules indicated at the end
  of arrows, blue arrows mean ‘Leads to inhibition’, black arrows mean “Effect not
  predicted.” Molecules colored green are downregulated in dMII samples'
