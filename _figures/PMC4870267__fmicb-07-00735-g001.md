caption: '(A) Proposed scytonemin biosynthetic pathway. The names of the enzymes (proved
  and speculative) involved in the process are written next to the arrows that symbolize
  reactions catalyzed by them. Bold numbers label the intermediate compounds. (B)
  Physical map of the Nostoc punctiforme genomic region containing the 18-gene cluster
  associated with scytonemin production. The arrows represent ORFs and are filled
  according to the following functional categories: white are scytonemin core genes,
  light gray are genes associated with aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, and dark
  gray are putative regulators. Upside down triangles depict approximate locations
  of the in-frame deletion mutants constructed in this study while the right side
  up triangle shows the scytoneminless insertion mutant, SCY 59, obtained previously
  () and used for comparison purposes in this study.'
