caption: 'PGE2 synthesis, receptors, transport, and metabolism in granulosa cells.
  Left: PGE2 synthesis enzymes (blue) are associated with membranes of the nuclear
  envelope (not shown) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). PLA2G4A cleaves arachidonic
  acid (AA) from membrane phospholipids. PTGS2 converts AA into PGH2. PTGES converts
  PGH2 into bioactive PGE2. PGE2 is converted to an inactive metabolite (15-keto-PGE2)
  by HPGD (purple). Right: PGE2 acts via four PGE2 receptors (PTGER1, PTGER2, PTGER3,
  and PTGER4, green). Each PTGER couples to a subset of G proteins (purple); most
  frequently used and major intracellular signals are shown for plasma membrane PTGERs.
  PTGERs can also be located in the membranes of the ER and nucleus; G proteins also
  couple with PTGERs in these locations (not shown). On both panels, multiple methods
  of PGE2 transport across the plasma membrane have been proposed (blue) and are discussed
  in the text. [Adapted with permission from Duffy DM. Novel contraceptive targets
