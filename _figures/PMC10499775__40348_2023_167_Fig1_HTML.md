caption: Illustration of the Fas-FasL pathway. Fas (CD95) is a trimeric receptor of
  the tumor TNF-R family and after binding of the Fas ligand (FasL, CD95L), recruits
  the adaptor FADD, which in turn forms the so-called DISC together with pro-caspase-8
  and pro-caspase-10. Following activation, caspase-8 and caspase-10 then initiate
  the extrinsic apoptotic pathway leading to proteolysis, DNA degradation, and apoptosis.
  Mutations in the genes responsible for the Fas-FasL signaling cascade (FAS, FASLG,
  FADD, CASP10) lead to the development of ALPS. Hallmarks of the disease are increased
  ALPS biomarkers (Vitamin B12 and sFasL), as well as a massive expansion of double-negative
  T cells (DNT). Increased AKT/mTOR activation leads to DNT hyperproliferation and
  can be inhibited via mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus (rapamycin)
