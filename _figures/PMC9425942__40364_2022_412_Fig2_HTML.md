caption: Reprogramming the metabolic process of glucose in lung cancer. In addition
  to HIF-1α pathway，PPARy and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling impair the activity of enzymes
  and transporters limiting metabolic reprogramming in NSCLC. In the cell, glucose
  is transported by glucose transporters (GLUT)1 and 4. Glycolysis begins with the
  phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase (HK). In the cycle of pentose phosphate
  (PPP), glucose-6-phosphate is converted into nucleosides and NADPH by glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PD). Dephosphorylating PEP is accomplished by pyruvate kinase (PK)
  at the end of the glycolytic pathway to synthesize pyruvate and ATP. After that,
  pyruvate is turned into lactate by-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Lactate is delivered
  to the outside of the cell by monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) 1 and 4. During
  metabolism, pyruvate can be converted into acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which
  is following used by the tricarboxylic acid cycle in mitochondria to give rise to
  ATP and intermediate molecules that are essential to the biosynthesis of both lipids
  and amino acids. Figure created using BioRender.com
