caption: (A) RAS/RAF/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway mutations occurred in 55% of tumors,
  and the incidence of mutation in each component of the pathway is indicated. Oncogenic
  alterations are shown in red; tumor suppressor alterations are shown in blue. All
  alterations were somatic mutations, with the exception of amplification events for
  RHEB and BRAF and deletion events for NF1. (B) DNA damage and DNA repair pathways
  were mutated in 38% of tumors, and the incidence of mutation in each component of
  the pathway is indicated. Gene mutations involved in DNA damage are shown in blue.
  Mutations in DNA repair pathways occurred in homologous recombination (orange),
  nucleotide excision repair (green), mismatch repair (brown), and DNA strand cross-link
  repair (red). (C) Epigenetic-modifying gene mutations occurred in 33 tumors (59%),
  by either chromatin modification (55%) or DNA modification (9%); the incidence of
  mutation in each component of the pathway is indicated. Chromatin-modifying mutations
  occurred in chromatin-modifying complexes, such as the SWI/SNF complex (red), histone
  acetyltransferases (green), methyltransferases (blue), histone deacetylases (purple),
  and demethylases (brown), as well as in histones themselves. DNAmodifying mutations
  occurred in DNA methyltransferases (yellow) and demethylases (orange).
