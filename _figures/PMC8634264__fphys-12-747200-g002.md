caption: Schematic representation of the main molecular pathways activated by SARS-CoV-2
  and aerobic physical exercise and their respective consequences. On the right of
  the panel, the SARS-CoV-2 is shown, which relies upon ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to enter
  the host cells. SARS-CoV-2 upregulates the expression of ACE1/Ang-II/AT1R and inhibits
  the MasR which results in exacerbating inflammatory response. Contrarily, a shifted
  RAS balance toward the ACE2/Ang 1–7/Mas receptor axis after aerobic physical exercise
  was a reason for defensive outcomes. Furthermore, exercise activates PGC-1α-FNDC5/Irisin
  pathway. Irisin play an important role in anti-inflammatory pathways including Nrf2.
  Nrf2 results in transformation of cells subject to oxidative stress. In normal circumstances,
  Nrf2 is placed in the cytoplasm bound to its Keap1, which is its inhibitor. When
  ROS caused by exercise is available, the Keap1 and Nrf2 connection detaches and
  Nrf2 moves to the nucleus, where it arouses the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
  activity. MIAE, Moderate intensity aerobic exercise; ACE2, Angiotensin converting
  enzyme2; Ang II, Angiotensin II; Ang 1–7, Angiotensin 1–7; AT1R, Angiotensin II
  receptor type 1; MAS R, Mas receptor; ROS, Reactive Oxygen Species; FNDC5, fibronectin
  type III domain-containing protein 5; PGC-1α, Peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha; TMPRSS2, Transmembrane serine protease 2; Nrf2,
  nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2; KEAP1, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
