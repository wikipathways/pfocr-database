caption: (A) The i-UPR pathway. Many conditions such as exogenous drug treatment,
  nutrient deprivation, viral infection, or protein overexpression block or overwhelm
  protein-folding reactions in the ER and result in ER stress. In this study, we used
  tunicamycin to block protein folding so as to activate the UPR. Following ER stress,
  ire-1 and xbp-1 act in a linear pathway that dominates the transcriptional response
  (total of 139 target genes with known functions), inducing genes that reshape the
  secretory pathway, adjust the metabolic profile, up-regulate functions involved
  in calcium homeostasis and anti-oxidative stress, and regulate other genes that
  might affect cell fate. Interestingly, ten genes require either ire-1 or xbp-1,
  but not both, for their induction upon ER stress. About 21 genes require only pek-1
  for maximal induction, and eight genes regulated by ire-1/xbp-1 also share regulation
  by pek-1. Finally, atf-6 does not play a significant role in the i-UPR pathway (depicted
  by broken arrow). In addition to two genes that were also regulated by ire-1/xbp-1,
  the only gene that depends solely on atf-6 for its induction is cht-1, which encodes
  a chitinase orthologous to human chitotriosidase.(B) The c-UPR pathway. During development,
  active protein synthesis and secretion require the UPR signaling molecules ire-1,
  xbp-1, and atf-6 to maintain the expression of c-UPR genes, defined by the fact
  that they are not up-regulated by tunicamycin but are dependent on ER stress transducers
  for expression. Among the genes with known functions, there are only 12 that overlap
  between the set of 45 genes regulated by ire-1 and the set of 160 genes regulated
  by xbp-1. In addition, atf-6 is required by nine genes that are regulated by ire-1
  and 35 that are genes regulated by xbp-1. Moreover, the expression of 19 genes is
  solely dependent on atf-6, suggesting an important role of atf-6 in the c-UPR pathway.
  By contrast, pek-1 is largely dispensable for regulation of the c-UPR as only nine
  genes require pek-1 in addition to their requirements for ire-1 to maintain basal
  expression.
