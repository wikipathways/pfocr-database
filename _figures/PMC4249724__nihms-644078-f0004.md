caption: Retina regeneration requires the activation of a variety of signaling cascades.
  This diversity of signaling may reflect the variety of injuries and signaling molecules
  that stimulate retina regeneration. Signaling pathways that have been shown to regulate
  retina regeneration are indicated by solid arrows, while those indirectly implicated
  or hypothesized to be involved are indicated by dashed arrows. Secreted factors
  that regulate Müller glia proliferation are indicated outside the cell (those impacting
  Müller glia proliferation in birds/mammals–, but not yet tested in zebrafish are
  annotated with a question mark). Arrows pointing to the top half of the nucleus
  represent pathways that stimulate/maintain Müller glia differentiation/quiescence,
  while arrows pointing to the bottom half of the nucleus represent pathways that
  impact Müller glia reprogramming and proliferation. Wnts are secreted lipid-modified
  glycoproteins that bind Frizzled family receptors to regulate β-catenin stabilization.
  Dkk (Dickkopf) is a secreted Wnt signaling antagonist. Dvl (Dishevled) is a cytoplasmic
  phosphoprotein acting downstream of Wnt receptors. Gsk3β (glycogen synthase kinase
  3β) regulates β-catenin stabilization by phosphorylation. β-catenin regulates cell
  adhesion and gene expression. Insulin and Igf-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) are
  secreted proteins that bind tyrosine kinase receptors that signal via Irs (insulin
  receptor signaling protein), an adapter protein that couples insulin and Igf-1 receptor
  to PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and Akt (protein kinase B) activation. Hbegf
  (heparin binding epidermal-like growth factor) is a transmembrane protein that undergoes
  ectodomain shedding. It is a member of the Egf family of growth factor ligands and
  acts via epidermal growth factor receptors. Fgfs (Fibroblast growth factors) are
  secreted growth factors that bind to fibroblast growth factor receptors. Egf and
  Fgf receptors are tyrosine kinase receptors that signal via Mapk (mitogen activated
  protein kinase) and Erk (extracellular signal regulated kinase). Cytokines are secreted
  proteins that often signal through receptors that lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase
  activity. Cytokine receptors are often coupled to Jak (Janus kinase) activation.
  Jak proteins are non-receptor tyrosine kinases that transduce cytokine-mediated
  signals by phosphorylating Stat proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription).
  Tgfβ (Transforming growth factor-beta) is a secreted protein that signals via the
  Smad pathway to alter gene expression. let-7 is a microRNA that is a posttranscriptional
  regulator of RNA expression. Lin28 is a RNA binding protein that regulates let-7
  microRNA expression. Tnfα (tumor necrosis factor alpha) is a secreted cytokine that
  acts via TNF receptors to regulate cell signaling and gene expression. Delta-Notch
  signaling is mediated by single pass trans-membrane proteins expressed on adjacent
  cells. ECM (extracellular matrix) can signal via transmembrane integrin receptors
  to regulate cell function.
