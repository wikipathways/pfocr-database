caption: 'Carbon metabolism of Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain CBDB1 demonstrating
  the main routes of acetate utilization via acetyl-CoA, gluconeogenesis, and acetyl-CoA
  synthase/CO dehydrogenase (black arrows) and the diverging biosynthetic pathways
  (open arrows). Nε-lysine-acetylated proteins are indicated by red asterisks: A high
  acetylation abundance ratio is indicated by a large asterisk (see ), while multiple
  acetylation sites are denoted by two smaller asterisks () and less abundant acetylation
  by a single, small asterisk (). The incomplete Wood–Ljungdahl pathway displayed
  on the right is a source of C1 carriers, needed e.g., for the synthesis of methionine
  and serine, and might be strongly influenced by the availability of tetrahydrofolate
  (FH4). The locus tags of the enzymes annotated in the genome of strain CBDB1 are
  displayed. The ? signifies that enzymatic activity was demonstrated; however, to
  date, the corresponding enzyme has not been annotated [].'
