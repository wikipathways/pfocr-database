caption: Alterations of RBC glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and glutathione
  and one-carbon metabolism as a function of the age of the mouse. Dots represent
  distinct biological replicates for six- (red), 15- (green), and 25-month-old mice
  (blue). * cross-talk between glutathione homeostasis and glyoxylate pathway. **
  cross-talk between methionine and one-carbon metabolism.
