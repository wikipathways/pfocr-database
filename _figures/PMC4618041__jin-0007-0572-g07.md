caption: A model depicting Dcp1-mediated translational repression in endotoxin-tolerant
  cells. Based on our present and previous findings, LPS stimulation in endotoxin-tolerant
  cells elevates miR-146a, which inactivates p38 MAPK. In the absence of activated
  p38, RBM4 accumulates in the cytosol in an unphosphorylated form, where it binds
  Ago2 and Dcp1 and forms a translational repressor complex at the target mRNA, which
  will then be deposited into p-bodies where translation repression occurs. Note RBM4
  phosphorylation is disrupted in tolerant cells due to induction of the MAPK phosphatase
  MKP-1, which is controlled by miR-146a [, ]. Not shown is the RelB-induced cytokine
  gene transcription repression pathway, which is also induced in parallel as described
  in the first paragraph of Results.
