caption: 'A. Hyperglycemia is considered as the major causal factor in the development
  of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The hyperglycemic milieu activates Rac1-Nox2, generating
  the reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide (O2−). Overactive Rac1-Nox2, along
  with an impaired cytosolic antioxidant defense mechanism, leads to accumulation
  of cytosolic ROS. Right Panel: With diabetes progression, the sustained increase
  in cytosolic ROS damages mitochondrial membranes, proteins, and DNA, leading to
  an imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics. Impaired mtDNA transcription compromises
  the electron transport chain, decreasing mitochondrial function while stimulating
  production of mitochondrial ROS. Mitochondrial damage can stimulate apoptotic cell
  death, as observed in the vascular histopathology associated with DR.B. The retinal
  pigment epithelium (RPE) supplies oxygen and glucose from the choroid (Ch) to the
  photoreceptors (PR). Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) disrupts this system.
  Advanced age, along with numerous genetic and environmental factors, is thought
  to contribute to the development of AMD. In early AMD, an imbalance in RPE reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) damages mitochondrial proteins, lipids, and DNA (mtDNA) and
  causes mitochondrial dysfunction. Right panel: Without fully functioning RPE mitochondria,
  RPE begin utilizing glucose to generate energy via glycolysis, thereby usurping
  this energy source away from the PR, which rely heavily on the glycolytic pathway.
  This alteration to retinal metabolism causes a bioenergetics crisis in the retina
  that ultimately leads to death of photoreceptors and RPE, a hallmark of advanced
  disease.'
