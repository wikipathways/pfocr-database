caption: Schema of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). The amino sugar UDP-GlcNAc
  is generated in the HBP by combining fructose-6-phosphate, glutamine, nucleotides,
  and acetyl-CoA. More detailed description of the sequential enzyme reactions in
  the pathway is provided in the text. O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) uses UDP-GlcNAc
  to transfer O-GlcNAc moieties onto target proteins that can be recognized by RL2
  antibodies and removed by O-GlcNAse (OGA). OGT and OGA inhibitors mentioned in the
  text are shown in the yellow boxes.
