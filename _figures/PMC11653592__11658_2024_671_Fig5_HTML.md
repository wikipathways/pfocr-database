caption: The influence factors of CYPs and HSD17B in PH. A The influence factors of
  CYPs in pulmonary hypertension. In patients with PH or animal models, the expression
  of HIF-2α is increased, and the upregulation of p53 may promote the expression of
  CYP1B1 and increase the level of 16-OHE. The increased levels of IL-1β and IL-6
  may inhibit the activity of CYP3A4 and decrease the level of 2-OHE. The activation
  of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may promote the expression of CYP1A and increase
  the level of 2-OHE. The expression of PDE4B is increased leads to decreased levels
  of cAMP and cGMP, but the content of CYP3A is not clear. The increased expression
  of CYP2C29 and EET increases the expression of COX-2 through a cAMP-dependent pathway,
  thereby promoting endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The increased
  expression of CYP1B1 may promote the proliferation of PASMCs by increasing the levels
  of 16α-OHE and cyclin D1, promoting the expression of Nox1, stimulating the irreversible
  oxidation of protein tyrosine phosphatase, and reducing the activity of nuclear
  factor Nrf2 and the expression of its antioxidant genes. B The influence factors
  of HSD17B in PH. Under PH, OSoxidative stress activates the NF-κB channel and promotes
  of TNF, IL-6, and IL-1 by helper T cell type 1 45, which will upregulate HSD17B1.
  In addition, in PH, the upregulation of HSD17B1 and the increase of HSD17B1 will
  increase the production of E2 and decrease the production of E1. Due to TNF, ATRA,
  and DHT, HSD17B2 increases, resulting in increased E1 production and decreased E2
  production. HIF-2α, hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha; CYP, cytochrome P450; 2-OHE,
