caption: Upon leptin (Ob) binding to the leptin receptor (ObR), JAK2 is phosphorylated.
  In turn, JAK2 phosphorylates two key tyrosine residues on the ObR that serve as
  docking sites for SHP2 (Tyr985) and STAT3 (Tyr1138), which leads to activation of
  the ERK and STAT3 pathways. Moreover, JAK2 also activates a parallel pathway involving
  IRS, PI3K, and AKT. When phosphorylated, STAT3 dimerizes and translocates to the
  nucleus, where it upregulates specific target genes, such as POMC and SOCS3. SOCS3
  exerts negative feedback on leptin signaling by binding to Tyr985 of the ObR. Also
  shown is PTP1B, another negative regulator of leptin signaling that dephosphorylates
  JAK2.
