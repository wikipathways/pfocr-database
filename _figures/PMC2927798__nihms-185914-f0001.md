caption: 'Synaptic location of elements of canonical glutamate signaling pathway.
  Model of glutamate synapse consisting of pre- and postsynaptic neuron and glial
  cell depicting the cellular location of key glutamate signaling and interacting
  proteins according the IPA knowledge base. Marked in green are gene products that
  are downregulated, whereas highlighted in red are upregulated gene products in the
  LC of MDD patients.Abbreviations: CALM – calmodulin; HOMER – homer homolog; Gβγ
  – beta/gamma subunit of G protein coupled receptor; GLNS – glutamine synthetase;
  GLS – glutaminase; GRIA – glutamate receptor, ionotropic AMPA; GRID – glutamate
  receptor, ionotropic, delta; GRIK – glutamate receptor, ionotropic, kainite; GRIN
  - glutamate receptor, ionotropic, NMDA; GRIP – glutamate receptor binding protein;
  GRM –glutamate receptor, metabotropic; PICK1 – protein interacting with C kinase
  1; PSD-95 – postsynaptic density protein 95; SLC – member of solute carrier family'
