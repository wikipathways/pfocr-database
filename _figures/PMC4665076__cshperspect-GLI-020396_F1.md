caption: 'Overview of astrocytic metabolism. (Inset) Astrocytes (green) reside between
  blood vessels (red) and neurons (yellow). Neurons and oligodendrocytes (blue) are
  not in direct contact with vessels. Astrocytes form metabolic domains and are coupled
  by gap junctions, through which they exchange metabolites and ions. Energy: The
  main energy substrate of the brain is glucose (glc), which crosses the endothelium
  and enters astrocytes via the glucose transporter GLUT1. Glucose is converted by
  glycolysis into pyruvate (pyr), which is oxidized to CO2 by the mitochondrial Krebs
  cycle, producing NADH and then ATP. Pyruvate also generates lactate (lac), which
  is shuttled via monocarboxylate transporters MCT4 and MCT2 to be used as an energy
  substrate by neurons. Astrocytes store energy in the form of glycogen. A fast mechanism
  of neuronal energization is redox cycling, whereby astrocytic lactate is exchanged
  for neuronal pyruvate, with the net transfer of one energy-rich NADH per cycle.
  Neurons capture glucose via the glucose transporter GLUT3 to be metabolized via
  glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to promote antioxidation. Neurotransmission:
  Glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are captured by astrocytic excitatory amino
  acid transporters (EAAT) and GAT, respectively, converted into glutamine and shuttled
  back to neurons for recycling via multiple astrocytic and neuronal transporters
  (SN1, SAT/ATA, and others). Biosynthesis: Glucose diverted through the astrocytic
  PPP generates NADPH and precursors for the synthesis of nucleotides and amino acids.
  Pyruvate is carboxylated into the Krebs cycle intermediate oxaloacetate (OAA), which
  is a precursor of multiple biosynthetic pathways in astrocytes and, through shuttling
  of glutamine, is also the main precursor for neuronal biosynthesis. Waste recycling:
  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neurons are scavenged by ascorbate (AA) with the
  production of dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), which diffuses through the glucose transporters
  toward astrocytes to be recycled into AA, and is returned to neurons via anion channels
  and the SVCT2. Glutathione (GSH) reacts with ROS to generate glutathione disulfide
  (GSSG), or with xenobiotics to generate conjugated glutathione (GS-X), both of which
  are discarded via multidrug resistance proteins (MDR). GSH synthesized and released
  by astrocytes is cleaved in the interstice to cysteine, which controls the neuronal
  synthesis of GSH. Ammonia (NH3) released by the deamidation of glutamine into glutamate
  leaves neurons by an unknown pathway and is captured as ammonium (NH4+) by K+ channels
  in astrocytes, where it is recycled by glutamine synthase. Some nitrogen is returned
  to astrocytes in the form of alanine and other amino acids (not shown). K+ released
  by neurons during synaptic activity enters astrocytes via K+ channels and the Na+/K+
  ATPase. Methylglyoxal is a side product of glycolysis, which is detoxified mostly
  in astrocytes by the glyoxalase system.'
