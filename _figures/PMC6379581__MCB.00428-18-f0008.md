caption: Proposed PHS metabolic pathway in yeast and reaction model of Mpo1-catalyzed
  FA α-oxidation. (A) The entire PHS metabolic pathway in yeast revealed by this study
  is illustrated. (B) Our proposed reaction model of Mpo1-catalyzed FA α-oxidation
  is illustrated. Step 1, formation of iron(IV) peroxide complex; step 2, attack of
  oxygen on the carbonyl carbon of the C-1 carboxylic acid of the substrate 2-OH C16:0-COOH;
  step 3, formation of H2O; step 4, formation of CO2; step 5, nucleophilic attack
  of the double bond between Fe(IV) and oxygen on the C-1 carbonyl carbon; step 6,
  formation of the reaction product C15:0-COOH. The chemical equation for the reaction
  is presented in the dashed box.
