caption: (a) Cellular networks involve many diverse information encoding currencies.
  This heterogeneity presents a challenge to the synthetic biologist who wants to
  add novel links to engineer the network. (b) Many of the reversible reactions that
  are used as signaling currencies in post-translational networks can be understood
  in terms of a reader/writer/eraser paradigm. Writers enzymatically catalyze the
  transfer of chemical marks onto target molecules; Erasers catalyze the removal of
  chemical mark. Inputs to the node is used to control the writers and erasers. The
  presence of a mark is then read out by a reader module, which can either come in
  the form an altered functionality, or some type of binding partner that recognizes
  and binds to the molecule that bears the chemical mark. Reader/writer/eraser triads
  can be used to generate reversible linkages in signaling a network, and are an attractive
  target for synthetic biology. Phosphorylation is the most familiar example of a
  chemical currency that conforms to the reader/writer/eraser paradigm. Kinases are
  responsible for transferring phosphates onto a variety of different types of cellular
  targets, while phosphatases act as erasers by dephosphorylating those targets. A
  diverse number of readers exist for phosphate marks. Phosphorylation of protein
  targets, for example, can result in allosteric alteration of binding surfaces such
  that they either bind to or disengaged from binding partners. Additionally, interaction
  domains that specifically recognize phosphorylated protein motifs (SH2's, WW's,
  FHA's) represent a common mechanisms for generating reversible interactions between
  nodes in a signaling pathway. GTPases follow the reader/writer/eraser paradigm as
  well, except that the reversible chemical mark (the structure of the guanine nucleotide)
  is translated into protein surface conformational changes which are read out by
  the interacting proteins that act as readers. The ubiquitination of protein targets
  and the reversible chemical modification of histones are two additional types of
  modular, reversible regulation currencies. In the case of ubiquitination, E3 complexes
  act as writers, transferring ubiquitin to protein targets. DUB's are responsible
  catalyzing de-ubiquitination reactions. Depending on the number of ubiquitin tags,
  and configuration of the tags, ubiquitination can lead to proteasome-mediated degradation,
  or recruitment via biding to non-proteasomal UBD's. Histone modifications constitute
  a diverse class of reversible chemical modifications which are used to modify the
  state of chromatin. Histone modifying enzymes, which acts as writers, use methylation
  and acetylation to write reversible marks onto resides found in histone proteins.
  Marks then recruit chromo domain and bromo domain-containing factors that alter
  chromatin state. (c) natural networks link nodes of different currencies by using
  modular connecter devices - devices that read in the output of the upstream currency
  and use it to control the input to a downstream currency. Making diverse modular
  connecter devices is a key goal in developing a synthetic biology toolkit. (d) Using
  phosphorylation as an example currency, we illustrate the range of downstream connections
  that could in principle be regulated by this currency. In principle, synthetic biologists
  should be able to construct new connections of all of these types.
