  a The synthesis route of MSN-GA-CUR and its therapeutic effect through the targeted
  delivery of GA receptor to the tumor site, among which CLSM image shows HepG2 cells
  incubated with 100 μg/mL C-6-MSN-GA (I), C-6- MSN (II) after 30 min [84]. Copyright

  passage through the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 5 (UBR5) targeted
  delivery to the tumor site to play a therapeutic role, and in vivo small animal
  imaging showed the survival of HepG2 cells after different drug interventions [86].
