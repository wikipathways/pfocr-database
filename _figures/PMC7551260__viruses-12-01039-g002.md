caption: Schematic diagram of the antiviral immune response and evasion mechanism
  of coronaviruses. Coronaviruses are internalized into susceptible target cells by
  the fusion of viral and cellular membranes with unique receptors, such as ACE2,
  DPP4, and APN, and the RNA of the viral genome is released into the cytosol. SARS-CoV
  and SARS-CoV-2 exploit the serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike protein priming. The
  virion and the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of coronavirus can
  be recognized by immune sensors called pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), such
  as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasm retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG) type
  I like receptors (RLRs) (RIG-I/MDA5). The extracellular membrane of TLRs (TLR2/4)
  and endosome TLRs (TLR3/7/8) are widely expressed in epithelial cells and dendritic
  cells. The PAMPs of coronaviruses induce the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway
  for antiviral innate immune responses. RIG-I/MDA5 conveys signals through mitochondrial
  antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), while TLRs signal through TIR-containing adapter
  protein inducing IFN-β/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (TRIF/MyD88). TNF receptor-associated
  factor 3 (TRAF3) activates tank-binding kinase 1/IκB kinase epsilon (TBK1/IKKε),
  while TRAF6 signal transduction requires activation of the IKK complex. Activated
  transcription factors are translocated into the nucleus to promote Type I and III
  IFN expression. IFNs are secreted into the extracellular space and bound to their
  cognate receptors IFNAR and IFNLR (IFNLR1 and IL10Rβ) to activate downstream the
  Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling,
  followed by nuclear localization of the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3)
  complex and expression of numerous interferon stimulating genes (ISGs), leading
  to the establishment of an antiviral state. Suppression of IFN signal pathways by
  coronaviruses and their antagonists is shown in red boxes. S, severe acute respiratory
  symptom coronavirus (SARS-CoV); M, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
  (MERS-CoV); P, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV); PD, porcine Deltacoronavirus
  (PDCoV); ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; DPP4, dipeptidyl peptidase-4; APN,
  aminopeptidase N; TMPRSS2, transmembrane serine protease 2.
