caption: Overview of BMP signalling pathway and modulators during development of pre-placodal
  ectoderm. BMPs such as BMP4 bind to their receptors BMPR1A, BMPR1B, and BMPR2 on
  the cell surface, resulting in activation of SMADs which translocate to the nucleus
  to influence transcription of genes directing cell fate towards non-neural ectoderm/pre-placodal
  and subsequent placodal fates, and inhibiting differentiation towards neural fate.
  The presence of antagonists and modulators such as Noggin, Follistatin, Chordin,
  Gremlin, and TWSG1 alter the level of BMP activity on the cell and hence can also
  influence cell fate. (Generated using Biorender.com, accessed 6 September 2024)
