caption: In the latent state, the 5′LTR NF-κB and NFAT binding sites are occupied
  by inactive p50 homodimers, while the active p50/p65 NF-κB isoform is bound to IκB
  and sequestered in the cytoplasm. NFAT is phosphorylated and also remains in the
  cytoplasm. Histone deacetylases are recruited to the 5′LTR and repress transcriptional
  activity. Additional mechanisms of latency that are not pharmacologic targets in
  pilot clinical trials have been omitted for clarity. Disulfiram (green arrows) blocks
  the activity of the Akt-inhibitory protein PTEN. Akt signaling pathway activation
  results in release of the active positive transcription elongation factor b (p-TEFb,
  not shown) as well as phosphorylation of IKK and subsequent degradation of IκB,
  which allows the p50/p65 NF-κB isoform to enter the nucleus, bind to the 5′LTR and
  induce transcription. Cytoplasmic PKC isoforms are activated by PKC agonists and
  also target IκB for degradation (blue arrows), which leads to active NF-κB entry
  into the nucleus. Stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) leads to cellular activation
  (orange arrows), which results in translocation of both transcription factors NF-κB
  and NFAT into the nucleus. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi, brown arrows)
  block the activity of histone deacetylases and lead to acetylation of Nuc-0 and
  Nuc-1. Active NF-κB bound to the 5′LTR leads to the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases
  (HATs).Figure adapted from Xing S. et al Drug Discov. Today 2013 [ref ] and Van
