caption: 'Interplay of signaling pathways: cellular dynamics within the pancreatic
  ductal adenocarcinoma microenvironment. The activation of SCs from a quiescent to
  an active state is induced by IL6 release from cancer cells. The hypoxic tumor state
  upregulates GM-CSF, promoting the migration and proliferation of SCs. Reciprocal
  paracrine signaling is established between cancer cells and SCs, with cancer cells
  releasing TIMP1 and NGF to influence SCs. Conversely, SCs release TGF-b and L1CAM,
  impacting cancer cells and contributing to NI. SCs play a multifaceted role by recruiting
  macrophages through the release of IL33 and CCL2. The CCL2-CCR2 pathway prompts
  TAMs to emit cathepsin B, thereby promoting nerve injury. TAMs, activated by IL33,
  release bFGF, establishing a positive feedback loop within the microenvironment.
  This intricate interplay highlights the dynamic and interconnected nature of cellular
  communication in the context of PDAC. Abbreviations: SCs, Schwann cells; GM-CSF,
  granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor; TIMP1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases
  1; NGF, nerve growth factor; TGF-b, transforming growth factor-beta; L1CAM, L1 cell
  adhesion molecule; NI, neural invasion; CCL2, chemokine ligand 2; TAMs, tumor-associated
  macrophages; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; and PDAC, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma'
