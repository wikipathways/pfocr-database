caption: Insulin signalling pathway. Upon binding with insulin, the insulin receptor
  (INSR) autophosphorylates and recruits various substrates. The two major arms of
  insulin signalling are mitogenic (initiated by Growth factor receptor-bound protein
  2 (GRB2) and Src homology and collagen (SHC)) and metabolic (initiated by insulin
  receptor substrate (IRS) proteins). In the metabolic pathway, phosphorylated IRS
  activates phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) with subsequent phosphorylation of protein
  kinase B (AKT). The glucose transporters (GLUTs) are the main insulin-responsive
  glucose carriers that transport glucose between the cell membrane and intracellular
  organelles. The mitogenic pathway regulates cell growth, proliferation and gene
  expression, while the metabolic pathway regulates cell survival, proliferation,
  lipid, glycogen and protein synthesis (figure adapted from Peterson et al. [] and
  modified by the authors).
