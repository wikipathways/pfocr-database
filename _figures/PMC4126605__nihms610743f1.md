caption: Schematic representation of interlocking roles for heat shock factors and
  FOXO3 in Aβ metabolism. Healthy cell. HSF, HSP, and FOXO3 are all at normal expression
  and activity. A minority of AβPP is processed via the β-secretase pathway, producing
  Aβ, at least some of which is directed intracellularly for functions such as transcription
  factor activity. HSF binds to HSP and is activated. Active HSF (*) is directed to
  the nucleus where it upregulates (among others) HSP expression. HSP activation (HSP90)
  directs excess intracellular Aβ toward proteasomes, where it is degraded to amino
  acids (AA). FOXO3, among its multiple functions, catalyzes formation of amyloid
  plaque from Aβ. In addition, extracellular non-plaque Aβ is cleared by enzymes such
  as insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE).
