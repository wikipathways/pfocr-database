caption: Schematic presentation of regulatory mechanisms of GFL-GFRA1 signaling. (A)
  RET is recruited to the lipid microdomain (or lipid rafts) by GPI-anchored GFRA1
  (left side, cis-signaling) and by soluble GFRA1 (right side, sGFRA1, trans-signaling)
  released from plasma membrane. During cis-signaling, GFRA1 is anchored to lipid
  rafts by GPI, allowing GFLs to bind to GFRA1 to transduce their signals to co-receptor
  RET which can then activate downstream targets like Src kinase, PLCγ, or PI3K/AKT.
  Trans-signaling occurs when the GDNF/sGFRA1 complex binds to RET on another peripheral
  neuron which does not express GFRA1. GDNF/sGFRA1/RET can then transduce their signal
  to downstream targets such as PI3K/AKT and PLCγ/Cdk5, resulting in neuronal survival
  and neurite outgrowth; (B) In the absence of GFLs, short-range signaling by homophilic
  interactions between p140NCAM can be disrupted by the presence of GFRA, resulting
  in the inhibition of cell adhesion, or extracellular signaling crosstalk (left side).
  In the presence GFLs, the association of membrane-bound GFRA with p140NCAM results
  in the activation of the Fyn-FAK-MAPK signaling pathway (right side); (C) Ligand-induced
  cell adhesion; (D) Recycling of GDNF/GFRA1/RET complex by SorLA. SorLA/GFRA1-mediated
  GDNF uptake occurs by RET-independent endocytosis. SorLA/GFRA1 complex directs GDNF
  to lysosome. SorLA/GFRA1-mediated RET endocytosis is independent of GDNF.
