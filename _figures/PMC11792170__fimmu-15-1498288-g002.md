caption: Part of IL-27 signaling pathways in obesity and other related metabolic diseases.
  IL-27 can promote the expression of thermogenic factor UCP1 by activating the p38MAPK-PGC-1α
  signaling pathway, depleting energy, reducing lipid accumulation, and inhibiting
  the occurrence of obesity. IL-27 can inhibit the activation of APC and T lymphocytes,
  reduce inflammatory factors, and inhibit the occurrence of diabetes. However, IL-27
  can also affect the differentiation balance of CD4+ T lymphocytes, increase the
  maturation of Th1 pro-inflammatory cells, and promote the accumulation of CD8+ T
  lymphocytes, which can destroy islet β cells and promote the occurrence of diabetes.
  IL-27 can activate the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in monocyte-macrophages, up-regulate
  the expression of ABCA1 protein, reduce the number of foam cells, and inhibit atherosclerosis.
  IL-27 can also activate STAT3 signaling pathway, reduce cellular reactive oxygen
  species level, reduce myocardial cell damage, and inhibit atherosclerosis. IL-27
  can inhibit the excessive activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes, Th17 cells and chemokines,
  thereby inhibiting renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and preventing the occurrence
  of secondary hypertension. IL-27 can activate STAT3 signaling pathway, reduce the
  levels of inflammatory molecules TNF-α and IL-1β, and increase the secretion of
  anti-inflammatory factor IL-10, thereby reducing the degree of nerve cell damage
  and the volume of cerebral infarction. IL-27 can activate STAT3-mTOR signaling,
  promote the synthesis and secretion of intestinal GLP-1, and alleviate IR. IL-27
  can activate CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte population
  to provide an immune barrier to the intestine, and inhibit the differentiation of
  Th17 cells to reduce intestinal inflammation
