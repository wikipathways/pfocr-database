caption: The caspase-3/8/9- and granzyme-mediated pathways. Activation of TNF receptors
  is able to counteract the IAP proteins cIAP1, cIAP2 and XIAP, resulting in the formation
  of compounds containing procaspase-8, FADD, and RIPK1, leading to the activation
  of caspase-3 and GSDME. During Yersinia infection, the effector protein YopJ inhibits
  TAK1 and promotes caspase-8 assembly and GSDMD cleavage. The metabolite α-KG is
  able to cause oxidation of the death receptor DR6 located at the plasma membrane,
  triggering its endocytosis, activation of caspase-8 and activation of GSDMC. In
  addition, caspase-8 has been reported to cleave Bid into tBid and translocate it
  to the mitochondria, activating the Bax/Bak pore to release cytochrome c. Cisplatin,
  through the activation of CAPN1 and CAPN2, also triggers the release of Bax/Bak
  release of cytochrome c, which in turn activates caspase-9 and caspase-3. GzmA and
  GzmB are secreted by killer cells and directly cleave and activate GSDMB and GSDME,
  respectively. CAR-T cells initiate pyroptosis by activating caspase-3 through the
  release of GzmB and the cleavage of GSDME
