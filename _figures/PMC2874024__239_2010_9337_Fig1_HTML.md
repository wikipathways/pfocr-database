caption: 'The canonical Wnt and TGFβ pathways in D. melanogaster. a Wnt pathway. In
  the absence of a Wnt signal, the destruction complex composed of Axin, APC, and
  Zw3 phosphorylates Arm (pArm) to tag it for degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome
  pathway. In order to activate the pathway, a secreted Wnt ligand binds to unrelated
  Fz and Arr receptors. Wnt binding leads to the phosphorylation of the Dsh signal
  transducer. Dsh then inhibits the antagonistic activity of the destruction complex
  (a double negative mechanism of action), and Arm accumulates in the nucleus. There
  Arm joins transcription–activation complexes composed of one or more of the transcription
  factors Pygo, Lgs, and TCF. Arrows indicate positive, and T-bars negative effects
  on information transfer. b TGFβ pathway: The Dpp ligand binds to Punt a Type II
  transmembrane receptor serine–threonine kinase, which then recruits the related
  Tkv Type I receptor and phosphorylates it. Tkv then phosphorylates the R-Smad Mad
  (pMad). pMad then translocates to the nucleus as a heteromeric complex with the
  Co-Smad Medea. This multi-Smad complex then regulates the expression of target genes
  in cooperation with tissue-specific activators and repressors (a linear positive
  mechanism of action)'
