caption: 'Mechanism of TREM2/TREM2+macrophages in MASH. The mechanism of TREM2/TREM2+
  macrophages in MASH is reflected in three main aspects: regulation of lipid metabolism,
  inflammatory signaling pathways, and macrophage phagocytosis. TREM2/TREM2+ macrophages
  reduce lipid accumulation and toxic lipid-induced damage by enhancing lipid uptake,
  upregulating lipid metabolism-related genes, and modulating lipid peroxidation,
  thereby alleviating oxidative stress, ER stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction,
  ultimately reducing cell death. TREM2 can inhibit the inflammatory signaling pathway
  activated by the TLR4 (Upon ligand binding, TLR4 recruits MyD88 to its intracellular
  domain. MyD88 then recruits and phosphorylates members of the IRAK family, such
  as IRAK4 and IRAK1. Once IRAK1 is activated, it associates with TRAF6, a ubiquitin
  ligase that plays a central role in propagating the signal. TRAF6 subsequently triggers
  the activation of three major MAPK and NF-κB pathways). By inhibiting the MAPK and
  NF-κB pathways, TREM2/TREM2+macrophages can mitigate inflammatory responses. Additionally,
  TREM2+macrophages can phagocytose lipids and dead hepatocytes caused by oxidative
  stress, which is also a crucial step in regulating lipid metabolism disorders and
  immune responses. TREM2, Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2; ER stress,
