caption: 'Hit reads of genes involved in the hydrogenotrophic (red line), acetoclastic
  (blue line), and methylotrophic (green line) methanogenesis pathways during solid
  waste decomposition (A). (B) The hit reads of relevant genes. (C) The relative abundance
  of the core mcrG gene. The methanogenesis pathway figure () was modified based on
  . FdhA, glutathione-independent formaldehyde dehydrogenase; EchA, hydrogenase subunit
  A; FmdE, formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase subunit E; FTR, formylmethanofuran-tetrahydromethanopterin
  N-formyltransferase; MCH, methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase; MTD, methylenetetrahydromethanopterin
  dehydrogenase; MER, coenzyme F420-dependent N5, N10-methenyltetrahydroethanopterin
  reductase; MtrA, tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase; MtaA, [methyl-Co(III)
  methanol-specific corrinoid protein]: coenzyme M methyltransferase; McrG, methyl-coenzyme
  M reductase gamma subunit; AckA, acetate kinase; ACSS, acetyl-CoA synthetase; PTA,
  phosphate acetyltransferase; HdrA, heterodisulfide reductase subunit; CdhC, acetyl-CoA
  decarbonylase/synthase complex subunit beta.'
