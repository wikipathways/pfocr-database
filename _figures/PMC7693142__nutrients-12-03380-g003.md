caption: The methionine and folate cycle pathways involving PLP-, FAD- and B12-dependent
  enzymes. The folate cycle begins with the conversion of dietary folate (B9) into
  dihydrofolate (DHF), which is then reduced to tetrahydrofolate (THF) by the enzyme
  dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). THF is next converted to 5,10-methyleneTHF by serine
  hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), a reaction that is coupled with the hydroxylation
  of serine (Ser) to glycine (Gly) and requires PLP as a cofactor. Thymidylate synthase
  (TS) uses 5,10-methyleneTHF as a methyl donor to methylate deoxyuridine monophosphate
  (dUMP), creating deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). This step regenerates DHF
  for continued cycling. Alternatively, 5,10-methyleneTHF can be reduced by methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR) to 5-methytetrahydrofolate (5-mTHF) using FAD as a cofactor. As
  part of the methionine cycle, 5-mTHF donates a methyl group to regenerate methionine
  from homocysteine (Hcy), which is catalyzed by methionine synthase (MS) that requires
  B12, in the form of methylcobalamin, as a cofactor. To generate the methyl donor
  S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) for use by multiple methyltransferases. SAM is demethylated
  during the methyltransferase reactions to form S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) which
  is then hydrolysed by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) to form Hcy. Hcy can
  also enter the trans-sulfuration pathway catalyzed by cystathionine beta synthase
  (CBS) and cystathionine gamma lyase (CTH), both requiring PLP as a cofactor, to
  create cysteine.
