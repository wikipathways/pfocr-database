caption: Summary of potential mechanisms of naringenin in the treatment of COPD. Naringenin
  has been shown to act on various signaling pathways such as phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT), STAT3, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways probably through
  specific miRNAs. The PI3K/AKT pathway, a bridge in the regulatory network, can activate
  downstream effectors including caspase-3, Bcl-2, VEGF, eNOS, NF-κB, and Nrf2 thereby
  participating in the processes of apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation, and oxidative
  stress in COPD pathogenesis.
