caption: 'The Golgi contains proton channels and inherent properties that may convert
  the organelle into a proton sink in cancer. (A) The Golgi is an acidic organelle
  that shows a decreasing pH gradient along the sub-compartments, eventually leading
  to the formation of acidic secretory vesicles and granules. The luminal proton concentration
  is 10–100 times higher as the cytosol and thus the organelle may function as a proton
  repository that contributes to the upkeep of an alkaline intracellular pH (pHi)
  in cancer cells. The resting pH of the Golgi and vesicles is thought to be mediated
  by proton loading and counter ion conductance. Additionally, a proton leak pathway
  allows for reducing luminal proton content, but the pathway is suggested to be absent
  in secretory vesicles. (B) Ion channels at the Golgi regulate the luminal H+ content.
  V-ATPase: Vacuolar H+-ATPases load the lumen constitutively with protons in an ATP-dependent
  manner. NHE7/8: Sodium-hydrogen exchanger 7 (NHE7) has been implicated in proton
  loading by exchanging protons for luminal Na+. However, the directionality of NHEs
  at the Golgi is debated since other studies propose that NHE7 and NHE8 function
  as a proton leak pathway. AE2a: Anion exchanger 2a is a Golgi-residing AE2 isoform
  that buffers the Golgi through HCO3– loading in exchange for Cl–. The buffering
  presents a sought-after proton leak pathway by providing means to neutralize luminal
  protons through the production of water and carbon dioxide, which can exit the lumen
  through diffusion. The directionality of AE2 is reversible and therefore bicarbonate
  influx is gradient-dependent. GPHR: Golgi pH regulator loads the lumen with Cl–
  in a voltage-gated manner. Hence, it provides the chloride ions required for counterion
  conductance to sustain the constitutive activity of V-ATPases. In addition, GHPR
  is thought to provide the chloride ions to allow for AE2a-mediated HCO3– buffering.
  TMEM165: Transmembrane protein 165 ion selectivity and directionality is still under
  investigation but data points toward Ca2+/Mn2+ transport in exchange for H+. (C)
  Secretory vesicles are targeted for exocytosis and thus present a pathway by which
  the Golgi may target protons to the extracellular space and convert the Golgi into
  a proton sink by siphoning off cytosolic H+. Secretion is upregulated in cancer,
  but the role in regulating pHi homeostasis remains to be determined. (D) In response
  to an acidic extracellular environment, lysosomes have been shown to be targeted
  for exocytosis, thereby maintaining an alkaline pHi and protecting the cells from
  extracellular acid.'
