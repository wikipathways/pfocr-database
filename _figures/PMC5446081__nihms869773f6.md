caption: The accumulation of EtOH-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevates IFN-γ
  expression which drives the transcription of PKR at IFN-γ Activating Sequence (GAS)
  elements. IFN-γ also phosphorylates PKR through direct mRNA binding to the regulatory
  subunit. PKR transcription can also be controlled by Sp1-like transcription factors
  through Sp1 binding sites. Activated p-PKR can translocate to the nucleus and also
  induces phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, which inhibits
  protein translation, leading to cell death. pPKR also increases p53 which causes
  increased oxidative stress and cell death.
