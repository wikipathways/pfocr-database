caption: Cancer cells with high expression of CTSE upregulate the ubiquinone signaling
  pathway, promoting the synthesis and release of Des-γ-carboxyprothrombin (DCP).
  DCP can not only inhibit CD45+ and CD3+ immune infiltration, but also promote T
  cells to increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to
  the increase of T cell apoptosis. CTSE knockdown can inhibit DCP levels and tumor
  growth, while significantly enhancing the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy
