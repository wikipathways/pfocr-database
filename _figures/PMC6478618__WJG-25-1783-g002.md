  figure was modified to highlight key molecular processes. This map shows a stage-dependent
  progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In the first stage of NAFLD,
  pathway highlights excess lipid accumulation associated with the induction of insulin
  resistance, which leads to a defect in insulin suppression of free fatty acids (FAAs)
  disposal. In addition, two transcription factors, SREBP-1c and PPARα, activate key
  enzymes of lipogenesis and increase the synthesis of FAAs in liver. In the second
  stage, pathway is presented as a consequence of the progression to nonalcoholic
  steatohepatitis (NASH); the production of reactive oxygen species is enhanced due
  to oxidation stress through mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids and endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress, leading to lipid peroxidation. The lipid peroxidation can
  further cause the production of cytokines [Fas ligand, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α),
  IL-8 and transforming growth factor], promoting cell death, inflammation and fibrosis.
  The activation of JNK, which is induced by ER stress, TNF-α and FAAs, is also associated
  with NAFLD progression. Increased JNK promotes cytokine production and initiation
  of hepatocellular carcinoma. Major organelles involved in the pathogenesis of NASH
  are also highlighted in the NAFLD-pathway, including mitochondria and mitochondrial
  dysfunction. In the figure, molecular targets that were further selected to explore
  protein-chemical interactions are highlighted by red squares. NAFLD: Nonalcoholic
  fatty liver disease; NASH: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; ER: Endoplasmic reticulum;
  HCC: Hepatocellular carcinoma; NAFL: Nonalcoholic fatty liver; FAAs: Free fatty
  acids; TNFα: tumor necrosis factor α.'
