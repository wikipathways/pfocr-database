caption: It is believed that hydropic drugs might inactivate the Na+/K+ antiporter
  pump or alternatively lead to decreased ATP production, ultimately leading to accumulation
  of Na+, Ca2+, and water and effluxes of K+ and Mg2+. A decreased Mg2+ level also
  suggests impaired functioning of the Na+/K+ pump. The drug might cause a rapid influx
  of water by an as of yet unknown mechanism, causing organelles (vacuoles, Golgi
  bodies, mitochondria, and rough endoplasmic reticulum) to dilate extensively and
  disrupting normal biological functioning. Water-filled vacuoles tend to fuse to
  form giant vacuoles that subsequently rupture and kill cells. Contrariwise, mitochondrial
  damage might also be a factor for decreased ATP production in the cell. The dashed
  lines (red or black) indicate uncharacterized sections of the pathway, while solid
  lines (black) represent regular biological attributes. ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
