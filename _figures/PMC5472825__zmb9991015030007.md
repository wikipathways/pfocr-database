caption: Model for CR-induced optimization of acetyl-CoA production during the diauxic
  shift to extend yeast CLS. CR maximizes Snf1 T210 phosphorylation in part by maintaining
  elevated ADP levels. Snf1 activates Cat8 and Adr1 transcription factors, which turn
  on multiple genes, including the acetyl-CoA synthetase gene ACS1. CR also maintains
  high ACS2 expression during the diauxic shift but independently of Cat8/Adr1. Elevated
  nucleocytoplasmic acetyl-CoA promotes histone acetyltransferase activity of the
  SAGA transcriptional coactivator complex, which amplifies expression of ACS1 and
  a subset of other Cat8/Adr1 target genes, resulting in a positive-feedback loop
  that drives sufficient acetyl-CoA production. Carbon skeletons are shunted through
  the glyoxylate cycle and gluconeogenesis pathway, supporting biomass formation during
  the early stages of the diauxic shift and storage of carbohydrates for extended
  cell survival. The full TCA cycle and respiration become more important later. Circles
  indicate proteins, and italics indicate genes. Red indicates components upregulated
  or enriched by CR (compared to NR) during or after the diauxic shift.
