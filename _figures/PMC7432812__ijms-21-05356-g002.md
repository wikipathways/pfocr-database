caption: Schema for the mechanisms for different types of cell deaths. Part (a) displays
  two important pathways for apoptosis, namely intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, both
  converging at caspase-3 as the executioner pathway. Part (b) shows the three underlying
  pathways for pyroptosis involving caspases 1,3,4,5, and 11. Part (c) is the schematic
  representation for NETosis. Part (d) exhibits the two pathways for anoikis, intrinsic
  and extrinsic, respectively. Part (e) outlines the mechanistic pathways associated
  with ferroptosis, promotion of lipid peroxide formation being one path and inhibition
  of reduction of lipid peroxide being the other. TNF/TNFR signaling pathway for necroptosis
  via MLKL phosphorylation is displayed in part (f). Finally, part (g) represents
  the different stages in a general necrosis mechanism.
