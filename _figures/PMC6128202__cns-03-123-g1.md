caption: 'Receptor tyrosine kinases (i.e., EGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR) signal through a MAPK
  cascade to promote cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and differentiation.
  In gliomas, this pathway is mutated such that it is deregulated and overactivated,
  leaving DNA transcription unchecked. NF-1 is normally a brake that inhibits Ras,
  but is often mutated in gliomas and thus is nonfunctional. The tyrosine kinases
  also signal through PI3K, which phosphorylates PIP2 to the active PIP3, which goes
  on to activate nuclear transcription through mTOR. This pathway is kept in check
  by PTEN, but mutations in gliomas result in constitutively active PI3K or an inactive
  PTEN. NF-κB is normally found in the cytoplasm bound with an inhibitor-α, but when
  activated the inhibitor-α and the free NF-kB can then translocate to the nucleus
  to regulate transcription. Notch pathway activation results in the cleavage of the
  cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane receptor by γ-secretase, which then translocates
  to the nucleus to affect transcription. In terms of direct nuclear regulation, p53
  is mutated in a majority of gliomas and DNA damage goes unregulated allowing continuously
  new mutations to occur. Lastly, Rb is a brake that keeps transcription off and is
  normally inhibited by cyclins that promote transcription. p16 normally inhibits
  the cyclin proteins to keep the cycle in check, but p16 is often mutated in gliomas,
  thereby leading to deregulated proliferation. In the end, all the various treatment
  strategies discussed go after one of these cascades either directly or indirectly.EGFR:
  EGF receptor; PDGFR: PDGF receptor; PIP2: Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate;
  PIP3: Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate; PTEN: Phosphate and tensin homolog;
  VEGFR: VEGF receptor.'
