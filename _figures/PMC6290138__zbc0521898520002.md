caption: 'Hypusine–polyamine pathway in human neuroblastoma. Shown is a graphical
  overview of the genes involved in eIF5A hypusination and polyamine metabolism with
  their protein activities and metabolites. Spermidine is the sole substrate and is
  mandatory for the synthesis of hypusine in eIF5A. Also shown are the action sites
  of the inhibitors used in neuroblastoma (NB) studies. References for additional
  inhibitor studies in neuroblastoma not named in the main text are as follows: DENSPM
  () and PG11047 (). Genes are highlighted in green or red according to their prognostic
  value in Zhang-498, the largest publicly available RNA-Seq dataset for human neuroblastoma
  (). Green or red indicates that high mRNA expression is significantly prognostic
  for poor or good patient survival in Kaplan-Meier analysis, respectively. In addition,
  gene mRNA expression was analyzed for correlation with MYCN gene amplification and
  MYCN mRNA expression using the R2 website (http://r2.amc.nl). (Please note that
  the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site
  or any other third party hosted site.) With the exception of DOHH and MAT1B, all
  other pathway genes that are prognostic for neuroblastoma also appear to be regulated
  by MYCN in this tumor. For more details on the analysis see Refs. , , . Data from
  Zhang-498 are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus database under accession
  number GSE62564. Reproduced with permission from Ref. . This research was originally
