caption: Validation and pathway analysis of elevated S100A8 protein in FSHD. (a) ELISA
  of S100A8 protein in plasma from a separate validation set of FSHD1 patients. (b)
  Bioinformatic pathway analysis was used to identify known connections between candidate

  analysis of ChIP-seq defined binding sites for the key S100A8 pathway transcription
  factors AP-1 (FOS and JUN) and NF-κB (RELA), at potential regulatory regions of
  the candidate miRNAs that were found to increase in FSHD plasma. Binding sites represent
  the combined number of potential promoter (within 2 kb of promoter) and enhancer
  (within 10 kb) regulatory regions with ChIP-seq-confirmed transcription factor binding
  for each miRNA home gene. (** p ≤ 0.01; n = 13 healthy control volunteers, 19 FSHD1;
