caption: The release of growth hormone (GH), Wnt, or RANKL, as stimulated by progesterone
  (P4), promotes interaction with various signal transduction pathways. RANKL stimulates
  the NFκB pathway, and Wnt proteins stabilize cytoplasmic β-catenin, which under
  basal conditions is bound to E-Cadherin, and both activate Wnt target genes by forming
  a complex with T-cell transcription factors such as LEF-1. GH signals through the
  Janus kinase 2/Stat5a pathway but also by activation of cSrc. Inhibition of cSrc
  with the inhibitor Dasatinib results in inhibition of Wnt reporter activity in our
  canine cell lines by a yet unknown mechanism. As well as GH, integrins, type-1 IGF
  receptors (IGFR1), and the HER-family of tyrosine kinase receptors may also be involved
  in cSrc activation or stimulation of phosphatidyl-3-kinase or mitogen-activated
  protein kinase pathways. The high Wnt activity in our cell lines is associated with
  elevated expression of the HER receptors. Finally cSrc may also form a ternary complex
  with P4 receptor-A (PRA) and E2 receptor-α (ERα) resulting in activation/phosphorylation
  of nuclear transcription factors.
