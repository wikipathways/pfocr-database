caption: At the transcriptional level, a TE (shown in brown) inserted upstream of
  a gene may (i) insert promoter sequences and introduce an alternative transcription
  start site, (ii) disrupt existing cis-regulatory element(s), or (iii) introduce
  a new cis element such as a transcription factor binding site. In addition, a TE
  inserted within an intron may drive antisense transcription and potentially interfere
  with sense transcription. Finally, a TE may serve as a nucleation center for the
  formation of heterochromatin potentially silencing the transcription of adjacent
  gene(s). At the posttranscriptional level, a TE inserted in the 3′ UTR of a gene
  may introduce an alternative polyadenylation site, a binding site for a microRNA
  or for RNA-binding protein (not shown). A TE inserted within an intron can interfere
  with the normal splicing pattern of a pre-mRNA, provoking various forms of alternative
  splicing (intron retention, exon skipping…etc). A TE inserted within an intron containing
  cryptic splice sites may be incorporated (‘exonized’) as an alternative exon. This
  may result in the translation of a new protein isoform, or in the destabilization
  or degradation of the mRNA via the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway, especially
  if the exonized TE introduces a premature stop codon (asterisk).
