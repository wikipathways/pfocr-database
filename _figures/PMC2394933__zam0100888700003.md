caption: Transcript profiles of the initial steps of type II FAB in Escherichia coli.
  Malonyl-CoA is synthesized from acetyl-CoA by the action of acetyl-CoA carboxylase,
  a heterotetramer composed of subunits encoded by accABCD. The malonate moiety is
  transferred from CoA to ACP by the action of malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (FabD).
  See the work of Magnuson et al. for a full review of the E. coli FAB pathway ().
  Also shown (inset) are the expression values and Z scores (in parentheses) for FAB
  genes that exhibited a biologically significant up-regulation in the mevalonate-producing
  strain (E. coli DP10 containing pBAD33MevT and pBAD18) relative to the inactive-pathway
  control strain [E. coli DP10 containing pMevT(C159A) and pBAD18] in the microarray
  analysis. Also shown are the expression profiles for the CFA synthase gene (cfa)
  as well as two genes in the biotin synthesis pathway, the gene encoding 7,8-diaminopelargonic
  acid synthase (bioA) and one encoding biotin synthase (bioB).
