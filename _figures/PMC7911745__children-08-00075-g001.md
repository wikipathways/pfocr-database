caption: NF-κB signaling pathway and the genes associated with BD-like phenotypes.
  In the canonical pathway, when signals such as TNF-α and IL-1β are recognized by
  cytokine receptors, RIPK1 (Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase
  1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) are ubiquitinated
  and the IκB kinase (IKK) complex is activated. Activation of the IKK complex leads
  to IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB (p50/p65) activation. Activated NF-κB is translocated
  into the nucleus where it activates targeted gene expression. P50 homodimers curb
  inflammatory reactions. A20 acts on ubiquitination and suppressively regulates this
  pathway. In particular, upon TNF receptor stimulation, A20 removes K63-linked polyubiquitin
  chains, thereby preventing the interaction of RIPK1 with NEMO, and subsequently
  adds K48-linked polyubiquitin chains to RIPK1, targeting it for proteasomal degradation.
  Furthermore, upon IL-1 receptor binding, A20 removes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains
  from TRAF6. In the non-canonical pathway, when ligands such as lymphotoxin-β and
  BAFF (B cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family) bind to the receptor,
  NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) is activated. Phosphorylation of IKK complex by activated
  NIK leads to p100 (IκB domain) phosphorylation and NF-κB (p52/RelB) activation.
