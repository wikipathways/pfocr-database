caption: Catabolism of lysine to succinate in Escherichia coli K-12. Summary of the
  central metabolic pathway discovered in this study and of the corresponding gene
  cluster with its regulation (grey inset) in E. coli. We show that E. coli CsiD (carbon
  starvation induced protein D) functions as a α-ketoglutarate-dependent, CO2- and
  succinate-forming glutarate hydroxylase, which produces L-2-hydroxyglutarate, and
  that E. coli LhgO (L-2-hydroxyglutarate oxidase) acts as a membrane-bound, ubiquinone-linked,
  α-ketoglutarate-producing L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. Effectively, glutarate
  is converted to succinate by these two reactions. We also show that E. coli feeds
  glutarate into these reactions from 5-aminovalerate by promiscuous GabT, when acting
  as 5-aminovalerate transaminase, and by promiscuous GabD, when acting as glutarate
  seminaldehyde dehydrogenase. Thus, these GabT-GabD-CsiD-LhgO reactions link the
  central metabolism (TCA cycle) with the yet incompletely known lysine catabolism
  in E. coli, that is, with LdcC and CadA as lysine decarboxylases, PatA (putrescine
  transaminase) acting as cadaverine transaminase and PatD as 5-aminopentanal dehydrogenase,
  , , . The catabolism of lysine by this pathway is specifically induced in the stationary
  phase of E. coli (see text). The inbox shows the structure and regulation of the
  csiD-lhgO-gabD-gabT operon, which include also genes gabP encoding for a gamma-aminobutyrate
  (GABA) transporter that also imports the C5-homologue 5-aminovalerate and csiR encoding
  for a ligand-dependent transcription factor. Arrows represent transcription start
  sites (TSS) of different transcripts. Transcription of the operon is known to be
  enhanced by regulators cAMP-CRP, leu-LRP and H-NS, , and repressed by CsiR. We demonstrated
  that this repression is relieved specifically upon binding of glutarate to CsiR
