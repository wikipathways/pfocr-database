caption: Differentiation of Th17 cells and inducible TREG cells. Naive T cells express
  low levels of FOXP3 and ROR-γt on stimulation in the presence of TGF-β, presumably
  maintaining the potential to develop into either Th17 or TREG cells. Microenvironments
  with high levels of TGF-β, IL-2 and retinoic acid favour FOXP3-expressing TREG cells,
  whereas a low concentration of TGF-β with high levels of IL-6, IL-21 and IL-23 promotes
  Th17 cells. IL-2, IL-6, retinoic acid and IL-23 have opposing effects on Th17 compared
  with TREG cells. STAT3 has crucial roles at the initial programming (by IL-6), as
  well as at the autocrine positive-feedback stage (by IL-21) of the Th17 pathway.
