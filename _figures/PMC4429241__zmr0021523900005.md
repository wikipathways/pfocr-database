caption: Endogenous and microbial mechanisms to downmodulate and evade DNA-driven
  innate immune responses. (A) DNA is degraded by DNase II in lysosomal compartments
  and by Trex1 in the cytoplasm. DNA is also targeted for degradation by an autophagy
  pathway stimulated upon DNA binding by cGAS, leading to the release of Rubicon from
  Beclin-1. In addition to DNA turnover, the pathway is also regulated at the level
  of STING. After activation, this protein can be degraded through either proteasomal
  or autophagocytic pathways. Moreover, caspases 3, 7, and 9, activated during mitochondrial
  apoptosis, suppress DNA-stimulated IFN production by targeting a step upstream of
  TBK1 phosphorylation. Finally, the ULK1 kinase is activated by DNA and cGAMP to
  catalyze specific serine phosphorylation of STING in the C-terminal domain, leading
  to the downmodulation of the IRF3 pathway. (B) The SKIV2L exosome pathway degrades
  RNA that stimulates the RIG-I pathway and is thus likely to also be involved in
  the control of the Pol III–RIG-I pathway. (C) Viruses evade and counteract DNA-driven
  immune responses at several levels, including prevention of the release of DNA into
  the cytoplasm, degradation of specific DNA sensors, and inhibition of signaling
  proteins via protein-protein interactions.
