caption: Schematic representation the anti-inflammatory effects and the signalling
  pathways of the increasing c-Ski protein levels. The increasing c-Ski levels at
  the cellular level has anti-inflammatory effects through inhibiting TNF-α and IL-1β
  synthesis, cell invasion, and phagocytosis. Moreover, increasing c-Ski levels can
  promote the binding of p65 to c-Ski and thus decrease p65 acetylation. And, this
  effect was achieved through the deacetylation of p65 mediated by HDAC1
