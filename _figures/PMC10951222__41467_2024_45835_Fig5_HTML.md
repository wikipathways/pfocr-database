caption: Analysis of tumor phylogeny and clonal dynamics following CDK4/6i and anti-ER
  therapy revealed convergent (HER2 activation) and divergent (ER or PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  activation) paths to treatment resistance in tumors with distinct lineages (A, B).
  Evolutionary analysis, acquired genomic alterations to prior CDK4/6i, and treatment
  history is shown for patients with pre-CDK4/6i and post-CDK4/6i (trial baseline)
  biopsies. A shows convergent evolution of ERBB2 activation in two distinct co-existing
  tumor lineages (an activating clonal ERBB2L869R mutation and an acquired ERBB2 focal
  high amplification in 32_T1; an acquired activating high-clonality ERBB2L755S mutation
  in 32_BB1). B shows an increase in the clonality of an activating ESR1D538G mutation
  (from subclonal to clonal). C shows a case with two distinct co-existing tumor lineages
  in its post-CDK4/6i biopsies, each with clonal drivers mutations in divergent pathways
  (ER pathway with an activating clonal ESR1Y537S,L536P mutation in 22_T1; PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway with an activating clonal MTORT1977R mutation in 22_BB1). Even though no
  pre-CDK4/6i biopsy was available for this patient, targeted panel data from other
  post-CDK4/6i biopsies confirmed the existence of these tumor lineages. In a patient’s
  tumor phylogenic tree, each subclone is associated with a branch and a color, and
  this color matches the color in the pie chart that quantifies the relative abundance
  of each subclone in the tumor. The number of mutations unique to each subclone and
  known oncogenic mutations are shown next to each branch. Data shown in the clinical
  vignettes includes the timing of treatments and biopsies, and selected clinical,
  genomic, and transcriptomic features. Time on treatment for CDK4/6i-containing therapies
  is included in the figure. Acquired genomic alterations (in A, B) or putatively
  acquired genomic alterations (in C) following CDK4/6i therapy are shown in red,
  together with their associated transcriptomic features
