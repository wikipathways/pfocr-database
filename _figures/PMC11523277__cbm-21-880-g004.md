caption: The potential of ubiquitination modulation in osteosarcoma treatment. In
  the context of osteosarcoma, targeting ubiquitination pathways has emerged as a
  promising therapeutic strategy. Recent research has yielded significant advancements
  in prognostic assessment, overcoming drug resistance, and inhibiting tumor development
  through ubiquitination-based interventions. (A) New Luteinic acid interacts with
  USP9X to directly target the ubiquitination and degradation of the key transcription
  factor, sex determining region Y box protein 2 (SOX2), significantly inhibiting
  osteosarcoma cell proliferation. Pyrvinium pamoate, a casein kinase 1 (CK1α) activator,
  promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of connexin 43 (CX43), hindering osteosarcoma
  metastasis. Sorafenib and remifentanil ubiquitinate and degrade RAB22A-NEOF1, blocking
  RAB22A-NEOF1-driven lung metastasis. Camptothecin or adriamycin treatment reduces
  p53 ubiquitination, stabilizing p53 protein levels, and inhibiting osteosarcoma
  cell proliferation. Micafungin exerts its anti-tumor effect on osteosarcoma by downregulating
  USP7. Adriamycin, encapsulated in nanoparticles and combined with siRNA targeting
  RAD18, significantly inhibits tumor growth and metastasis by reducing RAD18 expression.
  (B) Research has demonstrated that in osteosarcoma patients, elevated levels of
  ubiquitin ligases RNF4, TRIM46, TRIM28, and the deubiquitinase USP47 are associated
  with poor prognosis, whereas elevated levels of ubiquitin ligases HACE and FBXW7
  indicate a favorable prognosis. (C) Mir-192-5p enhances the susceptibility of osteosarcoma
  cells to cisplatin by downregulating USP1 expression. Lamtor5-as1 increases chemosensitivity
  by inhibiting Nrf2 ubiquitination, leading to decreased Nrf2 transcriptional activity
  and disruption of the pro-survival loop in drug-resistant cells. Targeting DDRGK1
  can reduce its expression and further promote Nrf2 ubiquitination, enhancing tumor
  drug sensitivity. RGD exosome-delivered SIRAD18 effectively silences the ubiquitin
  ligase RAD18, potentially enhancing anti-tumor drug activity. Inhibiting E2F1-mediated
  retinoic acid receptor α ubiquitination can improve drug efficacy in osteosarcoma
  treatment. Vertiprofen (VP), in combination with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132,
  simultaneously inhibits the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and enhances chemotherapy
  sensitivity by regulating autophagy and protein homeostasis. Inhibiting miR-146b-5p
  and downregulating the cell surface E3 ligase, ZNRF3, ultimately sensitizes osteosarcoma
  cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. The E3 ligase, FBXW7, downregulates the calcium-activated
  potassium channel, KCa1.1, overcoming osteosarcoma drug resistance
