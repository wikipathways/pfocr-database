caption: Visual representation of β2 integrin structure and conserved regulatory conformations.
  (A) Organization of the domains composing the CD11 and CD18 chains (, ). The ligand
  binding α-I domain is highlighted by a hatched pattern. The metal ion-dependant
  adhesion site (MIDAS) and the socket for isoleucine (SILEN) motifs are located within
  the α-I domain (, ). The SILEN motif interacts with an invariant isoleucine located
  in the α7 helix to maintain the inactive conformation (). (B) Representation of
  the β2 integrin regulatory conformations. The bent-closed inactive conformation
  predominates under basal conditions (). Stimulation can activate the integrin and
  induce the extended-closed conformation. Additional stimulation and the binding
  of a divalent metal ion to the MIDAS motif, can induce the extended-open conformation.
  The bent-open conformation is stabilized by binding a cis ligand and may provide
  an alternative activation pathway to the extended-open conformation (–). The extended-open
  conformation is characterized by the separation of the cytosolic tails in additional
  to local conformational changes within the α-I domain, including shifting of the
  α7 helix (–, , ).
