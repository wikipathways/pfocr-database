caption: 'Possible role of AQPs in immune metabolism in sepsis: AQP3 and AQP9 facilitate
  the influx of glycerol into cells, which is converted to glycerol-3-phosphate by
  glycerol kinase 2 and then to dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP) by glycerol-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase 1. DHAP is incorporated into glycolysis and could increase glycolysis
  and lactate production. Lactate leads to increased expression of AQP1. In addition,
  AQP3 can also transport H2O2 (reactive oxygen species; ROS), which increases HIF-1
  alpha expression and nuclear translocation, which in turn increases AQP3 and glucose
  transporter type 1 (GLUT1) expression. Increased glycolysis further increases AQP3
  expression via SP1 through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway'
