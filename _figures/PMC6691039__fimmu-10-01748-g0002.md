caption: Endothelial theory. Similar to platelets invading pathogens bind either directly
  or indirectly to the vascular endothelium. Binding results in endothelial cell activation
  that results in apoptosis. Although the pathway to apoptosis has not yet been defined
  apoptosis leads to endothelial cell shrinkage and loss of barrier integrity leading
  to increased vascular permeability and shock. Separation of endothelial cells allows
  for pathogens to escape the bloodstream and infect major organs which eventually
  leads to multi organ failure. Endothelial cell activation also leads to granule
  secretion which deposits vonwillebrand factor on the surface of the endothelial
  cells. This encourages platelet rolling, activation and aggregate formation. In
  addition, bacteria also roll on the deposited vonwillebrand factor eventually coming
  to a halt and firmly adhering. Passing platelets bind to the immobilized bacteria
  on the endothelial cells which leads to inappropriate thrombus formation and exacerbation
  of the dysregulation.
