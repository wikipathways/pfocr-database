caption: 'Proposed signaling mechanisms regulating mean arterial pressure (MAP) and
  baroreflex function (BRS) within the brain dorsal medulla of transgenic rats with
  long-term alterations in brain renin-angiotensin system. A: oxidative stress but
  not MAPK signaling may be associated with hypertension and impaired autonomic function
  in transgenic (mRen2)27 rats with higher ANG II actions in the brain. ANG II produces
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) through NADPH oxidase and mitochondria. Both ANG II
  and ROS can activate MAPKs, which can further stimulate ROS production through activation
  of NADPH oxidase. Increased ROS or MAPK signaling can cause higher MAP and impaired
  BRS directly or through altered redox signaling and downstream gene expression changes
  leading to hypertension. ROS pathway is predominant in (mRen2)27 rats in the dorsal
  medullary region. B: reduced MAPK signaling may contribute to lower resting MAP
  and enhanced BRS in transgenic ASrAOGEN rats with higher ANG-(1–7) actions in the
  brain. ANG-(1–7) through upregulation of MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP-1) negatively
  regulates MAPK signaling. Whether unchanged levels of ROS in ASrAOGEN rats is through
  direct actions of ANG-(1–7) on NADPH oxidase or mitochondria, or through reduced
  MAPK signaling is not known (?). Reduced MAPK signaling within the brain dorsal
  medulla of ASrAOGEN rats may contribute to lower MAP and enhanced BRS through altered
  redox signaling and downstream gene expression changes.'
