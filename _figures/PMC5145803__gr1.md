caption: The redox states of the mitochondrial NAD and NADP pools are determined by
  a range of interconnected pathways. The redox state of cytosolic NAD and NADP, determined
  by the activities of glycolysis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), may be indirectly passed to the mitochondria via the malate-aspartate
  (MA) shuttle and citrate-α-ketoglutarate shuttles (Cα) respectively. These rely
  on the actions of the aspartate-glutamate (AGA) and malate α-ketoglutarate (MαA)
  antiporters and the citrate carrier (CC). Inside the mitochondria, pyruvate produced
  by glycolysis, imported via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), may be converted
  into acetyl CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, permitting its oxidation
  in the TCA cycle to produce NADH. This may then be used to produce ATP at the electron
  transport chain (ETC) or be converted into NADPH at the nicotinamide nucleotide
  transhydrogenase (NNT). NADPH may then be used to maintain the glutathione peroxidase
  (GPX) or peroxiredoxin (PRX) antioxidant systems via the glutathione (GR) and thioredoxin
  (TR) reductase enzymes.
