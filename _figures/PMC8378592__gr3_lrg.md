caption: Potential targets of miR-223, miR-98, miR-9, and miR-214 in NFκB pathway.
  Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) regulates genes played important roles in immunity,
  inflammation and cell survival. There are several pathways resulting in NF-kappa
  B-activation. The canonical pathway is induced by TNF-α, IL-1 or byproducts of bacterial
  and viral infections. This pathway depends on IKK- mediated IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation
  on Ser32 and 36, leading to its degradation, which allows the p50/p65 NF-kappa B
  dimer to enter the nucleus and activate gene transcription. The targets of the miR-223,
  miR-98, miR-9, and miR-214 in these pathway are shown using red arrows (KEGG PATHWAY
  database). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
  the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
