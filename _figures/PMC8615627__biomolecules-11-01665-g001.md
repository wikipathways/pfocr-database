caption: A schematic diagram shows the role of various lncRNAs in modulating the TGF-β/SMAD
  signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer. According to this cascade, when bioavailable
  TGF-β binds a homodimer of TβRII, transphosphorylation of the TβRI can trigger the
  activation of kinase activity. SMAD proteins, the substrates for TβRI kinases, are
  downstream of the BMP–analogous ligand–receptor systems. SMAD1, SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD5,
  and SMAD8 can bind to membrane-bound serine/threonine receptors and are up-regulated
  via their kinase function. As a co-factor, the Co-SMAD (SMAD4) can bind to the up-regulated
  R-SMAD to create a complex that translocates into the nucleus. Consequently, I-SMAD
  (SMAD7) can deactivate the impacts of R-SMADs [,]. Previous studies have authenticated
  that several lncRNAs can play an effective role in regulating the TGF-β/SMAD cascade
  in pancreatic cancer. LINC00462 can up-regulate expression levels of TGFBR1 and
  TGFBR2 and activate the SMAD2/3 pathway in pancreatic cancer cells through down-regulating
  miR-665 expression []. Furthermore, lncRNA XIST can promote TGF-β2 expression via
  inhibiting the expression of miR-141-3p, thus enhancing cell proliferation, migration,
  and invasion of PC cells []. Green arrows indicate the up-regulation of target genes
  by lncRNAs; red arrows depict the inhibitory effects of lncRNAs.
