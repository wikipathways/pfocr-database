caption: 'Schematic model showing the role of WED in regulating megakaryocyte differentiation
  and platelet generation. WED promotes megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet
  generation by activating the MAPK signaling pathway (RAS/MEK/ERK1/2) and modulating
  oxidative phosphorylation via the AMPK signaling pathway. Activation of MAPK signaling
  results in the upregulation of key hematopoietic transcription factors, including
  FOS, NF-E2, and GATA1, which are essential for megakaryocyte differentiation and
  maturation. This process ultimately leads to the restoration of platelet counts,
  as demonstrated in the RIT mice model. MEP: Megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor'
