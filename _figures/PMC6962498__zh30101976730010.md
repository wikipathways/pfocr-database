caption: Summarized connections among the amino acid pathway affected by Lactobacillus
  reuteri (LR)in healthy breastfed mice. Arrows indicate amino acid metabolites upregulated
  by LR in plasma. Three major circles affected by LR demonstrated as urea cycle,
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and methionine methylation cycle. Changed metabolites
  also related to polyamine pathway. SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; MTA, 5-methylthio-adenosine;
  SAH, S-adenosyl-homocysteine.
