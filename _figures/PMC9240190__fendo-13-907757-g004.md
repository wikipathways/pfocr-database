caption: 'NF-κB signaling pathway, the NLRP3 inflammasome, the TLR-MyD88 signaling
  pathway, and the Nrf2 signaling pathway. NF-κB signaling pathway: In DCM, AGEs bind
  to RAGE, which causes the activation of RelA (p65) or RelC-containing complexes.
  The phosphorylation of IKKβ causes phosphorylation of IκBα and its degradation,
  leading to the release of NF-κB dimers. Phosphorylated NF-κB dimers bind to NF-κB
  DNA response elements and induce the transcription of target genes. NLRP3 inflammasome:
  The NLRP3 inflammasome complex is composed of NLRP3, ASC, and pro-caspase-1. ROS
  and activated NF-κB can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. The activated inflammasome
  prompts ASC to cleave pro-caspase-1 to active caspase-1, which induces the maturation
  of IL-1β and IL-18, thereby inducing an inflammatory response. TLR4-MyD88 signaling
  pathway: AGE production is induced by OS and high glucose concentrations, and AGEs
  bind to MD2, leading to the formation of a TLR4/MD2 complex, which activates MyD88.
  In turn, MyD88 activates IRAKs and TRAF6, which activates TAK1 and the transcription
  factors MAPK and NF-κB. This transcription factor induces proinflammatory cytokine
  gene expression. Nrf2 signaling pathway: Nrf2 binds to its inhibitory protein Kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1) to form a stable complex. When it is activated
  by OS, Nrf2 is released and phosphorylated, and activated Nrf2 is translocated to
  the nucleus where it binds to antioxidant-responsive elements (AREs), initiating
  the transcription of antioxidant genes, including heme oxygenase-1(HO-1), NAD(P)H
  dehydrogenase, SOD, and catalase. NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IKKβ, IkB kinase β;
  NLRP3, NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain-associated protein 3; ASC, apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing a CARD; pro-caspase-1, pro-cysteinyl aspartate specific
  proteinase-1; MD2, myeloid differentiation-2; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary
  response protein 88; IRAK, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase; TRAF6, TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6; TAK1, transforming growth factor-activated kinase 1; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; Keap-1, Kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein-1; AREs, antioxidant-responsive elements; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1.'
