caption: Regulatory mechanisms of δ-catenin associated with neural development and
  function. Co-localization and direct interaction of dynamin 2/NPRAP in neuroblastoma
  in vivo; NPRAP/δ-catenin is involved in synaptic junctions through its carboxy-terminal
  binding to the last PDZ structural domain of S-SCAM; Densin-180 co-localizes with
  δ-catenin/NPRAP; δ-catenin is transiently palmitoylated by DHHC5, and palmitoylation
  increases δ-catenin-adhesion protein interactions at the synapse; δ-catenin interacts
  directly with Shank3, which allows targeting of postsynaptic sites. Shank3 is an
  upstream node of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and Rictor is a key regulatory
  and structural subunit of mTORC2 signaling. Downregulation of Rictor leads to altered
  expression of postsynaptic proteins such as GluR1 and ELKS; GSK-3β forms a complex
  with delta-catenin
