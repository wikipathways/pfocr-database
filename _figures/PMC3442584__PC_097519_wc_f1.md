caption: Proposed Biosynthetic Pathways Leading to the Formation of Benzoyl-CoA and
  Benzenoid/Phenylpropanoid Volatile Compounds in Petunia Flowers.Solid arrows indicate
  established biochemical reactions, and broken arrows depict possible steps not yet
  described. Stacked arrows show the involvement of multiple enzymatic steps. Gray
  arrow shows a potential step. Volatile benzenoid/phenylpropanoid compounds are highlighted
  with a blue background. The CoA-dependent β-oxidative pathway leading to benzoyl-CoA
  formation is localized in peroxisomes and shown with a pink background. -CoA, benzoyl-CoA;
