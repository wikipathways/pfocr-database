caption: Putative pathway for antagonistic Rab35/Arf6 regulation in presynaptic terminals.
  Rab35 activation by high neuronal firing rates leads to Hrs binding, ESCRT pathway
  recruitment, and subsequent SV protein degradation as shown in . Rab35 activation
  may also induce binding with its effector MICAL-L1, leading to the recruitment of
  additional Rab GTPases (Rabs 8 and 13) to catalyze downstream SV protein degradation
  and/or trafficking events. Finally, Rab35 activation may simultaneously inactivate
  Arf6 via ACAP2, a Rab35 effector and Arf6 GAP. On the other hand, Arf6 activation
  in response to low or moderate neuronal activity is hypothesized to promote SV protein
  recycling back to the readily-releasable pool, while inactivating Rab35 activity
  via EPI64B, an Arf6 effector and Rab35 GAP. TBC1D24/Sky may serve as a GAP for both
  Rab35 and Arf6. Additional work is needed to verify these pathways and determine
  the cellular signals responsible for Arf6 and Rab35 activation/inactivation at presynaptic
  terminals.
