caption: 'High-fat diet (HFD) and energy-restricted diet modulate the function of
  hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). (A): HFD causes HSCs to leave their quiescent state
  and generate myeloid differentiation. HFD feeding during pregnancy leads to impaired
  engraftment capacity and decreased numbers of HSPCs in offspring. (B): Dietary restriction
  (DR) promotes the self-renewal of aging HSCs by reducing serum insulin-like growth
  factor-1 (IGF-1) levels and inhibiting the mitochondrial unfolded protein response
  (UPRmt). DR downregulates lymphoid-specific gene expression, which can lead to an
  increased myeloid differentiation of HSCs. (C): Severe energy-restricted diet (SERD)
  leads to a reduction in the number of bone marrow (BM) cells and erythroid progenitor
  cells, resulting in BM atrophy and suppression of hematopoiesis. The absence of
  the seizure threshold 2 (SZT2) and tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) leads to
  the activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mechanistic targeting of rapamycin
  complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathways, which causes depletion of HSCs. (Created
