caption: 'G. barbadense showed a longer transition stage with overlapping fiber elongation
  and secondary cell wall (SCW) synthesis than G. hirsutum. Metabolic pathways were
  differentially regulated during fiber development, and pectin and cellulose metabolism
  in particular affected fiber elongation and SCW biosynthesis. In the SCW synthesis
  stage (represented by 25 DPA), the auxin signaling pathway and pectin modification
  genes were up-regulated in G. barbadense compared with G. hirsutum, and the SCW
  synthesis genes were repressed. In G. hirsutum pathways producing cellulose were
  enhanced, while auxin and pectin modification were repressed. Selected genes were
  also analyzed by qRT-PCR as in . Red represents up-regulated in TM-1, green represents
  up-regulated in Hai7124. Underlined genes were differentially expressed only at
  10 DPA. The abbreviations used are: day post-anthesis (DPA); chalcone synthase (CHS);
  quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT); antiauxin-resistant 3 (AAR3); auxin response
  factor 2 (ARF2); auxin-responsive protein (ARP); GAST1 protein homolog 1 (GASA1);
  1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC); ACC synthase 6 (ACS6); Ca2+-dependent
  protein kinase (CDPK); calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein; ethylene-responsive transcription
  factor (ERF); protein phosphatase 2C family protein (PP2C); abscisic acid (ABA);
  responsive to abscisic acid 1B (Rab1B); NADPH oxidase (NOX); Cell wall ezymes: pectin
  methylesterase (PME); pectate lyase (PEL); polygalacturonase (PG); polygalacturonase
