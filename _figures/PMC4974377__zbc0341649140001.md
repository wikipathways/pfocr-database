caption: 'Schematic representation of the biosynthetic pathway to nicotine and tropine
  indicating the common and unique steps. Carbon atoms on the final compounds are
  numbered according to the IUPAC nomenclature and this numbering is used to indicate
  the carbon positions from which they are derived in the precursor molecules. Numbers
  in normal bold font refer to tropine; numbers in italic bold font refer to nicotine.
  The enzymes indicated are: a, ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17); b, putrescine
  N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.53); c, N-methylputrescine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.6); d,
  undescribed activity, probably spontaneous (); e, nicotine synthase (undescribed
  activity, but see Ref. ); f, undescribed activity.'
