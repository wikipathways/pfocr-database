caption: DDX3 is involved in Wnt/β-catenin pathway. When Wnt/β-catenin signaling is
  activated, the Wnt ligands bind to the Frizzled receptor and the co-receptor lipoprotein
  receptor related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) in the membrane. Then, the Dishevelled (Dvl)
  gathers the cytoplasmic Axin and GSK3β into the membrane, and facilitate the activated
  β-catenin translocating from cytoplasm to nucleus. The nucleus β-catenin could interact
  with two major transcription factors, the T-cell factor (TCF) and lymphocyte enhancer
  factor (LEF), accompanied with several transcription co-activators, BCL9, CBP, p300,
  Pygo, to regulate multiple genes transcription. These downstream target genes mainly
  include Snail1, MMP7, PAI1, RAS, and Fibronectin. For the role of DDX3 in Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling, DDX3 could directly bind to CK1ε, stimulate its kinase activity and further
  promote the phosphorylation of the scaffold protein Dvl, so as to facilitate β-catenin
  translocating into the nucleus. Moreover, up-regulation of DDX3 expression contributes
  to the induction of TCF reporter activity and the elevation of mRNA expression levels
  of TCF-regulated downstream genes, such as c-MYC, AXIN2, CCND1 and BIRC5A.
