caption: Schematic overview of study results. Retinal ischemia/reperfusion led to
  a progressive microglia activation. At early time points (2 to 24 h) after an ischemic
  injury, the immune response seemed to be mediated mainly by TLR2. The following
  cascade included MyD88, which activated NFκB. This transcription factor led to the
  release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and TGFβ. TLR3
  was also upregulated and a MyD88-independent signaling pathway was activated in
  the immune response via NFκB. An activation of the initiator caspase 8 in retinal
  ganglion cells was noted at early time points, while the effector caspase 3 was
  enhanced throughout the study
