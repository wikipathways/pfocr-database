caption: Identification of transcripts and proteins associated with hemocytes. Representation
  of putative immune components present in circulating squid hemocytes. Interactions
  with symbiotic and/or non-symbiotic bacteria likely involve recognition by host
  PRRs, like PGRPs and TLR. Down stream signaling via the NF-κB pathway may modulate
  immune effector response. Putative members of a complement cascade as well as other
  immune-related genes were also expressed in circulating hemocytes. Colonization
  state influenced expression of a subset of these genes (*; Figure ), suggesting
  that V. fischeri can modulate the host’s cellular innate immune response. (#), immune
  gene not identified in this study (Goodson et al., ; Rader et al., unpublished data).
  Localizations are inferred from protein domain predictions as well as similarity
  to other systems.
