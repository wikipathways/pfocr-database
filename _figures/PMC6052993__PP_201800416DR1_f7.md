caption: Mutant seeds deficient in PA synthesis have increased permeability to Toluidine
  Blue. A, Toluidine Blue permeability tests were performed on ABA-treated (ruptured
  testa) seeds lacking regulators of flavonoid synthesis. B, Schematic of the flavonoid
  biosynthesis pathway. The three major end products, flavonols, anthocyanins, and
  PAs, are indicated in boldface colors; the different flavonoid biosynthesis mutants
  used are indicated next to the arrows. Toluidine Blue permeability tests were performed
  on ABA-treated (ruptured testa) wild-type (WT) and mutant seeds as indicated. Arrows
  in the pathway may represent several enzymatic steps. Permeability tests performed
  on PAC-treated seeds (with unruptured testa) are presented in Supplemental Figure
  S5.
