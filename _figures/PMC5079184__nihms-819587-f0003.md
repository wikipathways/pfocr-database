caption: Interleukin-15 (IL-15) and non-classical MHC class I molecules are induced
  on tissue cells by cellular stress. IL-15-induced signalling in T cells activates
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), JUN
  N-terminal kinase (JNK) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Natural killer group
  2, member D (NKG2D), which associates with the adaptor molecule DNAX-activation
  protein 10 (DAP10; containing a PI3K activation motif), additionally activates VAV–growth
  factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ). Both IL-15 and
  NKG2D can hence co-stimulate T cell receptor (TCR) signalling and enhance TCR-mediated
  effector functions and cell survival. As a result, IL-15-induced signalling in cytotoxic
  T lymphocytes (CTLs) substantially reduces the TCR activation threshold, enabling
  CTLs to recognize low-avidity antigens and acquire the potential for autoreactivity.
  Furthermore, by functioning as a co-stimulatory molecule for the NKG2D-mediated
  signalling pathway, IL-15 enables NKG2D to mediate direct cytolysis (that is, lymphokine-activated
  killer (LAK) activity), independently from signalling through the TCR. In addition,
  IL-15 activates the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT) pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 and the formation
  of STAT dimers that traffic to the nucleus for transcriptional activation. How the
  JAK–STAT pathway intersects with TCR and NKG2D signalling remains to be determined.
