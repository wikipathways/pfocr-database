caption: The Citrate (TCA) Cycle. A, A KEGG map showing the proteins in association
  with the Citrate cycle (TCA) pathway. Boxes in gray show the proteins that were
  identified in rotifer eggs. Boxes in red show proteins that were significantly more
  abundant in AM versus RE. Yellow boxes show the proteins that were detected only
  in AM eggs. Statistically significant differences were indicated by 1-Way ANOVA
  test (FDR p value 0.05, FC>3), B, A comparison of the log2 relative intensities
  of compounds between AM and RE, as determined by metabolome analyses. Blue columns
  - AM eggs, Red columns- RE. A star indicates statistical significant differences
  (t test; p < 0.05).
