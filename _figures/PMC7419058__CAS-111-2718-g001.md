caption: Regulation of p53 activity by FBXO22 during senescence. All known senescence‐inducing
  stimuli activate p53 through DNA damage responses (DDR). Activated p53 then transcriptionally
  induces FBXO22. An increase in FBXO22 complexed with SCF and KDM4A targets methylated
  p53 for ubiquitylation. Acetylation of p53 by CBP/p300 and PHF20 binding to methylated
  p53 suppresses SCF‐FBXO22‐KDM4A mediated ubiquitylation of p53. Ubiquitylated p53
  is degraded through a proteasome pathway. Downregulation of p53 activity at the
  late phase of senescence triggers the induction of p16 and SASP, the former being
  essential for durable cessation of cell proliferation and the latter causing acceleration
  in aging phenotypes through induction of tissue microinflammation
