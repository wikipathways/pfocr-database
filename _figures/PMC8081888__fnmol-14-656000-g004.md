caption: 'Metabolic landscape of the vertebrate outer retina. Representation of known
  metabolic interactions of cells within the outer retina. Glucose from the choroidal
  blood supply transverses the endothelium and enters the RPE via GLUT1. In the RPE,
  glucose flows through the cell un-metabolized, thus reaching the basal membrane
  adjacent to PhR OS. Glucose leaves the RPE via GLUT1 into the PhR layer. PhRs take
  up glucose via GLUT1 and use it to fuel aerobic glycolysis. Aerobic glycolysis in
  PhRs fuels the PPP, creating nucleic acids and offsetting ROS production from mitochondrial
  activity, and creates DHAP which is used to synthesize phospholipids necessary to
  create OS disks thus driving OS growth and PhR function. Lactate from aerobic glycolysis
  is transported from PhRs to the extracellular space where it is taken up by other
  cells such as MGC and RPE, fueling TCA cycle and OXPHOS in these cells. RPE cells
  take up lactate and transform into pyruvate, which enters the TCA. This LDHB activity
  depletes available NAD+, effectively inhibiting glycolysis, allowing glucose to
  reach GLUTs in the basal RPE membrane. Extending OS tips externalize PS and contact
  with RPE projections and subsequent phagocytosis leads to Akt activation, which
  also downregulates glycolysis in these cells. PhR OS phagocytosis in the RPE leads
  to an increase in available fatty acids from breaking down the membranous lipid
  disks. These fatty acids undergo β-oxidation creating ketone bodies in the form
  of β-hydroxybutyrate, which can be further metabolized and used in the TCA cycle,
  supplementing RPE mitochondrial activity. Both fatty acids and ketone bodies are
  transported to the PhR layer where they are taken up by these and used to supplement
  TCA cycle and OXPHOS. A reciprocal malate-succinate shuttle between PhRs and RPE
  cells exists that exchanges reducing power between these cells. In PhR, reverse
  SDH activity, due to hypoxia-induced decrease of COXIV, produces succinate that
  is exported to RPE cells, where it is oxidized in the TCA cycle and generates a
  surplus of malate. Malate is then exported to the PhR layer, enters the TCA cycle
  and fuels succinate production. Rods effectively promote cone survival and function
  by secreting RdCVF, which binds and makes a complex with BSG1 and GLUT1 in the cone
  membrane, promoting glucose supply to these cells. Abbreviations: ADP, adenosine
