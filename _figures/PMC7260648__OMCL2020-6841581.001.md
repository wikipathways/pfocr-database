caption: 'The mechanisms underlying cytoplasmic organellar dysfunction after chemotherapy
  and melatonin''s protective effects under these conditions. Melatonin reverses chemotherapy-induced
  ER stress, as well as nucleus and mitochondrial dysfunction. In the mitochondrion,
  chemotherapy drugs lead to electron leakage and excessive free radical production.
  The ROS directly causes oxidative damage to the mitochondrial respiratory chain,
  further resulting in elevated electron leakage, free radical production, and ATP
  depletion. Moreover, ROS injures mitophagy, mtDNA, and the mitochondrial membrane
  structure (TOM complex reduction and mitochondrial membrane lipid peroxidation increases
  and elevates mPTP opening), leading to membrane potential loss and proapoptosis
  factor release. Apart from directly scavenging free radicals, melatonin protects
  against mtDNA damage/mutation, activates the antioxidant defense system, activates
  SIRT3 to scavenge ROS, and upregulates the TOM complex, the entry gate for the majority
  of precursor proteins that are imported into the mitochondria. However, the role
  of melatonin in mitophagy is less clear. Melatonin inhibits chemotherapy-induced
  stimulation of ERK1/2, followed via enhanced phosphorylation of p53 by the upregulation
  of genes such as Bax, thus resulting in mPTP opening. In the nucleus, melatonin
  upregulates Nrf2 and HO-1 expression and decreases TNF-α and IL-1β levels, thus
  contributing to cell protection. In the ER, melatonin reverses chemotherapy-induced
  ER stress via the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. As a consequence, melatonin
  protects diverse organs after chemotherapy. Abbreviations: Akt, protein kinase B;
