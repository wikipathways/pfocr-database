caption: Dynamic cellular and molecular interplay underlying thrombo-inflammation.
  Pathogen- or danger-signal mediated activation of endothelial cells at the site
  of disrupted glycocalyx results in adhesion of immune cells (e.g., monocytes) on
  the cell surface. Activated endothelial and immune cells release microvesicles (MV)
  bearing, e.g., tissue factor (TF) which induces activation of extrinsic coagulation
  pathway. TF is also capable to activate NLRP3 inflammasome [subsequent activation
  of interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-18] and inflammatory response. Furthermore, endothelial
  cell activation results in adhesion of platelets which act as chemo-attractants
  (e.g., via P-selectin) to neutrophils. As consequence, neutrophil activation results
  in formation and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) composed of several
  pro-inflammatory molecules, neutrophile elastase (E), myeloperoxidase (M), histones
  (H3 and 4), which perpetuate endothelial dysfunction. NETs activate coagulation
  FXII and the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Subsequent enhanced fibrin formation
  leads to the capture and kill of pathogens in fibrin-strengthened NETs. Procoagulant
  platelets also release platelet factor 4 (PF4) which inactivates glycosaminoglycans
  (GAGs) such as heparin. On the other hand, these thrombo-inflammatory mechanisms
  are accompanied by inactivation of cytoprotective anticoagulants such as activated
  protein C, antithrombin (AT), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and protein
  S.
