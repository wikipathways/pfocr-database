caption: JAK-STAT pathway in the signaling of inflammatory cytokines. JAK proteins
  are intracellular cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases constitutively associated with intracellular
  domains of type I and/or type II cytokine receptors; every JAK isoform exhibits
  binding preferences for different cytokines receptors. Once the extracellular ligand
  binds the receptor, JAKs activate in pairs via phosphorylation and downstream activate
  STAT transcription factors. This pathway regulates cellular growth, differentiation,
  migration, and survival, especially of the T lymphocytes. Created by Biorender.com.
