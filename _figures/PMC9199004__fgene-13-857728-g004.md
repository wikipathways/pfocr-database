caption: 'DM and molecule network related to senescence pathway regulation in ZIKV+.
  The network was built using IPA software. Each molecule was represented as a node,
  and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge (line).
  All edges are supported by at least one reference from the literature or canonical
  information stored in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base (IKB). The central nodes are
  connected to multiple other molecules. The ZIKV + network showed some molecules
  as central nodes: interferon-alpha, CXCL10, interferon-gamma (IFNG), interferon
  regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), miR-125a-5p and its experimentally validated target
  ELAV like RNA-binding protein 1 (ELAV1). The molecules are represented in a gradient
  of orange or blue based on the prediction status, activated or inhibited, respectively.'
