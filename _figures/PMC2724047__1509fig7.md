caption: Regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism and cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic
  pathways by bile acids. Bile acids regulate glucose metabolism in hepatocytes by
  activating the insulin signaling pathway and by induction of the gene encoding SHP.
  Conjugated bile acids activate the insulin signaling pathway (pAKT) via surface
  G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which activates glycogen synthase activity
  and inhibits gluconeogenesis by phosphorylation of FOX01. SHP is known to interact
  with FOX01, a transcription factor known to upregulate gluconeogenic genes. Phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase 1 (PDK-1), a kinase in the insulin signaling pathway, is known to
  phosphorylate and activate protein kinase Cζ (PCKζ). PKCζ is proposed to phosphorylate
  FXR, enhancing the ability of conjugated bile acids to induce the gene encoding
  SHP. SHP can also downregulate the gene encoding SREBP1-c, which controls the rate
  of FA synthesis. Bile acids can activate JNK 1/2 in hepatocyte cultures by stimulating
  ceramide synthesis. In vivo, bile acids can activate the JNK 1/2 pathway by stimulating
  the synthesis of fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF-15/19) in the intestines. Finally,
  TNF-α and IL-1 can also activate the JNK 1/2 pathway downregulating CYP7A1. Bold
  lines indicate pathways activated by bile acids.
