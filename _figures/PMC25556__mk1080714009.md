caption: Two models for the role of nucleotide cycling and factors that regulate it
  in Ypt/Rab-mediated vesicular transport, using Ypt1p as an example. (A) Conventional
  model (; ). In addition to GEFs and GAPs, two other factors that influence nucleotide
  cycling of Ypt/Rab proteins are GDI and GDI-dissociation factor (GDF). GDI is implicated
  in the recycling of Ypt/Rab proteins between membranes (; ), and GDFs are thought
  to function as receptors or chaperones for Ypt/Rab proteins (). Step I, recruitment
  of Ypt1p-GDP to the donor membrane by GDF and nucleotide exchange by GEF to yield
  Ypt1p-GTP are shown; Ypt1p-GTP is present on forming secretory vesicles. Step II,
  GTP hydrolysis is required or is coupled with fusion of secretory vesicles with
  the acceptor compartment. Step III, GDI recycles Ypt1p-GDP back to the donor membrane.
  (B) New model, based on this article and our previous work (; ). Step I, Ypt1p-GDP
  is recruited to the vesicle (or the donor membrane) by GDF. Step II, nucleotide
  exchange by GEF is coupled to vesicle fusion with the acceptor compartment. Step
  III, GTP hydrolysis occurs late in the pathway to generate Ypt1p-GDP, and GDI recycles
  Ypt1p-GDP for the next cycle. The important features that distinguish this model
  from the conventional model are the major role suggested for nucleotide exchange
  and the factor that mediates it (GEF), the minor role of GTP hydrolysis and GAP
  not in vesicle fusion but in Ypt1p recycling, and the suggested localization of
  these regulators. If GAP localizes to the plasma membrane, as shown here, it might
  have a role in GDI-mediated Ypt/Rab protein recycling (which is not required for
  Ypt1p function). In ypt1-Q67L mutant cells, when GTP hydrolysis is defective, Ypt1p-GTP
  might be recycled via a GDI-independent mechanism. If GAP localizes to the ER, it
  might be there to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Ypt1p to allow better interaction
  with the GEF in the next cycle (see DISCUSSION).
