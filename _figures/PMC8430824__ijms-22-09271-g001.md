caption: Schematic diagram of the ferroptosis signaling pathway. The ferroptosis pathway
  is triggered by several different classes of small molecules, centered on GPX4 and
  FSP1. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) hydrolyzes lipid peroxides to harmless lipid
  alcohols (-OH). GPX4 requires glutathione (GSH) as a cofactor, which is oxidized
  by GPX4 (GSSG) and then reduced to GSH by glutathione reductase (GR). GSH synthesis
  is dependent on cysteine transported by system Xc- (also called SLC7A11). Ferroptosis
  suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) produces ubiquinol from ubiquinone independently of
  GSH, and acts as a lipophilic radical scavenger in the membrane, protecting it from
  ferroptosis. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycles
  are required for ferroptosis caused by cystine depletion and system Xc-. p53 acts
  positively against ferroptosis by promoting SAT1, GLS2, and CDKN1A, and inhibiting
  DPP4 and SLCA11. It is thought that p53 acts both positively and negatively on ferroptosis.
