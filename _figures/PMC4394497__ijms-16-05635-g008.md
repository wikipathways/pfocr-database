caption: The presence of a β2-AR ligand during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phorbol
  12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced macrophage activation causes reduced or increased
  production of TNF-α, IL-12 and nitric oxide respectively. The β2-AR-induced immunosuppression
  in LPS-treated macrophages is consistent with the activation of adenylyl cyclase
  (AC), and subsequently PKA. LPS promotes adenylyl cyclase activity, suppresses translocation
  of GRK2 to the membrane, and reduces the expression of GRKs 5 and 6. These LPS-induced
  effects are expected to increase β2-AR signaling via the cAMP-PKA canonical pathway.
  In contrast, the β2-AR-induced immune enhancement in PMA-treated macrophages is
  not consistent with receptor activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway. Instead, we propose
  that the responsible mechanism is a shift in receptor signaling from the canonical
  to the non-canonical pathway.
