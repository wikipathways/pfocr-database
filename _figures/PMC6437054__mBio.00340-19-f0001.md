caption: Interaction map and annotation enrichment of the newly synthesized mazEF-related
  proteins. String software was used to analyze the interactions. The nodes are colors
  based on the enriched annotations as detailed here. For Gene Ontology Biological
  Process (GOBP) identifier (ID) 0043335, the pathway was protein unfolding, the gene
  count was 4, the FDR was 3.19e–05, and the color is blue. For GOBP ID 0006950, the
  pathway was response to stress, the gene count was 16, the FDR was 0.00567, and
  the color is red. For GOBP ID 0019538, the pathway was protein metabolic process,
  the gene count was 14, the FDR was 0.015, and the color is green. For GOBP ID 0006457,
  the pathway was protein folding, the gene count was 5, the FDR was 0.0324, and the
  color is light green. For KEGG ID 03018, the pathway was RNA degradation, the gene
  count was 3, the FDR was 0.0445, and the color is yellow. For InterPro ID IPR003959,
  the pathway was ATPase with the AAA-type core, the gene count was 5, the FDR was
  9.23e–06, and the color is pink.
