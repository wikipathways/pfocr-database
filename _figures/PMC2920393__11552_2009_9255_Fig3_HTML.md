caption: Schematic diagram of Dupuytren’s disease stages. Evidence has shown that
  hypoxia due to environmental stimuli may lead to the characteristic increase in
  inflammatory mediators, including growth factors, following antigen presentation
  via HLA–T-cell interaction. In turn, fibroblasts differentiate and proliferate causing
  fibromatosis. This gives rise to fibrous cords and contracture. Autoantibodies have
  also been shown to be augmented in DD tissue. MCPJ metacarpophalangeal joint, PIPJ
  proximal interphalangeal joint. The two major pathways are autoimmunity (pathway
  a) and via hypoxia-mediated fibrosis (pathway b).
