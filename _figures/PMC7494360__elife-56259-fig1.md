caption: In addition to the observed increases in myoglobin content, increases in
  the activities of hexokinase, ATP synthase, HOAD, and complex II (succinate dehydrogenase),
  and decreases in activities of pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine
  kinase and complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), we observed no changes in activity
  for the enzymes citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase,
  complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase), and adenylate kinase.

  ancestry across Andean waterfowl.
