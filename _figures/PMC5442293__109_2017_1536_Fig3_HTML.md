caption: Model for WIP1 involvement in tumorigenesis and in therapeutic response.
  Activation of oncogenes (such as RAS and MYC) causes replication stress, stimulates
  p53 activity, and results in permanent cell cycle arrest called oncogene-induced
  senescence (OIS). Inactivating mutation of TP53, overexpression of WIP1, or amplification
  of PPM1D leads to suppression of p53 pathway, disables establishment of OIS, and
  promotes tumor formation. Inhibition of WIP1 does not affect proliferation of cancer
  cells with mutant TP53 whereas it allows partial reactivation of p53 pathway in
  cells with wild-type TP53 slowing down their proliferation. Combination of WIP1
  inhibition with MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3 or with DNA damage-inducing chemotherapy
  allows maximal activation of p53 pathway leading to induction of cell death or senescence
  and preventing tumor growth
