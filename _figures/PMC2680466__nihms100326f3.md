caption: Pathway representation of relative expression levels by tissue. The line
  thicknesses reflect the (34-CT) levels for each gene with thicker lines denoting
  greater RNA transcript levels. Dotted lines indicate that the (34 - CT) value was
  0 or less than 0 and that there was no significant amount of transcript.
