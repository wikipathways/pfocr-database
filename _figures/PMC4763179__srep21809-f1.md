caption: (A) L. lactis biofilm expressing the III7–10 fragment of the human fibronectin
  on its cell wall, fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter, acting
  as a biointerface for bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells. (B) Recombinant
  human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) was added in the cell culture medium at 100 ng/mL to induce
  osteogenic differentiation. BMPR1/2 signalling through the Smad pathway leads to
  activation of the transcription factors Osterix, RunX2 and Dlx5 which induces expression
  of proteins involved in osteogenic differentiation. (C) L. lactis biofilm is able
  to support hMSCs growth and differentiation for up to 28 days, while keeping good
  viability values and stable morphology.
