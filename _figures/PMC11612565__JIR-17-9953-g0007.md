caption: The relationship of EC autophagy and function and EC autophagy-related mechanisms
  in sepsis. The impact of EC autophagy on its function is controversial. Late endosomal-dependent
  mitophagy induced by the SIRT1-Rab7 axis can attenuate NLRP3 and STING activation,
  thereby improving EC dysfunction, including inflammation and barrier function. APOL1
  risk variants can inhibit mitophagy, leading to the leakage of mtDNA into the cytoplasm,
  activation of NLRP3 and STING, and ultimately resulting in EC dysfunction. However,
  EC autophagy activated by thrombin or beclin 1 increases the degradation of VE-cadherin,
  which is important in maintaining EC barrier function. Moreover, EC autophagy-related
  mechanisms are mainly involved in the mTOR signaling pathway. Non-coding RNAs, such
  as circEXOC5, miR-210-3p, and miR-300, can also regulate EC autophagy. Created in
