caption: A schematic model of the HOG pathway proteins that are involved in the HKR1
  subbranch (shown in lavender). Proteins that are specific to the SLN1 branch are
  colored blue, and those that are involved in the MSB2 subbranch are colored green.
  The proteins separated by a slash are functionally redundant. Not all of the known
  components are shown. The yellow horizontal bar represents the plasma membrane (PM).
  Arrows indicate activation, whereas the inverted T-shaped bars represent inhibition.
