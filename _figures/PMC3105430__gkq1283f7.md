caption: 'Schematic representation of the roles of Ptiwi proteins in sRNA pathways.
  SiRNA pathway (left): In vegetative cells, dsRNA may be formed by the pairing of
  sense and antisense aberrant transcripts during transgene-induced silencing, or
  imported from the food vacuoles during dsRNA-induced silencing. Primary siRNAs generated
  through the action of Dcr1 and different RdRPs () are then be loaded onto Ptiwi13
  and/or Ptiwi14, resulting in cleavage of homologous mRNAs at least in the case of
  dsRNA-induced silencing. In that case, further RdRP activity using the mRNA as a
  template would generate antisense secondary siRNAs which may be loaded onto Ptiwi12
  and Ptiwi15 to amplify the silencing response. ScnRNA pathway (right): promiscuous
  bidirectional transcription of the MAC genome occurs at low levels during vegetative
  growth. Upon meiosis, bidirectional transcription of the MIC genome forms dsRNA
  which is cleaved into scnRNA duplexes by Dcl2 and Dcl3. The guide strands of scnRNAs
  are then loaded onto Ptiwi01 and Ptiwi09 in the cytoplasm and transported to the
  old MAC where they would scan nascent transcripts with the help of the Nowa1 and
  2 proteins. ScnRNAs able to find a perfect match would be sequestered or degraded,
  so that only those homologous to MIC-specific sequences would later be available
  to target epigenetic modifications on these sequences in the developing new MAC,
  eventually leading to their elimination.'
