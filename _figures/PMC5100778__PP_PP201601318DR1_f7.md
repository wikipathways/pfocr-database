caption: Components of the glycerol metabolic network and mitochondrial  under multiple
  O3 and herbivory stress treatments. Comparative correlation analysis and predictive  network
  interactions (AraNet and GeneMANIA) are shown. A, Comparative correlation analysis
  between glycerol, components of the  shuttle (GPDHC1 and SDP6), mitochondrial  complex
  II (SDH1-1), and flavin monoxygenases (NOGC1 and FMO). Treatments are O, P, and
  OP. Edges indicate ρ for positive (blue) and negative (red) correlations. All correlation
  values reported were significant (between P < 0.05 and P < 0.001), except the two
  correlations in the sequential (OP) treatment of glycerol/FMO (ρ = 0.85) and SDP6/SDH1
  (ρ = 0.48), which were not significant. B, Average relative gene expression (log2)
  and glycerol abundance for each treatment (O, P, and OP) and corresponding Student’s
  t test significance (*, P < 0.05 and **, P < 0.01) compared with the control conditions.
  C, Gene interactions predicted in AraNet for the glycerol metabolic network. Entry
  genes (in black squares) and emerging new members of a pathway are colored by  categories
  after enrichment analysis (GOlorize/Cytoscape). Predicted interactions with members
  of the mitochondrial  complex II, SDH, are highlighted in the box. D, Gene interactions
  generated in GeneMANIA between query genes SDH1-1, SDP6, GPDHc1, NOGC1, and FMO.
  Node functions related the genes to processes of energy and mitchonodria metabolism.
  Functional links indicated coexpression (purple), colocalization (blue), predicted
  interaction (orange), and shared protein domains (brown) between the network components.
