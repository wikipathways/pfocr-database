caption: Figure 1. (A) Schematic representation of the relevant molecular partners/substrates
  of GRK2 and HDAC6 involved in the migration of different cell types. The overall
  effect of GRK2 and HDAC6 on cell migration (either positive or negative), as well
  as the relative contribution of their catalytic or scaffolding-dependent activities,
  will be dependent on the cell type and the signaling context. See main text for
  details. (B) Model depicting the intertwinement of GRK2-mediated regulation of GIT-1
  scaffolding functions and of HDAC6’s tubulin-deacetylase activity in directed cell
  motility. In the lamellipodium, GRK2 would be recruited in a Gβγ-dependent manner
  to sites of the plasma membrane wherein chemotactic activation is taking place.
  At such specific locations, the dynamic association of GRK2 to the GIT1 scaffold
  (enhanced upon tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2 and decreased upon phosphorylation
  by ERK at S670), would facilitate the localized activation of the Rac/PAK/MEK/ERK
  pathway, leading to increased focal contact turnover and cortical F-actin polymerization.
  Concomitantly, phosphorylation of GRK2 at S670 by MAPK would switch on the ability
  of GRK2 to phosphorylate co-localized HDAC6. Phosphorylated HDAC6 would display
  a higher deacetylase activity toward tubulin, contributing to keep down the acetylation
  of pioneer, highly dynamic MTs specifically at the lamellipodium. The presence of
  hypoacetylated MTs would stimulate cortical F-actin polymerization by helping to
  recruit at their plus-ends different Rac activators, such as IQGAP1 via the MT-interacting
  +TIP protein CLIP-170 or other small G proteins-GEF activities. In addition, targeting
  of focal contacts by dynamic cortical MTs at the lamellipodium prevents their maturation
  into focal adhesions. Theses contacting MTs release “relaxing” signals that trigger
  dissolution of focal contacts, probably as result of the local, +TIP protein-mediated
  downregulation of RhoA. The concerted action of hypoacetylated MTs and GIT-1 signalosomes
  at the leading edge of migrating cells could contribute to generate/reinforce cortical
  polarity and cellular protrusion.
