caption: Hypothesized descending pathway for translating emotional states or appetitive
  need for food, salt or water into goal-directed motor tasks. Representative afferents
  to the BSTvl that are implicated in detecting changes in nutrient status and energy
  balance are shown at top. Information from these sites is integrated by neurons
  within the BSTvl, which project densely to the dorsal substantia innominata (SI),
  among other sites (). Next, major efferent projections from neurons in the SI target
  the reticular formation and pedunculopontine nucleus in the midbrain (). Neurons
  in these sites stimulate motor behavior and autonomic activation via indirect projections
  through the medullary reticular formation and direct projections to the spinal cord
  (see references in Discussion). These serial projections (BSTvl → SI → midbrain
  reticular formation / PPT → medullary reticular formation → spinal cord) represent
  a likely output channel for the modulation of somatomotor and autonomic function,
  and likely play an important role in driving behaviors such as foraging for salt,
  water, and/or food in response to or in combination with emotional states.
