caption: 'The yin and yang effects of P2Y2R and P2X7R activities. A thin balance between
  P2Y2R and P2X7R activities is required to maintain a healthy communication between
  neural cells. Increased P2Y2R activation (Health—left) induces neuroprotective effects,
  like neurogenesis, clearance of debris from apoptotic cells and amyloid precursor
  protein (APP) non-amyloidogenic processing in Alzheimer’s Disease. P2X7R expression
  and activity is augmented in the diseased brain (Disease—right), inducing neurodegeneration,
  microglia activation, demyelination, and mitochondrial dysfunction. At the cellular
  level, ATP is intensely released during neurodegeneration. Released ATP by activating
  P2X7R increases intracellular Ca2+ levels and can induce detrimental effects such
  as mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. In glial cells, P2X7R activation
  induces the release of more ATP and interleukins, such as IL-1β. ATP and UTP can
  bind to P2Y2R inducing neuroprotective effects, including: debris clearance by glial
  phagocytosis; increase in the sensibility of TrkA receptors and stimulation of the
  neural growth factor pathway; amyloid-β (Aβ) uptake and degradation as well as non-amyloidogenic
  APP processing (in Alzheimer’s Disease). Increased ATP release can also be triggered
  by Aβ exposure. Created with BioRender.com.'
