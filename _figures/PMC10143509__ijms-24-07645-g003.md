caption: The involvement of p53 in activation of interferon genes, of interferon-stimulated
  genes, and in feedback loops regulating these processes. Red arrows mark the genes
  positively regulated by p53. ISRE—interferon-stimulated response element, a DNA
  sequence that confers responsiveness to type I interferons. GAS—interferon-gamma-activated
  site, a DNA sequence element through which interferon gamma can activate transcription.
  For clarity, the signaling from toll-like receptors is oversimplified, e.g., some
  of them are localized in the cell membrane, whereas others are localized in the
  endosome membrane. The exact localization of GLIPR2 in this signaling pathway is
  not known. STING protein can also recognize foreign DNA in the cell nucleus. The
  entry method of viruses into cells is also only schematically represented. Adapted
