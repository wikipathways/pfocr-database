caption: 'Three commonly differentially expression MicroRNAs in pancreatic cancer
  tissue and patient blood: MicroRNAs 21, 155, and 200. miRNA 21, 155, and 200 are
  commonly differential expressions in pancreatic cancer tissue and patient blood.
  They play important roles in tumorgenesis and drug resistance by repressing their
  targeted genes. miR-21–regulated genes are involved in apoptosis, tumor invasion,
  metastasis, and cell cycle progression. Up-regulation of miR-21 is commonly found
  in cancers and the blood. Here, a schematic diagram of predicted miR-21 target genes
  important in cancer biology is presented.  miR-21 targets PTEN (regulating expression
  of PI3K, FAK, Akt, matrix metalloproteinases, p53, and caspase 8), BCL2 (via PI3K
  targeting), PDCD4, tropomyosin, matrix metalloproteinases, RECK, and TIMPs, which
  promotes tumors resistant to apoptosis, metastatic growth, and increase their migratory
  capability. miR-21 also correlated with activation of BCL2, which reduced pancreatic
  cancer cell apoptosis and chemosensitivity to gemcitabine.miR-155 is found often
  up-regulated in cancer tissues and/or patient''s serum. Potential targets of miR-155
  include TP53IP1 (via caspase-3), PU.1, SOCS1, MYD88 (via JAK/STAT), which are involved
  in apoptosis, cell cycle progression, immune cell differentiation, and proinflammatory
  cytokine production all of which are important for tumor development. miR-155 overexpression
  is also associated with increased mutation in BRAF, RAS, and RET/PTC, genes that
  are commonly dysregulated in solid tumors. miR-200 family members include miR200
  b/c, miR-429 (subgroup2), and miR-141. miR-200a (subgroup 1) forms a negative feedback
  loop with ZEB1/2, involved in the TGF[beta] signaling pathway. ZEB1 is a critical
  EMT activator in human cancers . ZEB2 interact with p300, pCAF to induce EMT. miR-200
  family regulate EMT by regulating ZEB1/2. ZEB 1/2 also plays an important role in
  control stem cell–like properties, senescence, apoptosis, and proliferation (by
  repressing cyclin D1). miR-200 family members also target FAP1, one of the apoptosis
  inhibitors.219'
