caption: Activation of the PKA pathway in the presence of glucose by different essential
  nutrients through multiple transceptors. Glucose-fermenting cells of Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae that are starved for another essential nutrient, like nitrogen or phosphate,
  enter stationary phase and develop a low-PKA phenotype, that is, accumulation of
  trehalose and glycogen, acquirement of high stress tolerance, and downregulation
  of stress-responsive genes. Re-addition of nitrogen or phosphate triggers rapid
  activation of PKA targets, which is not mediated by cAMP as a second messenger.
  The nutrient sensors or ‘transceptors’ involved are specific transporters that were
  induced in the starvation period and that act as nutrient receptors for activation
  of the PKA pathway. Gap1 senses amino acids, Mep2 senses ammonium, and Pho84 senses
  phosphate in appropriately starved cells. The presence of glucose is essential for
  nutrient transceptor activation. It can be detected either by the GPCR (Gpr1-Gpa2)
  system for extracellular glucose sensing or by the Ras system, which is activated
  by intracellular glucose catabolism. Metabolic reactions are depicted by dotted
  arrows; regulatory and signaling interactions by full arrows.
