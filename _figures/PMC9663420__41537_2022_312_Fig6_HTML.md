  to activation of P2RX4 or P2RX7, the NLRP3 inflammasome activated pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. P2XRs may also act via the NF-kB pathway, an established inflammatory
  pathway in SCZ. These inflammatory molecules contribute to neuroinflammation, as
  indicated by upregulated expression of inflammatory marker SERPINA3 in SCZ. Solid

  relationship between targets. B Radar chart demonstrating differential P2RX4, P2RX7,
