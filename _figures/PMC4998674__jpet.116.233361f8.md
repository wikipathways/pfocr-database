caption: The hypothetical pathway of the excitotoxic effects of EW. In this study,
  EW as well as glutamate treatment to ethanol-free cells increased p38α, PS1, NICD,
  and HES1 expression. MK-801 (a glutamate antagonist) treatment inhibited EW-induced
  increase in p38α and PS1, suggesting that glutamate mediates the p38α and PS1 expression.
  SB203580 (a p38α inhibitor) treatment inhibited EW/glutamate-induced PS1 expression,
  suggesting that p38α mediates the PS1 expression. EW provoked an increase in NICD
  and HES1 expression. This effect of EW was reproduced by glutamate treatment to
  ethanol-free cells, a phenomenon that was attenuated by SB203580 or DAPT (γ-secretase
  inhibitor). DAPT treatment ameliorated EW/glutamate-induced reduced cell viability,
  suggesting that the γ-secretase function of PS1 mediates the cell death. These data
  suggest that the sequential or concerted activities of p38α, PS1, NICD, and HES1
  may mediate excitotoxic stress involving glutamate in response to EW.
