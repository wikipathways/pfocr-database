caption: Schematic representation of the structure-function relationships of IRAK-M
  based on this study. (A) Functional involvement of the different residues of the
  Death Domain (DD) of IRAK-M on induction of NF-κB, transcription and translation
  upon overexpression in 293T cells (data derived from Figures  and ). Graded color
  code (red->pink->white) indicates the impact of the single mutants on NF-κB in 293T
  cells (from red important to white no effect). The stretch D19-A23 is not indicated
  to be essential to NF-κB because mutation of the complete stretch (combined D19-P21
  and P22-A23 mutation) results in a mutant with normal NF-κB. (B) Schematic representation
  of the working mechanism of IRAK-M as inhibitor of MyD88 signaling adapted from
  Zhou et al. [], in which IRAK-4/IRAK-M interaction induces transcription of other
  inhibitors via MEKK3 dependent NF-κB and in which IRAK-2 mediated mRNA stability
  and translation is inhibited by IRAK-M. Based on our mutagenesis studies both W74
  as well as R97 in the IRAK-M-DD are pivotal for IRAK-4/IRAK-M mediated NF-κB activity,
  but R97 is predicted to bind on the other side of IRAK-4 (see Figure ). This may
  induce oligomerization of IRAK-4 and IRAK-1 or IRAK-2 activation, or, since both
  residues are essential for the unique, previously shown MEKK3 dependent IRAK-M mediated
  NF-κB activation, IRAK-4 may be sandwiched by IRAK-M to come to this pathway as
  indicated by W74 and R97 interactions. R97 is not predicted to be involved in the
  interaction of IRAK-M with IRAK-2 for which F18, D19, P22, R70 and W74 are predicted
  to be involved.
