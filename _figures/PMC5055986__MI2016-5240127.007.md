caption: Schematic representation of a probable signaling pathway of folic acid mediated
  modulation of inflammatory response in microglia cells. (a) LPS activated BV-2 cells
  increases the expression of proinflammatory cytokines by MAPK phosphorylation and
  NF-κB activation. The phosphorylation of IKK induces proteasomal degradation of
  IκB-α, enabling the active form of NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus and induce
  IL-1β, TNF-α, and iNOS expression. Alternatively, NF-κB is also activated by MAPK
  phosphorylation triggered by LPS treatment. (b) The folic acid pretreatment of LPS
  stimulated cells induces p38 MAPK phosphorylation leading to the upregulation of
  IL-10 production, selectively reduced in presence of p38 pharmacological inhibitor
  SB203580. IL-10 overproduction increases SOCS expression. Finally, SOCS proteins
  bind NF-κB and suppress its activation.
