caption: Simplified schematic representation of NO, salicylic acid (SA), and jasmonic
  acid (JA) interactions during plant responses to biotic challenges. (1) S-nitrosylation
  of NON-EXPRESSER OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENE1 (NPR1) at cys156 promotes its oligomerization
  and permanence in the cytosol. (2) NO stimulates SA biosynthesis. (3) Oligomeric
  NPR1 is denitrosylated following its interaction with SA receptors, which promotes
  the formation of monomeric NPR1. (4) Monomeric NPR1 translocates to the nucleus,
  where this protein binds TGA-class transcription factors, which subsequently activate
  promoters of SA-responsive genes. (5) NO also stimulates JA biosynthesis. (6) Cytosolic,
  oligomeric NPR1 represses JA-triggered responses. (7) At late stages of bacterial
  infection, S-nitrosylation of SA-binding protein 3 (SABP3) at cys280 represses its
  SA binding capacity, thereby promoting a negative feedback loop during the defense
  signaling pathway. Protein S-nitrosylation is represented by “–S–NO.”
