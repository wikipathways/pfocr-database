caption: The target genes are surrounded in red. LPS activation of TLR4-mediated MyD88
  (myeloid differentiation primary response 88)-dependent signaling pathway triggers
  the recruitment of its intracellular scaffold, which is comprised of three components
  MyD88, TIRAP (toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein) and
  TOLLIP. IRAK4 (interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 4) is then recruited to
  the complex, where it phosphorylates IRAK1, leading to its autophosphorylation and
  the subsequent ubiquitination of TRAF6 (TNF receptor associated factor 6). Ubiquitination
  of TRAF6 triggers its oligomerization and the recruitment and activation of the
  kinase TAK1 (TGF-beta activated kinase 1), in a complex with TAB1/2. These kinase
  complexes leads to the activation of the IKK (I-kappaB kinase) complex. The IKK
  complex phosphorylates IκB, resulting in IκB degradation, and permitting the release
  and the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus. PI3K, through association with
  MyD88 or TRAF6, is also involved in NF-κB activation through an Akt-dependent mechanism
  leading to the phosphorylation and activation of the IKK complex. Together these
  events induce the expression of various pro-inflammatory genes such as TNFα or IL-1β
  through binding to κB sites. The MyD88 complex can also bind to FADD leading to
  the recruitment and the activation of caspase 8, which is known to induce apoptotic
  signals.
