caption: Interaction of AEA with CB and TRPV1 receptors and its metabolism by FAAH
  and COX-2. Normally, AEA is an order of magnitude more potent as an agonist at CB
  receptors than at TRPV1 receptors. However inflammatory conditions sensitize TRPV1
  receptors to AEA ( and references therein). AEA is primarily metabolized by FAAH
  to produce AA, but can also act as a substrate for COX-2 to produce PG-EAs. It is
  not known whether these metabolites, which are biologically active, are involved
  in inflammatory pain, but the COX-2 pathway represents an alternative metabolic
  route for AEA when FAAH is inhibited (review, see ). Other metabolic pathways, such
  as lipoxygenase and P450 oxidative metabolism, are not shown in the figure for reasons
  of simplicity. AA, arachidonic acid; AEA, anandamide; CB, cannabinoid; COX, cyclooxygenase;
  FAAH, fatty acid amide hydrolase; PG, prostaglandin; PG-EA, prostaglandin ethanolamide;
  TRPV1, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1.

  fatty acid amide hydrolase and either cyclooxygenase or TRPV1.
