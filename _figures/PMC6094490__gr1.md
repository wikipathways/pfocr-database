caption: Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR6,
  are expressed on the plasma membrane to sense the components of bacteria and fungus
  present in extracellular environments, whereas TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are present
  on endosomal membranes in intracellular compartments to sense nucleic acids from
  microorganisms. TLR engagement activation recruites some adaptoer molecules, such
  as the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), and then activates mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) to produce pro-inflammatory
  mediators and in another way, TLR4 translocated to the endosome and TLR3 activate
  TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) via TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β
  (TRIF)-dependent pathway and then TBK1 phosphorylates interferon (IFN)-regulatory
  factor (IRF)3, which translocate into the nucleus to produce type I IFNs. TLR5 recognizes
  flagellin and activates NF-κB through MyD88. TLR 7 and TLR9 activations lead to
  the phosphorylation of IRF7 via MyD88-dependent pathway and phosphorylated IRF7
  also translocates into the nucleus to up-regulate the expression of type I IFNs.
  TLR7 and TLR9 can also activate NF-κB to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
