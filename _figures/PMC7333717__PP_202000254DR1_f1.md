caption: Schematic representation of Met metabolism in plants. The pathways mentioned
  in this study are highlighted. Solid arrows represent one metabolic step, whereas
  dashed arrows represent several metabolic steps. The enzyme names are underlined.
  The canonical Asp family pathway is shown with gray background. The SMM cycle is
  shown with striped background. HomoCys, Homocysteine; 2KB, 2-ketobutyric acid; 5MeTHF,
  5-methyltetrahydrofolate; MS, Met synthase; O-PhosphohomoSer, O-phosphohomoserine;
  SAM, S-adenosyl-Met.
