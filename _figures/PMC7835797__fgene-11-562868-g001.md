caption: 'Mechanisms of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance mediated by epigenetic
  alterations in renal cell carcinoma (RCC): vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
  and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) bind to a tyrosine kinase receptor and
  activate the downstream focal adhesion kinase (FAK), PI3K, and RAS pathways. Activated
  FAK, PI3K, and RAS phosphorylate their downstream signaling cascade, eventually
  leading to the translation and accumulation of hydroxylated hypoxia inducible factor
  1 (HIF-1α) and HIF-2α. In RCC, TKIs exert their influence on antiangiogenesis through
  inhibition of tyrosine kinase receptor. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
  activation of downstream signaling pathways and bypass pathways mediated by epigenetic
  alterations are responsible for the TKIs resistance. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-SARCC
  increases miR-143-3p expression, thus inhibiting its downstream signals, including
  AKT, RAS, and ERK. miR-130 enhances HIF signaling by inhibition of PTEN. Hypermethylated
  QPCT reduces its protein level, leading to inhibition of RAS. EMT, a key transformation
  in TKIs resistance, is promoted by SOX5, zinc finger E-box binding 2 (ZEB2), and
  β-Catenin while inhibited by E-cadherin. lncRNA-GAS5 promotes EMT by competing with
  miR-21 which suppresses the expression of SOX5. miR-141 suppresses the expression
  of ZEB2 to inhibit its promotion of EMT. SET and MYND domain-containing protein
  2 (SMYD2) leads to EMT by promoting the expression of miR-125b, which inhibits DDK3
  and activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The chromatin modifier enhancer of
  zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) can not only inhibit E-cadherin but also activate FAK signaling
  pathway to exert its influence on TKIs resistance. Except for VEGF receptor (VEGFR)
  and PDGF receptor (PDGFR), activation of MET, AXL, and IL-6 pathways can also lead
  to phosphorylation of downstream transduction cascades, such as PI3K, STAT3, and
  RAS. lncRNA Activated in RCC with Sunitinib Resistance (lncARSR) inhibits miR-34
  and miR-449, and thus activates MET/AXL pathway. miR-32-5p inhibits MET pathway
  while lncRNA-SRLR activates interleukin-6 (IL-6)R pathway. RCC, renal cell carcinoma;
