caption: 'A. Left to right: Schematic of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides indicating
  the donors of carbon and nitrogen atoms that form nucleotides. The small molecules
  are color coded according to the contributing metabolic pathways from which they
  are commonly derived, shown schematically to the right.B. Transcriptional and post-translational
  mechanisms contributing to de novo nucleotide synthesis downstream of the AKT-mTORC1
  pathway. Left to right: AKT-mediated phosphorylation of the non-oxidative PPP enzyme
  TKT and SREBP-mediated regulation of the oxidative PPP enhance the production of
  ribose-5-phosphate, which can then be used for nucleotide synthesis by conversion
  to phospho-ribosyl pyrophosphate through the enzyme PRPS, the levels of which are
  elevated upon MYC activation. MYC promotes glutamine uptake and stimulates expression
  of several genes encoding enzymes of both purine and pyrimidine synthesis pathways.
  In addition to being downstream of mTORC1, SREBP and MYC can also be stabilized
  via AKT-mediated inhibition of GSK3. ATF4 activation downstream of mTORC1 contributes
  to enhanced purine synthesis through the induction of serine biosynthesis enzymes
  and the mitochondrial tetrahydrofolate cycle enzyme MTHFD2, thus supplying both
  glycine and one-carbon formyl units. mTORC1 acutely stimulates pyrimidine synthesis
  through the S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of the pyrimidine synthesis enzyme CAD.
  The newly synthesized purine and pyrimidines are used for the synthesis of RNA,
  predominantly rRNA for ribosome biogenesis, and DNA in proliferating cells.NADPH,
