caption: Illustration of the two-site binding model for binding of four copies of
  Pep2 to the TreS tetramer. Binding of the first copy of Pep2 at an unoccupied apical
  binding site (Site 1) is governed by Kd,1 and does not influence affinity for binding
  of the first copy at the opposite apex (Site 1′). Hence, Sites 1 and 1′ have identical
  dissociation constants. Binding of the second copy of Pep2 may encounter steric
  constraints imposed by the previously bound copy, and therefore, the affinity for
  binding the second copy, Kd,2, at Site 2 (or Site 2′) is different.
