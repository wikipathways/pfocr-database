caption: FUT8 overexpression promotes DNA replication. Differentially expressed proteins
  (1.5-fold upregulated proteins) between LNCaP-FUT8/LNCaP-Ctr that were identified
  in our global proteomics analysis were subjected to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Several proteins including the subunits of
  DNA polymerase alpha primase complex, DNA polymerase delta and epsilon along with
  minichromosome maintenance (MCM) and proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were
  identified in LNCaP-FUT8 cells compared to the wildtype control (A). The same 1.5-fold
  upregulated proteomics data were analyzed for cell cycle analysis showing overexpression
  of many S phase and G2/M cell phase cycle proteins (B). Bubble blot showing the
  expression of PCNA and CDK2 expression correlation between the two LNCaP-FUT8 and
  LNCaP Ctr cell lines (C). Western Blot analysis showing PCNA and CDK2 expression
  between the LNCaP Ctr and LNCaP-FUT8 cell lysate. Actin was included that accounted
  for the amount of loading across lanes (D).
