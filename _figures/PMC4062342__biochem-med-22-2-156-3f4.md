caption: Mannose metabolic pathway. Mannose-6-phosphate (Man-6-P) is mainly generated
  from fructose-6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) by the action of mannosephosphate isomerase
  (MPI), or alternatively from mannose by the action of hexokinase (HK). Thus, decreased
  Man-6-P production due to the MPI deficiency can be restored by the mannose supplementation
  therapy. Phosphomannomutase (PMM2) converts Man-6-P to Man-1 -P, but since MPI can
  also catabolizes Man-6-P, supplementary mannose treatment does not improve PMM2-CDG
  symptoms. Inhibition of MPI activity might provide more Man-6-P and thus overcome
  low residual activity of PMM2.
