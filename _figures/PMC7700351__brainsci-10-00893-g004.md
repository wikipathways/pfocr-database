caption: 'Regulation of HIF-α via two pathways under normal oxygen levels (atmospheric
  oxygen level~21%). Left panel: Pathway (I)—PHD enzymes hydroxylate the prolyl (Pro)
  residue of HIF-α in ODDD domain, in the presence of oxygen, 2OG and Fe(II). Hydroxylated
  HIF-α is recognized by pVHL protein which labels the HIF-α to proteasomal degradation
  by ubiquitin protein. Degraded HIF-α is no longer able to activate the HIF system
  and thus the HIF system is downregulated under normal oxygen level. Right panel:
  Pathway (II)—FIH enzymes hydroxylate asparagine (Asn) residue of HIF-α in the CAD
  domain, in the presence of oxygen, 2OG and Fe(II). Hydroxylated HIF-α is blocked
  to interact with the essential transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300, thus silencing
  the HIF transcriptional ability and downregulate the HIF system. HIF = hypoxia-inducible
  factor; HIF-α = hypoxia-inducible factor α-subunit; HIF-β = hypoxia-inducible factor
  β-subunit; PAS = Per ARNT SIM domain; ODDD = oxygen-dependent degradation domain;
  CAD = C-terminal transactivation domain; PHD = prolyl hydroxylase; FIH = factor
  inhibiting HIF; 2OG = 2-oxoglutarate; Fe(II) = iron ferrous; Pro = prolyl; Asn =
  asparagine; pVHL = von Hippel Lindau protein; CBP/p300 Creb-binding protein/protein
