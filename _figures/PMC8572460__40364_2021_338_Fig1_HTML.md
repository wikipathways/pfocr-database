caption: 'Core mechanism of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of
  regulated cell death. Fe2+ can participate in the Fenton reaction and induce lipid
  peroxidation. LTF and TF-mediated iron uptake and NCOA4-mediated ferritin degradation
  can promote ferroptosis, while the iron exporter SLC40A1 is a repressor of ferroptosis.
  GSH-dependent system (SLC7A11-GSH-GPX4 pathway) and GSH-independent system (CoQ,
  BH4, and ESCT-III pathway) inhibit ferroptotic cell death through suppressing lipid
  peroxidation or membrane damage. ACSL4, LPCAT3, and ALOX promote lipid peroxidation
  on the membrane. In addition, POR and NOXs also contribute to lipid peroxidation
  in a context-dependent manner. The complex regulation of SLC7A11 or GPX4 by multiple
  mechanism affects ferroptosis sensitivity (see text). Abbreviations: ACO1, aconitase
