caption: RiNCED and RiPYL genes differentially expressed in database “R. idaeus Heritage
  transcripts v1.0. NCED and PYL are included in the ABA biosynthesis and signaling
  pathways, respectively. Gene expression was calculated as FPKM derived from flower
  (F), green fruit (G), and pink fruit (P) RNA-Seq data [13,29]. ABA biosynthesis
  pathway modified from Han et al., (2004) [30]; ABA signaling pathway modified from
  Yoon et al., (2020) [31]
