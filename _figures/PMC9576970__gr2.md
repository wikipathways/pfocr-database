caption: Top network (Lipid Metabolism, Molecular Transport, Small Molecule Biochemistry)
  in the inactive Crohn's disease vs healthy control meta-analysis identified by IPA
  Network analysis. Legend illustrates class of the gene. Red indicates upregulation
  and green downregulation, with shade depicting magnitude of change. Solid and dashed
  lines depict direct and indirect, respectively, relationship between genes. Figure
  was generated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. (For interpretation of the references
