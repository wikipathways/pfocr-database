caption: The same pheromone MAP kinase pathway operates in C. albicans white and opaque
  cells, and activates downstream responses via the same transcription factor, Cph1.
  White- and opaque-specific factors (WSF and OSF, respectively) work in concert with
  Cph1 to drive phase-specific phenotypes. The interactions with Cph1 could either
  be direct or indirect. In response to pheromone, C. albicans opaque cells undergo
  efficient polarized growth and cell conjugation. In contrast, white cells cannot
  mate but can form pheromone-stimulated biofilms under certain environmental conditions.
