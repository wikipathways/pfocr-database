caption: Signal transduction through activin receptors. Activin, myostatin and GDF11
  signal through type II and type I serine/threonine kinase receptors. Type IIR is
  the principal ligand binding receptors, and ligand/typeIIR complexes recruit and
  associate with type IR. Type IR is phosphorylated and activated by type IIR kinase.
  Smad2 and 3, activin/TGF-β specific Smads, are phosphorylated by activated type
  IR. In the nucleus, Smad2/3/4 complexes regulate gene expression with additional
  transcriptional cofactors. Smad-independent pathway such as MAPK is also activated
  downstream of activin receptors. Inhibin acts antagonistic to activin by forming
  high affinity complexes with ActRII and betaglycan. Follistatin, myostatin propeptide
  and receptor ectodomain inhibit the activities of activin and related factors in
  the extracellular space to prevent ligand/receptor interaction. Chemical type IR
  kinase inhibitors act in the cell to disrupt receptor/intracellular signaling.
