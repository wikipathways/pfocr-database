caption: A number of proteins identified and included as ‘signatures’ for low glucose
  (LG) conditions or androgen sensitivity (AI v AS) have known roles in regulation
  of the glycolysis pathway A. and TCA cycle B. As indicated in figure 9, a number
  of key enzymes within both pathways are either up or down-regulated in response
  to low glucose treatment (LG treatment) or between androgen independent (AI) and
  androgen sensitive (AS) PCa cell lines.
