caption: 'Elevated RV glucose uptake identifies a PH endophenotype with unique alterations
  in cellular metabolism. Integrative network analysis incorporates non-targeted metabolomics
  and known physical metabolite-enzyme network data (using databases: Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Recon3D, and Human Metabolic Reaction 2 (HMR2), see
  Methods). Glutamate and arginine play a key role in high RV glucose uptake PH phenotype.
  TCA is important for energy and is also an important source of substrates to synthesize
  amino acids, proteins, and DNA. It is closely related to the urea cycle and glutamine
  metabolism. Conversion of glutamine to glutamate is a source of amino acid substrate
  to enter TCA in proliferative/glycolytic cells. Ornithine produced by ARG2 is another
  key pathway to provide a steady source of glutamate to enter TCA via α-ketoglutarate
  (αKG). These changes in metabolism with decreased arginine bioavailability reflect
  the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of highly proliferative cell growth. Targeting
  these metabolic pathways offer appealing therapeutic options in PH that need to
  be further evaluated. Red denotes elevated metabolites, green decreased metabolites
  with p < 0.05. Shaded ellipses mark enzymes in the pathway. GLS: glutaminase; eNOS:
  endothelial nitric oxide synthetase; ARG2: arginase 2. ALDH18A1.'
