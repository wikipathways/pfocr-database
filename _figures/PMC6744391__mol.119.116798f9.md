caption: TAAR1 signaling pathway/apoptotic pathway components. Activation of TAAR1
  elicits cAMP accumulation and results in activation of ERK1/2. TAAR1 downstream
  signaling components increase antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, but do not change the
  proapoptotic protein, Bax. This leads to a decreased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, which could
  be protective, preventing apoptosis. The TAAR1 antagonist EPPTB blocks both ERK1/2
  phosphorylation and changes in Bcl-2 levels. The TAAR1 agonist increased AKT phosphorylation
  at Thr308, but not at Ser473, which is not involved in TAAR1-induced apoptotic signaling.
