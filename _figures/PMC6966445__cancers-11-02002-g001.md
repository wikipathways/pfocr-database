caption: 'Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT)
  signaling pathways (simplified). Cytokine signaling occurs through various JAK-STATs.
  (a) Canonical type II IFN signaling occurs through receptors, IFNGR1 and IFNGR2,
  which constitutively associate with JAK1 and JAK2, respectively, leading to the
  phosphorylation of STAT1. Phosphorylated STAT1 homodimers translocate to the nucleus
  and bind to GAS elements, initiating the transcription of IFN-γ induced genes associated
  with immune activation. IFN-γ signaling can also lead to the phosphorylation of
  STAT3, which forms homo- or heterodimers that bind to GAS elements to induce inflammatory
  genes. (b) The type I IFN pathway can be stimulated by multiple family members,
  the most well-known being IFN-α and IFN-β. The receptors IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are associated
  with TYK2 and JAK1, respectively. Canonical type I IFN signaling occurs through
  the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, which, together with IRF9, form the ISGF3
  complex. ISGF3 translocates to the nucleus to initiate the transcription of IRGs
  through the ISRE regulatory sequence. Non-canonical type I IFN signaling can occur
  through the CRKL or NFκB pathway. Subsequent to JAK activation, CRKL can become
  phosphorylated by TYK2, which leads to CRKL complexation with STAT5, which then
  binds GAS elements in the nucleus. (c) IFNAR1/2 signaling through TYK2 and JAK1
  can trigger the activation of the NFκB pathway through phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) that
  act through IKKa and IKKb to drive NFκB induction of genes associated with survival
  and cell proliferation. The production of type I IFNs can also occur through activation
  of PRRs that converge on IRF7 to promote further production of type I IFNs and viral
  response genes. (d) Cytokines, both pro- and anti-inflammatory, signal through their
  associated receptor/JAK complexes, resulting in the downstream phosphorylation of
  STATs (homo- or heterodimers). Translocation of these STAT complexes to the nucleus
  drives the transcription of genes involved in processes ranging from inflammation
  to angiogenesis and survival. Abbreviations: JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription; IFN, interferon; IFNGR, interferon gamma receptor;
