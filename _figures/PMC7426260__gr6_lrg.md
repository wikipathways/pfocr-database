caption: 'Schematic representation of the endogenous crosstalk between L-arginine/NO
  and L-cysteine/H2S leading to an increased expression of cGMP and 5′GMP, with direct
  consequence in hyperpolarization and relaxation. 5′GMP: (5′ guanilyl monophosphate);
  cGMP: (cyclic guanilyl monophosphate); GTP: guanilyl triphosphate; NOS: nitric oxide
  synthase; CSE: cystathionine gamma lyase.'
