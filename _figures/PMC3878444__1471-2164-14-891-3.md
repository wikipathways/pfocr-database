caption: Functional network over-represented in the subset of the differentially regulated
  genes (List eQG) involving interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-13 and suppressor of cytokine
  signalling 3 (SOCS3) and associated molecules with a network score of 20, as identified
  by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). List eQG consist of genes that resulted from
  combining of the differentially regulated genes on the microarray (n = 418) with
  marker positions from a study of quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting susceptibility
  to mastitis in Norwegian Red cattle []. Red denotes molecules that were up-regulated
  in response to 6 hours infection with live Staphylococcus aureus in bovine macrophages.
