caption: Calcium signaling-mediated plant response to cold stress in Arabidopsis.
  The perception of cold stimulus is the first step in the activation of cold tolerance
  in plants. Plants sense cold signals through the recognition of the changes in cellular
  membrane by cold stress, or cold signals sensor, COLD1. The perception of cold stimulus
  activates cold responsive Ca2+ channels (MCA1 and MCA2) or other unknown Ca2+ channels
  and/or pumps to induce Ca2+ transients, also knowns as Ca2+ signals or signatures.
  The cold stress-induced Ca2+ transient changes in plant cell and the expression
  of AtSRC2 subsequently facilitate the production of ROS, through the activation
  of Ca2+-mediated NADPH oxidase activity of AtRBOHF. Enhanced ROS further activates
  Ca2+ channels and/or pumps for inducing Ca2+ transients to form a positive feedback.
  CPKs also relay cold-triggered Ca2+ signals into phosphorylation and activation
  of the MAPK cascade. In addition, the MAPK cascade is activated by CRLK1 or CRLK2
  through the interaction with calmodulin (CaM) in response to cold stress. The MAPK
  signaling pathway triggered by cold stress suppresses the degradation of ICE1 to
  establish cold tolerance in plants. CaM also relays cold stress-triggered changes
  into transcriptional reprogramming via AtSR1/CAMTA3. Solid arrows represent physical
  interaction and/or positive regulation (induction). Dashed arrows represent mechanism
  that is unclear.
