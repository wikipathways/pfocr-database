caption: 'Depicted is the biosynthetic pathway for ALLO, 5α-THDOC, and androstanediol,
  which are potent positive modulators of GABAA receptors and are formed from the
  two step reduction of the parent steroids, progesterone, deoxycorticosterone, and
  testosterone, respectively. The rate-limiting enzyme in GABAergic steroid biosynthesis
  is 5a-reductase. Also depicted are the sulfated derivatives of pregnenolone and
  DHEA, which are negative modulators of GABAA receptors, and corticosterone, which
  has been shown to have excitatory effects. The broken lines indicate that 17-OH
  pregnenolone and 17-OH progesterone are omitted from the figure in the formation
  of DHEA and androstenedione, respectively.Abbreviations: DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone;
  DHDOC, dihydrodeoxycorticosterone; THDOC, tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone; DHP, dihydroprogesterone;
  DHT, dihydrotestosterone; 3α-HSD, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. (Adapted from
