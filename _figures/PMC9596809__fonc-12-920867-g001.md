caption: Proposed mechanisms of radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis (RIMF). Ionizing
  radiation damages epithelial and endothelial (shown here; red- and green-colored
  cells are damaged and healthy cells, respectively) cells which in turn induce a
  coordinated cellular response that also involves the secretion of pro-fibrotic cytokines,
  such as Transforming Growth Factor b (TGF-β). Moreover, the damaged endothelial
  cells secrete inflammatory chemokines to recruit neutrophils and macrophages to
  the injured sites, which in turn release pro-fibrotic cytokines like Platelet-Derived
  Growth Factor (PDGF), basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), TGF-β, etc., leading
  to a chronic inflammatory environment. Additionally, radiation causes perturbations
  of the cellular homeostasis by the excessive production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen
  species (ROS and RNS), which can also lead to the activation of TGF-β through the
  dissociation of the Latency Associated Peptide (LAP) from the active mature form
  of TGF-β. Another potential mechanism is that the damaged vasculature and the uncontrolled
  tissue remodeling can initiate the TGF-β signaling pathway through the ROS/RNS imbalance
  or the up-regulation of the expression of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α).
  The activated TGF-β signaling pathway leads to the differentiation and activation
  of the residual and migrated fibroblasts, characterized by the increased secretion
  of extracellular matrix (ECM) and collagen deposition.
