caption: The IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway in mast cells. IL-33 is primarily expressed
  by different types of structural cells. Damage to these cells by external stimuli
  results in cell injury followed by release of IL-33. IL-33 can be neutralized by
  binding to soluble ST2 (sST2) or recognized by membrane bound ST2 receptor, which
  subsequently leads to activation of MyD88 dependent signaling pathways and the release
  of mast cell mediators that play important roles in the progression of allergic
  diseases
