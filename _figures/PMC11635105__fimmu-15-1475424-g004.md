caption: STRING protein-protein interaction networks for the differentially methylated
  circadian pathways-related genes in HS. The STRING network enables the assessment
  and integration of protein-protein interactions, both directly (physical) and indirectly
  (functional). Colored lines between proteins designate different types of interactions.
  Different colored lines represent different types of evidence used to predict associations.
  Red lines indicate fusion evidence; green lines, neighborhood evidence; blue lines,
  cooccurrence evidence; purple lines, experimental evidence; yellow lines, text mining
  evidence; light blue lines, database evidence; black lines, co-expression evidence
