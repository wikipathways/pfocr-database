caption: Schematic model of the Nrf2‐Keap1 signalling pathway. Under normal condition,
  Keap1 binds to Nrf2 and brings Nrf2 into Keap1‐Cul3‐E3 ubiquitin ligase complex,
  leading to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Nrf2. When Nrf2 met oxidative
  stress or electrophiles, it can cause a conformational change in the Keap1‐Cul3‐E3
  ubiquitin ligase by acting on specific cysteine residues in Keap1. Also, the loss
  of cullin 3 could lead to Nrf2 activation. These changes disrupt Nrf2‐Keap1 binding
  at the DLG domain. Nrf2 is stabilized, and free Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus,
  where it dimerizes with members of the small Maf family and binds to AREs within
  regulatory regions of a wide variety of cell anti‐oxidative genes, including HO‐1,
  NQO‐1, SOD, CAT, GPX and GCL
