caption: 'Color indicates the consensus rank of enzymes on a logarithmic scale. Points
  above the color scale bar represent the consensus rank of individual enzymes. Line
  thickness indicates whether the enzyme-encoding genes were enriched or depleted
  in CBB-positive genomes. Dashed lines indicate that the enzyme was not detected
  or that it was removed because it was Prk or Rubisco (see ). Co-factors and small
  molecules such as CO2 have been omitted from most reactions. Arrows are used where
  enzymes that mainly catalyze specific directions rank differently. Special characters
  indicate pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructo-1-kinase (*) and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent
  phosphoglycerate mutase (†). The map is based on relevant subsystems of KEGG’s central
  carbon metabolism map (map01200) and related maps. The logarithm of consensus ranks
  for Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers were normalized to the range 0 to 1 and encoded
  as color. We also encoded significant EC enrichment or depletion in CBB-positive
  genomes as different colors. The EC-to-color tables were submitted to KEGG’s pathway
  mapping tool (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway2.html) to yield annotated
  maps that were then used as templates for drawing the figure. Note that the reaction
  SBP to S7P is represented by EC 3.1.3.11, rather than the eukaryotic SBPase EC 3.1.3.37,
  assuming that EC 3.1.3.11 represents bifunctional F/SBPase (Fbp). Also note that

  used, unless special patterns of interest were present, e.g. 3PG to 2PG (†). Abbreviations:

  description: 'Color indicates the consensus rank of enzymes on a logarithmic scale.
    Points above the color scale bar represent the consensus rank of individual enzymes.
