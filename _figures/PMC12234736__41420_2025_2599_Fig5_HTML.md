caption: SLP65 drives tripartite LLPS, forms droplets with CIN85 and SUVs, and activates
  BCR signalling pathways. Tripartite LLPS requires the interaction between the CIN85
  SH3 domain and SLP65 proline-rich motifs and the preference of the lipid-binding
  domain for high-membrane-curvature SUVs. LAT phosphorylation drives LLPS and forms
  macromolecule condensates with Grb2 and SOS to trigger TCR signalling pathways.
