caption: Possible fates of excitation energy once a photon of light is absorbed by
  a molecule of chlorophyll resulting in conversion from the ground state (Chl) to
  the singlet excited state (1Chl*). When light is not saturating for photosynthesis,
  the majority of chlorophyll molecules pass their excitation energy to neighboring
  chlorophyll molecules via resonance transfer (resulting in return of the first chlorophyll
  molecule to its ground state). This process can be repeated until the energy reaches
  a reaction center chlorophyll molecule that undergoes charge separation, resulting
  in an electron entering the photosynthetic electron transport chain (photochemical
  route denoted in green, returning the reaction center chlorophyll molecule to its
  ground state). As light levels become increasingly excessive, excess excitation
  energy is increasingly dissipated preemptively as thermal energy via a regulated
  pathway (non-photochemical route denoted in red that also returns the excited chlorophyll
  molecule to its ground state; see text for regulation of the xanthophyll cycle and
  engagement of zeaxanthin in energy dissipation). When the combined levels of photochemical
  and regulated non-photochemical routes are insufficient to swiftly de-excite all
  excited singlet chlorophyll, conversion to triplet excited chlorophyll (3Chl*) takes
  place, which represents a temporary build-up of excess excitation energy (purple
  route). In the presence of molecular oxygen, triplet excited chlorophyll returns
  to its ground state by transfer of excitation energy to oxygen, resulting in the
  formation of singlet excited oxygen (not shown). A small percentage of the chlorophyll
  molecules return to ground state directly from the singlet excited state (wavy line),
  emitting fluorescence (F). Although only representing a very small fraction of the
  excitation energy, and thus not a major route for deexcitation, fluorescence emission
  provides valuable quantitative information about the other fates (particularly the
  regulated non-photochemical and photochemical routes).

  description: Possible fates of excitation energy once a photon of light is absorbed
