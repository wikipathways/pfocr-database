caption: A proposed mechanism of Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway function in lymphatic
  valve (LV) formation. LVs develop in a step-wise manner. LV-ECs are specified in
  red and LECs are in green. Blue lines indicate VEGFR3. Briefly, during the initiation
  stage, OSS promotes high PROX1 and FOXC2 expression in LV-ECs. During the valve
  maturation stage, LV-ECs orient perpendicular to the flow and migrate into the vessel
  lumen. Then, LV-ECs elongate to form a bi-layered leaflet with a thick extracellular
  matrix (ECM). YAP/TAZ activities are gradually increased during the maturation stage,
  thereby indicating that Hippo YAP/TAZ signaling pathway is regulated by a multitude
  of signaling mechanisms for LV development.
