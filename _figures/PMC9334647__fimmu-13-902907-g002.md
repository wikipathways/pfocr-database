caption: 'Model of the molecular mechanism underlying the role of Cav–1 in bacterial
  and HIV invasion: (A) Salmonella typhimurium delivers SopE effector proteins into
  the host cell through a type III secretion system. SopE activates Rac1 leading to
  the activation of actin reorganization. Cav–1 interacts directly with these proteins
  to form a complex, enhancing Salmonella invasion into host cells. Listeria monocytogenes
  can trigger Cav–1 endocytosis for cell–to–cell transfer involving actin filaments.
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Trichomonas vaginalis empregues Cav–1–mediated
  endocytosis to invade host cells. Klebsiella pneumoniae affects both systemic and
  local production of proinflammatory cytokines via the actions of STAT5 and the GSK3β–β–catenin–Akt
  pathway. (B) Endocytosis of E. coli is regulated by the small GTPase Rab5 through
  interaction with Cav–1 and plays multiple roles in the VEGFA–induced signaling cascade
  to enhance permeability in human endothelial cells. HIV also induces endothelial
  cell dysfunctions through Cav–1.'
