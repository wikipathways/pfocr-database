caption: Flavonoid metabolic pathway in safflower and the genes significantly respond
  to MeJA treatment. The diagram was drawn conbined with the chemical composition
  and gene expression (including the tissue expression and the expression under MeJA
  treatment). Red arrow represents MeJA induces the content of this flavonoid. The
  genes inside the red circle were that significantly respond to MeJA treatment based
  on the gene expression analyses
