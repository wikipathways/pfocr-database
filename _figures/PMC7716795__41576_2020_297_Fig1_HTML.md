caption: Examples of specific proteins are shown (highlighted in colour), which when
  present as mutants give rise to monogenic inborn errors of immunity, with the main
  infectious disease phenotypes noted. a | Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) responsible
  for detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) with examples of PRR pathways illustrated for retinoic
  acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) and Toll-like receptor
  (TLR). b | Receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) signalling. RIPK1 and RIPK3
  regulate inflammation and cell death (necroptosis). c | Interferon pathways. Type
  I interferons (for example, interferon-α (IFNα) and IFNβ) and type II interferons
  (for example, IFNγ) regulate the immune response to viral and bacterial infections.
  d | Antigen presentation pathways. Major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules
  present antigens (derived from intracellular proteins such as viruses and some bacteria)
  to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells via the endogenous pathway (left). MHC class II molecules
  present antigens from bacteria, parasites and other extracellular pathogens endocytosed
  into antigen-presenting cells to CD4+ T cells via the exogenous pathway (right).
