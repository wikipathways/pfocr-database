caption: Model for regulation of FLO11 gene expression by the Snf1-Nrg pathway. (A)
  In haploid cells, the Snf1 kinase is activated in response to glucose limitation
  and relieves Nrg-mediated repression of FLO11. Expression of FLO11 is critical for
  invasive growth and biofilm formation. It is also possible that Snf1 affects FLO11
  by other Nrg-independent mechanisms. (B) In diploid cells, the Snf1 kinase is activated
  under conditions of nitrogen limitation that lead to pseudohyphal differentiation.
  The simple model is that Snf1 responds to a low nitrogen signal, but there is no
  evidence to exclude other possibilities (see text).
