caption: HDACi and DNMTi target the MM cell. (A) HDACi and DNMTi activate the intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway by disrupting the balance of anti- and pro-apoptotic molecules
  concomitant with the release of cytochrome-c and AIF from mitochondria. HDACi also
  activate the extrinsic pathway by inducing death-receptor expression. In addition,
  acetylation (green circle) of Ku70 by HDACi results in degradation of FLIP thereby
  relieving the inhibition of caspase-8 by FLIP. (B) HDAC and DNMTi induce cell cycle
  arrest by inducing CDK inhibitors and repressing CDK and cyclin proteins. (C) HDACi
  leads to hyperacetylated alpha-tubulin. Thereby, the formation of aggresomes is
  inhibited what leads to attenuation of the UPR. HDACi also induce acetylation of
  HSP90 resulting in IKK degradation and inhibition of NF-κB. DNMTi also inhibit NF-κB
  activity. Both pathways form the rationale for combination therapy with bortezomib.
  (D) DNMTi induce the expression of Wnt-antagonist resulting in abrogation of Wnt-mediated
  proliferation and migration in advanced stages of MM. (E) HDACi and DNMTi can act
  as DNA damaging agents by activating ATR/ATM and inducing phosphorylation (purple
  circle) of Ckh-1, -2, p53 and H2AX. This results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
  In addition, HDACi can inhibit DNA repair mechanisms.
