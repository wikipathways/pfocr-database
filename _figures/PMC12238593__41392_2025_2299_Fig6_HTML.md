caption: Key immune signaling pathways regulating tumor-associated immunosuppression.
  In macrophages, CSF-1 or IL-34 binds to the CSF-1 receptor, inducing rapid dimerization
  and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues. This activation triggers downstream
  signaling through the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways, regulating macrophage polarization.
  CTLA-4, which is expressed on activated T cells, binds to CD80/CD86 on APCs. Upon
  engagement, CTLA-4 signaling dephosphorylates TCR signaling components, inhibiting
  CD3 and ZAP70 activation and suppressing the RAS signaling pathway. CTLA-4 signaling
  disrupts AKT phosphorylation, negatively regulating the cell cycle and suppressing
  key transcription factors such as NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-AT. PD-1 interacts with its
  ligands, leading to the phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues on its cytoplasmic
  tail. This phosphorylation recruits SHP-1 and SHP-2 to the ITSM motif, inhibiting
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, reducing metabolic activity, and promoting T cell exhaustion.
  In the case of TGF-βR2 ligand binding, the receptor activates and facilitates PI3K
  and AKT signaling through physical interaction with the PI3K subunit. This cascade
  leads to mTOR kinase activation, which drives translational responses. Collectively,
  these signaling pathways induce IDO1 activation, which converts tryptophan to kynurenine,
  thereby enhancing tumor immune evasion through immune suppression. The CD39/CD73
  pathway hydrolyzes extracellular ATP into adenosine, an immunosuppressive metabolite.
  Adenosine prevents tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP70, AKT, and ERK1/2 in naive αCD3/CD28-stimulated
  CD8+ T cells, impairing their activation
