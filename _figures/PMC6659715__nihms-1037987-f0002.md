caption: Model of HCV particle production. (a) HCV particle formation starts on or
  near the surface of LDs, most probably concurrently with envelopment at the ER,
  and continues through the secretory pathway in association with components of VLDL
  synthesis in order to produce a mature form of lipoviroparticles coupled with the
  specific lipoproteins (depicted by yellow color). (b) Core interacts with NS5A on
  the surface or in the close proximity of LDs so the viral RNA can be packed into
  the newly formed core oligomers. This event most probably triggers the capsid assembly.
  p7 recruits the core assembly intermediate to the ER membrane and is necessary for
  the final steps of capsid assembly and the initiation of budding. NS2 brings replication
  and assembly sites in the close vicinity through its interaction between glycoproteins,
  E1 and E2, and NS3/4A
