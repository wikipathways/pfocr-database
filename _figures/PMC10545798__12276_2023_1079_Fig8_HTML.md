caption: Cholesterol is related to various immune cells, including DCs, CD8+ cells,
  neutrophils, NK cells, macrophages, and γδ-T cells, to regulate the cellular immune
  response. IPP regulates GPX4 activity and ferroptosis by promoting Sec-tRNA maturation.
  Cholesterol activates cellular signaling pathways downstream of sonic hedgehog,
  Notch and receptor tyrosine kinases and promotes stem cell development. In addition,
  ZMYND8/SREBP2-coordinated enhancer–promoter interactions activate the MVA pathway
  and promote intestinal stemness. FDPS is critical for cell stemness. Statins, inhibitors
  of HMGCR, affect the DDR by inhibiting CHK1 and p53 activity.
