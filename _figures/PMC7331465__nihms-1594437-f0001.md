caption: The stages of B cell development represent sequential phases of proliferation
  and differentiation. The survival and proliferation of pro-B and large pre-B cells
  is driven by signaling from the IL-7R receptor. IL-7R activates two major signaling
  pathways, JAK–STAT5 and PI3K–AKT. JAK kinases phosphorylate STAT5, which then stimulates
  transcription of cyclin D3, that promotes cell proliferation, and BCL2/MCL1 that
  promote cell survival. In addition, STAT5 also represses BRWD1 and Igk accessibility
  and recombination. The PI3K–AKT pathway inhibits FOXO1 and 3A, which induce the
  recombination-activating gene products RAG1 and 2 that are essential for recombination.
  The PI3K–AKT pathway, in addition to repressing recombination, plays a crucial role
  in cell survival by repressing the proapopotic proteins BAD and BIM. Finally, IL-7R
  signaling serves to promote cell growth and glycolysis via PI3K–AKT signaling, which
  upregulates mTOR and MYC; these in turn drive glycolysis and cell growth. mTOR is
  also upregulated by PLC-γ, another target of IL-7R signaling [,–].
