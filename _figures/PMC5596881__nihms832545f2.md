caption: Comparative microarray analysis of Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− neonates followed
  by bioinformatics suggested downstream Nrf2 target genes bearing functional AREs
  in the lung undergoing saccular-to-alveolar transition and BPD-like pathogenesis.
  Molecules such as cell cycle dependent kinase 1a (Cdkn1a), E2F transcription factor
  4 (F2f4), or colony stimulating factor 2 (Csf2) may participate in the Nrf2-ARE
  pathway during normal saccular-to-alveolar transition. Hyperoxia exposure to the
  premature lung at saccular phase with simple, poorly septated saccules causes lung
  injury and interrupts normal alveolar formation. Nrf2-mediated protection is predicted
  to be through transcriptional activation of antioxidant, cell cycle and DNA repair,
  and mitochondria-related metabolism. Nrf2 deficiency in saccular phase lung suppressed
  these cellular processes and aberrantly activated upstream molecules including transforming
  growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) and myeloid differentiation primary response gene
  88 (Myd88) may drive inflammatory cell infiltration and attenuate DNA repair and
  cell cycle, metabolism, and morphogenesis signaling. Augmented transcriptome of
  T lymphocyte signaling and related acquired immunity during the saccular-to-alveolar
  transition Nrf2−/− neonate lung may predispose the BPD-like phenotypes. Ets family
  transcription factor, interleukin 7 (IL-7), or T cell receptor (Tcr) in association
  with nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) may
  play roles in the upstream of this process. Drugs or chemicals acting on redox balance
  (e.g., sulforaphane, Celastrol), anti-inflammation (e.g., 15-delta prostaglandin
  J2, Isoliquiritigenin, Pathenolide, Celastrol), or anti-cancer (e.g., Elesclomol,
  Pathenolide, Canertinib, Afatinib) mechanisms are suggested as pharmaceutical interventions
  for BPD pathogenesis.
