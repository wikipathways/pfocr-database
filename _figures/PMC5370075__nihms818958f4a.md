caption: '(a) Mechanical regulation of the Hippo pathway. Hippo is regulated by multiple
  signals generated by the physical (matrix stiffness) and biochemical (e.g. LPA,
  thrombin) environment. Importantly, many of these signals are modulated by tension
  in the actinomyosin cytoskeleton. Modulation of cytoskeletal mechanics through G-protein
  coupled receptors and matrix biophysics can likewise inhibit YAP/TAZ directly at
  the nuclear translocation stage or through activation of Hippo components. Note:
  This schematic is simplified to clarify the major components in the mechanical regulation
  of YAP/TAZ signaling. (b) Crosstalk between YAP/TAZ and TGF-β, and between YAP/TAZ
  and Wnt. TGF-β superfamily signaling is initiated by the binding of an extracellular
  ligand (e.g. TGF-β and BMP), which leads to the phosphorylation of SMADs and the
  formation of a complex with a Co-SMAD and 14-3-3s. After translocation to the nucleus,
  these complexes initiate the TGF-β/BMP transcriptional program. The SMAD complex
  also interacts with YAP/TAZ to initiate different transcriptional programs in the
  nucleus. Canonical Wnt is initiated by the binding of a Wnt ligand to the Fzd/LRP
  receptor complex. This induces the inhibitory behavior of Dvl on the Axin/APC/GSK3b
  complex, freeing β-catenin to translocate to the nucleus and initiate the Wnt transcriptional
  program. YAP/TAZ can inhibit Wnt signaling through inhibition of Dvl in the cytoplasm
  (TAZ) or in the nucleus (YAP) or cytoplasmic sequestration of β-catenin (YAP). Alternatively,
  YAP can encourage the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Note: This schematic
  is simplified to clarify the intersections of YAP/TAZ and Wnt signaling. (Adapted
