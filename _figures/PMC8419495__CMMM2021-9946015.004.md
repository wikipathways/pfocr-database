caption: The potential roles of these key genes in PCa. (a) The upregulated PPI was
  associated with the regulation of p53 signaling, Oocyte meiosis, and cell cycle.
  (b) The downregulated PPI was associated with the regulation of the Calcium signaling
  pathway and Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction.
