caption: 'The red or green coloring represents down- or up-regulation, respectively,
  whereas no color indicates the molecule was added from the Ingenuity Knowledge Base
  (Ingenuity Pathway, Ingenuity Systems, Inc., Redwood City, CA). The intensity of
  the node color (light to dark) proportionally indicates the degree of differential
  expression. Straight lines represent binding only, whereas arrowheads symbolize
  action-on. A crosshead bar signifies inhibition. Labels of interaction or relationship:
  A = Activation, CP = Canonical Pathway, E = Expression (includes metabolism or synthesis
  for chemicals), I = Inhibition, LO = Localization. The number in parenthesis for
  each interaction indicates the number of published references in the Ingenuity Knowledge
  Base that support the particular interaction.'
