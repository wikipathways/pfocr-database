caption: (A) The effects of Gal-3 in hippocampal tissue related to cognitive functioning.
  (A) Represents the summary of the main neurodetrimental and neuroprotective effects
  of Gal-3 in hippocampal tissue which potentially impact cognitive functioning. (B)
  The impact of Gal-3 on microglia functions in a neuroinflammatory context. (1) Secreted
  Gal-3 directly binds to TLR4 on the microglia surface and exacerbates inflammatory
  response by enhancing the production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines
  and reactive nitrogen species. (2) Acting as a ligand for TREM2, Gal-3 activates
  TREM2/DAP12 signaling pathway and may further regulate processes of phagocytosis,
  inflammation, and proliferation. (3) IL-4 can interact with its tyrosine kinase
  receptor IL4-R on the microglia surface and increase intracellular production of
  Gal-3 that further activates transcriptional factor PPAR-γ. (4) The lattice formation
  of Gal-3 induces microglia activation through interaction with the interleukin-4
  receptor (IL4R) and activates anti-inflammatory signaling. (5) By crosslinking insulin-like
  growth factor 1 receptor (IGFR-1), secreted Gal-3 prevents early endocytosis and
  over-activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and the transcription of genes needed
  for cell proliferation. TLR4, Toll-like receptor4; TREM2, triggering receptor expressed
  on myeloid cells-2; DAP12, DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa; PPAR-γ, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor gamma; IL-4, Interleukin 4; IL-4R, Interleukin-4
  receptor; JAK/STAT, Janus kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription;
  iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; NOS2, nitric oxide synthase-2; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGF-R, insulin-like growth factor
  receptor; NF- κB, nuclear factor kappa-B; SOCS3, suppressors of cytokines signaling
  3; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; IL, interleukin.
