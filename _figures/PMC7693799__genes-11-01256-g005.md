caption: Molecular enrichment networks of genes associated with diabesity and the
  cluster 1 network enrichment analysis. Visualization of GO gene enrichment profiling
  using Cytoscape on the basis of ClueGO/CluePedia network processing deciphered from
  cluster 1. A combination cluster enrichment analysis, such as the GO BF, MF, and
  KEGG pathway, was provided by the plugin. GO term network connectivity identified
  by gene-shared edges and cohesive clusters (kappa score ≥ 0.4) and showing pathways
  (p-value ≤ 0.05). The node size indicates the p-value. The color code of nodes corresponds
  to the functional group to which they belong. Bold colored characters signify the
  most essential functional terms which define the pathways within each class. Each
  node constitutes a precise term for cluster 1.
