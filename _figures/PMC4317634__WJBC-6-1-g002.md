caption: 'Proposed model by which peroxynitrite-mediated activating transcription
  factor 3 and glucokinase nitration in ethanol-fed mice trigger metabolic syndrome
  through pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis. A: Under normal conditions,
  when glucose is taken up by pancreatic β-cells, it is converted to glucose-6-phosphate
  by glucokinase. Pyruvate transferred into the mitochondria activates the TCA cycle,
  which produces ATP. Increased ATP/ADP ratios prevent potassium efflux via inhibiting
  potassium channels and opening calcium channels. Increased intracellular calcium
  levels activate insulin maturation and its secretion; B: In mice fed with a 5% (v/v)
  ethanol diet for 8 wk, glucokinase (GCK) protein expression was significantly decreased
  in pancreatic tissues and isolated islet cells; C: Ethanol-fed mice showed high
  expression of activating transcription factor (ATF) 3. ATF3 is regulated by the
  ethanol metabolism pathway because ethanol-induced ATF3 was significantly decreased
  by 4-methylpyrazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2E1. ATF3 expression is regulated
  by the peroxynitrite-dependent pathway, but ATF3 did not affect the ethanol-mediated
  production of peroxynitrite. Despite this discrepancy, the C-terminal domain of
  ATF3 is involved in the downregulation of GCK. However, the role of ATF3 and the
  exact regulatory mechanisms involved in GCK downregulation are still not fully understood;
  D: Ethanol-produced peroxynitrite significantly increased GCK nitration on tyrosine
  residues; this effect was abolished by an iNOS inhibitor, L-NMMA, or the peroxynitrite
  scavengers, uric acid and deferoxamine. Interestingly, the nitrated GCK was more
  susceptible to ubiquitination than were the native proteins of control cells, making
  it vulnerable to degradation; E: Cells with downregulated GCK expression lack the
  ability to synthesize insulin and eventually progress to apoptosis. Mice lacking
  the ability to produce insulin may easily develop metabolic syndrome with impaired
  glucose tolerance and insulin insensitivity, resulting in type 2 diabetes.'
