caption: 'The classic Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway: mechanisms in closed and open
  states. A In the absence of Wnt ligands, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is
  in the off-state (OFF-State). At this time, a disruption complex consisting of GSK3β,
  Axin, APC, and CK1 phosphorylates β-catenin. The phosphorylated β-catenin is degraded
  by ubiquitination. In the nucleus, in the absence of β-catenin the LEF/TCF family
  of transcription factors binds to the transcriptional repressor Groucho and represses
  the expression of target genes. B Wnt /β-catenin signaling is active in the presence
  of Wnt ligand (ON-State), which binds to LRP5/6, Fed co-receptors, and subsequently
  recruits Axin, GSK3β, and Dvl, preventing the phosphorylation of β-catenin, and
  thus preventing the formation of the destruction complex. In the nucleus, β-catenin
  binds to transcription factors of the LEF/TCF family to promote target gene expression'
