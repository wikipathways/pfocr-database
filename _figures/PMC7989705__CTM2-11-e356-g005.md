caption: Solute carriers (SLCs) associated with PDAC cell proliferation, angiogenesis,
  invasion, and metastasis. (A) Glutamine is transported into tumor cells by SLC1A5
  and can be used as an efflux substrate by the SLC7A5/SLC3A2 complex to mediate the
  uptake of essential amino acids (EAAs), finally activating the mTOR pathway to promote
  cell proliferation and angiogenesis., ,  Overexpression of c‐Myc induces the expression
  of SLC7A5, which further activates mTOR signaling. (B) The SLC7A11/SLC3A2 complex
  (system Xc−) regulates the uptake of cystine against the efflux of L‐glutamate,
  which further activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to promote cell proliferation.
  The proliferation of tumor cells is also inhibited by miR‐139‐5p expression via
  the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. (C) Overexpression of SLC39A4 upregulates the transcription
  of IL‐6 through CREB, which activates STAT3 to increase cell proliferation and tumor
  progression. SLC39A4 induces the transcription of miR‐373, which inhibits the transcription
  of TP53INP1, LATS2, and CD44 to promote tumor growth. (D) Inhibition of SLC6A14
  decreases tumor cell proliferation by suppressing the mTOR pathway
