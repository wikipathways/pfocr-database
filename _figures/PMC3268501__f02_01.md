caption: Arabidopsis phytochrome chromophore.(A) The biosynthesis pathway of Arabidopsis
  phytochrome chromophore. Image adapted from Kohchi et al. ().(B) Red (R) light triggers
  a “Z” to “E” isomerization in the C15–C16 double bond between the C and D rings
  of the linear tetrapyrrole (upper panel), which is accompanied by rearrangement
  of the apoprotein backbone (lower panel; adapted from ). This results in the photoconversion
  of phytochromes from the Pr form to the Pfr form. Please note that the chromophore
  ring A rather than D is rotated during photoconversion according to a recent NMR
  analysis (). The discrepancy needs to be resolved in future studies. Far-red (FR)
  light converts the Pfr form back to the Pr form.Upper panel image reprinted from
