caption: Signaling and cross talk of the PTH and Wnt signaling pathways in osteocytes.
  In the osteocyte (and late osteoblasts), activation of the canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway occurs upon simultaneous binding of the secreted glycoprotein Wnt3a (or
  other Wnts like Wnt 10b for instance) to the seven-helix-receptor frizzled (Fz)
  family and the coreceptors Lrp 5/6. Binding of Wnt3a to Lrp5/6 changes the conformation
  of the cytoplasmic receptor domain, causing the recruitment of Axin2 and preventing
  the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β and its proteasomal degradation. β-Catenin
  accumulates in the cytosol and translocates into the nucleus, thereby stimulating
  the expression of the Lrp5/6 antagonists Dkk1 and sclerostin, and the RANKL inhibitor
  OPG, via the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (Tcf/Lef). PTH binds to its
  seven-transmembrane-spanning receptor and activates phosphatidyl inositol-specific
  phospholipase C (PLC), cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and the protein kinase
  C (PKC) downstream signaling cascades, all contributing to the bone anabolic effect
  of PTH. In addition, PTH signaling cross talks with the Wnt signaling pathway by
  associating with Lrp6, inhibiting GSK3β, stabilizing β-catenin, and inhibiting the
  expression of both sclerostin and Dkk1.
