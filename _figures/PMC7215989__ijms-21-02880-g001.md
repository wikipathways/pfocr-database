caption: NO3− regulates auxin activity, and consequently controls the NO3− assimilation
  pathway and transport. The model represents the root morphology subjected to four
  different nitrate conditions. (A) The deficient (zero) NO3− stimulates auxin translocation
  from shoot to roots. (B) This mechanism is utilized under low NO3− conditions, either
  NRT1.1 transport auxin from shoot to root, causing LRs emergence, or reduced the
  auxin storage in primordia and new lateral root tip, and subsequently inhibits LRs
  emergence and elongation. Thus considered as the principal regulator for the auxin
  biosynthesis in the root promotes lateral root growth. (C) Under the high nitrate
  NO3− condition; NRT1.1 induces the expression of AFB3, and the AFB3-dependent auxin
  signalling, regulates root growth. The AFB3-NAC4-OBP4 signalling network expressed
  their protein in the root pericycle of the cell. The NAC4 and OBP4 part of the pathway
  is probably regulated by AUX/IAA protein IAA14. The black dotted arrow indicates
  the effect of AFB3 on the IAA accumulation, promotes lateral root initiation under
  high nitrate condition. (D) Under the excessive supply of NO3−; NRT1.1 stimulates
  the ANR1-dependent signalling pathways that modulate lateral root elongation. The
  black dotted arrow indicates the effect of NRT1.1 on the IAA accumulation and expression
  of ANR1 in the LRs primordial, and lateral root development. The question mark represents
  the unconfirmed effect of NRT1.1 nitrate transport activity on the expression of
  ANR1 [].
