caption: Hypoxic activation of apoptosis pathways. Hypoxia activates intracellular
  signalling pathways involved in apoptosis and cell survival. One pathway of particular
  importance is hypoxia-induced mitochondrial membrane permability, leading to subsequent
  release of cytochrome C into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome C initiates the apoptosis
  cascade via activation of the apoptosis kinase Apaf-1, which in turn activates the
  caspase 9 apoptosis pathway. Hypoxia also activates JNK/SAPK signalling pathways
  which leads to apoptosis induction by an as yet unknown mechanism. The protein kinase
  Akt plays a central role in cell survival via induction of anti-apoptotic mechanisms,
  involving the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-xL. Akt is also involved in hypoxia-induced
  HIF-dependent VEGF expression, a signalling cascade that can be inhibited by the
  tumor suppressor PTEN. PTEN exerts its negative regulatory effects via inhibition
  of phosphatidylinositol (3,4) and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) phosphorylation.
  Late-stage tumors often display mutated PTEN or show a complete loss of PTEN expression,
  which leads to a de-repression of the survival phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase-Akt
  signalling pathway. PDK, PtdIns (3,4,5)P3-dependent kinase.
