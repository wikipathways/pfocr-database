caption: 'Schematic representation of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (adapted
  from []). Enzymes are indicated in red, and classes of compounds are in green. Anthocyanidin
  is further modified with glycosyl, acyl, or methyl groups, resulting in the “decorated”
  anthocyanin. In this case, UF3GT is responsible for the glycosylation of anthocyanidins.
  The proposed anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway for Passiflora edulis is highlighted
  by the colored background. CHS: chalcone sintase; CHI: chalcone isomerase; F3H:
  flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H: flavanone 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H: flavanone 3′5′-hydroxylase;
  DFR: dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; LDOX/ANS: leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase/anthocyanidin
  synthase; GT: glucosyltransferase; GST: glutathione S-transferase.'
