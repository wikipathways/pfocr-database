caption: 'Proposed model of how deflavination of ACAD9 by ECSIT permits the coordinated
  regulation of the FAO and OXPHOS pathways. Clockwise from lower left: In the absence
  of ECSIT, ACAD9 acts as an acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase enzyme in the first step of the
  fatty acid β‐oxidation (FAO) pathway. To exert this function, ACAD9 needs the insertion
  of FAD prosthetic group into the catalytic pocket. Then, dehydrogenation of the
  acyl‐CoA substrate into an enoyl‐CoA intermediate metabolite is concomitant with
  the reduction of the FAD into FADH2 (solid blue lines). This allows the transfer
  of electrons to the FAD bound to electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and subsequently
  to the ETF‐ubiquinone oxireductase (ETF‐QO), ultimately allowing the electrons to
  reach the ubiquinone (UQ) pool in the respiratory chain (dashed blue lines). Lower
  left to lower right: ECSIT binding induces the ejection of FAD from ACAD9 and also
  inhibits the FAD reuptake step (dashed red lines), shutting down its dehydrogenase
  activity. This antagonizes the function of ACAD9 in FAO and results in its redeployment
  as a CI assembly factor. In parallel, the ability of ECSIT to recruit NDUFAF1 (dashed
  red line) allows formation of the entire MCIA holocomplex with the other membrane
  components TIMMDC1, TMEM186, TMEM126B and COA1. The latter is required for the assembly
  of a functional CI and subsequently for the activation of the respiratory chain
  as part of the OXPHOS system, implying the pumping of a proton gradient (H+, grey
  dashed lines) across the mitochondrial inner membrane that ultimately drives the
  generation of ATP (green dashed lines). For sake of clarity, only the binding of
  NDUFAF1‐ECSIT to one of the ACAD9 monomers is shown.'
