caption: Model of the quorum sensing regulatory pathway in Vibrio coralliilyticus.
  The putative QS system of Vcor and proteins predicted to function in the QS circuit
  are shown. Bright-colored proteins represent experimentally confirmed pathways either
  in this manuscript or previously published research. Gray-colored proteins and pathways
  that have yet to be investigated in Vcor, or their activity was not confirmed in
  this project. The predicted histidine kinase binding proteins (LuxPQ, CqsS, LuxN,
  CqsR, and HqsK) are encoded by Vcor and function as phosphatases at high cell density
  (HCD) and kinases at low cell density (LCD); these proteins transfer phosphate to
  and from two core QS regulatory proteins LuxU and the final phosphate relay protein,
  LuxO. At HCD, dephosphorylated LuxO inactivates the transcription of the three Vcor
  Qrr sRNAs, and the protein levels of the VcpR master transcriptional regulator increase
  to regulate its own feedback loop and group behaviors (e.g., type VI secretion system
  [T6SS], protease and toxin secretion). At LCD, transcribed Qrr sRNAs block the production
  of VcpR and activate the translation of the transcriptional regulator AphA, leading
  to the regulation of LCD behaviors (e.g., biofilm formation). This model labels
  the periplasm (PP), inner membrane (IM), and cytoplasm (CP) along the membrane.
