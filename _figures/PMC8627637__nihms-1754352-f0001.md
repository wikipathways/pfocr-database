caption: Regulation of Nrf2. (A) Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)
  protein is constitutively generated and, along with the Kelch-like ECH associated
  protein (KEAP1), is located in the cytoplasm. (B) In the basal state, Nrf2 associates
  with the Keap1/Cullin3 (KEAP1/Cul3) ubiquitin ligase complex in the cytosol, which
  ubiquitinates Nrf2 and targets it for proteasomal degradation. (C) Exposure to reactive
  oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), electrophiles, or phosphorylation by certain
  kinases, such as protein kinase C (PKC), PRK-ER-related kinase (PERK), mitogen activated
  protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK), or casein kinase 2 (CK2), inhibits
  the association of the Keap1/Cul3 complex with Nrf2, causing it to build up in the
  cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation of Nrf2
  allows it to translocate to the nucleus. Phosphorylated Nrf2 then binds to small
  Maf (sMaf) proteins and promotes gene expression via binding to antioxidant/electrophile
  response elements (ARE/EREs) in the promoter regions of genes that affect redox
  homeostasis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and metabolic up-regulators. Collectively
  this pattern of gene expression inhibits inflammation. (D) Glycogen synthase kinase-3β
  (GSK-3β) inhibits Nrf2 expression. This is carried out either through phosphorylation
  on a different site and recognition by the β-transducin repeats-containing protein/Cullin-1
  (β-Trcp/Cul1) ubiquitin ligase complex that targets it for nuclear export and degradation,
  or by activation and translocation of the nuclear kinase FYN, which may cause dissociation
  of Nrf2 from ARE/EREs, thereby halting gene expression and leading to proteasomal
  degradation. GSK-3β can be inhibited by AMPK through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-γ coactivator alpha (PGC-1α) and subsequent expression of protein p38,
  as well as through the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/AKT (PI3K/AKT) pathway.
