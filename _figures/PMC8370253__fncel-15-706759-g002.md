caption: 'Potential effects of RIC on VCI pathobiologies. The beneficial effects of
  RIC on VCI is associated with (A) increased CFB: the NOTCH1 signaling pathway may
  be involved in angiogenesis, which increases vascular diameter and promotes collateral
  formation. The eNOS/Nitrite/NO system plays an important role in the process of
  angiogenesis. The sheer stress induced by RIC upregulates the synthesis of eNOS
  in triggered organ and increases the concentration of nitrite in the circulation
  (not shown in this illustration). Nitrite reduces to NO under hypoxia condition
  and promotes new capillary formation. In addition, NO is an essential vasoactive
  agent in the regulation of vascular tension and cerebral autoregulation. (B) improved
  WM integrity (C) decreased neuronal death (D) restoration of endothelial function
  (E) reduced oligodendrocyte loss: the potential underlying mechanism is associated
  with decreased apoptosis of oligodendrocytes through activation of the PTEN/Akt/mTOR
  pathway. (F) attenuated oxidative stress: RIC can upregulate the expression of Nrf2
  and attenuate the oxidative stress induced by hypoperfusion through promoting the
  expression of anti-oxidant enzymes, such as GSH and HO-1. This may partially mediated
  by the elevation of ET-1 in the plasma, which further upregulates the concentration
  of H2S within the brain. (G) decreased inflammation response: RIC can decrease the
  systemic inflammation by downregulating the level of inflammatory cytokines and
  leukocyte count. Meanwhile, RIC can mitigate neuroinflammation as evidenced by decreased
  expression of IBA-1 and GFAP, which are the markers of reactive microglial and reactive
  astrocytes, respectively. The expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, markers of endothelial
  activation, are also downregulated. In addition, this was accompanied with less
  deposition of Ab protein.'
