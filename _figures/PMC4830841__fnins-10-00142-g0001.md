caption: 'Sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation of the coeliac and superior
  mesenteric plexus ganglia, and immune and cytokine mechanisms in cholinergic anti-inflammatory
  pathway. The acetylcholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, the efferent arc of the
  inflammatory reflex (Section Inflammation and Arterial Rigidity; Tracey, ) converging
  in the spleen, has been discussed under the aspect of being a target for possible
  interventions counteracting autonomic imbalance in the metabolic syndrome related
  to chronic inflammation. Schematically depicted are innervations from the sympathetic
  and parasympathetic branches of the ANS, with their transmitters, into organ systems
  relevant for MetS. Left part panel (A): efferent fibers in the sympathetic branch
  with adrenoceptor type. Middle part panel (B): mixed sympathetic and vagal fiber
  connections into the coeliac and the superior mesenteric plexus ganglia innervating
  liver, pancreas and spleen. Right part panel (C): efferent fibers in the parasympathetic
  branch of the ANS. The insert panel (D) to the outer right hand side illustrates
  schematically the role of vagus stimulation-derived, yet noradrenergic transmission
  into liver and spleen, and the acetylcholinergic transmission between CD4+ T helper
  cells and macrophages in the spleen. Vagus departs the brainstem as its cranial
  nerve X, and vagal efferent outflow regulates visceral organs by counterbalancing
  sympathoexcitation, inhibiting cytokine release, and safeguarding against inflammatory
  damage to liver, pancreas, spleen, lungs, or kidneys in endotoxaemic states. The
  outflow of the vagus nerve triggers adrenergic neurons in the coeliac ganglion innervating
  the spleen further to liver and pancreas. Vagal influence to spleen T lymphocytes
  stimulates the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), and activation
  of the α7 subunit of the nicotinic ACh receptor (α7 nAChR; Section Inflammation
  and Arterial Rigidity) expressed on cell membranes of splenic macrophages and other
  cytokine secreting cells. Vagal tone attenuates here production of the inflammatory
  response cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) reciprocally related to sympathoexcitation
  (Zhang et al., ; Kisiswa et al., ). In the liver, noradrenergic innervation signals
  hepatic innate natural killer T cells (iNKT) (Van Kaer et al., ) to exert systemic
  immunosuppression. Increasing the vagal tone there induces a shift from pro-inflammatory
  T helper cell type 1 (TH1) cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to anti-inflammatory
  TH2-type cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) (Tracey, , ; Rosas-Ballina et
  al., , ; Trakhtenberg and Goldberg, ). PVNH hypothalamic insulin promoter expressing
  neurons downregulate postprandial inflammation through cholinergic signaling in
  the spleen mediated by vagal outflow to the spleen, whereas vagotomy results in
  T2DM (Carvalheira et al., ; Wang L. et al., ). Vagus stimulation approaches for
  increasing vagal tone would therefore aim to counterbalance prolonged sympathoexcitation
  in MetS by supporting parasympathetic output. These could comprise, but are not
  limited to, device-based, pharmacological, and/or psychotherapeutic intervention
  approaches. With the advent of wearable transcutaneous stimulation devices, vagus
  nerve stimulation has become a convenient neuropsychological intervention method
  (Van Leusden et al., ). Drug discovery is still required to identify non-steroidal
  anti-inflammatory substances targeting the cholinergic pathway either peripherally
  (such as nicotinic α7 nAChR agonist applications) and/or centrally (such as CNI-1493),
  or existing TNFα antagonists such as infliximab or etanercept. Possible behavioral
  interventions: Guided physical activity trainings, mindfulness-based psychotherapies,
  psychosomatic body-relaxation and/or balancing techniques, biofeedback training.
  Other: immunotherapy yet to be developed (Van Kaer et al., ). Medical illustrations
