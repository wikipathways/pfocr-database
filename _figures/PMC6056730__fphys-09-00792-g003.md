caption: Wnt/β-catenin signaling participates in HFD-induced depot-specific hypertrophy
  and hyperplasia. In response to HFD stimulation, vWAT (including eWAT) adipocyte
  precursors are first activated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling, leading to their rapid
  and transient burst of proliferation “overproliferation.” Then adipocyte precursors
  stop “overproliferation”, remain quiescent, and wait for another signal to reactivate.
  Meanwhile, the PDGFRα pathway is activated, inhibits “overproliferated” adipocyte
  precursor adipogenesis (possibly) via suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling, then
  triggers hypertrophy of existing mature adipocytes. Hypertrophied adipocytes may
  secrete some adipokines to promote the subsequent lipid filling of these activated
  APs. However, in sWAT (including iWAT), HFD stimulation activates Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling to promote SWAT mature adipocytes hypertrophy. As hypertrophied adipocytes
  reach their maximal size and secrete adipokines or emit other signals, adipocyte
  precursors are then induced to “overproliferation” and new adipocytes will form
  to meet the demand of increasing lipid storage.
