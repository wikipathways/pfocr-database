caption: (a) Examples of viral proteins subverting SCF E3 ligase complex. Several
  viruses had already been shown to encode proteins that may interfere or plays as
  components of the SCF E3 ligase complex to benefit viral infection. Color of the
  arrows are representing the cellular process affected by the subverting of E3 ligase
  complex by individual virus. Viral proteins represented by a hexagon shape may act
  as plant F-box proteins taking part directly of the complex, leading to the ubiquitination
  of their targets, or may compete for SKP1 with the host F-box protein. A putative
  host F-box protein is shown in gray inside the complex. (b) Some of these viral
  proteins may hypothetically take part in the complex acting as F-box proteins, as
  already shown for P0, C10, and p22. P0 of the polerovirus interacts with host SKP1,
  affecting RNAi antiviral defense. BrYV P0 interaction with SKP1 in A. thaliana suppress
  P0 degradation by SCFP0 stabilizing it and allowing P0 AGO degradation by autophagy.
  Clink (C10) of FBNYV interacts with SKP1 and with RB. As C10 interferes in cell
  cycle regulation, it can be hypothesized that it may target RB to be ubiquitinated
  by SCF complex allowing cell cycle activation. The p22 protein of ToCV presents
  an F-box-like domain that interacts with host SKP1 and interferes with the correct
  assembling of host SCF complex, perturbing hormone signaling. The C4 protein of
  the geminivirus BSCTV interacts with RKP E3 ligase, promoting the degradation of
  the cell cycle inhibition protein ICK/KRP and inducing cell cycle that favors virus
  replication. C2 proteins of BSCTV, TYCLV, and BCTV interact with the CSN enzyme,
  which promotes deneddylation of CUL1 and makes the SCF complexes responsible for
  SAMDC1 and JAZ degradation unable to work properly. In consequence, DNA methylation
  and de novo methylation and JA defense pathway are impaired, respectively. The presence
  of TGBp3 from PVX, by its side, induces host SKP1 expression, affecting UPR regulation
  and programmed cell death (a). The βC1 protein of satellite virus of the geminivirus
  CLCuMuV interacts with SKP1 interfering with SCF formation. βC1 from TYLCCNV interacts
  with the NBR1 protein, impairing the correct functioning of SCF RFP1, which would
  otherwise ubiquitinate βC1 and promote its degradation by proteasome. Thus, interference
  or usurpation of SCF E3 ligase complex seems to be common among plant viruses.
