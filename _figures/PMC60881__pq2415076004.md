caption: Schematic representation of the cellular effects of estrogen in the brain.
  Estrogen produces both the regulation of genomic events through its binding to traditional
  hormonal receptors, the translocation of the estrogen-receptor complexes to the
  nucleus, and the activation of a major intracellular cascade. The former pathway
  is expected to account for the slow effects of estrogen on cells and tissues, including
  its neuroprotective/neurotrophic effects via the activation of antiapoptotic genes.
  In addition, estrogen activates the intracellular cascade consisting of the ERK/MAP
  kinase pathway. This pathway is well suited to regulate both additional genomic
  events after translocation of activated ERK into the nucleus and also membrane receptors
  [such as the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) or NMDA receptors],
  ion channels, and intracellular enzymes. This pathway is expected to account for
  the rapid effects of estrogen on cells and tissues. In particular, we postulate
  that tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors results in the increased function
  of the receptors and facilitation of LTP formation. This pathway also could be involved
  in the synaptic remodeling taking place in hippocampus and other brain structures
  during the estrus cycle.
