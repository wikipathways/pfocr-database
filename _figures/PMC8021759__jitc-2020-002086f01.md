caption: Methods to circumvent antiviral immunity. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) exert their
  effect by infecting the cancer cells, replicating, and inducing oncolysis. Iimmunogenic
  cell death of the tumor subsequently activates anti-viral and anti-tumor T cells.
  However, viral activity is limited by the humoral, innate and adaptive cellular
  immune components of the host. Several approaches aim to counteract each arm of
  the immune system to protect the viruses and maximize tumor regression. OVs can
  be shielded from the humoral immune responses of B cells and the complement pathway
  through encapsulation OVs in protective coatings and cellular carriers, genetic
  modification of the viral capsid to reduce expression of common viral epitopes,
  and administration of bispecific engagers that can bind neutralizing antibodies
  and tumors cells on different ends. To confer OVs stealth characteristic, the innate
  immunity can be tamed through the inhibition of the anti-viral interferon (IFN)
  pathway, the natural killer cells and antigen presentation. T cell immunodominance
  from viral antigens can be overcome through nanoparticle-enveloped viral antigens
  and tolerogenic dendritic cells. ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; ISRE, interferon-stimulated
  response element; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; NK, natural killer; TAP,
  transporter associated with antigen processing.
