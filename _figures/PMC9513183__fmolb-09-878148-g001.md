caption: The signalling of a DSB is initiated via the binding of the MRN complex which
  initiates resection. During HR, the ends of the double-strand break (DSB) are resected
  by nucleases, exposing single-strand DNA (ssDNA) that becomes bound by RPA. The
  mediator protein, BRCA2 initiates the loading of RAD51 onto ssDNA, helping to displace
  RPA. RAD51 oligomerizes, forms a nucleoprotein filament, and then searches for the
  homologous DNA sequence on the intact chromosome. RAD51 filament invades the intact
  dsDNA and forms a D-loop structure. It is further processed by DNA polymerases,
  chromatin remodelers (RAD54), nucleases, and ligases to restore it back to its original
  sequences. (Adapted from ().
