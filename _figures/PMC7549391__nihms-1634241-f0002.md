caption: 'Left, simplified schematic of the ceramide-biosynthesis pathway, highlighting
  enzymes discussed in this review. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion
  of SPT, CERS1, CERS6 and DES1 lowers ceramides and ameliorates insulin resistance
  and cardiometabolic disorders. Moreover, transgenic overexpression of ASAH1, ADIPOR1
  or ADIPOR2 produces the same beneficial effects. Right, simplified schematic depicting
  the central hypothesis that ceramides are gauges of FFA excess. The mechanisms that
  ceramides invoke are as follows: (1) redistribution of CD36 toward the plasma membrane,
  thus facilitating the safe uptake of FFA and enhancing the conversion of fatty acids
  into acyl-CoA; (2) induction of Srebf1, thus stimulating the synthesis of cholesterol,
  a partner of ceramide and sphingomyelin in lipid rafts, and inducing genes that
  facilitate the conversion of FFA into inert triglycerides; (3) inhibition of Akt
  (PKB), which slows glucose utilization in adipose tissue and muscle, thus facilitating
  the usage of lipids for energy, while inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis; (4) inhibition
  of HSL, which prevents liberation of additional FFA from lipid droplest; (5) inhibition
  of mitochondrial complexes, thus calibrating the metabolic efficiency in situations
  with energy surplus; (6) repression of lipase expression by ceramide synthases.
