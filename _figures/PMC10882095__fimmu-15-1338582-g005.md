caption: 'Overview of immune molecule interaction network in the blood and heart tissues
  of chronic Chagas disease (CCC) patients. This illustration summarizes the interaction
  network of immune molecules in the blood and heart tissue of patients with chronic
  Chagas disease (CCC). Elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, CXCL10, CCL5 are observed
  in both the blood and heart tissue. Furthermore, the levels of IL-1β and IL12 remain
  unchanged in both compartments (blood and heart). The CCL2 chemokine is decreased
  in plasma and heart of CCC. Notably, an equivalence is observed between the levels
  of soluble factors in the plasma and their gene expression levels in the cardiac
  tissue of CCC patients. Importantly, these soluble mediators in the blood and their
  corresponding genes in the heart are implicated in the enrichment of the same signaling
  pathways: cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor pathway, IL-17
  signaling pathway and Chemokine signaling pathways. Molecules highlighted in bold
  indicate similar behavior in the blood and heart tissue. Color code: molecules highlighted
  in red are increased, in green are reduced and, in black, remained unchanged. Created
