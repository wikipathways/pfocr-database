caption: TGF-β signaling in cardiac fibrosis. TGF-β could induce the signal transduction
  via the canonical (SMAD-dependent) and non-canonical (SMAD-independent) pathways.
  In the canonical pathway, TGF-β1 binds to and causes heterodimerization of TGF-β
  receptor type 1 (TβRI, also known as activin-like kinase (ALK) 5) and the type II
  receptor (TβRII), leading to the phosphorylation of SMAD2/SMAD3, which subsequently
  form a complex with SMAD4 and translocate into the nucleus, acting as a transcriptional
  factor to regulate the fibrotic gene expression (e.g., αSMA, collagen I, III or
  TNC). SMAD6/7 are inhibitory SMADs to inhibit transcription of SMAD2 and SMAD3.
  In canonical pathways, TGF-β1 can also induce SMAD-independent noncanonical signaling
  that involves several mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (Erk), c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), TGF-β-activated kinase
  1 (TAK1), Rho family of small GTPase, and p38 MAPK pathways.
