caption: AMPK is activated when AMP and ADP levels in the cells rise due to variety
  of physiological stresses, as well as pharmacological inducers. LKB1 is the upstream
  kinase activating it in response to AMP increase, whereas CAMKK2 activates AMPK
  in response to calcium increase. Activated AMPK directly phosphorylates a number
  of subtrates to acutely impact metabolism and growth, as well as phosphorylating
  a number of transcriptional regulators that mediate long term metabolic reprogramming.
  Shown are all the best-established substrates to date-those needing further in vivo
  examination are italicized. Question marks denote candidate substrates whose identified
  phosphorylation sites diverge from the established optimal substrate motif (which
  all the others conform to). A full lineup of the identified AMPK phosphorylation
  sites in these substrates in . Substrates in red have been reported to serve as
  substrates of other AMPK family members (SIK1, SIK2, MARKs, SADs) in vivo in addition
  to being substrates of AMPK.
