caption: Following infection, multiple host sensors have been shown to respond to
  alphavirus infection. The alphavirus genome and replicative intermediates can engage
  Toll-like-receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR7, and the RIG-I-like receptors RIG-I and MDA5.
  These sensors signal through the downstream adaptor proteins MyD88, TRIF, or MAVS
  to activate a signaling cascade that results in activation of transcription factors
  IRF3 and IRF7, which translocate to the nucleus and induce type I IFN. Several C-type
  lectin receptors (CLRs) have been reported to respond to alphaviruses. DC-SIGN and
  L-SIGN can enhance alphavirus entry. DCIR responds to alphaviruses by decreasing
  inflammation, although the signaling pathway by which this occurs is not understood.
  MBL, a soluble c-type lectin, increases inflammatory mediators in response to alphaviruses.
  Nod-like receptors are also engaged by alphaviruses, although the activating signal
  is not known. NLRP3, and likely other NLRs, can be activated during alphavirus infection,
  driving the formation of an inflammasome composed of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1.
  Activation of caspase-1 by the inflammasome allows for proteolytic cleavage of pro-IL-1β,
  resulting in secretion of IL-1β.
