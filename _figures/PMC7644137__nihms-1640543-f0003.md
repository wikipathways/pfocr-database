caption: 'Endogenous and exogenous antigen presentation by MHC-I. (A) MHC-I presentation
  of endogenous antigenic peptides in cancer cells begins with degradation of the
  antigen by the proteasome. The degraded peptides are then translocated into the
  ER lumen through TAP. In the lumen, the peptides are trimmed by ERAP1/2 and loaded
  onto MHC-I. The fully assembled peptide-MHC-I complex is transported via the Golgi
  to the cell surface for presentation to CD8+ T cells. When β2m is absent or downregulated,
  the MHC-I heavy chain will be removed from the ER through ERAD. (B) Exogenous antigens
  can be presented to T cells by antigen presenting cells through two major pathways.
  The first pathway, the vacuolar pathway, begins with the exogenous antigen internalized
  into a phagosome, where it is degraded by cathepsin S and then loaded onto MHC-I
  for transportation to the cell surface. The second pathway, the endosome pathway,
  begins with the antigen exiting the phagosome through SEC61 and P97 to the cytosol
  for proteasome-mediated degradation. From this point, the peptides will be transported
  to the cell surface following a path similar to (A). Alternatively, the peptides
  will be transported back to the phagosome by TAP and loaded onto MHC-I for transportation
  to the cell surface. TAP: transporter associated with antigenic presentation; ERAP:
  ER aminopeptidase associated with antigen processing.'
