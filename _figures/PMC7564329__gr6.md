caption: A proposed molecular mechanism underlying increased neural excitabilities
  and susceptibility to ischemic injury caused by IL-4 deficiency. IL-4 binding to
  IL-4R actives IL-4 pathway. IL-4 deficiency alters gene transcriptions by downregulating
  the Kcnn4 gene encoding KCa3.1 protein and Gabra6 gene encoding GABAA receptor chloride
  channel and upregulating the Scna1 gene encoding Nav1.1 protein through IL-4 signaling
  pathways. Downregulation of KCa3.1 channels and tonic GABAA receptors can reduce
  potassium outflow and chloride inflow in neurons, leading to enhanced neuronal firings
  through membrane depolarization. The upregulation of Nav1.1 channels can increase
  sodium inflow in neurons. All these alterations can enhance neuronal hyperexcitability
  and glutamate release from excitatory axon terminals, ultimately increasing susceptibility
  to ischemic injury. Conversely, enhancement of IL-4 signaling through supplemental
  IL-4 can increase KCa3.1 and α6 subunit of GABAA receptors in cortical neurons and
  reverse neuronal hyperexcitability, thus exerting neuroprotection against ischemic
  injury.
