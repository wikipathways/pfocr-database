caption: 'TSLP isoforms. TSLP has two isoforms covering two distinct roles: sfTSLP
  (63 amino acids) for homeostasis and lf TSLP (159 amino acids) for inflammatory
  responses. Each isoform is under the control of different promoter regions directed
  by distinct pathways, with the vitamin D receptor/retinoid X receptor pathway specific
  for sfTSLP expression and the AP-1/NF-kB pathway for lfTSLP. Both isoforms share
  the same Cterminus amino acid sequence but have distinct N-terminus sequences.'
