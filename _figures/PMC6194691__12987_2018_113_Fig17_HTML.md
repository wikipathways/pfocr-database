caption: The glutamate/glutamine cycle shown in bold with indication of some of the
  losses and of replenishment of glutamate by denovo synthesis. Glutamate (Glu) in
  the presynaptic neuron is packaged into vesicles and released into the ISF during
  neurotransmission. Most of the glutamate is taken up into the astrocytes by the
  transporter Eaat1 (glast, Slc1a3) where it is converted to glutamine (Gln) by addition
  of an NH4+ by the enzyme glutamine synthase (g.s) [, ]. The glutamine is transported
  into the ISF by Snat3 and/or Snat5 (Slc38a3 and Slc38a5) from which it is taken
  up into the presynaptic terminals again by a transporter that may be a Snat. The
  glutamate is then regenerated by glutaminase (g.a). This cycle represents a large
  turnover of the amide group at the end of the side chain in glutamine, estimated
  to be 55% of the CMRglc (cerebral metabolic rate of glucose, see Sect. ) for the
  entire brain in rats amounting to 490 nmol g−1 min−1 (estimated value in humans
  280 nmol g−1 min−1) [] (G. A. Dienel, personal communication). However the requirement
  for NH4+ consumed in the conversion of glutamate to glutamine within the astrocytes
  is balanced by an equal release of NH4+ in the reverse conversion in neurons. Whether
  diffusion of NH4+ itself is adequate to transfer the nitrogen from neurons to astrocytes
  as shown or some other form of N carrier is required remains controversial [, ,
  ]. Regardless, if there were no losses of glutamine or glutamate from the cycle,
  there would be no need for any fluxes of amino acids into or out of the parenchyma
  to support glutaminergic neurotransmission. However, there are losses of glutamate
  and glutamine from the cycle [, , ]. At least in rodents, such losses are made good
  by de novo synthesis of glutamate in the astrocytes. Estimates of the total rate
  of loss and of de novo synthesis are around 11% of CMRglc ([, ] (G. A. Dienel, personal
  communication), i.e. about 0.11 × 0.9 µmol g−1 min−1 ≅ 100 nmol g−1 min−1. The carbon
  skeletons for the de novo synthesis are derived ultimately from glucose. Glucose
  is metabolized to two molecules of pyruvate one of which is carboxylated by pyruvate
  carboxylase (p.c) (thought to be present within the brain only in astrocytes) to
  form oxaloacetic acid (OAA) a component of the citric acid cycle. Addition of acetyl-CoA
  from the second pyruvate then forms citrate, which is decarboxylated to form α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG). Glutamate is then formed either a by transamination (t.a) of α-ketoglutarate
  using leucine or other amino acids as source (see e.g. [, , , ], or b by addition
  of NH4+ [] catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (g.d). The latter is believed to
  be a minor pathway [, , ]. The source of the amino groups for transamination is
  considered further in Sect.  and Fig. . Data for the pathways involved in glutamate
  synthesis are much less extensive for human than for rat. Rothman and colleagues
  [, ] have argued that the α-ketoglutarate is synthesized in astrocytes based on
  measurements of incorporation of 13C (see [, ]). However, the failure to find a
  key transaminase in human astrocytes by immunohistochemistry [, ] has cast some
  doubt on astrocytes being the major site for the conversion from α-ketoglutarate
  to glutamate. For recent reviews of glutamate synthesis see [, , ]
