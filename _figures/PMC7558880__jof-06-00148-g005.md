caption: Pathway level display of genes involved in sucrose and starch metabolism,
  produced with MapMan []. Changes of transcripts levels in Myc and Non-Myc Oeceoclades
  maculata roots are indicated in the squares. Blue squares represent genes up-regulated,
  whereas red squares represent genes down-regulated in Myc roots, as compared with
  Non-Myc roots. Grey dots represent genes that were not mapped in the current dataset.
  A reference scale is on the left.
