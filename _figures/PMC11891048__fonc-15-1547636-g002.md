caption: S-palmitoylation is involved in immune response types. (A) S-palmitoylation
  plays a key role in the modification of TCR signaling pathway-associated proteins
  (e.g. CD4, CD8, Lck, Zap-70, LAT, and PLCγ1), affecting their membrane localization,
  stability, and signaling, and thus regulating T cell activation and function. (B)
  ZDHHC19/APT1 promotes the localization of SQSTM1/P62 on phagocyte membranes by regulating
  its S-palmitoylation and synergizes with LC3 for autophagosome formation and pathogen
  isolation. (C) Enzymes such as ZDHHC5/8/7/3 are involved in the regulation of Gp130
  and STAT3 in the IL-6 signaling pathway through S-palmitoylation modification, which
  affects their plasma membrane localization and phosphorylation status, and thus
  promotes STAT3 activation and nuclear translocation, and ultimately regulates the
  differentiation of Th17 cells. (D) Enzymes such as ZDHHC3/7/11/12/21 play important
  roles in apoptosis of immune and tumor cells by regulating the Fas/FasL signaling
  pathway, cysteine asparaginase activity, and the function of Bcl-2 family proteins.
  (E) Enzymes such as ZDHHC5 and APT1 regulate the dynamic palmitoylation process
  of CD36, which affects lipid recognition and phagocytosis and is critical for fatty
  acid uptake and immune cell function. APC, Antigen Presenting Cell; MHC, Major Histocompatibility
