caption: a Schematic representation of the branched pathway in Clostridium acetobutylicum
  for synthesis of lysine, methionine, threonine and isoleucine from aspartate. Arrows
  represent multiple enzymatic steps. Feedback inhibition by threonine and lysine
  on aspartate kinase was showed in gray lines. Scheme 1b reaction catalyzed by aspartate
  kinase. Schematic diagram generated using the program ISIS/Draw .
