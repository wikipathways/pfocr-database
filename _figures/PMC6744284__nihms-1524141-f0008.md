caption: Differentially expressed transcripts in FSGS were enriched in the JAK-STAT
  pathway in the glomeruli. (A) Signaling network nodes highlighted in purple indicate
  those genes that were differentially expressed in FSGS relative to living donor
  controls, while shading of the nodes indicates up-regulation (red) or down-regulation
  (green) in FSGS relative to living donor controls. (B) Predicated activation of
  STAT related signaling nodes in the glomeruli with evidence supporting activation
  of STAT1 indicated (C). Network supporting STAT1 activation in the glomeruli. Orange
  and blue connections indicate that STAT1 can induce or inhibit expression of downstream
  genes. These findings are consistent with STAT1 activation. Yellow connections indicate
  findings that are inconsistent with STAT1 activation, while grey lines are findings
  that neither support nor reject the predicated activation of STAT1.
