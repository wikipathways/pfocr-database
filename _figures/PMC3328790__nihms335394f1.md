caption: TGFβ signaling pathway and its integration with other major pathways that
  is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases in elderly
  patients. The canonical TGFβ pathway involves SMADs. The non-canonical TGFβ pathways
  include several SMAD-independent signaling cascades such as calcium-calcineurin
  and MAPK pathways. The Ang II pathway can interact with TGFβ signaling through both
  SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways (see text for details).
