caption: 'Pyroptosis mediated by the canonical and non-canonical inflammasome pathways.
  This diagram illustrates the two major pathways involved in the induction of pyroptosis:
  the canonical inflammasome pathway and the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. In
  the canonical pathway (left), pathogenic microorganisms trigger the assembly of
  the NLRP3 inflammasome by activating pattern recognition receptors such as NOD,
  PYD, ASC, and CARD. This leads to the activation of Caspase-1, which cleaves pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (Pro-IL-1β and Pro-IL-18) into their active forms (IL-1β and IL-18) and
  also activates GSDMD, releasing its N-terminal domain (GSDMD-N), which then assembles
  pores in the membrane, culminating in pyroptosis. In the non-canonical pathway (right),
  gram-negative bacteria release LPS, which is recognized by Caspase-4/5/11. This
  activation also leads to the cleavage of GSDMD, resulting in the release of its
  active N-terminal domain (GSDMD-N) and pore formation. In this pathway, Caspase-1
  is also activated but is involved in cleaving Pro-IL-1β and Pro-IL-18, promoting
  further inflammation and the onset of pyroptosis. Both pathways culminate in membrane
  rupture and the release of inflammatory cytokines, playing a crucial role in the
  host’s immune defense response'
