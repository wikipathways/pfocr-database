caption: De novo biosynthesis of dolichol phosphate in human. Polyisoprenoids are
  generated by the condensation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl
  pyrophosphate (DMAPP), the 5-carbon building blocks of all isoprenoids. The mevalonate
  pathway is responsible for the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP. The first step dedicated
  to dolichol biosynthesis is the elongation of farnesyl pyrophosphate by the dehydrodolichyl
  diphosphate synthase (DHDDS) . This cis-prenyl transferase uses IPP as substrates
  to produce polyprenol pyrophosphate. It is believe that this polyprenol pyrophosphate
  is then dephosphorylated into polyprenol before its reduction by SRD5A5. Finally,
  the dolichol kinase (DOLK) transfers a phosphate from CTP to dolichol
