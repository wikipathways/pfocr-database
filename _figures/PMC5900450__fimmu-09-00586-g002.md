caption: 'The arachidonic acid (AA) pathway of inflammation mediators. In the simplified
  pathway for the eicosanoid metabolic pathway, AA is released from membrane stores
  by phospholipase 2 (PLA2). AA is metabolized to biological mediators by three enzymatic
  pathways: cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and cytochrome P450. Each pathway contains
  enzyme-specific steps that result in a wide variety of bioactive compounds that
  drive the pro-inflammatory (prostaglandins) response. After lipid mediator class-switching
  at the height of inflammation, the pro-resolving mediators-lipoxins begin to drive
  inflammation resolution. Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid-derived
  from dietary sources produce the E-series of resolvins and D-series of resolvins,
  maresins, and protectins, respectively, which are important pro-resolving mediators
  in progressing the resolution of inflammation.'
