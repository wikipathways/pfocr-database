caption: Alterations in folate cycle and methionine cycle with gp120 treatment. Folate
  cycle and methionine cycle pathway with metabolites that are upregulated (green)
  and downregulated (red) in LUHMES treated with gp120 compared to control cells.
  Graphs show changes in folate and methionine cycle metabolites, as well as purine
  synthesis pathway metabolites in control and gp120-treated LUHMES. Bar graphs black
  bars are control samples, gray bars are gp120 treated samples (*p < 0.05, **p <
  0.01).
