caption: 'The main regulation modes of NRF2 signalling pathway. The regulation of
  NRF2 signalling pathway mainly includes the following: regulation of calcium ion
  (the overexpression of HO‐1 is caused by the increase of calcium ion concentration,
  and the overexpression of HO‐1 can inhibit the transduction of PI3K/AKT signalling
  pathway), mitochondria oxidative stress (NRF2 is the main transcription factor expressed
  by SIRT3, so the expression of SIRT3 can be enhanced by regulating NRF2 to optimize
  the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells on skin wound healing), ferroptosis
  (NRF2 downstream target genes HO‐1, GCLC, NQO‐1 and SLC7A11, by participating in
  lipid peroxidation), pyroptosis (activate the Nrf2 pathway, promote cell apoptosis
  and inhibit the activation of inflammasome NLRP3), autophagy (arsenite affects the
  expression of Nrf2 and mTOR through the PI3K/AKT pathway, as well as its effect
  on P62 and ATG genes), programmed cell necrosis (the regulatory relationship between
  Nrf2 and receptor‐interacting proteins RIP1 and RIP3) and oxeiptosis (activates
  oxygen free radicals through the KEAP1‐PGAM5‐AIFM1 pathway, independent of caspase)'
