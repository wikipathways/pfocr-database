caption: When oxidative stress increases during exercise, IκBα is phosphorylated,
  and an released activated NF-κB that entered into the nucleus, which increases production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine expression. SFN intervention improves
  exercise performance by reducing reactive oxygen species, inflammatory cytokines,
  and chemokines, as well as inactivated NF-ĸB signaling pathway
