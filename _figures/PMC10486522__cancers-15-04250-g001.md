caption: Leptin and a schematic representation of leptin-induced signaling pathways.
  The binding of leptin to its receptor leads to the formation of the ObR/JAK2 complex,
  which results in phosphorylation (P) and activation of STAT3 and STAT5, which are
  translocated to the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes, including
  the gene for SOCS3. Chronic stimulation leads to an increase in SOCS3, which negatively
  regulates leptin signaling by inhibiting JAK2 activity. JAK2 phosphorylation also
  leads to activation of SHP2, leading to increased MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling and phosphorylation
  of IRS1/2, which recruits PI3K to activate downstream signals. mTOR is an important
  downstream target of PI3K/Akt in the leptin signaling pathway, promoting cell growth
  and survival. In addition, leptin regulates metabolism through AMPK/ACC signaling
  in the brain and peripheral organs. AMPK activation may occur via a STAT3-independent
  signaling pathway. Blocking AMPK activation inhibits the phosphorylation of ACC
  stimulated by leptin. ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; Akt, protein kinase B; AMPK,
