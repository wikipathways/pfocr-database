caption: A model of stomatal closure regulation by crosstalk between ABA, BR, and
  ethylene in Arabidopsis. Endogenous ABA and ethylene accumulate in response to abiotic
  stress. The biosynthesis of ethylene is upregulated by BR but repressed by ABA due
  to the transcriptional regulation of ACS genes. The ABA biosynthesis is upregulated
  by ethylene through MHZ4/5. ABA induces ABI4 transcript levels and the ABI4 protein,
  in turn, represses the transcription of the ACS genes. Ethylene also regulates stomatal
  closure via two ROS-dependent pathways. One pathway is mediated by the ethylene-triggered
  activation of the Gα protein, which in turn promotes H2O2 production by activating
  the NADPH oxidase gene AtRbohF and by inducing NO accumulation via the transcriptional
  upregulation of the nitrate reductase gene NIA1. The increased ROS (H2O2 and NO)
  results in stomatal closure. The second pathway, vice versa, links ethylene with
  reduced ROS levels via EIN2-dependent synthesis of flavonols, secondary metabolites
  that serve as ROS scavengers. Conversely, high levels of ABA signaling lead to elevated
  ROS production and stomatal closure. Positive interactions such as activation, production,
  and stabilization are represented with lines that end in an arrowhead →. Negative
  interactions such as inactivation and repression are represented by lines that end
  in a hammerhead ⊣. The background image of stomata was created with BioRender.
