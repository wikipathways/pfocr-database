caption: 'A proposed model of the impact of elevated levels of circulating IL-6 on
  skeletal muscle redox balance. The reported scheme represents molecular circuits
  involved in the generation and neutralization of reactive species in skeletal muscle.
  Red lines indicate mechanisms that are potentially enhanced by elevated levels of
  circulating IL-6. Grey dot lines represent processes which might be impaired in
  NSE/IL-6 muscle. In the presence of nonphysiologic amounts of serum IL-6, NOX2 expression
  is enhanced in diaphragm muscle, inducing a sustained generation of superoxide (O2−).
  The downmodulation of NQO1 in muscle tissue exposed to increased levels of serum
  IL-6 indicates that the NOX2-derived superoxide might be not efficiently neutralized.
  On the other hand, O2− is converted by SOD into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), whilst
  its further detoxification can be impaired by the reduced expression of CAT. H2O2
  can also be neutralized through the oxidation of glutathione. The reduced expression
  of the rate-limiting enzyme to produce glutathione (GSH), GCL, might reflect an
  impaired activity of the glutathione system. The excess of O2− can also interact
  with nitric oxide (NO) inducing protein modifications. Moreover, the altered regulation
  of the NO signalling pathway might induce a deregulated expression of glucose 6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PD), the enzyme responsible for the production of NADPH, further
  enhancing the activity of the NOX2 complex in a feed-forward circuit. NOX2: NADPH
  oxidase 2; NQO1: NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1; SOD: superoxide dismutase; CAT:
  catalase; GCL: glutamate-cysteine ligase; ONOO−: peroxynitrite; HDAC2: histone deacetylase
  2; GSSG: oxidized glutathione.'
