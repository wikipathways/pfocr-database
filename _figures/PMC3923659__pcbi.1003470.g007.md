caption: 'Two sets are given as the input: template and target. Four consecutive steps
  are executed to produce the output set which is composed of the structures of protein-protein
  complexes predicted to have the lowest binding energies. In this figure, the template
  set contains only one member for visualization simplicity, but it is important to
  note that the default template set of the algorithm is composed of 7922 interface
  members.'
