caption: Summary schematic of the present study. Lycorine increases the expression
  of RBM10. Moreover, RBM10 may increase the expression level of TNF-α, which thereby
  promotes cell apoptosis, and reduce the activation level of Akt signaling pathway,
  which thereby inhibits the occurrence and development of cervical cancer. +, promoting
  expression; -, inhibiting expression. RBM10, RNA binding motif 10; p, phosphate.
