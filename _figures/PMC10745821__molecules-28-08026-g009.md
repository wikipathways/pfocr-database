caption: 'The proposed model of the signaling pathway induced by the CSHE treatment.
  CSHE: hexane extract of Citrus sphaerocarpa; eWAT: epididymal white adipose tissue;
  pAKT: phosphorylated protein kinase B; pAMPK: phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase; pFoxO1: phosphorylated forkhead box protein O1; pACC: phosphorylated
  acetyl-CoA carboxylase; PPARα: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha;
  ACOX1: acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 and palmitoyl; FoxO1: forkhead box protein O1;
  FASN: fatty acid synthase; Acetyl-CoA: acetyl coenzyme A; Malonyl-CoA: Malonyl coenzyme
  A. The red and blue arrows indicate the up- and down-regulation of protein and lipid
  metabolism, respectively. The dotted arrows represent the model estimated from the
  results obtained in this study'
