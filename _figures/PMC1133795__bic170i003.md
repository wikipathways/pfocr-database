caption: The canonical pathway (left) is activated by a large number of agonists,
  a few of which are listed. Activation of this pathway depends on the IKK complex
  (IKK1–IKK2–NEMO), which phosphorylates IκBα to induce its rapid degradation. (IκBβ
  and IκBε are similarly regulated by IKK.) This pathway is essential for immune responses,
  inflammation and promoting cell survival. The alternative NF-κB pathway (right)
  is activated a limited number of agonists and is important for secondary lymphoid
  organogenesis, maturation of B-cells and adaptive humoral immunity. This pathway
  requires NIK and IKK1 and induces the slow processing of p100 to p52, resulting
  in nuclear translocation of p52/RelB heterodimers. The p105 pathway (centre) is
  specifically involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Agonist activation of
  this pathway induces phosphorylation of the p105 PEST region by the classical IKK
  complex. This triggers p105 polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation, releasing
  p50 homodimers which undergo nuclear translocation and positively or negatively
  regulate gene transcription.
