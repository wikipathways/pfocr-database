  description: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes unique

    Human Embryonic Stem Cell Pluripotency was identified as a top canonical pathway
    containing differentially expressed genes unique to wildtype cells. The network
    was generated through the use of ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity Systems,

    activation of cell cycle progression from differentially expressed genes unique
    to wildtype cells during transition from day 0 to day 1 of differentiation (p-value:
