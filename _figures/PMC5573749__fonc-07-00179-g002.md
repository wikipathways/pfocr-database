caption: The selective infection of tumor cells by oncolytic viruses. In the normal
  cell, the response to viral infection involves activation of the type 1 interferon
  (IFN) and protein kinase R (PKR) pathways, resulting in upregulation of eIF2α and
  inhibition of viral protein synthesis. The p53 and Rb pathways are also activated.
  Wild-type viruses are able to inhibit various steps of the antiviral response to
  allow ongoing replication. For example, the herpes simplex virus (HSV) gene ICP34.5
  blocks PKR signaling, and the adenovirus genes E1A and E1B inactivate Rb and p53,
  respectively. The tumor cell may have a number of acquired defects that allow for
  preferential infection by oncolytic viruses. An increased expression of cell surface
  proteins facilitates viral entry, such as herpesvirus entry mediator for HSV type
  1 (HSV-1) and CD46 for measles virus. Defective IFN and PKR pathways lead to unimpeded
  viral protein synthesis. Upregulation of RAS in tumor cells results in PKR pathway
  inhibition. Modification of viruses can further drive tropism and minimize infection
  of normal cells. Deletion of the HSV gene ICP34.5 renders the virus unable to inhibit
  PKR in healthy cells and drives infection toward PKR-deficient tumor cells. Similarly,
  deletion of the adenovirus E1A or E1B genes leads to preferential infection of p53-
  and Rb-deficient tumor cells.
