caption: Autophagy can be targeted at multiple points on its regulatory pathways.
  (1) Activation of mTOR inhibits induction of autophagy, thus mTOR inhibitors are
  strong inducers of autophagy. (2) As the activity of mTOR is regulated by the class
  I PI3K-AKT pathway, the inhibitors of PI3K can stimulate autophagy. (3) EGFR is
  an upstream regulator of the class I PI3K/Akt pathway, so inhibition of EGFR activates
  autophagy through suppressing mTOR. (4) AMPK activates autophagy via suppressing
  mTOR or directly stimulating Ulk1 activity, thus activators of AMPK can induce autophagy.
  (5) The intracellular level of IP3 negatively regulates autophagy via an mTOR-independent
  mechanism; inhibiting this pathway can induce autophagy. (6) The antiapoptotic proteins
  Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL can interact with Beclin 1 through the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain,
  thereby inhibiting Beclin1-dependent autophagy; thus, the small molecule mimetics
  of BH3 can activate autophagy by blocking the interaction between Bcl-2 and Beclin1.
  (7) Class III PI3K is critical for autophagy initiation, so its inhibitors can suppress
  autophagy by blocking the formation of autophagosome. (8) Inhibitors of the lysosomal
  enzymes and lysosomotropic agents that elevate the lysosomal pH can inhibit autophagy
  through blocking fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome and degradation of
  the autolysosome.
