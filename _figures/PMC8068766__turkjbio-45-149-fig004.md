caption: 'Enrichment results of within cell line comparison DEG list (a) DEG scores
  were given for each gene for Day 3 according to the indicated formula and the GSEA
  was performed to find the enriched Hallmark pathways with their enrichment scores,
  (b) the STRING was used to perform pathway analysis and to find the enriched pathways.
  Only top 5 KEGG pathways with the smallest FDR values, and Uniprot annotated keyword
  related to damage was shown for clarity. ES: enrichment score, NOM p-val: nominal
  p value, FDR: false discovery rate.'
