caption: Ca2+ entry is mediated by two independent Ca2+ channels at the PM, a nifedipine-sensitive
  channel (NSC) and TgTRPPL-2. TgTRPPL-2 is a cation-permeable channel that mediates
  Ca2+ entry at the PM by a pathway that is activated by high [Ca2+] and can be inhibited
  by broad transient receptor potential inhibitors like anthranilic acid and benzamil.
  TgA1 is shown as the PM Ca2+ ATPase that pumps Ca2+ outside the cell. TgTRPPL-2
  also localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it may function as a Ca2+
  efflux channel. Increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] can modulate TgTRPPL-2 by allowing
  the channel to open for longer time, thus allowing more Ca2+ to enter the cell.
  Also shown is the IP3-responsive channel in the ER. The molecular identity of this
  channel is not known. Ca2+ activates the phosphatidyl inositol phospholipase C (PLC),
  which is also activated through protein kinase G signaling. PLC synthesizes IP3, which
  stimulates Ca2+ release from the ER.
