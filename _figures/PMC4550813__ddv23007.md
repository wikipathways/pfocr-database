caption: 'Mechanisms that underlie protection of AAV mice against age-related obesity
  and insulin resistance. Several signaling pathways in the livers of AAV mice contribute
  to the beneficial metabolic phenotype. The ChREBP-SCD1-Akt signaling pathway, activated
  by elevated hepatic G6P levels, leads to improved insulin signaling and glucose
  tolerance. The increases in the expression of the MA and GP shuttle systems that
  couple mitochondrial ATP synthesis to the regeneration of NAD+ confer insulin sensitivity
  and resistance to age-related obesity. The activation of the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway
  that leads to increased expression of mitochondrial ETC complexes and protect against
  age-related mitochondrial dysfunction has three components: (i) the increased expression
  of PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis; (ii) PGC-1α activation
  via deacetylation by SIRT1 which is activated by elevated cellular concentrations
  of NAD+ and (iii) PGC-1α activation via phosphorylation by p-AMPK.'
