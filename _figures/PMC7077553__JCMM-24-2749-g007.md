caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the potential effects and underlying mechanisms
  by which cyclin G2 affects DN. The regulation of the pathological progression by
  cyclin G2 in the DN mouse kidney proceeds through the repression of Wnt signalling.
  The interaction of cyclin G2 and Dpr1 affects CK1‐mediated phosphorylation of Dpr1
  at Ser762, causes degradation of Dvl2, inhibits the expression of β‐catenin and
  thereby regulates the activity of the Wnt signalling pathway

  to attenuate tubulointerstitial fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy.
