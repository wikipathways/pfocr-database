caption: 'Alterations in alpha-synuclein function may impact mitochondrial quality
  control pathways. Alpha-synuclein function and its aggregation may have an impact
  at multiple levels during both mitophagy and the mitochondrial-derived vesicle pathway.
  (1) MDV formation: Drp1 and Miro proteins are required for mitochondrial-derived
  vesicle (MDV) fission from the mitochondrion in response to local oxidative damage,
  which may be directly influenced by alterations in alpha-synuclein (α-syn) function.
  Alpha-synuclein oligomers can stabilize Miro on the mitochondrial membrane and modulate
  Drp1 localization, although the precise impact of alpha-synuclein-induced alterations
  in Drp1 function is still a point of contention (indicated in gray). (2) MDV trafficking:
  Oligomeric species of alpha-synuclein may downregulate Parkin expression and alter
  its localization, which could have negative impacts on MDV formation and trafficking
  to the lysosome. (3) Mitophagosome formation: Mitophagy requires the action of PINK1
  and Parkin to trigger the ubiquitylation of outer membrane proteins which leads
  to the recruitment of autophagy receptors, including NDP52 and OPTN, which facilitate
  the capture of damaged mitochondria within a phagophore, which matures into a mitophagosome.
  Alpha-synuclein may impact this process through alterations in Parkin activity and
  by inhibiting the recruitment of Atg9-positive vesicles which are required for autophagosomal
  membrane expansion. (4) Mitophagosome trafficking: Through interactions with spectrin,
  overexpression and accumulation of alpha-synuclein oligomers alters actin cytoskeletal
  dynamics resulting in its aberrant stabilization, which may negatively impact the
  maturation and trafficking of mitophagosomes required for endosomal and lysosomal
  fusion. (5) Lysosomal fusion: To enable cargo degradation, the mitophagosome requires
  the action of SNARE protein complexes to facilitate lysosomal fusion. Pathogenic
  overexpression of alpha-synuclein may alter SNAP29 activity, thus influencing the
  ability of mitophagosomes to fuse with lysosomes. In addition, accumulation of monomeric
  and oligomeric species of alpha-synuclein within lysosomes alters their activity,
  which may result in negative impacts on cargo degradation in both the mitophagy
  and MDV pathways.'
