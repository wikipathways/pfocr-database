caption: '(A) Schematic of a neuron and axonal-dendritic synapse that depict examples
  of cellular localization of the various types of defects in ASD/ID. (B) A signaling
  pathway at the excitatory synapses that couples activity as registered by the release
  of glutamate to local control of protein synthesis. Disruption of the gene products
  indicated in the colored boxes greatly increases the risk of ASD/ID. Syndromic disorders
  with increased prevalence of ASD include Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (SHANK3); Noonan
  syndrome (RAF1, MEK1); Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1); Costello syndrome (H-Ras,
  MEK1); Cowden syndrome (PTEN); Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome (MEK1/2); Tuberous
  sclerosis complex (TSC1/2); Fragile X syndrome (FMRP); Angelman syndrome (AS UBE3a);
  Rett syndrome (RTT–MeCP2); and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS–CREB binding protein,
  p300). Rare, nonsyndromic ASDs include NLGN3/4 and NRXN1; ID/ASD: SHANK2.'
