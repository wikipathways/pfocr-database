caption: Pathways for homocysteine synthesis in E. coli. Homocysteine is needed in
  the cell for de novo synthesis of methionine, and methionine is required for the
  production of the vital metabolic enzyme SAM. SAM is an important methyl donor in
  the cell, involved in the methylation of lipids, proteins, RNA, and DNA. The luxS
  mutant cannot produce homocysteine through SRH hydrolysis, leaving only one pathway
  involving the use of oxaloacetate to generate homocysteine. Oxaloacetate, l-glutamate,
  and the AspC and TyrB transaminases are used to produce aspartate, which can then
  proceed through a series of reactions resulting in the synthesis of homocysteine.
  Exclusive use of this pathway may lead to altered metabolism and amino acid content
  in the luxS mutant, resulting in reduced AI-3 synthesis.
