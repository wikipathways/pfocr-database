caption: Proposed cell fate-tissue shape crosstalk during human implantation development.
  Upon implantation, epiblast cells exit from the naïve pluripotent state and initiate
  the expression of post-implantation factors. Studies in mouse ESCs have shown that
  this is controlled by a decrease in membrane tension, which promotes endocytosis
  and, as a consequence, increased fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling activity,
  which is required for naïve pluripotency exit. Therefore, membrane tension affects
  the pluripotent state of a cell. Whether this pathway is active in human embryos
  remains to be explored. Upon naïve pluripotency exit, genes involved in exocytosis
  become expressed and initiate the process of lumenogenesis to form the amniotic
  cavity. Exocytic vesicles provide apical membrane and luminal proteins, which are
  necessary to build a lumen de novo. The transcription factors involved in this process
  remain to be identified. Question mark denotes a molecular event that has not beem
  validated in human embryos.
