caption: Crossroads of arginine metabolism in the AD brain. NOS oxidatively converts
  arginine into citrulline and NO. Arginase (ARG) hydrolyzes arginine into ornithine
  and urea. Arginine decarboxylase (ADC) produces agmatine and carbon dioxide via
  arginine decarboxylation. Agmatine is utilized in putrescine synthesis via agmatinase
  (AGM), and alternatively, the neurotransmitter GABA is synthesized in the diamine
  oxidase (DAO) pathway. Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) yields citrulline and phosphate.
  These pathways interfere with each other via intricate substrate competition mechanisms.
  For the sake of diagram simplicity, several intermediate steps and byproducts are
  omitted. In the AD brain, overactive arginase competes with NOS and ADC for the
  common substrate and reduces the bioavailability of arginine, which limits the production
  of agmatine and NO, and leads to NOS uncoupling and generation of superoxide anion.
  Overactivation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) leads to a surplus of downstream
  polyamine products, which can be neurotoxic []. Moreover, the gradual oxidation
  of polyamines by polyamine oxidase is associated with the generation of hydrogen
  peroxide and leads to oxidative stress [].
