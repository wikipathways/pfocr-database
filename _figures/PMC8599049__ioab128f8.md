caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed molecular mechanism by which IL6/sIL-6Ralpha
  upregulates the expression of PTGS2 and the production of PGE2 in immortalized hGL
  cells. Treatment with IL6 alone does not lead to homodimerization of gp130 and activation
  of JAK2 tyrosine kinase, whereas the IL6/sIL-6Ralpha complex leads to homodimerization
  of gp130 on the cell surface, which subsequently transduces a signal that activates
  intracytoplasmic JAK2. However, the AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways are not activated
  by IL6/sIL-6Ralpha. JAK tyrosine kinase preferentially induces tyrosine phosphorylation
  of STAT3, which translocates to the nucleus and subsequently leads to the stimulation
  of PTGS2 expression and an increase in PGE2 production in hGL cells. Furthermore,
  as the negative feedback inhibitor of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, SOCS3 is
  induced by the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which suppresses the phosphorylation
  of STAT3 and subsequently affects the expression of PTGS2 and production of PGE2
  in hGL cells. gp130, glycoprotein 130; PTGS2, cyclooxygenase enzyme 2.
