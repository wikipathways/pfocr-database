caption: 'The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and its dependent processes. Glucose
  and acetyl-CoA are consumed in the biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, which is directly
  required for the formation of chitin and for the glycosylation of various proteins
  and lipids. Mutations in genes encoding hexosamine biosynthetic pathway enzymes
  and in some UDP-GlcNAc requiring processes have been described in flies and in mice.
  The loss of function phenotypes are indicated by color: blue, early lethal; green,
  failure in FGFR signaling-dependent cell migrations; red, defective tracheal tubulogenesis;
  gray, no embryonic defect described, but later defect in homeotic gene expression.
  The phenotype of nst reported here is for the combined loss of maternal and zygotic
  nst gene products, while the phenotype of the other genes is for loss of of zygotic
  gene products alone. GFAT, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase.'
