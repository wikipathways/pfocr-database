caption: Flowchart of the individual-level pathway score (iPS) approach. (a) For a
  group of  normal samples, compute the correlations, i.e., the  (the Pearson correlation
  coefficient () of an edge in each pathway with n samples) of each edge in the pathway
  based on expression data. Then, a new individual sample d is added to the group,
  and the new correlation of each edge in the pathways is calculated in the same way
  by the  of the combined data. (b) The pathway-based differential correlation is
  calculated by the difference of the corresponding edge in terms of , i.e.,  =  −  for
  each edge. The sum of all edges, the  value, is obtained for each pathway. (c) iPS
  is defined as an individual pathway-based score that can quantify the correlation
  perturbation of each pathway in each sample. Finally, analyses of distribution,
  classification, survival, and prognosis are performed.
