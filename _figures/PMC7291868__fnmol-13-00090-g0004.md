caption: Common neuroinflammatory pathways in different neurological diseases regulated
  by miR-146a. The common genes [interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1),
  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), complement factor H
  (CFH)] and related pathways [Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway and complement
  activation pathway] regulated by miR-146a are involved in the neuroinflammatory
  response in different neurological diseases.
