caption: Mechanism of free fatty acids-induced endothelial dysfunction. Increased
  levels of free fatty acids reduce nitric oxide production directly or indirectly
  by mediating oxidative stress (ROS upregulation), upregulation of inflammatory signaling
  (NF-κB upregulation), and downregulation of insulin and calcium signaling. In addition,
  RAS activation by free fatty acids or oxidation of LDL can lead to vasoconstriction
  by ET-1 upregulation. Even apoptotic pathway activation by free fatty acids induces
  endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells apoptosis. Endothelial dysfunction
  ultimately leads to atherosclerosis events, coronary artery disease, hypertension,
  heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, and end-stage renal disease
