caption: Status of different compartments in T2DM. In case of T2DM, the enzymes of
  the de novo ceramide synthesis, sphingomyelinase (SMPD), and ceramide kinase (CERK)
  genes are upregulated (⚫). CERT gene which is responsible for the transport of ceramide
  from ER to Golgi complex is downregulated (x). Consequently, this scenario might
  result in increased ER stress, insulin resistance, and inflammation, all of which
  are key pathologies associated with T2DM.
