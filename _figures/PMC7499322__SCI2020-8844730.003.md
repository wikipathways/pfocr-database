caption: Inhibitory roles of MSC-derived exosomes in tumors. MSC-derived exosomes
  suppress angiogenesis and promote dormancy of breast cancer by shuttling miR-100,
  miR-16, miR-23b, and miR-222/223. MSC-derived exosomes suppress cell migration,
  invasion, and progression by shuttling miR-143 and miR-145. MSC-derived exosomes
  induce bladder cancer cell apoptosis and necrosis by transporting PLK-1 siRNA and
  inhibit osteosarcoma cell migration by shuttling miR-143. MSC-derived exosomes render
  hepatocellular carcinoma cells sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents through delivery
  of miR-122. MSC-derived exosomes enhance human leukemia cell imatinib-induced apoptosis
  through the caspase pathway. MSC-derived exosomes hinder the progression of glioblastoma
  and the progression and metastasis of glioma stem cells by transporting miR-124,
  miR-145, anti-miR-9, and miR-146b. MSC-derived exosomes inhibit pancreatic cancer
  activity and suppress glioma progression by shuttling miR-1231 and miR-133b. MSC-derived
  exosomes reduce breast cancer cell viability and the ablation of HeLa cells by transporting
  PTX and iron oxide.
