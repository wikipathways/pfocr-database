caption: Simplified schematic of the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway in the attention
  deficit hyperactivity disorder, its interaction with methylphenidate, and possible
  effects on memory and attention. The symbol − means inhibition, reduction, or attenuation.
  The symbol + means activation or enhancement. For more details see the text. ADMA,
  Asymmetric dimethylarginine; Arg, Arginine; DDAH, Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase;
  DMA, Dimethylamine; L-Cit, L-Citrulline; NO, Nitric Oxide; nNOS, Neuronal nitric
  oxide synthase; PRMT, Protein arginine methyltransferase; SDMA, Symmetric dimethylarginine
