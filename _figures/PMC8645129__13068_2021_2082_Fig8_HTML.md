caption: 'The potential mechanism contributing to the efficient xylose utilization
  of the adapted strain 8b-S38. Three mutations identified in strain 8b-S38 compared
  with the parental strain 8b (a); up-regulation of central carbon metabolism and
  down-regulation of xylitol production leading to more xylose metabolized via xylose
  isomerase (XI) pathway (b); up-regulation of protein and DNA repair system to deal
  with the damage caused by xylose stress (c); the phage shock protein response triggered
  to prevent proton leakage thus to maintain the proton-motive force (PMF) and membrane
  permeability (d); up-regulation of the protein synthesis process contributing to
  the cell growth (e); differentially expressed genes related to several transcriptional
  regulators (f). The red up or blue down arrow beside the enzyme represents up-regulation
  and down-regulation, respectively. The details of gene expression are shown in the
  Additional file : Table S8'
