caption: Biotic stress-related signalling pathways associated with acyl-CoA-binding
  proteins (ACBPs) in plants. Upon pathogen infection, the overexpression of Class
  III AtACBP3 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana led to constitutive activation of
  pathogenesis-related (PR) genes including PR1, PR2 and PR5, elevated H2O2 production
  and eventually cell death []. AtACBP3 plays a distinct role in the plant defence
  response against necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens as transgenic Arabidopsis
  AtACBP3-overexpressors (OEs) were protected against the biotrophic pathogen (Pseudomonas
  syringae pv tomato DC3000) but not the necrotrophic pathogen (Botrytis cinerea)
  []. In wild-type Arabidopsis, the expression of Class IV AtACBP4 and AtEBP encoding
  a protein interactor of AtACBP4 were reported to be induced by B. cinerea infection,
  and ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and methyl jasmonate
  (MeJA) treatments, suggesting that AtACBP4 and AtEBP are mediated by ethylene and/or
  JA signalling []. Rice Class III OsACBP5 protects transgenic Arabidopsis and rice
  plants against hemibiotrophs and biotrophs via NPR1-dependent SA signalling, and
  necrotrophs by JA signalling [,]. The OsACBP5 5′-flanking region contains W-boxes
  which were verified in pathogen-responsiveness of OsACBP5 []. Proteomic studies
  showed that eleven biotic stress-related proteins were upregulated by Rhizoctonia
  solani infection in transgenic Arabidopsis OsACBP5-OEs []. Grape Class III VvACBP
  conferred resistance to P. syringae and Colletotrichum higginsianum in transgenic
  Arabidopsis, possibly through the NPR1-mediated pathway following induction of PDF1.2,
  the gene encoding plant defensin []. Orange boxes represent the named ACBPs involved
  in the pathogen response. White boxes indicate the molecular events that occur along
  the signalling pathway. Black arrows denote the flow of signalling events. ACBP,
  acyl-CoA-binding protein; EBP, ETHYLENE-RESPONSIVE BINDING PROTEIN; JA, jasmonic
  acid; NPR1, NONEXPRESSOR OF PR-1; PR, pathogenesis-related; SA, salicylic acid.
