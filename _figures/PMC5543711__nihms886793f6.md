caption: (A) The protocols currently used to prime and expand anti-tumor T cells in
  vitro can lead to the generation of terminally differentiated effector cells that
  are unable to mount a robust response in vivo at the tumor site. However, (B) alterations
  to in vitro expansion protocols that maintain anti-tumor T cells in a state of reduced
  differentiation may allow for the generation of T cells that have increased fitness
  to engage in a sustained immune response against tumors in vivo. Adjustments to
  culturing conditions that have been shown to achieve this in pre-clinical settings
  include the limitation of anabolic growth pathways including glycolysis, mitochondrial
  activity and mTORC1 signaling with the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose or the
  mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Additional interventions include the pharmacological
  inhibition of Akt activity, the promotion of mitochondrial fusion, and the activation
  of alternative signaling cascades such as the Wnt pathway that act to maintain T
  cells in a state of reduced differentiation.
