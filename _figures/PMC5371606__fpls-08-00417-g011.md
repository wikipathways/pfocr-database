caption: Scheme describing potential roles of AOX and COX metabolism in arbuscular
  mycorrhizal fungi. This scheme was drawn according to the fungal phenotype observed
  with SHAM and KCN treatments under in vitro and ex vitro assays. Compared to untreated
  plants and KCN treatment, SHAM decreases arbuscule intensity within mycorrhizal
  root fragment (a %), with predominance of Paris–type development, while vesicles
  intensity remains similar to non-treated plants. Compared to SHAM, KCN plants harbored
  reduced vesicle within root fragment (v %) and hyphal density (H %), but higher
  arbuscule formation in mycorrhizal root fragments (a %). Note that the inhibitors
  response on fungal parameters may differ according to specific P concentration.
  Spore germination is inhibited by ABA, SHAM, and KCN but enhanced by Ga3. We propose
  that spore germination corresponds likely to a punctual event involving respiratory
  shift that transfers a dormant state (likely linked with AOX pathway) to an active
  state (likely linked with COX pathway) allowing the fungus to explore and reach
  a host plant root (see text in section, Mitochondrial Respiratory Inhibitors Influence
  Fungal Behavior at Pre-symbiotic Phase). However, the respiratory chain pathway
  involved in spore formation and size, hyphal diameter, as well as the filling of
  storage organs and active cytoplasmic flow in AMF remains unknown. We suggest that
  COX metabolism might be preferentially expressed in these different processes that
  require energy (suggestions are written in purple).
