caption: Modulation of Immune Checkpoints and Gut Microbiota by Traditional Chinese
  Medicine Formulations. A The regulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway by different TCM
  formulations. Qiyusanlong decoction and PAMR (Polysaccharide of Atractylodis Macrocephalae
  Rhizoma) influence PD-1/PD-L1 interactions indirectly through the modulation of
  miR-34a, which plays a role in the ubiquitination (Ub) of PD-L1, reducing its expression.
  Berberine (BBR) is also shown to engage in this pathway, suggesting a mechanism
  by which these TCM agents might enhance immune response against tumors by reducing
  immune checkpoint activity. B The effects of Chang Wei Qing (CWQ) and Gegen Qinlian
  Decoction (GQD) on the gut microbiota and their subsequent impact on CD8+ T cell
  modulation. CWQ is associated with shifting the gut microbiota towards a composition
  rich in Akkermansia, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, known to enhance immune responses.
  GQD modifies the gut microbiota by increasing levels of Bacteroides, Akkermansia,
  and Prevotella, while decreasing Megamonas and Veillonella, thereby potentially
  enhancing CD8+ T cell function and the overall anti-tumor immune response. These
  changes in microbiota composition are critical for the modulation of systemic immune
  responses, particularly in enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapies
