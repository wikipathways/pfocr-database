caption: The biodegradation network reconstruction was performed as described in .
  Briefly, predicted open reading frames (ORFs) in the DNA or 16S rRNA-derived meta-sequences
  were filtered by score (>45) and e-value (<10e−3) according to their similarity
  to the sequences of key aromatic catabolic gene families involved in the degradation
  of aromatic pollutants and alkanes. After a manual check, a final list of gene sequences
  encoding enzymes potentially involved in degradation was prepared. For network reconstruction,
  each sequence was assigned to a metabolic substrate and a product with an assigned
  code, and the putative substrates and products processed in the sample were connected,
  creating a metabolic network using appropriate scripts and commands (for details,
  see ). The rel. ab. of each catabolic gene assigned to degradation reactions, as
  represented by the thickness of the lines in the figure, and the complete list of
  substrates possibly degraded by the communities are summarized in . Confidence greater
  than 90% as indicated in . Note that rel. ab. refers to the total number of genes
  in a given sample to avoid artifacts due to differences in sample size. The codes
  for the chemical species in each pathway are as described in  and .
