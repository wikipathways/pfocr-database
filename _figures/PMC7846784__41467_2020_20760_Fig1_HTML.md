caption: 'Systemic signals such as HMGB1, HGFA, and the environmental pollutant TCDD
  (commonly known as dioxin) promote Galert features in MuSCs through mTORC1 signaling.
  The Notch signaling pathway, critical for the maintenance of the quiescent state
  of MuSCs, was recently described to block proliferation and activation through KLF7-p21
  and miRNA-708-Notch-migration axes, respectively. Finally, PTPN11/MAPK signals and
  cytosolic p57 are compatible with proliferation and activation of MuSCs. Color code:
  blue, receptor; beige, protein; purple, pathway.'
