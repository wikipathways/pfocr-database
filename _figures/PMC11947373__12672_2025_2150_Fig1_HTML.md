caption: 'COVID-19-induced molecular mechanisms that propel OSCC development and chemoresistance.
  The NRP-1/ACE2 receptor allows SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cell [143, 144]. This
  leads to the infection causing hypoxia. Eventually, the infection activates HIF-1α,
  which increases the expression of NRP-1, CD147, and CypA due to the effect on EMT,
  OSCC progression, and chemoresistance. NRP-1 pathway: NF-κB/IkBa/p65 signaling is
  activated when the SARS-CoV-2 binds to NRP-1. P2X7 receptor activation (P2X7R) activates
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling cascade. Furthermore, it results in the creation
  of the NLRP3 complex and the activation of caspase I and the inflammasome, which
  induces inflammation. When cancer cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 express more GLUT1,3
  on their surface, HIF-1α promotes glycolysis and lactate generation. When SARS-CoV-2
  induces hypoxic conditions, it stimulates the AMPK/Pox/Ros signaling pathway, which
  in turn induces autophagy and ultimately leads to OSCC development, recurrence,
  and chemoresistance. Elevating the rate of glycolysis and lactate generation initiates
  the signaling pathways of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and HIF-α activationSARS-CoV-2 binding to
  CD147 activates two signaling pathways: MLL/P38/MAPK, FAK/PI3K/MMP, and Raf/Ras/MEK/ERK1.
  Through BECN1, ORF8 initiates the autophagy process. When lysosomes are added to
  the phagophore, the autophagy mechanism is activated via double-membrane vesicles
  (DMVs), which shield the viral RNA. Under the influence of ulk1, ATG16L1, and ptdlns3k,
  lysosomes transform into autophagosomes, and autolysosome formation results from
  this process. All of these signaling pathways therefore contribute to the development
  of OSCC and chemoresistance'
