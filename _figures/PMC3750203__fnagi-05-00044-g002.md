caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the proposed mechanisms of copper transport
  across the blood brain barrier (BBB) and blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCB).
  (A) Copper transport under physiological conditions. Copper import into cells is
  via the major copper import protein CTR1. The proposed locations and orientation
  of ATP7A and ATP7B are shown. ATP7A is expressed in cerebrovascular endothelial
  cells that form the BBB but its expression is 3.4-fold higher in the choroid plexus
  than in the cerebral capillaries. In both choroid plexus epithelial cells and capillary
  endothelial cells of the brain, ATP7A predominantly localizes to the basolateral
  membrane. ATP7A facilitates copper transport from the blood across the BBB to the
  brain parenchyma. At the choroid plexus, ATP7A facilitates the removal of excess
  copper from the brain into the blood. Therefore, the BCB serves as the main pathway
  for eliminating excess brain copper. In contrast, ATP7B is concentrated at the apical
  membrane. At the CSF-facing apical membrane of choroid plexus epithelial cells,
  ATP7B may contribute to copper transport into the CSF and copper sequestration in
  the choroid plexus. Astrocytes are the first brain parenchyma cells to encounter
  metal ions that cross the BBB and play an important role in copper transport from
  the blood and CSF toward neurons. Copper transport in glutamatergic neurons is depicted.
  Copper-independent and reversible trafficking of ATP7A is stimulated by N-methyl-D-aspartate
  receptor (NMDAR) activation that leads to Ca2+ influx and is associated with the
  rapid release of copper from neurons. The released copper down-regulates NMDAR activity
  thus protecting neurons from excitotoxicity. (B) Perturbed copper transport in Menkes
  disease due to the absence or inactivation of ATP7A. The predicted consequences
  of ATP7A inactivation in relation to copper levels in brain barrier cells, astrocytes
  and neurons are shown. Any copper that reaches the BBB accumulates within endothelial
  cells leading to reduced copper transport to the brain parenchyma, astrocytes and
  neurons. Any copper that reaches astrocytes also will accumulate. There is reduced
  copper transport across the BCB. Excitotoxicity due to impaired synaptic copper
  release from glutamatergic neurons, which down-regulates NMDAR activity, can contribute
  to seizures and neuronal degeneration in Menkes disease.
