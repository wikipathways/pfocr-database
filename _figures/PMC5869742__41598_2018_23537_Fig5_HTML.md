caption: Involvement of proteins found in the yolk sac fluid and the uterine fluid
  of pregnant mares in GO terms and pathways representing embryo-maternal interaction.
  All GO terms and pathways that include ‘cytokine’ or ‘growth factor’ in their description
  were selected, together with all identified proteins in either the yolk sac or uterine
  fluid belonging to these GO terms or pathways. These GO terms, pathways and proteins
  were then visualized using Cytoscape 3.3.0. Proteins found only in the uterine fluid
  are represented as red circles, proteins found only in the yolk sac as yellow circles
  and proteins found in both as purple circles. Proteins significantly (FDR corrected
  p-value < 0.05) up- or downregulated in the uterine fluid of pregnant mares are
  respectively larger and smaller circles (size not scaled with magnitude of up- or
  downregulation). GO terms and pathways are represented as a blue ‘V’, with lines
  indicating whether a GO term or pathway is associated with a protein.
