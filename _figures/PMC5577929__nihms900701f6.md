caption: 'Model of HIM-6 in C. elegans meiotic recombination. A: HIM-6 can disassemble
  D-loops to regenerate 3′ resected end intermediates. If the D-loop underwent synthesis,
  HIM-6 can unwind the intermediate to generate a noncrossover via SDSA. B: Crossover-designated
  intermediates are resolved into crossovers through one of two parallel pathways:
  the HIM-6–XPF-1 pathway and the MUS-81–SLX‐1 pathway. C: Speculative mechanism of
  HIM-6 facilitating biased resolution of recombination intermediates: Two HIM-6 molecules
  unwind an unstable ligated intermediate, forming a structure available for a dimer
  of XPF-1 to cut and resolve into a crossover.'
