caption: LH and PH4 are critical enzymes for collagen hydroxylation during collagen
  maturation. The reactions require iron and ascorbate as cofactors. In this figure,
  ZIP13 is proposed as the iron exporter localized on the ER/Golgi and responsible
  for iron transporting from the cytosol into the secretory pathway. These iron ions
  will be utilized by proteins such as ferritin (in the fly and likely some other
  insects with secretion type of ferritin) and LH.
