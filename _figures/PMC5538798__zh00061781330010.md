caption: 'A schematic diagram summarized as a possible mechanism of action of melamine
  causing tubular cell injury via CSR-mediated Ca2+signaling pathway. Melamine activates
  CSR and generates a PLC-β-mediated Ca2+ entry, leading to a rise in [Ca2+]i, causing
  sustained Ca2+ entry, which could be attributable to an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  store depletion. Such prolonged elevation in [Ca2+]i can in turn produce an ER stress
  response, subsequently induce ROS generation, which further can initiate the downstream
  DNA damage, resulting in apoptotic and necrotic cell death, leading to tubular cell
  injury. Melamine-induced CSR activation leads to ROS generation that subsequently
  activates(AKI the following pathways to mediate tubular cell death: 1) activation
  of mitochondrial proapoptotic (BAX/BCL-2) pathway, 2) expression of TGF-β1, promoting
  fibronectin production, 3) cytotoxicity resulting in necrosis, and 4) caspase activation
  via pERK1/2.'
