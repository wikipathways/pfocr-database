caption: '(A) The canonical DSB repair model. A break on the D chromosome or the A
  chromosome () leads to resection, strand invasion, and second end capture. This
  intermediate may mature into a fully ligated double Holliday junction (dHJ), or
  may be acted on by resolvases with nicks still present (dashed pathway). Single-strand
  cleavage at the four (ligated dHJ) or two (unligated dHJ) filled arrowheads will
  yield crossover pattern #1, while cleavage at the four open arrowheads will yield
  crossover pattern #2. The downward arrows and vertical black lines indicate the
  DSB position. Below these products are schematic representations of crossovers with
  mixed tracts indicated by purple brackets and complex tracts indicated by green
  brackets. Below this is the pattern that would be expected in wild type after mismatch
  correction. (B) D-loop migration model to account for abundance of simple crossovers.
  Initial strand invasion from each end is shown separately, yielding different crossover
  products. After strand exchange, repair synthesis and strand unwinding causes co-directional
  D-loop migration, so that the D-loop ends up on one side of the break. Subsequent
  second-end capture by the D-loop creates a new heteroduplex tract, and resolution
  of the double-Holliday junction by configuration #1 will produce one simple crossover
  product and one with a heteroduplex DNA tract. With frequent breaks on the D chromosome
  at the A3 hotspot, this simple model can produce crossovers with the patterns we
  observe, namely, many simple crossovers, D-to-A crossovers with a mixed tract to
  the left of the hotspot, and A-to-D crossovers with a mixed tract to the right.
  (C) Alterations to the model presented in (B) that shift the simple crossover exchanges
  away from the hotspot center. (i) Strand exchange at an interstitial position of
  the DMC1/RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, followed by cleavage of the distal 3’ ssDNA
  end. Repair synthesis proceeds from the clipped end, causing the exchange in the
  simple crossover product to be shifted away from the hotspot center. (ii) The repair
  DNA polymerase can detect mismatches at the 3’ end of the invaded strand, which
  will ultimately cause the exchange to be modestly shifted away from the center in
  the resulting simple crossover. The crossover with heteroduplex DNA has an exchange
  point defined by the 3’ end of the non-invading broken strand, or, by the position/length
  of the D-loop prior to resolution.'
