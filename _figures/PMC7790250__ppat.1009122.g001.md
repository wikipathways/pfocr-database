caption: Both increased lactate production and impaired lactate clearance play a role
  in the pathogenesis of lactic acidosis. The increased lactate production might have
  several origins. Intraerythrocytic parasites rely on glycolysis to meet their energy
  requirements and produce lactate. Parasite sequestration may lead to blood vessel
  obstruction and induction of hypoxia in the surrounding tissues and cells, which
  results in increased anaerobic glycolysis. Destruction of uninfected RBCs and iRBCs
  causes anemia in malaria and decreases the oxygen delivery by the blood. This causes
  systemic hypoxia and increased anaerobic glycolysis. Malaria infection is characterized
  by a strong immune response with activated immune cells, which switch to aerobic
  glycolysis to rapidly generate ATP and metabolic intermediates for proliferation.
  Under all of these circumstances, glycolysis and thus the conversion of glucose
  into pyruvate increases. Pyruvate is further converted to lactate by LDHA, and lactate
  is excreted via an MCT into the circulation, which results in elevated blood lactate
  levels. Lactate is cleared from the circulation by uptake by gluconeogenic cells
  in the liver and renal cortex via MCTs. Lactate is subsequently converted to pyruvate
  by LDHB, and further converted to glucose via the gluconeogenic pathway. Glucose
  is excreted in the circulation via GLUT transporters and can be used again in the
  cells and tissues with increased glycolysis. This internal recycling of lactate
  produced by glycolytic cells and its conversion back to glucose by gluconeogenesis
  in the liver and kidney is known as the Cori cycle. In malaria, lactate clearance
  might be decreased due to liver dysfunction, decreased hepatic blood flow, and suppressed
  gluconeogenesis. In addition, AKI in malaria is associated with necrosis of gluconeogenic
  cells in the renal cortex and decreased urine excretion, which can both contribute
  to impaired lactate clearance. Therefore, both liver and kidney pathology can contribute
  to hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis in malaria. AKI, acute kidney injury; DC,
  dendritic cell; GLUT, glucose transporter; iRBC, infected red blood cell; LDH, lactate
  dehydrogenase; M1, M1 macrophage; MCT, monocarboxylic acid transporter; RBC, red
