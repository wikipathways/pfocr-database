caption: 'Activation mechanism for the complement system in Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated
  herpesvirus (KSHV)-infected cells. (A) The mechanisms for complement activation
  in latently KSHV-infected cells. Complement regulatory proteins are downregulated
  in latently KSHV-infected cells, which induce the alternative complement pathway.
  (B) The mechanisms for complement activation in de novo KSHV infection. In de novo
  infection of human endothelial cells, the complement regulatory factors are not
  suppressed. Extracellular vesicles from KSHV-infected cells serve as triggering
  factors for the deposition of endogenously produced properdin and C3 on the cell
  surface, which activate the alternative pathway. MAC: membrane attack complex.'
