caption: Insulin receptor signaling pathways. The insulin receptor is a heterotetramer
  consisting of two α, β dimers linked by disulfide bonds. The α-subunit contains
  the ligand binding domain, and the β-subunit contains a ligand-activated tyrosine
  kinase. Tyrosine autophosphorylation increases the receptor's intrinsic tyrosine
  kinase activity, whereas serine phosphorylation inhibits it. The tyrosine-phosphorylated
  insulin receptor phosphorylates intracellular substrates, such as IRS 1–4, Shc,
  and APS, initiating signal transduction pathways mediating the pleiotropic actions
  of insulin. The major pathway for the metabolic actions of insulin is mediated through
  activation of PI3-K and Akt/PKB, resulting in the translocation for the insulin
  responsive glucose transporter, GLUT4, from intracellular vesicles to the plasma
  membrane. Insulin activation of PI3-K and Akt/PKB also leads to serine phosphorylation
  of GSK3, resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity. The inhibition of GSK3
  results in dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase increasing glycogen synthesis.
  The Ras-ERK/MAPK pathway regulates gene expression. Insulin modulates protein synthesis
  and degradation via mTOR, which is activated via PI3-K and Akt/PKB. The mTOR pathway
  is also important in nutrient sensing. Insulin-stimulated inhibition of GSK3 via
  PI3-K and Akt/PKB also results in dephosphorylation of eIF2B increasing protein
  synthesis. Insulin signaling can be terminated by dephosphorylation of the receptor
  by tyrosine phosphatases, such as PTP1B, or dephosphorylation of PI3-K by PTEN.
  Serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRSs can also decrease insulin
  signaling and may be mediated by serine kinases in the insulin signaling pathway
  providing a feedback mechanism to terminate insulin action. There is a post-binding
  defect in insulin signaling in PCOS affecting metabolic but not mitogenic pathways
  (see  for details). The signaling steps that are compromised in PCOS are circled
  with a dotted line. Signaling steps downstream of these abnormalities may also be
  compromised. SOS, Son-of-sevenless. This figure is used with the permission of Andrea
