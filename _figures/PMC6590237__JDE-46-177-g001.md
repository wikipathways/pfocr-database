caption: Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons branch out to the skin with transient
  receptor potential channel vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)/transient receptor potential channel
  ankyrin transmembrane protein 1 (TRPA1) and other receptors expressing. Some of
  the itch‐related inflammatory mediators act on receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) such
  as cytokines and nerve growth factor (NGF). The others act on G protein‐coupled
  receptors (GPCR) such as proteases, histamine, serotonin, bradykinin and prostaglandin
  E2. Following the activation of their own receptors, the intracellular pathway can
  lead to the sensitization of TRPV1 or TRPA1. GPCR/RTK expressed mostly in the neurons
  of nociception, phospholipase C (PLC), plays an important role in connecting GPCR/RTK
  and intracellular signaling. The activation of PLC hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate
  (PIP2) into inositol‐1,4,5‐triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Subsequently,
  PIP2 and DAG activate PKC which lead to the activation of TRPV1 and TRPA1. Finally,
  the opening of these two channels increases the concentration of cellular calcium.
