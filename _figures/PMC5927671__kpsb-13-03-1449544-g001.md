caption: Core Photorespiration Pathway and the Putative Photorespiration Glycolaldehyde
  Shunt. (A), Black arrows depict the flow of reactions constituting the core photorespiration
  pathway. Red arrows present the putative photorespiration glycolaldehyde shunt.
  The cellular compartments are shown in blue (peroxisome), green (chloroplast) and
  violet (mitochondria). The enzymes are presented in brown and are RUBISCO, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
  (RuBP) carboxylase/oxygenase; PGP, 2-phosphoglycolate phosphatase; GO, glycolate
  oxidase; GGAT, glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase; GDC, glycine decarboxylase;
  SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; SGAT, serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase;
  HPR1, peroxisomal hydroxypyruvate reductase; HPR2, cytosolic hydroxypyruvate reductase;
  ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase; GLYK, glycerate 3-kinase; GOGAT, ferredoxin (Fd)-dependent
  glutamate synthase; GS, glutamine synthetase. (B), The two general metabolic equations
  derived from the core photorespiration and the putative photorespiration glycolaldehyde
  shunt. The equations were obtained by assuming that the total hydroxypyruvate pool
  is either reduced to glycerate (for the core photorespiration) or decarboxylated
  to glycolaldehyde (for the glycolaldehyde shunt).
