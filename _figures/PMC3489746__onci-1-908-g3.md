caption: Figure 3. Post-translational regulation of MHC Class II trafficking. From
  the cell surface, the mature peptide-MHC Class II complexes are endocytosed and
  recycle back to the surface. In the presence of interleukin-10 (IL-10), MARCH1 is
  upregulated. MARCH1 and MHC Class II molecules interact in recycling endosomes and
  the MARCH1-mediated ubiquitination of MHC Class II prevents recycling. MHC Class
  II molecules are redirected to lysosomal compartments where they are degraded.
