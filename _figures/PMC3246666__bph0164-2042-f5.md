caption: Putative mechanism for Sal B-mediated suppression of h-monDC maturation induced
  by ox-LDL. h-monDC maturation was stimulated by ox-LDL through TLR4/MyD88-mediated
  p38–MAPK signalling pathway. This signal cascade could be suppressed by Sal B through
  up-regulating nuclear translocation and increased transcriptional activity of PPARγ
  and subsequently down-regulating of TLR4/MyD88-mediated p38–MAPK pathway.
