caption: Model showing the proposed dual role of Ipl1p in promoting chromosome biorientation
  and checkpoint activation in response to mono-oriented chromosomes. The activation
  of the checkpoint machinery by lack of tension is shown as a direct response mediated
  through Mad3p phosphorylation by Ipl1p that is separate from the pathway that activates
  the checkpoint in response to unattached kinetochores, as supported by the properties
  of the Mad3p phosphorylation site mutants described in this study.

  response to lack of tension at kinetochores.
