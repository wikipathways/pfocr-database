caption: TRAIL-mediated extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Mediated through the binding
  of TRAIL to its cognate receptor, upon binding the receptors oligomerize within
  the membrane. Fas associated death domain (FADD) is recruited, followed by pro-caspase-8
  which is then processed into its active p18 and p10 subunits which then can oligomerize
  into a heterotetramer
