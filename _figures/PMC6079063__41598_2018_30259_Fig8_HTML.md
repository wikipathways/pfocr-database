caption: Schematic representation of the effect of chitin on antigen-specific Th2
  cell-mediated murine asthma. Intranasal administration of chitin induced IL-33 in
  the lungs, and IL-1β produced by DCs in response to that IL-33 promotes Th2 cell
  activation, resulting in aggravation of OVA-induced type 2-cytokine-mediated allergic
  airway eosinophilia that is dependent on an IL-4/IL-13-STAT6 pathway.
