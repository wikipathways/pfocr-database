caption: Outline of the catalytic cycles of oxidoreductases. (A) Hydroxylation of
  substrates of aromatase requires the activation of oxygen. This activation is promoted
  by the heme prosthetic porphyrin ring system. An electron transfer reduces the ferric
  to the ferrous intermediate state, which enables iron to bind dioxygen. Another
  electron transfer induces a rearrangement of the highly electron-dense π-system
  and cleavage of the O-O bond. One of the oxygens is protonated and liberated as
  water. The remaining oxygen is configured as ferryl intermediate which extracts
  a hydrogen atom from the substrate. A transient radical of the substrate thus formed
  captures the OH group from the enzyme intermediate to end up as hydroxylated substrate.

  H2O2 metabolism. I− reacts with compound I by direct 2e− transfer. The normal peroxidatic
  cycle includes ferric lactoperoxidase -> compound I -> compound II -> ferric lactoperoxidase.
  H2O2 in excess leads to formation of compound III and reconversion to the resting
  enzyme via the ferrous state. Compound III pathway is combined with irreversible
  inactivation of the enzyme. The conceivable structures of the heme moieties of lactoperoxidase's
  ground state and intermediate enzymatic compounds show a movement of iron out of
  plane (not depicted) (, ).
