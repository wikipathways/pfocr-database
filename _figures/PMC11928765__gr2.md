caption: Epithelial growth factor receptors (TGFBR/EGFR/KGFR) cellular signaling and
  their regulation by 16E5. TGFBR canonical signaling starts with the activation of
  TGFBR2 by ligand binding (TGFβ). Next, the receptor recruits TGFBR1, and once activated
  it recruits the SMAD proteins 2/3. These proteins then recruit SMAD4 and form the
  SMAD protein complex (SMAD2/3/4) that initiates nuclear translocation. In turn,
  SMAD7/SMURF2 downregulate this signaling by the degradation of the SMAD2/3 complex.
  Likewise, TGFBR non-canonical signaling includes the activation of PI3K/AKT (1)
  and MAPK (2) pathways. EGFR/KGFR signalings start with their activation by ligand
  binding, for instance, EGF and KGF, respectively. Next, they can activate several
  pathways such as PI3K/AKT (1), MAPK (2), PLCγ/PKC (3), or STAT3 (4). These overall
  pathways result in the stimulation of their target genes in the nucleus that leads
  to the regulation of cell growth and proliferation (EGFR, TGFBR), cell differentiation
  (EGFR, KGFR), and EMT (TGFBR, FGFR2c). During the HPV life cycle, 16E5 downregulates
  TGFBR2, and therefore, the TGFβ signaling pathway. The oncoprotein may also upregulate
  EGFR by inhibiting both c-Cbl and v-ATPase, and therefore, preventing its degradation
  and endocytic traffic, respectively. This EGFR enhancement by 16E5 might result
  in the upregulation of Met, another growth factor receptor, and the inhibition of
  p27. Alternatively, 16E5 may downregulate KGFR and promote the expression of the
  variant FGFR2c as a result of FGFR2 splicing by ESRP1/2. 16E5 might also inhibit
  this receptor by downregulating PI3K/AKT pathways and upregulating p63; p63 upregulation
  might also be accomplished by the 16E5 inhibition of miR-203. In addition, 16E5
  might downregulate p53 and p21. 16E5 might also downregulate miR-196a, leading to
  cell growth and proliferation
