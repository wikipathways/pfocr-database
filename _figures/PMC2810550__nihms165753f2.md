caption: The wnt signaling pathway involvement in cancer and neurodegeneration. When
  wnt binds to the LRP-frizzled receptor in the surface of the cell,β-catenin is stabilized
  promoting expression of wnt target genes and proliferation. Subtle disequilibrium
  in any step of the pathway in a manner that determines activation of the pathway,
  such as increased expression or polimorphisms that induce activation of wnt or β-catenin
  would favor cancer development, preventing neurodegeneration. On the contrary, conditions
  that induce inactivation of the pathway would favor the development of Alzheimer’s
  disease or other degenerative disorder, and as a consequence protect from cancer
  development.
