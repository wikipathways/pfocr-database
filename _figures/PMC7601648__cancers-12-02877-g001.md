caption: The canonical NFκB signalling pathway induced by TNF-α and IL-1β and the
  role of ubiquitination. In TNFα signalling, binding of TNFα to its receptor TNFR1
  leads to the recruitment of TRADD, TRAF2, RIP1 and cIAPs. This leads to K63-polyubiquitination
  on TRAF2, cIAP1/2 and RIP1, providing a binding platform for the TAK1 complex via
  TABIn IL-1β signalling, binding of IL-1β to its receptor IL-1R allows binding of
  the adapter protein MyD88 to the receptor TIR domain, resulting in the recruitment
  of the kinases Interleukin 1 Receptor Associated Kinase (IRAK) 1 and IRAKIRAK1 and
  4 can then dissociate from the receptor and interact with the E3 ligase TRAF6, leading
  to the formation of K63-polyubiquitin chains on TRAF6 and IRAK1, serving as a binding
  platform for the TAK1 complex via TABIrrespective of the stimuli, LUBAC binding
  to K63-polyubiquitin chains on cIAPs stabilize the complex and induce M1-polyubiquitin
  chains on RIP1 and the recruitment of IKK complex via NEMO. The IKK complex is then
  activated by TAK1, resulting in the phosphorylation of IκBα and its subsequent proteasomal
  degradation. This allows nuclear translocation of the NFκB subunits and NFκB activation.
  The other proteins and ubiquitin linkages depicted in the figure are discussed in
  the text. For clarity, E2 ligases and some E3 ligases are not shown in the figure
  but are discussed in the text. Dark blue, core NFκB pathway components; Light blue,
  adapter proteins; Purple, E3 ligases; Red, Deubiquitinases.
