caption: Cancer cells and stromal cells secrete VEGF, which via VEGFR2 stimulates
  expression of ATX and extracellular LPA production, as well as mRNA levels for LPA1
  receptor. The elevated extracellular ATX would increase localized levels of LPA
  and stimulate LPA signaling, particularly LPA1. Elevated LPA1 signaling, in turn,
  increases Akt2 mRNA levels. Enhanced expression of Akt2 has been associated with
  cancer progression, cellular migration and promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
