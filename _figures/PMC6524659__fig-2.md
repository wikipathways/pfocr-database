caption: 'Schematic representation of intracellular signaling pathways that are involved
  in the regulation of innate immune responses against IAV. IAV infection is associated
  with unique PAMPs (red), which are recognized by PRRs such as TLRs, RLRs, and NLRs
  leading to the induction of different signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt pathway,
  PKR signaling, OAS1/RNaseL pathway, TLR/RLRs/NLRs signaling, MAPK pathways (JNK
  pathway/p38 pathway), NF-κB pathways (canonical), and ERK1/2 pathway. After the
  secretion of interferons (IFN-α, -β) and tumor necrosis factors (TNF-α, -β), the
  noncanonical NF-κB pathway and STAT1/STAT pathways are stimulated, leading to the
  expression of several ISGs. At later time points, IAV-induced apoptosis is mainly
  mediated by TRIAL- and FASL-dependent activation of DRs and subsequent activation
  of casp3. Factors that were identified by TiCoNE analysis to be significantly enriched
  in IAV-infected mammalian cells are marked in blue ( and ). The defined role of
