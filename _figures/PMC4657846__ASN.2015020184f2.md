caption: 'Normal regulation of the complement AP. CFI is responsible for the proteolytic
  inactivation of C3b to iC3b (inactive C3b) and ultimately, the C3 breakdown products
  C3d and C3g, thus irreversibly preventing reassembly of the C3 convertase. MCP (CD46)
  is a surface-expressed regulator that has decay accelerating activity and acts as
  a cofactor for CFI. CFH is one of the most important regulators of the AP, controlling
  complement activation in several ways. It decreases the formation of C3b by competing
  with CFB in binding to C3b and accelerating the dissociation of the C3bBb convertase
  complex (decay accelerating activity). In addition, it acts as a cofactor for CFI
  in the cleavage of C3b to iC3b in concert with MCP. CFH protects against complement-mediated
  damage both in the fluid phase and on the host cell surface. Additional control
  of the cascade occurs through the CFHR protein family. CFHR consists of five proteins
  that are structurally and functionally related to CFH: CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR4,
  and CFHR5. These CFHR proteins compete with CFH for binding to C3b but have no direct
  complement inhibiting actions. Although the CFH-C3b interaction prevents further
  C3b generation, the CFHR protein-C3b interaction enables C3b amplification to proceed
  unhindered. This process is termed CFH deregulation. The ratio between CFH and CFHR
  proteins is, thus, critical for fine tuning complement regulation.'
