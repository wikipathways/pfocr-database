caption: Known and predicted mechanosensitive genes in the aortic valve endothelium
  under disturbed flow (A) and laminar flow (B). (A) Transforming growth factor-β
  (TGF-β) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) are mechanosensitive molecules that
  bind to their respective receptors and activate the Smad signaling cascade by phosphorylating
  Smad molecules, which ultimately translocate to the nucleus. Wnt molecules bind
  to frizzled Wnt receptors and cause the release of β-catenin (Wnt canonical pathway),
  which leads to cytosolic β-catenin accumulation and translocation to the nucleus.
  Interleukins bind to interleukin receptors and regulate the NF-κβ signaling cascade
  that alters gene transcription. All these pathways induce inflammatory and osteogenic
  gene transcription, leading to endothelial dysfunction. Inflammatory miRNAs are
  also upregulated in disturbed flow, causing gene translation repression of anti-inflammatory
  genes. NADPH is upregulated in disturbed flow, which induces the generation of reactive
  oxygen species. (B) Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) are mechanosensitive genes upregulated
  in laminar flow that translocate to the nucleus and induce anti-inflammatory gene
  transcription. Notch1 binds to Notch receptors and causes NICD to be released and
  translocated to the nucleus, thereby promoting gene transcription. Anti-inflammatory
  miRNAs are upregulated in laminar flow, repressing translation of inflammatory genes.
  Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is upregulated in laminar flow, which induces
  nitric oxide generation and release outside of the cell. To see this illustration
