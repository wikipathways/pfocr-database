caption: 'Overall, 3965 proteins were identified and 1029 were differentially expressed
  between the groups. IVF5%O2-generated blastocysts had 334 proteins upregulated relative
  to the control (flushed blastocyst), while 499 proteins were upregulated on IVF20%O2
  embryos, with 85% overlap. Six glycolytic proteins had different levels in IVF embryos
  compared to control. Hexokinase 2 (HK) and triosephosphate isomerase 1 (TPI) were
  upregulated, while 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM), pyruvate kinase (PK),
  and lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) were downregulated in both IVF groups compared
  to in vivo generated blastocysts. In addition, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) isoenzyme
  was upregulated only in IVF5%O2 blastocysts compared to control. Three proteins
  involved in the pentose phosphate pathway were different between IVF embryos and
  control embryos. Glucose 6-phopshate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was decreased in both
  IVF groups, while phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRPS1) and transaldolase
  1 (TALDO1) were higher in IVF5%O2-generated blastocysts compared to control. Four
  proteins associated with TCA cycle were significantly dysregulated in IVF-generated
  embryos. Succinyl-CoA ligase α (SUCLG1) was significantly upregulated in both IVF
  group compared to in vivo embryos. The remaining proteins were dysregulated only
  in IVF20%O2–generated embryos compared to control: pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHA1),
  aconitase (ACO2), and succinyl-CoA ligase β (SUCLG2) were upregulated, while citrate
  synthase (CS) was downregulated. Proteins are highlighted in blue color, if they
  were statistically different (p<0.05) in both IVF groups compared to control; yellow
  color indicates changes of only IVF5%O2-generated blastocysts vs in vivo embryo;
  red color indicates changes of only IVF20%O2-generated blastocysts vs in vivo embryo;
  black arrows represent the directionality of the interaction (increased or decreased).
