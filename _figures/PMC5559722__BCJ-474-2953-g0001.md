caption: '(A) Top: schematic of the p97 architecture, side and top views of the cryo-EM
  structure of ADP-bound p97 (PDB: 5FTK). Bottom: domain organization of p97, color-coded
  as above. (B) Well-characterized cellular process requiring p97 activity. (I) Post-mitotic
  membrane fusion via the p97/p47 pathway. (II) Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.
  (III) Removal of KU70/80 from chromatin. (IV) NF-κB activation via the canonical
  pathway. Proteins are color-coded according to their function. p97 and the proteasome
  are in green, ubiquitinated p97 substrates are blue, cognate E3 ubiquitin ligases
  decorating p97 substrates are red, phosphorylation signaling proteins are in pink,
  ubiquitin is in yellow and other proteins are in brown.'
