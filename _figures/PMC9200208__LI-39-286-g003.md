caption: 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 attaches to angiotensin-converting
  enzyme-2 receptors present on the vascular endothelium and damages it by direct
  infection, which leads to apoptosis and release of tissue factor and von Willebrand
  factor, activation of the complement pathway and activation of leucocytes, which
  lead to the release of interleukins. All these factors lead to the formation of
  fibrin from fibrinogen. Common phenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome
  in COVID-19 infection: L-type and H-type. Proposed mechanism of action of tissue
  plasminogen activator in the L-type phenotype'
