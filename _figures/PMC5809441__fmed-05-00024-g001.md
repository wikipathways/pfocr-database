caption: Pleiotropic effects of statins. The lipid lowering effects of statins is
  attributed to their action on 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA reductase).
  Statins block the pathway for synthesizing cholesterol in liver by competitively
  inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-controlling enzyme of the mevalonate pathway,
  leading to lower circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. A
  decrease in cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) results in a modest increase
  in apolipoprotein A-I and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Through
  the upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), statins promote nitric
  oxide production and enhance endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Statins also
  modulate the endothelial expression of cytokines, chemokines and leukocyte adhesion
  molecules, decreasing vascular inflammation—an important contributor to the vascular
  atherogenetic process. Furthermore, affecting both the endothelial production of
  inflammatory factors and cholesterol uptake, statins stabilize the atheromatic plaques.
  Their benefit on vascular function is also associated with the downregulation of
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) which results in lower levels
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Their antioxidative effects are also reflected
  on a decrease in oxidized LDL (oxLDL) levels. Statins elicit downregulation of tissue
  factor (TF) and overexpression of thrombomodulin, showing antithrombotic properties.
  Finally, the potential systematic beneficial effect of statins on systemic inflammatory
  diseases can be attributed to their ability to reduce inflammatory cytokines, such
  as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukins, and C-reactive protein (CRP).
