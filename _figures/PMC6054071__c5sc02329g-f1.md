caption: . Biosynthesis of class II lanthipeptides. (A) Biosynthetic pathway of class
  II lanthipeptides with lichenicidin β (Licβ) shown as an example. The precursor
  peptide LicA2 is dehydrated and cyclized by the class II lanthipeptide synthetase
  LicM2. Then, the leader peptide is removed in a two-step process by LicT and LicP
  (see Fig. S1). Also shown is the structure of the α component that together with
  Licβ makes up the two-component lantibiotic lichenicidin. Obu, 2-oxobutyryl group
  resulting from hydrolysis of an N-terminal Dhb; Abu, α-aminobutyric acid. (B) Dehydration
  and cyclization reactions that take place during the lanthipeptide post-translational
  modification process. For the sequence of the leader peptide, see Fig. S1. .
