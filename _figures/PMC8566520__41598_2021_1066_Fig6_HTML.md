caption: Conceptual links between TGF-β signaling, id2 and known sex-determining genes.
  Ligands belonging to the TGF-β superfamily bind to their respective type 2 receptor,
  which in turn recruits the type 1 receptor activating the SMAD factors and leading
  to expression of id2. The Id2 protein interacts directly with E proteins therefore
  preventing their binding to DNA in the E Box sequence. Different components of the
  TGF-β signaling pathway recurrently became the sex-determining gene, where Id2b
  would be in a downstream position in the pathway. Created in BioRender.com.
