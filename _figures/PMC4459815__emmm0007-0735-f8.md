caption: Model  Through the synthesis/secretion of soluble chemoprotective factors
  including IL-6, CAFs induce pancreatic cancer cell chemoresistance. High protein
  synthesis rate in CAFs is dependent on the robust intrinsic activation of the mTOR
  pathway resulting in inhibition of the protein translation inhibitor 4E-BP1. Secreted
  IL-6 participates in an autocrine feed-forward loop in the intrinsic activation
  of mTOR and subsequent high protein synthesis.  CAFs express the somatostatin receptor
  sst1. Upon activation with the novel SOM230 somatostatin analogue (Pasireotide®
  Novartis) presenting a high affinity for sst1, the mTOR pathway is inhibited, resulting
  in reduced synthesis/secretion of chemoprotective factors including IL-6 through
  inhibition of mRNA translation. As consequences, the autocrine feed-forward IL-6/mTOR/protein
  synthesis/IL-6 loop is abrogated, and pancreatic cancer cells are re-sensitized
  to the apoptotic action of chemotherapies.
