caption: 'Role of miR-302 during human ESCs (hESC) neural differentiation. Transcription
  from the miR-302 locus is activated by the ESC core transcriptional regulatory circuitry.
  miR-302 post-transcriptionally inhibits NR2F2 which in turn is an inhibitor of Oct4.
  In a negative feedback loop, Oct4 inhibits NR2F2 transcription. NR2F2 expression
  is necessary for proper activation of neuroectoderm genes. miR-302 also targets
  inhibitors of both branches of the TGFβ pathway: the Nodal inhibitors, Lefty1 and
  Lefty 2, and the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitors, DAZAP2, SLAIN1 and
  TOB2. According to the neural default model, inhibition of both branches of the
  TGFβ pathway leads to neural induction. Thus, by targeting inhibitors of both branches
  miR-302 has a negative effect on neural induction.'
