caption: Mechanisms of EEDL on ox-LDL-induced foam cell formation in RAW 264.7 cells.
  Ox-LDL entered into macrophages via LOX-1, TLR4, SRB1 and CD36, and induced lipid
  accumulation via PPARγ signaling pathway. Then the content of cell metabolites was
  changed such as cholesterol, ceramide, L-glutamine and arachidonic acid, resulting
  in lipid deposition, inflammatory damage, energy metabolism dysfunction, cell apoptosis.
  However, the EEDL mainly regulated TLR4 and SRB1 to inhibit the uptake of ox-LDL,
  inhibited PPARγ expression, and following, restored the abnormal metabolites induced
  by ox-LDL. In the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, the EEDL mainly blocked the phosphorylation
  of IKKα/β, IκBα and NF-κB p65. Thereafter, the EEDL decreased the expression of
  TNF-α, COX-2 and MCP-1 to exert anti-inflammatory effect, and inhibited apoptosis
  in macrophages via regulating Bcl-2 family. In conclusion, EEDL prevented macrophages
  foam cell formation via the TLR4/NF-κB and PPARγ signaling pathways.
