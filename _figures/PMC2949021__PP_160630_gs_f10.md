caption: Proposed model of the miR159-GAMYB regulatory pathway in Arabidopsis. GAMYB-like
  proteins are present in the aleurone, indicating low activity of miR159. In this
  tissue, we hypothesize that they transduce the GA signal for the activation of GA-induced
  genes, which leads to nutrient secretion and the progression of PCD. Conversely,
  strong miR159 activity fully represses MYB33 and MYB65 in vegetative tissues, ensuring
  that aleurone-related genes remain inactive to allow the progression of growth.
  GA appears not associated with the miR159-GAMYB regulatory module in these tissues.
