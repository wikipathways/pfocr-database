  CSNK2 targets across all cancers were identified in this review: AKT, PTEN, RELA

  indicate all other interactions. b The four most common biological phenotypes associated
  with CSNK2 in cancer, categorised by cancer hallmark [] were: apoptosis (A), proliferation
  (P), cell cycle control (C) and invasion/metastasis (I). These four phenotypes were
  paired to the pathways from a if the pathway was an established regulator of this
  biological behaviour.'
