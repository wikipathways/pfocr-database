caption: Baicalein and baicalin significantly influences apoptosis in colorectal cancer
  cells. Baicalein induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence through various
  pathways, including inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling, downregulation of Bcl-2, upregulation
  of Bax, and activation of the MAPK pathway. It also triggers apoptosis through caspase
  activation and morphological changes, and increases DNA damage response markers
  like γ-H2AX. Baicalein's cytotoxicity is enhanced by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT pathway
  or reducing γ-H2AX expression. In drug-resistant CRC cells, baicalein's effect is
  reduced due to P-glycoprotein overexpression. Additionally, baicalein downregulates
  c-Myc and miRNAs, and induces apoptosis through the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways,
  including Sp1-mediated survivin regulation
