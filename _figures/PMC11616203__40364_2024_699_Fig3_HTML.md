caption: The effect of TRPM channels on signal pathways related to tumor progression.
  TRPM channels are widely involved in tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis
  by regulating signaling pathways related to tumor cell progression. (1) Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. Through the Ca2+/calmodulin-EGFR signaling axis, TRPM4 controls
  the activities of AKT1 and GSK-3β, facilitating β-catenin entry into the nucleus.
  (2) MAPK signaling pathway. a TRPM2 activates the MEK pathway by initiating PKC
  and inhibits JNK activation by reducing ROS and RNS levels in cells. b TRPM7 relies
  on calcium signaling to hinder the ERK1/2 pathway. c TRPM8 inhibits JNK and p38
  MAPK pathways. 3) PI3k/AKT signaling pathway. a TRPM1-dependent calcium signaling
  activates AKT by rousing CaMKIIδ. b TRPM2 inhibits the activity of PTEN, a negative
  regulator of PI3k/AKT signaling pathway, by mediating calcium influx in cells. c TRPM4
  upregulates intracellular Ca2+ levels to induce calpain-mediated focal adhesion
  kinase (FAK) hydrolysis, obstructing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade. d TRPM7
  activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through magnesium and calcium signaling.
  4) HIF-1α signaling pathway. In addition to preventing RACK1-mediated HIF-1 degradation,
  TRPM7 can also slow down HIF-1 degradation by impeding AMPK activity. 5) Calcineurin/NFAT
  signaling pathway. Both TRPM7 and TRPM8 activate the calcium-regulated phosphatase/NFAT
  signaling pathway to dephosphorylate NFAT and facilitate its movement into the nucleus.
  6) p53 signaling pathway. TRPM7 promotes MDM2-mediated p53 degradation by influencing
  Mg2+ influx, or promotes MDMX-mediated inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity
  by affecting Zn2+ influx
