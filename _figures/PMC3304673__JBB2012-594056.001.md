caption: 'Association of the canonical interferon pathway with the IRF5 haplotype.
  Naïve B cells were either exposed to EBV for 16 hours or left unstimulated. Whole-genome
  expression levels were compared between cells with the risk and protective haplotypes
  using the Illumina platform. Significant association of the data set with the canonical
  IFN pathway was discovered using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (P < 0.01). Interactions
  between genes in the interferon pathway based on Ingenuity Pathway Analysis are
  shown for both the unstimulated (a) and the EBV-infected conditions (b). Blue gene
  symbols represent genes with relatively lower expression in the cells with the risk
  haplotype, while genes with red shading are upregulated in the risk cells. IFIT3:
  IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3, SOCS: suppressor of cytokine
  signaling.'
