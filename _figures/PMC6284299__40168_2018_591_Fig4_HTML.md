caption: 'Metabolic functions represented by gene transcription activities that changed
  significantly in the L. fermentum genome. Y-axis: relative mRNA read abundance values
  in percent; x-axis: time points of biofilm maturation (x-axis). Upper panel: Metabolism
  of carbohydrates via the pentose pathway, pyruvate and glycerol oxidation, as well
  as the pH neutralizing arginine deiminase pathways were highly expressed during
  L. fermentum’s establishment as a secondary biofilm colonizer. Phage related proteins,
  and 67 transposases were also highly upexpressed suggesting that gene rearrangements
  and phage induction are of major importance in L. fermentum colonization success.
  Genes encoding two membrane proteins, a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (GAPDH) and a manganese transporter (MntH) were also highly upexpressed and suggest
  that: L. fermentum is capable of forming a Lactate-Mn(II) complex that assists in
  the intracellular removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS); and employs GADPH in
  glycolysis or for attaching to primary colonizers in the in vitro biofilm community,
  which supports its further colonization and growth'
