caption: Gaussian graphical models of metabolites among associated chemical super-pathways
  and sub-pathways most related to serum alpha-tocopherol concentration in the study.
  Metabolites are drawn as hexagons, and the pairs with an absolute value of conditional
  correlation ≥0.2 are connected by a line. The colors represent the association directions
  of conditional correlations, with pink indicating positive conditional correlations,
  and blue indicating negative conditional correlations. Magnitudes of the conditional
  correlations are represented by line width (i.e., wider lines for stronger correlations).
  Metabolites with an “●” indicates an inverse association with serum α-tocopherol
  and “✶” indicates that the association met the Bonferroni correction threshold p<2.79
  × 10−5. Enzyme on the pathway between metabolites are indicated by “*”.
