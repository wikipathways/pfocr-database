caption: Heart failure involves alterations in multiple metabolic pathways that can
  alter mitochondrial ATP production and substrate utilization, and ultimately myocardial
  energy reserve and efficiency. Obesity, which is very common in patients with heart
  failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), induces systemic fatty acid oversupply
  from adipose tissue that is re-routed to peripheral organs, including the heart.
  Mismatch between cardiac fatty acid uptake and fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) leads
  to intramyocardial accumulation of diglycerides and ceramides, uncoupling their
  oxidative phosphorylation. Hypoxia facilitates the metabolic shift towards glycolysis
  with a subsequent increase in lactate and pyruvate accumulation owing to impaired
  activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). A compensatory increase in anaplerosis
  diverts the products of the glycolysis towards the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
  and the pentose phosphate pathway. Several metabolism-modulating pharmaceuticals
  are being examined in HFpEF, as in other forms of heart failure. Ranolazine is a
  partial inhibitor of FAO, which reciprocally increases glucose oxidation and PDH
  activity. Etomoxir inhibits carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1), which controls
  the access of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) to the mitochondria for FAO. Elamipretide
  selectively targets the electron transport chain to increase energy efficiency.
