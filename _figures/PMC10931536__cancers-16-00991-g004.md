caption: Selected epigenetic changes and host-virus interactions perpetrated by EBV
  nuclear antigens and latent membrane proteins. Nuclear antigens (e.g., EBNA1) interact
  directly with transcription factors and/or intermediate proteins of signaling pathways
  that lead to the deposition of acetylation marks on histones, which translate into
  the upregulation of downstream targets of the corresponding intermediate, shown
  in the figure, as ATF3. EBNA2 can also bind DNA sites in the enhancer and promote
  transcription by attracting histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or transcription factors
  (TFs) to those sites. Alternatively, EBNA2 can also block the binding of transcription
  factors to promoters and repress the downstream targets of TFs, such as the EBNA2-mediated
  repression of CD79B via TF-blocking at the promoter. From a chromatin modeling perspective,
  EBNA3C recruits histone HATs and histone deacetylases (HDACs) to controlhistone
  configuration, thereby controlling transcriptional access for both viral and host
  TFs. Membrane proteins perpetrate similar changes via modulation of signaling activity.
  LMP1 modulates the NF-kB signaling pathway to inflict epigenetic changes such as
  CpG island methylation, lysine-specific histone methylation, and promoter-specific
  methylation to control gene transcription in EBVaGC, BL, and NPC. LMP2A mimics the
  BCR signaling cascade and directly targets the phosphorylation of STAT3, which subsequently
  binds and activates key promoters such as those that controls transcription of some
  factors EBVaGC. Figure composed using information from [28,38,179,180,181,182,183]
