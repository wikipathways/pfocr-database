caption: 'NAFLD related lipotoxicity, IR and inflammation. Legend 1: Lipotoxicity
  promotes inflammation and insulin resistance (IR). In turn, IR increases adipocyte
  lipolysis and exacerbates lipotoxicity. By binding with specific receptors, saturated
  fatty acids (SFAs) activate nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). In IR, liver expression
  of NF-κB is extremely high. Receptor activator of NF-κB (RANKL) binds to its receptor
  (RANK) in liver and activates the NF-κB pathway. Activation of NF-κB kinase-β (IKK-β)
  promotes expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha
  (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). TNF-α increases adipocyte lipolysis, strengthens
  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1(IRS-1) and reduces AMPK activity.
  IL-6 activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and suppresses IL-1 induced
  secretion of insulin. TNF-α and IL-6 promote development of IR and NAFLD. Defciency
  of IKK-β promotes expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as adiponectin.
  Adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) activates AMPK activity, which then suppresses
  DNL, increases fatty acid oxidation and promotes mitochondrial function. AdipoR2
  activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α) signaling, which
  exerts anti-inflammatory effects by regulating NF-κB. Adiponectin inhibits the development
  of IR and NAFLD'
