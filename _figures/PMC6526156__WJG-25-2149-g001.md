caption: 'Hypothetical mechanisms by which the esophageal microbiota participates
  in the pathogenesis of Barrett''s esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).
  The microbial dysbiosis in the esophagus is associated with abnormal esophagus.
  Normal esophagus harbors a larger proportion of gram-positive bacteria, whereas
  the microbiota in abnormal esophagus is dominated by gram-negative bacteria. This
  shift from a gram-positive aerobic microbiota to a gram-negative anaerobic microbiota
  may interact with inflammatory cells and promote the production and secretion of
  inflammatory factors, such as cytokines and chemokines. In addition, the increase
  in gram-negative bacteria and their components/products, including LPS, DNA and
  RNA, may stimulate TLRs (mainly TLR4). TLR4 expression in the esophageal epithelium
  of BE/EAC is upregulated. As the natural ligands of LPS, TLR4 may play an important
  role in pathogenesis, whose activation could trigger the NF-κB pathway. These interactions
  mentioned above may stimulate activation of certain intercellular signaling pathways,
  such as NF-κB. This activation may upregulate the expression of target genes. Moreover,
  genotoxins generated by some bacteria may cause genomic instability and DNA damage.
  The end effects might be the induction of inflammation, BE transformation and carcinogenesis.
  However, whether the microbiota plays a causative role in BE/EAC progression is
  still unclear. LPS: lipopolysaccharides; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa B; TLRs: toll-like
  receptors; BE: Barrett''s esophagus; EAC: Esophageal adenocarcinoma.'
