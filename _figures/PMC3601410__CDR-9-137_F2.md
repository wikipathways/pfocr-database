caption: Most of the studies on Nrf2 and obesity-metabolic syndrome have focused on
  liver and white adipose tissue. Nrf2 has been shown to induce metabolic regulators
  (such as PPARγ, C/EBPβ, AHR in adipose tissue and SHP in the liver) or to repress
  other ones (such as FGF21, ATP citrate lyase). The exact molecular mechanisms of
  the majority of these interactions as well as their physiological significance are
  not clear yet.→denotes induction, --| denotes repression.Nrf2; nuclear erythroid
