caption: 'Mechanism of ischemia-reperfusion injury. (A) In the ischemic state, hypoxia
  (oxygen deficiency) converts mitochondrial metabolism from aerobic to anaerobic,
  resulting in lower ATP generation. Anaerobic respiration also induces metabolic
  acidosis and leads to the activation ion-exchange channels. Altered electrolyte
  imbalance can cause cell swelling and impair enzymatic activity. Moreover, under
  hypoxia, the mitochondrial electron-transport chains (ETCs) are also disrupted.
  (B) In the reperfusion state, mitochondrial damage and cellular alternations caused
  by previous hypoxia can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  from multiple sources: the NADPH oxidase system, nitric oxide synthase system, xanthine
  oxidase system and mainly mitochondrial electron-transport chains. Such enhanced
  oxidative stress can target mitochondria ETC and cause further damage ETC, causing
  more ROS production. Oxidative stress can cause secondary cellular damage. Restoration
  of oxygen can induce the overactivation of pumps that are inhibited by ischemia-induced
  ATP deficiency, which rapidly triggers the influx of sodium ions and later calcium
  ions. Altering calcium homeostasis causes cellular damage, stimulates ROS production
  and induces cell death by triggering the opening of mPTP and activating apoptotic
  pathway.'
