caption: The schematic diagram shows APP processing by secretase enzymes. APP is a
  transmembrane protein consists of 695–771 amino acids. The major or primary cleavage
  pathway of APP is shown in the left, where it is initially cleaved by α-secretase
  enzyme. This enzyme cleaves APP within its Aβ domain; hence it precludes the generation
  of Aβ peptides and termed as ‘non-amyloidogenic pathway’. The second cleavage was
  carried out by γ-secretase. As shown in the figure, α-secretase pathway produces
  sAPPα and a small P3 fragment.In contrast, the minor or β-secretase pathway is shown
  at the right side of the figure. Proteolytic cleavage of APP molecule by β-secretase
  and subsequent cleavage by γ-secretase produce sAPPβ and Aβ peptides and the latter
  is pathognomonic for AD. Generated Aβ can form aggregates and deposits as neuritic
  plaques within the brain parenchyma.
