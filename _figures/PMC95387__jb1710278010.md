caption: Illustration of proposed mechanisms of PTS-dependent maltose transport and
  metabolism. Maltose is also incorporated into cells via an ABC transporter, whose
  system is explained with the PTS system in Discussion. Thin arrows indicate the
  metabolic pathway, and thick arrows and perpendicular ones indicate positive and
  negative controls, respectively. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; HTH, helix-turn-helix.
