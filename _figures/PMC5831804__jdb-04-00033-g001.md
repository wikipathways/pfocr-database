caption: Major players implicated in the phenotypes associated with the deletion of
  GUP1 in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans (grey boxes). Plain arrows indicate established
  interactions; dashed arrows indicate possible interactions. Pentagons refer to nodal
  proteins exerting multiple signalling, affecting positively or negatively many other
  proteins. (A) The Sho1 downward cascade belongs to the HOG (High Osmolarity Glycerol)
  pathway, and the Rom/Rho cascade constitutes the Cell Wall Integrity—CWI/PKC pathway.
  Crosstalk between HOG, PKC, the complex lipids and TORC1/2 signalling pathways relevant
  for GUP1 associated phenotypes is shown; (B) Centrality of Cdc42 phosphorylation
  (pink boxes) in the control of pathways ultimately promoting differentiation, polarity,
  growth and reproduction. The central role of one protein shared by many pathways
  is designated in the text as star-type pathway.
