caption: 'Post-translational Modifications (PTMs) that Modulate the Retinoic Acid-Inducible
  Gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR)–Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling Protein (MAVS)
  Signaling Pathway. Schematic of the signaling pathway triggered by the intracellular
  viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensors RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5 (MDA5) and their shared adaptor MAVS localized at the mitochondrion. Activation
  of this pathway leads to the gene expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and other
  proinflammatory cytokines via TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKK family kinases
  and downstream transcription factors, primarily IRF3 and nuclear factor kappa B
  (NF-κB). This figure further illustrates the PTMs and responsible enzymes that modulate
  the signaling activity or protein abundance of RIG-I, MDA5, and MAVS. The details
  of the post-translational control mechanisms and specific residues modified in RIG-I,
  MDA5, and MAVS are described in the text. Unbroken arrows indicate direct effects
  or signaling events. Broken arrows indicate events that are indirect or that have
  not yet been completely established. Abbreviations: Ac, acetylation; CARD, caspase
  activation and recruitment domain; CTD, carboxy-terminal domain; P, phosphate; Ub,
  ubiquitin; K63-(Ub)n, K63-linked ubiquitination; K48-(Ub)n, K48-linked ubiquitination.
  Red/orange signifies inhibitory PTMs; blue/green indicates positive regulatory PTMs.'
