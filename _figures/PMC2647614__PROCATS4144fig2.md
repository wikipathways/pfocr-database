caption: Relationship of genes significantly changed in acute rejection to process
  pathways. The relationship of genes significantly changed in acute rejection (as
  compared with no rejection) to different biological pathways was investigated using
  GenMAPP, a computer application designed to visualize gene expression data through
  preconfigured or custom-developed biological pathways and groupings of genes ().
  For this analysis, a delta value of 1.05, which identified 885 genes with a false
  discovery rate (FDR) of 4.63%, was used to include a larger pool of candidate genes.
  Six of the 52 preconfigured pathways showed significant changes in expression of
  some of their component genes. These included pathways for transforming growth factor-β
  signaling, inflammatory response, apoptosis, nucleotide G-protein–coupled receptors,
  peptide G-protein–coupled receptors, and the Wnt family of signaling molecules.
  The inflammatory response pathway is shown here. Genes highlighted in orange are
  significantly changed; those highlighted in gray are not significantly changed;
  those in white were not represented on the Affymetrix Human U133A GeneChip. Reprinted
