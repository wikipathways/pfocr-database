caption: Schematic model of the involvement of LRP6 in the PTH-stimulated anabolic
  bone effect. PTH-stimulated complex formation of PTH–PTH1R–LRP6 results in the activation
  of cAMP-PKA and β-catenin-Tcf/Lef signaling pathways in osteoblastic lineage cells.
  In earlier stages of osteoblastic lineage cells, LRP6-mediated activation of both
  pathways by PTH promotes the survival and differentiation of osteoblasts, leading
  to increased osteoblastic bone formation (A). In osteocytes, LRP6-mediated activation
  of cAMP signaling pathway by PTH inhibits MEF2 transcription factor–stimulated activity
  of Sost transcription and reduces sclerostin production, leading to increased osteoblastic
  bone formation (B).
