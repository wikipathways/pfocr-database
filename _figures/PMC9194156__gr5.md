caption: The classical FGF/FGFR signaling pathwayThe FGF/FGFR signaling regulates
  a wide range of cellular functions, including migration, proliferation, differentiation,
  and survival, as well as development, metabolism, and tissue homeostasis. Human
  diseases, such as cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders are often observed with
  dysfunction of the FGF/FGFR signaling. Binding of FGF to the receptor at the extracellular
  side leads to dimerization and activation of the kinase domain of FGFR in the cytosol.
  FGFR regulates the downward signaling pathways of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR,
  JAK/STAT3, and PLCγ/PKC. The active FGFR kinase domain phosphorylates FRS2 (FGFR
  substrate 2), an adaptor protein bound to the juxtamembrane domain of FGFR. Phosphorylated
  FRS2 recruits Grb2/SOS and GAB1 (Grb2 associated binding protein 1) to the plasma
  membrane, activating Ras in the MAPK and PI3K in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, respectively.
  Active Ras proteins form a nanocluster, recruiting Raf to the plasma membrane and
  leading to Raf activation through the dimerization of kinase domains. Active Raf
  dimers lead to activation of a series of the MAPK kinases. A lipid kinase PI3K phosphorylates
  signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) at the plasma membrane. PIP3-bound PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase 1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) phosphorylate and activate PIP3-bound
  AKT. The active AKT regulates the activation of mTORC1 leading to cell growth. In
  the JAK/STAT pathway, JAK binds FGFR, phosphorylates the receptor’s Tyr residues
  to recruit STAT to the receptor, and then phosphorylates STAT to release it. Two
  phosphorylated STAT proteins form a dimer, enter the nucleus, and bind to DNA for
  gene transcription. In the PLCγ/PKC pathway, PLCγ binds to the phosphorylated Tyr
  residue at the C-terminal tail of FGFR and hydrolyzes PIP2 to produce IP3 (inositol
  triphosphate) and DAG (diacylglycerol). The released IP3 molecules from the plasma
  membrane translocate to the ER and bind to the IP3 receptor (IP3R) at the ER membrane,
  promoting Ca2+ release to the cytosol. DAG and Ca2+ recruit the C1 and C2 domains
  of PKC (protein kinase C), respectively, to the plasma membrane and activate the
  kinase domain of PKC. The active PKC kinase domain phosphorylates and activates
  DAG-bound RasGRP (Ras guanyl-releasing protein 1, a GEF for Ras) at the plasma membrane.
  Active RasGRP interacts with Ras and activates Ras/MAPK signaling. FGFR regulates
  a number of cellular functions from embryogenesis to adult tissue homeostasis, targeting
  various transcription factors, such as STAT, Elk1, c-Myc, and c-Jun, leading to
  cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis.
