caption: 'Schematic representation of GLAST regulation in relation to nNOS/NO signaling.
  The left side of the figure depicts a glutamatergic PN synapse in the absence of
  nNOS‐derived NO signaling, while the right side depicts a physiological glutamatergic
  synapse with nNOS expression and NO production. (1.a) PF stimulation triggers the
  production of NO via calcium‐dependent nNOS. (1.b) NO production can also be stimulated
  by glutamate uptake within BG, again through a calcium‐dependent mechanism. (2)
  Glutamate released by PFs/CFs are uptake by GLAST and co‐transported with 3 Na+
  ions into the BG cytosol. Right side: (3.a) NO produced by both PF terminals and
  BG will activate PKG through the classical NO‐cGMP‐PKG pathway, causing transport
  of GLAST to the BG PM. (4.a) Additionally, the increased Na+ influx through GLAST
  activity, along with the presence of NO, causes a reversal of the NCX, allowing
  for Na+ to be shuttled outside of the BG and causing an influx of Ca2+ into the
  BG. (5.a) As a result, appropriate glutamate clearance from the synaptic cleft occurs,
  contributing to the normal function of PNs in the cerebellum. Left side: (3.b) In
  the absence of nNOS/NO signaling, there is less activation of PKG and therefore
  less transport of GLAST to the BG PM. (4.b) Additionally, the lack of NO and lower
  Na+ from active GLAST transporters results in lower activity of the NCX in reverse
  mode and less Ca2+ influx into the BG cytosol, which can cause BG process retraction
  and less BG ensheathment of the synaptic cleft. (5.b) As a result, the decrease
  in glutamate uptake efficiency will result in an overload of glutamate in the synaptic
  cleft, leading to PN excitotoxicity'
