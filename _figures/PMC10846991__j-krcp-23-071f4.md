caption: Through binding to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR)-1/2
  expressed on GECs, VEGF-A synthesized by podocytes can induce endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase (eNOS) activation in GECs and subsequently increase nitric oxide
  (NO) production. The increase of NO may negatively regulate the amount of VEGF-A
  produced by podocytes. VEGF-A can inhibit endothelin-1 (ET-1) production by GECs
  through the activation of eNOS. High levels of ET-1 inhibit NO production. ET-1
  released from GECs can activate ET receptor (ETR) A and B on podocytes. Angiopoietin
  1/2 (ANGPT1/2) produced by podocytes can bind with the Tie2 expressed on GECs. CXCL12
  secreted by podocytes can activate CXCR4/7 on GECs. On podocytes, interkeukin-6
  (IL-6) can bind with the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R) and activate the
  classical signaling pathway. Moreover, IL-6 also can form a complex with soluble
  form of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and activate the trans-signaling pathway. On
  GECs, since mIL-6R is absent, only IL-6 trans-signaling can be activated. Extracellular
  vesicles (EVs) released by both podocytes and GECs act as bidirectional crosstalk
  mediators.GBM, glomerular basement membrane
