caption: Signal transduction pathways and crosstalk activated by insulin/IGF-1 receptor
  and GPCR systems. The binding of an agonist to its cognate GPCR induces Gq/PLC activation,
  hydrolysis of PIP2, generation of Ins(,,)P3 and Ca2+ mobilization as described in
  the text. DAG, the other product of PLC, activates novel PKCs (δ, ε, θ, η,)and,
  in synergy with Ca2+, conventional PKCs (α, β1, β2, γ). PKD (PKD1, PKD2 and PKD3)
  operate downstream of DAG and PKCs and lead via inactivation of the Ras/Raf inhibitor
  RIN1 to ERK pathway activation, potentiating signaling via mutated KRAS. Pathways
  activated by a typical Gq-coupled receptor are shown in blue. For the sake of clarity,
  stimulation of mTORC1 by ERK is not indicated in the scheme but is discussed in
  the text. Insulin/IGF induces PI3-kinase/Akt/TSC/Rheb/mTORC1 pathway, indicated
  in green. Positive crosstalk to GPCR-induced Ca2+signaling is indicated by the white
  broken line. A plausible target are Regulators of G proteins (RGS) which accelerate
  G protein inactivation by enhancing their GTPase activity. Negative feedback from
  S6K and mTORC1 on IRS is also indicated (white solid line). Metformin (chemical
  structure in the insert) is shown to activate AMPK with broken lines, because it
  does not interact directly with AMPK but increases the level of 5′AMP in the cell.
  AMPK opposes mTORC1 by phophorylating TSC2 and raptor, as indicated. AMPK also phosphorylates
  IRS (on Ser789) thereby moderating its activation when the negative feedback is
  removed by mTORC1 inhibition. See text for further details.Another phase I trial
  will examine side effects and best dose of metformin when given together with temsirolimus
  in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumor or lymphoma.
