caption: 'This GRN summarizes the results obtained in our study. SIX1 is located at
  a central position targeted by copy number gains. The WNT-signalling pathway (dashed
  line) activates SIX1 expression. MEF2C regulates SIX1 transcription depending on
  posttranslational modifications by MAPK7 (inhibits the suppressive function of MEF2C)
  and HDAC9 (activates the suppressive function of MEF2C). Target genes regulated
  by SIX1 include GATA3, MSX1, GATA2, and SPIB. Their deregulation may inhibit B-cell
  differentiation processes. EYA1 and TLE4 may operate as activatory and inhibitory
  cofactors, respectively. Red: elevated expression level, green: reduced expression
  level.'
