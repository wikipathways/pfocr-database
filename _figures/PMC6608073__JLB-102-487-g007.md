caption: Summary diagram. Alcohol or its metabolites (acetaldehyde) induce miR‐155
  and HDAC11 in KCs by the NF‐κB pathway and down‐regulates TLR4 negative regulators.
  miR‐155 mimics and inhibitor reciprocally regulated TLR4 regulators (IRAK‐M, SHIP1,
  SOCS1, and C/EBPβ) in KCs. Knockdown of HDAC11 with siRNA decreased IL‐10 levels,
  which resulted in an increase in TNF‐α levels. Together, these pathways promote
  inflammation in ALD.
