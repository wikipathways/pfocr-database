caption: c-MET signaling adaptors and mediators. When the tyrosines within the multifunctional
  docking site become phosphorylated they recruit signaling effectors, including the
  adaptor proteins growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), src homology 2 domain-containing
  (SHC), v-crk sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene homolog (CRK) and CRK-like (CRKL); the
  effector molecules phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)
  and SRC, the src homology 2 domain-containing 5' inositol phosphatase SHIP-2, and
  the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT3. In addition, unique
  to c-MET is its association with the adaptor protein GRB2-associated binding protein
  1 (GAB1), a multi-adaptor protein that, once bound to and phosphorylated by c-MET,
  creates binding sites for more downstream adaptors. GAB1 can bind either directly
  to c-MET or indirectly, through GRB2. The downstream response to c-MET activation
  relies on stereotypical signaling modulators common to many receptor tyrosine kinases.
  For activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, c-MET activation
  stimulates the activity of the rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS) guanine
  nucleotide exchanger son of sevenless (SOS) via binding with SHC and GRB2 leading
  to the activation of RAS. This leads to the indirect activation of v-raf murine
  sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (RAF) kinases, which can subsequently activate
  MAPK effector kinase (MEK), and finally MAPK, which can then translocate to the
  nucleus to activate the transcription factors responsible for regulating a large
  number of genes, including those involved in cell proliferation, cell motility and
  cell cycle progression. SHP2 can also link c-MET signaling to the MAPK cascade,
  as sequestration of SHP2 to GAB1 is responsible for extending the duration of MAPK
  phosphorylation. The p85 subunit of PI3K can bind either directly to c-MET or indirectly
  through GAB1, which then signals through AKT/protein kinase B. This axis is primarily
  responsible for the cell survival response to c-MET signaling. Transformation downstream
  of the c-MET receptor is mediated by the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JNK),
  which occurs via binding to CRK. STAT3 has also been implicated in transformation.
  The direct binding of STAT3 to c-MET results in STAT3 phosphorylation, dimerization
  and its translocation to the nucleus. This has been shown to result in tubulogenesis
  and invasion. However, other reports have found that, although STAT3 is required
  for c-MET-mediated tumorigenesis, it has no effect on proliferation, invasion or
  branching morphogenesis. Cellular migration is also mediated downstream of c-MET
  by focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is localized to cellular adhesion complexes.
  FAK is activated through phosphorylation by SRC family kinases, which have been
  shown to directly associate with c-MET. The c-MET–SRC–FAK interaction leads to cell
  migration and the promotion of anchorage-independent growth. Negative regulation
  of the c-MET receptor is crucial for its tightly controlled activity. The Y1003
  site, located in the juxtamembrane domain, is a negative regulatory site for c-MET
  signaling that acts by recruiting c-CBL. Regulation of c-MET signaling is also accomplished
  via its binding to various protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). These PTPs modulate
  c-MET signaling by dephosphorylation of either the tyrosines in the c-MET kinase
  or the docking site. Finally, binding of PLCγ to c-MET results in the activation
  of protein kinase C (PKC), which can then negatively regulate c-MET receptor phosphorylation
  and activity. Independently of PKC activation, an increase in intracellular calcium
  levels can also lead to negative c-MET regulation. Adapted from  and . DAG, diacylglycerol;
