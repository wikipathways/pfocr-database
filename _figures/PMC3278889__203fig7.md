caption: IκB functions. (A) Typical IκB proteins function by promoting cytosolic sequestration
  of NF-κB dimers. Upon stimulation of the canonical signaling pathway, such IκB proteins
  are phosphorylated by IKK and targeted for proteasomal degradation. Activation of
  NF-κB results in resynthesis of IκB proteins. (B) The precursor IκB proteins p100
  and p105 have multiple functions. Their constitutive processing results in the generation
  of p50 and p52 subunits. Unprocessed precursor proteins may, alternatively, form
  complexes with other NF-κB proteins. Proteasomal degradation or processing, in the
  case of p100:RelB complexes, is induced by activation of the noncanonical pathway.
  Proteasomal degradation of p105-containing complexes is mediated by the canonical
  pathway and can result in the activation of both NF-κB and ERK via release of p105-bound
  Tpl2. (C) Atypical IκB proteins are induced by various stimuli, including NF-κB
  activation, and exert both positive and negative effects on NF-κB-mediated transcription.
  Atypical IκB proteins function by binding to nuclear DNA-associated NF-κB dimers.
  In the case of IκBβ, newly synthesized hypophosphorylated IκBβ protein acts to augment
  transcription of p65:c-Rel dimers. BCL-3 may promote or inhibit transcription, depending
  on various PTMs. IκBζ promotes transcription, whereas IκBNS inhibits transcription,
  by binding p50 dimers.
