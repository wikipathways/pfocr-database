caption: '(A) In cells expressing a low level of FAVL (VL), there is perhaps a dynamic
  balance between 2 versions of FANCL protein (L): the free form and the complex form,
  activating the FA-BRCA tumor suppressor pathway and maintaining chromosomal stability.
  (B and C) In cells overexpressing FAVL, this balance may be disturbed, as a result
  of FAVL sequestration of FANCL protein and its enhancement of FANCL turnover. (B)
  The production of the FA complex E3 will be slightly (or not) affected when levels
  of FAVL are high but not beyond a threshold level. (C) However, the production of
  the FA complex E3 will be affected substantially when levels of FAVL exceed the
  threshold level. Both slightly and substantially compromised complex E3 will be
  able to restrain the activation of the FA-BRCA tumor suppressor pathway and, ultimately,
  contribute to chromosomal instability and cancer development within a relatively
  longer or shorter period of time, respectively.'
