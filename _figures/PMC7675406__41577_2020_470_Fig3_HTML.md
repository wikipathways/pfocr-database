caption: a | Dysregulation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) as a
  consequence of the downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) by viral
  binding leads to decreased cleavage of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, resulting
  in elevated vasoconstriction and increased vascular permeability. Viral binding
  also results in endothelial cell damage, endothelial cell activation and thromboinflammation.
  b | Thromboinflammation in blood vessels is driven by the activation of endothelial
  cells and blood monocytes, which increase tissue factor membrane expression. Tissue
  factor is a key driver of thrombin generation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected or damaged endothelial cells, as well as endothelial
  cells stimulated by systemic or locally produced cytokines, upregulate the expression
  of adhesion molecules such as ICAM1 and of monocyte and neutrophil chemoattractants
  such as CXCL1 (not shown) and CCL2. The binding of thrombin to endothelial receptors
  (not shown) mobilizes vesicles containing prestored P-selectin and von Willebrand
  factor (vWF) (not shown), which, in turn, facilitate the recruitment of neutrophils
  and bind to and activate circulating platelets, respectively. The endothelial cell
  damage induced by the virus also exposes endothelial tissue factor, which further
  amplifies platelet deposition and thrombus formation. Moreover, monocytes and neutrophils
  are recruited to the damaged vessels by deposited platelets. Monocyte-derived tissue
  factor-rich microvesicles also activate the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Neutrophils
  recruited by the damaged endothelial cells and platelets can release neutrophil
  extracellular traps (NETs), which activate the intrinsic (contact activation) coagulation
  pathway, leading to massive fibrin deposition and blood clotting. Both neutrophils
  and monocytes express the integrin macrophage 1 antigen (MAC1), which allows them
  to bind to the damaged endothelial cells, activated platelets and deposited fibrin.
