caption: DNA-damaging agents trigger IFN-I/III responses through activation of cGAS/STING
  and TLR3 pathways. DNA-damaging agents cause DNA leakage into cytoplasm as well
  as induce dsRNA formation, leading to the activation of cGAS and TLR3. Also, blebs
  from dying cell containing DNA and dsRNA are captured by dendritic cells and also
  sensitizes cGAS and TLR3 in these cells. These pathways culminate in IFN-I/III production
  by both cells, leading to efficient dendritic cell activation and T cell priming,
  thus enhancing anti-tumor responses. This process mediates the response to genotoxic
  therapies and found the base for their use as adjuvants for ICB therapies. Created
