caption: Schematic model of the AIB calcium response regulated by unc-130. (a) Relationship
  between the ON/OFF stimulus and calcium dynamics in AIB. During stimulation, excitatory/inhibitory
  (E/I) balance from ASHs and AIAs could bias inhibition, leading to ON responses
  (calcium decreases) in AIBs. After stimulation, the ASH OFF response (calcium increase)
  is a possible trigger for the OFF response (calcium increase) in the AIBs. unc-130
  impaired both ON responses and OFF responses (red line). (b) Schematic of the molecules
  used for optimization and the contribution of unc-130 (shown in red). unc-130 is
  necessary for the glutamatergic signaling pathway because it regulates at least
  glr-1, nca-2, and eat-4 expression in the AIBs to cause defects in the calcium response
  and turn optimization dynamics.
