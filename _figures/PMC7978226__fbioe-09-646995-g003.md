caption: Mechanism of Malonyl-CoA sensing in a cell circuit. (A, B) Schematic representation
  of Malonyl-CoA metabolic sensor that shows binding of Malonyl-CoA to C-terminus
  of FapR cascade into a conformation change of N-terminus, FapR-fapO interaction
  is destabilized. (C) The metabolic switch turns on the expression of the Malonyl-CoA
  source pathway (ACC) and turns off the sink pathway (FAS) at a low cellular Malonyl-CoA
  amount. The switch turns on the sink pathway at a high cellular Malonyl-CoA amount
  and turns off the source pathway.
