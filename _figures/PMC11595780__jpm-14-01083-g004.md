caption: The intratumoral microbiota promotes tumorigenesis and tumor progression
  through several mechanisms. Many microbes produce compounds like toxins and ROS
  that can directly cause DNA damage and thus increase mutagenesis. Other microbes
  promote the activation of oncogenic pathways, such as the β-catenin signaling pathway.
  For instance, cytotoxin-associated antigen A (CagA) produced by H. pylori, FadA
  produced by F. nucleatum, Btf produced by B. fragilis, and AvrA produced by S. typhi
  interact with E-cadherin or β-catenin enhancing the abnormal proliferation of cancer
  cells. Intratumoral microorganisms also influence cytokine production, inducing
  a proinflammatory response and inhibiting the immune response. Finally, the activation
  of β-catenin induces the nuclear translocation of the β-catenin/T-cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer factor family (TCF/LEF) complex, which promotes the transcription of different
  tumorigenic genes
