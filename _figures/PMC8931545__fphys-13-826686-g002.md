caption: The role of proinflammatory cytokines and angiotensin II (Ang II) in the
  paraventricular nuclear (PVN) during acute kidney injury (AKI). The systemic inflammatory
  response to AKI leads to an increase in central nervous system (CNS) pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. Both Ang II and pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulate NAD(P)H oxidase
  activity and activate the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to further cytokine synthesis
  and Ang II binding to the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor, creating positive feedback
  loops. The activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway also leads to an increase in
  norepinephrine (NE) release, promoting sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity,
  further exacerbating kidney injury.
