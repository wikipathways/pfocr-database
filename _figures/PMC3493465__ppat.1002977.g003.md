caption: (A) Schematic showing the insect PO cascade and the known mode of action
  of Egf1.0. Infection by different pathogens and external wounding both trigger activation
  of the PO cascade. Proteins in the haemolymph known as humoral pattern recognition
  receptors (PRRs) bind to factors on the surface of different pathogens. This interaction
  as well as external wounding trigger the activation of multiple serine proteases.
  Some of these proteases have been identified in different insect species, whereas
  others remain unknown. Activation of these proteases leads to activation of prophenoloxidase
  activating proteases (proPAPs to PAPs). Some PAPs also require serine protease homologs
  (SPHs) for function, which are themselves activated by upstream serine proteases.
  PAPs cleave proPO (also called PPO) to PO, which oxidizes mono- and diphenolic substrates
  to quinones that undergo further reactions to form melanin. A number of these intermediate
  products are cytotoxic including some that have also been shown to inactivate viruses
  (see Text). Serine protease inhibitors called serpins have been identified from
  different species of insects that inhibit PAPs or other proteases in the pathway.
  In the absence of wounding or infection, the reducing agent glutathione (GSH) also
  exists in haemolymph at concentrations that can inhibit melanisation by recycling
  quinones to diphenols. The inhibitor Egf1.0 from MdBV inhibits both the processing
  of proPAPs and PAPs that have already been activated. (B) Alignment of the reactive
  site loop of Egf1.0 to the predicted cleavage sites for the PPOs encoded by Ae.
  aegypti (indicated as AedAePPO). Note the identical P1–P1′ residues R-F (underlined)
  of Egf1.0 and PPO family members. Black highlighting indicates identical residues.
