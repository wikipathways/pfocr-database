caption: Treatment of ovarian cancer cell lines with Cisplatin results in the activation
  of the Erk pathway and subsequent induction of Snail expression and induction of
  EMT. By contrast, Resveratrol prevents Cisplatin-mediated EMT induction by antagonizing
  the activation of the Erk pathway, thus preventing Snail levels increase and EMT
  induction. Furthermore, Resveratrol could also prevent Cisplatin-induced EMT through
  induction of a senescence program that would block the progression of other cellular
  differentiation programs like EMT.
