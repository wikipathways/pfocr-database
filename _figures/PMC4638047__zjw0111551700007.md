caption: Pathway analysis highlights APP is a central hub interacting with nearly
  40% of candidate molecules in EGS. This interaction network (comprising aspects
  of cell–cell signaling and interaction, nervous system development, and small molecule
  biochemistry) involves 38% of IPA viable candidates with modified expression in
  EGS. Proteins within this network identified as being modified in EGS CCG are indicated
  using adjacent circles (red, up-regulated in EGS; green, down-regulated in EGS;
  clear, absent from our dataset but integral to the network). Solid connecting lines
  indicate a direct interaction, and dashed connecting lines indicate an indirect
  interaction. Blue connecting lines represent the highlighted interactions of APP.
  All suggested indirect interactions were confirmed manually using Ingenuity Pathways
  Analysis software to identify published evidence indicating an interaction between
  the two proteins.
