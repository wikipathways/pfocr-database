caption: Models depicting consequences of PNH-related mutations on NEDD4L stability
  and PI3K/Akt/mTOR and TGF-β/Smad pathways. (a) WT NEDD4L (on the left) is shown
  in its closed and inactive conformation, and NEDD4L mutant (on the right) with an
  alteration in the HECT domain predicted to lead to conformation changes that favours
  transition from inactive to open active state and triggers auto-ubiquitination and
  degradation. (b) Overview of observed deregulations in basal conditions resulting
  from an excess of WT NEDD4L (on the left) and expression PNH-related NEDD4L mutants
  (on the right). Red contours indicate deregulated proteins and dotted arrows depict
  indirect and poorly understood relations between partners of signaling pathways.
papertitle: Mutations in the HECT domain of NEDD4L lead to AKT/mTOR pathway deregulation
  and cause periventricular nodular heterotopia.
