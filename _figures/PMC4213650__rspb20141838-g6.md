caption: Metabolic pathways for B vitamin biosynthesis in the genome of C. glomerans.
  Each arrow represents one step in the biosynthetic pathway. Enzyme names in green
  font indicate that a candidate gene for this step was detected in the annotated
  genome sequence. Enzyme names in blue indicate that a candidate gene for this step
  was detected in the host's genome (see figures a and a).
