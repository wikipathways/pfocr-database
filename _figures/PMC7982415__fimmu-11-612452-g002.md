caption: TLR-mediated signaling pathway. The activation of TLR (toll like receptor)
  1–2, 4–6, or 10 by lipids, lipoproteins or membrane-anchored proteins and the activation
  of TLR7-9, 11–13 by virus-derived nucleic acids induce the dimerization of TLRs
  and the recruitment of Myd88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88) and IRAKs via homotypic
  interaction domains, forming the Myddosome. IRAKs catalyze phosphorylation cascade
  leading to the recruitment of TRAF6 [tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated
  factor 6]. In turn, TRAF6 promotes the activation by proximity of TAK1 (tumor growth
  factor-β-activated kinase 1)/TAB1-3 (transforming growth factor-activated kinase1-binding
  protein 1, 2, and 3) and the IKK (Inhibitor of κB kinase) complexes that result
  in the activation of MAPK (Mitogen-activated protein kinases), NF-κB (nuclear factor-kappa
  B)-signaling pathways, and pro-inflammatory response. TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation
  induces the recruitment of TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β) through
  a TIR-TIR homotypic interaction. The adaptor TRAM (Trif-related adaptor molecule)
  serves as a bridge between TLR4 and TRIF. In turn TRIF can recruit TRAF3 that engages
  IFN (Interferon) response, TRAF6 that leads to MAPK and NF-κB activation, or the
  kinases RIP (Receptor Interacting Protein) 1 and/or RIP3. When poly-ubiquitinated,
  RIP1 can recruit TAK1/TAB1-3 and IKK complexes and activates the pro-inflammatory
  response. In a non-ubiquitinated form, RIP1 can assemble with FADD and caspase-8
  to form the ripoptosome that leads to caspase cascade activation and apoptotic cell
  death or can activate RIP3 in the necrosome. RIP3 catalyzes the activating phosphorylation
  of MLKL, which oligomerizes and translocates into the plasma membrane to form pores
  and induces necroptosis. The DAI (DNA-dependent activator of IRFs) can also directly
  recruit RIP3 via RHIM homotypic interaction to induce MLKL phosphorylation and necroptosis
  in response to virus-derived nucleic acids. The necrosome has also the ability to
  induce ROS (Reactive oxygen species) production resulting in NLRP3 (NOD (Nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain)-like receptor protein) inflammasome and pyroptosis (details
  of pyroptosis available in ). The TLR-mediated production of TNF-α can induce an
  autocrine stimulation of TNFR1 that can lead to RIP1 engagement and an amplification
  of the signal.
