caption: The biosynthetic pathway of isoleucine in the E. coli auxotroph JHM544 (shaded).
  The pathway was engineered to allow Ile autotrophy by integrating ACC deaminase
  into the genome, yielding an E. coli named JAde 6, which can metabolize ACC synthesized
  when transformed with ACC synthase.
