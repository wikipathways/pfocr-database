caption: Schematic representation of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)-induced apoptosis
  in DU145 human prostate cancer cells. The apoptosis was triggered through extrinsic
  pathway by up-regulating tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
  (TRAIL) receptor, death receptor 4 (DR4) and death receptor 5 (DR5). As well as
  through intrinsic pathway by modulating Bax and Bcl-xL levels and cytochrome c release
  (→ indicates activation, ⇢ indicates indirect or multiple pathways, ↑ indicates
  up-regulation, and ↓ indicates down-regulation).
