caption: AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling pathway. Exercise changes the energy status,
  consuming a large amount of ATP, which elevates AMP-to-ATP ratio. Consequently,
  AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling pathway is activated. PGC-1α is very important in the
  anabolic process of exercise-induced response. PGC-1α and PPAR/ERR form co-transcriptional
  complexes that initiate the overexpression of target genes, thereby promoting tissue
  regeneration and repair, including neurogenesis, myogenesis, and osteogenesis. Created
