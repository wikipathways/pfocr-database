caption: The TGF-β signaling pathway is outlined in thick gray lines, whereas the
  endosomal recycling pathway and lipid rafts-caveolae degradation pathway are indicated
  by green and blue lines, respectively. Binding of ligand stabilizes the heteromeric
  complex of TβRII and TβRI receptors, resulting in activation of TβRI through phosphorylation
  of its GS domain by TβRII. R-Smads are then activated by TβRI with SARA as scaffold,
  and form trimeric complexes with Smad4 that translocate into the nucleus, where
  they direct transcription responses of target genes. Activated receptor complexes
  are also internalized through lipid rafts and caveolae, where they are poly-ubiquitylated
  by E3 ubiquitin ligases recruited by Smad7 and destined for degradation. Various
  regulators of functional TGF-β receptor complexes are schematically shown. Inhibitory
  mechanisms are listed in a red box with blunt-headed lines, whereas those that enhance
  the complexes formation are listed in a green box with arrows.
