caption: d-Arap and l-fucose pathways in Leishmania and trypanosomes. A, L. major.
  Known metabolic steps (referenced in this paper or established by this work) are
  depicted with solid arrows. d-Arap is known to be synthesized de novo, but the steps
  have not been determined as yet; both d-Arap and l-fucose can be taken up, but the
  specific carrier(s) has not been established. The presence of fucosyltransferase
  acting in various cellular compartments is shown in this work, but the specific
  enzymes and product conjugates remain to be determined. The salvage pathway to GDP-fucose
  is absent in T. brucei but present in T. cruzi and humans. B, the two enzymes comprising
  the de novo pathway for synthesis of GDP-fucose from GDP-mannose. This pathway is
  absent in Leishmania but present in T. brucei as well as T. cruzi and humans. C,
  the structures of d-arapyranose and l-fucose. The difference between them is circled.
