caption: Working model of FH physiopathology and the effects of CoQ. First, LDL-C
  uptake is impaired, due to LDL-R mutations, provoking high levels of LDL-C in the
  blood. At the cellular level, poor extracellular cholesterol uptake will also result
  in dysregulated mevalonate pathway, which leads to cholesterol accumulation and
  secondary CoQ deficiency. Intracellular cholesterol accumulation is associated with
  SREBP-2 activation and increased HMGCR and cholesterogenic enzymes expression levels.
  As a consequence, CoQ biosynthesis, the other main sub-branch of the mevalonate
  pathway, is defective inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, impaired
  autophagy flux and inflammasome activation. Interestingly, all these alterations
  are also involved in cell senescence. CoQ treatment can correct both altered mevalonate
  pathway and mitochondrial dysfunction in FH fibroblasts. CoQ causes a significant
  increased expression of LDL-R and ABCA1 accompanied by downregulation of PCSK9,
  as well as AMPK and PPAR-α activation. In addition, CoQ restores INSIG1 and INSIG2
  expression levels (involved in intracellular cholesterol sensing) and allows the
  normal feedback inhibition of SREBP-2 activation when cholesterol levels are high.
  The beneficial effects of CoQ on mitochondrial function can also be attributed to
  CoQ biosynthetic pathway up-regulation. ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transports A1;
