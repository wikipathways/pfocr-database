caption: Butyrate pathway in the recombinant E. coli strains used in this study. In
  this proposed pathway, xylose is transported by the ABC transporter (XylFGH) and
  glucose is transported by its PTS system. PPP, pentose-phosphate pathway; PFL, pyruvate

  T. denticola. Other enzymes are from E. coli. The native pathways of anaerobically
  growing E. coli at the pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate node and the mutations (marked
  by “X”) in strain BEM9 are listed in the boxed area. PFL, another native enzyme
  at the pyruvate node catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, the starting
