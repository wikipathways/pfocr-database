caption: Model for Induction of the HR and Resistance to TCV.Inoculation of TCV on
  resistant Arabidopsis results in an HR at the point of inoculation and the accumulation
  of SA (). Development of the HR is mediated by the dominant HRT gene. Resistance
  is regulated by HRT and a second gene, RRT. The product of the dominant RRT allele
  or alleles present in susceptible ecotypes may act as a suppressor (T-bars) of the
  HRT-mediated resistance pathway downstream of SA and HR. Alternately, the protein
  encoded by the recessive rrt allele in Di-17 may directly or indirectly interact
  with HRT or a component downstream in the HRT-mediated defense pathway to facilitate
  transduction of the signal leading to TCV resistance. Although HRT is required for
  resistance, it is unclear if the HR is necessary also (question marks). Initiation
  of the HR and the signaling steps leading to resistance are blocked (T-bars) in
  plants expressing the nahG gene encoding salicylate hydroxylase. SA-mediated signaling
  leading to PR-1 expression is transduced by both NPR1-dependent and NPR1-independent
  pathways, which are blocked by the expression of nahG. The NPR1-dependent pathway,
  utilized for the activation of resistance to some bacterial and fungal pathogens,
  is not required for the HR or resistance to TCV. Ethylene- or JA-mediated signaling
  that leads to PDF1.2 expression and resistance to some fungal and bacterial pathogens
  is not necessary for the HR or resistance to TCV because mutations resulting in
  insensitivity to ethylene (etr1-1) or JA (coi1-1) do not affect either of these
  phenotypes. Thus, the pathways required for resistance to TCV differ from those
  for bacterial or fungal pathogens.
