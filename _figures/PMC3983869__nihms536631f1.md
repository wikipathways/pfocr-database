caption: β-Catenin is a multifunctional protein that localizes at cell-cell contacts,
  the nucleus, cytosol and centrosomes. Cortical proteins and Wnt signaling components
  have been implicated in regulating cell cycle progression. Additionally, β-catenin
  destruction pathway proteins (APC, Axin, GSK3β) are also located at the centrosome
  and are involved in similar functions as β-catenin suggesting a cross-talk between
  these 3 distinct cellular pools of proteins.
