caption: a Magnesium chloride (MgCl2) solution and alendronate sodium (ALN) solution
  were mixed and subjected to a hydrothermal reaction (120 °C, 24 h) to obtain Mg-ALN,
  which was then incorporated into catechol- and amine-rich highly branched gelatin/dialdehyde
  starch networks to synthesise Mg-ALN hydrogel bone adhesive (Mg-ALN@Gel), where
  Mg2+ in Mg-ALN enhanced the cross-linking network of Schiff base-bonded hydrogel.
  Mg-ALN@Gel was injected locally into a rat model of osteoporotic fracture, and Mg-ALN@Gel
  responded to the acidic microenvironment of osteoporosis and then degraded through
  Schiff base bonds, releasing Mg-ALN and promoting osteoporotic fracture repair.
  b Long-term ALN treatment induces the secretion of sclerostin (SOST) in BMSCs and
  increases the expression of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) to activate fibroblasts
  aberrantly. Mg-ALN target the fracture end and acidity-response releases Mg2+ and
  ALN. The Mg2+ can competitively bind to SOST and attenuate the SOST/TGF-β signaling
  pathway, inhibiting fibrogenic differentiation and subsequent disordered mineralization
