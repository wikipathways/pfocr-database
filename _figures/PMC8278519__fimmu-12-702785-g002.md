caption: Diversity of macrophages’ phenotypes. (A) Monocytes can be differentiated
  in vitro either in pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages or in anti-inflammatory
  M2-like macrophages upon various external stimuli. M1-like macrophages are involved
  in microbicidal and tumoricidal activities. M2-like macrophages have pro-resolving
  functions and are involved in tissue repair. In cancer settings, TAM, associated
  to a M2-like phenotype, support tumor progression and mitigate tumor response to
  anticancer treatments through production of proteases, angiogenic and growth factors.
  (B) During efferocytosis of apoptotic cells, macrophages undergo a reprogramming
  toward a pro-resolving phenotype. Macrophages receive an important metabolic load
  from these engulfed cells that induce metabolic modifications such as activation
  of the putrescine pathway or increased glycolysis that supports actin polymerization
  and cell clearance. Pro-resolving macrophages express 12/15-LOX and turn off production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines for production of IL-10, TGF-β and IFN-β that participate
  in inflammation resolution.
