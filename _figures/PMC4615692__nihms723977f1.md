caption: Cholesterol is the common precursor for bile acid synthesis via two major
  bile acid biosynthetic pathways. In the classic pathway, the rate-limiting enzyme
  cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in the endoplasmic reticulum converts cholesterol
  into 7α-hydroxycholesterol. The 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD, HSD3B7)
  converts 7α-hydroxycholesterol to 7α-hydroxy-4 cholesten-3-one (C4). C4 can be converted
  to cholic acid (CA) which requires the sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1). Without
  12α-hydroxylation by CYP8B1, C4 is eventually converted to chenodeoxycholic acid
  (CDCA). In the classic pathway, the mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1)
  catalyzes the steroid side-chain oxidation in both CA and CDCA synthesis. In the
  alternative pathway, CYP27A1 catalyzes the first step to convert cholesterol to
  27-hydroxycholesterol. Oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) catalyzes hydroxylation
  of 27-hydroxycholesterol to 3β, 7α-dihydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid, which eventually
  is converted to CDCA. In the large intestine, bacterial 7α-dehydroxylase removes
  a hydroxyl group from C-7 and converts CA to deoxycholic acid (DCA) and CDCA to
  lithocholic acid (LCA). In mouse liver, most of CDCA is converted to α- and β-muricholic
  acid (MCA).
