caption: Neurotrophins show ligand specificity for Trk receptors, and activate intracellular
  signaling cascades, including Ras/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and PLCγ to alter neuronal survival,
  growth and neuroplasticity. Trk receptor activation results in the recruitment of
  Src homology domain-containing protein (Shc) and PLCγ to the intracellular domain.
  Localization of Shc to the receptor site recruits growth factor receptor bound protein
  2 (Grb 2), which recruits the intermediary proteins Sos and GAB1 to activate the
  Ras/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, respectively. Upon activation, the Ras/ERK, PI3K/AKT,
  and PLCγ signaling pathways can activate other signaling pathways, as well as nuclear
  factors. In addition, all neurotrophins can bind to p75 to activate the Jun N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) or nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) intracellular signaling cascades responsible
  for neuronal fate and apoptosis. P75 receptor activation recruits receptor interacting
  protein 2 (RIP2) and tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 4/6 (TRAF4/6).
  Depending on context, neurotrophins binding to the p75 receptor can activate either
  the NFκB pathway to promote survival and augment Trk effects, or the JNK pathway
  to promote apoptosis and antagonize the effects of Trk receptors. For additional
  details on neurotrophin ligand-receptor signaling, see reviews by , , .
