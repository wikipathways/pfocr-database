caption: The pathogenesis of COVID-19, showing the involvement of components of the
  fibrinolytic system in various steps. From the left, the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin-system
  (RAAS) pathway is shown. Plasmin and other proteases, trypsin and TMPRSS2 act on
  the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to facilitate its binding to ACE2 on the surface of
  host cells. With the binding, the virus invades the host cells while ACE2 is internalized
  and unable to process the breakdown of angiotensin II, leading to its excess. The
  excess of angiotensin II leads to an increase in PAI-1 and decreased fibrinolysis,
  creating a hypercoagulable state, while the excess of angiotensin II binds to its
  receptor angiotensin II receptor 1a, causing lung injury and leading to pulmonary
  edema with the formation of a hyaline membrane with fibrin in the alveoli. This
  is broken down by plasmin with the formation of D-dimer. The diffuse alveolar damage
  with damaged type II alveolar cells leads to decreased surfactant, which results
  in induction of the p53 pathway and increased in PAI-1. Of note (on the left), platelets
  are activated by angiotensin 1–9 and by other pathways. They then release PAI-1
  into the circulation. There is also an acute inflammatory response with multi-organ
  injury. Inflammatory cytokines activate factor XII leading to bradykinin formation
  and a subsequent increase in tPA.
