caption: The miRNAs in magenta and cyan circles respectively represent the conserved
  and novel miRNAs. Genes in yellow diamonds are clock genes and those involved in
  growth and development regulation. The regulatory network of miRNAs and their target
  genes for the circadian rhythm in G. molesta are linked with blue lines.
