caption: 'Role metformin in AD: Metformin by activating PP2 A and inhibiting of GSK3β
  attenuates the development and progression of AD. Metformin by its anti-inflammatory,
  antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects attenuates neurodegeneration in AD. As well,
  metformin inhibits neurotoxicity by reducing different signaling pathways such as
  NF-κB and MC-LR'
