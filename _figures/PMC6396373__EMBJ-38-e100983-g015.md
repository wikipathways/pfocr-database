caption: Upon stimulation with DNA or by viral infection, the pattern recognition
  receptor (PRR) cGAS produces the second messenger 2′3′‐cGAMP, which binds to the
  ER‐resident protein STING. STING then dimerizes and translocates from the ER to
  the Golgi, from where it activates the signaling pathway leading to induction of
  type I IFN via the kinase TBK1 and the IRF3 transcription factor. cGAS‐STING signaling
  also induces activation of the NF‐κB transcription factor, leading to proinflammatory
  cytokine expression, but from which subcellular compartment this signaling pathway
  is initiated is not understood.The viral type I membrane protein m152 is expressed
  immediately after MCMV infection. m152 binds STING in the ER via their respective
  luminal domains and traffics with STING to the Golgi. In the presence of m152, trafficking
  of STING is delayed, leading to a reduced type I IFN, but intact NF‐κB, response.
  Mutation of K288 in STING results in a STING mutant that cannot leave the ER and
  thereby cannot activate the type I IFN response, but is still able to induce the
  NF‐κB pathway. These results suggest that STING induces the NF‐κB pathway from the
  ER, prior to its trafficking to the Golgi.
