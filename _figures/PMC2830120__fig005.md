caption: Aβ induces cell death through the activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,
  as well as through other receptors. Several different signaling cascades, including
  the ERK/MAPK pathway and the JNK pathway, have been implicated in the actions of
  Aβ. Aβ also activates AKT and controls the activity of apoptotic proteins, including
  BAD, BAX, and BCL2. In addition to apoptosis, these pathways also often induce hyperphosphorylation
  of the tau microtubule protein, providing a link between Aβ-activation of nAChRs
  and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. The concentration and time course
  of Aβ exposure can determine which of these pathways is activated. In addition,
  several pathways through which nicotine protects cells from Aβ toxicity have been
  identified, including the JAK-2/STAT-3 pathway, in which nAChR-mediated activation
  of Janus kinase 2 is transduced into STAT-3 activation; the PI3K/AKT pathway, which
  results in inhibition of apoptosis; and the ERK/MAPK pathway, which is activated
  by the Ras/Raf cascade and controls gene expression through c-Myc. There are also
  direct actions of nicotine on mitochondrial function as well as on the aggregation
  of Aβ.
