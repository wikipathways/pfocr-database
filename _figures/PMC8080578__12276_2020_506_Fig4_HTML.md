caption: In normal cells, STAT2 protein levels are maintained at low levels. When
  cells are stimulated by UV, especially UVB, GSK3α/β phosphorylates STAT2 at the
  DBD, which recruits the SCFFBXW7 complex to form the SCFFBXW7–STAT2 complex. FBXW7
  catalyzes K48 STAT2 polyubiquitination, resulting in a reduction in STAT2 protein
  levels via the proteasomal degradation pathway. Thus, cell proliferation at the
  acute stage is initially suppressed after UVB irradiation. However, in cancer cells
  with FBXW7 mutation(s), higher STAT2 protein levels are sustained compared to that
  of normal cells, resulting in the induction of cell proliferation.
