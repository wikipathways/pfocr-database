caption: A schematic diagram shows that tumor-derived ESM1 combines with the c-Met
  expressed by endothelial cells to promote GC peritoneal metastasis by inducing angiogenesis.
  The function of ESM1 on angiogenesis is through interacting with c-Met, thus activating
  the MAPK/ERK pathway, which can promote the proliferation, migration, and tube formation
  of ECs
