caption: (A) Structure of the repressor–operator complex. Cartoon representation of
  a single repressor dimer bound to a single met-box operator (framework model) within
  the higher-order complex (PDB code 1CMA) []. The positions of the mutated protein
  side chains analysed here are shown as stick models (one labelled) on a ribbon backbone
  of a single repressor dimer (chains in light and dark grey). AdoMet is omitted for
  clarity. (B) Architecture of well-known met promoters of E. coli, based on data
  from []. The positions of the promoters for the genes labelled are indicated by
  open boxes. Arrowheads show the positions of the start codons and the direction
  of transcription. Note the multiple promoters for metA and metJ, some of which do
  not overlap operators. Note also the multiple operator sites for metE. (C) The biosynthetic
  pathway for methionine showing the gene product operating at each step, based on
  data from [].
