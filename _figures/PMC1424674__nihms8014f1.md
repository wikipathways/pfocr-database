caption: The enzymatic activity of the products of PseB (Cj1293) and PseC (Cj1294)
  have been described in Schoenhofen et al. 2005 and that of PseI (Cj1317c) by . Broken
  arrows indicate biosynthetic steps for which the respective enzymatic activities
  have still to be assigned to a campylobacter gene. The presumed activity of PseF
  is based on homology to the corresponding enzyme in the sialic acid biosynthetic
  pathway, NeuA ().
