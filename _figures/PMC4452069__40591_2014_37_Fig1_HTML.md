caption: 'The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade. Simplified schemata of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling cascade. While indisputable involved at several levels, directly as well
  as indirectly with cell survival, other important functions of this signaling network
  are also highlighted here. Key molecules which have been implicated in cancer or
  have been selected as potential therapeutic targets are: 1. Receptor tyrosine kinases,
  such as EGFR, IGFR and ALK, often overexpressed or activated by mutations in many
  different cancers, including glioblastoma and neuroblastoma. These transmembrane
  proteins are apical of several interconnected signaling cascades. 2. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3''-OH kinase, a lipid kinase, predominately consisting of a p110 catalytic and
  a p85 regulatory subunit, of which the former has been found to be mutationally
  activated in certain cancers. 3. PTEN, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate
  [PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3] phosphatase and tensin homologue, is a phosphatase that counters
  PI3K-mediated phosphorylation and as such functions as a negative regulator of the
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade. It is among the most frequently inactivated, either
  by mutation or promoter methylation, proteins in cancer. 4. The serine/threonine
  kinase Akt, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue (Protein Kinase B), is
  often considered the central downstream mediator of PI3K signaling, as it phosphorylates
  a diverse array of targets that are involved in all key functions of this pathway.
  5. mTOR, mammalian target of Rapamycin, depending on its complex partners, can either
  be up- or downstream of Akt. It is frequently found to be associated with the process
  of autophagy, which depending on the context, can be either a survival strategy
  or a form of cell death. (modified from []).'
