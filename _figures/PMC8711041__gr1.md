  activities acting on benzoate and its fluorine (F)-substituted derivatives 2-FBz,
  3-FBz, and 4-FBz. Positive transcriptional regulation by BenR and CatR in P. putida
  is indicated with a “+” symbol. Enzymes participating in the conversion of 3-FBz
  to 2-FMA are identified by their corresponding EC numbers.(B) Chromosomal organization
  of genes encoding the ortho-cleavage pathway. BenABC, benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase;
