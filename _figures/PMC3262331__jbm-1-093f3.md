caption: 'Schematic signaling pathway mediated by the L-CBM complex in NK cells.Notes:
  The L-CBM complex acts in the canonical NF-κB activation pathway through activating
  NK cell receptors (NKR) such as Ly49H, Ly49D, NK1.1, NKG2D, FcγRIII, etc. L-CBM
  might regulate MAPK activation through activating NKR, although this notion remains
  controversial. Similar to T cells, PKCθ activity is required for NF-κB activation
  through activating NKR. IL-18R-MyD88-mediated NF-κB activation does not require
  L-CBM in NK cells. While the PKCθ-L-CBM signaling is essential to cytokine/chemokine
  production, it is not necessary for cytotoxicity.'
