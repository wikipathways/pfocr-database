caption: 'Schematic of metabolic building blocks within the sphingolipid pathway and
  their subcellular localization. The sphingolipid pathway can be schematically organized
  in different blocks which represent both metabolic nodes and subcellular compartments.
  The first steps of the de novo sphingolipid metabolism occur in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) to form ceramide (reactions in blue). Ceramide then gets transported
  to the Golgi via CERT1 or vesicular trafficking. In the Golgi, complex sphingolipids
  are produced (reactions in black) and are then transported to the plasma membrane.
  In the plasma membrane, ceramide can be converted into either sphingosine or sphingomyelin
  (SM) and vice versa (reactions in green). Sphingosine in the plasma membrane can
  also be converted into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) by plasma membrane-associated
  sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1). S1P at the plasma membrane can then be transported in
  the extracellular space by dedicated proteins such as Spinster homologue 2. From
  the plasma membrane, sphingolipids are recycled into the endo/lysosomal pathway
  where they are progressively broken down to form sphingosine (reactions in red).
  Lysosomal sphingosine can either 1) re-enter sphingolipid synthesis via conversion
  into ceramide (and eventually complex sphingolipids) or 2) be converted into (S1P).
  S1P can then be irreversibly broken down by the S1P lyase into ethanolamine-1-phosphate
  and hexadecenal with the only known exit reaction from the sphingolipid pathway.
  In addition to ER, Golgi, PM and lysosomes, evidence indicate the existence of discreet
  sphingolipid metabolic nodes in the mitochondria and nuclei. Abbreviations used
  are defined in the main text. CPTP: the recently identified C1P transfer protein.
  The dashed arrow from C1P to ceramide indicate a step not well characterized'
