  description: NRF2-signalling-based therapeutic strategies in brain dysfunctions.
    Targeting NRF2 pathway in brain diseases appears as a promising therapeutic strategy.
    Different options exist depending on the context (cancer (A), ageing (B), and
    neurodegenerative diseases (C)), NRF2 levels, and the cells to target (neuronal
    or glial cells). NRF2 and NRF2-negative regulators (KEAP1, BACH1, BACH2) can be
    targeted in these different conditions. The emergence of senotherapeutic drugs
    (senolytics, senomorphics) coupled to epigenetic modifiers (inhibitors/activators
    of histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases, histone demethylases, and
    histone methyltransferases) could provide a great number of translational opportunities
    and thus contribute to improving human health.
