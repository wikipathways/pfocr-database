caption: E3 ubiquitin ligases inhibit asthma pathology. The E3 enzyme F-box and leucine-rich
  repeat protein 19 (FBXL19) plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the ubiquitinating
  degradation of ST2L, thereby effectively suppressing Interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion.
  Concurrently, Tripartite -motif protein 21 (TRIM21) acts as an essential mediator
  in the ubiquitinating degradation of Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel
  Subfamily M Member 2 (TRPM2), leading to the inhibition of inflammatory cytokine
  secretion and macrophage production. Notably, E3 enzymes peroxisome proliferators-activated
  receptor γ (PPARγ), Casitas B lymphoma-b (Cbl-b), and Cullin-5 (CUL5) collaborate
  to mediate the ubiquitinating degradation of Signal Transducer and Activator of
  Transcription 6 (STAT6). The activation of the PPARγ signaling pathway results in
  the downregulation of IgE secretion, while Cbl-b and CUL5contribute to the reduction
  of T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation. ITCH, another crucial E3 enzyme, exerts
  its influence by facilitating the ubiquitinating degradation of both STAT6 and GATA
  Binding Protein 3 (GATA3). This dual degradation process leads to a decrease in
  Interleukin-4 (IL-4) secretion and Th2 differentiation. Furthermore, the E3 enzyme
  Cullin 4b (CUL4B) intervenes in the ubiquitinating degradation of H2Ak19, effectively
  inhibiting Th2 cell differentiation. Additionally, F-box and WD repeat domain-containing
  7 (FBW7), acting as an E3 enzyme, engages in the ubiquitinating degradation of GATA
  Binding Protein (GATA), thereby suppressing Th2 cell differentiation and eosinophil
  production. The regulatory protein, An E3 ubiquitin ligase gene related to anergy
  in lymphocytes (GRAIL) assumes a central role in mediating the ubiquitinating degradation
  of CUL5. This action promotes Interleukin-2 (IL-2) activation mediated by phosphorylated
  Janus kinase (pJAK1), ultimately enhancing Treg activation and, consequently, inhibiting
  inflammation. The E3 enzyme Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS1) plays a crucial
  role in mediating the ubiquitinating degradation of Insulin Receptor Substrate 2
  (IRS-2), leading to a reduction in phosphorylated IRS-2 levels and ultimately inhibiting
  M2 macrophage polarization. Moreover, the E3 enzyme PARK exerts inhibitory effects
  on the secretion of inflammatory cytokines Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Interleukin-13
  (IL-13), mediated by House Dust Mite (HDM). This inhibition is achieved through
  the ubiquitinating degradation of NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated
  protein 3 (NLRP3). Collectively, these intricate molecular interactions culminate
  in the inhibition of inflammation, contributing to the attenuation of asthma’s course
  and progression
