caption: 'Simplified description of the insulin/IGF-1 signal transduction (IIS) pathway
  in invertebrates and mammals. In the invertebrate C.elegans, multiple insulin/IGF-1
  like ligands (INS1–38) bind to a single common receptor (DAF-2). After ligand binding,
  the signal is transduced from the activated receptor, either directly or via the
  insulin receptor substrate homolog protein-1 (IST-1) to the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI-3K) AGE-1 (ageing alteration-1)/AAP-1 [], which converts phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Elevated
  levels of the second messenger PIP3 activate the 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein
  kinase-1 (PDK1) and the protein kinases B (PKB1-2 also known as AKT1–2), thus leading
  to the phosphorylation of DAF-16, a homolog of mammalian FoxO family of transcription
  factors by PKB1–2/AKT1–2. In mammals, three different insulin/IGF-1 receptor ligands
  are present: insulin, IGF-1 and IGF-2, which can bind to the insulin receptor isoforms
  A or B (IRA–B) or the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Upon ligand binding, activated insulin
  or IGF-1 receptors phosphorylate several intracellular substrates, including IR
  substrates (IRS1–4) and the Src-homology-2-containing protein (Shc). The phosphorylated
  substrates provide specific docking sites for intracellular effectors, including
  the p85 regulatory subunit of PI-3K and Growth-factor-receptor-bound protein-2 (Grb2).
  PI-3K converts PIP2 in the second messenger PIP3. Elevated levels of the second
  messenger activate PDK1 and PKB1–3 (also known as AKT1–3), which culminates, amongst
  others, in the phosphorylation the mammalian FoxO family of transcription factor
  members Foxo1a, 3a, 4, 6. Grb2 recruits the GDP/GTP exchange factor Son-of-Sevenless
  (SOS), upon which the small G-protein Ras is converted in its active conformation,
  leading to the activation of successively the intracellular kinases Raf (part of
  the family of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinases), Mitogen activated
  protein kinase/Extracellular-signal-regulated-Kinase kinases MEK1–2 (part of the
  family of MAPK kinases) and Extracellular-signal-Regulated-Kinases ERK1–2 (part
  of the family of MAPKs), culminating in the activation of transcription, amongst
  others, via the transcription factor ELK1 (member of ETS oncogene family).'
