caption: RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling pathway. Wthin PAEcs and PASMCs, Rho-Rho kinase
  can be activated by several pathological mediators, including angiotensin II (Ang
  II), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Rho-Rho kinase activation
  leads to inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCPh) and subsequently vasoconstriction.
  Rho-Rho kinase also contributes to endothelial dysfunction through negative regulation
  of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
  activity causing reduced NO bioavailability.
