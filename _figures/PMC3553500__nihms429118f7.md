caption: After TNF stimulation through TNFR, GAPDH is induced to the TRAF2 complex,
  promoting TRAF2 polyubiquitination and activating the NF-κB pathway through IKK.
  Drug treatments and mutagenesis studies show that this recruitment is dependent
  upon GAPDH enzyme activity. During infection, NleB binds GAPDH and modifies it with
  O-GlcNAc. O-GlcNAcylated GAPDH is unable to bind TRAF2, reducing downstream NF-κB
  activation. NleB(AAA) is deficient in O-GlcNAc transferase activity and unable to
  inhibit GAPDH binding to TRAF2. Whether NleB directly impacts host cell metabolic
  pathways and the identification of other substrates for its O-GlcNAcylation activity
  remain to be determined.
