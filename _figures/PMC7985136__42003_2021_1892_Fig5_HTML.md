caption: Shown are genes, which we found co-expressed in the QCM (orange color) and
  in other queen modules (greenish color) across the nutrient-sensing pathways (i)
  IIS and (ii) TOR, (iii) neuro-hormonal regulation of metabolic processes, (iv) JH
  signaling (including trehalose transport) (upper part), (v) CHC production, and
  (vi) vitellogenesis. The left part of the figure depicts gene regulatory pathways
  related to neuroendocrine and IIS/TOR signaling while the right parts concentrate
  on fecundity- and CHC-related processes. Both parts are connected by transport processes
  via the hemolymph. The general gene and pathway relationships are based on studies
  of D. melanogaster, mosquitos, nonsocial cockroaches and social insects (for details,
  see main text). Circles/double bars represent genes, squares represent gene ‘clusters’,
  arrows indicate activation, and stop bars denote repression. Solid versus dashed
  lines represent direct versus supposed indirect interactions requiring further investigation.
  IPC insulin producing cells, CC corpus cardiacum, CA corpora allata. For further
  information and gene names, see text.
