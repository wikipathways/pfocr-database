caption: 'SNHG involved in a serious of cellular biological role in EC. Note: The
  “arrow” symbol denotes a promotional relationship. For instance, SNHG16 can enhance
  the migration of esophageal cancer cells by upregulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. The “inhibition line” symbol signifies a suppressive interaction. For example,
  SNHG8 can increase the levels of BACH1 by downregulating the expression of miR-1270,
  a process akin to sponge-like absorption, which in turn leads to accelerated proliferation
  and decelerated apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells. The “?” symbol indicates that
  it is currently unclear which molecular targets SNHG interacts with to regulate
  cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and invasion. For example,
  SNHG6 has been shown to promote the proliferation and migration of esophageal cancer
  cells, as well as to inhibit apoptosis. However, the specific downstream molecules
  that SNHG6 modulates to exert these effects remain to be elucidated'
