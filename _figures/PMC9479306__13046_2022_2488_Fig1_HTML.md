caption: miRNAs regulate the EMT process in cancer. miRNAs post-transcriptionally
  suppress the expression of key players of the EMT program at multiple levels. Initially,
  EMT is triggered upon activation of several pathways such as TGF-β and WNT/β-catenin
  signaling pathways. The multiple components of these signaling pathways are targeted
  by various miRNAs. Activation of these signaling pathways promotes the expression
  of EMT-inducing transcription factors (ZEB, SNAIL and TWIST) that function pleiotropically
  to induce the acquisition of the mesenchymal properties. These transcription factors
  bind to the promoter regions of specific miRNAs and regulate their expression. On
  the other hand, miRNAs can target the 3′UTRs of the mRNAs that encode these transcription
  factors. Some of these miRNAs and transcription factors form a double negative feedback
  loop. The TGF-β signaling pathway regulates cytoskeletal dynamics through regulating
  RhoA and CDC42, which are targeted by miRNAs. mRNAs encoding adhesion molecules
  such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin are also targeted by miRNAs. Green boxes represent
  an EMT inhibitory role by the indicated miRNAs, whereas red boxes represent the
  induction of the EMT process by the indicated miRNAs.

  description: miRNAs regulate the EMT process in cancer. miRNAs post-transcriptionally

    promotes the expression of EMT-inducing transcription factors (ZEB, SNAIL and
