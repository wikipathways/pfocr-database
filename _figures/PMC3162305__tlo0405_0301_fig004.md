caption: Oncostatin M signaling pathway. Within this pathway, the network of cell
  adhesion and extracellular remodeling is the most significantly upregulated network
  in VSCC. The latter was generated from critical genes most upregulated in the tumor
  samples, depicting the major nodes of MMPs 1, 2, and 13 and their interactors. Red
  depicts the genes that are upregulated in tumor samples. The intensity of the colors
  indicates the magnitude of regulation.
