  CpG sites of NFE2L2 promoter region can be epigenetically modified by DNMT-based
  methylation, while histone acetylation is maintained by the coordination of HATs
  and HDACs, which acetylate or deacetylate the lysine residues in the N-terminal
  tails of histones protruding from the octamer respectively. SFN, a natural phytochemical,
  primarily attenuates both DNMTs and HDACs, individually suppressing DNA hypermethylation
  and histones deacetylation, ultimately upregulating NRF2. Another epigenetic modification
  of NRF2/KEAP1 pathway deregulation in cancer comes from several miRNAs that downregulate
  or upregulate NRF2 protein expression in the cytoplasm by directly targeting 3′-UTR
  sequences of NRF2 or KEAP1 mRNA. The important phytochemicals and mechanisms interacting
  with NRF2/KEAP1 pathway are displayed. For instance, Vitamin C could inhibit miR-93
  to upregulate NRF2 mRNA while PEITC could inhibit miR-200c to downregulate KEAP1
  mRNA, jointly resulting in activation of NRF2/KEAP1 pathway. Under normal conditions,
  NRF2 is bound to KEAP1, ubiquitylated by CUL3 ubiquitin ligase, and turns into proteasomal
  degradation. In response to oxidative stress, KEAP1 is suppressed and leads to NRF2
  stabilization. Subsequently, it translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the
  ARE in the genome with sMAF proteins, and eventually activates the transcription
  of its downstream genes, which are mainly involved in the redox homeostasis of the
  cell. DNMT: DNA methyltransferase; Me: methyl group; HAT: histone acetyltransferase;
  HDAC: histone deacetylase; AC: acetyl group; miRNA: microRNA; RNA Pol II: RNA polymerase
  II; pri-miRNA: primary miRNA; pre-miRNA: precursor miRNA; Ago: argonaute protein;
  ARE: antioxidant response element; SFN: Sulforaphane; PEITC: Phenethyl-isothiocyanate.'
