caption: Principle of MGE depicted with an example ManNAc derivative. To detect the
  reporter group R on the cell surface, cells are fluorescently labeled in a bioorthogonal
  ligation reaction and investigated by confocal fluorescence microscopy (pathway
  A). To quantify sialic acid levels, sialic acids are cleaved off by treatment with
  acetic acid and – after addition of internal standard Neu5Aloc – labeled by DMB
  allowing sialic acids to be quantified by RP‐HPLC (pathway B).
