caption: Multiple substrates of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway mediate growth and metabolic
  signals in skeletal muscle. As discussed in the text, the PI 3-kinase/Akt network
  carries a tremendous burden as a mediator of protein synthesis, protein degradation,
  glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. Many of PI 3-kinase/Akt effectors exhibit
  functional diversity; that is, instead of one substrate one function, most substrates
  regulate multiple physiological processes including but not limited to growth and
  metabolism (reviewed in Ref. ). Of particular interest is better understanding how
  resistance training and resistance training-like mimetics (e.g., inhibitors of myostatin)
  that clearly impact skeletal muscle mass and fast glycolytic fibers enhance skeletal
  muscle's responsiveness to insulin, augment glucose use and storage, and improve
  systemic metabolism.
