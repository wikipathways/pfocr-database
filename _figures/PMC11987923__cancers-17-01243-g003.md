caption: Schematic representation of the tumor immune microenvironment in cholangiocarcinoma.
  Several studies have classified the tumor microenvironment (TME) of cholangiocarcinoma
  (CCA). The red up arrows represent “activation” of the signal, and the blue down
  arrows show “inactivation”. In general, inflamed tumors exhibit the activation of
  anti-tumor immune responses, including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling, antigen
  presentation, and IL-6/JAK/STAT signaling. In such cases, immune checkpoint inhibitors
  (ICIs) may be effective (a). Conversely, a subset of CCA tumors displays an altered
  immune response characterized by increased TGF-β signaling, angiogenesis, and activation
  of hepatic stellate cells (b). In these tumors, various mesenchymal reactions—such
  as neovascularization, fibrosis, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)—are
  induced, leading to restricted T cell infiltration. Additionally, the activation
  of TGF-β, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Notch signaling promotes
  the infiltration of M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells (Tregs). In tumors lacking
  infiltrating immune cells, anti-tumor immune responses are largely absent, rendering
  ICIs potentially ineffective (c). The activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway may contribute to this form of immune evasion
