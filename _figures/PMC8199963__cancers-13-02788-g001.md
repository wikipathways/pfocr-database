caption: TG2 roles in the tumour microenvironment (TME). (A) Schematic representation
  of the tumour microenvironment (TME) showing the presence of resident and infiltrated
  cellular constituents and extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Cancer, stroma,
  and immune system constantly interact, and within this complex system TG2 plays
  a role in multiple pathways and responses. Subfigures B-E are magnifications of
  the indicated areas within the TME. (B) TG2 is linked to adipocyte and fibroblast
  phenotype. Upregulation of cancer-derived TG2 may inhibit adipogenesis by cross-linking
  of proliferative-activated receptor y (PPARγ) along with other events, such as the
  re-activation of WNT canonical pathway. The TGF-β/TG2 link is associated with the
  activation of fibroblasts to a de-differentiated, contractile cancer-associated
  fibroblast (CAF) phenotype. Increased stromal stiffening enhances integrin activation
  and signalling through pathways such as YAP/TAZ which can further regulate TG2 expression.
  (C) TG2 in chemoresistance, apoptosis, and replicative immortality. Chemotherapeutics
  induce apoptosis in sensitive cancer cells, but in chemoresistant cells several
  mechanisms are activated to contrast death. A hypoxic-induced loop between HIF/TG2/NF-κB
  is responsible for apoptotic resistance in cancer cells. Increased expression of
  TG2 promotes chemoresistance and survival in cancer cells through several pathways
  but also through the binding with integrins and the activation of FAK signalling.
  TG2 increases CD44+ activation, leading to the high proliferative and chemo-resistant
  cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype. (D) TG2 cross-linking activity contributes to
  TME stiffening of the primary and metastatic sites. TG2 linked to fibronectin (FN)
  upon HSPG/SDC4 release from fibroblasts and macrophages in the extracellular space
  activates its cross-linking activity, remodelling the ECM and contributing to cancer
  cells migration and fibrosis. Cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) express
  TG2/FN on their membranes and alter the metastatic niche through paracrine signalling.
  (E) TG2 is linked to cancer invasive behaviour. The reciprocal relationship between
  TGF-β and TG2 mediates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells,
  leading to enhanced migration, which is also increased by the binding TG2/Fn/integrins
  and the following adhesion to the ECM. Increased cell contractility is promoted
  by downstream signalling of TG2/Fn/integrins binding, such as the inhibition of
  EGFR activity through FAK signalling. The balance between TG2 enzymatic activity
  on laminin/nidogen complexes and upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
  by cancer cells contributes to basement membrane (BM) integrity, and thus invasive
  potential.
