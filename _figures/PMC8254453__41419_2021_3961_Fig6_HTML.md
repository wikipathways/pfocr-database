caption: Infection and stress facilitate mtDNA release from injured cells into the
  circulation, and this mtDNA is recognized by macrophages. Excess activation of the
  STING pathway leads to autophagic flux blockade by affecting lysosomal acidification
  in a TBK1-dependent manner, resulting in a vicious cycle and remote organ injury.
