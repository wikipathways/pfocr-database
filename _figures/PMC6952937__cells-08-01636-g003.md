caption: A peptide that blocks the interaction of NF-κB p65 subunit with Smad4 enhances
  BMP2-induced bone formation. Inhibitors of the classical NF-κB pathway have been
  reported to promote bone formation, but mice deficient in p65, the main subunit
  of NF-κB, are embryonic lethal and must be considered for possible side effects.
  Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which NF-κB suppresses BMP
  signaling and revealed that p65 and the BMP-signaling molecule Smad4 are associated.
  We suggested the possibility of enhancing the effect of BMP without impairing the
  function of NF-κB by using a peptide that specifically inhibits the association
  site.
