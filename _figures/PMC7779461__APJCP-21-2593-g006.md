caption: Immune Evasion Mechanisms Associated with the PD-1/PD-L1 Signaling Pathway
  (Song et al., 2019). PD-1 is expressed on the surface of T cells that are activated
  by downstream T cell receptor signaling (TCR), with the important function of checking
  points in regulating the T-cell mediated immune response. PD-1 provides a signal
  inhibition to regulate T-cell activation after binding to the PD-L1 ligand because
  the Jak/STAT (□) pathway is up-regulated. The interaction between the extracellular
  domain PD-1 and PD-L1 induces changes in the conformation of PD-1 that produce phosphorylation
  of the cytoplasmic ITIM and ITSM, which then recruits Src Homology Region 2-Containing
  Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) and SHP-1. After SHP-1/2 is recruited, the
  interaction dephosphorylates protein - ζ associated protein 70 (ZAP70) protein as
  a downstream member of the TCR signaling pathway and thereby inhibits the phosphatidylinositol-3-
  kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway, RAS/MEK/Erk, and protein kinase Cθ - (PKC-θ). Finally,
  the inhibitory pathway mediated by PD-1 is closely related to decreased T-cell proliferation
  and decreased IL-2 production, and promotes T-cell apoptosis, which causes T-cell
  fatigue (Song et al., 2019).
