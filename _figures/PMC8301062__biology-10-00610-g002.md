caption: Rationale for combining GSK-3β inhibitors with immunotherapy and chemotherapy.
  GSK-3β increases tumor expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-1) and lymphocyte
  activation gene-3 (LAG-3), both of which can be reversed with small molecule inhibition
  of GSK-3β. Furthermore, GSK-3β inhibition can prevent DNA damage response activation
  by chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine by preventing the induction of the
  ATR/TopBP1 pathway. Such mechanisms support a rationale for combining GSK-3β small
  molecule inhibitors with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Created with BioRender.com
