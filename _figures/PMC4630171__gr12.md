caption: Proposed model. Cripto-1 ablation disrupts alveolar development in the mouse
  mammary gland through a progesterone receptor (PR)–mediated pathway. Progesterone
  regulates expression of paracrine effectors, such as receptor activator for NF-κB
  ligand (RANKL), Wnt4, and Cripto-1. Cripto-1 expression also regulates Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling, which, in turn, can regulate Cripto-1 expression (feed-forward loop).
  Cripto and PR regulate the expression of each other in a progesterone-dependent
  manner in a dual feed-forward loop. Cripto-1 can affect the ratio of RANK/RANKL,
  and RANKL through RANK can stimulate NF-κB activation. Both PR and activated NF-κB
  can enhance cyclin D1. Boldfaced signaling components represent data from herein.
