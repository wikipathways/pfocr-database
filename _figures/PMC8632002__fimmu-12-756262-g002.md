caption: Schematic representation of a plasmacytoid dendritic cell with viral ssRNA
  in the endosome. This is recognized by TLR7 on the endosomal membrane. Via the MYD88
  pathway, ‘TLR adaptor interacting with SLC15A4 on the lysosome’ (TASL) is activated
  which is needed for recruitment of Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 (IRF5), a transcription
  factor involved in transcription of NF-kβ and type 1 interferons. This results in
  further transcription of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α for NF-kβ and interferon stimulated
  genes for type 1 interferons, respectively.
