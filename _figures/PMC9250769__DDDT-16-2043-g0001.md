caption: 'The anti-articular effect of QUE on RA in pre-clinical studies. (A): Rheumatoid
  arthritis joint. (B): The immune-regulatory effect of QUE on RA: QUE regulated Th17/Treg
  cell balance, decreased Th17 cells-related cytokines (IL-17A, IL-21 and IL-23),
  increased Treg cells-related cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β), and reduced the autoantibodies
  levels. (C): The anti-inflammatory and bone protective mechanisms of QUE on RA:
  Anti-inflammatory effect: QUE decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β,
  IL-6, IL-8, PGE2, COX-2, iNOS, and prepro-ET-1) by regulating MAPKs (ERK, p38, JNK),
  NF-κB and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway as well as lncRNA XIST/miR-485/PSMB8 axis;
  QUE decreased gp91phox expression, increased GSH levels through regulating Nrf2/HO-1
  signaling pathway, indicating the participation of HO-1 in the anti-inflammatory
  effect of QUE; QUE inhibited FLS proliferation via inhibiting the activation of
  intracellular MAPKs (ERK, p38, JNK) and NF-κB signaling pathways; QUE inhibited
  the migration and invasion of FLS, which might be related to the up-regulatory effect
  on miR-146a and the down-regulatory effect on the downstream target GATA6; Besides,
  QUE upregulated lncRNA MALAT1, inducing the inhibitory effect on the activation
  of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, leading to caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax elevated,
  Bcl-2 diminished, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio decreased, ultimately to promote RAFLS apoptosis;
  QUE could also enhance p53 phosphorylation at ser15, leading to caspase-3 and caspase-9
  activated, Bcl-2 expression diminished, Bax expression elevated, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio
  decreased, caused a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential, and enhanced the subsequent
  release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in FLS, ultimately to promote RAFLS apoptosis.
  Bone-protective effect: QUE suppressed RANKL expression of FLS by regulating mTOR,
  ERK, IκB-α and AMPK signaling pathway. QUE inhibited MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression
  of FLS via suppressing the activation of MAPKs (ERK, p38, JNK) and NF-κB signaling
  pathway.'
