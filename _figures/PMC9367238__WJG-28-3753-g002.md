caption: 'A schematic model for SET and MYND domain-containing protein 2 driving pancreatic
  cancer development via methylation of nonhistone proteins. SET and MYND domain-containing
  protein 2 (SMYD2) can methylate several nonhistone proteins that may be involved
  in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis, including p53, PTEN, retinoblastomaassociated
  protein (RB), and mitogen-activated protein kinase activated protein kinase 3 (MAPKAPK3).
  SMYD2 methylates and inactivates p53 to promote cell proliferation. PTEN is downregulated
  by SMYD2-mediated methylation, which promotes cell proliferation through activation
  of PI3K signaling. Methylation of RB by SMYD2 enhances RB phosphorylation, which
  allows E2F to disassociate from the RB-E2F complex and enhances E2F activity to
  promote cell cycle progression. SMYD2 impacts the RTK/Ras pathway through methylation
  of MAPKAPK3 to promote cell growth. MAPKAPK3: Mitogen-activated protein kinase activated
  protein kinase 3; RB: Retinoblastoma-associated protein.'
