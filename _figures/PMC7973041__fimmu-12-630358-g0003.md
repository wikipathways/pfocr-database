caption: m6A modification participates in innate immunity via regulating the recognitions
  of unmodified transcribed RNA (tRNA), invading pathogens, exogenous RNAs, and aberrant
  endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). (A) m6A-modified tRNA reduces or eliminates
  the TLR3, TLR7, or TLR8 activation in monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). (B) m6A-methylation
  favors virion RNA escaping from the innate immunity recognitions in Huh7 cells and
  A549 cells. (C) Exogenous circRNAs, which lack m6A modifications, can be recognized
  by RIG-I signaling pathway in Hela cells. (D) Aberrant endogenous dsRNA in hematopoietic
  stem cells, which is formed by loss of m6A addition in ssRNA, can be recognized
  by RIG-I as foreign dsRNA and subsequently trigger a deleterious innate immune response.
