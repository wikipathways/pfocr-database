caption: Protein kinase pathways in Colletotrichum pathogens. (B) cAMP signaling pathway,
  MAPK cascades and MOR pathway in C. orbiculare. cAMP-PKA signaling pathway (adenylate
  cyclase Cac1, PKA regulatory unit Rpk1, PKA catalytic unit Cpk1) is involved in
  conidial germination, appressorium penetration and invasive growth. The CoMekk1-CoMk1
  module is involved in conidial germination, appressorium formation and penetration.
  CoMaf1 is involved in appressorium formation. The MOR pathway (scaffold proteins
  CoPag1 and CoHym1, NDR kinase CoCbk1 and transcription factor MTF4) is involved
  in appressorium penetration and invasive growth. GTPase-activating protein CoIra1
  and GTPase CoRas2 function upstream of cAMP and MAPK signaling pathways. CoIra1
  inhibits the activity of CoRas2, and CoRas2 positively regulates cAMP and MAPK pathways.
  (A) cAMP signaling pathway and MAPK cascades in C. gloeosporioides. GTPase protein
  RhoB downregulates cAMP levels and controls the development of infection-related
  structures and pathogenicity. CgMck1-CgMek1/CgMkk1-CgSlt2/CgMps1 and CgSte11-CgSte7-CgMk1
  cascade regulate infection-related morphogenesis and pathogenesis. CgMck1-CgMek1/CgMkk1-CgSlt2/CgMps1
  cascade regulates cell wall remodeling and stress responses. CgSte11-CgSte7-CgMk1
  and CgHog1-mediated cascades contribute to osmotic responses. (C) cAMP, MAPK and
  MOR pathway in C. higginsianum. All three pathways regulate the differentiation
  of infection-related morphogenesis and pathogenicity. Guanine exchange factors ChRgf
  and ChCdc25 activate Ras2 and positively regulate cAMP levels. C. higginsianum MAPK
  pathway is composed of MAPKK ChSte7 and MAPK ChMk1. In MOR pathway, ChMob2 binds
  to ChCbk1, forming an active complex, which potentially regulates transcription
  factors ChSsd1 and ChAce2.
