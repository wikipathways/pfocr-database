caption: The role of RNA methylation, DNA methylation, and demethylation in PH. (A)
  RNA methylation primarily affects RNA stability and gene expression. In PASMCs,
  hypoxia‐induced reduction of METTL3 inhibits m6A methylation, leading to cellular
  phenotypic shifts and pyroptosis. Additionally, hypoxia increases Alkbh5, which
  promotes cell migration and proliferation by destabilizing Cyp1a1 mRNA, contributing
  to PH. However, some studies also suggest that hypoxia‐induced upregulation of METTL3
  can drive phenotypic changes. In MCT‐induced PH, elevated YTHDF1 enhances the translation
  of MAGED1 and FoxM1, accelerating disease progression, while YTHDF2 upregulation
  in PASMCs promotes proliferation via the m6A/Myadm/p21 pathway. In PAECs, TNF‐α
  and TGF‐β1 suppress METTL3, reducing RNA methylation and leading to vascular remodeling
  and phenotypic changes. Furthermore, hypoxia‐induced inhibition of FENDRR by YTHDC1
  decreases DRP1 promoter methylation, promoting DRP1 expression and contributing
  to PH development. (B) DNA methylation and demethylation regulate key gene expression,
  influencing cell proliferation, phenotypic switching, and vascular remodeling. In
  PASMCs, methylation of the SOD2 gene suppresses its expression, leading to HIF‐1
  activation and phenotypic changes, while methylation of the ELK3 gene induces mitochondrial
  dysfunction, further promoting cellular shifts that contribute to PH. In PAECs,
  hypermethylation of the BMPR2 promoter and the CTSZ gene impairs BMPR2 activity
  and apoptosis, facilitating vascular remodeling and disease progression. Additionally,
  in male PAECs, EHITSN upregulates Xist expression, altering the methylation of the
  Xist/Tsix locus, which reduces KLF2 expression and drives vascular remodeling, ultimately
  leading to PH. PASMC, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell; PAEC, pulmonary artery
