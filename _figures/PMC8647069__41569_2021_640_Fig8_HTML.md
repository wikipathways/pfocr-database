caption: a | Haematoxylin and eosin staining of obliterating endothelialitis lesions
  in the lung of a representative patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
  b | Representative multiplexed immunohistochemical staining of complement component
  5a receptor 1 (C5aR1; green), CD68 (red) and CD163 (orange) showing that obliterating
  endothelialitis is associated with C5aR1+ macrophages surrounding the arteries and
  endothrombus (white dashed line). c | Hypothetical pathway for complement-mediated
  inflammation of the pulmonary alveolus in COVID-19. (1) Severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) attaches to an angiotensin-converting enzyme
  2 (ACE2) receptor on a type II alveolar epithelial cell (AEC-II), and the cell undergoes
  apoptosis. (2) Complement activation is initiated upon recognition of viral glycans
  by lectins (such as collectin 11 and ficolin 1, which are secreted by AEC-II) complexed
  with mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs), including MASP2.
  Direct binding of MASP2 to the nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has also been suggested
  to initiate lectin pathway activation. (3) Complement deposition and membrane attack
  complex (MAC)–C5b-9 formation on AECs cause inflammasome activation and cell damage.
  (4) Release of complement C5a increases vascular permeability and recruitment/activation
  of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and monocytes to the alveolus. (5) Monocytes
  differentiated into inflammatory macrophages overproduce pro-inflammatory cytokines
  in response to C3a and C5a stimulation. (6) Endothelial cell (EC) activation by
  C5a and MAC predisposes to thrombus formation, which is further increased through
  mannose-binding lectin recognition of viral particles in the vascular compartment,
  leading to the cleavage of thrombin and fibrinogen by MASPs. Drugs that can target
  complement activation are shown in the pink boxes. DAMP, damage-associated molecular
  pattern; mAB, monoclonal antibody. Parts a and b adapted from ref., Springer Nature
