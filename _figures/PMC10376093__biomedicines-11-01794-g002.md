caption: A model of the hepsin/HGF/c-Met pathway in adipocytes. Hepsin activates HGF
  (hepatocyte growth factor), which in turn activates c-Met signaling and the downstream
  effectors including AKT (also known as protein kinase B). Subsequently, AKT inhibits
  PGC-1α, a transcriptional co-activator in adipocyte browning and mitochondrial gene
  expression.
