caption: 'The neuroimmune interface and the role of glia in the pain response. (A)
  Reactive immunocompetent cells located at the site of injury release soluble mediators
  that diffuse into the neuroimmune interface and bind to synaptic terminals. These
  mediators modulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission and lead to nociceptive
  hypersensitivity. Mediators such as CCL2 and IL-1β elevate TNFR1 and AMPA signaling
  and the expression of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs. TNF also increases the phosphorylation
  of ERKs through the TNFR1 pathway, which then activates NMDAR activity. ROS and
  IL-17 induce the phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit of NMDAR. Other subunits, NR1,
  NR2A, and NR2B, are phosphorylated by IL-1β. Together, these mediators increase
  the influx of Ca2+ ions, thereby augmenting pain sensation. PGE2 activates AC through
  receptor stimulation of the G-protein (G), which then catalyzes the conversion of
  ATP into cAMP. The G-dependent rise in cAMP level is crucial for neuronal excitability.
  cAMP regulates the phosphorylation of ion channels, Nav1.8 and NMDAR, through PKA
  (). PGE2-dependent EP2 signaling also leads to the PKA-dependent inhibition of glycinergic
  neurotransmission via GlyR3 receptors. Taken together, mediators released by glia,
  injured neurons, or other central immune cells promote pain sensation and result
  in pathological pain in severe conditions. (B) Opioid-induced analgesia and hyperalgesia.
  Morph is glucuronidated into M3G and M6G in hepatocytes. Morph and its MOR active
  metabolite, M6G, produce analgesic effects by modulating the Ca2+ and K+ ion channels
  through MOR mediated signal transduction (blue arrows). MORs are associated with
  G-proteins; after dissociation, the Gα subunit of the G-protein moves and directly
  interacts with the G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel, Kir3 (–). The
  dissociated Gα subunit also decreases synaptic transmission partly by inhibiting
  ACs, thereby reducing the cAMP-dependent Ca2+ influx (). Channel deactivation occurs
  after hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and Gα removal from the channel. This process causes
  cellular hyperpolarization and inhibits tonic neural activity. Opioid receptor-induced
  inhibition of Ca2+ conductance is mediated by binding of the dissociated Gβϒ subunit
  directly to the channel. This binding event is thought to reduce voltage activation
  of the channel pore opening and to enhance the analgesic effect of opioids. TLRs,
  expressed on neurons, glia, and other neuroimmune cells, are activated non-stereoselectively
  by both active and inactive isomers of Morph and its opioid-inactive metabolite
  M3G (). Microglial activation and subsequent proinflammatory cytokine release sensitize
  neurons and diminish the analgesic effects of Morph and M6G (, –). This mechanism
  is thought to explain the negative effects of opioids (red arrows). Abbreviations:
