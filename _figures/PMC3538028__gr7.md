caption: Schematic of TGF-β1 stimulated profibrotic epithelial signaling to pericytes
  during fibrotic kidney injury. Fibrotic injury induced TGF-β1 production of tubular
  epithelial cells. TGF-β1 then induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and profibrotic phenotype
  through up-regulation of p21 and activation of the JNK pathway, respectively. TGF-β1
  and PDGF subsequently stimulated pericyte-myofibroblast transition through differentiation
  and proliferation, respectively.
