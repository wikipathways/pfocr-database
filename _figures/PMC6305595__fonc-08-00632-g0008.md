caption: Under Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes stress, the glutaminolysis intermediate glutamate
  enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics, resulting in STAT3 activation and PD-L1 expression
  in ABC-DLBCL cells. This process is controlled by MALT1 protease activity via up-regulating
  GLS1 expression. These results show a novel regulatory pathway that endows ABC-DLBCL
  cells with an immunosuppressive property. Hence, manipulation of these pathways
  could hold enormous potential for the development of effective immunotherapy for
  ABC-DLBCL.
