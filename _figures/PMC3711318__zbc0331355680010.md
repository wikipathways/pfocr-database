caption: Proposed model for activation of the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway and G2/M
  phase cell cycle arrest induced by HNE. HNE treatment stimulates a DNA damage signaling
  that is mediated by sensor protein ATR. Upon activation, ATR activates the phosphorylation
  of checkpoint kinase, Chk1, which phosphorylates/inactivates Cdc25C. Chk1-mediated
  phosphorylation/inactivation of Cdc25C and p53-independent activation of p21 both
  partially play a major role in deactivation of CDK1 kinase activity and dissociation
  of CDK1-cyclin B1 complex, leading to G2/M phase arrest by HNE. Simultaneously,
  HNE also stimulates the phosphorylation of H2A.X at Ser-139 and initiates the signal
  for the recruitment of DNA repair machinery.
