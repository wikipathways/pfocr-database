caption: 'Radiotherapy‐induced effects on tumor cells. Radiotherapy (RT) induces immunogenic
  death of tumor cells which increases the release of tumor‐associated antigens (TAAs)
  and damage‐associated molecular patterns such as high‐mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)
  and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and enhances the surface expression of calreticulin
  (CRT). Secretion promotes the activation and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs)
  through their corresponding receptors. DCs that sense cancer cell‐derived DNA induce
  interferon‐β (IFN‐β) production through the cyclic GMP‐AMP synthase (cGAS)‐ stimulator
  of interferon genes (STING) pathway. In turn, IFN‐β promotes the activation and
  maturation of DCs. DCs take up tumor‐associated antigens (TAAs) and migrate to draining
  lymph nodes and then present the TAAs on major histocompatibility complex class
  I (MHCI) to T cells through the T‐cell receptor (TCR), which requires the costimulatory
  molecules CD80/86‐CD28/cytotoxic T lymphocyte‐associated protein 4 (CTLA4) and CD40L‐CD40.
  Otherwise, these are not sufficient to cause T cell activation and proliferation
  in the absence of costimulatory signals. Activated T cells are transported to irradiated
  lesions and distant nonirradiated lesions through the blood circulation. At the
  same time, tumor cell immunogenic death leads to the release of cytokines, the immune‐promoting
  factors tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) and interleukin‐2 (IL‐2) recruit activated
  T cells to kill tumor cells through upregulated MHCI, and the immunosuppressive
  factors such as TGF‐β and IL‐10 recruit immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory
  T cells (Tregs) and myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to inhibit immune effects.
  However, activated T cells cause the apoptosis of Tregs and MDSCs through cytokines
  such as TNF‐α. Abbreviations: Radiotherapy, RT; tumor‐associated antigens, TAAs;
