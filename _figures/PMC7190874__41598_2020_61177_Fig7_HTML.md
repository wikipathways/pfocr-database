caption: 'Kidney analysis. (A) Protein-protein interaction network generated with
  STRING from DEGs in the kidney. The network comprises 430 nodes and connected with
  812 edges (p-value of 1.0 e-16). For the rest of the details see Fig.  and also
  high resolution panel A in Supplementary information . (B) The graph shows the results
  from the pathway enrichment analyses for the DEGs obtained from the Kidney. The
  bars depict the negative logarithm of the false discovery rate (FDR). (C) Genes
  with the highest degree of connectivity obtained from the PPI network with Cytoscape.
  D.I–IV) Top four modules obtained from the PPI network using Cytoscape’s plugin
  MCODE (Red nodes: Upregulated in hepta KO mice; Green nodes: Downregulated in heptaKO
  mice).'
