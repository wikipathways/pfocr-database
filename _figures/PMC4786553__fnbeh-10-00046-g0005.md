caption: 'Top networks activated in the CPu during CIE and acute withdrawal. Illustrated
  here are select top network pathways for each condition in the CPu. (A) The network
  encompassing neurological disease, skeletal and muscular disorders, and psychological
  disorders is shown for the CIE mice, and (B) the network encompassing cell death
  and survival, behavior and lipid metabolism is shown for the withdrawal mice. Networks
  are overlaid with significantly affected canonical pathways and diseases. (Color
  key: green = down-regulated, red = up-regulated, gray = molecule present in dataset
  but not significantly changed, white = molecule important in pathway but not found
  in dataset; overlay colors are unique to each canonical pathway or disease). Complete
  data can be found in Supplemental Materials.'
