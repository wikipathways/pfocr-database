caption: Ethylene biosynthesis pathway. S-adenosyl-methionine (S-AdoMet) is synthesized
  from the methionine by the S-adenosyl-methionine synthetase (SAM synthetase) with
  one ATP molecule expensed per S-AdoMet synthesized. S-AdoMet is then converted to
  1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by ACC synthase, 5′-methylthioadenosine
  (MTA) being a by-product. MTA is recycled to methionine by successive enzymatic
  reactions involving various intermediates (MTR, 5-methylthioribose; KMB, 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate),
  which constitute the methionine (Yang) cycle. S-AdoMet is also the precursor of
  the spermidine/spermine biosynthesis pathway. Ethylene production is catalyzed by
  the ACC oxidase using ACC as substrate, and generates carbon dioxide and hydrogen
  cyanide. Malonylation of ACC to malonyl-ACC (MACC) reduces ACC content and consequently
  ethylene production.
