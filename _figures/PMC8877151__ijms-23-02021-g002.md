caption: Schematic showing points of action of drugs and experimental compounds targeting
  the PERK branch of the UPR and ISR. (1) The chaperone protein known as binding immunoglobulin
  protein (BiP) binds to misfolded proteins, resulting in (2) phosphorylation of PERK.
  PERK activation, in turn, leads to (3) phosphorylation of eIF2α, which reduces protein
  translation (4) via by preventing nucleotide exchange by eIF2B needed for initiation
  of translation. GSK260414 inhibits PERK phosphorylation; ISRIB prevents eIF2B binding
  by p-eIF2α, and trazodone also acts downstream of p-eIF2α by restoring global protein
  synthesis rates. Intervention at all of these steps provides exceptional neuroprotection
  in many animal models of neurodegenerative diseases.
