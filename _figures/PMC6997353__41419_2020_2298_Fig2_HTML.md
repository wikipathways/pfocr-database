caption: The figure shows the regulatory pathways of ferroptosis, which can be roughly
  divided into three categories. The first one is regulated by GSH/GPX4 pathway, such
  as inhibition of system Xc-, sulfur transfer pathway, MVA pathway, glutamine pathway,
  and p53 regulatory axis. Second, the regulation mechanism of iron metabolism, such
  as the regulation of ATG5-ATG7-NCOA4 pathway and IREB2 related to ferritin metabolism,
  and the regulatory pathways of p62-Keap1-NRF2 and HSPB1 all have effects on iron.
  The third category is related pathways around lipid metabolism, such as P53-SAT1-ALOX15,
  ACSL4, LPCAT3, etc., which have effects on lipid regulation and ferroptosis. In
  addition, Erastin acts on mitochondria to induce ferroptosis. Also, recent studies
  have shown that the FSP1-CoQ10- NAD(P)H pathway exists as an independent parallel
  system that works cooperatively with GPX4 and glutathione to inhibit phospholipid
  peroxidation and ferroptosis.
