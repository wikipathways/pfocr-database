caption: 'A proposal for the evolution of mirrregulation in D. melanogaster. (A) Two
  separate input modules regulate mirr expression: the green module uses only the
  input of the EGFr pathway via Cic, whereas the orange module requires both EGFr
  and Dpp input. (B) The two regulatory modules drive different expression levels
  of mirr. pip repression requires only low levels of mirr, which are provided through
  the green module, whereas the br(L) enhancer is activated only when mirr levels
  are sufficiently high, which is achieved through the orange module. (C) A proposal
  for the evolution of two regulatory modules, using two enhancers. A single enhancer
  (mirLo) is responsive to EGFr signaling only, and is sufficient to provide the low
  level of mirr expression required to repress pip as part of an ancestral signaling
  cassette. A second enhancer (mirHi) has evolved in Drosophila, which now drives
  mirr expression in response to both EGFr and Dpp signaling, in high levels that
  are sufficient for the activation of the br(L) enhancer.'
