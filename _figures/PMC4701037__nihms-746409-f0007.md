caption: Key signaling pathways involved in minocycline-mediated protection of cardiac
  myocytes from apoptosis trigged by in utero cocaine exposure. Increased oxidative
  stress generated in response to prenatal cocaine exposure can result in activation
  of both JNK and p38 MAPK in fetal hearts. It is likely that activation of these
  signaling cascades promote fetal cardiac myocyte apoptosis through perturbation
  of the BAX/BCL-2 rheostat and subsequent activation of cytochrome c-mediated death
  pathway. Minocycline seems to be working at various steps of the signal transduction
  pathways involving suppression of oxidative stress, activation of JNK and p38 MAPK,
  perturbation of the BAX/BCL-2 ratio, cytochrome c release, and activation of caspases
