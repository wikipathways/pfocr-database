caption: Model for sodB mRNA decay at high and low iron concentrations. The pathway
  for sodB mRNA decay in the presence of steady-state levels of iron is shown on the
  left. The RNase E cleavage eliminates the 5′ terminal stem–loop structure and triggers
  both chemical and functional inactivation of the transcript. Owing to lower affinity
  for 30S ribosomal subunits, translation of the truncated sodB mRNA is less efficient,
  thereby allowing RNase E cleavage at downstream site(s). The latter results in the
  subsequent loss of ribosomal subunits and degradation of the intermediate ribosome-free
  RNA fragments by endo- and exonucleases. The iron-dependent inactivation of the
  sodB transcript, which is initiated by the small regulatory RNA RyhB and Hfq, is
  shown on the right. The base pairing with RyhB, which is known to cause structural
  rearrangements within the sodB 5′-UTR (), inhibits translation and induces RNase
  E cleavage at the downstream site A+12, whereas the coordinated decay of RyhB is
  initiated by RNase III cleavage at U46 (for details, see ). Similar to the general
  pathway, the degradation of the intermediate products is accomplished by exo- and
  endoribonucleases.
