caption: 'Association network between microbiome and transcriptome. Compositionally
  robust sparse partial least squares (compPLS) was used to evaluate for associations
  between airway microbiota and transcriptome considering samples from lung cancer,
  disease control, and healthy control. Analysis was adjusted by smoking status and
  for paired samples obtained in subjects. Edge colors are representative of negative
  associations in red and positive associations in blue, and edge weight is scaled
  to represent the degree of the confidence for the associations. Only taxa identified
  as having significant correlations are displayed, and size of nodes denotes median
  relative abundance of taxa at a genus level. The most abundant taxon were: Veillonella,
  which was positively correlated with ERK/MAPK, T-cell receptor, p53, and cancer
  pathways; Megasphaera, which was positively correlated with ERK/MAPK, PI3K/Akt,
  IL-17, and TGF-β; and Bulleidia, which was negatively correlated with similar pathways.
  ERK = extracellular signal–regulated kinase; FoxO = forkhead box O; MAPK = mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; NF-κB = nuclear factor-κB; TGF-β = transforming growth factor-β;
  VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor; Wnt = wingless/integrated.'
