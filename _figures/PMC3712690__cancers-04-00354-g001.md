caption: 'ATM kinase activity modulates TRAIL sensitivity. DNA damaging agents trigger
  ATM kinase activity which in turn modulates TRAIL sensitivity through three mechanisms:
  (1) ATM activity promotes TRAIL R2 expression []; (2) TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 stimulation,
  further promote ATM catalytic activity [,] and triggers downstream Chk2 activation,
  which triggers Caspases activation through the mitochondria pathway []; (3) ATM
  activity directly down regulates cFLIP proteins levels []. Overall these signalling
  pathways identify ATM as a central modulator of TRAIL sensitivity triggered by DNA
  damaging chemotherapeutic drugs.'
