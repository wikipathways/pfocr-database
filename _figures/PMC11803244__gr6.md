caption: The proposed mechanistic targets of celastrol in alleviating hyperglycemia-induced
  renal damage. Under hyperglycemic conditions, the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway
  is activated, leading to increased inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and
  fibrosis, all of which contribute to the progression of hyperglycemia-induced DN.
  Celastrol inhibits the activation of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway, thereby mitigating
  various detrimental processes associated with renal damage, thus highlighting its
  potential as a therapeutic agent for hyperglycemia-mediated metabolic dysfunctions,
  including diabetic nephropathy (DN). Created with BioRender.com
