caption: Mitochondria unfolded protein response (UPRmt). In both, mammals and C. elegans,
  activation of the UPRmt is caused by accumulation of unfolded proteins inside of
  the mitochondria matrix. Proteolysis of impaired proteins is carried by the effects
  of the ClpP protease. In C. elegans, export of these peptides to the cytosol is
  accomplished by HAF-1 which activates ATFS-1 (in C. elegans) or ATF5 (in mammals)
  to allow nuclear translocation and initiate transcription of this pathway genes.
  Physiologically, to prevent unnecessary activation of this signaling, ATFS-1 is
  imported into the mitochondria via the mitochondrial-targeting-sequence (MTS), formed
  by the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and the translocase of the inner
  membrane (TIM) to allow degradation of ATFS-1 by the protease LON. Furthermore,
  in C. elegans, translocation to the nucleus of the proteins UBL-5, LIN-65, MET-1
  and MET-2 upon UPRmt activation facilitates the binding of ATFS-1 by chromatin remodeling.
  Ultimately, activation of ATFS-1 and ATF5 induces genes to promote OXPHOS recovery,
  ROS detoxification, expression of mitochondrial protein import components and upregulation
  of chaperones and proteases to re-establish mitochondria proteostasis.
