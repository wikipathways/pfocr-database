caption: G protein-dependent signaling pathways activated by VPAC receptors. VPAC
  receptors are preferentially coupled to Gαs leading to activation of adenylate cyclase
  (AC) and subsequent cAMP production and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). VPAC
  receptors are able to activate phospholipase C (PLC) pathway after coupling to Gαi,
  Gαq, or Gα16 and stimulate calcium levels and protein kinase C (PKC). Gαi-dependent
  activation of PLC by VPAC2 relies on the availability of free Gβγ and on Ca2+ entry
  through receptor-operated Ca2+ channels while Gαi-dependent activation of PLC by
  VPAC1 is not affected by chelating of extracellular calcium.
