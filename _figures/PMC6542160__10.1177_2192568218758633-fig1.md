caption: 'Vitamin B12 coenzyme function. B12 acts as a coenzyme in the conversion
  of homocysteine to methionine in the cytosol, and the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA
  to succinyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. The cytoplasmic reaction requires folate,
  as the methyl group that is added to homocysteine is removed from 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate.
  Tetrahydrofolate is a precursor in the synthetic pathway for purines and pyrimidines,
  while succinyl-CoA enters the Krebs cycle and is important for lipid and carbohydrate
  synthesis. Reprinted with permission from Springer: Nature Reviews Gastroenterology
  and Hepatology (Nielsen et al).'
