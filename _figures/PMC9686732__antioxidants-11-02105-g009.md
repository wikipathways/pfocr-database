caption: Schematic diagram of glucose metabolism disorders caused by SELENOF KO in
  young mice and the related mechanism. SELENOF KO could reduce insulin secretion
  in the pancreas of young mice resulting in impaired glucose metabolism pathways
  including decreased glucose catabolism and glycogen accumulation as well as increased
  gluconeogenesis in the liver. SELENOF KO could also reduce insulin sensitivity by
  inhibiting the AKT signaling pathway and upregulating SELENOS expression in the
  liver. The redox homeostasis disruption induced by SELENOF KO in the liver and pancreas
  contributed to glucose metabolism disorders in young mice directly or indirectly.
