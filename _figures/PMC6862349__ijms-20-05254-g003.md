caption: A proposed model for crosstalks between circadian clock and JA pathway in
  Arabidopsis. Evening complex (EC) transcriptionally represses the expression of
  MYC2, an essential master of JA signaling pathway to mediate leaf senescence. EDS1
  and JAZ5 are the direct targets of LUX in regulating salicylic acid (SA) and JA
  signaling. Time for coffee (TIC) directly interacts with MYC2 and inhibits MYC2
  protein turnover by timing the transcriptional level of CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1
  (COI1) in an evening-phase-specific manner. CCA1 hiking expedition (CHE) serves
  as an activation of ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 1 (ICS1), an enzyme essential for SA
  biosynthesis. SA modulates the amplitude of circadian clock accompany by the redox
  rhythm and NON-EXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENE 1 (NPR1). NPR1 regulates the
  expression of circadian genes, CCA1, LHY, PRR7, and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1).
  Reciprocally, JA signaling affects clock activity through unknown mechanisms. Novel
  molecular links between circadian clock and JA signaling pathway await to be further
  investigated.
