caption: The IL-17 pathway ranked as the third most statistically significant pathway
  (p-value = 1.45×10−13) using Metacore pathway analysis. This pathway includes genes
  for both secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines and the intracellular response through
  IL-17R. Red genes represent significant increases in mRNA levels and blue genes
  represent significant decreases in mRNA levels in thymus tissue following LPS treatment.
  Mean fold changes are given. Green arrows indicate positive influence. Arrows may
  represent multiple steps. Plasma membrane is shown in gray. Nuclear membrane is
  shown as dotted line. A detailed version of the original Metacore pathway is in
  . A full legend of all GeneGo pathway map symbols is in  or at http://www.genego.com/pdf/MC_legend.pdf.
