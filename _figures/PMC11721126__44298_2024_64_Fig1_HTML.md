caption: SARS-CoV-2 infection induces osteochondral damage by activating the interaction
  between the viral spike protein and the ET-1 signaling pathway. ET-1 increases vascular
  permeability, facilitating the infiltration of inflammatory cells into joint tissues
  and elevating levels of TNF, IL-6, and IL-1β. The spike protein activates RANKL,
  disrupting the RANKL-OPG balance, while also upregulating MMP1 and MMP13, leading
  to collagen breakdown, bone resorption, and cartilage degradation. The effect of
  ET-1 can be mitigated by using Macitentan, which helps alleviate SARS-CoV-2-induced
  joint damage
