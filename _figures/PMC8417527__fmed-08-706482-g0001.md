caption: Diagram to show (A) the mechanism of action of IL-6 and (B) the influence
  of tocilizumab, TCZ. The influence of IL-6 in viral infection is reviewed by Rose-John
  et al. () and Velazquez-Salinas et al. (). gp130 is expressed on all cells in the
  body, IL-6 receptor is expressed by specific cells only (hepatocytes, monocytes/macrophages,
  CD4+ T cells, some epithelial cells). Cis- (“classical”) signalling is mediated
  through cell-associated IL-6 receptor, and associated with housekeeping, while trans-signalling
  describes the pathway associated with free soluble IL-6 receptor which may be more
  relevant in response to infection. Dimerization of gp130 causes a cascade starting
  with the autophosphorylation of Janus Kinase 1 (JAK-1). STAT, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription. Created with BioRender.com.
