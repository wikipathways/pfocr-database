caption: Proposed role of CcpE in metabolite sensing and the information it transfers.
  Through the use of citrate as a key inducer, S. aureus CcpE is involved in the regulation
  of TCA-cycle activity, the production of staphyloxanthin, iron acquisition, virulence
  gene expression, and bacterial virulence, as described in the main text. CitZ, citrate
  synthase; CitB, aconitase; CitC, isocitrate dehydrogenase. CitB is the second enzyme
  of the TCA cycle and is responsible for the interconversion of citrate to isocitrate.
  Acetyl-CoA is the precursor for staphyloxanthin production via the mevalonate pathway
  (). Lactate facilitates the release of iron from the host iron-sequestering protein
  transferrin ().
