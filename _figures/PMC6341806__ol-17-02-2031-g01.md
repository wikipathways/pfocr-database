caption: 'Summarized molecular pathway of BDNF/TrkB''s oncogenic role. Four signaling
  pathways are discussed in the present review: i) Phosphorylation of STAT3 activates
  the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which will then amplify H1F1a to positively control
  TrkB expression, stimulate mTORC1 for the expression of pro-survival proteins and
  reduce Bim, but increase FAIM2 in order to inhibit apoptosis or anoikis; ii) Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK
  signaling is activated in order to promote the survival, proliferation and migration
  of cancer cells; iii) activated expression of PLC-γ causes the release of calcium
  ions from intracellular compartments and the generation of diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol
  activates PKC, which exerts oncogenic effects; and iv) Transactivation of EGFR by
  BDNF/TrkB can also regulate cancer by activating the above 3 signaling pathways.
  An upwards pointing arrow after each signal protein indicates upregulation of expression
  level while a downwards facing arrow represents decreased expression. BDNF, brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor; Trk, tropomyosin receptor kinase; STAT3, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PLC-γ, phospholipase-C-γ,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase. PKC, protein kinase C; H1F1a, hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1α; FAIM2, Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2; MEK, mitogen activated protein
  kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases.'
