caption: a Schematic model of FGFR/ERK1/2 activity in the 4d micromere during late
  spiral cleavage in O. fusiformis. At 4 h post fertilisation (hpf), di-phosphorylated
  ERK1/2 (di-P-ERK1/2) is enriched in the apical most micromeres (1q111). At 5 hpf,
  an unidentified signal activates FGF receptor which di-phosphorylates ERK1/2 in
  the 4d micromere. This activates cdx and delta in 4d (becoming the endomesodermal
  precursor), which also correlates with 4d arresting its cell cycle progression,
  as 4a–4c cleave. ERK1/2 activation in 4d is required to limit anterior genes (e.g.,
  gsc) to the A–C quadrants, yet the exact nature of this interaction is unclear (dotted
  lines). In addition, ERK1/2 activity in 4d induces the expression of a battery of
  genes in the D-quadrant and part of the C-quadrant that probably induces lateral
  mesodermal and posterodorsal fates, ultimately controlling axial elongation. Beginning
  at this stage, the Notch-Delta pathway is required for normal posterodorsal development
  and might contribute to transmit the inductive activity of 4d cell to neighbouring
  cells (dotted line). b Schematic drawings of embryos at the time of anteroposterior
  axial elongation in different bilaterian lineages, with the interactions between
  FGFR, ERK1/2 and some of the candidate genes identified in this study in each lineage
  depicted to the left. The similar involvement of ERK1/2 activation in the specification
  of the D-quadrant embryonic organiser in O. fusiformis and other molluscan embryos
  suggests that the presence of an ERK1/2 positive embryonic organiser is a shared
  ancestral trait to spiral cleavage. More broadly, ERK1/2 activity induces the expression
  of a set of genes and signalling pathways that are repeatedly involved in axial
  patterning and posterior trunk growth in bilaterian embryos. While axial organisation
  and the formation of a posterior elongation centre are most often spatially and
  temporally uncoupled in most bilaterian lineages, they become integrated into a
  single developmental process of embryonic organising activity (i.e., the specification
  of the D-quadrant embryonic organiser) in spiralians. Drawings are not to scale.
