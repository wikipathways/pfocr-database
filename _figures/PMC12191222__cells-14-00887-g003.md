caption: Top2b-regulated gene, Ubb, is a key player in protein degradation and transcriptional
  regulation in the retina. The pathway is based on Lim et al., 2019 [20], Li et al.,
  2017 [11], and Lobo et al., 2021 [9]. Ubb deficiency leads to protein aggregation,
  reactive gliosis, and photoreceptor death. Red arrows denote downregulation, while
  the red cross in this figure denotes the absence of promoter binding. The upward
  blue arrow represents upregulation
