caption: The figure depicts search for similar structures in chemical space. The search
  for structurally similar polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide allows users to match
  a query molecule to the biosynthetic intermediates of experimentally characterized
  polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide. The links on the result page can be used to
  navigate to the respective page in the biosynthetic pathway database. The database
  catalogs biosynthetic pathways of >200 polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides. Chemical
  structures of each step are stored in SMILES format, along with the reactions, monomer/extender
  unit and enzymes involved. Clicking on the reaction arrow links to the respective
  module/enzyme in the genomic space of SBSPKS. The genomic space also provides a
  cross link to the chemical space. Chemical structures similar to the biosynthetic
  intermediates can be searched by clicking the intermediates.

  description: The figure depicts search for similar structures in chemical space.
    The search for structurally similar polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide allows
    users to match a query molecule to the biosynthetic intermediates of experimentally
    characterized polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide. The links on the result page
    can be used to navigate to the respective page in the biosynthetic pathway database.
    The database catalogs biosynthetic pathways of >200 polyketides and non-ribosomal
    peptides. Chemical structures of each step are stored in SMILES format, along

    reaction arrow links to the respective module/enzyme in the genomic space of SBSPKS.
    The genomic space also provides a cross link to the chemical space. Chemical structures
    similar to the biosynthetic intermediates can be searched by clicking the intermediates.
