caption: The common model of oxylipin production by oxylipin producing enzymes, including
  various lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenases, and cytochrome p450 epoxygenases. Polyunsaturated
  fatty acids are released by phospholipase A2 from the membrane, making them available
  to enzymes for downstream signalling by oxylipins. Eicosapentaenoic acid is depicted
  in red, other polyunsaturated fatty acids are depicted in blue. The relative production
  of eicosapentaenoic acid-derived oxylipins is a function of the relative provision
  of eicosapentaenoic acid to enzymes by phospholipase A2, which in turn, reflects
  their relative abundance in the phospholipid membrane. Generalized pathway activities
  are summarized. For details, see Table . COX, cyclooxygenase; CYPepox, cytochrome
  P450 expoxygenases; LOX, lipoxygenase.
