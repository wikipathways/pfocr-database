caption: The role of CHD1L in Nur77-mediated pathway during hepatocarcinogenesis.
  In normal condition, Nur77 localizes in nucleus. In response to apoptosis stimuli,
  Nur77 translocates from nucleus to mitochondria where it binds to Bcl-2 and induces
  its conformational change, thereby leading to cytochrome c (Cyt c) release into
  cytoplasm and the initiation of caspase activation and apoptosis. In HCC, CHD1L,
  which is overexpressed caused by 1q21 amplification, are able to inhibit the nucleus-to-mitochondria
  translocation of Nur77, resulting in the hindrance of cytochrome c (Cyt c) release,
  caspase activation and apoptosis.
