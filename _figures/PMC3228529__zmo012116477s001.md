caption: NO/cGMP signaling in malignant tumor. NO and cGMP participate in regulation
  of inflammation in the cancer microenvironment and contribute to proliferation and/or
  differentiation of tumor cells and surrounding supporting cells. The iNOS/NO/cGMP
  signaling pathway is not functional in glioma because of sGC-deficiency. However,
  higher concentration of NO generated by malignant cells and/or its microenvironment
  can penetrate cell membrane and increase cGMP levels in nonmalignant stroma cells.
  cGMP can be released into the intercellular space through cGMP transporters; however,
  extracellular cGMP cannot cross the cell membrane to re-enter the cells.
