caption: Schematic pathway showing a possible role for STC2 in affecting the PERK
  signalling pathway. The increased accumulation of ATF4 leads to increased expression
  of GADD34, ATF3 and STC2. Elevated levels of STC2 can alter both PERK phosphorylation
  and ATF4 levels through as yet undetermined mechanisms (dashed arrows), as well
  as promote reduced damage during pancreatic injury. Whether this protective effect
  of STC2 is a normal function of the protein needs to be clarified.
