caption: Schematic representation of AMPK-dependent anticancer activities of honokiol
  in ovarian cancer cells. AMPK is activated in response to cellular energy stress
  by sensing increasing AMP/ATP ratio, leading to the activation of LKB1. Metformin,
  phenformin, AICAR and phytochemicals may also mimic stressors and lead to AMPK activation
  in an LKB1-dependent manner. A specific AMPK pathway involves the TSC1/TSC2 complex,
  leading to the downregulation of mTOR, which regulates apoptosis, cell growth, migration
  and invasion. The mTOR pathway inhibits apoptosis via the regulation of the tumor
  suppressors p27 and p53. The mTOR/4EBP1 pathway regulates cell migration by regulating
  MMP-9. Honokiol activates AMPK, which inhibits mTOR/4EBP1 signaling, leading to
  anti-proliferative effects and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. Honokiol also
  inhibits migration and invasion via AMPK activation. The AMPK inhibitor compound
  C reverses honokiol-regulated proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion.
