caption: The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
  leads to increased activity of PI3 kinase complexes (p85 and p110) which in turn
  converts phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3); a reaction that is antagonized by the tumor suppressor Pten. PIP3 then phosphorylates
  and activates Akt, which through a series of subsequent phosphorylation events leads
  to activation of the mTOR complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTOR complexes are also
  kinases that activate via phosphorylation substrates such as S6 and 4E-BP1 that
  increase transcription of growth promoting genes. Points of pharmacologic inhibition
  that are currently the focus of drug development are shown.
