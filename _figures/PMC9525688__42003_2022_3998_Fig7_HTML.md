caption: 'a In IDLs, via the RPN12a structural component of the 19S RP, the 26S proteasome
  greatly impacts the cytokinins, ethylene, abscisic acid and auxin biosynthesis and
  signaling pathways. For instance, the tZ/cZ ratio decreases gradually leading to
  a reduction of the senescence-repressing tZ activity. IAA levels are also reduced
  possibly due to an increase of conjugated and oxidized IAA levels. The ET pathway
  is strongly enhanced by the proteasome activity, which leads to the induction of
  many catabolic processes via ORE1 and the SAGs, and primarily targeting the degradation
  of chloroplasts. The ABA degradation pathway (DPA) is lowered thus potentially increasing
  the ABA availability. JA concentration is particularly enhanced during the early
  stages of darkening perceived by the plant. The 20S CP can modulate the level of
  senescence-derived ROS, which are known to enhance the level of carbonylated proteins
  over time. In blue: negatively influenced; and in red: positively influenced, by
  the 26S proteasome during leaf senescence; b Temporal component for the regulation
  of hormone active forms by RPN12a.'
