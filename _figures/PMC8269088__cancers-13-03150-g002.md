caption: 'Targeting Notch1 pathway in CLL. Notch1 signaling is activated by one of
  the Notch ligands (DLL1,3,4 or Jagged-1,2) that binds to the Notch1 receptor on
  a contacting cell, with subsequent induction of a series of proteolytic events mediated
  by ADAM-metalloproteases and γ-secretases. These events promote the release of active
  Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates to the nucleus where activates
  the transcription of target genes together with several transcriptional regulators.
  Notch1 signaling is shut down by phosphorylation of NICD and subsequent poly-ubiquitination
  (Ub) by F-box containing protein (FBXW7) that acts as a signal for proteasomal degradation.
  In CLL, recurrent mutations in NOTCH1 PEST domain and 3′UTR stabilize the protein
  and delay its turnover. Although rare, loss of function mutations in FBXW7 has been
  also described. In CLL, Notch1 signaling modulates CCL19-driven migration and immune
  escape by PD-1/PD-L1 axis as well as T-cell exhaustion. Notch1 also induces CD20
  downregulation through an epigenetic mechanism. Targeted drugs are highlighted in
  green. Pill icon: approved drugs and Erlenmeyer icon: preclinical studies or clinical
  trials. GSIs: γ-secretase inhibitors, mAb: monoclonal antibody.'
