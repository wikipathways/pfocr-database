caption: 'The top three enriched networks of interacting proteins in SBDE-treated
  THP-1 cells, as determined by IPA. These networks were defined as: (a) cell signaling,
  gene expression, cell death, survival (score, 24; 16 differentially phosphorylated
  proteins); (b) Cellular assembly, organization, cellular function and maintenance,
  tissue development (score, 24; 16 differentially phosphorylated proteins); (c) Cell
  death and survival, gastrointestinal disease, hepatic system disease (score, 24;
  16 differentially phosphorylated proteins). Proteins represented in green (decreased)
  and red (increased) were differentially phosphorylated on the kinome array relative
  to control untreated cells. Proteins shown in white were not present in our data
  set but were added by IPA due to their connection to the enriched proteins. Scores
  were calculated from hypergeometric distribution and right-tailed Fisher’s exact
  test.SBDE: Swine Barn Dust Extracts; IPA: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.'
