caption: 'Signalling pathways in oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The pathways known to
  be operative in oesophageal adenocarcinoma are A: PI3-Kinase, B: Mitogen activated
  protein (MAP) Kinase, C: Wnt signalling and D: Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). The green
  arrows indicate activation, the red arrows indicate inhibition. Vascular epidermal
  growth factor (VEGF), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), epidermal
  growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR), insulin growth factor receptor (IGFR), hepatocyte
  growth factor receptor (MET), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and
  fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) are the known receptor tyrosine kinase
  (RTK) associated with oesophageal adenocarcinomas. The pathways are complex and
  inter-connected. For example RTKs can activate all 4 known pathways. The ultimate
  biological response varies from cell proliferation, development, apoptosis, differentiation,
  inflammatory response, angiogenesis and invasion depending on which specific pathway
  or receptor is activated. A: PI3-Kinase pathway. RTK activates PI3-Kinase directly
  or through RAS. As a consequence of phosphorylation, PI3K recruits AKT. AKT inhibits
  tuberin, this allows activation of the Raptor/mTOR complex to activate transcriptional
  machinery. mTOR/raptor activates transcription factors and co-activator proteins
  cMyc and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α that drive the biological response of
  growth, proliferation, glycolysis, angiogenesis and invasion; B: MAP Kinase pathways.
  The 3 main MAP Kinase pathways are extracellular related kinase (ERK), p38 and JUN
  kinase (JNK). They are all activated by similar RTKs. The signalling pathways have
  a common feature of a cascade of phospho-proteins. A MAPKK Kinase (e.g. RAF), a
  MAPK Kinase [e.g. MAP ERK kinase (MEK)1/2] and a MAP Kinase (eg. ERK) transfer the
  signal onto multiple transcription factors on gene promoters[]. ERK signalling for
  example can alter the gene expression of over 200 genes[]. The subsequent biological
  response varies from cell proliferation, development, apoptosis, differentiation
  and inflammatory response, depending on the specific pathway activated; C: Wnt signalling.
  Wnt signalling exerts a biological response through release of β catenin into the
  nucleus with subsequent action on gene promoters. β catenin is released directly
  from RTK phosphorylation of Axin. Alternatively Wnt ligands bind to Frizzled receptors
  and form a complex with the LRP5/6 membrane receptor. The membrane receptor complex
  recruits dishevelled and axin from a cytoplasmic complex of dishevelled, Axin, adenomatous
  polyposis coli protein (APC) and β catenin. This allows release of β catenin; D:
  NF-κB pathway. NF-κB (p65p50) activates gene promoters only when released from IκB.
  Interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α and radiation activate the pathway.
  Adding to complexity, ERK MAP Kinase and Wnt, through protein Kinase C, can also
  potentially activate NF-κB although this link has not been investigated in oesophageal
  adenocarcinoma.'
