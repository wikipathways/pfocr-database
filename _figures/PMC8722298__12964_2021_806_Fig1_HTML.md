caption: 'PCCS: Pancreatic cancer cells. PCCs and PSCs are based on the mechanism
  of interaction between sEVs. Pancreatic cancer-derived sEVs activate the LIN28B
  /let-7/HMGA2/PDGFB signaling pathway by expressing LIN28B, and recruit PSCs from
  afar to promote the formation of pre-metastatic niches. Secondly, the expression
  of miR-1246 and miR-1290 sEVs formed an inflammatory environment of niche by promoting
  the expression of PSCs fibrosis and other related genes. Conversely, miR-5703 expressed
  on PSCS-derived sEVs activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, miR-21 enhanced RAS /ERK signaling
  activity, and in anoxic environment: Both miR-4465 and miR-616-3p ultimately promoted
  the proliferation and metastasis of pancreatic cancer by inhibiting the PTEN/ Akt
  pathway'
