caption: Cartoon depicting the possible mechanism and regulation of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis
  is mainly regulated by Fe homeostasis, lipid oxidation, System Xc−, and VDAC. The
  most important in the ferroptosis signaling pathway is the production of iron ions
  and ROS. GPX-4 is a key regulator of ferroptosis. Inhibition of GPX-4 causes a large
  amount of lipid peroxides to aggregate, becoming a sign of ferroptosis.
