caption: Schematic diagram of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage response
  and DNA repair. Cell-cycle checkpoints are activated in response to IR-induced DNA
  damage. ATM kinase is activated primarily by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and
  mediates the initial response to DSBs as well as cell-cycle arrest through activation
  of CHK2. P53 activates the G1/S checkpoint via p21 to promote DNA repair or to induce
  apoptosis or senescence. DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) activate ATR kinase, which
  in turn activates the S-phase checkpoint and G2/M checkpoint through the action
  of CHK1 and WEE1. The base excision repair (BER) repairs SSBs and base damage with
  fast kinetics. Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repairs most direct 2-ended IR-induced
  DSBs and is the main pathway to repair DSBs in the G1 phase. Homologous recombination
  (HR) is essential for the repair of complicated DSBs and can only function in the
  presence of sister chromatids during the S and G2 phase.
