caption: Schematic presentation of the prion protein scrapie (PrPSc) accumulation
  and subsequent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mediated activation of the iinositol
  requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), double stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like
  ER kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). PERK pathway, through
  PERK phosphorylation and translation of initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) phosphorylation,
  inactivates eIF2α and attenuates translation via activating transcription factor
  4 (ATF4), which ultimately results in activation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)
  and pro-apototic, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34) and
  ER oxido-reductin 1 (ER01) genes. IRE1 pathway activates apoptotic signaling via
  BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) and BCL2 antagonist/killer (BAK). TNF receptor associated
  factor 2 (TRAF2), results in the activation of IkB kinase (IKK) and apoptosis signal
  regulating kinase (ASK), IKK through inhibitory kappa B (IkB) activates nuclear
  factor of kappa B (NFkB) and ultimately apoptotic signaling occurs. On the other
  hand ASK phosphorylation results in the activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal protein
  kinase (JNK) and p38 pathway of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.
  Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) results
  in death via conjunction with JNK. Activating Transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathway
  via site 1 and site 2 proteases (S1P and S2P) activates transcription factor p50
  in nucleus.
