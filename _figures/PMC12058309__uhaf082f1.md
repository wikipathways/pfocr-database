caption: The biosynthesis, metabolism and signaling of SA. (A) Both isochorismate
  synthase (ICS) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) pathways start from chorismate.
  For the proposed PAL pathway, SA can be synthesized from Phe through a series of
  enzymatic reactions. In Arabidopsis, most pathogen-induced SA is generated from
  ICS pathway. Chorismate (CA) is converted to isochorismate (IC) by ICS1/ICS2. IC
  is then transported to cytosol by the MATE transporter ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY
  5 (EDS5), where IC is converted to SA. To regulate SA levels, SA undergoes different
  chemical modifications, including glycosylation, methylation and hydroxylation.
  (B) When SA levels are low in the uninfected state, NPR3/4 interact with TGA2/5/6
  to inhibit the expression of SA-induced defense genes. While in the presence of
  elevated SA levels, the transcriptional repression activities of NPR3/4 have been
  suppressed. At the same time, binding of SA promotes the transcriptional activation
  of NPR1, which recruits transcription factors to induce expression of defense-related
  genes. PBS3, AVRPPHB SUSCEPTIBLE 3 (PBS3); IC-9-Glu, isochorismate-9-glutamate;
