caption: Pharmacological approaches to target IL-6 and IL-11 signaling. Current inhibitors
  of IL-6 and IL-11 signaling include protein antagonists such as cytokine mutants
  and antibodies, small molecule protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors targeting
  gp130, recombinant IL-11, small molecule inhibitors of proteins in the intracellular
  JAK-STAT pathway, and decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) targeting the STAT3 mRNA.
