caption: Amino acids are synthesised from the carbon metabolic intermediates of glycolysis,
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and the TCA cycle and from nitrogen. Aspartate
  (ASP) is formed from the amination of oxaloacetate (OAA) produced from the TCA cycle.
  Glutamate (GLU) is formed from the amination of 2-oxoglutarate or α-ketoglutarate
  (OXG) produced from the TCA cycle. ASP is the nitrogen and carbon–nitrogen donor
  to other amino acids including threonine (THR), methionine (MET), lysine (LYS),
  isoleucine (ILE), and asparagine (ASN). GLU is the carbon–nitrogen donor for proline
  (PRO) and glutamine (GLN). Both ASP and GLU are precursors for the synthesis of
  arginine (ARG). Serine (SER) synthesized by the amination of 3-phosphoglyceric acid
  (PGA); SER is the precursor for glycine (GLY) and cysteine (CYS). Histidine (HIS),
  phenylalanine (PHE), tyrosine (TYR), and tryptophan (TRP) are synthesised from PPP
  and glycolytic intermediates (erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) and phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP)) along with GLU, GLN, or ASP as the nitrogen donor. Valine (VAL), alanine
  (ALA), and leucine (LEU) are synthesized from the amination of the glycolytic intermediate
  pyruvate (PYR). Carbon and nitrogen atoms in amino acids are shown as black and
  red circles respectively. Figure was created with Biorender.com.
