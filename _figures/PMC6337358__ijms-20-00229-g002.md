caption: Therapeutic window for cancer cells in the presence of an OXPHOS inhibitor.
  (Top) Normal body cells have moderate ATP demand and adequate levels of oxygen and
  glucose. Thus, they survive in presence of OXPHOS inhibitors by upregulating glycolysis
  to meet their ATP demands. Middle panel. Highly proliferating cancer cells have
  extraordinarily high ATP demand and adequate levels of oxygen and glucose. Despite
  glycolytic pathway upregulation, OXPHOS inhibition causes cancer cells not to be
  able to meet their ATP demand and die. (Bottom) Quiescent cancer cells have low
  ATP demand but live in a highly compromised microenvironments characterized by low
  glucose and hypoxia. For these cells, inhibition of OXPHOS is lethal as there is
  not sufficient glucose to compensate for the loss of ATP production. Thicker arrows
  indicate relatively greater activity. Bold text indicates a relatively higher abundance
  of the item.
