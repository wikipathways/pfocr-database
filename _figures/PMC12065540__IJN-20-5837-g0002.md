caption: Pathogenesis of Diabetic Ulcers. (1) In a high-glucose environment, the increased
  production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induces oxidative stress, leading to
  mitochondrial damage and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This promotes
  the differentiation of neutrophils and M1 macrophages, while reducing Nuclear factor
  erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2) activation, resulting in decreased levels of
  superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and other antioxidants,
  ultimately reducing cellular antioxidant capacity.(2) The TGF-β/Smad pathway is
  often inhibited, delaying tissue repair and wound closure.(3) Moreover, the activation
  of ROS and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway reduce the proliferation
  and migration ability of endothelial cells and fibroblasts, thereby decreasing angiogenesis
  around the wound.Yellow arrows represent the antagonistic effects of high glucose,
  and red arrows represent the inhibitory effects of high glucose
