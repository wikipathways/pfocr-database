caption: Schematic Overview of FOXM1 and LINC-ROR Regulatory SignalingLINC-ROR, which
  was activated by FOXM1 through promoter binding and transferred to the cytoplasm,
  then upregulated FOXM1 expression by competitively sponging miR-876-5p, forming
  a positive regulatory signaling pathway to promote proliferation and induce chemoresistance
  in HCC cells.
