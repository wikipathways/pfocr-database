caption: Schematic representation of the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation pathway.
  (A) Sequential action of E1 (ubiquitin activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin conjugating
  enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) enzymes in substrate ubiquitination. Ubiquitin
  is denoted as Ub. After multiple ubiquitin molecules are attached to the substrate
  forming lysine (K)-48, it can get degraded by the 26S proteasome. (B) Different
  kinds of polyubiquitin chains formed inside the cell and their cellular functions.
  Seven different ubiquitin lysine residues can be used for sequential chain formation
  and, based on the position of chain formation, functions vary.
