caption: Activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways can
  occur by upstream mutations in growth factor receptors or by mutations in upstream
  kinases and coupling molecules. In addition, intrinsic members of the two pathways
  are frequently mutated in human cancer. Genes in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
  pathways that have activating mutations detected in human cancer and proliferative
  diseases are indicated in red ovals. Four mutations have been detected in the RHEB
  gene in 903 samples present in the Sanger Institute COSMIC database. Four mutations
  have been observed in the p70S6K gene (RBS6KB1) out of 1047 samples examined (Sanger
  Institute COSMIC database. Also loss of tumor suppressor genes such as PTEN, PP2A,
  NF1 DUSP5, TSC1, TSC2 can contribute to activation of certain pathways. These are
  indicated in black octagons if they are phosphatases or black squares if they are
  coupling molecules. Other kinases not frequently mutated in human cancer are indicated
  in green symbols. PIP2 and PIP3 are indicated in yellow ovals. The 4E-BP1and eIF-4E
  proteins are indicated in purple ovals. mTORC1 phosphorylates the unc-51-like kinase
  1 (ULK1) which results in the suppression of autophagy. ULK1 is indicated in a black
  oval. The mTORC1 inhibitor prevents phosphorylation of ULK1 and autophagy can occur.
  Red arrows indicate activating events in pathways. Black arrows indicate inactivating
  events in pathway. Activating phosphorylation events are depicted in red circles
  with Ps with a black outlined circle. Inactivating phosphorylation events are depicted
  in black circles with Ps with a red outlined circle.
