caption: Map of mechanisms of inducing AR expression in HCC showing linkages to mTOR,
  lipogenesis, and CCRK-mediated signaling. The splice variants shown demonstrate
  a non-androgen-mediated pathway of AR signaling, however, the effects of AR-SV signaling
  may not be directly in line with AR-FL signaling and further study is warranted
  to elucidate the impacts of AR-SVs on these pathways. (A) mTORC1 interacts with
  AR by both inhibiting AR degradation and upregulating AR activity. (B) AR-FL target
  gene FKBP5 scaffolds onto PHLPP1, an AKT phosphatase, to inhibit AKT phosphorylation
  by extension mTORC1 activity forming a feedback loop. (C) mTORC1 upregulates AR
  activity by phosphorylating AR at serine 96. (D) Specific DAGs from lipogenesis
  can increase Akt activity through binding at an unknown effector protein leading
  to increased AKT -mediated AR activity. (E) CCRK phosphorylates GSK3ß deactivating
  it, which leads to both activation of β-catenin and inhibition of TSC2 by preventing
  its phosphorylation by GSK3ß. Figure created in BioRender.
