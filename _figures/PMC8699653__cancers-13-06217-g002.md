caption: Pathways and genes involved in melanoma development. Aberrantly methylated
  genes and signal transduction pathways frequently altered during melanoma development
  and/or progression. (a) Shows the MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways; while (b) depicts
  the p53, Rb, retinoic acid signaling, and DNA repair pathways. Hypermethylated TSGs
  are marked with a red dot; the alteration induced in the downstream pathway by TSG
  hypermethylation is represented by a red cross. The diagrams were created by means
  of https://biorender.com/ (accession date 8 October 2021).
