caption: Trauma is responsible for inducing sudden biochemical changes that occur
  at the time of impact. During TBI, gp91phox is immediately upregulated. Subsequently,
  ROS overproduction by NADPH oxidase contributes to BBB damage and brain edema formation
  through the activation of downstream signaling molecules. After TBI, ROS activates
  ERK1/2, inducing increased MMP-9 synthesis and ZO-1 degradation. Inhibition of gp91phox-triggered
  ROS production may help prevent the disruption of the BBB and brain edema post-TBI.
  In the present study, rhubarb is reported to be an effective inhibitor of gp91phox-derived
  ROS production as a treatment for TBI. The underlying mechanisms include ROS-mediated
  ERK1/2 induction, followed by MMP-9 degradation and increased ZO-1 expression. Furthermore,
  rhein exerted similar neuroprotective effects as its parent herb rhubarb through
  the signaling pathway described above.
