caption: Mechanism of action of Gln in DKD. Gln induces the GPX4 enzyme through the
  synthesis of glutathione (GSH) to alleviate oxidative stress caused by iron death.
  Meanwhile, glucose generates fructose-6-phosphate (Fruc-6-P) through glycolysis,
  which later synthesizes glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) with Gln, and GlcN-6-P
  is transformed to N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6-P) catalyzed by glucosamine
  phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNPNAT) through phosphate glucose metastases 3 (PGM3)
  to N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-P), followed by an enzymatic reaction
  to generate uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which can mediate
  renal cell dysfunction via the OGT-Polycomb-Knot-Sns pathway, while inhibiting synthesis
  of glycogen synthase GSK-3β, which can release HSF1 receptors, thereby enhancing
  heat shock gene expression and stimulating inflammatory responses. In addition,
  GlcNAc-1-P can activate protein kinase C (PKC), which in turn stimulates TGF-β gene
  expression and damages renal cells. The hexosamine pathway’s rate-limiting enzyme
  is GFAT, and through the regulation of Glutamine-fructose-6-phosphatase aminotransferase
  (GFAT), it can reduce TGF-β expression, as well as reduce the production of UDP-GlcNAc,
  which in turn reduces the heat shock inflammatory response and mitigates the extent
  of renal cell injury.
