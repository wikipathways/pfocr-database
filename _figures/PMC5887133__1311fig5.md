caption: Diagram of core components in the Wg pathway. (A) In the absence of Wg signaling,
  Arm is presented by Apc and Axin to CK1 and Zw3/GSK for phosphorylation, targeting
  it for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Tcf binds target genes
  and, with the Gro transcriptional corepressor, keeps expression repressed. (B) Wg,
  concentrated at the cell surface by glycosaminoglycans on the glypican Dally, binds
  the Fz and Arrow receptors and causes them to cluster. This allows polymerization
  of Dsh and Axin at the plasma membrane, inactivating the kinase complex so that
  it cannot target Arm for destruction. Stabilized Arm translocates into the nucleus,
  binds to Tcf, and recruits the transcriptional activation complex, which includes
  Lgs and Pygo. Structural features of proteins depicted here are based on data from
  , .
