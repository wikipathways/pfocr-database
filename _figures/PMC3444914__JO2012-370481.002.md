caption: The dual functions of APE1/Ref-1. As a DNA repair protein, APE1/Ref-1 functions
  as the primary enzyme responsible for recognition and repair of mutagenic apurinic/apyrimidinic
  (AP) sites in DNA as part of the base excision repair (BER) pathway. As a redox
  protein, APE1/Ref-1 functions as an activator of transcription factors involved
  in multiple cellular processes, including AP-1, p53, NF-κB, HIF-1α, and others.
  Activation involves the reduction of a cysteine residue to a sulfhydryl state. Dietary
  agents may target APE1/Ref-1 DNA repair or redox activities or both, causing multiple
  downstream effects.
