caption: Immune landscape in smoker and never-smoker lung cancer patients. NSCLCs
  from smokers have high TMB and a higher mutational smoking signature and neoantigens
  generation are associated with higher levels of immune infiltration, higher production
  of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta and IL-17, higher cytolytic activity
  and interferon-gamma pathway signaling. On the other hand, the immune microenvironment
  of the non-smoking group is significantly enriched for immunosuppressive related
  cells, including Treg cells, suppressor CD4+ or CD8+ T cells and M2 macrophages.
  In addition to the lower expression of PD-L1, the interaction between PD-L2 (APCs)
  and PD-1 (T cells) inhibits strong B7-CD28 signals and reduces cytokine production.
  In particular, air pollution and oxidative stress can lead to DNA damage and ROS
  release by resident lung macrophages and subsequent immunopathology and tissue damage.
  Macrophages can be a source of proinflammatory, and pro-fibrotic cytokines and neutrophils
  play a role in chronic inflammation in general (CXCL8). Finally, fibroblasts respond
  to excessive and aberrant wound healing by entering hyperproliferation and change
  to a pro-fibrotic phenotype resistant to apoptosis. Figure designed using Biorender.com.
