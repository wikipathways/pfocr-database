caption: 'IPA analysis of the signaling networks between AhR signaling and NRF2 signaling.
  The canonical pathways of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling (blue arrow),
  NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response pathway (orange arrow), and KEAP1-NEF2L2
  (NRF2) pathway (yellow arrow) are selected from the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
  system (https://www.nihlibrary.nih.gov/resources/tools/ingenuity-pathways-analysis-ipa
  accessed on 30 August 2024). For the construction of signaling networks, AhR signaling
  is considered as the major axis, and the other two pathways are indicated with “CP:
  KEAP1-NEF2L2 Pathway” and “CP: NRF2-mediated Oxidative Stress Response”, respectively.
  The web-based IPA bioinformatic software is applied to overlay with each signaling
  pathway and to indicate the crosstalk molecules by the cross line between two signaling
  pathways'
