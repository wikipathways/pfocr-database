caption: 'C3G participates in the second wave of Rap1 activation induced by thrombin,
  which leads to its activation by phosphorylation at Tyr504 through the PKC-Src pathway.
  C3G phosphorylation is also regulated by ERKs and p38 MAPKs: ERKs inhibit the Shp2
  tyrosine phosphatase, allowing C3G phosphorylation, and both MAPKs control the production
  of TXA2. C3G, via Rap1-dependent and -independent mechanisms, regulates TXA2synthesis
  through a negative feedback loop involving the inhibition of cPLA2. PLC: phospholipase
  C; DAG: diacylglycerol; AA: arachidonic acid; TXA2: thromboxane A2; TXA2R: TXA2
  receptor; cPLA2: cytosolic phospholipase A2; BIS: bisindolylmaleimide, an inhibitor
  of PKC; PP2: a Src inhibitor; wortmannin: a PI3K inhibitor; SHP099: a Shp2 inhibitor;
  U0126: an ERK inhibitor; SB203580: a p38α/β MAPK inhibitor; aspirin: a cyclooxygenase
  inhibitor. Dashed gray lines indicate a hypothetical Rap1-dependent pathway that
  could regulate the activation of ERKs and p38 MAPKs.'
