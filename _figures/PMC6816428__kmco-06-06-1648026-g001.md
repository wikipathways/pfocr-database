caption: Crosstalk between the Hippo pathway and Multi-vulval class B (MuvB) complexes.
  a) When Hippo signaling is ON, the upstream Hippo kinases are active and phosphorylate
  the downstream effector Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), leading to its cytoplasmic
  retention and degradation. One of the Hippo kinases, large tumor suppressor kinase
  2 (LATS2), stimulates the ability of the dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation
  regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) to phosphorylate the MuvB core, resulting in the assembly
  of the repressor dimerization partner, RB-like, E2F and multi-vulval class B (DREAM)
  complex and in the repression of G1/S and G2/M genes. b) When Hippo signaling is
  OFF, DREAM cannot be assembled, YAP1 is active and translocates into the nucleus.
  There it binds to enhancers and stimulates the binding of the transcription factor
  MYB proto-oncogene like 2 (B-MYB) to MuvB-bound promoters through chromatin-looping,
  thereby leading to an increased G2/M gene expression and proliferation.
