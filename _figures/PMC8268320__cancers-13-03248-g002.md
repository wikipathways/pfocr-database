caption: 'Schematic representation of the effects of TGF-β on the stromal cell types
  of hepatocellular carcinoma. (A) Effects on CAF: TGF-β stimulates the activation
  of HSC and the maintenance of the myofibroblastic phenotype, which, upon malignant
  transformation of hepatocytes into HCC cells, become CAF. CAF produce (i) TGF-β,
  that acts on HCC cells inducing EMT, and enhance vascular mimicry formation in HCC
  cells together with SDF1, (ii) other chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CCL7 and CXCL16) that
  enhance TGF-β activity on HCC cells leading to metastasis. (B) Effects on endothelial
  cells: TGF-β may promote migration and proliferation of endothelial cells by (i)
  directly acting on endothelial cells or (ii) inducing VEGF secretion by HCC cells.
  (C) Effects on the immune system: TGF-β may increase the levels of soluble MICA
  and weaken the action of natural killer (NK) cells through its binding to NKG2D.
  TGF-β can also downregulate NKG2D expression or repress the mTOR pathway impairing
  tumor recognition. TGF-β can also act on tumor associated macrophages (TAM) that
  secrete growth factors and promote migration of endothelial cells and angiogenesis.
  TGF-β can favor the generation of tolerogenic dendritic cells (DC) and impair the
  activation of effector T lymphocytes and their cytotoxic activity. TGF-β promotes
  the conversion of conventional CD4 or CD8 T cells into immunosuppressive Treg cells
  that can hinder the antitumor activity of the adaptive immune response. CAF: cancer
  associated fibroblasts, ECM: extracellular matrix, EMT Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition,
  HSC: hepatic stellate cells, MF: myofibroblasts, Teff: effector T cells, Treg: T
  regulatory cells.'
