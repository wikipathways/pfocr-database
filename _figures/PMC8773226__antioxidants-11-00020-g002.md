caption: A mechanistic model for the biosynthesis of lemongrass essential oil and
  its crosstalk with other metabolic processes. Different cellular organelles work
  in tandem for oil production in lemongrass leaves. The lemongrass chloroplast, like
  most of the other plants, produces glucose through photosynthesis. The glucose undergoes
  glycolysis in the cytoplasm and yields pyruvate, a two-carbon compound. Lemongrass
  uses pyruvate as a substrate for the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP)
  units, either through the cytoplasmic mevalonate (MVA) pathway or plastidic methylerythritol
  phosphate (MEP) pathway in their young and rapidly growing leaves. Alternatively,
  mitochondria can import pyruvate and yield citrate through the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle. The citrate can transform into Acetyl-CoA and join the MVA pathway
  to yield IPP units. The IPP produced through both pathways is converted into geraniol
  mediated by geranyl diphosphate (GPP) in lemongrass plastids. The geraniol is considered
  as a precursor for essential oil biosynthesis in lemongrass and yields all the major
  components through multiple reversible and irreversible reactions. The plastidic
  bubble highlights these reactions along with their substrates. DMAPP, dimethylallyl
