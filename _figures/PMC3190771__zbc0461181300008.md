caption: Model for hyperglycemia-induced 4E-BP1 O-GlcNAcylation and truncation. Under
  diabetic conditions, a combination of hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia produce
  increased 4E-BP1 binding to eIF4E to inhibit the translation of mRNAs through a
  cap-dependent process. Hyperglycemia-driven increased flux through the hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP) leads to O-GlcNAcylation of numerous proteins. Repressed
  insulin-signaling occurs in response to both hypoinsulinemia and O-GlcNAcylation
  of IRS-1 and Akt, leading to reduced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by the mTORC1 signaling
  pathway. Hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 binds strongly to eIF4E, whereas phosphorylation
  leads to dissociation. Reductions in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation are associated with
  increased 4E-BP1 O-GlcNAcylation, which enhances the interaction of 4E-BP1 with
  eIF4E independent of the phosphorylation state. In addition, O-GlcNAcylation of
  p53 blocks its proteasomal degradation, potentially increasing p53-mediated truncation
  of 4E-BP1. Truncated 4E-BP1 is almost completely unphosphorylated and interacts
  strongly with eIF4E. Although phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 inhibits its truncation,
  it is possible that O-GlcNAcylation may serve a role in directly promoting truncation,
  thereby further enhancing its interaction with eIF4E (dashed line).
