caption: Model depicting the E2Fs-FA/BRCA axis in the control of cell fate. The model
  shown depicts the E2F-regulated expression of the FA/BRCA pathway as key determinants
  for cells entering into the DNA damage/repair pathway or the S phase of the cell
  cycle. Otherwise, cells go into apoptosis, which is exclusively regulated by E2F1
  among the E2Fs. The promoter regions cloned for FANCA, FANCC, and FANCJ were identified
  as target sequences of E2Fs in the present study (surrounded by box). The regulation
  of FANCD2, FANCG, and FANCL as well as BRCA1 by E2Fs has also been previously reported
  or deposited in the public database (underlined). As posttranslational events, FANCA,
  FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, and FANCL proteins trigger monoubiquitination of the
  FANCD2 protein during the S phase of the cell cycle and after DNA damage. Monoubiquitinated
  FANCD2 colocalizes in nuclear foci with BRCA1, FANCD1, and NBS1.
