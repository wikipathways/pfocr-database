caption: 'mRNA vaccines immunogenicity. The mRNA delivered in mRNA vaccines enters
  cells through endocytosis and is subsequently released from endosome into the cytoplasm,
  where ribosomes translate it into proteins. The proteins are degraded into peptides
  by proteasomes and presented on the cell surface as antigens by MHC-I. These antigens
  bind to T-cell receptors (TCRs), activating CD8+ T cells, which secrete perforins
  and granzymes to kill infected cells. Proteins secreted extracellularly are phagocytosed
  by APCs and degraded into peptides within lysosomes. These peptides are then presented
  on the cell surface by MHC-II for recognition by CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells can
  not only activate cellular immune responses by secreting cytokines but also induce
  humoral immune responses by activating B cells. ssRNA in mRNA vaccines binds to
  Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 within endosomes, while dsRNA interacts with TLR3,
  Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and Melanoma Differentiation-Associated
  protein 5 (MDA-5). These interactions induce the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and type I IFN (IFN-I), thereby activating antiviral innate immune responses,
  through which mRNA exhibits a self-adjuvant effect. Additionally, dsRNA also can
  activate PKR and OAS. IFN-I binds to Interferon-α/β Receptor (IFNAR) and trigger
  the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, inducing the expression of PKR and OAS, thereby
  exerting a negative regulatory effect on the immune response. Green arrow: cellular
