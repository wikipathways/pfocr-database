caption: LH regulates testosterone synthesis in LCs through multiple pathways. LH
  synthesized by the pituitary gland is transported to the testes via the bloodstream,
  where it binds to the G-protein-coupled receptor LHR on the surface of LCs. This
  activation leads to the stimulation of adenylate cyclase (AC) and Phospholipase
  C, resulting in the production of cAMP from ATP and the conversion of PIP2 to IP3
  and DAG. cAMP activates PKA, which phosphorylates transcription factors such as
  CREB, leading to the expression of StAR protein or genes involved in testosterone
  synthesis. PKA can also directly contribute to the phosphorylation of StAR protein.
  Additionally, cAMP activates epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) on the LC
  surface, initiating the MAPK signaling pathway through Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK phosphorylation,
  further enhancing gene expression and StAR protein phosphorylation for increased
  transport capacity. DAG and IP3 activate PKC and IP3Rs on the endoplasmic reticulum,
  promoting calcium ion release. Calcium ions, in turn, activate CamK, inducing gene
  expression to facilitate testosterone synthesis. Transcription factor Foxo3 inhibits
  testosterone synthesis, but LH can suppress Foxo3 inhibition by activating Pi3K
  and downstream Akt. Excess testosterone promotes PDE-mediated cAMP degradation,
  activating AMPK to inhibit testosterone synthesis. Testosterone also inhibits its
  own synthesis by activating ROBO receptors to suppress Akt. These pathways cooperate
  to maintain dynamic equilibrium in testosterone synthesis. (The production of testosterone
  in LCs is shown in Figure 2.) Figure support was provided by Figdraw (www.figdraw.com)

  description: LH regulates testosterone synthesis in LCs through multiple pathways.
    LH synthesized by the pituitary gland is transported to the testes via the bloodstream,
    where it binds to the G-protein-coupled receptor LHR on the surface of LCs. This
    activation leads to the stimulation of adenylate cyclase (AC) and Phospholipase

    IP3 and DAG. cAMP activates PKA, which phosphorylates transcription factors such
    as CREB, leading to the expression of StAR protein or genes involved in testosterone
    synthesis. PKA can also directly contribute to the phosphorylation of StAR protein.
    Additionally, cAMP activates epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) on the
    LC surface, initiating the MAPK signaling pathway through Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK
    phosphorylation, further enhancing gene expression and StAR protein phosphorylation
    for increased transport capacity. DAG and IP3 activate PKC and IP3Rs on the endoplasmic

    inducing gene expression to facilitate testosterone synthesis. Transcription factor
    Foxo3 inhibits testosterone synthesis, but LH can suppress Foxo3 inhibition by
    activating Pi3K and downstream Akt. Excess testosterone promotes PDE-mediated
    cAMP degradation, activating AMPK to inhibit testosterone synthesis. Testosterone
    also inhibits its own synthesis by activating ROBO receptors to suppress Akt.
    These pathways cooperate to maintain dynamic equilibrium in testosterone synthesis.
