caption: The main pathways for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) metabolism in plants and
  the signaling networks involving auxin, NO, and cellular messengers. The main results
  of this article involving this pathway are represented by plain red lines. Possible
  implications derived from our results are indicated by dashed red lines. Plain arrow
  heads indicate inhibition/reduction. Plain black arrows represent described metabolic
  routes, while dashed black arrows describe not yet clear pathways. Organelles are
  not drawn to scale. AMIDASE-LIKE PROTEIN 1 (AMI1), anthranilate (ANTANTHRANILATE
  SYNTHASE α SUBUNIT 1), (ASA1), ANTHRANILATE SYNTHASE β SUBUNIT 1 (ASB1), cyclic
  GMP (cGMP), CYTOCHROME P450, family 79, sub-family B, polypeptides 2 and 3 (CYP79B2/B3),
  guanylate cyclase (GC), indole-3-acetamide(IAM), indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN), indole-3-acetaldoxime
  (IAOx), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA), mitogen activated
  protein kinase signaling (MAPK), phenylalanine (Phe), TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE
  OF ARABIDOPSIS 1 (TAA1), TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE-RELATED PROTEIN (TAR), TRYPTOPHAN
  AMINOTRANSFERASE (Trp-AT), REVERSALOFSAV3PHENOTYPE 1 (VAS1), and YUCCA flavin-containing
  monooxygenases (YUC).
