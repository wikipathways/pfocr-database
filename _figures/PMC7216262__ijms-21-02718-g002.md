caption: 'This figure illustrates the ways in which activity from the mTOR signaling
  pathway contributes to appendage (a) or muscle regeneration (b,c): (a) Concerning
  appendage regeneration, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and insulin-like growth factor
  (IGF-1) activate mTORC1. This activity leads to the wound covering, blastema formation
  and regenerative outgrowth of the appendage. (b) During muscle regeneration, mTORC1
  activity is necessary for myofiber growth but not myogenesis. mTORC1 inhibition
  by rapamycin treatment inhibits regeneration whereas the leucine amino acid, insulin-like
  growth factor 1 or Akt activity contribute to mTORC1-mediated muscle regeneration.
  SPAR regulatory protein (small regulatory polypeptide of amino acid response) can
  inhibit mTORC1 activity and hinder muscle regeneration. (c) mTORC1 signaling is
  necessary for muscle regeneration in the injured limb and to induce a Galert state
  in the contralateral limb. The Galert cells enter the cell cycle more rapidly and
  show an increase in size compared to quiescent satellite cells.'
