caption: Illustrations of novel techniques used to detect interactions in the p53
  pathway. (a) Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCS) used to study the
  p53-MDM2 interaction in living cells. FCS uses proteins that are labelled independently
  with different fluorescent probes. Analysis of the FCS data examines minute fluctuations
  in fluorescence intensity induced by a low number of diffusing labelled molecules,
  caused by spontaneous deviations from the mean in thermal equilibrium in a confocal
  configuration []. (b) Proximity ligation assay (PLA), used to study the interaction
  of the p53 mRNA in the RING domain of HDM2 and the formation of the N-terminal HDMX-HDM2
  heterodimer. This technique consists of two primary antibodies generated in different
  species that recognize the proteins of interest and two secondary antibodies that
  carry oligonucleotide sequences that are ligated and amplified, allowing detection
  by fluorophores []. (c) Proximity ligation ELISA (PLE) set to investigate the trimeric
  interaction among MDM2 and the nascent p53 peptide on isolated p53 polysomes (via
  RPL5 or RPL11). PLE involves three primary antibodies. One capture antibody (i.e.,
  from goat), targeting one binding factor and a set of primary antibodies (from mouse
  and rabbit), targeting two additional binding factors. Upon capturing the trimeric
  complex via the capture antibody, recognizing one of the binding partners, signal
  amplification, and detection is performed following the principles of PLA.
