caption: 'Pathway analysis of statistically differentially expressed genes. (A,B)
  Relationships of the 24 selected HUVEC genes and the 25 selected mouse genes to
  “Radiation” and common genes/proteins (highlighted in blue) involved in the response
  to ionizing radiation: CXCL8 (MIP-1 in mouse), CXCL12, IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6,
  IL-10, NF-κB1, PTGS2, REL, RELA, RELB, TNFα and TP53. (C,D) Networks of statistically
  differentially expressed genes linked by the regulating cell process “Cell adhesion”.
  Genes in blue and red ovals are respectively under- and over-expressed at the indicated
  days post-irradiation. Relationship details are given in Supplementary Table .'
