caption: 'Insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling with regard to Helicobacter pylori
  associated glucose dysregulation. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), upon binding
  to its receptor IGF-1R, activates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. IGF-1R
  then phosphorylates substrate proteins, including members of the IRS family such
  as IRS1 and Shc on selective tyrosine residues. Downstream to the receptors are
  two major pathways: the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and MAPK
  pathway. IGF-1 acts via the MAPK pathway to mediate growth responses. The PI3K pathway
  is thought to have predominantly metabolic effects. We supposed that this pathway
  might play a part in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) associated abnormal glucose
  metabolism and the upregulation of HbA1c. SHC: Spontaneous human combustion.'
