caption: miRNAs regulating the conserved pathways of aging in skeletal muscle. During
  aging, TNF-β signaling pathway is excessively activated in skeletal muscle. miR-26a,
  miR-675, miR-146b, and miR-431 inhibit the TNF-β signaling pathway and improve the
  regeneration of aged skeletal muscle. In contrast, growth factors such as insulin-like
  growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and cell cycle regulators such as CDK6 are downregulated
  during the aging process of skeletal muscle. miR-29, miR-125b, miR-143-3p, and let-7
  inhibit myogenesis by targeting those factors. Two well-known aging modulators,
  Sirt1 and Tert, are also downregulated with age and they are targeted by miR-195.
  These miRNAs that target the aging pathways in muscle tissues could be explored
  as therapeutic targets against muscle aging or aging-related muscle diseases by
  manipulating their expression.

  description: miRNAs regulating the conserved pathways of aging in skeletal muscle.
    During aging, TNF-β signaling pathway is excessively activated in skeletal muscle.
    miR-26a, miR-675, miR-146b, and miR-431 inhibit the TNF-β signaling pathway and
    improve the regeneration of aged skeletal muscle. In contrast, growth factors
    such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and cell cycle regulators such as
    CDK6 are downregulated during the aging process of skeletal muscle. miR-29, miR-125b,
    miR-143-3p, and let-7 inhibit myogenesis by targeting those factors. Two well-known
    aging modulators, Sirt1 and Tert, are also downregulated with age and they are
    targeted by miR-195. These miRNAs that target the aging pathways in muscle tissues
    could be explored as therapeutic targets against muscle aging or aging-related
    muscle diseases by manipulating their expression.
