caption: Mitochondria can be recruited into the apoptotic signalling pathway by Bid
  and Bax, which translocate from the cytosol to the mitochondrial outer membrane
  under apoptotic stimuli. Bid translocates as a truncated form (t-Bid) after cleavage
  by caspase-8. Bax is processed on the outer membrane to an active form (Bax*), a
  process possibly facilitated by t-Bid. Bax induces the release of apoptosis-inducing
  factor (AIF), procaspase-9, cytochrome c (cyt c) and other intermembrane space proteins
  to the cytosol. Cytochrome c binds to the adaptor protein Apaf-1, which is then
  able to bind procaspase-9 and -8, which are thus cleaved to their active forms.
