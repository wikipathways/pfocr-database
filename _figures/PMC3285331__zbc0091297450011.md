caption: Proposed mechanism for FTY720-stimulated β-cell regeneration in vivo. S1P
  signaling is a core component of the adiponectin-mediated pleiotropic actions ().
  Binding of adiponectin to its receptors enhances deacylation of ceramide to sphingosine,
  which can then be phosphorylated to form S1P (). FTY720, a structural analog of
  sphingosine, is phosphorylated in vivo to form FTY720-P (). Inside-out signaling
  of S1P/FTY720-P via S1P receptors activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, which leads to
  up-regulation of PDX-1 and cyclin D3 and down-regulation of p57KIP2, and subsequently
  β-cell regeneration in vivo. FTY720 also promotes cell survival through activation
  of PI3K/Akt () and expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. In addition, S1P receptor signaling
  plays a key role in adiponectin-mediated AMP-activated protein kinase activation,
  which is important for mitochondrial biogenesis and β-cell survival (). Thus, FTY720
  acts on an intrinsic pathway that is physiologically important for β-cell regeneration
  and survival under metabolic stress. Sph, sphingosine; S1PRs, S1P receptors; AdipoR,
  adiponectin receptors.
