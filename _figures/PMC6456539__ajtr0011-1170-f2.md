caption: Activation of autophagy process by extracellular vesicles. This figure summarizes
  the activation of autophagy process by extracellular vesicles. After the extracellular
  vesicles carrying a variety of biologically active substances enter the cells, the
  autophagy is initiated mainly by two ways. One of them is that extracellular vesicles
  directly release active substances that activate autophagy, such as MiR-7, 14-3-3,
  Beclin-1, ATG7, etc. Another more important way is that extracellular vesicles activate
  multiple autophagy signaling pathways. A large number of autophagosomes form after
  autophagy is activated by extracellular vesicles. These autophagosomes then encapsulate
  harmful substances such as extracellular vesicles, multivesicular bodies, and damaged
  mitochondria, which are ultimately delivered to lysosomes for dissolution to maintain
  cell homeostasis.
