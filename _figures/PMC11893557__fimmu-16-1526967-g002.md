caption: The impact of autogenous and post-intervention gut microbiota on immune cells
  in HCC. (A) The use of 2,5-dimethyl celecoxib activates three beneficial bacteria.
  These bacteria, in turn, activate the AMPK signaling pathway and inhibit the mTOR
  signaling pathway in NK, CD4+ T, and CD8+ T cells within HCC. (B) Acetate derived
  from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron induces the polarization of M1 macrophages in
  HCC, enhancing the secretion of IFN-γ and GZMB by CD8+ T cells. (C) D-lactic acid,
  produced by the fermentation of Lactobacillus delbrueckii, converts M2 macrophages
  into M1 macrophages in HCC. (D) The use of antibiotics causes the imbalance of intestinal
  flora, which induces the proliferation of colon epithelial cluster cells to secrete
  a large amount of IL-25 and further promotes the vicarious activation of macrophages
  and the secretion of CXCL10, ultimately leading to the progression of HCC. (E) Antibiotic-induced
  dysbiosis promotes the secretion of the chemokine CXCL16 by liver sinusoidal endothelial
  cells via bile acids as messengers. CXCL16 acts on CXCR6+ liver NKT cells to produce
  IFN-γ. (F) The use of the probiotic mixture Pro-hep reduces Th17 cell polarization
  in HCC, subsequently downregulating IL-17 production. (G) Feces from WT mice or
  mice treated with antibiotics and then supplemented with Lactobacillus reuteri were
  transplanted into HCC mice, and a decrease in ILC3 cells in TME was found. (H) Mice
  with XYXD diet showed an increase in Bacteroides and Lactobacillus, a decrease in
  Eubacterium, and an increase in BSH (bile salt hydrolase) production. BSH converts
  conjugated bile acids into primary bile acids, while Eubacteria inhibits the conversion
  of primary bile acids to secondary bile acids. The accumulated primary bile acids
  ultimately trigger CXCR6’s recruitment of NKT cells in the liver and secretion of
  IFN-γ to combat HCC tumor cells
