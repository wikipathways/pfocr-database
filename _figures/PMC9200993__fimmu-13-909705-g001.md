caption: Immune signaling pathways involved in the regulation of Treg cell metabolism
  and adaptation to non-lymphoid tissues. Microenvironmental antigens, co-stimulators,
  TLRs, and cytokines orchestrate key immune signaling pathways to reprogram cellular
  metabolism of Tregs in adaptation to non-lymphoid tissues. The PI3K signaling pathway
  senses the immune signals derived from TCR, co-stimulatory receptors, co-inhibitory
  receptors, and TLRs, which in turn activates mTOR complexes to orchestrate reprogramming
  of cellular metabolism via various transcription factors. TCR and co-stimulation
  activates LKB1 signaling pathway that restricts STAT4 function and promotes stabilization
  of β-catenin and metabolic reprogramming of Tregs in maintaining immune homeostasis
  of multiple non-lymphoid tissues. In response to TCR and co-stimulatory signals
  in the tissue microenvironment, Tregs coordinate a variety of transcription factors
  that upregulate expression of the genes involved in diverse metabolic programs,
  including lipid biosynthesis, mitochondrial metabolism, glycolysis, FAO, and AA
  metabolism. Cytokines existed in various tissues sustain homeostasis and accumulation
  of tissue Tregs through different transcription factors. VAT-Treg cell accumulation
  is dependent upon TCR, FOXP3, and IL-33 signaling through activation of GATA3, IRF4,
  and BATF. IL-7 is required to maintain homeostasis and function of skin-Tregs. TCR,
  T cell receptor; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; AA, amino acids; VAT, visceral adipose
  tissue.
