caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism by which cholesterol promotes
  breast cancer cell growth and migration via the ERRα-PGC-1α pathway and how statins
  (cholesterol lowering drug) may inhibit this effect. The proposed scheme depicts
  that cholesterol binds to ERRα and changes its conformation, which causes an increase
  in recruitment of PGC-1α and as a result induces transcription of the metabolic
  target genes of ERRα and increases breast cancer cell growth and migration. However,
  statins, drugs tthat inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, possibly lower cholesterol levels
  and as a result decrease breast cancer cell progression.
