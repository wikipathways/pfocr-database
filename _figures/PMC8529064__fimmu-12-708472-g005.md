caption: Mechanisms of the microbial components regulating immunity. This figure shows
  the role of the microbial components polysaccharide A (PSA), formyl peptide, and
  HBP (d-glycero-β-d-mannoheptose-1,7-bisphosphate) in the host immunity. PSA can
  enter the circulatory system directly through the host’s intestinal epithelial cells
  (IECs). In the circulatory system, PSA connects dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells
  through MHC class II and T-cell receptors (TCR) to inhibit inflammation. In the
  host’s genitourinary tract, HBP promotes the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines
  by the host’s immune cells through the TIFA/TRAF6/NF-κB pathway. Formyl peptide
  binds to neutrophils by binding to formyl peptide receptors 1 (FRR1) to regulate
  the inflammatory response of neutrophils.
