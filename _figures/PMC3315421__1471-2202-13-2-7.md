caption: Schematic illustration of the potential mechanisms of C/EBP action in maintaining
  distal axon integrity following axotomy. C/EBP mRNA is expressed in both the soma
  and axon [,]. In the soma, C/EBP functions as a transcription factor and results
  in the transcription of regenerative-associated genes, such as α-tubulin and GAP-43,
  via a cAMP/PKA/CREB dependent signalling pathway []. Axon injury also activates
  an ERK-dependent pathway that results in the phosphorylation of C/EBP and further
  activation of pro-regenerative genes []. In both proximal and distal axons, C/EBP
  mRNA is stabilized by DLK-1 following axotomy []. Local protein synthesis of C/EBP
  in the distal axon may be required for regeneration or to prevent degeneration of
  distal axons following injury.
