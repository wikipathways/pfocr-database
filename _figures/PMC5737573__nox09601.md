caption: Tumor adaptation. (Left panel) In normal cells, the binding of an extracellular
  growth factor (GF) to its cognate RTK initiates a cascade of activated intermediates
  (eg, Ras, Raf, MEK), which culminates in cell cycle progression and the orderly
  enactment of specific transcriptional programs. The signal is quickly dampened by
  negative feedback loops (eg, Sprouty). Additionally, there are growth factors in
  the local microenvironment that cannot transmit their growth-promoting signals due
  to lack of appropriate growth factor receptor expression. (Right panel) In the context
  of neoplasia, the playing field is markedly different as a result of aberrant expression
  of receptors that can now bind to available growth factors and activate other signaling
  pathways (eg, PI3K, Akt), which interact (either positively or negatively) with
  activated RTK circuits to create inhibitory feedback and positive feed-forward loops.
  The negative feedback loops in cancer cells are sometimes attenuated by reduced
  expression of Sprouty (or other inhibitory proteins). Additionally, mutational activation
  of RTKs or proto-oncogenes (“mut”), as well as loss of tumor suppressor gene (TSG)
  expression (“loss”), can converge on the same pathways or lead to increased activity
  of other growth control pathways. Epigenetic reprogramming at the level of chromatin
  or transcriptional regulation can also lead to deregulated expression of both positive
  and negative regulators of mitogenic signaling pathways, while changes in mitochondrial
  function (endoplasmic reticulum stress responses) and cell metabolism could alter
  the intracellular milieu in which these signaling effectors operate. Lastly, the
  local microenvironment in cancer is different from that found in normal tissues,
  with the elaboration of growth factors from stromal elements (eg, cancer-associated
  immune system cells). These stromal factors influence the activity of signaling
  effectors and change intracellular pathway wiring in unpredictable ways, resulting
  in adaptive responses to molecularly targeted treatments and culminating in tumor
  escape.
