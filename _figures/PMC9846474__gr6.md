caption: Epstein-Barr virus antigens deregulate the cell cycle. Epstein-Barr virus
  (EBV) associated nuclear antigens (EBNA) – 1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, 5 (LP), LMPs, and Rta
  modulate the cell cycle at various stages. In brief, at the early G1 stage of the
  cell cycle, E3C and LMP-1 hinder the activity of p27 and p16, respectively, to block
  their inhibitory effect on the Cyclin D/CDK-4/6 complex. E3C also inhibits the cytoplasmic
  translocation of GSK-3b to prevent Cyclin D phosphorylation. In addition, E3C modulates
  the E2F-mediated transcription by interacting with pRb and AURKB; E3C also mediates
  the nuclear translocation of mitochondrial protein MRPS18-2 to facilitate its binding
  with pRb and thereby regulating the level of free E2F. During the late G1 phase,
  the formation of the Cyclin E/CDK-2 complex is affected by the binding of LMP-1
  and E3C. Further, the p21WAF1/CIP1 mediated inhibition of the Cyclin E/CDK-2 complex
  is obstructed by the binding of E3A and Rta antigens of EBV. Interaction of E3C
  with other host molecules such as p53 or Chk1/2 also affects cell cycle progression
  from G1 to the S phase. Along with E3, other EBV antigens such as E5 and E1 also
  modulate the Mdm-2-mediated apoptosis pathway in the late G1 phase of the cell cycle.
  E5 is reported to directly interact with Mdm-2, while E1 binds with HAUSP to promote
  ubiquitination of the Mdm-2 molecule, leading to its degradation and thereby modulating
  the host cell cycle. Progressing to the S phase of the cell cycle, EBV antigen E3B
  is reported to directly bind Cyclin A, while E3C and E3A curb the inhibitory effect
  of p27 and p21WAF1/CIP1 respectively towards Cyclin A/CDK-1/2 complex. Rta binding
  to 14-3-3σ enhances its expression and thereby sequesters the activity of the Cyclin
  A/CDK-1/2 complex. During the G2 phase of the cell cycle, E3A binding to p21WAF1/CIP1
  obstructs its blocking activity towards the Cyclin /-CDK-1 complex. Furthermore,
  the binding of E3C to the p53-gemin complex leads to IRF-5-mediated upregulation
  of LMP-1 expression that causes p53-mediated apoptosis to stop.
