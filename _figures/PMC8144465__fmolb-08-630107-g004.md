caption: Suggested mode of action of CBD, focusing on some of its known targets, and
  some inferred from other phenolic compounds. CBD may stimulate calcium uptake into
  the cell, possibly by channels like TRPV1 and then into the mitochondria, which
  may involve VDAC1. It could then eventually inhibit the electron transport chain
  (ETC) and potentially induce the release of hexokinase (HK, which binds to VDAC1;
  VDAC1 is also key in controlling apoptosis via the BCL/BAX system), and either directly,
  or indirectly (e.g., by ROS), inhibits other key enzymes in glycolysis, such as
  G6PDH or GAPDH. This could first stimulate and then inhibit mitochondrial function,
  providing a powerful adaptive signal; initially, the mitochondrion can swell while
  it buffers calcium. However, too much calcium influx will eventually lead to overload,
  loss of membrane potential, and inhibition of ATP production. If the amount of calcium
  influx is transient, or not too large, the mitochondrion has a number of adaptive
  strategies, such as mitochondrial permeability transition pore flickering (MPTP)
  to release excessive calcium and upregulation of antioxidant pathways, which could
  include the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). However, if its membrane potential
  starts to fall, it could start to fission and stimulate mitophagy/autophagy and
  initially leads to mitochondrial biogenesis and eventually leads to induction of
  cell death; rapid fragmentation does seem to predispose to cell death. The key effect
  will be to switch off anabolic growth pathways and enhance stress resistance and
  catabolism, which could be indicated by a shift in bound NAD(P)H. The outcome is
  thus likely to be concentration and cell type dependent, as well as dependent on
  the initial metabolic state of the cell. A key tipping point in relation to cancer
  is that the sudden influx of calcium will potentially increase TCA activity and
  potentially flow through the ETC, which will increase ROS and shift carbohydrate
  flux away from growth to stress resistance, for instance, by inhibiting GAPDH. However,
  cancer cells are generally a lot more reliant on antioxidant defense systems, as
  generation of ROS is a key driver of proliferation, so suddenly enhancing mitochondrial
  ROS is a recognized anticancer strategy as it can tip cancer cells, but not normal
  cells, toward cell death.
