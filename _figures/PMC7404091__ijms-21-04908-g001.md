caption: This figure summarizes the regulatory core of ferroptosis, approximately
  divided into three axes. The first axis is represented in the middle. It includes
  the GSH/GPX4, sulfur transfer and p53 pathways. The second axis (right part of theF)
  consists of the iron metabolism pathway, including IREB2 related to ferritin metabolism,
  the regulation of ATG5-ATG7-NCOA4 pathway and the p62-Keap1-Nrf2 regulatory pathway.
  These elements can influence the concentration of intracellular iron, mandatory
  for the development of ferroptosis. On the left, the third axis implies that lipid
  metabolism p53-spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1)-ALOX15, ACSL4,
  LPCAT3, etc. impact on fatty acids regulation and ferroptosis []. Finally, mitochondria
  are also involved, since VDACs (voltage-dependent anion channels) are inhibited
  by erastin. In parallel, the independent pathway ferroptosis suppressor protein
  1-coenzyme Q10 (FSP-1-CoQ10) acts with GSH/GPX4 to contrast lipid peroxidation [].
