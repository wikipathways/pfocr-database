caption: Up-regulation of TGFβ signaling in Timp3−/−-AB hearts. Gene set enrichment
  analysis indicated TGFβ signaling pathway to be significantly up-regulated at 6
  h after aortic banding. This was visualized by GenMAPP. Genes labeled in red were
  up-regulated, whereas those labeled in green were down-regulated in Timp3−/− hearts.
