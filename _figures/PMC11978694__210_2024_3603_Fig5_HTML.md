caption: 'Role of miRNA in treatment of gout arthritis. hsa-miR-155 acts as a proinflammatory
  regulator via SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase 1 (SHIP-1) down-regulation
  and provokes the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β.
  hsa-miR-155 promotes inflammation by targeting anti-inflammatory molecules such
  as SOCS1, a negative regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokines. hsa-miR-34a modulation
  may have an impact on urate levels and could potentially be explored as a therapeutic
  approach. hsa-miR-449a influences the expression of HDAC1, which mediates the generation
  of cytokine production in MSU crystals. hsa-miR-192-5p targets NFAT5which is associated
  with the activation of macrophages and TLR-promoted arthritis. hsa-miR-23a-5p enhances
  inflammation in gout by stimulating MyD88/NF-κB. hsa-miR-142-3p promotes the inflammatory
  response by binding with ZEB2 to activate the NF-κB signaling. hsa-miR-146a acts
  on the TLR4/MyD88/NF-KB signaling pathway. hsa-miR-3146 triggers the formation of
  neutrophil extracellular traps. hsa-miR-92a influences KLF2/ VEGFA. hsa-miR-663
  interacts with TGF-β1 to target and control the expression of PTEN. hsa-miR-302b
  exerts a negative regulatory effect on the production of IL-1β. hsa-miR-488 and
  hsa-miR-920 have the capability to directly bind to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR)
  of IL-1β and particularly alter its function. hsa-miR-223-3p and hsa-miR-22-3p decrease
  the synthesis of IL-1β by specifically targeting NLRP3. hsa-miR-221-5p has been
  detected to greatly suppress the expression of TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-1β. EREG: epiregulin;
  IL-1β: interleukin-1 beta; IL-6: interleukin-6; KLF2: Krüppel-like factor 2; MyD88:
