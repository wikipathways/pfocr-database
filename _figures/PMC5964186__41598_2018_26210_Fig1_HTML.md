caption: Schematic diagram of the research hypothesis. Hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinemia
  are main clinical endocrine features of PCOS. Exercise can adjust the androgen level,
  as well as increase the sensitivity of insulin by activating PI3K-Akt insulin signaling
  pathways. 5αR1 has certain effects on insulin resistance and can synthesize dihydrotestosterone
  by metabolizing testosterone. 5αR1 may be the target of androgen and insulin for
  exercise-induced regulation.
