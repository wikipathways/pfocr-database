caption: Possible signal pathway by which forskolin regulates arginine methylation.
  Forskolin prevents doxorubicin-induced methyltransferase activity which mitigates
  biosynthesis of ADMA and SAH, the intermediate products of protein methylation.
  ADMA is an endogenous inhibitor of eNOS which catalyses the formation of nitric
  oxide. Hence, an increase in intracellular or circulating ADMA concentration leads
  to eNOS uncoupling and endothelial dysfunction. Such an inhibitory effect of FSK
  has the potential to prevent eNOS uncoupling under DOX insult. (+) – potentiation;
