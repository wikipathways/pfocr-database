caption: System for signal integration in the intracellular and intercellular Notch1
  signaling pathway. Notch1, the transmembrane receptor of one cell, binds to Dll1
  or Jag1, the transmembrane ligands belonging to the neighboring cell. This trans-interaction
  leads to the cleavage and release of NICD that regulates the production of the two
  ligands asymmetrically, i.e., it inhibits Dll1 but activates Jag1. Interaction between
  Notch1 receptor and ligands (Dll1 or Jag1) of the same cell (cis-interaction) leads
  to the degradation of both the receptor and the ligands. Glycosylation of Notch1
  by Fringe modifies Notch1 to have a higher affinity for binding to Dll1 and a lower
  affinity for binding to Jag1
