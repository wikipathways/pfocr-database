caption: 'Metabolic engineering strategies for the production hyaluronic acid from
  the simultaneous consumption of glucose and galactose in E. coli. “X” indicates
  gene knockout. Thick black arrow indicates Leloir pathway, which was activated by
  knockout of the galR and galS genes in order to enhance the galactose consumption
  in the co-fermentation with glucose. Thick green arrow indicates the UDP-glucuronic
  acid biosynthesis pathway, which was reinforced by overexpression of the galU and
  udg genes under control of the trc promoter. Thick blue arrow indicates the UDP-N-acetyl
  glucosamine biosynthesis pathway, which was reinforced by overexpression of the
  glmU, glmS, and glmM genes under control of the trc promoter. Thick orange arrow
  indicates the heterologous expression of the hasA gene from S. zooepidemicus. Dashed
  line indicates unannotated pathway in glycogen metabolism (Long et al., ). Gene
  and its coding enzyme: galR, DNA-binding transcriptional repressor; galS, DNA-binding
  transcriptional isorepressor; galK, galactokinase; galT, galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase;
  galE, UDP-galactose-4-epimerase; pgm, phosphoglucomutase; pgi, glucosephosphate
  isomerase; zwf, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; galU, glucose-1-phosphate uridylytransferase;
  ugd, UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase; glmS, L-glutamine:D-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase;
  glmM, phosphoglucosamine mutase; glmU, glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase;
  pfkA, 6-phosphofructokinase I; pfkB, 6-phosphofructokinase II; and hasA, hyaluronic
  acid synthase from S. zooepidemicus ATCC 35246.'
