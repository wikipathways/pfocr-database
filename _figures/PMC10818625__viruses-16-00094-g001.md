caption: 'The mechanism by which pathogenic infection causes cell necroptosis. Pathogens
  trigger the necroptosis signaling pathway by activating multiple death receptors
  on the cell surface. The binding of TNF-α to TNFR triggers three different signaling
  responses: NF-κB activation, apoptosis or necroptosis. Respiratory syncytial virus
  (RSV), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) can induce
  cells to secrete TNF-α, thereby inducing the formation of RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL necrosomes
  in cells and triggering necroptosis. MTB also prevents NF-κB activation by inhibiting
  RIPK1 ubiquitination. Death ligands, including FasL and TRAIL, trigger necroptosis
  by inducing necrosome formation by binding to the corresponding death receptors.
  SARS-CoV-2 activates IFNR by secreting IFN-γ and triggers necrosome formation through
  JAK-STAT1 to induce cell necroptosis. Streptococcus pneumoniae releases the pore-forming
  toxin pneumolysin (Ply) to induce cell damage and ion dysregulation, thereby triggering
  the formation of necrosomes in a death receptor-independent manner. Lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) activate necroptosis through TRIF-mediated
  necrosome complex formation. SSL10 secreted by Staphylococcus aureus (SA) binds
  to TNFR and induces cell necroptosis by activating the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL and RIPK3-CaMKII
  mitochondrial permeability transition pore pathways. The Z-RNA produced by intracellular
  replication of Influenza Avirus (IAV) binds to ZBP1, leading to RIPK1-independent
  necroptosis through the ZBP1-RIPK3 complex'
