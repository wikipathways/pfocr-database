caption: All global processes are listed and some links allow browsing down in the
  controlled vocabulary hierarchy. B) Inhibition of host RLR pathway by virus ViralZone.
  An illustration describes the RLR antiviral signaling pathway. Known viral proteins
  inhibiting this pathway are indicated in red circles. A side menu allows reaching
  description pages for each part of the pathway. (C) “Inhibition of host RIG-I by
  virus” page describes the host process targeted by viruses, and displays viral proteins
  inhibiting this activity coded by Lyssavirus, Arenavirus, Influenzavirus A and Pneumovirus.
  The text describes this host-virus interaction at a molecular level, and a table
  displays known viruses and their method used to evade RIG-I antiviral defense. To
  the left, links to the corresponding UniProtKB keyword and GO term allow users to
  visit these resources and access to all annotated proteins related to the corresponding
  ontology term (). The field “virus” contains the list of viruses attacking this
  process, a publication source, and a link to ViralZone virus fact sheet for each
  virus. Most pages give direct access to reviewed UniProtKB entries annotated with
  corresponding keyword within “protein by strain” and “protein by name” tabs. An
  illustration describes the RLR antiviral signaling pathway, and identified viral
  proteins interfering with RIG-I are indicated in red circles.
