caption: The Imd pathway and its negative regulators in the gut. The Imd pathway is
  activated by the recognition of diaminopimelic acid-type peptidoglycan (DAP-PGN)
  by the membrane receptor PGRP-LC, or tracheal cytotoxin (TCT) by the intracellular
  receptor PGRP-LE. Activated PGRP-LC or PGRP-LE then recruits the adaptor protein
  Imd, which triggers the signaling cascade of the pathway and induces the nuclear
  translocation of Relish, a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factor of Drosophila.
  The NF-κB protein Relish activates the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)
  and negative regulators of this pathway. PGRP-LB and PGRP-SC catalyze the degradation
  of peptidoglycan and TCT, resulting in a decrease in the amount of ligands for the
  recognition receptors PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE. PGRP-LF and Pirk inhibit the activity
  of those receptors, transglutaminase (TG) blocks the nuclear translocation of Relish,
  and Caudal modulates the transcriptional response of Relish.
