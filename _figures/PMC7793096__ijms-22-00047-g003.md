caption: 'Carbon monoxide-induced phenotypic switch of macrophages. Carbon monoxide
  (CO), released during heme catabolism or CO-releasing molecules (CORMs), modulates
  macrophage matobolism and phenotype. Pro-resolving (M2) macrophages are dependnet
  on oxidative phosphorylation, while pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages rely on glycolysis
  (Warburg effect) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-dependent glyolytic gene expressions,
  supporting inflammatory cytokine expressions. Mox macrophages, which are formed
  in atherosclerotic plaques by oxidized LDL, are characterized by the transient repression
  of glycolysis and inflammatory cytokine expression; however, these cells metabolize
  glucose via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), supporting their increased gluathion
  synthesis and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-related antioxidant
  gene expression. Intrestingly, CO inhibits the phenotypic switch towards the pro-inflammatory
  phenotype triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and facilitates pro-resolving macrophage
  formation by inducing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ).
  Recently, the heme oxygenase/CO pathway has been suggested to activate PPP, which
  might be implicated in heme detoxication by macrophages. IL-1β: interleukin-1β;
  GSH: glutathione; IL-10: interleukin-10; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-α; PPARγ:
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; ?: currently
  unrevealed mediators; ↑: increase.'
