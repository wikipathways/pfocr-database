caption: Simplified schematic representation of phenylapropanoid/flavonoid biosynthesis
  pathway leading to the accumulation of anthocyanins in Fragaria × ananassa. Enzymes
  involved in each of the intermediate steps are shown by blue text in the left side
  of the arrow and the genes whose expressions were studied were shown by red text
  in the right side of the arrow. Key flavonoid end products are shown in boxes. Dotted
  arrows indicate the points where the pathway diverts from biosynthesis of anthocyanin
  to proanthocyanidin. Details of the genes involved in each of the steps are shown
  in  and .
