caption: 'mTOR operates within two functionally and structurally distinct complexes:
  mTORC1 and mTORC2. The two mTOR complexes share the components mLST8 and DEPTOR,
  while RAPTOR and PRAS40 are present exclusively in mTORC1. RICTOR, mSIN1, and Protor-1/2
  are found exclusively within mTORC2. Growth factors or hormones (for example, insulin
  through IR) activate the PI3K/PDK1/AKT or ERK signaling pathways, which inactivate
  the TSC2 subunit of the TSC complex. Inactivation of the TSC complex upregulates
  the activity of RHEB, which in turn stimulates mTORC1. The activity of mTORC1 is
  also positively regulated by amino acid–mediated stimulation of the RAG complex
  of GTPases: Rag A/B and Rag C/D. GATOR1 inhibits RAG GTPases. SAM inhibits the activation
  of GATOR1 by SAMTOR. GATOR1 is also repressed by GATOR2, which in turn is regulated
  by Sestrin2 and CASTOR in response to leucine and arginine, respectively. The FLCN
  FNIP1/2 complex is also thought to stimulate the RAG activity. mTORC1 is suppressed
  under conditions where energy or glucose is limiting through AMPK signaling, which
  activates TSC2 and inhibits the mTORC1 subunit RAPTOR, and by hypoxia via the HIF-1α/REDD1
  axis. mTORC1 orchestrates several anabolic processes via transcriptional or translational
  regulation or both. mTORC1 controls protein synthesis in part through its two main
  effectors: S6K and 4E-BP1. mTORC1 also stimulates mitochondrial function, through
  4E-BP1 and PGC-1α/YY1, and mitochondrial dynamics (via MTFP1). The control of mTORC1-mediated
  nucleotide synthesis is governed by S6K, ATF4, and PRPS2 (which is translationally
  regulated via 4E-BP/eIF4E), while lipid biosynthesis and adipogenesis are regulated
  by S6K and Lipin1. mTORC1 controls autophagy by inhibiting the activity of ULK1
  and TFEB; the latter also mediates mTORC1-dependent lysosome biogenesis. Conversely,
  the activity of mTORC2 may be regulated by growth factors through PI3K activation
  and generation of PIP3. PIP3 has been suggested to bind to mSin1, thereby activating
  mTORC2. mTORC2 activation promotes AKT signaling involved in glycolysis, lipid biosynthesis,
  and cell migration, while SGK signaling is involved in ion transport. Both AKT and
  SGK negatively regulate FOXO1/3A, which is a regulator of key metabolic pathways
  and apoptosis. mTORC2 also controls cytoskeleton and cell migration through PKCα.
