caption: Proposed mechanism of the inter-relationship between hepcidinand HJVexpression
  during the inflammatory response, and the effect on iron flux. LPS is taken up by
  Kupffer cells via TLR-4 and induces TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6. TNF-α suppresses HJV
  expression via a TNFRE within the HJV promoter, while IL-6 induces hepcidin expression
  via the STAT3 pathway. LPS also represses the expression of BMPs (2, 4, and 6),
  via an as yet unknown mechanism. Thus, iron sensing by the BMPs, HJV and BMP receptor
  involved in regulating hepcidin is abrogated whereas inflammatory signalling by
  IL-6 through hepcidin remains intact.
