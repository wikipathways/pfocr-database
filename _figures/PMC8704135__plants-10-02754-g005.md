caption: A proposed model of miRNAs involved in Al, Cd and salt responses in barley
  roots. Downregulation of miR390-5p, miR166a and miR166a-3p promotes the process
  of cell wall formation and modification, thus alleviating Al detoxification. Upregulation
  of miR393-5p and miR159-5p can repress later root emergence through controlling
  the module of the auxin signaling pathway combined with MPK under Cd conditions.
  To alleviate root inhibition, miR160a-5p and miR172b-5p are significantly downregulated,
  thus increasing the expression of ARFs. Two miR156 family members, miR156a-3p and
  miR156d-3p, are downregulated, probably leading to reduced ROS scavenging and enhanced
  gibberellin synthesis after salt treatment. Contrary to Al and Cd treatments, repressed
  miR396e-5p under salt conditions promotes root growth through the accumulation of
  GRFs.
