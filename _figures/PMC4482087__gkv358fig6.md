caption: The rewired transcription network regulating metabolic pathways for tolerant
  industrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae NRRL Y-50049. The network is formed by
  joining rewired upstream transcription subnetworks to downstream metabolic pathways
  in the tolerant strain Y-50049 versus the control during the lag phase of cell growth.
  Oval nodes represent over—(red) or under—(green) expressed transcription factors
  in Y-50049; the darkness is proportional to the level of over- or under-expression.
  Boxes represent metabolic pathways. An edge from a transcription factor to a metabolic
  pathway box denotes a significant interaction from the transcription factor to an
  enzyme-encoding gene on the pathway. Brown/Blue edges are statistically significantly
  rewired/conserved interactions across the two strains. All subnetworks before joining
  have adjusted heterogeneity P-value PD ≤ 0.05.

  description: The rewired transcription network regulating metabolic pathways for
    tolerant industrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae NRRL Y-50049. The network is
    formed by joining rewired upstream transcription subnetworks to downstream metabolic
    pathways in the tolerant strain Y-50049 versus the control during the lag phase

    factors in Y-50049; the darkness is proportional to the level of over- or under-expression.
