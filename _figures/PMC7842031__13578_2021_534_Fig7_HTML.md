caption: Proposed model of ACTA1 inhibition by PAX3-FOXO1 in ARMS cells. ACTA1 is
  inhibited by PAX3-FOXO1 through RhoA-MKL1-SRF signaling pathway. In this pathway,
  Cyto D and CCG-1423 can regulate ACTA1 expression by controlling nuclear accumulation
  of MKL1 in distinct ways. PAX3-FOXO1 can cooperate with these molecules in ACTA1
  regulation. SRF activates ACTA1 expression by binding to the promoter region of
  ACTA1 gene. Overexpressed ACTA1 protein can inhibit ARMS cell proliferation, migration
  and tumor growth. Therefore, decreased ACTA1 expression by PAX3-FOXO1 may help to
  promote cell proliferation, migration and finally tumor growth.
