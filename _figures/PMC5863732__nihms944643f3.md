caption: The urea cycle allows cellular disposal of nitrogen from mitochondrially
  catabolized glutamate via mitochondrial conversion to carbamoyl phosphate, citrulline
  shuttling to the cytosol, and loss of urea from arginine. Each enzyme in the pathway
  is depicted with the number of known sirtuin-regulated sites of each acyl-lysine
  type shown. SIRT5 desuccinylates and deglutarylates CPS1 to allow efficient clearance
  of mitochondrial ammonia; and SIRT3 deacetylates Ornithine Carbamoyltransfrase (OTC)
  to maintain its function. Furthermore, SIRT5 expression in the cytosol maintains
  the conversion of citrulline to argininosuccinate by demalonylating ASSY.
