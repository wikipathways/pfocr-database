caption: The programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway
  is utilized by tumours as immunosurveillance evasion strategy and is a target of
  immune checkpoint inhibitors. The PD‐1/PD‐L1 pathway supresses T cells in peripheral
  tissues and is involved at a later stage in the immune response than cytotoxic T
  lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA‐4). For initial T cell activation, two signals are required.
  Signal 1 is delivered in the form of T cell receptor–major histocompatibility complex
  (TCR–MHC) binding, while signal 2 is achieved through the engagement of co‐stimulatory
  molecules by CD28. After a T cell has been activated, the engagement of PD‐1 on
  the T cell with PD‐L1 on a tumour cell leads to T cell suppression, allowing tumours
  to avoid elimination by T cells. This pathway has become a target of novel anti‐cancer
  therapies known as checkpoint inhibitors. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab and cemiplimab
  are the three current PD‐1‐targeting monoclonal antibodies, while atezolizumab and
  avelumab are the two current PD‐L1‐targeting antibodies.
