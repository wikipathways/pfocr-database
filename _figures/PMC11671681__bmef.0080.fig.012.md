caption: Multimodal SDT for HCC treatment. (A) HMME sensitizer is combined with doxorubicin
  for SDT-chemotherapy. Redrawn from [86] using Biorender. (B) Combination of Cas9/single-guide
  RNA (sgRNA) with HMME shows a promising antitumor effect due to the knockdown of
  the NFE2L2 transcription factor, which plays an important role in the reduction
  of oxidative stress and prevents cell damage. This image is reproduced with permission

  of IR820 sensitizer dye within the NB in combination with PI-103 shows a synergistic
  effect due to its inhibitory nature in the PI3K/ mTOR signaling pathway. This image

  (D) si-NUDT1 is used with polythiophene, which shows a substantial antitumor effect
  due to the silencing of the NUDT1 gene and the singlet oxygen as well as ROS generation
  during ultrasound application. This image is reproduced (adapted) with permission
