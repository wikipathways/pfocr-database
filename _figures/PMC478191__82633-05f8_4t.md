caption: Model for the protein complex at the head of the FG pathway. Msb2 (in red)
  is composed of a large extracellular domain, which contains the mucin repeats (bright
  red oval) and is glycosylated (as shown), and integral-membrane and cytoplasmic
  domains. General factors Sho1, Cdc42 (isoprenylated and attached to the plasma membrane;
  PM), and Ste20 all shown in blue are recruited to the FG pathway by Msb2. The interaction
  between Cdc42 and the cytoplasmic domain of Msb2 is indicated, as is the interaction
  between Msb2 and Sho1, which is stimulated by FG-pathway activation. An interaction
  between the cytoplasmic domains of the Msb2 and Sho1 proteins was not detected;
  thus, they may interact in their membrane-spanning or extracellular domains.
