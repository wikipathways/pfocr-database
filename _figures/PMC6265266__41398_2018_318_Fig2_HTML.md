caption: a Extrusion of Ca+2 from the cytosol is accomplished by Ca+2 uptake into
  the ER via SERCA and Ca+2 accumulation in mitochondria. A significant Ca+2 influx
  and downstream activation of Ca+2-dependent intracellular pathways, among which
  the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase or the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway,
  are directly involved in microglial functions such as synthesis and release of BDNF
  and chemotactic responses. b Activation of PI3K and PLC accompanied by a rise in
  intracellular Ca+2, subsequently triggers phosphorylation and hence activation of
  Akt. This results in the enhanced expression and activation of integrins, promoting
  adhesion of microglial processes to the extracellular matrix, causing reorganization
  of the actin cytoskeleton and leading to chemotaxis. c BDNF rapidly downregulates
  KCC2 through TrkB, causing a deficiency in synaptic inhibition
