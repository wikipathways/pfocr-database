  Dashed arrows indicate putative mechanisms which remain to be fully characterised.
  A: Elevated tumour Na+ and migration/invasion. VGSCs have been correlated with activation
  of a proinvasive gene transcription network upregulating Wnt, MAPK and Ca2+signalling
  (, ). NHE1 localises to the leading edge of invading cells (); VGSC colocalisation
  with NHE1 within cavaeolae leads to activation of NHE1, acidification of the extracellular
  environment and digestion of the extracellular matrix by cathepsins and matrix metalloproteinases
  (, , ). Interestingly, the β subunit of VGSCs acts as an adhesion molecule that
  interacts with the extracellular matrix to regulate migration and invasion (). Extracellular
  acidification can also activate ASIC and ENaC channels (, ), leading to further
  increases in [Na+]i. Na+-linked Ca2+ influx via reverse-mode NCX action has been
  linked to cancer cell motility via Ca2+signalling-activated TGF-β signalling ().
  NKCC regulates cell swelling required for migratory behaviour by facilitating [Cl-]i
  accumulation and H2O uptake via osmosis and aquaporins (). NKCC also acts as a scaffold
  for cofilin within invadopodia, which facilitates cytoskeletal remodelling (). B:
  Elevated [Na+]e and cancer cell proliferation. The inward Na+ gradient drives the
  uptake of anabolic substrates such as glucose and glutamine (SGLT and SLC1A5), respectively
  (–); altered tumour [Na+] might regulate the uptake of these substrates. Via glycolysis/pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) and glutaminolysis, glucose and glutamine are utilised as
  substrates for redox homeostasis, biosynthesis, and cell proliferation (i.e. reducing
  equivalents, nucleotides, and fatty acids) (). SLC1A5 also regulates mTORC1, a key
  regulator of protein translation and cell growth (). Moreover, salt inducible kinase
  3 is activated by elevated [Na+]e, promoting G1/S phase transition (), and [Cl-]
  accumulation due to upregulated NKCC activity can promote cell cycle progression
  (, , ). Elevated [Na+]e leads to DNA breaks with significant implications for oncogenic
  mutations/tumour suppressor silencing (), and a high osmolality and VGSC activity
  also activates the MAPK signalling cascade, potentially via Rac1 activation (, ).
  C: Elevated Na+ and osmolality drives inflammation in the tumour microenvironment.
  Increased [Na+]e and osmolality promote proliferative and antiapoptotic signalling
  in tumour associated macrophages () and by increasing the production of proinflammatory
  cytokines by local endothelial cells and Th-17 helper cells (). Together these factors
  also promote the further recruitment of proinflammatory immune cells (). These factors
  lead to extracellular matrix breakdown, neovascularisation and tumour remodelling,
  thereby promoting tumour progression and metastasis (, , , ).'
