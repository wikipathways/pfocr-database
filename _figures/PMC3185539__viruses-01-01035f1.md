caption: Summary of NSP1 inhibition of the innate immune response pathway. Activation
  of dsRNA sensors in the cytoplasm (such as RIG-I) or bound to membranes (such as
  TLR3) stimulates pathways that result in the phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7 by
  IKK-ɛ and TBK1. Phosphorylation allows for the formation of IRF3 homodimers, IRF7
  homodimers, or IRF3/IRF7 heterodimers. RIG-I activation also results in the ubiquitination
  (Ub) of IκB by the E3 ligase Skp1/Cul1/F-box complex SCFβ-TrCP and subsequent degradation
  by the proteasome. Degradation of IκB frees the NF-κB complex (p50 and p65), which
  moves to the nucleus. The binding of NF-κB and IRF dimers to the IFN-β promoter
  results in transcription and secretion of IFN-β, which binds to type I IFN receptors
  (IFNAR). IFNAR signals the ISGF3 complex, consisting of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9,
  to produce additional IRF7 and type I IFNs, thus amplifying the IFN response. The
  NSP1 protein from different RVs has a range of activities. Some RV NSP1 proteins
  inhibit the type I IFN response by degrading IRF3 and IRF7, while at least one NSP1
  prevents type I IFN induction by degrading β-TrCP and preventing the nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB.
