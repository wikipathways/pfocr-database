caption: Schematic representation of a hypothetical pathway in neurodegeneration involving
  stress signaling to and from the Golgi. (A) Under homeostatic conditions, CDK5 is
  mainly kept in the nucleus in a manner dependent on p27. (B) Upon induction of stress,
  CDK5 accumulates in the cytosol, which is an event that promotes neurodegeneration.
  At the same time CDK5 signals to fragment the Golgi and activate LMTK2 at this organelle.
  LMTK2 then in turn signals from the Golgi to inhibit PP1, an event that also promotes
  neurodegeneration. (C) Schematic of the hypothetical connections between stress,
  Golgi alteration, and neurodegeneration, drawn in analogy to the schematic in Figure
  .
