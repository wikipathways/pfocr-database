caption: Schematic of crosstalk regulation of HMGB1, Akt, and Bcl2 expression and
  downstream inflammation mediators during exposure of PMECs to simulated ischemia.
  Acidosis is usually associated with severe, sustained ischemia when metabolic waste
  products including lactic acid accumulate within ischemic tissues. Hypoxia with
  or without acidosis rapidly activates HIF pathways, and miR-126 is induced in parallel
  with accumulated nuclear HIF-1α that increases the HMGB1 expression independently
  of HIF via YAP/HIPPO signaling, an effect that is retained under H/A (dashed line).
  By activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, HMGB1 also indirectly increases the HIF-1α expression
  in a hypoxia-HMGB1-HIF amplifying loop. HIF-1α directly and positively upregulates
  Bcl2, an effect that is countered via negative regulation by miR-126. During H/A,
  HIF-1a and miR-126 both decrease at least in part because acidosis blocks HIF-1α,
  the principal pathway for hypoxia-mediated transcriptional induction of miR-126.
  Reduced miR-126 during H/A relieves negative regulation on HMGB1 while the positive
  regulation by hypoxia is retained resulting in optimal activation of HMGB1 and its
  downstream inflammatory intermediates by H/A. In contrast because Bcl2 is positively
  regulated by HIF-1α and negatively regulated by miR-126, the optimal expression
  occurs under neutral hypoxia when HIF-1α is most active and predominates over miR-126.

  description: Schematic of crosstalk regulation of HMGB1, Akt, and Bcl2 expression
