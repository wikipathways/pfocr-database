caption: The calcium-calmodulin-calcineurn-NFaT-DYRK1A pathway to human beta cell
  proliferation. Increases in intracellular calcium (Ca++), induced, for example,
  by glucose, sulfonylureas and the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) family of drugs,
  activate calmodulin (CAM), which in turn activates the calcineurins (CnA and CnB).
  CnA and CnB form a phosphatase complex, which de-phosphorylates a number of substrates,
  including the NFaT family of transcription factors that, in their phosphorylated
  state, are tethered to 14-3-3 scaffold proteins in the cytoplasm. De-phosphorylation
  by calcineurin allows these transcription factors to translocate into the nuclear
  compartment, where they bind to and activate promoters of cyclins E and A, and cyclin-dependent
  kinase 1 (CDK1), and repress promoters of the cell cycle inhibitor genes, CDKN2A,
  CDKN2B and CDKN1C, encoding p16INK4, p15INK4 and p57Kip2, respectively. Collectively
  these events result in cell cycle entry. The kinase DYRK1A serves as the normal
  termination mechanism in this process by re-phosphorylating NFaT members. This results
  in their return to the cytoplasm, and return to quiescence. Thus, DYRK1A is the
  ‘brake’ on cell cycle entry or proliferation. Harmine, INDY, 5-iodo-tubericidin
  (5-IT) and GNF4877 are all inhibitors of DYRK1A and, in essence, function by disabling
  the DYRK1A ‘brake’, permitting continued proliferation [,,]. VDCC, voltage-dependent
  calcium channel. Figure adapted from []. This figure is available as part of a downloadable
