caption: 'The figure describes the process by which αVβ3 mediates prostate cancer
  cell metastasis. Macroscopically, after cancer cells destroy the ECM and leave their
  primary site, cancer cells depend on αVβ3, which destroys vascular endothelial cells,
  to enter blood vessels. In blood vessels, tumor cells under the protection of BSP
  escape the attack of the immune system and then pass through the blood vessels to
  reach the metastatic site. Here, bone tissue is used as an example. Under the induction
  of VEGF, cancer cells recognize SPARC and HA and interact with them on the surface
  of bone with the help of αVβ3; at the same time, VEGF induces neovascularization
  to supply blood to the cell mass system. At the microscopic level, IL-8, IGF-I,
  CCN2 and other ligands activate different signaling pathways to promote the expression
  of αVβ3 in cancer cells. In addition, CCN2 transmits signals into the cell through
  αVβ3 to increase the acetylation of the transcription factor RUNX2, and RUNX2 promotes
  RANKL expression in tumor cells; these tumor cells then secrete RANKL to induce
  osteoblast differentiation into osteoclasts, and osteoclast-mediated bone tissue
  remodeling can expose HA and SPARC on the bone surface. BKCa and CXCL16 promote
  the aggregation and activation of αVβ3 and trigger the activation of downstream
  FAK. In addition to enhancing the activity of the ERK or PI3K pathway, activated
  FAK triggers cytoskeletal protein remodeling with the help of adaptor proteins,
  further enhancing tumor cell invasion ability. Cell information: The PC-3 cell line
  was initiated from the bone metastasis of a grade IV prostatic adenocarcinoma from
  a 62-year-old Caucasian male; DU145 was initiated from a 69-year-old Caucasian male
  with brain metastasis of prostatic adenocarcinoma; LNCAP was isolated from the left
  supraclavicular lymph node of a 50-year-old prostate cancer patient. LNCAP is sensitive
  to hormones; C4-2B is a subtype derived from the LNCAP cell line.Abbreviations:
  BSP, bone sialoprotein; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HA, hydroxyapatite;
  SPARC, osteonectin; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor;
  IL-8, interleukin8; OPN, osteopontin; MMP (2 or 9), matrix metalloproteinase (2
  or 9); CCN2, connective tissue growth factor; CCL2, chemokines2; CXCL16, chemokines16;
  P, phosphorylated; AC, acetylated.'
