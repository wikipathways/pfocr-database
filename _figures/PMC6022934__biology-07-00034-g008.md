caption: Urea cycle and pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis pathway. In mitochondria,
  N-acetyl-glutamate synthase (NAGS) generates N-acetylglutamate to activate CPS I
  to initiate the urea cycle. The CP generated by CPS I combines with ornithine to
  form citrulline by OTCase. Citrulline is transported out of the mitochondria to
  continue the last three steps by argininosuccinate synthase (AS), argininosuccinate
  lyase (AL), and arginase (ARG) to complete the urea cycle. Pyrimidine biosynthesis
  starts with the formation of CP from glutamine (Gln) by CPS II. CP reacts with aspartate
  to form carbamyl aspartate by ATCase (ATC), followed by cyclization by dihydroorotase
  (DHO) to form dihydroorotate. In humans, a single multifunctional polypeptide, CAD
  (CPS II, ATC and DHO) located in the cytosol, catalyzes the first three steps. Dihydroorotate
  dehydrogenase (DHODH) catalyzes the formation of orotate from dihydroorotate. Uridine
  monophosphate synthase (UMPS), a bifunctional cytosolic enzyme, completes the last
  two steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis to result in UMP formation. CP accumulation
  in the mitochondrial matrix will spill over to the cytosol to enter CAD to cause
  the elevation of orotate and increase pyrimidine biosynthesis. Enzymes are shown
  in cyan. Green arrows indicate activation of CPS1 by N-acetylglutamate (NAG) and
  NAGS by arginine. The dashed arrow indicates spillover of CP from mitochondria into
  cytoplasm in OTC deficiency.
