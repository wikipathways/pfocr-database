caption: Schematic of mechanisms for the inhibition of SMAD2/SMAD3 and the activation
  of TET1 signaling by MSTN mutation. In the wild type model (left), MSTN combined
  with ActRIIB, followed by the combination of the complex with type I receptor, the
  activation of the GS region (Ser/Thr) of the receptor, and the transmission of the
  MSTN signal. The activated MSTN signal then combined and phosphorylated SMAD2/SMAD3,
  whereby pSMAD2/SMAD3 was activated and combined with SMAD4. This complex entered
  the nucleus to combine with the promoter of demethylase TET1, and inhibited the
  activity of TET1 promoter. In the MSTN mutant model (the right), the MSTN mutant
  decreased the binding between pSMAD2/SMAD3 and the promoter of TET1 and enhanced
  TET1 expression, which increased the demethylation of myogenesis-specific genes,
  including PAX3, PAX7, MyoD, and MyoG.
