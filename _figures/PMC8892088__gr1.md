caption: The first and well-characterized pathway governing ferroptosis. Ferroptosis
  is mediated by an iron-dependent accumulation and propagation of lipid peroxidation
  reactions. Iron (Fe3+) bound to transferrin is internalized into cells via receptor-mediated
  endocytosis and subsequently released as redox-reactive iron (Fe2+) required for
  Fenton chemistry. Upstream ferroptosis induction can occur as a result of cysteine
  starvation via inhibition of system xC− using small-molecule inhibitors (Erastin,
  IKE, Glutamate), genetic deletion of SLC7A11, or cystine withdrawal, which result
  in diminished GSH levels, and impaired GPX4 activity. In addition, direct inhibition
  of GPX4 with small-molecule compounds ((1S,3R)-RSL3, ML162) or GPX4 depleting class
  of ferroptosis compounds, can impair antioxidant system and result in the accumulation
  of lipid ROS leading to ferroptosis. Accordingly, ferroptosis is blocked by iron
  chelators, DFO and CPX, as well as radical trapping antioxidants, Ferrostatin-1,
  Liproxstatin-1, and Vitamin E. CPX, ciclopirox; DFO, deferoxamine; GPX4, glutathione
  peroxidase 4; GSH, glutathione; IKE, imidazole ketone erastin; ML162, molecular
  libraries 162; PUFA-PLs, polyunsaturated fatty acid phospholipids; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; RSL3, Ras selective lethal 3.
