caption: Diagram illustrating the androgen-mediated signal transduction via integrins
  and the resulting biological activities. (A) Integrin-induced cell motility and
  adhesion are mediated by AR. Activation of iAR by DHT or R1881 affects different
  subtypes of integrin expression to regulate cell adhesion and motility. RANK/RANKL
  promotes iAR expression through integrin α2β1 and induces integrin α2β1-involved
  cell adhesion via FAK/Akt signaling pathway. In AR-expressing cells, FAK signaling
  modulates integrin α5β1-induced cell adhesion and integrin αv-induced cell motility.
  (B) Integrin-induced cell growth and survival are mediated by AR. Activation of
  iAR by R1881 induces the expression of integrin α6β1, which in turn regulates cell
  survival through HIF-1α-promoted BNIP3 expression. Furthermore, iAR activity is
  up-regulated by integrin αvβ6, leading to increased survivin expression and enhanced
  cell growth. The activation of IGF-IR suppresses the degradation of integrin α5β1
  through endocytosis, allowing this remaining integrin α5β1 to induce cell growth.
