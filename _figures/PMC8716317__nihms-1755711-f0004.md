caption: Structure of the bioactivation model. The diagram on the left demonstrates
  the flow of data through the model. The model consists of 1 molecule layer, 1 input
  layer, 2 hidden layers, and 2 output layers. First, several descriptors are calculated
  from an input molecule’s structure. Each pathway has its own set of bioactivation
  descriptors, and these descriptors are submitted to the hidden layer, which computes
  pathway bioactivation scores (PBSs or pathway score) for the input molecule and
  each of its pathways. Each pathway score ranges from zero to one, reflecting the
  probability of a specific bioactivation mechanism at a specific site within the
  input molecule. For this study, we enumerated four types of metabolic transformations
  that precede bioactivation, including all possible quinone formations, epoxidations,
  nitroaromatic reductions, and thiophene sulfur-oxidations. Next, molecule descriptors
  and the top-five pathway scores are submitted to a second hidden layer, which computes
  a molecule bioactivation score (MBS or molecule score) for the input molecule. Molecule
  scores also represent the probability of a molecule undergoing bioactivation by
  any of the pathways considered and, like pathway scores, ranges from zero to one.
  A chemical structure is represented by the molecule node. The other circles are
  probabilistic scores between 0 and 1. Blocks are vectors of real numbers. The stack
  of plates marked “Pathways” represents that the pathway-level module is replicated
  across all possible metabolites and their corresponding pathways. On the right,
  site-level data are illustrated on the top (with sites of predicted bioactivation
  circled), and molecule-level data are illustrated on the bottom (with the molecules
  of predicted bioactivation circled). Model output for two pairs of highly similar
  molecules are illustrated.
