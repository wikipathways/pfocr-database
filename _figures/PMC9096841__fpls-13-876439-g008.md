caption: Model of central C metabolism in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ΔrbcL mutant depending
  on the carbon status. The relative changes of the abundance of 19 metabolites is
  represented using colored squares extracted from a heatmap. The top four squares
  are replicates that represent metabolite abundance in presence of acetate, and the
  bottom four in absence of acetate, both after a 5 min light treatment (300 μmol
  photons m–2 s–1). The major pathways shown are the glyoxylate and TCA cycles represented
  together, the gluconeogenic pathway from PYR and PEP to Starch, the Oxidative Pentose
  Phosphate pathway (gray arrows) and the Calvin Benson Bassham cycle, represented
  here as “broken” due to the absence of RuBisCO (dotted gray arrows). The width of
  the black arrows represents the preferential flows in heterotrophic conditions.
  Purple arrows represents preferential flows in absence of acetate. Glc, glucose;
  GTP, Guanosine-5’-triphosphate; 6PGL, 6-phosphogluconolactone; 6PG, 6-phosphogluconic
  acid. Data has been normalized by metabolite and heatmaps have been generated by
  the heatmaply package on Rstudio. Color is based on correlation coefficient according
  to the color scale indicated.
