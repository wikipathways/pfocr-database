caption: We hypothesize that the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds in cofilin
  (leading to rod formation) in response to ROS production is competitive with cofilin's
  intramolecular oxidation, which targets it to mitochondria to trigger apoptosis.
  Rods are reversible if REDOX pathways can reduce the ROS levels and thus rods may
  form and disappear many times. We hypothesize that eventually a large surge in ROS
  may trigger cofilin-induced apoptosis occurring later in AD progression.
