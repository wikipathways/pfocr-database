caption: Schematic diagram of proposed lipogenic pathway regulated by MUL1 during
  conditions of HFD. MUL1 inactivation in mice impairs mitophagy and affects lipogenesis,
  fatty acid synthesis, and energy expenditure (β-oxidation) during dietary overload.
  Mul1(−/−) mice on HFD have decreased expression of SCD1 and activation of phosphorylated-AMPK
  (pAMPK) which in turn downregulates the protein level of ACC1 and FASN enzymes.
  Additionally, pAMPK1 increases the expression of CPT1 in the OMM that is involved
  in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria for β-oxidation. CPT1 expression
  increased and is further regulated by the downregulation of malonyl-CoA. Low levels
  of malonyl-CoA and reduction in FASN protein invariably inhibit the synthesis of
  fatty acids. In addition, the downregulation of SCD1 decreases the production of
  monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and reduces lipogenesis. Furthermore, increased
  expression of NDUFAB1 and NDUFS6 promotes the activity of complex I of ETC., and
  enhances mitochondrial metabolism
