caption: 'Flavonoids modulate inflammation and immunity pathways in cancer. Pro-inflammatory
  stimuli like TNF-α and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can bind to Tumor Necrosis Factor
  Receptor (TNFR) and TLR4 receptors, respectively, and activate the TAK1, which is
  mediated by TNFR-associated Death Domain (TRADD), TRAF2/5, and Receptor-Interacting
  Protein 1 (RIP) in response to TNF-α/TNFR signaling and Myd88 and TRAF6 in LPS-TLR4
  signaling. TAK1 activates Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MKKs) and I Kappa B
  Kinases (IKKs), leading to translocation of AP-1 and NF-κB to the nucleus. Flavonoids
  act mainly in inhibiting the nuclear translocation, expression, or phosphorylation
  of these transcription factors. The first signal for NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  is through NF-κB-mediated transcription of NLRP3. The second signal is mediated
  by Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs),
  Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), and K+ efflux. When NLRP3 inflammasome
  is activated, caspase 1 cleaves pro IL-18 and pro-IL-1β in activated forms. Flavonoids
  act in this pathway mainly by inhibiting caspase 1 activity and reducing the NLRP3
  expression. The TGR5-cAMP signaling pathway is activated by Genistein to lead to
  ubiquitination and degradation of NLRP3. Flavonoids also modulate the JAK2-STAT3
  signaling, reducing inflammatory and EMT markers. Epi: Epigallocatechin, Kae: Kaempferol;
