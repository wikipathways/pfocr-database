caption: 'The connection between learning and DNA repair is made by p300.p300 is involved
  in G-protein signaling. Some G proteins stimulate adenylate cyclase that results
  in elevation of cAMP. cAMP stimulates PKA. CREB interacts with cAMP response element
  and this modification is protein-kinase A mediated, promoting the interaction of
  the KID domain of CREB with the KIX domain of p300. p300 is a transcription co-activator
  with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity. It acetylates OGG1 at Lys338
  and Lys341 and also 5’ flap endonuclease 1, and in this way p300 plays a central
  role in the long-patch pathway of base excision repair.AP site: Apurinic/apyrimidinic
  site; APE1: AP endonuclease 1; AC: adenylate cyclase; PKA: protein-kinase A; cAMP:
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate; CREB: cAMP response element binding protein; FEN1:
  5’ flap endonuclease 1; GPCR: G-protein coupled receptor; OGG1: 8-oxoguanine glycosylase;
  dRp: deoxyribose phosphate.'
