caption: Schematic Models of Tap46/Tap42/α4 Functions in TOR Signaling Pathways in
  Eukaryotes.(A) TOR signaling in yeast. There are two functionally distinct TOR complexes
  in yeast, TORC1 and TORC2. TOR complex 1 (TORC1) contains KOG1, TCO89, LST8, and
  either TOR1 or TOR2. TORC1 mediates rapamycin-sensitive TOR functions that lead
  to activation of translation, inhibition of transcription of starvation-responsive
  genes, and inhibition of protein turnover. Tap42 and Sch9 (an AGC family kinase)
  are important direct effectors of TORC1. Tap42 interacts with PP2Ac and PP2Ac-like
  phosphatase subunits and regulates the activity of downstream effectors, such as
  NPR1, GCN2, and GLN3, for the control of permease turnover, translation, and transcription
  of starvation-responsive genes, respectively. Sch9 regulates the activity of RNA
  polymerases I and III to affect ribosome biogenesis among many other functions.
  TOR complex 2 (TORC2) consists of TOR2, LST8, AVO1, AVO2, and AVO3. TORC2 is insensitive
  to rapamycin and mediates actin cytoskeleton organization. AVO, adheres voraciously
  to TOR2; GCN2, general control nonderepressible 2; GLN3, glutamine metabolism 3;
  KOG1, kontroller of growth 1; LST8, lethal with sec thirteen protein 8; NPR1, nitrogen
  permease reactivator 1; TCO89, TOR complex one 89.(B) mTOR signaling in mammals.
  Growth factors and nutrients activate, while stress inactivates, the mammailan TOR
  complex 1 (mTORC1) that consists of mTOR, Raptor, and mLST8. α4 is the Tap42 homolog
  in mammals and interacts with PP2Ac and PP2Ac-like subunits. mTORC1 controls cell
  growth and protein synthesis through the action of S6K (translation activator) and
  4E-BP (translation inhibitor). Phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP promotes translation
  via RPS6 and eIF4E, respectively. The α4-PP2Ac complex may control the activity
  of the effectors S6K and 4E-BP. The α4-PP2Ac is also involved in the repression
  of apoptosis. The mTORC2 complex that is insensitive to rapamycin consists of mTOR,
  Rictor, mLST8, and mSin1 and mediates actin cytoskeleton organization. 4E-BP, eukaryotic
  initiation factor 4E binding protein; eIF4E, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E; mSin1,
  stress-activated map kinase-interacting protein 1; Raptor, regulatory associated
  protein of mTOR (KOG1 homolog); Rictor, rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR;
  RPS6, ribosomal protein S6; S6K, ribosomal S6 protein kinase.(C) TOR signaling in
  plants. The plant TOR complex regulates plant growth, translation, and metabolism
  in response to growth signals, nutrients, and environmental conditions. The plant
  TOR complex may consist of TOR, Raptor, and LST8. The TOR complex promotes cell
  growth and translation through the regulation of S6K and its substrate RPS6. Our
  results suggest that Tap46 and its associated PP2Ac and PP2Ac-like subunits play
  a critical role in mediating TOR signaling, leading to the promotion of protein
  translation and the repression of autophagy, nutrient recycling, and PCD/senescence.
  It is not known whether TORC2 is present in plants.
