caption: Schematic representation of engineering Synechocystis 6803 for production
  of limonene. Codon-optimized limonene synthases from Mentha spicata and Citrus limon
  were heterologously expressed in Synechocystis 6803 to produce S-limonene and R-limonene,
  respectively. The limonene biosynthetic pathway was optimized by overexpressing
  genes in the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway and a geranyl diphosphate synthase from
  Abies grandis. G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; MEP, methylerythritol-4-phosphate;
  IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate;
  lims, limonene synthase; gpps, geranyl diphosphate synthase.
