caption: In ApoE −/− mice, the consumption of a WD induces hypercholesterolemia, and
  activates the 3 branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR) that are initiated
  by the activation of ATF6α (orange), PERK (blue), and IRE1α (gray) in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). Key activated signaling components (red) were assessed by Western
  blotting and are indicated by green arrows. The activation of these 3 pathways results
  in the transcriptional upregulation of genes that facilitate adaptation (Bip and
  Pdi) and apoptosis (Chop) through ATF6α, ATF4, and XBP1s. Collectively, UPR‐related
  signaling cascades and the downstream transcription activation steps determine the
  balance between adaptation and apoptosis. Aging selectively activates the ATF6α
  pathway, which tips the balance toward apoptosis. ATF6α indicates activating transcription
  factor 6 alpha; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain‐binding protein; CHOP, C/EBP homologous
  transcription factor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IRE1α, inositol‐requiring enzyme
  1 alpha; ND, normal chow diet; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; p‐eIF2α, phosphorylated
  alpha subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2; p‐PERK, phosphorylated
  pancreatic ER eIF2‐alpha kinase; UPR, unfolded protein response; and WD, Western
  diet.
