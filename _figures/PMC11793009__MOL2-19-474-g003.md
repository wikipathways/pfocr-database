caption: Schematic representation of the potential regulation loop of MET and ETS
  collaboration. (1) MET is activated by HGF leading to its phosphorylation and (2)
  the activation of its downstream pathways. (3) ETS factors are activated potentially
  through MET pathway. (4) ETS target genes are up‐ or down‐regulated (5) leading
  to particular protein expression and a potential loop thanks to MET and HGF up‐regulation.
  (6) The activation loop led to the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells.
