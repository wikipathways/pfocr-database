caption: 'Chronic phase-CHIKV mediated joint pathology: in the joints, osteoblast
  cells (Bone-forming cells) are susceptible to CHIKV infection causing over-expression
  of IL-6 and RANKL and inhibition of osteoprotegerin (OPG). Also, fibroblast-like
  synoviocytes (HFLS) that are present in the synovial membrane lining the synovial
  joints, secrete enhanced levels of RANKL, IL-6, IL-8, and (MCP-1), upon CHIKV infection
  resulting in higher RANKL: OPG ratio, which favors osteoclast formation from precursor
  cells. RANKL and OPG maintain bone homeostasis as RANKL promotes osteoclastogenesis.
  RANKL recruits TRAF6 which induces auto amplification of NFATc1 (a transcription
  factor) via NF-κB and c-fos pathway and dependent on calcium signaling of ITAMs
  clastogenesis. NFATc1 in complex with AP-1 regulates the expression of genes involved
  in osteoclast differentiation e.g., calcitonin receptor, cathepsin K, and β3 integrin.
  Secretion of IL-1 and TNF-α by CHIKV infected resident macrophages phosphorylate
  JNK and ERK which in turn activates AP-1 family member, c-jun, which dimerize with
  c-fos and induce transcription of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) that degrades
  components of extracellular matrix by collagenase activity.'
