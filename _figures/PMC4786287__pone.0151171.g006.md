caption: Levels of metabolites from amino acid anaplerosis and the TCA cycle were
  analyzed in whole ACP KD and MECR OX cells and their respective controls using metabolomics,
  which included UHLC/MS/MS and GC/MS, as described in Experimental Procedures. Amino
  acid anaplerosis intermediates that were identified are indicated with arrows and
  a corresponding box plot. Y-axes for box plots indicate scaled intensity. Direction
  of change in metabolite levels compared to control in ACP KD is indicated by gray
  arrows, and direction of change of metabolite levels relative to control in MECR
  OX is indicated by blue arrows. In box plots, metabolite levels are shown for ACP
  KD cells, MECR OX cells, and their respective controls. For each box, n = 6 and
  open circles indicate extreme data points.
