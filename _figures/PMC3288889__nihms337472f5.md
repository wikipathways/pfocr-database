caption: Ephrin-B cleavage and signaling. A) Upon bind the EphB receptor, ephrin-B
  may be proteolytically processed by MMPs and presenilin 1/-gamma secretase to release
  a C-terminal fragment. The free fragment may translocate to the nucleus to perform
  a yet unknown function, or possibly the fragment binds to the Src kinase and inhibits
  its association with inhibitory kinase Csk, and allows Src autophosphorylation.
  Src, in turn, phosphorylates ephrin-B2, which can recruit certain signaling partners,
  such as Grb4, leading to functional effects. B) Unliganded ephrin-Bs may be cleaved
  by ADAM13 leading to an increase in canonical Wnt signaling through the cognate
  EphB receptor. Upon binding to the EphB receptor, ephrin-Bs may be resistant to
  ADAM13 cleavage, thus activating non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway (not pictured) at
  the expense of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.
