caption: Overlap in FcεRI, FcγRIII, and FcγRIIB signaling. IgE-bound multivalent antigen
  or IgG immune complexes induce FcεRI or FcγRIII/FcγRIIB crosslinking, respectively.
  These events lead to the swift activation of Src family kinases Lyn and Fyn. Both
  positively influence downstream signaling through Syk and LAT, but Lyn also produces
  negative feedback by phosphorylating ITIMs and by inducing the Csk recruitment via
  SH2 interactions with phosphorylated Cbp/PAG. Additionally, Fyn stimulates the PI3-K
  axis. Under FcεRI-driven signaling, Fyn activates STAT5, transcription factors that
  are required for mast cell survival (STAT5A) and cytokine production (STAT5B). Regulatory
  cytokines such as IL-10 and TGFβ1 can inhibit Fyn and STAT5 production, possibly
  through the induction of specific miRs.
