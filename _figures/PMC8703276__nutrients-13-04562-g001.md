caption: Enzymes and cofactors involved in the one-carbon cycle, including methionine
  and folate metabolism. Dietary folate (vitamin B9) is converted into dihydrofolate
  (DHF) by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and is then reduced to tetrahydrofolate
  (THF). THF is converted to 5,10-methyleneTHF, which is converted to 5-methylTHF
  by the MTHFR enzyme (using vitamins B1, B2, and B3 as cofactors). 5-methylTHF is
  then used as a methyl donor in pyrimidine and purine synthesis and can donate a
  methyl group to regenerate methionine from homocysteine (Hcy); this reaction is
  catalysed by methionine synthase (MS) with vitamin B12 as a cofactor. This is termed
  remethylation. Dietary betaine from the liver can also serve as a methyl donor and
  participate in remethylation. Thereafter, methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) catalyses
  the transfer of adenosine to methionine to generate s-adenosylmethionine (SAM),
  which functions in methylation reactions. SAM is then demethylated and forms s-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH), which is hydrolysed to form Hcy. Hcy can now enter the transsulfuration pathway
  to form cystathionine (catalysed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS)) and cysteine
  (catalysed by cystathionase). Cysteine is then used to synthesise glutathione (GSH),
  thereby regenerating antioxidant levels to combat damage by reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). Enzymes and cofactors are indicated in dark red and light green squares,
  respectively.
