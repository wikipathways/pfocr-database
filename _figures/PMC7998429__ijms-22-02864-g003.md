caption: 'Nail organ markers and the requirement of the bone morphogenetic protein
  (BMP) signaling in proper nail development and differentiation. (A) Multi-layered
  skin epidermis expresses loricrin and soft keratins K1, K5, K14. The NPF region,
  rich in soft keratins K5, K14, K15 and K19, comprises slow-cycling LRC+ nail proximal
  fold stem cells (NPFSCs), proximally surrounded by the Lgr5 positive cells (in light
  blue). During normal homeostasis, the NPFSCs contribute long term to peri-nail epidermis
  (yellow arrow) but can also deliver the progeny to the nail matrix and differentiate
  into AE13-positive nail plate (NP) (orange and red arrows). The following intermediate
  zone (IZ) contains an intermediate gradient between slow- (Ki67-) to fast-cycling
  (Ki67+) cells, which reinforce the Lgr6-positive proximal matrix. Atop lies the
  keratogenous zone (KZ), devoid of the soft keratins. The distal matrix is an area
  of Wntless expression and thus the Wnt signaling pathway activation. This region’s
  activity was not yet determined in a mouse model deprived of the BMP signaling pathway.
  (B) The nail structures of the Bmpr1a-deficient mice manifested with an absence
  of the KZ and the hard NP structure, observed as a loss of the AE13 marker. Instead,
  the nail mini-organ was covered with a granular layer of extended skin epidermis,
  which expressed epidermal markers: loricrin and K1. Moreover, a significant reduction
  in matrix volume was observed and the hyperplasia of the NB.'
