caption: A model for the evolution of the intracellular multiplier peroxiporin signal
  transduction pathway powering piscine spermatozoa. In spermatozoa from more primitive
  FW teleost lineages, such as in zebrafish and salmonids, a rise of intracellular
  Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) upon activation in FW triggers the PKC-GSK3 signaling pathway, leading
  to the direct PKC (zebrafish) or GSK3 (Atlantic salmon) phosphorylation of N-terminal
  Aqp8bb residues, promoting rapid channel trafficking to the mitochondria. In modern
  marine teleosts such as the seabream, which release the sperm into SW, a cross-talk
  between [Ca2+]i-activated PKC and ROS-activated JNK and PKC signaling pathways converge
  to activate GSK3 with an additional JNK-mediated multiplier regulation of Aqp8bb
  mitochondrial trafficking to cope with a higher osmotic stress.
