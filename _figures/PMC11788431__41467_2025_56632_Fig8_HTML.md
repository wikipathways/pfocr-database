caption: In ES cells, C1GALT1 (a resident Golgi protein) O-glycosylates SMO (as indicated
  by the yellow square and circle), resulting in SMO stabilization and release of
  GLI1/2 from sequestration by SUFU. Translocation of GLI1/2 to the nucleus promotes
  EWSR1::FLI1 expression and drives ES cell survival and tumor formation. GLI1 is
  also a direct target of EWSR1::FLI1. Inhibition of C1GALT1 by ITZ results in destabilization
  of SMO and de-activation of the Hh signaling pathway, which in turn decreases EWSR1::FLI1
  expression and reduces ES cell viability and tumor growth. Created in BioRender.com69
