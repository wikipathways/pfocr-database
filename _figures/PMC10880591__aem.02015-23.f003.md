caption: Relative contents of sulfur metabolites estimated by the sulfur index analysis
  and predicted sulfur metabolic pathway. The contents of thiol metabolites in strain
  THIF08 cultured with COS or sulfate as a sole sulfur source were expressed as relative
  amounts by the peak area in the mass spectrometry monitoring the m/z transition
  of the derivatives, and the values were normalized to those amounts of ergosterol.
  Data are means ± s.e.m. of three biological replicates for relative contents of
  cysteine, cystathionine, S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), 5-glutamylcysteine,
  glutathione, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), glutathione persulfide (GS-SH), a persulfide
  form of glutathione disulfide (GS-S-SH), GS-SS-SG, and ergothioneine are shown.
  Statistical significance was calculated using a two-tailed Student’s t-test if the
  F-test was P > 0.05 or a two-tailed Welch’s t-test if the F-test was P < 0.05. *P
  < 0.05 and **P < 0.01
