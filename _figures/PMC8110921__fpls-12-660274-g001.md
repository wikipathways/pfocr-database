caption: 'Transcriptional network of ROS signaling for root development. At the left
  side, three regions in Arabidopsis root are shown (meristematic zone, elongation
  zone, and maturation zone). Color gradient in the primary root indicates the distribution
  of ROS (red: O2– and green: H2O2). Cell cycle: ROS regulates the expression of G1–S
  as well as G2–M transition-related genes. SOG1, a key transcription factor, is activated
  in response to DNA damage such as double-strand breaks (DSBs). SOG1 directly induces
  the expression of FMO1, which encodes flavin-containing monooxygenase. H2O2 level
  modulated by FMO1 influences the expressions of cell cycle-related genes. Stem cell
  niche: H2O2 level is lowered by ABO8, PHB, and RITF1 signaling pathways, whereas
  APP1 signaling pathway leads to its accumulation. H2O2 regulates the expression
  of ERF109, ERF114, and ERF115 and represses PLT activity for SCN maintenance. RITF1
  signaling pathway positively regulates PLT activity through O2– accumulation. Transition:
  ROS spatial distribution between O2– and H2O2 decides the transition from cell proliferation
  to cell elongation. UPB1, a key transcription factor, changes ROS spatial distribution
  by regulating the expression of peroxidases (PERs). RITF1 also controls the meristem
  size under ROS signaling through PLT2 protein stability. In the elongation zone,
  ANAC032 and MYB30 regulate the expression of cell elongation-related genes in response
  to H2O2. Root hair: Whether epidermal cells can form root hair is determined by
  gene network (H, hair cells; N, non-hair cells). The RHD6 gene regulatory network
  begins to bulge at the root hair initiation site in H cells. RSL4, which is under
  the RHD6 gene regulatory network, controls the expression of RBOHC/RHD2, RBOHJ,
  and several PERs for the root tip growth. A positive feedback loop is formed during
  hair elongation among Ca2+-permeable channels and RBOHs via ROS. In addition, ROS
  distribution in the root hair tip is controlled by PFT1, which regulates the expression
  of PERs. Flavonols contribute to the development of root hair as antioxidants, which
  modulate ROS accumulation. Lateral root: Lateral root (LR) development is initiated
  from pericycle cells called founder cells. UPB1 controls LR emergence by regulating
  the expression of PERs at the peripheral cells of LRP. RSL4 regulates the expression
  of RBOHs, followed by ROS production, for facilitating LR emergence. MYB36 in LR
  development maintains ROS balance at the LRP boundary in the pericycle cells to
  allow their transition from flat to dome-shaped primordia. Casparian strip: In the
  endodermal cells, localized ROS in apoplasts induced by RBOHD and RBOHF are utilized
  for the lignification for the Casparian strip formation. Arrows indicate positive
  regulation, and blunted lines indicate negative regulation. Ovals, rectangles, and
  hexagons indicate signal molecules such as plant hormones, transcription factors,
  and secondary messenger molecules, respectively. PER, peroxidases; DSB, double-strand
  breaks; SCN, stem cell niche; LR, lateral root; CS, Casparian strip.'
