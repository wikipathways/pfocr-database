caption: Mechanism of NFκB action. In inactivated state, NF-κβ, which consists of
  Rel and p50 proteins, is located in the cytosol complexed with the inhibitory protein
  Iκβα. IκB kinase (IKK) is activated by extracellular signals via membrane receptors.
  Subsequently, IKK phosphorylates the Iκβα protein resulting in ubiquitination of
  Iκβα and eventually by the proteasome for Iκβα degradation (canonical pathway).
  In non-canonical pathway, RelB favors the activation of NF-κβ via RelB. Activated
  NF-κβ is further translocated into the nucleus for DNA bindings, called response
  elements (RE). The DNA/NF-κβ complex attracts coactivators and RNA polymerase, which
  transcribe the DNA into mRNA resulting in a cell transformation.
