caption: The colored components of the pathway were quantified in this study and remained
  altered after late glycemic control, indicating that these constitute part of the
  diabetic kidney metabolic memory. The persistent disruption of uric acid clearance
  may feed the prolonged kidney biochemical alterations observed after tight glycemic
  control. The demonstration of this sustained metabolic derangement may shed light
  on the understanding of the long interval required between the acquisition of glycemic
  control in diabetic individuals and reducing the risk of developing DKD.
