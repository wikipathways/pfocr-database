caption: In addition to the hypothesis outlined in , a number of other mechanistic
  pathways could potentially lead to the formation of products 3-5 (). The ligand
  effects, stereoselectivity, and product stereochemistry described above can be used
  to evaluate the viability of the various possible mechanisms for this transformation.
  For example, product 3 could potentially derive from intermolecular carbopalladation
  of 1a followed by C-N bond-forming reductive elimination (, Path A). However, this
  pathway is unlikely due to the high stereoselectivity for formation of products
  in which the aryl group is installed syn to the C-3 methylene. If the reactions
  were to occur via intermolecular carbopalladation without chelation of the amino
  group or formation of an amido complex it is likely that steric repulsion between
  the Pd(Ar)(X) complex and the alkyl chain would favor formation of the anti-diastereomer
  12 (or at least would likely provide mixtures of diastereomers). The formation of
  3 via Wacker-type aminopalladation (Path B) can be ruled out, as this pathway would
  result in anti-addition of the heteroatom and the metal across the carbon-carbon
  double bond to provide 12 rather than the observed products 3a-g. The reductive
  Heck-arylation of 4 (Path C) can also be discounted as a possible mechanism for
  the generation of 3a and/or 5a, as the transformation of 4 to 3a and/or 5a is not
  observed under the conditions employed for the conversion of 1a to 3a or 5a.
