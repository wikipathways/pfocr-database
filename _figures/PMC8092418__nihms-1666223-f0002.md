caption: Pheromone binds to a cell surface receptor that in turn activates a downstream
  signaling cascade through the protein kinase Ste20 homologs in S. cerevisiae and
  C. neoformans, or Upc2 in U. maydis. The signal is relayed through a highly conserved
  MAPK cascade, in which the MAP kinase phosphorylates and activates the downstream
  transcription factor, resulting in gene transcription. The transcription factors
  diverge in different fungi. Ste12 in S. cerevisiae is a homeodomain transcription
  factor, while the Prf1 in U. maydis is an HMG-box transcription factor. In C. neoformans,
  the Prf1 homolog is dispensable for mating, but another HMG-box transcription factor
  Mat2 regulates pheromone signaling. Some components of this pathway are omitted
  for clarity.
