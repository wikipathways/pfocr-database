caption: Removal of the survival agent, NGF, inhibits the PI3K-AKT pathway. AKT inhibition
  leads to activation of GSK-3β, which in turn phosphorylates its downstream substrate,
  MLK3 on Ser789 and Ser793. This phosphorylation causes MLK3 activation, finally
  leading to cell death via JNK activation. On the contrary, survival agents, such
  as insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1, cause activation of PI3K-AKT pathway.
  The activated AKT phosphorylates GSK-3βat Ser9 and at the same time also phospho-rylates
  MLK3 at Ser674. The AKT-mediated phosphorylation of GSK-3β and MLK3 down-regulates
  their kinase activities, leading to cell survival by attenuating JNK activity.

  description: Removal of the survival agent, NGF, inhibits the PI3K-AKT pathway.
    AKT inhibition leads to activation of GSK-3β, which in turn phosphorylates its
    downstream substrate, MLK3 on Ser789 and Ser793. This phosphorylation causes MLK3
    activation, finally leading to cell death via JNK activation. On the contrary,
    survival agents, such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1, cause activation
    of PI3K-AKT pathway. The activated AKT phosphorylates GSK-3βat Ser9 and at the
    same time also phospho-rylates MLK3 at Ser674. The AKT-mediated phosphorylation
    of GSK-3β and MLK3 down-regulates their kinase activities, leading to cell survival
    by attenuating JNK activity.
