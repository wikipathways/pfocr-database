caption: Upon binding of growth factors to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the receptor
  gets activated through the phosphorylation of YXXM motifs. The activation of the
  RTKs will result into the recruitment of p85 and the p110 subunits, which together
  forms the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), to the plasma membrane in order
  to phosphorylate the phosphatidylinositide 4,5- bisphosphate (PIP2) and transforms
  it into the phosphatidylinositide 3,4,5- triphosphate (PIP3). Alternatively, the
  PI3Ks can also be activated by KRAS, which alone can activate downstream signaling
  pathways such as the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway and result into cell proliferation and
  survival. The PI3K signaling pathway is normally inactivated through Phosphatase
  and tensin homolog (PTEN) converting PIP3 back into PIP2. PIP3 acts as a second
  messenger that can recruit AKT to the plasma membrane and activate downstream effectors
  such as Rac1, CDC42 and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase PDK1. Activated PDK1 is
  able to phosphorylate recruited AKT on the Thr308 residue. In addition, MTOR complex
  2 (MTORC2) is able to phosphorylate AKT on the Ser473 residue. Phosphorylation of
  either or both residues of AKT results in downstream signaling events such as cell
  growth, protein synthesis and angiogenesis through MTORC1. Furthermore, activated
  AKT can also promote cell survival through inhibiting cellular processes such as
  glucose metabolism and apoptosis through blocking glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)
  and pro-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family; BAD and BAX respectively. Moreover,
  AKT can also inhibit apoptosis through the activation of Nuclear factor κβ (NF-κβ),
  and promote migration.
