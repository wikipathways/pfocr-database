caption: Regulation of the RLR adaptor MAVS mediated by protein palmitoylationIn the
  RLR signaling pathway, CPT1A interacts with ZDHHC4 to promote MAVS palmitoylation
  at Cys79. ZDHHC24 benefits MAVS palmitoylation, while APT2 depalmitoylates MAVS
  at Cys46 and Cys79. MAVS could also be palmitoylated by ZDHHC7 at Cys508. In addition,
  palmitoylation of Rac inhibits MAVS activation by inhibiting the interaction of
  TRIM31 with MAVS and recruiting cFLIPL and CASP8 to activate RIPK1 cleavage and
  subsequently inhibit MAVS
