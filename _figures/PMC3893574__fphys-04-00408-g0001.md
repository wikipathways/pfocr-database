caption: Schematic representation of miRNAs involved in the regulation of the IGF-1/Akt
  pathway and myostatin signaling. IGF-1 increases the activity of Akt protein. This
  activation of Akt is attenuated by PTEN. The activated state of Akt stimulates protein
  synthesis through mTOR. Akt also inhibits protein degradation by suppressing the
  activity of GSK3β and FoxO1, which induces protein degradation by activating the
  expression of MuRF1 and Atrogin1. Therefore, the IGF-1/Akt pathway induces skeletal
  muscle hypertrophy. Recent studies have shown that miR-1, miR-133, miR-206, and
  miR-128a negatively regulate the IGF-1/Akt pathway by targeting positive regulators
  of the IGF-1/Akt pathway (IGF-1, IGF-1R, IRS1, HSP70, or p70S6K), while miR-29,
  miR-486, and miR-23a positively regulate this pathway by targeting negative regulators
  (PTEN, FoxO1, MuRF1, or Atrogin1). In contrast to the IGF-1/Akt pathway, myostatin
  signaling is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass. Myostatin activates Smad3
  protein and may inhibit protein synthesis by repressing the transcription of miR-486
  and miR-29, which target PTEN and FoxO1 proteins. Conversely, myostatin expression
  is regulated by miR-27a/b, miR-208a/b, and miR-499. Red lines indicate the inhibitory
  function of miRNAs identified in skeletal muscle, while red-dashed lines represent
  the inhibitory function of miRNAs identified in cardiac muscle and cultured cells.
