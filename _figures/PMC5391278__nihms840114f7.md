caption: Regulation of SUMOylation pathway. Protein SUMOylation is regulated by a
  recycling system that consists of conjugation and deconjugation pathways. SUMO conjugation
  to target substrates involves an enzymatic cascade that is comprised of three classes
  of enzymes (E1, E2, and E3). The sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) are responsible
  for the deconjugation pathway as well as the maturation process of newly synthesized
  SUMO protein. The primary subcellular localization of each SENP is also listed [].
