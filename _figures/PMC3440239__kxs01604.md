caption: Active pathways identified when comparing early versus late samples in the
  seedling germination data from Arabidopsis (visualization as in ). The top 5 identified
  pathways from (a) just using the first round of estimation, and (b) using five consecutive
  rounds in which one pathway is picked in each round. The node sizes are scaled to
  reflect the total pathway size, including both genes and metabolites. The edges
  connecting the nodes have been scaled to represent the overlap between the pathways.
  Interesting biological pathways like ABC transporters and Glycerophospholipid metabolism
  are identified.
