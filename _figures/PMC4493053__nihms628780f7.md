caption: Genes that were found in the genomic analyses of SHH-MBs to harbor activating
  mutations (green stars), inactivating mutations (red stars), or were found to be
  amplified (MYCN and GLI) are indicated. All these mutations lead to activation of
  GLI proteins and their downstream pathways. Options for targeted treatment are indicated.
  Patients harboring mutations in either PTCH1 or SMO should be responsive to SMO
  inhibitors, whereas patients harboring mutations more downstream in the SHH pathway
  (SUFU, MYCN, and GLI) or in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and/or PKA-pathways may be treated
  using arsenic trioxide (ATO) or other more specific GLI-inhibitors or PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  inhibitors.
