caption: 'Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is rapidly hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylases,
  which mediates binding by the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex, addition of poly-Ub
  which tags it for proteosomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylases
  cannot hydroxylate HIF-1α, preventing VHL binding which leads to HIF-1α stabilization.
  HIF-1α then heterodimerizes with HIF-1β, recruits the p3oo/CBP co-factors and forms
  an active HIF transcription complex in the nucleus that binds to HREs on target
  genes and activates their transcription.HIF: Hypoxia inducible factor; HRE: Hypoxia
  response element; Ub: Ubiquitin chains; VHL: von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor
  protein.'
