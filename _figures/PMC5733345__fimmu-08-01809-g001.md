caption: Principal pathways of cell death. Apoptosis comprises of the intrinsic and
  extrinsic pathway. In the intrinsic pathway, cells sense stress signals, leading
  to upregulation and activation of BH3 proteins. When antiapoptotic molecules that
  normally bind and keep BH3 proteins and/or BAX/BAK in check are displaced, BH3 proteins
  will trigger activation of BAX and BAK. BAX/BAK then mediate cytochrome c release
  from the mitochondrial outer membrane to the cytosol, activating Caspase-9 and downstream
  caspases leading to cell demise. In the extrinsic pathway, extracellular ligands
  engage cell death receptors, leading to formation of the death-inducing signaling
  complex (DISC) with the adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD)
  and pro-caspase 8, leading to activation of caspase 8 and subsequent activation
  of effector caspases and apoptosis. In this pathway, c-FLIP acts as a negative regulator.
  c-FLIP is structurally highly similar to procaspase-8 but lacks catalytic activity,
  thus outcompetes caspase 8 binding blunting the death-inducing signal. When extrinsic
  apoptosis in inhibited (Caspase 8 deficiency, caspase inhibition, and high c-FLIP
  expression), engagement of death ligand can initiate necroptosis that involves activation
  of the necroptosome comprising RIPK1, RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like
  (MLKL). Pytoptosis is a type of cell death initiated from activation of several
  Caspases that cleave IL-1β and IL-18. A downstream molecule Gasdermin is critical
  for cell death by pyroptosis. Autophagy promotes proteolytic degradation of mitochondria
  and other cytosolic components at the lysosome. It can promote survival or diminish
  survival depending on degraded molecules. BCL-2 family members with antiapoptotic
  and proapoptotic molecules can interact with upstream autophagy signaling molecules.
