caption: A proposed model for GA biosynthesis and response pathway in regulation of
  heterosis in plant height. Differential expressions of genes in GA metabolism and
  response pathways are listed in the box, with the bar heights representing the expression
  levels of female (left bar), hybrid (middle bar) and male (right bar) parent.
