caption: Schematic representation of the steroidogenic cascade involving the steroid
  hydroxylating cytochromes P450 (P450) that catalyze cleavage and/or hydroxylation
  of sequential substrates from cholesterol through pregnenolone, androstane and estrane
  (synthesis). The enzymes catalyzing each step are shown; cholesterol side chain
  cleavage (P450scc) cleaves the 6 carbon side chain (C6) from the 27 carbon skeleton
  (C27) releasing pregnenolone (C21). Subsequent metabolism by 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase
  (P450c17) produces 17-hydroxypregnanes (C21) that are intermediates in the production
  of either corticoids or sex steroids. Metabolism of 17-hydroxypregnanes by 21-hydroxylase
  (P450c21) and 11β-hydroxylase (P450c11) directs the pathway toward corticoid production.
  Alternatively, cleavage of the 17-hydroxypregnanes in a second oxidation catalyzed
  by P450c17 directs the pathway to androgen (C19) synthesis and then, after three
  oxidations culminating in cleavage of a methyl, to estrogens (C18). Note that P450c11
  and P450arom represent the terminal enzymes in the steroid synthetic cascade.
