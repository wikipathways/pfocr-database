caption: Activation of p38 MAPK signalling module. p38 MAPK is activated through a
  kinase cascade triggered by extracellular inflammatory stimuli. This sequential
  phosphorylation pathway includes MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKK) TAK1, ASK1 and DLK,
  whose targets are MAPK kinases (MAPKK) MKK3 and MKK6, which phosphorylate and activate
  the α, β, γ, and δ isoforms of p38 MAPK. The latter in turn phosphorylates downstream
  kinases and transcription factors involved in cellular responses underlying airway
  inflammation and remodelling. This original figure was created by the authors using
  BioRender.com.
