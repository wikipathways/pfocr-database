caption: The primary drug (red triangle)-target (unknown target) interaction initiate
  a metabolic feedback dependent on tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, stimulate the
  oxidation of NADH through the electron transport chain, promote superoxide (O2−)
  formation, damage the structure of Fe-S clusters, lead to the formation of hydroxyl
  radicals (OH−); and finally damage DNA, lipids or proteins and contributes to the
  cell death. The overexpressed genes found in our study (in the box and cycle) were
  involved into this process. The overexpression of some genes were induced in this
  drug-target cell death pathway (The dotted arrow), the others may inhibit the formation
  free radicals or prevent the damage by free radical (dotted line with a bar).
