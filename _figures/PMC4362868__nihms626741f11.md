caption: In fungi, the bZIP TF family proteins are closely linked to various developmental
  and physiological processes. In A. nidulans, the bZIP TFs play important roles in
  secondary metabolism, sexual development, and stress responses (; ). In N. crassa,
  the bZIP TFs are involved in responses to amino acid starvation, sulfur sources,
  and the oxidative stress (; ; ). In A. fumigatus, the bZIP TFs regulate asexual
  development, gliotoxin production, sulphur assimilation, iron starvation, and virulence
  (; ; ). In F. graminearum, bZIP TF FgAp1 mediates the oxidative stress response
  and trichothecene biosynthesis but not virulence (), while F. oxysporum FoMeab is
  important for the nitrogen response pathway (). Here, our data show that bZIP proteins
  of M. oryzae including MoHac1, MoMetR, and MoMeaB, all have important regulatory
  functions governing various developmental processes of the fungus. Our previous
  studies demonstrated that the bZIP TFs MoAp1 and MoAtf1 regulate stress responses
  that are important for pathogenicity. In this study, we systemically searched for
  bZIP TFs and identified additional 19 proteins that contain the characteristic bZIP
  structures in their ORFs. We showed that these additional members of the bZIP gene
  family have important shared and distinct effects on infection-related morphogenesis
  and pathogenicity. A summarizing model for MoBZIPs function is presented in . Among
  them, MoHac1, MoMetR, and MoBzip10 are associated with vegetative growth, conidiation,
  and pathogenicity, similar to MoAp1 and MoAtf1. MoBzip1, MoBzip2, MoBzip3, and MoBzip11
  are negative regulators of conidiation. In addition, MoMetR and MoBzip12 are required
  for conidial morphology, and MoBzip5 contributes to the appressorium formation.
  Moreover, MoHac1 plays an important role in the UPR via alternate splicing of its
  mRNA. MoMetR regulates methionine metabolism and loss of MoMETR results in methionine-deficient
  mutation. Finally, MoBzip10 participates in pathogenicity through the involvement
  in the generation of appressorium turgor pressure. Our findings revealed that most
  of the bZIP TFs have general roles during growth and development, which may be due
  to their conserved bZIP domains. However, the distinct phenotypes of these bZIP
  TFs suggested that they may also function via distinct pathways or mechanisms during
  normal or infection-related morphogenesis and development.
