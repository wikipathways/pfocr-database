caption: 'A proposed model of the role of ORA59 and RRTF1 in JA/ET and JA-induced
  HCAAs accumulation. In Arabidopsis plants, infection with necrotrophic pathogens
  could activate both JA and ET signaling pathways. ACT gene expression and CouAgm
  biosynthesis were synergistically induced by a combination of JA and ET. JA/ET induced
  the key positive regulator ORA59 TF, which directly binds to the GCC-box of the
  ACT gene promoter and activates the ACT gene expression for CouAgm biosynthesis.
  The transcript of RRTF1 gene is induced only by JA, and RRTF1 TF directly activates
  CouAgm secretion transporter DTX18 gene expression through binding its target site:
  GAGCCGGCAG. JA stabilized RRTF1 not only at the transcriptional induction, but also
  on the de novo synthesized protein. Without JAs, BPM proteins interact with RRTF1,
  BPM proteins function as substrate adaptors to CUL3-based E3-ligases CUL3BPM, docking
  of the BPM–RRTF1 complex to the CUL3BPM E3-ligase results in the degradation of
  RRTF1. However, the molecular mechanism of SA negatively affected ORA59 protein
  accumulation is unclear. Arrows indicate activation, T-shaped lines indicate inhibition,
  broken lines indicate that this regulation was not reported to date, and the question
  mark indicates that unknown factors or pathway. RRTFBS, RRTF1 binding site GAGCCGGCAG.'
