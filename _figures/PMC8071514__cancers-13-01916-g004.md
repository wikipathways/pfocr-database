caption: 'Schematic model of the role of the acetylation pathway in TAp73 regulation.
  (A) SIRT2 can bind to p73α and suppress its transcriptional activity through the
  deacetylation of several lysine residues located in the p73α C-terminal region:
  Lys620,623,627. SIRT1 can also bind to and deacetylate the p73 protein to inhibit
  apoptosis and promote cell cycle progression through the inhibition of the pro-apoptotic
  genes Bax, PUMA, and NOXA and the cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1 gene. (B) In response
  to DNA damage, the expression of SIRT1 and SIRT1 proteins is downregulated, while
  the acetyltransferase p300 is activated and its binding to TAp73 is promoted. TAp73
  is then acetylated at several lysine321,327,331 positions. The p300-mediated TAp73
  acetylation is boosted by its phosphorylation at tyrosine99 by c-Abl, thereby promoting
  p73 activity and stability. The end result is an induction of apoptosis through
  the reactivation of Bax, PUMA, and NOXA and the arrest of the cell cycle via the
  activation of p21WAF1.'
