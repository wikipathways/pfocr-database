caption: GPI anchor synthesis pathway. The schematic shows the relevant part of the
  GPI anchor synthesis pathway. The proteins involved in each step are indicated below
  the line. PIGG transferase (bold) is reported to be expressed during erythropoiesis,
  but loss of function in Emm− individuals would mean EtNP is not added to mannose
  2. EtNP on mannose 2 is the likely antigenic target responsible for anti-Emm.
