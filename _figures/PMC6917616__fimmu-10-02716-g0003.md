caption: Metabolic and transcriptional adaption in tissue Treg cells. VAT-Treg cell
  accumulation is dependent upon TCR, Foxp3, and IL-33 signaling. VAT macrophages
  and DCs are the major antigen-presenting cells that express MHC-II to activate and
  increase VAT-Treg cells. In VAT, white adipose tissue produces IL-33 to increase
  VAT-Treg cell generation. Leptin produced by adipose cells inhibits VAT-Treg cell
  proliferation and induces anergy. Leptin-neutralizing antibody reverses anergy and
  increases mTOR activation and Treg cell proliferation. VAT-Treg cells have high
  expression of enzyme hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD), which is dependent
  on PPARγ. HPGD produces 15-keto PGE2 to suppress conventional T cell activation
  and proliferation. Intestinal Treg cells mainly contain Gata3+ tTreg, RORγt+, and
  RORγt− pTreg cells. RORγt+ pTreg cells are the dominant population in the colon,
  while RORγt− pTreg cells mainly localize in small intestine. Their difference is
  mainly derived from the dominant effect of microbiota and dietary metabolites, respectively,
  in the colon and small intestine. In the colon, metabolism of tryptophan produces
  AhR ligands, such as kynurenine, to selectively enhance the generation of Foxp3+
  Treg cells. In the small intestine, dietary vitamin A is present at high concentrations.
  RA, a metabolite from vitamin A, induces pTreg cells from naïve T cells in the small
  intestine in combination with TGF-β. RA also induces the expression of CCR9 on the
  surface of Treg cells to facilitate their migration to the small intestine. In tumor
  tissue, Treg cells not only display eTreg cell phenotypes similar to non-lymphoid
  organs but also express some tumor-specific gene signatures. Compared to conventional
  T cells, Treg cells have a metabolic advantage in tumor microenvironment, which
  has low glucose/amino acid, high lactate/hypoxia, and elevated oxidative stress.
  Genetic or pharmacological perturbation of metabolic pathway PI3K/Akt/Foxo signaling
  directly impacts tumor-resident Treg cell homeostasis, function and anti-tumor immunotherapy.
  VAT, visceral adipose tissue; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor.
