caption: Toll-like receptors and TLR-mediated signaling pathway. TLR1 and TLR6 recognize
  their ligands as heterodimers with TLR2. For TLR4, MD2, and CD14 are required for
  LPS recognition and signaling. TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, and TLR9 are currently thought
  to deliver their signal by forming homodimers after interacting with their ligands.
  TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9 are intracellular TLRs and are involved in the recognition
  of nucleic acids. Most TLRs, except for TLR3, signal through MyD88 pathway to activate
  NF-κB and AP1. TLR3 and TLR4 can signal through MyD88-independent pathway (TRIF
  pathway) to activate INF-β.
