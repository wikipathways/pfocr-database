caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of AM polarization toward M1 phenotype
  and early apoptosis induced by rLLB exposure. The blast waves can reach the lungs
  through the thorax or directly through the open airway, producing stimulation of
  AMs and causing M1 polarization and early apoptosis. The rLLB exposure generated
  by the Reddy-tube acted on MH-S cells, causing macrophage polarization to M1 phenotype
  through activation of the Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway. The rLLB exposure can also
  lead to ROS burst, Ca2+ accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential abnormalities
  and early apoptosis. Highly selective pan-Akt inhibitor (GDC-0068) and NF-κB inhibitor
  (PDTC) could inhibit the Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway and decrease macrophage polarization
  to the M1 phenotype
