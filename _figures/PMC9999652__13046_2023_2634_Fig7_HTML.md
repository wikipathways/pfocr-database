caption: The mechanism of CAFs-derived exosomal cargos regulate metabolic reprogramming
  of tumor cells. CAFs regulate metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells mainly by exosomal
  nucleic acids. Exosomal miR-522 activates the USP7/hnRNPA1 pathway by targeting
  ALOX15, blocking the accumulation of lipid-ROS. Exosomal SNHG3 inhibits OXPHOS and
  promotes glycolysis through the miR-330-5p/PKM axis. Exosomal TUG1 promotes glycolysis
  through the miR-524-5p/SIX1 axis. Exosomal LINC01614 enhances tumor cells glutamine
  uptake by up-regulating glutamine transporters SLC38A2 and SLC7A5. In addition,
  exosomal mtDNA can lead to endocrine therapy resistance in OXPHOS-dependent breast
  cancer
