caption: The role of mitochondrial dynamics in DCs and other immune cells. a Mitochondrial
  dynamics are involved in metabolic adaptations in the two main subsets of circulating
  DCs in human peripheral blood. In CD11c+ mDCs, mitochondrial fission mediated by
  DRP1 is essential for glycolysis. However, in pDCs, elongation of mitochondria mediated
  by MFN2 was observed, which is required for oxidative phosphorylation. b In NKT
  cells, activation and production of IFNγ and TNF were associated with mitochondrial
  fission via the RIPK-PGAM5-DRP1 pathway, which contributed to acute liver inflammation.
  c Upon LPS stimulation, human CD14+ monocytes showed enhanced microRNA-125b (miR-125b)
  activity followed by the downregulation of BIK and MTP18, which mediated mitochondrial
  fission and mitophagy related to rheumatoid arthritis. d Excessive mitochondrial
  fission in liver tumor-infiltrating NK cells was induced by hypoxia along with increased
  mTOR-Drp1 signaling, which reduced the antitumor activity of NK cells. In addition,
  in liver, NK cells outside tumors and peripheral NK cells had large, tubular mitochondria
