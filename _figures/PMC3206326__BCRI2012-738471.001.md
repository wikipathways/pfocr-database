caption: Activation of membrane phospholipid synthesis. Expression of XBP1(S) stimulates
  de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis and the new FAs are incorporated into diacylglycerol
  (DAG) and ceramide (Cer), immediate precursors of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho),
  and sphingomyelin (SM) phospholipids, respectively. The mechanism of stimulation
  by XBP1(S) has not yet been defined. Elevation of the DAG level alters the membrane
  lipid composition which leads to activation of the choline cytidylyltransferase
  (CCT) enzymes which produce CDP-choline (CDP-Cho). The DAG and CDP-Cho precursors
  are converted to PtdCho by the choline phosphotransferase (CPT) enzymes. Excess
  DAG which is not incorporated into phospholipid, is redirected and incorporated
  into triacylglycerol (TAG) which can accumulate in lipid droplets. PtdCho conversion
  to SM is mediated by sphingomyelin synthase (SMsyn). PtdCho conversion to phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PtdEtn) is routed through phosphatidylserine (PtdSer). PtdEtn can also be synthesized
  from ethanolamine (Etn) and DAG by the alternative CDP-ethanolamine (CDP-Etn) pathway.
  Elevation of all three phospholipids, PtdCho, SM, and PtdEtn, contributes to membrane
  biogenesis during B cell activation. Cho, choline; P-Cho, phosphocholine; CK, choline
  kinase; Etn, ethanolamine; P-Etn, phosphoethanolamine.
