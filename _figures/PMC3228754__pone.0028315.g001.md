caption: 'The pathway normally active in tobacco leaves and inflorescence, leading
  to flavonols and anthocyanin production, is indicated by solid arrows. Whereas dashed
  arrows indicate the minor pathway in tobacco that leads to flavan-3-ols (catechin
  and epicatechin) synthesis. Abbreviations: CHS, Chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone
  isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANR,
  anthocyanidin reductase.'
