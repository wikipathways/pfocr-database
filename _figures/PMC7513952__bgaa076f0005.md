caption: Ni displacing Fe in prolyl-hydroxylase and activating HIF signaling pathway.
  HIF can be hydroxylated by a class of prolyl-hydroxylase to be targeted for proteasomal
  degradation mediated by VHL. Ni can replace Fe from the enzyme and inhibit its activity,
  subsequently stabilizing HIF-1α and activating HIF signaling pathway. Fe, iron;
  Ni, nickel; VHL, von Hippel–Lindau. Figures are created with Biorender.com.
