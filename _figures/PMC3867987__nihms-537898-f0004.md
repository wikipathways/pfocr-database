caption: 'This figure of the pathway focuses on enzyme targets discussed in this review.
  The pathway divides into the cytoplasmic formation of Park’s nucleotide (see top
  and middle of figure) and then the formation of the membrane-bound decaprenyl diphosphate
  Mur pentapeptide followed by polymerization, cross-linking and trimming. The early
  enzymatic steps forming Park’s nucleotide appear to be fertile for drug targeting,
  but as discussed in the text, they have only yielded d-cycloserine, although new
  work continues. The phospho-N-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide translocase MraY is thought
  to be the target of capuramycin analogs currently undergoing preclinical development.
  The cross-linking event late in the pathway is the target for the β-lactams that
  are now receiving attention for use against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For further
  details on the formation of peptidoglycan, see [].DAP: Diaminopimelic acid; Glyc:
  Glycolate; PG: Peptidoglycan.'
