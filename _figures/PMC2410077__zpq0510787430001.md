caption: TPP biosynthetic pathway in C. reinhardtii. As in all organisms, TMP is generated
  from the condensation of 5-hydroxyethyl-4-methylthiazole phosphate and 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine
  pyrophosphate by the action of TMP synthase (THIE). In C. reinhardtii, THI4 catalyses
  the first committed step in the formation of the thiazole moiety from NAD+, glycine,
  and an unknown sulfur donor. The pyrimidine moiety is synthesized from aminoimidazole
  ribonucleotide, an intermediate in histidine and purine biosynthesis, via the action
  of THIC and THID. In C. reinhardtii, THID and THIE enzyme activities are found in
  a single, bifunctional enzyme. To generate the active cofactor, TPP, TMP is first
  dephosphorylated by an unknown phosphatase, and then subsequently pyrophosphorylated
  by thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK).
