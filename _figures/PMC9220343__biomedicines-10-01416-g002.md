caption: 'PARPi antitumor activity based on Synthetic Lethality. I: Normal cell. Excision
  repair base (ERB) and homologous recombination (HR) are functional: repair DNA maintaining
  cell viability. II, III: Through BRCA mutation or PARPi, one of the repair pathway’s
  is inhibited. Once the other pathway is functional, the cell maintains its viability.
  IV: Both DNA repair pathways are inhibited; therefore, errors in the DNA are not
  repaired, resulting in cell death.'
