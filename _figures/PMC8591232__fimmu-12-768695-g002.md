caption: Dendritic cells (DC) and tissue-resident macrophages secrete TNF-α, CXCL1/2,
  IL-1 α, and MCP-1 which recruit neutrophils. In turn, the neutrophils secrete CCL2
  which recruits DC and macrophages, effecting a positive feedback loop. DC and macrophages
  also secrete IL-23 which stimulates T cells like Th17, natural killer (NK) cells,
  and macrophages to produce IL-17A via STAT3 signaling in the Jak STAT pathway. IL-17A
  both recruits monocytes and neutrophils and induces G-CSF production in multiple
  cells types (monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, bone marrow,
  stromal cells, and astrocytes). G-CSF promotes neutrophil migration to the site
  of injury or infection via STAT3-mediated expression of CXCR2. Infiltrating neutrophils
  secrete IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ, which activate pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages
  through Jak STAT signaling. Created with BioRender.com.
