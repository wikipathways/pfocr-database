caption: Glucose enters the β cell via glucose transporter 2 (Glut2; also known as
  Slc2a2) and is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by the rate-limiting
  enzyme of glycolysis, Gck. Further metabolism of glucose increases the expression
  of Irs2, possibly through CREB phosphorylation at residue Ser133 as a result of
  increased cytosolic calcium levels generated via voltage-dependent calcium channels
  (VDCCs), the ER, and mitochondria. The calcium effect is likely mediated by calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinases (CaMKs). Calcium can also increase cAMP levels in β cells. Increased
  Irs2 activity can then activate a signalling cascade that leads to β cell replication
  (via FoxO1 nuclear exclusion) and β cell survival (via PKB/Akt). This pathway can
  be augmented by cAMP signaling through GLP1 receptors (Glp1r). The contributions
  of the insulin and Igf1 receptors (Insr and Igf1r, respectively) are likely to be
  permissive. P, phosphate group.
