caption: Working model to propose ABC-transporter mediated cholesterol efflux reduces
  the pro-inflammatory immune response that initially occurs from T. brucei infection.
  (Left panel) Functional ABCA1 and ABCG1 efflux cholesterol upon interaction with
  apoAI and HDL, which promotes lipid raft disruption. During T. brucei infection,
  ligands on the parasite surface bind to macrophage surface TLR4. However, TLR4 translocation
  to lipid rafts becomes minimized upon enhanced macrophage ABCA1/apoAI- and ABCG1/HDL-mediated
  cholesterol efflux. The reduced abundance of lipid rafts in macrophages attenuates
  activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway, weakening the host pro-inflammatory immune
  response that normally occurs in T. brucei infection. (Right panel) Impaired ABCA1/apoAI-
  and ABCG1/HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux in macrophages stabilizes lipid rafts
  within macrophages, enhancing TLR4 translocation and causing robust activation of
  the TLR4 signaling pathway in response to T. brucei ligands, which results in a
  strong host pro-inflammatory immune response
