caption: Schematic summarization of the regulatory roles of VqsA in QS circuits and
  virulence gene expression in V. alginolyticus. The pathways are illustrated with
  arrows (activation) or with bar-ended lines (repression) and are discussed in the
  text. The putative pathway indicating that VqsA might directly regulate the expression
  of some virulence-associated genes is depicted as dashed lines. sRNA, small RNA.
