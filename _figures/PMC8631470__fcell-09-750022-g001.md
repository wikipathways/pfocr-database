caption: 'Mechanisms of activation and inhibition of NK cell antitumor activity against
  tumor cell undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The expression
  of major activating (blue) and inhibitory (red) receptors by NK cells and their
  ligands on tumor cells determines antitumor activity (cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production).
  Tumor cells during EMT downregulate the expression of MHC class I and E-cadherin
  ligands for inhibitory receptors KIRDL (Killer cell immunoglobulin like receptors
  long cytoplasmic tail) and KLRG1 (Killer Cell Lectin Like Receptor G1), respectively,
  and upregulate MICA/B and CADM1 ligands for activating receptors NKG2D and CRTAM,
  respectively, that increases tumor cell susceptibility to NK cell activity. Increased
  expression of PCNA and galectin-3 ligands for NKp44 and NKp30 receptors, respectively,
  upregulation of immune checkpoint receptors (PD-1, TIM3, TIGIT) on NK cells and
  upregulation of PD-1 ligand (PDL-1) and TIM3 ligands (CECAM1, HMGB1) during EMT,
  have negative effect on NK cell function. Moreover, the expression of MUC-1 protein
  in tumor cells inhibits NK cell killing of EMT tumor cells via TNF related apoptosis
  inducing ligand (TRAIL) via inhibition of Bax dimerization. NK cells upregulate
  the expression of PD-1, TIM3, and TIGIT immune checkpoint receptors that alongside
  with matrix metalloproteinase ADAM17- induced CD16 receptor shedding in tumor microevent
  during EMT reduces NK cell activity. Structural motifs involved in activating signaling
  are green while inhibitory are red: Tyrosine-based motif (YINM) structural motifs
  and DNAX-activating protein (DAP10) are associated with NKG2D and induce NK cell
  activation. Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory (ITIM) structural motifs are
  associated with KIRDL, KLRG1, TIGIT, and NKp44 (when ligated to PCNA) receptors
  during NK cell inhibition. Inhibitory receptor KIRDL suppresses NK cell activity
  ITIM by recruiting protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-1). TIM-3 receptor inhibitory
  signaling is mediated through Tyrosine 256 (Ty256) structural motif that interacts
  with HLA-B-associated transcript 3 (BAT3). Fas-associated death domain (FADD) is
  transmits TRAIL and TRAIL receptor (TRAILR) signaling pathway that is during EMT
  inhibited by MUC-1 binding that prevents Bax dimerization and apoptosis of tumor
  cell.'
