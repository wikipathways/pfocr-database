caption: Proposed mechanism for NeB-mediated regulation of inflammation in LPS-stimulated
  RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. LPS increases ROS generation, which triggers activity
  in the NF-κB pathway to regulate the levels of iNOS and COX-2. During LPS-stimulated
  RAW 264.7 macrophage cell activation, pretreatment of NeB reduced the p65 subunit
  translocation into the nucleus and inhibited NO and PGE2 production, along with
  that of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. NeB also stimulated the nuclear translocation
  of Nrf2 to induce HO-1 to act as an antioxidant alongside SOD and catalase. NeB,
  nepetoidin B.
