caption: The proposed NPY signalling pathway for the regulation of blood pressure
  (BP) and heart rate (HR) in the NTS. Microinjection of the Y1 receptor antagonist
  BIBP 3226, the Gi/Go-protein inhibitor PTX, the PKC inhibitor GF109003X, the MEK
  inhibitor PD98059 or the eNOS selective inhibitor L-NIO into the NTS attenuated
  the cardiovascular responses to NPY in WKY rats. Our data suggested that central
  regulation of blood pressure by NPY is exerted through the Y1 receptor-PKC-ERK-RSK-eNOS-NO
  signalling axis.
