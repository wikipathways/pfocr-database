caption: (A) Overview of TGF-β signaling. The ligands belonging to the TGF-β superfamily
  bind to type II receptor, which interacts with and phosphorylates type I receptor.
  R-Smads are phosphorylated by activated receptors and Co-Smad form a dimer with
  p-R-Smad, which then translocates into the nucleus and associates with DNA-binding
  cofactors to initiate transcription of target genes. (B) In melanoma, TGF-β ligands
  or Nodal can activate TGF-β signaling through Smad 2/3 to induce invasion, progression,
  and metastasis, and also inhibit antitumor immune response. Nodal overexpression
  is often related to Lefty down-regulation.
