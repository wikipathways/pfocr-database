caption: The possible targets of Centella asiatica as neuroprotection in hypoxia-induced
  neuroinflammation – the pathophysiology of AD. We propose several targets for Centella
  asiatica (CA) which (1) suppresses the formation of Aβ plaques (2) inhibits or suppresses
  the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis (3) attenuates the effect of Aβ plaques
  formation towards the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress and
  neuroinflammation and (4) attenuates the activation of NF-κβ signalling pathway
  as well as enhances the activation of Nrf2 signalling pathway, resulting in neuroprotection.
