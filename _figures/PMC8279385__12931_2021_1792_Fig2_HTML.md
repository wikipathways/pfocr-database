caption: Cellular mechanism for SPMs in pulmonary disease. Specialized pro-resolving
  mediators (SPMs) contributed to the resolution of inflammation. These endogenous
  mediators involved in cytokines production, pathways regulation and inflammatory
  cell modulation, which can affect different pathophysiologic process of these pulmonary
  diseases. There is the major regulation pathway of SPMs in tuberculosis, asthma,
  COPD, cystic fibrosis and pneumonia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia
