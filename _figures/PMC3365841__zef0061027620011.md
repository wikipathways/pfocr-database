caption: Pituitary cells express GPCRs that engage the cAMP signaling pathway. Top
  left, A small number of neurohormones act through GPCRs coupled to Gs heterotrimeric
  proteins, and their α-subunit binds to AC, leading to stimulation of cAMP production.
  cAMP acts as an intracellular messenger by directly activating HCN and CNG channels,
  and indirectly through PKA. Binding of cAMP to PKA leads to dissociation of the
  catalytic (C) from regulatory (R) subunits. The messenger function of cAMP is terminated
  by PDEs and by efflux of cAMP mediated by cyclic nucleotide pumps (not shown). Top
  right, Coupling of several GPCRs to Gi/o and/or Gz provide an effective mechanism
  for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by their α-subunits. In addition to
  inhibition of the cAMP signaling pathway, these receptors also modulate electrical
  activity through βγ dimers acting on Kir and Cav channels (not shown).
