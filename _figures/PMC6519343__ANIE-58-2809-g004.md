caption: Biosynthetic route to limamycins and proposed pathway towards lugdunomycin.
  A) Biosynthesis of limamycins. Baeyer–Villiger oxidative cleavage at the quinone
  ring of compounds 2 and/or 6 is pivotal for the biosynthesis of lugdunomycin and
  rearranged limamycins 13–19. B) Proposed pathway for lugdunomycin biosynthesis.
  As possible final step for the assembly of lugdunomycin a Diels–Alder reaction is
  proposed. As dienophile for the Diels–Alder reaction an isomer of maleimycin (Supporting
  Information, Figure S6) is a likely candidate. We propose its formation from the
  oxidative ring contraction in the D‐ring of limamycins. The limamycin and emycin
  biosynthetic pathways are drawn in blue and red, respectively.
