caption: 'The TREM1, TLR and IL-1 signalling pathways are interconnected. Molecules
  in red were those found to be differentially abundant in the signatures of TB-IRIS
  patients at week 2 (normalization to median). Molecule activity prediction was performed
  using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis: molecules in orange were predicted to be upregulated
  and those in blue predicted to be downregulated.'
