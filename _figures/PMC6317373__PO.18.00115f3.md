caption: Molecular pathogenesis of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) and potential
  risk of prostate cancer associated with altered polyglutamine (polyQ) chain length
  in the androgen receptor (AR). The AR contains a C-terminal ligand-binding domain
  (LBD), a central DNA-binding domain (DBD) that attaches to androgen-responsive target
  genes, and an N-terminal domain (NTD) that influences transcription efficiency.
  The AR gene is composed of eight exons and is located on the X chromosome at q11-q12.
  Exon 1 of the AR gene contains a polymorphic sequence of CAG repeats, which usually
  varies in number up to 40 (normal), and encodes polyglutamine stretches of AR transactivation
  domain. Under normal conditions, the AR first interacts with its ligand dihydrotestosterone
  (DHT) and then migrates to the cell nucleus, where it interacts with specific DNA
  sequences inducing transcription of androgen target genes, including KLK3 (prostate-specific
  antigen [PSA]) and other genes. Polyglutamine AR (polyQ-AR) also migrates to the
  nucleus after binding with testosterone, and once it is in the nucleus, it can no
  longer interact properly with AR target genes. Alteration of this pathway results
  in abnormal transcription and protein production by several genes, which may therefore
  lose their physiologic function. At the same time, pathologic accumulations of mutated
  AR can induce toxicity and neurodegeneration. Damage to motor neurons can result
  both from cell-autonomous and non–cell-autonomous toxic processes, the latter arising
  in other cell types such as skeletal muscle cells. These cells are highly androgen
  sensitive and may alter several physiologic pathways after interactions with mutated
  polyQ-AR. Primary muscle dysfunction can modify motor neuron trophism, thereby participating
  in neurodegeneration. Thus, muscle dysfunction seems to result from both the primary
  muscle pathology and neurogenic atrophy, with the two mechanisms likely acting together
  to determine the disease phenotype. DDR, DNA defect repair; LH, luteinizing hormone;
  LHRH, LH-releasing hormone; LHRH-R, LHRH receptor; N, number of CAG repeats; NED,
  neuroendocrine differentiation; PolyQ-AR, polyglutamine AR; PSA, prostate specific
  antigen; 5α-R, 5α-reductase.
