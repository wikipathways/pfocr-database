caption: The “drug-molecule-target-pathway” network of SLBZP in treating IBS through
  the TNF signaling pathway. Note that the green diamond node is the traditional Chinese
  medicine, the green arrow node is the molecule, the circular node is the target
  protein, and the hexagonal node is the pathway. The yellow nodes are TNF proteins,
  related small molecules, and traditional Chinese medicine.
