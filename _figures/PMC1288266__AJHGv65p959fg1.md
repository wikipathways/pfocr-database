caption: 'The GH JAK-STAT intracellular signaling pathway. GH binds to dimerized GH
  receptors, and the receptors and associated JAK2 phosphotyrosine kinases are phosphorylated
  (*). Latent cytoplasmic STAT5 proteins are recruited to the receptor-JAK2 complex
  and are activated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylated STAT5 proteins homo- or heterodimerize
  and translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to target DNA sequences. Intracellular
  signaling is turned off by several mechanisms. These include: (1) dephosphorylation
  by phosphatases; (2) degradation by proteasomes; (3) cytokine induction of SOCS
  proteins that either bind to receptor or JAK proteins to block subsequent signaling
  or mediate interactions with elongins B and C; and (4) PIAS proteins that interact
  directly with specific STAT proteins (note that PIAS5 has yet to be identified).'
