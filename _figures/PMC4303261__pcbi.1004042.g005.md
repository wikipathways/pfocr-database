caption: 'In this network, diamonds represent miRNAs: sky-blue nodes for ovarian cancer
  miRNAs from the HMDD database, pink nodes for ovarian cancer miRNAs supported by
  the literature, and yellow nodes for the remaining miRNAs. Genes are represented
  by circles: pink nodes for ovarian cancer genes validated by the literature, green
  nodes for ovarian cancer genes validated by the DDOC database, orange nodes for
  cancer genes, and white nodes for the remaining genes. A blue solid line indicates
  that the MCC value between a gene and a miRNA is larger than 0.3. A purple line
  indicates that the linked genes are enriched together with at least one function.
  For example, COL6A1, COL5A3, THBS2, FN1, COL1A1, COL5A1, COLA1A, and COL3A1 are
  enriched with at least one function together (ECM receptor pathway or Focal adhesion
  pathway).  presents PubMed identifiers for ovarian cancer genes in pink nodes.'
