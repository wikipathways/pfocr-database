caption: Signaling pathways of B cell receptor (BCR). BCR contains a membrane‐bound
  immunoglobulin molecule (that attaches the antigen) and a heterodimer subunit consisted
  of Ig‐α and Ig‐β (signal transduction moiety) that has tyrosine kinase properties
  due to its ITAM motifs. After the activation of BCR, ITAM motifs are phosphorylated
  by tyrosine‐protein kinase Lyn, proto‐oncogene tyrosine‐protein kinase Fyn and tyrosine‐protein
  kinase SYK. Phosphorylation of CD79A and CD79B activates a set of kinases and adaptor
  proteins that ultimately triggers signaling pathways related to cell proliferation
  and differentiation, including NF‐κB. The miR‐150 and miR‐34a disrupt signal transduction
  from BCR and inhibit cell proliferation in CLL by negative regulation of FOXP1
