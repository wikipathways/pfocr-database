caption: 'The related pathway mechanism of pyroptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis
  in the occurrence and development of ALD. 1) In ALD, alcohol metabolism leads to
  the activation of ROS/TXNIP, ATP/P2X7, uric acid/lysosome, LPS/TLR/NF-κB and other
  pathways, activating the classical pathway of KCs cell pyroptosis, namely, NLRP3,
  pro-caspase-1 and ASC assemble to form inflammasomes, activate caspase-1, and then
  cleave GSDMD, leading to cell membrane perforation and release of IL-18 and IL-1β,
  ultimately leading to cell pyroptosis. In addition, LPS intestinal leakage caused
  by alcohol intake can also directly activate the non-classical pathway mediated
  by Caspase4/5/11 in KCs, thereby cleaving GSDMD to induce cell pyroptosis and aggravate
  liver damage. 2) Alcohol intake enhances TFR1 expression and Fe3+ absorption in
  hepatocytes and also reduces Fe³⁺ to Fe2⁺ through STEAP3, transports it to the free
  iron pool via ZIP8/14 and DMT1. Simultaneously, NCOA4 promotes ferritin degradation,
  further increasing intracellular free Fe2+. Excessive Fe2+ triggers lipid peroxidation
  through the Fenton reaction, thereby triggering ferroptosis. Alcohol also causes
  an imbalance in the concentrations of glutamate and cystine inside and outside the
  cell through the SLC3A2/SLC7A11 channel, leading to GSH depletion and GPX4 inactivation,
  leading to hepatocyte ferroptosis. In addition, miR-214 exacerbates alcohol-induced
  hepatocyte damage by activating ferroptosis-related genes. 3) Necroptosis is a programmed
  cell death method that depends on the RIPK1/RIPK3 and MLKL axis. In ALD, the liver
  produces a large amount of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, which bind to
  TNFR1 to activate RIPK1/RIPK3 and then phosphorylate MLKL. Subsequently, p-MLKL
  forms oligomers in the cytoplasm and transfers to the cell membrane to create pores,
  destroying membrane integrity, causing cell rupture and death and releasing DAMPs,
  exacerbating liver inflammatory response and fibrosis. Abbreviation: ALD, Alcohol-Related
