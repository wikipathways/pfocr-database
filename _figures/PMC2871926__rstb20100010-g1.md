caption: 'A model describing the movement of preleptotene spermatocytes across the
  BTB. (a) An electron micrograph showing part of the seminiferous epithelium from
  the adult rat testis. Depicted here are two adjacent Sertoli cells resting on the
  tunica propria which is composed of the basement membrane (bm), a layer of peritubular
  myoid cells (pmc) and the lymphatic endothelium (see asterisks). The BTB is typified
  by coexisting junctions, namely TJs, basal ES and D-GJs. Red arrowheads point to
  bundles of actin microfilaments sandwiched in between the Sertoli cell plasma membrane
  and the endoplasmic reticulum (er), and these are characteristic of the basal ES.
  (b) A schematic view of a cross section of the seminiferous epithelium at stage
  VII of the seminiferous epithelial cycle, showing germ cells (i.e. spermatogonium,
  preleptotene spermatocyte, pachytene spermatocyte, elongating spermatid and elongated
  spermatid) at different stages of development. The BTB, which is situated above
  a migrating preleptotene spermatocyte (see circles), divides the seminiferous epithelium
  into two compartments: a basal compartment and an adluminal compartment. Sertoli
  (SC), peritubular myoid and Leydig cells are also depicted. (c) A magnified view
  of the BTB at stage VII of the seminiferous epithelial cycle before a preleptotene
  spermatocyte transits across the BTB. Different proteins (see key) that constitute
  the BTB are shown, and these include TJ, basal ES and D-GJ proteins, some of which
  are phosphorylated. Testosterone synthesized by Leydig cells can upregulate several
  BTB constituent proteins. Thus, it plays an important role in maintaining barrier
  function. Desmosome junctions are linked to intermediate filaments through an adaptor
  such as desmoplakin but as it is not yet known if this protein localizes to the
  BTB, it is depicted as a dotted line open circle with question mark. As described
  in the text for viruses and cancer cells, TJ proteins may regulate germ cell cycle
  progression. (d) A schematic view of a cross section of the seminiferous epithelium
  at late stage VIII of the seminiferous epithelial cycle immediately following spermiation.
  Shown here is a leptotene spermatocyte within the intermediate compartment. (e)
  A magnified view of the intermediate compartment at late stage VIII of the seminiferous
  epithelial cycle. During the movement of preleptotene spermatocytes across the BTB,
  the following cellular events are likely to take place. De novo protein synthesis,
  as well as testosterone, are likely to facilitate the assembly of a ‘new’ Sertoli
  cell barrier below a migrating preleptotene spermatocyte. Protein phosphorylation
  may also play a critical role in this cellular event. Cytokines released by Sertoli
  and germ cells regulate BTB constituent proteins by activating proteases, which
  cleave proteins and/or by initiating endocytosis, which internalizes integral membrane
  proteins. Endocytosed integral membrane proteins may undergo proteolysis, and soluble
  fragments of proteins may be produced by ectodomain shedding. These soluble fragments
  may have functions that are different from their full-length counterparts. Nevertheless,
  in both cases, the ‘old’ BTB situated above a leptotene spermatocyte is breached,
  signalling to preleptotene spermatocytes that they may begin to cross the barrier.
  Concurrently, proteins that have been endocytosed but not destined for proteolysis
  may travel to the opposite pole of the leptotene spermatocyte by transcytosis as
  barrier integrity must be maintained during spermatogenesis. Recycling of endocytosed
  proteins is probably facilitated by Rab GTPases and other proteins of the endocytic
  pathway. Before arriving at their final destination (i.e. below a leptotene spermatocyte),
  it is also possible that endocytosed proteins are transiently inserted back into
  the Sertoli cell plasma membrane to form homotypic or heterotypic interactions with
  the migrating germ cell, thereby creating a ‘channel.’ These events contribute to
  assembly of a ‘new’ BTB.'
