caption: The interaction of the EGF and TGF-β pathways in the control of proliferation
  in breast cancer (see also ). In normal ECs these pathways are balanced so as to
  control growth, but in TECs increased secretion of TGF-β induces fibroblasts and
  myofibroblasts to secrete more EGF. This disrupts the proliferation-inhibition mechanism
  by partially blocking the TGF-β-Smad pathway and triggers proliferation.
