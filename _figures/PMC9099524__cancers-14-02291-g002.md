caption: 'Interrelation between the HIF pathway, inflammation, and cancer. (a) In
  ccRCC, VHL is inactive, leading to HIF-1α and HIF-2α accumulation. As a consequence,
  there is a decrease in antitumoral response due to low levels of HIF-1α, IFN, and
  CD8+ inactivated cells. (b) Inflammation- induced by COPD with the overexpression
  of HIF-1α leads to overactivation of KRAS signaling and cancer. (c) Viruses such
  as HBV also induce inflammation that synergizes with hypoxia as factors to induce
  cancer. (d) Correlation between the expression of TLR and nuclear HIF-1α was observed
  in early carcinogenesis of the pancreas. (e) IL-6, NF-κB, and IFN-α induce the overexpression
  of HIF-1α; indirectly, TNF-α and MCP1 also induce HIF-1α through the NF-κB/COX2
  axis. HIF-1α also induces the expression of COX2. (f) HIF-1α stimulates TAMs and
  tumoral cells to release IL-1β, which stimulates CAFs. Tumoral cells also secrete
  TGF-β. (g) HIF-1α induces and regulates the expression of CD39 and CD73 to obtain
  eADO. (h) Hypoxic tumoral cells release exosomes enriched with molecules, such as
  TGFβ-inducing M2 TAMs recruitment. Abbreviations: clear cell renal cell carcinoma,
  ccRCC; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD; hepatitis B virus, HBV; toll-like
  receptors, TLR; interleukin 1-beta, IL-1β; tumor necrosis factor-α, TNF-α; interferons,
  IFN; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, MCP1; extracellular adenosine, eADO. See
