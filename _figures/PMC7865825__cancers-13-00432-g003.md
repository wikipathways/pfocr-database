caption: 'Regulation of EMT by mitochondria.ROS: reactive oxygen species; PI3K: Phosphoinositide
  3-kinases; SNPH: syntaphilin; HIF: hypoxia inducible factor. Tumorigenesis calls
  for hypoxic-mediated reprogramming for metastasis. Bcl-2 family members regulate
  the PI3K pathway involved in metastasis progression. ROS generated during the metabolic
  process play a critical role in metastasis. Syntaphilin (SNPH), which generally
  arrests the mitochondrial trafficking in neurons, inhibits metastasis. In tumors
  with high expression of SNPH, mitochondria are anchored perinuclearly, resulting
  in lessened cell invasion and inhibited metastatic dissemination. In tumors with
  loss of SNPH expression, mitochondria are free to move to the cortical cytoskeleton
  via Kinesin/MIRO1 complexes. These cortical mitochondria fuel enhanced tumor cell
  invasion and correlate with poorer prognoses. Hypoxia can increase eNOS phosphorylation
  by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. HIF-1α can also directly influence the expression
  of eNOS, which can be activated by phosphorylation of the serine 1177 residue, thereby,
  triggering migration and angiogenesis.'
