caption: Network exploration options. Step 4 shows the example of a subnetwork for
  α-synuclein. On the right side, references with links to PubMed are displayed. The
  circles correspond to self-interactions. The weight of 8.0 and the circle in the
  graph correspond to the experimental confidence score of synuclein–synuclein interactions
  (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section). In Step 5, additional interactors of α-synuclein
  were loaded. The network can be exported in its current form in XGMML format through
  the button in the upper right corner. Detailed information on the compounds can
  be displayed in a new tab. At the bottom of the details page, pathways for different
  diseases are listed and can be viewed as shown here for Parkinson’s disease (enriched
  KEGG pathway). Yellow boxes indicate KEGG targets with drug info in SynSysNet. Mouse-over
  results in a tool-tip (pop-up) that contains detailed drug-target information.
