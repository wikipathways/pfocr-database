caption: a Schematic of the S1P/S1PR3/p38 MAPK signaling pathway involved in neuroinflammation.
  After LPS stimulation or spinal cord injury, resting microglia underwent M1 polarization
  and released proinflammatory mediators to induce neuronal apoptosis, which was improved
  by the specific inhibitors. b One of the Sphk1/S1P signaling pathways. S1P catalyzed
  by Sphk1 in the cytoplasm are transported outside the cell and bind to membrane
  receptors (S1PR3), then downstream activation of p38 MAPK phosphorylation and NF-κB
  nuclear transcription is triggered
