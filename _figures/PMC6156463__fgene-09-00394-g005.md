caption: The distinct metabolic pathways in cancer cells and their connection to epigenetic
  modifications. Cancer cells have increased glucose and glutamine uptake, leading
  to accelerated glycolysis and biomass accumulation. PI3K/AKT is activated by growth
  factors to regulate glycolysis and acetyl-CoA generation. AKT induces the expression
  of GLUT1 to increase glucose uptake and phosphorylates HK1 and PFK to enhance aerobic
  glycolysis. AKT phosphorylates ACLY to increase acetyl-CoA production. Increased
  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC)
  activity result in increased lactate export, attenuated TCA cycle and diversion
  of glycolysis to pentose phosphate pathway. ACLY, ACSS2 and PDC contribute to nuclear
  acetyl-CoA production and subsequent histone acetylation. Glycolysis is increased
  in cancer cells with NAD+ converted to NADH, leading to reduced NAD+/NADH ratio
  and downregulated activity of sirtuins, which results in histone hyperacetylation
  and dysregulation of gene expression. Serine and one-carbon metabolism is also accelerated
  in cancer cells to produce SAM, which is controlled by LKB-AMPK-mTOR pathway. α-KG
  is primarily produced by transamination of glutamate derived from glutamine in cancer
  cells. Mutations of IDH1/2 lead to accumulation of 2-HG, which increases histone
  methylation by inhibiting α-KG dependent enzymes. The potential targets for anti-cancer
  therapy were labeled in red color. ACSS2, acetyl-CoA synthetase short chain family
