caption: Many transcription factors and molecules downstream of TCR control CD127
  expression, either by inducing or inhibiting its transcription. In green; transcription
  factors inducing CD127 transcription. In red; transcription factors repressing CD127
  transcription. TCR signals can also induce formation of lipid rafts, which could
  recruit and concentrate IL-7R, thereby amplifying its downstream signaling pathway.
  It is still unclear if IL-7 signaling activates the PI3K signaling pathway in lymphoreplete
  hosts, but if it were to be true, Foxo1 and Foxp1 could finely regulate CD127 expression
  downstream of IL-7, allowing a limited IL-7 to support survival of a maximal number
  of T cells. Whether Gfi-1, GABPα or Ets-1 are are activated downstream of IL-7R
  or self-pMHC/TCR interactions is still not known, but Gfi-1 expression is induced
  downstream of strong TCR triggering [, , ].
