caption: Schematic representation correlating various factors such as light, eye,
  melanopsin, pineal gland, vitamin D, intestinal calcium, and gut microbiota to neuroinflammation
  and MS. (A) Adequate exposure to sunlight; (1) Long days and adequate exposure to
  sunlight suppresses the melatonin secretion and (2) leads to activation of melanopsin,
  generated by RGCs. (3) Activated melanopsin by sunlight sends an inhibitory signal
  to pineal gland to decreases the melatonin secretion. (Red numbered rectangle).
  (B) Inadequate exposure to sunlight; (1) Long nights and/or inadequate exposure
  to sunlight increase the level of melatonin (black arrow), (2) causes melanopsin
  inactivation and. (3) Promotion in level of inactivated melanopsin by darkness leads
  to sending a stimulatory signal to pineal gland to cause a further increase in melatonin
  levels. (4) On the other hand, darkness leads to Vitamin D deficiency. (5) Vitamin
  D deficiency causes injury to RGCs, (6) reducing melanopsin secretion (dashed black
  arrow). (7) Vitamin D deficiency also causes disruption in intestinal calcium absorption,
  which (8) leads to a reduction in smooth muscles of the intestine and subsequently
  gut stasis. (9) The latter increases gut permeability and LPS translocation toward
  the CNS. (10) LPS activates CD14/TLR4/MD2 complex which (11) increases the proinflammatory
  mediators in the brain such as TNF-α. (12) CD14 and TLR4 receptors in the pineal
  gland respond to LPS by (13) TNF secretion and (14) suppression of melatonin synthesis.
  (15) Eventually, secreted proinflammatory mediators and activated NF-kB pathway
  leads to neuroinflammation and possible demyelination at the long term. (Green numbered
  rectangle).
