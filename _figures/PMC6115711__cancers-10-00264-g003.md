caption: 'SUMOylation system and TGFβ-signaling interplay in the context of induction
  of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Six schematic models summarizing how
  the SUMO system and TGFβ pathway collaborate or antagonize each other in controlling
  transcriptional responses that are critical for EMT induction. Briefly, multiple
  components of the TGFβ signaling axis (in centre) as well as EMT-inducing transcription
  factors (EMT-TFs) can be targeted by the SUMO system with diverse consequences for
  EMT-related events. TGFβ signaling has also been shown to regulate the ability of
  the SUMO system in targeting such substrates. (1) TβRI as a target of the SUMO system:
  Lysine residues downstream of kinase domain of TβRI are targets of SUMOylation which
  can promote the receptor kinase activity and downstream signaling events including
  R-Smad phosphorylation and transcriptional activity []. (2) Smad4 is a target of
  SUMOylation: The SUMO system targets two Lysine residues in Smad4 for SUMOylation
  that may lead to diametrically opposite effect on TGFβ signaling depending on cell
  type and context [,,,]. (3) The SUMO system and Smad3: Studies have suggested that
  Smad3 is SUMOylated, which suppresses Smad3''s ability to mediate TGFβ signaling
  []. (4) The HECT-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase Smurf2 as a target of the SUMO pathway:
  Ubc9, promoted by PIAS3, targets specific lysine residues within Smurf2 for SUMOylation.
  SUMOylation promotes the ability of Smurf2 to reduce the protein abundance of TβRI.
  Overall, SUMOylation promotes the ability of Smurf2 to suppress TGFβ-Smad-induced
  EMT [,]. (5) The transcriptional coregulator SnoN and the SUMO system: Two distinct
  SUMO E3 ligases, PIAS1 and TIF1γ, promote the SUMOylation of both Lysine residues
  50 and 383 on SnoN. SUMOylation is critical for the ability of SnoN to suppress
  TGFβ-induced EMT. In order to induce EMT, TGFβ signaling suppresses SnoN SUMOylation
  at least in part by increasing the protein turnover of its SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1
  [,,]. (6) SUMOylation regulates the activity of several EMT inducing transcription
  factors: TGFβ-induced expression of Snail, Slug, and Zeb2 contribute significantly
  to EMT induction. Snail, Slug and Zeb2 are targets of the SUMO system. SUMOylation
  promotes the ability of Snail and Slug to induce EMT, while suppressing Zeb2 role
  in EMT progression [,,].'
