caption: 'Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in hypoxic signaling. Mitochondrial
  ROS generation contributes to cancer cell survival during hypoxia by a dual mechanism:
  first, by stabilizing HIF-1α through the inhibition of the oxygen-sensing enzymes
  prolylhydroxylase (PHD), which requires oxygen, 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG), and Fe2+,
  and second, by inducing NF-κB activation by using a noncanonic pathway involving
  the phosphorylation of IκB in tyrosine residues through activation of the c-Src
  tyrosine kinase.'
