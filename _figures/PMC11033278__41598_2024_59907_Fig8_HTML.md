caption: PPI interaction network. (A) Network of essential genes. The GeneMANIA website
  of (B) key genes predicts the network of interactions among genes with similar functions.
  A’s inter-structured network is gathered and exported from the STRING database,
  with a minimum interaction score of 0.150. The Gene MANIA website collects and exports
  the interconnected network structure of (B) black circles with white slashes represent
  the input key genes, while black circles represent predicted functionally similar
  genes without white slashes. Red lines indicate physical interactions between genes,
  purple connections represent co-expression relationships, yellow connections represent
  predicted connections, purple connections represent co-localization relationships
  between genes, and sky blue lines represent pathway-related relationships between
  genes. PPI, protein–protein interaction
