caption: Schematic overview of the canonical PI3K/AKT pathway with indication of key
  stimuli and central output functions. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is a versatile
  molecular module that converts external stimuli into downstream effector functions
  within the cell. Key trigger factors comprise metabolic cues (such as individual
  amino acids or insulin) as well as classical growth and survival factors (e.g. FGF,
  IGF, and others) that dock to cognate receptors on the plasma membrane and induce
  the conversion of phosphatidyl-inositol (4,5,)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidyl-inositol
  (3,4,5,)-trisphosphate (PIP3), which acts as second messenger in the pathway. This
  conversion is catalyzed by enzymes of the PI3 kinase (PI3K) family, which comprises
  several distinct subclasses and isoforms expressed in a tissue-selective, yet overlapping
  manner. PIP3 recruits and activates PDK1 at the plasma membrane, which in turn activates
  AKT, a Ser/Thr kinase also known as protein kinase B (PKB). AKT serves as a central
  relay factor in the pathway from which glucose metabolic, anti-apoptotic, cell-cycle
  stimulatory, and stemness-sustaining activities arise (here illustrated in different
  color codes, with further indication of selected downstream factors). One downstream
  scaffold of exceptional significance has been identified in mTORC1, a multi-factorial
  protein complex that chiefly regulates cellular protein synthesis via the phosphorylation
  of the translation co-regulator 4E-BP1 and the phosphorylation target of S6-kinase
  (S6K), the ribosomal small subunit component RPS6. The pathway is counter-balanced
  by PTEN, a phosphatase implicated in the turnover of PIP3. Further regulatory input
  is provided through crosstalk with related growth stimulatory modules such as MAP/ERK
  or PKA-signaling pathways that respond to other growth factors, cytokines, chemokines,
  or hormones. It is noteworthy that basic PI3K/AKT signaling is also maintained in
  the effective absence of external stimuli by related cellular relays (e.g., mTORC2)
  and auto-regulatory feedback mechanisms that warrant the expression of housekeeping
  factors under conditions of cellular dormancy or senescence. Finally, the PI3K/AKT
  axis also attains particular relevance in transformation and cancer, where hot spot
  mutations in the genes encoding for PTEN, PI3K, and AKT enforce constitutive forms
  of pathway activation with high prevalence.
