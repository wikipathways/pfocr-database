caption: The proposed mechanism of action of CB in ICC cells. CB treatment induces
  DNA damage and activates ATM and AKT. Activated ATM increases p-CHK2-T68 and p-p53-S15,
  which promotes the expression of FAS, DR4 and DR5 and triggers cell apoptosis. Activated
  AKT, meanwhile, promotes cell survival by activating mTOR and its downstream signaling
  pathway. However, the tumor cells underwent apoptosis after CB treatment due to
  the predominant activation of the ATM/CHK2/p53 apoptotic pathway.
