caption: 'Role of VEGF signaling in OSCC. VEGF is constitutively expressed in oral
  squamous cell carcinoma. Its secretion can be the result of the activation of different
  signaling pathways, which includes: (1) the production of hypoxia inducible and
  HIF-2α by low oxygen levels, (2) the activation of Stat3 by CCL4 (which is constitutively
  expressed in OSCC) and (3) the activation of COX2 by different inflammatory molecules
  (commonly overexpressed in OSCC) which activate the NF-kB pathway. The activation
  of these pathways leads to the transcription of all four variants of VEGF (A–D),
  which through the activation of VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2 and VEGF-3 on blood and lymphatic
  endothelial cells, induces angio- and lymphogenesis. Created with BioRender.com.'
