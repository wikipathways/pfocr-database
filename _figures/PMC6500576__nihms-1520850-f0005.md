caption: Binding of α-MSH to MC4R promotes receptor signal through Gs with activation
  of adenylate cyclase (AC) and increased generation of intracellular cAMP, followed
  by activation of PKA, EPAC, ERK1/2, CREB, and increased transcription of c-Fos as
  well as decreased AMPK activity. AgRP antagonizes these effects. The Gs signal induced
  by MC4R likely takes place in in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) to control energy
  expenditure. AgRP can also act a biased agonist to promote MC4R signal by Gi. MC4R
  can couple constitutively to both Gs and Gi, and AgRP blocks such signal, acting
  as an inverse agonist. MC4R in a complex with α-MSH also couples to Gq and induces
  activation of phospholipase C and increased intracellular cytosolic calcium. The
  Gq signal likely takes place in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus
  to control food intake. MC4R in a complex with α-MSH opens the Kir7.1 channel to
  induce depolarization of MC4R neurons in a G-protein independent manner. AgRP acts
  as a biased agonist by opening the Kir7.1 channel to induce hyperpolarization of
  MC4R neurons. References are in the main text.
