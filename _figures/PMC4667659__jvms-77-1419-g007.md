caption: Hypothesis concerning cystic follicle (CF) formation in the pig. Ovarian
  development and ovulation are mainly regulated by gonadotrophins via an endocrine
  pathway. Firstly, FSH stimulates expression of inhibin α and betaglycan in granulosa
  cells in the ovary, which increases the synthesis of estrogen through upregulation
  of 3β-HSD. Estrogen leads to LH-induced ovulation through increased expression of
  LH receptor (A). However, if synthesis of FSH is insufficient in the pituitary,
  ovulation could fail, and cystic follicles could form due to decreased expression
  of inhibin α and betaglycan (B).
