caption: Therapeutic strategies targeting the interplay between DDR and anti-tumor
  immunity in the setting of HR-deficient triple-negative breast cancer. DNA damage
  affects the balance between tumor progression and immune surveillance. Genomic stress
  induced by DNA-damaging treatments or by defects in DDR or MMR results in accumulation
  of chromosomal abnormalities, higher TMB, oncogene activation and tumorigenesis,
  as well as immune recognition, activation of immunostimulatory genes, and increased
  TILs including anti-tumor immune cells (CD8+ T cells, APCs, CD4+ T cells, and NK
  cells). Immunosuppressive immune cells such as CD4+ Tregs, MDSCs and M2 macrophages
  can also be increased. Targeting of SSB and DSB repair with inhibitors of DDR, including
  PARPi’s, in the setting of TNBC with BRCA or HR-related mutations (BRCAness/HRDness)
  can, in addition to inducing synthetic lethality, increase generation of cytosolic
  DNA fragments. This results in activation of the immunomodulatory cGAS/STING pathway
  that promotes anti-tumor immunity through activation of T and NK cells, neoantigen
  recognition, and increased PD-L1 expression via the JAK-STAT1/3-IRF1 pathway. Anti-tumor
  immunity can further contribute to tumor PD-L1 expression via IFN-γ-dependent activation
  of IRF1. Tumor and immune cell expressed PD-L1 subsequently suppresses PD-1+ cytotoxic
  anti-tumor immune cells via inhibitory binding. Thus, DNA-damage induced anti-tumor
  immune response is often overwhelmed by coexisting immunosuppressive factors, and
  the balance in favor of anti-tumor immune rejection can be mediated by ICIs such
  as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 mAbs. APC, antigen presenting cells; ICI, immune
  checkpoint inhibitor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor
  cells; MMR, mismatch repair; NK, natural killer; TIL, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte;
  TMB, tumor mutational burden; Treg, T regulatory cell.
