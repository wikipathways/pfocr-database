caption: 'The UPR signaling pathways. In eukaryotic cells, a large portion of the
  total proteome is synthesized within the ER. Newly synthesized proteins can then
  be transported to their final destination along the secretory pathway. Several physiological
  and pathological conditions can hamper normal protein folding within the ER, which
  in turn determines the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins and UPR activation.
  UPR is controlled by three transducers: IRE1, ATF6α, and PERK. In normal conditions,
  the luminal IRE1, ATF6α, and PERK regions are associated to and kept in the inactive
  state by the ER-resident chaperone BIP/GRP78. Upon ER stress, BIP/GRP78 dissociates
  and enables UPR activation. ATF6 is transported from the ER to the Golgi, where
  it undergoes proteolytic cleavage by S1P/S2P proteases. The cytosolic ATF6 fragment
  (active ATF6α) is ultimately translocated into the nucleus where it acts as a transcription
  factor of genes required for ERAD and modulates XBP1 transcription). ER stress also
  activates PERK, which phosphorylates eIF2α to attenuate protein translation. In
  parallel, preferential ATF4 translation drives the expression of ER chaperones and
  other genes controlling autophagy, redox control and nutrient metabolism. Under
  severe ER stress, the PERK–ATF4 pathway controls the proapoptotic genes, including
  CHOP, which leads to programmed cell death. Once activated, IRE1 operates the alternative
  splicing of XBP1. The active XBP1(s) up-regulates, among others, genes encoding
  for ER chaperones, ERAD components and proteins involved in the lipid biosynthesis
  pathways.'
