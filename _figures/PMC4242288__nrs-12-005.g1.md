caption: (A) Binding of the Hsp90, p23 and a preassembled complex of Hop, Hsp70 and
  Hsp40 assists a mature folding of the steroid receptor (SR). Cytoplasmic Bag-1 isoforms
  (Bag-1, -1M, -1S) control this process and mediate proteasomal degradation of misfolded
  SRs. Addition of Hsp90-dimers and p23 complete the assembled complex, termed the
  “foldosome” (B). Release of Hop, Hsp70 and Hsp40 and addition of any one of the
  TPR-containing cochaperones, for example FKBP51 (as shown here), further stabilize
  the SR in a high affinity form (C). After ligand binding FKBP51 is replaced by FKBP52,
  which mediates translocation to the nucleus via the microtubuli system (via dynein
  and dynamitin) in a molecular complex termed the “transportosome” (D). Within the
  nucleus FKBP52 is released and the receptor binds the response elements as an active
  dimer. Cochaperones, such as p23 and Bag-1L (that has been described to bind to
  chromatin prior to the nuclear entry of the receptor), enhance the activity of the
  SR most likely by stabilizing the active state of the receptor. The molecular chaperones
  Hsp90 and Hsp70 possibly also play a role in this process (E).
