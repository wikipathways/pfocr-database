caption: Statin-induced inhibition of the mevalonate pathway and structure of statins.
  (A) Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase significantly blocks the production of mevalonate,
  a necessary precursor for cholesterol synthesis. Mevalonate is the building block
  for a variety of other compounds. (B) Structural formulas of statins and HMG-CoA.
  The HMG-like moiety (in red) is conserved in all statins. The polar substituents
  responsible of pravastatin and rosuvastatin are colored in green.
