caption: Regulatory mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome in PF. The NLRP3 inflammasome,
  mainly consisting of NLRP3, ASC, and pro-caspase-1, is supplied with components
  by the NF-κB signaling pathway. This complex can be activated in various cell types,
  particularly macrophages and type II alveolar epithelial cells. Activation of the
  inflammasome causes caspase-1 activation, leading to the maturation and release
  of IL-1β/IL-18 and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis. A positive feedback loop between the
  NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB is established through IL-1β. ER stress, oxidative
  stress, autophagy, and metabolic changes such as glycolysis are all involved in
  regulating the levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome. TGF-β1 and NLRP3 inflammasome mutually
  enhance each other, collectively driving the progression of pulmonary fibrosis by
  promoting fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and subsequent ECM accumulation.
