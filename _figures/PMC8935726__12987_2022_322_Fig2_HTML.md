caption: Schematic illustration of GPCR-ADCY signaling pathways. Upon ligand binding
  to the GPCR, GDP on Gα subunit is replaced with GTP, triggering the dissociation
  of Gβγ from Gα. The dissociated Gα and Gβγ subunits interact with different effectors
  and signaling molecules. Gαs directly activates ADCY activity, converting ATP to
  cAMP, which activates PKA and EPAC. Gαi/o directly activates or inhibits ADCY activity
  depending on ADCY isoforms. In addition, Gαi/o can inhibit the stimulation of Gαs
  and Ca2+; and activate MAPK pathway and PLC. Gαq/11 indirectly participates in the
  regulation of ADCY via Ca2+ and PKC, which are generated via PLC-DAG/IP3 signaling
  pathway. PKC and Ca2+ can either activate or inhibit ADCY activity in an isoform-specific
  manner. Gα12/13 activates GEFs-RhoA signaling and does not seem to regulate ADCY
  activity. Gβγ activates or inhibits ADCY activity depending on its Gα partner and
  ADCY isoforms. Created with BioRender.com
