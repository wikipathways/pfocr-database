caption: Proposed role of Cx43 pathway and ATP in inflammatory activation of microglia
  in epilepsy. Under physiological conditions, Cx43 is phosphorylated and the channel
  is closed. Cx43 is dephosphorylated by a variety of protein kinases or protein phosphorylases
  in epilepsy. The change in Cx43 conformation leads to abnormal opening of the channels.
  The release of the intracellular ATP mediates the activation and differentiation
  of microglia into proinflammatory phenotypes, and mediates the process of neuroinflammatory
  response in epilepsy. Cx43, connexin 43; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin;
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate.
