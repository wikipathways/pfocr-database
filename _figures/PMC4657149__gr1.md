caption: Trafficking Route of APP, α-secretase, BACE1 and γ-secretase. Full length
  APP is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently transported through
  the Golgi, and trans-Golgi network (TGN) where APP undergoes post-translational
  modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation during maturation. Full
  length APP can be transported to the cell surface in TGN-derived secretory vesicles,
  where APP may be cleaved by α-secretase present within the plasma membrane to produce
  sAPPα, or re-internalized via clathrin mediated endocytosis. Typically elevated
  retention within the endosome leads to increased production of the toxic amyloid
  beta by the β-secretase, BACE1, which is localized to and optimally cleaves in the
  acidic conditions of the endosome. BACE1 cleaves APP into the sAPPβ and C99 fragments,
  and the C99 fragment is then cleaved again by the gamma secretase also present in
  the endosome, to produce the amyloid beta peptide that is known to aggregate and
  become neurotoxic. Subsequently, Aβ may be degraded in the lysosome, or participate
  in the secretory pathway, where Aβ will be released into the extracellular space.
  Another potential site of Aβ production, still under investigation, are the large
  dense core vesicles (LDCVs). APP, β- and γ-secretases have been localized to LDCVs.
  Initial formation of LDCVs occurs at the TGN; following neuropeptide synthesis in
  the cell body, condensation of LDCV contents and maturation is facilitated by chromogranin
  peptides that reside within the LDCVs. LDCVs may be released at the soma, or undergo
  anterograde transport to terminal regions where they may be released away from active
  zones ().
