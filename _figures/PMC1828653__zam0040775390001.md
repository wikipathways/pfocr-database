caption: (A) Organization of the carotenoid biosynthetic gene cluster of Pantoea ananatis.
  This cluster is composed of two transcriptional units; one is transcribed from PcrtE
  to crtE-crtX-crtY-crtI-crtB, and the other is PcrtZ-crtZ. (B) Carotenoid biosynthetic
  pathway. FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate; CrtE, GGPP synthase; CrtB, phytoene synthase; CrtI, phytoene desaturase;
  CrtY, lycopene cyclase; CrtZ, β-carotene hydroxylase; CrtX, zeaxanthin glucosyltransferase.
