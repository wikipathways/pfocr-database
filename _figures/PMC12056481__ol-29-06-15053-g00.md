caption: 'Ubiquitination processes. This system includes Ub, E1s, E2s, E3s, proteasome
  and DUBs. E1s utilize ATP hydrolysis to activate and recruit Ub molecules. Activated
  Ub binds to E2 by forming a thioester bond and interacts with E3. Finally, it covalently
  binds to the target protein mediated by E3. In addition, the ubiquitin linkage type
  determines the different fates and functions of target proteins: K63, K6, K27 and
  K33 are involved in numerous key biological processes, including signal transduction,
  DNA damage and mitochondrial homeostasis, while K48, K11 and K29 primarily participate
  substrate degradation by the 26s proteasome pathway. Ub, ubiquitin; ATP, adenosine
  triphosphate; DUBs, deubiquitinating enzymes'
