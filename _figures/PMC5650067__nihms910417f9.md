caption: The interaction of a muscarinic receptor agonist (acetylcholine; ACh) with
  M3 muscarinic receptors triggers downstream PKC-α activation which, in turn, activates
  Src and p38-α. Src interaction with EGFR stimulates signaling through the MEK/ERK1/2
  pathway. Activated p38-α and ERK1/2 coordinately induce MMP1 gene transcription
  and enhance MMP1 protein expression. Besides degrading interstitial collagen and
  facilitating cell invasion, the resulting augmented release of MMP1 into the colon
  cancer cell microenvironment may catalyze release of EGFR ligands and further enhance
  ERFR activation. These interactions between post-M3R signaling pathways potentiate
  MMP1 expression and release, and culminate in augmented cancer cell invasion, thereby
  providing potential rescue mechanisms in the event that only one post-M3R signal
  transduction pathway is blocked.
