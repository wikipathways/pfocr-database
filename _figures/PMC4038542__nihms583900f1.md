caption: Model of complement activation and effector functions. Activation of the
  complement cascade is initiated by either the classical, lectin, or alternative
  pathway, but all result in the effector functions of surface opsonization [C3b deposits
  on the pathogen (yellow) signaling engulfment by a phagocyte], leukocyte recruitment
  (C3a and C5a), and pathogen lysis by formation and insertion of the C5b-9 complex
  in membranes (MAC, membrane attack complex) [Permission obtained from Elsevier,
  ()].
