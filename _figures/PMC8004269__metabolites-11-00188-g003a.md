  used to substitute their hydrogenated counterparts in cell culture media are circled
  and the pathways they participate in are detailed. D4-ethanolamine traces the CDP-ethanolamine
  pathway (A); D9-choline can be used to trace the CDP-choline pathway (B). Notably,
  the supplementation of D9-choline can also give rise to D3-methionine, via betaine
  aldehyde and betaine [,,], as shown in panel (B). D3-methionine traces the PEMT
  pathway and can produce D3, D6, and D9 PC and LPC species (C). EK: ethanolamine
