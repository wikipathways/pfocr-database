caption: (A) SCFAs produced by gut microbiota enhance bone marrow production of dendritic
  cells and macrophages with increased phagocytic capacity but reduced ability to
  stimulate Th2 responses in the lung []. (B) Bacteria found in the airway have been
  associated with increased markers of Th17 inflammation [,,]. (C) Microbially derived
  metabolites may directly stimulate or inhibit [] Th2 development []. (D) Microbially
  derived SCFAs found in the healthy gut promote Treg differentiation [], whereas
  metabolites like DiHOME produced by asthmatic gut microbiota inhibit Treg proliferation
  []. (E) Viral respiratory tract infections are associated with increased risk for
  asthma and exacerbations []. (F) S. aureus colonizes the skin of AD patients depleted
  of antimicrobial peptides by allergic inflammation and carries virulence factors
  that influence the host immune system to sustain the inflamed state. S. aureus delta
  toxin, for example, acts on pathways not associated with immunoglobulin E to stimulate
  mast-cell degranulation near the site of colonization []. Investigating the precise
  mechanisms by which bacteria can worsen or mitigate asthma and allergic inflammation
  will offer novel probiotic candidates and biomarkers with therapeutic potential.
