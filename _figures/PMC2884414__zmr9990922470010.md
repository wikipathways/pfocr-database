caption: Pathway of trisporic acid synthesis in zygomycetes. In the (+) strains, 4-dihydromethyl
  is produced from β-carotene, secreted, and taken up by the (−) strains, where it
  is finally converted to trisporic acid. Trisporin and trisporol are produced in
  the (−) strains, exported, and then imported by the (+) strains and converted to
  trisporic acid.
