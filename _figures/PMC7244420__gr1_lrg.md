caption: The hypothetical cellular ‘COVID-19 inflammatory pathway” virus with the
  influx of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages results in the hyperproduction of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines. And “cytokine storm” occurs, weakened by the intensification
  of the immune system's inflammatory response. But it seems that ‘nicotinic anti-inflammatory
  pathway’ triggered by the α7 nAChR in immune cells during infection, bacterial components,
  or intracellular mediators trigger pro-inflammatory pathways that converge in the
  activation of the NF-kB, which will translocate into the nucleus and induce the
  transcriptional activation of a variety of inflammatory cytokines. Nicotine inhibits
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages by mechanism dependent
  on the α7nAChR.
