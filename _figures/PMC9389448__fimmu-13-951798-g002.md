caption: miRNA biogenesis via canonical and non-canonical pathways. In the canonical
  pathway, pri-miRNAs are turned into pre-miRNAs by the action of DGCR8 and Drosha
  within the nucleus. Intronic miRNAs can originate from host mRNA transcripts and
  processed into pre-miRNA by the spliceosome. Pre-miRNAs are exported into the cytoplasm
  through an exportin-5/RanGTP-dependent way, and are processed into mature miRNAs
  by Dicer with eventually RNA binding protein cofactors TRBP or PACT. In non-canonical
  pathways, shRNAs are cleaved by the DGCR8/Drosha complex and exported into the cytoplasm
  by exportin-1 before Dicer processing. Mature miRNAs bind to AGO proteins forming
  RISCs, which in turn silence or cleave mRNAs. Alternatively, miRNA-AGO complexes
  are exported out of the cell via vesicles (exosomes or microvesicles) or as vesicle-free
  complexes. miRNAs binding to HDLs are actively secreted. AGO-free miRNAs can be
  exported out of the cell as well. AGO, Argonaute; DGCR8, DiGeorge syndrome critical
