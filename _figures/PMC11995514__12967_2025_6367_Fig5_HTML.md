caption: 'The core mechanism of necroptosis and related kinases affect the signaling
  pathway. In necroptosis, the binding of TNFα to its receptor leads to the recruitment
  of multiple proteins via the intracellular tail of TNFR1, forming complex I. The
  IAP-mediated Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP1 (Lys63-Ub) is crucial for survival
  pathways. When CASP8 is inhibited, MLKL, RIPK1, and RIPK3 are recruited to form
  necrosomes through phosphorylation. The phosphorylation-mediated activation of MLKL,
  followed by MLKL-induced membrane pore formation, culminates in necroptosis. Further
  investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanisms and functions of RIPK3, MAPK,
  and JAK/STAT signaling pathways in the context of breast cancer treatment. (Red:
  Tyrosine kinase; Yellow: Serine-threonine kinases; Blue: Lipid kinase.)'
