caption: The roles of MHC-I region encoded E3 ubiquitin ligases in innate immunity.
  Multiple PRRs including TLRs, RLRs, NLRs and DNA sensors detect the invasion of
  pathogen and trigger downstream complex signaling pathways that culminate in the
  activation of transcription factor, IRF3 and NF-κB, resulting in the induction of
  type I IFNs and proinflammatory factors. Conversely, inflammatory cytokines, such
  as TNFα and IL-1β further active NF-κB signaling pathway. During these processes,
  E3 ubiquitin ligases catalyze diverse molecules including polyubiquitin, SUMO and
  Nedd8 to adaptors to ensure optimal activation or timely turned-off of signals.
  This figure has displayed the positive (green arrows) and negative (red lines) function
  of the MHC-I region encoded E3 ubiquitin ligases in PRR-mediated innate immune signaling
  pathways.
