caption: Schematic representation of corticosteroid-triggered multiple tentative rapidly
  influencing neuronal function. Corticosteroids are represented by red triangles.
  Nuclear GR (nGR) interact with caveolins [cf. []]; the interaction probably depends
  on posttranslational modifications of nGR to yield so-called membrane corticosteroid
  receptors (mCR). Alternatively, CS-initiated intracellular signaling cascades may
  result from corticosteroid binding to proteins embedded in the plasma membrane,
  e.g. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) [] which, upon activation, activate protein
  kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) in turn. Other evidence points to membrane-bound
  corticosteroid binding proteins that interact with members of the src family of
  kinases (SFK) to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and/or
  modulate the activity of other membrane-associated proteins, e.g. NMDA receptors
  and other ion channels with potential steroid binding sites [,,,]. Under basal conditions,
  nGR are tethered in the cytoplasm in the form of a protein complex that includes
  the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) which itself may directly interact with
  Src kinases and the MAPK kinase, MEK [cf. []]. Additionally, direct interactions
  between the nGR and Ras which may be functionally relevant have been described [].
  Finally, MAPK-mediated phsophorylation of nGR may influence the transcriptional
  activity of nGR []. Thus, corticosteroid actions at the plasma membrane can converge
  and prime or potentiate hormonal actions on gene transcription.
