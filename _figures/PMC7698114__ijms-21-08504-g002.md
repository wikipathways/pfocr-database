caption: Difference of two variants of CDK20. Generic CDK20 and cardiac CDK20 are
  the two isoforms of CDK20 with differences in tissue distributions, substrates,
  downstream targets, and biological functions. While generic CDK20 widely expresses
  in most tissues and acts as a cell cycle regulator to promote cell growth, cardiac
  CDK20 expresses predominantly in the heart, liver, and kidney, and promotes the
  cell survival pathway.
