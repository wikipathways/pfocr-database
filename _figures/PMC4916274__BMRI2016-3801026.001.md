caption: Autophagy and apoptosis in the early and late stage of IAV-SP mixed infection.
  In the figure, the orange arrows represent links of stimulation, whereas the green
  bars correspond to inhibitory links. (a) Autophagy and apoptosis seem to act as
  sequential events after IAV infection. NS1 plays a critical role in regulating IAV-induced
  autophagy and apoptosis. M2 is necessary for the formation of autophagosomes. The
  latter delays the development of apoptosis. PB1-F2 induces inflammatory response,
  which has a mutual promotion with apoptosis. PB1-F2 of PR8 can cause apoptosis of
  monocytes. Both apoptosis and inflammation contribute to secondary bacterial infection.
  Recognition of viral dsRNA by TLR of alveolar macrophages promotes IFN-γ production,
  which prevents macrophages from clearing bacteria (such as SP). (b) SP triggers
  autophagy by interacting with TLR4 and TLR2 through RIPI-P38 signaling and JNK signaling,
  respectively. By the interaction of SP and TLR2, M2 alveolar macrophages (M2 AM)
  polarized from monocytes help maintain the lung homeostasis. PLY stimulate autophagy
  through ROS hypergeneration and PI3K-I/Akt/mTOR pathway. In addition, SP causes
  IFN-γ increase, together with autophagy and the maintenance of lung homeostasis,
  which alleviates subsequent IAV infection.
