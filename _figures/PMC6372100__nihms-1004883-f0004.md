caption: Schematic representation of the effect of high salt and Angiotensin II (Ang
  II) on cardiac adiponectin signaling. (A) In normal conditions, it is known that
  adiponectin acts through the adiponectin receptor (AdipoR1) present on the cell
  surface to improve cardiac muscle survival, insulin sensitivity, and mitochondrial
  function. Our data suggest presence of AdipoR1 on the mitochondrial surface and
  imply a potential intracrine signaling for adiponectin via mitochondrial AdipoR1.
  (B) In conditions of high salt, both adiponectin and AdipoR1 expression are suppressed,
  which decreases cell survival, insulin sensitivity, and mitochondrial function,
  ultimately leading to cardiac dysfunction. (C) Treatment of cardiac cells with Ang
  II increases adiponection expression via Ang II Type 2 (AT2R)-mediated activation
  of the nitric oxide/cGMP/Protein Kinase G pathway (as shown in literature; ). (D)
  Co-treatement of cardiac cells in high salt with Ang II abolishes the suppressive
  effects of high salt on AdipoR1 expression (returning it to normal levels) while
  their effect on cardiac adiponectin needs to be studied. [Color online.]
