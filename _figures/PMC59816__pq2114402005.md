caption: A reaction scheme for the ET from tryptophan(s) in the hydrophobic cleft
  of the protein to the drug DM. The solid arrows represent the observed ET processes
  by photoactivation. The lighter dashed line represents the thermal reaction pathway
  involving a barrier crossing, a much slower process. The dashed arrow indicates
  the final charge recombination. (Inset) The elementary steps involved in the photoinitiated
  ET processes.
