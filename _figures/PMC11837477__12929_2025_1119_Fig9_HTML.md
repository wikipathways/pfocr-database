caption: 'The EGFR role in T cell regulation. A EGFR role in Tregs activity: AREG-EGFR
  binding leads to activation of MAPK signaling that enhances the suppressive activity
  of Treg cells. B–D EGFR role in T helper cells activity: B Following gastrointestinal
  helminth infection, activated EGFR in CD4+ helper T forms a complex with IL-33R,
  leading to IL-13 secretion and Th2 expression. C A similar pathway promotes the
  differentiation of Th9 cells. The binding of AREG-EGFR, boosted by IL-33 exposure,
  promotes the activation of EGFR signaling pathway, including the activation of HIF1α
  that binds IL9 promoter, resulting in IL-9 production and enhancement of Th9 cell
  differentiation. D The binding of HB-EGF to EGFR causes STAT5 expression, that leads
  to IL-2 production involved in the survival of CD4+ cells, at the expense of Th17
  cells differentiation. E Engineered CD8 + lymphocytes expressed EGFR in mice bearing
  B16-OVA (melanoma murine cell lines) and PM299L (hepatocarcinoma cell lines) tumors.
  Upon EGF ligands, CD8+ T cells respond better to EGFR signaling activation, producing
  more IFN-γ and leading to a delay in the tumor growth'
