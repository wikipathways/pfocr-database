caption: Canonical and non-canonical Wnt signalling. In canonical Wnt pathway, the
  binding of Wnt ligand and Frizzled (Fzd) receptor results in a loss of phosphorylation
  of β-catenin. β-catenin then migrates to the cell nucleus to trigger gene transcription.
  As for non-canonical JNK-DVL signalling, the reaction with the Frizzled receptor
  activates DVL, which then initiates the activity of Rho and Rac. As a result, JNK
  signalling is triggered. In calcium-dependent signalling, the reaction between the
  ligand and receptor is followed by the activation of the G-protein, then by elevation
  of intracellular Ca2+ levels [59]. Figure replicated from [59] under Creative Commons
