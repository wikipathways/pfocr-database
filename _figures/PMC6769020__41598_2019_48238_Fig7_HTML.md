caption: Proposed pathway for muscarinic targeting by i-Extract and promotion of dendrite
  growth. (A) Normal acetylcholine stimulation of dendritic outgrowth and memory.
  Acetylcholine (Ach) binds to M1 receptors in a stimulatory fashion. Downstream signaling
  upregulates KLK8 production. KLK8 cleaves L1CAM. Mature L1CAM drives preferential
  expression of MAP2c, which stimulates dendritic growth and normal memory. (B) Scopolamine
  disruption. Scopolamine inhibition of M1 receptor signaling disrupts dendritic health
  and memory through inhibition of KLK8 production. (C) i-Extract neuroprotection.
  i-Extract can exclude scopolamine, but beyond this, it stimulates activity of the
  M1 receptor in some fashion, either through acting agonistically on Ach binding
  or a more direct mechanism of i-E components. This stimulation then associates with
  increased expression of synaptic proteins like KLK8. KLK8 cleaves L1CAM, which enhances
  specific production of MAP2c, thus enhancing dendrite growth.
