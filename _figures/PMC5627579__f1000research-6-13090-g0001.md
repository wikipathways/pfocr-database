caption: ( A) Calcium reabsorption from the PT occurs primarily by a paracellular
  route, likely mediated by claudin-2 (CLDN2). This is dependent on transcellular
  sodium reabsorption, driven by the sodium proton exchanger (NHE3) and sodium potassium
  ATPases. The reabsorption of sodium generates an osmotic gradient for water reabsorption,
  which in turn drags other solutes (including calcium) in a process known as solvent
  drag (top junction). In the late PT, the calcium concentration gradient favours
  reabsorption (from apical to basolateral) as the majority of sodium and water reabsorption
  occurs in the early PT (bottom junction). The transcellular calcium reabsorption
  pathway, present in late PT, is illustrated as a dashed line. ( B) Parathyroid hormone
  (PTH) in the PT decreases calcium reabsorption by attenuating its driving force.
  PTH in both the tubular fluid and the blood binds its receptor (PTHR), which is
  expressed on both apical and basolateral membranes. This activates the downstream
  messengers protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC). Note that apical PTHR
  preferentially activates PKC. Both pathways inhibit NHE3 activity and reduce abundance,
  but only PKC inhibits Na +/K + ATPase activity. PTH also reduces tight-junction
  permeability in the PT and enhances active vitamin D 3synthesis. In contrast, fibroblast
  growth factor 23 (FGF23) reduces active vitamin D 3 levels.
