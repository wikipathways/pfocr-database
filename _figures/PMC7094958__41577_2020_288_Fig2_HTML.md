caption: a | Domain architecture of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors
  (RLRs) and mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS). The three members
  of the RLR family have a central helicase domain and form a subfamily of SF2 helicases.
  An additional RNA-binding fold, called the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD), is also
  found in all RLRs. RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5)
  contain two caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) in tandem orientation
  at their N termini. The signalling adaptor protein MAVS also has a CARD as well
  as a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TM). b | RLR signalling pathway. RIG-I and
  MDA5 are activated by immunostimulatory RNA, for example, viral RNAs. They then
  undergo conformational changes that expose and multimerize their CARDs (not shown
  for simplicity), which allows homotypic CARD–CARD interactions with MAVS. MAVS is
  anchored with its TM into mitochondria, mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs)
  and peroxisomes, and relays the signal to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IκB kinase-ε
  (IKKε). These in turn activate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7, which
  together with the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) induce the expression
  of type I interferons and other genes. c | RIG-I is shown in its active conformation,
  bound to an immunostimulatory RNA. The molecular features of RIG-I-stimulatory RNAs
  are also illustrated; please see text for details. B, nucleobase; IFNα/β, interferon-α/β;
  LGP2, laboratory of genetics and physiology 2; P, phosphate; PP, diphosphate; PPP,
  triphosphate; R, ribose.
