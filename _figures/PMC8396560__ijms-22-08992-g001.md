caption: Role of S1P/S1PRs in macrophages. S1PRs on macrophages can be activated by
  extracellular molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, or growth factors. Receptor
  activation transmits a signal for sphingomyelinase (SMase) and ceramidase (CDase)
  to sequentially breakdown sphingomyelin and ceramide, respectively, to generate
  sphingosine. Phosphorylation (p) of the latter by Sphk1 produces S1P, which induces
  intracellular signaling to activate kinase-mediated phosphorylation of SphK1. Translocation
  of S1P from the cytosol to the cell membrane also leads to phosphorylation of sphingosine
  to S1P. SphK1 is essential for the TNF signaling pathway for downstream molecule
  NF-κB activation. Akt signaling molecules are activated by S1P1 and S1P4 and signal
  for macrophage activity and survival such as MCP-1 and MIP-1α. G protein through
  Rac1 and RhoA activation plays a role in S1P1 and S1P3 as the regulators of macrophage
  migration and infiltration. To the contrary, the migration signals are inhibited
  by S1P2, by which NLRP3 becomes a considerable signal to shade the S1P2 blockade
  mechanism to inhibit the macrophage death signal, caspase-11. Meanwhile, S1P5 signal
  activation regulates monocytes migration activity together with CCR2. TGF- β signaling
  pathway through molecules downstream of Smad3, Akt, and mTOR Smad3 mediates HIF-1α
  stabilization, and expression thus activates targeting genes containing HRE.
