caption: 'Metabolic functions of the MRO in the CL3 clade. (A) Occurrence of homologs
  of metabolic enzymes potentially linked to the MRO in CL3 clade members and other
  selected metamonads. Details on the genesis of the figure are as stated in the  legend.
  (B) Partial reconstructions of MROs in three different representatives of the fornicate
  CL3 clade and relevant cytosolic reactions discussed in main text. The division
  of the schematically rendered MRO into three sectors reflects three subsets of inferred
  MRO-associated components differing in their distribution: shared by Iotanema spirale,
  Euthynema mutabile, and PCS-ghost (right); present only in the latter two (middle);
  present only in PCS-ghost (left). Protein factors mediating (catalyzing) the different
  reactions are shown in boxes at the respective reaction arrows. Fe-S clusters are
  indicated by asterisks at the proteins carrying them. Details of the Fe-S cluster
  assembly pathway could not be reconstructed with confidence and the scheme provided
  in the figure (including the specific role of Ind in the transfer of the clusters
  to HydA and PFO) must be treated as incomplete and speculative. The question mark
  at SHMT indicates the uncertainty regarding the actual reaction catalyzed by this
  enzyme in the PCS-ghost MRO (see main text). PFL and the respective reaction is
  rendered in green, as it is missing from I. spirale. Abbreviations: 5,10-CH2-THF,
  5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate; apo-HydA, HydA precursor lacking the H-cluster
  important for catalytic activity; ASCT, acetate: succinyl-CoA transferase; Fdx,
  [2Fe-2S]ferredoxin (reduced and oxidized form distinguished by the minus and plus
  sign in the superscript); HydA, [FeFe]-hydrogenase; HydEFG, hydrogenase maturases
  (separate proteins HydE, HydF, and HydG); MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase
  (subunits alpha and beta); PFL, pyruvate formate lyase; PFO, pyruvate:ferredoxin
  oxidoreductase; SCS, succinyl-CoA synthetase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase.'
