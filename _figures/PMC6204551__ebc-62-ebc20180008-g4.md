caption: (A) Simplified schematic of glycolysis and acronyms of participating enzymes.
  (B) A hypothesized glycolytic metabolon, where enzymes are interacting, shuttling
  the intermediates from an active site to another, while enzymatic domains are scaffolded
  on F-actin. Such a structure represents a classical metabolon which incorporates
  a full metabolic pathway. (C) Localization of the glycolytic metabolon in cells.
  The glycolytic metabolon has been identified close to plasma membrane of erythrocytes,
  in specialized organelles in trypanosomes (glycosome), close to mitochondria and
  on actin or tubulin filaments or formed under cellular stress in yeast. In addition,
  co-localization of glycolytic enzymes has been identified in HeLa cells, and during
  e.g. cancer cell metastasis, relocalization has been observed of glycolytic enzymes
  to aid cell motility. Finally, the glycolytic metabolon has been found to be localized
  close to synapses in the brain as a cluster of glycolytic enzymes (for details see
  text).
