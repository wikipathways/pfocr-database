caption: Model of TLR4 and chemokine receptor cross-talk. MIP-2 binding to CXCR2 induces
  PMN migration, as well as GRK2 and GRK5 expression, through PI3K-γ signaling. Increased
  GRK2 and GRK5 expression results in chemokine receptor internalization and desensitization,
  thereby negatively regulating PMN migration. Thus, PI3K-γ–activated signaling is
  postulated to be a feedback mechanism regulating PMN migration. Because persistent
  infection requires continued PMN infiltration, LPS acting through the TLR4 signaling
  pathway transcriptionally downregulates expression of GRK2 and GRK5 in response
  to MIP-2. This decreases chemokine receptor desensitization by preventing CXCR2
  internalization and thus augments PMN migration. MEK kinase is involved in mediating
  the cross-talk between TLR4 and chemokine receptors. Dashed lines indicate inhibitory
  signals. (The figure is adapted from []; and for it, J Fan acknowledges first publication
