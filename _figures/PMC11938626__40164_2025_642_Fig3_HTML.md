caption: Various oncogenic effects induced by the ER stress in the development and
  progression of HBV-related HCC. Misfolding or imbalanced production of three HBV
  envelope proteins leads to their accumulation in the ER, inducing ER stress, which
  then causes cell cycle progression, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis,
  DNA damage, genomic instability, and increased lipid synthesis through different
  signal pathways, ultimately causing the development of HBV-HCC. ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum
