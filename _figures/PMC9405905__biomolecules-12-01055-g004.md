caption: Potential therapeutic options for attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation
  in endometriosis. Elevated levels of TNF-a present in endometriosis activate the
  TNFR1-dependent signaling pathway which regulates the transcription of genes that
  prevent apoptosis and promote inflammation and cytokine production. Upregulation
  of this pathway leads to cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration
  in endometriosis in comparison to controls. Oxidative stress resulting in elevated
  ROS increases the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB leading to nuclear translocation
  of NF-kB which activates gene expression. Curcumin and vitamin D supplementation
  may inhibit the phosphorylation of IkB preventing NF-kB nuclear translocation and
  expression of downstream targets. Omega-3 PUFAs and Vitamin C have the potential
  for reducing the activity of transcription factor NF-kB. Adapted from “Intracellular
