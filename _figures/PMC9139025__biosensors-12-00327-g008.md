caption: 'Schematic representation of the mechanisms underlying sugar degradation
  and amino acids uptake/synthesis in E. coli at sufficiently large glucose concentrations
  (high x), which leads to peaks P1 and P2. Under such x-conditions, glucose is transported
  into the cell by the joint action of the EIIC-B and EIIA-P proteins, the main components
  of the sugar phosphotransferase system together with Hpr and EI (not shown in the
  figure for simplicity). The EIIA-P proteins transfer a phosphate group (acquired
  from phosphoenolpyruvate) to glucose, which enters the TCA cycle as acetyl-CoA after
  degradation in the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) or pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
  This leads to the production of the energy required to sustain light production
  in the emission modes 1 and 2 (P1 and P2 signals, respectively). Acetate from glucose
  breakdown is then expelled from the cell. As a result, unphosphorylated EIIA becomes
  more abundant, inhibits adenylate cyclase, and lowers cAMP levels, which does not
  allow for both the formation of the cAMP/Crp complex and the transcriptional activation
  of acetate and xylose operons. Light emission corresponding to the P1 peak is thus
  partly determined by the concentration of bioavailable amino acids. When there is
  a lack of amino acids, cells reallocate resources for the synthesis of amino acids,
  leading to the P2 peak. Abbreviations: PE-P, phosphoenolpyruvate; Glc-6P, Glucose
  6-phosphate; PPP, the pentose phosphate pathway; AcCoA, acetyl CoA; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; AC, adenylate cyclase; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; cAMP, cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate; A.A., amino acids.'
