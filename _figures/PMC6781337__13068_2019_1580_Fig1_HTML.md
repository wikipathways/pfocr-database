caption: Biosynthesis pathway for limonene production in plants and the yeast Y. lipolytica.

  with d- or l-limonene synthetase. IPP and DMAPP are converted to GPP in both plant
  and Y. lipolytica. a Biosynthesis pathway for limonene production in plants. Plants
  produce GPP via the methylerythritol phosphate pathway from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
