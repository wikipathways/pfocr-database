caption: Metabolic pathways as suggested from genomic features and proteomic analysis
  of cell lysates of cultures incubated in either glucose or sucrose. Green color
  indicates up-regulation in sucrose, while red color indicates down-regulation in
  sucrose. PPP = pentose phosphate pathway. Part of this figure is based on Di Xu
  et al. [].
