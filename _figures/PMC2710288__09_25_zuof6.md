caption: Proposed model for FAK-dependent mechanism for the effects of CD151. CD151,
  through formation of the CD151-integrin complex as a functional unit, activates
  signaling molecules. Overexpression of CD151 leads to the activation of FAK on Tyr397
  and Tyr925. Subsequently, activated FAK397 activates the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway,
  and more NO is produced. Alternately, activated FAK397 and FAK925 contribute to
  the activation of the MAPK pathway, and ERK and JNK both are phosphorylated and
  activated. In this process, p38MAPK may not be involved. Whether CD151 promotes
  angiogenesis through activation of MAPKs remains to be tested.
