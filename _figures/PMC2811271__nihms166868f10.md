caption: Schematic representation of the proposed hypothesis for Hcy-induced cerebrovascular
  remodeling in mouse brain endothelial cells. At pathologically high levels (100
  μM) of Hcy induces oxidative stress, in part, by decreasing TRX and increasing NOX-4
  expression levels, and decreasing NO bioavailability. This leads to activation of
  MMP-9 via ERK-1/2 signaling pathway and by partial inhibition of GABA-A receptor.
  This is confirmed by an effect of GABA-A receptor agonist, muscimol, which ameliorates
  Hcy-induced oxidative stress, NO production, and MMP-9 activity/expression, in part
  by dephosphorylation of ERK.
