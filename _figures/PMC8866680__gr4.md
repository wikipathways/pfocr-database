figtitle: Transcriptome-guided identification of a four-component system, SbrH1-R,
  that modulates milbemycin biosynthesis by influencing gene cluster expression, precursor
  supply, and antibiotic efflux

caption: Schematic view of alterations in the primary metabolism, in which SDEGs are
  involved, based on the transcriptome analysis of strains BC-101-4 and ΔsbrH1-R.
  Some reaction steps and primary metabolites are omitted for simplification. Precursors
  for milbemycin biosynthesis were in bold. Ph, Py, L, V, I, F and T represent the
  reaction steps involved in phenylalanine metabolism pathway, pyruvate metabolism
  pathway, leucine, valine and isoleucine catabolism pathway, fatty acid degradation
  pathway and TCA cycle, respectively. F5–F means the acyl-CoA (acetyl-CoA for even
  fatty acid or propionyl-CoA for odd fatty acid) generated after the final β-oxidation
  cycle.
