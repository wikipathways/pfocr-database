caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of cAMP inhibition of MAPK activity. Upon
  stimulation in lacrimal gland acini, both VIP and the cholinergic agonist acetylcholine
  are released from parasympathetic nerves, which bind to their receptors and stimulate
  secretion by increasing [Ca2+]i and activity of PKC. The VIP receptor activates
  adenylate cyclase (AC) through the G protein Gαs to increase intracellular [cAMP].
  cAMP, in turn, stimulates PKA activity, which leads to protein secretion. cAMP is
  quickly broken down to AMP by phosphodiesterase (PDE). After binding to their receptors,
  cholinergic agonists activate the tyrosine kinases Pyk2 and Src to stimulate the
  kinase cascade of Ras, Raf-1, MEK, and MAPK. EGF also activates this cascade in
  a similar manner. Activation of MAPK attenuates protein secretion. In addition to
  stimulating protein secretion, PKA inhibits Raf-1 activity, which, in turn, decreases
  the activity of MEK and MAPK, relieving the inhibition of secretion by MAPK and
  thereby potentiating secretion.
