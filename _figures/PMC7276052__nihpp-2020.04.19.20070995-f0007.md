caption: 'Main components of RAAS pathway active in small bowel (SB) Crohn’s disease
  (left) compared to non-IBD (right). We hypothesize that ACE2 downregulation in CD
  leads to low expression of SLC6A19 and hence, low tryptophan, tipping the balance
  towards an axis of inflammation and fibrosis. Restoration of ACE2 levels leads to
  homeostasis which can be disrupted by SARS-COV-2 virus uptake in COVID-19. This
  figure is adapted from prior literature on RAAS pathway (11,35,41,42). AT1R: Angiotensin
  1 receptor, MAS: MAS receptor.'
papertitle: Reduced expression of COVID-19 host receptor, ACE2 is associated with
  small bowel inflammation, more severe disease, and response to anti-TNF therapy
  in Crohn’s disease.
