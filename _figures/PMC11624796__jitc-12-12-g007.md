caption: Working model of the mechanism of TH9 cells’ lung tropism and their antitumor
  effects. TH9 cells upregulate TRAF6 expression to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway,
  which requires phosphorylation of IKKs and resulting in ITCH phosphorylation. Phosphorylation
  of ITCH by IKKs inhibits its E3 ligase activity, thereby attenuating CXCR4 degradation
  and ultimately resulting in its accumulation in TH9 cells. Therefore, TH9 cells
  preferentially accumulate in the lungs due to CXCL12 chemoattraction and exhibit
  lung tropism. In the setting of lung metastasis, transfusion of TH9 cells inhibits
  tumor progression by enhancing the number of CD8+ T cells and ameliorating the immunosuppressive
  microenvironment with decreased TAM and MDSC. IKK, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa
  B kinase; MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor cell; TAM, tumor-associated macrophage;
  TH, T helper; TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6
