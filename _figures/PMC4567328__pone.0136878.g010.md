caption: T44Bf induces chronic prometaphase arrest, associated to SAC permanent activation
  through a currently unknown mechanism. This is evidenced by Cyclin A downregulation,
  increased Cyclin B1 levels and condensed chromosomes visualization. This chronic
  arrest leads to an apoptotic response involving mitochondrial signaling pathway
  activation and up-regulation of ERK pathway, which is a requisite for T44Bf-induced
  cell death.
