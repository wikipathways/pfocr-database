caption: Main signaling pathways involving LSEC during liver regeneration. Crosstalk
  between hepatocytes and LSEC is crucial during regeneration. In a healthy liver,
  VEGF pathways induce a pro-regenerative state whereas after liver injury Notch and
  Akt pathways are activated leading to a pro-fibrotic phenotype. In addition, bone
  marrow cells (BM SPC) may be recruited by LSEC through VEGF/sdf-1 pathway and engraft
  in the liver.
