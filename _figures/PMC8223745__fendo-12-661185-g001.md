caption: The main mechanism of tubular damage in DKD. Diabetogenic stimuli including
  high-glucose, oxygen metabolic disorder, inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis result
  in a wide range of injured pathway such as MAPK, PKC signaling. High-mobility group
  box 1 (HMGB1), s100/calgranulins and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are
  danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate cell surface pattern
  recognition receptors (PRRs), induce signaling events to promote the development
  of inflammation in DKD. Another mechanism that also might contribute to tubular
  damage is the increased renal content of HIF1-α. Multiple effects on proximal tubule
  ultimately result in impaired reabsorption, inflammation and fibrosis, which contribute
  to tubule injury and therefore DKD.
