caption: 'Mechanisms of Treg suppression. (A) Disruption of metabolic pathways. The
  ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73, expressed on Tregs, result in the metabolism of ATP to
  AMP and in turn producing the immunoregulatory purine, adenosine. Tregs have also
  been found to express high levels of intracellular cAMP. This is transferred to
  T effector cells through gap junctions, which leads to the upregulation of ICER
  and in turn the inhibition of NFAT and Il-2 transcription leading to apoptosis by
  IL-2 deprivation. (B) Modulation of APC maturation and function. The interaction
  of CTLA-4 on Tregs with its ligand CD80/86 on APCs delivers a negative signal for
  T cell activation. CTLA-4’s mechanism of action is varied including the capture
  of its APC-expressed ligands and subsequent trans-endocytosis and also the upregulation
  of IDO and the generation of kynurenines. (C) Anti-inflammatory cytokine production.
  The secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-β, has
  been linked with inhibition of T cell activation in vivo. (D) Induction of apoptosis.
  Tregs have the capacity to directly induce apoptosis via granzyme A/B and perforin,
  TRAIL, the Fas/Fas-ligand pathway, the galectin-9/TIM-3 pathway, or the production
  of galectin-1. Abbreviations: APC, antigen presenting cell; AMP, adenosine monophosphate;
