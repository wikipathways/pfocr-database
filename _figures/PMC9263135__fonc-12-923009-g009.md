caption: Genome-wide interaction and pathway association of Sqstm1 in LIHC. (A) Known
  SQSTM1 protein physical interaction network, as analyzed in STRING databases. Co-expression,
  textmining, neighborhood, and gene fusion were excluded in the settings. (B) Physical
  interactors of SQSTM1 protein as identified in BioGRID with various databases from
  both high and low throughput assays. (C) The pathways that are deregulated in correlation
  with SQSTM1 in LIHC. The deregulation of individual genes is shown in red. The more
  frequently a given gene is deregulated, the deeper red is shown.
