caption: BMPs signal via the Smad-dependent pathway (canonical) or various non-Smad
  dependent pathways. In the canonical BMPs bind type I or type II receptors, forming
  a heterotetrameric complex. Receptor activation allows the phosphorylation of R-Smads
  (Smad1/5/8). Phosphorylated R-Smads associate with co-Smad (Smad 4). The complex
  translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Non-canonical pathways,
  including mitogen-actviated protein kinase, can also lead to regulation of gene
  expression (modified from (17)).
