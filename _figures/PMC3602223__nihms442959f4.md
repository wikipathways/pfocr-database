caption: 'Cells were treated with METi or control and phosphorylation/activation mapping
  by Reverse Phase Protein Microarray (RPMA) was obtained on three cell lines that
  comprised the top quartile of the highest HGF expression (U1242, U87, A172) and
  on four cell lines that comprised the bottom quartile of HGF expression (ONS-76,
  DAOY, GFM-10 and T98G). Statistically significant differences between the effects
  of c-MET inhibitor treatment (calculated as the difference between triplicate independent
  experiments of the treatment – control/untreated) were found for 5 biochemically
  interconnected ERK pathway-linked signaling proteins that are found downstream of
  c-MET: JAK (Y1022/Y1023) p=0.04; ERK 1,2 (T202/Y204) p=0.01; p53 (S15) p=0.06; ELK
  (S383) p=0.03; and RSK3 (T356/S360) p=0.05. The figure reveals the biochemically
  interlinked signature of differential treatment response in the context of high
  vs. low HGF production along with the RPMA data results as a histogram for each
  of the proteins.'
