caption: Evasion of the Pattern Recognition Receptor-Type I Interferon (PRR-IFN-I)
  Pathways by Coronaviruses (CoVs).A simplified schematic of the canonical IFN response
  after sensing RNA viruses. Viral nucleic acid is first recognized by PRRs (e.g.,
  retinoic acid-inducible gene I; RIG-I) that perpetuate signal transduction through
  an adaptor complex on the mitochondrial (mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein;
  MAVS) or endoplasmic reticulum (Stimulator of interferon genes; STING) membrane
  surface. Here, the PRR–adaptor interactions recruit kinases that converge into a
  large complex, leading to phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3/7 (IRF3/7)
  and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), transcription factors that enter the nucleus and
  transcribe IFN genes. Type-I and type-III IFNs then signal in an autocrine or paracrine
  manner through the Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)/signal transducer and activator of transcription
  1 and 2 (STAT1/2) pathway, culminating in antiviral IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) transcription.
  Listed here are SARS-CoV (CoV), SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), and MERS-CoV (M-CoV) IFN-I antagonists,
  which render these viruses resistant to IFN responses. IFN-III is also implicated
  in exhibiting potent antiviral effects in lung/intestinal tissues, but the underlying
  evasion strategies of this pathway for these viruses are currently unknown. SARS-CoV
  proteins are highlighted in blue, while functions of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV proteins
  are highlighted in red and green, respectively. ? denotes that a SARS-CoV-2 protein
  bound a member of that signaling pathway in [], but further work is necessary to
  confirm its immunological mechanism. SARS-CoV-2 proteins with * denotes functional
  conservation with SARS-CoV [, , , ,,, , , , , , , ]. Figure generated with BioRender.
