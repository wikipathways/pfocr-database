caption: 'The schematic diagram of cysteine metabolism. Cystine enters the cell via
  SLC7 A11 and is then converted to cysteine. Cysteine subsequently participates in
  the synthesis of GSH, which acts as an antioxidant within the cell and can react
  with GPX4. When cystine supply is insufficient, the transsulfuration pathway is
  activated. This pathway involves molecules such as SAH, SAM, and CBS, providing
  an alternative metabolic route for cysteine production in the cell. Hcy: Homocysteine,
  SAM: S-adenosyl-methionine, MET: Methionine, SAH: S-adenosyl-homocysteine, Ser:
  Serine, CTT: Cystathionine, CBS: Cystathionine β-synthase. The graphic was created
