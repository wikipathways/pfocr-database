caption: (I) Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) identify pathogen or danger-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs) triggering signal transduction through Toll.
  This forms an intracellular signaling scaffold consisting of MyD88, Tube, and Pelle,
  resulting in Cactus phosphorylation by Pelle. The subsequent degradation of Cactus
  allows Dif and Dorsal transcription factors to translocate into the nucleus, initiating
  immune effector transcription. (II) Production of AMPs from Toll signaling proceeds
  through a sequence of stages, starting with constitutive production before infection
  (A), induction upon parasite recognition (B), peak output (C), decay of transcript
  production, and finally resolution of the response (D). Dysfunction in negative
  regulators could potentially disturb signaling dynamics at any stage, leading to
  overproduction of immune effectors. Figure created with BioRender.com
