  oxide (NO), and polyamines (PAs) in salinity, hypoxia, and drought stresses in plants.
  A (1) Salinity causes cellular oxidative bursts and initiates the ET-ABA interaction
  and related signaling to induce stomatal closure. (2) Expression of salinity stress-induced
  genes results in the synthesis of osmolytes such as glycine betaine, sorbitol, and
  proline that maintain cellular ion homeostasis. (3) On the other hand, low ET level
  upregulates PA synthesis via CDPK-mediated signaling through SAMS, or unutilized
  SAM is diverted to PA synthesis. (4) A low level of ET is possibly ensured by the
  regulation of ET synthesizing enzyme ACS by NO through S-nitrosylation. (5) The
  PAs help directly in salinity stress mitigation by ROS scavenging or indirectly
  by promoting proline synthesis and maintaining cellular ion homeostasis. (6–7) To
  maintain cellular PA level, excess PAs are oxidized by polyamine oxidases (PAOs),
  generating H2O2 that induces NO synthesis through activation of NR/NOS enzymes.
  (8) NO also helps in re-functionalizing the organelles like mitochondria and chloroplast
  that exhibit reduced activities due to oxidative stress. (9) NO is also stored for
  rapid response as S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) (sequestered with reduced glutathione,
  GSH) and released instantly as and when required. (10) Excess GSNO is removed by
  GSNO reductase (GSNOR) whose level is finely regulated by in vitro ROS pool. Salicylhdroxamic
  acid (SHAM), an inhibitor of alternate oxidase (AOX), acts by blocking the uninhibited
  flow of electrons through AOX. SNP: NO donor. B (1) Hypoxia tolerance involves ET
  and NO as key regulating molecules. (2) Hypoxia induces oxidative burst through
  NADPH oxidase that activates ET synthesis. (3) It leads to enhanced gene expression
  related to hypoxia/anaerobic metabolism through ET-augmented stability of a hypoxia-specific
  group of transcription factors called ERFVII. (4) The ET-mediated NO depletion leads
  to the accumulation of ERFVII as ET provides stability to these proteins. Stabilized
  ERFVII moves to the nucleus where it helps in the upregulation of genes such as
  SAMS which participates in PA synthesis, and the hypoxia/anaerobic metabolism-related
  genes. (5) The presence of NO or O2 makes ERFVII unstable and induces its degradation
  by the N-degron pathway. (6–7) NO synthesis is also upregulated via activation of
  NR/NOS-like protein following PA synthesis, probably through H2O2 generated by PA
  oxidation mediated by PAOs. (8) NO acts as a key regulating molecule inhibiting
  enzymes involved in ET (ACO, ACS) and PA synthesis (SAMS) possibly through S-nitrosylation.
  (9) NO also augments hypoxia tolerance by enhancing the activity of PHYTOGLOBIN1
  (PGB1), which scavenges cellular NO that contributes to ERFVII destabilization.
  (10) Hypoxia is also regulated by induction of alternative oxidase (AOX), a terminal
  oxidase enzyme, present in mitochondria, associated with hypoxia tolerance by helping
  in NO generation. C (1) Drought stress induces NADPH oxidase-dependent oxidative
  burst, leading to membrane damage, lipid peroxidation, ion leakage, and osmotic
  changes. (2–3) In response to this, signaling molecules such as ABA and NO are synthesized
  but ET is found to be downregulated through S-nitrosylation of key ET synthesizing
  enzymes (ACS, ACO). (4–5) Synthesized ABA is imported into the cell via an ABA importer
  that causes regulation of various drought stress-related gene expressions (including
  PAs) and inhibition of the K+ channel that causes stomatal closure to prevent further
  loss of water. (6) Upregulated PAs synthesized in response to drought stress help
  in quenching ROS, preventing ion leakage, ameliorating membrane damages as well
  as lipid oxidation. (7,3) Increased PA synthesis during drought stress is mainly
  derived from the SAM pool as ET remains downregulated during drought stress. (8,2)
  Elevated level of PA is oxidized by polyamine oxidases (PAOs) generating H2O2 that
  further induces synthesis of NO through NR/NOS-like enzyme ensuring well-coordinated
  regulation among ET-NO-PAs. Abbreviations: ATE, Arg-tRNA transferase; PRT, Proteolysis;
