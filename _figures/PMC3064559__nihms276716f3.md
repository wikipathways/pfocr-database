caption: 'Interconnectivity of signaling pathways emanating from TLRs and TACI. DCs
  activate B cells by releasing BAFF, APRIL, and cytokines upon sensing microbial
  TLR ligands. Engagement of TACI by BAFF and/or APRIL triggers association of the
  adaptor MyD88 to a TACI highly conserved (THC) domain that activates NF-κB via IRAK-1,
  IRAK-4, TAK-1, and IKK-mediated degradation of IκB. Additional NF-κB activation
  involves binding of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 to a TRAF-binding site (TBS) in the
  cytoplasmic domain of TACI and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand (CAML),
  a transmembrane TACI-interacting protein. NF-κB initiates class switch recombination
  (CSR) by binding to κB motifs on AICDA and CH gene promoters. Engagement of TLRs
  by microbial ligands enhances CSR through a TIR-dependent pathway that shares MyD88
  with the TIR-independent pathway emanating from TACI. Further CSR-inducing signals
  are provided by cytokines via signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
  proteins that bind to γinterferon-activated site (GAS) motifs on AICDA and CH gene
  promoters. (Additional abbreviations used in figure: APRIL, a proliferation-inducing
