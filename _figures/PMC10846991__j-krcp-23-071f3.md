caption: (A) The classical pathway is activated by binding IL-6 with the membrane-bound
  IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R). This complex then establishes a connection with two Gp130
  molecules and starts the signaling process. (B) The trans-signaling pathway is induced
  by soluble form of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). sIL-6R binds to IL-6, which consequently
  activate Gp130. (C) Soluble form of Gp130 (sGp130), which is found naturally produced
  and is detected in the circulation, can interact with the IL-6/sIL-6R complex, acting
  as a specific inhibitor of the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway. Both classical and
  trans-signaling pathways activation leads to the downstream intracellular signal
  transduction.AKT, a serine/threonine protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; JAK, Janus kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; m-TOR,
  mammalian target of rapamycin; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; RAS, rat sarcoma; RAF, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma; STAT, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription
