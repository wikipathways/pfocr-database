caption: 'Paraquat hijacks the PPP to induce oxidative stress and cell death. Our
  results demonstrate that paraquat induces an increase in the PPP (highlighted in
  green), which is reflected by an increase in glucose uptake, and in glucose-6-phosphate,
  glucono-1,5-lactone, erythrose-4-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate content (red
  arrows). In addition, paraquat decreases glycolysis as demonstrated by a decrease
  in 3-phosphoglycerate, alanine, and lactate levels (green arrows). These metabolic
  changes were also paralleled by (1) an increase in G6PD (the rate-limiting enzyme
  in the PPP), and the expression levels of citrate synthase and pyruvate kinases
  M1/M2 and (2) a decrease in lactate dehydrogenase A/B chains, which participate
  in glycolysis and the TCA cycle (highlighted in orange). Paraquat also induced an
  increase in citrate accumulation, which is associated with the well-known inhibitory
  effect on aconitase (highlighted in orange). An abnormal increase in citrate levels
  has been reported to exert an inhibitory effect on glycolysis by allosteric inhibition
  of PFK (broken red line), which explains why an increase glucose uptake and impaired
  TCA cycle is not translated to an upregulation in glycolysis. Paraquat also induced
  a decrease in total GSH and glutamate content. Modulation of G6PD levels and activity
  was directly linked to paraquat toxicity and oxidative stress (highlighted in green).
  These results demonstrate a role for PPP and G6PD in paraquat induced toxicity.
