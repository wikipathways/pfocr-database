caption: A schematic diagram of Notch, InR/Akt, and JNK signaling pathways. The InR/PI3K/Akt
  and JNK signal transduction pathways regulate transcription by affecting the specific
  phosphorylation status of dFOXO where the d14-3-3 protein is required for dFOXO
  to shuttle into the nucleus. Alternatively, the dFOXO protein can shuttle into the
  nucleus independently of d14-3-3 downstream of the JNK pathway via phosphorylation
  of an alternative site by Bsk (JNK). The Notch receptor is activated upon Delta
  binding and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is cleaved. The NICD translocates
  into the nucleus to regulate the expression of the E(spl) gene complex. Oxidative
  stress activates the JNK pathway. The assembly of corepressor or coactivator proteins
  with Su(H) affects the expression of the E(spl) gene complex.

    The InR/PI3K/Akt and JNK signal transduction pathways regulate transcription by

    The NICD translocates into the nucleus to regulate the expression of the E(spl)
    gene complex. Oxidative stress activates the JNK pathway. The assembly of corepressor
    or coactivator proteins with Su(H) affects the expression of the E(spl) gene complex.
