caption: The microcirculation disturbance mechanism related to the foundation of Con
  A-induced AIH mouse model. Con A first caused a significant decrease in blood flow
  in the hepatic sinusoid after being administrated. Thereafter, abnormally activated
  T cells immediately produce a large amount of IFN-γ and TNF-α, and then the STAT1
  signaling pathway is activated to promote the SECs and KCs to synergistically express
  tissue factor (TF). TF facilitated the fibrinogen agglutinating into fibrin clots
  as a type of starting factor of coagulation reaction. TNF-α triggered the production
  of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 to inhibit the anticoagulant pathway by
  suppressing the degradation of fibrin clots into fibrinogen degradation product.
  SECs and KCs could also express TF after adhering to Con A directly. All of them
  worked together to result in hypercoagulation and form numerous microthrombi, which
  would eventually contribute to the necrosis of hepatocytes. The anti-clotting agent,
  such as heparin, has significant protective effects on the hepatic injury induced
  by lectin through inhibiting the clotting activity.
