caption: The integration of Psat1 into glycolysis and the serine biosynthetic pathway
  and its contribution to additional signaling mechanisms. Glycolysis converts glucose
  to lactate via 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG), phospho-enol-pyruvate
  (PEP), and pyruvate. De novo serine biosynthesis from 3PG to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate
  (3PHP) to 3-phosphoserine (3P-Ser) to serine via the enzymes phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase
  (PHGDH), phosphoserine aminotransferase (Psat1), and phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH).
  α-Ketoglutarate (αKG) is converted to glutamate, and glutamine synthase 2 converts
  it to glutamine. αKG is required for demethylases and ten eleven translocation (TET),
  a methylcytosine dioxygenase. αKG also contributes to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle in the mitochondrion. PSAT1 is known to be regulated by the transcription
  factor ATF4 via input from mTORC1, eIFα, and NRF2 (He et al. 2023). It is not known
  whether this pathway is active in activated muscle stem cells. The green-shaded
  rectangle shows the pathway identified by Ciuffoli et al. (2024) as contributing
  to muscle stem cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. (Figure created with
