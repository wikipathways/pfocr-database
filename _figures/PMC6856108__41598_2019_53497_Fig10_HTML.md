caption: A schematic representation of the positive role of TmDorX2(downstream of
  Toll pathway) in controlling antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression in the fat body
  (A), hemocytes (B)¸ gut (C), and Malpighian Tubules (D) of young larvae infected
  with E. coli, S. aureus, and C. albicans. In the fat body, 6 AMP-encoding genes
  are regulated by TmDorX2 upon fungal and bacterial infections (A). TmDorX2 affects
  the expression of TmTenecin-1, TmAttacin-1a, -1b, and -2, TmDefensin-1, and TmColeoptericin-2
  in hemocytes in response to E. coli, S. aureus, and C. albicans infection. In the
  gut, 9 AMPs are downregulated in TmDorX2-silenced larvae, suggesting that TmDorX2
  positively controls the induction of these genes (C). In the Malpighian Tubules,
  only 2 AMP-encoding genes, namely TmDefensin-2 and TmColeoptericin-1 are regulated
  by the Dorsal in T. molitor after microbial infection (D).
