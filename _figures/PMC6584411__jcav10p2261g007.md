caption: Mechanism diagram. SNORA71A was located at 20q11.23 and encoded from the
  third intron of SNHG17 under both endonucleases and exonucleases. In our study,
  knockdown of SNORA71A decreased the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK1/2. Knockdown
  of SNORA71A induced G1 phase arrest and suppressed proliferation of both A549 and
  PC9 cells. In addition, knockdown of SNORA71A decreased MMP2 and MMP9 levels and
  suppressed EMT, then inhibited cell invasion and migration. Furthermore, knockdown
  of SNORA71A suppressed xenograft tumor growth in mice.
