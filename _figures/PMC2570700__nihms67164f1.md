caption: After EGF binds to its receptor, conformational changes induce the activity
  of the Tyrosine Kinase domain (TK). This signal is amplified through the PI3K and
  RAS pathways leading to proliferation of cancer cells and the transcription of signals
  that favor the aggressiveness, survival and invasiveness. Cetuximab and Matuzumab
  prevent the binding of EGFR to their ligands. Gefitinib and Erlotinib inhibit the
  activity of the Tyrosine Kinase Domain. When VEGF binds to its receptor it also
  induces the formation of a dimer that triggers the activity of the Tyrosine Kinase
  domain. Through the RAS pathway VEGF increases the proliferation of endothelial
  cells. Bevacizumab prevents the binding of VEGF to its receptor. Valatinib and Sorafenib
  are inhibitors of the TK domain of the VEGF receptor. Vandetanib inhibits the TK
  domain in both VEGF and EGF receptors.
