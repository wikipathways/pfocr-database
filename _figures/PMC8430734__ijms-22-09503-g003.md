caption: Physiological and pathophysiological roles of astrocytic Cx43 hemichannels
  and Panx1 channels in the CNS. The top left panel represents a healthy astrocyte
  (in green) under physiological conditions. In this context, the physiological release
  of gliotransmitters (glutamate, D-serine, and ATP) via astrocytic Cx43 hemichannels
  and Panx1 channels, along with [Ca2+]i and purinergic receptor signaling, contributes
  to diverse biological brain processes (bottom left panel), including synaptic plasticity
  [,,,], neuronal oscillations [], food intake [], astroglial migration [], fear memory
  consolidation [], and behavior []. The top right panel shows a reactive astrocyte
  (in gray) in a pathophysiological scenario. Here, reactive astrogliosis depicted
  by hypertrophy of cellular processes is accompanied by persistent and exacerbated
  opening of Cx43 hemichannels and Panx1 channels in astrocytes (bottom right panel).
  The latter likely leads to cellular damage and dysfunction by different mechanisms.
  For example, Ca2+ influx via Cx43 hemichannels might activate phospholipase A2 and
  subsequently elicit the production of arachidonic acid and stimulation of the cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase
  pathway. This response could then increase levels of free radicals, lipid peroxidation,
  and plasma membrane damage. In addition, Na+ and Cl− entry via Cx43 hemichannels/Panx1
  channels could trigger cellular swelling due to a boosted influx of H2O via aquaporins.
  At the other end, the massive release of gliotransmitters via astrocytic Cx43 hemichannels
  and Panx1 channels might reduce the viability and function of healthy neighboring
  neurons. Indeed, a substantial body of evidence indicates that these channels contribute
  to the development of multiple CNS disorders and diseases, including Alzheimer’s
  disease [,], epilepsy [,], meningitis [], Parkinson’ disease [], HIV-induced dementia
  [,], stroke [,], intracerebral hemorrhage [], and spinal cord injury [,]. Solid
  lines depict fluxes of molecules through channels, whereas dashed lines indicate
  activation or induction.
