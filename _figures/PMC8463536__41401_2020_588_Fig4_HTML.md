caption: TIGAR functions as a Fru-2,6-BPase to reduce the level of Fru-2,6-P2 and
  inhibit the activity of PFK-1. Therefore, TIGAR can inhibit glycolysis and promote
  the pentose phosphate pathway and nucleotide synthesis. However, TIGAR has a stronger
  catalytic activity for 2,3-BPG. 1,3-BPG 1,3-diphosphoglycerate, 2,3-BPG 2,3-diphosphoglycerate,
