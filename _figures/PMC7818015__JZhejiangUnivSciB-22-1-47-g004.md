caption: .  AlkB homolog 3 (ALKBH3)-dependent repair pathway. (a) Recruitment of ALKBH3
  by transcription machinery. When the alkylation lesion is buried in double-stranded
  DNA (dsDNA), it may require transcription machinery to recognize and initiate the
  repair. RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol-II) will pause at the alkylated lesion, allowing
  really interesting new gene finger protein 113A (RNF113A) to ubiquitinate several
  proteins in the transcription complex. This ubiquitination chain can subsequently
  recruit the activating signal co-integrator complex (ASCC) complex. Finally, the
  ASCC complex unwinds the DNA and guides ALKBH3 to repair the lesion. (b) Recruitment
  of ALKBH3 to 3'-tailed DNA. If the alkylation lesion presents adjacent to double-strand
  break (DSB), it will first allow the end resection to generate the 3'-tailed DNA.
  Subsequently, DNA repair protein RAD51 homolog C (RAD51C) binds the 3'-tailed DNA
  and guides ALKBH3 to repair the lesion. .
