caption: Type I collagen supramolecular assembly pathway. The standard fibrillar collagen
  molecule is characterized by N- and C-terminal propeptide sequences, which flank
  a series of Gly-X-Y repeats (where X and Y represent any amino acids but are frequently
  proline and hydroxyproline). These form the central triple helical structure of
  procollagen and collagen. Three precursor α-chains (two α1 and one α2) are co-translationally
  translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, where specific post-translational
  modifications occur. Three collagen α-chains associate specifically via their C-terminal
  domains to form heterotrimers. The helical collagens are trafficked via the Golgi
  network to the plasma membrane, and secreted into the extracellular space as precursor
  forms, called procollagens, with N- and C-terminal non-collagenous domains. These
  domains are removed by the action of specific proteases, and the collagens are assembled
  into dense fibrils with a characteristic D-periodicity of about 67 nm (A). The fibril
  is stabilized by covalent lysine- and hydroxylysine-derived crosslinks. In addition
  to fibrillar collagen, other collagens, such as type V and FACIT collagens, are
  incorporated into the fibril structure (B). Type V collagen is inserted between
  strands of the microfibril, and FACIT collagens cling to the surface of the microfibril
  and work to stabilize higher order structures. Adapted from ().
