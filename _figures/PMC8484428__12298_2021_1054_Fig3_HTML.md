caption: Conserved genes assigned to the MAPK signaling pathway. This figure wasadapted
  from the MAPK signaling pathway in the KEGG pathway. The gene expression levels
  in P. × euramericana (Pe) and P. simonii (Ps) of each time point during AR formation
  are shown in different columns in the colored grids, and the different rows represent
  the different genes. The colors indicate the levels of gene expression with red
  representing upregulation and blue representing downregulation. The gene expression
  levels of Pe and Ps during the different time points were normalized to 0 days after
  excision (DAE0) of the corresponding poplar species
