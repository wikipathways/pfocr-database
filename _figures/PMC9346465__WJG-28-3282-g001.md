caption: 'Hepatitis B virus life cycle. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) enters hepatocytes
  via interaction with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), followed by the sodium
  taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) receptor. The virus envelope and
  the hepatocytes’ membrane merge, releasing the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm.
  The viral genome is transferred to the nucleus after the capsid is removed. The
  relaxed circular genome is restored in the nucleus, resulting in covalently closed
  circular DNA (cccDNA), and viral DNA could be integrated into the host DNA. Integrated
  viral DNA is a constant source of hepatitis B surface antigen (dashed line). The
  cccDNA is a template for pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) production and the transcription
  of all viral mRNAs. In addition, the cccDNA is associated with host factors and
  cellular histones, and forms a minichromosome. The core proteins are constructed
  into nucleocapsids together with pgRNA. Viral polymerase converts the pgRNA to relax
  circular DNA, resulting in a mature nucleocapsid. The core particles can recycle
  and replenish cccDNA (dashed line), or gather with the envelope proteins in the
  endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, and enter the secretory pathway. Through the secretory
  process, virions gain surface antigens and are secreted as infectious virions-Dane
  particles. Also, incomplete subviral particles are secreted, such as spheres and
  filaments lacking nucleocapsid proteins. HSP: Heparan sulfate proteoglycan; NTCP:
  Sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide receptor; cccDNA: Covalently closed
  circular DNA; pgRNA: Pregenomic RNA; HBx: Hepatitis B protein X; HBsAg: Hepatitis
  B surface antigen; HBe: E antigen; ER: Endoplasmatic reticulum.'
