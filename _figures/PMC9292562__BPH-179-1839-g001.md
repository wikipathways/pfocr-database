caption: 'Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism alters the development
  of autoimmune diseases. (a) Therapeutic strategies to modulate NAD+ levels in experimental
  autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is
  characterised by immune cell infiltration, axonal degeneration and demyelination.
  Strategies aiming to increase NAD+ levels (i.e., CD38 knock‐outs or supplementation
  with NAD+ precursors) ameliorate EAE severity by different mechanisms: Inhibiting
  inflammasome assembly and increasing autophagy, and increasing the Treg/Th17 ratio
  via SIRT1 and Tph1 activation. The administration of mitoribosome‐targeting antibiotics
  reduced respiration and decreased NAD concentration, leading to reduced Th17 effector
  function and EAE protection. The kynurenine pathway for de novo synthesis of NAD+
  is activated in EAE mice, and long‐term activation of the kynurenine pathway generates
  an environment with increased concentration of NAD+ together with other toxic metabolites,
  worsening EAE. (b) Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterised by enhanced
  gut inflammation and permeability, and increased risk to develop colorectal cancer.
  The therapeutic properties of NAD+ precursors in IBD are exemplified by their role
  in activating anti‐colitogenic SIRTs and supressing the pro‐inflammatory NF‐κB signalling.
  Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of NAMPT as well as modulation of the NAD+/SIRT1
  axis using an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist offers a striking opportunity
  to fight against IBD'
