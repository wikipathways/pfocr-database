caption: 'Intrinsic apoptosis signalling: in response to growth factor deprivation,
  DNA damage or oncogene activation, BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins are induced transcriptionally
  or post-transcriptionally. The BH3-only proteins bind to and inhibit the anti-apoptotic
  BCL-2 proteins. This leads to release and activation of the effectors of cell death,
  BAX and BAK, which then oligomerise and promote mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation
  (MOMP), leading to release of apoptogenic factors, including cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo.
  This initiates a cascade of caspase activation, cleavage of hundreds of cellular
  proteins and consequent cell demolition. Death receptor induced (extrinsic) apoptosis
  signalling: stimulation of death receptors (members of the TNFR family with an intracellular
  death domain) by their cognate ligands (e.g. stimulation of FAS by FASL) results
  in adaptor protein (FADD, TRADD) mediated recruitment and activation of the initiator
  caspase, caspase-8 (in humans also caspase-10), which can then activate downstream
  effector caspases (caspases-3, -7), resulting in cell demolition (see above). The
  death receptor induced apoptosis pathway can connect to the intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway by proteolytic activation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein BID (to
  generate tBID) by caspase-8. Necroptosis: the best characterised pathway triggering
  necroptosis is via TNFR1 stimulation. Upon binding of TNFα to TNFR1, cIAPs, RIPK1,
  TRAFs and TRADD are recruited to the intracellular part of TNFR1, forming the TNFR1
  signalling complex I, which activates NFkB and AP1 transcription factors and thereby
  stimulates cell survival and proliferation. Upon deubiquitylation of RIPK1 by CYLD,
  RIPK1 can bind to TRADD, FADD and caspase-8 forming complex II which can drive caspase-8
  mediated apoptosis (see above). In the absence of caspase-8 (genetic ablation or
  pharmacological inhibition) and the absence or inhibition of cIAP1/2, the necrosome
  (complex III) is formed where RIPK3 can phosphorylate MLKL, promoting its translocation
  to the plasma membrane where MLKL causes cell lysis, resulting in lytic cell death
  with release of DAMPs and PAMPs.'
