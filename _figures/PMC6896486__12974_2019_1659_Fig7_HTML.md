caption: 'Exacerbation between G6PD dysfunction and neuroinflammation mediated chronic
  neurodegeneration. The present study elucidated a pathophysiological role of microglial
  G6PD in PD neurodegeneration. LPS-induced aberrant upregulation of G6PD promoted
  cellular oxidative stress and NF-кB activation through increasing NADPH availability
  to NADPH oxidase. Pharmacological inhibition of G6PD activity or biological knockdown
  of G6PD attenuated oxidative stress, ameliorated inflammatory response of microglia,
  and prevented DA neurons from LPS-induced chronic degeneration. G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; NADPH,
  nicotinamideadenine-dinucleotide phosphate; NADP+, oxidized form of NADPH; R5P,
  ribose-5-phosphate; LPS: Lipopolysaccharide; 6-AN, 6-aminonicotinamide; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone;
