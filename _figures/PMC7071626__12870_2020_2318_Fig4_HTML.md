caption: Temporal amino acid pathway inferred in the developing fruit of psyllium.
  X-axis and Y-axis represent days of fruit development and quantitative mean value
  (%), respectively as per Table S1. All experiments were carried out three times,
  each with three biological replicate sets and each set contained three replicates
