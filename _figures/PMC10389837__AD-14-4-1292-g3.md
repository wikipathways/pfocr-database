caption: Chronic restraint stress (CRS) induces AD pathogenesis by disrupting the
  HPA axis, and the CRF and glutamate signaling pathways. (1) CRS induces an increase
  in circulating glucocorticoids through the HPA axis, which in turn promotes an increase
  in Aβ generation, tau phosphorylation, and neuronal degeneration. (2) CRS promotes
  tau phosphorylation and Aβ generation through the corticotropin-releasing factor
  (CRF) pathway. (3) CRS inhibits the expression of glutamate transporter EAAT, leading
  to persistent excitatory toxicity in neurons. On one hand, excitotoxicity induces
  tau protein phosphorylation through Ca2+ overload mediated by synaptic and extrasynaptic
  NMDA receptors (NMDARs). On the other hand, activated extrasynaptic NMDARs induce
  neuronal apoptosis by excess ROS production. Moreover, activated extrasynaptic NMDARs
  can also inhibit the CREB signaling pathway, which mediates the physiological effects
  of synaptic NMDARs.
