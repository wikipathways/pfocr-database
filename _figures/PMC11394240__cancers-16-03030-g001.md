caption: YAP/TAZ mechanisms in solid tumors, particularly HCCs, in hypoxic environments.
  In early tumor development, YAP/TAZ act as important cell signals, not only for
  tumor apoptosis, but also for tumor proliferation. However, when tumor growth develops
  excessively and a hypoxic environment is created, YAP separates from TAZ and enters
  blood vessels through HIF1a. By generating and activating EMT, it maintains the
  microenvironment around the tumor so that the tumor can develop better, and it also
  develops an environment for the tumor to metastasize to other organs or tissues.
  In early-stage tumors, YAP/TAZ bind to TEAD and act as a transcriptional activator
  through the Hippo off signaling pathway, following the G protein-coupled receptor
  (GPCR) or glucagon receptor (Gcgr) signaling system to induce the development of
  early-stage tumors. When a tumor grows beyond a certain size and is unable to obtain
  the oxygen and nutrients it needs to proliferate, the angiogenic switch is triggered
  and through the hypoxia signaling system, overexpressed HIF and YAP/TAZ combine
  with TEAD to activate the expression of various genes to overcome hypoxia. Specifically,
  when localized to the nucleus, YAP is recruited together with hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1α (HIF-1α) for PKM2 transcription at the pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) gene
  promoter, contributing to tumor formation and metastasis
