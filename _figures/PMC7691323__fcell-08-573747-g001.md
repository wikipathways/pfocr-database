caption: Overview of glucose metabolism-Ca2+ interplay. (A) The GLUT family transporters
  transfer glucose into cells, where it is converted to pyruvate though the glycolytic
  pathway. The rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme HK generates G6P, which inhibits ER
  Ca2+ uptake by binding SERCA. In the final step of glycolysis, PKM2 converts PEP
  into pyruvate, generating ATP. PEP inhibits SERCA, while ATP regulates the activity
  of PMCA. HK2 at MAMs modulates Ca2+ flux from the ER into mitochondria through IP3R
  to prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ overload-induced cell death. (B) The ER luminal enzyme
  H6PD catalyzes the first two reactions of the oxidative branch of the PPP. The conversion
  of G6P into 6-phosphogluconate (6PG) generates NADPH, which is used as a cofactor
  by several ER-reducing enzymes. By regulating the ER redox state, H6PD modulates
  the activity of several proteins, including SERCA and IP3R. The glycolytic intermediate
  fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) can enter the HBP to generate UDP-GlcNAc through a series
  of reactions requiring glutamine. UDP-GlcNAc modifies the activity of several Ca2+
  transporters and regulatory proteins by O-GlcNAcylating serine and threonine residues.
