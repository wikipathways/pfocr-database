caption: 'Functional properties of different RAF inhibitors. The upper part shows
  the effect of RAF inhibitors on monomeric RAF kinases; the lower part shows the
  effect of RAF inhibitors on dimeric RAF kinases. The first and second generations
  of Raf inhibitors lead to paradoxical activation in dimeric kinases. The inhibitor
  binds to one protomer within an RAF dimer, causing conformational change and decreasing
  the affinity of the inhibitor for the other protomer, as well as substantial transactivation
  of this protomer (dotted arrow), resulting in higher downstream signaling activation.
  The third generations of Pan-Raf inhibitors bind to monomeric and dimeric kinases
  with similar affinity. The third generation of paradox breakers disrupt the B-Raf
  dimer interface and specifically inhibit B-Raf dimerization but not C-Raf homodimerization,
  although they bind to C-Raf. INH: inhibitor. RAF designates any isoforms of Raf.'
