caption: Simple scheme of photosynthetic energy-metabolite supply for isoprene synthesis
  and processes inducing oscillations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission. Photosynthesis
  is the largest sink for ATP provided by photophosphorylation and for NADPH produced
  through photosynthetic electron transport. Oscillations in photosynthesis are thought
  to occur due to feedback inhibition resulting from limited recycling of Pi that
  is incorporated both in the main photosynthetic intermediate  as well as triose
  phosphates (AC pool) and is also needed for ATP synthesis. When Pi levels drop because
  processes downstream of immediate CO2 fixation releasing Pi, starch, and sucrose
  synthesis, cannot keep up with Pi consumption, ATP production becomes inhibited,
  in turn inhibiting regeneration of  (; ; ). Overenergization of thylakoids further
  feedback inhibits the entire photosynthetic electron transport chain (visible in
  enhanced fluorescence during oscillations, e.g. ), resulting in inhibition of NADPH
  and  formation. Although the chloroplastic  pathway relies on a relatively small
  part of photosynthetic electron transport, two key enzymes,  synthase responsible
  for  formation and  reductase responsible for the immediate isoprene substrate  formation,
  can accept electrons directly from reduced  (). Thus, fluctuations in the rate of
  generation of reductive equivalents can lead to oscillatory changes in  and  pool
  sizes, resulting in oscillations in isoprene emission as demonstrated in this study.
  In principle, oscillations in isoprene emission can also result from oscillations
  in ATP and upstream carbon substrates through changes in  pool size, but given the
  extensive  pools in these experiments with partially fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves
  (–) and in noninhibited leaves (; see  for estimation of pool sizes under conditions
  shown here; ), a direct induction of oscillations by ATP concentration seems unlikely.
