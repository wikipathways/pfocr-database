caption: 'Therapeutic strategies targeting TLR, BCR, and MAPK signaling in CLL. Schematic
  representation of the main activation events in the B-cell receptor (BCR), mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. BCR signaling
  activation iniciates when the antigen binds to the receptor leading to CD79 phosphorylation
  through LYN and SYK tyrosine kinases forming a signalosome that includes the BLNK,
  the BTK and the PI3Kδ. These proteins transduce signals to calcium signaling modulator
  PLCγ2. PLCγ2 degrades the PIP2 into IP3 and DAG, releasing calcium from endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and promoting the activation of the PKCβ. Then, PKCβ activates the
  NF-κB pathway and ERK signaling. The canonical MAPK pathway is activated after a
  ligand binds to the RTK. Then, RAS protein recruits adaptor proteins, such as GRB-2
  and SOS and promotes the formation of RAF dimers. This induces the MEK-ERK cascade
  concluding with the translocation of STAT3 and CREB transcription factors to the
  nucleus. In contrast, the non-canonical MAPK pathway is activated by TRAF6, then
  MKK is phosphorylated and this leads to the activation of NF-κB pathway and to p38
  and JNK phosphorylation that promote the translocation of CREB and AP1 transcriptions
  factors to the nucleus. All these events favor cell survival, cell proliferation
  and cytokine secretion signals. Finally, TLR signaling pathway is activated by TLRs
  located on either the cell membrane or endolysosomal membranes. These receptors
  are capable to detect PAMPs which initiate the downstream signaling, mediated by
  two main adaptor proteins: MyD88 and/or TIR domain containing adapter molecule (TRIF)
  dependent pathways. MyD88 is recruited to the TIR domain of TLRs inducing IRAK1/2
  and IRAK4, jointly with MyD88, to form the Myddosome. Aside from MyD88-dependent
  signal transduction, TLR3 and TLR4 use the TRIF adaptor protein. TLR3 binds directly
  to TRIF whereas TLR4 needs TRAM. TLR3 and 4 bind to TRAF3 which induce the expression
  of IRF3, promoting the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs). All these complexes
  activate TRAF6 leading to the activation of NF-κB, IRF5 and MAPK pathways promoting
  the gene transcription of cell survival, proliferation, inflammation and proinflammatory
  cytokine production. Targeted drugs are highlighted in green. Pill icon: approved
  drugs and Erlenmeyer icon: preclinical studies or clinical trials.'
