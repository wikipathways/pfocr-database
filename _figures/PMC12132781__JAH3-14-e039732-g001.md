caption: (Left and Middle) Experimental workflow summarizing the use of TAC for 4 weeks
  in both USP29 KO (red) and mice with overexpression of USP29 via injection of AAV9,
  blue) compared with mice receiving a control vector. Analyses included cardiac functional
  assessment (echocardiography) and fibrosis analysis (histology), RNA‐seq, RT‐PCR,
  and studies in NRCMs. (Right) Mechanistic model of TAK1 JNK/p38 signaling pathway
  inducing pathological cardiac hypertrophy under pressure overload, and anti‐hypertrophic
  effects with an increase in USP29. AAV9 indicates adeno‐associated virus vector
  9; JNK, c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase; KO, knockout; NRCMs, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes;
  P, phosphate; p38, family of mitogen‐activated protein kinases; RNA‐seq, RNA sequencing;
  RT‐PCR, real‐time polyerase chain reaction; TAC, transverse aortic constriction;
  TAK1, transforming growth factor β‐activated kinase 1; Ub, K63‐linked polyubiquitin
  chains; USP29, ubiquitin‐specific protease 29; and WT, wild‐type
