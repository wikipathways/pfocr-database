caption: Canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. β-catenin is a component of cell-cell adhesion
  structures (adherens junctions) [-] and a key signaling factor in the Wnt pathway
  []. As shown here canonical Wnt signalling (Wnt/β-catenin) is defined by its inhibition
  of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) catalyzed phosphorylation of β-catenin.
  Several factors, including Cer (cerebrus), WIF-1 (wnt-interacting protein), and
  sFRPs (secreted frizzled related proteins) and dickkopf-1 (Dkk) are known to antagonize
  Wnt signalling [-]. However, upon Wnt stimulation several Fz-LRP downstream signalling
  components, including the phosphoprotein dishevelled (Dvl) [-], GBP/Frat1 (GSK-3β
  Binding Protein) [] and casein kinase I (CKIε) [,], somehow co-operate to inhibit
  GSK-3β. This ultimately this leads to an increase in the cytosolic 'free' levels
  of β-catenin (uncomplexed to cadherin), and its accumulation within the nucleus
  where it binds to members of the Tcf/Lef (T-cell factor-lymphoid enhancer factor)
  transcription factor family to activate gene transcription in a cell-context dependent
  manner [-]. In the absence of Wnt signalling, Axin/conductin [,] in co-operation
  with the product of the tumour suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
  [,] facilitate GSK-3β mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin on N-terminal serine
  and threonine residues []. This hyper-phosphorylated form of β-catenin then binds
  to the F-box protein β TrCP, which targets β-catenin for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteosome
  pathway [-].
