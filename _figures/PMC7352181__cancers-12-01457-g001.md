caption: 'Schematic representation of the renin-angiotensin system, its interaction
  with tumor hypoxia and angiogenesis and subsequent functional impact on tumor phenotype.
  Full line arrows represent positive effects, whereas dashed lines with blunt ends
  represent inhibitory effects. Angiotensinogen, a precursor of angiotensin peptides,
  is the only known naturally occurring renin substrate. Ang I is processed by ACE
  or ACE2 to produce Ang II and Ang-(1–7), respectively. Alternatively, Ang I can
  be converted to Ang II through chymase. Ang-(1–7) can be generated from Ang I, via
  Ang-(1–9), a pathway that utilizes both ACE2 and ACE, or by neprilysin that hydrolyzes
  Ang I directly to Ang-(1–7). Ang II acts in cells through two classes of seven trans-membrane
  G protein-coupled receptors: the angiotensin type I (AT1) and angiotensin type II
  (AT2) receptors. Upon binding of Ang II to ATR1, a downstream intracellular cascade
  is induced that results in cell proliferation, fibrosis and hypoxia by generating
  reactive oxygen species and subsequently pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic signals.
  The AT1 receptor is overexpressed in neoplastic tissues, suggesting its involvement
  in carcinogenesis. The role of AT2 receptors in cancer remains controversial, although
  including pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects. Ang-(1–7) binds to MasR
  and counteracts the resulting effects of Ang II/AT1 receptor activation, preventing
  tissue remodeling, improving vascular and cardiac function, and promoting the downregulation
  of cell proliferation, migration and metastasis. Hypoxia up-regulates Ang II, ACE,
  and AT1 receptor, while downregulating ACE2 and AT2 receptor. Local angiotensin
  II predominantly exists in the hypoxic regions of tumors, while these tumor cells
  produce Ang II by a chymase-dependent mechanism. Subsequently, the hypoxic tumor
  microenvironment induces the upregulation of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis, which is
  associated with the hallmarks of cancer, while it downregulates the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas
  receptor axis. ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme; ACE2, angiotensin converting
