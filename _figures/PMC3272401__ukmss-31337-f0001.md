caption: Cell death signalling regulated by the Bcl2 family. Prosurvival-members of
  the Bcl2 family preserve mitochondrial integrity by preventing activation of Bax
  and/or Bak until neutralised by BH3-only proteins. This leads to mitochondrial outer
  membrane permabilization, release of apoptogenic factors, including cytochrome c,
  required for apoptosome formation and activation of the caspase cascade. Activation
  of death receptors can licence the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by caspase-8
  mediated cleavage of Bid into tBid, connecting the extrinsic with the intrinsic
  apoptosis pathway in an amplification loop
