caption: Tumor-supportive effects of BMAT. Many factors from BMAT may induce MM tumor
  growth and disease progression. Lipids may serve as a fuel source for tumor cells,
  antigens to stimulate precursor disease initiation [i.e., monoclonal gammopathy
  of undefined significance (MGUS)], or inhibitors of the immune system. IGF-1 and
  insulin can accelerate tumor proliferation. IL-1 and IL-15 can have effects on immune
  cells and inflammatory molecules to support MM growth and immune evasion. Complex
  interactions between TNFα, IL-6, leptin, PAI-1, and MCP-1 can lead to osteoclast
  activation, thrombosis, and JAK/Stat/MAPk signaling to cause osteolysis, thrombosis
  and tumor cell migration, drug resistance, and proliferation. Glycolytic and pentose
  phosphate pathway enzyme upregulation, potentially found in high energy states,
  can also lead to melphalan resistance in MM cells.
