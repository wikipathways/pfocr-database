caption: Regulation of cAMP and ERK signaling by 5-HTR1E receptor. (A) Upon activation
  with serotonin, 5-HTR1E receptor binds to Gαi protein and inhibit adenyl cyclase
  activity which reduces the levels of cAMP and CREB in HEK 293 cells. At the same
  time, it increases ERK phosphorylation via PKA/PI3-K mediated pathway and plays
  a role in survival or proliferation of glioma and neuroblastoma cells (B) Cell surface
  interaction between NF-α1/CPE and 5-HTR1E recruits β-arrestin to the intracellular
  domains of 5-HTR1E and activate pERK pathway which helps in BCL2 mediated protection
  of HEK293 and human neurons against oxidative stress. Created with BioRender.com
