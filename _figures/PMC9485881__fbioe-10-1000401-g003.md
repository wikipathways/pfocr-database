caption: 'Schematic of influence of superhydrophilicity surface on osteogenic immune
  response. From left to right: the increased attachment of Fn provides more binding
  sites for integrin β1, which in turn promotes the polarization of macrophages towards
  M2 by promoting the PI3K/Akt pathway. The superhydrophilic surface up-regulates
  IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13, promotes the polarization into M2, and promotes M2 phenotype
  secretion of IL-10, CD206, and CD136, promoting anti-inflammatory effects. The down-regulation
  of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β inhibited the polarization into M1 polarization, and inhibited
  the secretion of CD84 and iNOS of the M1 phenotype, inhibiting inflammation. Macrophages
  activated CD4+T cells, and the superhydrophilic surface promoted the differentiation
  of CD4+T cells into the anti-inflammatory phenotype Th2 and Treg and inhibited the
  differentiation into the pro-inflammatory phenotype Th1 and Th17.'
