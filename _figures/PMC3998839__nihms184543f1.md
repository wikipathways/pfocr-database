caption: mTORC1 is a component of mTOR that is directly inhibited by rapamycin and
  rapamycin derivatives like everolimus. mTORC1 is activated by growth factors and
  amino acids, which activate Pi3K. Pi3K phosphorylates PiP2 to yield PiP3. PiP3 phosphorylates
  and activates Akt which phosphorylates and inhibits the TSC. TSC negatively regulates
  mTORC1 by inhibiting Rheb which normally activates mTORC1. PTEN, a phosphatase that
  dephosphorylates PiP3 to convert it back to PiP2, negatively regulates Pi3K. Upon
  activation of mTOR, the G1-S cell cycle transition and cell proliferation are stimulated
  while the apoptosis pathway is inhibited. In addition, mTOR acts as angiogenic agent
  via activation of HIF to promote tumor growth.
