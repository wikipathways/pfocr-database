caption: Properties of the PTS chemotactic pathway. The PTS is poised far from equilibrium
  because of the slow dimerization of EI monomers (EID to EIM, dashed arrow), obligatory
  for phosphorylation by PEP. The positive chemotactic signal triggered by transport
  of PTS substrates (S) may originate either from a decrease in phosphorylation levels
  of the donor phosphorelay or from changes in metabolite levels caused by PEP consumption.
  It may act on CheA, CheZ, CheY.P, or the motor switch (boxed items). The present
  study sought to distinguish between these possibilities. The analysis of mutant
  responses showed that the PTS signal acted solely to inhibit MCP-bound CheA. The
  high response sensitivity argued that it is generated by the dephosphorylation of
  PTS phosphorelay components, most likely EI. PEP levels decrease little, and their
  subsequent restoration by metabolism of d-glc (dashed arrows, small arrowheads)
  does not affect signaling. The response kinetics implied that signaling (gray arrows)
  was limited, as for periplasmic MCP ligands (L), by CheY.P dephosphorylation (i.e.,
  kc + k−c) over most of the PTS chemotactic response range if PTS dephosphorylation
  kinetics were determined by the transport rate, consistent with known transport
  and biochemical data. Rephosphorylation of the PTS phosphorelay on withdrawal of
  PTS substrates will be limited by EI dimerization and may not be rapid enough to
  stimulate CheA (+), in contrast to withdrawal of MCP attractant ligands. Evidence
  for such a signal was not obtained.
