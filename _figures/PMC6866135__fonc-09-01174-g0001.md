caption: IRAK1 kinase drives distinct prosurvival responses to microbial infection
  and ionizing radiation. (A) Diagram of the TLR signaling cascade which stimulates
  immune cell survival and inflammation in response to pathogen sensing. Ligated TLRs
  recruit MyD88 to trigger Myddosome (MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK1) formation, resulting in the
  activation of IRAK1 and release of the kinase from the complex. In turn, the activated
  form of IRAK1 binds TRAF6 to enable TRAF6-mediated activation of multiple pathways
  involved in anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory signaling. (B) Diagram of the newly
  identified IRAK1 signaling pathway triggered by IR, which involves IRAK4 but not
  MyD88 and antagonizes apoptosis through a different route involving inhibition of
  PIDDosome formation. Note that while IRAK1 catalytic activity is required in the
  radiation response (as symbolized by a green glare), it is dispensable for microbial
  responses relying on TRAF6 as signaling intermediate downstream of IRAK1.
