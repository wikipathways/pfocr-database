caption: DILI-related processes inferred from predicted targets and pathway annotations.
  Processes were based on SVM (red) and RF (yellow) models or both (orange) on the
  DILI (−vLessConcern) dataset. All processes are linked to the corresponding over-represented
  proteins in grey (19 proteins with highest feature importance). Multiple highly
  similar genesets were combined to arachidonic acid metabolism, Cytochrome P450 and
  biotransformation with the individual genesets being mapped in Table . Biotransformation
  and Cytochrome P450 are identified by both methods, while additional pathways identified
  by SVM point to lipid metabolism and cell cycle, and TP53 regulation is identified
  by RF. Moreover, arachidonic acid metabolism (SVM) and prostaglandin synthesis (RF),
  two biologically closely related processes, are identified
