caption: 'Select HCMV gene products that target apoptotic pathways during HCMV infection.
  (1) HCMV enters a target cell and (2) the viral capsid is trafficked to the nucleus.
  The viral genome is translocated into the nuclear space and initiation of viral
  gene expression occurs. A number of viral gene products have been shown to alter
  the cellular environment to promote a pro-survival state. (3) The immediate early
  proteins IE1 and IE2 activate the PI(3)K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway via phosphorylation
  of Akt to promote survival of infected cells. (4) The HCMV protein vICA (pUL36)
  binds to the initiator procaspase-8 and blocks its proteolytic cleavage and activation
  downstream of cellular death receptors. (5) HCMV vMIA (pUL37x1) binds pro-apoptotic
  Bax and Bak to prevent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and
  the induction of the caspase activation cascade. (6) HCMV pUL38 suppresses endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis, likely through inhibition of JNK phosphorylation.
  Other proteins, as suggested in the text, may also influence survival through a
  variety of additional mechanisms. (7) In addition to the viral proteins described,
  HCMV non-coding RNA β2.7 prevents apoptosis via interaction with mitochondrial membrane
  complex I. FADD: Fas-associated death domain.'
