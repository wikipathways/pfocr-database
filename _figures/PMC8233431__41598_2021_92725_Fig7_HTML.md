caption: Keratinization pathway is upregulated in LUSC. The Keratinization pathway
  is the most upregulated pathway according to Reactome analysis with p-value 3.33E−15
  and FDR 1.95E−12. The boxes partially highlighted in brown indicate the number of
  genes identified in the analysis that are associated with each box.
