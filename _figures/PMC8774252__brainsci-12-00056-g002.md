caption: Schematic diagrams illustrating the molecular mechanisms of PAFAH1B1 (LIS1),
  CRK, and 14-3-3ε in regulating neuronal migration. (A) Phosphorylated NDEL1 (NUDEL)
  protected by 14-3-3ε from dephosphorylation. NDEL1 is phosphorylated by CDK5. Once
  phosphorylated, 14-3-3ε interacts with NDEL1 and protects it from the protein phosphatase
  2 (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation. Therefore, NDEL1 could stay activated. Active
  NDEL1 transiently interacts with PAFAH1B1 (LIS1) and helps PAFAH1B1 (LIS1) bind
  to dynein, therefore promoting the movement of dynein along microtubules (MTs).
  However, it is unclear whether 14-3-3ε stays with dynein in the MTs. (B). PAFAH1B1
  (LIS1) promotes dynein “open” conformation. When dynein is in an autoinhibited state,
  it has a low microtubule on rate and a reduced ability to bind to dynactin. PAFAH1B1
  (LIS1) binds to “open” state dynein and stabilizes dynein at the “open” state. This
  allows dynein to stay at a high microtubule-binding status. Afterward, PAFAH1B1
  (LIS1) dissociates from the dynein–dynactin complex. In this way, PAFAH1B1 (LIS1)
  promotes microtubule mediate migration by regulating dynein function. (C) CRK plays
  an essential role in the Reelin signaling cascade. Reelin pathways are activated
  by Reelin interacting with the transmembrane Reelin receptors, ApoRE2, and VLDLR.
  This triggers the phosphorylation of Dab1 by SFK at the inner leaflet of the plasma
  membrane. DAB1 then recruits CRK and activates CRK by phosphorylation. Activated
  CRK promotes the activation of the Crk SH3-binding guanine nucleotide-releasing/exchange
  factor (C3G)/Ras-proximate-1 (RAP1) pathway, which activates the cell matrix adhesion
  molecule α5β1 integrin, thus promoting cell migration. The illustrations were created
  with BioRenders.com (7 December 2021).
