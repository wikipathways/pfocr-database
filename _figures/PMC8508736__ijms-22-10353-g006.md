caption: A general SBGN diagram of the modular model describing metabolism in human
  muscle fibers (A) taking into account metabolic processes in the cytoplasm (B) and
  the mitochondrion (D), and transport reactions between two compartments (C) as well
  as modules of the Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway and AMPK activity considering
  different isoforms. Designations of input/output/contact ports are described above
  in the main text. The vertices of the bipartite graph  in the Cytosol/Mitochondrion
  and Transport submodules correspond to the respective biochemical or transport reaction
  depending on the submodule. Each fiber type module also comprises submodules of
  Ca2+- and AMPK-dependent signaling pathways. All details for each submodule and
  zoomed-in subfigures are in the .
