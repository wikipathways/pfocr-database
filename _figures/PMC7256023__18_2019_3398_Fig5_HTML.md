caption: Lipid and choline metabolism in TGFβ-induced EMT. During lipogenesis, citrate
  from the TCA cycle is transported into the cytoplasm and cleaved by ATP citrate
  lyase (ACLY) to acetyl-CoA, which is carboxylated to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  (ACC). Subsequently, fatty acid synthase (FASN) catalyzes malonyl-CoA into palmitate,
  a substrate for triglyceride, phospholipid and cholesterol ester synthesis. Sterol
  regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding
  protein (ChREBP) are important regulators of ACLY, ACC and FASN transcription. Expression
  of these enzymes and nuclear factors is repressed during TGFβ-induced EMT. Lipid
  rafts are formed by cholesterol and sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin (SM),
  sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and glycosphingolipid (GSL). TGFβ-induced EMT correlates
  with reduced expression of sphingomyelin synthase (SMS), which converts ceramide
  to SM. This interferes with EMT induction by TGFβ via inhibition of TGFβR1 and SMAD2
  phosphorylation. S1P upregulates matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7) by stimulating
  the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. MMP7 is linked to EMT through the regulation of
  MMP-7/syndecan-1/TGFβ autocrine loop. Furthermore, TGFβ-signaling decreases Gg4,
  an important component of GSL required for EMT. ZEB1 promotes the expression of
  a-series glycosphingolipids including GM3 synthase connecting glycosphingolipid
  metabolism and epithelial cell adhesion during TGFβ-induced EMT. Choline kinase
  alpha (CHKα) is a key enzyme in the cytidine 5′-diphosphocholine (CDP)-choline pathway
  (known as the Kennedy pathway) to generate phosphatidylcholine, an essential component
  of cell membranes. Abnormal expression and activity of CHKα is associated with tumor
  metastasis. The EMT activator ZEB1-altered choline metabolism by stimulating CHKα
