caption: Illustration of the possible role of lactate in anti-retroviral protection
  of the female genital tract as a consequence of lactate action through its receptor
  (HCA1) and as a HDAC inhibitor. Under normal conditions (high lactate level), symbiotic
  microbiota produce L-/D-lactate which can be sensed by cervical epithelial cells
  equipped with a specific receptor for lactate. Microbiota-derived lactate stimulates
  surface HCA1, induces cAMP signaling, and triggers cAMP/EPAC/PKA-dependent shuttling
  of DNA-PKcs to nuclear compartment (1 pathway). HCA1 signaling also increases MCT
  expression followed by monocarboxylate influx, which, in turn, positively regulates
  HCA1 expression. In the nuclear compartment, lactate and butyrate inhibit histone
  deacetylases (HDACs), thus promoting histone acetylation by histone acetylases (HACs).
  Acetylated histones induce chromatin relaxation and recruitment of DNA-PKcs to the
  nucleus (2 pathways). Finally, enhanced nuclear localization of DNA-PKcs protects
  cells from lentiviral (e.g., HIV-1) transduction. Lactate shortage (low lactate
  level), for example, as a result of cervicovaginal microbiota dysbiosis, accounts
  for insufficient anti-lentiviral protection.
