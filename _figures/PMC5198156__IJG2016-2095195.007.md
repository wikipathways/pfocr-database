caption: Pathways in response to acid-Al ions based on KEGG analysis. Overview of
  the combinations of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism,
  and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways in response to acid-Al ions based on KEGG analysis.
  Nineteen genes were differentially expressed in response to acid-Al ions. Hierarchical
  clustering of the results of the correlation coefficient analysis was shown in the
  lower right corner. The divided groups were marked by different shapes and color
  icons, which were also marked in the metabolic pathway. High positive correlation
  coefficient with genes in the divided groups were shown near the image of the hierarchical
  clustering analysis and also marked in the light shadow zone of the metabolic pathway.
