caption: Diagram of the signaling network involved in regulation of light responses
  in Trichoderma species. The diagram has been divided in two sections for simplicity.
  (A) The photoreceptor complex BLR1/BLR2 controls expression of blue light up-regulated
  (blu) and down-regulated (bld) genes. The BLR proteins control transcription of
  the env1 gene. ENV1 in turn establishes a feedback regulatory loop with the BLR
  proteins, and is involved in photoadaptation. Blu genes impact stress tolerance
  and DNA repair. Both blu and bld genes regulate growth. The photoreceptor BLR1/BLR2
  is also crucial for light dependent carbon source utilization. In addition, light
  causes oxidative stress and influences peptaibol biosynthesis, which is also regulated
  by the G-protein alpha subunit GNA3. (B) The BLR1/BLR2 complex regulates photoconidiation,
  which is also influenced by a second light input involving the cAMP-pathway, constituted
  by adenylate cyclase (ACY), cAMP, and protein kinase A (PKA). Light enhanced cellulase
  gene expression involves the function of the photoreceptors BLR1/BLR2 and ENV1,
  the sulfur signaling pathway, the heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunits GNA1 and
  GNA3 and the cAMP-pathway. Arrows indicate positive regulation and lines with a
  bar at the end indicate negative regulation. Solid lines are used when there is
  direct experimental evidence and dotted lines when the role is still hypothetical.
  Overlapping lines appear in gray for clarity.
