caption: Putative pathway for degradation of mercaptosuccinate in V. paradoxus strain
  B4. Initially, a Moco-dependent oxidoreductase (MS oxidoreductase) catalyzes the
  transfer to MS of two oxygen atoms from water, producing sulfinosuccinate, which
  is subsequently oxidized to sulfosuccinate. The sulfur moiety in this intermediate
  is then probably removed as sulfite, yielding oxaloacetate by a desulfonation reaction.
  Afterwards, oxaloacetate could be further metabolized via the tricarboxylic acid
  cycle. Finally, sulfite is oxidized to sulfate via adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS)
  or by either a sulfite oxidase (Sox) or a sulfite dehydrogenase (Sor). Because MS
  oxidoreductase and the sulfite oxidases belong to the group of molybdoenzymes, requiring
  molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD) or molybdenum cofactor (Moco), respectively,
  for their catalytic activities, this dependence is indicated by dashed arrows. The
  participation of MoeA and MobA proteins in the biosynthesis of the Mo-containing
  cofactors is illustrated schematically. The hypothetical occurrence of sulfinosuccinate
  is indicated by brackets. In the box the assimilatory sulfate reduction is shown
  without details.
