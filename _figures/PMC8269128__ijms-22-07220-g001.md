caption: Regulation of HIF pathway. Under normoxia, HIFα protein is hydroxylated by
  PHDs and subsequently recognized by pVHL and degraded through the ubiquitin–proteasome
  pathway. In hypoxia, PHD activity is inhibited by the decreased O2 levels and thus
  HIFα hydroxylation. HIFα is therefore stabilized and translocated into the nucleus,
  dimerizes with HIF1β, and activates the expression of hypoxia responsive genes with
  additional transcriptional co-factors, such as CBP/P300. Ub = ubiquitin.
