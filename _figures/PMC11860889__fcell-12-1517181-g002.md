caption: Role of WNT/β-catenin in regulating interactions of renal tubular epithelia/fibroblasts/macrophages.
  In the early stages of fibrosis, injured renal tubular epithelial cells release
  pro-inflammatory mediators and chemokines, among others, to recruit and activate
  macrophages. Macrophages undergo M1 polarization, and M1 macrophages clear pathogens
  while secreting large amounts of pro-inflammatory factors, exacerbating tubular
  and interstitial damage. In the later stages of fibrosis, M2 macrophages (alternatively
  activated macrophages) gradually replace M1 macrophages. M2 macrophages promote
  the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts by secreting
  pro-fibrotic factors such as TGF-β and PDGF. Myofibroblasts synthesize large amounts
  of ECM, including collagen, fibronectin and hyaluronic acid. Fibroblasts promote
  macrophage activation, and activated macrophages can become myofibroblasts (MMT).
  The population of inflammatory fibroblasts is part of the intermediate state. In
  the process of differentiation from fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Inflammatory
  fibroblast populations attract macrophages in the early stages of fibrosis and induce
  monocytes to differentiate into FOLR2+ macrophages. Subsequently, these FOLR2+ macrophages
  induce the transformation of pro-inflammatory fibroblast populations into myofibroblasts
  via the WNT/β-catenin pathway. Excessive ECM deposition disrupts the normal structure
  of renal tissue, leading to progressive irreversibility of fibrosis. Myofibroblasts
  can also originate from activated macrophages (MMT). Injured renal tubular epithelial
  cells undergo EMT, and Snail, Twist, ZEB, FOXC, and Ets are important transcription
  factors in the process of EMT. During EMT, renal tubular epithelial cells lose their
  polarity and tight junctions, and are gradually transformed into mesenchymal cells
  with fibroblast-like features, expressing mesenchymal markers such as α-SMA, and
  producing ECM components (especially Fibronectin) bind to Integrins in the tubular
  epithelium, altering cell adhesion properties and further inducing EMT. Meanwhile,
  the mechanical stress of ECM, which increases during fibrosis, can activate mechanosensory
  signaling pathways in the epithelium, which can also transmit signals via Integrins
  for the development of EMT. In normal tissue repair, MMPs maintain the dynamic balance
  of the ECM to promote tissue repair and regeneration by removing damaged tissue
  and degrading ECM components. But MMPs are over-activated in fibrotic environments,
  and MMPs not only degrade the basement membrane, making it easier for cells to migrate
  and facilitating the EMT process, but also participate in the degradation and remodelling
  of the ECM, which provides space for fibrotic tissue to expand, and release some
  pro-fibrotic cytokines that are bound and stored by the ECM, such as TGF-β, which
  further facilitates the activation of fibroblasts and ECM deposition, leading to
  increased fibrosis. Epithelial cells can autocrine WNT ligand in a fibrotic environment,
  activating WNT/β-catenin signaling to generate EMT, which allows epithelial cells
  to progressively lose epithelial properties (cell polarity and tight junctions)
  and to acquire fibroblastic properties. Paracrine WNT ligand activates neighbouring
  fibroblasts to promote their proliferation and activation into myofibroblasts, resulting
  in excessive ECM deposition. Paracrine WNT ligands also modulate the behaviour of
  macrophages, which undergo M2 polarisation and release pro-fibrotic factors. In
  fibroblasts, the maintenance of their activated state and pro-fibrotic phenotype
  is helped by autocrine and paracrine WNT. Activation of the WNT pathway induces
  pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages and polarization to the M2 phenotype,
  whereas macrophage-derived WNT affects fibroblast activation and proliferation.
  Similarly, renal tubular cells can directly interact with WNT ligands derived from
  macrophages and fibroblasts
