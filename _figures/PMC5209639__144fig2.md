caption: Biologic mechanisms of tracer uptake. (A) PABA is used as substrate by dihydropteroate
  synthase (encoded by folP) in folate synthesis pathway and is subsequently trapped
  inside bacteria. d-mannitol and d-sorbitol are transported and phosphorylated inside
  the bacteria by a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate phosphotransferase
  system (PTS). Mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (encoded by mtlD) and sorbitol-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (encoded by srlD) then convert their substrates into fructose-6-phosphate.
  (B) Comparison of homology of E. coli genes encoding key enzymes to other pathogenic
  bacteria in the UniProtKB database.
