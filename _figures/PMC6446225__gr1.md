caption: Proposed overview of the vascular immunopathology of sickle cell disease
  (SCD). The A6T mutation in the β-globin gene causes a G6V mutation in the globin
  polypeptide, leading to the deoxygenated hemoglobin S (HbS) variant. When red blood
  cells (RBCs) are deoxygenated, HbS polymerizes and the cells take on a sickle phenotype
  and express adhesion molecules, such as CD36, which mediate attachment with the
  endothelium. Hemolysis of the sickled cells produces heme microparticles and arginase
  into the plasma and scavenge nitric oxide and stimulates the release of adhesion
  molecules, such as intracellular adhesion molecule, vascular cellular adhesion molecule,
  P-selectin, and E-selectin. Tissue resident macrophages and dendritic cells secrete
  interleukin (IL)-23, causing T cells to release IL-17A, which stimulates the secretion
  of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to activate neutrophil production.
  The process of neutrophil maturation is under the control of mainly two transcription
  factors (PU.1 and CCAAT). Neutrophils adhere and roll along the endothelium through
  selectin and integrin interactions in the direction of blood flow and are activated
  by chemokines along the endothelial layer. DAMPs (eg, ATP, high mobility group 1)
  trigger Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 and induce an inflammatory response with the
  secretion of cytokines and chemokines. They also send activation signals to neutrophils
  and modulate their phenotype (aged neutrophils) that promote sickle cell vaso-occlusion.
  Activated platelets cause neutrophils to release chromatin and granule proteins
  to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and capture sickle RBCs (sRBCs). After
  activation from glycolipids derived from the tissue damage, invariant natural killer
  T (iNKT) cells cause further neutrophil recruitment and inflammation through production
  of interferon-γ and CXCR3 chemokines. sRBCs have phosphatidylserine externalization
  and express β2-adrenergic receptors, which activate their procoagulant nature and
  adhesion properties, respectively. The subsequent responses consist of continuous
  accumulation of leukocytes, platelets, and RBCs with the activation of the coagulation
  cascade. These interactions may be mediated by the production of various proinflammatory
  and prothrombotic mediators, such as cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase, NETs, histones
  (citH3), and coagulant factors (FV and FX). Neutrophil elastase can co-localize
  with tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) on NETs and facilitates TFPI degradation,
  resulting in an activated coagulation system. The presence of citH3 on NETs is known
  to induce platelet aggregation via involvement of TLR2 and TLR4. Cathepsin G can
  activate protease activated receptor (PAR)-4, resulting in further platelet activation.
  As more blood cells become further incorporated and recruited into growing thrombi,
  fibrin scaffolds are formed. Under homeostatic conditions, neutrophils generally
  produce annexin A1 (AnxA1), which counteracts proinflammatory responses and enables
  resolution. However, in SCD, AnxA1 levels are low. Dotted lines separate the different
  phases of SCD vascular immunopathology.
