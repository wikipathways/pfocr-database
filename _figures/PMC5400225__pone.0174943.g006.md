caption: S.dysenteriae stimulated phosphorylation of β-catenin through GSK-3β and
  β-catenin is subsequently degraded in the proteosome, simultaneously NF- κB is liberated
  from IκBα and it is degraded in the proteosome as that of β-catenin and NF- κB freely
  translocate to the nucleus. NF- κB activates transcription of IL-8 and other proinflammatory
  genes in the nucleus, thus leading to inflammation.
