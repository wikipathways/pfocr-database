caption: Overview of the pathogenesis of neutrophils in IBD. (A) IECs are activated
  by pathogenic bacteria to release various signaling molecules, including chemokines,
  cytokines, lipid mediators, and MMPs, which serve to recruit neutrophils to the
  site of inflammation. This recruitment leads to mucosal damage, apoptosis of IECs,
  and dysfunction of the intestinal barrier, as neutrophils secrete NE and MMPs that
  penetrate the intestinal epithelium86,87 (B) The delayed apoptosis of neutrophils
  may be influenced by several factors, including cytokines, inflammatory mediators,
  CSF, hypoxic conditions, extracellular acidosis, and LPS, LP, PG, and LTA produced
  by pathogens.88,89 Additionally, the ChemR2390 and PD-L1-PI3K-AKT91 signaling pathways
  in neutrophils have been associated with delayed regression. (C) The accumulation
  of neutrophils at the lesion site is a consequence of abnormal aggregation and delayed
  apoptosis, which ultimately resulting in the formation of a neutrophilic crypt abscess.
  (D and E). Neutrophils exhibit dual functionality; they release ROS and NETs that
  effectively eliminate pathogenic microorganisms. However, excessive inflammation
  can also result in tissue damage due to the overactivity of these immune responses
