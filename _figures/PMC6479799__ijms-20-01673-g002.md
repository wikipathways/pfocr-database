caption: 'Mechanism of CB-R-mediated antitumor activity in breast cancer cells. By
  binding to CB1-R and CB2-R, CBs inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation through
  various mechanisms. They block cell cycle progression at the G1/S phase via CB1-R
  and at the G2/M phase via CB2-R activation. They induce breast cancer cell death
  via apoptosis, mediated by the activation of the transcription factor jun-D. In
  HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, they block cancer cell proliferation in
  culture and tumors by inhibiting Akt and ERK signaling. They also inhibit cell migration
  and angiogenesis via CB2-R. CB1-R activation inhibits the FAK/SRC/RhoA pathway leading
  to inhibition of cell migration. Cell migration blockade is also achieved by CB2-R
  activation through the inhibition of COX-2 and ERK signaling, which is important
  for triple-negative breast cancer. AC: adenylate cyclase; Akt: protein kinase B;
  CB-R: cannabinoid receptor; COX-2: cyclooxygenase-2; EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition; ERK: extracellular-signal-regulated kinase; FAK: focal adhesion kinase;
  GPR: G-protein coupled receptor; HER2: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2:
  MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K:
