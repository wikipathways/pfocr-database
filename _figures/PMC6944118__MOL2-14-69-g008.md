caption: Working model of the role of HERC2 in p53‐MDM2 loop regulation. The HERC2‐NEURL4
  complex binds oligomerized p53 through the CPH domain of HERC2. The p53‐HERC2‐NEURL4
  complex binds MDM2 and, in the basal state, MDM2 polyubiquitylates p53, thus marking
  it for proteasomal degradation. Upon DNA damage (such as bleomycin treatment), DNA
  damage‐sensing kinases phosphorylate MDM2 and HERC2 thus detaching MDM2 from the
  complex. Phosphorylated MDM2 is unstable, is autopolyubiquitylated, and later is
  degraded by proteasome as well. This situation also induces activation of p53, in
  terms of phosphorylation and acetylation, and, later, its translocation to the promoters
  of its targeted genes such as p21 or MDM2 itself the protein product of which can
  bind p53 and begin the regulatory loop again.
