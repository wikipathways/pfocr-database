caption: Proposed signaling pathways regulating MUC synthesis and secretion. TNF-α
  induces an inflammatory response through the NF-κB signaling pathway mediated by
  TNFR, with concomitant activation of MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways. These pathways
  synergistically regulate MUC expression and synthesis. LY294002 and U0126 are specific
  inhibitors of the PI3K and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, respectively. The arrows indicate
  demonstrated effects. Steps blocked by inhibitors are indicated.

    TNF-α induces an inflammatory response through the NF-κB signaling pathway mediated
    by TNFR, with concomitant activation of MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways. These
    pathways synergistically regulate MUC expression and synthesis. LY294002 and U0126
