caption: Proposed RasV12 singling network leading to cell dissemination. Our data
  support a signalling network in which Toll, JNK and actin cytoskeleton signalling
  genes, Rac1, Rok, Sqh, Apr2 and Apr3, transmit the transformative RasV12 signalling
  that primes the hindgut enterocytes towards delamination and dissemination. RasV12
  expression stimulates activation primarily of Rac1, which may in turn promote actin
  cytoskeleton rearrangements required for cell dissemination via Rho activation and
  Sqh phosphorylation. Moreover, Rac1 forms a positive feedback loop with the Toll
  immune pathway. Rac1 activated Toll drives the expression of snail and spz5, which
  in turn repress E-cadherin and sustain Toll signalling activation. Finally, Rac1
  and Toll signalling converge on JNK activation and upregulation of Mmp1 expression,
  leading to basement membrane degradation, allowing cells to invade neighbouring
  tissues
