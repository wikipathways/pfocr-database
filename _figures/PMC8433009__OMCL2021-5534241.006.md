caption: Detailed view of the nicotinate-nicotinamide metabolic pathway. Schematic
  representation of the nicotinate-nicotinamide pathway organized according to KEGG
  pathway diagrams, with individual values plotted for each of the four experimental
  groups (young sham, young CLP, aged sham, and aged CLP). As previously, data was
  graphed for all available metabolites in the pathway, and undetected metabolites
  were left as labeled boxes. Statistical testing was accomplished using two-way ANOVA,
  and significance in this analysis was denoted in the right lower corner of each
  metabolite graph using G (group), T (timepoint), or I (interaction). Post hoc multiple
  comparisons testing was done to evaluate the differences between both aged CLP and
  aged sham as well as aged CLP and young CLP, as described in the methods.
