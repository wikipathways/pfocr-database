caption: 'During normal insulin sensitivity, IR binds and activates CAV1 and then
  undergoes a series of autophosphorylations and activates the IRS/PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway, which eventually leads to GLUT4 translocation in CAV1-mediated vesicles
  to the surface. During insulin resistance, while CAV1 and IR expression is increased,
  IR dissociates from CAV1 and moves into GM3-rich lipid rafts leading to impaired
  insulin signaling and decreased GLUT4 translocation to the membrane and causing
  a reduction in glucose uptake by the cell. Abbreviations: IR—insulin receptor; AKT—RAC-alpha
  serine threonine protein kinase; PI3K—phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; IRS1—insulin
  receptor substrate 1; GLUT4—glucose transporter 4.'
