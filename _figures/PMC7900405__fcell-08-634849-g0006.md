caption: 'Schematic illustrating entosis and the actin machinery. Actin machinery
  is essential for entosis. In the loser cell, signaling pathway proteins including
  Cdc42, RhoA, ROCK I/II, Rac1, mDia1, AMPK, PCDH7, PP1α, MRTF, SRF, and Ezrin converge
  on the actomyosin network to regulate entosis. In the winner cell, PCDH7 and PP1α
  also exist. Three actin-correlated structures, the contractile actomyosin, the adherens
  junction and the mechanical ring, are sandwiched between the winner cell and the
  loser cell. Please see the main text for more detailed information. Abbreviations:
  Cdc42, cell division control protein 42; RhoA, Ras homolog family member A; ROCK,
  Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase; Rac1, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate
  1; pMLC2, phosphorylated myosin light chain 2; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase;
  mDia1, diaphanous-related formin 1; PCDH7, protocadherin-7; PP1α, protein phosphatase
  1α; MRTF, myocardin-related transcription factor; SRF, serum response factor; CA,
  the contractile actomyosin; MR, the mechanical ring; AJ, the adherens junction.'
