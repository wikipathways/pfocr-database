caption: 'Schematic representation of the central carbon metabolism network implemented
  in the multi-level kinetic model of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The blue highlights
  the reactions of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Red indicates the proposed secondary
  role or EDA and related pathway to proline; annotated gene IDs are included for
  the convenience. The model includes the Calvin-Benson cycle, glycogen synthesis
  (sink from glucose-6-phosphate), photorespiratory pathways, phosphoketolase pathway,
  glycolysis, the oxidative pentose pathway, Entner–Doudoroff pathway, and sink reactions
  (representing the adjacent pathway and the calculation of biomass production, indicated
  by metabolites in rectangular shapes). The reversibility of a particular reaction
  is indicated by two small arrows. Gray indicates the involved enzymes: RuBisCO,
  ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; GAP,
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TPI, triose-phosphate isomerase; ALDO,
  aldolase; FBPase, fructose-1,6 bisphosphatase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; TKT, transketolase;
  SBPase, sedoheptulose-1,7 bisphosphatase; RPI, phosphopentose isomerase; PPE, phosphopentose
  epimerase; PRK, phosphoribulokinase; GPI, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; PGD, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; PGPase, phosphoglycolate phosphatase;

  serine hydroxymethyltransferase; GLOX, glyoxylate oxidase; PSAT*, phosphoserine
  transaminase; PPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; PGM, phosphoglycerate mutase;
  ENO, enolase; GND, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; ZWF, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;

  aspC, L-erythro-4-hydroxyglutamate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (activity of
  aspartate aminotransferase); putA, delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase;

  pathway: 4-H-2-OG 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate, E4-HGlu L-erythro-4-hydroxyglutamate,
