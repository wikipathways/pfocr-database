  RNA Silencing Suppressors: (a) The known effectors that affect host RNA silencing
  in P. syringae. AvrPto inhibits the association of BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-associated
  receptor kinase 1 (BAK1) and FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE 2 (FLS2), which results in the
  stabilization of pre-miRNAs and reduces miRNA abundance []. HopT1-1 interferes directly
  with the RNA silencing machinery by inhibiting the function of AGO1 []. Nucleotide-binding
  site-leucine-rich repeats (NBS-LRRs), TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1) and
  COP1-interacting protein 4 (CIP4) are known targets of miRNAs that are affected
  by RNA silencing suppressors of P. syringae. (b) The known RNA silencing suppressors
  of Phytophthora sp. PSR1, a P. sojae-specific RNA silencing suppressor, interacts
  with PIP1. PIP1 is required for the correct assembly of the Dicing-bodies, which
  are the protein complexes that include DCL1. The destabilization of the Dicing-body
  results in reduced miRNA accumulation. PSR2 is conserved in several Phytophthora
  species. [,]. It binds and inhibits DRB4. DRB4 acts in the phasiRNA pathway, and
  PSR2 specifically reduces phasiRNAs that are secreted—likely via extracellular vesicles.

  and sporulation of the pathogen []. (c) The function of the recently identified
  RNA silencing suppressor of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt). PgtSR1 (SR1)
