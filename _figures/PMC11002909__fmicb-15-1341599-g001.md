caption: 'The enterovirus life cycle depends heavily on diverse host machinery. Step
  1. Entry: The three main steps by which EV71 virus particles enter the host cell
  are adhesion onto the host cell surface, binding of viral particles to cell receptors,
  and entry of viral particles into cells through endocytic pathways. Step 2. Uncoating
  and genome release: under the influence of the pH environment of the host cell,
  the virus sheds its shell and releases its genome. Step 3. Translation and cleavage
  of viral polyprotein: under the influence of various host proteins, translation
  of viral RNA is initiated and the resulting polyprotein is cleaved to obtain the
  structural and non-structural proteins. Step 4. Replication of viral genomes: viral
  genome replication requires the participation of a large number of host factors
  and viral proteins to complete the formation of replication organelles (ROs) and
  genome replication. Step 5. Assembly and release of viral particles: the assembly
  of viral particles also requires coordination between various viral and host proteins.
  After the assembly, the virus particles are released into the extracellular space
  in various ways to initiate the next round of infection'
