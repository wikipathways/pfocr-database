caption: Overall metabolic pathway integration and targets for intervention. Only
  metabolic pathways and inhibitors discussed in this review are shown. Adaptations
  unique to specific kinetoplastids and differences between mammalian and parasite
  metabolism are not displayed. Cofactors, additional reactants, conversion of oxaloacetate
  to pyruvate and pyruvate to oxaloacetate, energy cost, and urea and CO2 production
  are also not drawn. Targeting of parasite versus host metabolic pathways are not
  differentiated, because this is often hard to distinguish when nonselective inhibitors
  are used. Metabolites are boxed.
