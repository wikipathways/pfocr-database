caption: Diagrammatic sketch shows the hypothetical mechanism of HOTAIR in digestive
  tract cancers. HOTAIR interacts with PRC2 complex (Suz12/EED/EZH2) to methylate
  H3K27 and silence WIF-1 expression, further inducing activation of Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. HOTAIR acts as competing endogenous RNA to sponge miR-331-3p,
  which represses HER2 expression by binding to HER2 mRNA 3′UTR. HOTAIR can be released
  to blood from cells and serve as biomarker.
