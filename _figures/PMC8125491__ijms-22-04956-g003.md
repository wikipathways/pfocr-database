caption: 'The landscape of synergic epigenetic interactions with MAPK signaling pathway
  in PD development. (A) MAPK signaling pathway is activated due to abnormal accumulation
  of α-synuclein, which activates glial cells and inflammatory cytokines. (i) Hypomethylation
  of the intron 1 of SNCA locus dysregulates SNCA gene transcription, leading to abnormal
  α-synuclein aggregation in the cytoplasm. This allows abnormal α-synuclein to enter
  the nucleus following oxidative stress and sequester DNMT1 into the cytoplasm, enhancing
  the hypomethylation of SNCA gene and causing dysregulated transcription. (ii) Meanwhile,
  HDAC inhibitors cause hyperacetylation of α-synuclein linked histones H2, H3, H4,
  and p300 promoter region of SNCA to induce α-synuclein aggregation. (iii) Synergic
  interaction of DNMT1, circSNCA, and cirs-7a suppresses miR-7 expression, which upregulated
  SNCA gene expression to trigger α-synuclein accumulation. (B) Similarly, LncHOTAIR1
  and lncMALAT1 interact with miR-205 to overexpress LRRK2 and activates MAPK signaling
  pathway. (C) miR-34b/c interacts with PARK2 and DJ-1 to inhibit their neuroprotective
  role and activates glia cells. miR-494 and miR-4639 downregulate DJ-1 activity and
  upregulate nitric oxide ten folds to promote neuroinflammation. Moreover, lower
  expression of PGC-1α also contributes to MAPK signaling pathway activation. Altogether,
  these epigenetic mechanisms interact with each other and with MAPK signaling pathways
  to induce neuroinflammation in PD development. Note: ↓ shows downregulated expression,
  and ↑ shows an upregulated expression.'
