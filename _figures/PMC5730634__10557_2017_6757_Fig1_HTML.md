caption: Potential effects of vascular disease treatment on pMV release. Increase
  in intraplatelet calcium concentration is the principal step in pMV formation. ADP
  receptor inhibitors increase the intraplatelet concentration of cAMP thereby decreasing
  platelet vesiculation. GP IIb-IIIa antagonists inhibit binding of fibrinogen thereby
  preventing the second wave of platelet activation. Statins inhibit platelet vesiculation
  multi-directional—reducing NF-κB activity and increasing exposure of PPARs and via
  the ROCK pathway. Fibrates as PPAR agonists increase the levels of both cAMP and
  cGMP and decrease calcium concentration. Calcium channel blockers inhibit calcium
  influx and decrease intracellular calcium concentration. Platelet-derived microvesicles
  transfer AA between platelets and ECs. Microvesicles also metabolize AA to TXA2.
