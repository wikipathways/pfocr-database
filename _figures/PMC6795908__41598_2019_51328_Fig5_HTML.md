caption: Protein-protein network analysis using the DE genes (log2 fold > 2 and < 2)
  in the transcriptomic profiles of the cows with PTB-associated lesions versus the
  control group. (a) Using the DE genes in the PB samples from the animals with focal
  lesions, two HBEGF-IL8 and TAC3-F2RL3 functional interactions were detected. (b)
  In the PB samples from the cows with diffuse lesions, two IL8 and COL1A2 centered
  networks were observed. (c) When the DE genes in the ICV transcriptomic profiles
  of the cows with focal lesions were used, a IL8 centered network was also obtained.
  (d) A MAPK8 centered network was retrieved when the DE genes in the ICV transcriptomic
  profile of the cows with diffuse lesions were searched in the STRING database. Individual
  nodes represent proteins with relationships represented by edges. The confidence
  score (>0.7) of each interaction is mapped to the edge thickness. The proteins with
  no associations to other proteins in the networks were hidden.
