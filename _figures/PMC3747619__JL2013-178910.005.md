caption: Status of different compartments in Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease
  condition, there is an upregulation of genes involved in the de novo ceramide synthesis
  (⚫) and downregulation of CERT (x). This contributes towards ER stress. CERK gene
  which generates C1P a progrowth molecule is downregulated (x). Down regulation of
  ceramidase might lead to accumulation of ceramide which is a proapoptotic molecule.
  Overall this scenario would result in ER stress and proapoptotic phenotype.
