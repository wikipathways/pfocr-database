caption: a | In the supportive vegetative nucleus of the Arabidopsis male gametophyte
  ddm1 expression is repressed which leads to the loss of cytosine methylation and
  reveals transposons. Transposons are processed into 21nt siRNA that are mobile and
  can direct PTGS in the sperm nuclei. They may also impact transposons transcriptionally
  by directing or inhibiting epigenetic modification. Red lollipops represent 5meC.
  b | The supportive central cell of the Arabidopsis female gametophyte reveals transposons
  for transcription by downregulating the maintenance DNA methyltransferase MET1 and
  expressing the DNA glycosylase DEMETER causing a loss of cytosine methylation. This
  activates the RdDM pathway and produces 24nt siRNA that may be transported to the
  egg cell to enforce transcriptional silencing through AGO9. Red lollipops represent
  5meC. c | In the Drosophila ovariole the flamenco cluster is expressed in somatic
  follicle cells, and generates piRNA independently of the ping-pong cycle. Loaded
  Piwi silences the gypsy family of retrotransposons which could otherwise form infectious
  particles. In oocytes and surrounding nurse cells all piRNA clusters are expressed
  and the primary transcripts enter the ping-pong cycle to produce piRNA. Active transposons
  are post-transcriptionally silenced, and nuclear Piwi promotes transcriptional silencing
  via H3K9 methylation, and HP1a localization. The HP1a homolog Rhino binds to heterochromatic
  piRNA clusters in place of HP1a and promotes transcription.
