caption: Pharmacological interventions against NLRP3 inflammasome. Graphical representation
  depicting the simplified mechanism of action of the most representative investigated
  drugs that target the NLRP3 inflammasome machinery. The drugs were classified into
  three groups depending upon which of the phases of the chronological pathway for
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation they exert their inhibitory action, namely, phase
  I or priming, NLRP3 protein oligomerization, and phase II or activation. At the
  bottom of the image, a table summarizes the current state of development of the
  different molecules and drugs, according to the literature. Created with BioRender.com.
