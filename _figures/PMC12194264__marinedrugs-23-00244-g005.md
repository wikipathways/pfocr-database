caption: Schematic diagram of fucoxanthin biosynthetic pathway in algae. (Redrawn
  based on the literature by Mikami [34] and Liang [35]) Carotenoid biosynthesis begins
  with the head-to-tail linkage of two C20 geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) molecules,
  which are catalyzed by the pys synthase to form phytoene. The synthesis process
  of lycopene and its associated enzymes are relatively conserved across all algae.
  Through the catalytic action of a series of enzymes, fucoxanthin is ultimately synthesized.
  The “?” in the diagram indicates an unknown enzyme in this synthetic pathway, signifying
  that the identity of this enzyme remains uncharacterized in algae. "*" indicates
  that the enzyme is unknown in algae. The five key enzymes involved in fucoxanthin
  biosynthesis selected in this experiment are highlighted in gray in the figure
