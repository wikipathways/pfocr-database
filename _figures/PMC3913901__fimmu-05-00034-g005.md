caption: Differential activation of NF-κB pathways by TWEAK based on strength of Fn14
  signaling. TWEAK can signal either in a juxtacrine manner, as a membrane-bound ligand,
  mTWEAK (A), or in a paracrine manner as a soluble ligand, sTWEAK (B,C). Depending
  on the concentration of ligand or receptor, or the propensity of the Fn14 ligand
  to oligomerize the receptor and form signaling clusters, differential activation
  of the NF-κB pathways occurs. (A) During juxtacrine signaling, mTWEAK favors the
  clustering of Fn14 on the opposite cell, leading to hyperactive signaling for which
  canonical NF-κB signaling predominates over non-canonical signaling. MAPK activation
  also occurs. (B) Under physiological conditions, low endogenous levels of sTWEAK
  signal in a paracrine manner, leading predominantly to non-canonical NF-κB activation.
  (C) However, under certain pathological or experimental conditions, sTWEAK can also
  lead to hyperactive signaling leading to canonical NF-κB and MAPK signaling. For
  example, high concentrations of TWEAK, applied to myoblasts or myotubes ex vivo,
  hinder differentiation and cause atrophy, respectively. Transgenic over-expression
  of TWEAK in mice also leads to pathological consequences. In a variety of injury
  states (such as denervation-induced muscle atrophy), the receptor Fn14 is induced,
  which then is followed by and pathological responses to endogenous levels of TWEAK.
  Furthermore, recombinant TWEAK fusion proteins with the ability to multimerize,
  or Fn14 agonistic antibodies, can both promote receptor clustering and the activation
  of the canonical NF-κB pathway. The pathways leading to pathological activation
  of the canonical NF-κB pathway are still poorly defined, but are thought to arise
  either from pathway cross-talk, such as that seen with NIK or IKK activation of
  the canonical mediators, or through the adaptor and E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. In
  addition, activation of MAPK pathways may also contribute to the pathology observed.
