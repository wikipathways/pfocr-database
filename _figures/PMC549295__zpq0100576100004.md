caption: A schematic model for the lysis–lysogeny decision process. (A) Elements of
  the λ genetic network participating in the lysogenic response. (B) Elements of the
  λ genetic network active during the lytic pathway. Arrows denote positive actions,
  and bars denote negative actions. A bar also denotes the threshold or cooperativity
  effect delaying Q activity. Both schemes focus on functions studied in this work.
  (Promoters are shown in green, and proteins are shown in orange.) Black connecting
  lines represent parts of the network operating in both the lytic and the lysogenic
  response. (C) Simplified kinetic model suggested by our experiments in which CII
  (blue line) activates CI synthesis (green line) and represses Q activity (red line)
  during a lysogenic response. When insufficient levels of CII are accumulated, the
  lytic response is the default of the genetic network.
