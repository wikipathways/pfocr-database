caption: 'Native pathway of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis present in M. maripaludis.
  As shown, electrons from 2 mol H2 are split between reducing ferredoxin and regenerating
  coenzymes B and M. Reduced ferredoxin from this reaction links it to CO2 reduction,
  the first step in the pathway. Enzyme names are shown in blue. Metabolites: Fdrd,
  reduced ferredoxin; Fdox, oxidized ferredoxin; MFR, methanofuran; HSCoM, coenzyme
  M; HSCoB, coenzyme B. Enzymes: Fwd, formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase; Ftr, formylmethanofuran-H4MPT
  formyl transferase; Mch, methenyl-H4MPT cyclohydrolase; Hmd, H2-dependent methylene-H4MPT
  dehydrogenase; Mtd, F420-dependent methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase; Mer, methylene-H4MPT
  reductase; Mtr, methyl-H4MPT coenzyme M methyltransferase; Mcr, methyl coenzyme
  M reductase; Hdr, heterodisulfide reductase; Eha/Ehb, energy-conserving hydrogenases;
  ATPS, ATP-synthase; Fru, F420-reducing hydrogenase (selenocysteine containing);
  Frc, F420-reducing hydrogenase (cysteine containing).'
