caption: 'Regulation of MAPK signaling pathways by HERC1: (A) HERC1 polyubiquitylates
  C-RAF with a lysine 48-linked chain that causes its degradation by the proteasome
  and downregulates ERK activity; (B) in the absence of HERC1, the levels of C-RAF
  increase and upregulate the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. The levels of MKK3 also
  increase, which in turn phosphorylates and activates p38. In summary, therefore,
  the absence of HERC1 may enhance cell responses regulated by these MAPKs, including
  the migration, differentiation, growth, proliferation, and survival of cells.'
