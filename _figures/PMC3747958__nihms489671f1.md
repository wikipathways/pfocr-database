caption: Activation of the M-CSF receptor c-Fms promotes proliferation and survival
  of osteoclast precursors. RANK stimulation leads to activation of NF-κB signaling,
  the PI3K-Akt axis as well as all three MAPK pathways, namely ERK, JNK and p38. While
  the Akt signaling pathway is crucial for survival of precursor and mature osteoclasts,
  the activation of both the NF-κB complex and the transcription factor AP-1 is critical
  for osteoclast differentiation. Phosphorylation of ITAM stimulated by immunoreceptors
  leads to the activation of calcium signaling, an event also induced by RANK activation,
  which is critical for NFAT induction. NFAT may interact with other transcription
  factors induced by MAPK, MITF and PU.1, thus acting as nuclear effectors and leading
  to gene expression and optimal osteoclastogenesis.
