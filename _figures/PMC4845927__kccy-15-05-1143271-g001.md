caption: Upper part, the Sphingolipid pathway in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
  Enzymes enclosed in yellow boxes have been shown to be involved in sporulation,
  pheromone response, or in cell cycle regulation. Lag1 and Lac1 are involved in α-factor
  response and shmoo formation according to the new study by Villasmil et al. Enzymes
  in blue are part of the de-novo pathway. The enzymes in red are part of the catabolic
  pathways. Lower part, schematic model representing sphingolipids and their influence
  on the cell cycle. Sphingoid bases; phytoceramides and C18:1 phytoceramide and their
  targets in the cell cycle.
