caption: 'Cysteine is a core player in the cellular metabolism. (A) Cysteine is imported
  as cystine or as cysteine. Cysteine plays a pivotal role in cancer: it is incorporated
  in glutathione, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger; upon degradation in cytosol
  or in mitochondria, it supplies carbon and energy metabolism through FA and AA syntheses,
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, one carbon metabolism and the production of ATP
  through the ETC, and it contributes for sulfur and energy production as a generator
  of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a donor of electrons (e−) to ETC. (B) The one carbon
  metabolism is composed by the folate cycle and the methionine cycle. Serine, needed
  to start the folate cycle, can be glucose (serine synthesis pathway—SSP) or glutamine-originated.
  Serine originates glycine, which reacts with folic acid-derived tetrahydrofolate
  (THF), originating 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5, 10-MTHF), which is converted
  into 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) or 10-methyltetrahydrofolate (10-MTHF). 5-FTHF
  reacts with vitamin B12 (Vit B12) and homocysteine (hCysteine), forming THF and
  methionine. 10-FTHF is incorporated in the synthesis of purines, essential for nucleotides
  synthesis. In the methionine cycle, methionine is converted sequentially into S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM), and to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). The consequent release of a methyl group
  (CH3) will supply the methylation of DNA, DNA and histones. SAH is converted into
  hCysteine keeping on the methionine cycle, or it is deviated to the pyrimidines
  synthesis and consequently to nucleotides synthesis. Cysteine is de novo synthesized
  in the transsulfuration pathway (TSP), linking cysteine to the methionine cycle.
  The hCysteine, is converted into cystathionine through the condensation with serine.
  Cystathionine is hydrolyzed to cysteine and other organic compounds (e.g., α-ketoglutarate
  or propionate). Cysteine can be degraded and originate (directly or not) pyruvate,
  α-glutarate, α-ketobutyrate, serine, propionyl-CoA, succinate, and acetyl-CoA to
  supply the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, amino acids synthesis or the fatty acids
  synthesis. (C) Glycolysis is the degradation of a glucose molecule into 2 pyruvate
  molecules, through a sequence of reactions, having three irreversible steps catalyzed
  by hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and pyruvate kinase (PK). Gluconeogenesis
  is almost a reversion of glycolysis and cysteine-derived pyruvate is converted in
  glucose. The reversible steps are common to glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and are
  catalyzed by enolase, phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK),
  Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), aldolase, and Glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase (GPI). The three irreversible steps of glycolysis impose gluconeogenesis
  to use four other enzymes: PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PKC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase;
  FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase; and G6PC, glucose 6-phosphatase. Gluconeogenesis
  is regulated by Nrf2, Kras, Pi3K, Wnt, and HIF1. Besides being an intermediate of
  glycolysis and gluconeogenesis glucose 6-phosphate is the substrate of phosphate
  pentose pathway (PPP), which has two biochemical branches (an oxidative and a non-oxidative
  branch) of reversible reactions. The non-oxidative branch of PPP uses glucose-6-phosphate
  to generate ribulose5-phosphate for AA and nucleotides synthesis. While the oxidative
  branch of PPP generates NADPH, involving the action of glutathione (GSH) reductase
  and the interplay with reductive biosynthesis, namely FA synthesis. PPP is regulated
  by Nrf2, Pi3K, Wnt, NFkB, and Myc.'
