caption: 'Effects of CAR-T cells delivery system in cancer. a CAR-T cells enter in
  tumor area and cause the first killing: CAR-T cells recognize CAR antigens in a
  major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent manner and mediate secretory
  killing and non-secretory killing. b Reprogramming tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment
  and stimulating endogenous T cells: CAR-T cells deliver EV-based gene therapy to
  limit the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and inhibit TGF-β1
  signaling pathway. Meanwhile, it also promotes the development of inflammatory dendritic
  cells (DCs) and an activation of endogenous T cells. c Turning “cold tumor” to “hot
  tumor” for glioblastoma: CAR-T cells deliver peptide antigen to cancer cells with
  CAR antigen loss and totally relieve the immune escape of tumor cells through endogenous
  immunity'
