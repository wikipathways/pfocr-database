caption: Schematic illustration of synthesis of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from glutamine
  directly and via tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolism. Glutamine is converted
  to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG) and pathway 1 illustrates
  direct synthesis of GABA from glutamate in the cytosol. GABA synthesis via this
  pathway is as indicated governed by both GAD65 and GAD67. Pathway 2 shows the deamination
  of glutamate and metabolism of α-ketoglutarate in the TCA cycle before GABA synthesis
  catalyzed by GAD67. GAD, glutamate decarboxylase.
papertitle: Knockout of GAD65 has major impact on synaptic GABA synthesized from astrocyte-derived
  glutamine.
