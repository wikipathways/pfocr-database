caption: Glycogen metabolism. Breakdown of glycogen results in glucose-1 phosphate
  which is then converted to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by phosphoglucomutase. G6P
  can enter the glycolysis pathway and used as a source of energy. Using glucose-6-phosphatase
  (G6Pase), G6P can be hydrolyzed to glucose via gluconeogenesis and subsequently
  released into the blood. Glucose-6-phosphate can also be taken by PPP and converted
  to NADPH or ribose in a variety of tissues.
