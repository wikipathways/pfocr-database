caption: A model for plant mitochondrial biogenesis. Levels of mitochondrial components
  and functions are indicated by heat map colouration, with yellow indicating low
  levels and red indicating high levels. During germination promitochondria present
  in dry seeds, that have a simple ultrastructure, undergo morphological differentiation,
  such as cristae development, in both the presence and absence of oxygen. Components
  of the mitochondrial protein import apparatus (TOM and TIM) are at high levels in
  promitochondria, decrease to low levels in the presence of oxygen but decrease to
  a lesser extent under anaerobic conditions. Paradoxically, the capacity of the general
  import pathway (GIP) increases during germination under aerobic conditions but does
  not increase under anaerobic conditions. The capacity of the carrier import pathway
  (CIP) remains at similar levels regardless of developmental stage or oxygen availability.
  Levels of TCA cycle enzymes and some components of the respiratory chain (complexes
  I–V and cytochrome c) are at very low levels in promitochondria, increase substantially
  under aerobic conditions, and to a lesser extent in the absence of oxygen, driven
  by the transcriptional response of their respective nuclear encoded genes (aerobic
  genes). In plants, the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) is integrated into
  complex III (bc1 complex) of the respiratory chain and the increase in its abundance
  during germination is dependent on oxygen. This correlates with the capacity of
  the general import pathway, suggesting a mechanistic link between respiration and
  mitochondrial protein import.
