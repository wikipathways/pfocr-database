caption: 'Summarized natural and heterologous pathways for beta-carotene production
  investigated herein. (A). V. natriegens naturally encodes the MEP (2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate)
  pathway (green, left). The L. acidophilus MVA (mevalonate) pathway was heterologously-expressed
  to provide more IPP/DMAPP precursor (yellow, right). These precursors eventually
  fed into the heterologously-expressed V. campbellii beta-carotene biosynthesis pathway
  (blue, bottom). Heterologously-expressed genes (by common/heterologous names) are
  in bold red; see ,  for gene IDs and enzyme names. (B). Layout of plasmids pJV-ß-carotene
  (top) and pJV-ß-carotene-MVA (top plus bottom). Beta-carotene biosynthetic genes
  overlap. Abbreviations: G-3-P, D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate;
