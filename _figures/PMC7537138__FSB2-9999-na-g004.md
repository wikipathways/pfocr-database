caption: Integrated signaling pathway and summary of events promoted by SARS‐CoV‐2
  infection in human cells. This scheme describes the cellular response to SARS‐CoV‐2
  entry into the cell mediated by ACE2, which can be modulated by estrogen signaling
  via transcriptional pathway. Under a pro‐inflammatory response, RAGE can be stimulated
  by AGE, PAMP, S100A, or HMGB1, which activates NADPH and PLC (phospholipase C).
  NADPH elevates intracellular ROS levels, which may act in the PI3K‐AKT or AGT (angiotensin)
  pathway. The PLC activates the PKC, which activates the signaling pathways of ERK
  1/2, JNK, and PI3K‐AKT. This results in activation of NF‐κB and ERK 1/2 that ends
  in AP1 and gene transcription. Regarding renin‐angiotensin signaling, AGT and AngA
  (angiotensin A) stimulate ATR1, leading to the activation of PI3K‐AKT signaling
  pathway, promoting eNOS release. In turn, ATR1 also activates the SRC (proto‐oncogene
  non‐receptor tyrosine kinase), which activates Shc‐Ras and finally MEK‐ERK 1/2,
  heading to gene transcription. The estrogen pathway can also interfere with the
  internalization of SARS‐CoV‐2, due to its modulation of ACE2 gene transcription
  via Raf‐MEK‐ERK 1/2 pathway, which can be mediated by nuclear membrane receptors
  or associated with G protein. Adapted from KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes) and Xiang et al Therefore, according to literature data, here, we propose
  that estrogen receptors activation may participate in modulation of ACE2 levels
  and modulation of RAGE cell response, which in turn could reduce inflammation in
  COVID‐19
