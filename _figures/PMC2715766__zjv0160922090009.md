caption: G protein-dependent and G protein-independent signaling activities of M33.
  Use of pharmacological and genetic inhibitors at multiple steps along the Gq/11signaling
  pathway reveals that CREB activation by the MCMV GPCR M33 is mediated by coupling
  to heterotrimeric Gq/11 proteins and PLC-β activity. Moreover, while not affected
  by IP3 and Ca2+ levels, CREB activity is dependent on PKC activity and is augmented
  by increased levels of DAG. Conversely, M33 stimulation of p38 (which may partially
  contribute to M33-induced CREB activity) and NF-κB occurs in the absence of Gq/11signaling
  through an as-yet-defined mechanism(s).
