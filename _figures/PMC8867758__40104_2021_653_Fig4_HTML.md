caption: Mechanisms of ZEA toxicity regulated by miRNAs. After ZEA is exposed to the
  cell membrane, it activates PKC through the membrane surface protein GRP30, and
  induces cytotoxicity by activating the P38 signaling pathway. Overexpressed miR-7
  can recognize the synthesis and secretion of FSH through targeted regulation of
  FOS gene expression, which seriously affects the normal estrogen secretion of female
  animals and induces ZEA toxicity. ZEA triggers apoptosis and cytotoxicity by activating
  the apoptotic executioner caspase3, which is specifically manifested as the overexpression
  of intracellular miR-1343, miR-331-3p, and miR-744, the expression level of PaK4
  and ElK1 decreases, and the expression of Bad rise
