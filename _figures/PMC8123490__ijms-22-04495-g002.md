caption: 'NAFLD development is caused by an imbalance in the intrahepatocellular fatty
  acid (FA) metabolism. Hepatic TG accumulation is promoted when the FA input is greater
  than the FA output in the liver. The greater part of FA taken up by liver is mainly
  derived from the lipolysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue TG. Another major source
  of FA in the liver is derived from de novo lipogenesis that converts excess glucose
  into FAs. On the other hand, the consumption of FA is possible through the signaling
  pathway involved in lipolysis, β-oxidation, and TG secretion (→: signaling pathways
  related with TG accumulation by FA, →: signaling pathways related with the consumption
  of FA).'
