caption: A regulatory scheme for plant and algal photosystem stoichiometry adjustment.
  Photosynthetic electron transport is depicted diagrammatically, with electrons flowing
  from photosystem II (PS II) to photosystem I (PS I) via cytochrome b6f complex (cyt
  b6f). PC is plastocyanin, Fd, ferredoxin, and FNR, ferredoxin NADP+ reductase. ‘PEP’
  stands for plastid-encoded RNA polymerase, and SIG1 phosphatase is the predicted
  protein phosphatase that dephosphorylatates phospho-sigma factor 1 (SIG1). The plastoquinone
  (PQ) pool regulates the transcription of photosystem genes via chloroplast sensor
  kinase (CSK). Adapted from []. (a) Light 1, which preferentially excites PS I, causes
  transient oxidation of the PQ pool. The oxidized PQ pool activates CSK, which then
  phosphorylates itself and the SIG1 subunit of PEP. This results in specific repression
  of PS I genes and, as a result, the stoichiometry of PS I to PS II decreases. (b)
  Light 2, selective for PS II, shifts the PQ pool momentarily to a more reduced state.
  CSK becomes inactive as a SIG1 kinase in this condition. In the absence of this
  kinase activity, the SIG1 phosphatase steadily dephosphorylates phospho-SIG1, thus
  removing the repression of PS I gene transcription. As a result the stoichiometry
  of PS I to PS II increases.
