caption: 'Mechanism of QE action. Notes: Quercetin inhibited the secrete of TGF-β1,
  which affected the TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
  When TGF-β1 bound with its trans-membrane receptors, Smad2 and Smad3 were activated
  and form a complex with Smad4.The complex then moved into the nuclear and regulate
  its downstream effectors. At the same time, quercetin activated the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway, which also took actions to modulate cellular actions. These two pathway
  had a complex cross talk in cytoplasma, and finally inhibited autophagy progression.'
