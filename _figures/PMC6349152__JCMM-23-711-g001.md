caption: 'The role of SUMO in kidney fibrosis. SUMO may be involved in the progression
  of kidney diseases via at least three pathways: the SUMOylation of the set of TGF‐β
  signalling (Smad3, Smad4 and TGFβR1), the SUMOylation of the set of HIF‐1α pathway
  (HIF‐1α, VHL and PHD), and the competitive processes of the Metabolism (Glucose,
  FAO and TCA) and subsequently stimulates inflammatory factor, activates fibroblast,
  facilitates tubular EMT, forms metabolic handicap, and induces apoptosis, which
  finally leads to the kidney fibrosis'
