caption: Possible signaling roles of S-persulfidation in vasorelaxation. Neurons and
  ECs-released NO dilates VSMCs. In VSMCs, enhancement of K+ efflux through KATP or
  KCa channel hyperpolarizes cell membrane and induces vasodilation. The red P-SSH
  in KATP channel Kir6.1 and SUR1 subunits and in TRPV4 channel represents S-persulfidation
  of these channel proteins. The red cross (+) represents opening of the channels.
  The activation of GC/cGMP/PKC pathway inhibits SRs Ca2+ release and induces vasodilation.
  In ECs, S-persulfidation-induced Keap1 activation releases Nrf2, which undergoes
  nuclear translocation and induces the expression of HO-1, NQO-1, and GCLM. S-Persulfidation-induced
  SP1 activation promotes VEGF and NRP-1 expression, thus eliminating aging and DM-induced
  AS. AS, atherosclerosis; ECs, endothelial cells; GCLM, glutamate-cysteine ligase
