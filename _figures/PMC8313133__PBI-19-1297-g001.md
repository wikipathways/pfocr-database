caption: 'An overview of CTK biosynthesis (a); CTK translocation (b); general characteristics
  of two known CTKs biosynthesis pathways in angiosperms (c) and, the mode of action
  of IPTs in drought tolerance in Arabidopsis (d). (a) CTK types derived from two
  known pathways, adenylate (ATP/ADP‐IPTs and AMP‐IPTs) and tRNA types (adapted from
  Hirose et al. (), further details in Sakakibara ()). ADP: adenosine 5’‐diphosphate;
  ATP: adenosine 5’‐triphosphate; tRNA: Transfer ribonucleic acid; DMAPP: dimethylallyl
  diphosphate; IPT: isopentenyl transferase; CYP735A: cytochrome P450 monooxygenase,
  family 735, subfamily A (cytokinin trans‐hydroxylase); LOG: cytokinin phosphoribohydrolase
  ‘Lonely guy’; cZ: cis‐Zeatin, cZR: cZ riboside; cZRMP: cZ riboside 5’‐monophosphate,
  DZ: Dihydrozeatin, DZR: DZ riboside; DZRMP: DZ riboside 5’‐monophosphate; iP: isopentenyladenine;
  iPR: iP riboside; iPRMP: isopentenyladenosine‐5’–monophosphate; iPRDP: isopentenyladenosine‐5''‐diphosphate;
  iPRTP: isopentenyladenosine‐5''‐triphosphate; tZ: trans‐Zeatin, tZR: tZ riboside,
  tZRDP: tZ riboside 5’‐diphosphate; tZRMP: tZ riboside 5’‐monophosphate; tZRTP: tZ
  riboside 5’‐triphosphate. (b) Translocation of CTKs in plant. As multifunctional
  and mobile signalling molecules, active CTKs and their derivatives contribute to
  various developmental processes depending on CTK transport proteins across vascular
  tissues. Briefly, three kinds of CTK transporters have been systematically characterized:
  equilibrate nucleoside transporters (ENT), purine permeases (PUP), and G subfamily
  ATP‐binding cassette (ABCG) transporters (Durán‐Medina et al., ). tZR is the primary
  form of xylem transported CTKs, and iPR and cZR are major forms of phloem CTKs (Osugi
  and Sakakibara, ). Arabidopsis plant vector is adapted, with permission, from Figshare
  (Bouché, ). (c) General mode of action of two IPT GFMs (ATP/ADP‐IPTs and tRNA‐IPTs)
  in angiosperms (Köllmer et al ; Miyawaki et al ; Wang et al., ). The investigation
  in Arabidopsis mutants showed that ATP/ADP‐IPT GFMs control biosynthesis of iP‐
  and tZ‐type CTKs while tRNA‐type IPT genes regulate cZ‐type CTKs (Köllmer et al.,
  ; Miyawaki et al., ). In the basal angiosperm Amborella trichopoda (Amborellaceae),
  and in Fragaria vesca (wild strawberry), eudicot woodland strawberry, transcriptomic
  analysis indicated that tRNA‐IPTs are constitutively expressed throughout the plant,
  whereas the expression of ATP/ADP‐IPTs is tissue‐specific and rapidly down‐regulated
  by abiotic stresses (Wang et al., ). Generally, tRNA‐IPTs and the associated cZ‐type
  CTKs play a housekeeping role, whereas ATP/ADP‐IPTs and associated iP/tZ‐type CTKs
  play regulatory roles in organ development and stress responses in angiosperms (Köllmer
  et al., ; Miyawaki et al., , ; Wang et al., ). (d) The negative regulatory role
  of IPT‐repressed CTKs in osmotic stress tolerance in Arabidopsis. Arrowheads represent
  activation, and perpendicular bars indicate inhibition. Studies of drought stress
  tolerance using CTK‐deficient plants, such as the quadruple ATP/ADP‐ipt1,3,5,7 loss‐of‐function
  mutants, CTK signalling mutants [AHP mutants (Arabidopsis Histidine Phosphotransfer
  Proteins 2,3,5) and ARR mutants (type B Arabidopsis Response Regulators 1,10,12)],
  and down‐regulated expression of five ATP/ADP‐IPT genes (IPT1, IPT4, IPT5, IPT6,
  IPT8) found in the AtMYB2 (ABA‐dependent signalling pathway) overexpressor, have
  indicated that CTK‐depleted mutants have improved drought acclimation/adaptation
  (Guo and Gan, ; Nguyen et al., ; Nishiyama et al., , ; Werner et al., ). Briefly,
  reducing endogenous CTK lowers the output of the CTK signalling cascades (i.e. quadruple
  ipt1,3,5,7 down‐regulates expression of AHP2, AHP3, AHP5) leading to drought acclimation/adaptation.

  ARR: Arabidopsis response regulator; ROS: reactive oxygen species.'
