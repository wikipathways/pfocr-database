caption: Drought induces ABA accumulation, which promotes drought responses. ABA acts
  through receptors (PYR/PYL/RCAR) to inhibit PP2C repression of SnRKs, allowing SnRKs
  to phosphorylate downstream transcription factors (ABI3/ABI5 and others), which
  regulate genes for drought responses. ABA-activated OST1/SnRK2.6 also functions
  to regulate stomatal closure. There are several mechanisms of cross-talk between
  drought/ABA and BR pathways that involve the negative regulator of the BR pathway
  BIN2 and converge on BES1/BZR1. 1. ABA induces the expression of REM4.1 through
  SnRK2 and bZIP28; and REM4.1 acts to inhibit BRI1/BAK1 and thus BR signaling. 2.
  BAK1 and ABI1/PP2C oppositely regulate OST1/SnRK2.6 to modulate stomatal closure,
  providing another layer to BR–ABA cross-talk. 3. Under drought conditions, BIN2
  is active, which phosphorylates and activates SnRK2.2/2.3 and ABI5. 4. During stress
  conditions, BES1 is ubiquitinated by SINAT E3 ubiquitin ligases and targeted for
  degradation through selective autophagy via phospho-regulated autophagy receptor
  DSK2. Phosphorylation of DSK2 by BIN2 enhances DSK2–ATG8 interactions, therefore
  promoting BES1 degradation. 5. Drought and ABA activate NAC family transcription
  factor RD26 that inhibits BES1 activity to promote drought-induced (BR-repressed)
  genes and inhibit drought-repressed (BR-induced) genes. 6. In contrast, under BR-promoted
  growth conditions, BRI1 phosphorylates and inactivates REM4.1. 7. BR-activated BES1/BZR1
  inhibits ABI5 expression to inhibit ABA responses either through ABI3 (top) or by
  directly binding ABI5 promoter (bottom). 8. On the other hand, BES1 also inhibits
  RD26 transcriptional activity to promote BR-induced (drought-repressed) genes and
  inhibit drought-induced (BR-repressed) genes, thereby promoting BR-regulated growth.

  description: Drought induces ABA accumulation, which promotes drought responses.
    ABA acts through receptors (PYR/PYL/RCAR) to inhibit PP2C repression of SnRKs,
    allowing SnRKs to phosphorylate downstream transcription factors (ABI3/ABI5 and
    others), which regulate genes for drought responses. ABA-activated OST1/SnRK2.6
    also functions to regulate stomatal closure. There are several mechanisms of cross-talk
    between drought/ABA and BR pathways that involve the negative regulator of the
    BR pathway BIN2 and converge on BES1/BZR1. 1. ABA induces the expression of REM4.1
    through SnRK2 and bZIP28; and REM4.1 acts to inhibit BRI1/BAK1 and thus BR signaling.
    2. BAK1 and ABI1/PP2C oppositely regulate OST1/SnRK2.6 to modulate stomatal closure,
    providing another layer to BR–ABA cross-talk. 3. Under drought conditions, BIN2
    is active, which phosphorylates and activates SnRK2.2/2.3 and ABI5. 4. During
    stress conditions, BES1 is ubiquitinated by SINAT E3 ubiquitin ligases and targeted
    for degradation through selective autophagy via phospho-regulated autophagy receptor
    DSK2. Phosphorylation of DSK2 by BIN2 enhances DSK2–ATG8 interactions, therefore
    promoting BES1 degradation. 5. Drought and ABA activate NAC family transcription
    factor RD26 that inhibits BES1 activity to promote drought-induced (BR-repressed)
    genes and inhibit drought-repressed (BR-induced) genes. 6. In contrast, under
    BR-promoted growth conditions, BRI1 phosphorylates and inactivates REM4.1. 7.
    BR-activated BES1/BZR1 inhibits ABI5 expression to inhibit ABA responses either
    through ABI3 (top) or by directly binding ABI5 promoter (bottom). 8. On the other
    hand, BES1 also inhibits RD26 transcriptional activity to promote BR-induced (drought-repressed)
