caption: a) Conversion of d-glucose to d-mannose (158 → 159) in the biosynthesis of
  avilamycin by AviX12 – a radical SAM-dependent enzyme. b) Putative function of several
  radical SAM-dependent enzymes encoded in the neomycin, lividomycin, and paromomycin
  clusters. c) Methylation at unactivated carbon centers in gentamycin, fortimycin,
  and moenomycin biosynthesis may be carried out by a group of radical SAM/cobalamin-dependent
  enzymes. d) Proposed mechanism for Fom3, a radical SAM/cobalamin-dependent enzyme
  from the fosfomycin biosynthetic pathway of Streptomyces wedmorensis. e) Representative
  thio-, nitro- and hydroxylamine sugars found in several bacterial natural products.
  f) Putative involvement of Fms8 in 3,4-didehydroxylation of a fortimycin biosynthetic
  intermediate and the 2,3,6-trideoxysugar residue (176) found in tobramycin. g) Assembly
  of the 5-methyl-carboxypyrrole substituent (177) of cloromomycin and coumermycin
  using non-ribosomal peptide synthase biosynthetic logic. h) Biosynthesis of the
  unsual sugar substituent (183) in moenomycin. i) Unusual modifications required
  to synthesize the methyleurekanate moiety (184) of avilamycin A.
