caption: Signaling from growth factor receptors such as EGFR or a nutrient rich environment
  leads to an activation of the mTOR-pathway, while nutrient depletion inhibits signaling.
  The mTORC1-complex consists of the mTOR-protein itself and the subunits raptor (regulatory
  associated protein of mTOR), mLST8 (mammalian lethal with sec thirteen 8) and PRAS40
  (proline-rich Akt1 substrate 1). Activation of the pathway leads to phosphorylation
  of the ribosomal protein S6 at phospho-sites Ser235/236 and Ser240/244 by the S6-kinase
  (S6K). Additionally, the translational repressor 4EBP1 (eukaryotic initiation factor
  4E binding protein-1) is phosporylated at Thr37/Thr46, thereby relieving its translational
  inhibition and promoting translation especially of mRNAs with a TOP motif []. First
  generation mTORC1-inhibitors are rapamycin and its derivatives temsirolimus and
  everolimus. Mechanistically these compounds bind the intracellular adaptor protein
  FKBP12 to form an allosteric mTORC1 inhibitory complex. 4EBP1 phosphorylation though
  mTORC1-dependent is largely resistant to the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin and its
  derivatives. Recently, ATP-competitive mTORC (2nd generation) inhibitors like torin1
  and torin2 which are efficient in dephosphorylating 4EBP1 have been developed [].
