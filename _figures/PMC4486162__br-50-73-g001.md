caption: '. Extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. The extrinsic pathway is
  initiated by ligation of death receptors with death ligands. This interaction results
  in the formation of the death inducing signaling complex (DISC), which contains
  the death receptor, an adaptor molecule, and pro-caspase 8. Adaptor molecules possess
  a death domain (DD) and a death effector domain (DED). At the DISC, caspase 8 is
  autocatalytically activated and subsequently transmits the death signal to effector
  executioner caspases, resulting in apoptotic cell death. The intrinsic pathway signaling
  cascade is triggered by a number of factors, including DNA damage, hypoxia, growth
  factor deprivation, and ER stress. The death signal is sensed initially by the BH3-only
  protein, which then interacts with the downstream mediators of apoptosis (BAX and
  BAK). BAX and BAK undergo distinct conformational changes, which lead to the formation
  of mitochondrial pores or increases the permeability of the mitochondrial outer
  membrane, thereby releasing apoptogenic compounds, e.g. cytochrome c. Released cytochrome
  c binds to APAF-1 to facilitate formation of the apoptosome, a wheel-shaped heptameric
  complex, which can then recruit and activate pro-caspase 9. As a consequence, caspase
  9 activates effector caspases (caspase 3, 6, or 7) and eventually leading to apoptosis.
