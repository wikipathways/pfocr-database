caption: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT3), and Src-YES-associated protein 1 (YAP1) crosstalk. EGFR-activating
  mutations located in the tyrosine kinase domains and mainly in the form of a base-pair
  deletion at exon 19 (ΔE746_A750) or a point mutation at exon 21 (L858R) enhance
  cell growth and invasion via tyrosine phosphorylation and lead to the activation
  of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), STAT3, and AKT pathways. Ras-ERK signaling
  promotes cell growth and decreases apoptosis-related BIM expression. SHP2 modulates
  signals of receptor tyrosine kinases at the level of Ras. Phosphorylation of the
  tyrosine residue 705 of cytoplasmic STAT3 in response to activated EGFR promotes
  STAT3 homodimerization, which leads to nucleus translocation and DNA binding. IL-6
  signals via receptor complexes, which contain gp130, the common signal-transducing
  protein of the IL-6 family of cytokines and IL-6R. IL-6R is not a signal transducer,
  but its function is to present IL-6 to the signal-transducer gp130, resulting in
  phosphorylation of gp130 by JAK2 and recruitment of STAT3. In EGFR TKI–resistant
  cells, paracrine or autocrine stimulation of the TGF-β axis drives expression of
  IL-6 and activation of STAT3, unleashing the cells from their EGFR activity dependency.
  gp130 associates with Src and YES and triggers activation of YAP1 through phosphorylation
  on the tyrosine residue 357, independently of STAT3. YAP1 is normally kept inactive
  in the cytoplasm through phosphorylation on serine residue 127 by the Hippo effector
  kinase LATS. EGFR inhibition promotes immediate ubiquitination of TRAF2, which is
  essential for RIP1 and IKK activation, IkB phosphorylation, and degradation and
  NF-κB (RelA) nuclear translocation. NF-κB-induced IL-6 ensures STAT3 activation.
  TPCA-1 is a STAT3 inhibitor. AZD0530 (saracatinib) is a potent, orally administered
  small molecule that inhibits Src by blocking the ATP-binding site of Src kinases.
