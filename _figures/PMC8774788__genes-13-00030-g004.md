caption: 'Effect metformin on the AMPK signaling pathway predicted by IPA: the canonical
  AMPK signaling pathway was overlaid with dataset molecules to predict the downstream
  effect of AMPK activation. Predicted activation or inhibition of pathways is based
  on the relationships in the molecular network that represent experimentally observed
  association between genes and their functions in addition to the literature evidence
  in the IPA database.'
