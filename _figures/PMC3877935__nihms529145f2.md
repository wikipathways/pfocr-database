caption: 'The caspase cascade. A) Inflammatory caspase activation: a ligand binds
  to a toll-like receptor (TLR), which signals a NALP protein to bind to the TLR.
  ASC interacts with the pyrin domain (PYD) of NALP via PYD:PYD interactions. The
  CARD domain of ASC interacts with the CARD domain of procaspase-1 and the CARD domain
  of NALP interacts with the CARD domain of procaspase-5, forming the inflammasome.
  The inflammasome complex promotes dimerization of caspases-1 and -5, leading to
  their activation and the inflammatory response. B) The extrinsic apoptotic pathway:
  a death ligand binds to a death receptor, which signals an adaptor molecule to bind
  to the receptor via death domain (DD) interactions. The DED motif of the adaptor
  molecule interacts with the DED of procaspases-8 and -10, forming a DISC complex.
  Dimerization (mechanism unknown) results in maturation and full activity. Caspases-8
  and -10 then process executioner caspases. C) Procaspase-2, a unique caspase, is
  activated when a ligand binds to a death receptor, which signals an adaptor molecule
  to bind via interactions with the death domain. The CARD of the adaptor molecule
  interacts with the CARD of procaspase-2 to promote dimerization in a DISC-like complex.
  Upon removal of the prodomain, caspase-2 cleaves Bid, a protein responsible for
  the increased permeability of the mitochondria. D) The intrinsic apoptotic pathway:
  an increase in the cytosolic concentration of cytochrome c leads to the formation
  of the apoptosome. The apoptosome is composed of Apaf-1 monomers that form a heptameric
  structure when cytochrome c binds to the WD40 motifs of Apaf-1, in an ATP-dependent
  manner, leading to interactions of the CARDs. The CARD of procaspase-9 then interacts
  with the CARD of Apaf-1, increasing the local concentration of procaspase-9 monomers
  and thereby promoting dimerization and activation. Caspase-9 then processes effector
  caspases, which leads to apoptosis. Effector caspases are activated by cleavage
  of their prodomain and intersubunit linker.'
