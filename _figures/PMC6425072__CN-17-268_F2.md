caption: Neurotrophic factors and their receptors in dopamine neurons. Dopamine neurons
  express receptors of neurotrophins (TrkB and p75NTR), GFLs (GFRa and RET), potential
  distant GFL member GDF15 (GFRAL and RET), neurokines (gp130, LIFR, and CNTFR). Binding
  of all the afore-mentioned ligands leads to activation of intracellular signaling
  cascades promoting the survival of neuronal cells, neurite outgrowth and arborization,
  migration and differentiation of neuronal precursors. MANF and CDNF transmit signals
  intracellularly via unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways under endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress. The particular molecular mechanism of action of MANF and CDNF in the
  cells is poorly understood; however, these proteins can prevent neuronal death induced
  by ER stress, probably by inhibition of UPR. The ability of MANF and CDNF to protect
  and restore dopamine neurons when delivered externally implies the existence of
  a mechanism of their internalization either via yet undiscovered surface receptor
  (MANF/CDNFR) or via their documented interaction with lipids. Binding of proneurotrophins
  to p75NTR activates the JNK pathway and leads to cell death. (The color version
  of the figure is available in the electronic copy of the article).
