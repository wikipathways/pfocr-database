caption: Anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway and gene expression profiles in wild-type
  and mutant potato tuber skins. (a) A schematic representation of the anthocyanin
  biosynthesis pathway in potato. The upstream and intermediate steps follow the conserved
  phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthetic routes, whereas the final anthocyanin
  products were drawn based on compounds identified in this study. (b) A heatmap showing
  the transcript abundance of key structural and regulatory genes in WL, ML, WS, and
  MS samples. Expression levels are shown as Z-scores
