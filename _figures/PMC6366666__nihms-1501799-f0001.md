caption: TRAIL binds to its cell surface receptors DR4 and DR5 as a trimer. Receptor
  clustering and recruitment of FADD to intracellular the death domains starts formation
  of the DISC. Association of pro-caspase-8 finalizes DISC formation. Caspase-8 is
  cleaved to its active form. In type I cells, caspase-8 cleavage will directly cleave
  effector caspases 3, 6, and 7, triggering apoptosis. In type II cells, a secondary
  signal through the mitochondria is required. Caspase-8 will cleave Bcl-2 family
  protein Bid to its truncated form, tBid. This enables permeabilization of the mitochondrial
  outer membrane and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Pro-caspase-9 will
  be activated and go on to cleave effector caspases 3,6, and 7, leading to the induction
  of apoptosis.

    Pro-caspase-9 will be activated and go on to cleave effector caspases 3,6, and
