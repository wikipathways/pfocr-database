caption: Schematic diagram illustrating effect of the TWEAK/Fn14 axis on multipotent
  stem/progenitor cells. Binding of trimeric TWEAK to Fn14 receptor leads to the recruitment
  of cIAPs and various TRAFs resulting in the activation of multiple downstream signaling
  cascades. TWEAK stimulates the canonical NF-κB pathway which causes the proliferation
  of liver progenitor cells, differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells, and
  decreased proliferation and increased differentiation of neural progenitor cells,
  as well as increased proliferation and decreased differentiation of satellite cells
  and osteobalsts. TWEAK or TWEAK-activated canonical NF-κB can further activate Notch
  signaling resulting in decreased proliferation and differentiation of satellite
  cells but increased proliferation and differentiation of pancreatic duct epithelial
  cells. TWEAK also activates MAPK signaling cascades resulting in the activation
  of the AP-1 transcription factor to drive gene expression. The activated genes contribute
  to increased proliferation and decreased differentiation of satellite cells as well
  as decreased proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells. A20,
