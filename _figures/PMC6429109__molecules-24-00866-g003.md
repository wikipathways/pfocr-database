caption: (A) The initial transformation in the biosynthetic pathway for the phosphoramidate
  modification of the sugar residues in the bacterial capsular polysaccharides (CPS)
  proceeds via direct phosphorylation of the amide nitrogen of l-glutamine with ATP
  by a specific L-glutamine kinase (EC 2.7.3.13) to form N-phospho-l-glutamine (16).
  (B) Compound 16 is a precursor for P–N bond-containing sugar residues (17, 18) of
  the CPS and it is proposed to undergo a series of transformations before the formation
  of the final CPS product (with the formation of inorganic phosphoramidate (33) and
  3′-Phospho-5′-cytidine diphosphoramidate (34) as P–N bond-containing intermediates)
  [,,,]. Enzymes from Campylobacter jejuni CPS biosynthetic gene cluster with the
  known function in the CPS biosynthetic pathway are marked in bold font.
