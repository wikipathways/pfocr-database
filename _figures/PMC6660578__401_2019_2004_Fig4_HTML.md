caption: Genetic risk factors and synapse dysfunction in AD pathogenesis. Regulation
  of the focal adhesion pathway plays central roles in synaptic plasticity (synaptic
  maintenance, actin cytoskeleton remodelling, vesicle, and receptor cycling). Dysfunction
  of downstream cellular signalling pathways involving APP and/or Tau may thus participate
  in synapse loss. Additionally, dysregulation of the core FA pathway could modulate
  APP and Tau metabolisms, leading to an exacerbation of synaptotoxicity through Aβ
  overproduction and Tau-modulated excitotoxicity. Finally, Aβ availability at the
  synapses is dependent on its clearance through the blood brain barrier and/or by
  microglial cells
