caption: Bioenergenesis neurotransmitter pathways with differentially expressed genes
  between frontal cortex and hippocampus. A solid line with arrowhead indicates a
  direct reaction or transport. A dashed line with arrowhead indicates more than one
  steps involved in passages. The RNA levels of genes in red or green colors were
  expressed significantly higher or lower in the frontal cortex than in hippocampus,
  respectively. If the changes in RNA levels were not significant (p>0.05) or less
  than 1.25-fold, the gene symbols or enzymes are not shown in the flow chat. The
  mean expression levels, standard deviations, fold changes, p-values, false discovery
  rate (FDR) and the full name of genes are listed in Table . (A) Bioenergenesis neurotransmitter
  pathways include glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis
  in cytoplasm and β-oxidation, TCA cycle and OXPHOS, REDOX, and neurotransmitter
  synthesis in mitochondria. Double dashed lines represent the inner and outer mitochondrial
  membranes, of which a portion was enlarged to illustrate OXPHOS complexes I, II,
  III, IV and V with differentially expressed genes in each complex. A proton (H+)
  flow and ATP synthesis are indicated. REDOX enzymes (GPX1, GSTZ1 and PRDX1) are
  involved in removal of ROS (e.g. O2-). Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic enzymes with
  RNA levels higher in the frontal cortex than in hippocampus for synthesis of neurotransmitters
  (gray ovals) include Glud1 for synthesis of the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter
  L-glutamate, GAD1 and ABAT for the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric
  acid [GABA], DDC for dopamine, histamine and serotonin, and AGXT for serine and
  glycine. SLC25A18 and SLC25A22 are involved in transport of L-glutamate across mitochondrial
  membranes. (B) Insulin signaling pathway. Insulin binding to its receptor results
  in the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates. This leads to activation
  of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PIK3CB) and growth factor receptor-bound protein (GRB2).
  These in turn lead to upregulation of insulin-responsive genes including hexokinase
  2 (HK2) and MAP kinase interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (MKNK1). HK2 at the
  outer mitochondrial membrane phosphorylates glucose into glucose-6-phosphate, the
  first rate-limiting step of glycolysis pathway. MKNK1 in cytoplasm phosphorylates
  the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (EEIF4E) initiating protein synthesis,
  of which 18 of 25 genes displayed RNA levels higher in the frontal cortex than in
  hippocampus (Table ). MKNK1 also modifies proteins posttranslationally. ELK1 member
  of ETS oncogene family (ELK1) plays a critical role in mitogen growth factor signal
  transduction, and its downregulation suggests decreased activities in proliferation
  and differentiation. (C) PPARD signaling pathway. Peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor delta (PPARD) is a nuclear hormone receptor and transcriptional regulator.
  Retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA) is a steroid and thyroid hormone receptor and transcriptional
  regulator. Both PPARD and RXRA are involved in fatty acid transport and oxidation
  via binding to DNA and regulating transcription.
