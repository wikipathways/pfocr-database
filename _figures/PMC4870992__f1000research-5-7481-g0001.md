caption: 'Chronic exposure of the liver to injury from viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse
  or NASH causes repeated hepatocyte damage and sets up a vicious cycle of cell death
  and regeneration which eventually results in cirrhosis. The resultant genomic instability
  leads to initiation of HCC. Step wise accumulation of multiple genetic events including
  gene rearrangements, somatic mutations, copy number alterations, epigenetic changes
  and growth factor pathway alterations eventually lead to tumor progression and metastases.
  Abbreviations: Hep B, hepatitis B; Hep C, hepatitis C; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma;
  NASH, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.'
