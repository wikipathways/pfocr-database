caption: Signal pathway integration that regulates Hsp90 expression. Known signaling
  pathways that affect expression of Hsp90 and various scenarios for binding. Not
  shown is the co-activator Daxx, which is known to promote HSF1 activation. []. The
  blue rectangles represent the Hsp90 promotor regions upon which various combinations
  of transcription factors operate. STAT1 may function independently of HSF1 or with
  STAT3. IFN-γ, interferon-γ; IL-R, interleukin receptor; JAK, Janus kinase; MAPK,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase.
