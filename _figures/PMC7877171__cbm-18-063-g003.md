caption: The molecular mechanism by which intermittent fasting (IF) affects tumor
  cell growth. Mechanistically, IF inhibits the IGF-1/AKT and mTORC1 pathways in tumor
  cells, while the AMPK, SIRT1, and SIRT3 pathways are activated. In addition, AMPK
  and SIRTs depend on each other in IF-associated metabolic adaptation. However, AMPK
  can induce activation of SIRT1 through NAMPT, while SIRT1 can activate AMPK through
  LKB1 regulation. FOXO3a (a downstream molecule of SIRT1 and SIRT3) and AMPK can
  each enhance the other’s transcriptional activities. Furthermore, SIRT3 inhibits
  tumor growth by activating FOXO3a and the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD),
  thereby reducing the level of reactive oxygen species and negatively regulating
  the expression of HIF-1α. SIRT3 activates SOD2 via upregulation of FOXO3a. Furthermore,
  IF can selectively inhibit tumor growth by upregulating LEPR and its downstream
  signaling pathway protein, PRDM1.
