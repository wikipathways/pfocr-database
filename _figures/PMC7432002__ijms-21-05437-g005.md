caption: 'Interaction between IL-1β and I-kB kinase/NF-kB signalling pathway, which
  have positive activation of Nuclear Factor Kappa B Subunit 1. NF-kB is a pleiotropic
  transcription factor present in almost all cell types. It is the endpoint of a series
  of signal transduction events initiated by a vast array of stimuli related to many
  biological processes such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth,
  tumorigenesis and apoptosis. Positive activation of CASP8 (score: 0.900).'
