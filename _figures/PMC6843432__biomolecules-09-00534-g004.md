caption: Coordinated contribution of ROS and BMPs to vascular diseases. Vascular vessels
  are structures integrated by endothelial, smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and fibroblasts.
  In the endothelium, ROS are mainly produced by NOXs and its levels increase as a
  response to high pressure. In vascular vessels, ROS induce the expression of several
  BMPs, inactivates nitric oxide, and stimulate NF-κB pathway. By its part, BMPs activate
  MAPK pathways, increase NOX1/4 and COX2 expression and consequently enhance ROS
  generation. BMP6 and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) increase the expression
  of the osteoblast markers Osterix and Osteopontin in a NOX dependent manner. In
  SMCs, BMPs promotes the expression of the type III sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter
  PIT1, increases the activity of NOX, and the levels of osteogenic markers (RUNX2
  and ALPL).
