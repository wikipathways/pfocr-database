caption: Viral proteins induced evasion strategies by restricting the cGAS-STING axis.
  Several reported viral proteins dysregulate different checkpoints in the cGAS-STING
  pathway, such as invalidating the enzyme activity of cGAS or TBK1, obstructing STING
  activation, altering the modifications of key components. The corresponding viral
  proteins and their species are labeled in bold.
