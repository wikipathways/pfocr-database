caption: Proposed overall mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced anti-tumor immune response
  in lymphoma. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD probably binds to CD15, CD27, CD45, and CD152
  and may directly inhibit cell proliferation. Alternately, after binding to these
  CDs, SARS-CoV-2 may internalize into host cHL or FL cells. After entry into cancer
  cells, the M and ORF3a proteins block GCP2 –GCP3-TUBG1 interactions and thereby
  inhibit MT nucleation leading to cell-cycle arrest or cell death. Additionally,
  the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein may also interact with PD-1 to block PD-1 signaling,
  leading to cell-cycle arrest or cell death. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, Spike, NSP7, and
  NSP10 were also found to potentially interact with the TRADD binding motif of the
  EBV oncogenic LMP-1 protein. This interaction may also lead to the regulation of
  the NF-kB oncogenic signaling pathway in cHL or FL. The Figure is developed by BioRender
