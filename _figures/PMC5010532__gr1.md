caption: The adaptive UPR in Parkinson׳s disease. In PD the UPR is activated. MPTP
  or 6-OHDA treatments induce ATF6 activation, oxidative stress and ubiquitin inclusions,
  which inhibit the proteasome. ATF6 confers neuroprotection to DA neurons by promoting
  ERAD factors that target misfolded protein to the proteasome and XBP1, which further
  alleviates ER stress by inducing expression of chaperones. ATF6 also induces the
  expression of BDNF, HO-1 and xCT that protects DA neurons. ATF6-mediated protection
  is hampered by α-synuclein which interacts with ATF6, inhibiting its activation
  by interfering with trafficking of COPII vesicles. The PERK/ATF4 branch is also
  activated and contributes to neuroprotection by inducing the expression of Parkin
  which in turn promotes mitophagy. α-synuclein also associates with PERK and may
  interfere with its function. IRE1/XBP1 contributes to neuroprotection by inducing
  BiP expression which limits overactivation of PERK and proapoptotic CHOP expression.
  BiP can also be induced via LRRK2 and the p38 pathway.
