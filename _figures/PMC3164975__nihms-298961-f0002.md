  as coupled phase oscillators.(C) Model of the zebrafish oscillator. The Notch pathway
  has been proposed to synchronize oscillations by coupling by connecting the zebrafish
  Her1/Her7 intracellular oscillator to the Notch/DeltaC intercellular loop. The transcription
  factors Her1/Her7 establish a negative feedback loop controling the periodic repression
  of DeltaC, allowing the synchronous activation of Notch signaling in neighboring
  cells. In addition to receiving inputs from Notch signaling, the Her1/Her7 oscillator
  requires the Her13.2 partner, which is downstream of FGF signaling. The coupling
  between cellular oscillators provided by the Notch/Delta intercellular loop is thought
  to confer robustness to the clock synchronized oscillations against developmental
  noise such as cell proliferation, cell movement or stochastic gene expression.
