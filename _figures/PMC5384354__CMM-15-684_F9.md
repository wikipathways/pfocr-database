caption: 'Modulation of proliferation by crosstalk of miR-204 and miR-17/92 in smooth
  muscle cells. miR-204 stimulated proliferation through the Src-STAT3-NFAT signaling
  pathway by targeting SHP2. NFAT decreased the expression of the voltage-gated potassium
  channels, Kv1.5, to inhibit proliferation. Besides the NFAT signaling pathway, miR-204
  also increased the BMPR2 signaling pathway through inhibition of IL-6, followed
  by down-regulation of STAT3. Arrows (→) represent up-regulation. Capped lines (┤)
  indicate inhibition. Abbreviation: interleukin-6 (IL-6), nuclear factor of activated
  T-cells (NFAT), Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH), signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT3).'
