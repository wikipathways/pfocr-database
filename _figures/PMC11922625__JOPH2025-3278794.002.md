caption: Interaction of tau and DRN. Tau is first prephosphorylated by PKC, CDK-5
  and CaMKII, in addition, insulin resistance and lack of insulin inhibit the PI3K/AKT
  pathway, activating GSK-3β and causing hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Aβ accelerates
  the p-tau by mediating the activation of CDK-5 and GSK-3β; Aβ deposition and p-tau
  interact with each other and can directly induce mitochondrial damage, while p-tau
  can also induce mitochondrial damage through the PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway,
  ultimately leading to apoptosis of retinal neuronal cells and DRN. Both Aβ and tau
  can activate microglia through NF-κB and ERK signaling pathways, releasing various
  inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-23, TNF-α, and IL-6), eventually leading to apoptosis
  of retinal neuronal cells and DRN
