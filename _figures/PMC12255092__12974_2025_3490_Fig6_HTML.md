caption: Mechanisms of therapies that target lipid metabolism. (A) In the periphery,
  statins decrease cholesterol levels by inhibiting the rate-limiting step in cholesterol
  synthesis. (B) In the CNS, statins reduce T cell proliferation and decrease their
  MHC II expression. (C) Cyclodextrins upregulate the expression of lipid metabolism
  genes, including ABCA1, ABCG1, Trem2 and ApoE. (D) Cyclodextrins promote the dissolution
  of cholesterol crystals, thereby inhibiting crystal-induced ROS production and complement
  activation. (E) Cyclodextrins enhance autophagy, increase cathepsin D protease activity,
  and reduce lysosomal stress. (F-H) Cyclodextrins stimulate lysosomal exocytosis
  of cholesterol, transferring it into the metabolically active cholesterol pool.
  From there, cholesterol can either be esterified (G) or exported (H). (I) LXR agonists
  activate LXR signalling pathways, promoting the expression of LXR target genes.
  (I) LXR agonists reduce cholesterol crystal accumulation within macrophages. (K)
  RXR agonists, such as bexarotene, enhance the phagocytosis of myelin debris by macrophages.
