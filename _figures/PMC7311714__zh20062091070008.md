caption: Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE)-induced, interleukin-6 (IL-6)-glucagon-like
  peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R)-mediated suppression of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition
  by mesangial cells. The simplified summary diagram depicts the pathway mobilized
  by activation of IL-6 signaling by Orai1-mediated SOCE in mesangial cells and the
  effect of IL-6 on ECM proteins. Blue arrows indicate promotion of the pathway, the
  red arrow indicates inhibition of the pathway, and the red dashed arrow indicates
  possible alternative mechanisms. sIL-6R, soluble IL-6 receptor; gp130, glycoprotein
  130.
