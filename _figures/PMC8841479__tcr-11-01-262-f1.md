caption: The Hippo-YAP pathway in mammals. Various extracellular signals regulate
  YAP/TAZ phosphorylation and nuclear localization via the recruitment of MST1/2 (large
  tumor suppressor 1/2)-LATS1/2 (mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1/2) kinase cascade
  by KIBRA and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Other proteins, such as the adaptor
  proteins Salvador homologue 1 (SAV1), MOB kinase activator 1 (MOB1), the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase kinase (MAP4K) and TAO kinases (TAOK) take parts in
  the cascade. If signals activate the core of the Hippo pathway, it brings about
  the cytoplasmic retention and proteasomal degradation of YAP/TAZ, but if they inhibit
  the core, YAP/TAZ enter the nucleus, bind to the corresponding DNA-binding protein,
  which is most likely TEA domain (TEAD) proteins, and promote the target gene transcription,
  including connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), integrin-αV (ITGAV), amphiregulin
  (AREG).
