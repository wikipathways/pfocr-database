caption: 'Normal signaling pathways and alterations in aged DCs in response to lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS)/bacteria (A), and in response to self antigen (DNA). IRF-3: Interferon responsive
  factor-3. Black arrows show normal responses; red arrows show changes in aged DCs.
  In ageing, in response to exogenous stimuli (LPS/Bacteria) there is an impairment
  in P13 kinase signaling pathway that is associated with decreased phosphorylation
  of AKT resulting in decreased migration and phagocytosis, and increased NF-κB activation
  resulting increased proinflammatory cytokine production (A). In response to self
  DNA (B) aged DCs secrete proinflammatory cytokines and T-cell proliferation indicating
  increased reactivity to self antigen.'
