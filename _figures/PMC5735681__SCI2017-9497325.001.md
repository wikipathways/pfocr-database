caption: Effects of different proteins on the Wnt signaling pathway. (a) The increase
  in the expression of Wnt7a activated the Wnt7a/β-catenin-cyclinD1 pathway, which
  stimulated the proliferation of NSCs, and induced the Wnt7a/β-catenin-Ngn2 pathway,
  which promoted the neuronal differentiation (the red arrows). In the cerebral cortex
  of mice, the overexpression of Wnt7a could increase the level of Ngn-1 mRNA and
  then induce the differentiation of NSCs into neurons (the green arrows). (b) The
  overexpression of Wnt3a activated the Wnt signaling pathway and promoted the proliferation
  and neuronal differentiation of NSCs. (c) The loss of FMRP resulted in a decrease
  in the level of β-catenin, then downregulated the expression of Ngn-1 and reduced
  neuronal differentiation.
