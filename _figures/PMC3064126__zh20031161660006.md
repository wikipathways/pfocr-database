caption: 'PHEX, DMP1, matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE), and ASARM peptides

  pathway (B) predominates in familial and tumor forms of rickets/osteomalacia with
  hypophosphatemia [HYP, autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR), ADHR,
  and tumor-induced osteomalacia for example]. A: indirect ASARM pathway: 1) PHEX
  (a Zn metalloendopeptidase) is proposed to interact with DMP1 by binding to the
  DMP1-ASARM motif located at the COOH-terminal region of DMP1 (see also ). The PHEX-DMP1
  binding initiates a signaling pathway that reduces FGF23 expression. Note that in
  support of this, in XLH and ARHR, mutations in “PHEX or DMP1” result in hypophosphatemia
  through increased FGF23 expression and stability (overlapping pathophysiologies)

  ASARM protein motifs (MEPE, DMP1, and osteopontin derived) and MEPE protein (, ,
  , ). PHEX cleaves ASARM peptides, the only known physiological substrate for PHEX
  (, , , , ). Also, SIBLINGs (like DMP1) activate PHEX-related Zn matrix metalloproteinases
  via their binding interactions (, ). DMP1 for example binds and activates a PHEX-related
  Zn matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) (). Finally, the in vitro addition of recombinant
  DMP1 to UMR-106 cells causes a dose-dependent decrease in FGF23 expression (mRNA
  and protein) (). ASARM peptides are proposed to competitively displace the DMP1-PHEX
  complex in “normal mice” by forming a high-affinity/specificity PHEX-ASARM complex

  of FGF23. 3) Increased FGF23 expression leads to reduced 1,25 vitamin D3, reduced
  NPT2a expression, and hypophosphatemia. The competitive displacement of DMP1 by
  ASARM peptides provides an additional “bone” fine tuning of FGF23 and renal phosphate
  mineral homeostasis. B: direct pathophysiological ASARM pathway that is independent
  of FGF23, PHEX, and DMP1 is proposed to occur in familial HYP, ARHR, and ADHR. For
  example, in XLH and ARHR, expression of MEPE and several bone proteases including
  cathepsins, ECEL1/DINE, and NEP are markedly increased (37–39, 48, 55) resulting
  in excess ASARM peptide production and inhibition of mineralization (, , , , ).
  In these diseases, specific cleavage of MEPE and/or other bone SIBLING proteins
  (DSPP, OPN, DMP1, etc.) generates an excess of free protease-resistant ASARM peptides
  (, ). ASARM peptides are acidic, highly charged, with low Pis and are extraordinarily
  resistant to a wide range of proteases and have physicochemical similarities to
  bisphosphonates, phosphonoformic acid (PFA), and phosphonoacetic acid (PAA). Also,
  they share biological properties in vivo and in vitro with bisphosphonates, PFA,
