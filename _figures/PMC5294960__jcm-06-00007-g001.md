caption: Canonical and non-canonical TGF-β signaling pathways. (A) In the canonical
  signaling pathway, biologically active TGF-β ligands bind to TGFβRII, which in turn
  activates TGFβRI. TGFβRI-regulated SMAD2/3 proteins are phosphorylated at their
  C-terminal serine residues and form complexes with SMAD4 (co-SMAD), initiating a
  number of biological processes through transcriptional regulation of target genes.
  (B) In the non-canonical signaling pathways, the TGF-β receptor complex transmits
  its signal through other factors, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinases
  (MAPKs), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), TNF receptor-associated factor 4/6
  (TRAF4/6) and Rho family of small GTPases. Activated MAPKs can exert transcriptional
  regulation either through direct interaction with the nuclear SMAD protein complex
  or via other downstream proteins. Moreover, activated JNK/p38/ERK act in concert
  with SMADs to regulate cellular apoptosis and proliferation, whereas they mediate
  metastasis, angiogenesis and cellular growth through other transcription factors,
  such as c-JUN and ATF. RhoA/ROCK can be activated by TGF-β to induce actin stress
  fiber formation during EMT via a non-transcriptional mechanism. TGF-β can activate
  PI3K and AKT by inducing a physical interaction between the PI3K p85 subunit and
  the receptor complex leading to translational responses via mTOR/S6kinase activation.
  TGF-β activation of the TRAF proteins can initiate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling
  activity, leading to the inflammatory response among other processes. The arrows
  indicate activation/signaling direction of the respective pathway.
