caption: Model depicting effects of Wnt-stabilized β-catenin through Tcf proteins
  in mESCs. The two types of Wnt-regulated genes model the regulatory effects of Wnt3a
  and Tcf3 shown in . Group 1 genes are modeled as “Stem cell gene,” and Group 2 genes
  are modeled as “Differentiation gene.” (A) The stem cell gene is expressed in self-renewing
  mESCs as a consequence of Oct4/Sox2/Nanog binding. Tcf3–corepressor (CR) interactions
  limit stem cell gene expression, but the effects of Tcf3–CR are counteracted by
  Oct4/Sox2/Nanog. For simplicity, the Tcf complexes and Oct4/Sox2/Nanog complexes
  occupy the same DNA strand; however, mutual exclusive and competitive binding of
  factors is also possible. The differentiation gene is unaffected by Tcf3–corepresor
  effects because it is not transcriptionally activated by other factors. Note that
  the differential effect of Oct4/Sox2/Nanog on stem cell versus differentiation genes
  has been observed; however, the mechanism underlying the different effects remains
  unclear. (B) Overexpression of Tcf3 reduces expression of stem cell genes by recruiting
  corepressor activity. The repression of essential stem cell genes is sufficient
  to promote differentiation, because other differentiation-inducing genes (i.e.,
  those not regulated by Tcf) direct cell fate. (C) Wnt3a stimulates β-catenin stability,
  which binds to endogenous Tcf1 and Tcf3 proteins. Tcf3–β-catenin complexes bind
  to DNA and block the effects of Tcf3–CR complexes. Note that the same downstream
  effect could also be caused by Wnt-mediated reduction of Tcf3–DNA occupancy via
  posttranslational modification, such as phosphorylation by HIPK kinases described
  for XTCF-3 (; ). Tcf1–β-catenin stimulates expression of both stem cell genes and
  differentiation genes; however, the high level of stem cell gene expression is sufficient
  to stimulate self-renewal.
