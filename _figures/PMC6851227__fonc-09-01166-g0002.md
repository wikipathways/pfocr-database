caption: Enhanced tryptophan-turnover in AML blasts. Increased expression of indoleamine-2,3
  dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in AML blasts leads to tryptophan (Trp) depletion. It is catabolized
  to kynurenine (Kyn), resulting in extracellular kyn accumulation. A proportion of
  kyn is intracellularly converted to kynurenic acid (Kyna) by kyn aminotransferase
  (Kat) or to 3-hydroxy kyn (3-HK) by kyn 3-monooxygenase (Kmo). Subsequently, 3-HK
  is further processed into 3-hydroxanthranilic acid (3-HAA) by KYNase, which is further
  converted into quinolinic acid (QA) and picolinic acid (PA). The microenvironmental
  shortage of Trp and simultaneous abundance of Kyn promote activation of the aryl-hydrocarbon
  receptor (AhR) and the non-derepressing 2 protein kinase (GCN2) and suppress the
  mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, thus skewing immune responses
  away from immunoreactivity (by impeding conventional T cells) toward immunotolerance
  (by reinforcing regulatory T cells/TRegs).
