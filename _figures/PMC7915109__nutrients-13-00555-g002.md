caption: 'Possible molecular mechanism underlying the anti-angiogenic effects of Orostachys
  japonica against tumor cells, primarily, a blockade of the VEGF-VEGFR2 pathway.
  The downregulation of ERK and Akt by O. japonica in tumor cells results in the inhibition
  of VEGF and bFGF expression. The reduction of VEGF secretion from tumor cells by
  O. japonica can suppress the VEGF-VEGFR2 pathway in endothelial cells, thereby sequentially
  inhibiting phosphorylation of the FAK and Src, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and MAPK pathways.
  ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinases; Akt: protein kinase B; VEGF: vascular
  endothelial growth factor; bFGF: basic fibroblast growth factor; FAK: focal adhesion
  kinase; Src: proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinases;
  mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin.'
