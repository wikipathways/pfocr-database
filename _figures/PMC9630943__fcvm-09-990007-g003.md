caption: IL-33/ST2 axis. IL-33 is normally localized in the cell nucleus. The full-length
  (fl) IL-33 protein is released in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi independent but
  ATP-dependent pathway during cell damage or necrosis. The flIL-33 is then cleaved
  by inflammatory proteases into a form with increased activity. A heterodimeric receptor
  complex is formed by IL-33 and ST2L with IL-1R accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) The
  complex activates the downstream MyD88 pathway, and then activates NF-κB, AP-1,
  PGC-1α, and HIF-1α to promote gene, protein, and lipid synthesis as well as cellular
  metabolism. A single IL-1-associated receptor SIGIRR negatively regulates the IL-33/ST2
  axis. NF-κB and AP-1 are involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases by promoting
  inflammatory responses and inhibiting apoptosis. Activation of P38 can promote PGC-1α,
  OXPHOS, and mitochondrial fission and fusion; it can also lead to the activation
  of HIF-1α and enhancement of glycolysis. mTORC1 can also enhance HIF-1α expression
  and glycolysis enhancement in monocytes/macrophages.
