caption: In the intestinal stem cells (ISC), the Hippo pathway inhibits YAP activity
  by phosphorylation and cytosolic retention of YAP. The cytosolic YAP directly binds
  to β-catenin and subsequently inhibits the canonical Wnt signaling. In Mst1/2−/−
  intestinal epithelia, loss of Hippo pathway regulation promotes dephosphorylation
  and nuclear translocation of YAP/β-catenin and induces their target gene expression.
  Activation of YAP/β-catenin results in the expansion of ISC. However, a controversial
  role of YAP has been demonstrated in the context of Wnt-induced intestinal regeneration.
  In YAP−/− intestinal epithelia, hyperactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling results
  in ISC expansion, whereas YAP overexpression represses Wnt/β-catenin signaling,
  which leads to the loss of ISC and epithelial self-renewal. In this context, YAP
  functions to inhibit the nuclear translocation of disheveled (Dvl).
