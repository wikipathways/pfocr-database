caption: Overview of the basic metabolic pathways of E. rhusiopathiae. Pathways or
  steps for which no enzymes were identified are indicated in red, as are the compounds
  for which de novo synthetic pathways were not identified. The question marks indicate
  that particular uncertainties exist. ABC, ATP-binding cassette superfamily; Sec,
  secretion pathway; PTS, phosphotransferase system; GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine;
  GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; MscL, large conductance mechanosensitive ion channel
  family; MscS, small conductance mechanosensitive ion channel family; PP pathway,
  pentose phosphate pathway; PRPP, phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate; AICAR, 5′-phosphoribosyl-4-carboxamide-5-aminoimidazole;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; ACP, acyl carrier protein; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; THF,
  tetrahydrofolate; DHF, dihydrofolate.
