caption: Schematic representation of the effects of NGF/TrkA and BDNF/TrkB, which
  are involved in several signaling pathways in ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer cells
  express and secrete NGF. Through the activation of TrKA, NGF induces angiogenesis
  by directly stimulating the proliferation of endothelial cells. Nerve growth factor
  also regulates angiogenesis indirectly through the production of VEGF by ovarian
  cancer cells. In addition, NGF increases COX-2 levels, which induces the production
  of PGE-2. PGE-2 has been associated with invasion in cancer cells. ADAM17 also appears
  to be regulated by the activation of NGF/TrkA. Activation of the BDNF/TrkB pathway
  also confers migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and anoikis resistance to ovarian
  cancer cells. Norepinephrine can also bind to ADRB3 expressed by ovarian cancer
  cells to induce the production of BDNF, which then acts on TrkB receptors on nerve
  cells to increase the innervation of tumor tissues.
