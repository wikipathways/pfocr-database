caption: Simplified model illustrating the effect of heat stress on H2O2 production
  and associated oxidation of the cytosol and nucleus on the regulation of gene expression.
  The levels of transcripts encoding apoplastic H2O2 producing enzymes such as the
  Respiratory Burst Homologs (RBOH) and cell wall peroxidases were decreased in response
  to heat, as were transcripts encoding ascorbate oxidase (AO), which catalyzes the
  first step of the ascorbate degradation pathway. Heat increases the production of
  H2O2 in chloroplasts and mitchondria leading to oxidation of the cytosol and nucleus.
  This oxidation causes a highly specific expression of antioxidant genes such as
  APX2 that are important in the regulation of signal transduction, as well as heat
  shock factors (HSF) that regulate heat shock-induced signaling process. Transcription
  is also rapidly regulated by epigenetic factors such as histone methyltransferases
  (HMT) and histone acetyltransferases (HAT) as well as by the production of microRNAs
  (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA).
