caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of genes negatively regulated by unliganded GR.
  IPA identified this hub as the top signaling network among candidate genes upregulated
  in EPH-4 shGR-19 compared to EV-50 (IPA network score = 41) i.e. negatively regulated
  by unliganded GR. This network was associated with cardiovascular system development
  and function, cellular movement, and organismal development. Solid lines indicate
  a physical interaction between molecules. A solid line with an arrow indicates that
  one factor acts on the other, while a solid line with a perpendicular bar at the
  end denotes that one factor inhibits the other. Dotted lines indicate an indirect
  cellular interaction between factors. Shaded molecules represent candidate genes
  revealed to be upregulated between EPH-4 EV-50 and shGR-19 in our microarray analysis,
  while white molecules represent factors imputed from the Ingenuity Knowledge Base.
  The different shapes of the molecules represent their different functional activities:
  square, cytokine; circle, other; triangle, kinase/phosphatase; rectangle, G protein
  coupled receptor; oval, transcription regulator; diamond, enzyme. A full explanation
  of IPA annotation can be found at http://www.springerimages.com/Images/LifeSciences/1-10.1007_s12014-010-9053-0-2.'
