caption: Regulation of the floral transition by the abscisic acid signaling pathway
  in different photoperiods in SAM and Leaves. Proteins involved in signaling pathways
  under SD, LD, or both photoperiods are shown in ovals with a blue, orange, or blue-orange
  background. The positive regulatory interactions are depicted by blue arrows and
  negative interactions are depicted by red T-bars. The thick lines represent protein-protein
  interactions, whereas thin lines indicate transcriptional regulation. Unknown mechanisms
  are depicted by dotted lines. Protein complexes are depicted as partially overlapping
  ovals.
