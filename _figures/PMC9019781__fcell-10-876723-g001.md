caption: Hypothetic roles of WT1 in the development and progression of cancers with
  HIF pathway activation. In breast, uterine, ovarian, colon, lung, pleural, pancreatic
  and hematologic malignancies, HIF pathway is known to be activated especially in
  the hypoxic milieu. HIF-PHIs inhibit PHD catalysis and stabilize more HIF. The increased
  HIF resulted from either condition will bind to HRE and then transcriptionally activate
  its downstream genes, including EPO and WT1. Upregulation of WT1 will contribute
  to tumorigenesis and EMT. The figure was created with BioRender.com.
