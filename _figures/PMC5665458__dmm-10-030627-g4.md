caption: A model of how circadian biology and AD pathology might interact. Interactions
  between the central clock and other brain and peripheral clocks occur via the clock
  output pathway. Subsequent metabolic, behavioural and social cycles ensure the optimal
  functioning of the organism and might feedback to entrain the central clock, alongside
  nonvisual light input (which is the primary zeitgeber). Disrupted sleep and metabolic
  asynchrony might predispose an individual to AD pathology. This, in turn, might
  accentuate circadian deficits by damaging synaptic and other functions in the central
  clock mechanism and output pathway. ER stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress caused
  by protein misfolding and aggregation.
