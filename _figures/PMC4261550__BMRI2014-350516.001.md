caption: Neuroprotective functions of resveratrol in AD pathogenesis. (1) APP is cleaved
  by β- and γ-secretases and the production of Aβ aggregates together. (2) Resveratrol
  promotes the intracellular clearance of Aβ without influencing the generation of
  Aβ, by activating AMPK independently of SIRT1. (3) The phosphorylation of PKC, mainly
  PKC-δ, is induced by resveratrol and consequently plays a major role in the neuroprotective
  properties against Aβ-induced toxicity. (4) Resveratrol reduces the generations
  of Aβ-Fe, Aβ-Cu, and Aβ-Zn and thus reduces their toxicity. (5) ROS is produced
  by damaged mitochondria during oxidative stress, mainly iNOS and COX-2, and plays
  an important role in apoptosis. Resveratrol reduces iNOS and COX-2 levels and increases
  the production of HO-1 to attenuate oxidative damage. (6) Resveratrol decreases
  the expression of the ROS-producing enzyme Nox4 but increases the expression of
  ROS-inactivating enzymes, SOD1 and GPx1. (7) Resveratrol influences the Aβ-induced
  apoptotic signaling pathway, including restoring the decrease of Bcl-XL expression,
  inhibiting the expression of Bax, blocking the activation of JNK, and suppressing
  the increase of NF-κB DNA binding. (8) Resveratrol can inhibit PGE2 formation by
  activated microglial cells. (9) Aβ aggregation is responsible for the activation
  of astrocytes and microglia, which excrete cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α,
  which all were transcriptionally controlled by NF-κB. Resveratrol inhibits the increase
  of STAT1, STAT3, and IκBα phosphorylation.
