caption: Diagram illustrating the signalling pathways implicated in AREG-induced EMT
  in human pancreatic cancer cells. AREG induces the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB/p65
  through the EGFR/ERK signalling pathways. NF-κB mediates the AREG-induced cell migration
  and invasion by regulating EMT in human pancreatic cancer cells. Blockade of these
  pathways using different inhibitors decreased EMT in pancreatic cancer cells. Refer
  to the Discussion section for further explanation. AREG, amphiregulin; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor.
