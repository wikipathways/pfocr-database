caption: 'The calcineurin-NFAT pathway: Activation and regulation. Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3), generated by phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) via cleavage of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2), binds to the IP3 receptor (IP3R) and causes the release of Ca2+ from the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This Ca2+ depletion is sensed by store-operated calcium
  channels (SOC). Influx of extracellular Ca2+ into the cytosol causes calmodulin
  (CaM) to bind to calcineurin (composed of calmodulin binding part Calcineurin A-CnA,
  and regulatory subunit Calcineurin B-CnB), causing its activation. Calcineurin is
  a phosphatase that dephosphorylates NFAT and leads to its nuclear translocation.
  The calcineurin-binding protein 1 (CABIN1) and Down''s syndrome critical region
  1 (DSCR1) protein are endogenous inhibitors of calcineurin. In the nucleus, the
  NFAT proteins interact with multiple transcriptional partners (such as GATA4, MEF2,
  c-Fos, c-Jun, etc.) to regulate gene expression. NFAT proteins undergo rephosphorylation
  and inactivation by multiple NFAT kinases, such as glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (GSK3),
  casein kinase 1 (CK1), and dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase1/2
  (DYRK1 and DYRK2). CK1 and DYRK2 also maintain NFATs in the cytoplasm in hyperphosphorylated
  state. ATF2: activating transcription factor 2; DAG: diacylglycerol; MEF2: myocyte
  enhancer factor-2; PKC: protein kinase C; TCR: T cell receptor.'
