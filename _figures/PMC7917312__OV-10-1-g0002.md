caption: Armed oHSVs for GBM treatment. This figure represents different transgene
  variants that are inserted in the oHSV genome to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy
  of oHSV. (A) oHSV armed with cytokine such as IL-12, which induces Th1 differentiation,
  stimulates growth and cytotoxicity of NKs, increases IFN-γ production, and inhibits
  angiogenesis. (B) oHSV armed with angiogenic inhibitors decrease tumor vascularity
  (CD31+ vessels) or VEGF, inhibit anti-viral macrophages, and increase viral spread.
  (C) oHSV can be engineered to replace one copy of γ34.5 with GADD34. GADD34 binds
  to PP1 and promotes eIF-2α dephosphorylation - a function that corresponds to γ34.5
  in HSV. Since GADD34 does not possess beclin-1-binding motifs of γ34.5, it does
  not produce neurotoxicity as wild-type HSV containing both copies of γ34.5. (D)
  Localized expression of anti-PD-1 by an oHSV inhibits PD-1/PD-L1 engagement, prevents
  T cell exhaustion and unleashes anti-tumor immunity. (E) oHSV can be armed with
  CDH-1 gene, which encodes for E-cadherin – an adhesion molecule and a ligand for
  an inhibitory receptor expressed on NK cells (KLRG1). E-cadherin can cooperate with
  nectin-1 and promote cell-to-cell adherent junctions and enhance cell-to-cell oHSV
  spread. Another strategy to increase viral spread is to create an oHSV that expresses
  chondroitinase ABC, which removes side chain of CSPG, prevents extracellular space
  tortuosity, and thus, facilitates viral spread. (F) PTENα expressed by an oHSV metabolizes
  PIP3 prevents activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and inhibits tumor
  growth and migration. (G) oHSV armed with ULBP3 enhances anti-tumor immunity. ULBP3
  is a ligand for NKG2D. ULBP3-NKG2D interaction augments the anti-tumor activity
  of NK cells. (H) oHSV can be armed with pro-drug activating genes such as CYP2B1
  (which converts CPA to PM) and shiCE (which converts CPT11 to SN-38) to enhance
  the conversion of these pro-drugs into their anti-cancer active metabolites.
