caption: An overview of cancer cell-autonomous processes mediated by Hsp27, Hsp70,
  and Hsp90 that promote tumorigenesis. The transforming potential of cancer cell-autonomous
  events such as oncogenic mutations is commonly dependent on support from intracellular
  Hsp27, Hsp70, and Hsp90. The activities of key intracellular mitogenic signal transducers
  are also dependent on intracellular HSPs for sustained pathway activation, and thus
  HSPs mediate how cancer cells respond to the growth signals emanating from the tumor
  microenvironment. Similarly, signals from the tumor microenvironment can promote
  tumor-initiating properties within the carcinoma cells, the molecular features of
  which have also been closely linked with subpopulations enriched for Hsp72 and Hsf1.
  Such transforming events require the ability of tumor cells to overcome senescence
  (oncogene induced senescence—OIS), and the Hsp72 expression is required to overcome
  this hurdle to tumorigenesis. We also represent here other key tumorigenic processes
  supported by intracellular HSPs, including the inhibition of programmed cell death
  (PCD), altered cellular metabolism to favor glycolysis, stimulation of angiogenesis
  by cancer cells, and invasive and metastatic properties.
