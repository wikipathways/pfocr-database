caption: Exosome biogenesis occurs via the endosomal pathway. First, early endosomes
  are formed as a result of cell cytosis. During endosome maturation, the endosome
  membrane invaginates, giving rise to intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) which are packaged
  into multivesicular bodies or MVBs (also called late endosomes). The MVBs fuse with
  the plasma membrane and releases the ILVs, now termed exosomes, into the intracellular
  space. Alternatively, MVBs can fuse with lysosomes and are targeted for autophagy.
  The Rab family proteins play a critical role in the biogenesis of both multivesicular
  bodies and exosomes.
