caption: Pathway for Sterol-Accelerated Degradation of HMG CoA ReductaseAccumulation
  of 25-hydroxycholesterol, lanosterol, or 24,25-dihydrolanosterol in ER membranes
  triggers binding of the reductase to Insigs. A subset of Insigs is associated with
  the membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligase, gp78, which binds the E2 Ubc7 and VCP, an
  ATPase that plays a role in extraction of ubiquitinated proteins from ER membranes.
  Through the action of gp78 and Ubc7, reductase becomes ubiquitinated, which triggers
  its extraction from the membrane by VCP, and subsequent delivery to proteasomes
  for degradation. The post-ubiquitination step is postulated to be enhanced by geranylgeraniol
  through an undefined mechanism that may involve a geranylgeranylated protein, such
  as one of the Rab proteins.
