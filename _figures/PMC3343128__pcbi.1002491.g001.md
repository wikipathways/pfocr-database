caption: '(A) (Left) A generic pathway consisting of system inputs (I); upstream and
  downstream mediators (black bars); a core network; and outputs (O). (Middle) The
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade mediates a myriad of growth factor
  signals and elicits, sometimes opposing responses in a cell-type specific manner.
  (Right) The p53 network responds to a variety of cell stresses and elicits an appropriate
  course of gene expression that mitigates uncontrolled proliferation. (B) The RB-E2F
  switch, partitioned into four modules: Sensor (cyan edges); repression (R, red);
  negative feedback (NFB, purple); and positive feedback (PFB, green). This pathway
  performs at least three dynamic tasks in response to growth signals. (C) Algorithmic
  approach to search parameter space. (D) Calculating tension. Given a network, solution
  sets of parameters able to generate each dynamic (A and B) are identified. Tension
  between tasks (TAB) is defined as the weighted sum of the log-ratio of median parameter
  values.'
