caption: Metabolic pathway inter-dependence reflected by the quantitative levels of
  30 hydrophilic metabolites from glycolysis TCA cycle, pentose phosphate cycle and
  amino acids. Colored words indicate that the metabolites were determined quantitatively;
  black words were metabolites analyzed in a relative manner.
papertitle: Advantages of tandem LC-MS for the rapid assessment of tissue-specific
  metabolic complexity using a pentafluorophenylpropyl stationary phase.
