caption: Schematic representation of G protein activation and signaling. Heterotrimeric
  G proteins are composed of three distinct subunits alpha, beta, and gamma. Activity
  G protein depends on the alpha subunit. The alpha subunit contains high-affinity
  binding sites for guanine nucleotides (GDP) and has intrinsic GTPase activity. The
  GDP-bound form binds tightly to beta and gamma units in its inactive state. The
  GTP-bound form dissociates from beta and gamma units and serves as a regulator of
  effectors proteins. The receptor molecules cause the activation of G proteins by
  facilitating the exchange of GTP for GDP on the alpha subunit. The duration of subunit
  separation is timed by the rate of alpha subunit-mediated hydrolysis of GTP. The
  gsp mutations Arg201Cys and Gln227Arg at exons 8 and 9, respectively, of GNAS causing
  a constitutive signal of cAMP pathway.
