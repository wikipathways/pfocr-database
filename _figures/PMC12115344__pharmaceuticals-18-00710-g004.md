caption: The diagrammatic representation of the NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling
  pathway in ALD. Alcohol exposure increases intestinal permeability, facilitating
  the translocation of DAMPs and PAMPs into the liver, where they activate pattern
  recognition receptors, such as TLR4. This activation initiates downstream signaling
  cascades, including NF-κB activation and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Consequently,
  pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and TNF-α, are secreted, contributing
  to hepatic injury. Certain phytochemicals, including curcumin, artemisinin, and
  glabridin, have demonstrated the ability to modulate these pathways by inhibiting
  NF-κB translocation or NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thereby holding promise as
  potential therapeutic agents for ALD
