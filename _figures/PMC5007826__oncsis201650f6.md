caption: Working model of PRL-3 involvement in TNF-R1 pleiotropy. (a) PRL-3 is transcriptionally
  regulated by NF-ĸB in TNBC cells. (b) PRL-3 knockdown results in upregulation of
  TNFα RNA and protein leading to activation of the NF-ĸB pathway (pathway 1), coinciding
  with the period of cellular senescence. TNF-R1 is sensitized and activates an extrinsic
  apoptosis program (pathway 2) after prolonged TNFα upregulation following PRL-3
  knockdown. (c) PRL-3 knockdown and blockade of the NF-ĸB pathway sustains cell survival
  through c-Jun/AP-1 activity.

  that mediates triple-negative breast cancer growth.
