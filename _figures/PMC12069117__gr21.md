caption: TREM2 signalling pathways. TREM2 binds positively charged arginine residues
  in its extracellular domain (R+) to negatively charged lipid ligands. The protein
  kinase SRC tyrosine phosphorylates the TREM2-associated adaptor DAP12 upon ligand
  binding, recruiting the tyrosine protein kinase SYK. Signalling proteins include
  phospholipase C (PLC), lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2 (LCP2; also called as SLP76),
  protooncogene vav (VAV1), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), and others.
  All of these pathways result in the stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC), activation
  of the RAS-ERK pathway, and actin remodelling. SYK also stimulates the PI3K–AKT
  signalling pathway and CBL, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that inhibits the TREM2
  signalling pathway. TREM2 is also linked to DAP10, a PI3K attractant and activator.
  TREM2 is released from the cell surface by secretase, disintegrin, and metalloproteinase
  domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) (sTREM2)183. Reprinted with the permission
