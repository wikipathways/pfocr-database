caption: 'Ketone body metabolic fates beyond terminal oxidation. Ketone body metabolism
  in hepatic or extrahepatic cytosol is integrated with nonoxidative pathways such
  as cholesterogenesis and DNL. In extrahepatic cells, AcAc carbon converges with
  itaconate and HBPs in mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments, respectively. Question
  marks represent the uncertain molecular identity of mitochondrial ketone transporter(s).
