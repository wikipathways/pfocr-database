caption: Phospholipid synthesis pathway in S. cerevisiae. PtdSer is synthesized in
  the ER from serine and CDP-DAG, and is subsequently transported to other organelles.
  In mitochondria, PtdSer is decarboxylated by Psd1p to form PtdEtn. In the endosomes
  or vacuole compartment, PtdEtn is formed by the action of Psd2p. PtdEtn in the mitochondria
  and endosomes or vacuole compartments can be subsequently exported from those organelles
  back to the ER to be transformed to PtdCho by the action of PtdEtn methyltransferases.
  Alternatively, PtdEtn can be synthesized from ethanolamine (Etn) through the Kennedy
  pathway. In this pathway, ethanolamine needs to be activated to CDP-ethanolamine
  (CDP-Etn) and fused to diacylglycerol (DAG) to synthesize PtdEtn.

  gene, is involved in phospholipid distribution.
