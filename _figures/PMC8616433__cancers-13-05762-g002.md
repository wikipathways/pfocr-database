caption: 'NO mechanism of synthesis and action. (a) NO is synthesized in the process
  of converting L-arginine to L-citrulline and is oxidized by NOS in the presence
  of O2 and NADPH. There are two major mechanisms of action of NO: cGMP dependent
  and cGMP independent. The NO/cGMP pathway induces relaxation of smooth muscle and
  inhibits platelet aggregation. In the cGMP independent pathway, some NO is converted
  into reactive nitrogen species (RNS). NO and RNS mediate post-translational protein
  modification (PTM) by S-nitrosylation and tyrosine nitration. (b) Synthesis of dinitrogen
  trioxide (N2O3) and peroxynitrite (ONOO−).'
