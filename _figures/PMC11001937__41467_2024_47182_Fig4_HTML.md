caption: A Pathway related to energetic metabolism showing significantly altered metabolites
  using box and whiskers plots (statistical test was linear mixed-effects model with
  the correction for multiple test comparisons, FDR p-value < 0.05). In this, the
  box ranges from the first to the third quartile, and the center the median value,
  while the whiskers extend from each quartile to the minimum or maximum values. The
  graph shows normalized abundance of the metabolite in the Y-axis and age group in
  the X-axis. All metabolites were from GC-QTOF-MS (n = 63, n = 64, n = 58 of biologically
  independent samples for Infants, Mothers, and Grandmothers groups, respectively),
  except when explicitly noted as from MSI-CE-MS (n = 54, n = 62, n = 55 of biologically
  independent samples for Infants, Mothers, and Grandmothers groups, respectively).
  B Pathways related to endogenous and microbial metabolism of tryptophan showing
  significantly altered metabolites using box and whiskers plots (statistical test
  was linear mixed-effects model with the correction for multiple test comparisons,

  and Grandmothers groups, respectively). For A and B pathways, names highlighted
  in gold indicate that the metabolite is increased with age, while names in blue
