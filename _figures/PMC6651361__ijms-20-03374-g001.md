caption: Glucose metabolism in cancer cells. In strategy 1, glucose is uptake is by
  GLUT1, which is a glucose transporter overexpressed in cancer cells, and follows
  the glycolytic pathway to pyruvate. The first step is the phosphorylation by hexokinase
  (HK) and the main isoform upregulated in cancer is HK2. Under anaerobiosis, pyruvate
  is converted to lactate, with the regeneration of NAD+ that feeds glycolysis. This
  way is a source of energy for cancer cells and supplies intermediates like ribose-5-phosphate
  and NADPH that are required for cell proliferation. In strategy 2, pyruvate obtained
  by glycolysis is transformed in Acetyl-Coenzyme-A (Acetyl-CoA) that enters in the
  mitochondrial Krebs cycle and follows oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the main
  source of ATP in a normal cell. Finally, in strategy 3, the cancer cell may turn
  in mitochondrial uncoupling, because it could use substrates that are different
  of glucose as a carbon source like fatty acids, aspartate, and glutamine that feeds
  the Krebs cycle (anaplerotic reactions). There is a mitochondrial carrier named
  uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), that has been connected with proliferation and anaplerotic
  mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells. The proliferating cells can choose more
  than one strategy at a time.
