caption: 'DXPS roles in bacterial central metabolism. The product DXP is used for
  synthesis of vitamins (ThDP and PLP) and isoprenoids. AlkylAPs inhibit DXPS catalysis,
  simultaneously impairing multiple metabolic pathways. Abbreviations: alkyl acetylphosphonates
  (alkylAPs); 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase (DXPS); dimethylallyl
  diphosphate (DMADP); isopentenyl diphosphate (IDP); methylerythritol phosphate (MEP);
  pyridoxal phosphate (PLP); thiamin diphosphate (ThDP); tricarboxylic acid (TCA);
  branched-chain amino acid (BCAA); and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).'
