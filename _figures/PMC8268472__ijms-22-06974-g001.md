caption: Tryptophan as a precursor of serotonin, XA and tryptamine. Tryptophan is
  an essential amino acid the concentration of which is regulated by food intake and
  gut microbiota. Tryptophan and many of its metabolites are transported into the
  brain via regulated mechanisms and give rise to many active compounds in the CNS.
  The principal pathway is degradation through kynurenine and the synthesis of two
  related analogues, kynurenic and xanthurenic acid. These two compounds have opposite
  effects on dopamine disposal in the brain. In addition, tryptophan is the precursor
  of the serotonin neurotransmission pathway and of tryptamine, an indolamine compound
  which stimulate trace-amine receptors in the CNS, especially TAAR1. The three pathways
  of tryptophan degradation produce substances linked to psychosis and are involved
  in the modulation of dopaminergic activities in the brain. TH, tryptophan hydroxylase;
  AADC, aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase; IDO, indolamine dioxygenase; TDO, tryptophan
  dioxygenase; KATs, kynurenine aminotransferases; KMO, kynurenine monooxygenase.
