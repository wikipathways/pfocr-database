caption: 'A Brief Introduction to the Functions of lncRNAs (Wilusz et al., 2009) AND
  The Roles of Three lncRNAs in Acute Myeloid Leukemia. A The lncRNA CRNDE enhances
  the drug resistance of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to adriamycin (ADR) by activating
  the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. CRNDE participates in the CRNDE/miR-136-5p/MCM5
  axis to regulate cellular processes and thereby influences the disease progression
  of AML. B lncRNA ZEB2-AS1 regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis in acute myeloid
  leukemia via the miR-122-5p/PLK1 axis. C lncRNA TUG1 confers Adriamycin resistance
  in acute myeloid leukemia by epigenetically suppressing miR-34a expression via EZH2.
  And it regulates cell viability and apoptosis by modulating the miR-193a-5p/Rab10
  axis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Note: Extensive research has explored the
  influence of the aforementioned three specific lncRNAs on AML disease progression
  via the microRNA/protein axis. However, no definitive consensus has been established
  to date. The current review may be subject to bias due to potentially incomplete
  literature inclusion. Future studies should aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which
  various lncRNAs influence AML progression through more rigorous and compelling experimental
  designs'
