caption: Proposed model of INR119 mechanism of action. (A and B) H2O2 induces pathway
  activation through MAPKKK activation; however, at low H2O2 concentrations negative
  regulation targeting Wis1 C458 holds the activity of Wis1 back. At higher levels
  of H2O2, Sty1 activation is independent of Wis1 C458. (C) INR119 binds Wis1 in an
  allosteric site next to the active site very close to C458 and protects against
  negative regulation targeting C458 through stabilizing a conformation unresponsive
  to negative regulation through C458, resulting in higher Wis1 activity in low H2O2
  levels.
