caption: Proposed mechanism for NMDA receptor-mediated increases in cAMP in the striatum.
  Activation of NMDA receptors results in increased intracellular Ca2+ levels. Ca2+
  stimulates the release of 5′AMP, which is transported across the membrane via a
  bidirectional nucleotide transporter (). 5′AMP is broken down to adenosine via membrane-bound
  ecto 5′ nucleotidase. Adenosine then stimulates adenosine A2a receptors, which are
  positively coupled to Gs. Once the adenosine A2a receptor is stimulated, Gs activates
  adenylyl cyclase type V, which in turn triggers the breakdown of ATP to cAMP.
