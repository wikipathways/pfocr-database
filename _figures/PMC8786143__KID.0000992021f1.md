caption: 'The complement cascade. The complement cascade is made up of three pathways:
  the classic, the lectin, and the alternative pathways. An amplification loop of
  the initial cascade signals includes C3, and a terminal common pathway ensues. The
  alternative pathway is always active at low levels and may be self-activated after
  C3 hydrolysis. Without proper regulation with complement regulatory proteins (Factor
  H [FH], Factor I, complement factor H [CFH]–related proteins), an overactive pathway
  may result in damage to self. Factor B is cleaved into smaller fragments, the most
  notorious being Ba and Bb. Bb is added onto the alternative pathway C3 convertase
  to continue the C3 amplification loop cycle. Inflammation is led by the C3a and
  C5a, and the most visible effect of the terminal complement cascade is cell lysis,
  mediated by the C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9 components, in a complex named C5b-9 or
  membrane attack complex (MAC). Adapted from Frazer Abel et. al., Adv. Clin. Chem.
