caption: EBV infects nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and participates in the tumorigenic
  process of NPC. EBV-positive malignant NPC cells secret a variety of chemokines
  (CX3CL1, etc.) and initiate the recruitment and tumoral infiltration of multiple
  immune cells with the chemokines receptors from the peripheral blood. Multiple tumour
  infiltrating immune cells activate EGFR and Notch pathway in EBV-positive malignant
  NPC cells. Naive CD8+ cells infiltrate to the lesion and develop to effector and
  further exhausted CD8+ cells. Peripheral DCs infiltrate to the tumour and differentiate
  into LAMP3+ DCs. The mature LAMP3+ DCs with the expression of PD-L1/PD-L2 interact
  with PD1 on CD8+ T cells whereby the signalling restrains the activation of CD8+
  T cells and promotes their exhaustion. Treg cells interact with LAMP3+ DCs through
  CTLA4-CD80/CD86, which might limit the antigen presentation process of DCs and promote
  the secretion of IDO1 to induce the proliferation of Treg cells. The intensive cell-cell
  interactions among LAMP3+ DCs, Treg cells, exhausted CD8+ T cells, and malignant
  cells foster an immune-suppressive niche for the tumour microenvironment of NPC.
