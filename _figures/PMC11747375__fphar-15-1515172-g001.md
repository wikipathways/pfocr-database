caption: 'Molecular targets and mechanism of action of GA in hyperlipidemia. Green
  arrows and red arrows indicate promotion and inhibition, respectively. Description:
  This figure illustrates how GA regulates lipid metabolism in patients with hyperlipidemia.
  GA inhibits lipid synthesis by activating the AMPK pathway, downregulating SREBP-1c,
  SREBP-2, and ACCα. Simultaneously, it promotes fatty acid oxidation by decreasing
  PPARα expression and increasing ketone body levels. GA also reduces triglyceride
  accumulation by activating AMPKα, promoting autophagy, and inhibiting HSL and pancreatic
  lipase. Furthermore, GA suppresses inflammation by reducing TNF, CCL-2, and NOS
  levels, while enhancing mitochondrial function through UCP1, PGC-1α, and SIRT1.
  Additionally, GA induces adipocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of Bcl-2
  and Bcl-XL and promotes adipocyte differentiation, leading to increased production
  of adipokines such as adiponectin and Fabp4, thereby indirectly influencing lipid
  levels. These combined effects underscore GA’s potential for effective control of
  hyperlipidemia. Green arrows indicate promoting effects, while red arrows represent
  inhibitory actions'
