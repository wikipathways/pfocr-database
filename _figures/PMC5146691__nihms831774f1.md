caption: 'Implications of cell biological processes on innate immune signaling. The
  trafficking of PRRs and the location of innate immune signaling can regulate signal
  transduction and dictate the outcome of microbial detection (a). ➊ TLR4 undergoes
  trafficking to specialized regions of the plasma membrane to activate MyD88-dependent
  signaling. ➋ CD14 mediates the endocytosis of TLR4, which results in TRIF-dependent
  signaling from the endosome. ➌ RIG-I undergoes trafficking to the site of MAVS signaling
  on mitochondria. ➍ MAVS signaling from mitochondria induces a type I and III IFN
  response, whereas signaling from peroxisomes induces the transcription of type III
  IFN only. Alternatively, innate immune signaling can engage cell biological processes
  to control infection (b). ➎ Dectin signaling can induce phagocytosis as an effective
  means of microbial clearance. ➏ NODs and TLRs recruit regulators of autophagy to
  the site of bacterial entry for pathogen elimination. ➐ Autophagosomes can deliver
  antigens of intracellular pathogens for MHC-II presentation to coordinate adaptive
  immune responses. ➑ Inflammasome activation induces a rapid form of cell death known
  as pyroptosis, which can limit the replication of intracellular pathogens. ➒ The
  RLR/MAVS signaling pathway can also induce cell death to limit viral replication.
