caption: Integration of multiple low-oxygen stress-signaling pathways from diverse
  cellular origins. According to this model, signaling to the nucleus occurs through
  various pathways. From left to right, low-oxygen stress results in an NADPH-oxidase-derived
  oxidative burst, which eventually leads to posttranslational activation of diverse
  transcription factors (TFs). The influx of extracellular calcium stimulates a signaling
  cascade involving CALCINEURIN-B-LIKE PROTEINs (CBLs) and CBL-INTERACTING PROTEIN
  KINASEs (CIPKs) and the activation of NADPH oxidases, called RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE
  HOMOLOGs (RBOHs). RBOHs are in addition stimulated to produce ROS by interacting
  with RHO-LIKE SMALL G-PROTEINS OF PLANTS (ROP). The resulting ROS burst is subsequently
  dampened through the action of ROP GTPase ACTIVATING PROTEIN4 (RopGAP4), which targets
  ROP, as well as by HYPOXIA-RESPONSIVE UNIVERSAL STRESS PROTEIN1 (HRU1), which forms
  a complex with ROP and RBOH. Furthermore, oxygen limitation might hamper oxidative
  protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through impairing the activity
  of ER THIOL OXIDASE (ERO), which subsequently results in an unfolded protein response
  (UPR). In addition, low-oxygen stress causes mitochondrial dysfunction, which is
  communicated to the ER via mitochondrial retrograde regulation (MRR). Dormant NAC
  TFs at the ER are proteolytically released to transduce the MRR signal to the nucleus.
  Further, impairment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) is followed
  by a mitochondrial oxidative burst and potentially an efflux of stored calcium into
  the cytosol. The oxidative burst results in the activation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED
  PROTEIN KINASE3 (MPK3) and MPK6, which may regulate hypoxic gene expression by phosphorylation
  of transcriptional regulators. Disturbance of the mETC further leads to a drop in
  ATP levels, which is sensed by the kinases TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) and SUC NONFERMENTING1-RELATED
  KINASE1 (SnRK1), whereby TOR is inactivated, while Snrk1 is induced under ATP limitation.
  Stabilization of RELATED TO APETALA2.12 (RAP2.12) and other subgroup VII ERF TFs
  occurs through inactivation of the N-end rule pathway under hypoxic conditions.
  Under aerobic conditions, this active degradation pathway involves oxygen-dependent
  oxidation of the TF proteins that is catalyzed by PLANT CYS OXIDASE (PCO). Additionally,
  RAP2.12 protein abundance is increased by HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY ROOT1 (HCR1), a
  Raf-like MAPKKK which targets the TF under oxygen-limiting and K+-sufficient conditions.
  Finally, integration of the diverse subcellular signal inputs most likely occurs
  at the level of TFs, which are potentially regulated by posttranslational modification
  and induce transcriptional reprogramming resulting in hypoxia adaptation.
