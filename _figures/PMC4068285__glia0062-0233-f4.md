caption: 'Hypothetical model of LM infection in microglia. Pathogenic LM seems to
  induce in microglia the dissociation of a transcriptional response dominated by
  innate immunity using three events regulated by the actA gene and partially by the
  hly gene: (i) the actA gene appears relevant for the induction of early innate responses
  compiled in three signaling pathways: TLR, TNF, and NF-κB. After bacteria bound
  to TLR2, induction of mitogen-activated kinase and PI3K seemed to occur with participation
  of CD14. Subsequent activation of the NF-κB might induce high levels of TNF-α (GOOD
  TNF-α production in the model) and MCP-1, and CXCL2 and CCL4 chemokines that recruited
  other monocytes (+ routes). (ii) The actA gene also repressed a degradation cluster
  belonging to late innate responses and characterized by lysosomal genes smpd1 and
  scarb2 (–routes). (iii) The hly gene seemed to repress the IFN-responsive gene cluster
  belonging to late innate responses involving high induction of repressor Socs3 (+
  arrow) that blocked the IFN pathway and repressed Jak1, the kinase associated with
  IFN receptor (–routes). Therefore, production of type I IFNs (i.e., IFN-αβ‥ and
  NO was decreased (BAD IFN-αβ and NO production in the model) because activation
  of the iNOS genes appeared compromised. The hly gene seemed also important for inhibition
  of the pi3kcg gene that might avoid activation of the phagosomal oxidase (known
  as phox) and block H2O2 production. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue,
