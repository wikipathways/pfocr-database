caption: ADA deficiency leads to an accumulation of adenosine (A) and deoxyadenosine
  (B) – different mechanisms are proposed for the increased concentration of each
  metabolic substrate. (A) An increase in extracellular adenosine concentration leads
  to an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) caused by increased A2A receptor
  activation. cAMP is proposed to mediate lymphotoxic effects by disrupting TCR signaling
  and inhibiting the immune response to a stimulus. (B) Extracellular accumulation
  of 2′deoxyadenosine increases the intracellular concentration of 2′deoxyadenosine
  via diffusion down its concentration gradient. 2′deoxyadenosine inhibits SAH hydrolase
  and plays a role in apoptosis, by activating the p53 pathway. Alternatively, 2′deoxyadenosine
  can undergo conversion to dATP. dATP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and also
  plays a role in apoptosis.
