caption: Our current working hypothesis is that the HPS genetic mutations disrupt
  AT2 progenitor cell function early, with activation of the p53 pathway, impairing
  AT2 cell proliferation and driving aberrant AT2 cell differentiation. Over time,
  this results in accelerated AT2 cell loss with senescence and depletion of the stem
  cell pool and progressive fibrotic remodeling
