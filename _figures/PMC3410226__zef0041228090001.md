caption: 'Schematic representation of insulin signaling pathway. Insulin binding to
  its receptor, a transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of two α- and two β-subunits,
  which possesses tyrosine kinase activity, represents the first step in the insulin
  signaling cascade. After insulin binding to the α-subunit, β-subunit tyrosine residues
  become autophosphorylated. This increases intrinsic receptor kinase activity and
  accelerates tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor substrates, the most important
  of which are IRS-1 and IRS-2. IRS-1 and IRS-2 bind the regulatory subunit of PI3K,
  which catalyzes the production of PIP3. PIP3 acts as a secondary messenger activating
  the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt, which finally mediates most insulin actions.
  Several negative modulators of insulin signaling have been described. A few of them
  act by protein-protein interaction: as shown on the right side of the insulin signaling
  cascade, the class II transmembrane glycoprotein ENPP1 binds and inactivates insulin
  receptor tyrosine kinase activity, whereas the pseudokinase TRIB3 binds Akt and
  inhibits downstream signaling. APPL1 competes with this latter binding, thus antagonizing
  TRIB3 inhibition of Akt-mediated insulin signaling. Other inhibitors act by modifying
  the phosphorylation state of signaling molecules: as shown on the left side of the
  insulin signaling cascade, these include phosphotyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B),
  a tyrosine phosphatase on the insulin receptor; TNF-α, IL-6, and C-reactive protein
  (CRP), chronic inflammation-related molecules that induce IRS-1 serine phosphorylation
  and subsequent inactivation; the inositol-5 phosphatase SHIP2, which dephosphorylates
  PIP3; and finally, phosphatase PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase-1
  (PHLPP-1), a specific Akt Ser473 phosphatase. Based on our present knowledge, it
  is entirely possible that, in some individuals, alterations to this redundant and
  complex network may be pathogenic for insulin resistance and related metabolic derangements.'
