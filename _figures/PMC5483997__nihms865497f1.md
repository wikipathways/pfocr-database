caption: Binding of the BMP ligand dimer to its type I and type II receptors forms
  the BMP transmembrane signalling complex. Within this complex, the type II receptor
  serine–threonine kinase phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor. The canonical
  signalling occurs when type I receptor serine–threonine kinase phosphorylates SMAD1/5/8,
  leading to the formation of the SMAD1/5/8–SMAD4 complex. The SMAD1/5/8–SMAD4 complex
  then translocates to the nucleus, where it activates the expression of BMP target
  genes such as Id1, −2 and −3. BMP signalling is regulated at multiple steps. Extracellular
  antagonists can complex with BMP ligand to prevent binding to its receptor. Smurf1/2
  and SMAD6/7 can prevent phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 and binding to its co-factor
  SMAD4. Small molecule BMP inhibitors, such as dorsomorphin (DM) and DMH1, are competitive
  kinase inhibitors of BMP type I receptor. Inside the green insert are the non-canonical
  (SMAD-independent) signalling pathways, p38, LIMK, Rho and ROCK. Not shown are additional
  BMP pathway modulators such a co-receptors, which can modulate ligand-receptor binding
  affinity, and pseudoreceptors, which block receptor activation.

  description: Binding of the BMP ligand dimer to its type I and type II receptors
    forms the BMP transmembrane signalling complex. Within this complex, the type
    II receptor serine–threonine kinase phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor.
    The canonical signalling occurs when type I receptor serine–threonine kinase phosphorylates
    SMAD1/5/8, leading to the formation of the SMAD1/5/8–SMAD4 complex. The SMAD1/5/8–SMAD4
    complex then translocates to the nucleus, where it activates the expression of

    steps. Extracellular antagonists can complex with BMP ligand to prevent binding
