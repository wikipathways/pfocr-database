caption: Therapeutics in development that target survival pathways activated by LMP1
  and LMP2a. Both LMP1 and LMP2a activate members of the SFK (Fyn and Lyn, respectively)
  upstream of Syk activation. Syk then activates the PI3K/Akt/mTor signaling pathway.
  Small molecule inhibitors of these signaling molecules that are currently in preclinical
  or clinical development in other malignancies are listed next to their described
  target.
