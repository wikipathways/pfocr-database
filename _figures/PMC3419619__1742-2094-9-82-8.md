caption: Schematic of protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) activation by proteolytic cleavage
  downstream of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling in dopaminergic neurons. (1)
  Sustained TNF signaling leads to caspase-8 activation, presumably by autoproteolytic
  cleavage at the receptor complex (2). Active caspase-8 leads to downstream activation
  of caspase-3, which can be blocked by the caspase-8 inhibitor IETD-fmk (3). Caspase-3
  activates PKCδ by proteolytic cleavage (4) at the hinge region (shown in red), releasing
  the catalytic fragment and causing constitutive activation of the kinase (5). The
  constitutively active PKCδ catalytic fragment mediates proapoptotic signaling by
  phosphorylation of its downstream substrates, resulting in DNA fragmentation and
  dopaminergic cell death (6). Blocking the PKCδ signaling pathway using siRNA, targeted
  gene knockout or a caspase-3 cleavage-resistant mutant can protect against dopaminergic
  cell death induced by TNF toxicity.
