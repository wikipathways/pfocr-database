caption: Calculated free-energy profiles for the mechanism of the final part of the
  reaction. (a) Mechanism via (2 + 2) Staudinger synthesis with and without the involvement
  of copper (black vs blue, respectively). (b) New mechanism proposed in the present
  work involving the nucleophilic attack of the ketenyl copper intermediate on the
  imine and subsequent cyclization. In both cases, the pathway of the previous computational
  proposal is reported in gray for comparison.
