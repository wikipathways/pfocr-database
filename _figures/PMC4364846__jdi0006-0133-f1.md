caption: A proposed newer view on the free fatty acid (FFA) signaling in (a) pancreatic
  β-cells, on the basis of the findings in (b) the β-cell specific desnutrin knockout
  mouse. The novel pathway shown by Tang et al. is shown in blue. Downward or upward
  arrows indicate increase or decrease, respectively, in the substrate or signaling.
  (b) Faintness in blue implies attenuated signaling. The scheme is focused on the
  topic of the work of Tang et al., and is not intended to cover all aspects of β-cell
  metabolism-secretion coupling. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  KATP channel, adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K+ channel; LC-CoA, long-chain acyl-CoA;
  PPARδ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-δ; TAG, triacylglycerol; VDCC,
  voltage-dependent calcium channel.
