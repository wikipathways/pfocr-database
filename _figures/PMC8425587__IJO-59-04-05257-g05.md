caption: Molecular mechanisms of SQSTM1/p62 in regulating urological cancer. In prostate
  cancer, SQSTM1/p62 aggregation and phosphorylation may facilitate autophagy and
  AR degradation owing to the activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and the IL-1β
  and hypoxia-activated AMPK pathway, respectively. Moreover, in a nutrient-rich environment
  or in the presence of EGF, SQSTM1/p62 can promote autophagy, proliferation and malignant
  transformation by tightly binding either to MEKK3 or NBR1 to recruit TRAF6 and direct
  mTORC1 to lysosomes through the SQSTM1/p62 PB1 domain or to Ack1 to prolong EGFR
  survival through the SQSTM1/p62 UBA domain. In CAFs, SQSTM1/p62 deletion may cause
  stimulation of the mTORC1/c-myc/GSH/IL-6/TGF-β pathway, which facilitates the action
  of nearby prostate cancer cells in combating malignant transformation, proliferation
  and invasion (red arrow). In renal cell carcinoma, hypoxia-induced SQSTM1/p62 may
  not only directly bind to and drive ubiquitylated HIF2α to autophagosomes for degradation,
  but may also form a positive feedback loop with HIF1α by inactivating VHL E3, facilitating
  renal cell survival in unfavorable environments. TRAF6, TNF receptor-associated
