caption: There is an ANKHD1/MALAT1/YAP1-feedback loop in CRC cells, which synergistically
  regulates the nuclear translocation of YAP1 and promotes the transcriptional coactivation
  of YAP1. Subsequently, YAP1-mediated activation of AKT increases the expression
  of the MRN complex and then activates the ATM/CHK2-checkpoint pathway, promoting
  DNA damage repair and ultimately resulting in radioresistance in CRC.
papertitle: The feedback loop of ANKHD1/lncRNA MALAT1/YAP1 strengthens the radioresistance
  of CRC by activating YAP1/AKT signaling.
