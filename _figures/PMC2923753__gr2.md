caption: Signalling pathways that regulate Candida albicansCHS gene expression. The
  HOG, PKC and the Ca2+/calcineurin signalling pathways regulate chitin synthesis
  and CHS gene expression []. The Rlm1 transcription factor downstream of the PKC
  MAP kinase cascade controls the expression of a number of cell wall related genes
  in S. cerevisiae. Putative Rlm1 binding motifs (red boxes) in the promoters of CaCHS2
  and CaCHS8 contribute to their cell wall stress-activated regulation []. Activation
  of the calcineurin pathway results in de-phosphorylation of the CaCrz1 transcription
  factor. CaCrz1 then moves to the nucleus and induces expression of genes with CDREs
  (calcium-dependent response elements) within their promoter sequences. C. albicans
  has significant re-wiring of signalling pathways compared to S. cerevisiae, for
  example, the role of the CaSko1 transcription factor in response to caspofungin
  is independent of the CaHog1 MAP kinase but involves the CaPsk1 PAS kinase []. Potential
  CDREs and Sko1 binding sites identified in silico upstream of CaCHS2 and CaCHS8
  (grey boxes) were not required for regulation of gene expression []. Sequences in

  description: Signalling pathways that regulate Candida albicansCHS gene expression.
    The HOG, PKC and the Ca2+/calcineurin signalling pathways regulate chitin synthesis
    and CHS gene expression []. The Rlm1 transcription factor downstream of the PKC
    MAP kinase cascade controls the expression of a number of cell wall related genes
    in S. cerevisiae. Putative Rlm1 binding motifs (red boxes) in the promoters of
    CaCHS2 and CaCHS8 contribute to their cell wall stress-activated regulation [].
    Activation of the calcineurin pathway results in de-phosphorylation of the CaCrz1
    transcription factor. CaCrz1 then moves to the nucleus and induces expression
    of genes with CDREs (calcium-dependent response elements) within their promoter
    sequences. C. albicans has significant re-wiring of signalling pathways compared
    to S. cerevisiae, for example, the role of the CaSko1 transcription factor in
    response to caspofungin is independent of the CaHog1 MAP kinase but involves the
    CaPsk1 PAS kinase []. Potential CDREs and Sko1 binding sites identified in silico
    upstream of CaCHS2 and CaCHS8 (grey boxes) were not required for regulation of
    gene expression []. Sequences in the first 347 bp and 125 bp of the CaCHS2 and
