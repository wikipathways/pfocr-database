caption: Schematic illustration of the metabolic pathways found to be altered in the
  lung parenchyma. Enhancement of the glycolytic pathway, including an increase in
  pulmonary FDG uptake, higher lactate and alanine concentrations, and a decrease
  in the pulmonary glucose concentrations in HPX+SU mice. The increased glycine concentration
  is characteristic of an upregulation of one-carbon metabolism. Higher levels of
  phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine also point to an increase in lipid biosynthesis.
  Glutaminolysis was increased to support maybe TCA activity. For clarity, increased
  pathways/metabolites are displayed in red, decreased pathways/metabolites are displayed
  in blue, and some intermediate metabolic steps are not illustrated. PC, phosphocholine;
  GPC, glycerophosphocholine; FFA, free fatty acids; αKG, α-ketoglutarate.
