caption: The spatial challenge of loading MHC-I with peptide from an extracellular
  source. Cross-presentation entails loading MHC-I molecules with peptides derived
  from extracellular cargo such as bacteria, viruses, and dying cells that are internalized
  through either phagocytosis or endocytosis. Endosomes and phagosomes carrying these
  cargos are physically distinct from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where MHC-I
  molecules are synthesized, folded, and loaded with peptides. The MHC-I heavy chain
  polypeptide is cotranslationally translocated into the ER lumen through the Sec61
  complex. Its first interaction is with the chaperone calnexin and is followed by
  assembly with β2-microglobulin (β2m). The MHC-I heavy chain/β2m heterodimer is unstable
  at this stage and is recruited by calreticulin to the peptide-loading complex (PLC)
  as part of its folding. Direct association of the empty MHC-I molecules with tapasin
  along with supporting interactions with calreticulin and ERp57 in the PLC stabilizes
  the empty MHC-I molecule and favors a conformation of the binding groove that is
  receptive to binding high-affinity peptides in the ER. Within the PLC, the transporter
  associated with antigen processing (TAP) translocates into the ER cytosolic peptides
  that are generated by proteasomal degradation of endogenous proteins, such as those
  derived from the translation of cellular proteins or viral proteins when cells are
  virally infected. These peptides are further trimmed by the ER aminopeptidases ERAP1
  and ERAP2 to accommodate the peptide length preferred by MHC-I. After peptide loading,
  MHC-I molecules traffic to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) via COPII-coated
  export vesicles, where they are subjected to quality control (QC) by calreticulin,
  tapasin, and UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGT1). MHC-I molecules
  with low-affinity peptides (depicted as gray ovals bound to MHC-I) accumulate in
  the ERGIC when peptides with good affinity of loading are absent (for example, viral
  peptides depicted as green or cellular peptides depicted as orange). MHC-I molecules
  with suboptimal low-affinity peptides (gray ovals) serve as substrates for UGT1,
  and some accumulate in the ERGIC and reenter into the PLC for another cycle of peptide
  loading. Stable optimally loaded MHC-I molecules that pass QC are released and exported
  to the plasma membrane for recognition by CD8 T cells. The schematic depicts events
  in human cells. Slight variations, not shown here, apply to mouse cells. The classical
  pathway of MHC-I presentation takes place in all nucleated cells, whereas cross-presentation
  is a specialized function conducted predominantly by dendritic cells.
