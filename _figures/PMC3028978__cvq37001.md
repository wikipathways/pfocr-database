caption: The classic arginine–nitric oxide synthase–nitric oxide pathway. This figure illustrates
  the ‘classic’ nitric oxide pathway and both cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent
  and -independent signalling. Furthermore, the figure highlights the multiple levels
  of this pathway that can be taken advantage of for therapeutic benefit. One strategy
  is to increase nitric oxide synthase substrate availability via l-arginine supplementation
  or arginase inhibitors. Alternative strategies are to increase nitric oxide synthase
  enzymes via gene or protein therapy as well as direct deliver of nitric oxide gas
  via inhalation or pharmacological donors. Additionally, therapeutics take advantage
  of cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent signalling including phosphodiesterase
  inhibitors, such as sildenafil, and the direct guanylate cyclase activators such
  as riociguat.
