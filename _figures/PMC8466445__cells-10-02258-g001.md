caption: Anti-viral pattern recognition signalling pathways. Shown in this figure
  are the various signalling pathways used to respond to viral infection from DNA,
  RNA and retroviruses. Each of the major forms of nucleic acids that act as PAMPs
  from such viruses are illustrated along with the PRRs they bind to including TLRs,
  RLRs and DNA sensors such as cGAS. Each pathway activates specific kinases via their
  own adaptor molecules, and this ultimately leads to the activation of transcription
  factors that translocate to the nucleus and help initiate the transcription of cytokines
  such TNFα and IL6 or type I interferons, e.g., IFNβ, which then get released from
  the cell.
