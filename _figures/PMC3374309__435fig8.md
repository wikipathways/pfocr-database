caption: 'Evolution of the fungal pheromone-response pathway has occurred at the level
  of the pheromone-response factor. (A) Diverged transcription factors function as
  pheromone-response factors across fungal systems. The pheromone signal (triangle)
  is transduced via a conserved receptor and MAPK cascade signaling components, identifiable
  by sequence homology (conserved input). The transcription factor mediating the conserved
  response shows divergence among the species characterized (colored shapes representing
  diverged pheromone-response factors). Responses downstream of the pheromone-response
  factor are conserved across species (conserved output). Colored shapes (indicating
  type of DNA-binding domain) with species-specific designations represent the various
  pheromone-response factors and their binding sites. (B) Rewiring of transcription-factor
  function. Highest reciprocal BLAST hits were used to identify other predicted DNA-binding
  proteins with high sequence similarity to the pheromone-response factors in fungi.
  These factors are present in the genome but have been shown to control different
  pathways (not pheromone response). C. neoformans is unique because it encodes numerous
  homologs of the Ste12-like (Ste12a and Ste12α) and HMG-domain (Hmg1 and Hmg2) pheromone-response
  factors of other fungi, yet uses the diverged HMG-domain protein Mat2 as its pheromone-response
  factor. Key for DNA binding classes: yellow ovals, Ste12 like; orange hexagon, TEA/ATT;
  green rectangles, HMG-I; pink rectangles, HMG-I (diverged).'
