caption: Scheme highlighting the main findings of the study. Activation (or inhibition)
  of estrogen receptor α (ERα) by estrogen causes phenotypic changes in the liver
  and perigonadal white adipose tissue (pgWAT) of mice fed ethanol, and these lead
  to downstream secondary and tertiary effects involving altered pregnane X receptor
  (PXR), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2), and aryl hydrocarbon receptor
  (AhR) signaling that are likely because of an increase in ROS that activates or
  inhibits NRF2, and the production of endogenous ligands for PXR and AhR that activate
  these receptors. Together, these results suggest the existence of an ERα–PXR–NRF2
  signaling axis in liver and pgWAT, which contributes to sex differences seen in
  ALD and demonstrates a previously unrecognized ERα signaling pathway, which contributes
  to sex differences in ALD. ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species
