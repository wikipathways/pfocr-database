caption: 'Signal Transduction Pathways controlled by the activation of epidermal growth
  factor receptors (EGFR). Three steps can be defined in the activation of EGFR-dependent
  intracellular signaling. First, the binding of a receptor specific ligand occurs
  in the extracellular portion of the EGFR or one of the EGFR-related receptors (ERBB2,
  ERBB3 or ERBB4). Second the formation of a functionally active EGFR-EGFR dimer or
  an EGFR-ERBB2, EGFR-ERBB3 or EGFR-ERBB4 dimer, causes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation
  of specific tyrosine residues in the EGFR intracellular domain. Third, this phosphorylation
  triggers a complex program of intracellular signals to the cytoplasm and then to
  the nucleus. The two major intracellular pathways activated by EGFR are the RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK
  pathway, which controls gene transcription, cell-cycle progression from G1 to S
  phase, and cell proliferation, and the P13K-Akt pathway, which activates a cascade
  of anti-apoptotic and pro-survival signals. Legend: Akt: protein kinase B, HB-EGF:
  heparin binding epidermal growth factor, bFGF: basic fibroblast growth factor, MAPK:
