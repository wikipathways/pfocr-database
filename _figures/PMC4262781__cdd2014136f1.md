caption: Aberrant miRNA expression in liver cancer promotes cell-cycle progression.
  A simplified pathway of cell cycle regulation is presented that shows the effects
  of various aberrantly expressed miRNAs in liver cancer. Upregulated miRNAs are indicated
  with a red up arrow, and downregulated miRNAs are indicated with a green down arrow.
  Upregulated miRNAs exert a stronger inhibitory effect on their targets, whereas
  downregulated miRNAs mediate weaker effects on their targets. Taken together, multiple
  aberrant miRNAs act on this pathway to support cell cycle progression
