caption: 'Schematic of endogenous fructose production and metabolism in mammals. While
  bacteria, plants and yeast can produce fructose by isomerization of other polyols.
  In humans and most mammals, fructose can only be endogenously produced from glucose
  and sorbitol by the polyol pathway. While fructose can also be converted back into
  glucose, further metabolism of fructose stimulates triglyceride and uric acid accumulation
  which in turn contribute to the pathogenesis of features of metabolic syndrome and
  kidney disease along with other important factors including elevated free fatty
  acids, inflammation, oxidative stress, low energy expenditure, overfeeding or smoking
  among others. Abbreviations: AR: aldose reductase, SDH sorbitol dehydrogenase, KHK:
  fructokinase, AldoB: Aldolase B, DHAP: Dihydroacetonephosphate.'
