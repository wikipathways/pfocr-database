caption: 'Proposed mechanisms by which the interaction of dietary long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated
  fatty acids from fish oil and butyrate from bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber
  may reduce colon tumorigenesis. Butyrate induces colonocyte apoptosis via a nonmitochondrial,
  Fas-mediated, extrinsic pathway. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and butyrate, in combination,
  synergistically perturb intracellular Ca2+, stimulating mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake.
  This directly or indirectly decreases cytosolic Ca2+ and promotes store-operated
  channel (SOC)-mediated entry via plasma membrane channels. Mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation
  subsequently triggers the opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) and
  release of proapoptotic molecules, such as cytochrome c, and other factors, such
  as apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and second mitochondrial activator of caspases
  (smac/Diablo). Together, these effects culminate in the induction of procaspases
  and downstream caspases (Casp) that execute cellular apoptosis. Abbreviations: Apaf1,
  apoptotic protease-activating factor 1; Cyt-c, cytochrome c; EndoG, endonuclease
  G; SERCA, sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase.'
