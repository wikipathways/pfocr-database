caption: A schematic figure illustrating the interaction between TLR4 and Notch1 signaling
  pathways. The TLR4 receptor activated by LPS promotes the expression of inflammatory
  factors and the expression of Notch receptors and ligands through the NF-KB pathway.
  The increase in the expression of Notch receptors and ligands promotes the activation
  of the Notch signaling pathway. After activation, the Notch intra-cellular domain
  is released into the cytoplasm, which enhances the inflammatory response by promoting
  the activation of NF-KB. This study used TAK242 to block the TLR4 pathway and DAPT
  to block the Notch pathway. The relationship between the two pathways was investigated.
