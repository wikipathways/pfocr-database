caption: Classical ligand-activated βARs enhance cardiac contractility by coupling
  to Gs, formation of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase (AC), and PKA-dependent phosphorylation
  of various target proteins (e.g., ryanodine receptor [RyR]; phospholamban [PLN],
  troponin I [TnI], and the L-type Ca2+ channel [LTCC]). Chronic β1AR stimulation
  is detrimental and induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. In this issue
  of the JCI, Noma et al. () have delineated a novel signaling pathway leading to
  GRK- and β-arrestin–dependent Src-kinase (SRC) and MMP activation. MMP activation
  in turn sheds HB-EGF from the cell surface, and this serves as a ligand for cardiomyocyte
  EGFRs, which mediate ERK/MAPK activation. This pathway protects from β1AR-induced
  cardiomyocyte apoptosis but has been associated with cardiac hypertrophy.
