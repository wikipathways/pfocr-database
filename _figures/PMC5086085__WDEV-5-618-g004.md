caption: Mechanisms of ecdysone receptor B1 (EcR‐B1) signaling to trigger pruning
  in MB γ and da neurons. In da neurons, EcR‐B1 triggers dendrite pruning via Sox‐14
  and Hdc. Sox‐14 promotes pruning via Mical and Cullin1‐based SCF E3 ligase (see
  text for more information). In MB neurons cortex, and perhaps also astrocyte‐like,
  glia secrete Myoglianin (Myo) a TGF‐β ligand that binds to neuronal TGF‐β receptors
  that induce the expression of EcR‐B1 in MB γ neurons. Cell autonomous functions
  of Cohesin and Ftz‐F1 include the activation of EcR‐B1. EcR‐B1 activates Sox‐14,
  which functions in a non‐Mical dependent pathway, and probably other pathways, to
  induce pruning. Green indicates common factors in both systems and red are targets
  that were tested and found not to be involved.
