caption: 'Three mechanisms of pexophagy in mammalian cells. Three different forms
  of ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent pexophagy have been shown in mammals. 1) First, the
  ubiquitinylation of the overexpressed peroxisomal membrane-associated protein, PEX3,
  serves as a signal for the adaptor complex NBR1/p62, causing an induction of pexophagy.
  2) The second method of pexophagy is triggered by high amounts of reactive oxygen
  and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS), which cause the activation of the ATM-TSC2 signaling
  node, which resides on the peroxisome membrane. ATM performs two functions: a) activation
  of the AMPK-TSC2 signaling node and the suppression of the mTORC1, together inducing
  autophagy via the activation of ULK1. b) ATM phosphorylates PEX5 at S141 position,
  which serves as a signal for the Ub E3 ligase (PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12) and the ubiquitinylation
  at K209. Following ubiquitinylation, the autophagic receptor/adaptor p62 is activated,
  resulting in the induction of pexophagy by binding the targeted peroxisome to a
  phagophore. 3) The third pathway begins by the mono-ubiquitinylation of the peroxisome
  matrix protein import receptor, PEX5, on Cys-11 and blocks the recycling of this
  mono-ubiquitinylated PEX5 (due to the failure of the cargo delivery into the matrix
  of the peroxisome) from the peroxisomal cytosol via the receptor recycling complex
  (AAA-ATPases, PEX1, and PEX6 anchored at peroxisome membrane via PEX26), which serves
  as a signal for pexophagy.'
