caption: 'Under normal oxygen conditions (21% oxygen), HIF-1α proteins are proline
  hydroxylated by PHDs, ubiquitinated by VHL proteins and ultimately degraded via
  the proteaseome. Hypoxic conditions (< 6% oxygen) diminish PHD function and thus
  lead to HIF-1α stabilization. Non-hydroxylated HIF-1α translocates to the nucleus
  and dimerizes with ARNT. The HIF-1α:ARNT transcription factor complex binds to HRE
  sequences in target gene promoters. HRE: hypoxia response element; PHD: prolyl hydroxylase
  domain-containing enzymes; p300/CBP: histone actelytransferase p300/CREB-binding
  protein; VHL: von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor.'
