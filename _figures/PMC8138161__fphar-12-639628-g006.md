caption: Schematic representation of the mechanism of action of phytochemicals and
  reactive oxygen species (ROS), which lead to the control of several signaling pathways.
  ROS is produced by several internal and external stimuli. Extranally, ROS is activated
  through growth factors, LPS, TNF-α, thrombin, and inflammation. Different phytochemicals
  have been found to scavenge or decrease cellular ROS level by inhibiting or stimulating
  their action. Internally, phytochemicals inhibit PI3K or mTOR, which activates autophagy
  and reduces ROS production. Some phytochemicals have also been found to activate
  mitochrondrial ROS production while other phytochemicals scavenge ROS and protect
  against DNA damage. ROS production mediated by ER and inflammation activators is
  also reduced by phytochemicals, which modulate the autophagy-apoptosis pathways.
