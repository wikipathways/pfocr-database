caption: Ferroptotic signaling pathway. (A) Among phospholipids (PLs), PE-esterified
  AA or AdA are predominantly located in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane
  or nonbilayer arrangements in contrast to the high PC confinement on the outer membrane
  or ordered bilayer organization of PC-PUFAs []. The lipid hydroperoxides (PL-PUFA-OOH
  or PE-AA-OOH) are detoxified to alcohol (PL-PUFA-OH or PE-AA-OH) by GPX4. On the
  other hand, PL-PUFA-OOH and PE-AA-OOH yield iron-mediated peroxyl (R-OO•) or alkoxyl
  (R-O•) radicals; finally, reactive electrophiles transduce lipid death signals.
  These ferroptotic signals are attenuated by suppressing lipid peroxidation with
  vitamin E or iron chelation with DFO while being enhanced by lipoxygenases (LOXs)
  or acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) or lysophosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), which mediate PE esterification with PUFAs in addition
  to PC and phosphatidylserine (PS). The ferroptosis inhibitors are shown in red,
  while the ferroptosis inducers are shown in blue. (B) The compounds that trigger
  glutaminolysis or that inhibit the cystine/GSH/GPX4 axis, FSP1/CoQ10/α-Toc (ferroptosis
  suppressor protein 1/coenzymeQ10) axis, GCH1/BH4/DHFR (guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase
  1/tetrahydrobiopterin/dihydrofolate reductase) axis, or NADPH synthesis are categorized
  as ferroptosis inducers that may initiate tumor cell death, while PUFA metabolism
  suppressors or iron chelators are designated as ferroptosis inhibitors that may
  confer the prevention of ischemic injury, neurodegeneration, or pancreatic β-cell
  loss. In addition to these beneficial roles of ferroptosis, the protection of tumor-initiating
  cells is also speculated.
