caption: Role of bicarbonate generated by AIBCA in gluconeogenesis ll pathway. The
  conversion of CO2 to HCO3− is catalyzed by β-CA, which is shown with a purple arrow.
  HCO3− is a major element in conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate
  is used to generate aspartate, citrate, and phosphoenolpyruvate through transamination,
  citric acid cycle, and gluconeogenesis pathways, respectively
