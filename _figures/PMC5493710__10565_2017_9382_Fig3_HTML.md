caption: Improvement of the reprogramming process and replacement of c-Myc by small
  molecules and chemical compounds. c-Myc is normally involved in facilitation of
  MET via the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway. As shown, the oncogene
  can be replaced by SB431542 and L-Myc, an Myc family member with lower transformation
  activity. Furthermore, the positive effects of valproic acid (VPA), vitamin C (VitC),
  wingless type-3a (WNT3A) and CHIR9902, a GSK3 inhibitor, on iPSC generation are
  depicted, as well as bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4) and its function as MET
  inducer. VPA improves cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis through the suppression
  of the p16/p21 pathway (Zhai et al. ). Also, VPA directly activates the Oct4 promoter
  through stimulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway (Teng et al. ). VitC
  acts mainly through histone demethylases that reduce H3K36 methylation patterns.
  In addition, VitC-activated Jhdm1b has shown to cooperate with OCT4 in order to
  activate the miRNA 302/367 cluster which in PSCs is a downstream target of OCT4
  (Barroso-delJesus et al. ) and increases reprogramming efficiency by promoting MET
  (Subramanyam et al. )
