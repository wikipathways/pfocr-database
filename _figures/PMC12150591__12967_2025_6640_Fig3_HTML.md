caption: Differential regulation of oxidative stress and cell death by wild-type and
  mutant p53. This schematic diagram illustrates two distinct pathways by which oxidative
  stress influences cell fate in CRC depending on p53 status. In cells expressing
  wild-type p53, elevated ROS trigger mitochondrial translocation of p53, where it
  binds to cyclophilin D (CypD) to facilitate the opening of the mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore (mPTP). The subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction leads to necroptotic
  cell death, serving as a tumor-suppressive mechanism. In contrast, in cells harboring
  mutant p53, the normal protective functions are lost. Instead, mutant p53 actively
  promotes ROS production through activating pro-oxidant enzyme, metabolic rewiring
  and the induction of inflammatory signaling. Moreover, mutant p53 suppresses antioxidant
  transcription factors and catabolic processes that help mitigate ROS, resulting
  in sustained ROS production and further oncogenic stress. This figure was created
  specifically for this article with BioRender
