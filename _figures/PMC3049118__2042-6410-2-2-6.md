caption: Cardiovascular disease genes increase in the spleen of CVB3 infected males
  at 12 h pi. Male and female BALB/c mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 103
  plaque forming units of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) or phosphate buffered saline on
  day 0 and a microarray conducted on individual spleens at 12 h pi (five/group).
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of microarray data that had not been corrected for multiple
  comparisons revealed that genes associated with cardiovascular disease were increased
  in CVB3 infected males compared to infected females (Network 5). Red and green represents
  genes significantly up- or down-regulated, respectively.
papertitle: The innate immune response to coxsackievirus B3 predicts progression to
  cardiovascular disease and heart failure in male mice.
