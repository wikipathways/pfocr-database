caption: Activation of AhR pathway by mycotoxins (Myctx). (A) The AhR is a protein
  that interacts with hsp90, AIP, and p23 proteins in cytoplasm. (B) Under activation
  by Myctx, the transcription of phase I and phase II genes is started in order to
  metabolize and detoxify. It is not proved if the Myctx are ligands/agonists of AhR,
  which is indicated by a question mark (?). (C) This activation can also start transcription
  of several genes such as those involved in cell differentiation, adhesion, proliferation
  and immune response, but in the case of Myctx these have to be proved if it is performed
  as ligands/agonists (?).
