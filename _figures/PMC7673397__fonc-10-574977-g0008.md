caption: Map of the KEGG pathway “Pathways in Cancer” displaying genes with differentially
  expressed mRNA fragments and miRNA targets specific to a time period prior to diagnosis.
  The genes partially highlighted are significantly associated within the four time
  frames 0–2, 2–5, 5–8, or 8–10 years prior to diagnosis. Section of the gene highlighted
  corresponds to which time frame the gene is associated with, and color of the gene
  corresponds to how many time frames it can be found in.
