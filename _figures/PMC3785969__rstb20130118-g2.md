caption: An overview of Cdc42 regulation during mating. (a) Mating begins after exposure
  to mating pheromone from cells of the opposite mating type, which leads to the outgrowth
  of a mating projection, or ‘shmoo’. (b) The same Cdc42-based machinery used in budding
  drives polarized cell growth and shmoo formation during mating. In addition to regulating
  polarized secretion, Cdc42 also regulates the mating MAPK signalling pathway to
  turn on mating-specific genes required for cell fusion and the cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor Far1, leading to G1 arrest.
