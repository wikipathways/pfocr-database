caption: Venn diagram and speculative the pathway of B. rapa in response to freezing
  stress. (A) Venn diagram of differentially expressed transcription factors in different
  combinations before and after freezing treatment. (B) A proposed model of B. rapa
  in response to freezing stress. Under cold stress, the cell membrane of B. rapa
  first senses external cold signals, then the signals are transmitted to the nucleus
  by the MAPK cascades pathway, and many related transcription factors were induced
  to positively regulate plant freezing tolerance. Meanwhile, changes in hormone levels
  and Ca2+ concentration regulate related transcription factors to protect plants
  from freezing damage.
