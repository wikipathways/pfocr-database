caption: A working model for the role of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex
  1 (mTORC1) and its regulated macroautophagy in the induction of cardiomyocyte necroptosis
  by large doses of isoproterenol (ISO). It is posited that β‐adrenergic receptor
  stimulation by ISO activates myocardial mTORC1 signaling, which inhibits macroautophagy
  in part through suppression of TFEB signaling, which in turn promotes the activation
  of the necroptotic pathway. Dotted lines depict other potential but not tested pathways

  to the induction of cardiomyocyte necroptosis by catecholamine surges
