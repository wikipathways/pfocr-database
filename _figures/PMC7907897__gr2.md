caption: NRF2 regulatory mechanisms.A) three reported negative regulatory mechanisms
  of NRF2. KEAP1 is the first and major NRF2 negative regulator in cells. In normal
  condition, KEAP1 binds to NRF2 and connects NRF2 to Cullin3 E3 ubiquitin ligase,
  leads to NRF2 degradation in proteasome. In addition, GSK-3α/β kinases can phosphorylate
  NRF2 which lets it binding to β-TrCP-Cul1 ubiquitin ligase, leads to NRF2 degradation
  in proteasome. HRD1 is a recently identified E3 ubiquitin ligase which targets NRF2
  when activated by XBP1 under ER stress. So far, this regulatory pathway has only
  been reported during liver cirrhosis. B) NRF2 activation mechanisms. When cells
  are under stresses such as electrophilic stimuli, cysteine molecules in KEAP1 are
  modified (oxidized) that leads to release of NRF2 from KEAP1-Cul3-mediated ubiquitination.
  The free and newly-synthesized NRF2 then accumulates and translocates to nucleus
  and binds to the ARE on its target genes' promotor and activates its target genes.
  So far, about 250 target genes have been reported involving Phase I-III metabolism,
  redox regulation, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, iron/hemo metabolism and many
  other cellular processes. In addition to this canonic KEAP1 dependent mechanism,
  many non-canonic mechanisms have been reported. For example, KEAP1 genetic mutations,
  promoter hypermethylation which inactivate KEAP1, some proteins binding to KEAP1
  to interfere with KEAP-NRF2 interaction, such as p62, PALB2. Genetic mutations of
  NRF2, epigenetic regulation, phosphorylation and SUMOylation of NRF2 itself activate
  NRF2. Some proteins such as p21, BRCA1 and APE1 have been reported to bind to NRF2
  to interfere with NRF2-KEAP1 interaction. Taken together, the NRF2 is a master transcriptional
  regulator in cellular antioxidant function and other cellular processes. The regulatory
  mechanisms are complex and context-dependent.
