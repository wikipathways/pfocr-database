caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  implicated in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signalling pathway. Green shapes with
  pink borders indicate genes that were down-regulated in the rat prefrontal cortex
  following isolation rearing; ovals represent those encoding transcription regulators
  and diamonds represent those encoding enzymes. Blue indicates predicted inhibition,
  orange predicted activation and yellow predictions inconsistent with known expression
  of downstream molecules. Full names of the DEGs are provided in Supplementary Table
  2. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader
  is referred to the Web version of this article.)
