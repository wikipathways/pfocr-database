caption: The colored arrows indicate genetic evidence of proteins that catalyze the
  reactions that transform methanol into CO2 or cell material and colored dots indicate
  representation in the proteome. Gemmatimonadetes (purple) and Proteobacteria can
  oxidize formaldehyde via the tetrahydromethanopterin and glutathione-linked pathways,
  respectively, while Rokubacteria (blue) cannot. Formate is incorporated by the tetrahydrofolate-linked
  pathway then converted to serine by glycine hydroxymethyltransferase. Serine and
  glyoxylate are used by serine-glyoxylate transaminase to produce glycine and hydroxypyruvate,
  which is then converted to D-glycerate. D-glycerate can be phosphorylated by two
  different kinases, glycerate 2-kinase in Rokubacteria and glycerate kinase in Gemmatimonadetes.
  Both phosphoglycerates are converted by different enzymes to phosphoenolpyruvate
  (phosphoglycerate hydratase or phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase) and then to oxaloacetate
  by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Gemmatimonadetes and Proteobacteria (green)
  contain but Rokubacteria lack the canonical malate-intermediated serine formaldehyde
  assimilation pathway but do encode citric acid/glyoxylate cycle genes that could
  assimilate carbon (citrate synthase) and regenerate glyoxylate (isocitrate lyase).
