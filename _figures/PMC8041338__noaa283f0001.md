caption: Anticancer mechanism of imipridones. Data from the existing literature indicates
  that imipridones exert their anticancer effects primarily by binding to and potently
  activating the mitochondrial Clp protease proteolytic subunit ClpP, causing ClpP
  to lose its dependence on the chaperone protein ClpX (Step 1). Hyper-active Clp
  protease then depletes its target substrates including components of the respiratory
  complex chain, most strongly complex I and II proteins (Step 2). In turn, OXPHOS
  is impaired and cellular ATP is depleted (Step 2). Mitochondrial structural damage
  and distress occurs, concomitant with the state of energy deprivation leading to
  integrated stress response (ISR) activation (Step 3). The ISR is relayed to the
  nucleus through an undefined mechanism, involving the typical (phospho-eIF2α-dependent)
  or atypical (phospho-eIF2α-independent) pathway. ISR activation causes global translational
  attenuation, including reduced levels of cyclin D1 leading to cell cycle arrest
  (Step 4A). In conditions of prolonged stress, ATF4 and CHOP are upregulated, and
  together these transcription factors increase the expression of their target genes
  including GADD34, which promotes further protein synthesis and stress (thus further
  activating the ISR); the TRAIL receptor DR5, which can promote TRAIL-mediated extrinsic
  cell death; and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, which promote the intrinsic,
  mitochondrial cell death program (Step 4B). Created with BioRender.com.
