caption: 'Proposed metabolic versatility of Aarhus Bay M5 ANME-1. a During AOM (reversal
  of the methanogenesis pathway, red box), ANME-1 cells supply reducing equivalents
  (symbolized by electrons [e−]) to sulfate-reducing partner organisms via direct
  electron transfer (blue box). b During methanogenesis, partner organisms supply
  reducing equivalents from organic C oxidation to ANME-1 cells via hydrogen, different
  C substrates, and/or direct electron transfer (purple boxes). Abbreviations for
  enzymes and co-factors: H4-MPT, tetrahydromethanopterin; CoB-SH, coenzyme B; CoM-SH,
