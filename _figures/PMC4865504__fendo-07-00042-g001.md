caption: Human and rodent adrenal steroidogenic pathways. In the adrenal, upon stimulation,
  cholesterol esters (CE) from the LDL endocytic pathway (human) or the SR-B1 selective
  pathway (rodents) are hydrolyzed by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) to release free
  cholesterol (FC) as the common precursor for steroidogenesis. FC, which can also
  be synthesized de novo within the ER, traffics to the outer mitochondrial membrane
  and is then transported into the inner mitochondrial membrane by StAR, where it
  is cleaved by CYP11A to pregnenolone, a common precursor for all other steroid hormones.
  The adrenal cortex is the site of steroid hormone synthesis and different steroidogenic
  enzymes are expressed in cells located within different zones of the adrenal cortex,
  resulting in different classes of steroid hormones being released from different
  layers. The cells of the zona glomerulosa synthesize aldosterone, the cells of the
  zona fasciculata synthesize cortisol, and the cells of the zona reticularis produce
  androgens. In rodents, there is a very low level of CYP17; consequently, corticosterone
  is the dominant glucocorticoid produced.
