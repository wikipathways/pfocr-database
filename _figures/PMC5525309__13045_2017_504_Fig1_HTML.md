caption: 'Innate immunity. a Innate immunity and novel MADS recognition. The classical
  innate immune system provides immediate and non-specific defense against pathogen
  or injury-generated molecules via PAMP/DAMP+PRR recognition in phagocytes and TC.
  Super Ag, a subset of pathogen toxins, can also bind to a multitude of TCR leading
  to TC activation. In addition, we propose a novel MADS recognition pathway, which
  allows metabolic risk factors to activate the innate immunity via responsive metabolic
  sensors in phagocytes and TC. The activation of innate immunity leads to pathogen
  elimination and inflammation (APC formation, cytokine generation, and TC activation).
  b Evidences of innate immunity in TC. Stimuli such as PAMP/DAMP, inflammatory cytokines
  and super Ag activate different subsets of TC and stimulate TC proliferation, inflammatory
  cytokine production, and phagocytosis. Words in red emphasize our newly proposed
