caption: Schematic representation of PI3Ks signaling during G2/M progression and mitosis
  phase. During mitosis attenuation of PI3K/AKT pathway drives activation of FOXO
  proteins and transcription of genes involved in G2/M transition such as CdK1, Cyclin
  B, and PLK1. On the contrary, the inactivation of PI3KC3 is regulated by Cdk1 that
  inactivates components of the Exocyst involved in the mitotic progression. In addition,
  inhibition of Exocyst affects Cyclin B transcription promoting mitotic progression
  (Post-translational modification are represented by yellow circles, while elements
  controlled by transcriptional regulation are colored in green).
