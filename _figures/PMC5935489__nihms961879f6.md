caption: Schematic depiction of p38 MAP kinase pathway in response to elevated ROS
  levels and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to arrested differentiation and synaptic
  deficits in AD cybrid cells. Meanwhile, activated p38 MAP kinase pathway in turn
  promotes ROS production and augments mitochondrial dysfunction, eventually exacerbates
  the impaired differentiation and synaptic deficits in AD cybrid cells. Thus, blocking
  p38 MAPK activation using a pharmacological inhibitor of p38 MAPK (SB203580) could
  reverses AD mitochondria-mediated detrimental effects by suppressing ROS production
  and accumulation, powering mitochondrial function, and maintaining normal differentiation
  and synaptic development.
