caption: A model for miR-126-orchestrated regulation of pDC effector functions in
  lymph nodes undergoing an immune response. miR-126 expressed in pDCs promotes VEGFR2
  expression and VEGF-mediated signaling while blocking TSC1, a negative regulator
  of the mTOR pathway. Loss of miR-126, by reducing mTOR signaling in pDCs, decreases
  pDC survival and the expression of genes along the TLR–NF-κB pathway that drive
  the production of type I interferon (IFN). Reduced secretion of type I interferon
  results in viral spreading and dissemination. VEGF also acts on endothelial cells
  by promoting angiogenesis and vessel sprouting. The identification of cells that
  produce VEGF in lymph nodes during an immune response and whether pDCs directly
  contribute to endothelial proliferation or vascular remodeling remain to be delineated.
