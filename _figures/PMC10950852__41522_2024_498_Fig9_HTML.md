caption: The propylthiouracil (PTU)-induced rats exhibited hypothermia, disrupted
  body temperature (Tb) rhythm and hyperinflammation. Administration of ginseng (GS)
  to these rats reversed these phenotypes to the control levels, which was associated
  with activation of genes involved in thermal sensation, up-regulation of genes associated
  with the peripheral circadian clock such as Bmal1, and down-regulation of genes
  linked to inflammation, such as NF-κB, TNF-α, and TLR4, in the small intestine,
  liver and brown adipose tissue (BAT). Furthermore, ginseng treatment modulated the
  gut microbiota, increased metabolite-related receptors (such as FFAR3 and FXR) and
  reduced LPS-related receptors or sensors (such as TLR4 and Pglyrp1), leading to
  up-regulation of cAMP-PKA signaling pathway and down-regulation of the PI3K-AKT
  signaling pathway, and consequently reductions in systemic and local inflammation.
  Both the in vitro and vivo studies demonstrate that ginseng extracts could increase
  gene expression of circadian clock and reduce gene expression of inflammatory cytokines
  directly and indirectly through gut microbiota modulation and mediated by PI3K-AKT
  signaling pathways. The graphics was created with BioRender.com
