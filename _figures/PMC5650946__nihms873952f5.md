caption: B-FABP is expressed in neuroepithelial precursor cells of the developing
  brain and immature astrocytes, while E-FABP and H-FABP are normally detected in
  neurons. As molecular markers for the diagnosis of stroke, B-FABP and H-FABP concentrations
  reach peak value within 3 hours after stroke onset. Persistent increase of cerebral
  B-FABP and E-FABP in brain regions of proliferation suggests a potential role in
  neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia. CSF H-FABP levels are associated with the
  severity of subarachnoid hemorrhage. FAT/CD36 is mainly expressed in peripheral
  infiltrating immune cells after stroke, but also is found in microglia and astrocytes.
  CD36 is required for the activation of TLR2 signaling pathway to regulate inflammatory
  responses after cerebral ischemia, and is upregulated by the activation of PPARγ
  to facilitate hematoma resolution following cerebral hemorrhage
