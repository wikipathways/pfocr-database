caption: Cannabinoid receptors biased signaling mechanisms for OA treatment. The selective
  CB1 receptor agonist CB-05 primarily activates the Gαi protein signaling pathway
  rather than the β-arrestin signaling pathway, resulting in analgesic effects without
  inducing drug toxicity or cannabis addiction. The selective CB2 receptor agonist
  JWH133 predominantly activates the Gαi protein-mediated cAMP signaling pathway,
  demonstrating analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and chondroprotective effects. In contrast,
  GW833972A biases towards the β-arrestin activation pathway to achieve analgesic
  effects; however, its development is hindered by tolerance. (The figure was created
