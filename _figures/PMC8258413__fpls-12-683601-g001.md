caption: Local and long-distance, systemic regulation of nodulation using NODULE INCEPTION
  (NIN) and NIN-like proteins (NLPs). (A,B) Under conditions of low nitrate (NO3−),
  NIN activation is downstream from the initial perception of rhizobial nod factors
  by the LysM receptor-like kinases NFR1 and NFR5 in Lotus japonicus and LYK3 and
  NFP in Medicago truncatula, localized in the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells.
  Nodulation factor (NF) perception and signal transduction also require the LRR-RLK,
  SYMRK/DMI2, a cytoplasmic receptor-like kinase, NFR5-INTERACTING CYTOPLASMIC FORWARDING4
  (NICK4), and a perinuclear Ca2+ oscillation (Ca2+ spiking) mediated by several proteins,
  including DOES NOT MAKE INFECTION1 (DMI1), CNGC15a/b/c, and MCA8 located in distinct
  nuclear membranes. The Ca2+ oscillation is perceived by the CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT
  PROTEIN KINASE (CCaMK), DMI3, which interacts with and phosphorylates the transcription
  factor CYCLOP/IPD3. DELLA proteins promote DMI3–IPD3 interactions and phosphorylation
  of IPD3, and interactions between IPD3–NSP2–NSP1 complexes, which bind distinct
  cis-elements in the promoter sequence of NIN and activate NIN expression. The NF-induced
  NIN activation upregulates the expression of downstream genes including NF-YA1 and
  CRE1, which are essential for rhizobial infection and nodule organogenesis, respectively.
  NIN also binds directly to the promoter sequence and activates the expression of
  genes encoding CLE-like peptides such as CLE-RS1 and CLE-RS2 in L. japonicus, which
  are transported from the root to shoot, where they are perceived by the LRR-RLK,
  LjHAR1/MtSUNN. This leads to a reduced level of the mobile signal, miR2111 in the
  shoot and the root, and a corresponding increase in the transcript level of the
  miR2111 target, TML, which encodes a negative regulator of nodule initiation in
  the root. Conditions of low nitrogen (N) also activate a CEP1-CRA2 systemic pathway,
  which positively regulates the nodule number. (C,D) A high level of NO3− inhibits
  nodulation both locally and systemically. A high level of NO3− activates the expression
  of genes encoding the NLPs, NLP1, and NITRATE UNRESPONSIVE SYMBIOSIS1 (NRSYM1; NLP4),
  which directly activate the expression of genes encoding CLE35 and CLE-RS2 peptides
  in M. truncatula and L. japonicus, respectively. CLE-RS2 and CLE35 peptides function
  to inhibit the number of nodules formed on roots via the LjHAR1/MtSUNN-dependent
  autoregulation of nodulation (AON) pathway. A high level of NO3− also suppresses
  the CEP1 gene expression, diminishing the activity of a CEP1-CRA2 systemic pathway
  in the nodule number regulation. (D) Under conditions of high NO3−, NLPs (NLP1–NLP4
  in M. truncatula) are activated and accumulate in the nucleus, where they interact
  with NIN and compete with NIN for binding sites in promoter sequences of target
  genes or both. As a result, the expression of NIN-activated genes including CRE1
  and NF-YA1 is suppressed, inhibiting nodulation. A high level of NO3− also suppresses
  the expression of nodule cysteine-richs (NCRs) and LEGHEMOGLOBIN (Lbs), which results
  in the inhibition of nitrogenase activity. Solid and dashed lines indicate the processes
  that are supported by experimental evidence and putative, respectively. The size
  of the arrows indicates the relative strength of the signaling process.
