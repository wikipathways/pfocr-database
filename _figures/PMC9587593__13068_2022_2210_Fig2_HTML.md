caption: 'Traditional metabolic architecture comparison of the yeast-specific XuMP
  pathway and the bacteria-specific RuMP cycle based on the assumption that reactions
  take partly place in the cytosol. The flux routing of both pathways is highlighted
  as shaded arrows (purple, XuMP; orange, RuMP). It has to be underlined that both
  pathways share all reactions of the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. The
  figure highlights in this context the distinct routes and the interconnection. Therefore,
  both pathways rely closely on the regeneration of a pentose, xylulose 5-phosphate
  or ribulose 5-phosphate, respectively, which are condensed with formaldehyde for
  C1-assimilation. Key enzymes of methanol oxidation, XuMP and RuMP are shown in white,
  purple or orange circles, respectively. AOX: alcohol oxidase (1); DAS: dihydroxyacetone
