caption: (A) Association network of linc-RPIA identified in co-module 1. In co-module
  1, Linc-RPIA is predicted to regulate cancer-associated genes and is itself regulated
  by miR-16, miR-182 and miR-429. Most associated pathways are associated with the
  terms cancer or immune system. The blue squares represent pathways, the green triangles
  represent miRNAs, the yellow circles represent PCGs in that co-module. (B) Connected
  functional regulatory network for linc-RPIA. The functional networks were merged
  using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Linc-RPIA is related to TP53 and may also
  regulate SHC1 via an interaction with miR-429. The rhombus represents linc-RPIA.
  Connections between miRNAs and PCGs were obtained from IPA (Color version of this
  figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)
