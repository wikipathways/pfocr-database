caption: Etiology of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). (A) Methionine cycle is a source
  of homocysteine, which is further metabolized via transsulfuration and remethylation
  pathways. Around 50% homocysteine is cycled via transsulfuration pathway to produce
  cysteine, while the remaining 50% is re-methylated back to methionine via the folate
  1-carbon cycle. (B) The range of homocysteine levels in healthy vs. disease states.
  (C) Major causes of hyperhomocysteinemia. (D) Management of hyperhomocysteinemic
  conditions via supplementation with vitamins B6, B9, and B12. CBS, cystathionine-β-synthase;
  CSE, cystathionine γ-lyase.
