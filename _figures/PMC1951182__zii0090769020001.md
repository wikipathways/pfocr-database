caption: Leishmania glycoconjugates and relevant biosynthetic pathway steps. (A) Glycoconjugates.
  The detailed structures of L. major LPG, GIPLs, and PPGs, including the glycan core,
  cap, linkages, and anomeric configurations, are reviewed elsewhere (, ). In L. major,
  “x” refers to linear β-1,3-linked galactose residues that branch off the Gal-Man-P
  repeating units; these can be terminated in α-1,2-Ara residues in both LPG and PPG,
  at greatly elevated levels in metacyclic promastigotes. In L. mexicana, the PG side
  chains consist of mono-β-1,3-glucose residues in LPG and additional sugars in PPGs.
  (B) Condensed cellular biosynthetic pathway. The steps and/or enzymes responsible
  for the synthesis of GDP-d-Arap and its presumptive precursor d-Ara are unknown
  in Leishmania or other organisms. In contrast, the metabolic sequence leading to
  GDP-Man biosynthesis (Glc→Glc-6-P→Fru-6-P→Man-6-P→Man-1-P→GDP-Man) has been well
  characterized in Leishmania and other organisms (, ). Both PI-anchored glycans and
  dolichol phosphate (Dol-P) glycans can participate in the synthesis of GPI-anchored
  and N-linked glycoproteins (not depicted). In the Golgi apparatus, the PI-glycans
  can be further elaborated with additional sugars (requiring the provision of their
  respective nucleotide-sugar donors) forming GIPLs or forming and anchoring PG chains
  in the assembly of LPG and PPG (reviewed in reference ). The LPG5A/LPG5B dependency
  of GIPL Galp addition (shown by a dashed line) is considered to be likely given
  that the functionally similar LPG core Galf transferase LPG1 is localized in the
  Golgi apparatus (, ).
