caption: 'Molecular mechanisms and crosstalk among five cell death modalities: Apoptosis,
  Necroptosis, Pyroptosis, Ferroptosis, and Cuproptosis. (A) Apoptosis is a programmed
  form of cell death executed by activating intrinsic (mitochondrial pathway) and
  extrinsic (death receptor pathway) signaling pathways. These pathways ultimately
  activate caspases, enzymes that degrade key proteins within the cell, leading to
  orderly cellular disassembly and death. (B) Necroptosis is a controlled form of
  necrosis, considered an alternative to apoptosis, particularly when apoptotic pathways
  are inhibited. It is facilitated by activating specific signaling proteins, such
  as RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, promoting cell membrane rupture and subsequent leakage
  of cellular contents. (C) Pyroptosis is a form of cell death dependent on inflammasomes
  and caspases (such as Caspase-1, Caspase-4, Caspase-5, Caspase-11). This form of
  death involves gaseous swelling, ultimately leading to cell membrane rupture and
  the release of inflammatory mediators like IL-1β and IL-18.(D) Ferroptosis is a
  form of cell death driven by iron-dependent oxidative stress. Its hallmark is the
  accumulation of lipid peroxidation within the cell, primarily caused by uncontrolled
  iron-catalyzed reactions, leading to the loss of cell membrane integrity. (E) Cuproptosis
  is a form of cell death induced by copper. Copper ions directly interact with multiple
  mitochondrial fatty acid dehydrogenases, leading to protein aggregation and inactivation,
  thereby impairing mitochondrial function, and resulting in cell death. Caspase-6
  plays a critical crosstalk role in PANoptosis, mutually activating with caspase-3/7
  and cleaving downstream caspase-8 to promote apoptosis. It also facilitates apoptosis
  by cleaving RIPK1 and promotes necroptosis through interaction with RIPK3. Additionally,
  caspase-6 triggers the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated by ZBP1, regulating
  pyroptosis. Caspase-8 directly cleaves GSDMD to induce pyroptotic cell death, while
  caspase-9 promotes extrinsic apoptosis. GSDMD acts as an executor of multiple cell
  death pathways; ROS are implicated in triggering both ferroptosis and pyroptosis;
  Iron overload, a critical driver of ferroptosis, facilitates the opening of the
  mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), intensifying RIP1 phosphorylation
  and leading to necroptosis'
