caption: A proposed model showing the S-nitrosylation mediated cold stress signaling.
  Cold stress increased nitric oxide (NO) production. This increased NO reacts with
  low molecular weight thiols (LMT) such as glutathione to produce S-nitrosoglutathione
  (GSNO). Available thiol groups (ATGs) also showed an increase in response to the
  cold stress. GSNO reacts with these ATGs to produce S-nitrosothiols (SNOs). Increased
  SNOs promote the S-nitrosylation of constitutive as well as the regulatory proteins.
  S-nitrosylation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) reduces the cellular damage caused
  by reactive oxygen species by scavenging superoxide radicals (O−2). S-nitrosylation
  of myrosinase and epithiospecifier protein suggests the probable role of NO in regulating
  glucosinolates hydrolysis pathway. Identification of vacuolar calcium binding protein,
  glyoxylase I, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIases) and chaperonin 10 could
  be associated with the regulation of stress responses. The proposed model also reflects
  the physiological relevance of S-nitrosylation in regulating the Calvin cycle.
