caption: Proposed mechanismStimulation with growth factors such as PDGF induces spatial
  distribution of Abi1, which facilitates the activation of the Jak2/STAT3 pathway.
  The association of Abi1 with Jak2 renders the receptor in active state. Abi1 is
  upregulated in ∼50% of asthmatic airway smooth muscle cultures, promoting the activation
  of Jak2 and STAT3, hyperplasia, and airway smooth muscle (ASM) thickening.
