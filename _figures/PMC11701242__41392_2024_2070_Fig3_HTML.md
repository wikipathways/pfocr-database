caption: Mechanism and activation of the Hippo pathway through phase separation. Dynamic
  regulation of the Hippo pathway through phosphorylation events and the assembly
  of either activating or inhibiting condensates via phase separation, demonstrating
  the critical balance required for proper pathway function. a When the Hippo signaling
  pathway is active, MST1/2 initiates the activation of LATS1/2 by triggering phosphorylation
  events. AMOT (Angiomotin) and KIBRA also play roles in inactivating YAP/TAZ via
  phosphorylating MST1/2 and LATS1/2, respectively. The phosphorylated LATS1/2 kinases
  inhibit YAP/TAZ by phosphorylating them and controlling their subcellular localization.
  Phosphorylated YAP/TAZ is sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3, and
  eventually undergoes proteasomal degradation. Conversely, when Hippo signaling is
  deactivated, the STRIPAK complex regulates MST1/2 by phosphorylation, which suppresses
  the phosphorylation cascade, allowing YAP/TAZ to translocate to the nucleus. Once
  inside the nucleus, YAP/TAZ form complexes with TEAD transcription factors to activate
  the expression of their target genes. b Under normal conditions, the SLMAP-SIKE-STRIPAK
  complex assembles into a condensate that inactivates the Hippo pathway by preventing
  MST1/2 phosphorylation. However, during Hippo pathway activation, AMOT and KIBRA
  form condensates with MST1/2, LATS1/2, and YAP. When these activating condensates
  form, they inhibit the SLMAP-SIKE-STRIPAK condensate and lead to the generation
  of Hippo-activating condensates containing AMOT, KIBRA, and MST1/2. These coalesced
  condensates facilitate the phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ, thereby promoting Hippo pathway
  activation

  description: Mechanism and activation of the Hippo pathway through phase separation.
    Dynamic regulation of the Hippo pathway through phosphorylation events and the
    assembly of either activating or inhibiting condensates via phase separation,
    demonstrating the critical balance required for proper pathway function. a When
    the Hippo signaling pathway is active, MST1/2 initiates the activation of LATS1/2
    by triggering phosphorylation events. AMOT (Angiomotin) and KIBRA also play roles
    in inactivating YAP/TAZ via phosphorylating MST1/2 and LATS1/2, respectively.
    The phosphorylated LATS1/2 kinases inhibit YAP/TAZ by phosphorylating them and
    controlling their subcellular localization. Phosphorylated YAP/TAZ is sequestered
    in the cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3, and eventually undergoes proteasomal degradation.
    Conversely, when Hippo signaling is deactivated, the STRIPAK complex regulates
    MST1/2 by phosphorylation, which suppresses the phosphorylation cascade, allowing
    YAP/TAZ to translocate to the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, YAP/TAZ form complexes
    with TEAD transcription factors to activate the expression of their target genes.
    b Under normal conditions, the SLMAP-SIKE-STRIPAK complex assembles into a condensate
    that inactivates the Hippo pathway by preventing MST1/2 phosphorylation. However,
    during Hippo pathway activation, AMOT and KIBRA form condensates with MST1/2,
    LATS1/2, and YAP. When these activating condensates form, they inhibit the SLMAP-SIKE-STRIPAK
    condensate and lead to the generation of Hippo-activating condensates containing
    AMOT, KIBRA, and MST1/2. These coalesced condensates facilitate the phosphorylation
    of YAP/TAZ, thereby promoting Hippo pathway activation
