caption: 'Signaling partners of the p75NTR. The p75NTR is a single membrane-spanning
  receptor in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family with four cysteine-rich
  extracellular domains that bind each of the four neurotrophins: NGF, BDNF, NT-3
  or NT-4 with low affinity and their respective pro-forms with high affinity. The
  intracellular portion of the receptor contains a death domain that does not self
  activate thereby requiring interactions with other effector proteins. The intracellular
  domain also includes a chopper domain that may independently interact with APAF-1
  to induce apoptosis. The p75NTR can interact with at least three different receptor
  classes which mediate different outcomes: Trk receptors, sortilin and Nogo receptor.
  1) Heterodimerization with Trk receptors increases the affinity of the mature neurotrophin/Trk
  interaction and enhances pro-survival and growth signaling via PI3K-Akt, ERK or
  PLCγ pathways and downstream effectors such as TRAF6 and NFκB. Activated Trk receptors
  phosphorylate TACE/ADAM17 which initiates p75NTR cleavage. The receptor is further
  cleaved by γ-secretase which generates the intracellular domain (ICD) within endosomes.
  The ICD subserves a variety of functions depending on the fate of the endosome.
  Selective endosomal trafficking to sites of interaction with other proteins may
  determine to a large degree the outcome of p75NTR activation. Interactions of the
  ICD with neurotrophin receptor interacting factor (NRIF) may support apoptosis whereas
  interactions with Trk receptors may promote survival. 2) Interactions of p75NTR
  with sortilin allow high affinity binding of the pro-neurotrophins to the p75NTR/sortilin
  complex. Subsequent activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway and activation of JNK3 lead
  to apoptosis. However, most sortilin is found within late endosomes derived from
  the trans-Golgi network and may function independently to support neuron survival
  via anterograde trafficking of neurotrophin receptors and control of proBDNF secretion.
  3) Interactions of the p75NTR with the Nogo receptor and Lingo-1 play a role in
  the control of growth. Activation of RhoA by displacement of Rho-GDI and a concurrent
  suppression of Rac leads to collapse of growth cones, neurite retraction and decreases
  in spine density. An additional source of signaling is suggested by the transactivation
  (phosphorylation) of Trk receptors by G-protein coupled receptors. Although there
  are currently no known G-protein interactions with the p75NTR efforts are underway
  to identify potential trans-acting ligands that modify neurotrophin signaling. These
  various interactions affords the p75NTR the capacity to play a pivotal role in the
  regulation of numerous processes that determine the fate and functions of the cell.'
