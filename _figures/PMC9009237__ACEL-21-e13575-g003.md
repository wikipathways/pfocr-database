caption: Dopamine receptors and signaling pathways in neuroimmune network. Simplified
  schematic representation of DA acting via DRD1‐ and DRD2‐like receptors by G protein‐dependent,
  by stimulatory (Gαs) or inhibitory Gαi/o subunits, or by G protein‐independent β‐arrestin‐2
  (βArr2)‐dependent pathway (for details, see the text). DA binding to DRD1‐like receptor
  subtypes can elicit two transduction pathways, of which one is coupled to Gαs/olf,
  driving adenylyl cyclase increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) activity.
  In addition to DRD1 effects on cAMP‐regulated signaling, DRD1Rs couple to Gαq to
  modulate phospholipase C (PLC) pathway, in turn activating phospholipid turnover
  and increasing diacylglycerol (DAG), releasing Ca2+ from internal stores, and activating
  protein kinase C (PKC). D2‐like receptor subtypes, coupled to Gαi/o, suppress cAMP
  activity, thereby producing an inhibitory effect upon DA binding. The G protein‐independent
  D2R signaling is represented by βArr2‐mediated signaling. The activation of the
  D2‐like receptors contributes to the constitution of a protein complex composed
  of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), serine/threonine kinase (Akt), and βArr2, where
  PP2A increases the dephosphorylation and inactivation of Akt, leading to the modulation
  of glycogen synthase kinase‐3 (GSK‐3) activation
