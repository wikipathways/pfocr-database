caption: Schematic overview of the mechanisms involved in PKG-induced regulation of
  L-type CaV channel activity and insulin secretion. A) The L-type channel complex
  is composed of the pore-forming CaV α1 and auxiliary subunits (CaV α2 δ, CaV β,
  and CaV γ). The pore-forming CaV α1 subunits consist of four transmembrane domains
  (I–IV) and the linker joining II and III encompasses the putative PKG phosphorylation
  sites (S793 and S860). B) NO is synthesized by the enzyme NO synthase (NOS) through
  the oxidation of L-arginine to NO and L-citrulline, with the assistance of cofactors.
  NO endogenously produced by NOS or released from exogenously applied NO donors (sodium
  nitroprusside, SNP) activates NO-sensitive guanylate cyclase (GC) leading to increased
  synthesis of cGMP which activates PKG. The protein kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation
  of the L-type CaV channels which cause a decrease in Ca2+ influx through the cell
  membrane resulting in reduced release of insulin in RIN-m5F cells. The inhibitory
  action of PKG is blocked by the selective inhibitor KT-5823 and terminated by protein
  phosphatases (PPh). Calyculin A, is a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor.
