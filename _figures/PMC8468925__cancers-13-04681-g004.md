caption: Targeting immune defects associated with a defective p53 pathway. p53 plays
  an important role in the regulation of antitumor immunity. p53 defective tumors
  evade immune response through multiple mechanisms, including impaired antigen presentation
  and T/NK cell activation, as well as macrophage reprogramming towards tumor-supporting
  phenotypes. In addition, the accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage with subsequent
  activation of cGAS/STING and type I interferon response could lead to upregulation
  of the T-cell inhibitory molecule PD-L1. These aspects of immune evasion can be
  counteracted by the use of various immunomodulatory agents. Defects in the p53 pathway
  are also associated with enhanced generation of neoantigens. This provides an opportunity
  for the generation of neoantigen vaccines as a strategy to eradicate p53-mutant
  tumor cells.

  description: Targeting immune defects associated with a defective p53 pathway. p53
    plays an important role in the regulation of antitumor immunity. p53 defective

    Defects in the p53 pathway are also associated with enhanced generation of neoantigens.
    This provides an opportunity for the generation of neoantigen vaccines as a strategy
