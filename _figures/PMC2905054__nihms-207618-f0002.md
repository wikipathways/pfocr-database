caption: 'In glycolysis, an alternative pathway for producing ATP under mitochondrial
  dysfunction, two ATP, two NAD+ and two pyruvate molecules are generated for each
  glucose molecule consumed via a series of ten catalyzed reactions. The high-energy
  electrons of glycolytic NAD+ are shuttled (via the malate–aspirate and glycerol-3-phosphate
  shuttles) into the mitochondria, while the final destination of the pyruvate molecules
  is the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the mitochondrial matrix. Oxidative phosphorylation
  involves a series of coupled enzyme complexes (I–IV) in the electron transport chain
  to generate a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that activates
  the ATP synthase (complex V), which provide the majority of cellular ATP. In addition,
  the free electrons in the electron transport chain (especially from complex I and
  III) generate singlet oxygen species, which cause oxidative stress and the loss
  of ΔΨm in the absence of antioxidant defense mechanisms. The release of CytC from
  the inner mitochondrial membrane triggers apoptosis ANT: Adenine nucleotide translocator;
  CoQ: Coenzyme Q; CytC: Cytochrome C; FAD: Flavin adenine dinucleotide; FADH2: Reduced
  flavin adenine dinucleotide; IMM: Inner mitochondrial membrane; mPTP: Mitochondrial
  permeability transition pore; NADH: Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; OMM:
  Outer mitochondrial membrane; TCA: Tricarboxylic acid; VDAC: Voltage-dependent anion
  channel; VDCC: Voltage-dependent calcium channel.'
