caption: 'Vitamin D signaling pathway: 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3), also known
  as calcitriol, binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and promotes its heterodimerization
  with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). The activated VDR/RXR heterodimer then recruits
  coregulator complexes and binds to the vitamin D response elements (VDRE) in the
  promoters of a large number of genes involved in fundamental processes, including
  cell survival and immune response to injury, thus modulating their transcription
  and subsequent effects in a ligand-dependent manner.'
