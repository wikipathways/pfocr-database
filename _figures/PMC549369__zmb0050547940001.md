caption: The sterol biosynthetic pathway in yeast. Following conversion of acetyl
  coenzyme A to squalene (), the later stages of ergosterol synthesis convert squalene
  to the final product of the pathway, ergosterol. A key step in this process, the
  demethylation of lanosterol, is catalyzed by Erg11p. Erg11p is the target of the
  antifungal drugs itraconazole and fluconazole, and earlier work by Hand et al. ()
  suggested that Dap1p also targets Erg11p. Cyb5p also contributes to Erg11p activation
  in vitro () (dashed line). In dap1Δ mutants, squalene and lanosterol are elevated
  while zymosterol is decreased (). In addition, dap1Δ mutants are sensitive to itraconazole
  (). Episterol and ergosta-5,7-dienol are downstream metabolites of lanosterol.
