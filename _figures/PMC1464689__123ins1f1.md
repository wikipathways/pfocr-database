caption: A Model for the Brassica SI Reaction.The SI response occurs within the stigmatic
  papilla cells. When a pollen grain alights on the papilla surface, the pollen coat,
  containing pollen coat proteins such as PCPs (black trapezoids) and the recently
  identified pollen S ligand, SCR (black circles), flows to form a layer (shown in
  light gray) between the pollen and stigma. If, as shown in this case, the SCR carried
  within this coating is allelic with the recipient stigma, an incompatible reaction
  is triggered. S allele–specific recognition of SCR by the extracellular region of
  the S receptor kinase (SRK) results in activation of its intracellular Ser-Thr protein
  kinase domain (shown as a black star). Although the role of the S locus glycoprotein
  (SLG), which has the same structure as the extracellular domain of SRK, is unclear,
  it may function as an accessory receptor, or alternatively, it may have a more general
  role in the pollen–stigma interactions. After activation, SRK phosphorylates ARC1,
  presumably initiating an intracellular signaling cascade within the papilla cell.
  Although a detailed analysis remains to be undertaken, evidence suggests that the
  signaling pathway may ultimately regulate the activity of aquaporins in the stigmatic
  papillae to limit the availability of water to the incompatible pollen.
