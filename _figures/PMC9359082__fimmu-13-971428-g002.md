caption: Effects and mechanisms of CMTM6 and CMTM4 in regulating the function of tumor
  and endothelial cells in TME. (A) CMTM6 promotes tumor proliferation, migration
  and invasion by activating the mTOR pathway. (B) CMTM6 maintains stem cell-like
  properties through affect Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, mainly manifested by
  elevated expression of several CSC-related markers such as CD44, ALDH and BMI1.
  (C) CMTM6 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by stabilizing vimentin,
  which behaved as the E-cadherin decreased. (D) CMTM4 positively affected CSC-like
  properties via the AKT pathway, mainly manifested by significantly elevated expression
  of CSC markers (CD44, ALDH1, BMI1, and SOX2). (E) CMTM4 promotes EMT through positive
  regulation of SLUG. (F) CMTM4 plays an important role in regulating angiogenesis
  by enhancing the bio-availability of VE-cadherin at cell-cell adherens junctions
  and promoting endothelial barrier function.
