caption: 'DNA repair pathway choice and the effect of AKT (green lines: successful
  pathway; red lines: failing pathway). Critical DNA lesions are induced by methylating
  agents, IR, cisplatin, and TOPs inhibitors. Eukaryotes have developed different
  DNA repair pathways to deal with the different types of DNA damage. The thick grey
  lines represent the pathway that successfully repairs DNA adducts, and the thin
  grey lines represent the process for forming DSBs, which is necessary to trigger
  apoptosis or cell senescence. AKT participates in this process on many levels.'
