caption: Proposed model illustrating how KLHL21 modulates the NF-κB signaling pathway
  via targeting IKKβ. In resting cells, KLHL21 protein specifically binds to IKKβ
  and inhibits its activation, which leads to the suppression of NF-κB signaling.
  Their interaction is gradually attenuated in response to TNFα treatment, which leads
  to the release of IKKβ and the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This results
  in the up-regulation of those immediate early response genes, including NFKBIA (encoding
  IκBα). Up-regulation of IκBα leads to the termination of NF-κB signaling and down-regulation
  of its relative late phase target genes, such as CXCL1, IL-8, and IL-1B. Furthermore,
  the expression of KLHL21 is rapidly down-regulated in macrophages upon extracellular
  proinflammatory stimuli treatment, which also releases its inhibitory effects on
  IKKβ activation.
