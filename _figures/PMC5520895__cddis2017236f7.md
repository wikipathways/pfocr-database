caption: Proposed signaling of Brg1-mediated Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation in HIR injury.
  Keap1 dissociation from Nrf2 leads to Nrf2 translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus
  during HIR injury. However, with poor efficiency, hepatocyte could not produce enough
  antioxidant HO-1, which is the downstream target gene of keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Upregulation
  of the chromatin remodeling factor Brg1 could enhance transcription factor Nrf2
  binding to HO-1 DNA sequence and promote HO-1 generation in a high efficiency way.
  Antioxidant enzyme HO-1 then suppresses the free radical generated from oxidative
  burst during hepatocyte H/R injury
