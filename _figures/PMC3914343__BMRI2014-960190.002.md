caption: RLRs signaling pathway and the possible regulatory manners of LGP2. Viral
  dsRNA was recognized by RIG-I or MDA5, triggering signal transduction to nucleus
  and inducing the production of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines. The cooperative
  or competitive roles of LGP2 in RLR pathway activation are controversial. Whether
  the interaction between viral protein and LGP2 shows any antiviral response remains
  unclear, and the affection of LGP2 on IRF3 activation still needs more exploration.
