caption: Signaling mechanisms of the UPR system and autophagy in normal and malignant
  plasma cells. (A) Normal B cells and PCs use three primary pathways associated with
  the UPR that respond to proteasome stress. The PERK pathway inhibits eIF2B through
  phosphorylation to promote ATF4 expression, inducing transcription of ROS resistance
  genes. PERK causes both decreased and increased protein synthesis, but overall decreases
  protein synthesis. The ATF6 pathway can drive chaperone protein gene expression
  and XBP-1 activity in the IRE1 pathway. The IRE1 pathway increases XBP-1 activity,
  inducing expression of ATG5, an important factor involved in autophagy activation,
  linking the UPR with autophagy. (B) A representation of some of the changes to these
  systems in multiple myeloma. NFkB is constitutively activated in a significant proportion
  of MM neoplasms due to activating mutations. Elevated NFkB activity induces XBP-1
  expression, promoting autophagy and uncontrolled B cell transformation to MM cells.
  Caspase-10 expression serves as a survival factor for MM cells by attenuating autophagy
  and preventing autophagic death due to cellular overactivation.
