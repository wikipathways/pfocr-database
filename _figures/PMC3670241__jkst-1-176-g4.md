caption: Figure 4. Testis stem cell niche. (A) Hub cells are post-mitotic and function
  as a niche to support two populations of stem cells, germline stem cells (GSCs)
  (pink/red) and cyst stem cells (CySCs) (dark blue). GSCs can divide asymmetrically
  to self-renew and give rise to gonialblasts (GB), which undergo four mitoses with
  incomplete cytokinesis to generate spermatogonia. CySCs also divide asymmetrically
  but their progeny, the cyst cells (light blue), are post-mitotic, and envelop the
  developing germ cells while providing required support for their developmental progression.
  (B) Hub cells secrete the JAK-STAT ligand Upd. STAT92E activation (pSTAT) is required
  for CySC self-renewal and for adhesion to the niche in GSCs but for not GSC self-renewal
  per se. The STAT92E target genes zfh1 and chinmo are also required for CySC self-renewal.
  In addition, hub cells produce bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and activation
  of BMP signaling in GSCs is required for their self-renewal. Furthermore, sustained
  activation of the JAK-STAT pathway or mis-expression of its targets zfh1 and chinmo
  in CySCs causes BMP expression and expands both the CySC and GSC populations.
