caption: Mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of PT on IDD. PT could downregulate
  the expression of inflammation-specific targets including TNF-α, FOS, JUN, PTGS2
  and EDN1 on the TNF-α signaling pathway as well as cellular senescence marker p16,
  inflammatory factor IL-6, and upregulate the expressions of COL2A1 and ACAN, thus
  leading to a suppressive effect on inflammatory response and oxidative stress in
  NPCs.
