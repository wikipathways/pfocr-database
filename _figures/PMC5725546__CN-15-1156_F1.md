  [, ]. Morphine activates TLR4 receptors with subsequent release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines [], such as TNF-α, which influences P-gp and Bcrp expressions at the BBB
  via a signaling pathway involving TNF-α receptor 1 (TNF-R1), endothelin-converting
  enzyme (ECE), endothelin-1 (ET-1), endothelin A and B receptors (ETA/B), nitric
  oxide synthase (NOS), protein kinase C (PKC), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), as
  previously described [, , ]. During either morphine withdrawal or in the epileptic
  brain, high glutamate levels are found in the brain extracellular fluid [-, ], which
  induce overexpression of P-gp and Bcrp at the BBB in endothelial cells by an NMDA
  receptor and COX-2-dependent mechanism [, , , , ].
