caption: (A) The dual roles of autophagy in cancer. The main process of autophagy
  includes formation and maturation of the phagophore, autophagosome, and autolysosome,
  which lead to the degradation and recycling of the sequestered contents. During
  tumor development and in cancer therapy, autophagy promotes both tumor suppression
  and tumor survival. (B) Multiple roles of HMGB1 in autophagy. Nuclear HMGB1 modulates
  the expression of heat shock protein β-1 (HSPB1). Loss of either HMGB1 or HSPB1
  results in a phenotypically similar deficiency in mitophagy and autophagy. This
  pathway requires phosphorylation of HSPB1 (both Ser15 and Ser86) to modulate actin
  polymerization and reorganization. Cytoplasmic HMGB1 is a novel Beclin 1-binding
  protein active in autophagy. HMGB1 C23 and C45 is required for HMGB1 binding to
  Beclin 1. p53 and unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) have opposing roles in regulation
  of the HMGB1- Beclin 1 complex formation in cancer cells. The ULK1 kinase is an
  essential component of the core autophagy machinery. Extracellular HMGB1 induces
  autophagy by receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and this role
  is dependent on HMGB1’s redox state.
