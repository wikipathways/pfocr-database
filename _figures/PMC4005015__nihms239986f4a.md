caption: Fig. 4a. Glucose metabolism in euglycemia vs. hyperglycemia under normoxic
  conditions. Compared with euglycemia, hyperglycemia induces mitochondria-derived
  superoxide (O2−) and four glycolysis-related pathways (see –), including polyol,
  hexosamine, AGE, and PKC pathways, and excess cytosolic HIF. The left panel demonstrates
  normal aerobic respiration in a euglycemic condition. After glycolysis, the glucose
  metabolite, pyruvate, is produced. Pyruvate enters the mitochondria to generate
  ATP and water (H2O). The right panel demonstrates that hyperglycemia drives glycolysis
  to generate the four adverse side pathways noted above.(also see –) In the mean
  time, driven by the hyperglycemia, the ETC is obstructed in coenzyme Q by an abnormally
  high mitochondrial membrane potential and generates superoxide (O2−), which may
  activate PARP, a DNA repair enzyme which needs GAPDH as a cofactor and is only found
  in the nucleus. This gives rise to the decrease of cytosol GAPDH and further exacerbates
  of the four glycolysis-associated pathways induced by hyperglycemia. The mechanism
  underlying the movement of GAPDH from the cytosol to the nucleus under high glucose
  conditions involves the E3 Ub ligase siah-1, which facilitates hyperglycemia-induced
  GAPDH nuclear translocation via formation of a complex with GAPDH. Furthermore,
  because hyperglycemic AGEs, PKC, and mitochondrial ROS may give rise to the over
  expression and decreased degradation of HIF, the excess HIF proteins may switch
  pyruvate metabolism from transformation through the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation
  in the ETC to conversion to lactate in the cytoplasm (also see  for more details).
  Remarkablly, PKC can be also activated through hyperglycemic polyol pathway () and
  hyperglycemic hexosamine pathway (). The cell may defend against superoxide using
  the mitochondrial isoform of superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD). This enzyme degrades
  the oxygen free radical to hydrogen peroxide, which is then converted to H2O and
  O2 by other enzymes.Fig. 4b. Glucose metabolism in euglycemia vs. hyperglycemia
  under hypoxic conditions. In euglycemia, HIF pathway is turn on by hypoxia-activated
  HIF. Under hyperglycemic conditions, the HIF pathway is enhanced by hyperglycemia-induced
  AGE and PKC pathways. The left panel indicates the HIF is activated and induces
  two aspects of the cellular responses, including switching glucose metabolism and
  turning on HIF pathway. Cytosolic HIF switches glucose metabolism from aerobic respiration
  to fermentation, the end product of which is lactate. The HIF pathway activated
  by hypoxia-activated HIF may induce a range of deleterious effects. However, when
  hypoxia coincides with hyperglycemia (right panel), which results in the formation
  AGEs and activation of PKC during glycolysis, HIF pathway is further enhanced by
  hyperglycemia. Remarkablly, PKC can be also activated through hyperglycemic polyol
  pathway () and hyperglycemic hexosamine pathway (). Furthermore, in adaptation of
  lower efficiency of ATP generation from fermentation, the activations of some HIF-inducible
  genes in HIF pathway may increase glucose uptake and up-regulate glycolysis pathway
  (also see ). Therefore, in hyperglycemic, hypoxic conditions HIF pathway may further
  deteriorate the four glycolysis-associated pathways.
