caption: Figure 3. IL-1RI and TLRs share a common intracellular signaling pathway.
  Mature IL-1α and IL-1β mediate their functions by binding to the same IL-1 receptor
  I (IL-1RI) which is present on the surface of most cells (1a). Pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMP) and damage/danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP)
  bind to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (1b). IL-1RI and TLRs share a common intracellular
  signaling pathway (2), which leads to activation of NFκB and hence to the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα (3). Therefore,
  IL-1α and IL-1β function within positive feedback loops in inflammation. Because
  of this common signaling pathway, IL-1α and IL-1β operate as natural adjuvants,
  mimicking the detection of microbial products by TLRs. MyD88, Myeloid Differentiation
  primary response gene 88; TRAF6, TNF receptor associated factor 6.
