caption: 'Potential synthesis and degradation pathways of NADA, including its targets.
  The first proposed pathway involves N-arachidonoyl tyrosine, which can be metabolized
  by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to N-arachidonoyl DOPA and by l-amino acid decarboxylase
  (AADC) to NADA. The second pathway describes the formation of NADA from arachidonic
  acid and dopamine by FAAH. Three different ways of NADA inactivation were postulated:
  catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) mediated its transformation to an O-methyl
  derivate, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) hydrolases NADA to arachidonic acid,
  and dopamine and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathway metabolizes NADA to omega hydroxylated
  metabolites (HETE-dopamine). Main targets of NADA, among others, are CB1 and TRPV1
  receptors mainly located on central neurons and DRGs, intracellular enzymes, and
  transcription factors. CB, cannabinoid; NADA, N-arachidonoyl dopamine; TRPV, transient
  receptor potential vanilloid.'
