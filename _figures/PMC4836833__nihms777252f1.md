caption: G-protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling in platelets. Binding of an agonist
  on the extracellular loop of the GPCR is associated with the exchange of GTP for
  GDP on the α subunit resulting in the dissociation of the α subunit from βγ subunit.
  Depending on the receptor type, the α subunit activates phospholipase C-β (PLC-β),
  Rho-GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor), or adenylyl cyclase, whereas the βγ
  subunit activates phosphotidylionisitol 3-kinase (PI3K) and PLC-β. Protease activated
  receptor (PAR) is activated by thrombin by creating a tethered ligand or through
  a noncanonical mechanism where cleavage by a proteinase occurs at a site different
  from the canonical cleavage site. The tethered ligand can also stimulate signaling
  through a G-protein–independent pathway involving β-arrestin–mediated signaling
  scaffold. β-arrestin is also involved in the internalization and desensitization
  of the PAR receptors.
