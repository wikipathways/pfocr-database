caption: Multitarget based screening of anticancer natural compounds. Pro-inflammatory
  mediators like TNFα, JL2, JL12, etc. binds to the receptor on the cell surface which
  undergoes a conformational change and activates JNK 1/2. JNK1/2 phosphorylation
  leads to apoptosis that releases inflammatory factors like NFKβ that also releases
  inflammatory factors like TNF-α which plays role in cell death amplification. IL6
  activates JAK/STAT pathway that results in cancer cell proliferation. TGFFβ also
  activates various pathways leading to liver fibrosis. EGFR binds to the cell surface
  receptor that activates GRB2. Phosphorylation of GRB2 activates the downstream pathway
  as GABI further activates P13K that activates AKT leading to cell survival. Natural
  fragments like indole, quinoline, isoquinoline, and piperidine inhibit both the
  inflammation pathway and EGFR in cancer cell growth.
