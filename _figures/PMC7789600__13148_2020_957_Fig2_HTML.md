caption: 'The roles of lipoproteins in the exogenous, endogenous, and reverse cholesterol
  pathways. Exogenous lipoprotein pathway (orange background): Lipid metabolism starts
  after food intake when chylomicrons are formed in the small intestine through the
  exogenous lipoprotein pathway []. Endogenous lipoprotein pathway (green background):
  The liver takes up chylomicron remnants, and the endogenous lipoprotein pathway
  then begins with the formation of VLDLs. VLDLs mainly transport TG from the liver
  to other tissues, in this process converting to IDLs and LDLs through the emission
  of fatty acids, and an increase in their cholesterol content []. Reverse cholesterol
  transport (RCT) pathway (blue background): The RCT delivers cholesterol from peripheral
  tissues back to the liver in both a direct and indirect manner. While in the direct
  RCT pathway effluxed cellular cholesterol is loaded onto HDLs for transportation,
  in the indirect RCT pathway cholesterol from HDLs is exchanged for TGs and transported
  by chylomicrons, VLDLs, and IDLs [, ]. In lipoprotein particles, yellow circles
  represent lipids and blue lines represent proteins. Solid arrows represent paths
  through which changes in lipoproteins occur. Segmented arrows represent paths that
  fatty acids follow. Dotted arrows represent paths that CE and TG follow. CE: cholesterol
  esters; TG: triglycerides; FFA: free fatty acids; CETP: cholesterol ester transfer
  protein; HTGL: hepatic triglyceride lipase; LCAT: lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase;
  LPL: lipoprotein lipase'
