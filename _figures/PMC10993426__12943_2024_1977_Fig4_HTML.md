caption: Metabolites, metabolic pathways and related metabolic genes that play the
  roles in pyroptosis. NLRP3 plays an important role in the process of pyroptosis,
  which inhibition of NLRP3 will lead to the downregulation of pyroptosis. LDLR inhibits
  pyroptosis by mediating NLRP3. DHA promotes pyroptosis through affecting caspase1,
  and FABP4 exert the same effect through activating GSDMD. GPX4 inhibit pyroptosis
  by affecting the processing of GSDMD by caspase11, respectively. The red boxes represent
  negative regulators and the green boxes represent positive regulators
