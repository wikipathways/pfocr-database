caption: 'Proposed generalized metabolic constellations in Emiliania huxleyi under
  N-replete and N-limited conditions: Under N-replete conditions (top), photosynthetic
  light reactions produce ATP and NADPH, which are consumed in the photosynthetic
  Calvin cycle. After export from the plastid, the produced carbohydrates are submitted
  to glycolysis to produce pyruvate (Pyr), which is transported to mitochondria and
  burned in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA-) cycle. The NADH created in cytoplasm and
  mitochondrion is fed into the quinone-pool (Q) of the mitochondrial respiratory
  chain. Lipogenesis that relies on the shuttling of citrate and malate as well as
  NADPH production by the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) works normally. Plastidary
  N-assimilation via the GS-GOGAT cycle provides amino acids for protein synthesis.
  Under N-limited conditions (bottom), photosynthesis, i.e., carbon and energy input
  is minimized, so that the flux through glycolysis and the TCA cycle is reduced.
  Cells strongly induce the citrate-shuttle that exports acetyl-CoA into the cytoplasm
  and increase the relative intensity of lipid turnover (synthesis and oxidation),
  which provides required sinks for excess reduction equivalents. To facilitate electron
  input into Q under these adverse flux conditions, cells make use of a malate:quinone
  oxidoreductase (MQO). Mitochondrial amino acid oxidation is increased, while enzymes
  of the ornithine-urea-cycle (OUC) and connected reactions are throttled, putatively
  leading to accumulation of OUC intermediates as well as polyamines and proline.
  The oxidation of proline to pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) by proline oxidase (ProO)
  also appears to be a major entryway for reductants into Q when N is scarce, and
  a gateway to feed stored N into the metabolism. Especially the diploid stage induces
  machinery to scavenge external (in)organic nitrogenous compounds (blue shade).'
