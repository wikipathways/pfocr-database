caption: The transmethylation pathway is the critical supplier of methyl groups to
  the cell. Under normal conditions, most of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) generated
  is used in transmethylation reactions, in which SAM is converted to S-adenosyl homocysteine
  (SAH) by transferring the methyl group to diverse biological acceptors. SAH is then
  converted to homocysteine (HC) and adenosine in a reversible reaction catalyzed
  by SAH hydrolase. The conversion of homocysteine to methionine is an essential reaction
  to conserve methionine (MET), detoxify homocysteine and produce SAM. Ethanol directly
  or indirectly impairs the formation of SAM from MET by methionine adenosyl transferases
  (MAT). Alcohol also impairs the remethylation of HC to MET by both folate-dependent
  methionine synthase (MS) and by betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT).
