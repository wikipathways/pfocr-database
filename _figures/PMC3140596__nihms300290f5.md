caption: Based on our results presented here, and together with results reported previously
  by our group and others, we propose that CXCR4-TCR heterodimer appears to signal
  in T cells in response to SDF-1 via the signal transduction pathway model shown
  in Fig. 5. SDF-1 treatment induces the formation of the CXCR4-TCR heterodimer which
  mediates the activation of Gi proteins and ZAP-70 and this either directly or indirectly
  leads to the activation of several PLCs including both PLC-γ1 and PLC-β3. PLC-γ1
  activity is required to mediate the migration of T cells via a mechanism that does
  not require either LAT (shown here) or SLP-76 and is also independent of PLC-β3.
  In contrast, PLC-β3 activation leads to ERK activation and gene transcription via
  a mechanism that previous results show does require SLP-76 but is independent of
  LAT. In addition to PLC-γ1 and PLC-β3, the CXCR4-TCR heterodimer appears to activate
  a different PLC(s) to participate in regulating CXCR4 endocytosis in response to
  SDF-1.
