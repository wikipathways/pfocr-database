caption: Glucose input was set at 10 mmol/gCDW·h. The numbers in squares represent
  metabolic fluxes of reactions. Grey squares represent the metabolic fluxes for maximum
  biomass formation. Purple squares represent the metabolic fluxes for maximum l-proline
  biosynthesis using the ppc-based C4 anaplerotic pathway. Green squares represent
  the metabolic fluxes for maximum l-proline biosynthesis using the pyc-based C4 anaplerotic
  pathway. Orange squares represent the metabolic fluxes for maximum l-proline biosynthesis
  using the gapN-based G3P oxidation pathway and pyc-based C4 anaplerotic pathway.
  The feedback inhibition of ProB by l-proline is indicated with orange line. Source
  data for in silico simulation are provided in Supplementary Data –.
