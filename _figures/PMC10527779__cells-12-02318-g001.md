caption: Schematic presentation of various biochemical cross-talks and their detrimental
  manifestations (A–I) in the brain provoked by oxidative stress and their implications
  in the progress of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s
  disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Brain is highly vulnerable
  to oxidative stress due to low regenerative capacity, enrichment of polyunsaturated
  fatty acids, high dependency on mitochondria for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation,
  elevated glucose demand, high concentration of metals like ferrous ion (Fe+2), cuprous
  ion (Cu+), zinc ion (Zn+2) and calcium ion (Ca+2), glutamate-induced excitotoxicity,
  high oxygen (O2) consumption, and relatively low antioxidant system. These multiple
  factors initiate various reaction pathways to create redox disbalance called oxidative
  and nitrosative stress in the brain, implicated in various NDDs. (A). The triplet
  unstable O2 undergoes reduction to produce the precursor of all radicals called
  superoxide anion radical (O2•−) via NAD(P)H oxidases (NOXs) pathway, i.e., one-electron
  trans-membrane transfer to (O2) []. (B). Antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD1)
  undergoes dismutation to scavenge (O2•−) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). (C).
  The weakly liganded (Fe+2) and (Cu+) undergo reduction to produce nature’s most
  vulnerable oxidant hydroxyl radical (HO•) through Fenton’s reaction and Haber-Weiss
  reaction. (D). The final 4th electron reduction of H2O2 in the presence of antioxidants,
  like glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), catalase (cat), and peroxiredoxin system (Prx),
  forms water (H2O). (E). Overactivation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)
  produces nitric oxide (NO•) radicals from L-arginine, which create nitrosative stress
  by modification of thiol group (SH) containing proteins. (F). Excessive superoxide
  anion radicals lead to inactivation of nitric oxide production and switch the biology
  to production of highly potent oxidant peroxynitrite anion (ONOO−), which leads
  to the nitrosative stress by (SH) modification of free tyrosine (Tyr) residues to
  form 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NO2Tyr) (G), which act as a versatile biomarker of nitrosative
  stress and NDDs. (H). Highly reactive and mutagenic oxidant (HO•) damages the nucleic
  acid deoxyribonucleic acid/ribonucleic acid (DNA/RNA) to form oxidative products
  8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine(8-OHdG) and (8-OxoG), and acts as a universal biomarker
  for oxidative stress and NDDs (important to note that guanine is the most oxidation
  prone nucleobase because of low reduction potential []). Further, HO• radical causes
  lipid peroxidation of lipid-rich neuronal membranes, resulting in the death of neurons.
  Lipid peroxides (ROO.) act as a biomarker of oxidative stress and NDDs. Created
