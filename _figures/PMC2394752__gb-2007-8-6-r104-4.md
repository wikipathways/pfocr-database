caption: Contextual organization of the NFκB positive modulators. Organization was
  determined on the basis of follow-up screens with a series of dominant-negative
  mutants (TRAF2, MAP3K7, IKBKB, and IKBKG). If activation of the NFκB reporter was
  blocked by the dominant-negative mutant (≥ 70% average reduction), the positive
  modulator was considered upstream of the dominant-negative mutant. In the boxes
  upstream of TRAF2 and MAP3K7, green text identifies genes that were inhibited by
  both the TRAF2 and MAP3K7 dominant-negative mutants. In the boxes upstream of MAP3K7
  and the IKK complex, red text identifies genes that were inhibited only by the IKBKB
  mutant. Genes identified as IKBKB specific showed ≥ 70% inhibition by the IKBKB
  dominant-negative mutant and <70% inhibition by the IKBKG dominant-negative mutant.
  In addition, IKBKB-specific genes were required to show a fivefold greater reduction
  in NFκB activation by the IKBKB dominant-negative mutant as compared with the IKBKG
  mutant. Those genes that were inhibited by both the IKBKB and IKBKG dominant-negative
  mutants were shown in black text. Genes that were not significantly inhibited by
  any of the dominant-negative mutants are listed in the lower right-hand box and
  were presumed to act downstream in the pathway or through an independent branch.
