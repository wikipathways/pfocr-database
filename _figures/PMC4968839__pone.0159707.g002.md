caption: Paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq, FastQC was used
  to assess sequencing quality, reads were aligned to the bovine genome with Spliced
  Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR), counts were assigned to genes with
  HTseq-count, Edge-R was used to calculate differential gene expression, Kyoto encyclopaedia
  of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway and gene ontology analysis were performed in
  GoSeq, functional annotation clustering and gene functional analysis was performed
  with Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), biological
  functional analysis was performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) downstream
  effects.
