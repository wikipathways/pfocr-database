caption: 'Cholesterol (Ch) enters adrenal cells through 2 routes that each delivers
  cholesterol to StAR for steroid synthesis: the LDL/endosome transfer pathway and
  the HDL/SR-B1/lipid droplet transfer pathway. Cholesterol leaves the cell by transfer
  from lipid droplets to caveolin (Cav) and then to the ABCA1 pump. LXR stimulates
  this pathway by increasing the level of ABCA1. Lipid droplets are very extensive
  in adrenal cells and comprise 95% cholesterol esters (ChE) due to high acyl-CoA:cholesterol
  acyltransferase (ACAT) activity. Cholesterol is transferred to StAR after activation
  of HSL, which hydrolyzes ChE to free cholesterol. The endosome transfer of cholesterol
  to StAR is mediated by the Nieman-Pick type C (NPC) transporter and the StAR-like
  protein MLN64. StAR mediates transfer of Ch to CYP11A1 inside the mitochondria,
  which initiates all steroidogenesis. In adrenals, 3β-DH generates progesterone and
  the activity of 3 cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP11B1, CYP21, and CYP17) generates
  cortisol. LXR produces transcriptional changes by combining with RXR in the nucleus.
  Gene activation is shown as dashed lines. Some effects are mediated by the large
  increase in a second transcription factor, SREBP-1c, which is stored as an inactive
  precursor in the ER. StAR is a gene that is activated by both activated SREBP-1c
  and LXR. LXR-stimulated genes and pathways are highlighted in red. Other cholesterol
  transfer pathways are shown in blue. For further details, see ref. 3. LDL-R, LDL
  receptor.'
