  by the CRISPRi system

caption: a Schematic of the metabolic or regulatory pathways related to FFA biosynthesis
  in E. coli BL21(DE3), which were classified into five modules, namely, upstream
  carbon flux diversion, downstream carbon flux diversion, amino acid metabolism,
  beta-oxidation, and transcription factor, represented in blue, orange, purple, green,
  and golden backgrounds, respectively. The 108 candidate genes in the above five
  modules are marked with blue, orange, purple, green, and golden dots, respectively
  (see Supplementary Data ). 2854 represents the gene numbered ECD_02854 in BL21(DE3).
  The fatty acid biosynthetic pathway is shown as a red line, from glycerol to acyl-ACP
  and conversion to FFAs by TesA′ (encoded by the tesA′gene marked with a red dot).
  The key metabolites glycerone-P, glyceraldehyde-3P, glycerate-3P, pyruvate, acetyl-CoA,
  and malonyl-ACP are represented as numbers 1 to 6, respectively. b Plasmid constructs
  for the expression of tesA′, dCas9 and the sgRNAs geneH/M/L−. CmR, chloramphenicol-resistance
  gene; AmpR, ampicillin-resistance gene; P15A and ColE1, replication origin.
