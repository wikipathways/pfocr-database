caption: Molecular circuit model of the synaptic signaling network. Solid lines indicate
  that direct interactions are known or likely, while dashed lines and/or large gaps
  between line endpoints and downstream effectors indicate poorly understood interactions
  or missing components. Proteins that promote locomotion or neurotransmitter release
  are green, while proteins that inhibit locomotion or neurotransmitter release are
  red. The core pathway of the network is the EGL-30 (Gαq) synaptic vesicle priming
  pathway described in . The network also includes another G protein, GOA-1 (Gαo),
  that negatively regulates the EGL-30 (Gαq) pathway by one or more unknown mechanisms,
  a DAG kinase that antagonizes the EGL-30 pathway, and two RGS proteins that negatively
  regulate each G protein. Results presented in the current study suggest that the
  neuronal Gαq and Gαs pathways converge downstream of DAG production, possibly at
  or near the synaptic vesicle priming mechanism. Even though the neuronal Gαspathway
  is functionally distinct from the Gαqpathway and appears to not be required for
  synaptic vesicle priming, it is largely dependent on the Gαq synaptic vesicle priming
  pathway to exert its effects in producing locomotion. Further linking the Gαq and
  Gαs pathways, the Gα guanine nucleotide exchange factor RIC-8 (synembryn) appears
  essential to maintain both pathways in a functional state (this study) and could,
  we hypothesize, possibly function to maintain extended coactivation of the Gαq and
  Gαs pathways at optimal synapses for locomotion. Other studies, in addition to this
  study, have contributed to this model (; ; ; ; ; ; ; , ; ; , ; ; ; ; ; ; ).
