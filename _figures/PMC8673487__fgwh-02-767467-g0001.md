caption: 'Prolactin-induced signaling pathways in neurons. Transcriptional pathway:
  binding of prolactin to the prolactin receptor (Prlr) results in activation of JAK2
  which in turn phosphorylates several tyroside residues on the Prlr. This causes
  binding and phosphorylation of STAT5 which then dissociates from the receptor. Two
  pSTAT5 molecules dimerise and translocate to the nucleus where they lead to changes
  in gene expression by binging to the promoters of target genes. To induce changes
  in electrical activity, prolactin activates a low voltage and a high voltage current.
  The low voltage component is dependent on TRP channels. The high voltage component
  requires BK-type K+ and L-type Ca2+ channels and is dependent on activation of PI3K,
  however the precise mechanism is unknown. It should be noted that although possible
  pathways of prolactin-induced signaling are illustrated here, prolactin preferentially
  acts through the different pathways in a cell-specific and reproductive-state specific
  manner.'
