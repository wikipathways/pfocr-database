caption: A representation of the canonical HH signaling in the presence and absence
  of a HH ligand. (A) With the ligands absent, PTCH prevents SMO from translocating
  to the primary cilium. In the absence of SMO, the full-length forms of GLI2 and
  GLI3 are phosphorylated by PKA, and then processed into their repressor forms, which
  inhibit downstream transcription. (B) When ligands are present, they are bound by
  PTCH and both are internalized and degraded. This allows the translocation of SMO
  to the tip of the primary cilium, where it processes the full-length forms of the
  GLI proteins into their activator forms, which then promote transcription of downstream
  targets in the nucleus. Created in BioRender.
