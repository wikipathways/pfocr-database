caption: A model for the activation of the UPR in the absence of H6PD.  1, H6PD deletion
  disrupts the redox balance of the ER, resulting in  unfolded protein accumulation
  and activation of the PERK, ATF6, and IRE1  pathways. 2, a PERK-induced translational
  block of transcripts  without an internal ribosome entry site decreases secretory
  protein flow  through the ER, and if rescue mechanisms are unsuccessful, induces
  the  expression of pro-apoptotic genes. 3, ATF6 induced expression of ER  resident
  chaperones speeds up protein folding. 4, IRE1 induced  splicing and activation of
  XBP1 up-regulates both ER-associated protein  degradation (ERAD) and phospholipid
  metabolism involved in ER  membrane biogenesis. 5, the dysregulation of proteins
  involved in  calcium metabolism increases intracellular calcium which activates
  the  calcineurin pathway. Dashed lines indicate presumed interactions.  Small arrows
  denote up- or down-regulation of gene expression.  GRP94, glucose-regulated protein
  94 (HSP90B1); BiP,  immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (GRP78, HSPA5)  CHOP10-C/EBP-homologous
  protein (DDIT3); CALR, calreticulin;  Derlin, Der1p-like protein; Hsp40, heat shock
  protein 40;  IRE1, inositol-requiring enzyme 1; IRES, internal ribosome  entry site;

  coactivator-1 α;  XBP1, X-box-binding protein 1; sXBP1, spliced  XBP1.
