caption: General overview of the Nrf2 pathway. Major molecules and events modulating
  Nrf2 stability and activation, as well as main downstream protein targets and their
  functions are shown. (A) Nrf2 structure is composed by domains (i.e., Neh2 and Neh6)
  that, after redox or signaling regulation, affect Nrf2 stability. Under homeostatic
  conditions, Keap1 binds to Nrf2, directing this transcription factor to ubiquitination
  and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Keap1 is a redox sensor that, upon
  oxidative thiol modification, loses its capability to repress Nrf2. Glycogen synthase
  kinase 3 (GSK-3)-mediated phosphorylation of Nrf2 represents an alternative mechanism,
  facilitating its ubiquitination and consequent degradation by the proteasome. (B)
  Under stress conditions (excessive accumulation of ROS, electrophilic molecules
  and proteotoxic stress), Nrf2-Keap1 interaction is disrupted and Nrf2 translocates
  into the nucleus, wherein it heterodimerizes with small Maf proteins (sMaf) and
  binds to an enhancer sequence termed ARE that is present in the regulatory regions
  of over 250 genes (ARE genes). (C) These ARE genes, whose encoded proteins participate
  in diverse cellular/metabolic events, display significant roles in counteracting
  imbalances in proteostasis, redox and inflammatory control. For a detailed review
  on the mechanisms mediating Nrf2 stability and activation, see []. CALCOCO2, calcium
  binding and coiled-coil domain 2; CD36, CD36 scavenger receptor; GPx, glutathione
  peroxidase; Gpx8, glutathione peroxidase 8; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; IL 17D, interleukin-17D;

  thioredoxin reductase; ULK1, unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1.
