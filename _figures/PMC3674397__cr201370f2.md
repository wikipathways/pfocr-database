caption: Mechanisms of activity for sirtuins in Alzheimer's disease. In vitro and
  neuronal culture data show that SIRT1 can directly deacetylate tau protein at multiple
  residues,,. The mechanism proposed by these investigators is that removal of acetyl
  groups may expose lysine residues to ubiquitin ligases so that tau protein is marked
  for proteasomal degradation,. This process decreases accumulation of hyperphosphorylated
  PHF tau, cognitive defects and early mortality in the P301L tau mouse model,. Overexpression
  of SIRT1 has also been shown to decrease plaque burden and improve behavioral phenotypes
  by deacetylating retinoic acid receptor β, a transcriptional activator of ADAM10.
  ADAM10 is a component of the α-secretase, which processes APP along an anti-amyloidogenic
  pathway that decreases formation of toxic Aβ42 species. An independent study has
  also shown that SIRT1 expression may decrease levels of ROCK1, a serine/threonine
  Rho kinase previously shown to regulate Aβ metabolism, and this effect also promotes
  the non-amyloidogenic α-secretase pathway,. The SIRT1 agonist resveratrol was also
  found to enhance proteasome-mediated clearance of Aβ and reduce the plaque burden
  in the brains of transgenic mice overexpressing APP,. Experiments using mixed cortical
  culture models have also shown that SIRT1 acts to reduce Aβ-stimulated NF-κB signaling
  in microglia.
