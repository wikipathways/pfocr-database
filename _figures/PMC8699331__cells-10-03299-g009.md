caption: Schematic representation of the anti-inflammatory effect related signal transduction
  pathway in Bta-miR-24-3pon LPS-triggered bovine endometrial epithelial cells. This
  picture shows the induction of the cell with LPS to trigger an inflammatory response,
  which elevated the LGALS9 gene expression, and this gene expression was downregulated
  by Bta-miR-24-3p mimic. Likewise, knockdown of LGALS9 (si-LGALS9) leads to suppression
  of inflammatory response.
