caption: 'The role of kinin receptors in breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and
  tumor growth in vivo. This figure illustrates the proposed mechanism by which B1
  and B2 receptor activation leads to enhanced cell motility and invasiveness, while
  receptor antagonism hinders tumor progression: (a) activation of B1 and B2 receptors
  by LDBK and BK induces migration and invasion in breast cancer cells through the
  FAK–Src signaling pathway; and (b) in vivo antagonism of both B1 and B2 receptors
  impairs breast tumor growth, highlighting the therapeutic potential of receptor
  blockade in breast cancer treatment'
