caption: A model in PCs for PIN1 polarization to the lobe regions of PCs via a ROP
  signaling mechanism.ROP2 is activated by extracellular auxin in the lobe region.
  The activated ROP2–RIC4 pathway leads to the inhibition of PIN1 internalization
  through RIC4-dependent cortical F-actin, leading to PIN1 polarization at the lobe.
  The PIN1-based export of auxin leads to further ROP2 activation for completion of
  this feed-forward cycle. Recent data () indicates that the activated ROP2–RIC4 pathway
  has a role in the promotion of endosomal trafficking from early endosomes to recycling
  endosomes (Brefeldin A inhibits ADP ribosylation factor GEF and prevents endosomal
  recycling, the accumulation of internalized PIN1 in aggregates known as BFA bodies
  in plant cells). Endocytosed material can then be recycled back to the PM. Material
  maintained in early endosomes as they mature becomes internalized in late endosomes.
  The multivesicular structure of the late endosomes allows membrane fusion with the
  vacuole. Proteins within the late endosomes are delivered to the vacuole for degradation.
