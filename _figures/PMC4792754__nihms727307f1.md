caption: 'Modeling the DG-CA3 network. A1. The structure of the rodent DG is shown.
  There are three divisions of the molecular layer (MOL; outer, middle and inner),
  a granule cell layer (GCL) and hilus. The dotted line distinguishes the hilus from
  area CA3. In CA3 there are several layers: stratum oriens (SO), stratum pyramidale
  (SP), stratum lucidum (SL) where the mossy fiber pathway is located, stratum radiatum
  (SR) where the recurrent collaterals of pyramidal cells terminate, and stratum lacunosum-moleculare
  (SLM) where the entorhinal cortical projection (perforant path) innervates CA3 pyramidal
  cell distal dendrites. A2. Simplified schematic of some major pathways and cell
  types in the DG-CA3 model are shown. PP= perforant path. IN=interneuron. There are
  two types of IN shown in the DG, a perisomatic-targeting cell exemplified by the
  ‘basket’ cell with a pyramidal morphology (triangle) and a dendritic-targeting cell
  represented by the HIPP cell (oval; HIPP= hilar cell with an axon targeting the
  layer containing the p erforant path terminals). INs are also located in CA3 (oval).
  Note that the mossy fibers have both giant boutons as well as filamentous extensions
  that make synapses, primarily onto IN. MC=mossy cell. PYR= pyramidal cell. GC=granule
  cell. From (). B. The DG-CA3 network model. Abbreviations as in part A. βHIPP, βMC
  and βIN are constants governing connection strengths in the model. For additional
  details, see (; ).'
