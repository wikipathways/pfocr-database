caption: Molecular mechanism of the shade-induced elongation growth in Arabidopsis
  thaliana. Low R:FR enhances the functions of PIF4/5/7 by inhibiting the activity
  of phyB under shaded conditions. During the early shade response, low R:FR signal
  activates PIF4/5/7, thus promoting auxin biosynthesis in the cotyledon, which is
  then transported out to the hypocotyl where it induces cell elongation. Under prolonged
  shade conditions, PIF4/5/7 modulate IAA signaling pathway to increase auxin sensitivity.
  The binding of DELLA and PIF proteins simultaneously results in PIF inactivation.
  ATHB2, ATHB4, REV, HFR1, and PARs are positively regulated by PIFs. HFR1 and PARs
  bind to PIFs to form non-functional complexes to inhibit the SAS by means of a negative
  feedback loop. PIFs inhibit the expression of miR156 to mediate shade-avoidance
  response (SAS). UVR8 and central clock components PRR proteins negatively regulate
  SAS through triggering PIF degradation and repressing transcriptional activity of
  PIF proteins, respectively. Under a shade condition, stable and accumulated TCP17
  protein positively regulate SAS via activating PIF4 and PIF5. Low blue light levels
  depressed CRY1 activity and also increase the abundance of PIF4 and PIF5 to trigger
  hypocotyl elongation with no alteration in detectable auxin amounts or sensitivity.
  Arrows indicate positive regulation; blunt arrows indicate negative regulation.
  Pfr, Far-Red light absorbing, biologically active form of phytochrome. Pfr to Pr
  conversion is optimized by far-red light wavelengths (725–735 nm). Pr, Red-light
  absorbing, biologically inactive form of phytochrome. Pr to Pfr conversion is optimized
  by red wavelengths (660–670 nm).
