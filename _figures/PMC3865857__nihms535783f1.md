caption: Conversion of ω6 and ω3 series PUFA by metabolic enzymes and interaction
  with de novo fatty acid synthesis. The main dietary ω6 and ω3 PUFA (LA, 18:2 n-6
  and αLNA, 18:3 n-3) undergo a series of desaturation (FADS2, FADS1) and elongation
  (ELOVL5, KAR, HACD, TECR) steps converting them to AA and EPA, respectively. The
  in vitro conversion rates of these enzymatic steps are indicated as percent of product
  formed from 150 nmol substrate incubated with 5 mg of rat liver microsomal protein
  for 3 min []. Long-chain PUFA are converted to prostaglandins (PG) and thromboxanes
  (TX) by cyclooxygenases (COX1–2) or to leukotrienes (LT) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acids (HETE) by lipoxygenases (LOX). EPA can be further elongated and desaturated
  to DHA in a pathway involving β-oxidation in the peroxisome. In the presence of
  aspirin, COX2 metabolizes EPA and DHA to resolvins. The various products play important
  roles in inflammation, cell proliferation and apoptosis, and angiogenesis. In the
  de novo lipid synthesis pathway, acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA can be interconverted
  by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1) and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MLYCD). Acetyl-CoA
  and malonyl-CoA are used as substrates by fatty acid synthase (FASN) to generate
  long-chain saturated fatty acids, which can be elongated further (ELOVL6) or desaturated
  (SCD) to form monounsaturated fatty acids. Malonyl-CoA is also required for elongation
  of ω6 and ω3 PUFA
