caption: Ethylene biosynthesis pathway. The amino acid methionine is converted to
  S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) by SAM synthetase (1), which requires ATP. Using SAM
  as a substrate, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) is produced by ACC synthase
  (ACS) (2). This also releases 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA), which is recycled back
  to methionine via the so-called “Yang cycle.” Finally, ACC is oxidized by ACC oxidase
  (ACO) (3) to produce ethylene, CO2 and cyanide (HCN). In addition, ACC can be converted
  to its major conjugate 1-malonyl-ACC (MACC) using malonyl-CoA. It can also react
  with GSH to form γ-glutamyl-ACC (GACC) or with JA to produce jasmonyl-ACC (JA-ACC).
