caption: Schematic diagram of the signaling pathway in which miR-155-5p inhibits the
  EV71 replication. EV71 infection upregulated the expression of miR-155-5p, which
  increased the expression of IRF7 by targeting FOXO3, subsequently promoting type
  I IFN production and ISGs expressions, and thus reducing the EV71 survival.
