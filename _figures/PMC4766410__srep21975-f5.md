caption: In both the mouse and human activation of the CaSR via the calcimimetic NPS
  R-568 leads to an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ through activation of the PI-PLC pathway
  and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. This rise in cytosolic calcium leads
  to an increase in intracellular cAMP level via a Ca2+-stimulated adenylate cyclase
  (AC1), and in turn activation of the cAMP-dependent enzyme protein kinase A (PKA).
  Phosphorylation of the CFTR’s regulatory ‘R’-domain by PKA allows opening of the
  channel and conductance of Cl− ions through the channel. A similar pathway also
  appears to be in place in response to fetal hypercalcemia in the human fetal lung,
  however this is not the case in the mouse where as yet unknown pathway, not involving
  an apical CFTR channel, appears to induce this increase in fluid secretion.
