caption: Inhibition of STAT3 activation pathway by NDRG2. JAK is activated upon cytokine
  or growth factors, resulting in dimerization through phosphorylation and nuclear
  translocation of STAT3 to induce transcription of metastasis-related genes, such
  as ZEB1, TWIST, SNAIL, and VEGF. Cytokine signaling inhibitory factor (SOCS) protein
  is a representative negative regulator on JAK. NDRG2 induces SOCS1 expression through
  an unknown mechanism (dash line) and SOCS1 inhibits STAT3-mediated tumor cell metastasis
  by inhibiting JAK activation.
