caption: Thyroid hormone and estrogen-mediated signaling pathway.Estrogen and TH enhance
  nuclear localization of both THRɑ and ERɑ in breast cancer cells. Thyroid hormones
  facilitate the genomic effect of estrogen through ERa which bind estrogen response
  elements (ERE) []. Thyroid hormone and E2 regulate p53 and pRb(retinoblastoma protein)
  together (Left) []. TH can induce aberrant activation of MAP kinase and the PI3
  kinase signaling pathways by binding ɑvß3 integrin as well. Metastasis and proliferation
  of BC is improved by increased C-myc, which is activated by the MAP kinase pathway
  []. TH could induce the high expression of hypoxia inducing factor 1 (HIF-1) and
  transform growth factor alpha (TGFα) in BC cell lines by activating the PI3K pathway
