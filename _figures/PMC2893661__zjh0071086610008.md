caption: Hypothetical model for AnxA1 disposition in the PMN on CFTR inhibition. These
  schemes illustrate the model that could be put forward, based on the experiments
  presented in this study. In resting PMN, a large proportion (≥50 to 60%) of AnxA1
  is contained intracellularly in gelatinase granules, with the remainder primarily
  found in the cytosol and negligible levels on the cell surface. CFTR is expressed,
  though this is a contentious issue, in the phagolysosome and/or other vesicles.
  Acute inhibition (and malfunctioning?) of CFTR is, in a manner yet to be established,
  associated with ‘leakage’ of the intracellular AnxA1 pool and release of the protein
  in the supernatant, mainly in microparticles. Importantly, this model still needs
  to be corroborated with analyses conducted in PMN obtained from cystic fibrosis
  patients.
