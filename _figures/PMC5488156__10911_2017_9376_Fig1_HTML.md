  acylation steps of glycerol phosphate by glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT)

  catalysed by choline kinase (CK) CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) catalyses
  activation of phosphocholine with cytidine triphosphate (CTP). This activated form
  is transferred to DAG and PC is formed. This reaction is catalysed by cholinephosphotransferase
  (CPT). The remodeling Lands cycle for PC. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) hydrolyses the
  acyl chain from the sn-2 position of a PC and generates a lysophosphatidylcholine

  of LPC with a second fatty acid (in the form of fatty acyl-CoA). Other abbreviations:
