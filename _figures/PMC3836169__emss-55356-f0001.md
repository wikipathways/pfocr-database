caption: Basic components of the PI3K/AKT pathway. PI3K is activated by numerous extracellular
  signals, most notably including insulin and IGF1, which act through their respective
  receptors and its associated proteins IRS1 and IRS1. Activation of PI3K generates
  the second messenger lipid PIP3, which serves as an anchoring site for AKT and its
  ensuing activation. PTEN eliminates PIP3, by converting it into PIP2, thus counteracting
  the activity of PI3K. Among the main actions of AKT are the inhibition of the FOXO
  transcription factors, particularly FOXO1 and FOXO3, and the activation of the mTORC1
  complex. The mTORC1 complex is characterized by the presence of mTOR, RAPTOR and
  mLST8 among other protein subunits. The kinases S6K1 and S6K2 are two of the most
  important downstream effectors of mTORC1.
