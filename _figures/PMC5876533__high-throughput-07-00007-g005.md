caption: 'Exemplary results of the targeted metabolomics analysis of CDF3oe plants
  relative to the wild type. (a) Metabolic network map of major changes due to the
  overexpression of CDF3. According to the obtained data, sucrose metabolism is strongly
  induced in CDF3oe, which goes at the expense of the pentose phosphate pathway. More
  abundant metabolites are shown in cyan, and less abundant metabolites are shown
  in red; (b) representation of relative contents of marker compounds for starch and
  sucrose metabolism (sucrose) and the pentose phosphate pathway (gluconate). CoA:
  Coenzyme A; E: Enzyme-bound metabolites; EutG: Alcohol dehydrogenase (NP_416948);
  ThPP: Thiamine pyrophosphate; P: Phosphate; UDP: Uridine diphosphate.'
