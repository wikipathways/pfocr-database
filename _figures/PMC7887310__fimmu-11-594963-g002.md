caption: Major metabolic pathway along with their inhibitors. 2DG (2-deoxy-D-glucose)
  blocks glycolysis. L-DON (6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine) blocks glutaminolysis by acting
  on glutamate. Etomoxir blocks FAO (fatty acid oxidation) by its inhibitor action
  on CPT1a (carnitine palmitoyltransferase), C75 (fatty acid synthase inhibitor) blocks
  fatty acid synthesis (FAS) by inhibiting a fatty acid synthase enzyme. OAA, oxaloacetic
  acid; alpha KG, alpha-ketoglutarate; G-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle.
