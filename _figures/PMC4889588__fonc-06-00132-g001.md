caption: Schematic depiction of oncogenic MYC signal transduction. The highly simplified
  cartoon shows key pathways operating upstream and downstream of the MYC oncoprotein.
  Mitogenic signal transduction starts with stimulated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
  transmitting signals via guanine nucleotide exchange factors onto the G protein
  RAS. RAS binds and activates the serine/threonine protein kinase RAF(Mil), which
  leads to consecutive phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
  (MAPKK) MEK, the MAP kinase (MAPK) ERK, and of transcription factor complexes, such
  as MYC/MAX or JUN/FOS (AP-1), regulating the expression of numerous target genes.
  Based on the observed synergy between MYC and RAF(Mil), distinct MYC targets may
  enhance RAS/RAF-induced cell transformation via a positive feedback loop. On the
  other hand, MYC could also directly stimulate AP-1 by transcriptional activation
  of JUN or FOS encoding genes. The c-MYC gene is activated at the transcriptional
  level by the wingless/int-1 (WNT) signaling pathway, resulting in nuclear translocation
  of β-catenin (βCTNN) where it binds to T-cell factor (TCF). Several transforming
  MYC targets are involved in cell cycle regulation (Table ), which encode inter alia
  E2F transcription factors, cyclins (CCN), and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), resulting
  in accelerated cell proliferation. Besides the extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (RAS–ERK) pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) signaling is a central mechanism to control cell growth, proliferation, and
  survival in response to extracellular stimuli. The protein kinase AKT phosphorylates
  many survival factors, and mTOR-mediated signaling modulates ribosome biogenesis
  and translation of proteins, such as c-MYC and cyclin D, that promote cell growth
  and proliferation [adapted from Ref. (, , )].
