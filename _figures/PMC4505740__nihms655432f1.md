caption: Molecular targeting of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), PI3K,
  and CDK4 pathways and the associated mutation rates of potential molecular targets
  in advanced melanoma (). Activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase such as c-KIT
  results in the propagation of signal via the MAPK pathway leading to activation
  of RAS, RAF, MEK and ERK. This ultimately results in the gene expression and promotes
  cellular proliferation and survival. Mutated BRAF bypasses this ordered pathway
  and stimulates constitutive signaling, making it a prime target for vemurafenib
  and dabrafenib. Trametinib targets the downstream effector molecule MEK. Dysregulation
  of the PI3K pathway promotes melanoma progression. Small molecule inhibitors of
  the PI3K pathway are being clinically tested in combination with MAPK pathway inhibition.
  Similarly, CDK4 is an attractive candidate molecule to target in melanoma and is
  the focus of multiple clinical trials. Red=activated; gray=inactivated; green=normal
  function. Drugs (shown in boxes) that have been approved (bold), or in trial (non-bold,
  italics), are indicated.
