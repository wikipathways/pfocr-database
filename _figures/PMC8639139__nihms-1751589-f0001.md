caption: Activation of EGFR by its ligands leads to activation of the RAS/ERK pathway
  that drives cellular proliferation. This pathway is believed to be overactivated
  in colorectal cancer. Patients with KRAS WT colon cancers benefit from anti-EGFR
  agents that prevent the activation of EGFR. Patients with constitutively active
  KRAS mutants do not benefit from anti-EGFR agents, as the constitutively active
  RAS mutants can still drive proliferation. The constitutively active KRAS G13D mutation
  is an exception; patients with this mutation have been shown to benefit from anti-EGFR
  agents, although a mechanism to explain why this constitutively active mutation
  behaved differently had been unknown.
