caption: 'The WNT/β-catenin pathway and its different actions in cancer processes.
  The WNT plays a major role in cancer processes by interacting with the STAT3 pathway,
  leading to tumor growth, by stimulating cyclin D1 and c-Myc, responsible for cell
  proliferation and then for the glutaminolysis mechanism responsible for the nucleotide
  synthesis. β-catenin directly activates RTK, which in turn stimulates the PI3K/Akt
  pathway leading to the inactivation of the GSK-3β, a major inhibitor of β-catenin.
  Activated Akt stimulates MMP-2 and MMP-9, which are responsible for the invasiveness.
  The double action of β-catenin and the PI3K/Akt pathway for the activation of the
  HIF-1α enhances the stimulation of the PDK, which in turn inactivates the PDH and
  stops the TCA cycle. The TCA cycle arrest leads to lipid synthesis and protein accumulation
  in cancers. Moreover, LDH-1 is directly responsible for the production of lactate
  and its translocation over the cell by MCT-1, which in turn stimulates angiogenesis.
  Abbreviations: GSK: glycogen synthase kinase, HIF: hypoxic inducible factor, RTK:
  tyrosine kinase receptor, LDH: lactate dehydrogenase, PDK: pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase, TCA: tricarboxylic cycle, MCT: monocarboxylate transporter.'
