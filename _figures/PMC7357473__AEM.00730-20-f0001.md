caption: 'Metabolic pathway of ethanol biosynthesis in C. ljungdahlii. Abbreviations
  used: Pta, pta, phosphotransacetylase; Ack, ack, acetate kinase; AdhE, adhE, aldehyde/alcohol
  dehydrogenase; AOR, aor, acetaldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase; PFOR, pfor, pyruvate:ferredoxin
  oxidoreductase; LdhA, ldhA, lactate dehydrogenase; ALDC, aldc, acetolactate decarboxylase;
  23BDH, bdh, 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase; Fdred, reduced ferredoxin; Fdox, oxidized
  ferredoxin; Nfn, electron-bifurcating and ferredoxin-dependent transhydrognenase;
  Rnf complex, membrane-associated and energy-conserving reduced ferredoxin:NAD+ oxidoreductase.
  The Rnf-ATPase system is a system of two enzyme complexes in which the Rnf complex
  generates a proton gradient across the membrane by the oxidation of Fdred with NAD+.
  The second enzyme complex, the ATPase complex, consumes the proton gradient and
  phosphorylates ADP to ATP in the cytoplasm. AdhE pathway, ethanol formation by AdhE
  catalysis; AOR pathway, AOR participates in acetate and ethanol formation.'
