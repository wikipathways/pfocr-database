caption: A schematic model of HOG – signaling pathway in Hortaea werneckii. Here,
  HwSho1 along with HwMsb2 and HwOpy2 interact with external stimuli (changes in salinity
  and osmolarity) and transmits the signal to HwHog1 (MAPK) mediated pathway through
  HwSte11 (MAPKKK) and HwPbs2 (MAPKK). In H. werneckii, the phosphorelay (HwSln1-HwYpd1-HwSsk1)
  interacts with cytosolic histidine-kinase (Hwhhk7) to transmit the external signal
  to HwSsk2. Signals from both sensors (HwSho1 and HwSln1) converge at HwPsb2, HwPsb2
  activates HwHog1. Activated HwHog1 translocates to the nucleus and interacts with
  osmoresponsive genes and RNA Pol II for adaptation in fluctuating and hyperosmotic
  environments. *May or may not interact, **genes responsible for glycerol production,
  protein synthesis, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism.
