caption: 'Overview of proteostasis pathways. 1. Proteins are synthesized on ribosomes,
  and molecular chaperones aid in synthesis and proper folding. 2. When proteins are
  misfolded and reach the end of their life or there is a disruption in proteostasis,
  two major pathways are responsible for protein degradation: A, the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway and B, the autophagy lysosomal pathway. A variety of stresses can promote
  the formation of misfolded proteins and toxic aggregates. The heat shock response
  (HSR) is regulated by the transcription factor, heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1). Hsf1
  is normally held in an inactive, monomeric state by chaperones such as Hsp70 and
  Hsp90. When misfolded protein species become sufficiently abundant, Hsf1 can no
  longer efficiently compete for binding to chaperones and then undergoes trimerization
  and translocation to the nucleus. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated
  when misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER. The UPR sensors PERK, IRE1, and ATF6
  are normally held in an inactive state by the ER chaperone, Grp78. Misfolded proteins
  titrate Grp78 away from these sensor proteins which are subsequently activated and
  trigger the UPR. ER, endoplasmic reticulum.'
