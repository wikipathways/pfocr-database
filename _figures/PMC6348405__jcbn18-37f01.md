caption: Mitochondria-to-nuclear retrograde signaling pathways in mammals. Mitochondrial
  respiration produces intrinsic ROS, which is eliminated by endogenous antioxidants.
  Various stresses produce deleterious excess ROS and cause mitochondrial dysfunction
  that results in the declined synthesis of ATP and mitochondrial metabolites, loss
  of mitochondrial membrane potential and Ca2+ release, accumulation of unfolded protein
  and further production of ROS. Energetic stress activates AMPK and induces expression
  of PGC1α- and FOXO-regulated genes that are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis
  and mtDNA replication.(,) Increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ stimulates glycolysis and Ca2+
  uptake by activating CaMK and Cn. CaMK activates gene expression by CREB phosphorylation
  and by the activation of the AMPK-regulated pathway, whereas Cn activates NF-κB-
  and NFAT-dependent gene expression. Additionally, mtDNA depletion, mitochondrial
  chaperone inhibition, or mitochondrial protease inhibition induce the expression
  of mitochondrial chaperonins, known as UPRMT, in nematodes, although the molecular
  mechanism is not fully clarified in mammals. ATF4 is activated in response to mitochondrial
  ROS production via PERK and/or GCN2 to upregulate chaperone expression, amino acid
  synthesis and antioxidant synthesis. Increased cytoplasmic ROS activates Nrf2 and
  induces antioxidant gene expression. AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ATF4, activating
  transcription factor 4; CaMK, calmodulin kinase; Cn, calcineurin; CREB, cAMP response
  element-binding protein; FOXO, forkhead box O; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated
  T-cells; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PGC1α, PPARγ coactivator 1α; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species.
