caption: Role of the H2S–NO–HNO–TRPA1–CGRP pathway as a crucial element in migraine
  pathogenesis. The anti-nociceptive effects of H2S also is shown. Endogenous H2S
  is predominantly generated from cysteine and homocysteine via enzymatic pathways,
  including cystathionine γ-lyase (CGL) and cystathionine b-synthase (CBS), as well
  as 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (MPST). NOSs are involved in NO production
  endogenously via its isoforms, such as eNOS. The interaction of H2S and NO results
  in nitroxyl (HNO) formation, which leads to the activation of the TRPA1 channels,
  causing an influx of Ca2+ and release of calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP),
  inducing meningeal blood flow and migraine. TRPA1 affects oxidative stress and neurogenic
  inflammation, causing migraine induction. H2S exerts its neuroprotective effects
  via increasing GSH and targeting nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)–antioxidant
  response element (ARE) signaling pathway to reduce the oxidative stress and neuroinflammation,
  and eventually nociceptive sensitization reduction in migraine
