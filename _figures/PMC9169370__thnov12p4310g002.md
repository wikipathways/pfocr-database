caption: Schematic illustration of the different pyroptosis pathways. (A) In the canonical
  inflammasome pathway, pathogen-associated molecular patterns or damage-associated
  molecular patterns like viruses, bacteria, toxins, ATP, or ROS stimulates inflammasome,
  which then activates caspase-1 to cleave GSDMD for pore formation. (B) LPS from
  Gram-negative bacteria activates caspase-4/5/11 directly, followed by GSDMD cleavage
  to execute pyroptosis in the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. (C) Apoptotic caspases-mediated
  pyroptosis pathway can be engaged through mechanisms such as caspase-3/GSDME, caspase-8/GSDMC,
  caspase-6/GSDMB, and so on. (D) In the granzymes-mediated pathway, GZMA or GZMB
  derived from cytotoxic lymphocytes can cleave GSDMB or GSDME respectively for pore
  formation and pyroptosis.
