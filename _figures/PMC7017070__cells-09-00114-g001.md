caption: MiRNA processing pathway. Long primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNA) are
  processed in the nucleus by Drosha and DGCR8 [,,,]. The pre-miRNA is transferred
  into the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 (XPO5) and further processed by Dicer and TRBP
  [,]. The resulting miRNA duplex is loaded onto AGO at which point one strand is
  degraded [,]. The remaining mature miRNA strand forms the “RNA induced silencing
  complex” (RISC) together with AGO and GW182 [,]. The main function of the RISC is
  the translational repression of complementary target mRNAs [].
