caption: Acrolein-activated MMP9 leads to persistent increase in mucin 5, subtypes
  A and C (MUC5AC) production. (A) Acrolein increased the cleavage of pro-MMP9 leading
  to its activation. (B) Once activated, MMP9 can cleave cell surface bound pro-EGFR
  ligands. (C) EGFR ligands bind to and activate EGFR and the downstream MAPK signaling
  pathway. Subsequently (D) MMP9 transcripts and (E) pro-MMP9 protein increased. This
  also leads to an increase in MUC5AC transcripts. (F) Acrolein increased the release
  of pro-MMP9, which then can be activated once again by acrolein (A). Thus chronic
  exposure to acrolein initiates an feedback loop that is mediated by MMP9, leading
  to persistent mucin production.
