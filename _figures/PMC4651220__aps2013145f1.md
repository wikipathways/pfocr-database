caption: Scheme of the metabolic pathway of monocrotaline (MCT). MCT is mainly metabolized
  in three pathways. The detoxification pathways include hydrolysis by carboxylesterase
  to form retronecine and N-oxidation by FMO and CYP450s to form monocrotaline N-oxide
  (MNO). The metabolic activation of MCT occurs via dehydrogenation primarily, by
  CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, to form dehydromonocrotaline (DHM), which is highly active. It
  can react with water to form DHP and conjugate with nucleophiles to form adducts
  such as GSH-DHP, diGSH-DHP, and bound pyrroles.
