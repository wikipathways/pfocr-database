caption: A cascade of events after SARS-CoV-2 infection starts with a few days time
  lag in which the virus replicates using a set of open frame genes in airway epithelial
  cells (). Then pneumocytes are invaded and huge amount of DAMPS are released ().
  After that innate immunity receptors recognize viral RNA and proinflammatory cytokines
  are produced using the NFkappaB signaling pathway. Pyroptosis is seen and proinflammatory
  cytokines build up an inflammatory response (). Then macrophages, monocytes and
  polymorphonuclear leukocyte are recruited and activated in the inflammatory environment
  and the next wave of cytokines surges. In severe COVID-19 cases as a result of emergency
  myelopoiesis dysfunctional mature neutrophils and HLADRlow monocytes appear in the
  blood (). In this complex situation the endothelial cell infection outcome contributes
  additionally to the inflammatory response. Endothelial damage leading to thrombolytic
  microangiopathy causes hypoxemia and malnutrition (). The mTOR pathway is activated,
  which ends up with NFkappaB and massive cytokine release (). Created in Biorender.com.
