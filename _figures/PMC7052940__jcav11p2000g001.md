caption: Mechanism of FGF/FGFR signaling pathway involved in resistance to oncotherapy.
  (A) Gene amplification translates into FGFR overexpression, causing receptor accumulation
  and continuously activation of the down-stream signaling pathways, including ligands-dependent
  and independent pathways. (B) Increased FGF from tumor cell or microenvironment
  can overstimulate FGFR and its down-stream signaling pathways. (C) FGF/FGFR signalling
  may contribute to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). (D) FGF/FGFR signalling
  can promote angiogenesis and further induce resistance to antiangiotherapy. (E)
  Nuclear translocation of FGF or FGFR can accelerate DNA repairor regulate gene transcription.
  (F) Downregulation of negative regulated proteins, such as SPRY, can maintain the
  activation of FGF/FGFR signalling. (G) Activation of other survival signalling.
  FGF can regulate the expression of Bcl-xL and IXP via a protein complex containing
  S6K2, PKCɛand B-Raf. FGF can promote the demethylation of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase
  (MGMT) promoter. FGF can upregulate the expression of EGFR via an intermediate protein
  YAP1.
