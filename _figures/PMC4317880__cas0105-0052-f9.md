caption: Convergence of signaling molecules in the vicinity of membranes and synergistic
  enhancement of the signaling and phenotypes in ganglioside GD3+ N1 cells. (A) Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH
  kinase (PI3K)–Akt exists downstream of the collagen type I (CL-I)/integrin-mediated
  signaling and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/Met-mediated signaling pathway. After
  adhesion of cells to CL-I, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is phosphorylated (P), leading
  to activation of PI3K and subsequent Akt phosphorylation. After binding of hepatocyte
  growth factor (HGF), Met is phosphorylated and growth factor receptor bound protein-1
  (Grb-1) can bind to phosphorylated Met, then PI3K is activated resulting in Akt
  phosphorylation. (B) Ras-Erks exist downstream of the CL-I/integrin-mediated signaling
  pathway. After adhesion of cells to CL-I, FAK is phosphorylated and an Src family
  kinase, Yes, binds phosphorylated FAK, then sequential activation of the signaling
  pathway takes place. After binding of HGF, Met is phosphorylated and Grb2–Sos can
  bind to phosphorylated Met, resulting in the activation of Ras, then of Erks. CL
  type I, collagen type I; PI(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; PI(4)P,
  phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate.
