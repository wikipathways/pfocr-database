caption: 'Mechanisms of the anti-atherosclerotic effects of ginsenoside Rg1.Ginsenoside
  Rg1 (Rg1) exerts multiple protective effects against atherosclerosis by targeting
  key cellular components involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. A. Endothelial
  cells (ECs): Rg1 enhances endothelial function by reducing oxidative stress, promoting
  the dissociation of the Keap1/Nrf2 complex, and facilitating nuclear translocation
  of Nrf2. This activation leads to the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes such as
  SOD and GSH, and increased NO production while reducing ROS and MDA levels. Rg1
  also stimulates NO release by increasing ETB receptor expression, facilitating L-arginine
  transport, and enhancing eNOS phosphorylation. Additionally, Rg1 suppresses the
  expression of adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, thereby reducing monocyte
  adhesion and clustering. B. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs): Rg1 inhibits SMC proliferation
  by modulating the expression of genes through the ERK, PI3K, and PKC pathways, thereby
  exerting an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and preventing neointimal hyperplasia.Abbreviations:
