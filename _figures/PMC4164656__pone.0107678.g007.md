caption: These two processes are strongly regulated by reciprocal interaction between
  ROS and auxin signaling pathway. NaCl-mediated stress would conduct to miR393 induction
  that targets TIR1-AFB2 auxin receptors leading to stabilization of Aux/IAA repressors
  and down- regulation of auxin signaling pathway. In turn, auxin modulation influences
  on ROS-associated metabolism. Salt exposition leading to SIMR would be under negative
  regulation of the auxin signaling pathway. Depending on time and intensity of salt
  stress, early ROS-auxin crosstalk may exert impact on SIMR and tolerance to salinity.
  Others hormones and/or miRNAs may also regulate auxin-dependent pathway and physiological
  responses during acclimation to salinity.
