caption: (a) Wee1 inactivates Cdk1 by phosphorylation at tyrosine 15. Non-phosphorylated
  Cdk1 forms a complex with Cyclin B1 and induces mitosis. Non-phosphorylated Cdk1
  degrades the ribonucleotide reductase subunit Rrm2. This leads to dNTP starvation
  and DNA replication stress. H3K36me3 acts as an antagonist promoting Rrm2 transcription.
  MK-1775, as a Wee1-kinase inhibitor, leads to high Cdk1 activity and uncontrolled
  G2/M transition. Furthermore, MK-1775 leads to DNA replication stress and to S-phase
  arrest or apoptosis,. p53 protects the cell against DNA replication stress and is
  a potential inhibitor of Cdk1. Gemcitabine inhibits DNA synthesis as a nucleoside
  analog of cytidine.
