caption: 'Biogenesis and secretion of exosomes. Schematic representation of exosome
  formation and release in the extracellular space. (1) Exosomes are produced as ILVs
  by inward budding of the endosomal membrane and accumulate in the lumen of the endosome.
  (2) Several mechanisms are involved in the biogenesis of exosomes such as ESCRT
  protein-, lipid-raft- and tetraspanin microdomain-dependent pathways. Whether one
  or multiple pathways are required simultaneously by one population of MVBs, or if
  each pathway is specific to one population of MVB, is still not clear. ESCRT-dependent
  pathways: (A) the most described mechanism involved in the biogenesis of exosomes
  is the ESCRT-dependent pathway requiring proteins of the ESCRT family. Specific
  transmembrane ubiquitinated cargo is recruited and clustered at the MVB membrane
  by the ESCRT-0 complex, subsequently binding to the ESCRT-I structure. The ESCRT-II
  complex is activated and together with ESCRT-I will create and/or stabilize the
  vesicle neck. Finally, ESCRT-III and its associated proteins will drive neck constriction.
  (B) The second ESCRT-dependent biogenesis pathway is the syntenin/ALIX pathway.
  The formation of syndecan-enriched microdomains leads to syndecan cleavage and the
  formation of syntenin/syndecan complexes that interact with ALIX. The syntenin–syndecan–ALIX
  complex then favours the recruitment of the ESCRT-III complex to support the MVB
  membrane curvature and abscission. ESCRT-independent pathways: (C) Ceramide- and
  phosphatidic acid-dependent pathways are based on the formation of lipid-rafts where
  sphingomyelin is converted to ceramide or phosphatidylcholine is converted to phosphatidic
  acid. The ceramide- and phosphatidic acid-enriched rafts induce the inward curvature
  of the MVB membrane. (D) Similarly, tetraspanin-enriched microdomains can induce
  a negative curvature in the MVB membrane. (3) MVBs will either fuse with lysosomes
  for degradation or with the plasma membrane, which will consequently release exosomes
  into the extracellular space (4). Several proteins have been identified in the transport
  and fusion of the MVB to the plasma membrane, such as proteins from the Rab protein
  family and SNARE complexes.'
