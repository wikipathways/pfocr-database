caption: The roles of zinc transporters in B cells of different stages. In the developmental
  stages of early B cells, STAT5 activation in the BCR signaling pathway triggered
  by cytokines like IL-7 upregulates SLC39A10, which subsequently increases the cytoplasmic
  zinc levels. As an inhibitor of effort caspases such as caspase 3 and caspase 9,,
  zinc may regulate the early B cell survival, which is consistent with the phenomenon
  that SLC39A10 deficiency leads to a reduced population of both pro- and pre-B-cell,
  accompanied with reduced intracellular zinc concentrations. In mature B cells, SLC39A10
  acts as a positive regulator of CD45R, which has inhibitory effect on the Lyn by
  dephosphorylating regulatory tyrosine residues of the Lyn in a dynamic behavior.
  In the pre- and immature-B cells, SLC39A7 deficiency is associated with reduced
  cytoplasm zinc level. Since zinc is a negative regulator of phosphatases, their
  activity is elevated in SLC39A7-deficient B cells, which inhibits kinase activity
  and consequently leads to impaired BCR-dependent signaling. This impairment finally
  leads to reduced numbers of pre-, immature, and mature B cells, with a developmental
  block in pre-B stage. STAT5, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5;
  BCR, B cell receptor; IL-7, interleukin 7; CD45R, a receptor-type protein tyrosine
  phosphatase; Lyn, tyrosine-protein kinase.
