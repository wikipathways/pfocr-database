caption: A PIM1 signaling in Hepatocellular carcinoma. PIM1 enhances AKT-driven glycolysis
  by phosphorylating AKT at S473, leading to the activation of its downstream targets.
  This process generates energy and supports the growth and advancement of HCC in
  the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. PIM1 phosphorylates RBMY, resulting in its cytoplasmic
  accumulation and activation of oncogenic functions. Upon phosphorylation PIM1 collaborates
  with nuclear RBMY to facilitate the transcription of Snail1 and ZEB1, and with cytoplasmic
  RBMY to induce the nuclear translocation of Snail1. These dual pathways synergistically
  boost the transcription of ZEB1 and vimentin leading to EMT and metastasis. The
  interaction of PIM1 with RBMY causes a reciprocal stabilization and substantial
  translocation of RBMY from the nuclei to the mitochondria. This PIM1-RBMY interaction
  prompts a shift towards mitochondrial fission, resulting in elevated ATP and ROS
  production for mitochondrial movement, acting as a mechanism to drive tumor metastasis.
  B Molecular mechanisms of PIM1 regulation in pancreatic Cancer. Under hypoxic conditions
  the cis-acting AU-rich elements present within a 38-base pair region of the PIM1
  mRNA 3’-untranslated region mediate a regulatory interaction with the mRNA stability
  factor HuR. HuR, primarily expressed in the nucleus of PDAC cells, relocates to
  the cytoplasm in response to hypoxic stress, resulting in the stabilization and
  overexpression of PIM1 protein leading to enhance cell survival, DNA repair and
  development of chemoresistance. IL-6 stimulation triggers autophosphorylation of
  JAK and subsequently activates STAT3 protein. Phosphorylated STAT3, upon binding
  to activated JAK proteins, forms dimers that then translocate to the nucleus to
  control the transcription of crucial genes responsible for cell proliferation and
  cell cycle advancement. Green circles show activating phosphorylation events. Green
  and red arrows represent activating and inactivating pathways, respectively
