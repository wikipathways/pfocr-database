caption: Response of the proteasome-chaperone network differs between the brain and
  periphery. (A) Rapamycin treatment may stimulate AKT in the brain, increasing proteasome-related
  chaperones through rp-S6 top-dependent translation and a non-cannonical stress response
  pathway (red-dashed arrows) ultimately increasing proteasome activity in the female
  brain. (B) In contrast, visceral fat shows a suppression of the mTOR network, reduction
  of the HSF1 chaperone response, and a decrease in proteasome activity.
