caption: 'A: VEGF signaling in the vascular system: The PI3K-Akt pathway is shown
  in red: VEGF binding to VEGFR2 causes autophosphorylation of the receptor. Phosphorylation
  of the receptor at tyrosine 1175 causes the recruitment of the adaptor protein Shb,
  which then activates PI3K. PI3K phosphorylates Akt, which acts through substrates
  like the actin binding protein Girdin to regulate endothelial cell migration. The
  Rac1 pathway is shown in green: PI3K also activates Rac1, which regulates migration
  through the effectors WAVE2 and the actin binding protein Profilin. Phosphorylation
  of Tyr1175 also causes activation of PLCγ, which activates the small GTPases Rac1
  and RhoA to regulate endothelial cell migration. B: VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling in the
  nervous system: Many of the same proteins used by VEGFR2 signaling in the vascular
  system are also implicated to act in the nervous system, but the evidence for this
  is less clear (indicated by question marks). PI3K inhibitors abrogate VEGFs neuroprotective
  effect, while PLC and PKC inhibitors prevented the neurotrophic effect exerted by
  VEGF on cortical neurons.'
