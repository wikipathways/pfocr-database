caption: 'Schemata of mechanisms underlying the prevention of diabetes development
  by inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). Hypertension (HTN) and cardiovascular
  (CV) risk factors are commonly associated with activation of the RAS. Activation
  of angiotensin II produces the following biological effects: 1) inhibition of insulin
  activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway; 2) inhibition
  of pre-adipocyte differentiation into mature adipocytes, leading to reduction in
  secretion of adiponectin and increase in inflammatory cytokine production; 3) increased
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in islet structural damage and
  β-cell dysfunction; 4) activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  pathway, leading to vascular remodeling and promotion of CV disease. All of these
  biological effects cause impairment of glucose metabolism and insulin resistance,
  thus contributing to the development of diabetes. Inhibition of RAS by either angiotensin
  converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB)
  prevents these detrimental effects of angiotensin II on glucose metabolism and insulin
  resistance, therefore potentially reducing the development of diabetes and cardiovascular
  complications.Abbreviation: IRS1, insulin receptor substrate-1.'
