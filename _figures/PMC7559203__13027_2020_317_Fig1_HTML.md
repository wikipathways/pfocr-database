caption: an overview of virus-deregulated NF-κB signaling pathway in oncogenesis.
  Viral products target different components of NF-κB cascade in order to induce dimers
  activation (p65,p50 and p52,RELB; other dimers are not shown), driving the transcription
  of NF-κB target genes following the nuclear translocation. The stimulated genes
  products can be involved in inflammation, cell growth and cell survival, angiogenesis,
  metastasis, ect. On the other hand, the NF-κB may lead to production of the factors
  which negatively regulate the cascade such as IκBα. However, virus might be able
  to overcome it. For example, KSHV encodes mir-K1 mir-k12–1 to suppress IκBα. Infm/Cyto;
