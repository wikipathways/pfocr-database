caption: Summary of proposed pathogenic mechanisms in TRAPS. Binding of TNFα to TNFR1
  leads to the assembly of the signaling pathway that ultimately upregulates the gene
  expression of many pro-inflammatory cytokines. There are multiple mechanisms that
  contribute to the pathogenesis of TRAPS. Heterozygous variants affect the structure
  of the extracellular domain and impact its ability to bind to the TNF ligand. Mutant
  receptors fail to shed from the cell surface to generate soluble TNFR1 proteins,
  which function to attenuate signaling through the TNFR1 receptor. Mutated misfolded
  proteins accumulate in the cells and cause endoplasmic stress (ER), upregulation
  in the unfolded protein response (UPR), and increased production of mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). The UPR initiates ER membrane stress sensors, including
  inositol-requiring protein (IRE1)α, to restore protein folding and homeostasis in
  the ER. In the ER stress, activation of IRE1α leads to splicing of transcription
  factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) into its active form sXBP1, which acts as
  a transcription factor that can upregulate expression of many target genes. Autophagy
  is responsible for clearance of intracellular TNFR1. However, in patients with TRAPS,
  autophagy is defective and mutated proteins are not efficiently cleared from cells.
  MicroRNA can regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional
  levels by binding to the complementary mRNA sequence. MicroRNAs can be detected
  in serum and various miRNAs can serve as biomarkers of the disease activity.
