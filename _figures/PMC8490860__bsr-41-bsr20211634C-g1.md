caption: (A) Typical structure of glucosinolate []. (B) Excerpts from Petersen et
  al. [] showing a schematic view of the role of MAM in the chain elongation in glucosinolate
  biosynthesis pathway. The first step is a deamination reaction catalysed by a branched-chain
  aminotransferase, followed by a three-step cycle reaction catalysed by three enzymes,
  MAM, isopropyl malate isomerase and isopropyl malate dehydrogenase.
