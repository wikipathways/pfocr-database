caption: 'Folates and One-Carbon Cycles. There are 2 slow steps driven by DHFR, dihydrofolate
  reductase, allowing the entry of folic acid (FA) into the folate cycle. FA binds
  preferentially to folate receptor alpha (Folα) and is then internalized. Then, the
  MTHFR SNPs (methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase single-nucleotide polymorphisms)
  can alter the capacity to generate MTHF (MethylTetraHydrofolate), the only active
  compound interacting with the Methionine Synthase (MS), to regenerate Methionine
  from Homocysteine (Hcy). 5 MTHF is preferentially transported into the cells via
  the transporter SLC19A1 (reduced folates transporter, Solute carrier). Homocysteine
  can be recycled in 2 steps to form cystathionine, then cysteine: this pathway is
  not expressed in the early preimplantation embryo and is weak/absent in placenta.
  Another pathway using betaine allows the regeneration of homocysteine to methionine
  and forms dimethylglycine. This pathway BHMT (Betaine Homocysteine Transferase:
  BHMT; DMG: Dimethyl Glycine) is also poorly active in the early embryo and placenta.
  S-Adenosyl Methionine (SAM) releases a methyl group on the target molecules and
  forms S-adenosyl homocysteine. Exclamation mark symbols indicate two crucial steps
  that regulate entry of FA into the folates cycle and its activity.'
