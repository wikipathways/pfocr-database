caption: Proposed model for RTCB-1-mediated DA neuroprotection in C. elegans. This
  tentative model describes our current understanding of the underlying mechanism
  involved in RTCB-1-induced neuroprotection against DA neuron cell death caused by
  various stressors. We have determined previously that RTCB-1 protects cells from
  α-syn protein misfolding or α-syn-induced neuronal toxicity. It is possible that,
  during ER stress caused by accumulation of such toxic misfolded or unwanted proteins,
  RTCB-1 acts as an RNA modifier that regulates the splicing of the XBP-1 transcription
  factor in UPR. This in turn activates downstream factors, such as ER chaperones
  and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, and stimulates cytoprotective mechanisms
  to reestablish protein homeostasis (). In our C. elegans PD model, cells depleted
  with rtcb-1 might block the UPR pathway because of a failure in xbp-1 splicing,
  leading to cell death or DA neuronal death caused by ER overload. Alternatively,
  overexpression of RTCB-1 might lead to prolonged xbp-1 splicing, thereby enhancing
  proteostasis activity, maintaining ER stress response, and thus protecting against
  neuronal damage caused by α-syn. Based on our neurodegeneration and splicing assay,
  the association between RTCB-1 and XBP-1 could be direct or indirect in the regulation
  of the UPR pathway.
