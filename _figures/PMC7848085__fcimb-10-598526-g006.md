caption: IMD, Toll, and Jak/STAT immune pathway genes modulation in R. prolixus during
  long-term infection with T. rangeli. Possible scenario: (A) When T. rangeli infects
  the digestive tract of R. prolixus, it causes a systemic decrease in the activation
  of the Toll (by upregulating the levels of the inhibitor Rp-Cactus) and IMD (by
  downregulating the TF Rp-Relish) immune pathways, which allows the setting of the
  infection. This modulation of the immune response would also trigger the multiplication
  of the first parasites that reach the hemocoel, which proliferate and establish
  the infection in the hemolymph. (B) During hemolymph infection, the systemic inhibition
  of the IMD pathway remains (downregulation of Rp-Relish) but not the repression
  in the Toll pathway (Rp-Cactus levels return to basal); and the systemic activity
  of the Jak/STAT immune pathway is now also diminished (downregulation of the TF Rp-STAT).
  In consequence, parasite loads in the hemolymph and the digestive tract increase.
