caption: Immune evasive attributes of SpA. SpA coats the surface of S. aureus and
  binds the Fcγ domain of antibodies to block their effector functions and inhibit
  opsonophagocytosis. Cell wall–anchored SpA is released from the bacterial surface
  by murein hydrolases and cross-links B cell receptors of VH3 clonal B lymphocytes.
  SpA induces B cell proliferation and maturation into antibody-secreting cells (ASC)
  via a pathway requiring CD4 T cells, MHC class II activation, activation-induced
  cytidine deamination (AID), and somatic hypermutation (SHM) for the secretion of
  mature antibodies. SpA induces the secretion VH3 clonal antibodies that are nonreactive
  to staphylococcal antigens. The B cell superantigen activity is dependent on the
  peptidoglycan modification of SpA and on RIPK2 signaling by immune cells.
