caption: 'The invertebrate olfactory transduction cascade: In invertebrates, the ORs
  are 7 transmembrane domain receptors, which associate with a co-receptor, Orco.
  Upon binding of an odorant (step 1), the OR/Orco co-receptor channel pore opens,
  allowing the influx of cations, Ca2+ and Na+ (step 2). It is possible that a G protein
  mediated pathway regulates the sensitivity of the channels, odorant binding activates
  Gs (step 3). The Gsα subunit then in turn activates adenylyl cyclase to create cAMP
  from ATP, which may mediate sensitization of the odorant response (step 4). Phosphorylation
  by PKC of the Orco receptor may mediate the olfactory neuron sensitization (step
  3).'
