caption: 'Cytokines like M-, G- and GM-CSF stimulate myeloid cell development from
  hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Increased production of these cytokines during
  tumorogenesis interferes with normal myeloid development resulting in the generation
  of immature myeloid cells. In presence of factors like IL-6, L-1β and TNF−α, these
  differentiate into MDSCs. Furthermore, cancer cells secrete factors like PGE2 and
  CXCL12 that help in the recruitment of MDSCs to the TME. Finally, the activation
  of STAT3 pathway results in the expression of several factors like ARG-1, IDO, TGF-β,
  ROS etc. These are involved in mediating the tumor promoting function of MDSCs.
