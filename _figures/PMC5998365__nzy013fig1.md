caption: Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism. Folate (THF) cofactors are required
  for the synthesis of purine nucleotides and dTMP and the remethylation of homocysteine
  to methionine for cellular methylation reactions. The dTMP biosynthesis pathway
  enzymes (MTHFD1, SHMT1, SHMT2α, TYMS, and DHFR) are SUMO-ylated and translocate
  to the nucleus during the S-phase. The remethylation of homocysteine to methionine
  is accomplished by methionine synthase, which requires vitamin B-12 as a cofactor.
  The activated one-carbon units are designated in bold. AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
  AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide;
