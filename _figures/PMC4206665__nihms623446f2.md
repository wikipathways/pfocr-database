caption: 'Ischemia is a significant cause of acute organ injury that results from
  a decrease in regional oxygen delivery (such as low blood flow or hypoxemia), leading
  to inefficient anaerobic glycolysis as the major source of ATP production and ATP
  deficit. However, much of the tissue damage occurs during the reperfusion phase,
  leading to mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, pro-glycolytic enzyme
  depletion, pro-apoptotic proteome shift and mitochondrial dysfunction inducing oxidative
  stress. MSC can decrease ischemia-reperfusion induced injury by: (1) Restoring ATP
  levels by possibly mitochondrial transfer through connexin-43 channels and replenishing
  depleted glycolytic enzymes; (2) Decreasing reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen
  species generated during oxidative stress by either preventing their release, circumventing
  the depletion of key enzymes or by transferring reactive oxygen species scavengers
  (such as peroxiredoxins and glutathione S-transferase) into injured cells; (3) And
  restoring proteomic alterations by activating pro-survival phosphatidylinositide
  3-kinases/protein kinase B pathway via cluster of differentiation 73 or inhibiting
  p38 MAPK-caspase 3 pathway.ATP = adenosine triphosphate; CD73 = cluster of differentiation
  73; MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinases; MSC = mesenchymal stem cell; OS =
  oxidative stress; PI3/Akt = phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B; PTP
  = permeability transition pore; ROS = reactive oxygen species; RNS = reactive nitrogen
  species; TCA = tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
