caption: Nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) levels are maintained by 3 independent
  pathways (see light blue arrows). First, the Preiss-Handler pathway uses dietary
  nicotinic acid (NA) and the enzyme nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT1)
  to generate NAMN, which is then transformed into nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide
  (NAAD) by NAMN transferase (NMNAT) and finally into NAD+ by NAD+ synthase (NADS).
  Second, the de novo synthesis pathway of NAD+ from tryptophan occurs through the
  kynurenine pathway to produce 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde (ACMS). This
  metabolite is converted nonenzymatically into quinolinc acid (QUIN), which is transformed
  into NAMN by quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT). Third, nicotinic acid
  riboside (NAR) is converted into NAMN by nicotinamide riboside kinase (NMRK2). The
  second and third pathways converge with the Preiss-Handler pathway via NAMN. The
  NAD salvage pathway recycles the nicotinamide generated as a by-product of the enzymatic
  activities of NAD+-consuming enzymes. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)
  recycles nicotinamide into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NAD+ is converted
  to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) by NAD+ kinase (NADK). Pathways
  are described at https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-197264 and by Verdin
  et al. ACMSD indicates aminocarboxymuconate semialdehyde decarboxylase; AMS, α-aminomuconate
  semialdehyde; NADH, reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADPH, reduced
  form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NAM, nicotinamide; NR, nicotinamide
  riboside; and TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
