caption: p66Shc is proposed to regulate a ROS-mediated, telomere dysfunction pathway
  that signals permanent embryo arrest.Extracellular stressors such as H2O2 or intracellular
  mitochondrial ROS production can activate various kinases that subsequently activate
  p66Shc (serine-36 phosphorylation) leading to its mitochondrial translocation and
  p66Shc-mediated ROS production and release from the mitochondria that can be partially
  detoxified by antioxidants. Oxidative stress can also activate the p66Shc-Akt-FOXO
  pathway, which leads to the activation/inactivation of the forkhead family (FOXO)
  of transcription factors by post-translational modifications. The effects of acetylation
  and deacetylation of FOXO appear to be promoter specific, altering (up- or down-regulation)
  the expression of various genes that will promote permanent cell cycle arrest. Although
  high levels of intracellular ROS can lead to necrosis or apoptosis, moderate levels
  of ROS can accelerate telomere shortening and/or cause telomere-uncapping leading
  to a DNA damage response that activates permanent cell cycle arrest. This cyclic
  pattern of ROS-mediated activation of p66Shc leads towards continual intracellular
  ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction, allowing for a cellular environment
  favoring mitochondria autophagy or senescence-activation (anti-apoptosis) via a
  retrograde response and/or other Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways (not shown).
