caption: The central role of CO in migraine pathogenesis and its interaction with
  NO and other processes related to migraine. CO binds to the heme-producing carboxyhemoglobin
  (COHb), leading to tissue hypoxia and oxidative stress, which increases the levels
  of malondialdehyde (MDA) and GSH depletion, suggesting induced migraine pathogenesis.
  CO induces mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to ROS production and oxidative stress.
  CO acts as a pain-modulating neurotransmitter through interactions with NO and activation
  of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathways
