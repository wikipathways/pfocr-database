caption: The mechanism of CPP-induced differentiation of HDFs into VECs. CPP can bind
  to HOCl, inhibiting the oxidation of PHD2 at cysteine 302, thereby inhibiting the
  activity of PHD2. The inhibition of PHD2 enzyme activity promotes the increased
  protein level of HIF-1α, which promotes the expression of HEY1, therefore, increases
  the expression of VEGF, FGF-2 and PDGF-BB, and induces the differentiation of HDFs
  into VECs.
