caption: 'Processing of APP by the secretases. a | In the nonamyloidogenic pathway,
  APP is first cleaved by α-secretase within the Aβ sequence, which releases the APPsα
  ectodomain. Further processing of the resulting carboxyl terminal by γ-secretase
  results in the release of the p3 fragment. b | The amyloidogenic pathway is initiated
  when β-secretase cleaves APP at the amino terminus of the Aβ peptide and releases
  the APPsβ ectodomain. Further processing of the resulting carboxy-terminal fragment
  by γ-secretase results in the release of Aβ. c | The amino acid residues where the
  various secretases cleave APP. Aβ and p3 fragments of differing lengths are produced
  by processing of APP at two different sites by γ-secretase. Abbreviations: Aβ, amyloid-β;
  APP, amyloid precursor protein; APPsα, soluble amyloid precursor protein-α; APPsβ,
  soluble amyloid precursor protein-β; C83, carboxy-terminal fragment 83; C59, carboxy-terminal
  fragment 59; C99, carboxy-terminal fragment 99.'
