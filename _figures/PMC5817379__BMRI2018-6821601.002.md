caption: ID3 regulated adipocyte proliferation. EEDs are known to increase mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species production. Since ID3 is redox-sensitive protein, ROS increases
  ID3 expression. ID3 binds to E12 protein and releases the repression of transcription
  of downstream genes like VEGF which may induce angiogenesis. This may share a similar
  pathway with HFD-induced obesity model in which ID3 increases obesity based on angiogenesis
  that support adipocyte proliferation. The scheme shows ID3 transcription regulation
  of genes involved genes in HFD-obesity.
