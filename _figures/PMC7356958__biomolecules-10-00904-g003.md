caption: Crosstalk between the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived
  2)-like 2 (NRF2) pathways. TLR signalling initiation induces the activation of NOX
  (NADPH oxidase) enzymes to produce high quantities of ROS that, in turn, react with
  sensor Cys residues present in KEAP1 inducing NRF2 liberation and nuclear translocation
  to activate the phase II antioxidant response. NRF2-regulated genes help to stop
  the proinflammatory response, reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines
  and decreasing the formation of free radicals. TLR activation and ROS production
  increase the expression of p62 and the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPKs). The p62 protein targets KEAP1 to induce its degradation via autophagy,
  favoring the activation of the NRF2–ARE pathway. In turn, NRF2 increases the expression
  of different proteins involved in the autophagic flux, including p62, generating
  a positive feedback loop to potentiate the anti-oxidant phase II response to resolve
  the proinflammatory signaling induced by TLR activation.
