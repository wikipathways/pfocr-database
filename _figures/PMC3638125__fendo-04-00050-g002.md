caption: Intracellular signaling pathways of GLP-1R in the pancreatic β-cell. One
  of the main physiological roles of GLP-1 is to enhance insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent
  manner. To stimulate insulin secretion and biosynthesis (green), GLP-1R coupled
  to adenylyl cyclase leading to the activation of cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor II (cAMP-GEFII, also known as Epac2) signaling pathway. GLP-1 plays
  also a key role in the homeostasis of β-cell mass by inducing β-cell proliferation
  (blue) and protecting against apoptosis (red). These functions are mediated via
  the activation of the cAMP/PKA/CREB (cAMP-responsive element binding protein) and
  the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) leading to the
  activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), Protein Kinase Cζ (PKCζ), Akt-protein
  kinase B, ERK1/2 (Extracellular Regulated Kinase, named also MAPK, Mitogen-Activated
  Protein Kinase) signaling pathways, and to the up-regulation of the expression of
  the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1. GLP-1R agonists also improve β-cell function
  and survival during endoplasmic reticulum stress (purple) by enhancing of ATF-4
  translation in a cAMP- and PKA-dependent manner, promoting the up-regulation of
  the endoplasmic reticulum stress markers CHOP and GADD34 expression and the dephosphorylation
  of eIF2α. Of note, there is considerable overlap between pathways induced by the
  GLP-1R activation. Reprinted from Gastroenterology (Baggio and Drucker, ).
