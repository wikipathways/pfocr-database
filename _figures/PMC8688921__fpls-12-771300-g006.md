caption: A hypothesized working model illustrating the potential dual-function of
  HpDGAT1 in TAG and EAST biosynthesis in H. pluvialis. Briefly, under stress conditions,
  the HpDGAT1 transcript was obviously increased, which was accompanied by the significant
  increase of TAG and EAST contents. The genetic engineering of HpDGAT1 in Chlamydomonas
  reinhardtii (Cre) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Ath) significantly enhanced the MUFAs-
  and PUFAs-rich TAG accumulation. The de novo synthesized fatty acyls constitute
  the acyl-ACP or acyl-CoA pools, which consequently enter Kennedy pathway for the
  synthesis of TAG in cytoplasm endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or chloroplast ER (cER).
  HpDGAT1 could catalyze the prokaryotic TAG accumulation in chloroplast or probably
  located in cER (cER is expressed as an elbow-like line linking ER and chloroplast
  envelope) and utilized both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic DAGs for TAG assembly.
  In addition, EASTs might be synthesized in chloroplast ER or cytoplasm ER by HpDGAT1
  enzyme, which is dependent on availability of free AST and acyl-CoAs. Finally, TAG
  and EAST are together packed into oil bodies.
