caption: Diagram showing the ErGPCR-mediated nongenomic pathway response to 20E. 20E
  through ErGPCR nongenomic pathway regulates the cytosolic calcium fast increase,
  including the release of the intracellular Ca2+, and the influx of the extracellular
  Ca2+ via T-type calcium channels and TRP channels. 20E also through ErGPCR regulates
  the rapid phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Calponin, and through ErGPCR
  regulates gene transcription in the genomic pathway for metamorphosis.
