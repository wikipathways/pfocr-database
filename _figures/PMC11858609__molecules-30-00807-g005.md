caption: Depicts the JAK/STAT signaling pathway activated by the IL-2 receptor, leading
  to the phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT3 proteins. Upon receptor activation,
  JAK2 phosphorylates STAT3, which subsequently dimerizes and translocates into the
  nucleus to promote the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The pathway highlights
  the inhibitory effects of curcumin, resveratrol, and EGCG, which interfere with
  STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, thereby reducing inflammation.
