caption: KSHV activates the PI3K and ERK1/2 pathways during infection, which are heavily
  reliant on kinases (drawn as circles) to propagate the signaling cascade. Multiple
  viral proteins (colored in purple) activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (in blue)
  to promote protein translation by activating subunits of the translation initiation
  complex. The ERK1/2 pathway (in red) is similarly activated by viral proteins to
  promote protein translation through RSK. Some cross-talk (shown in green) occurs
  between both pathways. Activation of ERK1/2 also leads to the transcription of genes
  regulated by AP-1. Genes under the control of AP-1 include cytokines, which after
  being transcribed and translated are secreted out of the cell.
