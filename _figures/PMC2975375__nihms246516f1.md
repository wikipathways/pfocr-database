caption: 'A, the yeast mating pathway is activated by binding of the mating pheromone
  (α-factor) to the membrane receptor Ste2 (in “a” cells, or Ste3 in “α” cells), which
  causes the dissociation of the G protein alpha subunit (GpaI) from the G beta (Ste4)
  and gamma (Ste18) complex (, ). The scaffold protein Ste5 is then recruited to the
  membrane-localized Ste4, bringing along the MAPKKK Ste11, MAPKK Ste7 and MAPK Fus3.
  In addition, Ste11 interacts with the bridging protein Ste50, which by binding to
  the small GTPase Cdc42, positions Ste11 near its upstream activator, the PAK kinase
  Ste20 (). Activated Ste11 phosphorylates Ste7, which in turn phosphorylates Fus3.
  The activated MAPK translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates a number
  of transcription factors, leading to changes in gene transcription, cell cycle progression
  and cell morphology and culminating in the fusion between “a” and “α” cells. B,
  domain architecture of the yeast mating signaling pathway components. Regulatory
  domains are shown in green, catalytic domains are shown in orange. Fully annotated
  domain maps are given in . C, domain recombination library: recombination junctions
  are depicted as white circles, all possible recombinations are shown as red connecting
  lines. D, possible evolutionary events analyzed in this work. Gene duplication,
  domain duplication, domain recombination and co-expression of two duplicated domains.'
