caption: A. Revised model for the RecBCD recombination pathway. (i) The RecBCD enzyme
  recognises and binds to a DNA double-strand end. (ii) RecBCD generates a substrate
  with a 3’ end adjacent to a Chi site (shown as an arrow pointing in the direction
  of recombination stimulation) and a 5’ overhang. Continued unwinding by the RecBCD
  enzyme coupled to RecA loading onto the strand ending 3’ close to Chi allows the
  invasion of a target duplex and the formation of a D-loop. (iii) RuvAB binds to
  the Holliday junction end of the D-loop and migrates the Holliday junction away
  from the DSB end enlarging the D-loop. When a preferred recognition site for RuvC
  is encountered, the Holliday junction is resolved by cleavage and ligation. (iv)
  The RecG protein binds to the replication fork with a 5’ extended strand generated
  from the other end of the D-loop and unwinds the 5’ end while reannealing the parental
  DNA strands. (v) The action of RecG hands off the junction to PriA that binds in
  the correct manner to initiate the loading of DnaB. (vi) DnaB is loaded onto the
  lagging-strand template. (vii) DNA replication proceeds in the correct direction
  to restore the DNA lost in the region of the DSB. B. Hand-off between RecG and PriA
  ensures the correct loading of DnaB. The region between the dotted vertical lines
  is enlarged to show the binding of PriA. (i) RecG binds to a replication fork with
  an extended 5’ strand and unwinds this end while re-winding the parental template
  strands. (ii) This unwound fork is now in the right conformation to be bound by
  PriA in the orientation to load DnaB correctly onto the lagging-strand template.
  (iii) The hand-off reaction from PriA to PriB, to DnaT to DnaC to DnaB ensures that
  the replisome is reassembled. (iv) The replisome is loaded correctly to ensure the
  restoration of the DNA lost during the resection of the break. The box shows the
  domains of PriA as determined by X-ray crystallography []. The N terminus of the
  protein encodes the 3’ end-binding domain (3’BD–red). This is followed by a winged-helix
  domain proposed to interact with the parental DNA duplex (WH–orange). This is followed
  by two helicase lobes (HL1 –blue and HL2 –green). This is followed by a cysteine-rich
  region proposed to act as a wedge during helicase action (CRR–purple). Finally the
  protein is completed by a C-terminal domain that loops back round to the 3’BD (CTD–yellow).
  The priA300 mutation is predicted to lie in the HL1 domain. C. Action of PriA in
  the absence of RecG. The region between the dotted vertical lines is enlarged to
  show the binding of PriA. (i) A replication fork substrate with an extended 5’ new
  end is available to bind PriA but is not specifically remodelled for this hand-off
  in the absence of RecG. (ii) and (v) Because the 3’ end is readily available, PriA
  remodels the fork to ensure that the 3’ end is bound by the 3’BD and the parental
  duplex is bound by the WH domain. In structure (ii), the PriA helicase domains (HL1
  and HL2) bind correctly to the lagging-strand template and in structure (v) the
  helicase domains bind incorrectly to the new lagging-strand. The PriA(K230R) helicase
  (present in the priA300 mutant) retains only the ability to bind correctly. (iii)
  and (vi) DnaB is loaded via the hand-off mechanism from PriA to PriB to DnaT to
  DnaC to DnaB. In (iii) DnaB is loaded correctly to the lagging-strand template and
  in (vi) DnaB is loaded incorrectly to the new lagging-strand. (iv) and (vii) A replication
  fork is reassembled. In (iv) the replication fork is assembled in the correct orientation
  to restore the DNA lost in the early stages of recombination at the site of the
  DSB. In (vii) the replication fork is assembled in the incorrect orientation and
  replicates the DNA flanking the DSB site. The direction of translocation of DnaB
  is indicated by a tan arrow. D. Action of PriA in the absence of RecG and RuvAB.
  The region between the dotted lines is enlarged to show the binding of PriA. (i)
  A replication fork with an extended 5’ “new” end is available for binding by PriA.
  However, the Holliday junction associated with the fork is not resolved by RuvABC
  and the fork itself is not remodelled by RecG. (ii) PriA has difficulty to remodel
  the fork to allow binding in the 3’ end-binding mode because the presence of the
  Holliday junction interferes with the required movement of the arms of the fork.
  This results in a significant proportion of molecules being bound by PriA in its
  helicase mode where it unwinds the parental duplex arms. (iii) This causes over-winding
  of the parental arms of the fork and under-winding of the D-loop, resulting in its
  dissociation. The direction of translocation of PriA is indicated by a black arrow.
