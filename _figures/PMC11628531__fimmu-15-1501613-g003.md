caption: Synergistic effect of PD-1 and LAG-3 dual blockade in antitumor immunity.
  PD-1 and LAG-3 are co-expressed on the surface of T cells under antigen stimulation.
  When tumor cells express both PD-L1 and MHC-II, anti-PD-1 mAb is unable to completely
  block tumor cell escape, leading to acquired resistance (top). However, the combination
  of anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG-3 mAbs simultaneously blocks these two immune checkpoint
  pathways, restores the activity of T cells, and enhances the ability to recognize
  and eliminate tumor cells (bottom)
