caption: Mechanisms of combination strategies with CAR T cell therapy. The combined
  agents mainly focus on three aspects to optimize antitumor effects, including tumour
  cells, CAR T cells and the TME. For CAR T cells, attention is given to targeting
  different pathways to prevent terminal differentiation and exhaustion. In addition,
  inhibition of the Fas pathway prevents AICD, the other mechanism to prolong CAR
  T cell survival. For tumour cells, combined therapies are expected to both directly
  inhibit tumour survival and boost the cytotoxicity of CAR T cells by sensitizing
  tumours to apoptotic signalling or upregulating antigen expression. Components of
  the inhibitory microenvironment are also emerging as promising targets to enhance
  the effectiveness of CAR T cell therapy. BCR, B cell receptor; sBCMA, soluble B
  cell maturation antigen; mAb, monoclonal antibody; BiTE, bispecific T cell engager;
  TCR, T cell receptor; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
