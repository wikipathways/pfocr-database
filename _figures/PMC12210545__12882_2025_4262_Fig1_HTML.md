caption: “Four-hit” hypothesis and mucosal immunity. Antigens stimulate mucosal immunity,
  including the tonsils and intestinal mucosa. Naïve B cells encounter antigens in
  the inductive sites of mucosal immunity. IgA-specific CSR occurs via T-cell-dependent
  and T-cell-independent pathways. In the T-cell-dependent pathway, CSR is induced
  by TGF-β1, IL-6, and IL-10. CD40 on B cells binds to CD40L on activated CD4 + T
  cells, providing a costimulatory signal for B cell activation and IgA CSR. In the
  T-cell-independent pathway, CSR is mediated directly by TGF-β, IL-6, IL-10, BAFF,
  and APRIL. In IgAN, the first hit involves elevated circulating levels of Gd-IgA1.
  The second hit is the production of anti-Gd-IgA1 autoantibodies. The third hit occurs
  when these autoantibodies bind Gd-IgA1, forming circulating ICs. These ICs deposit
  in the glomerular mesangium (fourth hit), activating HMCs and complement, ultimately
  leading to renal injury. IgAN, IgA nephropathy; CSR, class-switch recombination;
  BAFF, B cell activation factor; APRIL, a proliferation-inducing ligand; Gd-IgA1,
  galactose-deficient IgA1; ICs immune complexes; HMCs, human mesangial cells
