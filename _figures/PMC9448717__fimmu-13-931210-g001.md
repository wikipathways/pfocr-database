caption: 'FH is an important regulatory protein of the complement pathway, with its
  effect mainly on the alternate pathway of the complement system. FH regulates the
  complement system via two mechanisms: DAA and CA. DAA enables FH to displace Bb
  fragment of FB off C3 convertase. Thus, the accelerated irreversible decay of C3bBb
  into C3b and Bb takes place. In the CA mechanism, FH has the role of a facilitator
  in the FI-mediated cleavage of C3b to iC3b, which is an inactivated form of C3b.
  The green ‘+’ arrows exhibit stimulatory or enhanced action whereas red ‘-’ arrows
  exhibit inhibitory action. Thus, over-amplification of the complement pathway is
  regulated by FH. The C5b-9 is one of the terminal components of the MAC which mediates
  the cell lysis and activation completing the complement cascade. The broken arrow
  implies that MAC enhances the process of thrombus formation from platelets which
  consists of a series of steps. (FH-factor-H; FI-factor-I; FB-factor-B; FD-factor-D;
  MAC-membrane attack complex; DAA-decay accelerating activity; CA-co-factor activity;
  iC3b-inactivated C3b).'
