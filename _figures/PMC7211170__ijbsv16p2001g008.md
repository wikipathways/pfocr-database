caption: 'The schematic diagram of cilostazol''s modulation on nicotine-induced autophagy
  impairment and cardiomyocytes hypertrophy through CTSB/ROS/p38MAPK/JNK pathway.
  Nicotine activates ROS/p38/JNK signaling and decreases the CTSB activity, which
  inhibits the fusion of autophagosome and lysosome. Just as the dashed green line
  showed, a negative feedback exists between ROS and autophagy flux impairment: ROS
  impairs the fusion of autophagosome and lysosome, and the impaired autophagy flux
  lead to the ROS accumulation. The nicotine-induced impaired autophagy flux leads
  to cardiomyocytes hypertrophy in NRVMs. Cilostazol rescues the nicotine-induced
  ROS accumulation, then dephosphorylates p38/JNK, alleviates autophagy impairment
  through stimulating CTSB activity and improves cardiomyocytes hypertrophy ultimately.'
