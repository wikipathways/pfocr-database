caption: Schematic representation of the physiological generation and function of
  lipid mediators in immunity. Injury to the tissue due to infection, nutritional,
  metabolic, or mechanical causes results on secretion of phospholipase A2 which acts
  on the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane generating arachidonic acid (AA).
  Arachidonic acid is the substrate from which the biologically active lipid mediators
  belonging to the eicosanoid family are produced due to the activity of enzymes belonging
  to three families (A) the COX pathway (COX1 COX2) resulting in production of prostaglandins
  (B) the LOX pathway (5-LOX, 1LOX, 15LOX) resulting in production of leukotriens
  and lipoxins, and (C) the cytochrome p450 pathway which forms the hydroxyeicosotetranoic
  acids and the epoxyeicosotrienoic acids. In addition (D) Non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation
  of AA results in the production of isoprostanes and isoketals. All these lipd mediators
  have a wide range of biologically significant functions which impact immunity.
