caption: Mechanisms of type 1 IFN induction upon DNA damage. Genotoxic agents such
  as chemotherapeutics, UV-light, or reactive oxygen species (ROS) may lead to formation
  of ssDNA, which is normally cleared by TREX1. If TREX1 is deficient, the threshold
  for ssDNA is limited. Changes in DNA-bases such as 8-oxo-dG are resistant to enzymatic
  degradation via TREX1. Upon massive DNA damage or RAD51 deficiency, the generation
  of multiple cytosolic ssDNA fragments may lead to activation of cGAS. Cutaneous
  DNA damage syndromes, such as Bloom syndrome, characterized by chromosomal instability,
  show increased formation of micronuclei with fragile nuclear envelope. Normally,
  micronuclei are processed by autophagy. Upon rupture of the nuclear envelope, micronuclei
  are sensed by cGAS, resulting in production of cGAMP, further activating STING,
  TBK1, and IRF3. Secreted type 1 IFN binds to IFNAR, acting through the JAK–STAT
  pathway, leading to a senescent phenotype. Senescent cells, which are more frequent
  in cutaneous DNA damage syndromes, show nuclear blebs, also called chromatin herniations,
  which are able to activate the type 1 IFN system through cGAS. MN, micronucleus;
