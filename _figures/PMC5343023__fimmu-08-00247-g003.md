caption: Fatty acid (FA) and cholesterol sensing in T cell immune responses. (A) FA
  metabolism and sensing serve multiple roles in T cell biology. Short-chain fatty
  acids (SCFAs) diffuse passively or are transported into cells by G-protein-coupled
  receptors. SCFAs can inhibit histone deacetylases and induce TH1 and TH17 cell differentiation
  and IL-10 production. De novo FA synthesis is required for TH17 generation. Intracellular
  FAs are recognized by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Expression
  of PPARγ is important for visceral adipose tissue Treg cell accumulation and function,
  while antagonizing PPARγ by chemical drug promotes TH17 development. (B) Cholesterol
  and cholesterol sulfates regulate T cell receptor (TCR) nanoclustering and signaling
  within the T cell. After stimulation of TCRs, T cells upregulate the cholesterol
  biosynthesis pathway through the SREBP/SCAP axis. This increase in cholesterol biosynthesis
  is important for acquiring T cell effector function. Additionally, intracellular
  sterols serve as ligands for intracellular receptors and transcription factors,
  such as liver X receptor (LXR) and RORγt to modulate TH17 development.
