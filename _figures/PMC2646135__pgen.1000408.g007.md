caption: Glucose availability is sensed through two major pathways in fission yeast,
  the Git3/PKA pathway and the glucose repression pathway. Each of these pathways
  regulates mitochondrial functions. In the present study, we underlined the importance
  of Git3/PKA dependent signaling in longevity versus the glucose repression pathway
  and the metabolic effect of glycolysis. Git3/PKA signal inhibits mitochondrial respiration,
  oxidative stress response and promotes ROS formation and pro-aging phenotypes. Discontinuous
  line represents functions inferred by homology with S. cerevisiae. Question mark
  represents the possible role of mitochondria in aging besides ROS production.
