caption: The representation of different mechanisms of estrogen signaling (adapted
  from Vrtačnik et al. 2014). I. The direct genomic pathway, which is considered the
  classical mechanism of estrogen signaling, promotes expression of the target gene
  by direct binding of the E2-ER dimer to the ERE. II. In the indirect genomic signaling
  pathway, E2-activated ERs bind DNA through protein–protein interactions with other
  classes of transcription factors at their respective response elements. III. The
  non-genomic signaling pathway begins with the binding of E2 to ERs located at the
  plasma membrane, which leads to the activation of various protein kinase cascades.
  These can ultimately lead to changes in gene expression via the phosphorylation
  of transcription factors. E2 17β-estradiol; ER estrogen receptor; ERE estrogen response
