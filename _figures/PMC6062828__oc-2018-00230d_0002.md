caption: (a) Presynaptic homeostatic functions of calcineurin (CaN). (A) CaN plays
  an integral role in vesicle exocytosis by regulating the release in coordination
  with neurotransmission signaling. The influx of calcium (Ca2+) activates CaN and
  causes it to dephosphorylate synapsin 1, removing its suppression of vesicles and
  allowing them to move from the release-reluctant resting pool toward the axonal
  terminal for release. The process is reversed by the phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent
  kinase 5 (CDK5). (B) CaN also plays a role in endocytosis of vesicles after activation
  by Ca2+ and then dephosphorylation of dynamin 1. CaN and dynamin 1 form a complex
  and move toward the endocytotic packaging assembly where involved proteins allow
  for the packaging of the vesicle at the axonal terminal, its uptake, and delivery
  of the vesicle toward the vesicle pool for recycling. This series of synaptic cycling
  and recycling by CaN is tightly coordinated and coupled to the Ca2+-dependent signaling
  along with the crosstalk of involved proteins. Interruptions in the processes can
  disturb the equilibria of neurotransmission and often lead to neuronal impair. (b)
  Postsynaptic homeostatic functions of calcineurin (CaN). Postsynaptically, CaN tightly
  regulates several functions. It controls intracellular Ca2+ levels through modulation
  of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), NMDA (N-methly-d-aspartate), and AMPA
  (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors. Influx of Ca2+
  through VGCCs tends to trigger the release of more Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum
  (calcium-induced calcium release) via ryanodine and inositol triphosphate receptors
  (RyRs and IP3Rs). The increased Ca2+ load activates CaN, and through a negative
  feedback control, it dephosphorylates VGCCs, RyRs, and IP3Rs, decreasing the duration
  of opening and frequency as well as weakening the incoming cationic currents. Ca2+
  influx via NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and the Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (AMPARs)
  follows a similar pathway of Ca2+ regulation and decreases long-term potentiation
  (LTP) through internalization and reduced NMDAR and AMPAR expression and increasing
  long-term depotentiation (LTD). This Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) reinitiates
  the opening of these channels by triggering kinases, like protein kinase A (PKA)
  which complexes with A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP79/150) after guided
  by microtubule-associated protein 2B (MAP2B), that cause rephosphorylation. In the
  case of voltage-gated A-type potassium 4.2 (Kv4.2) channels, however, phosphorylation
  of the channels results in internalization and increased long-term potentiation
  (LTP) while the process is reversed after dephosphorylation by CaN.
