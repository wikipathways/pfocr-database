caption: Schematic illustration of cGAMP delivery using liposomes. (A) The structure
  of liposomal cGAMP. (B) Compared to free cGAMP, liposomal cGAMP improved cellular
  uptake by antigen-presenting cells due to the benefit of positive charge, and after
  cell endocytosis, liposomal cGAMP can facilitate cGAMP to release from endosomes
  to further bind STING located in cytosol, triggering STING signaling pathway. Adapted
