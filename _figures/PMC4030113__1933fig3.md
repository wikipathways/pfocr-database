caption: 'Abnormalities in IRS1 interaction in the KEGG Oxidative Phosphorylation
  metabolic pathway. The figure for the KEGG Oxidative Phosphorylation metabolic pathway
  was downloaded from http://www.kegg.jp and modified to add color-coding to IRS1
  partners according to their differences in IRS1 interaction among LCs, OCs, and
  T2D patients. If a protein has altered interactions with IRS1 in more than one comparison,
  it may be highlighted in more than one color. In total, 18 IRS1 interaction partners,
  all of which were novel, were assigned to the KEGG Oxidative Phosphorylation metabolic
  pathway: 14 in Complex I (shown in the NADH dehydrogenase block), 3 in Complex III
  (shown in the cytochrome c reductase block), and 1 in Complex IV (shown in the cytochrome
  c oxidase block). Among them, nine partners showed no differences in IRS1 interaction
  among LCs, OCs, and T2D patients (highlighted in green); one was insulin-stimulated
  in OCs, but not in LCs (NDUFA2, highlighted in light blue); two were insulin-stimulated
  in the muscle of T2D patients, but not in that of LCs or OCs (NDUFS8 and NDUFV1,
  highlighted in red); four had increased association with IRS1 in 2-h insulin-stimulated
  T2D patient muscle vs. 2-h insulin-stimulated LC muscle (NDUFA2, NDUFV1, QCR7, and
  QCR8, highlighted in orange); four had increased interaction with IRS1 in 2-h insulin-stimulated
  OC muscle vs. 2-h insulin-stimulated LC muscle (NDUFA10, NDUFB7, NDUFS6, and COX6C,
  highlighted in brown); and four exhibited altered interaction with IRS1 in 2-h insulin-stimulated
  T2D muscle vs. 2-h insulin-stimulated OC muscle (NDUFB7, NDUFS6, NDUFV1, and COX6C,
  highlighted in light green).'
