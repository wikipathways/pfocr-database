caption: Hormonal and environmental regulation of leaf senescence. YCCA6 is responsible
  for the biosynthesis of auxin which inhibits leaf senescence in young leaves. The
  auxin responsive genes SAUR36, ARF2, and ANT2 inhibit leaf senescence in young leaves.
  OsCKX11 degrades cytokinins in rice during leaf senescence. Arabidopsis MYB2 regulates
  plant senescence by affecting the cytokinin homeostasis. Activation of the cytokinin
  receptor AHK3 (ORE12) significantly delays leaf senescence. DELLA proteins interact
  with TFs WRKY45 and WRKY6 and suppress leaf senescence. ABA receptor PYL9 functions
  in response to ABA and actives signaling components including ABF2/3/4, ABI5/EEL
  and AtNAP to promote leaf senescence. SAG113 and AAO3 are two direct target genes
  of the AtNAP TF. Ethylene regulates leaf senescence through the EIN2-EIN3-miR164-ORE1
  pathway. In addition, ORE1 promotes ethylene synthesis via activating ethylene biosynthesis
  gene ACS. JA induces leaf senescence via a signaling pathway involving COI1, JAZ
  proteins, MYC2/3/4 and NAC proteins ANAC019/055/072. SL induces leaf senescence
  through TFs ORE9/MAX2. WRKY family TFs WRKY28, 46, 55, 75 and the WHIRLY1 protein
  induce the expression of ICS1 for SA biosynthesis and SA induces S3H and S5H which
  convert SA to hydroxylated SA. SA induces ROS accumulation via the signaling pathway
  NPR1-PAD4-EDS1, promoting leaf senescence. Arabidopsis circadian evening complex
  (EC) negatively regulates JA-induced leaf senescence by suppress the expression
  of MYC2. PRR9 functions as a positive regulator of leaf senescence by repressing
  the transcription of miR164 and activating ORE1 expression. CCA1 counteracts leaf
  senescence by directly activating GLK2 and suppressing ORE1 expression. ELF3 and
  PhyB delay leaf senescence by suppressing the transcription and protein accumulation
  of PIF4/PIF5. Moreover, PIF4/PIF5 directly activates expression of EIN3, ABI5 and
  EEL. TF SOC1 is responsive to light and negatively regulates leaf senescence. Drought
  induces leaf senescence via activating the ABA signaling pathway. Pathogens induce
  the expression of WRKY TFs such as WRKY55, promote SA biosynthesis and ROS accumulation,
  leading to leaf senescence
