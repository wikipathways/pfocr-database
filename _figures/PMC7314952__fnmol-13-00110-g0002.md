caption: Mechanism of ferroptosis, ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)–coenzyme
  Q10 (CoQ10)–NAD (P)H pathway. GPX4 utilizes the GSH as a substrate to reduce lipid
  hydroperoxides and inhibited the ferroptosis, GSSG generated by GPX4 is reduced
  back to glutathione by GR in Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH),
  ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) can complement the loss of GPX4, conferring
  protection against ferroptosis, and FSP1 catalyzes the regeneration of CoQ10 through
  NAD (P)H. NAD (P)H also can inhibit the ferroptosis via CoQ10.
