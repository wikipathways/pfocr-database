caption: Proposed model for the TOR signaling pathway in the green model microalga
  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The TOR kinase forms a high molecular mass complex with
  LST8 and Raptor similar to TORC1 that can be targeted by rapamycin–FKBP12. TOR activity
  is controlled by nutrients including phosphorus via LST8 protein abundance () and
  nitrogen (). The photosynthetic assimilation of CO2 also activates TOR through the
  CBB cycle and the synthesis of the central amino acids Ala, Leu, Val, Glu, and Gln
  (). It is currently unknown whether other metabolites may regulate TOR activity
  in Chlamydomonas. In the presence of nutrients, TOR is active and promotes cell
  growth by activating translation and repressing other processes that are usually
  induced upon nutrient stress such as autophagy and the synthesis of energy storage
  molecules (TAG and starch).
