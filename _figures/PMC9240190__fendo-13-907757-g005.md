caption: 'Rho/ROCK, Notch, and TGF-β signaling pathways. Rho/ROCK signaling pathway:
  Rho proteins can be activated by GEFs, involving the conversion of Rho-GDP to Rho-GTP,
  which activates ROCK. Notch signaling pathway: Notch signaling is initiated when
  ligands (Delta or Jagged) on the origin cell bind to Notch receptors on the recipient
  cell. Membrane-situated ADAM10 clamps the Notch extracellular domain to the plasma
  membrane and causes the release of the extracellular Notch fragment, still bound
  to its ligand, which initiates intracellular signaling. The remaining part of the
  Notch molecule is processed by a γ-secretase protease complex, which results in
  the release of the NICD. The NICD is then translocated to the nucleus, where it
  forms a Notch transcriptional activation complex with the DNA-binding protein CSL
  (also known as RBP-JK) and regulates Notch target gene expression. TGF-β signaling
  pathway: Active TGF-β binds to type II and type I receptors, activating downstream
  SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent signaling pathways, including the RhoA and MAPK
  signaling pathways. GEFs, guanine nucleotide exchange factors; GAPs, GTPase-activating
  proteins; LIMK, LIM kinase; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; p-MLC, phospho-myosin
