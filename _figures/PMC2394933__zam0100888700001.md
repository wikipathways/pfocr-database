caption: '(A) The heterologous pathway produces mevalonate from acetyl-CoA in three
  biochemical steps. The data presented in this article show that the growth inhibition
  associated with the pathway intermediate HMG-CoA is due to inhibition of malonyl-CoA:ACP
  transacylase (FabD) in E. coli''s type II FAB pathway. The inhibition of the FAB
  pathway invokes a generalized stress response in the mevalonate-producing strain.
  As can be seen, the heterologous intermediate is similar in structure to malonyl-CoA,
  the native substrate for FabD. Abbreviations: A-CoA, acetyl-CoA; AA-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA;
  HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; FDP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.
  (B) Genes of the heterologous mevalonate-producing pathway in E. coli as well as
  the inactive-pathway control, which due to a point mutation in ERG13, cannot produce
  HMG-CoA or mevalonate. Abbreviations: atoB, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase gene; Erg13,
  HMG-CoA synthase gene; tHMGR, truncated HMG-CoA reductase gene; Erg13(C159A), inactive
  HMG-CoA synthase gene.'
