caption: 'VSMC phenotypic diversity in hereditary AAs. The aortic wall consists of
  VSMCs from different embryonic origins that respond unevenly to genetic defects
  that directly or indirectly regulate VSMC contractile phenotype, which results in
  heterogeneous susceptibility to aortic diseases. (A) provides an overview of the
  origin of VSMCs in the aortic wall. The ascending aorta is composed of VSMCs derived
  from SHF and CNC. The former wraps outside of the latter in a “sleeve-shaped” form,
  However, mesoderm-derived VSMCs predominate in the abdominal aorta. (B) depicts
  a plausible hypothesis that the ascending aorta is susceptible to AAs and ADs when
  genetic defects are present. VSMCs with distinct embryonic backgrounds show different
  responses to signaling perturbations. Compared to CNC-derived VSMCs, SHF-derived
  VSMCs are more prone to lose their contractile phenotype and cause pathological
  ECM remodeling. This leads to a reduction in the strength of the aortic wall, making
  it susceptible to swelling. Moreover, the turbulent blood flow can easily cause
  tearing along the interface between the 2 VSMCs, leading to the occurrence of ADs
  in the presence of damaged endothelium. (C) shows the dysfunctional phenotypes of
  VSMCs from different origins with genetic defects. Fibrillin-1 is the primary protein
  found in the microfibril extensions of elastic lamellae, which are attached to focal
  adhesions on the surface of VSMCs. It is also associated with TGF-β binding proteins
  (LTBP), which are involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway. Genetic defects in fibrillin-1
  (MFS) and defects in the TGF-β signaling pathway (LDS) affect the phenotype of both
  VSMCs, with SHF-derived VSMCs being more susceptible to loss of the contractile
  phenotype. The direction of arrows indicates the trend of gene expression levels:
