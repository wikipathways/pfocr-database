caption: Schematic presentation of the GDH pathway. Synthesis of glutamate occurs
  through the action of NADP-GDH (encoded by GDH1 and GDH3 genes). NAD-GDH activity
  (encoded by GDH2) is responsible for glutamate degradation and release of ammonium
  and α-ketoglutarate. GDH2 glutamate dehydrogenase 2
