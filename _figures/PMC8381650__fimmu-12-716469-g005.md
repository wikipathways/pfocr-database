caption: 'NF-κB, a key player in central and peripheral immune tolerance. (A) Central
  tolerance: The thymic stroma is crucial for the growth, differentiation, positive
  and negative selection of the T-cell receptor repertoire. The thymic stromal compartment
  is composed of epithelium, fibroblasts, endothelium, macrophages and dendritic cells,
  each of which has a distinct role in T-cell development. Single-positive (SP) thymocytes
  after positive selection have to migrate into medulla to undergo negative selection
  and further maturation, given the critical role of mTECs in presenting tissue-restricted
  antigens (TRAs). The thymic medulla is indeed the main site for both negative selection
  of autoreactive thymocytes and positive selection of Tregs, two important central
  tolerance mechanisms. (1) First, the classical and alternative pathway of NF-κB
  activation contributes to the survival of immature cells during the negative selection
  and thereafter. (2) Second, the alternative NF-κB pathway regulates AIRE/TRAs expression
  and is involved in mTEC development, homeostasis and function. Bcl3 and RelB also
  regulate mTEC development at the DNA level. The deubiquitinase CylD is implicated
  in mTEC differentiation (3). Third, NF-κB also regulates the expression of chemokines
  (CCL19, CCL21, CCR7) implicated in cortex to medulla migration of DP thymocytes
  and to secondary lymphocytes organs and tissues. (4) Fourth, the NF-kB pathway has
  also been shown to influence thymic or natural Treg (nTreg) cells development and
  function. These cells recognize self-antigens and play an important role in the
  maintenance of immunological self-tolerance. Forkhead Box P3 (FOXP3) is the main
  transcription factor for the differentiation of these cells. NF-κB is important
  for the maintenance and functions of nTregs and the expression of FOXP3. (5) Fifth,
  in B cells, NF-κB participates in clonal deletion of autoreactive B lymphocytes
  and receptor editing, a protective mechanism of ongoing gene rearrangement that
  generates a new receptor with an innocuous specificity that prevents cell death
  by apoptosis. If the BCR recognizes sel-antigen, it is down regulated under the
  control of IRF4, a target gene of NF-κB. (B) Peripheral tolerance: Peripheral tolerance
  takes place in the periphery and its purpose is to ensure that T cells and B cells
  that escape from the thymus cannot give rise to autoimmunity. NF-κB signaling is
  essential for the development and maintenance of secondary and tertiary lymphoids
  organs. In B cells, peripheral tolerance uses two different mechanisms: (1) Anergy,
  which is characterized by desensitization of BCR signalling and its uncoupling from
  the NF-κB pathway, resulting in a failure of antigen presentation and antibody production.
  (2) NF-κB is essential for the survival of developing B cells in the spleen. Bcl2
  is involved in the survival of transitional B cells. The classical and alternative
  pathways pathway of NF-κB activation are involved in B cells maturation. In T cells,
  peripheral tolerance uses four different mechanisms: (1) Inactivation of effector
  T cells by clonal deletion. Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is an essential mechanism
  leading to clonal deletion of T cells with high affinity for self-antigens. NF-κB
  plays a pro-apoptotic role in negative selection. (2) T-cells ignore certain self-antigens
  because they are located in immune-privileged sites or because they have low immunogenicity
  (low levels of expression or low binding affinity). (3) Conversion of T cells in
  Tregs. Non canonical NF-κB activation is important for the maintenance of these
  cells in vivo via its effect on mTEC development and canonical NF-κB plays is involved
  in Foxp3 expression which is fundamental for the function of Tregs. Components of
  the TCR-mediated NF-κB pathway such as TAK1, IKK, CARMA1 and Bcl10 are also involved
  in Tregs development. Ubiquitination is fundamental for Tregs functions. (4) Induction
  of anergy. Anergy is a tolerance mechanism in which lymphocytes are intrinsically
  functionally inactive. NF-κB is inactive in these unresponsive lymphocytes. NF-κB
  also controls DCs maturation.'
