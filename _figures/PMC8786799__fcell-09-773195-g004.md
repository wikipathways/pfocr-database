caption: 'This is a hypothetical model based on multiple studies of H1.2 PTM (post-translational
  modifications) after DNA damage. When H1299 or U2OS cells are treated with DNA damage
  inducing agents etoposide or bleomycin, H1.2 is phosphorylated by DNA-PK (DNA-dependent
  protein kinase) in T146, these modifications allow the recruitment of transcription
  factors to the target promoter regions of p53 and the remodeling of chromatin in
  response to DNA damage; treating HeLa, U2OS or other tumor cells with etoposide
  or ionizing radiation, but not UV irradiation, H1.2 is PARylated (Protein poly ADP-ribosylation)
  in S188 by PARP1 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1) and displaced from chromatin for
  degradation, which is necessary to appropriately activate ATM (ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated) for regulating the response to and repair of DNA damage; These modifications
  alter the binding affinity of H1.2 to chromatin, thereby dissociating H1.2 from
  chromatin. Upon DNA damage induced by bleomycin or X-ray in tumor cells such as
  MEFs and Hela, but not UV irradiation, via an unknown mechanism H1.2 then undergoes
  nuclear-to-mitochondrial translocation and activates Bak (is a pro-apoptotic protein
  from the Bcl-2 protein family) or other unknown proteins to mediate apoptosis through
  the mitochondrial pathway. H1.2 also functions to compact chromatin and regulate
  transcriptional activity within the nucleus. (Cyc c: cytochrome c.)'
