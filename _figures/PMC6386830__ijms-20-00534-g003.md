caption: (A) Visualization of metabolic dynamics of secondary metabolism in skin tissues
  of developing grape berries. Representative metabolites with significantly statistical
  increases and declines more than three stages in RR are written in red and green
  letters, respectively. Metabolites with black letters indicate their dynamic changes
  were not significantly different between root restriction (RR) and traditional cultivation
  (RC). Metabolites with grey letters represent undetected metabolites. (B) Partial
  of representative metabolites are presented. The relative levels of metabolites
  were averaged with three biological replicates. Bars represent standard errors.
  Significant differences were signaled by an asterisk (p < 0.05) using t-test. Each
  color of background represents one subclass of phenolic pathway.
