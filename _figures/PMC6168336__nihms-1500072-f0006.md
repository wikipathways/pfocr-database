caption: In this illustration, potential mechanisms of tumor cell survival via crosstalk
  between components of the MET pathway, glycolysis, and autophagy are depicted. Basal
  levels of autophagy are typically low through mTOR inhibition of ULK1, a key enzyme
  in upregulation of autophagy, and glycolysis predominates as the main mechanism
  for ATP generation. Aberrant MET activation leads to upregulation of downstream
  effectors including components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and glycolytic metabolism
  is maintained. Through blockade of MET and subsequent indirect activation of ULK1
  through the absence of negative feedback with mTOR inhibition, upregulation in autophagy
  occurs to maintain cellular homeostasis. A simplified canonical pathway of autophagy
  (steps 1–4) are shown.
