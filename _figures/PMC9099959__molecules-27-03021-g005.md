caption: Interconnectivity of the pathways leading to the activation of the NF-B and
  MAPK signaling pathways that induce cellular inflammation. The tumor necrosis factor
  receptor 1 (TNFR1) plays an essential role in pro-inflammatory activities. Upon
  TNFR1’s stimulation TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) is recruited along
  with receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIP1), which in turn
  activates transforming growth factor -activated kinase 1 (TAK1). TAK1 can also be
  activated through the interleukin-1 receptor/toll-like receptor (IL-1R/TLR). Once
  IL-1R/TLR is activated, it triggers the activation of the TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6) downstream. TRAF6 then combines with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes
  Ubc13/UBE2N and ultimately activates TAK1. TAK1 then activates the nuclear factor-B
  (NF-B) signaling pathway, which recruits the NF-B transcription factor, leading
  to the production of cytokines. TAK1 can also induce a cascade of mitogen-activated
  kinases (MAPKs), including the c-Jun kinases (JNKs) or the p38 MAPK. This activates
  the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor leading to the production of
  cytokines. In addition to activating TAK1, TRAF6 can also activate downstream interferon
  regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) via the TLR7/8/9-MyD88 pathway, leading to the production
  of type 1 interferon. TRAF6, TRAF2, and UBE2N were identified by our pipeline as
  important for predicting AhR toxicity, implying that these proteins may be modulated
  by compounds known to induce this toxic phenotype via the depicted pro-inflammatory
  pathways.
