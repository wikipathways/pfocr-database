caption: Mitochondria are susceptible to ROS and they generate and maintain stability
  through quality control pathway. Excessive mitophagy will release metal ions in
  mitochondria, in which copper and iron undergo Fenton reaction and release a large
  amount of ROS, activating the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, DAMPs-induced pyroptosis,
  and GSDMD-mediated necroptosis. Excessive iron ions and ROS react with PUFAs in
  a chain reaction, leading to uncontrollable lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis,
  or converting anti-apoptotic Fas into pro-apoptotic and promoting apoptosis or necroptosis.
  Copper ions induce cuproptosis by triggering protein lipoylation, or inhibit MAD
  and mitoTAD to aggravate mitochondrial stress and damage. The graph was created
