caption: A schematic diagram of the inhibition of proliferation by SO2 and the pathways.
  PDGF-BB can promote VSMC proliferation by activating Erk/MAPK pathway after combining
  with its specific RTKs. The increasing cAMP concentration in VSMCs induces PKA activation,
  which can disturb Erk/MAPK signaling transduction by inhibiting c-Raf activation.
  SO2 derivatives can suppress the activities of Erk1/2, MEK1/2 and c-Raf, which does
  not result from separate targeting interferences of SO2 derivatives on the three
  molecules but from the inhibition of upstream signaling by SO2 derivatives. SO2
  derivatives might enhance adenylyl cyclase activity to elevate cAMP production from
  ATP and then activate PKA signal to block c-Raf activation, which finally contributes
  to the suppression of PDGF-BB-induced VSMC proliferation by SO2 derivatives
