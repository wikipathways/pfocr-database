caption: 'Schematic diagram of the signal transduction mechanism of SWELL1 in different
  tissues and cells. SWELL1 exerts regulatory effects in different tissues and cells
  through various signaling pathways: (1) Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue: SWELL1
  forms a complex with Cav1 and Grb2 to regulate the insulin signaling pathway, thereby
  affecting glucose metabolism. (2) Pancreatic beta cells: Glucose metabolism or changes
  in cell volume activate SWELL1, which interacts with voltage-gated calcium channels
  to promote calcium influx and trigger insulin secretion. (3) Liver tissue: SWELL1
  affects lipid metabolism by regulating PPAR γ signaling and arachidonic acid metabolism
  pathways. (4) Cancer cells: SWELL1 regulates cancer cell proliferation and migration
  through signaling pathways such as PKCa and JUN, and regulates cancer cell apoptosis
  through signaling pathways such as p53 and PI3K/AKT. The solid pointed arrow represents
  promotion, the solid flat arrow represents inhibition, and the dashed arrow represents
  potential or indirect mechanisms'
