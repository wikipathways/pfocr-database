caption: After phagocytosis, Mtb permeabilizes the phagosomal membrane enabling the
  translocation of TNT to the cytosol (). TNT hydrolyzes the cytosolic NAD+ to nicotinamide
  (NAM) and ADP-ribose (ADPr), activating the necroptosis effectors RIPK3 and MLKL
  (). Activated RIPK3 migrates to the mitochondria and recruits Bcl-xL (). The RIPK3-Bcl-xL
  complex prevents caspase-8 activation and, together with oligomerized pMLKL, induces
  ROS production by opening the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore and
  other mechanisms (pathway 1a). The enzymatic activity of TNT also increases ROS
  production in a necroptosis-independent manner as a consequence of either NAD+ depletion
  or by signaling of the NAD+ hydrolysis products (pathway 1b). Additionally, necroptosis
  is activated by Mtb in a TNT-independent manner and induces ROS accumulation by
  the RIPK3/MLKL pathway (pathway 2a). Other uncharacterized Mtb factors also contribute
  to ROS production in macrophages infected with Mtb in a TNT- and necroptosis-independent
  manner (pathway 2b).
