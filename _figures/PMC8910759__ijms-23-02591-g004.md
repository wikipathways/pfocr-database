caption: 'Overview of DAMPS activating other pathways: (a) In CD14-dependent pathway,
  DAMPs such as biglycan, versican, HSP60, and HSP70 activate TLR2, whereas DAMPs
  such as biglycan, HSP60, HSP70, S100A8, and S100A9) activate TLR4 signaling. After
  TLRs become activated, they dimerize and recruit downstream adaptor molecules, such
  as myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88), initiating downstream
  signaling cascades that converge at NFκB and AP1 and leading to the transcription
  of inflammatory factors; (b) in ILR1/ST2 signaling pathway, DAMPs such as IL-1α
  and IL-33 can signal through IL1R1/IL1RAP. IL-1 or IL-33 activate the heterodimeric
  signaling receptor complex formation of IL1R1/IL1RAP, which creates the scaffold
  for MyD88 dimerization converging to NFκB pathway; (c) in CD91 signaling pathway,
  DAMPs such as calreticulin, HSP60, and HSP70 interact with CD91, which leads to
  endocytosis of calreticulin or HSPs and proteosome degradation, and cross-presentation
  of the chaperoned antigens culminating in co-stimulation of T cells; (d) in DNGR1
  signaling pathway, F-actin interacts with DNGR1, which signals through the spleen
  tyrosine kinase (SYK), diverting phagocytosed cargo toward endosomal compartments,
  leading to cross-presentation and generation of resident memory CD8+ T cells.'
