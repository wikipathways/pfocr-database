caption: Key signaling pathways modulated by CD5 expression in B cells. A schematic
  depicting key kinases and signaling pathways whose activities are modulated by CD5
  expression in B cells. Only major targets that are influenced by CD5 expression
  are shown and are based on kinome array and Western blot analyses from our recent
  study and data from the literature. In addition to promoting IL-10 production and
  downregulating BCR-mediated signaling, CD5 induces activation of at least three
  signaling pathways that are key for cell survival, metabolism and cytokine, and
  autoantibody production, the MAPK (Ras/Erk) pathway, the Ca2+-calmodulin-calcineurin-NFAT
  pathway and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
