caption: Schematic of the mechanisms by which IL-8 inhibits the signaling pathway
  of the β2AR in ATII cells. IL-8/CINC-1 causes the translocation of GRK2 and PI3K
  to the cell membrane. This protein complex causes phosphorylation at the Ser355
  heterologous desensitization and down-regulation of the β2AR in ATII cells. IL-8/CINC
  then prevents the activation of cAMP/PKA pathway that up-regulates the vectorial
  fluid transport across the alveolar epithelium via phosphorylation and increased
  expression of CFTR at the plasma membrane of ATII cells. Solid lines indicate the
  pathways stimulated by IL-8/CINC-1; dashed lines indicate the pathways inhibited
  by these mediators.
