caption: HER2 and PI3K-targeted therapies result in FOXO3a-mediated feedback up-regulation
  of HER3 and IGF-1R and provide an escape from PI3K pathway inhibition. In the basal
  state AKT-mediated FOXO3a phosphorylation inhibits translocation of FOXO3a to the
  nucleus and provides a basal inhibition of RTK synthesis (A). In the presence of
  PI3K inhibition, via either upstream RTK blockade or small molecule inhibitors,
  decreased AKT activity allows FOXO3a to translocate to the nucleus and effect transcription
  of FOXO3a target genes, including HER3 and IGF-1R (B). The increased RTK expression
  mediates resistance to PI3K inhibition via increasing input into the PI3K pathway
  and alternate growth pathways including MAPK. Dotted lines represent multiple steps
  not shown graphically, line strength represents relative activation. RTK; receptor
