caption: A proposed model of intracellular pathways engaged within, and functions
  of, HSV-specific CD8+ T cells from protected ASYMP individuals. (A) In ASYMP individuals,
  HSV-specific memory CD8+T cells develop more toward “protective” CD44high CD62Llow
  CD8+ TEM cells. Cell surface receptors on CD8+ TEM cells are engaged by IFN-γ, IL-6,
  and IL-2, leading to cell stimulation through JAK/STAT pathways. Activation of JAK1
  and JAK3 mediates recruitment of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3. (B) HSV-specific CD8+
  TEM cells from ASYMP individuals activated through type I interferon (IFN) and the
  JAK/STAT pathway proliferate and produce high levels of GzmB, GzmK, IFN-γ, tumor
  necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), PFN, and CD107a/b, resulting in multifunctional CD8+
  T cells that efficiently kill HSV-1-infected cells. Reduction in virus load leads
  to a decrease in recurrent herpetic disease.
