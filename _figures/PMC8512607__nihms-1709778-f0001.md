caption: 'Scheme shows the enzymes of sphingolipid synthesis in S. cerevisiae (Dickson
  et al, 1998) []. The first step is catalyzed by serine-palmitoyl transferase complex
  (SPT), which catalyzes the condensation of a L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA to 3-ketodihydrosphingosine,
  CoA and CO2 (Pinto et al, 1992) []. This reaction takes place in the endoplasmic
  reticulum [] and its activity is inhibited by myriocin []. 3-ketodihydrosphingosine
  is the precursor of the long chain bases (LCBs) dihydrosphingosine (DHS) and phytosphingosine
  (PHS). These are N-acylated to form either dihydro- or phytoceramide. The novo pathway
  is catalyzed by the ceramide synthases Lag1p, Lac1p and Lip1p []. Sphingoid bases
  can also be formed by degradation of ceramides by activation of Ydc1p and Ypc1p
  ceramidases []. These first group of reactions are conserved during evolution among
  the eukaryotic kingdom [,] but the formation of dihydroceramide and phytoceramide
  is different, as hydroxylation of DHS to form PHS and phytoceramide catalyzed by
  Sur2p is unique to yeast []. In S. cerevisiae, unlike mammalian cells, inositol
  phosphate and mannose are incorporated to form complex ceramides, inositol phosphoceramides
  (IPC), mannosylinositolphosphoceramide (MIPC) and mannosyldiinositolphosphoceramide
  (M(IP)2C). We highlighted in blue boxes the enzymes which were found to be transcriptionally
  regulated in swi4Δ cells (see ) which are Lcb2p (subunit of SPT complex), Tsc10p
  (3-ketosphinganine reductase), Sur2p (sphinganine C4-hydroxylase), Lac1p (ceramide
  synthase component), , Ydc1p (alkaline dihydroceramidase), Aur1p (phosphatidylinositol:
  ceramide phosphoinositol transferase), Scs7p (sphingolipid α-hydroxylase and desaturase),
  Sur1p (mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide synthase subunit), Csh1p (mannosylinositol
  phosphorylceramide synthase subunit) and Ipt1p (inositol phosphotransferase).'
