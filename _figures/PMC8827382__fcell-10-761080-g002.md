caption: Biological function and molecular mechanism of autophagy pathway. Autophagy
  has been initiated by the formation of pre-autophagosome structure via the action
  of several proteins. PI3K-AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have been
  influenced to initiate pre-autophagosome assembly via association of ULK1/VPS34/Beclin-1
  complex. Additionally, Atg5/Atg12/Atg16 and Atg12/Atg5/LC3 complexes are involved
  to create phagophore nucleation and macromolecules accumulation which has been elongated
  as well as bind to autophagosome formation. Lysosome binds mature autophagosome
  by the help of ESCRT/SNARE/Rab7 protein complex, resulting in autolysosome formation.
  Finally, autolysosomes have been abolished by acid hydrolases resulting in the release
  of recycling metabolites as well as nutrients.
