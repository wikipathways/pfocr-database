caption: The degree of genetic risk is indicated by shading, with darker color indicating                   increased
  risk. The model presents common functional variants in the                   MET,
  PLAUR, and SERPINE1 genes                   that, along with other genetic risk
  alleles, contribute to risk of developing ASD.                   Adaptive processes
  may prevent presentation of ASD, but additional environmental                   factors
  or the presence of multiple risk alleles result in idiopathic (multiple                   genes,
  each having a small effect) ASD. Mutations further down the PI3K pathway                   result
  in syndromic disorders, with penetrance and phenotype severity determined                   by
  a decreasing availability of adaptive processes.
