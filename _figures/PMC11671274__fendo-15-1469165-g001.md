caption: Intestinal changes in T2DM. The disordered gut microflora enters the gut
  tissue through the impaired gut barrier, activating the nucleotide oligomerization
  domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) signaling pathway of macrophages and the MyD88-dependent
  TLRs signaling pathway of dendritic cells, and jointly activating Th 1 and Th 17,
  leading to the occurrence of inflammation. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) is also involved
  in inflammation through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The decrease of Short-chain
  fatty acids (SCFAs) leads to the decrease of peptide YY (PYY) through G protein-coupled
  receptor (GPCR) 41, which in turn leads to the decrease of gut motility and nutrient
  absorption function. At the same time, the decrease of SCFAs, secondary bile acids,
  indole and Trimethylamine N-Oxide (TMAO) can lead to the decrease of glucagon-like
  peptide (GLP) and insulin sensitivity through different ways, and then lead to insulin
  resistance and blood sugar increase
