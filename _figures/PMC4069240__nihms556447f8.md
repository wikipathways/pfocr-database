caption: De novo TAG biosynthetic pathway and inhibitors. A. TAG biosynthesis is derived
  from sequential acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate by a series of acyltransferases
  and dephosphorylation by lipin. B. FSG67 is the only reported inhibitor of GPAT
  activity with an IC50 value of 25 μM. C. CT32228 is one of a small number of LPAAT
  inhibitors with a mid-nanomolar IC50 but off target toxicity limits its use in vivo.
  D. DGAT inhibitors are well-represented in the literature because of DGATs position
  in the TAG biosynthetic pathway.
