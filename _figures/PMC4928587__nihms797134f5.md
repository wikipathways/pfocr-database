caption: Proposed model for the role of PALB2 in linking BRCA1 with BRCA2 and RAD51
  in a pathway of HR. We propose that BRCA1 binds to the NH2 terminus of PALB2 following
  its own recruitment to sites of DNA damage. We suggest that the COOH terminus of
  positioned PALB2 then binds to BRCA2, which in turn regulates the assembly of the
  RAD51 nucleoprotein filament that initiates HR. In this manner, PALB2 links BRCA1,
  BRCA2, and RAD51 into a network that is required for HR. Our results suggest that
  BRCA1 and BRCA2 do not directly interact, but associate using PALB2 as an intermediary.
