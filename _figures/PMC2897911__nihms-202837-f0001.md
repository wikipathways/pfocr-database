caption: A. TLR2 and 4 recognize bacterial lipoprotein (BLP) and lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS), respectively, and signal from the cell surface via the adaptor MyD88 to activate
  proinflammatory cytokines including TNFα and IL-6. TLR3 recognizes double stranded
  RNA (dsRNA) and signals via the adaptor TRIF from an intracellular compartment to
  induce IFNβ. Upon endocytosis, TLR4 can also signal via TRIF to induce type I IFN.
  B. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells primarily express nucleic acid sensing TLRs, which
  are localized to intracellular compartments. pDCs produce vast amounts of IFNβ upon
  stimulation via a MyD88-dependent pathway. C. Conventional dendritic cells and macrophages
  express many TLRs. However, only cDCs have been reported to induce IFNβ via TLR7
  and 9. In macrophages, TLR7 and 9 signaling induces proinflammatory cytokines such
  as TNFα.
