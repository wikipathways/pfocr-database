caption: Signaling pathway of LPA-mediated DNA replication initiation. LPA work through
  LPAR3 to transactive EGFR by MMPs and to increase the expression of geminin protein
  level in the S phase through PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway. Meanwhile, LPA stimulation
  induces upregulation of DUB3 in a short time, inhibiting the ubiquitination degradation
  of geminin protein and enhancing its stability, and then positively regulating the
  DNA replication initiation of gastric cancer cells.
