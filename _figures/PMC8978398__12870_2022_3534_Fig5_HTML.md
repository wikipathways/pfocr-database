caption: The phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways in pomegranate pericarps
  under sunburn stress. The biosynthetic pathway of phenylpropanoid and flavonoid
  referring to the KEGG database (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map00940,
  https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map00941) []. Expression patterns of genes
  in the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways shown as a heatmap. The
  three on the left represent healthy fruit, and the three on the right represent
  sunburned fruit. The red indicates higher and the blue indicates lower. The compounds
  up-regulated in the metabolome analysis are marked by red arrows, and the compounds
  down-regulated are marked by green arrows
