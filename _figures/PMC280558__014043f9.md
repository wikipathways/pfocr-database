caption: Model for the Regulation of PA Biosynthesis in the Seed Coat.(A) Scheme showing
  the cadastral organization of PA-accumulating cells in three regions and their subdivisions.
  Arrowheads indicate the limit between endothelial cells that underwent a periclinal
  division (div+) and those that did not (div−).(B) Genetic regulatory pathway. Arrows
  indicate positive regulations. Gene activities prevailing in both the endothelium
  and the chalaza/micropyle are shown with boldface letters and solid arrows, and
  endothelium-specific activities are indicated with lightface letters and dashed
  arrows. The star indicates that the activity is necessary in a few cells at the
  endothelium base.
