caption: Remodeling the cellular secretory pathway to support enterovirus replication.
  (A) Trafficking between the ER and the Golgi is shown schematically in uninfected
  cells. The ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) is decorated with COPI, which
  is recruited by the small GTPase Arf1 and the guanosine exchange factor GBF1. (B)
  At the early time point, enteroviruses, such as PV or CVB3, starts replication in
  Golgi/TGN compartment. The virally-coded 3A tail-anchored membrane protein binds
  to GBF1 and Arf1 and promotes the redistribution of COPI and p115 membrane protein
  to the cytosol. These events inhibit the vesicular transport between the ER and
  Golgi/TGN. (C) At 4–10-hour time points of infection, synthesis of newly made abundant
  3A molecules leads to remodeling of the Golgi/TGN and ERGIC compartments into viral
  organelles. The replication organelles, indicated by red ovals, contain increased
  amount of PI4P lipids due to the recruitment of PI4KIIIß, which makes PI4P, via
  Arf1 with the help of 3A. The enriched PI4P contents of these replication organelles
  facilitate the binding of 3Dpol or 3CD to the membrane, thus promoting the assembly
  of the replicase complex (RC) and viral RNA synthesis. The figure was modified from
  []. (D) Factors involved in the RNA synthesis by the PV replicase assembled on the
  Golgi/TGN membrane.
