caption: Schematic depiction of uPAR/suPAR-αvβ3 integrin signaling at the glomerular
  filtration level in health and diabetic disease. In resting podocytes, uPAR interacts
  with uPA and anchored to the outer plasma membrane with GPI. This complex is connected
  to αvβ3 integrin through vitronectin, a β3 integrin ligand. This leads to the initiation
  of “outside-in” signaling events, which requires the recruitment of linker proteins
  (paxillin, talin, and vinculin) by integrins for actin involvement. This signaling
  pathway is responsible for proper actin cytoskeleton assembly, lamellipodia formation,
  growth, proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival. ECM proteins such as
  fibronectin, collagen, and laminin are also involved in many cellular activities
  including ECM organization, cell adhesion and migration. Three homologous domains
  of uPAR are denoted by D1, D2, and D3, respectively (left panel). In the hyperglycemic
  state, αvβ3 integrin activity increases causing altered adhesion, migration, and
  proliferation. These intracellular changes might initiate an “inside-out” signaling
  affecting integrin's binding affinity. Soluble uPAR also increases in circulation
  and probably contributes to the pathology of the diabetic kidney disease, which
  can be characterized as impaired cytoskeletal organization and podocyte FP effacement.
  The pathogenic suPAR is mainly generated by bone marrow-immature myeloid cells.
  Podocyte-specific expression of SMPDL-3b, which is elevated during the course of
  diabetic kidney disease, prevents αvβ3 integrin activation by interacting with suPAR.
  This eventually increases RhoA activity and podocyte susceptibility to apoptosis.
  αvβ3 integrin receptors are also expressed in glomerular endothelium and exposure
  of endothelial cells to hyperglycemia leads to pathologic outcomes in these cells
  such as endothelial permeability, migration, and proliferation in response to the
  ligand occupancy of αvβ3 and concomitant stimulation of IGF-1 (middle panel). Targeting
  uPAR and suPAR with an uPAR-specific monoclonal antibody can attenuate the adverse
  effects of uPAR/suPAR-dependent integrin signaling. Using antibodies that bind preferentially
  to the activated and/or ligand-occupied forms of β3 integrin and β3 integrin small
  molecule inhibitor, cycloRGDfV, offer alternative ways to disentangle its interactions
  with uPAR/suPAR. Blocking the ligand occupancy of αvβ3 inhibits the pathogenic mechanisms
  stimulated by IGF-1 (right panel).
