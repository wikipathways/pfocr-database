caption: The major inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA is produced from glutamic acid
  (which can interconvert with glutamine (gln)) in a reaction catalyzed by glutamic
  acid decarboxylase (GAD). Its catabolism is catalyzed by two sequential steps, the
  first GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), which produces succinic semialdehyde (SSA) that
  is subsequently oxidized to succinic acid by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase
  (SSADH). GABA-T is the target of vigabatrin (VGB) which results in its irreversible
  inactivation. A number of intermediates shown to be dysregulated by chronic VGB
  administration in mice (current study) are also depicted. Carnosine is the L-histidine
  dipeptide of β-alanine. The production of the GABA analogue, 4-guanidinobutyrate
  (4-GBA; not measured in this study but shown to be increased in patients with SSADH
  deficiency ()), is postulated to derive from condensation of GABA with arginine
  (L-arg) catalyzed by arginine amidinotransferase in the pathway of creatine metabolism
  (). The cycle of ureagenesis encompasses arginine, citrulline (cit) and ornithine
  (orn). As well, there is non-mammalian evidence that ornithine can produce glutamic
  acid in a multistep reaction sequence (). The catabolism of lysine (lys) generates
  2-aminoadipic acid (AADA) through the pathway of saccharopine metabolism, ultimately
  generating glutaryl-CoA and eventually acetyl-CoA. AADA is a 6-carbon homologue
  of glutamic acid, and its exact mechanism of generation during VGB administration,
  is unknown.
