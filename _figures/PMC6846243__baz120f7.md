caption: A control case interaction visualized on RPGeNet showing the connections
  between NRL, NR2E3 and CRX retinal transcription factors. (A) RPGeNet was queried
  to display the subnetwork among NRL, NR2E3 for the nodes at distance one at level
  one; then nodes connected to CRX were added with the ‘Node Addition’ button activated
  on click. CRX, NRL and NR2E3 are three well-known transcription factors that co-regulate
  retinal-specific genes, among them RHO. Interestingly, several other genes that
  cause retinal dystrophies also appear in the network as target genes or other transcriptional
  regulators (border shown in purple). Nodes color-fill defined by the ‘RET-ALL’ gene-expression
  data. (B) Further trimming of the subnetwork obtained by omitting the nodes that
  are not chromatin remodelers or transcription factors provide an overview of relevant
  co-regulators of retinal genes. After deleting the corresponding nodes, further
  edges—out of the shortest paths that link the genes left—were shown by clicking
  on the ‘Connect Genes’ button at the control panel. This visualization allows pinpointing
  and exploring alternate pathways that connect the initial seeds; for instance, CRX
  and NRL were already connected, but longer paths are now evident like CRX⇌PRKN⇌HNRNPK⇌NRL,
  when PRKN and HNRNPK are linked. Another example can be the pathway found between
  NRL and NR2E3 on the path NRL⇌SMAD4⇌PIAS3⇌NR2E3, when SMAD4 and PIAS3 are linked.
  Both panels from this figure can be reproduced on the Network Explorer if users
  upload the  and , respectively.
