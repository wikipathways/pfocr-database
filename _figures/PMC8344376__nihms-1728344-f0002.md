caption: Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) activation is a dynamic
  process that accompanies cell cycle exit initiated by senescence triggers. A core
  SASP programme comprises mainly proinflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and monocyte
  chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), regulated in an IL-1-dependent manner, and enzymes
  involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, such as matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs), serine/cysteine proteinase inhibitors (SERPINs) and tissue inhibitors of
  metalloproteinases (TIMPs). More recently, additional core SASP effectors released
  as soluble molecules or in exosomes were identified, including GDF15, STC1 and MMP1.
  DNA damage response factors, including the upstream DNA damage response kinase induce
  SASP genes via nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38
  also induces SASP genes by increasing the activity of NF-κB. Activation of several
  transcription factors and chromatin regulators has been implicated in SASP activation
  and regulation. NF-κB the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β
  (C/EBPβ) bind promoters of SASP genes and regulate their activation. GATA4 regulates
  NF-κB and SASP genes indirectly via IL-1 production. The mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) pathway also promotes SASP production through increased translation of subsets
  of mRNAs, including that encoding for IL-1α. In concert with transcription factors,
  the epigenetic reader bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), an acetylated histone-binding
  protein involved in oncogenesis, is recruited to superenhancers adjacent to SASP
  genes, thus contributing to the proper execution of cellular senescence. BRD4 binds
  acetylated histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27), thus competing with Polycomb repressor complex
  2 (PRC2), which methylates the same histone residue (to give trimethylated H3K27)
  for transcriptional repression. Consistent with this, PRC2 inhibits SASP genes in
  senescent cells. More recently, the DNA sensor cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) and
  the adaptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING) have been reported to be major
  regulators of the SASP programme across species and senescence modes, presumably
  by activating NF-κB and interferon response factor IRF3 on recognition of cytosol
  DNA and cytosolic chromatin fragments (CCFs). Aberrant activation of the cGAS–STING
  pathway could be linked to the downregulation of DNases (for example, DNase 2 and
  TREX1), enzymes normally involved in cytoplasmic DNA degradation. ATM, ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated; cGAMP, cyclic GMP–AMP; IL-1R, interleukin-1 receptor.
