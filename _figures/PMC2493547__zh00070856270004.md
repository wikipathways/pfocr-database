caption: Model for exercise-induced transcription of the Pgc-1α gene in skeletal muscle.
  Increased neuromuscular activities elicit signals leading to activation of the p38
  MAPK pathway and transcriptional upregulation of the Pgc-1α gene through ATF2 (,
  ) and MEF2 (, ). Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway can also promote Pgc-1α transcription
  by inhibiting p160 and derepressing PGC-1α protein function (), exerting a positive
  regulation of Pgc-1α gene transcription through MEF2 (, ). In parallel, exercise
  also promotes Pgc-1α transcription through PKD/HDAC5-mediated derepression of MEF2
  function (). These signaling-transcription coupling cascades integrate contractile
  and metabolic cues from neuromuscular activity to control expression of the Pgc-1α
  gene in skeletal muscle adaptation. Regulatory factors/cis elements, the functional
  role of which has been tested and confirmed in the present study, are shown as gray
  boxes with solid lines. Other relevant regulatory factors that were not investigated
  in the present study are shown as open boxes with dashed lines.
