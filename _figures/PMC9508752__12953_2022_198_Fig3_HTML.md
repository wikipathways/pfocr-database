caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and enriched pathways for differentially
  expressed genes after Hypobaric Hypoxia treatment. A Differentially, expressed genes
  due to hypobaric hypoxia. Enriched pathways from the IPA results include cancer,
  immunity and lipid metabolism. B Regulation network obtained from the IPA results.
  C Detail of HMGB1 related pathway in the IPA results. Several immune response-related
  genes, such IL-1R, MAPK and ERK, are involved in the regulation of hypobaric hypoxia
