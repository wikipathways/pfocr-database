caption: Platelet Aggregation Mechanism of ActionThe platelet aggregation pathway
  involves activation of the glycoprotein (Gp) IIb/IIIa receptor, which leads to irreversible
  binding of platelets together. Glanzmann thrombasthenia is caused by a deficiency
  of this receptor, and medications such as abciximab block this receptor. Figure created
  with Biorender.com. ADP = adenosine diphosphate.
