caption: ZnO NPs pathways and effects in kidney cells. ZnO NPs induce apoptosis and
  the HIF-1α signaling pathway through ROS generation, eventually leading to nephrotoxicity.
  Furthermore, ZnO NP-induced autophagy may be mediated by the induction of the HIF-1α
  signaling pathway. Inhibition of HIF-1α by HIF-1α siRNA increases the cytotoxicity,
  indicating a protective role of HIF-1α. In addition, CTGF and PAI-1, which are directly
  regulated by HIF and are related to the renal fibrosis, are increased after ZnO
  NP treatment
