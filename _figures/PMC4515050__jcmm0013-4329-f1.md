caption: 'Processing of APP. APP can be processed by different sets of enzymes: one
  pathway leads to amyloid plaque formation (amyloidogenic), while the other does
  not (non-amyloidogenic). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved first
  by α-secretase to yield a soluble N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal fragment
  integrated within the cellular membrane. The soluble protein may be involved in
  the enhancement of synaptogenesis, neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival, and
  is considered to be neuroprotective. The membrane fragment of the cleaved APP is
  acted upon by γ-secretase, a tetrameric complex comprised presenilins, nicastrin,
  Aph1 and Pen2, to yield a soluble N-terminal fragment (P3) and a membrane-bound
  C-terminal fragment. In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved first by β-secretase,
  yielding a soluble N-terminal fragment and a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment.
  The membrane fragment is then cleaved by γ-secretase, yielding a membrane-bound
  C-terminal fragment and a soluble N-terminal fragment (Aβ). While Aβ is required
  for neuronal function, it can aggregate in the extracellular space of the brain
  to form amyloid plaques.'
