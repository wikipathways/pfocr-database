caption: 'Schematic drawing of the sensory nerve supply of kidneys and upper abdominal
  organs via sympathetic pathways. Solid line: major splanchnic nerve providing sensory
  innervation of the upper abdominal organs, including the liver via the celiac plexus.
  Dotted line: lesser splanchnic nerve providing sensory innervation of the renal
  parenchyma and ureter. Dashed line: least splanchnic nerve providing sensory innervation
  of the renal capsule. The perivascular nerve plexus around the renal artery forms
  the final common pathway to and from the kidney. ST, sympathetic trunk.'
