caption: Functions of p53 in response to DNA damage. Genomic stresses caused by ionizing
  radiation (IR), chemotherapy, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate DNA damage
  check point pathway, which leads to the activation of ATM and CHK2 and subsequent
  stabilization of p53. Then, stabilized p53 induces cell cycle arrest and DNA repair
  when DNA damage is moderate, whereas it activates apoptosis pathway when DNA damage
  is extensive.
