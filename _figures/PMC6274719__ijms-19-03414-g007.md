caption: Schematic depiction of the anti-apoptotic role of the Arg/N-end rule pathway
  via targeted degradation of several pro-apoptotic protein fragments during induction
  of apoptosis in the context of apoptotic cell death signaling. In addition to other
  antiapoptotic pathways, the selective degradation of proapoptotic protein fragments
  via the Arg/N-end rule pathway curbs transient or otherwise unscheduled apoptotic
  signaling from reaching the point of cellular demise. All the indicated pro-apoptotic
  fragments have been described in detail in references 10 and 120.
