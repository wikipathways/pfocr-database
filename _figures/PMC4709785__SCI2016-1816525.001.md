caption: Metabolic regulation of the pluripotent epigenetic landscape. Pluripotent
  stem cells are characterized by spherical, electron-poor mitochondria, which contain
  few cristae. These cells rely heavily on glycolysis for ATP generation (thick black
  arrows), resulting in significant lactate production through the conversion of pyruvate
  to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Consequently, oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) contributes minimally to total ATP. Glucose metabolized by the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) generates the ribose moieties required for DNA and RNA synthesis
  and the NADPH required for the biosynthesis of lipids and other complex molecules.
  Intermediate metabolites generated via metabolic pathways act as cofactors for epigenetic
  modifying enzymes. Threonine and methionine metabolism is required for S-adenosyl
  methionine (SAM) generation via the folate and SAM cycles in mouse and human pluripotent
  stem cells, respectively [, ]. SAM acts as a methyl donor for histone methyltransferases
  (HMT) as well as DNA methyltransferases. Demethylation of SAM yields S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH), which is, in turn, hydrolyzed to homocysteine. Transfer of a methyl group
  to homocysteine from the folate pathway regenerates methionine. Acetyl coenzyme
  A (Acetyl-CoA) acts as a cofactor for histone acetyltransferases (HAT). Acetyl-CoA,
  generated from glucose derived pyruvate, modulates human pluripotent stem cell histone
  acetylation [], although pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activity may limit
  the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA []. Similarly, uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2)
  functions to shunt pyruvate away from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, facilitating
  lactate production []. Acetyl-CoA can also be generated from threonine catabolism
  []. Alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG) [] or supplementation with vitamin C in culture []
  reduces histone and DNA methylation in human pluripotent stem cells, respectively.
  These metabolites modulate histone and DNA demethylation reactions catalyzed by
  Jumonji (JMJ) and Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) demethylases, respectively [].
  The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) is an alternative route of glucose utilization
  that generates the coenzyme UDP-GlcNAc, which together with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine
  transferase (OGT) leads to histone O-GlcNAcylation []. Flux through glycolysis and
  oxidative phosphorylation determines the NAD+ : NADH ratio, known to regulate the
  activity of the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases sirtuins (SIRT; []). In addition,
  a proline-dependent mechanism of epigenetic regulation has been reported in pluripotent
  stem cells []; however, it is unclear how the metabolism of proline interacts with
  these pathways. Metabolic regulators of chromatin-modifying enzymes are highlighted
  in red.
