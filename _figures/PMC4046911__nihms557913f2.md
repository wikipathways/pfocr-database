caption: Bioinformatic network analysis of the tazarotene-treated 10 h DE genes suggested
  that a significant number of the DE genes connected to the PI3K/AKT pathway as a
  central downstream node. The shaded shapes indicated the DE genes (* p < 0.05).
  The different shapes assigned to each molecule that was represented in the 10 h
  DE list, indicate the type/function of the protein as classified by the IPA analysis
  software (Ingenuity®, CA).
