caption: Hypothetical model of HGF/SF activation in cancer. There are two major pathways
  in the activation of HGF/SF in tumor tissue. One is HGFA-mediated pathway that is
  closely linked to activation of the coagulation cascade. Another pathway is TTSPs-mediated
  one, in which matriptase likely has a signiificant role. Cellular Kunitz-type serine
  protease inhibitors, HAI-1 and HAI-2, have crucial roles in the regulation of these
  HGF/SF-activating proteases in tumor tissues.
