caption: Blue circles (and links) denote tsTFs; red circles denote tsFXNGs; the color
  of a gene indicates its level of expression, with green denoting upregulation and
  red denoting downregulation. This tightly connected cluster of genes comprises the
  blood-specific TFs GATA3 and RUNX3 (circled in blue) and 11 genes with immune related
  function (circled in red). GATA3 has been previously linked to RUNX3 [] and implicated
  as a master regulator of the immune system [], required for the maintenance of T
  cells; consistent with this, the set of genes linked to GATA3 to is significantly
  enriched for the T cell receptor signaling pathway and the T cell receptor complex
  (Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni correction p = .0001 and .01, respectively)
  with 8 of the top 10 most enriched functions for these genes relating to the immune
  system.
