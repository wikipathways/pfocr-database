caption: Increased numbers of autophagic vesicles (AVs) are a common finding for many
  neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease
  (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), X-linked spinal & bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA),
  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, different molecular mechanisms
  account for the observed autophagy pathway dysfunction in these neurodegenerative
  disorders. 1) Autophagy signaling pathways are impaired in HD, ALS, and in the aging
  brain, with the mechanistic target of rapamycin (TOR) and insulin/IGF1 signaling
  (IIS) being significantly impacted. 2) Autophagy transcriptional network activity
  decreases in HD, PD, and in the aging brain. Contradictory to these findings, some
  evidence suggests up-regulation of autophagy genes in AD. Alterations in the master
  autophagy regulator transcription factor E-B (TFEB) signaling have been reported
  for PD, HD, and SBMA. 3) Deficits in cargo recognition, particularly of defective
  mitochondria, occur in HD and PD. The accumulation of damaged mitochondria generates
  an increased burden of reactive-oxygen species (ROS), which compromises lysosomal
  function and culminates in lysosomal permeabilization and leakage of lysosomal contents
  into the cytoplasm. Accumulation of ‘empty’ autophagosomes in HD also compromises
  neuronal homeostasis. 4) Despite normal autophagy induction and autophagosome formation,
  impaired maturation and microtubule-transport of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) towards
  lysosomes is a feature of ALS. 5) Lysosomal dysfunction contributes to autophagy
  dysregulation in AD and HD, especially as proteostasis clearance mechanisms decline
  with age. Accumulation of undigested cargo in the lysosomal lumen (e.g. organelles,
  liposfuscin) further impairs the lysosome’s degradative ability, enhancing lysosomal
  membrane destabilization and leakage.
