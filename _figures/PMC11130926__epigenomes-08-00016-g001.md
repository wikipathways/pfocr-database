caption: Bacterial Q de novo and salvage pathways. Q de novo synthesis pathway is
  depicted with enzymes that are shown in red. Indirect and direct q salvage pathways
  are depicted with enzymes that are shown in green and blue, respectively. Possible
  degradation and phosphorylation pathways are shown with dashed arrows. Among the
  four components of ECF transporters, only the substrate-specific transmembrane (S)
  component (QueT/QrtT) is labeled (bold border)
