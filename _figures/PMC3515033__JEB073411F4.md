caption: Neural and humoral activation of the brain by the periphery. Peripheral infections
  alter behavior by communicating with the brain via neural and humoral pathways.
  The neural pathway occurs via afferent nerves. As an example, the vagal nerve has
  a proven role in mediating infection-induced behavior. The afferent vagus projects
  to the nucleus tractus solitaries (NTS) → parabrachial nucleus (PB) → ventrolateral
  medulla (VLM) before proceeding to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
  (PVN), supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SON), central amygdala (CEA) and
  bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). The CEA and BNST, which are part of
  the extended amygdala, then project to the periaqueductal gray (PAG). By these pathways,
  activation of the vagus by abdominal or visceral infections influences activity
  of several brain regions implicated in motivation and mood. The humoral pathway
  involves delivery of PAMPs or cytokines from the peripheral site of infection directly
  to the brain. Active transport into the brain across the blood–brain barrier (BBB),
  volume diffusion into the brain or direct contact with brain parenchymal cells at
  the choroid plexus (CP) and circumventricular organs [median eminence (ME), organum
  vasculosum of the laminae terminalis (OVLT, i.e. supraoptic crest), area postrema
  (AP) and suprafornical organ (SFO)] that lie outside the BBB all transpose the peripheral
  signal into a central neuroinflammatory response that mirrors the response at the
  periphery ().
