caption: 'The mammalian unfolded protein response pathway. The UPR is activated upon
  ER stress caused by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER.
  UPR activation is mediated by three branches: PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase
  (PERK), inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor
  6 (ATF6). PERK and IRE1 are activated by autophosphorylation. Active PERK phosphorylates
  eIF2α, which inhibits overall protein translation, while selectively promoting the
  translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Active IRE1 splices an
  intronic region from XBP1 mRNA (HAC1 in yeast) to form sXBP1, which is translated
  into an active transcription factor. ATF6 is translocated to the Golgi, where it
  is cleaved and further translocated to the nucleus. ATF6, sXBP1, and ATF4 activate
  downstream signaling cascades that increase the expression of genes that function
  in restoring ER homeostasis or inducing cell death under persistent ER stress.'
