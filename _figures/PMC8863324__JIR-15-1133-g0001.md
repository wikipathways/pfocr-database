caption: 'Interaction between autoreactive B-cells and antigen-presenting cells (APC)
  in ILE. Autoantigen (nucleoprotein)-specific B-cells may survive the selection processes
  in bone marrow. These cells are constantly exposed to autoantigens derived from
  either apoptotic cells, necrotic cells, or neutrophil extracellular traps. In genetically
  predisposed individuals, elevated levels of B-cell survival factors (BAFF or April)
  or APC (antigen-presenting cells)-derived type I (or type II) IFN, or abnormal intrinsic
  B-cell receptor signaling involving the Syk/BTK pathway may lead to upregulation
  of nucleic-acid sensing TLR and other innate receptors resulting in B-cell activation.
  In turn, this can lead to activation and maturation of autoreactive B-cells into
  anti-nucleoprotein secreting plasmablasts/plasma cells. Secreted autoantibodies
  can then combine with self-derived nucleoproteins and signal APCs through their
  Fc-γ receptors. Subsequent activation of innate receptors in APCs can trigger robust
  type I and II IFN response, which in turn can further decrease the threshold for
  B-cell activation by up-regulating IFN-inducible genes (“IFN-signature”). Released
  type I and type II IFN can also prime other immune cells and ultimately cause tissue
  inflammation and damage resulting in clinically overt SLE. Adapted fromJ Allergy
  Clin Immunol. 137(5), Singh N, Kumar B, Aluri V, Lenert P. Interfering with baffled
  B cells at the lupus tollway: promises, successes, and failed expectations. 1325–1333.
