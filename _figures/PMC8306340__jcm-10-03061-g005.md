caption: Bulk RNA-Seq analysis reveals both canonical and non-canonical NFĸB pathways
  regulate immune signaling in DSG2Mut hiPSC-CMs. (A) RNA-Seq heatmap analysis and
  (B) KEGG NFĸB pathway schematic. For (A), we identified genes in the NFĸB pathway
  that were differentially expressed between Ctrl1 and DSG2Mut hiPSC-CMs (BH-adjusted
  p-value < 0.05). NFĸB pathway genes were identified using genes associated with
  the gene ontology term “NIK/NF-kappaB signaling” (GO:0038061). Color scale denotes
  row-scaled log expression values. For (B), purple lines and arrows indicate canonical
  NFĸB pathway; green lines and arrows indicate non-canonical NFĸB pathway; red shading
  indicates higher expression in DSG2Mut relative to control, blue indicates lower
  expression, and gray indicates no difference. (C) Schematic demonstrating canonical
  NFĸB signaling through RELA and non-canonical NFĸB signaling through RELB.
