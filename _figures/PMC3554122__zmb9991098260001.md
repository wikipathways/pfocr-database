caption: Summary of checkpoint factors. (a) In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, several checkpoints
  regulate cell cycle progression to ensure that DNA damage or errors made during
  replication or mitosis can be effectively repaired. These checkpoints include the
  replication checkpoint, intra-S-phase checkpoint, DNA damage checkpoints, and mitotic
  checkpoint. Each utilizes several pathways to signal and activate cell cycle arrest.
  (b) In stationary-phase G0 cells, only a subset of the checkpoint proteins have
  roles in maintaining DNA stability. Genes overlaid with an X are not active in G0
  in the indicated pathway. Genes shown in bold exhibit the strongest phenotype. Question
  marks designate speculative interactions or pathways. The pathway denoted in gray
  dotted lines represents a Rad9p-dependent backup pathway that is activated when
  Mrc1p function is compromised.
