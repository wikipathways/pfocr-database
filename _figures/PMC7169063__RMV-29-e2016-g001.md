caption: 'IFN production pathway and different ways that the virus disrupts this pathway.
  Downregulation: long line with a small line at the end; scissor shape: cleavage
  by protease; IF production pathway activation was indicated in two ways. Left: Activation
  of pathway was indicated when ssRNA or dsRNA are in the cytoplasm, in which case
  two adaptors (RIG1 and MDA5) recognize them, resulting in activation of IPS1 (MAVS,
  VISA, or cardif). IPS activates two other adaptors (IKK and TBK1) leading to phosphorylation
  of IRF3 and IRF7. Translocation of these adaptors to the nucleus causes ISRE promoter
  activation and IFN production. 2A protease has inhibitory effects in this pathway
  with cleavage of MDA5 and IPS1, but 3C protease downregulates RIG1 through interaction.
  Right: Activation of pathway is observed when ssRNA or dsRNA are in the endosome.
  In this situation, TLR3 and TLR7/8 are responsible for RNA recognition, resulting
  in the activation of two adaptors (TRIF and MYD88). TRIF activates other adaptors
  such as TRAF3, IKK, and TBK1 giving rise to the activation of IRF7 and IRF3, where
  translocation of these proteins to the nucleus causes IFN production. MYD88 also
  activates some other adaptors including IRAK1, IRAK4, and TRAF6 leading to phosphorylation
  and activation of IRF7 and translocation to the nucleus. As can be seen, 3C protease
  affects this pathway by cleaving IRF7 and preventing its translocation to the nucleus'
