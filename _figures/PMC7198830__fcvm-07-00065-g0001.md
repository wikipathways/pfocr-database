caption: Direct cardiotoxic effects of anti-cancer therapies in cardiomyocytes. Doxorubicin
  cardiomyocyte cytotoxicity through diverse pathways including DNA damage, accumulation
  of ROS and RNS, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis and impaired autophagy. Inhibition
  of ErbB2/4 receptor complex with trastuzumab impacts several signaling pathways
  resulting in impaired protein synthesis and myocardial structure via the Src/Fak
  pathway (). Trastuzumab mediated supression of ErbB2/4 stimulated PI3K-Akt signaling
  impacts cell survival via mTOR pathway as well as increases apoptosis via BAD/BcL-xL
  pathway (). Chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidines, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cause
  increase in formation of ROS and RNS leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and activation
  of caspase-3 and apoptosis (). Radiotherapy leads to ROS and RNS formation, mitochondrial
  dysfunction and single-stranded DNA breaks leading to apoptosis activation ().
