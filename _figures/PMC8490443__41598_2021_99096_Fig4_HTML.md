caption: 'Proposed molecular interactions by which BMP7 attenuates the fibrocartilage
  chondrocyte phenotype. The potential molecular pathway by which BMP7 attenuates
  the fibrocartilage chondrocyte phenotype as proposed in this study. Upon BMP7 exposure,
  chondrocytic cells demonstrate reduced SMAD3 signaling, interfering with PAI1 expression
  and activity. In addition, following BMP7 exposure, MMP2 expression and activity
  is increased via PAI1 and MT1-MMP, resulting in a reduced fibrocartilage chondrocyte
  phenotype. BMP7’s mode of action to reduce chondrocyte fibrosis is MMP2-dependent.
  Dashed lines: interactions which have been found in organ-fibrosis (with corresponding
  references), but have not been demonstrated directly in the present study. Solid
  lines: interactions directly demonstrated in the present study (regarding chondrocyte
  fibrosis).'
