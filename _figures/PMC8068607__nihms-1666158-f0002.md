caption: Developmental signaling factors for adult heart regeneration. Manipulation
  of thyroid hormone signaling, substrate availability and utilization, and oxygen
  levels (hypoxia) influence cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration by
  mainly targeting cellular metabolism. Attenuation of oxidative metabolism leads
  to a reduction in reactive oxygen species and subsequent oxidative DNA damage, one
  of the main mechanisms in postnatal cell cycle arrest. Reactivation of the active
  form of YAP (Hippo pathway) reprograms chromatin acessibility to enhance cell cycle
  regulators, while blunting Meis1 or alteration in miRNAs levels can directly upregulate
  cell cycle genes or downregulate cell cycle inhibitors and cardiomyocyte proliferation.
  Reintroduction of Lamin B2 enhances nuclear division decreasing ploidy levels, a
  known contributor in postnatal cell cycle arrest.
