caption: Several environments can lead to increased GDF-15 expression including increased
  blood glucose and reactive oxygen species, which are both common in pre-diabetes
  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. To combat these, GDF-15 activates the JAK/STAT6 pathway,
  promoting the shift in M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages to M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages.
  This shift helps to increase insulin sensitivity, while GDF-15 activation of PI3K/Akt
  pathway additionally acts to decrease apoptosis.
