caption: Hypothetic model on how the pro-inflammatory CNF1 activity can be connected
  to cancer. CNF1-dependent Rho activation stimulates NF-κB nuclear translocation
  and trans-activation, through the classical Akt/IKK-mediated pathway. NF-κB induces
  the transcription of genes coding for proteins involved in inflammation and apoptosis,
  that is the pro-inflammatory molecules IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and Cox-2, and anti-apoptotic
  factors, such as Bcl-2. This last also causes elongation and enrichment of the mitochondrial
  network, an aspect somehow linked to transformation. On the other hand, by mean
  of its activity on the actin cytoskeleton organization, CNF1 is able to provoke
  cell junctions disruption and to strongly enhance cellular motility, a phenomenon
  strictly linked to invasiveness and metastasis.
