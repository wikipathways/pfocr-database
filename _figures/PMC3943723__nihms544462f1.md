caption: Depiction of glucose entry into a cell and, subsequently, the hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP). The four reactions and enzymes of the HBP are indicated
  along with corresponding inhibitors (red). The formation of UDP-GlcNAc, the donor
  for the O-GlcNAc modification, is the final product of the HBP. O-GlcNAc can be
  added to protein substrates via OGT. Conversely, OGA functions to remove this moiety.
  Inhibitors are highlighted in red and juxtaposed with their targets.
