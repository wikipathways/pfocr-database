caption: 'An overall scheme illustrating p75NTR signaling.Notes: Heterodimerization
  with TrkB in response to BDNF action causes phosphorylation of IκB resulting in
  liberating of NF-κB, which after translocation into the nucleus promotes gene transcription
  to support neuron survival. Oppositely, heterodimerization with sortilin in response
  to pro-BDNF induces activation of Jun-kinase signaling pathway resulting in activation
  of proapoptotic genes and caspases causing cell death. Signaling molecule ceramide
  takes part in both NF-κB and Jun-kinases signaling cascades.Abbreviations: BDNF,
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor; p75NTR, p75 neurotrophin receptor; TrkB, tropomyosin
  related kinase B; NRIF, neurotrophin receptor-interacting factor; NRAGE, p75NTR
  interacting protein; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; Cdc42,
  cell division control protein 42; ASK1, apoptosis signal regulated kinase 1; JNK,
  c-Jun N-terminal kinase; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase; aPKC, atypical
  protein kinase C; IκB, kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; MKK7, mitogen-activated
