caption: Glycolytic inhibition via 2‐deoxy‐d‐glucose (2‐DG) and fructose‐1,6‐diphosphate
  (FDP), both of which decrease glycolytic flux, reduce cell energy production, and
  produce antiseizure effects. Glucose (Gluc) and 2‐DG enter the cytoplasm via glucose
  transporters (GLUT3 in neurons or GLUT1 in glia). During glycolysis, glucose is
  first phosphorylated to glucose‐6‐phosphate (G‐6‐P), which is then converted into
  fructose‐6‐phosphate (F‐6‐P). F‐6‐P is converted into fructose‐1,6‐diphosphate (FDP)
  and ultimately to pyruvate via multiple steps. Pyruvate is the final product of
  glycolysis; it enters mitochondria to participate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle for oxidative ATP production. G‐6‐P also enters the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP), generating reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and
  glutathione (GSH), which attenuates cell damage caused by reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). In addition, GSH may have antiseizure properties. Once inside the cell, 2‐DG
  is phosphorylated to 2‐DG‐6‐P, which cannot be further metabolized. By inhibiting
  phosphoglucose isomerase, 2‐DG limits the conversion of G‐6‐P to F‐6‐P, which is
  the main mechanism of glycolytic inhibition by 2‐DG. The chemical structures of
  glucose and 2‐DG are indicated at the top of the figure.
