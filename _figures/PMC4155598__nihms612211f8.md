caption: Combined inhibition of PI3K and Akt (indicated by the dashed bracket) is
  synergistic only in resistant models that maintain PIP3 and phosphorylation of Akt
  substrates (453R, T47DR). Combined inhibition of PI3K and mTOR or PI3K and CDK 4/6
  (indicated by the solid brackets) is synergistic in all resistant models; including
  those that maintain PIP3 and phosphorylation of Akt substrates (453R, T47DR) and
  those that do not (MCF7R). * indicates that some resistant models maintain low level
  flux through the PI3K and Akt pathways.
