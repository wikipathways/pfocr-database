caption: Sorting and transport within the biosynthetic and endo-lysosomal pathways.
  a Schematic representation of the interplay between the biosynthetic pathway and
  endo-lysosomal system depicting the main endosomal compartments that are discussed
  in the text. b Detailed overview of the various sorting steps at the early endosome.
  At the endosomal vacuole or sorting endosome, receptor–ligand complexes destined
  for degradation accumulate in the bilayered clathrin coat (1), upon which they are
  sorted into intraluminal vesicles (ILV) that form by inward budding of the vacuolar
  limiting membrane. Recycling cargo by default enters the membrane tubules of the
  tubular sorting endosome (2) from which it can recycle back to the plasma membrane
  via the recycling endosome, or is actively sorted towards late endosomes/lysosomes
  (AP-3 pathway for lysosomal membrane proteins) or TGN (AP-1 pathway). A third exit
  from the vacuolar endosome is provided by the endosome-to-TGN carriers (3) that
  mediate SNX1-dependent recycling of MPRs and sortilin to the TGN. c From the TGN,
  multiple pathways arise that mediate transport to the endo-lysosomal system and
  plasma membrane. It is still an open question to what extent these pathways use
  different or overlapping molecular machinery and transport carriers. AP adaptor
