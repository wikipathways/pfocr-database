caption: Summary figure. a Gene expressions and pathways are suppressed in both untreated
  AR1 and AR11 morphotypes. Important biological functions affected by the suppressed
  gene expressions are shown. b Important outcomes of β1-integrin-inhibited treatment
  (left panel), Src-inhibited treatment (middle panel), and Src-overexpressed treatment
  (right panel) on different morphotypes. Please note the almost identical reaction
  of cells in response to β1-integrin and Src kinase inhibition. Inhibition of this
  pathway abolishes shape-dependent gene expression, while Src kinase activation preserves
  this effect. These both suggest an important role of this pathway in morphotype-specific
  control of the mRNA transcriptome
