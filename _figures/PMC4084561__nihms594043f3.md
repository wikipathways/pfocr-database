caption: 'Various receptor pathways cross-regulate the type I interferon (IFN) response;
  this alters the expression levels and activation states of IFN signalling components.
  Various mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activating pathways, such as those
  induced by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), enhance signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 1 (STAT1) transcriptional activity through phosphorylation of a
  conserved carboxy-terminal serine. Low-level basal signalling by immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing receptors also augments Janus
  kinase 1 (JAK1) activity through activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and
  protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2). Conversely, strong activation of ITAM-containing
  receptors by high-avidity crosslinking suppresses IFNα receptor (IFNAR) signalling
  via protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated recruitment of SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine
  phosphatase 2 (SHP2), which dephosphorylates signalling intermediates. Cytokine
  signalling pathways, including the interleukin-1 (IL-1) pathway, inhibit type I
  IFN responses by directly promoting IFN receptor turnover via p38 kinase and casein
  kinase II (CK2). Various cytokines that signal through JAK–STAT pathways, including
  type I IFNs, regulate the expression levels of both positive and negative regulators
  of the IFN response pathways. JAK–STAT-induced positive regulators include STAT1
  and IFN-regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), whereas negative regulators include the suppressor
  of cytokine signalling (SOCS) protein family and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase
  18 (USP18). Inhibitor of NF-κB kinase-ε (IKKε)-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation inhibits
  STAT1 homodimerization, thereby promoting activation of the IFN-stimulated gene
  factor 3 (ISGF3) complex rather than STAT1 homodimers in response to type I IFN.
  IKKε expression is induced by various pathways, including tumour necrosis factor
  (TNF)- and PRR-induced pathways. MicroRNAs induced by cytokine and PRR pathways
  downregulate the expression of IFN response signalling proteins: for example, miR-146a
  suppresses STAT1 expression, and miR-155 causes a collective reduction in various
  IFN signalling proteins. AGO2, Argonaute 2; RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex.'
