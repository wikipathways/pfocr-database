caption: (A) According to the inside-outside model, cells on the inside and outside
  of the embryo receive different amounts of cell contact, and this is translated
  into differences in transcription factor expression. (B) According to the cell polarity
  model, the presence or absence of an apical domain is translated into differences
  in transcription factor expression. (C) After the eight-cell stage, active Lats1/2
  kinases phosphorylate Yap in inside cells, preventing its movement into the nucleus.
  Without Yap, Tead4 cannot induce the expression of Cdx2. In outside cells, Lat1
  and Lat2 are inactive and Yap is free to move into the nucleus, activating Cdx2.
  Increased cell-cell contact on the inside of the embryo may activate Lat1 and Lat2
  via the Hippo signaling pathway, while some component of the apical domain may inhibit
  Hippo signaling and Lat1 and Lat2 activity in outside cells.
