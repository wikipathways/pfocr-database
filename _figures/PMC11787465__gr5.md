caption: Functional roles of miR-23 in organ development. This diagram illustrates
  the diverse functional roles of miR-23 in regulating various biological processes
  during organ development. Each circle represents the interaction genes and related
  pathways of miR-23 in different organs, which are displayed in yellow, red, green,
  purple, and blue for uterus, heart, skeleton, tooth, and pituitary tissues. The
  research on miR-23 in the skeleton is the most extensive among all the organs shown
  in the figure. This figure was drawn by Figdraw (https://www.figdraw.com)
