caption: 'Partial anti-inflammatory properties of exosomes after MI or IR. Note: Exosomes
  produced by M2 macrophages (M2-exo) carrying miR-148a down-regulate thioredoxin-interaction
  protein (TXNIP) to reduce MI or I/R damage. In addition, M2-exo can carry miR-1271-5P
  to negatively regulate SOX6 expression and inhibit myocardial apoptosis. Mesenchymal
  stem cells derived exosomes (MSCs-exo) promote M2 polarization of macrophages and
  improve myocardial injury after myocardial infarction by activating the S1P/SK1/S1PR1
  signaling pathway. Exosomes from Ang II-treated atrial myocytes promote the polarization
  of M2 macrophages by delivering miR-23a. In contrast, M1-Exo overexpressed inflammatory
  miR-155, aggravating the myocardial injury.'
