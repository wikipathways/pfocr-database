caption: 'Schematic drawing of metabolic routes possibly involved in lactate utilization
  in C. albicans. The figure shows the lactate transporters JEN1 and JEN2, the l-lactate
  dehydrogenase CYB2, the pyruvate decarboxylase pathway or “pyruvate dehydrogenase
  bypass” (highlighted with thick arrows), the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the glyoxylate
  bypass. Other abbreviations: PDC, pyruvate decarboxylase; PYC, pyruvate carboxylase;
  PDA/B, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; ALD, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase; ACS, acetyl-CoA
  synthase; YAT, carnitine acetyltransferase; ICL, isocitrate lyase; MLS, malate synthase;
  MDH, malate dehydrogenase. For details see text.'
