caption: The schematic diagram depicts the EGFR signaling pathway. Genes listed in
  red were sequenced only in genomic DNAs from 217 tumors (“Group 1”). Genes listed
  in blue were sequenced only in WGA-treated DNA tumor samples (“Group 2”). Genes
  in black were sequenced in both groups. Gene nomenclature is as reported in GenBank
  as of December 2006. See Supplemental  for clinical characteristics of all tumors
  sequenced.
