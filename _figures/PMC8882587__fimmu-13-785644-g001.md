caption: Microbiota modulates the gut–brain axis through its secretions, including
  microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and microbial metabolites. As
  the intestinal permeability decreased due to the microbial molecules, these molecules
  were involved in generalized gut–brain signaling, such as the immune-modulating
  pathway, endocrine signaling pathway, the neural signaling pathway, and the neuroendocrine
  signaling pathway. Neurotransmitter-like substances such as gamma-aminobutyric acid
  (GABA) directly influence the central nervous system (CNS) through nerve pathways;
  other gut-derived substances such as MAMPs and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) influence
  the CNS by decreasing blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Furthermore, these
  microbial molecules activate immune resident cells or neuron cells, which accelerate
  neurodegenerative disease (ND) physiopathology.
