caption: Schematic summary of the Wnt signaling derangements and the different traits
  of metabolic syndrome. The canonical Wnt pathway is activated when Wnt ligand binds
  to the Frizzeled (FZD) receptor and the LRP6 co-receptor, this in turn activates
  LDL uptake through Clathrin mediated endocytosis. Canonical Wnt also activates TCF7L2
  transcription factor that inhibits LDL and triglyceride (TG) synthesis and excretion.
  In addition, TCF7L2 leads to increased glucose uptake via the insulin receptor (IR)
  and inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, and inhibition
  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via inhibiting hepatic insulin growth
  factor (IGF) expression. Activation of the canonical Wnt pathway reduces NAFLD and
  hepatic fibrosis also via inhibition of TGF-β. Interestingly the canonical and non-canonical
  Wnt pathways reciprocally inhibit each other. Non-canonical Wnt is activated via
  binding of Wnt ligand to the FZD receptor and RYK/ROR co-receptor.
