caption: Construction of the FB-iPSC-CM regulatory circuit. (a) Schematic of pluripotent
  reprogramming and TD for FB-iPSC-CM system, showing that FBs can be induced either
  to reprogram into pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and later differentiate into CMs,
  or to transdifferentiate into CMs through a direct or indirect pathway. (b) The
  gene regulatory model circuit in this work, constructed based on the IPA (@Ingenuity)
  database. (Online version in colour.)
