caption: A pathway to activate the iNOS gene and the action of FRLFE are schematically
  depicted. The bold arrows indicate the decreases caused by FRLFE in this study.
  The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β binds to its receptor (type I IL-1 receptor,
  IL1R1) to activate NF-κB through the IκB kinase (IKK) signaling pathway , . Activated
  IKK phosphorylates IκB-α, resulting in the degradation of IκB-α. A circled P denotes
  protein phosphorylation. Active NF-κB enters into the nucleus, binds to the iNOS
  gene promoter (κB sites), and activates transcription. FRLFE inhibits the phosphorylation
  of IκB-α and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, resulting in a decrease in the
  nuclear levels of NF-κB. Because NF-κB also regulates the transcription of the iNOS
  asRNA, FRLFE reduces the level of iNOS asRNA, which interacts with and stabilizes
  the iNOS mRNA . Furthermore, FRLFE may interfere with the iNOS mRNA–asRNA interaction
  at a posttranscriptional level. Therefore, FRLFE significantly decreases the level
  of iNOS mRNA.
