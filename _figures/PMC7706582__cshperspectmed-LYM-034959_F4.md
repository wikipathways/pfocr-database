caption: 'Frequent mutations during B-cell development. In the bone marrow, rearrangements
  of the immunoglobulin genes of B-cell precursors to form a B-cell receptor (BCR)
  generate DNA breaks that are occasionally resolved aberrantly, leading to chromosomal
  translocations (). These are the most common genetic alterations in B-precursor
  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) (). The most frequent mature B-cell neoplasms
  that have their origin outside the germinal center (GC) are B-cell chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia (B-CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and
  mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. B-CLL and MCL differ in their
  molecular pathways, genomic alterations, and clinical behavior, being more aggressive
  in naive-like- than memory-like-derived tumors. The pathogenesis of the two malignancies
  involves the BCR signaling, tumor cell microenvironment interactions, genomic alterations,
  and epigenome modifications (; ). MALT lymphoma is the commonest MZL type and presents
  recurrent chromosomal translocations, which usually lead to activation of the NF-κB
  pathway. Nodal and splenic MZLs share recurrent mutations affecting the Notch pathway
  and the transcription factor KLF2, but differ for the inactivation of two tumor-suppressor
  genes, detected exclusively (PTPRD) or much more commonly (KMT2D/MLL2) in the nodal
  type (; ). The presence of immunoglobulin mutations is evidence that the cell of
  origin of the tumor passed through the GC microenvironment. Follicular lymphomas,
  Burkitt lymphomas, and DLBCLs express GC B cell signature genes. In the GC, two
  molecular processes remodel DNA: immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR)
  and somatic hypermutation (SHM), mechanisms that predispose to chromosomal translocations
  and mutations (). DLBCL is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease and
  accounts for 35% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Based on transcriptional profiles, DLBCL
  is further classified into activated B-cell (ABC) and germinal center B-cell (GCB)
  subtypes (; ). ABC-DLBCLs derive from B cells that are committed to plasmablastic
  differentiation (). These tumors have increased NF-κB activity, genetic alterations
  in NF-κB modifiers and components of the BCR pathway, and perturbed terminal B-cell
  differentiation (; ). GCB-DLBCLs originate from light-zone GC B cells (; ). These
  tumors have frequent alterations in chromatin-modifying enzymes, PI3 K signaling,
  and genetic alterations of BCL2 (; ). Modifications in these pathways could favor
  epigenetic reprogramming and escape from cellular immunity. Recent genomic profiles
  have identified sub-ABC and GCB-DLBCL clusters: C1-C5 in one study (of which two
  are GCB-, two are ABC-subtypes, and the fifth is mostly characterized by genomic
  instability and TP53 mutations) (), BN2, MCD, N1 (mostly ABC), and EZB (mostly GCB)
  in a different study (). Follicular lymphoma (FL) is characterized by a unique histology
  in which tumor B cells form follicle-like structures with large numbers of nonmalignant
  immune cells infiltrating within the follicular and interfollicular regions ().
  The most frequent genetic event is the t(14;18) translocation that places BCL2 under
  control of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer, which occurs in 90% of FL patients.
  Mutations in epigenetic modifiers (KMT2D, CREBBP, and EZH2) are also a hallmark
  of FL (). These mutations result in altering normal B-cell differentiation programs
  and impeding GC exit (). Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by deregulation of the
  MYC gene through its translocation to one of the immunoglobulin loci (). LPL, lymphoplasmacytic
