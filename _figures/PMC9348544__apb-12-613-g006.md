caption: Previous studies showed that the aberrant activation of the PI3K signaling
  pathway in most of the hematologic malignant cells is associated with the maintenance
  of leukemic cells survival and proliferation. ,  Accordingly, it has been widely
  shown that when this axis is blocked in leukemic cells, the ability of the cells
  to survive and proliferate would be diminished significantly. -  However, despite
  a favorable anti-leukemic effect, one reason that restricts the application of the
  PI3K inhibitors in human leukemia is due to their short-term response given to the
  acquisition of resistance. BKM120, a well-known pan-PI3K inhibitor, has shown to
  have promising anti-leukemic effects in a wide range of hematologic malignant cell
  lines. -  The results of the previous study indicated that as compared to acute
  myeloid leukemia cell lines, the survival of pre-B ALL-derived Nalm-6 cells reduced
  at the higher concentrations of the inhibitor. Several mechanisms have been proposed
  for this differential response; however, the precise mechanism responsible for this
  phenomenon has not yet been elucidated. To the best of our knowledge, no study has
  addressed the effect of apoptin overexpression on the anti-leukemic properties of
  BKM120 and we reported for the first time that apoptin overexpression in Nalm-6
  cells could remarkably robust the anti-tumor activity of BKM120, while reduced its
  concentrations (). This finding, which was further confirmed in another cell line,
  suggested that probably the overexpression of apoptosis-related genes could be a
  probable mechanism through which the resistance to PI3K inhibitors could be bypassed.
  Moreover, we found that through overexpression of apoptin, the ability of the lower
  concentration of BKM120 (2 µM) was significantly increased to halt the transition
  of the cells from Sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle, at least partly, through up-regulation
  of Bax.
