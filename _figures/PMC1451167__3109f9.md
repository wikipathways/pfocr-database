caption: Model of interactions among Sse1, Sch9, and the PKA pathway. Adenylate cyclase
  (Cyr1) regulates PKA activity via the regulatory subunit Bcy1 through production
  of cAMP. The three catalytic subunits of PKA both positively and negatively regulate
  downstream targets by phosphorylation. The Sch9 kinase likely contributes additively
  to regulation of shared targets. Sch9 may also negatively regulate PKA pathway function
  by an unknown mechanism, as shown by the dashed line. In addition, Sse1 may act
  as a negative regulator of PKA catalytic activity in a Bcy1-independent manner.
  Simultaneous loss of Sse1 and Sch9 could therefore lead to hyperactivation of one
  or more Tpk subunits, while loss of Sse1 alone would result in only moderate PKA
  activation.
