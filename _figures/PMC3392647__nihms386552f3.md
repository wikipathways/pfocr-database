caption: As glucose enters the glycolytic pathway, a minor portion is branched to
  hexosamine biosynthetic pathway to produce GlcNAc which can be used as substrate
  for histone GlcNAcylation by OGT. Flux through glycolysis determines the NAD+/NADH
  ratio which is important for the activities of sirtuin histone deacetylases. Several
  TCA cycle intermediate can be exported out of mitochondria including citrate and
  αKG. Cytosolic citrate is converted to acetyl-CoA which is used as a donor for HAT-mediated
  histone acetylation. αKG is used as co-factors for histone and DNA demethylation
  reactions by JHDM and TET, respectively. The substrate for HMT and DNMT is SAM which
  is synthesized from essential amino acid methionine. Finally, a low ATP/AMP ratio
  can activate AMPK, a kinase that phosphorylates histones.
