caption: TR-dependent regulation of genes in the Wnt signaling pathway, a representative
  pathway likely involved in the development of adult intestinal stem cells, as revealed
  by RNA-seq analysis. Up- and down-regulated genes in the intestine at stage 61 compared
  to stage 54 in each genotype are shown in red and green, respectively (color keys,
  log2 fold change). Note that many more genes were upregulated (red) at stage 61
  in the wild-type tadpoles (Top) compared to TRDKO animals, and the reverse was true
  for down-regulated genes (green). Two blue arrows point to dvl genes, which are
  known as the hub of Wnt signaling critical for relaying Wnt signal from receptors
  to downstream effectors [] that were upregulated at stage 61 in the wild-type animals
  (dvl2 and dvl3), but downregulated at stage 61 in the TRDKO animals (dvl1).
