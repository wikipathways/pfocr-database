caption: The anti‐tumour effect of TNFα and IFNγ alone and in combination. The soluble
  homotrimeric TNFα released by metalloprotease bind to death receptor TNFR1 and immune
  system receptor TNFR2,which can activate 3 signalling cascades including NF‐κB,
  MAPK and death signalling. The tumour‐homing TNFα has significant anti‐tumour effect.
  NGR‐TNF can enhance TNFα delivery and immunotherapeutic effect without influencing
  the biological effect of TNFα in vivo. At the same time, it can also synergize with
  chemotherapeutic drug. Another peptide RGD can also recognize the tumour blood vessel
  and RGD‐TNFα has synergistic anti‐tumour effect with chemotherapeutic drug. Besides,
  TCP‐1/TNFα increased the absorption of drug and immune response in tumours. The
  2 receptors IFNGR1/IFNGR2 of IFNγ can activate JAK‐STAT pathway to regulate cell
  apoptosis. Study indicated that IFNγ could reduce the mouse‐VEGF and promote monocytes/macrophages
  infiltrating and chemokine/cytokine secretion to inhibit tumour growth. IFNγ‐NGR
  could target IFNγ to tumour vessels. Combination of IFNγ‐NGR with IDO inhibitors
  could overcome resistance of IFNγ‐NGR caused by excessive stimulation of tryptophan
  catabolism. The pPB‐HSA‐IFNγ also successfully activated IFNγ‐signalling, inhibited
  the activation and migration of fibroblasts and hampered fibroblasts‐induced tube
  formation of endothelial cells. TNFα combined with IFNγ has been shown to have synergic
  anti‐tumour effect via various pathways. Lately, targeted delivery of TCP‐1/TNFα
  and TCP‐1/IFNγ to tumour blood vessel has been demonstrated to significantly inhibit
  orthotopic colorectal tumour growth without significant systematic toxicity
