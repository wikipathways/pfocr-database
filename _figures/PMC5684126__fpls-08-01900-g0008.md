  mutant accumulates lignin earlier than that of the WT. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia
  lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA

  ferulate-5-hydroxylase. Gene expression was scaled using the Z-score of FPKM (mean
  value of three biological replicates) in the heatmap. For each heatmap, the key
  is located at right side with FPKM values increasing from blue to red.
