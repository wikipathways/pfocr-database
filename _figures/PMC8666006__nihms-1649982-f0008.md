caption: MutLα (MLH1-PMS2) properly terminates Exo1-catalyzed end resection, which
  facilitates DSB repair by HR (left). However, depleting MLH1 deprives cells of MutLα,
  allowing Exo1 to conduct uncontrolled excision. This hyper-resection generates a
  large quantity of ssDNA that exhausts the RPA pool, leaving ssDNA chain unprotected.
  The unprotected ssDNA can be digested or nicked by various nucleases in the nucleus,
  which leads to abnormal recombination intermediates and chromosome breaks. The latter
  can trigger cells to degrade a part or all of the damaged chromosome to release
  nuclear DNA into the cytoplasm, activating the cGAS-STING pathway and the downstream
  immune responses. Together with the large number of neoantigens generated from mutations
  caused by MLH1 deficiency, the immune signaling activated by Exo1 hyper-resection
  facilitates immunotherapy.
