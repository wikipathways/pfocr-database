caption: 'A) Schematic representation of the upstream components that activate the
  core module of the Hippo pathway, composed by the kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2. The
  “Hippo ON” state results in YAP/TAZ phosphorylation with ensuing proteasomal degradation
  and/or cytoplasmic sequestration (left panel). In the “Hippo OFF” state YAP/TAZ
  are set free of inhibitory phosphorylations; in presence of other YAP/TAZ inducing/permissive
  extrinsic or intrinsic signals, YAP/TAZ activity is unleashed (right panel). B)
  YAP/TAZ - Wnt signaling interplay. The destruction complex is a multiprotein machinery
  at the core of the canonical Wnt pathway, controlling the intracellular levels of
  β-catenin. In the “Wnt OFF” state, YAP/TAZ associate with Axin to be incorporated
  in the destruction complex together with β-catenin. As such, the complex restrains
  both β-catenin and YAP/TAZ activity regulating their sequestration and/or degradation
  in the cytoplasm (left panel). In the presence of a “Wnt ON” state, the destruction
  complex is inhibited as Axin and GSK3 bind to the Wnt receptors LRP5/6 being internalized
  into MVBs. The disassembly of the complex by Wnt ligands abolishes both β-catenin
  and YAP/TAZ cytosolic inhibition, triggering their nuclear accumulation with consequent
  activation of transcriptional responses (right panel). The role of the destruction
  complex as checkpoint coordinating YAP/TAZ activity has been further corroborated
  by recent reports, including the findings that: i) SCD1 activity promotes the secretion
  of active (i.e., lipid-modified) Wnt ligands, leading to YAP/TAZ activation; ii)
  cytosolic TIAM1 is incorporated in the destruction complex to promote β-TrCP-dependent
  YAP/TAZ degradation and sequestration; iii) the actin regulator WIP stabilizes YAP/TAZ
  proteins by inhibiting the destruction complex into MVBs; iv) the tumor suppressor
  PKCζ associates with the destruction complex to inhibit YAP nuclear localization.
