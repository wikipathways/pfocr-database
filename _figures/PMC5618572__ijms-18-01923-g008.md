caption: Carotenoids metabolic pathway in tepals of Chinese narcissus and gene expression
  changes during tepal pigmentation process. The pathway is divided into three sub-pathways
  based on the functions of unigenes. The additive expression changes of unigenes
  at different tepal pigmentation stages (T2, T3, T4 and T5) are shown by color grids
  based on RPKM value. The presumed critical genes DXS, MCT, PSY, and CCD1/CCD4 in
  the pathway are marked with blue color. Black filled arrows indicate the substance
  metabolism directions; red filled arrows indicate two dominant flux of carotenoids
  metabolic pathway in tepals. Enzymes marked with sunlight indicate their catalytic
  activities can be influenced by light.
