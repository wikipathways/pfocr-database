caption: 'Hepatic phospholipid biosynthesis pathways. DAG is converted into PA by
  DGK. TG formation is catalyzed by DGAT. Phosphatidylethanolamine is synthesized
  under the action of EtnK and phospholipids are produced through the activity of
  ChoK and CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CPT). PL forms phosphatidylserine
  under the catalysis of PSS1, which in turn is converted into phosphatidylethanolamine
  by PSD. Additionally, phosphatidylethanolamine can be converted back into PL via
  PEMT. DAG, diacylglycerol; PA, phosphatidic acid; DGK, DAG kinase; TG, triglyceride;
