caption: RAGE signaling in epithelial cells. (1) AGE activation of RAGE in kidney
  epithelial cells increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), induces the activation
  of NF-κB, and promotes the release of HMGB1. ROS in association with NF-κB-induced
  cytokines and increased RAGE expression promote inflammation. (2) Metformin, in
  addition to being a hypoglycemic agent, prevents RAGE signaling by inhibiting the
  formation of α-dicarbonyl AGE and activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α,
  which increases the production of NAD and the antioxidant, thioredoxin. NAD promotes
  the activity of sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and deacetylates/inactivates the NF-κB subunit
  p65. (3) RAGE and the Ang II type I receptor (AT1R) activate MAPK (e.g., ERK/p38
  MAPK) and SMAD2/3, which promote the production of TGF-β1, type I collagen, and
  α-smooth muscle actin (SMA). (4) TGF-β1 induces SMAD2/3 and their downstream responses
  in a DIAPH1-dependent manner. (5) DIAPH1 is directly activated by the cytoplasmic
  tail of RAGE. RAGE-induced DIAPH1 functions in kidney epithelial cells are not fully
  known. (6) Type I collagen deposition promotes fibrosis. (7) HMGB1 promotes the
  production of TGF-β1 and α-SMA in a RAGE dependent manner. Increased production
  of α-SMA promotes epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT).

  description: RAGE signaling in epithelial cells. (1) AGE activation of RAGE in kidney
    epithelial cells increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), induces the activation
    of NF-κB, and promotes the release of HMGB1. ROS in association with NF-κB-induced
    cytokines and increased RAGE expression promote inflammation. (2) Metformin, in

    the formation of α-dicarbonyl AGE and activating AMP-activated protein kinase
    (AMPK)-α, which increases the production of NAD and the antioxidant, thioredoxin.
    NAD promotes the activity of sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and deacetylates/inactivates the
    NF-κB subunit p65. (3) RAGE and the Ang II type I receptor (AT1R) activate MAPK
    (e.g., ERK/p38 MAPK) and SMAD2/3, which promote the production of TGF-β1, type
    I collagen, and α-smooth muscle actin (SMA). (4) TGF-β1 induces SMAD2/3 and their
    downstream responses in a DIAPH1-dependent manner. (5) DIAPH1 is directly activated
    by the cytoplasmic tail of RAGE. RAGE-induced DIAPH1 functions in kidney epithelial
    cells are not fully known. (6) Type I collagen deposition promotes fibrosis. (7)
    HMGB1 promotes the production of TGF-β1 and α-SMA in a RAGE dependent manner.
    Increased production of α-SMA promotes epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT).
