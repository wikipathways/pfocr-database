caption: Pathways of trehalose synthesis are highlighted in black, and pathways of
  degradation in grey. Major conserved enzymes are included. The TPS/TPP (OtsAB) is
  a two-step pathway. Glucose 6-phosphate and UDP-glucose are converted into trehalose
  6-phosphate (T6P) by the trehalose 6-phosphate synthase enzymes. T6P is then converted
  into trehalose by the T6P phosphatase enzymes. The TreYZ pathway yields trehalose
  from glucans. The first step, operated by TreY (maltooligosyltrehalose synthase),
  mediates the inversion of the reducing-end glucosyl residue of α-1,4 glucan into
  α, α-1,1-linked non-reducing trehalosyl disaccharide end. This is followed by the
  cleavage of free trehalose from the glucan chain by TreZ enzyme (maltooligosyltrehalose
  trehalohydrolase). The TreS pathway consists of the trehalose synthase enzyme (TreS),
  and converts trehalose into maltose and vice versa. The TreS and the GlgE pathways
  are linked by the Pep2 enzyme, a maltokinase, that converts maltose into maltose
  1-phosphate. The novel GlgE pathway converts trehalose via the TreS pathway into
  glucans and glycogen in Mycobacterium tuberculosis . From maltose 1-phosphate, the
  essential maltosyl-transferase GlgE extends glucan chains, and the essential GlgB
  enzyme introduces α-1,6-linked branches to linear glucans. The TreBC operon consists
  of TreB, the trehalose PTS permease, which transports extracellular trehalose inside
  the cells and converts it into T6P. T6P is then converted into glucose 6-phosphate
  and glucose by TreC enzymes encoding T6P hydrolases. Trehalase enzymes degrade trehalose
  into two molecules of glucose, and have been categorized as cytoplasmic (or neutral)
  and extracellular (or acid) enzymes. The role of the TreP and TreT pathways in pathogenicity
  has not been demonstrated thus far. The TreP pathway is the reversible hydrolysis
  of trehalose in presence of inorganic phosphate by the trehalose phosphorylase enzyme
  (TreP). The reversible TreT pathway consists of the formation of trehalose and ADP
  from ADP-glucose and glucose by the trehalose glycosyltransferring synthase enzyme
  (TreT). Ac, Archea; B, Bacteria; F, Fungi; P, Plants; Ap, Arthropods; Pr, Protists.
  * Trehalase is present in all kingdoms, including mammals.
