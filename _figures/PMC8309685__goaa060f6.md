caption: LPS, TNF-α, and other physiological or non-physiological stimuli regulate
  the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB, and the subsequent nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB. The homologous dimer of NF-κB1, which comprises two p50
  subunits, is inactive for COX-2 transcription because of the lack of an activated
  domain. PACER physically interacts and sequesters excessive p50, and transforms
  the homologous dimer p50/p50 into a p65/p50 heterodimer with transcription activity,
  thus activating the transcription of COX-2. Increased COX-2 enhances PGE2 synthesis,
  which promotes the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of CRC cells. In turn,
  the high expression of PGE2 decreases PACER expression and provides a negative feedback.
  PACER, p50-associated cyclooxygenase-2 extragenic RNA; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2;
  CRC, colorectal cancer; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B.
