caption: Regulatory changes in the pathway of flavonoid biosynthesis between female
  and male flowers. Colored rectangles correspond to genes involved in the pathway.
  Genes up-regulated in female flowers are highlighted in red over genes (in jade-green)
  detected in the pathway present in Arabidopsis but undetectable in our data due
  to lower sampling depth in our data
