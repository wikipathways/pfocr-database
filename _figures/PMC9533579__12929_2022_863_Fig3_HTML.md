caption: Growth factors in stem cells secretions and their contribution to hair regeneration.
  A Canonical Wnt signaling pathway induction and inactivation of noncanonical Wnt
  signaling pathway by SDF1, MMP3, and biglycan respectively. The latter proteins
  are secreted by DPCs due to their activation by GFs. B Role of LTBP1 secreted by
  DPC in hair regeneration. Inactivation of Bmp signaling pathway. Bind with TGF β
  and activate Smad 2/3 and TGF β pathways
