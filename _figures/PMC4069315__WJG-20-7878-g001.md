caption: Potential mechanisms of action of lactic acid bacteria via extrinsic and
  intrinsic pathways of apoptosis[,]. The apoptosis signaling pathways can be activated
  by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) through the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The
  extrinsic pathway engages Fas/tumor necrosis factor receptors or other factors to
  induce caspase related pathway. The intrinsic pathway requires mitochondrial localization
  and activation of Bax and Bak that can be prevented by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
  proteins or pharmacologic inhibitors. LAB enhanced the apoptosis induction capacity
  of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and induced the activation of autophagic cell death promoted
  directly by the induction of Beclin-1 and GRP78, as well as indirectly through the
  induction of Bcl-2 and Bak. LAB may act to prevent cancer via downregulating nuclear
  factor-kappaB (NF-κB)-dependent gene products which regulate cell proliferation
  (Cox-2, cyclin D1) and survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL).
