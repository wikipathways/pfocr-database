caption: A schematic diagram showing the cellular signalling pathway we suggest mediates
  the acute effects of DHT on amino acid in mammalian skeletal muscle fibre bundles.
  Our hypothesis is that DHT, through an unknown mechanism, activates the EGFR and
  this leads to the activation of RSK1/2 by ERK1/2. The activated RSK1/2 then increases
  the activity and expression of LAT2 (blue circle with a cross), which in turn increases
  the transport of Ile into the muscle fibre bundles. Additionally, RSK1/2 enhances
  the mRNA translation into proteins. Note that the transport of Ile is coupled to
  that of small neutral amino acids such as glutamine (Gln) that are transported into
  the cell by system A amino acid transporters such as SNAT2 (red circle with a cross).
  Thus, an increase in the activity of LAT2 indirectly increases the activity of SNAT2.
  The eventual effects of all these processes are to increase protein synthesis and
  hence skeletal muscle mass especially in fast-twitch muscle fibres.
