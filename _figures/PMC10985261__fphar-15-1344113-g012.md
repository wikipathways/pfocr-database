caption: Mechanism of the VDR-mTOR Signaling Pathway in DKD Development. The VDR-mTOR
  signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the progression of diabetic kidney disease
  {DKD). Under high glucose conditions, VDR expression is suppressed, resulting in
  reduced DDIT4 expression. Consequently, this promotes the expression of mTOR and
  its downstream signaling molecules, p70s6k and 4EBP-1. Simultaneously, it diminishes
  levels of the antioxidant enzymes SOD and GSH, while increasing the production of
  the lipid peroxidation product MDA. These molecular changes ultimately mediate autophagy.
  contributing to the initiation and progression of DKD
