caption: Fructose pathway involved in lipogenesis and insulin resistance. In the liver,
  fructose is metabolized as pyruvate via fructolysis, generating citrate and, successively,
  acetyl-CoA for lipogenesis. Dietary fructose is also converted by gut microbiota
  into acetate that is converted in acetyl-CoA by ACSS2 supplying the de novo lipogenesis.
  Fructose may directly activate SREBP1c and ChREBP, potent inducers of DNL genes
  such as ACSS2, contributing to the development of steatosis. ChREBP is active also
  on glucose production, inducing metabolic gene expression such as pyruvate kinase
  and glucose-6-phosphate, resulting in an increased gluconeogenesis. Furthermore,
  high fructose diet may reduce the expression of IRS and FoxO1, resulting in an inhibition
  of insulin signaling and an increased plasma glucose expression. On the contrary,
  as a compensatory mechanism, ChREBP activates the expression of several enzymes
  and hormones that modulate the sugar consumption, suppressing the sweet taste preference.
  ACSS2, Acetyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2; ChREBP, carbohydrate-responsive
  element-binding protein; DNL, de novo lipogenesis; FGF-21, fibroblast growth factor—21;
  FoxO1, forkhead box O1; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; SREBP1c, sterol regulatory
  element-binding protein 1c.
