caption: Conceptual overview of Inducible Directed Evolution (IDE). The pathway of
  interest is cloned into a P1 phagemid (PM) and transformed into a diversification
  strain containing the mutagenesis plasmid (MP) and P1 phage. MP is induced with
  anhydrotetracycline (+aTc) to create mutations, and then P1 lysis is induced with
  arabinose (+ara) to produce phage particles containing mutated P1 and PM. Phage
  lysate is then used to infect a screening strain to select/screen for the desired
  phenotype. After selection/screening, successful strains can enter another cycle
  of IDE.
