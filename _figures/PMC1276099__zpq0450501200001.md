caption: Model for ACTH-induced hypertension by means of the cardiac glycoside binding
  site of the Na,K-ATPase. Chronic and excessive circulation of ACTH cased by adenoma
  or an overproductive adrenal gland results in the continuous elevation of a natural
  ligand for the Na,K-ATPase. Interaction of this ligand with the high-affinity cardiac
  glycoside binding site of the Na,K-ATPase, specifically an ouabain-sensitive α1
  or an ouabain-sensitive α2 isoform, results in hypertension. The mechanism of how
  this interaction increases blood pressure is still unknown and could involve alteration
  of intracellular ion concentrations and/or induction of signaling pathway, such
  as Src/PKC/MAPKK.
