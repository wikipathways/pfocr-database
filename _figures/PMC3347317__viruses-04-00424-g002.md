caption: The modulation of type I IFN production by PRRSV. PRRSV has been shown to
  reduce the expression of TLR3 and IRF7 in pDCs. While Nsp1 has the ability to degrade
  CBP in the nucleus, Nsp1α subunit inhibits the IκB phosphorylation in the cytoplasm.
  Nsp2 inhibits IFN production by blocking the ubiquitinylation of phosphorylated
  IκB and phosphorylation of IRF3 through the OTU domain. Nsp11 suppresses IFN-β production
  through degradation of IPS-1 mRNA. For the second wave of IFN signaling, PRRSV Nsp1β
  blocks the phosphorylation of STATs and inhibits the nuclear translocation of ISGF3
  complex. Nsp1 interacts with PIAS. Since PIAS is a multi-functional protein, Nsp1
  interaction may also modulate pathways other than the JAK-STAT pathway. PKR is redistributed
  during PRRSV infection. Nsp2 has the potential to deconjugate ISGylation. The GP5
  protein induces apoptosis. Since Nsp1 is cotranslationally processed to Nsp1α and
  Nsp1β in PRRSV-infected cells, the uncleaved form of Nsp1 is unlikely to exist in
  virus-infected cells. It is unknown which subunit of Nsp1 interacts with PIAS and
  degrades CBP.
