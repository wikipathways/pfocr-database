caption: Targeted PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway inhibition using Monoclonal Antibody Therapy
  in BCSCs. This schematic illustrates the use of synthetic inhibitors and monoclonal
  antibodies to target the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in breast cancer stem cells.
  The HER2 receptor, overexpressed in HER2-positive breast cancers, activates PI3K/Akt
  signaling, leading to mTOR pathway activation, which promotes cell growth and proliferation.
  Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, combined with RAD001 (an mTOR
  inhibitor) or everolimus, enhances apoptosis, reduces cell division, and decreases
  tumor size. Combining trastuzumab with PI3K inhibitors like BKM120 shows synergistic
  effects in reducing CSC growth, drug resistance, and proliferation. Additionally,
  dinutuximab, an antibody targeting GD2, disrupts CSC functions by inhibiting adhesion,
  migration, and mammosphere formation, further enhancing apoptosis. This figure highlights
  the potential therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibody combinations in inhibiting
  CSC-driven tumor growth and overcoming therapy resistance in aggressive breast cancers,
  including triple-negative and HER2-positive subtypes
