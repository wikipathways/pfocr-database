caption: (A) Biosynthetic pathway for P. aeruginosa HAQs involving anthranilic acid
  and activated β-keto fatty acids as direct precursors. Using labeled precursor substrates,
  the possibility of an alternative pathway via the formation of kynurenic acid as
  an intermediate, as shown in panel B, was excluded.
