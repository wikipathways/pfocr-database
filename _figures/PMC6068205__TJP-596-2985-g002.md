caption: Under conditions where cellular oxygen supply exceeds demand (normoxia),
  HIF is hydroxylated by PHD enzymes leading to its ubiquitination by the von Hipple
  Lindau protein and its subsequent degradation. Under conditions where oxygen demand
  exceeds supply, hydroxylases are inhibited leading to the stabilisation of HIF‐1α
  subunits which dimerise with HIF‐1β to form a transcriptionally active transcription
  factor which governs the cellular transcriptional response to hypoxia.
