caption: The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and protein O-GlcNAcylation. Glucose
  imported into cells is rapidly phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate (glucose-6-P)
  and converted to fructose-6-phosphate (fructose-6-P), which is metabolized to glucosamine-6-phosphate
  by l-glutamine-d-fructose 6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), resulting in the
  synthesis of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). GFAT can be inhibited by the
  glutamine analogs 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON) and O-diazoacetyl-l-serine (azaserine).
  Flux through the HBP can be increased with glucosamine, which bypasses GFAT. UDP-GlcNAc
  is a sugar donor for classical glycosylation reactions in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) and Golgi apparatus and is also the obligatory substrate for uridine-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine:polypeptide
  β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (OGT), leading to the formation of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine
  (O-GlcNAc)-modified proteins. β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase) catalyzes
  the removal of O-GlcNAc from proteins. The level of O-GlcNAc on proteins can be
  blocked by inhibiting OGT with the uridine analog alloxan or with 2[(4-chlorophenyl)imino]tetrahydro-4-oxo-3-[2-tricyclo(3.3.1.13.7)dec-1-ylethel]
  (TTO4), whereas O-GlcNAcylation of proteins can be rapidly increased by inhibiting
  O-GlcNAcase with O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate
  (PUGNAc) or with 1,2 dideoxy-2-methyl-d-glucopyranoso(2,1-d)-2-thiazoline (NAG-thiazoline).
