caption: NF-κB and Nrf2 pathways cross talk via different redox-sensitive MAPK, the
  oxidation of which affects activities of NF-κB and Nrf2 (, ). The effect of MnP
  on the suppression of NF-κB activity and phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, AKT, and p38MAPK
  in 4T1 breast cancer cells, mediated by H2O2, suggest the involvement of MnP-driven
  protein oxidation (). The validity of such assumption is supported by a direct evidence
  provided from the redox proteomic study (). Study was conducted on 4T1 tumor cells.
  H2O2 produced during MnP/Asc redox cycling induced major oxidative damage of proteins
  in NF-κB pathway, most so p38MAPK and p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB (). In the same
  study, oxidation of PKC kinase, Keap1, as well as of protein phosphatase type 2A
  was also demonstrated () (, ). The reported interactions of MnP with each and all
  of different redox-sensitive signaling pathways make understanding of the origin
  of therapeutic effects an extremely difficult task. AKT, a serine/threonine kinase;
  ERK, extracellular signal-regulating receptor kinase; JNK, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase;
  PKC, protein kinase C. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred
