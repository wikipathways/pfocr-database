caption: 'Hijacking cellular pathways and oncogenic mechanisms in Cryptosporidium
  infections: Cryptosporidium manipulates several key host cell signaling pathways
  to ensure its survival and potentially contribute to cancer development. Upon contact
  with epithelial cells, the parasite activates multiple signaling proteins, including
  PI3K, Src, Cdc42, and Rho GTPases. This disruption of normal cellular signaling
  breaks down the epithelial barrier, helping the parasite form a specialized vacuole,
  the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), where it can thrive. Cryptosporidium also triggers
  inflammation by activating NF-κB signaling through Toll-like receptors (TLR2/4),
  which not only helps the parasite avoid cell death but also promotes its replication.
  In addition, Cryptosporidium interferes with the Wnt signaling pathway, altering
  the location of β-catenin. Disruptions to cell cycle regulation, adhesion, and migration
  create conditions more conducive to tumor development. Furthermore, Cryptosporidium
  may remodel host cytoskeletons using molecules like c-Src, PI3K and Rho GTPases,
  making entry easier while altering host cell structures that may promote cancer
  progression. Host microRNAs like miR-27b and ciRS7 further regulate immune responses
  and gene expression that foster oncogenesis. ITGA2 and ITGB1 play pivotal roles
  in signal transduction that enhance the migration/survival of host cell populations,
  thus encouraging tumorigenic processes that might support tumorigenic processes.
