caption: Inflammation-induced intestinal carcinogenesis through the activation of
  the NLRP3 inflammasome. Carcinogens can disrupt the host defense through an increase
  in ROS/RNS production that results in the disruption of immune barriers. NLRP-3
  activation is the main mechanism of inflammation-induced intestinal carcinogenesis.
  NLRP-3 activation is mediated through several approaches. DAMPs/PAMPs (pathogens)
  are recognized by TLRs that activate the NF-κB pathway to enhance the translation
  of proinflammatory cytokines. ATP (as another stimulus) will open the P2X7 (ATP-ion
  channel), which leads to K+ efflux, also activating the NLRP3 inflammasome directly.
  Crystals and particle substances will be transported through endosomes and, after
  the merge with lysosomes, will result in lysosomal rupture and directly induce a
  K+ efflux and NLRP3 inflammasome formation. NLRP3 inflammasomes comprised of NLRP3,
  ASC and caspase-1 will induce the cleavage of pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-1β into their
  mature active forms through activated caspase-1, which produces inflammation and
  pyroptosis. DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns; PAMPs, pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS, reactive nitrogen species.
