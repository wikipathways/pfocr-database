caption: BH3-only proteins indirectly trigger BAX translocation, cyt c release, caspase
  activation, and apoptosis during TFD-induced neuronal cell death. (A) Shown are
  four proposed models depicting how BH3-only proteins, such as BIM and HRK, may promote
  BAX translocation and its downstream sequelae during TFD in SCG and CG neurons.
  Models 1 and 2 invoke direct interaction of BH3 donors with BAX, whereas models
  3 and 4 involve BH3-only proteins indirectly triggering BAX translocation via inactivating
  interactions with antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. We favor model 4 for reasons discussed
  in the text. (B) A dynamic equilibrium model for BAX translocation. During TFD in
  SCG and CG neurons, BIM and HRK are induced and inactivate antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins,
  thereby altering the equilibrium between cytosolic and mitochondrial pools of BAX,
  culminating in apparent BAX translocation, multimerization, and integration, followed
  by cyt c release, caspase activation, and apoptotic cell death. See text for more
  details.
