caption: HSP90 in tumor progression. Many HSP90 client proteins are involved in numerous
  processes related to tumor progression. Hsp90 interacts with hTERT promoter, increases
  level of telomerase and promote immortalization of cancer cells; HSP90α is secreted
  into ECM and activate precursor of MMP which causes the decomposition of extracellular
  matrix; HSP90 client ILK recruits other components of ILK-PINCH-Parvin complex which
  is related to tumor’s adhesion; HIF-1α is closely related to HSP90. HIF-1α can affect
  expression level of VEGF which promote angiogenesis through VRGF/VEGFR pathway;
  HIF-1α enhances the antiapoptotic effect of cancer cells by the antiapoptotic BCL-2
  family; HSP90 is recruited by the MRN complex to DNA damage site and phosphorylated
  by MRN. HEP90 assist MRN to activate ATM and initiate a series pathways of DNA damage
  repair; HSP90 client Akt can promote antiapoptotic effect of cancer cells by downregulating
  components of the apoptotic machinery. Akt promote tumor growth by accelerating
  G1 progression. HSP90 escorts the antigenic peptides to the ER and the antigenic
  peptides are loaded onto the newly synthesized MHC-I molecules. The MHC-I molecules
  carrying antigenic peptides are transported to the surface of cancer cell.
