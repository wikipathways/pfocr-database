caption: Biosynthesis and cycling of s-adenosylmethionine. For s-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM) to be produced, methionine needs to be biosynthesised first which requires
  sulfide, the cofactor acetyl-CoA as well as the two amino acids aspartate and serine.
  There are three possible sources from which serine can be derived, with the glycolate
  pathway (light blue) being predominant in autotrophic tissues and the phosphorylated
  pathway (purple) predominating in heterotrophic tissues, whereas the metabolic context
  of the glycerate pathway (orange) is still unknown. SAM SYNTHETASE (50) is the enzyme
  responsible for converting methionine into SAM (). SAM can then be used by countless
  methyltransferases, which in turn add a methyl to their target molecule, releasing
  S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) as a by-product (; dark blue). The SAH released from
  these reactions is recycled through the action of SAH HYDROLASE (SAHH; 52; ; ) which
  yields adenosine and homocysteine that is subsequently converted to methionine by
  METHIONINE SYNTHASE (MS; 49; red) using a folate cofactor (; ). Due to the importance
  of SAM, homeostasis needs to be maintained, which occurs through the action of SAM:METHIONINE
  S-METHYLTRANSFERASE (53) which converts SAM and methionine into S-methylmethionine
  (SMM) and SAH (green). SMM produced in the leaves, can be moved into the phloem
  and transported to different tissues. The accumulation of SMM and methionine in
  the seeds is done in both a spatial and temporal manner (), but whether the SMM
  cycle is used in other non-reproductive tissues such as xylem during SCW formation
  is still unclear. This pathway is the most common source of SAM in seeds. SMM produced
  in the leaves arrives at the seeds via the phloem, and HOMOCYSTEINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE
  (54) subsequently uses the SMM and homocysteine to produce two methionine molecules
  (). The accumulation of SMM and methionine in the seeds is done in both a spatial
  and temporal manner (), but whether the SMM cycle is used in other non-reproductive
  tissues such as xylem during SCW formation is still unclear. Unidirectional arrows
  indicate irreversible reactions, bidirectional arrows indicate reversible reactions,
  whereas lines with multiple numbers next to it indicates multiple enzymatic reactions.
  Key metabolites are highlighted in square boxes. The enzymes (26–54) represented
  by each number can be found in , along with additional information such as gene
  ID and cellular localisation. Several enzymatic steps are repeated from .
