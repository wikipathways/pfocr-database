caption: Schematic simplified cartoon showing some of the indirect modulatory effects
  of midbrain (ventral tegmental area, VTA) opioid and endocannabinoid signals on
  dopaminergic transmission in nucleus accumbens (NAc). Reward-related stimuli conveyed
  through glutamatergic afferents (green) promote burst firing of dopamine (DA) neurons
  (yellow) mainly driven by ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) binding activation
  at the dopaminergic cell. The level of activation is normally kept in check by GABAergic
  counterbalancing inputs (pink), but also by direct inhibitory GABAergic input inhibiting
  presynaptic glutamate release (). Endogenous [released from opioidergic neurons
  (light blue), mostly projecting from the hypothalamus] or exogenous (natural or
  synthetic opioid like molecules) opioids activate endogenous mu opioid receptors
  (MOR) on GABAergic interneurons. The MOR is coupled to inhibitory G proteins, whose
  activation (by an endogenous peptide like endorphin or exogenous agonists like morphine
  and fentanyl) leads to a dissociation between the Gα and Gβγ subunits and the activation
  of intracellular effector pathways. One such pathway leads to the inhibition of
  GABA release as a result of increased conduction of potassium ions, which hyperpolarizes
  the cell making it less responsive to depolarizing inputs and inhibiting calcium
  influx (). In addition, activation of MOR increases mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) signaling while their phosphorylation activates the arrestin pathway (),
  which has the ability to desensitize, activate, and control the trafficking of G
  protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) (). A drop in GABAergic tone causes a net disinhibition
  of the neighboring dopaminergic neuron and the release of excess dopamine (black
  dots) onto direct and indirect medium spiny neurons [pink medium spiny neuron (MSN)],
  which reinforces the euphorigenic effects of opioids. Ionotropic GluR-mediated activation
  of the DA neuron leads to Ca2+ influx (via voltage-gated calcium channels), which
  is either facilitated or hampered in D1R vs D2R expressing MSN populations, respectively
  () (inset), leading to their differential roles in plasticity. At the same time,
  the Ca2+ influx, combined with activation of mGluA1/5, triggers the “on demand”
  production of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) from diacylglycerol (DAG) [or anandamide
  (AEA) from N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPE)]. Retrograde 2-AG transmission
  through CB1 receptor binding on monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) containing afferent
  (GABA and Glu) neurons has the net effect of disinhibiting dopamine neurons and
  facilitating phasic DA release (). This is because cannabinoids (e.g., tetrahydrocannabinol,
  2-AG) operate as full agonists at GABA terminals [that display a high CB1R to vesicles
  ratio ()] but as partial agonists at Glu terminals [where the CB1R-to-vesicles ratio
  is much lower (, )]. As shown, AEA is assumed to be retrograde in spite of data
  showing that FAAH is predominately postsynaptic while NAPE PLD is presynaptic. The
  true nature of AEA neurotransmission remains unclear partly because there are other
  pathways for AEA synthesis. In the NAc, GABAergic projections, sent by the VTA,
  also synapse onto cholinergic interneurons (dark gray), thus inhibiting their excitatory
  input onto DA terminals. Activation of either CB1 or MOR on these GABA neurons can
  stimulate DA terminals (independently of VTA DA neuron activation) by disinhibiting
  ACh release while activation of these receptors, which are also expressed on ACh
  interneurons, could in theory have the opposite effect on DA levels in the accumbens
  (). GABAergic and glutamatergic terminals in the NAc also have the capacity to modulate
  accumbal DA activity onto MSNs directly. Since these neurons also express MOR [but
  some also CB1R (, )], their activation on GABA inputs could enhance DA release,
  while their inhibitory effects on glutamatergic inputs could reduce accumbal release
  of DA.
