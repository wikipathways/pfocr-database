caption: Different involvement of PDGFRα and PDGFRβ in SSc pathogenesis. Injury and
  inflammation initiate secretion of PDGF isoforms that bind and activate their cognate
  PDGFRs. Some autoantibodies might also induce PDGFR signaling in SSc. Genetic mouse
  models of hyperresponsive PDGFR signaling reveal distinct consequences for each
  receptor. This leads to the prediction that the PDGFRα signaling pathway predominates
  in SSc fibrosis; PDGFRβ signaling, which is not sufficient to promote fibrosis,
  is likely to promote other hallmarks of SSc
