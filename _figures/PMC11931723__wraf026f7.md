caption: Genomic potential for tryptophan and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) synthesis
  in Anza-Borrego isolates of Bradyrhizobium and Methylocaldum. (A) Comparison of
  metabolic potential for the synthesis of IAA by Anza-Borrego isolates. (B) The major
  difference in their tryptophan synthesis pathway relies on the gene encoding the
  initial step enzymes; Bradyrhizobium has the fused version of the anthranilate synthase
  TrpEG, and Methylocaldum has its two components separately
