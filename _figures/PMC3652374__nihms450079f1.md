caption: Insulin signalling attenuates cAMP-mediated lipolysis at multiple steps in
  adipocytes. (a) NPs signal through NP receptor A to increase cGMP levels and activate
  PKG. (b) Stimulation of the β-adrenergic receptor increases cAMP levels, which activates
  PKA. (c) The lipolytic actions of PKA and PKG converge through phosphorylating perilipin-1
  (Plin1), releasing CGI-58 to bind and activate ATGL, thereby stimulating hydrolysis
  of triacylglycerol to DAG. (d) Both PKA and PKG also phosphorylate HSL, inducing
  its translocation to lipid droplets, where it interacts with phosphorylated perilipin
  and acts primarily to convert DAG to MAG. (e) Activation of the insulin receptor–IRS
  signalling pathway inhibits lipolysis through activation of adipose-specific phospholipase
  A2 (AdPLA2), which inhibits adenylate cyclase via prostaglandin E2synthesis, while
  activation of Akt leads to phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE-3B) activation to lower cAMP
  levels. Lipid droplet protein FSP27 is also upregulated by insulin signalling. (f)
  mTORC1 acts as a critical node in the control of adipocyte lipid metabolism, through
  reducing Atgl mRNA levels and (g) stimulating lipogenesis via SREBP1-c. Alternatively,
  mTORC1 stimulates a negative feedback loop through activation of (h) S6K and growth
  factor receptor-bound protein 10 (GRB10). (i) PKA can also regulate adipocyte lipid
  handling by modulating its own activity by phosphorylating and activating PDE-3B,
  while PKA has also been shown to (j) inhibit mTORC1
