caption: A model for salt-mediated and JA-dependent cell elongation inhibition in
  Arabidopsis roots. Salt-mediated cell elongation inhibition could be regulated by
  two pathways. The first is JA independent while the second one is JA dependent.
  The JA-dependent pathway probably begins with an increase of JA-Ile levels in the
  MZ and the stele (DZ) by a still unknown mechanism leading to JA signaling activation
  (this work). Once JA signaling is activated the up-regulation of JA-responsive genes
  such as JAZ (this work) and others (presumed) occurs. During salt stress response
  cell elongation is inhibited in the EZ (this work) decreasing primary root growth
  in Arabidopsis. The dashed lines indicate presumed steps of the pathway. The numbers
  1, 2 and 3 indicate steps dependent on JAR1, COI1 and proteasome, respectively.
  Cell elongation inhibition in the EZ represented by number 4, is triggered by salt
  stress or osmotic stress by a mechanism dependent on AOS, COI1, JAZ3 destabilization
  and MYC2/3/4. The asterisk denotes a presumed increase of JA-Ile levels based on
  JAZ1-GUS stability in the JA-Ile sensor line.
