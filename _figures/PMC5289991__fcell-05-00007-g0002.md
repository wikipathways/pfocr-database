caption: The MYC-driven self-reinforcing loop in ESCs. (A) MYC-dependent ESCs are
  maintained in presence of OHT, which activate MYC-ER, finally leading to its nuclear
  localization. In the nucleus, MYC-ER stimulates a self-reinforcing positive feedback
  loop. Together with PRC2, MYC represses antagonist of the WNT pathway, such as DKK
  and SFRP family members, thus resulting in activation of the WNT pathway. Consequently,
  active β-catenin translocates into the nucleus, where, among its targets, it transcriptionally
  activates both myc and mycn. Endogenous MYC and MYCN, in turn, reinforce this mechanism
  by contributing to the repression of WNT antagonists. The feedback positive loop
  is also sustained by the fact that MYC mediates the inhibition of the destruction
  complex (AXIN, APC, GSK3β) function, resulting in reduction of GSK3β-dependent degradation
  of both MYC/MYCN and β-catenin (Fagnocchi et al., ). (B) Role of MYC in sustaining
  mESCs identity in MYC-dependent vs. 2i/LIF maintained cells. MYC-dependent cells
  rely on MYC for the concomitant down-regulation of MAPK/ERK and up-regulation of
  WNT pathways (Chappell et al., ; Fagnocchi et al., ). In addition, it also sustains
  proliferation by inducing the biosynthetic machinery. Once MYC activity is lost,
  by either knocking down myc/mycn or by inactivating MYC-ER after short-term exposure
  to OHT, mESCs differentiate spontaneously as both the proliferation and the maintenance
  of pluripotency gene expression are affected (Cartwright et al., ; Fagnocchi et
  al., ). On the contrary, in 2i/LIF cultured cells, chemical inhibitors bypass the
  role of MYC in modulating signaling pathways. Indeed, CHIR and PD activate and inhibit
  WNT and MAPK/ERK pathways, respectively (Cole et al., ; Ying et al., ). Accordingly,
  MYC is less expressed in 2i/LIF mESCs (Marks et al., ). Nonetheless, MYC still have
  a key function in 2i/LIF medium, as its deletion leads to impairment of the biosynthetic
  machinery and entrance of ESCs in a reversible dormant state (Scognamiglio et al.,
  ). Concomitantly, the pluripotency is not affected as chemical inhibitors still
  modulate signaling to the core TRN even in the absence of MYC. Solid green and red
  arrows indicate high or low expression on nearby genes, respectively. Solid black
  arrows and flat lines indicate activation or repression, respectively. Red crosses
  indicate inhibition of related functions.
