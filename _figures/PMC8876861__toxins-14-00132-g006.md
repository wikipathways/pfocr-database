caption: Proposed metabolic pathway affected by AA and the protective effects of NEB.
  AAs increase the production of ROS, which leads the cell to fight oxidative stress
  (1) through glutathione and its precursors (glutamate and glutamine) and (2) by
  promoting glycosylation that protects proteins against free radicals. AAs decrease
  the expression of eNOS and the bioavailability of NO. AAs affect the Krebs cycle
  and citrulline–arginine (cit–arg) cycle, with decreased arginine production and
  increased aspartate. NEB decreases ROS (1) by the scavenger effect and (2) by activating
  eNOS following its binding to the β3 adrenergic receptor (AR) and inhibiting ADMA,
  which leads to an increase in the bioavailability of NO. ↑ = increase; ↓ = decrease;
  ⊥ = inhibition; → = activation.
