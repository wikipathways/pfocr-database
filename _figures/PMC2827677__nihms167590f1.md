caption: Initial steps of HR (see explanations in the text) result in formation of
  Joint molecules (D-loops) that are further extended by DNA polymerase and processed
  afterward through the two major pathways, SDSA or DSBR. (A) Repair of DSB through
  the synthesis dependent strand annealing (SDSA) mechanism resuls in non-crossover
  recombinants. Dissociation of extended D-loop by branch migration is a crucial step
  of the SDSA mechanism. (B) The double-stranded break repair (DSBR) mechanism, which
  is more frequent during meiosis, results in crossover recombinants. DSB repair by
  HR generates Holliday junctions, which may branch migrate along the DNA axis. After
  second end capture, branch migration would either stabilize double D-loops by increasing
  the length of DNA heteroduplex or cause their dissociation channeling recombination
  intermediates through the double D-loop dissociation (DDD) mechanism into the SDSA
  pathway [].
