caption: MAPK signaling pathways. ERK1/2, ERK5, JNKs and p38 proteins are classical
  components of MAPK signaling pathways according the traditional linear four-tiered
  organization. These pathways have been implicated in signal transduction from cell
  surface receptors (such as receptor tyrosine kinases or G-protein-coupled receptors)
  to the nucleus, leading to the activation of various cellular processes, including
  cell proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation. p-, phosphorylated.
