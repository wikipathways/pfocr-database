caption: 'Protein–protein interaction sub-networks (largest connected components)
  for target and reference set pairs with small overlap, predicted to be functionally
  associated by EnrichNet: (a) gastric cancer mutated genes (blue) and genes/proteins
  from the BioCarta pathway ‘Role of Erk5 in Neuronal Survival’ (magenta, the shared
  genes are shown in green); (b) bladder cancer mutated genes (blue) and genes/proteins
  from Gene Ontology term ‘Tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3’ (GO:0042503, magenta;
  the only shared gene NF2 is shown in green). An over-representation analysis approach
  would have missed these associations, since only few of the cancer mutated genes
  are members of the corresponding processes'
