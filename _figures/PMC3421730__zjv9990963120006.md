caption: Pathway analysis of the antiviral IFN response in infected THP-1 cells. The
  IPA platform was used to analyze components of the IFN response involved in both
  IRF and NF-κB signaling. Fold changes of transcript expression levels of the genes
  in IRF and NF-κB signaling at 18 hpi were imported from the Agilent microarray analysis.
  Fold changes are shown in red (upregulation) and green (downregulation).
