caption: Model depicting the regulatory functions of the typical RNA-binding proteins
  in plant adaptation to abiotic stress. Environmental stress caused by salt, drought,
  cold, heat, hypoxia, flooding or oxidative conditions may induce or repress the
  expression of relevant RBPs. During the response, RBPs may act in a ABA-dependent
  or independent pathway to regulate gene expression and play various roles in RNA
  metabolism including RNA processing and alternative splicing in the nucleus, nuclear
  export of mRNAs, mRNA degradation via processing bodies, mRNA storage in stress
  granules, and translational control in the cytoplasm. Some RBPs may also function
  as RNA chaperones to assist RNA folding and structure remodeling. Nuclear-encoded
  RBPs may also be targeted to chloroplasts or mitochondria and participate in intron
  splicing, rRNAs processing and/or translation of plastid mRNAs, processes critical
  for organellar biogenesis and function during plant adaptation to stress. Examples
  of RBPs that are involved in each cellular process are shown in the model. More
  detailed information can be found in  and in the main text.
