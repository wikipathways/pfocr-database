caption: cGAS-STING signal pathway activated by cytoplasmic DNA. Free cytoplasmic
  DNA derived from self and foreign sources are specifically recognized by cyclic
  guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS). Then, activated
  cGAS induces the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate
  (cGAMP) with intracytoplasmic ATP and GTP as raw materials. As the secondary messenger,
  cGAMP or cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) binds to endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) adapter
  protein STING (stimulating interferon gene), which causes a conformational change
  of STING and induces itself activation. Subsequently, activated STING migrates from
  ER to the Golgi apparatus. During this process, STNG could recruit and activate
  TBK1 kinase and IKK kinase, and in turn, activate the downstream IRF3 and NF-κB
  signal cascades, thus inducing the expression of type I interferon (type I IFN)
  and inflammatory factors to strengthen immune responses.
