caption: Targeting molecules common to pathways promoting angiogenesis and neuroendocrine
  phenotype in prostate cancer. Androgen derivation therapy (ADT) elevates cAMP level,
  which activates PKA, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of CREB1. Activated
  CREB1 directly induces transcription of several genes involved in neuroendocrine
  differentiation (NED) and angiogenesis, such as VEGF, ENO2, GRK3, and HDAC2. VEGF
  is a potent pro-angiogenic factor, while ENO2 is a neuroendocrine marker. GRK3 promotes
  angiogenesis, NE marker expression, and prostate cancer progression. HDAC2 is critical
  for prostate cancer progression that is induced by chronical bio-behavioral stress
  and signals from beta adrenergic receptors (ADRBs). GRK3 and HDAC2 promotes angiogenesis,
  at least in part through downregulating TSP1. TSP1 is well-established as an anti-angiogenesis
  factor. Through unclear mechanisms, CREB1 activation enhances the PRC2 function
  of EZH2, which is critical for NED and angiogenesis induced by ADT. In endothelial
  cells, VEGF induces EZH2 expression and activity, which contributes to VEGF's action
  in promoting angiogenesis. Loss of p53 and RB1, alone or in cooperation, promote
  angiogenesis and NE phenotype through multiple mechanisms (detailed in text). IL-6
  pathway activation enhances angiogenesis (through inducing VEGF) and NE phenotype
  (through inducing CHGA). AURKA interacts with N-Myc and regulates the stability
  of the latter, which promotes NED. AURKA and AURKB regulate angiogenesis in endothelial
  and neuroblastoma cells. HIF1A promotes angiogenesis through inducing VEGF. Moreover,
  it also cooperates with FoxA2 to promote NED and tumorigenesis. ONECUT2 has recently
  emerged as a master regulator of NED. Recent studies have also implicated receptor
  tyrosine kinase RET in regulating NED and angiogenesis. Novel strategies targeting
  the proteins and pathways that regulate both prominent phenotypes may be effective
  to treat NEPC (detailed in text).

  description: Targeting molecules common to pathways promoting angiogenesis and neuroendocrine
    phenotype in prostate cancer. Androgen derivation therapy (ADT) elevates cAMP
    level, which activates PKA, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of CREB1.
    Activated CREB1 directly induces transcription of several genes involved in neuroendocrine
    differentiation (NED) and angiogenesis, such as VEGF, ENO2, GRK3, and HDAC2. VEGF
    is a potent pro-angiogenic factor, while ENO2 is a neuroendocrine marker. GRK3
    promotes angiogenesis, NE marker expression, and prostate cancer progression.
    HDAC2 is critical for prostate cancer progression that is induced by chronical
    bio-behavioral stress and signals from beta adrenergic receptors (ADRBs). GRK3
    and HDAC2 promotes angiogenesis, at least in part through downregulating TSP1.
    TSP1 is well-established as an anti-angiogenesis factor. Through unclear mechanisms,
    CREB1 activation enhances the PRC2 function of EZH2, which is critical for NED
    and angiogenesis induced by ADT. In endothelial cells, VEGF induces EZH2 expression
    and activity, which contributes to VEGF's action in promoting angiogenesis. Loss
    of p53 and RB1, alone or in cooperation, promote angiogenesis and NE phenotype
    through multiple mechanisms (detailed in text). IL-6 pathway activation enhances
    angiogenesis (through inducing VEGF) and NE phenotype (through inducing CHGA).
    AURKA interacts with N-Myc and regulates the stability of the latter, which promotes
    NED. AURKA and AURKB regulate angiogenesis in endothelial and neuroblastoma cells.
    HIF1A promotes angiogenesis through inducing VEGF. Moreover, it also cooperates
    with FoxA2 to promote NED and tumorigenesis. ONECUT2 has recently emerged as a
    master regulator of NED. Recent studies have also implicated receptor tyrosine
    kinase RET in regulating NED and angiogenesis. Novel strategies targeting the
