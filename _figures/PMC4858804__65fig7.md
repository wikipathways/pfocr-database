caption: Recycling and regulation of eIF2 by eIF2B. (A) Pathway of eIF2 nucleotide
  cycle and its regulation by eIF2α phosphorylation, adapted from . GDI function of
  eIF5, GDF and GEF activities of eIF2B, and GAP function of eIF5 (5) are described
  in the text. Phosphorylation of eIF2α on Ser51 by GCN2 is represented by the blue
  circle; GDP, red circle; and GTP, green circle. (B) Schematics of eIF2B subunits
  and domain organization (left) and structure of the eIF2Bε GEF domain (right, pdb
  1PAQ) (). Homologous domains are shown in identical color shades. PLD and LβH indicate
  the pyrophosphorylase-like and the left-handed β-helical domains, respectively ().
  αRF indicates the α-helical domain followed by a Rossmann-like fold shared by the
  α-, β-, and δ-subunits. Structural models were drawn using Chimera software (UCSF).
