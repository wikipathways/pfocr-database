caption: The cuticle collagen biogenesis pathway in C. elegans. Steps within the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) (blue) include, proline hydroxylation by DPY-18, disulphide bond
  formation by PDI, and proline isomerisation, by proline isomerases (PPIases). Export
  from the ER requires a functional COPII-pathway (sec-23). All cuticle collagens
  are predicted to be N-terminally processed by the subtilisin-like protease BLI-4,
  whereas a subset of collagens are C-terminally processed by the BMP-like protease
  DPY-31. The final step in collagen maturation involves tyrosine cross-link formation
  and is catalysed by peroxidase enzymes including BLI-3 and MLT-7. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  web version of this article.)
