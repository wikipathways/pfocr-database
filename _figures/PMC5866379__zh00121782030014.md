caption: 'Cartoon showing hypothetical activation of CFTR by cigarette smoke extract
  via prostanoid and store-operated cAMP signaling pathways. A: cigarette smoke stimulation
  of dual oxidases DUOX1/2 produces superoxide, which is dismutated to O2 and H2O2,
  which enters the cells. Intracellular H2O2 stimulates prostaglandin synthesis by
  cyclooxygenase 2 and secondary ROS induce fatty acid peroxidation and isoprostane
  synthesis. Prostaglandins and isoprostanes are released as autocrine signals that
  activate mainly EP4 receptors, stimulating adenylyl cyclase and raising local [cAMP]i,
  which leads to PKA phosphorylation and activation of CFTR. This pathway mediates
  stimulation by both cigarette smoke and H2O2. B: cigarette smoke extract (but not
  H2O2) also stimulates a second pathway by stimulating Ca2+ release from lysosomes
  and other acidic organelles and translocation of STIM1 to sites near the plasma
  membrane where it activates adenylyl cyclase as part of the store-operated cAMP
  signaling pathway. This mechanism may account for ~50% of the CFTR response to cigarette
  smoke extract but does not contribute significantly to stimulation by H2O2.'
