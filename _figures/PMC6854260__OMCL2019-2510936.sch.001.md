caption: The proposed mechanism of the thiol peroxidation and thiol oxidation cycle
  of diorganotellurides. In the prooxidant pathway, the formation of the tellurol
  is associated with oxidation of low-molecular-mass (RSH) or protein-thiol (PSH)
  groups causing depletion of glutathione (GSH) through conjugation, oxidation, or
  export and/or protein loss of function. In the antioxidant pathway, organotellurium
  compounds decompose peroxides either as a substrate for mammalian thioredoxin reductase
  (TrxR) or as glutathione peroxidase-like activity via the formation of the tellurol/tellurate
  (PhTeh/PhTe−) (the scheme is reproduced from Puntel et al. (2012), under the Creative
