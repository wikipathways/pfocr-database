caption: The presence of extracellular arginine enhances arginine uptake by binding
  to the SPS-sensor, leading to the endoproteolytic activation of transcription factor
  Stp2. The active form of Stp2 efficiently targets to the nucleus and binds the UASaa
  in the promoter of genes encoding amino acid permeases (AAP). Amino acid permeases
  are cotranslationally inserted into the membrane of the ER, and transported to the
  plasma membrane (PM, arrow) via the secretory pathway, a process that requires the
  ER membrane-localized chaperone Csh3. The increased functional expression of amino
  acid permeases (Aap) lead to an enhanced capacity to take up arginine. Intracellular
  arginine is catabolized by arginase (Car1) yielding ornithine and urea. Urea is
  further degraded by the urea amidolyase (Dur1,2) generating CO2 and NH3. Ornithine
  is further catabolized to proline in the cytoplasm in a series of enzymatic reactions
  starting with the ornithine aminotransferase (Car2). Proline is transported into
  the mitochondria where it is catabolized by Put1 and Put2 forming glutamate. These
  reactions generate the reduced electron carriers FADH2 and NADH,H+, respectively.
  Glutamate is oxidized by glutamate dehydrogenase (Gdh2) forming α-ketoglutarate
  in a reaction that liberates NH3 and generates NADH,H+. α-ketoglutarate feeds directly
  into the mitochondrial-localized TCA cycle. The reduced electron carriers generated
  by proline, glutamate and TCA cycle metabolic events are oxidized in reactions coupled
  to the generation ATP by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The elevated levels
  of ATP in the cytoplasm activate the adenyl cyclase (Cyr1) in a Ras1-dependent manner,
  which activates the downstream protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway and the
  effector transcription factor Efg1. The active phosphorylated form of Efg1 binds
  the UASEfg1 in the promoter of hyphal specific genes (HSG), thereby inducing yeast-to-hyphal
  morphogenesis. The catabolism of arginine via the proline pathway induces hyphal
  growth more rapidly (FAST) than the Dur1,2 generated CO2 (slow). Mitochondrial activity
  is repressed in the presence of high glucose.
