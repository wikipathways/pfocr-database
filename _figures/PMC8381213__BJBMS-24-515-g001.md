caption: Cross-talk between SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins (NSPs) and host cell
  signaling pathways mediates immune modulation. SARS-CoV-2 NSP-1, PLpro, and NSP-13
  interfere with type I IFN signaling by mediating the inhibition of STAT1 and STAT2
  phosphorylation, the deISGylation of IRF3, and the suppression of STAT2 phosphorylation,
  respectively. SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, NSP-6, and NSP-13 reduce TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase)
  phosphorylation, leading to the blockade of the RIG-1 pathway’. PLpro can also interfere
  with RIG-1 signaling through the deISGylate of MAD5 (melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5). NSP-14 and NSP-15 abolish IRF3 nuclear translocation, leading to the
  inhibition of type I IFN expression. SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and NSP-10 can enhance the
  proinflammatory response, and PLpro can enhance the extracellular release of ISG,
  which can trigger proinflammatory mediator production following binding with the
  LFA-1 receptor. NSP-10 can block NF-κB repression, promoting NF-κB pathway activation
  and IL-8 production. NSP-1 can suppress IFN-β, IFN-λ, ISRE, and IL-8 secretion by
  blocking mRNA translation.
