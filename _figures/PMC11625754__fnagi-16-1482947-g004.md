caption: Effect of Aβ on the NMJ formation process. (A) APP interacts with LRP4 and
  agrin to regulate NMJ formation. APP interacts with LRP4 and activates Musk. The
  synergistic binding of APP and agrin to LRP4 further strengthens the interaction
  between LRP4 and APP in muscle, promoting synaptic differentiation and the maintenance
  of postnatal NMJs. (B) APP hydrolysis leads to the failure of LRP4 binding to APP
  and the collapse of its domain, which fails to activate Musk and reduces AChR aggregation
  on the sarcolemma, leading to muscle fiber denervation. Moreover, it affects the
  development of the NMJ, and the degeneration of the NMJ leads to a reduction in
  CHT targeting. In addition, the activation of classical inflammation, oxidative
  stress and calcium ion imbalance by Aβ may also be a potential signaling pathway,
  but more experimental evidence is needed to confirm these findings. Created with
