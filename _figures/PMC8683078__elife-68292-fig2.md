caption: (A) The Biofactoid Explorer is an interactive web app that publicly presents
  each author-curated entry alongside their article. Yellow arrows indicate how curated
  information is connected to outside knowledge bases. A “Network overview” (left)
  displays information about the article and pathway as a whole; a “Network item view”
  (right) displays information for a selected item (e.g. interaction, protein). (B)
  Biofactoid data establishes a bridge between related pathways described by structured
  biological knowledge from distinct data sources. Two author-curated interactions
  submitted to Biofactoid (red edges) bridge previously distinct pathways from the
  Reactome Pathway Database involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (left) and provide
  a new, more direct regulatory route between two mitochondrial genes (right). Pathway
  and interaction information was provided by Pathway Commons (pathwaycommons.org),
  a web resource that provides a single point of access for multiple public interaction
  and pathway databases. Details regarding the generation of these networks can be
  found in the section “Visualization of network data across sources” in Materials
  and methods.
