caption: Molecular components of sugar signaling networks and their involvement in
  shoot growth. CKs, auxins and sugars function as long-distance signals. When photosynthesis
  takes place, sugars content increase in shoot and low sugars in roots implies that
  GAs are transported from the roots to the shoots and send sugars to the low sugar
  roots. Sucrose availability (high metabolic status) shows a good correlation with
  the level of plant T6P, which acts as an inhibitor of SnRK1. The active TOR kinase
  is important for C/S1-group bZIP protein synthesis and enhances translation and
  growth. Sucrose down-regulates the expression of C/S1-group bZIP at the translation
  level and the C/S1-bZIP transcription factor network is involved in the regulation
  of SnRK1 target genes (). The repression of ribosomal protein gene expression by
  SnRK1 () inhibits translation. Sucrose effects on auxin levels are more pronounced
  in roots than in shoots, suggesting sugars may impact auxin transport and/or conjugation
  pathways as well. DELLA and PIF proteins are good candidates for molecular hubs
  operating at the crossroads of many pathways (). There are NO and GA antagonist
  functions in the control of light-regulated photomorphogenesis through the balance
  between DELLAs and PIFs (). ERF1 has been suggested to function in light-regulated
  control of hypocotyl elongation, in a different way to the Cys-Arg/N-end rule pathway
  ().
