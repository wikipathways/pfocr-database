caption: The IL-17R complex is composed of IL-17RA and IL-17RC. Both subunits encode
  SEFIR domains , but a sequence similar to the TIR BB-loop is found only on IL-17RA,
  termed a TIR-like loop (TILL) . IL-17RA engages the SEFIR-containing ACT1 adaptor
  to mediate a variety of downstream events . Specifically, ACT1 is required for recruitment
  of TRAF6 (and possibly TRAF3), which is an essential upstream activator of the classical
  NF-κB pathway. It is not clear whether TRAF6 is also required for MAPK activation.
  Act1-/- cells fail to upregulate C/EBPβ (LAP and LAP* splice variants) and C/EBPδ
  as well, another event that might be downstream of NF-κB , . ACT1, but not TRAF6,
  is required for IL-17A-induced stabilization of several target mRNAs, particularly
  those encoding chemokines and cytokines . Interestingly, ERK might also be controlled,
  at least indirectly, by ACT1-independent pathways, as Act1-/- cells show strong
  upregulation of ERK phosphorylation 24 hours after IL-17A stimulation . ERK mediates
  rapid phosphorylation of C/EBPβ on Thr-188 . A second functional domain on IL-17RA
  is located in the C-terminal region, and is not required for efficient activation
  of NF-κB or the MAPK pathways. However, deletion of this domain results in impaired
  alternative translation of C/EBPβ from the LAP isoform to the LAP* isoform , and
  hence was termed the ”C/EBPβ-activation domain” (CBAD). The CBAD is also required
  for IL-17A-mediated inducible phosphorylation of C/EBPβ on Thr-179, which is mediated
  by GSK3β . B. Comparison of IL-17R and TLR/IL-1R signalling. IL-17R and TLR/IL-1R
  signalling differ in functional receptor motifs (SEFIR/TILL versus TIR) and proximal
  adaptors (ACT1 versus MYD88 and TRIF), but converge on common pathways (NF-κB, C/EBP
  and MAPK). Hence these receptors activate similar, although not identical, panels
  of downstream genes.
