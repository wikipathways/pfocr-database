caption: (A) The summary map of AHR–PIN. Functional modules were determined by the
  overlapped annotations from three experimental layers (domain influence, pharmacology
  clustering, and localization influence) as well as from network clustering. For
  each functional module, the main “stacking pattern” of experimental layers is noted
  in italics. Modifiers initially left outside the single large cluster of the AHR–PIN
  were assigned to corresponding functional modules by sharing the similar stacking
  pattern where applicable. See the legend of  for the color scheme of the nodes and
  links.(B) An expanded model of AHR signaling. The AHR signaling pathway is regulated
  by at least five functional modules that are involved in the control of receptor
  folding, nuclear translocation, transcriptional activation, receptor level, and
  a PASB-related nuclear event. Within each functional module, modifers intially enclosed
  in the single large cluster of the AHR–PIN are highlighted in bold. Known human
  homologs of the modifiers are noted at the side with a smaller font () . ARNT is
  dimmed because modifiers were identified in this study from an “ARNT-free” chimeric
  AHR system. See text for details.
