caption: Schematic diagram of the C. neoformans cell integrity pathway. Chitin synthase
  (Chs1) and β-1,3-glucan synthase (Fks1) contribute to the maintenance of normal
  cell wall integrity, a condition under which the cell integrity MAP kinase pathway
  is not activated. Nikkomycin Z and caspofungin inhibit C. neoformans chitin synthase
  and β-1,3-glucan synthase, respectively, leading to activation of the cell integrity
  MAP kinase Mpk1. The steps leading to Mpk1 activation may include the activity of
  cell wall sensors, the β-1,3-glucan synthase subunit Rho1 and protein kinase C.
  The Mpk1 pathway is important for survival of C. neoformans cells treated with nikkomycin
  Z or caspofungin. In the absence of calcineurin, Mpk1 partially protects C. neoformans
  cells from caspofungin treatment. Inhibition of calcineurin by FK506 leads to activation
  of Mpk1, possibly because of a cell wall defect caused by the lack of calcineurin
  function.
