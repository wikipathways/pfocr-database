caption: The SREBP pathway. Scheme of the mammalian SREBP pathway [adapted from ()].
  With sufficient sterol, the SREBP-SCAP complex is retained at the ER membrane due
  to SCAP interacting with Insig; when sterol levels decrease, the SREBP-SCAP complex
  is transported to the Golgi apparatus. In the Golgi apparatus, SREBP undergoes two
  sequential proteolytic cleavages by S1P and S2P. First, S1P (subtilisin-related
  serine protease) cleaves SREBP at the hydrophilic loop projected into the lumen
  of the Golgi apparatus, and then S2P (metallopeptidase) cuts SREBP within the first
  TM segment. This releases the N-terminal domain of SREBP (the activated transcription
  factor), which travels to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription of target genes,
  including genes required for the synthesis and uptake of sterols and other lipids.
  bHLH-ZIP represents the N-terminal domain of SREBP, containing the bHLH leucine
  zipper motif, and SRE denotes the sterol regulatory element. The illustrated S2P
  membrane topology was based on the results of Zelenski et al. (), and conserved
  residues in the motifs HEIGH and LDG involved in the coordination of the zinc atom
  are shown.
