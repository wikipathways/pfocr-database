caption: 'Schematic representation of the Pgp catalytic cycle and the possible functional
  role of the N- and the C-sites in drug translocation. In this model, the two TM
  domains and the ATP binding sites are represented by squares and circles, respectively.
  The model shows one cycle of ATP hydrolysis where the shaded circle represents the
  noncatalytic state. The two drug-interacting sites are along the drug-translocating
  pathway and are designated by two ellipses (shaded for ON-site and open for OFF-site).
  The cis(Z)-flupentixol (modulator) interaction site is depicted by the hexagon.
  The hatched ellipse indicates a conformational change in the drug-interaction site
  closer to the cytosolic phase of the lipid bilayer. The substrate molecule, cis(Z)-flupentixol
  and vanadate are shown as “D,” “F,” and “Vi,” respectively. The dark arrows represent
  favored reaction. Various states of Pgp during the catalytic/drug-translocation
  cycle are as follows: I, Pgp·MgATP; II, PgpMgATP·DON; IIA, PgpMgATP·DON·F; III,
  PgpMgADP·Pi·DOFF; IV, PgpMgADP·Pi; IVA, PgpMgADP·Vi.'
