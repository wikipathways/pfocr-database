caption: MK-8776 inhibits Chk1 autophosphorylation (Ser296) that is required for maintaining
  basal Chk1 activity during DNA replication in S phase. This action is enhanced by
  HDACIs, leading to disruption of the intra-S phase checkpoint in response to DNA
  replication stress. MK-8776/HDACI interactions may also be related to down-regulation/inactivation
  of multiple proteins involved in origin licensing of DNA replication initiation
  (e.g., Cdt1) and S-phase-related HR repair of DSB (i.e., the CtIP/BRCA1 pathway),
  resulting in pronounced DNA damage and apoptosis. Numbers (1 – 6) indicate potential
  sites targeted by HDACIs in interactions with MK-8776.
