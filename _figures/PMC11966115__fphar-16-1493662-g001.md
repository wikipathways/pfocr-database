caption: TGR5 in atherosclerosis. After using TGR5 receptor agonists (such as INT-777)
  treated cells, macrophages reduce the production of circulating factors and uptake
  of oxidized LDL via TGR5-induced cAMP signaling pathway and subsequent NF-κB inhibition,
  which may contribute to its anti-atherosclerotic effect
