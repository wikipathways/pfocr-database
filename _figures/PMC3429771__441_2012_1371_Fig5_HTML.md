caption: The opposing roles of FGF2 and BMP4 in directing TB formation from epiblast
  type ES cells and iPS cells and the need to exclude FGF2 from the growth medium
  to minimize the co-induction of mesoderm and endoderm. Also indicated are the potential
  values of including low molecular weight pharmaceutical agents that block activin
  A (INHBA) and FGF2 signaling to support BMP4-directed differentiation to TB. Whereas
  FGF2 and conditioned medium (CM) from mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which contains
  activin A and other growth factors, enable maintenance of the pluripotent state
  of epiESC (top left), adding high concentrations of BMP4 leads to TB differentiation
  and possibly also some endoderm and mesoderm differentiation (bottom left). We argue
  that when BMP4 is present with FGF2 the extent of emergence of TB will depend on
  the relative concentrations of the two growth factors. By contrast, a defined medium
  supplemented with BMP4, FGF2 and activin A appears mainly to generate endoderm (upper
  right). However, the same defined medium formulated for minimal activin A signaling
  gives rise predominantly to mesoderm (lower right). Addition of BMP4 but minimizing
  FGF2 contribution to signaling either by excluding it from the culture medium or
  blocking MEK1/2 signaling, strongly favors TB formation, as does the inhibition
  of the activin A-mediated SMAD2/3 pathway (triad cluster in center). Blocking signaling
  through both the SMAD2/3 and MEK1/2 pathways in the presence of BMP4 will most likely
  provide optimal, unidirectional differentiation towards TB and the HLAG+ /cytoTB
  and CG+/syncytioTB sublineages (dashed circle in center)
