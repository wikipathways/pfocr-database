caption: Model for the Pga1-mediated signal transduction pathway, showing the effectors
  AC and PKA previously reported in different fungi, along with newly identified effectors
  and proteins and their relation with the cellular processes regulated by Pga1. Thin
  solid arrows indicate steps in metabolic pathways, transport processes and established
  interactions of the fungal subgroup I Gα subunits. Dotted lines indicate positive
  (arrows) or negative (bars) effects on protein expression inferred from the results
  of this work. Red solid arrows indicate phosphorylation by PKA and PKC. Thick solid
  arrows indicate relation of identified proteins to cellular processes regulated
  by Pga1 signaling. brlA is the first gene of the central regulatory pathway of conidiogenesis,
  and is negatively regulated by Pga1 signaling []. pcbAB, pcbC and penDE are the
  three structural genes for penicillin biosynthesis, they are positively regulated
  by Pga1 signaling []
