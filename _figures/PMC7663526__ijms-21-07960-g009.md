caption: 'The proposed anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in the ray florets of chrysanthemum.
  The bold black lines indicate the biosynthetic pathway of cyanidin-based anthocyanins
  that are only accumulated in the ray florets of Chrysanthemum flowers. The abbreviations
  of enzyme names are as follows: CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase;
  F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase;
  F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase, DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin
  synthase; and UFGT, UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase.'
