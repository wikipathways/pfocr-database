caption: (A) For dauer formation in C. elegans the daf-2/IGFR receptor lies upstream
  of a PI3 kinase signaling cascade consisting of age-1/PI3 kinase, the phosphoinoside-dependent
  kinase pdk-1, and the protein kinase B family kinases akt-1 and akt-2. Both AKT-1
  and AKT-2 act to phosphorylate DAF-16/FOXO and prevent entry of this protein into
  the nucleus. Inhibition of AKT-1 leads to entry of DAF-16/FOXO into the nucleus
  without the activation of DAF-16 target genes. This suggested that other pathways
  acted to control the transcriptional activity of nuclear DAF-16/FOXO. The eak genes
  are a group of structurally unrelated genes which act in a cell non-autonomous manner
  to restrain the transcriptional activity of nuclear DAF-16/FOXO through an undefined
  molecular mechanism. (B) Tyrosine is degraded to fumarate and acetoacetate via a
  five step degradation pathway. Shown are the names and structures of the intermediates
  as well as the names of the enzymes which catalyze each step. Also shown are mutant
  alleles affecting enzymes in the pathway that are studied in this work.
