caption: Methodology used to investigate factors that affect mutant EGFR dependency
  in NSCLC. (A) Commonly detected EGFR mutations in NSCLC patients. (B) Mutant EGFR
  drives signaling through the RAS/MAPK pathway, the PI3K/AKT pathway, and the STAT3
  pathway. The combined result is a promotion of cell proliferation, cell survival,
  angiogenesis, and increased migration and invasion. (C) High throughput screening
  techniques used to identify dependencies of EGFR mutant NSCLC. EGFR mutant cells
  are screened by transducing them with lentivirus containing CRISPR guides, shRNAs,
  and/or ORFs of varying coverage across the genome. The cells are then treated with
  EGFR TKIs, left to proliferate, then harvested and sequenced, to which guides/shRNAs/ORFs
  are enriched or depleted in the population of cells that survives the selective
  pressure of EGFR TKIs. Determinants of EGFR dependency are also screened for by
  treating cells with a library of drugs or miRNA libraries in combination with EGFR
  TKIs and examining which drugs/miRNAs synergize with or antagonize EGFR inhibitors.
  EGFR dependencies are also investigated by using bioinformatics profiling approaches.
  Using sequencing data, gene protein interaction data, and drug-protein interaction
  maps, researchers can determine proteins that are associated with drug-resistant
  phenotypes and which drugs target those genes. (D) Cell lines used for the study
  of EGFR dependencies and their EGFR mutation status. Figure made with BioRender.
