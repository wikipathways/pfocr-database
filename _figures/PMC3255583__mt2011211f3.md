caption: The anti-inflammatory effects of human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs)
  and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) in a mouse
  model of zymosan-induced peritonitis. (1) Zymosan-activated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
  signaling in resident macrophages via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). (2) Activation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway increased the production of proinflammatory cytokines
  to initiate the cascade of proinflammatory cytokines that was amplified by mesothelial
  cells and other cells of the peritoneum. (3) The proinflammatory cytokines also
  activated the hMSCs to secrete TSG-6. (4) TSG-6 decreased TLR2/NF-κB signaling in
  the resident macrophages through a direct interaction with CD44 or in a complex
  with hyaluronan. The amplification of the proinflammatory signals by mesothelial
  cells to recruit neutrophils was modulated by a negative feedback loop introduced
  by hMSCs and TSG-6. Reprinted with permission from the American Society of Hematology.
