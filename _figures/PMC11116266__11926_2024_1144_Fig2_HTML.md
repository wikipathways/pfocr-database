caption: JAK STAT signaling proteins in spondyloarthropathy and possible mechanisms
  of action of the JAK inhibitors. As illustrated in this Fig. 2 and the Table 1,
  various inflammatory cytokines including interferons, interleukins, interferon-like
  cytokines, growth factors, and colony-stimulating factors; bind to their specific
  receptors resulting in activation of specific JAK-STAT pathways. Specifically, IL-2,
  IL-9, IL-12, IL-21, and IL-23 are well known to have contributing roles in the pathogenesis
  of spondyloarthritis (SpA). It also demonstrates how the new generation of JAK inhibitors
  can block a specific JAK kinase and thus can be used for treatment of SpA
