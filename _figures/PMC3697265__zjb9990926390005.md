caption: Pathways for assimilation of exogenous acetate. (A) Standard pathways for
  assimilating exogenous acetate; (B) pathway for the test strain used to examine
  microcompartment function. The housekeeping enzymes Pta and Acs were genetically
  removed, leaving a strain that possesses AckA but lacks a complete route from acetate
  to acetyl-CoA. Induction of the ethanolamine operon leads to production of the EutD
  protein but does not allow growth on acetate (left line from acetyl-PO4), unless
  the compartment is disrupted by mutations that remove shell proteins (right arrow
  from acetyl-PO4).
