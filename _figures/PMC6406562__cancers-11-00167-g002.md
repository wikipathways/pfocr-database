caption: 'Model of the effect of the Ras/Erk vs. the PI3k/Akt pathways. mT binds to,
  activates and is phosphorylated by Src family kinases. The mT-pY250 site binds the
  Shc adaptor which triggers activation of the Ras/Erk pathway, leading to GJIC suppression.
  The mT-pY315 site binds the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3k, triggering activation
  of Akt, leading to GJIC increase. Upon wt-mT expression the Ras pathway prevails
  with elimination of communication as a result. Interestingly, neoplastic transformation
  by mT requires both pathways. Not shown: mT-pY322 activates PLCγ and PKC, which
  suppresses GJIC.'
