caption: Contributions of Fd and FNR to photosynthetic electron transport in (a) the  mesophyll
  cell chloroplasts and (b) the bundle sheath cell chloroplasts of  maize. Protein
  structures shown where known, or grey boxes where not. Electron transfer  reactions
  shown as labeled pink arrows. In the linear photosynthetic electron  transport chain,
  water is split at photosystem II (PSII), releasing electrons  that are accepted
  by plastoquinone (PQ) (1), which transfers them to the  cytochrome b6f complex (Cytb6f)
  (2).  Plastocyanin (PC) carries these electrons through the thylakoid lumen to  photosystem
  I (PSI) (3), where they are donated to ferredoxin (Fd). Fd can  donate these electrons
  to multiple enzymes, including Fd:NADP(H) oxidoreductase  (FNR) (4), which then
  photoreduces NADP+. In addition to this linear  electron flow (LEF), Fd may return
  electrons to the membrane via either PGRL1  (the antimycin A sensitive pathway)
  or the NAD(P)H complex (NDH) dependent  pathway (5). Both linear and cyclic electron
  flow generate the pH gradient  necessary for ATP synthesis, but only the linear
  path results in release of  electrons into stromal metabolism. Maize bundle sheath
  cells have very high  rates of cyclic electron flow. This is facilitated by the
  presence of very  little active PSII, a Fd iso-protein (FdII) specific for the cyclic
  pathway, and  elevated amounts of the NDH complex. Moreover, only two FNR iso-proteins,
  FNR1  and FNR2, are present, and these are tightly bound to the membrane by the  thylakoid
  rhodanase like protein (TROL) and also associated with Cytb6f,  although their precise
  role in cyclic electron flow remains to be established.  By contrast, the mesophyll
  cells have abundant, active PSII and relatively low  amounts of the NDH complex.
  In combination with the specific Fd iso-protein,  Fd1, this facilitates LEF. In
  the mesophyll three FNR proteins are present,  FNR1, FNR2 and FNR3. All of FNR3
  and a large proportion of FNR2 is soluble, and  presumably involved in linear NADP+
  photoreduction.
