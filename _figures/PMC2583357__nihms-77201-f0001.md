caption: The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Raf/MEK/ERK PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and pathways are
  regulated by upstream growth factor and mitogen receptors as well as Ras and various
  kinases. Many kinases serve to phosphorylate S/T and Y residues on Raf and S/T residues
  on Akt. Some of the Raf phosphorylation events serve to enhance its activity (shown
  by a black P in a white circle) whereas others serve to inhibit its activity (shown
  by a white P in a black circle. Moreover there are phosphatases such as PP2A, PTEN,
  SHIP and PHLPP, which remove phosphates on certain regulatory residues on Raf, MEK,
  ERK, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Akt as well as other signaling molecules. The PI3K/Akt
  pathway is also activated after receptor ligation. Akt and ERK have many downstream
  targets which serve to regulate cell growth and apoptosis. Some of the downstream
  transcription factors regulated by these pathways are indicated in diamond shaped
  outlines.
