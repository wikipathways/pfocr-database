caption: Proposed metabolic pathway for the microbial degradation of RB5. The initial
  azo bond cleavage is catalyzed by NADH-DCIP reductase, producing aromatic amines
  including 1,2,7-triamino-8-hydroxy-3,6-naphthalene disulfonate and 1-sulphonic-2-(4-aminobenzenesulphonyl)
  ethanol. Subsequent desulfonation, deamination, and oxidation steps lead to the
  formation of simpler intermediates such as aniline, naphthalene, benzoic acid, and
  phthalic anhydride. These are further metabolized through ring fission into TCA
  cycle precursors, eventually resulting in complete mineralization into CO₂ and H₂O
