caption: Circulating Dilps, in conjunction with dietary amino acids, promote Dilp6
  production by surface glial cells. This ligand activates InR on the surface of cholinergic
  neurons, in close proximity to both the glia and the IPCs. IIS within cholinergic
  neurons leads to Jeb secretion, which activates the Alk receptor on IPCs. Downstream
  activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway leads to phosphorylation and nuclear
  exclusion of Foxo. In the absence of IIS, nuclear Foxo negatively regulates the
  Ey and Dac transcription factors to suppress dilp5 expression. IPC-derived Dilps
  are secreted into the hemolymph via projections to the circulatory system (represented
  by the open arrow), completing the positive feedback loop.
