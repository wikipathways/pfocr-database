caption: Simplified model showing the UV radiation signaling pathways in plants and
  their possible links to an epigenetic based memory. (A) The MAP kinase MPK3 and
  MPK6 signaling pathway can be activated by UV stress whereas MKP1 suppresses the
  activation. (B) UVR8 signaling pathway, the dimerization of the UV photoreceptor
  UVR8 with COP1 upregulates the expression of UV targets genes including HY5 and
  HYH which activate further UV response genes. In turn, the expression of RUP1 and
  RUP2 establish a negative feedback loop by direct protein binding. (C) HY5 can upregulate
  the expression of enzymes involved in flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis. (D)
  Change of antagonistic epigenetic marks to light and UV stress could be part of
  an epigenetic memory but it remains unclear whether the activation of the MKP1/MPK3/MPK6
  (A) or the UVR8 signaling pathway (B) by UV can establish persistent chromatin modifications.
  The phytohormone SA (E) can prime response genes by setting H3K4me3 at their loci
  that increase the transcriptional response (B) by a second stress. (E) UV-B promotes
  the accumulation of ROS that induces the production of phytohormones including SA,
  JA, and Et. High ROS concentration cause senescence and cell death. (F) UV radiation
  can cause cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and DNA double strand breaks that can trigger
  cell death (E). DNA damage repair pathways involve chromatin modifications including
  histone acetylation and remodeling to correct UV induced DNA lesions. There is a
  potential link between DNA repairs (F) and epigenetic memory (D). CHI, CHALCONE
