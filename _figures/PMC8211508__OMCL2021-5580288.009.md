caption: Proposed model of minimal completeness of cell death signaling induced by
  TPGS as a mechanistic explanation of CML cell demise. The TPGS (step 1) triggers
  a cell death subroutine in K562, a well-established model of CML. Once TPGS enters
  the cell, it is metabolically processed by cytoplasmic esterases and converted into
  alpha-tocopherol acetate (α-TOS, s2). This compound targets mitochondrial complex
  I or II (s3), resulting in an over generation of ROS-H2O2 (s4). The signaling molecule
  H2O2 either oxidized the oxidative sensor protein DJ-1-Cys106-SH into DJ-1-SO3 (s5)
  or indirectly activated prodeath kinases (ASK-1 (s6) and MKK4 (s7)) and JNK (s8),
  which in turn activate c-JUN (s9). This transcription factor transcribes proapoptotic
  PUMA (s10), contributing to the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane
  (s11). Mitochondrial damage allows the release of apoptogenic proteins such as cytochrome
  c and ATP, which are responsible for the formation of an apoptosome complex (s12)
  and activation of caspase-3 protease (s13). This protease in turn activates the
  endonucleases DFF40/CAD, by cutting the nuclease's inhibitor DFF45/ICAD. Finally,
  DFF40/CAD causes nuclear chromatin fragmentation (s14), typical of apoptosis. Remarkably,
  the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC, red stop signs in s4), the specific JNK inhibitor
  SP600125 (red stop sign in s8), and the specific caspase-3 inhibitor NSCI (red stop
  sign in s13) block TPGS-induced apoptosis in K562 ratifying the involvement of OS
  signaling and caspase-3 as end-executor protein in the apoptotic pathway in this
  leukemia cell line. The TPGS-induced cell death mechanism provides the basis for
  an oxidative therapy strategy to combat leukemia.
