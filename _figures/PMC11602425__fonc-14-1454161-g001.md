caption: Metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells. Tumor cells actively acquire glucose
  and other nutrients from the tumor microenvironment, and key metabolic pathways,
  such as the PPP and lactic acid fermentation, become hyperactivated. Additionally,
  mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming allows lipids and amino acids to be metabolized
  through the TCA cycle, generating abundant small-molecule products. These products
  provide essential substrates and energy to support cell proliferation, migration,
  invasion, and other malignant behaviors. Metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells
  encompasses diverse pathways, including glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism,
  enabling them to meet the demands of rapid growth and survival in hostile environments
