caption: Schematic diagram of microglial responses to ischemia/reperfusion based on
  our in vitro and in vivo datasets. A, When primary microglia in culture are exposed
  to H/H–N/N, TLR4 is activated, presumably by DAMPs that are released from the H/H–N/N-exposed
  microglia. This leads to TLR4- and IFNAR1-dependent ISG expression. Our pSTAT1 assay
  data in microglia indicates that H/H–N/N exposure alters the phosphorylation state
  of STAT1, a key mediator in the canonical type I IFN signaling pathway (; ). Following
  the canonical pathway (; ; ), which most likely results in the formation of the
  ISGF3 TF (shown in gray shaded colors to indicate that this component of the pathway
  requires further investigation) and transcriptional upregulation of ISGs. Although
  we did not detect release of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) by cultured microglia in response
  to H/H, it is possible that low concentrations of type I IFNs (and/or type 1 IFN
  variants not detected by ELISA) are released that signal via IFNAR (). After extended
  periods of H/H, we observed a downregulation of IFNAR1 surface expression, which
  may be due to endosomal sequestration and/or degradation of the surface receptor
  (shown in gray; ; ; ). B, In response to stimulation with TLR4 agonists such as
  LPS or HSP70, cultured microglia release type I IFNs and stimulate the transcription
  of ISGs, as well as the secretion of ISG chemokines such as CXCL10 and CCL5, into
  the culture medium. TLR4 is capable of initiating directly TFs that bind to NFκB
  cis elements in the promoters of CXCL10 and CCL5 (; ), whereas TLR4-induced type
  I IFNs mediate signaling via IFNAR and ISRE cis elements, which are also found in
  the promoters of CXCL10 and CCL5 (; ). The ISG chemokines are then translated and
  secreted as indicated. C, In response to IFN-β, microglia also demonstrate robust
  upregulation of multiple ISGs and dose-dependent secretion of CXCL10 and CCL5. IFN-β
  also induces phosphorylation of STAT1, indicating that signaling proceeds via the
  canonical type I IFN pathway (shown in gray). D, The in vivo response to ischemia/reperfusion
  is similar to the in vitro response to H/H–N/N in that both result in a broad and
  robust IFNAR1-dependent ISG response. However, in contrast to the in vitro response
  to H/H–N/N, we find that TLR4 is not required for ischemia/reperfusion-induced ISG
  expression in vivo. Our data suggest instead that TLR4 might have a slight restraining
  effect on ISG expression or it could be complementary to IFNAR1 in the presence
  of type I IFNs, which are likely released by other cells of the CNS (; ), including
  astrocytes and neurons (shown in gray). After IFNAR1 is activated by type I IFNs,
  signaling proceeds, most likely through the canonical pathway involving pSTAT1 and
  ISGF3 (shown in gray), which induces the transcription of multiple ISGs.
