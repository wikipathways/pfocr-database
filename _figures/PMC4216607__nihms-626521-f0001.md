caption: 'Panel A: WNT pathway. The extracellular ligand WNT binds to the receptor
  Frizzled (FRZ), leading to inhibition of the GSK3β, AXIN and APC mediated phosphorylation
  and degradation of betacatenin in the cytoplasm. Free beta-catenin can then translocate
  to the nucleus where it activates expression of pro-proliferative genes, including
  CYCLIN D1 and MYC.Panel B: SHH pathway. In canonical Hedgehog signaling, SHHbinds
  to its receptor PTCH, relieving PTCH inhibition of SMO. This allows SMO to initiate
  activation of GLI2, which can then translocate to the nucleus and drive transcription
  of target genes, such as GLI1.Panel C: MYC pathway. Signaling through receptor tyrosine
  kinases, enhanced WNT pathway activation, and gene amplification all lead to increased
  levels of MYC. MYC protein translocates to the nucleus, where it heterodimerizes
  with the E-box protein MAX.'
