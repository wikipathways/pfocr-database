  lactate to fuel the TCA cycle that supports oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria.
  Intra-tumoral Tregs increase the fatty acid receptor CD36 when extracellular lactate
  concentrations increase. The import of fatty acids activates the transcription factor
  PPARβ to maintain mitochondrial fitness. Other transported nutrients are amino acids.
  ASCT2, a neutral amino acid transporter, is responsible for the intake of amino
  acids such as alanine, serine, glutamine. Serine uptake and biosynthesis (serine
  synthesis pathway – SSP) are involved in antioxidant defence in Tregs. The amino
  acids, alanine and aspartate, can enter central carbon metabolism through transamination
  by glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase
  (GOT), both of which are negative regulators of FoxP3 induction. Both GOT and GPT
  are inhibited by the transaminase inhibitor, aminooxyacetate (AOA). Another negative
  regulator is alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG) which can be converted by the error-prone
  isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). 2-HG inhibits the family
  of DNA demethylases – ten eleven translocase (TET) 1-3. Another amino acid that
  can enter the TCA cycle is arginine which is transported by the cationic transporter
  (CAT1). Arginine helps fuel the urea cycle, where arginase (ARG2) converts arginine
  to ornithine and later citrulline. The transport of branched chain amino acids (BCAA),
  and aromatic amino acids, such as isoleucine and tryptophan, use the L-type amino
  acid transporter (LAT1). BCAA can help fuel the TCA either through acetyl CoA or
  succinate generation. Tryptophan (TRP) can be converted into kynurenine by the Indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) in dendritic or tumor cells, which activates the ligand receptor,
  Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR). Ligand-bound AhR translocates to the nucleus and
  upregulates Foxp3 expression.

  description: Lactate and amino acid metabolism in Tregs. Lactate and amino acid
    metabolism in Tregs play important roles in their differentiation and function.
    Lactate can arise in the tumors and from cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs)

    are SLC5a12 and MCT1. Tregs metabolically adapt to a low glucose/high lactate

    activates the transcription factor PPARβ to maintain mitochondrial fitness. Other
    transported nutrients are amino acids. ASCT2, a neutral amino acid transporter,
    is responsible for the intake of amino acids such as alanine, serine, glutamine.
    Serine uptake and biosynthesis (serine synthesis pathway – SSP) are involved in
