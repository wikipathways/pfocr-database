caption: 'Schematic diagrams of midsagittal sections through (A) the rainbow trout
  and (B) rat brains to summarize the contributions and interactions of the serotonergic
  and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) systems in the regulation of food intake.
  Serotonergic (5-HT) neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) can directly stimulate
  the release of CRF from the nucleus preoptic (NPO) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN)
  in fish and mammals, respectively. In mammals, 5-HT neurons also activate arcuate
  nucleus (ARC) neurons to facilitate the release of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R)
  agonist α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (αMSH) and inhibit the release of the MC4R
  antagonist agouti-related peptide (AgRP). CRF neurons in the PVN act as a downstream
  mediator of MC4R signaling and contribute to the regulation of food intake. In fish,
  while the anorexigenic actions of αMSH also appear to be mediated by the CRF-signaling
  pathway, the interactions between 5-HT and the melanocortin system have yet to be
  investigated. Also unknown are the roles of urotensin I (UI) and urocortin (UCN)
  secreting neurons as mediators of either the direct or indirect anorexigenic actions
  of 5-HT. Although CRF and UI/UCN have anorexigenic actions and both the CRF type
  1 (CRF-R1) and type 2 (CRF-R2) receptors have been implicated in the regulation
  of food intake, the higher affinity of UI/UCN than CRF for CRF-R2 likely explains
  why UI/UCN more potently inhibits food intake than CRF (see text for further details).
