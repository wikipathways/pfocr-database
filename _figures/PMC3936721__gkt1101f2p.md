caption: Assembly of 3-, 4- and 5-gene carotenoid biosynthetic pathways. (A) The E.
  coli host genes idi and dxs encode enzymes necessary for the production of IPP and
  DMAPP. IPP and DMAPP are converted to geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate
  (FPP) by further E. coli enzymes. The products of the crtE, crtB, crtI, crtY and
  crtZ genes from P. ananas convert FPP via geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and
  phytoene to the coloured carotenoids lycopene (red), β-carotene (yellow–orange)
  and zeaxanthin (yellow). (B) Assembly of the three-gene lycopene, four-gene β-carotene
  and five-gene zeaxanthin biosynthetic pathways by SIRA. The diagrams show the arrangement
  of att sites used on each fragment for ordered assembly of genes into pSIRA1. The
  photographs show cell pellets from one correctly assembled construct (coloured)
  and one incorrectly assembled construct (white) for each pathway. The percentages
  of transformant colonies that were coloured or white are shown below each pellet.
  Cell pellets from 4- and 5-gene assemblies had similar colours, but restriction
  analysis confirmed that plasmids from these reactions all had the expected 4- and
  5-gene structures.
