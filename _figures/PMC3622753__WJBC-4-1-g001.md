  from growth medium to differentiation medium S100B becomes downregulated by the
  decrease in serum mitogens and activation of the promyogenic p38 MAPK, that likely
  stimulates S100B proteasomal degradation. However, S100B becomes re-expressed in
  differentiated myoblasts under the action of myogenin; D: S100B is induced in chondroblasts

  by an unidentified mechanism (X), interacts with and activates a Src/PI3K pathway
  that stimulates RhoA/ROCK thereby promoting stress fiber formation and cell migration
  and Akt thereby inhibiting GSK3β resulting in stimulation of proliferation and inhibition
  of differentiation. Interaction of S100B with IQGAP1 results in activation of Rac1
  responsible for lamellipodia formation during migration. The S100B/IQGAP1/Rac1 interaction
  may also results in an enhancement of cell-cell adhesion as observed in neurospheres
  (see text). EGF represses S100B expression during early phases of astrocyte differentiation,

  response via inhibition of PKC'
