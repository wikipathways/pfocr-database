caption: Schematic diagram of prediction of angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4)-related
  signaling proteins and pathways in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The major signaling
  actor ANGPTL4 interacts with putative signaling proteins DNA-dependent protein kinase
  catalytic subunit (PRKDC) and 60S ribosomal protein L21 (RPL21) via predicted molecules
  AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (MTOR),
  and ribosomal protein L5 (RPL5), and is involved in CCA cells proliferation by the
  non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway and ribosome signaling pathway. Previous
  studies showed that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) (32) and hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1α (HIF-1α) (11) induced ANGPTL4 expression. Curcumin inhibited ANGPTL4 expression
  in anoikis-resistant CCA cells (18). MK-2206 (AKT inhibitor) (33) and celecoxib
  (cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor) (34, 35) inhibited CCA cell proliferation by inhibiting
  AKT1 protein.
