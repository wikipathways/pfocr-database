caption: Intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Apoptosis pathways may be
  initiated in the mitochondria (intrinsic pathway) and on the plasma membrane by
  death receptor ligation (extrinsic pathway). The intrinsic pathway is initiated
  intracellularly, and pro-apoptotic proteins are released from the mitochondria to
  activate caspase proteases and trigger apoptosis (,). The extrinsic pathway mainly
  comprises two branches, namely, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced apoptosis and
  Fas-Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis (). The stimulation of death receptors (DRs) leads
  to receptor aggregation and recruitment of the adaptor molecule Fas-associated death
  domain (FADD) and procaspase-8, which subsequently becomes activated and initiates
  apoptosis by direct cleavage of downstream effector caspases (). JNK, c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; MEKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; Puma, p53 upregulated modulator
  of apoptosis; TRADD, TNF receptor-associated death domain protein; TRAF2, TNF receptor-associated
  factor 2; TNFR1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; Apaf-1, apoptotic protease activating
  factor-1; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma-2; Bid, BH3 interacting domain death agonist; Smac/DIABLO,
  second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase; cIAPs, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis
  proteins; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex.
