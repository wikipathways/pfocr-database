caption: Overview of the major immune cell checkpoints and associated signaling pathways.
  Antigen presentation via MHC on APCs to the TCR complex on T cells executes activation
  of T cells via Zap70 and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. Ligation of CD28 on T cells
  with CD80/86 on APCs provides co-stimulatory signals. PD-1/PD-L and CTLA-4 signaling
  impair T cell activation via inhibition of the AKT signaling pathway. PD-1signaling
  involves SHP mediated inhibition of Zap20 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, whereas
  CTLA-4 directly inhibits the AKT pathway via recruiting PP2A. 2B4, TIM3, BTLA, and
  LAG-3 also inhibit T cell activation through interaction with their associated ligands
  on APCs. Ox40-Ox40L serves as a co-stimulatory signal for T cells via PI3K/AKT and
  NFkB pathways. Red lines represent inhibitory signals while green represents stimulatory
  signals. ITSM, ITIM, KIEELE represent specific intracellular domains of the immune
  checkpoints which mediate their intracellular signaling APC, antigen presenting
  cell; HVEM, herpes virus entry mediator; MHC, Major histocompatibility complex;
  BTLA, B and T lymphocyte attenuator; TIM3, T cell membrane protein-3; LAG-3, Lymphocyte
  activation-gene-3; TCR, T cell receptor; PD-1, Programmed death-1; CTLA4, Cytotoxic
  T lymphocyte antigen-4; ITSM, Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Motif; ZAP70, Zeta Chain
  of T Cell Receptor Associated Protein Kinase 70; PI3K, Phosphoinositide 3 kinase;
  ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif; SHP, Src homology region 2
  domain-containing phosphatase; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; TRAF, TNF receptor
  associated factor; ERK, Extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen activated
