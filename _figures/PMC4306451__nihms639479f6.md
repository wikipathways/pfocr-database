caption: PS exposed on the surface of the apoptotic cell interacts with and induces
  oligomerization of PSR-1, which then transduces the “eat-me” signal through interacting
  with CED-5 and CED-12, leading to the activation of the CED-10 GTPase and membrane
  extension of the phagocyte to enclose and internalize the apoptotic cell. At least
  one unknown phagocyte receptor (?) acts in parallel to PSR-1 in this signaling pathway.
