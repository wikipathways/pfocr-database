caption: 'Glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the fragmented TCA cycle, anaplerotic reactions
  and global regulators involved in metabolism. Schematic overview of the glycolysis,
  gluconeogenesis, the fragmented TCA cycle showing the oxidative and the reductive
  pathway, including anaplerotic reactions as well as global regulators controlling
  the central metabolism. Global regulators are marked by colored dots, ATP producing
  and reducing equivalent consuming/producing reactions are marked by colored arrows.
  (BP: bisphosphate, P: phosphate, Ac: Acetyl, -OH: -hydroxy). Dashed arrows represent
  multiple reactions.'
