caption: Under conditions of ambient hyperglycemia (panel (A)), sodium-glucose co-transporter
  2 activity (SGLT2) is increased, thereby reducing the juxtaglomerular apparatus
  delivery of Na+. This affects the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms, as the concentration
  of Na+ that transits across the juxtaglomerular apparatus establishes the adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP) release and its breakdown to adenosine. Local adenosine concentration
  acts by vaso-constricting afferent arteriole. Thus, any adenosine concentration
  decrease may impact the appropriate regulation of glomerular blood flow and of glomerular
  filtration pressure and, therefore, of renal metabolic work. An unfavorable consequence
  of the higher metabolic work is the increased cortical oxidative stress-induced
  tubulointerstitial damage that causes a fall in erythropoietin production []. The
  adenosine generation in the juxtaglomerular apparatus is linked to a large network
  of biological effects such as the control of renin release; therefore, a decreased
  breakdown of ATP in the juxtaglomerular apparatus may lead to enhanced ATII generation.
  Angiotensin II not only affects the circulation balance systemically, but also compromises
  the glomerulotubular balance by restraining the efferent arteriole section and the
  glomerular capillary surface area. All together, these responses account for the
  incremental neural transmitter release, leading to the exceedingly high renal norepinephrine
  spillover occurring in heart failure progression []. Under these conditions, the
  SGLT2 inhibition (B), by inducing glucoresis and natriuresis, is able to re-establish
  the distal tubular flow and Na+ delivery to the juxtaglomerular apparatus. In this
  way, SGLT2 inhibition restores local adenosine generation that reestablishes the
  afferent arteriole tone, leading to lower filtration pressure and to lower metabolic
  work while it restores control on neuroendocrine pathway. See text for details.
  SGLT2 = sodium-glucose co-transporter-2; VO2 = Oxygen consumption; ATII = angiotensin
  II; EPO = erythropoietin.
