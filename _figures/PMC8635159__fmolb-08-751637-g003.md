caption: The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) is responsible for the production
  of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), the substrate for protein glycosylation.
  Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) producing glucose-6-phosphate, which
  is converted into fructose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucose isomerase (GPI). At this
  point (F6P) can come into the HBP or continue through glycolysis to produce pyruvate.
  In the rate limiting step of the HBP (GFPT1/GFAT) -glutamine-fructose-aminotransferase
  catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate and the amino group donor, glutamine
  to glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6P) and glutamate (Glu). The subsequent reaction
  is catalyzed by glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNPNAT1) transform
  glucosamine-6-phosphate and acetyl-coenzyme A (Ac-CoA) to N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate
  (GlcNAc-1P) and CoA. Then, the phosphoglucomutase 3 (PGM3/AGM1) converts (GlcNAc-6P)
  to N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1P). The following enzymatic reaction
  UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1(UAP1) utilizes GlcNAc-1P and UTP for
  the synthesis of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), Enzymes are
  involved (blue ovals), Thiamet G is an inhibitor of enzyme O-GlcNAcase.
