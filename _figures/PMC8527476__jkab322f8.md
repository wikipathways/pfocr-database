caption: Summary of the regulatory influences of Grx4 on the responses to stress mediated
  by Mpk1, Crz1, and calcineurin. The diagram highlights the influence of Grx4 on
  traits related to virulence (e.g., thermotolerance, cell wall architecture, membrane
  and ER stress, and ion homeostasis). These traits are shown connected to the cell
  wall integrity pathway through an influence of Grx4 on Mpk1 phosphorylation. Connections
  to shared phenotypes with mutants defective in calcineurin signaling are depicted
  including an influence on the nuclear localization of the transcription factor Crz1.
