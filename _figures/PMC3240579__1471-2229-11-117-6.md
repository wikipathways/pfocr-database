caption: Proposed model for effect of the R69L substitution on interaction specificity
  with protein partners and consequently on trans-activation properties of VvMYB5b
  in tobacco flowers. X, Y and Z indicate endogenous transcription factors expressed
  in corolla and/or stamens of tobacco flowers. MYB is a tobacco endogenous transcription
  factor normally expressed in petals and involved in anthocyanin synthesis in cooperation
  with endogenous partner, such as a bHLH protein. In transgenic petals, both VvMYB5b
  (mutated or normal) are able to recognize endogenous partners and to activate promoters
  of CHS and ANS encoding genes. In the particular case of NtDFR promoter, our results
  suggest the R69L mutation may change the DNA binding specificity of the protein
  complex, because VvMYB5bL activated NtDFR transcription, contrary to VvMYB5R. In
  wild-type stamens, anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway is not active, but transcription
  factors (Y) involved in other processes should be present. In transgenic stamens,
  VvMYB5bR may be able to recognize this(ese) partner(s) to activate promoters, while
  VvMYB5bL may not. Putative WDR factors, which have been shown in numerous models
  to be part of the complex, are not indicated in the figure.
