caption: Schematic representations of the components and signaling pathways induced
  by pathogens for activating the Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin rearrangements. Listeria
  can stimulate the Arp2/3 complex by direct interaction between the bacterial ActA
  protein and the Arp2/3 complex. Other pathogens, such as Shigella, EPEC, and vaccinia
  viruses, exploit their own unique protein to modulate the signaling pathway for
  inducing a common actin driving system with the N-WASP–Arp2/3 complex.
