caption: Insulin, IGF-I and IGF-II signaling through the IGF-IR. IGF-I, IGF-II and,
  to a lesser extent insulin, bind IGF-IR at the α subunit, leading to autophosphorylation
  of β subunit residues, which then act as docking sites for the insulin receptor
  substrates (IRS)1–4 and other signaling proteins, such as Shc, phospholipase C γ1
  (PLCγ1) and Gab1. IRS-1 recruits the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) which through the catalytic effects of its p110 subunit, phosphorylates
  to activate protein kinase B (Akt), S6 kinase (S6K) and the mitogen activated protein
  kinase/ extracellular signal regulated kinase (MAP/ERK) pathway. Akt is recruited
  to the cell membrane and is phosphorylated by phosphoinositide-dependent protein
  kinase (PDK)-1. Activated Akt has many substrates, including the forkhead transcription
  factors (FKHR), Mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2), Bcl2-antagonist of cell death (BAD),
  NFκB and p53. These factors are chiefly involved in the regulation of apoptosis.
  Akt also regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating tuberous sclerosis protein
  (TSC2), releasing its inhibition of Rheb to activate the mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR). mTOR targets S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding
  protein-1 (4E-BP-1). The phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc can also lead to recruitment
  of growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb2), Son of Sevenless (SOS) and Ras,
  with subsequent activation of Raf-1, MEK1/2 (MAP/ERK kinase 1/2) and ERK 1/2 by
  phosphorylation. Activation of this pathway leads to cell proliferation. The tumor
  suppressor gene PTEN inhibits mTOR, PI3K and Shc. AMPK also inhibits mTOR, by activating
  the TSC1/2 complex in addition to directly inhibiting mTOR.
