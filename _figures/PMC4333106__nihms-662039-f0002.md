caption: Canonical and alternative androgen biosynthesis pathways. Androgens are synthesized
  from cholesterol via multiple enzymatic steps, most of which are catalyzed by members
  of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family. CYP11A1 is responsible for side chain cleavage
  of cholesterol, converting cholesterol to pregnenolone. Pregnenolone is then metabolized
  to dehydro-epiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione (AD) via CYP17A1, which catalyzes
  both the 17 α-hydroxylation and the subsequent 17,20-lyase cleavage. The ‘canonical
  pathway’ for testosterone synthesis involves conversion of the major adrenal androgen
  DHEA and AD to testosterone in the testis, followed by irreversible 5α-reduction
  of testosterone to the higher affinity ligand DHT by 5α-reductases (SRD5A). 5α-reduction
  of upstream steroids, as opposed to 5α-reduction of testosterone, leads to DHT synthesis
  that bypasses testosterone through at least two pathways. In the ‘androstanedione
  pathway’, AD may be converted to 5-androstanedione by SRD5A that can then be converted
  into DHT by 17βHSD(s). Another alternative pathway to DHT occurs when 17-hydroxyprogesterone
  accumulates and SRD5A enzymes are present. In this alternative or ‘backdoor’ pathway,
  17-hydroxyprogesterone is 5α- and 3α- reduced before the 17,20-lyase reaction of
  CYP17A1, yielding the 5α-reduced androgen androsterone. This pathway yields DHT
  without using DHEA, AD and testosterone as intermediates.
