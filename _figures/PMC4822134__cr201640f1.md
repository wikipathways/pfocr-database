caption: Main signaling pathways of PRRs. A common signaling feature of different
  PRRs is the dependence on adaptor molecules. TLRs, except TLR3, associate with MyD88,
  which in turn recruits and activates IRAK4, leading to phosphorylation of IRAK1
  and IRAK1-mediated activation of the downstream adaptor TRAF6. TLR3 and TLR4 associate
  with TRIF and activate the downstream adaptor RIP1. Via a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism,
  TRAF6 and RIP1 both activate TAK1 and its downstream pathways, leading to induction
  of proinflammatory cytokines. TRIF also activates TBK1 (or IKKε) for the induction
  of type I IFNs, via a mechanism thought to involve the adaptor TRAF3. RLRs signal
  via the mitochondrial adaptor MAVS and several TRAF members to activate the TAK1
  proinflammatory pathway and the type I IFN pathway, whereas the NLR member NOD2
  (as well as NOD1) activates the TAK1 proinflammatory pathway via the signaling adaptor
  RIP2. STING is a signaling adaptor of cytoplasmic DNA sensors, such as cGAS, which
  activates STING via synthesizing the second messenger, cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP.
  STING also senses bacteria-derived cyclic di-nucleotides, c-di-AMP and c-di-GMP.
