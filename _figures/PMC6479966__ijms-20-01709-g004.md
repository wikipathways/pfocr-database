caption: 'Multiple levels of MKP regulation in fungi. In response to stress, MKP gene
  expression can be transcriptionally induced by a transcription factor (TF) activated
  by either the MAPK target of the MKP, another related MAPK pathway, or another route.
  The stability of the MKP mRNA can be post-transcriptionally regulated by an RNA-binding
  protein (RBP), which increases the mRNA half-life and thereby the amount of MKP
  protein. The activity of the RBP can be in turn modulated by phosphorylation by
  the target MAPK. After translation, the MKP can be further regulated by different
  post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination. MKP
  phosphorylation is usually exerted by its target MAPK and ubiquitination generally
  leads to MKP degradation by the proteasome. Numbers designate the fungal MKPs known
  to be under the regulatory mechanisms indicated by grey arrows: (1) S. cerevisiae
  Msg5, (2) S. cerevisiae Sdp1, (3) U. maydis Rok1, (4) C. albicans Cpp1, (5) S. pombe
  Pmp1, and (6) P. oryzae Pmp1.'
