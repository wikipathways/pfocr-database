caption: The rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-induced liver injury. Following
  12 h of fasting, fasting blood glucose (FBG) was measured and T2DM was induced by
  nicotinamide (NIC; 110 mg/kg) and streptozotocin (STZ; 55 mg/kg) administration.
  T2DM was confirmed on day 3 after its induction. Diabetic rats received either oral
  administration of alpha-lipoic acid (T2DM + ALA; 60 mg/kg/day) or intraperitoneal
  injection of DL-propargylglycine (T2DM + PPG; 40 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. Untreated
  diabetic and non-diabetic rats received distilled water orally and served as diabetic
  (T2DM) and healthy control (HC) groups respectively. The rats were sacrificed after
  6 weeks and samples were collected for analysis
