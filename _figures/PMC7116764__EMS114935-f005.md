caption: Arrows and reactions are coloured by the change in molecular complexity,
  determined using the SC-Score. Green indicates a negative change in molecule complexity,
  which in most cases corresponds to a synthetically useful transformation. Red indicates
  a positive change in molecular complexity. Colours are determined relative to the
  other transformations leading to a specific molecule. Some reactions have been removed
  for clarity. Pathway published in reference 68.
