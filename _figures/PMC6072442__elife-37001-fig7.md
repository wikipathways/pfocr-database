caption: (A) Zebrafish squamation sequence showing the addition of scales (yellow)
  by addition of rows and column (arrows). (B) Scale morphogenesis is first recognized
  as at the papilla stage when sp7:EGFP+ dSFCs (yellow) differentiate beneath the
  epidermis (green). Following papilla formation polarized growth commences and scale
  forming cells line the posterior margin and deep aspect of the growing calcified
  plate (magenta). At this stage epidermal invagination begins. These processes (polarized
  growth of the calcified matrix and epidermal invagination) continue to generate
  the final morphology of the scale. (C) Schematic representation of molecular interactions
  leading to scale initiation and epidermal morphogenesis. (1) Refinement and reiteration
  of Wnt/β-catenin activity required Eda signaling (). (2) Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  was necessary for edar expression (). (3) Wnt/β-catenin and Eda signaling were necessary
  for patterned expression of Fgf receptors (). (4) Eda signaling was necessary for
  shha expression and HH pathway activity (). (5) HH signaling was necessary for epidermal
  morphogenesis (; ). (6) Edar misexpression caused ectopic differentiation of dSFCs
  (, ). (7) Broadly overexpressed Fgf8a caused broad, disorganized differentiation
  of dSFCs via a Wnt dependent mechanism (). (8) Neither Eda, nor Fgf signaling was
  sufficient to cause differentiation of dSFCs in the absence of Wnt signaling (;
  ). Dashed line denotes activation of Edar by the Eda signaling ligand.
