caption: Schematic representation of Calcific Aortic Valve Disease (CAVD) pathogenesis.
  Collagen is the predominant component of the fibrosa in healthy cardiac valves,
  while the spongiosa and ventricularis are mainly composed of proteoglycans (PGs)
  and a collagen/elastin network, respectively. (A) Initial lesions, such as endothelial
  damage, account for the recruitment of inflammatory elements in the valve, triggering
  initial microcalcification. Resident cells such as VICs and VECs as well as circulating
  macrophages support the calcification process via the release of extracellular vesicles.
  Apoptotic myofibroblasts and immunity cells favor nucleation of calcium and phosphate.
  The resulting inflammatory microenvironment and myofibroblasts differentiation cause
  extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, valve thickening and fibrosis. Further differentiation
  in osteoblasts accounts for calcification, remodeling and biomineralization or ossification.
  Ectopic expression of TNC is also depicted. (B) Hypoxic conditions induce the formation
  of new ectopic vessels which in turn support ECM remodeling via MMP- and cathepsins-dependent
  degradation of collagen and elastic fibers, respectively. (C) The activation of
  the SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway in endothelial cells further stimulates the homing of inflammatory
  elements (C). CXCR4, C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4; EVs, extracellular vesicles;
  GAG, glycosaminoglycans; SDF-1, stromal cell-derived factor 1; TNC, tenascin-C;
  MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; VECs, valve endothelial cells; VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor; VICs, vascular interstitial cells.
