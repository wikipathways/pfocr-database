caption: Schematic representation of the GB biosynthetic pathway in A. fumigatus.
  The first step in the biosynthetic pathway is the conversion of choline to BA catalyzed
  by AfChoAp in the presence of the flavin cofactor. BA is then released from the
  active site of AfChoAp and undergoes a fast hydration reaction in aqueous solution
  that results in the formation of gem-diol-choline (box). The gem-diol-choline is
  further oxidized to GB in a reaction catalyzed by AfChoAp. The aldehyde can also
  be further oxidized to GB by AfBadAp in a reaction that requires NAD+ as the oxidizing
  substrate for the enzyme. Note that the methyl groups have been represented as lines
  in the intermediate steps of the reaction.
