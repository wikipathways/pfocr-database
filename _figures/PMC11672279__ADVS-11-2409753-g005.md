caption: Schematic illustration of the brain‐targeting and therapeutic mechanism of
  T+A@Glu‐NPs against glioma. Glu‐PEG‐PCL, PEG‐SS‐PCL, TMZ, and ARV‐825 were used
  to prepare T+A@Glu‐NPs nanoparticles via a self‐assembly method. Administered intravenously,
  T+A@Glu‐NPs leverage the glucose transporters expressed by the cerebral microvascular
  endothelium to penetrate the blood‐brain barrier and reach the tumor site. They
  then bind to the transporters highly expressed on the surface of glioma and are
  efficiently internalized into the cells. After lysosomal escape and response to
  glutathione (GSH) reduction, T+A@Glu‐NPs disintegrate and rapidly release TMZ and
  ARV‐825. TMZ acts on DNA to exert its cytotoxic effect, while ARV‐825 induces the
  sustained degradation of BRD4 protein through the ubiquitin‐proteasome pathway,
  thereby downregulating Notch1 and its associated signaling pathways. This further
  enhances the apoptotic and cell cycle arrest effects induced by TMZ in glioma cells,
  achieving a more potent glioma‐killing effect
