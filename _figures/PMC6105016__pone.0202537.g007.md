caption: (A) The core pathways promoting cell proliferation and the impairment of
  immune information by the EBNA2-mediated pathway with receptor CD46; (B) the pro-apoptotic
  human pathway blocked by EBV through ubiquitination and acetylation; (C) the autophagy
  mechanism blocked by EBV through the involvement of viral BALF4, BDLF4, EBNA3B,
  miR-BART14, and miR-BART1-3p; (D) the complete progression of lytic production through
  the impairment of pro-apoptosis and the promotion of viral translocation and anti-apoptosis;
  (E) the promotion of the integrated production of infectious virions by silencing
  autophagy and inhibiting the expression of STAT3.
