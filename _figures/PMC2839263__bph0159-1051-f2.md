caption: Emerging models for the role of β-arrestin in wingless (from Drosophila)
  and the oncogene int-1 (WNT) signalling. WNT-induced and Fizzled (FZD)-mediated
  signalling through β-catenin-dependent and -independent pathway requires β-arrestin
  and its interaction with Dishevelled (DVL). (A) In non-canonical WNT/RAC-1 and WNT/RHO
  pathways, recruitment of WNT/FZD/DVL complexes to clathrin-coated pits is mediated
  through β-arrestin interaction with adaptin/clathrin. Receptor tyrosine kinase RYK
  (RYK) is necessary for internalization and translocation of the complex to early
  endosomes. Translocation decreases cell surface numbers of FZDs and could contribute
  to desensitization of WNT/FZD signalling. In addition, signalling endosomes could
  contribute to specificity and compartmentation. (B) In the WNT/β-catenin pathway,
  β-arrestin promotes WNT-induced phosphorylation of DVL and increases binding between
  axin and DVL. This probably happens in the context of the ‘signalosome’ derived
  from lipid rafts. It is not clear whether β-arrestin serves only as a scaffolding
  protein or whether β-arrestin-dependent endocytosis is required. (C) WNT-directed
  signalling through the atypical receptor tyrosine kinases of the ROR family, phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase,
  the small GTPase CDC42, c-JUN N-terminal kinase, paraxial protocadherin (PAPC) and
  subsequent modulation of convergent extension appears to be β-arrestin independent.
  (C′) Indirect experimental evidence suggests that the WNT/RAS-related protein 1,
  RAS proximate (RAP1) pathway involving casein kinase 1ε (CK1ε) could be β-arrestin
  independent. PAR1, partitioning defective mutant in C. elegans; PKC, protein kinase
  C; LRP5/6, lipoprotein-related protein5/6; ROR2, receptor tyrosine kinase ROR2.
