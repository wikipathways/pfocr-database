caption: The FGFR4/RAS/AKT pathway (a), cell cycle, and p53 signalling (b) are frequently
  altered. Genes with genetic alterations are coloured in light orange. The types
  of alterations and their frequency in the population are indicated on the right
  side of each gene. The percentages of cases with alterations including copy-number
  alterations and/or gene mutations detected in embryonal and alveolar subgroups are
  separately indicated on the left side of each gene. PTEN methylation is also indicated
  below the gene name and coloured in orange.
