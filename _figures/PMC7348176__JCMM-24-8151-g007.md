caption: Potential anticancer mechanism of HF for HCC. A, Schematic showing the anticancer
  mechanism for hinokiflavone in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Hinokiflavone
  (HF) suppressed cell proliferation by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest through up‐regulating
  the expression level of p53, p‐p53 ser15 and p21Cip1 proteins and decreasing the
  activation of G0/G1 phase‐related cell cycle regulatory proteins. B, HF triggered
  the increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), which
  activated c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, and subsequently attenuated the
  decrease of ratio of Bcl/Bax protein expression, further contributing to the caspase‐dependent
  mitochondrial apoptosis. C, HF significantly inhibited the activation of nuclear
  factor kappa B (NF‐κB) signalling, which contributed to caspase‐dependent apoptosis
  through suppressing the expression of NF‐κB target anti‐apoptotic genes, including
  cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2), X‐linked inhibitor of apoptosis
  (XIAP) and cellular FLICE‐inhibitory protein (c‐FLIP)
