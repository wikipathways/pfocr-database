caption: Schematic overview of the quantitative shotgun proteomics results. Shown
  is a crude outline of the biochemical pathways and cellular processes in which most
  of the 1116 quantified proteins participate. Boxes next to each pathway or process
  represent the 47 functional bins, bin numbers as listed in  are in gray letters.
  Bins with underlined numbers and names are significantly enriched in proteins changing
  in response to heat stress with respect to the total protein population. White boxes
  are proteins that do not change during heat stress or whose changes are not significant.
  Red boxes represent proteins increasing, blue boxes proteins decreasing during heat
  stress. The color intensity indicates the magnitude of change.
