caption: 'Proposed antiapoptotic pathway of melatonin in the bovine endometrial cell.
  Abrupt environmental change at pregnancy from hypoxic to hyperoxic induces xanthine
  oxidase (XO) expression and activity, thereby generating reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). ROS-induced DNA fragmentation also activates p53. Regulation of the Bax/Bcl-2
  ratio pathway leads to the activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3. Downstream effects
  of caspase 3 include increasing DNA fragmentation. Melatonin, via its receptors,
  indirectly increases expression and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 and
  2 as well as glutathione peroxidase (GPx) antioxidant enzymes. XO expression and
  activity is indirectly reduced by melatonin and its receptors. Moreover, melatonin
  signaling creates a positive feedback loop between MDM2/MTBP that regulates p53
  by two main mechanisms: inducing p53 ubiquitination that suppresses the transactivation
  domain of p53, hence preventing transcription of downstream targets (i.e., increase
  Bcl-2: Bas ratio and BBC3); secondly, melatonin binding to MT1 increases LIF. The
  increase in LIF decreases BBC3 therefore reducing apoptosis. The decrease in BBC3
  expression reduces the positive regulation of MUC1 expression thus allowing cell
  adhesion.'
