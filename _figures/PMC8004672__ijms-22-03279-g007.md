caption: 'Correlation between growth factor signaling, the actin cytoskeleton, and
  CCN2 expression in CHs. The actin cytoskeleton modulates FGF-2 and BMP signaling
  through the Rac1 pathway, affecting the expression of CCN2 that functions as a mechano-sensing
  regulator []. The CH actin cytoskeleton is regulated through the signaling of the
  growth factors FGF-2, IGF-1, TGF-β1, and TGF-α. The latter may induce stress fiber
  formation. Abbreviations: BMP: bone morphogenetic protein, CCN2: connective tissue
  growth factor, FGF-2: fibroblast growth factor 2, IGF-1: insulin growth factor I,
  TGF-α: transforming growth factor α, TGF-β1: transforming growth factor β1. Arrows
  indicate induction.'
