caption: 'Simplified chart of the one-carbon metabolism. In the methionine cycle,
  methionine is converted into SAM via MAT. SAM is a universal methyl donor. SAM is
  converted to SAH in transmethylation reactions by methyltransferases. The resulting
  SAH is converted to homocysteine, which can either pass through the transsulfuration
  pathway, forming cystein in 2 steps catalyzed by CBS and CSE, or remethylated to
  methionine by MS, using the methyl group provided by Met-THF. The remethylation
  regenerates THF, which is then used to produce methylene-THF and Met-THF via SHMT1
  and MTHFR, respectively. Methylene-THF can also be generated in the mitochondria
  by pathways that involve SHMT2 and GLDC. In the methionine salvage pathway, SAM
  decarboxylation produces an aminopropyl group donor for Putr and Spd synthesis.
  The donation of the aminopropyl group is catalyzed by aminopropyl transferases and
  produces MTA. MTA is converted back to SAM via MTAP. Abbreviations: AHCY, adenosylhomocysteinase;
