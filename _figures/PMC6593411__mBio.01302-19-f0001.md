caption: 'NlpE is a multipurpose sensor for lipoprotein biogenesis, disulfide bond
  formation, and surface adhesion. (Left) Biogenesis of the outer membrane (OM) lipoprotein
  NlpE (blue) begins with transport across the inner membrane (IM) by the SecYEG complex.
  The prolipoprotein, pro-NlpE, is then processed in an ordered manner by Lgt, which
  transfers a diacylglycerol to the +1 Cys residue, LspA, which cleaves off the signal
  peptidase, and Lnt, which transfers an acyl-chain to the amino terminus of +1 Cys.
  NlpE is finally transported to the OM by LolABCDE or by a second LolCDE alternative
  pathway. NlpE contains two Cys residues in the N-terminal domain (labeled “NT”;
  Cys not shown) and two Cys residues in the C-terminal domain (labeled “CT”; sulfurs
  of Cys residues shown) that form a disulfide bonded pair within each domain catalyzed
  by DsbA. DsbA-mediated disulfide bond formation is shown at the OM for simplicity
  but can occur at any step of NlpE biogenesis. Compounds that inhibit NlpE biogenesis
  are shown in red: copper (Cu) modifies the thiol of the +1 Cys, preventing Lgt catalysis;
  globomycin (Glb) inhibits signal peptidase LspA; compound 2 (Cpd2) inhibits transport
  to the OM; and reactive oxygen species (ROS) can modify Cys residues, preventing
  disulfide bond formation (ROS-modified Cys residues are shown as bonding to red
  circles). (Right) Trapping of NlpE at the IM, such as when lipoprotein biogenesis
  is inhibited by Cu and Cpd2, leads to activation of the CpxAR two-component system.
  Activation of sensor kinase CpxA leads to phosphorylation of the response regulator,
  CpxR. Phosphorylated CpxR in turn regulates the Cpx regulon. CpxA activation by
  IM-localized NlpE occurs through the NT domain. The CT domain of NlpE can activate
  CpxA either in response to the oxidation state of the CT Cys residues or when adhesion
  of the cell to hydrophobic surfaces causes conformational changes in NlpE.'
