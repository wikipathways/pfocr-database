caption: Short-term ischemia/hypoxia activates MAPK7-CREB1, which facilitates CEBPβ
  expression and its nucleus translocation to act as transcriptional repressor on
  Pri-mir128-1, consequently maintaining IRS1 in the myocardium. However, prolonged
  stress induces MAPK7 loss and defective CEBPβ repression on mir128-3p, which results
  in IRS1 loss and impaired insulin pathway. Targeting this signaling cascade manifests
  the beneficial effects on maintenance of cardiac insulin sensitivity in response
  to ischemic/hypoxic stress, which is evidenced by AAV9-delivered cardiac MAPK7 restoration,
  cardiac-specific Cebpb overexpression, or silencing endogenous mir128-3p. List of
  source data files.
