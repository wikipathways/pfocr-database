caption: Regulation of Tat2 sorting to the vacuole. (Upper left) Following starvation,
  the TOR signaling pathway is inactivated. This leads to ubiquitin-dependent sorting
  of both newly synthesized and plasma membrane-localized Tat2 to the vacuole. (Upper
  right) Exogeneous PHS down-regulates Tat2, possibly by ubiquitination and vacuolar
  sorting. Signals activated by PHS remain to be elucidated. (Lower) In erg mutants,
  Tat2 is inappropriately ubiquitinated and sorted to the vacuole, not the plasma
  membrane. One possible reason is that Tat2 is misfolded by the altered sterol and
  sphingolipid composition. Alternatively, the sterol mutants may be defective in
  nutrient sensing.
