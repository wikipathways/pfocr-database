caption: 'The genes, enzymes, and reactions of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway.
  The seven genes, or genetic segments, seven enzymes, or enzyme domains, and seven
  reactions, involved in tryptophan formation are shown (). Only one of the reactions
  is reversible. The products of four other pathways contribute carbon and/or nitrogen
  during tryptophan formation. Two of the tryptophan pathway enzymes often function
  as polypeptide complexes: anthranilate synthase, consisting of the TrpG and TrpE
  polypeptides, and tryptophan synthase, consisting of the TrpB and TrpA polypeptides.'
