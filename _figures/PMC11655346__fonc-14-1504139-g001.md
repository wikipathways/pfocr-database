caption: The unique role of DLL3 in the notch signaling pathway. The Notch receptor
  undergoes initial cleavage (S1) within the Golgi apparatus and is then transported
  to the cell membrane, where it interacts with DSL ligands on adjacent cells. Ligand
  binding triggers endocytosis and subsequent cleavages (S2 and S3), releasing the
  Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus,
  NICD forms a complex with RBPJ and MAML, regulating downstream target genes. This
  process inhibits ASCL1, which upregulates Notch ligand expression, including DLL3.
  DLL3 is primarily localized intracellularly within the Golgi apparatus. Through
  binding with other DSL ligands, DLL3 might inhibit Notch signaling
