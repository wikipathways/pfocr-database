caption: Significant correlations between HSD17B4, ACAA1, and PXMP4 expressions and
  immunomodulator gene expressions. (A) There were 114 significant positive or negative
  correlations between HSD17B4, ACAA1, and PXMP4 expressions and immunomodulator gene
  expressions in LUSC. (B) There were 145 significant positive or negative correlations
  between HSD17B4, ACAA1, and PXMP4 expressions and immunomodulator gene expressions
  in LUAD. The nodes and the edges represented the genes and the correlations, respectively.
  Purity-corrected Spearman correlation was used and p < 0.01 was considered significant.
