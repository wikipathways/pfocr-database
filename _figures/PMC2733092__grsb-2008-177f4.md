caption: Intersection sets of the differentially expressed miRNAs constitute complex
  interaction networks.A Venn diagram illustrating the production of intersection
  sets from three miRNA target prediction algorithms. Differentially expressed miRNAs
  were selected for miRNA target predictions by PicTar, TargetScan and miRBase. Intersection
  lists containing 8–107 predicted miRNA target genes (mean 63 genes) were then uploaded
  to Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) for further interaction network analysis. The
  miRNA target genes were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from
  information contained in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base (www.ingenuity.com),
  and networks were then algorithmically generated based on their connectivity. Results
  from pathway analysis were combined with promoter analysis data to form a global
  regulatory network, as shown in the Figure. Composite loops (Shangi et al. 2007)
  were observed for three TFs marked with red nodes (PBX1, PPARγ and HIF1α); these
  harboured TFBSs in upstream regions of miRNAs while they were also predicted as
  target genes for the same miRNA. Two miRNA clusters that were found to target significantly
  interacting genes are marked in the Figure with rectangles. Arrows represent miRNAs
  that are predicted to regulate a specific gene. Nodes are displayed using various
  shapes that represent the functional class of the gene product.
