caption: (A) Regulation of the subcellular localization and activity of Mss4 and its
  role in the cell wall integrity pathway. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Mss4 depends
  on Kap123 and Bcp1, whereas its recruitment to the plasma membrane involves phosphorylation
  by the casein kinase I isoforms Yck1 and Yck2. At the plasma membrane Mss4 acts
  downstream of the PtdIns 4-kinase Stt4 and upstream of the Rho GEF Rom2, which directly
  binds to PtdIns[,]P2 generated by Mss4. In concert with one of the cell surface
  sensors that function in cell wall integrity sensing such as Wsc1, Rom2 stimulates
  nucleotide exchange on Rho1, which in turn activates the β-1,3-glucan synthase Fks1.
  Another effector of activated Rho1-GTP is the serine/threonine kinase Pkc1, which
  serves as an upstream activator of the Slt2/Mpk1 MAP kinase cascade. Ultimately
  this signaling cascade leads to changes in the transcriptional output of a number
  of genes including FKS1. (B) Model for the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton
  by Mss4. Slm1 and Slm2 directly bind PtdIns[,]P2 generated by Mss4 at the plasma
  membrane, which is itself stimulated by the input of Cmd1. Furthermore, both proteins
  are subject to phosphorylation by Tor2, a component of the multisubunit TORC2 complex.
  Both inputs, phosphorylation by TORC2 and PtdIns[,]P2 binding are required for proper
  localization of Slm1/2 to the plasma membrane and the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.
  Other downstream effectors of Mss4 that regulate the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton
  include the protein kinase Pkc1 and the formin Bni1.
