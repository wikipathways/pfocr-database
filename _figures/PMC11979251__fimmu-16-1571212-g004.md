caption: The significant impact of an imbalance in calcium ions (Ca2+) on immunogenic
  cell death (ICD). (1) An increase in calcium ion concentration activates cPLA2,
  which in turn leads to cell membrane damage and the activation of related pathways.
  (2) A calcium ion imbalance in cells mainly results from the mitochondrial calcium
  overload pathway. When calcium carbonate nanoparticles were incorporated with the
  Ca2+ enhancer curcumin (PEGCaCUR), they not only regulated mitochondrial calcium
  overload but also induced ICD. Moreover, when PEGCaCUR were combined with ultrasound,
  ICD was further enhanced. (3) Zinc-based complexes Zn1 and Zn2 can activate ICD
  through Ca2+-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
