caption: Glycoprotein D acts as the main signalling molecule on the surface of the
  HSV-1 envelope. gH interacts with αvβ3 integrins to potentially trigger the production
  of IFN-β, which is known to involve IRF-3 and 7 . Binding by gD to HvEM may lead
  to the activation of TRAF molecules, which in turn stimulate the NF-κB signaling
  cascade. This pathway up-regulates a number of cellular genes in addition to augmenting
  early viral gene expression. NF-κB-responsive genes, birc2 and birc3, have an anti-apoptotic
  role, but paradoxically, inflammatory mediators such as ccl2 are also up-regulated.
  gD-induced signalling of the Jak/Stat and Jak/Src pathways also results in the differential
  expression of genes associated with anti-apoptosis and inflammation. The up-regulation
  of c-Myc could lead to a corresponding increase in cdk2, which has a role in promoting
  DNA replication and gene transcription during infection. It should be noted that
  most signalling cascades have been elucidated in non-fibroblast cells lines, so
  the role of specific kinases may vary in HFFs.
