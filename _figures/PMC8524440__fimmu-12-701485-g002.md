caption: Some representative approaches of MNPs to turn a “cold” tumor into “hot”.
  (A) MNP-based magnetic hyperthermia ablation therapy is capable of inducing tumor
  immunogenic cell death to promote the release of antigen for DC maturation, and
  the subsequent CTL activation and infiltration in the tumor. (B, C) MNPs carrying
  immune agents such as agonists can be applied (B) for potentiating DCs or (C) for
  potentiating CTLs. (D) MNPs carrying immune agents such as antibodies can bind CTLs,
  and direct them to the tumor with an improved accumulation and infiltration by the
  magnetic guidance. (E) The tumor accumulation of the immune checkpoint antibody
  can be enhanced by the conjugation on MNPs for an improved immunosuppressive pathway
  modulation with fewer adverse effects. DCs, dendritic cells; MDSCs, myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells; CTLs, cytotoxic T lymphocytes; Tregs, regulatory T cells; TAM,
  tumor-associated macrophages; NKs, natural killer cells; PD-1, programmed cell death
  protein 1; PD-L1, programmed cell death ligand 1; CTLA-4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated
  protein 4.
