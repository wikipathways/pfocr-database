caption: Gene expression regulation in the methionine salvage and phytosiderophore
  (PS) synthesis pathway in roots and flag leaves. Red and pink arrows represent up-regulated
  gene expression in roots and flag leaves, respectively. Green and light blue arrows
  represent down-regulated gene expression in roots and flag leaves, respectively.
  Smaller size of blue and light blue arrows stands for less number of down-regulated
  genes than up-regulated genes. SAMS, S-ADENOSYL-L-METHIONINE SYNTHETASE; NAS, NICOTIANAMINE
  SYNTHASE; NAAT, NICOTIANAMINE AMINOTRANSFERASE; DMAS, DEOXYMUGINEIC ACID SYNTHASE.
