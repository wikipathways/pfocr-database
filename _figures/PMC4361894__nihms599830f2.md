caption: A Model of the pro- and anti-inflammatory functions of pulmonary collectins
  in macrophages. Under non-inflammatory conditions, binding of the head domains of
  SP-A or of SP-D (remains in multimeric form in which the tail domains remain buried)
  to SIRP-1α induces the activation of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, resulting in blockage
  of the downstream signaling through p38 MAP kinase, potentially resulting in the
  blockages of NF-κB action and the inhibition of inflammatory function. Under inflammatory
  conditions, the production of NO leads to the formation of SNO–SP-D and the disruption
  of the multimeric structure. The tail domains now become exposed and bind to calreticulin/CD91.
  This results in p38 phosphorylation via calreticulin/CD91, potentially leading to
  NF-κB activation and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Binding of the
  collagenous tail of SP-A (globular head interacts with pathogens) to calreticulin/CD91
  receptor complex stimulates cytokine production. Multimeric forms of SP-D, but not
  its trimers, bind a complex of TLR4/MD-2 and inhibit TLR4-mediated inflammatory
  responses caused by both smooth and rough serotypes of LPS, indicating that the
  inhibitory effect of SP-D is dependent upon the formation of its cruciform structure.
  SP-A inhibits inflammatory responses stimulated with smooth LPS by direct interactions
  with TLR2 and TLR4. SP-A binds to rough LPS and enhances TLR2/TLR4 inflammatory
  response through interaction with the adaptor molecule MyD88 (myeloid differentiation
  primary-response protein 88). The MyD88-dependent signaling pathway leads to the
  activation of NF-κB.
