caption: 'Mechanisms of ROS-induced ASK1 activation. Thioredoxin (Trx), a negative
  regulator of ASK1, is dissociated from the N-terminal region of ASK1 in response
  to ROS. Subsequently, TRAF2 and TRAF6 are recruited, thereby fully activating ASK1.
  The ROS-induced activation of ASK1 results in its ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent
  degradation. USP9X negatively regulates ASK1 degradation by deubiquitination, leading
  to the sustained activation of ASK1. CCC: C-terminal coiled-coil domain; NCC: N-terminal
  coiled-coil domain.'
