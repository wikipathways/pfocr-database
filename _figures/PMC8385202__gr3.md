caption: Negative roles of FoxO1 in wound healing. (a) When normal skin is injured,
  increased expression of FGF2, ADIPOQ, and notch1 induces inactivation of FoxO1 by
  phosphorylation of ERK/AKT signaling pathway, leading to the epithelialization and
  migration of keratinocyte at wound healing. (b) In the case of keloid skin, reduced
  expression of FGF2, ADIPOQ, and notch1 decreased phosphorylation of AKT and ERK
  followed by increase activation of FoxO1. An increase of FoxO1 produces hyperplasia
  of abnormal keratinocyte proliferation and abnormal collagen. therefore, FoxO1 induces
  an extreme scar formation. (c) In diabetic wound healing, FoxO1 nuclear localization
  inhibits keratinocyte migration by upregulating SERPINB2 and CCL20 transcription.
