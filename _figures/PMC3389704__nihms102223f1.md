caption: The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.Binding of growth factors (GF) to receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTK) leads to recruitment of adaptor proteins and guanine exchange factors
  (GEF). GEFs promote the active form of Ras (RasGTP). Ras signals to different pathways,
  one being the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Ras activates Raf, which may have several downstream
  effectors. Raf phosphorylates MEK followed by ERK phosphorylated by MEK. ERK has
  cytoplasmic substrates and also translocates to the nucleus to activate a variety
  of transcriptional programmes through several transcription factors (TFs). The signalling
  cascade is negatively regulated by Sprouty proteins (SPRY) and dual-specificity
  phosphatases (DUSP). Proteins in red have been found genetically altered in human
  cancers resulting in hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway.
