caption: 'Among mechanisms involved in bone loss, proinflammatory cytokines play a
  major role in explaining hyper-osteoclastosis []. The nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkappaB)
  signaling pathway regulates the expression of hundreds of genes which are involved
  in diverse processes like inflammation. Receptor activator of NFkappaB Ligand (RANKL)
  is a membrane protein secreted by osteoblasts that binds to the RANK receptor on
  osteoclast precursors and provokes maturation of osteoclast cells (). Its natural
  decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG) produced by osteoblasts and stromal cells binds
  to and confines RANKL and prevents differentiation of osteoclasts [, ]. Various
  proinflammatory cytokines regulate expression of RANKL including tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) [–]. RANKL values can predict the therapeutic
  response to anti-TNF therapy in RA patients [], which is not the case for OPG [],
  whereas OPG expression is increased in synovium of anti-TNF treated patients: with
  both infliximab and etanercept. In contrast, RANKL is not influenced by the treatment,
  showing that the ratio RANKL/OPG is of major importance in regulating bone resorption
  rather than each of the markers taken alone []. Then, it is not surprising that
  deleterious effects of RANKL on BMD can be prevented by denosumab which is an anti-RANKL
  monoclonal antibody, increasing BMD and reducing bone turnover in RA patients [].
  Bone formation is also decreased during inflammation as shown in mice. When Dkk-1,
  a protein that is a member of the dickkopf family, is increased by TNFalpha, it
  exerts its negative regulation on WNT pathway, blocking osteoblast differentiation
  and inducing expression of sclerostin (SCL), leading to the death of osteocytes
  []. Higher levels of Dkk-1 are associated with an increased risk of articular erosions
  independent of age, baseline radiologic features, C-reactive protein (CRP), or disease
  activity []. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) directly induces the production of RANKL by synoviocytes
  in RA patients through the pathway of janus kinase/STAT, phosphorylation of STAT3
  and ERK1/2 [, ].'
