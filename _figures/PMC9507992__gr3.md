caption: Cellular component pathways enriched in the SomaScan proteins associated
  with DLCO in PiZZ off augmentation therapy and PiM subjects. a. Cellular component
  pathways enriched within the 671 nominally-significant SomaScan proteins associated
  with DLCO in PiZZ subjects off therapy. b. Cellular component pathways enriched
  within the 1305 nominally-significant SomaScan proteins associated with DLCO in
  PiMM subjects. Individual cellular component pathways are color-coded based on the
  significance of enrichment p-values depicted at the bottom, light yellow p<0.00005,
  light orange p<0.000005, dark orange p<0.00000005, red p<0.000000005 (Pathway enrichment
  analysis, GOrilla). The graphical representation of Directed acyclic graph (DAG)
  was created using GOrilla.
