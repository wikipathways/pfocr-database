caption: 'The redundant synthesis networks of immunosuppressive metabolites. Kynurenine
  pathway (left—green). After being imported into a cell by amino acid transporters,
  tryptophan is oxidized by one of three enzymes—IDO1, IDO2, or TDO2—to n-formyl-L-kynurenine,
  which is then converted to kynurenine by formamidases. Kynurenine may exit the cell
  through the LAT1, which simultaneously imports tryptophan, or continue down the
  kynurenine pathway until converted into xanthurenic acid (XANA) (major route) or
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) (minor route). Four different kynurenine
  aminotransferase (KAT) enzymes can transaminate kynurenine into kynurenic acid.
  Alternatively, kynurenine can be converted into 3-hydroxy-kynurenine by kynurenine
  3-hydroxylase (K-3-H), or into anthranilic acid by kynureninase. 3-hydroxy-kynurenine
  may be converted to XANA (by KATs) or 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-OHA) by kynureninase.
  3-OHA may also be produced from anthranilic acid by 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid 3,4-hydroxylase
  (3 H-3,4-H). 3-OHA is converted into quinolinic acid by 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid
  3,4-dioxygenase (3 H-3,4-D), and quinolinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase mediates
  the conversion of quinolinic acid to NAD+. XANA and kynurenic acid can be transported
  out of the cell by the OAT1 and OAT3, while connexin 43 allows NAD+ transport. Adenosine
  synthesis pathways (top center—yellow): adenosine synthesis occurs extracellularly
  in the tumor microenvironment and can use either ATP or NAD+ as a pathway substrate.
  ATP (or ADP to a lesser extent) can be dephosphorylated by CD39 or 6 other NTPDases
  into AMP. NAD+ can be converted to AMP directly by CD203a or through an ADP ribose
  (ADPR) intermediate by CD38 (followed by conversion to AMP by CD203a). AMP can also
  be generated from cAMP. cAMP is synthesized from protein Gs-activated adenylate
  cyclase from ATP. Intracellular cAMP can be excreted through multidrug resistance
  proteins 4, 5, or 8 into the extracellular space where a family of ecto-phosphodiesterases
  convert cAMP into AMP. AMP is finally dephosphorylated to adenosine by six possible
  enzymes, most prominently CD73. Adenosine can be deaminated to produce inosine by
  adenosine deaminase 1 (ADA) (membrane-attached via CD26) or 2. AMP can also be deaminated
  into IMP by AMP deaminase, and IMP can be dephosphorylated by CD73 to generate inosine
  (not shown). (Nor)epinephrine synthesis pathways (bottom center—magenta): schematic
  adapted from Molinoff and Axelrod. Epinephrine synthesis begins with tyrosine (TYR)
  and typically proceeds through L-dopa, dopamine (DOP), and norepinephrine (NOR)
  intermediates, though a parallel biosynthetic pathway exits. (Nor)epinephrine are
  exported through an undetermined mechanism. Prostaglandin E2 synthesis pathways
  (right—Blue): phospholipase A2s cleave AA from the inner leaflet of the cell membrane.
  Free AA is converted to PGH2 by the cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1, COX-2, and in
  the brain, COX-3). PGH2 is then converted to PGE2 by mPGES-1, mPGES-2, or cPGES
  (or p23), though PGH2 is also a precursor for several other prostaglandin derivatives
  (indicated by multiple reaction arrows stemming from PGH2 into the cytosol). PGE2
  can also be generated when 8-iso-PGE2 undergoes epimerization. PGE2 is exported
  by MRP 1, MRP 2, or MRP 4. All proteins are denoted by text within shapes while
  metabolites are free-floating text. Straight lines indicate an enzyme catalyzed
  reaction, curved lines indicate transport or are drawn for clarity, and curved dotted
