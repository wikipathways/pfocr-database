caption: 'A model of MyD88-dependent TLR signaling events in the presence and absence
  of IRAK4 kinase activity. A, activation of TLR dimers at membranes leads to rapid
  recruitment of the TIR adaptor MyD88 and the ordered assembly of an oligomeric signaling
  platform termed the myddosome, which comprises four layers: 2× molecules of MyD88,
  4× molecules of MyD88, 4× molecules of IRAK4, and 4× molecules of IRAK1/2. Myddosome
  formation facilitates IRAK4 autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation of
  IRAK1. The E3 Ub ligase, TRAF6, is then thought to simultaneously activate signaling
  pathways leading to the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, AP-1 and cAMP-response
  element–binding protein (via the MAPK pathway), and IRF5, which act in concert for
  the production of inflammatory cytokines. B, in the absence of IRAK4 kinase activity,
  the myddosome assembles into a more stable complex following TLR activation. The
  activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling is only moderately affected by IRAK4 inhibition.'
papertitle: Interleukin-1 receptor–associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) plays a dual role in
  myddosome formation and Toll-like receptor signaling.
