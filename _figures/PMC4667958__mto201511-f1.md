caption: Three levels of cancer-specific infection spread for paramyxoviruses. (1)
  First level of virus specificity for cancer cells is related to overexpression of
  specific receptors for paramyxoviruses. Sialic acids residues in a form of sialoglycoproteins
  serve as receptors for NDV, mumps, and SeV. These sialoglycoproteins are frequently
  overexpressed in malignant cells. CD46 and nectin 4 serve as natural receptors for
  attenuated strain of MV, and they are also frequently overexpressed in malignant
  cells. (2) Second level of virus specificity is related to cancer cells’ specific
  proteases. The replication cycles of paramyxoviruses require protease cleavage of
  viral glycoproteins for productive cell enter. Desirable proteases for oncolytic
  viruses that can activate them are expressed preferentially by cancer cells. For
  example, matrix metalloproteinases are overexpressed in almost all human cancer
  cells. (3) Third level of virus specificity is related to cancer cells’ specific
  genetic defects that allow viral replication. During the process of malignization,
  a cancer cell accumulates many genetic changes. Along with mutations that promote
  accelerated proliferation and invasion, many cancerous cells are losing abilities
  to produce interferon (IFN) and to respond to IFN by apoptotic pathway induction.
  Such abnormalities make these cells highly susceptible to viral infection. So, oncolytic
  paramyxoviruses due to abundance of cancer-specific receptors and due to cancer-specific
  genetic defects are more likely spreading among malignant cells rather than among
  normal cells.
