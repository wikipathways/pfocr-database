caption: 'A comparison of the major metabolic pathways in (A) normal and (B) cancer
  cells. In normal cells (A), glucose enters via GLUT transporters, fueling glycolysis
  and predominantly generating ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the
  mitochondria. Fatty acid oxidation and glutaminolysis also contribute to ATP production
  and lipid synthesis. Pathways with relatively low activity, such as lactate production,
  are indicated by dashed lines. In contrast, cancer cells (B) demonstrate increased
  glucose uptake via upregulated GLUT transporters, resulting in enhanced glycolysis
  and the Warburg effect, where pyruvate is converted to lactate even in the presence
  of oxygen. This metabolic reprogramming supports rapid ATP production and proliferation.
  Despite the dominance of the Warburg effect, minimal TCA cycle activity and OXPHOS
  are retained, as indicated by the dashed lines. Abbreviations: glucose transporter
  type 1 (GLUT1); Monocarboxylate Transporter (MCT); adenosine triphosphate (ATP);
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR); α-Ketoglutarate (α-KG); branched-chain amino
  acids (BCAAs); Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 5 (SLC7A5); Solute Carrier Family
  1 Member 5 (SLC1A5); Fatty Acid Transport Protein (FATP); Plasma Membrane Fatty
  Acid-Binding Protein (FABPpm)'
