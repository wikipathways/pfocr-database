caption: Ion channel hypothesis for AD pathology. A. Aβ, a 39–43 AA long peptide is
  cleaved from the single transmembrane spanning precursor, called amyloid precursor
  protein (APP). B. Aβ undergoes multi-step oligomerization, ranging from the formation
  of small oligomers to large oligomers (commonly referred to as the ADDLs) to protofibrils
  to fibrils and plaques. In normal physiological conditions, most of the secreted
  amyloids remain monomers or small oligomers. C. Several mechanisms for neurotoxic
  activity of Aβ have been proposed, such as activation of a signaling pathway by
  extracellular aggregates (fibrils, plagues), induction of oxidative stress due to
  protein aggregates, or recruitment of factors by intracellular aggregates. Large
  oligomers (or the ADDLs) may be toxic by non-selectively disrupting cell membrane
  viability, like a hammer hitting a leaf). Small oligomers (mono- and dimers) fold
  into the membrane forming ion channels. D. A common denominator for AD toxicity
  is mainly the gain of intracellular calcium, the severity of toxicity depends upon
  the level of calcium loading as well as the cell’s defense capability. See [, ,
