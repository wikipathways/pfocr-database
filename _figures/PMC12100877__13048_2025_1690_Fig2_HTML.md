caption: 'The emerging roles of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) deregulation in polycystic
  ovary syndrome. A WTAP exacerbates GC pyroptosis through hyperactivation of inflammatory
  vesicles: WTAP acts as a mediator for N6-methylating the NLRP3 inflammasome component
  ASC, thus increasing the ASC RNA stability, leading to PCOS over-activation in GC;
  Plumbagin rescues by inhibiting WTAP. Glycodeoxycholic acid induced intestinal group
  3 innate lymphoid cell IL-22 secretion through GATA binding protein 3, and IL-22
  in turn improved the PCOS phenotype. B FTO promotes GC hyperproliferation and leads
  to insulin resistance and thus obesity by inhibiting GLUT4 transport: FTO overexpression
  can promote cell proliferation, inhibit cell apoptosis, and induce insulin resistance
  in GC. FTO reduced the m6A level of FLOT2 mRNA and increased its mRNA stability
  of FLOT2. In contrast, FLOT2 loss reduced the effect of FTO overexpression on the
  proliferation, apoptosis, and insulin resistance of GC. Insulin can induce GLUT4
  transfer to the plasma membrane, and FTO over-expression inhibits GLUT4 transport
  induced by insulin in KGN cells, resulting in insulin resistance. C METTL3 mediates
  KGN cells inflammation leading to ovulation disorders: METTL3 overexpression promotes
  methylation of FOSL2, which causes an increase in NLRP3, IL-6, and TNF-α, ultimately
  leading to a chronic inflammatory state in the ovary; Butyrate modulates METTL3
  to ameliorate. D FTO causes hyperandrogenemia through the AKT pathway and exacerbates
  it via positive feedback: AR activation induces FTO upregulation, and the interaction
  of upregulated FTO, in turn, with AR, promotes the expression of the AR signaling
  pathway and steroid synthase, creating a positive feedback mechanism that promotes
  hyperandrogenemia in PCOS. FTO inhibitors were also found to prevent androgen excess
  and cell hyperproliferation by blocking the AR-AKT signaling axis in GC; Combination
  of MA with AKT inhibitor LY294002 synergistically inhibited GCs cell survival through
  the induce of cell cycle arrest. Abbr: WTAP, Wilms-tumor associating protein; FLOT2,
  flotillin-2; ASC, caspase-recruitment domain; NLRP3: NOD-like receptors containing
  pyrin domains; FTO, obesity-associated protein; GLUT4, glucose transporter type
  4; METTL3, methyltransferase-like 3; FOSL2, a member of the AP1 family; AR, androgen
  receptor; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; SHS, steroid hormone synthetase; MA, FTO-specific
