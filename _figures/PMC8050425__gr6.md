caption: Schematic representation of Fur4 regulated endocytosis. Under uracil starvation
  conditions, Fur4 is localized at the PM, preferentially inside the MCCs  and the
  LID sequence is in close contact with the intracellular loops of Fur4. Addition
  of uracil elicits conformational changes sensed by the LID, triggering Fur4 exit
  from MCCs and exposing the degron sequence to Art-Rsp5 complexes. This ultimately
  leads to Fur4 ubiquitylation, internalization and degradation via the MVB pathway
