caption: Fig. 8. Schematic overview of the signal transduction pathway leading to
  gelsolin-induced invasion. Arrows and arcs point to activation and inactivation/blocking,
  respectively. Open and closed circles indicate pharmacological inhibitors (shaded)
  and transfection with dominant-negative constructs (dotted lines). Asterisks indicate
  Ras effector mutants. The crossed arrow means that this pathway is not implicated.
  The dotted arrow indicates direct binding. The thick arrow points to parallel or
  branching pathways. For details, see Discussion.
