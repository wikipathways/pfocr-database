caption: Physiological roles of S-bacillithiolations for OhrR and MetE in B. subtilis
  and for Gap of S. aureus. NaOCl leads to S-bacillithiolation of OhrR and MetE as
  main targets in B. subtilis that have regulatory roles under NaOCl stress. S-bacillithiolation
  inactivates the OhrR repressor, leading to induction of the OhrA peroxiredoxin that
  confers resistance to NaOCl and OHP. S-bacillithiolation of the methionine synthase
  MetE at its active site Cys730 and of other enzymes of the Cys and Met biosynthesis
  pathway (YxjG, PpaC, SerA, MetI) leads to methionine auxotrophy. In S. aureus, the
  glycolytic Gap is the main target for S-bacillithiolation under NaOCl stress. S-bacillithiolation
  of the Gap active site Cys151 leads to reversible Gap inactivation and prevents
  its overoxidation to Cys sulfonic acid. Gap inactivation under oxidative stress
  might redirect the glycolytic flux into the PPP for NADPH regeneration, as shown
  in yeast cells. Gap, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; OHP, organic hydroperoxide;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
