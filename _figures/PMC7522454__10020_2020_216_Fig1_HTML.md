caption: 'Canonical and alternative transsulfuration pathways. The canonical pathway,
  i.e. transulfuration of homocysteine to cysteine and then GSH synthesis, are shown
  by black lines; alternative pathways, leading to H2S release, are shown by red lines.
  The products of H2S releasing reactions, functioning as surrogate markers of H2S
  release are shown in green colour: Lanthionine reports on H2S from CBS reactions;
  Homolanthionine reports on H2S from CSE reactions; Pyruvate reports on intramitochondrial
  release by 3MST; Sulphates (SO42-) reports on H2S oxidation on the respiratory chain'
