caption: The mechanisms of natural products against cardiovascular diseases. Natural
  products could stimulate the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
  and promote the release of nitric oxide (NO) to lower blood pressure; they can also
  inhibit the activity of angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) and decrease angiotensin-1
  and renin to lower blood pressure. Natural products could promote the activities
  of antioxidant enzymes, like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione
  reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and decrease the concentration
  of peroxidative products, like malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls (PC),
  to ameliorate oxidative stress. Through the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κβ) signaling
  pathway, natural products could decrease levels of inflammatory markers, like tumor
  necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and vascular
  cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), to mitigate inflammation. Natural products could
  decrease the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density
  lipid protein cholesterol (LDL-C) and increase the level of high-density lipid protein
  cholesterol (HDL-C) to improve lipid profile. Natural products could increase the
  abundance of beneficial bacteria, like Bacteroides, and decrease the abundance of
  harmful bacteria, like Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, to regulate gut microbiota.
