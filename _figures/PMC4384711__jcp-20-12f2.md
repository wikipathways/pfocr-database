caption: Common molecular mechanisms of endocrine disruptors. (A) Endocrine disruptors
  act as receptors (especially endocrine receptor) binding inhibitors. Most harmful
  effects are initiated by this inhibition and is shown by most endocrine disruptors
  mechanism. (B) When the targets of endocrine disruptors were adipocyte, endocrine
  disruptors can be obesogens. In this case, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor
  (PPAR) on mesenchymal cells or progenitor cells are the targets. (C) In the case
  of cancer, endocrine disruptors act on the cell cycle. Cyclin protein and p21 protein
  were known to regulate cancer cells when exposed to endocrine disruptors. ER, estrogen
  receptor; MSC, mesenchymal stem cell. Cited from the article of Celik et al. (Chem
  Res Toxicol 2008;21:2195–206), Masuno et al. (Toxicol Sci 2005;84:319–27), and Ohtsubo
