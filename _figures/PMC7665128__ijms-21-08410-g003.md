caption: Schematic action of ketamine on mTOR pathway. Ketamine blockade of NMDARs
  on tonic firing GABA interneurons results in disinhibition of glutamate transmission
  causing a subsequent glutamate burst. This rapid glutamate burst activates AMPARs
  and leads to subsequent Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels
  (VDCCs). Ca2+ promotes BDNF release, which acts via Tropomyosin receptor kinase
  B/Protein kinase B (TrkB-Akt) to stimulate mTOR signalling. The different effects
  are linked with mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity. mTORC1, by phosphorylation, activates
  the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), as well as represses the inhibitory 4E binding
  proteins (4E-PB). This concert of events increases the translation of synaptic proteins
  (PSD95, synapsin-1, GluA1, GluA2) promoting synaptogenesis and intensifying translation
  of BDNF. Akt/PKB and PKC isoforms are the main substrates regulated by mTORC2. PKC-dependent
  phosphorylation of the growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) and MARKS plays an important
  role in rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton and synaptic transmission. Close relation
  between GAP43 and calcium-binding protein - calmodulin (CaM) also affects several
  Ca2+/CaM-regulated neuronal processes. Additionally, AKT/PKB can phosphorylate the
  mTORC1 augmenting it activation.
