caption: Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulation of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism
  in liver, adipocytes, and intestine. Glucose and insulin stimulate glycolysis to
  form acetyl-CoA, which is a precursor of cholesterol and fatty acids. The FXR/small
  heterodimer partner (SHP) pathway may inhibit steroid response element binding protein
  1c (SREBP-1c), which induces all genes involved in lipogenesis, acetyl CoA carboxylase
  (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD). The FXR/SHP
  pathway also inhibits SREBP-2, which induces all genes in de novo cholesterol synthesis.
  FXR activates mitochondria fatty acid β-oxidation by inducing peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor α (PPARα). FXR inhibits PCSK9, which is an inhibitor of LDL receptor. Thus
  FXR induces LDL-R and also syndecan-1 involved in cholesterol uptake. FXR inhibits
  mitochondria triglyceride transport protein (MTP), which is required for assembly
  of VLDL particles with ApoB100. FXR also induces ApoE, which is a high affinity
  ligand of LDL receptor and scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1), and a component of VLDL
  and chylomicron remnants, which are taken up by ApoE receptors. FXR also induces
  phospholipid transport protein (PLTP) involved in reverse cholesterol transport
  of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to liver by HDL/SR-B1 receptor-mediated mechanisms.
  On the other hand, FXR inhibits ApoA1, a component of HDL, and ANGPTL3, which is
  involved in hydrolysis of triglycerides in liver and adipocytes. FXR induces FGF19
  synthesis in the intestine, which activates FGFR4 receptor in hepatocytes to activate
  ERK1/2 signaling to inhibit CYP7A1 and bile acid synthesis. In colon, bile acids
  activate TGR5 signaling to stimulate GLP-1 release. GLP-1 increases insulin sensitivity.
  TGR5 in brown adipocytes stimulates cAMP production, which induce deiodinase 2 (DIO2)
  to convert T4 to T3, which stimulates mitochondrial energy metabolism via activation
  of PGC-1α.
