caption: Mechanism of Akt at the cellular level. In MetS, Akt is the key regulatory
  site in various pathways. The upstream region is regulated mainly by insulin. Insulin
  binds to the InsR, activates IRS, phosphorylates it, and activates the PI3K/Akt
  pathway. This pathway is key to IR (A). Downstream activity mainly mediates RAC1
  and promotes the transfer of GLUT4, promoting the secretion of insulin by pancreatic
  β cells, improving the absorption and synthesis of glycogen by target cells, and
  reducing lipolysis. Akt can mediate the phosphorylation of FoxO1, induce the expression
  of key enzymes (PEPCK and G6Pase), and inhibit glucose production in liver cells
  (B). In terms of lipid production, Akt signaling can enhance lipid synthesis by
  activating the SREBP1c transcription factor, and its downstream activity activates
  PDE3B and inhibits AC, which then inhibits the production of cAMP. This is effective
  in inducing inhibition of lipolysis and reducing the content of FFAs in the blood.
  In adipocytes, the overexpression of human MEDA-7 protein affects the downstream
  activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Excessive FFAs in plasma weakens the PI3K/Akt
  pathway conduction (C). In the state of PI3K/Akt pathway dysfunction and IR, eNOS
  phosphorylation decreases and the production of ROSs and ET-1 increases, which together
  lead to endothelial dysfunction. PI3K/Akt signaling pathway molecules activate RTKs
  and TOR, thereby inhibiting autophagy in response to insulin-like and other growth
  factor signaling pathways. Akt signaling can mediate and promote an increase in
  ROS levels (D).
