caption: Likely pathogenic mutations present in ER-positive/HER2-negative male breast
  cancers but not targeted by likely pathogenic mutations in ER-positive/HER2-negative
  female breast cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study were annotated using
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The ‘DNA replication, recombination and repair’
  network was significantly enriched for the 25 genes affected by likely pathogenic
  mutations present in ER-positive/HER2-negative male breast cancers but not in ER-positive/HER2-negative
  female breast cancers from TCGA (IPA score 17). Two views of the network are shown.
