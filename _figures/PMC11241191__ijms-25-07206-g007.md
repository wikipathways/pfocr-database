caption: 'A schematic illustration of SRI regulating apoptosis in HCC. SRI overexpression
  inhibits the apoptosis of HCC cells by interacting with STAT3 via NF-κB pathway,
  whereas opposing effects were observed for knockdown of SRI. Stattic, an inhibitor
  of STAT3, promotes apoptosis of HCC cells via NF-κB pathway. Avicularin, the inhibitor
  of NF-κB, which promotes apoptosis of HCC cells. ↑: represent upregulation or promotion.
  ↓: represent downregulation or inhibition'
