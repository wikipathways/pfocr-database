caption: Schematic illustration of possible mechanisms of tip cell selection through
  modulation of different components of the VEGF signalling pathway following Notch
  signalling. Two adjacent endothelial cells are depicted, light grey tip cell (activated
  by VEGF-A), dark grey stalk cell (inhibited through Notch signalling). (A) VEGF-A
  (blue dimers) binds and activates VEGFR2 in the tip cell, leading to activation
  of the dll4 promoter and also VEGFR2 promoter reinforcing high levels of VEGFR2
  receptor. Dll4 (green) activates the Notch receptor (brown) in the neighboring cell.
  Gamma secretase (GS) cleavage leads to release and translocation of the Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD) into the nucleus, where it binds to the transcriptional co-repressor
  complex including CBF1/RBPJ/suh. NICD binding leads to transcriptional activation
  of downstream targets of the Hairy enhancer of split (Hes) family. Repression of
  the VEGFR2 promoter may be mediated by Hes members or possible other direct effects
  of NICD. Net reduction in VEGFR2 protein in the stalk cell leads to competitive
  advantage of the tip cell. (B) Additional pathway components are regulated by Notch
  signalling. VEGFR1 (orange) and soluble VEGFR1 lacking the transmembrane domain
  sequester VEGF-A in the extracellular space, thus reducing signalling and activity
  through VEGFR2. NICD through unknown mechanism promotes VEGFR1 promoter activity.
  (C) VEGFR3 (pink) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1, turquoise) expression is induced in tip
  cells, promoting net activity of VEGF signalling. Dll4-Notch signalling leads to
  reduced expression of VEGFR3 and NRP1 in stalk cells. The regulation of VEGFR1 as
  in (b) augments the net difference in VEGF signalling between tip (high) and stalk
  (low).
