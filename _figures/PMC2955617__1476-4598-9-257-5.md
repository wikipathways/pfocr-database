caption: In myxoid liposarcoma, the FUS/DDIT3 protein has been shown to upregulate
  the expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) which leads to the transcription
  of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma and other genes involved in
  adipocytic differentiation. We showed that in myxoid liposarcoma, the atypical NF-kappaB
  pathway is active. Hereby casein kinase 2 phosphorylates the nuclear factor of kappa
  light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor (IkB), which releases from
  the NF-kappaB p50/p65 complex and gets degraded. The NF-kappaB p50/p65 complex then
  shuttles into the nucleus were it promotes the transcription of genes involved in
  cell proliferation. Recent studies showed that the FUS/DDIT3 protein facilitates
  DNA binding of the NF-kappaB p50/p65 complex in a non-direct manner, probably by
  interfering with IkB. Also Src pathway is activated in myxoid liposarcoma, which
  leads through different signaling pathways (AKT, MEK, ERK) to tumor growth and cell
  survival. This pathway can be inhibited in vitro by Src-inhibitor dasatinib.
