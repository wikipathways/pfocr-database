caption: Proposed model for PAR2-induced β-catenin stabilization and targets of RNF43.
  (A) PAR2 is a target of RNF43, independent of Wnts. A scheme showing the proposed
  mechanism whereby PAR2 markedly induces the β-catenin signaling pathway. In the
  presence of RNF43, PAR2 is degraded, such that no β-catenin stabilization occurs.
  When RNF43 is ubiquitinated and degraded, abundant levels of membrane PAR2 are obtained.
  Under such conditions, facilitated β-catenin stabilization takes place, and an increased
  gene signature is observed. (B) Targets of RNF43. The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF43
  acts to degrade FZDs and PAR2. An additional partner affected by RNF43G659fs is
  the PI3K/mTOR pathway
