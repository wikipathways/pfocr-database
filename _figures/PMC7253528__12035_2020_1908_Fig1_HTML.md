caption: Ceramide biosynthesis pathways. Ceramide (Cer) can be produced on each of
  the three marked pathways. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the first
  step in the de novo pathway and controls the rate of ceramide biosynthesis. Ceramide
  synthases (CERS) take part both in the salvage and de novo pathways, using different
  substrates (sphingosine and sphinganine). Metabolic shuttling between ceramide and
  sphingomyelin is done by sphingomyelin synthase—S(G)MS, and sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase
  (SMPD). Sphingosine is produced from ceramide by ceramidases (ASAH, ACER). Sphingosine
  can be phosphorylated by the sphingosine kinases (SPHK1 and SPHK2) to form sphingosine-1-phosphate
  (S1P), while the ceramide kinase CERK phosphorylates ceramide to ceramide-1-phosphate
  (C1P); both phosphates have signaling activities approximately opposite to those
  of sphingosine and ceramide. Dephosphorylation of S1P and C1P is carried out by
  their respective phosphatases, SGPP and C1PP. The highly controlled enzymatic conversion
  that yields compounds of radically different activities in a single reaction is
  reflected in the idea of the sphingolipid rheostat
