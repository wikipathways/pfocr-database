caption: 'The mechanisms and signaling pathways regulate the metabolisms of glutathione/GPX4,
  iron, and lipid in ferroptosis. The hallmarks of ferroptosis include the loss of
  lipid peroxide repair capacity by the phospholipid hydroperoxidase GPX4, the availability
  of redox-active iron, and oxidation of PUFA-containing phospholipids, which are
  regulated by the following signaling pathways. 1. Glutathione/GPX4 signaling pathways.
  The synthesis of tripeptide GSH protects cells from ferroptotic death, in that GSH
  is essential: (i) for the maintenance of the level of GPX4 through the exchange
  of glutamate and cystine via cystine/glutamate antiporter system Xc-, and (ii) for
  the functional activity of GPX4 to reduce lipid hydroperoxides (L-OOH) to lipid
  alcohols (L-OH), resulting in the prevention of the iron (Fe2+)-dependent formation
  of toxic lipid ROS. The inhibition of system Xc- or inhibition of GSH synthesis
  should result in lipid peroxides accumulation and ferroptotic cell death through
  inactivating GPX4. In addition, the mevalonate pathway, sulfur transfer pathway,
  glutamine pathway, and p53 signaling axis are also involved in the regulation of
  GPX4 activity and function. 2. Iron metabolic signaling pathway. Iron metabolism
  includes iron uptake (transferrin receptor), iron export (ferroportin), iron storing
  (ferritin), and ferritinophagy mediated by lysosome and NCOA4. Abnormal iron metabolism
  could induce iron overload resulting in lipid ROS production via the Fenton reaction.
  In addition, ferritin can be regulated by the ATG5-ATG7 and NCOA4 pathways as well
  as and IREB2. Furthermore, iron metabolism can be regulated by p62-Keap1-NRF2 and
  HSPB1 signaling pathways. 3. Lipid metabolic signaling pathway. Ferroptosis can
  be caused by an abnormal accumulation of lipid peroxidation, which is the archetype
  free radical chain reaction formally resulting in the insertion of O2 into a C-H
  bond in the oxidizable free PUFAs. PUFAs can be transformed into PUFA-PEs by two
  enzymes, including ACSL4 for synthesizing PEs and LPCAT3 for lipid remodeling. PUFAs
  can also be oxidized to phospholipid hydroperoxides by LOXs. In addition, recent
  studies show that VDACs and the FSP1-CoQ10-NAD(P)H pathways exist as an independent
  parallel system that works cooperatively with GPX4/glutathione to regulate lipid
  peroxidation and ferroptosis. GSH: glutathione; TFR1: transferrin receptor 1; Fpn:
