caption: Activation of TLR-mediated signaling may induce HMGB1 Cys23–Cys45 disulfide
  bond formation. Activation of TLRs results in the translocation of TRAF6 to mitochondria,
  where it interacts with the protein ECSIT. This is followed by ECSIT ubiquitination
  and enrichment in the mitochondria, culminating in significantly increased mitochondrial
  ROS generation. It is conceivable that this TLR–TRAF6–ECSIT–mitochondrial ROS signal
  pathway promotes HMGB1 oxidation during inflammation. ECSIT, evolutionarily conserved
  signaling intermediate in Toll pathway; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TRAF6, tumor
  necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6. To see this illustration in color,
