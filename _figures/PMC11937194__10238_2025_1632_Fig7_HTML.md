caption: The related mechanisms of TRPC3, TRPV1, L-VGCC, α2δ1 and TTYH3 in regulating
  tumor stemness. TRPC3 expression significantly enhances NF-κB activity, thereby
  inducing the proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities of tumor cells.
  TRPV1 overexpression leads to the activation of AMPK and CaMKKβ phosphorylation,
  and a reduction in the expression of cyclin D1 and MMP2, and lead to the loss of
  cells stemness. L-type VGCCs can initiate the activation of p38-MAPK signaling pathway,
  thereby promoting cancer stemness. The VGCC auxiliary subunit α2δ1, facilitating
  the promotion of cancer stemness through the activation of CaMKIIδ-mediated PKM2
  sequential phosphorylation. TTYH3 leads to the activation of H-Ras/A-Raf/MEK/ERK
  signaling pathway, and significantly promoting cancer stemness
