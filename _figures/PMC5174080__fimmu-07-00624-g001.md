caption: Innate and adaptive immune responses induced by Avian leukosis virus (ALV).
  (A) ALV infection in chickens may be recognized by TLR7 and melanoma differentiation-associated
  gene 5, followed by induction of innate immunity including differential expression
  of cytokine and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). (B) The expression of caspase-1
  combined with adaptor NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 increased in ALV-J-infected chick
  livers. (C) CD4+ T cell numbers decreased and CD8+ T cell numbers increased in the
  ALV-J-infected chicken spleen. (D) Infection with ALV results in three classical
  in vivo infection profiles including (1) V+A− (viremia, no neutralizing antibody);
  (2) V+A+ (viremia, with neutralizing antibody); and (3) V−A+ (no viremia, with neutralizing
  antibody). (E) The specific pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize ALV
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns should be further studied. (F) ALV-A/B/J
  infection can increase chicken interferon regulatory factors 3 (IRF3) promoter activity
  in DF-1 cells. Transcription factor such as IRF3 and NF-κB responses to ALV should
  be further clarified. (G) DF-1 cells pretreated with recombinant chicken IFN-α can
  inhibit the replication of ALV-A/B/J. (H) Immune signaling pathway such as PRRs
  signaling pathway (toll-like receptor, RIG-I-like receptors, interferon-γ-inducible
  protein 16, and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) and JAK-STAT signaling pathway responses
  to ALV should be clarified; the specific mechanism of the inflammatory response,
  particularly the role of inflammasomes in sensing ALV should be further studied.
  What immune evasion strategies were used by ALV? Which antiviral factors inhibit
  the production of ALV? (I) miR-23b promotes ALV-J replication by targeting IRF1.
  (J) What is the role of non-coding RNAs including miRNA, long non-coding RNA, and
  circular RNA in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity induced by ALV? (K)
  ALV-J can infect chicken dendritic cells (DCs) during the early stages of differentiation
  and can trigger apoptosis. ALV-J inhibits the differentiation and maturation of
  DCs and alters cytokine expression that includes IL-1β, IL-8, and IFN-γ. Chicken
  macrophages are susceptible to ALV-J, and IL-1β, IL-6, ISG12-1, and Mx were altered.
  The interaction between ALV and macrophages, DCs, natural killer, B cells, CD4+,
  and CD8+ T cells needs to be further explored. The dotted line represents remaining
  processes not fully understood.
