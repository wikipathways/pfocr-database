caption: Biological functions of Amot family proteins and associated signal transduction
  pathways. (A) The structure of Amot family. (B) Role of the Amot family proteins
  in physiological regulation. (C) Signal transduction pathways involved in Amot family
  proteins. (a) In the Hippo signaling pathway, YAP enters the nucleus and forms a
  transcriptionally active complex with TEAD and other transcription factors to drive
  the expression of pro-proliferative or anti-apoptotic genes. (b) AMPK phosphorylates
  Amotl1, thereby inducing YAP retention in the cytoplasm to suppress tumorigenesis.
  (c) In glioblastoma multiforme, mTOR interacts with Rictor and phosphorylates Amotl2,
  making it unable to bind YAP and increasing YAP nuclear entry and transcriptional
  activity. (d) In liver hepatocellular carcinoma, Amot promotes the nuclear entry
  and transcriptional activity of YAP. Amot, angiomotin; Amotl1, Amot-like protein
