caption: Glycoprotein folding in ER and the calnexin/calreticulin cycle. The folding
  of newly synthesized glycoproteins in the ER is assisted by calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin
  (CRT). Initially, a 14-residue oligosaccharide is transferred from dolichol di-phosphate
  to the nascent chain of glycoprotein by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). The terminal
  two glucoses are removed by glycosidase I and II sequentially. The monoglucosylated
  form of the glycoprotein can then bind to CNX and the CRT N-domain to facilitate
  its folding. Both CNX and CRT are associated with ERp57 on their arm-like P-domains.
  The binding of CNX and CRT with the protein substrate is also stabilized by the
  oxidoreductase ERp57. Removal of the last glucose by glucosidase II causes substrate
  release from CNX/CRT. If the protein reached its native conformation, it will be
  released from the ER through the protein secretory pathway. However, if the protein
  is not correctly folded, the exposed hydrophobic region will be recognized by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein
  glycosyltransferase (UGGT). This enzyme will add the removed glucose back on to
  the glycoprotein from a UDP-glucose donor. This generates a monoglucosylated N-glycan
  on the glycoprotein and promotes binding with CNX/CRT again. A protein may cycle
  through this CNX/CRT cycle numerous times before it reaches its native conformation.
  However, if proper folding of the protein still cannot be achieved, the unfolded
  protein will be targeted to the ER associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. ERAD targeted
  proteins undergo sequential demannosylation assisted by EDEM, an ER-resident mannosidase.
  Demannosylated ERAD substrates are then recognized by and bind to XTP3-B and OS-9
  which prevent aggregation and are then further targeted to Hrd1-SEL1L for ubiquitination.
  This is followed by retro-translocation into the cytoplasm where the misfolded polypeptide
  chain is subjected to proteasome degradation. Additionally, the accumulation of
  unfolded protein will also trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR).
