caption: ADAM-17–induced shedding of ACE-2 together with the anticipated elevated
  levels of TNF-α as a result of SARS-CoV-2–induced activation of ADAM-17 will substantially
  increase the levels of Ang-II. The synergistic increase in the levels of Ang-II
  and TNF-α will induce the expression and activity of MMP-9 in addition to the intrinsic
  ability of Ang-II to induce the activation of ADAM-17. The intricate relationship
  between ADAM-17, MMP-9, and ACE-2 will be detrimental to the magnitude of the cytokine
  storm in COVID-19.
