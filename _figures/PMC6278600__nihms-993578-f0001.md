caption: Postulated cellular mechanisms of 20-HETE bioactions in the blood vessel
  wall. 20-HETE biosynthesis is stimulated by factors such as androgen, high fat,
  hypoxia/ischemia and vasoactive hormones. 20-HETE binds to its receptor GPR75 and
  in endothelial cells (EC), triggering a signaling cascade that is initiated by a
  Gαq/11− and GIT1-mediated c-Src activation and EGFR phosphorylation which is followed
  by activation of MAPK (ERK1/2) and IKKβ-NF-κB leading to ACE induction, eNOS uncoupling
  and production of inflammatory cytokines. In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC),
  the activation of Gαq/11− and GIT1 following 20-HETE binding to GPR75 leads to activation
  of PKC and c-Src, respectively, both kinases phosphorylate the BK channel, inhibiting
  the BK channel which further sensitize the contractile apparatus. It is also postulated
  that the Gαq/11 activation leads to increase intracellular Ca2+ via PLC-IP3 pathway
  which further contribute to 20-HETE vasoconstrictor activity. PKC activation following
  binding of 20-HETE to GPR75 may also be a key to 20-HETE ability to stimulate VSMC
  migration and proliferation ().
