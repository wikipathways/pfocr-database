caption: Model for regulation of metabolism at the pyruvate branch point  Fermentative
  conditions. The low-activity MPCFERM (composed of Mpc1 and Mpc2) is competing for
  cytosolic pyruvate produced through glycolysis with pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC),
  the first enzyme of the alcoholic fermentation pathway. Consequently, the majority
  of pyruvate remains in the cytosol is decarboxylated by PDC and is finally transformed
  into ethanol. Low-level transport of pyruvate into mitochondria is required for
  the biosynthesis of leucine and valine. In addition, mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation
  may be blocked by a hypothetical inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) by
  phosphorylation of the E1 subunit under these conditions.  Respiratory conditions.
  The high-activity MPCOX (composed of Mpc1 and Mpc3) is expressed while PDC is downregulated.
  This allows the efficient uptake of pyruvate into mitochondria. Inside the organelle,
  pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA by PDH, which enters the TCA cycle and thus
  finally fuels ATP production in the respiratory chain. The subunit exchange in the
  MPC thus very likely participates in the Crabtree effect in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
