caption: 'Metabolic pathway alterations in PCT. (A) Description of cysteine and methionine
  metabolism. (B) NAD metabolism and its biological activities. NMN is synthesized
  from nicotinamide through the catalysis of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NAMPT), which is the first step of NAD synthesis by the salvage pathway. NMN is
  converted into NAD by nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNATs) and NAD
  is subsequently used for NADP generation through mitochondrial NAD kinase (NADKs)
  catalysis. NADKs are pivotal to balance the NAD pool and NADP pool, which plays
  a key role in modulating NAD-dependent and NADP-dependent biological reactions.
  (C) The dysregulation of hexosamine biosynthesis and lysine degradation in prostate
  cancer. The red and blue fonts indicate significant increases and decreases, respectively,
  in PCT. ▴: Differential genes or metabolites in discovery and validation phases.'
