caption: Connection network for pathway‐extended TKI SVMs. Schematic relationships
  outlining the pathway connections for the best‐performing PE model for each drug
  in panels (A) sorafenib, (B) lapatinib, (C) gefitinib, (D) sunitinib, (E) imatinib
  and (F) erlotinib. All symbols indicated are gene names. The erlotinib model was
  highly interconnected and is represented as a table. Genes in red are features selected
  for the final PE‐Sor gene signature, whereas genes coloured green were chosen in
  a separate PE gene signature with comparable performance. Genes in black were not
  part of the final signature themselves but correlated with efficacy to the TKI of
  interest by MFA and expanded the gene pool through biochemical connections they
  possessed to one‐node or two‐node distant genes
