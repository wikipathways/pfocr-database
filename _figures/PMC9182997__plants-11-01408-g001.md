caption: 'Summary of the role of the control network and signal transduction-dependent
  pathways in responses to biotic stress and abiotic stress in apple. Under salt stress,
  MdPAT16 participates in the regulation of the MdCIPK13-regulated salt stress response
  and sugar accumulation through the palmitoylation of MdCBL1. Under drought stress,
  the MdHSP90-MdHSFA8a complex dissociates, and the released MdHSFA8a interacts with
  the AP2/ERF family transcription factor MdRAP2.12, thereby activating the activities
  of the related structural genes in the downstream flavonoid pathway. MdWRKY31 participates
  in the ABA signaling pathway by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of MdRAV1
  to enhance the transcriptional activity of MdABI3 and MdABI4. The MdMEK2-MdMPK6-MdWRKY17-MdSUFB
  signaling pathway stabilizes the chlorophyll content in the leaves of apple plants
  under moderate drought stress. Cold stress mediated by ICE-CBF-COR is induced by
  transcription factors such as BBX, MYB, and bHLH. PAT16: protein palmitoyl transferase
