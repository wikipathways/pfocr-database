  cultured SSB01. b The purine-degradation pathway in which the metabolites' background
  colors indicate their fold-changes in hospite relative to cultured SSB01. Metabolites
  with no background color were not detected. The heat-map in the lower-right corner
  shows the log2 fold-changes (Log2FC) of metabolite abundances. c Transcript levels
  for guanine deaminase (s6_17309) in hospite and in cultured SSB01 indicated by transcripts

  the p-values (two-sided t-test) for the probabilities that the differences observed
  were significant (***p-value < 0.001; **p-value < 0.01). Source data are provided
