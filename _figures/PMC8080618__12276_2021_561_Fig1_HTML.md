caption: Under conditions that increase lipid peroxidation, polyol pathway, and Maillard
  reaction, such as exposure to alcohol and/or high n-6 fat diets or high fructose
  drinks, different AGEs are produced. Ethanol and its reactive metabolites generated
  by CYP2E1 are also likely involved in the AGE synthesis pathways to produce the
  final acetaldehyde and AGE (AA-AGE) adducts. The formation of AA-AGE adducts can
  be observed after chronic alcohol exposure. These AA-AGE adducts exhibit similar
  properties (e.g., brown color and polymerization) as the AGE adducts cross-link
  with sugar molecules, and they are different from MAA adducts formed by AA and MDA
  interactions. However, treatment with an antioxidant can halt AA-AGE adduct formation,
  supporting the idea that AA-AGE adducts can be generated from a Schiff base product
  similar to AA adducts and AGEs.
