caption: Expression of genes in the canonical complement system pathway. (A) Interaction
  and expression of canonical complement system pathway genes in the wild type H99-infected
  animals. (B) Interaction and expression of canonical complement system pathway genes
  in the mutant-infected animals. Shapes in red are up-regulated and the intensity
  of shape colors is relative to the level of gene expression (dark color denotes
  stronger expression).
