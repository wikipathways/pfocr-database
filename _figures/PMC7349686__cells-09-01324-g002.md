caption: Possible signaling mechanisms of ectopic osteogenesis in skeletal muscles.
  BMPs bind to homomeric type II receptors which phosphorylate homomeric type I receptor
  and induce SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent signaling. In the SMAD-dependent
  signaling SMADs 1, 5 or 8 complex with SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus where
  recruit RUNX2 and other co-factors to regulate osteogenic gene expression. TGFβ
  binds to complex of two TGFβ types I receptors (TβRI) and two type II receptors
  (TβRII), which phosphorylate each other and induce SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent
  signaling. In the SMAD-dependent signaling activated SMAD2/3 form complex with SMAD4.
  Complex translocates to the nucleus where recruits co-factors and regulates target
  gene expression. Activated SMAD3 recruits HDACs which inhbit RUN2 activity. In the
  SMAD-independent pathway, regardless of the ligand bind to the receptors, TAK1 recruits
  TAB1 to initiate p38 MAPK or ERK1/2 MAPK signaling cascade. MAPK phosphorylates
  and activates RUNX2, DLX5, and OSX transcription factors. Activation of TLR singaling
  pathways by PAMPs and DAMPs lead to activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB),
  which controls the expression of an array of inflammatory cytokine genes and BMPs.
  WNTs bind to Frizzled (Fzd) receptors and activate the canonical WNT pathway which
  leads to accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. β-catenin is translocated to
  the nucleus where forms complex with TCF1 which acts as transcriptional activator
  of Runx2. Low level of oxygen (hypoxia) induces the mTOR pathway. HIF1α, a downstream
  intermediate in mTOR signaling, is a key transcriptional regulator of the cellular
  response to hypoxia. It forms complex with HIF1β and as HIF1 enters to the nuclei
  where regulates target gene expression.
