caption: Cohesin regulates expression of genes that control differentiation, morphogenesis,
  proliferation, and pluripotency. The cohesin complex consists of the Smc1, Smc3,
  Rad21 and Stromalin (SA)/Stag2 subunits []. Cohesin is thought to bind by encircling
  DNA, and binding requires the Nipped-B/NIPBL – Mau-2 complex, and ATPase activity
  in the Smc1 and Smc3 head domains that interact with Rad21. Both the genes that
  increase or decrease in expression with reduced Nipped-B/NIPBL or cohesin activity
  are enriched for cohesin-binding genes, indicating that cohesin both represses and
  facilitates transcription. Developmental processes are the top gene ontology categories
  for genes that increase in expression when cohesin or Nipped-B/NIPBL activity is
  reduced in Drosophila cells derived from central nervous system [], and mouse embryonic
  stem cells []. The majority of the genes that show the largest increases in expression
  are bivalent, with both histone H3 lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation, indicating
  that they are also partially repressed by Polycomb group silencing proteins. Cohesin
  directly promotes expression of genes in the ecdysone steroid hormone signaling
  pathway in salivary glands and the mushroom body γ neuron [,,] and the estrogen
  pathway in human breast cancer cells []. Nipped-B/NIPBL and cohesin also directly
  facilitate expression of myc genes, which promote protein synthesis and cell proliferation
  in all species examined [,,,,,,], and pluripotency genes in mouse embryonic stem
  cells [].
