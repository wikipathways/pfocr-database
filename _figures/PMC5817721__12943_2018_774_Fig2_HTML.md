caption: Targeting RAF–MEK–ERK signaling pathway. GTP-bounding RAS recruits and activates
  RAF, which in turn initiates a cascade of protein phosphorylation starting with
  MEK. Activated MEK phosphorylates ERK that moves from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
  where it phosphorylates several transcription factors. Mutational activation of
  RAF–MEK–ERK cascade contributes to progression of the disease. Selective inhibitors
  of MEK, e.g. trametinib, cause potent and durable suppression of ERK signaling
