caption: PD-1 and its downstream effect. Upon binding to ligands, PD-1’s ITIMs and
  ITSMs are phosphorylated by Src-family tyrosine kinases. The phosphorylated tyrosine
  residue subsequently recruits SHP-2 and SHP-1/SHP-2 in ITIM and ITSM, respectively.
  Activated PD-1 eventually hinders PI3K/Akt and RAS/MEK/ERK pathways, thwarts the
  function of PKC-θ and ZAP70 phosphorylation and inhibits glycolysis. The net effect
  is decreased cell cycle progression, IL-2 production, T-cell activation and effector
  T-cell development and increased apoptosis.Src, Src-family tyrosine kinases; ITIM,
  immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif; ITSM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
