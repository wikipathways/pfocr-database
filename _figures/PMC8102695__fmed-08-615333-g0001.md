caption: 'Therapeutic Effects of Heparin in COVID-19. Lung infection by SARS-CoV-2
  can trigger a systemic inflammatory process, which is also associated with an increased
  occurrence of procoagulant factors found in severe cases of COVID-19. Low molecular
  weight Heparin (LMWH) shows effects in 3 main ways: 1. Antiviral effect: the entrance
  of SARS-CoV-2 in the endothelial and epithelial cells depends on its interaction
  with the cell surface heparan sulfate; thus, the binding of heparin to the viral
  spike protein can inhibit this interaction, decreasing viral cell invasion. Heparin
  has shown its antiviral effect on other viruses such as HIV (competing for the receptor)
  and ZIKV (indirect action, abrogating the viral-induced cytotoxic effect). 2. Anticoagulant
  effect: the uncontrolled blood clot formation can be controlled by the anticoagulant
  function inherent to heparin, mediated by the interaction of heparin and anti-thrombin-3
  glycoprotein (AT3), potentiating the AT3 inactivation of thrombin, an essential
  factor for the formation of thrombi. 3. Anti-inflammatory effect: heparin has widely
  known anti-inflammatory effects, mainly canceling pro-inflammatory mediators, such
  as TNF-α, IL-6, and LTB4, which leads to decreased migration and activation of immune
  cells, preventing against the systemic inflammatory response. ACE2, Angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2; APC, activated protein C; AT3, Antithrombin-III; CK, creatine kinase;
  CRP, C-reactive protein; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; HS, heparan sulfate;
