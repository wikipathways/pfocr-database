caption: Model of drug tolerance and adaptive resistance in response to targeted kinase
  inhibition. Inhibition of a specific kinase (e.g., trametinib inhibits MEK) drives
  remodeling of the epigenetic landscape through different transcription factors and
  epigenetic readers and writers depending on the inhibitor used and cellular context.
  Changes in the enhancer and promoter landscape drive transcriptional reprogramming
  of the kinome leading to upregulation of receptor tyrosine and other kinases. Kinome
  remodeling results in cell survival and proliferation by activating parallel proliferative
  pathways including the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway or through reactivation of the
  inhibited pathway (e.g., MEK-ERK). Pathway reactivation occurs when activity of
  upstream kinases is increased such that targeted inhibition is overcome in a mechanism
  known as adaptive bypass. Activation of parallel and/or vertical pathways compensates
  for the inhibited target to allow for cell survival and proliferation in a mechanism
  termed adaptive resistance. The rational design of combination therapies targeting
  each step of the adaptive resistance pathway has shown promise in clinic trials
  and in preclinical models including combination of MEK or KRAS(G12C) inhibitors
  with an allosteric inhibitor (SHP099) of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2. Blocking
  adaptive resistance pathways with such combinations will be critical to making targeted
  kinase inhibitors have more durable responses in patients.
