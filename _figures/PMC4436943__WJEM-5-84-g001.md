caption: 'Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. A: In the absence of Wnt ligands, cytoplasmic
  β-catenin binds to the ‘‘destruction’’ complex composed by Axin, adenomatous polyposis
  coli (APC), the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and casein kinase 1α (CK1α).
  β-catenin is phosphorylated by the kinases of the complex on a set of conserved
  Ser and Thr residues in its amino terminus. The phosphorylated form of β-catenin
  is recognized by an E3 ubiquitin ligase (β-TrCP) and then targeted to proteosomal
  degradation, resulting in low cytosolic levels. In the absence of nuclear β-catenin,
  T cell-specific factors (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (LEF) proteins repress
  target genes expression through a direct association with transcriptional inhibitors
  of the Groucho family and histone deacetylases (HDACs); B: In the presence of Wnt
  ligand, secreted Wnt binds to their receptor complex, consisting of Frizzled and
  one member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family (LRP5/6). This binding
  disrupts the ‘‘destruction complex’’ by recruiting Dishevelled (Dvl) to the cytoplasmic
  domain of Frizzled, which induces the delocalization of cytoplasmic Axin to the
  cytoplasmic tail of LRP and phosphorylation by CK1α and GSK3β of the latter. The
  disruption of the ‘‘destruction’’ complex prevents phosphorylation/degradation of
  β-catenin, leading to accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. Active ß-catenin
  translocates to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional co-activator with
  TCFLEF to activate Wnt-responsive target genes. Extracellular Wnt signaling can
  be inhibited by binding of members of the secreted frizzled related protein (sFRP)
  and Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF) families to Wnt ligands, or by the interaction of
  soluble Dickkopf (DKK) with LRP.'
