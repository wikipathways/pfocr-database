caption: 'FXR-mediated pathways in angiogenesis, vasodilation and fibrosis during
  portal hypertension. FXR pathway: FXR agonist enhances the expression of FXR, which
  enhances the expression of DDAH-1 and GTP cyclohydrolase-1. DDAH-1 can reduce the
  levels of ADMA and upregulate the expression of eNOS. GTP cyclohydrolase-1 can increase
  the expression of BH4. This synergistic enhancement of eNOS and BH4 activity has
  improved nitric oxide-mediated sinus endothelial function. In addition, FXR agonism
  reduces the inflammatory response by reducing the expression of iNOS and cyclooxygenase
  2 to improve PHT. FXR agonism decreases the expression of endothelin-1 and then
  inhibits HSC proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis, which can ameliorate
  fibrosis. Repressed endothelin-1 can increase the production of cystathionase-mediated
  hydrogen sulfide, which can cause vasodilation. ADMA: Asymmetric dimethylarginine;
  BH4: Tetrahydrobiopterin; DDAH-1: Dimethylarginine dimethylamidohydrolase-1; ECM:
  Extracellular matrix; eNOS: Endothelial nitric oxide synthase; FXR: Farnesoid X
  receptor; GCH-1: GTP cyclohydrolase-1; H2S: Hydrogen sulfide; HSC: Hepatic stellate
  cell; iNOS: Inducible nitric oxide synthase; NO: Nitric Oxide; SHR: Small heterodimer
