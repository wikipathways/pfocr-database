caption: A tight metabolic regulation of glutamine catabolism, gluconeogenesis, folate/methionine
  cycles and transsulfuration pathway, and the urea and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  is crucial for glutamine and nitrogen homeostasis. The pathway involved in the conjugation
  of phenylbutyrate (PA), a product of phenylbutyrate (PB) metabolism, to glutamine
  originating phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN) as well as the conjugation of benzoate
  to L-glycine is shown.
