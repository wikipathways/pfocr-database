caption: 'Loss-of-function mutation in the red-colored proteins and gain-of-function
  mutations in the green-colored proteins act as paqr-2 mutant suppressors. Note that
  there are likely two separate fluidity-promoting outputs of PAQR-2 signaling: one
  output promotes desaturase transcription while the other output regulates incorporation
  of PUFAs into phospholipids. Several previously showed that many paqr-2 suppressor
  mutations act by promoting desaturase upregulation, either via either SBP-1::MDT-15
  or NHR-49::MDT-15 (; ; ; ). In contrast, prior to this work only loss-of-function
  alleles of fld-1 had so far been identified as paqr-2 mutant suppressors that act
  as regulators of PUFA incorporation ().'
