caption: The role and signaling pathways of TCF21 in coronary heart disease. The TCF21
  risk alleles (rs12190287-C or rs12524865-C) might result in increased TCF21 expression
  upon activation of PDGF signaling, and WT1could inhibit AP-1 mediated transcription
  and c-Jun mediated rs12190287 activation, leading to reduced expression of TCF21.
  In addition, TCF21 could block the MYOCD-SRF pathway to inhibit the differentiation
  of VSMCs in atherosclerotic plaque.
