caption: 'Autophagy-related gene signaling pathway schematic. Autophagy can be mainly
  divided into five stages according to its development process: induction, autophagosome
  nucleation, autophagosome formation, lysosome fusion, and degradation. As shown
  in the diagram, the entire process is strictly regulated by over 36 autophagy-related
  genes and their corresponding proteins. The mammalian target of rapamycin is a key
  factor in autophagy. Mature autophagosomes can merge with lysosomes to form autolysosomes,
  which selectively remove proteins and damaged organelles through autophagy and participate
  in autophagic body formation. mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin.'
