caption: The complex regulation of cMyc downstream from mTORC1. (A) Upregulation of
  cMyc translation via increased eIF4A RNA helicase activity through the eIF4B–S6K
  pathway to resolve highly structured 5′ UTRs of Myc mRNA. (B) Enhanced cMyc activity
  through destabilization of MXD2 mRNA by mTORC1-mediated m6A modification. (C) Increased
  cMyc activity through the degradation of MAD1, the negative regulator of Myc, via
  mTORC1–S6K-mediated phosphorylation. (D) Induction of cMyc stability through the
  suppression of GSK3 nuclear translocation by mTORC1. (E) Growth factor or nutrient
  activation of AKT suppresses GSK3-mediated cMyc degradation through GSK3 phosphorylation.
