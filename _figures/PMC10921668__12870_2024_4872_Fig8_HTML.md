caption: 'Schematic of the early ATL80-dependent response to WDS and its presumed
  function in retrograde signaling pathways. The ATL80 response to WDS is depicted
  in two columns: one representing the condition before stress (0 min, light colors),
  and the other showing the response after 15 to 120 min following stress (darker
  colors). Upregulation and downregulation events are indicated by yellow and violet
  arrows, respectively. GO classes, categories, or individual genes are denoted. Below
  this representation, we illustrate the expression patterns of ATL80 along with other
  PRGs. We postulate that CAMTA TFs are involved in regulating the expression of this
  set of PRGs. On the right side of the figure, we outline the basic retrograde signaling
  pathways. The pathway triggered by H-light exposure involves the translocation of
  triose phosphate, a product of the Calvin-Benson cycle, from the chloroplast through
  a triose phosphate translocator (TPT). This process activates the kinase MPK6 and
  ERF/AP2 TFs. The GUN1–HSC70 complex initiates signaling, which is mediated by cytosolic
  chaperones HSP90 and HSP70. The PAP-SAL1 signaling pathway responds to drought and
  H-light stress [90]. We have encircled components that were both detected as DEGs
  in our ATL80 transcriptome and are involved in retrograde signaling with a cloud
  shape (ERF/AP2 and proteins associated with folding/refolding/HSP90/HSP70). We hypothesize
  that one or more components of the retrograde signaling pathways (highlighted in
  light gray) serve as targets for degradation by ATL80, indicated by the arrow pointing
  toward the shaded region, functioning as an alarm signal'
