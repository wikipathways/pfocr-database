caption: The regulation of cellular metabolism by p53. p53 regulates mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, glutaminolysis and fatty acid oxidation in
  cells. p53 transcriptionally induces SCO2, AIF and p53R2, and physically interacts
  with mtDNA Poly γ to maintain the mitochondrial integrity and promotes oxidative
  phosphorylation. p53 reduces glucose uptake through direct repression of the transcription
  of GLUT 1 & 4, and indirect repression of the expression of GLUT 3. p53 negatively
  regulates PGM at the protein level and transcriptionally induces TIGAR and Parkin
  to inhibit glycolysis. Parkin positively regulates PDH, which converts pyruvate
  into acetyl-CoA. p53 negatively regulates the expression of PDK2, which phosphorylates
  and inhibits the PDH activity. p53 induces the expression of GLS2, which catalyzes
  the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate. The latter can be further converted into
  α-KG (α-ketoglutarate). By increasing the levels of α-KG, GLS2 promotes TCA cycle
  and oxidative phosphorylation. p53 physically interacts with G6PD to negatively
  regulate the activity of G6PD, and thereby down-regulates PPP (pentose phosphate
  pathway), a pathway critical for nucleotide synthesis and NADPH production. p53
  induces the expression of GAMT and Lipin1 to promote fatty acid oxidation. By producing
  acetyl-CoA, fatty acid oxidation contributes to the maintenance of TCA cycle and
  mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
