caption: A model of the plant salt tolerance mechanism regulated by hormones under
  salt stress. (A) Salt stress induces an increase in ABA levels. The enhanced binding
  of ABA to PYR/PYL/RCAR alters its conformation and promotes its interaction with
  PP2C, thereby inhibiting the activity of PP2C and stimulating the activity of SnRK2.
  The formation of the PYR/PYL/RCAR-PP2C-SnRK2 complex is a crucial component of the
  ABA signaling pathway. This complex phosphorylates bZIPs, enhancing its activity.
  Subsequently, bZIPs translocate to the nucleus to regulate the expression of ABA-responsive
  genes. Additionally, the complex can phosphorylate SLAC1 and KAT1 on the plasma
  membrane, facilitating stomatal closure. ABA can also induce stomatal closure through
  NADPH oxidase-mediated hydrogen peroxide production. (B) Under normal conditions,
  the interaction between IAA and TIR1 leads to the ubiquitination and degradation
  of Aux/IAA, thereby alleviating the inhibition of Aux/IAA on the activity of the
  ARF transcription factor. However, under salt stress, the reduced expression of
  TIR1 prevents the degradation of Aux/IAA, resulting in the continued inhibition
  of ARF transcription factor activity. (C) DELLA acts as a negative regulator in
  the GA signal transduction pathway. GA forms a complex with GID1 and DELLA, leading
  to the degradation of DELLA and thereby alleviating its inhibitory effect on GA-responsive
  genes. Under salt stress, the GA/GID1 complex binds to the N-terminus of DELLA,
  inducing a conformational change in DELLA that prevents GID2 from binding to it.
  As a result, DELLA is not degraded, which allows it to maintain its inhibitory effect
  on gene transcription. The cross means that this process is inhibited. (D) JA, induced
  by salt stress, is recognized by COI1, forming the COI1-JA complex. This complex
  releases JAZ from its association with co-repressors (NINJA, TPL), which normally
  inhibit the transcription of JA-responsive genes. Subsequently, JAZ undergoes ubiquitination
  and is degraded by the 26S proteasome, thereby removing the inhibition on the transcription
  of JA-responsive genes. ABA, abscisic acid; PP2C, protein phosphatase 2C; SnRK2,
