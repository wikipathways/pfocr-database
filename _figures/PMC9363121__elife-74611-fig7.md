caption: (A) Our study reveals two major roles of Banp in cell-cycle regulation of
  retinal progenitor cells. In general, DNA replication stress, DSBs, and chromosome
  segregation defects induce genomic instability, which causes cancer or cell death.
  In S phase, Banp may suppress DNA replication stress by promoting transcription
  of the wrnip1, which protects stalled replication forks and promotes replication
  restart after replication stress. Failure of recovery from DNA replication stress
  induces DSBs, which activate ATM/Chk2/tp53-mediated DNA damage response. Banp may
  promote DNA damage repair in concert with tp53. ATR also activates tp53 through
  activation of Chk1 or crosstalk with ATM. Banp may suppress genotoxic stress-mediated
  DNA replication stress and DSBs. In M phase, Banp is required for chromosome segregation
  by promoting transcription of two mitotic regulators, cenpt and ncapg. Since a Banp
  motif is found near TSSs of the cenpt, ncapg and wrnip1 genes, it is likely that
  these genes are direct targets of Banp. Dotted arrows indicate proposed regulatory
  pathway, which will be necessary to investigate in the future. (B) banprw337 mutant
  phenotypes along the cell-cycle progression and neurogenesis. In banp mutants, stalled
  DNA replication and subsequent DSBs are accumulated, leading to increase in γ-H2AX+
  cells. These DNA damaged cells undergo apoptosis. In M phase, mitosis is markedly
  prolonged due to chromosome segregation defects; however, almost all mitoses are
  eventually completed, so it is less likely that M phase defects directly link to
  apoptosis. It is possible that a fraction of γ-H2AX+ cells survive and enter M phase,
  so DNA damage is inherited by daughter cells, which reenter the cell-cycle or differentiate
  into postmitotic neurons. Neuron with a high level of γ-H2AX+ signals may undergo
  apoptosis. Thus, S phase defects and M phase defects influence each other through
  cell-cycle progression in banp mutants. Red lines indicate path of γ-H2AX+ cells.
