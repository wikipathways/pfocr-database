caption: Proposed pathways of Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced maturation and activation
  of dendritic cells (DCs) mediated by E1. Our data show that Ang II increases E1
  activation. On the one hand, E1 promotes degradation of mitogen-activated protein
  kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) through the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway,
  which in turn enhances the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) pathways; On the other
  hand, E1 enhances K63-linked ubiquitination of tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) essential modulator (NEMO), which
  results in activation of inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK), degradation of inhibitor
  of NF-κB (IκBα) and activation of NF-κB leading to the maturation and activation
  of DCs in response to Ang II stimulation. While the E1 inhibitor PYR41 suppresses
  Ang II-induced actions on DCs.
