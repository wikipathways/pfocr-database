caption: 'Comprehensive schematic diagram of cross-regulation of ferroptosis and immunogenic
  cell death. (Ionizing radiation activates the ferroptosis core pathway by triggering
  ROS bursts and lipid peroxidation: on the one hand, it upregulates ACSL4, which
  promotes the integration of PUFAs into cell membrane phospholipids and enhances
  oxidative sensitivity; on the other hand, it inhibits cystine/glutamate antiporter
  (system Xc⁻, composed of SLC7A11/SLC3A2), which leads to a decrease in GSH synthesis
  and loss of GPX4 activity, ultimately triggering ferroptosis. Radiation-induced
  tumor cell death releases DAMPs, such as ATP and HMGB1, which initiate antigen presentation
  and recruit CD8+ T cells to form an adaptive immune response. At the level of the
  immune microenvironment, ionizing radiation and the ferroptosis inducer PIN (sulfasalazine)
  can have a synergistic effect: IFN-γ inhibits SLC7A11 expression through the JAK-STAT1
  signaling pathway, blocking the antioxidant defense of tumor cells; at the same
  time, the STAT1-IRF1 complex upregulates ACSL4, amplifying the lipid peroxidation
  effect and significantly increasing ferroptosis sensitivity. M1 macrophages secrete
  pro-inflammatory factors driven by IFN-γ to activate anti-tumor immunity; and PD-L1
  blockers can relieve the inhibition of tumor cells on T cells and enhance the killing
  function of CD8+ T cells. Neutrophils release free iron and myeloperoxidase (MPO)
  through NETosis, directly oxidizing the tumor cell membrane and accelerating the
  process of ferroptosis. The comprehensive treatment strategy is a combination of
  RT-MPs, Fe3O4-SAS@PLT, TGF-β inhibitors, and other methods to regulate immune cells
  such as M2 macrophages and CD8+ T cells. By targeting metabolic plasticity and differentiation
  plasticity, a comprehensive anti-tumor mechanism of radiation combined with immune
  activation and ferroptosis induction is formed). (Created by Figdraw)'
