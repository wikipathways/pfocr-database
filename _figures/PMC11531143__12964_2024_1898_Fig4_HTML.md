caption: A PIM1-mediated signaling pathways in lung cancer. The overexpression of
  PIM1 in lung adenocarcinoma leads to the phosphorylation of eIF4B at S406. This
  phosphorylated eIF4B then accelerates c-MET mRNA translation, which in turn enhances
  the RAS/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and STAT3 pathways in collaboration with oncogenic drivers,
  resulting in heightened cell proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion. PIM
  kinases also affect mitochondrial dynamics, ROS production, and the response to
  chemotherapy in lung cancer. Inhibiting PIM1 significantly raises the protein levels
  and mitochondrial localization of Drp1, causing marked fragmentation of mitochondria,
  free radical generation, and apoptosis. B PIM1 promotes colorectal cancer (CRC)
  via several mechanisms. PIM1 is integrated into a complex regulatory network involving
  mitogenic and antiapoptotic signals. Inhibiting PIM1 has been found to result in
  significant changes in oncogenic signal transduction, affecting p21Cip1/WAF1, STAT3,
  c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), c-Myc, and survivin, as well as the levels of apoptosis-related
  proteins Puma, Bax, and Bcl-xL. PIM1 facilitates the Warburg effect in CRC cells.
  When glucose is scarce, AMPK is activated through phosphorylation, leading to the
  upregulation of PIM1 expression. PIM1 then stimulates the expression of several
  glycolytic enzymes, such as HK2 and LDHA. Additionally, the Warburg effect is intensified
  as a compensatory mechanism to enhance the survival and proliferation of CRC cells.
  The proliferation of CRC is facilitated by TAB3 through the upregulation of PIM1
  expression. TAB3 modulates the activity of PIM1 via the STAT3 signaling pathway.
  From a mechanistic standpoint, TAB3 regulates the expression of PIM1 by stimulating
  the phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 through the formation of the TAB3-TAK1-STAT3
  complex. Therefore, targeting specific inhibitors that affect this TAB3-TAK1-STAT3
  complex may hold promise as potential therapeutic agents for CRC. Green circles
  show activating phosphorylation events. Green and red arrows represent activating
  and inactivating pathways, respectively
