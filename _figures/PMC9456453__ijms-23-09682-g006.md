caption: USP48 downregulation induces the activation of the NF-κB pathway. In control
  (scControl) untreated conditions, p65 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκBα. Upon
  TNFα stimulation, IκBα is phosphorylated by the IKKα:IKKβ:NEMO complex, resulting
  in IκBα ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. As a consequence,
  the liberated p65 translocates to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription
  of target genes and can interact with USP48. When USP48 is downregulated (siUSP48),
  p65 levels increase –mainly in the nucleus– inducing the transcriptional activation
  of NF-κB target genes, even without TNFα stimulation. The levels of p65 further
  increase in the nucleus upon TNFα treatment, in an additive response, thus resulting
  in further transactivation of target genes.
