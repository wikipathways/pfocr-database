caption: 'The main effects and mechanisms of berberine on cancers. Berberine could
  reduce cancer cell proliferation by binding RXRα and subsequently suppressing β-catenin
  function, upregulating miR-214-3p and reducing SCT; berberine could attenuate cell
  cycle by inhibiting the levels of CDK1, CDK4, cyclin A, and cyclin D1, and increasing
  the levels of p21, p27, p38; berberine could inhibit the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway to
  cause cell cycle arrest and inhibit metastasis; berberine could reduce transcriptional
  activities of MMP-2 and u-PA to inhibit metastasis; berberine could enhance the
  levels of E-cadherin, subsequently decrease the level of N-cadherin and snail-1,
  and ultimately inhibit metastasis; berberine could promote DNA damage through downregulating
  the level of TOP2β and then induce apoptosis; berberine could promote apoptosis
  through activation of STAT3 via inhibiting the phosphorylation of EGFR, increasing
  the expression of Bcl-x, and downregulating the expression of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2;
  berberine could induce apoptosis by suppressing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
  and upregulating the expression of miR-203; berberine could inhibit the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway, and enhance the expressions of LC3B-II to promote autophagy; berberine
  could induce autophagy via JNK/Beclin1 pathway; berberine could regulate gut microbiota
  by increasing beneficial gut bacteria Clostridiales, Bacteroidale, and Lactobacillaceae.
