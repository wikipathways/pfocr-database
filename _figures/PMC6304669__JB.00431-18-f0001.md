caption: Reconstruction of hexuronate and aldarate utilization metabolic pathways
  and regulons in proteobacteria. The oxidative pathway for utilization of d-glucoronate
  and d-galacturonate (hexuronates) described in this work in the Burkholderiaceae,
  Comamonadaceae, Halomonadaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae feeds the downstream catabolic
  pathway for d-glucarate and meso-galactarate (aldarates). Two alternative aldarate
  catabolic pathways were described for E. coli (GarR-GarL) and Acinetobacter baylyi
  (KdgD and KgsD). The alternative hexuronate catabolic pathway known in E. coli and
  several other lineages of proteobacteria is shown in the gray box. Four novel TFs
  identified in this work as cognate regulators of the hexuronate and aldarate utilization
  pathway genes are shown in colored ovals, and their predicted target genes are marked
  by circles of corresponding colors. Numbers in circles show the number of genomes
  where the target gene is preceded by a candidate binding site for GguR (black),
  GudR (blue), UdhR (purple), and GulR (green) regulators. Known and predicted transporters
  for hexuronates and aldarates are shown in the pink box. New transporters and enzymes
  identified in this work are marked with an asterisk.
