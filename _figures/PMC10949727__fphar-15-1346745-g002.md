caption: Mechanism of FOXO3a regulating apoptosis and cell cycle in breast cancer.
  FOXO3a can activate the endogenous mitochondrial signaling pathway in breast cancer
  cells, causing changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability, loss of transmembrane
  potential and release of cytochrome c. Immediately afterwards, cytochrome c forms
  a complex with Apaf-1 and Pro-cas-9, which ultimately promotes apoptosis. Also induces
  the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. FOXO3a can also promote the expression of FasL
  mRNA to induce cell extrinsic apoptosis. FOXO3a can promote the expression of p21Cip1
  and p27kip1 and inhibit the expression of cyclinD1 and CyclinB to induce breast
  cancer cell cycle arrest
