caption: Neurotrophic and neuroprotective pathways targeted by lithium. BDNF receptor
  (Trk-B) activation activates the ERK/MAPK pathway, which inhibits GSK-3β (a critical
  cellular target and effector for diverse proteins) and bad. This activation increases
  the expression of nuclear CREB, in turn facilitating the expression of neurotrophic/neuroprotective
  proteins such as bcl-2 and BDNF itself. Mitochondrial bcl-2 also inhibits pro-apoptotic
  activation of bad, as well as consequent mitochondrial increases of calcium influx
  and cytochrome c release. Dysregulated intracellular calcium levels, which may increase
  the risk of cellular apoptosis, have been associated with the pathophysiology of
  bipolar disorder. Lithium downregulates ER calcium release via an IP3 Rdependent
  mechanism, and also increases bcl-2 expression, which improves mitochondrial stability
  and prevents the activation of apoptotic cascades. IMPase, also directly inhibited
  by lithium, recycles IP3. In addition, cellular signaling through Wnt glycoproteins
  and frizzled receptors inhibits GSK-3β. Lithium's inhibition of GSK-3β prevents
  β-catenin phosphorylation and stimulates its translocation to the nucleus, thus
  targeting the transcription of specific genes activating neurotrophic effects and
  synaptogenesis. Different neurotransmitters target receptors coupled to G proteins.
  Among these, D1, D5, and β-adrenergic receptors are coupled to G α stimulatory proteins
  that activate AC; H3, D2, D3, and D4 receptors are coupled to Gα inhibitory proteins
  that inhibit AC; serotonergic, α1-adrenergic, M1, M3, and M5 receptors are coupled
  to Gq/11, which activates PLC. PLC, in turn, hydrolyses PIP2 to IP3 and DAG. DAG
  activates PKC, which plays a significant role in regulating pre- and postsynaptic
  aspects of neurotransmission and diverse cellular processes. Lithium also indirectly
  inhibits PKC. The text provides a complete description of these interactions. Arrows
  represent ‘activation’, perpendicular lines represent ‘inhibition’, and dotted lines
  represent ‘indirect effects’. bad = bcl-2-associated death promoter; bag-1 = bcl-2-associated
  athanogene; GPCR = G-protein-coupled receptors; IP3R = IP3 receptor; MARCKS = myristoylated
