caption: The diagram shows that activation of CaR increases TNF production, via activation
  of the NFAT5 (Ton/EBP) transcription factor, which subsequently increases COX-2-derived
  PGE2synthesis. The regulation of NKCC2 by TNF is postulated to include a mechanism
  involving COX-2 as well as a COX-independent pathway that may be important under
  basal conditions.
