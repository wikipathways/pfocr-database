caption: Schematic representation of potential retinoic acid (RA) inhibition-related
  adverse outcome pathway (AOP). Inhibition of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH)
  by known or unknown inhibitors potentially induces decreased cytosolic retinoic
  acid (RA) levels, which in turn, changes target gene expression, leads to abnormal
  embryonic eye development at individual level, and finally results in population
  decline of teleosts.
