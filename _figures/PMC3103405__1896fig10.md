caption: Proposed model for the regulation of Dpr genes. In response to oxidative
  stress, cAMP is synthesized by the adenylyl cyclase AcyA. Due to high levels of
  cAMP, protein kinase A (PKA) is activated. In parallel, oxidative stress also activates
  signal transduction via the SakA-related MAPK pathway. Both pathways converge on
  the bZIP transcription factor AtfA. Once activated, AtfA binds to the promoter of
  its target gene DprA to positively regulate its transcription. In response to osmotic
  stress, the signal is transduced via the SakA-related MAPK pathway to activate a
  hypothetical osmotic stress regulator (OsrA), leading to the transcription of DprB.
  When subjected to pH-related stress, the signal is transduced via the extracellular
  pH response pathway (Pal) pathway mediated by the zinc finger transcription factor
  PacC. PacC binds to the promoter of DprB to positively regulate its transcription.
