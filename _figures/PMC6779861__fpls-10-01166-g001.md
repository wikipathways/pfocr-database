caption: Schematic overview of major terpenoid biosynthetic pathways. All terpenoids
  are derived from two isomeric 5-carbon precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP),
  and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). In turn, IPP and DMAPP are formed via two
  pathways, the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway originating from acetyl-CoA and
  the pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P)–derived 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate
  (MEP) pathway located in the plastids. However, active transfers of IPP, DMAPP,
  GPP, and FPP across the plastidial membrane enable some degree of pathway cross-talk.
  In addition, interconversion of IPP and DMAPP with their respective monophosphate
  forms IP and DMAP by IP kinase (IPK) and Nudix hydrolase enzymes can impact pathway
  flux in terpenoid metabolism. Except for isoprene and hemiterpene (C5) biosynthesis,
  condensation of IPP and DMAPP units generates prenyl diphosphate intermediates of
  different chain length. Condensation of IPP and DMAPP yields geranyl diphosphate
  (GPP) as the precursor to monoterpenoids (C10), fusing GPP with an additional IPP
  affords the sesquiterpenoid (C15) precursor farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and fusing
  FPP with IPP generates geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) en route to diterpenoids
  (C20). Furthermore, condensation of two FPP or two GGPP molecules forms the central
  substrates of triterpenoid (C30) and carotenoids (C40), respectively. Terpene synthases
  (TPS) are key gatekeepers in the biosynthesis of C10–C20 terpenoids, catalyzing
  the committed scaffold-forming conversion of the respective prenyl diphosphate substrates
  into a range of hydrocarbon or oxygenated structures. These TPS products can then
  undergo various oxygenations through the activity of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases
  (P450), followed by further possible functional decorations, ultimately giving rise
  to more than 80,000 distinct natural products. AACT, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; CMK,
