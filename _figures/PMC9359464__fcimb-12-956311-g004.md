caption: The interaction between TLRs and MTB infection. TLRs play a vital role in
  TB infection. Toll-like receptors are divided into plasma membrane-anchored TLRs
  and endosomal TLRs according to the localization of TLR proteins. As TLRs are activated,
  they activate downstream IRAK, TNFR and TRAF-6 through the MyD88-dependent signaling
  pathway, further activating NF-kB and AP-1 and producing a series of inflammatory
  reactions.
