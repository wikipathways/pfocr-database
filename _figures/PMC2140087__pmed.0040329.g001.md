caption: The bladder urothelium (A) is a pseudostratified transitional epithelium
  lined by large facet cells. These cells have an apical asymmetric unit membrane
  containing uroplakins that help form the impermeable bladder barrier and also serve
  as receptors for UPEC. Bacteria introduced into the bladder adhere to the bladder
  surface via type 1 pili (B). Upon attachment, bacteria are able to invade (C) and
  replicate (D) within the facet cell cytoplasm. UPEC form large biofilm-like IBCs
  within these cells (E). Ultimately the bacteria flux out of their intracellular
  niche (G), some adopting a filamentous morphology; they then adhere to other host
  cells and re-enter the infectious cycle. During this process, infected urothelial
  cells are sloughed into the urine (F) and neutrophils are recruited to the site
  of infection.
