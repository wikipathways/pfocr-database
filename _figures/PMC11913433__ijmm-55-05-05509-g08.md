caption: Mechanism by which m6A modification-mediated MTHFD2 upregulation drives tumor-promoting
  effects via the PEBP1-RAF1/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. METTL3 and IGF2BP2, which
  collaboratively induce m6A modification at position 1,080 of MTHFD2 mRNA, enhancing
  its stability and expression. Elevated MTHFD2 levels correlate with poor prognosis
  in ESCC patients. Mechanistically, MTHFD2 interacts with PEBP1, disrupting PEBP1's
  interaction with RAF1 and consequently activating the RAF1/MEK/ERK pathway. ESCC,
  esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; MTHFD2, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase
  2; METTL3, methyltransferase-like 3; IGF2BP2, insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA
  binding protein 2; PEBP1, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1; RAF, Raf-1
  proto-oncogene; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1; ERK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase 1
