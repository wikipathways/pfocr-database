caption: A schematic model describing mitochondrial quality control mediated by UBR1/2/4
  in response to the mitochondrial damage. (A) PINK1 is continuously imported into
  healthy mitochondria through TOM and TIM complexes under steady-state conditions.
  After which, the precursor PINK1 is cleaved by MPP and PARL proteases, respectively.
  PARL cleaves between Ala103 and Phe104 of PINK1 to expose phenylalanine, a known
  type-2 destabilizing residue of the Arg/N-degron pathway, at the N-terminus. The
  cleaved PINK1 is released into the cytosol. Phe104-PINK is recognized by UBR1, UBR2,
  and UBR4 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. (B) When depolarization
  or mitochondrial import is blocked, PINK1 accumulates on the OMM. The accumulation
  and autophosphorylation of PINK1 recruit Parkin E3 ligase from the cytosol to the
  mitochondria, leading to the degradation of damaged mitochondria through mitophagy.
