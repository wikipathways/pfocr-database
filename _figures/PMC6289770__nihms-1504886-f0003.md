caption: The lipoyl relay pathway of lipoyl-protein assembly.A. This pathway has been
  demonstrated in the Firmicute bacteria, B. subtilis [–] and Staphyloccus aureus
  []. Lipoyl moieties are assembled on the GcvH protein of the glycine cleavage system
  and then transferred to the lipoyl domains (LDs) of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases.
  This pathway requires LipM, a distinct octanoyl transferase to transfer octanoate
  from octanoyl-ACP to GcvH via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The LipA radical SAM
  enzyme then inserts two sulfur atoms into octanoyl-GcvH to produce dihydrolipoyl-GcvH.
  The amide linkage of dihydrolipoylGcvH is then attacked by the lipoyl amidotransferase
  LipL which transfers the dihydrolipoyl moiety to the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase LDs.
  GcvH is required for 2oxoacid dehydrogenase lipoylation in these bacteria in addition
  to its role in glycine cleavage []. B. For comparison the straightforward E. coli
  pathway which illustrates the two-step sulfur insertion catalyzed by LipA is illustrated.
