caption: Signaling cascade following TLR2/TLR4, TLR7/TLR8, and TLR3 activation with
  envelope glycoprotein, ssRNA, and dsRNA, respectively. MyD88 and TRIF are the adaptor
  proteins that initiate the different pathways activating IRF3, IRF7 (pDCs only),
  NF-κB, and AP-1 in order to induce the antiviral response. NF-κB and AP-1 combine
  to induce the transcription of inflammatory cytokines. IRF3/IRF7 in association
  with both NF-κB and AP-1 form the enhanceosome for the transcription of IFN-β/IFN-α,
  respectively. In addition, IRF7 also has some IFN-β-stimulatory effect (not shown
  in the figure). (…), pathway outlined elsewhere in the illustration.
