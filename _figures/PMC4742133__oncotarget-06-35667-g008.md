caption: The Bim expression levels were significantly increased in response to ABT-737
  treatment in MC-3 human mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells, whereas Bim phosphorylation
  by ERK1/2 on serine 69 promotes its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation
  in HN22 human oral squamous carcinoma cells. The inactivation of the ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway by ABT-737 treatment reduces the Bim expression levels via both transcriptional
  and posttranslational regulation in a cell type-dependent manner, inducing mitochondria-mediated
  apoptosis of human oral cancer cells.
