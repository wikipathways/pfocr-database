caption: Bidirectional Modification of Corticostriatal synapses. Plasticity within
  the striatum is believed to underlie the development of habitual patterns of thought
  and behavior. A. The cortex sends a massive projection to the striatum. Neurons
  in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and adjacent ventral tegmental area
  (VTA) provide the neuromodulator dopamine. B. At the medium spiny neuron (MSN),
  cortical fibers form glutamate synapses with the heads of dendritic spines and dopamine-containing
  varicosities lie at the spine neck. C. Corticostriatal connections can be strengthened
  (long-term potentiation, LTP) or weakened (long-term depression, LTD). At MSNs belonging
  to the indirect pathway, dopamine (DA) acting at D2 receptors promotes LTD, which
  is mediated via retrograde endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling at presynaptic CB1 receptors.
  LTP is driven by adenosine at A2A receptors and glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartic acid
  receptors. Drugs that promote LTD (or block LTP) have propsychotic properties. Drugs
  promoting LTP are antipsychotic.
