caption: 'Effect of mangiferin in diabetic nephropathy. The pathophysiology of diabetic
  nephropathy is multifaceted, involving metabolic and hemodynamic alterations, chronic
  inflammation, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and oxidative stress.
  The activation of AGEs, autoxidation of glucose, and xanthine oxidase activity are
  some of the most likely main sources of ROS production. PKC isoforms, TGF-β1 pathways,
  and NF-kB were found to be implicated in diabetic nephropathy''s oxidative stress-mediated
  signaling cascades. In the hyperglycemic state, TNF-α was produced, which activated
  caspase 8, cleaved Bid to tBid, and finally activated the mitochondria-dependent
  apoptotic pathway. Following hyperglycemia, mangiferin therapy successfully suppressed
  all of these alterations and preserved the cells from apoptosis. Several novel markers
  for early disease detection have emerged from the pathologic processes of underlying
  renal dysfunction and damage. In normoalbuminuric patients with diabetes mellitus
  type 1, poor glycemic control is an independent predictor of progression to proteinuria
  (albuminuria). Abbreviations: AGEs, Advanced glycation end products; Bax, Bcl-2-associated X protein;
