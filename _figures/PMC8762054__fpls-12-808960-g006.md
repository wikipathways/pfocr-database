caption: 'Regulation of CBF/DREB1 pathway by ABA and light signaling. The activated
  CBF-cold-responsive (COR) cold-signaling pathway increases cold tolerance. Transcription
  of CBF1/DREB1B, CBF2/DREB1C, and CBF3/DREB1A is regulated oppositely by ABA signaling
  via the cold-activated SnRK2.6-ICE1 pathway and light signaling via CCA1/LHY. CCA1
  and LHY suppress the expression of DREB1s under unstressed conditions and are rapidly
  degraded in response to cold (), allowing activation of the CBF-COR cold signaling
  pathway. In turn, CBF proteins, accumulated in response to cold, interact with PIF3
  and prevent PIF3 degradation with subsequent de-repression of COR genes. Abbreviations:
  ABFs, abscisic acid responsive elements-binding factors; PIF3, transcription factor
  PIF3; OST1/SnRK2.6, SNF1-related protein kinase 2.6; ICE1, inducer of CBP expression
  1; CCA1, circadian clock associated 1; LHY, protein late elongated hypocotyl; CBFs/DREBs,
  dehydration-responsive element-binding proteins.'
