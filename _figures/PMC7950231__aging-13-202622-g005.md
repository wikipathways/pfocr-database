caption: The induction of type I interferons and signalling leading to the innate
  immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug pair action site. The route
  consists of two parts. The pink boxes represent virus proteins and the blue boxes
  represent the targets of type I interference induction and signalling during SARS-CoV-2
  infection. Green boxes represent part of the pathway of type I interferon-mediated
  innate immunity. Yellow boxes represent intersection targets between EG and novel
  coronavirus pneumonia. Different forms of lines represent interactions between targets.
