caption: Theoretical model of MC4R dimer activation. R represents the MC4R monomer,
  RR the MC4R dimer and RR* the activated state of the dimer. A In case of MC4R-WT
  homo-dimerization or dimerization of WT-MC4R with a mutant MC4R that does not cause
  a dominant negative effect ligand stimulation result in a shift of the equilibrium
  to the activated state RR* that allows efficient coupling to the Gs/adenylyl cyclase
  pathway. B In case of MC4R dimerization with a dominant negative mutant receptor
  (Rm) the receptor dimer is trapped in the inactive state in which a shift to the
  activated state is alterated.
