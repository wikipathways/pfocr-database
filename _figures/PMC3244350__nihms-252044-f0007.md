caption: Cartoon representations of the signaling pathways discussed in this review.
  (a) The calcineurin-NFAT pathway in T cells. Ligand binding to the T cell receptor
  triggers an initial cytoplasmic Ca2+ signal via phospholipase Cγ, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3), and release of Ca2+ from ER stores; and a sustained Ca2+ signal via the ER
  Ca2+ sensor STIM1 and plasma membrane ORAI1 calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC)
  channels. The channels providing a sustained or repetitive calcium signal can be
  different in other types of cells. Elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ activates calmodulin
  and calcineurin, and calcineurin dephosphorylates the transcription factor NFAT,
  causing NFAT to translocate into the nucleus and initiate gene transcription. (b)
  The calcineurin-Crz1 pathway in yeast. When yeast grow under conditions of physiological
  stress, Ca2+ is released into the cytoplasm from the vacuole or other sources, and
  calcineurin is activated. The transcription factor Crz1 is dephosphorylated, translocates
  into the nucleus, and activates genes involved in the stress response. (c) Background
  K+ conductance in neurons. In response to elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+, calcineurin
  dephosphorylates the 2PK channel TRESK, resulting in increased plasma membrane K+
  conductance, and lowering neuronal excitability or firing rate. The cartoon depicts
  only one of the two TRESK monomers that form the channel. (d) Crosstalk between
  calcium signaling and MAP kinase signaling. In response to calcium signals, calcineurin
  dephosphorylates the scaffold protein KSR2 at phosphoserine residues including a
  14-3-3 protein target site. KSR2 translocates to the plasma membrane and facilitates
  the activation of ERK by scaffolding Raf-MEK-ERK signaling complexes. (e) Long-term
  depression (LTD) in hippocampal neurons. AKAP79 positions calcineurin at the postsynaptic
  density through an association with other scaffold proteins such as PSD-95 and SAP-97.
  Calcineurin, thus positioned, responds to NMDA receptor activation and the resulting
  Ca2+ influx by dephosphorylating Ser845 of GluR1 and triggering the internalization
  of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane. (f) Negative and positive regulation
  of calcineurin by RCAN1. The expression of RCAN1 is induced by calcineurin-NFAT
  signaling, and unphosphorylated RCAN functions in a feedback loop to inhibit calcineurin.
  Phosphorylation by the kinases GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) or TAK1 (TGF-β
  activated kinase 1) converts RCAN1 into a facilitator of calcineurin signaling.
  GSK3 phosphorylates RCAN1 at Ser108 after priming phosphorylation by a MAP kinase
  at Ser 112. TAK1 phosphorylates RCAN1 at Ser94 and Ser136. Calcineurin dephosphorylates
  the GSK3 target site, presumably damping the action of the kinase and the phosphorylated
  RCAN1 (i). Calcineurin is not known to dephosphorylate the TAK1 target sites, but
  activated calcineurin dephosphorylates and inhibits the TAK1/TAB1/TAB2 kinase complex,
  thereby opposing its action on RCAN1 (ii).
