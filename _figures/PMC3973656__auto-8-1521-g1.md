caption: Figure 1. HDAC inhibitor-induced autophagy and cell death. HDAC inhibitors
  can induce autophagy by inactivating MTORC1 and consequently activating the upstream
  component of the autophagy pathway, the ULK1 complex. Additionally, HDAC inhibition
  can also lead to the transcriptional upregulation of LC3, and possibly enhanced
  acetylation of autophagy proteins, such as ULK1, ATG3 and ATG7. These events may
  further augment autophagy once autophagy is activated through the ULK1 complex.
  Autophagy in turn plays a survival role in attenuating both apoptotic and nonapoptotic
  cell death induced by HDAC inhibitors.
