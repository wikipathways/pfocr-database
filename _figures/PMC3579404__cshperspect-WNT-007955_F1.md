caption: Conserved Wnt pathway branches and components. In the absence of Wnt signals,
  glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) binds Axin and APC to form the β-catenin destruction
  complex. Some Wnt proteins, such as Wnt8 and Wnt3a, stimulate Frizzled and LRP5/6
  receptors to inhibit GSK3 activity and stabilize β-catenin (β-cat). Stabilized β-cat
  forms a complex with T-cell factors (e.g., TCF1/LEF1) to activate target genes.
  Moreover, GSK3 inhibition leads to target gene derepression by promoting TCF3 phosphorylation
  by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) through an unknown mechanism,
  for which β-catenin is required as a scaffold. This phosphorylation results in TCF3
  removal from target promoters and gene activation. Other Wnt proteins, such as Wnt5a
  and Wnt11, use distinct receptors such as ROR2 and RYK, in addition to Frizzled,
  to control the the cytoskeletal organization through core planar cell polarity (PCP)
  proteins, small GTPases (Rho/Rac/Cdc42), and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK).
