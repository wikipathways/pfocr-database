caption: Proteolytic cleavage of CDCP1 contributes to enhanced tumor cell survival
  and motility through the FAK and Akt signaling pathways downstream of complex formation
  between cleaved CDCP1 and β1 integrin. Schematic depicts a sequence of events that
  follow proteolytic cleavage of the cell surface CDCP1 molecule, consisting of three
  extracellular CUB domains, a transmembrane domain (TM) and a C-terminal domain (CT)
  containing several tyrosine residues (Tyr). Specifically, the serine protease plasmin
  executes singular cleavage of the full-length 135-kDa CDCP1, clipping off a 65-kDa
  fragment and generating the 70-kDa membrane-retained fragment. This 70-kDa fragment
  serves as a docking platform for Src family kinases, including Src. If the activity
  of Src kinase is inhibited by the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the cleaved CDCP1 does
  not become phosphorylated although inactive Src still docks onto the C-terminus
  of cleaved 70-kDa CDCP1. If cytoplasmic Src is active (phosphorylated, pSrc), CDCP1-bound
  pSrc phosphorylates the C-terminus of CDCP1 (70-kDa pCDCP1). Phosphorylation of
  70-kDa CDCP1 at Tyr residues facilitates docking of PKCδ, which becomes activated
  (pPKCδ) by CDCP1-bound active Src. The phosphorylated 70-kDa CDCP1 forms stable
  complexes with β1 integrins (e.g., α2β1), which in turn enhances phosphorylation
  of integrin-associated FAK (pFAK) and leads to PI3K-dependent activation of Akt.
  Inhibition of FAK activity (e.g, by specific FAK inhibitor 14) prevents FAK phosphorylation,
  leading to diminished phosphorylation of Akt (pAkt). Akt activation downstream of
  FAK can be abrogated completely through inhibition of the direct activator of Akt,
  PI3K (e.g, by wortmannin). Ultimately, the inhibition of FAK/PI3K/Akt pathway reduces
  signaling for cell survival and motility. While CDCP1 cleavage signaling is crucial
  for tumor cell survival during late stages of metastasis, namely tissue colonization
  at the secondary sites, cleaved CDCP1 signals for enhanced motility during early
  stages of spontaneous dissemination, namely cell escape from the primary tumor,
  stromal invasion and intravasation. Synergistically, these motility-involving processes
  contribute to enhanced metastatic dissemination of aggressive CDCP1-expressing tumor
  cells.
