caption: 'Synthetic pathways for polar lipids. The black arrows indicate the               bacterial
  and eukaryotic pathway, and the red arrows denote the               archaeal pathway.
  The red striped arrows show hypothetical steps               in the archaeal pathway.
  The names or EC numbers in rectangles               indicate the enzymes responsible
  for the corresponding steps.               Experimentally identified archaeal enzymes
  are indicated by               characters reverse-printed on red. Bacterial and
  eukaryotic               enzymes belonging to the CDP alcohol phosphatidyltransferase               family
  are shown in green rectangles. Enzymes in rectangles with               blue frames
  are involved in the synthesis of lipids with choline.               Abbreviations:
