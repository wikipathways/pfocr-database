caption: LRP6 and WNT/β-catenin pathway alterations in epithelial cancers. (A) In
  colorectal cancer (CRC), LRP6 overexpression is observed in 61% of malignant tissues
  isolated from patients. (i) Mutations in the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF43,
  (ii) downregulation of the antagonist DKK1 and (iii) overactivation of the RAS/MAPK
  pathway result in the recruitment of degradation complex components at the membrane
  and WNT/β-catenin pathway overactivation. (B) In hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs),
  LRP6 is overexpressed in 45%–75% of HCC tumours. Downregulation of miR-126-3p, miR-202
  and single-nucleotide polymorphism of miR-1269 result in increased LRP6 mRNA stability
  and protein levels. The long non-coding RNA FOX2-ASI, upregulated in HCC, targets
  and downregulates DKK1 mRNA (LRP6 inhibitor), thus increasing LRP6 membrane levels.
  (C) In breast cancers (BCs), LRP6 overexpression is observed in 20%–36% of carcinomas,
  and β-catenin nuclear accumulation is reported in 40%–60% of cases. (D) In pancreatic
  ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), (i) mutations of RNF43 are observed in 5%–10% of PDAC
  patients, (ii) down-regulation of miR-454 and (iii) upregulation of LINC01133—a
  long non-coding RNA which induces DKK1 promoter methylation (decreasing DKK1 expression)—all
  explain increased LRP6 expression and subsequent increased β-catenin-dependent signaling.
