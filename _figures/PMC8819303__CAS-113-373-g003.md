caption: Splicing catalysis, the spliceosome assembly pathway, and mechanisms of splice
  site selection. A, Diagram of an intron, 2 flanking exons, U1 and U2 snRNP, associated
  RNA binding proteins, and U2 snRNA, and the sequential reactions involved in removal
  of an intron. The U2 snRNP complex and U2AF complex recognize the BPS and 3′ss,
  respectively, which is an essential step for removing introns from pre‐mRNA. Accessory
  splicing regulatory proteins are also involved in splicing. B, Classification of
  alternative RNA splicing
