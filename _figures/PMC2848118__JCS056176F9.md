caption: Regulation of β-catenin levels in canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  Basal levels of β-catenin are regulated at the mRNA level by Dvl3-KSRP complex that
  promotes de-stabilization of CTNNB1 mRNA, and at the protein level by GSK3β-mediated
  phosphorylation that promotes degradation of β-catenin. Wnt stimulation contributes
  to rapid accumulation of β-catenin by opposing the ability of the Dvl3-KSRP complex
  to promote destabilization of CTNNB1 mRNA and the degradation of β-catenin mediated
  by GSK3β phosphorylation.
