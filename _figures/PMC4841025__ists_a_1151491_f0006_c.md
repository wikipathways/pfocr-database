caption: PPARs signaling pathway analysis in subordinate (SUB) and dominant (DOM)
  mice fed standard diet compared to controls (CON). Representation of PPARs pathway
  in liver and skeletal muscle, based on PCR data from tissues shown in . Sub-pathways
  significantly upregulated in the condition of interest (SUB or DOM) compared to
  CON are represented with all the nodes in red. Sub-pathways significantly downregulated
  are represented with all the nodes in blue. SUB mice showed a downregulation in
  the lipid metabolism sub-pathway in liver and skeletal muscle when compared to CON.
  DOM exhibited a downregulation of lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle while in liver
  the lipid metabolism node is represented with a purple color identifying a node
  belonging to more than one significant sub-pathway having different behaviors (CD36-upregulated
  and Sc1-downregulated). DOM also showed an upregulation of gluconeogenesis in the
  liver. Further details on the representation of the pathway analysis appear in the
  Figure 1 legend. Further details on the representation of the pathway analysis appear
  in Figure S5. This figure will be best described with colors at the online version.
