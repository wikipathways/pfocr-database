caption: ERCC4 may serve as an important regulatory factor for the upregulation of
  PD-L1 expression induced by DNA damage signals and DDR defects. DNA damage and repair
  signals can induce the expression of PD-L1 mRNA, which depends on the activity of
  the ATM-ATR/CHK1 signaling pathway, while DDR defects may be associated with the
  upregulation of PD-L1 induced by DSBs. In the case of immune response, external
  stimuli such as DNA damage can activate the downstream STAT1/3-IRF through the ATM-ATR/CHK1
  signaling pathway, which is crucial for the production of PD-L1 mRNA that can be
  activated at the transcriptional level. p53 may be involved in the process of DNA
  repair after cellular DNA damage through its mediation of ERCC4. Meanwhile, immune
  cells induced by inflammation (including large amounts of ROS from oxidative stress),
  such as CD8+ T cells, can secrete large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
  participate in the regulation pathway of PD-L1 by activating the ATM-ATR/CHK1 signaling
  pathway
