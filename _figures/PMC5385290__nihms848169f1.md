caption: One-carbon metabolism is required for the synthesis of purines, thymidylate
  and methionine. The hydroxymethyl group of serine is a major source of one-carbon
  units, which are generated in the mitochondria in the form of formate via SHMT2,
  or in the cytoplasm through the activity of SHMT1 or SHMT2α. Mitochondrial-derived
  formate can enter the cytoplasm and function as a one-carbon unit for folate metabolism.
  The synthesis of thymidylate occurs in the nucleus and mitochondria. At S phase,
  the enzymes of the thymidylate synthesis pathway undergo SUMO-dependent translocation
  to the nucleus. The remethylation of homocysteine to methionine by MTR requires
  vitamin B12. The one carbon is labeled in “bold”. The “inset” shows the thymidylate
  synthesis cycle which involves the enzymes, SHMT1, SHMT2α, TYMS and DHFR. THF, tetrahydrofolate;
  DHF, dihydrofolate, MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; MTR, methionine
  synthase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase;
