caption: Molecular mechanism of pyroptosis. Caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis requires
  activation of the canonical inflammasomes. In this pathway, pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns activate their respective inflammasome sensors, including NLRP3,
  NLRP1, NLRC4, AIM2, and Pyrin. These inflammasomes recruit ASC adaptors, and the
  NLR or AIM2 signaling domains are connected to the ASC through homotypic interactions
  which generates the formation of ASC focus. The ASC focus recruits procaspase-1,
  leading to the activation of caspase-1. Noncanonical inflammasome direct recognition
  of the cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is derived from gram negative bacteria
  and can directly bind to and active caspase-4/5/11. GSDMD is the direct substrate
  of caspase-1/4/5/11, which can be specifically cleaved by inflammatory caspase and
  plays an important role in the downstream of inflammatory caspase. GSDMD exists
  in an autoinhibitory conformation at homeostasis, in which the inhibitory C terminal
  domain (C-GSDMD) retains the pore-forming N terminal domain (N-GSDMD) in an inactive
  state. Upon processing by the activated caspases, the GSDMD N terminal is released
  and translocated to the inner plasma membrane. Activated caspase-1 also cleave and
  activate the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, which are
  released through GSDMD pores
