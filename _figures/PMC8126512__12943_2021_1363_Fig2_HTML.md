caption: Cytokine signaling in lung cancer and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
  Interleukin (IL)-6 accumulates as a result of nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation
  or stimulation by other cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. The accumulated
  IL-6 plays a key role in a systemic hyperactivated immune response known as the
  cytokine storm. IL-6 serves as a driver of tumor progression, and several cancer-related
  risk factors may in turn boost IL-6 expression, driving the unfavorable cytokine
  storm. Furthermore, cytokine overproduction exacerbates COVID-19, and elevated IL-6
  levels have been observed in patients with severe COVID-19. IL-6-mediated Janus
  kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling is
  initiated by the binding of IL-6 to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and subsequent interaction
  with gp130. The IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 complex, then, activates JAK enzymes, which phosphorylate
  gp130, providing docking sites for STAT3. JAK, then, phosphorylates STAT3 and subsequently
  induces the transcription of multiple target genes. XPO1 inhibitors such as selinexor
  and verdinexor abolish XPO1-mediated IκB export, thus reducing NF-κB pathway and
  decreasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK)
  inhibitors inhibit NF-κB signaling, resulting in reduced IL-6 production. Corticosteroids
  inhibit TNF-α-mediated IL-6 mRNA expression. Other targeted therapeutics for the
  treatment of cancer and COVID-19, such as IL-6R antibodies and JAK inhibitors, are
  shown
