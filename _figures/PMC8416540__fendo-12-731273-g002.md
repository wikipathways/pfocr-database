caption: The mechanisms of DPP4 inhibitors in vascular aging and vascular aging-related
  diseases. DPP4 inhibitors play a beneficial effect in vascular aging not only through
  multiple cellular mechanisms, including improving ECs function, increasing EPCs
  count, mediating the process of monocyte attachment and decreasing VSMCs proliferation,
  but also through complex molecular mechanisms, including AP-I and NF-KB signaling,
  SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis and Akt/AMPK signaling pathway. Thereby preventing vascular aging-related
  diseases, compassing AS, hypertension, heart failure, dyslipidemia, neurodegenerative
  diseases and cerebrovascular diseases, psychological diseases. Arrows indicate stimulatory
  relationships, indicates inhibitory signal. AP-1, activator protein 1; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor kappaB; SDF-1, stromal cell- derived factor-1α; CXCR4, C-X-C chemokine receptor
  type-4; Akt, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; ECs, endothelial cells; VSMCs, vascular smooth muscle cells; EPCs,
  endothelial progenitor cell; AS, atherosclerosis. Arrows indicate stimulatory relationship,
  non-arrows indicate inhibitory signal.
