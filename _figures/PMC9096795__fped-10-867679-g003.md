caption: Schematic showing JAK-STAT pathway and the use of JAK 1/2 inhibitors to block
  inflammatory responses. JAK/STAT pathway plays a key role for the downstream signalling
  of inflammatory cytokines encompassing interleukins and interferons. Upon binding
  of cytokines to their cognate receptors on cell surface, associated JAKs become
  activated and phosphorylate STAT proteins. Following phosphorylation, STATs translocate
  to the nucleus and regulate transcription of ISGs which drive activation of immune
  responses including proinflammatory cytokine production, differentiation, and proliferation
  of innate and adaptive immune cells, and consequently resulting in systemic hyperinflammation.
  IL-1α/β, interleukin-1 alpha and beta; ISGs, interferon-signature genes; JAK, janus
  kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins; TNFα, tumour
  necrosis factor alpha.
