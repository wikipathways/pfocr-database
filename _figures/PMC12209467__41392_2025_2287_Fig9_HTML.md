caption: PI3K, NF-κB and AMPK crosstalk with other signaling pathways in PH. a The
  networks of PI3K and other signaling pathways in PH. In PAECs and PASMCs, IPAH,
  hypoxia, and 5-HT activate ERK, PI3K, JNK, and calcium signaling, promoting proliferation
  and inflammation through the Akt pathway. b The networks of NF-κB and other signaling
  pathways in PH. Hypoxia and FGF2 activate NF-κB p65 signaling in PAECs and PASMCs
  through interactions with key pathways, including HIF-1α, p38, and ERK. These networks
  drive processes such as inflammation, proliferation, angiogenesis, and EndMT. In
  RVF, MCT induces right ventricular failure through NF-κB activation and its interactions
  with MAPK signaling pathways. c The networks of AMPK and other signaling pathways
  in PH. In PAECs and PASMCs, hypoxia and PPHN suppress AMPK signaling, leading to
  the activation of key pathways such as Notch, NF-κB, NLRP3, and Akt, which drive
  angiogenesis, autophagy, inflammation, pyroptosis, and increased cell proliferation.
