caption: Fructose metabolism resembles the Warburg effect. Several pathological conditions
  stimulate aldose reductase, which converts glucose into fructose in the kidney.
  Fructose either from diet or from endogenous system under pathological condition
  is converted by fructokinase into Fructose 1-phosphate, which channels into glycolytic
  pathway. In turn, fructose metabolism results in uric acid production as a by-product,
  which suppress TCA cycle by inhibiting aconitase. ECM, extra cellular matrix.
