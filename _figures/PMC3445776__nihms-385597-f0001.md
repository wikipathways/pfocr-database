caption: The Hedgehog signaling pathway. Positive and negative regulatory components
  are depicted in green and red, respectively. A. In the absence of HH ligand, PTCH1
  inhibits SMO allowing the GLI processing complex containing SUFU to generate GLIr
  transcriptional repressors. B. HH ligand binding to PTCH depresses SMO and generates
  GLIa nuclear factors that induce the expression of Hh target genes. Clinical and
  preclinical inhibitors of pathway signaling are listed at their sites of pathway
  activity.
