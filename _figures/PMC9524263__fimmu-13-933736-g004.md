caption: Regulation of anti-inflammatory effect of MT-exosomes. Melatonin mediates
  the inflammatory response by increasing α-ketoglutarate (α KG) level and transferring
  to macrophages through exosomes in adipose tissue. MT-exosomes from HCC cells reverse
  this effect by down-regulating the expression of PD-1 and altering the secretion
  of macrophage cytokines through inactivating the STAT3 signaling pathway.
