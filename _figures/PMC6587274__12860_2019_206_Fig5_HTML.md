caption: Summary of STAT3-FOXL2 signaling function in HeLa cell growth and apoptosis.
  Phosphorylated-STAT3 enters the cell nucleus from the cytoplasm and binds to the
  confirmed new binding sites, which are located in the promoter region of FOXL2,
  then up-regulates the expression of TNF, and down-regulates the expression of GnRHR
  and TRAIL. Finally, the cancer cell growth inhibition and apoptosis are inhibited
