caption: CMA and neurodegenerative diseases. (A) CMA involves proteins associated
  with PD. The primary pathogenic proteins in PD, α-synuclein and LRRK2, are degraded
  via CMA. Mutations in ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 impair CMA functionality,
  leading to α-synuclein accumulation. Upon ROS activation, neuronal cells exposed
  to mitochondrial toxins show a CMA-driven inclination to degrade PARK7/DJ-1. This
  may exacerbate PD progression if CMA functionality declines. Additionally, the P38-TFEB
  signaling pathway limits CMA-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome degradation, thereby stimulating
  glial cell activity. (B) TDP-43, a key protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
  undergoes degradation through CMA. (C) After phosphorylation by inflammatory kinase
  IKK, Huntington's protein becomes a target for CMA-mediated degradation. (D) In
  an acidic environment, acetylated intraneuronal microtubule-binding protein TAU
  forms a stable complex with HSC70, which facilitates its CMA-mediated degradation.
  Concurrently, calmodulin phosphatase 1 regulator undergoes degradation through the
  CMA lysosomal pathway. The figure was generated using Adobe Illustrator 2021, version
