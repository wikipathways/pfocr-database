caption: '(a) MALAT1 was identified as a sponge of miR-200c. This regulation is not
  restricted to miR-200c and might include the entire miR-200 family (miR-200s), consisting
  of miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429. Upregulation of MALAT1 in
  women with endometriosis leads to enhanced sponging of miR200s and promotes zinc
  finger E-box binding homeobox transcription factor 1 (ZEB1) and ZEB2 expression
  leading to higher EMT. In HESCs, the lncRNA MALAT1 directly interacts with miR-126-5p,
  which regulates cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB1) expression. Upregulation
  of MALAT1 inhibits apoptosis probably via activation of the PI3K–AKT pathway through
  the miR-126-5p–CREB1 axis. MALAT1 lncRNA can also lead to reduced apoptosis in HESCs
  through the upregulation of the NFkB/iNOS signaling pathway activity, which also
  enhances migration and invasion of cells. In cultured primary endometrial stromal
  cells, MALAT1 leads to upregulation of hypoxia-induced autophagy. In this signaling
  cascade, regulation of MALAT1 expression is under the control of the HIF1α transcription
  factor. (b) In granulosa cells (GCs) of women with endometriosis, significant downregulation
  of MALAT1 expression was reported. MALAT1 knockdown induced an increase in phosphorylated
  ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) that was associated with altered follicle count, due to impaired
  cell proliferation resulting from ERK/MAPK-dependent activation of p21/p53 cell
  cycle arrest. In an autograft transplantation rat model of endometriosis, inhibition
  of the lncRNA BANCR led to a decrease in ectopic tissue volume associated with a
  significant reduction in serum levels of VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9, ERK, and MAPK mRNA
  and in phosphorylated ERK and MAPK protein levels in tissues. HESCs: human endometrial
  stromal cells.'
