caption: Key biological pathways associated with hereditary CRC syndromes. Genes with
  known germline mutations are shown in purple font. (A) Fidelity of DNA replication
  depends primarily on DNA polymerases ε and δ for correct base pairing and proofreading
  exonuclease activity. Any persisting base–base mispairs or insertion–deletion loops
  both on the leading and lagging strands are subsequently targeted by MMR proteins.
  MSH2:MSH3/6 dimers recognize the error. Interaction with MLH1:PMS2 triggers downstream
  repair events initiated by removal of the erroneous DNA by exonuclease 1 (Exo1).
  (B) Oxidation, alkylation, and deamination of DNA bases are repaired by base excision
  repair (BER) pathway. Eleven DNA glycosylases recognize and remove the damaged/mispaired
  bases; these are divided into monofunctional (e.g. MUTYH) and bifunctional (e.g.
  NTHL1, OGG1) glycosylases based on the presence of additional endonuclease activity.
  Their function is exemplified by repair of oxidative 8-oxoguanine (oxoG) and 5-hydroxycytosine
  (5-OHC) lesions. (C) Wnt signaling regulates cell development and stemness and is
  commonly hyperactivated in cancer. In the absence of secreted Wnt ligands, a cytoplasmic
  destruction complex directs β-catenin for proteasomal degradation and RNF43/ZNRF3
  ubiquitin ligases downregulate Frizzled receptors. Upon receptor binding of Wnts,
  β-catenin is released and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds TCF/LEF transcription
  factors and displaces the Groucho repressor to activate target gene transcription.
  Binding of R-spondins (Rspo) to LGR5 inhibits RNF43/ZNRF3, enhancing Wnt signaling.
  (D) TGF-β signaling restricts proliferation of colonic epithelial cells. Bone morphogenetic
  proteins (BMPs) are TGF-β superfamily ligands that trigger receptor dimerization
  and activation via trans-phosphorylation, resulting in SMAD-dependent target gene
  transcription. Also, non-SMAD signaling pathways, including the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway,
  can be activated. Growth factor signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) activates
  PI3K to generate phosphoinositide-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), resulting in AKT-mediated
  derepression of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). mTOR integrates nutrient and growth factor
  signals, promoting cell growth upon activation. PTEN lipid phosphatase antagonizes
  this pathway by converting PIP3 back to PIP2. Conversely, low glucose conditions
  trigger the STK11-dependent activation of AMPK, suppressing mTORC1. See references
  () for further details.
