caption: An overview on biosynthesis and enzymes of cytokinin homeostasis (iP, isopentenyladenine;
  DHZ, dihydrozeatin; cZ, cis-zeatin; tZ, trans-zeatin; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate;
  AMP, adenosine monophosphate) cytokinin biosynthetic pathways—mevalonic acid pathway
  (operates in cytosol and mitochondria) and methylerythritol pathway (operates in
  plastids). Enzymes involved are 1) IPT (isopentenyl transferase), which uses ATP,
  ADP, or ATP as acceptor and forms iPRTP (riboside 5′-diphosphate), iPRDP (riboside
  5′-diphosphate), and iPRMP (riboside 5′-monophosphate); 2) CYP735A converts CK nucleotides
  in to tZ nucleotides; 3) AK (adenosine kinase) causes the phosphorylation of ribosides
  iPR, tZR, cZR, and DZR; 4) LOG (LONELY GUY) produces free bases from ribotides;
  5) APRT (adenine phosphoribosyltransferase) catalyzes the conversion of CK bases
  to nucleotides; and 6) CKX (cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase) causes catabolism of
  free bases (iP, tZ, DZ, and cZ) to adenine or adenosine (for references, see ; ;
  ; ; ).
