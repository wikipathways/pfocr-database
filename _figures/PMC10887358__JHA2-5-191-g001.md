caption: Epigenetic changes in miRNAs and their role in CLL prognosis. MiR‐129‐2,
  miR‐34b/c, miR‐3151, and miR‐9‐3 are tumor suppressors and hypermethylation of their
  promoter regions decreases their expression. Low expression of miR‐34b/c inhibits
  the activation of the Tp53 signaling pathway and reduces apoptosis. On the other
  hand, decreased expression of miR‐3151 and miR‐9‐3 initiate the MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT,
  and NF‐κB pathways, leading to reduced apoptosis, increased cell proliferation,
  and unfavorable prognosis of CLL
