caption: Representation of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase signalling complex in the
  heart. Plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) is located in invaginations of the plasma
  membrane (caveolae) and is tethered to the dystrophin complex through syntrophin;
  downstream effectors are regulated by the pump, notably neuronal nitric oxide synthase
  (nNOS), nitric oxide (NO) and the Ras pathway. Rassf1, Ras-associated factor 1.
