caption: 'A number of early/immediate immune modulating events (middle panel) occur
  in the skin following exposure to UV including: (A) isomerization of trans-urocanic
  acid (UCA) to the immune suppressive cis-UCA isoform (; ), (B) production of the
  biologically active lipid mediator, PAF (; ) which contributes to skin cancer development
  () by suppressing both adaptive immunity () and DNA repair (), and (C) recruitment
  of immune modulating mast cells into the dermis peaking at 6h post UV (). These
  early events precipitate a number of later photoimmunological events (bottom panel)
  including: (D) The production of immune modulating IL-33 in keratinocytes and dermal
  fibroblasts (), (E) the migration of epidermal Langerhan’s Cells (), dermal dendritic
  cells (dDC) () and (F) CXCR4+ dermal mast cells to the local draining lymph nodes
  (DLN) () (G) Activation of complement components in the skin (including those associated
  with the alternative pathway; Factor B and Properdin () also contributes to UV-induced
  immune suppression (; ).'
