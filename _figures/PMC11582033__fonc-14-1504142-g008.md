caption: Potential druggable targets and therapeutic strategies for melanoma treatment.
  The schematic diagram illustrates various potential druggable targets and therapeutic
  approaches for the treatment of melanoma. The BRAF/MEK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways
  play crucial roles in melanoma progression and are critical targets for targeted
  therapies. BRAF inhibitors (e.g., vemurafenib, dabrafenib), MEK inhibitors (e.g.,
  trametinib, cobimetinib), and ERK5 inhibitors have shown significant efficacy in
  treating BRAF-mutated melanoma. The PI3K/AKT pathway can also be targeted using
  PI3K and AKT inhibitors to further suppress melanoma growth and survival. Immunotherapy
  has truly revolutionized melanoma treatment by leveraging the immune system’s power.
  Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 (e.g., nivolumab), PD-L1 (e.g., atezolizumab),
  and CTLA-4 (e.g., ipilimumab) inhibitors significantly boost anti-tumor immune responses.
  By inhibiting CD73, the immunosuppressive effects of adenosine can be mitigated,
  leading to enhanced anti-tumor immunity. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy
  (Lifileucel) is a personalized approach involving the isolation, expansion, and
  reinfusion of tumor-specific T cells into melanoma patients. Oncolytic virus therapy
  (OncoVEXmGMCSF) is another innovative strategy that employs genetically modified
  viruses to infect and lyse melanoma cells. These viruses can also stimulate immune
  responses by releasing tumor antigens and promoting the activation of CD4+ and CD8+
  T cells. The combination of targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and novel approaches
  holds excellent potential for improving outcomes in melanoma patients. By targeting
  multiple pathways and harnessing the immune system’s power, these strategies aim
  to overcome resistance, minimize side effects, and provide long-lasting remission
  for individuals battling this aggressive form of skin cancer
