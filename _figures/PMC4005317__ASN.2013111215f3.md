caption: 'Proposed renal protection mechanisms of volatile anesthetics. Volatile anesthetics
  interact with the plasma membrane lipid bilayer in renal tubular cells and induce
  phosphatidylserine externalization and TGF-β1 generation. Volatile anesthetics also
  increase the formation of caveolae/caveolin lipid rafts in the buoyant fractions
  of the renal tubular plasma membranes and facilitate caveolae sequestration of several
  cytoprotective signaling intermediates (e.g., SK-1, TGF-β1 receptors, and S1P).
  TGF-β1 generated by volatile anesthetics binds to the TGF-β1 receptor, leading to
  translocation of SMAD-3 to the nucleus to increase the expression of renal tubular
  CD73. Increased CD73 expression subsequently increases renal tubular adenosine generation.
  Activation of renal tubular and perhaps endothelial ARs increases SK-1 protein expression
  via induction of HIF-1α transcription factor. In addition, activation of A1 ARs
  increases renal tubular IL-11 synthesis via ERK-MAPK activation. Finally, IL-11
  also induces SK-1 generation via the HIF-1α pathway. CD, cluster of differentiation;
  ERK-MAPK: extracellular signal–regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  Gi/o, inhibitory regulative G protein; IL-11R, IL-11 receptor; S1PR, S1P receptor.'
