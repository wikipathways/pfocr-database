caption: (A–C) Following complex neurodevelopmental disease diagnosis in the clinic,
  step one is to apply next-generation sequencing (exome or whole-genome) to identify
  high-impact rare or de novo variants that exist(s) in an individual. Through screening
  of many individuals, recurrent mutations in a gene or locus are identified with
  a general diagnosis of ASD or DD. These candidates are selected for targeted resequencing
  using high-throughput, cost-effective technologies. Molecular inversion probe (MIP)
  technology, for example, applied to thousands of individuals with ASD or DD identifies
  genes with an excess mutational burden in probands when compared to controls. Such
  genes are most likely to contribute to disease etiology and represent future targets
  for therapeutic intervention. Families with these gene mutations are recontacted
  and brought back to the clinic for more comprehensive phenotyping (step two). There
  will be those genes that have a common, strong, single clinical phenotype (A); however,
  these will likely be rare. There may be those individual genotypes that all affect
  the same functional pathway (molecular subtypes) and result in similar or potentially
  opposing phenotypes (e.g., macrocephaly versus microcephaly) (B). Some mutations
  even within the same gene, however, may have multiple associated clinical phenotypes
  (C), suggesting high variability in the type of mutation relative to its gene function
  and/or incomplete penetrance. The latter especially will require more in-depth study
  for genetic background effects (step three). This approach will group patients foremost
  based on genotypes or sets of mutated genes. Larger groups of patients with the
  same presumptive genetic etiology are re-examined to identify specific clinical
  phenotypes, with the goal of improving diagnosis, patient care, and management.
