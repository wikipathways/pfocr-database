caption: 'A hypothetical scheme for the excitatory system, the inhibitory system,
  and the feedback mechanism of OXT-ergic neurons in the hypothalamus in the rat chronic
  inflammation model. (Left) Basal transmission: OTR is present in both excitatory
  pre- and postsynaptic neurons in OXT-ergic neurons. (Right) Chronic inflammation
  pain: Chronic inflammation pain enhances synaptic excitatory and inhibitory transmissions.
  Activated OXT works as negative feedback excitatory system around itself via the
  OTR. The signaling pathway of the negative feedback system contributes to the nNOS
  to promote NO production. NO and GABA act as retrograde neurotransmitters causing
  negative feedback at the pre-or postsynaptic OXT-ergic neurons. GABA: γ-aminobutyric
  acid ; AMPAR: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor ; KAR:
  Kainate type glutamate receptor ; NMDAR: N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor ; OXT:
  oxytocin; OTR: OXT receptor; nNOS: neuronal nitric oxide synthase; NO: nitric oxide.'
