caption: 'KEGG pathways regulated by GPR1 or SNF3 and RGT2. Regions of interest in
  the KEGG pathway are shown with genes displayed as rectangles and metabolites displayed
  as circles. KEGG compound name for each metabolite is labeled beside the circle.
  Standard gene names are labeled inside the rectangle. For enzyme complexes, the
  gene name for the major component is shown followed with an ellipsis. The directions
  of irreversible enzymatic reactions are shown by the arrows. Reversible reactions
  are connected by straight lines. DEGs and SPMs are highlighted in red (gpr1Δ) and
  blue (snf3Δ rgt2Δ). Shared DEGs and SPMs are colored half red and half blue. (a)
  as compared with snf3Δ rgt2Δ, gpr1Δ affected more components in citrate cycle (TCA
  cycle, functional category: carbohydrate); (b) as compared with gpr1Δ, snf3Δ rgt2Δ
  affected more components in alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism (showing
  aspartate and glutamate specifically, functional category: amino acid).'
