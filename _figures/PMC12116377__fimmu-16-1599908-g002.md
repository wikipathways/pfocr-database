caption: A summary diagram illustrating PD-L1-related immune sensitivity and resistance
  mechanisms in GC. (A) The mechanisms of sensitivity to immunotherapy. A favorable
  response to neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy is associated
  with increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells and CD8+ CD44+ CD62L- effector T cells,
  as well as an elevated M1/M2 macrophage ratio. Autophagy regulates PD-L1 expression
  in cancer cells. Autophagy inhibition leads to upregulation of p62/SQSTM1, which
  translocates into the nucleus and then activates NF-κB signaling pathway, ultimately upregulating
  PD-L1 expression. Autophagy activation attenuates PD-L1 expression via histone deacetylase
  (HDAC) downregulation, with subsequent complex mechanism such as epigenetic remodeling.
  (B) The mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy. Low pre-treatment levels of CD8+
  PD-1+ T-cell infiltration and high levels of Treg cell infiltration may contribute
  to immunotherapy failure. Patients exhibiting hyper-progressive disease (HPD) following
  immunotherapy demonstrate increased Treg cell infiltration and expansion of immunosuppressive
  CD4+ T-cell subsets within tumor tissues
