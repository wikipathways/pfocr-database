caption: Schematic diagram showing how hyperglycaemia leads to oxidative stress, adapted
  from []. Hyperglycaemia is shown to be the prominent cause of oxidative stress in
  women with GDM. This occurs due to an increase in superoxide anion production in
  the mitochondria, caused increased pyruvate, and NADH formation, which activates
  various pathways. These include the polyol pathway, hexosamine pathway, activation
  of protein kinase C, and the activation of advanced glycation end products (AGE).
  All these pathways lead to an elevation in ROS.
