caption: Illustration describing inflammation and apoptosis mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2
  infection, suggesting similarity with those in Parkinson’s disease under oxidative
  stress. The SARS-CoV-2 entry in the cell requires interaction with the surface molecules
  angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2),
  leading to activation of NFκB via pattern recognition receptors (PRR), which is
  further amplified by STAT-1, STAT-3 and oxidative stress, similar to 6OHDA-induced
  toxicity in treated dDCNs showing increased p65-NFκB expression. This NFκB stimulation
  induces caspase-2 and -8 expression in 6OHDA-treated dDCNs, which are the upregulated
  caspases from prolonged STAT-1 activation, NFκB and membrane-associated ORF3a viral
  protein in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, leading to apoptotic cell death through the
  extrinsic pathway, thus promoting the development of PD and COVID-19. (BioRender
  software was used to create this figure).
