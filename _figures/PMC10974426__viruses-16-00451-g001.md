caption: Virus-activated intracellular signaling pathways. The recognition of viral
  nucleic acids by cellular sensors, also known as PRRs, includes endosomal TLRs and
  RLRs triggering downstream signaling cascades to activate transcription factors
  such as IRF3 and NF-κB. These transcription factors mediate the induction of type-I
  IFN. Type-I IFN includes IFNα/β, which bind to IFN receptors (IFNARs) to activate
  the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. In this signaling pathway, the canonical signal
  transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-1 and 2 dimerize with IRF9 and
  form a signaling complex. This binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs)
  to induce ISGs that elicit an antiviral state in the cell. Recently, two non-transcriptional
  functions of IRF3, namely RIPA and RIKA, have been uncovered. RIPA (RIG-I-like receptor-induced
  IRF3-mediated pathway of apoptosis) involves linear polyubiquitination of IRF3 upon
  viral infection, resulting in the activation of downstream caspases that apoptotically
  kill virus-infected cells. On the other hand, RIKA (repression of IRF3-mediated
  NF-κB activity) is involved in the downregulation of viral inflammation
