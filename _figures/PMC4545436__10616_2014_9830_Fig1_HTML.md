caption: Signaling pathways involved in CSCs. CSC function relies on various signaling
  pathways like Notch, Wnt and Hh signaling pathways. A Wnt pathway is initiated by
  binding of Wnt to its frizzled receptor. Mutations in APC gene is common in many
  CSCs leading to over activation of β-catenin promoting carcinogenesis. B Over activity
  of NICD, a component of the Notch pathway, leads to gene overexpression promoting
  carcinogenesis. C In the Hh pathway, mutation in PTCH1 gene leads to SMO over activity
  and promotes uncontrolled growth and carcinogenesis
