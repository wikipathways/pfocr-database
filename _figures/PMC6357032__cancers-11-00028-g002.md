caption: '(A) Classification of caspases. Caspases are divided into three subtypes:
  inflammatory caspases (1,4,5,11,12,13,14), initiator caspases in intrinsic and extrinsic
  apoptotic pathways with long N terminal (2,8,9,10), and effector caspases known
  for their short/absent N-terminal (3,6,7) [,]. (B) Classification of apoptotic proteins
  according to their function in apoptosis. Pro-apoptotic proteins are classified
  into Caspases and BCL-2 families. Caspases are further subdivided according to their
  role in apoptotic pathway. Bcl-2 proteins are classified as multidomain proteins
  (Bax and Bak) and BH3 only domain that either serve in intermediate pathway (Bid
  and inhibitors of apoptotic inhibitors such as SMAC/Diablo, HRTA/Omi, Noxa, Puma,
  Arts and Bim). Anti-apoptotic proteins are classified as BCL-2 multi-domain proteins
  (Bcl-xl, Bcl-b, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, Bf1 and DIVA/Boo) and BIR domain family (survivin,
  livin, bruce, c-IAP and x-IAP).'
