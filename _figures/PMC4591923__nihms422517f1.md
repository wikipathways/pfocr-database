caption: 'The signaling pathways of VEGF and HER family members and the current drugs
  that target these proteins in cancer are shown. HER-2 can heterodimerize with any
  of the ligand-activated HER receptors (HER-1, HER-3 or HER-4) and this association
  leads to intracellular signaling via two major pathways, the MAPK pathway and the
  PI3K pathway, leading to proliferation, cell survival, metastasis and angiogenesis.
  On the other hand, VEGF can bind to its main receptor, VEGFR-2 (KDR), and this binding
  causes intracellular phosphorylation of the receptor, thereby stimulating the PI3K
  pathway and stimulating angiogenesis. The signaling pathways can be targeted extracellularly
  using humanized monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab (HER-2),
  cetuximab (EGF receptor), as well as bevacizumab or VEGF Trap (VEGF), which can
  prevent ligand binding and activation of the receptors or can directly block binding
  of an activated receptor to another. At the intracellular level, small-molecule
  inhibitors, such as sunitinib (VEGF), lapatinib (HER-1 and HER-2) and erlotinib
  (HER-2), can disrupt the phosphorylation sites and directly prevent activation of
  the PI3K or MAPK pathways.P: Phosphate; VEGFR: VEGF receptor.'
