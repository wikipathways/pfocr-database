caption: Chemokines can potentially be released from damaged muscle fibres, other
  resident cell types within the muscle, infiltrating leucocytes or myoblasts themselves.
  After binding to their receptors (CCR1, CCR2, CCR5) on myoblasts, the chemokines
  induce phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAPK through a Gαi and MEK-dependent signalling
  pathway. This leads to myoblast proliferation and most probably enhanced migration,
  which is later followed by differentiation and eventual reconstitution of the mature
  muscle fibre.
