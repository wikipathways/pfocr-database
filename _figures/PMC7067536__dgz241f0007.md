caption: '. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) (Qiagen Bioinformatics, Ca, USA) detected
  modification in expression of genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, activation,
  and transport in thyrocytes.(7A): An example of response induced by hepatitis C
  virus (HCV) infection in human thyrocytes in primary culture. HCV infection induces
  downregulation of several molecules involved in thyroid hormone synthesis such as
  thyroid peroxidase (TPO), thyroglobulin (TG) and forkhead boxE1 (FOXE1). HCV infection
  in human thyrocytes induces downregulation of several genes involved in synthesis
  and transport of thyroid hormones: thyroid peroxidase (TPO), thyroglobulin (TG).
  (7B): An example of network of genes differentially modified by HCV infection in
  hepatocytes cell line Huh7.5.HCV infection of hepatocyte cell line Huh7.5 induces
  activation of several proinflammatory cytokines such as CXCL8, CXCL-6 and other
  markers involved in hepatic fibrosis such as TGF beta (tissue growth factor beta),
  which is involved in organ fibrosis.'
