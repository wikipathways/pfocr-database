caption: 'The potential role of WWOX in anticancer drug-induced cancer cell apoptosis.
  Right (red area): In susceptible cells, anticancer drugs upregulate WWOX expression
  and suppress autophagy, thereby sensitizing cancer cells to apoptosis. mTOR signaling
  is generally considered to promote cell growth. mTOR activity is transiently upregulated
  in anticancer drug-treated SCC cells. Whether the failure to sustain mTOR activation
  renders cells vulnerable to death remains to be determined. WWOX also interacts
  with ΔNp63α and AP2γ and sequesters them in the cytoplasm for increasing apoptosis.
  Left (green area): Basal autophagy is active in chemoresistant cancer cells, as
  evidenced by the presence of numerous autophagosomes in the cytoplasm. Following
  anticancer drug treatment, the expression levels of Beclin-1 and Atg12-Atg5 are
  upregulated and autophagy remains robust in these cells. The drug-resistant cells
  may utilize the autophagic pathway as a survival mechanism to evade the perturbations
  of cellular biosynthetic processes by antimetabolites and sustain cell viability
  upon metabolic stress. Failure to induce WWOX expression in cancer cells may lead
  to chemoresistance'
