caption: Specific and non-specific mechanisms of oligodendrocyte injury. (A) T cell-mediated
  cytotoxicity. This type of injury involves cell surface receptors, direct cell-cell
  interactions, and T cell-derived cytokines and molecules; (B) Antibody-mediated
  cytotoxicity. Self-reactive antibody causes activation of complement on the cell
  surface (C5-9 membrane complex) of oligodendrocytes, which in turn leads to pore
  formation and cell damage; (C) Macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity. Macrophages recruited
  to the inflammatory lesion release a number of diffusable molecules that can cause
  cell membrane damage and/or trigger injurious cell signaling; (D) Oxidative and
  endoplasmic reticulum stress. Intracellular metabolic perturbations lead to stress
  reactions and caspase activation in the abscence of a direct immune assault. ER
  is endoplasmic reticulum; GlutR is glutamate receptor; Mϕ is Macrophage; Oli is
  Oligodendrocyte; Sm/cer is sphingomyelinase/ceramide pathway.
