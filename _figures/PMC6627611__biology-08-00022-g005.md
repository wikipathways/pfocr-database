caption: Components of the ferroptotic pathway evaluated in the present study. In
  this study, the effect of warm anoxia-reoxygenation on the main initially discovered
  elements of the ferroptotic pathway was evaluated in RPTECs derived from mouse or
  the native hibernator Syrian hamster. The cystine-glutamine antiporter (xCT) facilitates
  the transport of cystine into the cells, which is required for the synthesis of
  glutathione (GSH). Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is the only GPX isoenzyme capable
  of reducing cell membrane polyunsaturated phospholipid hydroperoxides, and in this
  reaction, it oxidizes GSH. Labile bivalent iron (Fe2+) is necessary for cell membrane
  lipid peroxidation, while ferritin stores the labile bivalent iron in its nontoxic
  trivalent form (Fe3+) preventing lipid peroxidation. Our study showed that the lack
  of lipid peroxidation, assessed by the cellular malondialdehyde (MDA), in hamster
  RPTECs subjected to warm anoxia-reoxygenation might result from the increased xCT
  and ferritin expression.
