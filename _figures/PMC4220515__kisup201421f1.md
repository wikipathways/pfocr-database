caption: Excess glucose and fatty-acid exposure linked to reduction of AMPK and consequent
  inflammation and fibrosis. Increased caloric exposure may lead to a reduction in
  AMP/ATP ratio and reduced 5′-AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity. Reduced
  AMPK has been linked to increased activity of NFkB and nuclear translocation of
  USF1. NFkB can stimulate the NAPDH oxidase system, whereas USF1 mediates transforming
  growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) gene transcription under high-glucose conditions.
  Stimulation of AMPK via adiponectin/LKB1 or various agonists (aminoimidazole-4-carbox-amide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside
  (AICAR)) or modulators of AMPK (metformin, weight loss, exercise) can block NFkB
  activation and USF1 nuclear translocation. In addition, the role of the AMPK-PGC-1α-mitochondrial
  biogenesis pathway is likely further regulating inflammation and fibrosis via unclear
  pathways.
