caption: 'Summary of Nrf2/ARE-related pathways. Under homeostasis condition, Nrf2
  and NF-κB would bind to the inhibitors and further be degraded. Oxidative stress
  induces modification of Keap1 and phosphorylation of IκB, resulting in the dissociation
  of Nrf2 from Keap1 and NF-κB from IκB. The active Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus,
  binds to ARE, and initiates antioxidants transcription. p38 MAPK would enhance the
  combination of Nrf2 and Keap1, thus reducing the active Nrf2. BDNF can enhance the
  accumulation and transactivation of Nrf2 via PKC pathway. GSK-3β would enhance Nrf2
  nuclear export and degradation, which would be inhibited by PI3K/Akt pathway. Furthermore,
  Nrf2 can promote mitochondria biogenesis. BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor;
