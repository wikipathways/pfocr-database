caption: Synthesis of MET-H-AuNPs and targeted antitumor pathway. H-AuNPs are synthesized
  with the mixture of HAuCl4, HA, and eggplant extract irradiated under natural sunlight.
  After being modified by EDC/NHS reaction, H-AuNPs connect MET with the amide bond
  formed by stirring overnight between carboxyl groups of HA and amine group of MET
  to generate MET-H-AuNPs. MET-H-AuNPs are taken up into HepG2 cells through HA receptor–mediated
  endocytosis and release MET in a pH-dependent way which could induce cell cycle
  arrest significantly at the G2/M phase and apoptosis.
