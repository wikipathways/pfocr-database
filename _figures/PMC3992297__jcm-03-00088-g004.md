caption: 'The growth hormone (GH)—insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1) pathway and
  its signaling cascade, which involves PI(3)K and Akt, can modulate longevity and
  cancer in model systems. Calorific restriction inhibits GH-IGF1 signaling and can
  also inhibit mTOR and activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin 1
  (SIRT1). Interactions between components of these pathways, and with SIRT1, remain
  incompletely understood. The role of SIRT1 in modulating mammalian ageing has not
  been demonstrated, and it seems to have a dual role in cancer. DNA repair systems
  and DNA damage checkpoints prevent the DNA damage accumulation that contributes
  to cancer and ageing, although possibly through different cellular mechanisms. Reprinted
