caption: TGF-β decreases intracellular GSH by suppressing the expression of glutamate
  cysteine ligase (GCL), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo GSH synthesis. On the
  other hand, GSH suppresses TGF-β-induced fibrogenic effects by reducing intracellular
  ROS levels and by preventing oxidative modifications/inactivation of MAPK phosphatases
  and thus MAPK activation. GSH may also block TGF-β-induced Smad pathway activity
  indirectly by inhibiting MAPK pathways.
