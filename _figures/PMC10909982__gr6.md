caption: The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway induces PTC proliferation. The associated
  protein initially binds to its cell surface receptor(receptor tyrosine kinases,
  RTK). RTK activates protein kinases like PI3K, a crucial signaling molecule in cellular
  growth, proliferation, and migration. Once activated by PI3K, Akt produces phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate
  (PIP3), a serine/threonine kinase found in cells. Akt is essential in regulating
  cellular processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, and proliferation through
  phosphorylation of downstream target proteins(p53/BAD/mTOR/NF-κB), finally promoting
  PTC proliferation via inhibiting apoptosis and increasing growth
