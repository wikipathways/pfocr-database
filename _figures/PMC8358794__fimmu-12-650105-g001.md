caption: Crosstalk between tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and CD8-positive (CD8+)
  T cells. Most TAMs function as tumor suppressive agents. TAMs create an immunosuppressive
  microenvironment through a sophisticated network. The classical pathway to inhibit
  CD8+ T cell function is through immune checkpoint recognition. TAMs present immune
  inhibition signals, such as programed cell death protein (PD-1) pathway or cytotoxic
  T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) pathways, which hamper CD8+ activation.
  TAMs also recruit other immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells (Treg),
  by secreting IL-10 and TGFβ to negatively regulate CD8+ T cells. Studies suggest
  that the metabolism of CD8+ T cells can be affected by TAMs. Specifically, TAMs
  can lead T cell starvation though arginine metabolism. After activation of CD8+
  T cells, TAMs can help influence the migration and infiltration of CD8+ T cells
  through extracellular matrix stiffness and collagen deposition to have an effect
  on cytotoxicity.
