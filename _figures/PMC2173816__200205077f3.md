caption: Down-regulation of the inflammatory response. YopP binds and blocks the IkB
  kinase β (IKKβ), which inhibits the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB, the
  inhibitor of NF-kB. This in turn prevents the migration of the transcription factor
  NF-κB to the nucleus. The absence of NF-κB in the nucleus prevents transcription
  of antiapoptotic genes and several proinflammatory genes including the TNF-α gene.
  YopP also blocks the MKKs, inhibiting the activation of MAPK, which abrogates activation
  of CREB, another transcription factor involved in the immune response. YopP induces
  apoptosis in macrophages, either directly by acting upstream of Bid or indirectly
  by blocking the synthesis of NF-κB–dependent antiapoptotic factors. Yop H inhibits
  the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) by dephosphorylating
  key players in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway.
