caption: Potential role of hypothalamic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in obesity
  and inflammation. Under certain stimuli, such as high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, drug
  treatment, or infection, ER stress is activated, and binding immunoglobulin protein
  (BiP) dissociates from protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring
  enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), resulting in the
  release of those three proteins. PERK is then activated by phosphorylation and p-PERK
  phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and increases the translation
  of ATF4. ATF6 relocates to the Golgi apparatus and is processed by site 1 and 2
  proteases, resulting in ATF6 activation. IRE1 is activated by phosphorylation. pIRE1
  catalyzes X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA splicing, resulting in increased production
  of active spliced XBP1. These effects could (1) activate the hypothalamic autophagy
  signaling, impede proopiomelanocortin (POMC) processing, attenuate leptin signaling,
  and possibly increase neuropeptide Y (NPY), and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) expression,
  leading to increased food intake, decreased energy expenditure, inflammation, and
  weight gain; (2) decrease white adipose tissue (WAT) browning and brown adipose
  tissue (BAT) thermogenesis by affecting sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity,
  resulting in lower energy expenditure and weight gain; and (3) trigger activation
  of the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKKβ)/nuclear factor
  κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, resulting in hypothalamic leptin and insulin resistance
  (by affecting suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 [SOCS3] and protein tyrosine phosphatase
  1B [PTP1B]). These effects could increase food intake, decrease energy expenditure,
  and promote inflammation, thus resulting in weight gain. Furthermore, activated
  IKKβ/NF-κB signaling could lead to ER stress in the hypothalamus and worsen hypothalamic
  inflammation.
