caption: The schematic illustrates that inhibition of GLUT1 results in an increase
  in the tumor OXPHOS pathway, leading to excessive production of ROS, which subsequently
  promotes TNFα-mediated cell death. Additionally, the inhibition of MCT4 alleviates
  the acidic TME and enhances T cell infiltration and immune attack by increasing
  the expression of CXCL9/CXCL10 through the ROS/NF-κB signaling pathway
