caption: Schematic representation shows the function of angiogenic molecules during
  cerebral ischemia. Injured neurons and activated astrocytes and endothelial cells
  express growth factors such as VEGF, PDGF, MMPs and etc., which degrade basement
  membrane, activate endothelial cells and induce sprout. Bone marrow cells (BMCs)
  and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are homing towards the sprout regions via
  chemokines CXCL12/SDF-1 and netrin-1, leading to tube formation. Lower left inset
  indicates that VEGF signals through VEGF-R1 or VEGF-R2, CXCL12/SDF-1 through CXCR4
  or CXCR7, and Netrin-1 through DCC or UNC5H2 receptors, all of which further activate
  ERK signaling pathway and induce downstream cascade activation.
