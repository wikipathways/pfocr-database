caption: 'The role of five signalling pathways in regulating the immune microenvironment
  of DW. (1) PI3 K/AKT/mTOR pathway: Upregulated cytokines, such as HIF-1α and VEGF,
  induce the transcription and protein expression levels of target genes through the
  PI3 K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation, migration,
  and angiogenesis to accelerate wound healing [56–58]. (2) JAK-STAT pathway: JAK/STAT
  pathway signalling leads to the upregulation of various proteins to regulate inflammatory
  response, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and migration, and ECM synthesis [62,
  63]. (3) TGF-β/SMAD pathway: TGF-β regulates cell proliferation, differentiation,
  migration, apoptosis, and ECM synthesis by targeting genes through SMAD transcription
  factors [66–68]. (4) Wnt/β-catenin pathway: When the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is switched
  on and activated, the level of β-catenin in the cytoplasm increases and is translocated
  to the nucleus. It plays a key role in regulating cell proliferation, migration
  and fibroblastogenesis [73]. (5) VEGF pathway: The VEGF pathway is a key pathway
  in angiogenesis, signalling through VEGFR to activate multiple downstream pathways
  that regulate endothelial cell proliferation, survival, migration, and vascular
  permeability [71, 72]'
