caption: Crosstalk between key signal pathways during prostatic budding. AR signaling
  pathway activates canonical WNT signaling, which in turn activates the master regulator
  NKX3-1 to that drives prostatic budding from UGE. In addition, WNT signaling can
  directly promote AR signal or indirectly inhibit AR signal by activating BMP signal
  which inhibits AR and prostate ductal budding. AR/WNT/BMP work together to ensure
  an appropriate number of ductal tips for normal prostate development
