caption: Various functions of FER in controlling the ligand‐induced immune response.
  The bacterial flagellin (flg22) and elongation factor Tu (elf18) trigger the formation
  of FLS2‐BAK1 and EFR‐BAK1 immune complex, further activating downstream immune responses,
  such as Ca2+ oscillations, NADPH oxidase‐induced oxidative burst, and mitogen‐activated
  protein kinase cascades. FER destabilizes the FLS2–BAK1 and EFR–BAK1 immune complex
  by interacting with RALF23‐LLGs, thereby modulating the plant immune response. FER
  also interacts with RIPK and phosphorylates it, thus regulating the activity of
  AHA2 and affecting the pH. F‐RALF and M‐RALFs peptides secreted by Fusarium oxysporium
  or nematodes can also bind FER and hijack the FER‐RALF pathway. In Valsa canker
  resistance, FER interacts with a hypersensitive reaction (HR)‐induced protein HIR1
  and disrupts HIR self‐interaction. The FER–HIR complex compromises resistance by
  altering the salicylic acid (SA) level, suppressing polyphenol accumulation and
  blocking the HIR1‐mediated HR. ET, ethylene; JA, jasmonic acid; PCD, programmed
  cell death; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SA, salicylic acid; TF, transcription
  factor.
