caption: BA metabolism in the brain and its association with cognitive dysfunction-related
  diseases. In the brain, cholesterol is oxidized to 24-OH via CYP46A1. The 24-OH
  can easily exit the brain through the ABCA1. This is the main way of cholesterol
  clearance in the brain. ① In AD, the BBB is broken due to the hydrophobic environment
  created by an increase in blood lipids (hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia),
  which allows toxins produced by the gut flora to penetrate the brain. Secondary
  BAs damage neurons that produce CYP46A1, simultaneously activating FXR and reducing
  the expression of CYP46A1. As a result, the cholesterol clearance pathway in the
  brain is disrupted, and the high-cholesterol environment in the brain positively
  regulates β- and γ-secretase expression, increasing the amyloid protein production
  pathway, leading to the deposition of Aβ in the brain. ② In addition, neuroinflammation
  caused by activation of microglia in HE is thought to be closely associated with
  the development of cognitive dysfunction. Specific conjugated BAs in the brain induce
  microglial activation and secrete proinflammatory factors by activating S1P2R. This
  process is not directly acted on microglia but through signal transduction communication
  between neurons and microglia, which is mediated by CCL2.
