caption: The canonical miRNA pathway initiates with the recognition and cleavage of
  pri-miRNA transcripts by the Pasha/Drosha complex to yield pre-miRNA hairpins. Our
  data support the existence of an alternate pathway in which short introns with hairpin
  potential are spliced and debranched to yield mirtron hairpins. Both pre-miRNA and
  mirtron hairpins are exported from the nucleus by Exportin-5 and cleaved by Dicer-1/loqs
  to generate ∼22 nt RNA duplexes. One strand, the active miRNA, is transferred to
  an Ago complex and guides it to repress fully complementary or seed-matched target
  transcripts.
