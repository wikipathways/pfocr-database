caption: 'Schematic overview of noble gas-induced neuroprotection. (a) Xenon’s neuroprotective
  effect is mediated by the inhibition of NMDA receptors. In addition, Xenon can activate
  potassium channels (TREK-1) and functions as a potassium channel opener leading
  to increased KATP currents. Targeting Bax, Bcl-2 and HIF-1α, Xenon also provides
  anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects. (b) TLR2 and 4 are responsible for
  argon-mediated neuroprotective effects. The downstream signaling pathways PI3K/Akt
  and ERK1/2 impact transcription factors promoting cell survival and reducing pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and apoptosis signaling. (c): Helium promotes neuroprotection mainly via
  nitric oxide (NO) and increases the expression of antioxidases such as SOD-1 and
  HO-1.'
