caption: 'IFN-dependent and -independent pathways leading to induction of viperin
  upon viral infection. (a) Upon viral infection, sensing of viral nucleic acids by
  PRRs leads to the activation of downstream signaling factors that result in the
  induction of IFNs and, in some cases, viperin. The induction of IFN-β can occur
  to one of several mechanisms, including those dependent on endosomal TLRs and mitochondrial
  MAVS, that culminate in the activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7
  that bind to the IFNB promoter and induce its expression. The direct induction of
  viperin can occur through peroxisomal MAVS and downstream activation of IRF1 or
  by IRF3. Viperin itself can increase IFNB induction by promoting TRAF6-dependent
  ubiquitination of IRAK1 and phosphorylation of IRF7. IFN-β is secreted and signals
  both in autocrine and paracrine manners upon binding to its receptor. Downstream
  activation of the Jak-STAT pathway results in the formation of the heterotrimeric
  complex ISGF3, which translocates to the nucleus and binds to the promoter of ISGs,
  including that of viperin, and other IFNs. The transcription factor PRDI-BF1 can
  act as a negative regulator by competing with ISGF3 for promoter binding. Additionally,
  IFN-γ secreted primarily by immune cells can activate IRF1 and directly induce viperin
  expression. (b) In binding of transcription factors to the VIPERIN promoter, the
  promoter contains two adjacent ISRE sites immediately upstream of the TSS for ISGF3
  complex binding. The transcription factor IRF3 can directly bind to the ISREs and
  also to an upstream sequence. Activation of IRF1 by either IFN-γ signaling or peroxisomal
  MAVS can bind to two IRF-binding elements, IRF-E #2 and #3. A further upstream IRF-E
  sequence exists but does not appear to be involved in IRF1 binding. Abbreviations:
