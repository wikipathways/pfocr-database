caption: A. Regulation of vascular permeability by S1P/S1P1 signaling involves ligation
  of S1P to the S1P1 receptor to stimulate Rac1 activation via the Gi-dependent recruitment
  of PI3 kinase and Tiam1 to a common site. Activation of of Rac1 induces a series
  of profound events including adherens junction and tight junction assembly, cytoskeletal
  reorganization, and formation of focal adhesions that combine to enhance vascular
  barrier function. Other S1P dependent mechanisms such an increase in intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration via a Gi–PLC pathway and transactivation of S1P1 signaling by
  other barrier-enhancing agents are beyond the scope of this review. B. The schematic
  shows endothelial barrier regulation by cAMP dependent mechanisms. Intracellular
  cAMP is increased after ligation of β2-adrenergic receptors to activate adenylyl
  cyclases (AC), via stimulatory G proteins (Gs), or by forskolin to activate AC,
  and rolipram to inhibit phosphodiesterase 4. Activating cAMP increases Rac1 activity
  mainly via exchange factor directly activated by cAMP (epac)-mediated modulation
  of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF). cAMP via Rap1 and Rac1 modulates endothelial
  barrier properties as the result of increased adhesion of intercellular junction
  molecules, tethering of junctional complexes to the actin cytoskeleton, or strengthening
  of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. TJ, tight junction; AJ, adherens junction; S1P1,
