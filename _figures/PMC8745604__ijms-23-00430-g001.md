caption: 'Representation of the Hippo signaling pathway in humans. When the Hippo
  pathway is active (A), multiple signals stimulate the upstream components, which
  are NF2 and Mel. Subsequently, MST 1/2 protein and its substrate, LATS 1/2, are
  activated through phosphorylation processes and phosphorylate YAP/TAZ, which interacts
  with the 14-3-3 protein. Phosphorylation causes their cytoplasmic retention and
  generates ubiquitination processes mediated by proteasome degradation. When the
  Hippo pathway (B) is inactive, YAP/TAZ that are not phosphorylated translocate into
  the nucleus and form a transcription factor complex by binding to TEAD. This pathway
  regulates the transcription of genes involved in abnormal multiplication, chemoresistance
  and metastasis. YAP: Yes-associated protein; TAZ: Transcriptional coactivator with
  PDZ-binding motif; NF2: Neurofibrominin 2; MST: Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase;
  LATS: large tumor suppressor kinase; SAV1: Protein salvador homolog 1; MOB1: Mps1-binder-related;
  TEAD: Transcriptional enhanced associate domain.'
