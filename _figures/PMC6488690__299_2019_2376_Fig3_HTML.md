caption: Schematic illustration of the impact of climate change on cold acclimation.
  Cold acclimation is caused by a complex interaction between a decreasing photoperiod
  and decreases in temperature. Climate change can delay the time of cold acclimation,
  and cold acclimation will be affected by erratic temperature events. Global warming
  can directly reduce the effectiveness of cold acclimation by disrupting the combined
  effects of photoperiod and temperature. Elevated CO2 concentration affects plant
  cold acclimation and freezing tolerance by nucleating ice in cells, increasing leaf
  temperatures, delaying the timing of cold acclimation, and changing xylem sap pH.
  The increase in leaf temperatures may affect membrane fluidity and the activity
  of calcium channels, and, thus, subsequent cellular signaling. Changes in xylem
  sap pH may affect the chemical characters of several COR-gene products and ABA signaling.
  Elevated CO2 concentration can affect both the timing and rate of cold acclimation
  in combination with warmer temperatures, shorter photoperiod, and lower irradiance.
