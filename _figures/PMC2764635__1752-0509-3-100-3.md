caption: 'Schematic of new model of EGF activated ERK pathway: This is a schematic
  of our new model of the EGF activated ERK pathway which was developed from the original
  [] EGF model. The new model considers receptor production and degradation as well
  as the Ras and Rap1 pathways leading to the activation of ERK. We used this model
  to investigate the effects of a number of cancerous alterations such as a Ras mutation,
  B-Raf mutation, EGFR mutation, and EGFR overexpression; all these cancerous alterations
  are highlighted in red.'
