caption: 'Anti-inflammation mechanisms of molecular hydrogen during sepsis. (a) Molecular
  hydrogen suppresses the NF-κB pathway to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting
  IκB-a phosphorylation or suppressing ERK activation mediated by upstream and ASK1.
  (b) Molecular hydrogen reduces neutrophil aggregation by inhibiting activation of
  ROS-ASK1-MAPK. (c) Molecular hydrogen attenuates the inflammatory response by activating
  the Nrf2-mediated HO-1 signaling pathway. ASK1: apoptotic signal-regulated kinase
  1; ROS: reactive oxygen species; ERK extracellular regulated kinase; MAPK: mitogen
  activated protein kinase.'
