caption: Leydig cell (LC) steroidogenesis and ED2 testicular macrophage (TM) showing
  cytokines synthesis, and LC-TM paracrine interaction under normal condition. 1-)
  LH activates cAMP‐dependent protein kinase A, which mobilizes and transports cholesterol
  (C), derived from the blood stream. C is converted into 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC)
  by 25-hydroxylase (25-HX). StAR transports 25-HC to mitochondria where is metabolized
  into pregnenolone (P) by CYP11A1 enzyme. In smooth endoplasmic reticulum, P is metabolized
  into progesterone (PR) by 3β-HSD, and into androstenedione (A) by CYP17. Finally,
  A is converted into testosterone (T) by 17β-HSD, and T is released to the extracellular
  milieu. 2-) Via autocrine, T binds to androgen receptor (AR) in LC and is translocated
  to the nucleus, activating AR responsive genes, such as MIF, which is secreted and
  released by LC. 3-) LC expresses IL-1 receptor (IL-1R); IL-1β/IL-1R binding stimulates
  IL-1β secretion via autocrine signaling. 4-) IL-1α/β bound to IL-1R also stimulates
  StAR expression through ERK1/2 pathway, triggering the activation of StAR binding
  to 25-HC and subsequent steroidogenesis. 5-) The LC-produced MIF stimulates the
  recruitment of new monocytes/macrophages or is internalized by TM via CD74 receptor,
  stimulating NLRP3 complex and subsequent capase-1 (CASP-1), which converts Pro-IL-1β
  into active IL-1β. 6-) IL-1β released by LC binds to IL-1R in TM (autocrine signaling)
  and/or to IL-1R in LC (paracrine signaling). 7-) In TM, IL-1β triggers IkB-α degradation
  and activates NF-kB translocation to nucleus. NF-kB triggers genes expression, such
  as pro-IL-1β, CD163 and TNF-α. 8-) TM also transport 25-HC and/or 25-HX directly
  to LC, contributing to the steroidogenic activity of LC. Created using BioRender.com
