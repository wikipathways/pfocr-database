caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed mechanisms by which HMGB1 regulates
  lipolysis in adipocytes. HMGB1 is a key lipid metabolism regulator through the c-Src/CAV1
  signaling pathway. HMGB1 does not affect adipogenesis, including preadipocyte proliferation
  or differentiation, but significantly inhibits lipolysis in mature adipocytes. This
  inhibition occurs through the suppression of HSL phosphorylation and ERK activation,
  without altering upstream cAMP signaling, and acts downstream of β3-adrenoreceptor
  activation. In mature adipocytes, HMGB1 physically interacts with CAV1, whose phosphorylation
  by Src kinase negatively regulates HMGB1 secretion. As a result, HMGB1 serves as
  a negative regulator of lipolysis through CAV1-dependent mechanisms, highlighting
  a potential therapeutic target for obesity-related cardiovascular diseases
