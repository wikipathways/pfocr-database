caption: Gene cluster responsible for stravidin production and the proposed biosynthetic
  pathway. (A) ORFs in BGC_Others_61 producing 5 and 6 and their putative functions
  (color coordinated with the legend). Two streptavidin genes (yellow) are found in
  close proximity to the BGC. (B) Proposed biosynthetic pathway for 5 and 6, shown
  as enzymatic reactions catalyzed by putative proteins from BGC_Others_61 (color
  coordinated with ORFs shown in panel (A); 2-MCM, 2-(4-methyl cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-amine)
  malate; PDX, prephenate decarboxylase).
