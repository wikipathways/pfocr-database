caption: The Hippo pathway is regulated by the integration of a range of upstream
  stimuli. This includes mechanotransductive elements (such as caveolae and Piezo
  signalling), metabolism, extracellular matrix and integrin signalling, transduction
  of extracellular stimuli via mitogenic growth factor signalling and GPCRs, cell
  polarity and cell–cell contacts. Activation of the Hippo pathway triggers a phosphorylation
  cascade that leads to the phosphorylation of the Hippo pathway effectors YAP/TAZ.
  Phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ redistributes YAP/TAZ to the cytoplasm, blocking TEAD-mediated
  gene expression. Hippo pathway inactivation prevents YAP/TAZ phosphorylation, allowing
  their nuclear translocation and hence TEAD-mediated gene expression. Note that MST1/2
  (mammalian STE20-like kinase1/2) are encoded by STK4/3, and TAZ by WWTR1. Figure
