caption: Schematic showing the proposed dynamic changes in the localization of LHCGR,
  DENND1A.V2, and RAB5B in various cellular compartments. LH/hCG binding to the LH
  receptor (LHCGR), or forskolin stimulation (F), is predicted to promote the interaction
  between the guanine nucleotide exchange factor DENND1A.V2, in clathrin-coated pits,
  with the GTPase RAB5B. LHCGR, DENND1A.V2, and RAB5B move into early endocytic vesicles.
  LHCGR is subsequently recycled to the plasma membrane from the endocytic vesicles.
  Some LHCGR, DENND1A.V2, and RAB5B move to the Golgi, and some DENND1A.V2 and RAB5B,
  but not LHCGR, enter into the nucleus, where they could participate in regulating
  transcription of CY17A1 and CYP11A1, along with the cAMP signaling pathway, augmenting
  androgen production.
