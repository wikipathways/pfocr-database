caption: 'Regulatory mechanisms of AMPK in MASH-associated inflammatory response.
  (A) Intercellular pro-inflammatory mediator network in MASH pathology: Hepatocyte
  injury releases DAMPs, triggering macrophage activation and production of pro-inflammatory
  mediators (cytokines, ROS, NO, and chemokines), which amplify inflammatory responses
  and induce hepatic stellate cell activation. (B) AMPK regulation of inflammatory
  response in hepatocytes: In hepatocytes, AMPK inhibits inflammatory cytokine expression
  through SIRT1-mediated p65 deacetylation. Meanwhile, AMPK regulates mitochondrial
  quality through multiple levels: promoting mitochondrial biogenesis via p38MAPK/SIRT1/HDAC5/FNIP1-PGC1α
  axis; regulating mitochondrial dynamics through MFF; coordinating mitophagy via
  FNIP1-TFEB/TFE3 and Parkin/ULK1-NIX dual pathways. Additionally, AMPK enhances antioxidant
  defense by activating Nrf2 and inhibits apoptotic cascade initiation through Procaspase-6
  phosphorylation. (C) AMPK regulation of inflammatory response in macrophages: In
  Kupffer cells, AMPK reduces pro-inflammatory mediator production by inhibiting NF-κB/IκBα
  and iNOS/NO signaling pathways while activating the SIRT1-TTP axis. In monocyte-derived
  macrophages, decreased AMPK activity leads to mTOR/PGC1α pathway activation, resulting
  in metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial dysfunction, increased ROS production,
  and exacerbated inflammatory response. (D) AMPK regulation of fibrosis in hepatic
  stellate cells: Competitively binding with p300 to inhibit SMAD2/3-mediated collagen
  expression; suppressing TGF-β signaling through NO/sGC/cGMP-mediated SMAD7 upregulation;
  reducing cellular pH by inhibiting v-ATPase activity; suppressing ROS-AKT signaling
  pathway through antioxidant enzyme upregulation; inhibiting HSC proliferation via
  p53-p21/p27 axis and NF-κB/mTOR pathway'
