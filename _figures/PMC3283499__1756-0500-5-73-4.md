caption: Top network comparisons. A. N vs. T - Organ Development and Nutrition Disease
  network. B. NB vs. T - Molecular Transport and Small Molecule Biochemistry network.
  C. ND vs. T - Cancer and Cellular Growth and Proliferation network. D. NB vs. ND
  - Organ Development, Nutritional Disease network. Maps were created by Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis software. Red icons depict genes up-regulated; green icons depict
  down-regulated genes. Color intensity represents the degree of dysregulation, for
  example, the dark red indicates more overexpression than light red. Lines show interactions
  between proteins.
