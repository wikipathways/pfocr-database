caption: Model of plant height regulation in C. praecox (dw and NH). In the synthesis
  pathway, the red character indicates the up-regulated gene in dw. The red arrow
  indicates that decreased GA content promotes the up-regulation of synthetic gene
  expression, and the green arrow indicates that GA2ox reduces the active GA. In the
  signal transduction pathway, short vertical lines represent more active DELLA proteins
  that inhibit the elongation of C. praecox branches, while dotted arrows represent
  less active DELLA proteins that allow normal C. praecox growth.
