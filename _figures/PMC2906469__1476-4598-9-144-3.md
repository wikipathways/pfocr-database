caption: Progressive inactivation of GSK3β may promote increased anti-apoptosis and
  oral cancer. GSK3β-mediated signaling controls apoptosis in OSCC. In the intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway, inactive GSK3β fails to promote apoptosis by the disruption of
  mitochondrial membrane potential resulting from disruption of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio.
  Overexpression of Bcl-2 and suppression of Bax occur frequently in OSCC. This may
  be due to either inactive p53 (in the subgroup of cases in which p53 is not mutated
  or silenced) or active CREB; both are controlled by GSK3β. In the extrinsic pathway,
  active GSK3β promotes apoptosis by inducing procaspase-8 activation. Moreover, the
  inactivated GSK3β might send survival signals via the extrinsic pathway by blocking
  procaspase-8 activation in OSCC. By doing this, GSK3β might maintain the balance
  between proliferation and death and contribute to tissue homeostasis in normal oral
  epithelium; these might be perturbed in OSCC.
