caption: Cripto is one of the earliest EPI markers. Cripto-positive cells display
  a salt-and-pepper distribution and co-localize with Nanog-positive cells (light
  green) within the ICM of the pre-implantation blastocyst (E3.5). Next, Cripto expression
  becomes homogeneous in the late blastocyst (E4.5), marking all the cells of the
  EPI (dark green), whereas it is absent in both the TE (dark blue) and in the PrE
  (light blue). In mouse ESCs, surface Cripto is heterogeneous and highly dynamic
  and correlates with high levels of pluripotency markers. Moreover, Cripto regulates
  mouse ESC self-renewal by positively modulating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
  Conversely, Cripto regulates the metabolic reprogramming that occurs in the transition
  from ESCs to EpiSCs, at least in part through the Nodal/Smad2/Pgc-1b axis. Finally,
  Cripto/Nodal/Smad2 sustains mouse EpiSC/hESC self-renewal and prevents transdifferentiation
  towards the trophoblast lineage, by repressing BMP/Smad1-5 signalling. Our findings
  place Cripto at the interface of the mouse and human pluripotency networks, and
  provide unprecedented evidence that it restricts ESC differentiation potential towards
  embryonic tissue.
