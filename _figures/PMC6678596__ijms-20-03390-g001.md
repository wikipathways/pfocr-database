caption: 'Representation of the main DNA repair pathways involved in platinum salts-induced
  DNA damage. SSBs are mainly repaired by the BER pathway, which needs proficient
  DNA glycosylases that recognize and cleave the damaged base. Then, APE1 removes
  the abasic site that can be sealed by Polβ and ligases. In the case of DSBs, HR
  plays a crucial role. The MRN complex recognizes the DSB and recruits ATM and ATR,
  which can eventually induce cell cycle arrest through p53. Subsequently, ATM can
  cause the recruitment of BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 which determine the RAD51 loading
  and the subsequent DNA synthesis. BER: base excision repair; DBS: double-strand
  break; HR: homologous recombination repair; Pt: platinum salts; SSB: single-strand
  break.'
