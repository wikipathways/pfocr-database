caption: RhoA regulates phosphorylation of myosin light chain. Activation of RhoA
  leads to increased levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain and is associated
  with increased cellular contraction (see pathway on the left). GEF-H1 activates
  RhoA by exchanging GDP with GTP to activate RhoA, which in turn activates ROCK,
  a serine-threonine kinase, which leads to phosphorylation and inactivation of myosin
  phosphatase and subsequent accumulation of MLC-p. MLC-p is associated with cellular
  contraction. Tight junctions (TJs) regulate RhoA activation by sequestering GEF-H1
  (see pathway on the right). Because Bves regulates TJ formation, we hypothesize
  that Bves can also modulate levels of MLC-p.
