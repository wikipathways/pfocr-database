caption: (i) Under basal conditions, the Wnt signaling pathway is kept inactive via
  the degradosome, which promotes the highly efficient phosphorylation of β-catenin
  to ultimately trigger its proteasomal degradation. (ii) The degradosome is formed
  via LLPS driven by multivalent interactions between the scaffold proteins Axin and
  APC, which recruit β-catenin, along with kinases such as GSKβ, as client proteins.
  (iii) When Wnt binds the cell-surface receptors Frizzled and LRP5/6, Axin gets recruited
  to Dishevelled oligomers at the plasma membrane, triggering LLPS of the Wnt signalosome
  (iv). Inhibition of GSK3β within the signalosome (not shown) allows β-catenin to
  accumulate in the cytosol and subsequently translocate into the nucleus (v), where
  β-catenin itself undergoes LLPS at transcriptional enhancers to induce target gene
  expression.
