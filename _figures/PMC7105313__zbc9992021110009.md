caption: Two hypothetical hybrid DNA repair pathways that could promote repeat instability.
  A, an oxidized nucleotide within a repetitive tract is being removed by the BER
  pathway to create a nick. In the course of strand displacement synthesis, the displaced
  flap might form a DNA secondary structure (e.g. a hairpin). The structure is stabilized
  by MutSβ and gets incorporated into the DNA, resulting in a repeat expansion. B,
  when a repeat is located in an actively transcribed gene, RNA polymerase might promote
  formation of a DNA secondary structure, such as S-DNA. These structures, when additionally
  stabilized by MutSβ, stall the next RNA polymerase, triggering NER. The NER repair
  might lead to either excision or incorporation of a secondary structure, leading
  to repeat contraction (this scenario is shown) or expansion (not shown), respectively.
