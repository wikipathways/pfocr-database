caption: (A) Role of agrin and YAP in carcinogenesis. In healthy tissue, the Hippo
  signaling pathway regulates transcription via phosphorylation of YAP, which results
  in its confinement out of the cell nucleus. In cancerous tissue an increase in ECM
  stiffness is associated with increased levels of extracellular agrin. Agrin binds
  to the receptor Lrp4, which activates MuSK, eventually promoting a signaling cascade
  involving the FAK-ILK-PAK1 axis. This results in the inhibition of the Hippo pathway
  that in turn leads to an increase in unphosphorylated YAP. The activity of YAP in
  the nucleus promotes not only cell-cycle and division but also a further increase
  in ECM stiffness, possibly following enhanced agrin expression, in a positive feedback
  mechanism that leads to uncontrolled proliferation. (B) Schematic of the role of
  agrin in mouse cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation as proposed in Bassat et al. ().
  In neonates, binding of agrin to the α-subunit of dystroglycan (DG) interferes with
  its correct assembly within the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), and ultimately
  prevents the β-subunit from binding the transcription factor YAP, whose activity
  in the nucleus promotes CM proliferation. With maturation, replacement of agrin
  with a different protein (probably laminin) of the extracellular matrix (ECM) allows
  for a stable assembly of the DGC, so that β-DG can bind and sequester phosphorylated
  YAP out of the nucleus, thus eventually hindering CM proliferation. The timing and
  mechanism of YAP phosphorylation, as well as of α-DG glycosylation, have to be determined
  yet, and might have a role in the molecular pathway. The dashed arrow between the
  two panels indicates the potential re-activation of CM proliferation induced by
  controlled delivery of exogenous agrin to injured cardiac tissue.
