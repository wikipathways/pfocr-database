caption: INHBA promotes lung cancer cell invasion via inhibiting the Hippo pathway.
  (A) Protein complex of Merlin, FRMD6 and WWC1 activates the Hippo pathway, which
  increases the phosphorylation of YAP and prevents its translocation and binding
  to TEAD in the nucleus. (B) INHBA inhibits the Hippo pathway by downregulating Merlin
  expression, which decreases the phosphorylation of YAP, and promotes its translocation
  and binding to TEAD in the nucleus. INHBA, inhibin βA; YAP, yes-associated protein;
  WWC1, WW and C2 domain-containing 1; FRMD6, FERM domain-containing 6; MST, mammalian
  sterile 20-like 1/MOB kinase; LATS, large tumor suppressor kinase; p, phosphorylated;
  TEAD, TEA domain; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; Cyr61, cysteine rich angiogenic
  inducer 61.
