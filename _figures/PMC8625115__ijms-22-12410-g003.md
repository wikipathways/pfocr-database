caption: 'The High osmolarity/glycerol (HOG) pathway and the filamentous growth pathways
  respond to high d-glucose concentrations (high osmotic stress) and low d-glucose
  concentrations (nutrient starvation), respectively. The two pathways share many
  elements, due to Sho1p being involved in sensing both nutrient starvation and osmotic
  stress. Both pathways belong to the MAPK signaling pathways that transmit the regulatory
  signals through phosphorylation of target proteins. Note that all the MAPK pathway
  targets undergo activation and deactivation by phosphorylation, but that only Sko1p
  has been illustrated with these details in order to facilitate comparison with its
  activity in . MAPK: mitogen activated protein kinase; MAPKK: mitogen activated protein
  kinase-kinase; MAPKKK: mitogen activated protein kinase-kinase-kinase. Arrows with
  arrowheads: induction; arrows with hammerheads: repression; dashed arrows: signaling.
  Yellow shapes: MAPK pathways (HOG1 and filamentous growth pathway); blue shapes:
  cAMP/PKA pathway elements; orange shapes: SNF1/Mig1p pathway elements; white shapes:
  proteins from other pathways. Adapted from [,,].'
