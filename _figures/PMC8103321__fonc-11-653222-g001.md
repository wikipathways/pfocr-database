caption: Illustration of APC gene-related pathways and interactive genes. In the absence
  of a Wnt signal (Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is inactive state, see left), the
  phosphorylated β-catenin can be formed by the destruction complex and degraded by
  ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Protein truncation generated by mutation in the
  APC gene or decreased level of APC protein influenced by other factors (such as
  hypermethylated APC promoter, improved expression of EZH2 and YY1, or suppressed
  expression of CDX2, CEBPZ, and USF1/2) can activate the canonical pathway (Wnt signaling
  active, see right). When the destruction complex disassembles, the β-catenin fails
  to be degraded and accumulates in the cytoplasm, translocates into the nucleus,
  and binds to TCF/LEF transcription factor family, causing the abnormal expression
  of downstream genes. The illustration was created with BioRender.com.
