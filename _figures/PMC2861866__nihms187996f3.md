caption: A hypothetical model linking multiple biological pathways in the development
  of SS-like disease based on differentially expressed genes identified in lacrimal
  glands by global microarray analyses. Starting with 27 genes identified as differentially
  expressed, a model for cellular dysfunction, initiation of inflammation, and altered
  antigen presentation has been designed that forms a basis for lacrimal gland pathology
  in SS. This model focuses considerable attention on reduced antigen-presentation
  by dendritic cells and macrophages in favor of B-cell antigen presentation considered
  more likely to result in autoimmune responses. Microarray data shows that transcripts
  for retinoic acid receptors RXR-α and RAR, as well as prostaglandin-α-activated
  PPAR-γ, are highly downregulated. These factors help regulate fatty acid, lipoprotein,
  and cholesterol homeostasis within cells and tissues, plus differentiation of DC;
  therefore, we hypothesize that an imbalance in the retinoic acid pathway leading
  to fatty acid, lipoprotein, and cholesterol dysregulation results in DC populations
  in NOD and C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice that exhibit reduced responses to CSF, as previously
  reported.At the same time, there is apparently dysregulation in the interaction
  of the cathepsins and cystatins, especially the regulation of cathepsin-S by cystatin-C.
  Cystatin-C is a major inhibitor of the cathepsin-S in macrophages and DC. Gene expression
  of cathepsin-S indicates that it is highly upregulated during the early phases of
  disease development, but unlike the other cathepsins, eg, cathepsin-B, which is
  down-regulated, its expression remains elevated as the SS-like disease progresses.
  Since cathepsin-S (and IL-6) remains resistant to regulation by cystatin-C, we suggest
  that the levels of this protein become too high in the lysosomes, resulting in the
  breakdown of the MHC-class II binding with the invariant chain, CD74. This is known
  to prevent proper loading of the MHC-class II molecules with antigen for proper
  presentation by macrophages and DC, thereby permitting increased antigen presentation
  by B-cells, increasing the chance for autoimmunity. In contrast, cathepsin-B is
  strongly downregulated, and this results in the increased expression of multiple
  genes, eg, cathepsin-H, metallothionein, β-2-microglobulin, C1q, fibronectin and
  apolipoprotein-D.While each of these factors can play an important role in the onset
  and propagation of inflammation,, fibronectin is involved in multiple pathways.
  In addition to promoting association of integrins with transmembrane proteins (encoded
  by Tmem), thereby influencing cell migration, fibronectin can bind to collagen type-1α1
  and α2 (precursors of the more prominent collagen of the eye) with subsequent activation
  of Raf1, a molecule that is highly pro-apoptotic.
