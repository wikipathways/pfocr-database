caption: A) Structures of various fusion reporter proteins between EGFR pathway proteins
  (EGFR, Shc, Grb2) and the fragments of firefly luciferase (Nluc, Cluc represents
  the N- and C- terminal halves of the firefly luciferase gene). The retroviral vector
  pLPCX and pLNCX were used to carry the reporter genes (with resistance genes for
  puromycin and neomycin, respectively).B) Graphic illustration of the principles
  of EGFR activity reporters used in this study. Three different versions of the reporters
  were shown.C) Western blot analyses of the expression of endogenous and recombinant
  EGFR pathway proteins after transduction of one or both components of the reporter
  system into the human lung cancer line H322.
