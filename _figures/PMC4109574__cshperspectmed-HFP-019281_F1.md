caption: Mating in Candida albicans. Mating in Candida albians involves both homozygosis
  from a/α to a/a or α/α, and a switch from the white to opaque phenotype. (A) Homozygosis
  from a/α to a/a or α/α results in the loss of the a1-α2 corepressor complex, which
  represses both mating and switching. (B) Attaining mating competence is a two-step
  process, involving first homozygosis at the mating type locus, and a second phenotypic
  switch from the white to opaque phenotype. The latter involves a network of inter-regulatory
  and autoregulatory transcription factors and chromatin modifications, affected by
  a number of environmental conditions. (C) The cell biology of mating between opaque
  a/a and α/α cells is similar to that of S. cerevisiae, but involves long conjugation
  tubes and the formation of an a/a/α/α daughter cell. (D) The pheromone response
  pathway for mating activation has been conserved in the hemiascomycetes, so that
  all components, pheromone to the major targeted transcription factor, are orthologs
  of those components in the S. cerevisiae response pathway.
