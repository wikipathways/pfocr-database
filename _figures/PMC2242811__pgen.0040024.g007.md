caption: In response to dietary restriction using the eat-2 mutation, TOR and RAB-10
  activities fall, which triggers autophagy. Autophagy requires altered gene expression,
  since its appearance requires the transcription factor PHA-4. Autophagy is necessary
  but not sufficient for lifespan extension in long-lived daf-2 insulin/IGF-1-receptor
  mutants; instead, autophagy and the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor are both required,
  independently, for lifespan extension. Inhibiting protein synthesis in well-fed
  animals may activate a distinct longevity pathway, since inhibiting protein synthesis
  in the context of dietary restriction produces a lifespan extension that requires
  autophagy gene function, whereas inhibiting protein synthesis in well-fed animals
  produces a lifespan extension that is independent of autophagy gene function. The
  sir-2 histone deacetylase is not in this diagram, as we [] and several other groups
  [–] have found that sir-2 deletion mutations do not prevent dietary restriction
  from increasing lifespan in C. elegans.
