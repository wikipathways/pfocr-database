caption: Functional associations of genes identified by discriminant function analysis
  (DFA) in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) who were undergoing treatment.
  Tabular data from the this analysis was analyzed using Pathway Assist software.
  The graphical output delineating a functionally related network of genes is shown.
  Genes that were associated with disease or treatment response are represented as
  red ovals. Major biologic processes related to these genes are represented as yellow
  rectangles. White ovals represent genes that are functionally related to the genes
  used for analysis. Orange hexagons represent classes of small molecules associated
  with the genes analyzed, and orange circles represent specific small molecules associated
  with the genes analyzed. Green squares signify that a defined regulatory relationship
  exits between genes. Blue squares signify that a putative regulatory relationship
  between genes has been identified but not biochemically defined. +, positive regulation;
  -, negative regulation.
