caption: The functions and related signaling events of COMP in chondrocyte phenotype
  maintenance, migration, and attachment. In joint, COMP can be expressed in cartilage,
  synovium, tendon, ligament, and meniscus. COMP maintains chondrocyte phenotypes
  and promotes cell migration and attachment, while suppressing hypertrophy. COMP
  modifies the MAPK and TGF signaling pathways. COMP can induce the phosphorylation
  of Erk1/2, while this effect can be attenuated by TGF-β1. TGF-β1 can induce COMP
  expression and the interaction between COMP and TGF-β1 enhances the effects of TGF
  β signaling pathway, forming a regulation loop. Dotted lines and question marks
  indicate undetermined mechanisms.
