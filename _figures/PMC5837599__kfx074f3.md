caption: Typical structure and content of exosomes. Depending on their cellular origin,
  exosomes can contain a diverse cargo. Thus exosomes isolated from immune cells,
  enterocytes and even melanocytes have the antigen-presenting receptors MHC Class
  I/II and scaffolding proteins such as tetraspanins. Since exosomes are a part of
  vesicular trafficking, various proteins involved in this pathway, such as Rab proteins,
  Annexins, and cytoskeletal proteins, constitute the exosomal payload. In addition,
  the cargo can also contain metabolic components such as enzymes, lipids, small carbohydrates
  as well as small RNAs and miRNAs.
