caption: 'Kinetic models describing the in vivo metabolism of the HDL apolipoproteins
  on each HDL size fraction. SAAM II models highlighting the synthesis and removal
  pathways for each apolipoprotein across the HDL size fractions: ApoA-I (A), ApoA-II
  (B), ApoE (C), ApoM (D), ApoC-III (E) and ApoA-IV (F). Each model contains an input
  compartment, which represent the plasma amino acid precursor pool (D3-Leu tracer
  enrichment in plasma) expressed as a forcing function. The same D3-Leu tracer enrichment
  curve was used for all protein models per participant. The source compartment accounts
  for the time necessary for labeled protein to appear on each HDL size fraction in
  plasma. Source pathways: number next to arrow represents average flux (mg/kg/d)
  through each pathway for the three participants. Numbers in parentheses represent
  average percent source of each protein into each HDL size fraction. Removal pathways:
  numbers next to arrows are average rates (pools/day), and numbers in parentheses
  are average percent of protein removed by that pathway. EVD may represent a processing
  compartment that includes apoA-I on prebeta that has been secreted but is outside
  the systemic circulation. LA1 prebeta may be generated from α3 HDL through the release
  of LA1. ApoA-II α3 and α2 arrows: top dashed arrow is a source and bottom solid
  arrow is a removal pathway.'
