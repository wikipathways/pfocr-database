caption: (a). PI3-kinase/AKT/GSK3β pathway control of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine
  production in innate immune cells determines the balance of Th1 and Th2 immune responses.
  Plextrin homology (PH) domain containing kinases, PDK, and AKT are recruited to
  the plasma membrane and bind to PIP3. PDK phosphorylates AKT on Thr308 in the activation
  loop, and this is followed by Ser473 phosphorylation. For MyD88-dependent signaling,
  TLR-mediated inhibition of GSK3, via AKT phosphorylation of its Ser 9 residue leads
  to increases in DNA binding of cAmp response element binding protein 1 (CREB), which
  displaces the coactivator CBP from NFκB. The increased CREB activity leads to production
  of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Th2 cytokine) and lowered IL-12 production.
  Inhibition of PI3-K via dephosphorylation of PIP3 by the phosphatase PTEN enables
  GSK3 to remain active to inhibit transcription factors such as cJun and CREB thereby
  decreasing IL-10, increasing NFκB-mediated IL-12 expression, and enhancing Th1 responses.
  (b) lamina propria T (LPT) cells are hyporesponsive to TCR stimulation and use the
  alternative CD-2 pathway. PI3-kinase AKT/GSK3β pathway downstream of CD-2 likely
  targets the AP-1 and NFAT sites on the IL-2 promoter. The activity of the PIP3 phosphatase,
  PTEN is likely reduced in LPT cells due to the increased thioredoxin (TrX1) in these
  cells. Multiple TCR stimulation of LPT cells has been reported to induce FOXP3/IL-10
  producing immunosuppressive Treg cells []. (c) PI3-kinase-dependent pathways to
  IL-6 gene transcription in response to IL-1 in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells.
  IL-1 binding to the IL-1R1 increases its affinity for the co-receptor, the IL-1
  receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP). Formation of the signaling module containing
  the MyD88 adaptor protein together with phosphorylated IRAK (interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase) and TRAF-6 (TNF receptor-associated factor) is essential for PI3-K recruitment
  and AKT activation. The TAK1 (TGFβ activated kinase) signaling module is likely
  a separate parallel pathway to NFκB activation. We identified 2 separate pathways
  to the induction of IL-6 transcription in response to IL-1, the first is a novel
  IKKα-dependent pathway involving phosphorylation of the T23 residue on IKKα, upstream
  of AP-1 (activator protein 1) activation, and the second is an AKT-dependent activation
  of NFκB, likely via phosphorylation of the p65 subunit [].
