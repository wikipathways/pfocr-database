caption: Stressed levels of cortisol elevate SOCS transcript levels and reduce GH
  signaling and the corresponding IGF-1 expression in rainbow trout liver by preventing
  STAT5 phosphorylation and decreasing total JAK2 protein expression. The cortisol-induced
  upregulation of SOCS may be playing a role in the suppression of LPS-induced IL-6
  expression (a cytokine signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway). Immune challenge
  with LPS may indirectly inhibit GH signaling by elevating plasma cortisol levels
  or directly inhibit GH signaling and the corresponding IGF-1 expression by downregulating
  growth hormone receptors 1 and 2 and by preventing STAT5 phosphorylation.
