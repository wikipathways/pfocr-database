caption: The proposed model of how NHR-49 regulates a new hypoxia response parallel
  to HIF-1. During normoxia, the transcription factor NHR-67 negatively regulates
  NHR-49. However, during hypoxia, NHR-49 represses nhr-67, and the kinase HPK-1 positively
  regulates NHR-49, possibly directly or indirectly. This allows NHR-49 to activate
  its downstream hypoxia response target genes, including fmo-2, acs-2, and autophagy
  genes, whose induction is required for worm survival to hypoxia. (Figure created
