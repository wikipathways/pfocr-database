caption: Position of D27 within the  biosynthesis and signaling pathway. Enzymatic
  steps are denoted with solid arrows, transport steps with dashed arrows, and signaling
  steps with thick arrows. AtD14 may be a  receptor, a hydrolytic enzyme that processes  into
  a further active compound, or a combination of both; for a discussion, see . [See
