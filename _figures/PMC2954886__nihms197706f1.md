caption: Schematic illustration of potential mechanisms by which SHP-1 regulates mast
  cell development and function. SHP-1 can bind to FcεRI and down-regulates its signaling
  after cross-linking induced by antigen and IgE, thus to control mast cell degranulation.
  In the process, SHP-1 may bind the adapter molecule LAT2. SHP-1 is also recruited
  to c-Kit when its ligand SCF is recognized. Through this interaction, SHP-1 is able
  to regulate mast cell differentiation, maturation, and survival, since c-Kit is
  essential for mast cells. The c-Kit signaling is largely through the PI3 kinase
  pathway. SHP-1 may be a target for intracellular oxidants, but SHP-1 may also be
  able to control oxidant-induced Th2 cytokine production by mast cells. This process
  is potentially regulated by the NF-κB signaling pathway. Finally, SHP-1 is a negative
  regulator of endotoxin (LPS)-induced mast cell production of IL-13. However, this
  regulation is independent of oxidant stress and NF-κB but possibly involves the
  MAP kinase signaling pathway. The up-regulation of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 in
  the absence of SHP-1 regulation is able to increase the survival of mast cells,
  probably by a mechanism that keeps the cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle
  that slows down cell proliferation
