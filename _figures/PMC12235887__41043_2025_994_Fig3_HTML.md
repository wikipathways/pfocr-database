caption: 'Hypothermia regulates bone metabolism through A neuroendocrine pathways
  and B gut microbiota-derived SCFAs. Note: (A) hypothermia can promote the secretion
  of thyroid hormones by activating the HPT axis, thereby enhancing osteoblast activity.
  Simultaneously, it can activate the HPA axis, leading to high concentrations of
  adrenal cortical hormones that inhibit osteoblast function. Additionally, hypothermia
  reduces blood perfusion and nutrient absorption in bone tissue through peripheral
  vasoconstriction, which in turn decreases the metabolic activity of bone cells and
  the alkaline phosphatase activity of osteoblasts, ultimately reducing bone matrix
  synthesis. Prolonged exposure to hypothermias may result in bone loss. (B) Chronic
  cold exposure has been shown to reduce the abundance of butyrate-producing microbiota
  (Fecococcus, Trichospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae) in the intestinal tract while increasing
  the prevalence of Clostridium, Riomycetidae, and Bacteroides. It is hypothesized
  that this alteration disrupts bone formation by decreasing butyric acid synthesis,
  which reduces the number of Treg cells in the bone marrow and inhibits the production
  of osteogenic Wnt10b ligands. Additionally, the Mucoricaceae family exhibits a positive
  correlation with bone mineral density, whereas the Bacteroides genus demonstrates
  a negative correlation with bone mineral density and is associated with an increased
  risk of osteoporosis. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms by which low temperatures
  influence bone metabolism via the gut microbiota remain underexplored and warrant
  further detailed investigation'
