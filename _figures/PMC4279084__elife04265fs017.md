  arrows and blocks indicate aspects of the pathway that were previously known. Red
  blocks and font indicate the major findings of this study. Blue font indicates factors
  known to function in this pathway that were also identified in our enhancer screen
  () as genetic interactors of GW182 (ain-1 and/or ain-2). The blue asterisk associated
  with let-7 is to indicate that we also identified the let-7 family miRNAs in our
  miRNA-ced-3 enhancer screen () and that ced-3(lf) was able to enhance their specific
  temporal cell fate patterning phenotypes as seen with adult-specific alae defects
  (). The blue asterisks and dashed red lines for miR-1 and miR-246 indicate additional
  miRNAs we identified in our miRNA-ced-3 enhancer screen (). Both miR-1 and miR-246
  are predicted to target lin-14 mRNA (See ‘Materials and methods’) but have not been
  experimentally demonstrated to do so here. They failed to show enhanced specific
  developmental timing defects and were not pursued further. Dashed arrows and blocks
  are intended to indicate a combination of complex direct and indirect effects ultimately
  affecting developmental fate and timing. ** Previous works have indicated DAF-12
  functions on several components of the pathway (; ), providing the basis for us
  to have observed the enhanced developmental defects associated with ain-1(lf) and
  daf-12(RNAi) (). The exact mechanism of LIN-66 function is still unclear (dashed
  block) though it is able to negatively regulate LIN-28 function (). MSI-1 (Musashi-1)
  was identified as an RNA-binding protein that may be important for LIN-28-mediated
  regulation of pre-miRNA processing as well as translational regulation (; ). Interestingly,
  we also identified the C. elegans musashi-1 ortholog, msi-1, as an enhancer in our
  screen (). Following binding by LIN-28, pre-let-7 is poly-uridylated by a TUTase
  (poly-U-polymerase) to mark it for destruction. PUP-2 is indicated here as a C.
  elegans ortholog for TUTase and it was also identified in our screen (). Recently,
  the RNAse, Dis3l2 (Dis-3-like RNAse gene 2), was identified as the 3′-5′ exonuclease
  that degrades poly-uridylated-pre-let-7 miRNA and is the RNAse mutated in Perlman
  syndrome (; ; ). We suggest that the C. elegans gene F48E8.6 is the C. elegans ortholog
  of Dis3l2 and have therefore named it DISL-2 (Dis-3-like RNAse gene 2) (See ). The
  intricate network of regulatory factors shown here emphasizes the importance of
  this pathway and how CED-3 caspase cooperates with the miRISC and numerous other
  factors to control temporal cell fate patterning.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04265.036'
