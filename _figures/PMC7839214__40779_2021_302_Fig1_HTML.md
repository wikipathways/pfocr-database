caption: 'The schematic diagram of BCMA mediated signal conduction and immunotherapeutic
  strategies targeting BCMA in MM. BCMA is one of the most specific antigens in MM,
  which is closely related to transmembrane protein BAFF-R and TACI. BAFF binds to
  BCMA, BAFF-R and TACI, while APRIL binds to BCMA and TACI depending on CD138 (syndecan-1).
  BCMA delivers critical signal via APRIL, which regulates MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and NFκB
  pathway, to induce B-cell maturation and differentiation into plasma cells. BCMA
  is a natural substrate for γ-secretase that forms sBCMA, which may neutralize anti-BCMA
  immune drug. Immune therapeutic strategies targeting BCMA include BCMA-targeted
  vaccines, anti-BCMA antibodies (such as ADCs, RITs and BsAbs) and BCMA-targeted
  CAR cells including autologous or allogeneic BCMA CAR T cells, dual-antigen targeting
  CAR T-cell strategies and BCMA CAR on other cells. Representative therapies discussed
  in the review are listed. BCMA: B cell maturation antigen; APRIL: A proliferation-inducing
  ligand; BAFF: B-cell activating factor; BAFF-R: B-cell activating factor receptor;
  TACI: Transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor;
  sBCMA: Soluble BCMA; mAbs: Monoclonal antibodies; ADCs: Monoclonal antibodies bound
  to toxic drug; RITs: Recombinant immunotoxins; BsAbs: Bispecific antibodies; CAR:
  Chimeric antigen receptor; CTL: Cytotoxic T-cell'
