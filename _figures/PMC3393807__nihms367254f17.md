caption: We examined the deprotection of 61 as a means of confirming the structure
  assignment. Treatment of 61 with pyridine (2.5 equiv) and pyrdine·(HF)x (3 equiv)
  in CDCl3 for 30 min afforded a compound in 40% yield whose structure was eventually
  established as 65 by careful analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectra (see ). MMX calculations
  with conformational searching were carried out on the analogue of 65 with TMS rather
  than TBS ethers using PCMODEL 9.3. The s-trans amide conformer is calculated to
  be 5.4 kcal/mol more stable than the s-cis amide conformer. The observed and (calculated)
  coupling constants between H3a and H4 [13.2 (12.1) Hz], H3b and H4 [4.4 (4.1) Hz]
  and H4 and H5 [10.0, (8.6)] correspond closely. A plausible pathway for the conversion
  of 61 to 65 involves the hydrolysis of the peroxy silyl ether and protonation of
  the enamine to give cation 63, which cyclizes to give dioxetane 64, which fragments
  to give hexahydro-2,7-azacinedione 65. A related oxidative cleavage of the ring
  fusion double bond of 1-acetyl-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydro-6-methylquinoline with
  RuO4 afforded 1-acetyl(octahydro)-5-methyl-2,7-azacinedione.
