caption: Mechanism through which flavonoids induce cancer cell autophagy. Many autophagic
  regulators may determine the process of autophagy. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein
  kinase B (AKT) can stimulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is
  negatively regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), to suppress activation
  of the unc-51-like kinase (ULK)1/2 complex. Additionally, MAPK can be directly activated
  by the ULK1/2 complex in an independent mTOR manner. Subsequently, the ULK1/2 complex
  triggers membrane nucleation by phosphorylating the PI3K III complex, including
  phosphorylation beclin-1, activation AMBRA1, Atg14, and p115. The PI3K III complex
  recruits two interrelated ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) binding systems (the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16
  system and LC3 system) to regulate membrane elongation and autophagosome expansion.
  Damaged proteins and organelles are brought into the autophagosome through the LC3
  complex containing p62/SQSTM1. If the damaged protein is not transported to the
  autophagosome, p62/SQSTM1 accumulates in the cell, exacerbating endoplasmic reticulum
  stress. mTOR, as an important target for autophagy, is targeted by several tumor
  regulators, such as TSC1/2, PTEN, JAK2, silent information regulator 2 homolog 1
  (SIRT1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), p53, and reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  In particular, heat shock proteins (HSPs) can stabilize proto-oncogene c-Myc activation,
  upregulating mTOR expression and promoting cell survival. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), by
  targeting various target genes or proteins such as miR-25, directly target the ULK1
  complex and miR-520b targets the Atg7 protein, inhibiting autophagy to improve the
  chemosensitivity. BH3-only proteins (Bad, Bcl-2 adenovirus E1B 19-kDa-interacting
  protein 3 (BNIP3), Puma, Bcl-XL, and BH3 domain mimics) bind to the anti-apoptotic
  protein Bcl-2, directly regulating autophagy and apoptosis. Similarly, the high-mobility
  group box 1 protein (HMGB1) competitively combines with Beclin-1 to form a complex
  promoting the autophagy process and chemotherapy resistance. Transforming growth
  factor (TGF)-β1 exerts antitumorigenic functions mediated by Smads, and increases
  beclin1 levels, which interacts with the increased levels of Bcl-XL and decreased
  levels of Bcl-2 to induce autophagy. SIRT1 regulates the deacetylation of autophagy-associated
  proteins (LC3 and forkhead box class O (FoxO)) to trigger autophagy. Additionally,
  some signal pathways and alteration of the metabolic environment can mediate the
  autophagy signals of tumor cells, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, death-associated
  protein kinase (DAPK)-related protein kinase (Drp1)-dependent mitochondrial fission,
  the ERK signal pathway, and glycolysis. The mechanism of flavonoids regulating autophagy
  is diverse in different tumor cells. Numerous flavonoids regulate the autophagy
  of tumor cells by targeting the mTOR signal pathway. Moreover, quercetin, silibinin
  (SIL), isoxanthohumol (IXN), chrysin, baicalein, Licochalcone A (LA), and galangin
  stimulate autophagy by targeting apoptosis-related proteins or HMGB1 to regulate
  the interaction between Bcl-2 and beclin-1. Vitexin, chrysin, baicalein, apigenin,
  and galangin interfere with UBL binding systems to influence membrane elongation
  and expansion. Collectively, flavonoids may control tumor progression by manipulating
  autophagy.
