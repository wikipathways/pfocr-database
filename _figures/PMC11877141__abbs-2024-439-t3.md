caption: Chondrocyte pyroptosis pathways involved in pain onset in OAMany factors
  trigger, through the same or different pathways, the assembly of NLRP3 inflammatory
  vesicles and the subsequent activation of caspase-1 or caspase-11/4/5, which cleaves
  GSDMD proteins and pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, leading to the release of IL-1β and
  IL-18 from cells through the N-GSDMD-forming channels that are released from the
  cell. Inflammatory macrophage-derived exosomes promote chondrocyte pyroptosis by
  activating caspase-11/GSDMD signaling in chondrocytes. The NLRP3 gene encodes cryopyrin,
  an essential component of the inflammatory vesicle, which binds to the cysteine
  asparaginase recruitment domain structural domain of ASC and induces pro-caspase-1
  recruitment. IL-1β binds to IL-1R through the PI3K/Akt pathway, triggering the assembly
  of NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles. ROS further accelerate pyroptosis through the inhibition
  of Nrf2/HO-1. H2O2 induces USP7-dependent deubiquitylation of NLRP3 through the
  induction of USP7-dependent deubiquitylation of NLRP3 and the activation of NOX4/HO-1,
  a DNA-binding component of NLRP3 that is able to bind to DNA. DNA-binding NOX4/ROS/NF-κB
  signaling increases the protein levels of NLRP3 and pro-caspase-1. The USP7 inhibitor
  P22077 attenuates H2O2-induced damage to chondrocytes and death through the inhibition
  of the NOX4/NLRP3 signaling pathway
