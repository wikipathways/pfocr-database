caption: At the genetic level, treatment of mouse skin with DMBA induces mutations
  in Hras resulting in initiated cells that express constitutively active Ras protein
  (grey rectangles). TPA treatment is required for clonal expansion of these Hras
  mutant cells to form papillomas. Frequent duplication of the mutant Ras allele in
  papillomas indicates increased Ras signaling is favored. Mutation of p53, as well
  as additional Ras gene amplification, is seen in carcinomas, particularly in the
  most aggressive tumors (black rectangles). At the signaling level, mutant Ras upregulates
  p19Arf (Arf), which in turn activates p53. p19Arf, in turn, inhibits growth of Hras-driven
  tumors in a p53-independent manner. p19Arf, acting through p53, also inhibits malignant
  progression and metastasis. As Ras signals through p19Arf and p53, selection for
  subsequent mutations in p19 Arf or p53 is a direct consequence of the initial Ras
  mutation. In this model, Ras drives tumor progression through direct signaling effects
  and by dictating the evolution pathway of the tumor.
