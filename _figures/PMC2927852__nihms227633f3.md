caption: Shown are mechanisms that involve mitochondrial function, oxidative stress,
  autophagy, protein homeostasis, TOR signalling, insulin/IGF-1 signalling (IIS),
  caloric restriction (CR) and sirtuins. Modest concentrations of ROS generated by
  mitochondria during normal metabolism may induce stress-resistance pathways that
  scavenge ROS and repair damage. However, progressive mitochondrial damage may lead
  to pathological concentrations of ROS production, which, in turn, may contribute
  to further mitochondrial damage. Damaged mitochondria can be cleared by autophagy,
  which is promoted by CR and inhibited by TOR signalling. CR improves overall mitochondrial
  function, in part, by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and reducing ROS production
  (). ROS can damage other crucial macromolecules, such as DNA and proteins. Unrepaired
  DNA damage may give rise to epigenetic changes and gene silencing and may exacerbate
  mitochondrial impairment by reducing the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
  genes. ROS can also modify proteins, leading to protein unfolding and aggregation.
  Modified proteins can be removed by a number of degradative pathways, including
  the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Inadequate clearance may lead to the accumulation
  of toxic protein aggregates. The dynamics of protein clearance and aggregate formation
  may be modulated by the IIS pathway and by SIRT1 and CR. The accumulation of damaged
  and toxic proteins may also be modified through the regulation of messenger RNA
  translation by TOR signalling and CR.
