caption: Acute and chronic effects of plasma Ang II, aldosterone and EO on brain angiotensinergic
  pathways. Circulating Ang II, aldosterone or EO can activate Ang II/AT1R/ROS signaling
  in circumventricular organs such as the SFO and OVLT, which are located outside
  of the BBB, followed by activation of angiotensinergic projections to the PVN, SON
  and RVLM (red lines). Prolonged stimulation of AT1R/MR in the SFO also activates
  a slow neuromodulatory pathway in the hypothalamus (box at upper right) that involves
  locally produced aldosterone, which binds MR in, for example, SON and PVN and, via
  ENaC increases hypothalamic EO. Ouabain or EO acutely inhibits α2 Na+ pumps and,
  chronically, also activates an α2 Na+ pump-associated protein kinase cascade that
  increases the expression of ACE, AT1R and NADPH oxidase subunits. As a consequence,
  chronic Ang II/AT1R/ROS signaling is maintained/enhanced. Effective sympathetic
  tone is increased by enhanced secretion of EO (see  and ). See text for references.
