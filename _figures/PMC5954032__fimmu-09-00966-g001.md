caption: 'The PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K pathway plays a major role in the control of immune
  cell homeostasis. Class IA PI3Ks are heterodimeric molecules composed of a p110
  catalytic subunit (p110α, p110β, or p110δ) and a p85 regulatory subunit. In immune
  cells, class IA PI3Ks can be activated via multiple surface tyrosine kinase-associated
  receptors [e.g., BCR, TCR, TLR, CD19, ICOS, PD-1, and CTLA-4] that bear YXXM motifs
  in their cytoplasmic domain. In the absence of ligand binding, the TSC1/TSC2 complex
  negatively regulates mTORC1, and therefore protein synthesis, by converting RHEB
  into its inactive GDP-bound state. After receptor activation, phosphorylated YXXM
  motifs provide binding sites for the p85 regulatory subunit that brings the p110
  catalytic subunit to the membrane, where it converts PIP2 to PIP3. PIP3 serves as
  plasma membrane docking sites for PH-domain containing proteins, such as AKT, and
  its upstream activator PDK1. The activity of AKT is also positively regulated by
  mTORC2. Once phosphorylated, AKT inhibits the TSC1/TSC2 complex, and allows the
  release of GTP-bound RHEB, thereby enabling mTORC1 activation. Activated mTORC1
  triggers biosynthetic pathways (protein synthesis) essential for cell proliferation,
  survival, and metabolism through S6Ks and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, while inhibiting
  ULK1, and therefore autophagy. S6K phosphorylate numerous substrate, including ribosomal
  protein S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4B, and eukaryotic elongation
  factor 2 (eEF2) kinase. The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 prevents its binding to the
  cap-binding protein eIF4E, allowing it to participate in the formation of the eIF4F
  complex, which is composed of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A, the cap-binding protein
  eIF4E, and the large “scaffold” protein eIF4G, and which is required for the initiation
  of cap-dependent translation. PTEN is a negative regulator of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K
  signaling pathway that dephosphorylates PIP3 back to PIP2. Red circles: phosphorylation;
  normal arrows: activation; blunt arrows: inhibition.'
