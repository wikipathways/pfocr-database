caption: Interferences of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) with
  inflammatory signalling pathways. PPARγ inhibits nuclear factor κB (NFκB) signalling
  pathway through interactions with NFκB, the inhibitory protein called IκB, and CBP,
  a coactivator of p65. The MAPK pathway is also regulated by PPARγ, which reduces
  JNK and p38 activation and inhibits the transcription factors c‐jun, c‐fos, and
  nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT). Regulation of these main signalling pathways
  results in inhibition of cytokine and chemokine production, cell proliferation,
  and adhesion molecule expression (mainly VCAM‐1), which decrease inflammatory cell
  recruitment in inflamed tissues. 15dPGJ2, 15‐deoxy‐Δ12,14‐prostaglandin J2; PUFAs,
  polyunsaturated fatty acids; 5‐ASA, 5‐aminosalicylic acid.
