caption: Missing enzymatic activities in the Park nucleotide biosynthesis pathway
  in pathogenic Chlamydia species. (a) Muramyl pentapeptide biosynthesis pathway in
  E. coli. Peptide synthesis is nonribosomal and instead carried out by a series of
  amino acid ligases (MurC, -D, -E, and -F) that serially add amino acids to newly
  forming peptide chains. Enzyme homologues not present in the C. trachomatis genome
  are also indicated (?). M, N-acetylmuramic acid. (b) Glutamate racemase versus DAP
  epimerase enzymatic reactions. Stereoisomers of glutamic acid and DAP. l,l-DAP,
  and d,l-m-DAP possess two amine groups, thus creating two centers of asymmetry,
  whereas l- and d-glutamic acids contain only a single center of asymmetry.
