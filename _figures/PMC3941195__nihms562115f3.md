caption: (Retro)Transposable Element (TE) silencing pathways. (A) Canonical TE silencing
  pathway; piRNAs are transcribed from genomic loci termed piRNA clusters. Cleavage
  of these single strand transcripts by Zucchini (Zuc) generates an initial pool of
  primary piRNAs, which are loaded into Piwi. Secondary piRNAs are generated in a
  slicer-dependent amplification loop. Transposon transcripts are cleaved through
  this amplification cycle, accomplishing the silencing of cytoplasmic TEs. Piwi associated
  with piRNAs translocates to the nucleus and drives nuclear silencing. Adapted from
  [] and []). (B) Hypothetical non-canonical TE silencing pathway in trematodes and
  cestodes. Long, single stranded RNA precursors [] and/or long double stranded precursors
  are cleaved by an unknown enzyme and/or Dicer, respectively. Small non-coding RNA,
  that is, endo-siRNA-like molecules interacting with Argonaute 2 (Ago 2), which belongs
  to group 4 of Argonaute proteins in parasitic flatworms, constitute the RNA induced
  silencing complex (RISC) [] that would drive transcriptional gene silencing (TGS)
  and/or post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of TEs.
