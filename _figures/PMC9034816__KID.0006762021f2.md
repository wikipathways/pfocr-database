caption: Overview of normal K+ homeostasis. Absorption of K+ from the gastrointestinal
  tract is faster than kidney excretion, necessitating a shift of K+ into the cell
  to guard against pathologic rises in extracellular K+ concentration. Insulin, catecholamines,
  and aldosterone all act to shift K+ into the intracellular space through effects
  that increase the activity of the Na+-K+-ATPase pump. Kidney K+ excretion eventually
  matches dietary intake such that total body K+ content is maintained within a narrow
  range. A brief summary of kidney K+ handling is depicted. There is evidence that
  kidney K+ excretion is initiated through a gastric-kidney signaling pathway as early
  as entry of dietary K+ into the stomach. Approximately 10% of dietary K+ is excreted
  in the colon. This component of K+ handling increases as CKD progresses. PT, proximal
  tubule; TAL, thick ascending limb.
