caption: Role of TRPML1 in the regulation of ERK signaling in cells harboring HRASG12V
  mutations. HRAS–ERK signaling involves the assembly of HRAS monomers into nanodomains
  that can recruit RAF, and promote MEK and ERK phosphorylation (left). HRASG12V nanoclusters
  formation and plasma membrane localization are predicated upon the availability
  of cholesterol. When plasma membrane cholesterol is depleted or lowered (right),
  HRASG12V monomers cannot recruit RAF, leading to diminished ERK phosphorylation.
  Cancer cells harboring oncogenic HRAS showed an increased level of MiTF/TFE transcriptional
  factors and activation of the CLEAR gene network that leads to the lysosomal biogenesis
  (left). The elevated level of TRPML1 results in increased lysosomal Ca2+ release,
  HRASG12V nanoclusters in the plasma membrane, activation of MAPK pathway, and cell
  proliferation.
