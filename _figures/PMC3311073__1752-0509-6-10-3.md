  the hyperarcs R3, R4; B) Scheme of resolution of the enumeration problem for biosynthesis

  scheme corresponds to a call to FindPath and contains the constraint sets Rf and
  Rn (see left bottom box), and the minimal hyperpath  corresponding to the given
  constraints. FindPath iteratively calls itself, the structure obtained is a rooted
  tree where each node represents a call to FindPath, and each call is characterized
  by the sets Rf and Rn. In particular there are no constraints on the pathway searched
  at the root node, corresponding to the first call to FindPath, this fact is expressed
  by having empty Rf and Rn. The hyperpath found is R1, R2, R4, R7. For each reaction
  in the hyperpath, a new call to FindPath is done, this time with the constraints
  induced by the hyperpath solution of the parent node. Processes that do not return
  hyperpaths  are not followed by calls to children processes, while the processes
  that return one hyperpath  have unconstrained reactions  and are followed by as
  many children processes as unconstrained reactions. The children processes have
  as set of reactions that cannot belong to the returned pathway Rn'' the same as
  the father augmented by one reaction from the unconstrained set of the hyperpath  returned
  by the father process, while the set of reactions required to belong to the pathway

  contains two reactions not in Rf : R5 and R9 so its two children processes have
  Rn given by R4 ∪ R5 and R4 ∪ R9 and Rf is given by the one of the father: {R1, R2}
