caption: Lipid changes in mouse liver determined by LipidMatch Flow indicative of
  steatosis, oxidative damage, and inflammation in ethanol‐fed mice. PC is hydrolyzed
  by three phospholipase enzymes (D, C, and A2) at the plasma membrane. Phospholipase
  D results in the synthesis of phosphatidic acid and choline; phospholipase C results
  in DG and phosphatidylcholine head group, which is used in SM synthesis; and phospholipase
  A2 forms LPC and fatty acids. DG and LPC are involved in intracellular cellular
  signaling. DG can undergo acylation to form TG (leading to steatosis). TG undergoes
  further oxidation by ROS to form OxTG. C20 and C22 fatty acids are released from
  various sources, such as DGs, sphingolipids, and PEs. They can undergo oxidation,
  forming oxylipins and aldehydes. Oxylipins, such as eicosanoids, are then used in
  cellular signaling, such as in the inflammatory pathway. Aldehydes can cause cellular
  damage or undergo further reaction, such as carbonylation to form signaling molecules
  or dehydrogenation to form acetate.
