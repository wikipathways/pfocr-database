caption: 'Proteins and interactions from HPRD (small fonts) that are connected to
  the canonical pathway model are: (left) integrated directly into the signaling pathway
  image with one protein selected and its interactions highlighted; (right) structured
  around a user-constructed model; different classes of proteins have different appearances:
  experimental proteins are colored yellow, kinases are drawn as hexagons and receptors
  as irregular stars; several experimental proteins are not known to be connected
  to the pathway and are therefore located in the lower right corner. HPRD proteins
  are placed in a structured manner between the pathway proteins based on their separation
  from the pathway proteins. (cutout) Disadvantage of simply drawing the network on
  top of the pathway image: HPRD interactions obscure elements of the canonical pathway;
  compare to the improved method (left) in which important pathway elements remain
  in the foreground.'
