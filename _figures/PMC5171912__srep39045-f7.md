caption: Metabolic pathway networks of significant different metabolites in response
  to Asian ginseng (a) and American ginseng (b). The level of metabolites compared
  to that of control group is marked in red (up-regulated) and green (down-regulated),
  respectively. The black color represents the undetected metabolites. The words in
  blue besides the pane indicate the related pathways.
