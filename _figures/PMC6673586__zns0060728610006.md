caption: Hypothetical pathway by which isoflurane induces a vicious cycle of apoptosis
  and Aβ generation and aggregation. Isoflurane induces caspase-3 activation/apoptosis.
  Caspase activation, in turn, increases the activities of both BACE and γ-secretase,
  which serve to increase Aβ generation/accumulation. Isoflurane also enhances Aβ
  aggregation, which further induces caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Elevated
  Aβ generation/accumulation and Aβ aggregation then further induce apoptosis, leading
  to a vicious cycle of isoflurane-induced apoptosis and Aβ generation/accumulation
  and aggregation.
