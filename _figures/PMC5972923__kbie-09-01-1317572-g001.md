caption: Development of engineered cyanobacteria through metabolic rewiring to construct
  solar-to-chemical and solar-to-fuel platforms. The rewiring of the heterologous
  phosphoketolase pathway to the pentose phosphate pathway in cyanobacteria has enhanced
  the levels of the acetyl-coA pool, resulting in an increased production of acetone,
  n-butanol, and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) from CO2. The phosphoketolase pathway
  is shown in the green box and the heterologous chemical-producing pathways are shown
  in red boxes. The carbon flux of CO2 is indicated by the blue arrow, and the carbon
  backbone that originated from CO2 is also shown in blue. XpkA/Xfpk, phosphoketolase;
  AckA, acetate kinase; Pta, phosphotransacetylase; Pdc (Zm), Pyruvate decarboxylase
  of Zymomonas mobilis; Adh (Zm), Aldehyde dehydrogenase of Z. mobilis.
