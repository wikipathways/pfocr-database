caption: Redox regulation of primary nitrate assimilation in diatoms. (A and B) P.
  tricornutum cells under steady-state or oxidative stress conditions were supplied
  with 15N-nitrate and the enrichment of 15N in glutamine (labeled in amide and amino
  groups) (A) and glutamate (B) was detected by LC-MS. Data are presented as mean
  ± SD; n = 3. (C) Proposed model for redox regulation of nitrogen assimilation in
  diatoms. Nitrogen assimilation enzymes use the reducing power (Fdx; NADPH) generated
  in the chloroplast to assimilate nitrate to glutamate. This pathway can serve as
  a sink for excess electrons produced under highly reducing conditions. The activity
  of these enzymes is redox-regulated by ROS level modifying reactive thiols and Grx/Trx
  activities. The redox regulation of nitrogen assimilation enzymes can act as a feedback
  mechanism in which the chloroplast redox state is constantly monitored by nitrogen
  assimilation enzymes, thereby ensuring proper adjustment of the assimilation process
  and redox metabolism.
