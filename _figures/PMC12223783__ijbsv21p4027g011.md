caption: 'Exogenous spermidine inhibits trastuzumab-induced cardiomyocyte pyroptosis
  Schematic illustration of trastuzumab-induced cardiomyocyte pyroptosis, and exogenous
  spermidine blocking the action of trastuzumab by promoting mitochondrial biosynthesis.
  Trastuzumab binds to the HER2 receptor on the cell membrane and induces cleavage
  of the GSDMD, which in turn causes cardiomyocyte pyroptosis. Exogenous spermidine
  promotes the expression of PGC-1α in the nucleus, promotes the expression of mitochondrial
  biosynthesis pathway proteins, inhibits mitochondrial oxidative stress, promotes
  the function of mitochondria, and inhibits cellular pyroptosis, in which SIRT3 plays
  an important role. PGC-1α: peroxisome proliIerators-activated receptor γ coactivator
  lα; ERRα: estrogen receptor related receptor α; NRFs: nuclar respiratory factors;
  TFAM: mitochondrial transcription factor A; COXI-V: cytochrome c oxidase subunit
  I-V; GSDMD: gasdermin D; HER2: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2'
