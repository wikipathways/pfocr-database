caption: A scheme presenting the major proteins of the DNA damage response (DDR) signaling
  pathway and the miRNAs that interact with them. Following the induction of DNA double-strand
  breaks (DSBs) by irradiation, the reaction initiates protein components, such as
  sensors (MRN/H2AX), transducers (ATM/BRCA1/checkpoint protein 2 (Chk2)) and the
  effector protein (p53) in order to achieve a cellular response. Multiple miRNAs
  play a crucial role in the suppression of these DDR proteins in irradiated cancer
  cells, and some of these proteins may activate miRNAs, leading to a specific cellular
  response (see the main text for more details).
