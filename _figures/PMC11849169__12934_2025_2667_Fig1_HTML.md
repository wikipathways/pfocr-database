caption: Pathway for triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae. Cytosolic
  acetyl-CoA, produced via glycolysis and the PDH bypass, is converted to isopentenyl
  diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) through the MVA pathway.
  These intermediates then proceed through the sterol biosynthesis pathway, where
  after the production of 2,3-oxidosqualene (OSQ), they are diverted into the triterpenoid
  biosynthetic branch, leading to the synthesis of triterpenoid saponins. HXT, Hexose
