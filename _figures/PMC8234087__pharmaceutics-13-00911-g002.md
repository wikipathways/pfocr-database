caption: Oncogenic pathways upstream and downstream of aberrant choline metabolism
  discovered in B cell malignancies. Pathway schematics depict the anabolic and catabolic
  pathways of PC. Enzymes are denoted in Italic font in the schematics. Metabolites,
  lipids and metabolic enzymes that are dysregulated in malignant B cells are indicated
  in red (for up-regulated) or blue (for down-regulated). Available evidence shows
  that overexpression of two key enzymes, CHKα and PCYT1A (also known as CCT), are
  overexpressed in malignant B cells and mediate increased PC biosynthesis. Loss of
  the tumor suppressor TRAF3 and elevation of the oncoprotein MYC are common oncogenic
  alterations that induce the overexpression of CHKα and PCYT1A in B cell malignancies,
  respectively. In addition, BAFF or CD40 stimulation induces the expression of CHKα,
  while TLR4 or BCR engagement induces the expression of PCYT1A in normal B lymphocytes.
  Expression of both CHKα and PCYT1A is also induced by the KDAC inhibitor panobinostat
  in DLBCL cells. Several catabolic products of PC such as DAG, PA, LPC and arachidonic
  acid (a fatty acid) can act as lipid second messengers to induce the activation
  of downstream signaling pathways. Specifically, PA has been shown to activate the
  PI3K-AKT pathway in DLBCL. Therapeutic targeting of CHKα by pharmacological inhibitors
  (TCD-717, MN58B, CK37 or EB-3D) or PCYT1A by the lipid-lowering alkaloid BBR induces
  apoptosis and necroptosis of malignant B cells both in vitro and in vivo, indicating
  a causal role for CHKα or PCYT1A overexpression in B lymphomagenesis.
