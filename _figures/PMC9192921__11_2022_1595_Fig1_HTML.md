caption: The autophagy pathway. mTOR is the fulcrum for autophagic initiation, inhibiting
  autophagy during cellular metabolic satiety. [] Inhibition of mTOR triggers autophagy.
  The activated ULK complex translocates from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), initiating phagophore formation. [] The PI3K complex is recruited to the ER
  and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) is generated. [] PI3P-binding proteins
  (WIPI1, WIPI2, DFCP1, and Alfy) are recruited to nucleation sites, expanding the
  phagophore. [, ] Phagophore maturation requires two ubiquitin-like conjugation complexes,
  ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 and MAP1LC3 A/B/C-GABARAPs, to form the autophagosome. [] Specific
  cargo, such as virulence factors, adhere to the luminal LC3. On completion, the
  ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex dissociates from the autophagosome, and this autophagosome
  fuses with the lysosome to form the autolysosome. [, ] The contents are then degraded
  through lysosomal hydrolases. [] mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; LC3, microtubule-associated
  protein light chain 3; ULK, Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase; ULK complex—made
  of ULK1/2, ATG13, FIP200, and ATG101
