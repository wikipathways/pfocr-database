caption: Synthetic lethal interactions of AURKA with the SNF5 and ARID1A tumor suppressors
  involve SWI/SNF-mediated transcriptional repression of AURKA. Loss of SNF5 or ARID1A
  derepresses AURKA transcription, and the elevated AURKA level in rhabdoid tumor
  (RT) or colorectal cancer (CRC) cells leads to AURKA oncogene addiction. AURKA-addicted
  RT and CRC cells are highly sensitive to agents targeting AURKA signaling. The synthetic
  lethal interactions of AURKA with the SMARCA4 and RB1 tumor suppressors involve
  cellular AURKA dependency. SMARCA4 is likely to play an essential role in centrosome-dependent
  spindle assembly, while it negatively regulates the centrosome-independent pathway.
  AURKA is essential in both pathways for spindle assembly. Loss of SMARCA4 drives
  cells to rely on the centrosome-independent pathway, which creates a cellular dependency
  on the function of AURKA in spindle assembly. Loss of RB1 primes spindle assembly
  checkpoint (SAC) activation in cells via E2F-mediated upregulation of the SAC protein
  MAD2 and microtubule destabilizer STMN1. Active AURKA in RB1-deficient cells mitigates
  STMN1-induced microtubule destabilization or overrides SAC activation for cell survival.
