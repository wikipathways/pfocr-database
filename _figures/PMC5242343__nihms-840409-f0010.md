caption: Multifunctionality of Man-HA-MnO2 NPsaaMnO2 particles (~15 nm) are entrapped
  in hyaluronic acid (HA) with mannan molecules attached. When Man-HA-MnO2 NPs are
  recognized and uptaken by mannose receptor of TAMs, hyaluronic acid (HA) reprograms
  anti-inflammatory, pro-tumoral M2 TAMs to pro-inflammatory, antitumor M1 macrophages,
  which might be via a TLR2-MyD88-IRAK1-TRAF6-PKCζ-NK-κB-dependent pathway. The reprogrammed
  M1 macrophages secrete high level of IL-12, IFN-γ and H2O2. The high reactivity
  of MnO2 NPs toward H2O2 allows for the simultaneous production of O2 and Mn2+ ions
  and regulation of pH of tumor hypoxia. Once MnO2 NPs are reduced into Mn2+ ions,
  they exhibit strong enhancement in both T1- and T2-weighted MRI.
