caption: Chemotherapeutics induces Chk1-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest to downregulate
  induction of apoptosis. Inhibition of BCR/ABL, FLT3-ITD, or Jak2-V617F by imatinib,
  sorafenib, of JakI-1, respectively, as well as inhibition of PI3K or Akt by GDC-0941
  or MK-2206, respectively, drastically enhances apoptosis in hematopoietic cells
  treated with chemotherapeutics. The enhancing effect, prevented by inhibition of
  GSK3 by SB216763, may be at least partly due to the inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway
  leading to activation of GSK3, which may prevent Chk1-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest
  by chemotherapeutics. Inhibition of Chk1 by its inhibitor SB218078 also prominently
  enhances apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutics.
