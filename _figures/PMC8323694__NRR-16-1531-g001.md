caption: This figure shows the process of microglia accumulation and activation under
  subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) conditions.The accumulation of microglia and polarization
  of M1 microglia responses rapidly in the early injury stage of SAH. Then the cytokines
  and inflammatory factors interact with microglia, caused neuronal inflammation and
  other brain cell function changes even cell death. M2 microglia emerge in the delayed
  phase of SAH and act as neuroprotection function. The polarization between M1 and
  M2 can be modulated through a specific signaling pathway.
