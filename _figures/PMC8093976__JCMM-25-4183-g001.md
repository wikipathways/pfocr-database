caption: 'The roles of PLXND1 signalling during atherosclerosis and ischaemic stroke
  development. SEMA3E‐PLXND1 suppresses vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation
  and migration via the inactivation of the Rap1‐AKT signalling pathways; SEMA3E‐PLXND1
  signalling inhibits the directional migration of macrophages by disrupting the Rho
  GTPase signalling cascade; PLXND1 is a direct force sensor during atherosclerosis;
  Ischaemic stroke: SEMA3E‐PLXND1 signalling inhibits the recruitment of pericytes
  by reducing platelet‐derived growth factor‐BB (PDGF‐BB) production in endothelial
  cells (ECs) after ischaemia; upon SEMA3E binding, Tuba dissociates from PLXND1 and
  increases RhoJ activity resulting in F‐actin disassembly and focal adhesion reduction;
  SEMA3E‐PLXND1 signalling inhibits DLL4 expression by inactivating the Rac1‐JNK signalling
  pathway under oxygen‐glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGDR) conditions'
