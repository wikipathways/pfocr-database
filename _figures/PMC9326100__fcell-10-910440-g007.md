caption: Schematic of DSB repair pathway choice for high-LET induced damage in the
  context of chromatin. In the repair of simple euchromatic DSBs NHEJ functions as
  the predominant repair pathway, with a portion of repair carried out by Artemis
  mediated NHEJ (G0/G1) or HR (S/G2). Initiation of NHEJ at sites of clustered damage
  is attempted, but due to the presence of short fragments which inhibit activation
  of DNA-PKcs, pathway choice shifts to resection mediated pathways. Hence, alternative,
  more error prone pathways are considered the major repair mechanism for high-LET
  induced clustered DSBs, but a more detailed mechanism for pathway choice in a chromatin
  context is still uncertain. Bolded arrows denote the ‘preferred’ pathway for repair.
  Detailed pathway schematics can be found in .
