caption: Biochemical pathway of cannabinoid synthesis in C. sativa. CBGA, the central
  intermediate of the cannabinoid pathway, is formed from GPP and OA. Subsequently
  CBGA is further converted to the acidic forms of THC and CBD by two different oxidoreductases
  THCAS and CBDAS. Additionally, highly abundant monoterpenes and fatty acids from
  the essential oil of glandular trichomes are shown [, ]
