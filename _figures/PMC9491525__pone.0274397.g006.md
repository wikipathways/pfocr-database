caption: 'The recognition of the intracellular environment-associated cues by BvrS
  induces its autophosphorylation and consequently BvrR phosphorylation. As a result,
  BvrR-P increases its affinity for nucleotide regions similar to the consensus sequence,
  including its operon and regions encoding crossroad enzymes crucial for metabolic
  pathways required for intracellular trafficking. Genes according to the number of
  binding sites to BvrR-P found by ChIP-Seq are shown. Gene names with one binding
  site are in black, two binding sites: blue, three binding sites: green, four binding
  sites: orange, and five binding sites: red. Blue arrows indicate part of the energy
  metabolism, mainly the pentose phosphate cycle, erythritol metabolism, and Entner–Doudoroff
  pathway. The connection between the TCA cycle and nitrogen metabolism is represented
  with pink arrows. Light blue arrows represent VjbR targets. The green plus sign
  indicates positive regulation exerted by BvrR/BvrS. Pointed arrows indicate pathways
  partially represented.'
