caption: 'Model of amino acid degradation in I. scapularis. The main enzymes involved
  in tyrosine, cysteine, glycine, alanine, glycine, glutamate, glutamine, arginine,
  lysine, tryptophan, histidine, threonine, proline, leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Iso)
  and valine (Val) degradation and identified in the genome of I. scapularis (Table
  ) are shown. The interplay between amino acid and glucose metabolism (i.e., glycolysis
  and TCA cycle) intermediates is also shown. The names of the enzymes were abbreviated
  as follow: tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD),
  homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD), maleylacetoacetate isomerase (GSTZ1), fumarylacetoacetate
  hydrolase (FAH), α-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS), histidine ammonia-lyase
  (HAL), urocanate hydratase 1 (UROC1), imidazolone propionase (AMDHD1), formiminotransferase
  cyclodeaminase (FTCD), tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), kynurenine formamidase
  (AFMID), kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), kynurenine-oxoglutarate transaminase
  3 (KYAT3), kynureninase (KYNU), 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), branched-chain
  amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT), isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD), short/branched-chain
  acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD), isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD), cysteine dioxygenase
  1 (CDO1), GOT2 aspartate aminotransferase (GOT2), cysteine desulfurase (NFS1), alanine
  transaminase (ALT), sulfite oxidase (SUOX), glycine cleavage complex (GCC) which
  includes four enzymes: aminomethyltransferase (AMT), glycine dehydrogenase (GLDC),
  dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) and glycine cleavage system H protein (GCSH),
  2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase (GCAT), threonine dehydrogenase (TDH),
  L-serine dehydratase/L-threonine deaminase (SDS), glutaminase (GLS), proline dehydrogenase
  (PRODH), delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH), ornithine aminotransferase
  (OAT), arginase (ARG), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and branched-chain α-ketoacid
  dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) which includes three enzymes (branched-chain α-keto
  acid decarboxylase, lipoamide acyltransferase and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase)
  no displayed in the figure (Table ). Citrulline is transformed in arginine by a
  “two-step reaction” including argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and argininosuccinate
  lyase (ASL) which are not displayed in the figure but are available in Table . The
  metabolic intermediates were abbreviated as follow: oxaloacetate (OAA), N5-N10-methylene
  tetrahydrofolate (NNmTHF), 5-formiminotetrahydrofolate (NfTHF) and tetrahydrofolate
  (THF). The VOMIT pathway (where V stands for valine, O for odd-chain fatty acids,
  M for methionine, I for isoleucine, and T for threonine) enzymes transform α-ketobutyrate
  and propionyl CoA into the TCA cycle intermediate succinyl-CoA. The VOMIT pathway
  enzymes (propionyl-CoA carboxylase beta chain, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase and methylmalonyl-CoA
  mutase) are not displayed in the figure but are available in Table . Glutamate γ-semialdehyde
  is the open-chain tautomer of Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate. The circular arrow symbol
  represents the nonenzymatic and reversible interconversion of Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  to glutamate γ-semialdehyde. The asterisk shows the position of a desulfurization
  reaction.'
