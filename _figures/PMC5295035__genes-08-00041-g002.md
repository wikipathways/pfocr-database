caption: Hypothesis of the mechanism by which cellular endogenous RNA edited by ADAR1
  silences cytosolic RNA sensing signaling pathway. In the condition of ADAR1 deficiency,
  endogenous dsRNA stimulates cytosolic RNA receptors to elicit innate immune response.
  RNA editing by ADAR1 changes the dsRNA structures by introducing mismatched I-U
  base pairs into the RNA transcript, which replace A-U pairs in perfect dsRNA. If
  editing is sufficient to nullify all immune active RNAs, the corresponding receptors
  remain unstimulated, as shown in box 1. If RNA editing efficiency is low, the edited
  dsRNA will need to be high capacity to inhibit the stimulation from the unedited
  immune active RNAs, as shown in box 2.
