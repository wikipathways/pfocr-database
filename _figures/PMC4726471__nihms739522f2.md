caption: MST1/2 kinases, in complex with the scaffolding protein SAV1, directly phosphorylate
  LATS1/2 and MOB1. Phosphorylated MOB1 binds to the auto-inhibitory regions of LATS1/2,
  which releases LATS1/2 from their inhibitory state and enables auto-phosphorylation
  on their activation loops. Together, the coordinated actions of MST1/2 and MOB fully
  activate LATS1/2. Active LATS1/2 then phosphorylate both YAP and TAZ. Phosphorylated
  YAP and TAZ are sequestered in the cytoplasm through binding to 14-3-3, where they
  are subsequently proteasomally degraded. Consequently, activation of the Hippo pathway
  prevents YAP and TAZ from entering the nucleus and activating the TEAD-family of
  transcription factors to initiate the transcription of genes important for cell
  growth and survival. In addition, active LATS2 binds to and inhibits MDM2, which
  is an E3 ubiquitin that targets p53 for proteasomal degradation. Thus, activation
  of LATS2 also indirectly increases p53 levels. Centrosome amplification is known
  to promote LATS1/2 activation in an MST1/2-independent manner; however, the mechanisms
  leading to LATS1/2 activation in this context remain to be determined.
