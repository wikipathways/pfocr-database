caption: Interaction between cGAS-STING signaling pathway and HBV infection. On the
  one hand, cGAS-STING signaling either produces IFN by activating downstream TLR3
  or further activates NF-κB signaling pathway to inhibit intrahepatic HBV replication.
  On the other hand, HBsAg, HBeAg, or HBV virions inhibit TLR-induced antiviral activity
  of hepatocytes by suppressing the activation of IRF-3 and NF-κB.
