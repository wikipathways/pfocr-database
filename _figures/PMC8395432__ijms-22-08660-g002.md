caption: Binding sites of PARP1 on promoter or downstream regions of different immune-regulatory
  genes. PARP1 binds to TMPRSS2, IFNβ, and JAK/STAT pathway genes either upstream
  or downstream to TSS. These PARP1 binding sites were reported by Lodhi et al. 2014
  [] and derived from their ChIP-seq data. Chromosome numbers and PARP1 binding locations
  are indicated in each figure. (A). PARP1 binds to about 7.7 kb upstream to TSS of
  TMPRSS2. (B). PARP1 binds just 182 bp downstream to TSS IFNβ promoter. (C). PARP1
  binding to STAT1 promoter in the upstream region at 279 bp; it is not known how
  PARP1 is involved in the transcription regulation of this gene. (D). There is a
  PARP1 binding site in the upstream region around 1.5 kb promoter of STAT2. (E).
  Using www.interferome.org, we generated transcription binding sites in the promoter
  region of TMPRSS2, which has been developed using interferome (www.interferome.org).
  The location of transcription factors on each of the genes from the region spanning
  −1500 bp to +500 bp from the start site. Each coloured box represents a specific
  transcription factor, the key for which is provided below the graphic. TRANSFAC*
  predicted a match between the transcription factor and its predicted binding [].
  (F). Induced enzymatic activity of PARP1 auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates, subsequently
  followed by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Virus internalization through ACE2 receptors and
  priming of viral S protein by residual TMPRSS2. TLR3/7 recognizes the PAMPs and
  induces the type I IFN pathway, which leads to the production of iNOS and, therefore,
  NO. Increase of NO creates ROS in cells, which causes DNA damage and a reason for
  PARP1 activation. Auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP1 moves away from the binding site,
  and it may increase the transcription of TMPRSS2, hence facilitating virus entry.
