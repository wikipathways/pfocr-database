caption: Model of the RhoGEF2 effector pathway required for cooperation with RasACT
  in tumorigenesis. Expression of RasACT (or RafGOF) alone promotes proliferation
  and blocks apoptosis, which contributes to the tumour growth. Our epistasis experiments
  show that RhoGEF2 acts via Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II activity in its cooperation with activated
  Ras signalling in tumorigenesis. Rho1, Rok and Myosin II are required downstream
  of RhoGEF2 for JNK activation. Activation of Rok (RokCAT) or Myosin II activity
  (SqhEE) only robustly promotes JNK activation in cooperation with RasACT. JNK promotes
  tumour invasion, and blocks differentiation and pupation, which contributes to the
  tumour growth during the extended larval stage. Myosin II activity has been documented
  by others to result in increased F-actin contractility and cell shape changes, but
  might also contribute to tumour growth in combination with RasACT.
