caption: 'Dopamine substrates that are commonly quantified in humans in vivo using
  PET/SPECT. A schematic representation of a dopaminergic synapse at an axon terminal
  in the striatum. The soma of the neuron projecting to the striatum is located in
  the midbrain. The last two steps of the dopamine synthesis pathway are depicted
  (blue): tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) converts tyrosine to L-DOPA, which is then converted
  to dopamine by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD). Dopamine is packed in
  vesicles for both tonic and phasic release. Phasic release (green) is triggered
  by action potentials and can be stimulated by a challenge such as amphetamine, food
  intake, or food stimuli. Dopamine transmits signals from the pre- to the postsynaptic
  neuron by binding to postsynaptic receptors (yellow) and activating a cascade of
  events in the postsynaptic neuron. D1, D2 and D3 receptors are depicted. Due to
  the nature of most radiotracers that target dopamine receptors, i.e., they compete
  for binding with endogenous dopamine, dopamine release is derived from contrasting
  binding of the tracer before and after a dopamine challenge. After release, dopamine
  is transported back into the presynaptic neuron by means of dopamine transporters
  (DAT, purple). For each domain, common radiotracers are listed on the right. [11C]-NMB:
