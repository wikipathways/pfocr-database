caption: Effect and regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome during fibrosis. Lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) and other compounds induces TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4)-dependent activation
  of nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB), resulting in NLRP3, pro-IL-1β and
  pro-IL-18 expression. For instance, alcohol consumption increases permeability of
  the intestine to bacterial endotoxin that in turn, elevates LPS levels during alcoholic
  liver disease. The increase in NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) levels promotes mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) that leads to inflammasome activation. Thioredoxin-interacting
  protein (TXNIP) modulates the biological structure of NLRP3 leading to NLRP3 inflammasome
  assembly. Additionally, NLRP3 may damage the function of mitochondrial and induce
  mitochondrial ROS production, ultimately promoting NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
  Increased NLRP3 also involved in the transforming growth factor (TGF-β)-mediated
  Smad2/3 phosphorylation. IL-1β and IL-18 secreted by the inflammasome can stimulate
  myofibroblasts to remain activated; with the excessive extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing
  capacity of these cells eventually contributing to fibrosis. The mature form of
  IL-1β and IL-18 reaches its receptor to promote the transcription of NF-κB and increase
  the expression of TGF-β1. The secreted TGF-β1 binds to its receptor, triggering
  the Smad-dependent pathway and promoting the progression of fibrosis.
