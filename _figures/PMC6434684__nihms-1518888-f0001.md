caption: The Sonic Hedgehog Pathway. A) In the absence of Shh ligand, PTCH1 suppresses
  SMO allowing for SUFU suppression of GLI1. B) In the presence of Shh ligand, PTCH1
  repression of SMO is removed allowing for SMO to repress SUFU leading to the release
  and nuclear translocation of GLI1. GLI1, and the other GLI proteins then promote
  a gene expression program that promotes multiple cancer phenotypes. The inhibitors
  to this pathway, the FDA-approved inhibitors highlighted in green, primarily have
  targeted SMO with some attempts to target Shh itself and the GLI proteins, but with
  little success.
