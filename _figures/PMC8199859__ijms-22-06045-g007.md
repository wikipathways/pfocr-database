caption: Proposed model for the activation of FAK, Src, and Abl kinases during infection
  with H. pylori. (A) Schematic overview of successive activation of host cell proteins,
  resulting in CagA phosphorylation. (B) H. pylori attaches to the membrane of AGS
  wt cells and injects CagA into the cytoplasm via its T4SS (step 1). CagA induces
  the activation of the serine kinase Erk in a phosphorylation-independent fashion
  (2). Erk phosphorylates cortactin at serine 405, allowing an interaction between
  cortactin and integrin-bound FAK through the SH3 domain of cortactin (3). The binding
  of cortactin to FAK induces autophosphorylation of FAK at tyrosine 397 (4). Src
  binds to FAK PY397 and becomes phosphorylated at tyrosine 418 by FAK, while also
  phosphorylating the remaining tyrosine phosphosites of FAK (5). Activated Src phosphorylates
  integrin-bound Abl at tyrosine 412 (6). Activated Src and Abl then phosphorylate
  CagA at its EPIYA-motifs (7 and 8). (C) H. pylori attaches to the membrane of an
  AGS∆cttn cell and injects CagA into the cytoplasm via T4SS (1), where it induces
  the activation of Erk in a phosphorylation-independent fashion (2). Due to the absence
  of cortactin, the signaling pathway, however, comes to a premature end after Erk
  activation (3), since cortactin cannot induce anymore the autophosphorylation of
  FAK (4). Thus, Src does not bind to FAK and therefore neither phosphorylates FAK’s
  remaining phosphosites nor becomes phosphorylated itself (5). As Src is still in
  its inactive form, it also fails to activate Abl (6), which therefore results in
  diminished phosphorylation of CagA (steps 7 and 8).
