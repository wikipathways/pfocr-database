caption: Key players in autophagosome formation. mTOR protein complex responds to
  the metabolic state of the cell via multiple signaling axes. Such signaling molecules
  sense changes in cellular homeostasis, and, by default, mTOR blocks induction of
  autophagy. However, increased cellular stress blocks mTOR signaling initiating the
  pathway, which, in addition to ATG1 kinase requires several other kinases such as
  PI3K III and VPS34. BECLIN1 is a scaffold protein inhibited by the oncogene BCL2
  that inhibits both autophagy and apoptosis initiation. Lipid molecules incorporated
  into phagophore membrane are not synthesized de-novo but originate in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). The elongation of autophagosomes is facilitated by formation of
  ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L protein complex and by LC3-II protein (indicated by green circles)
  which is lipidated and associated with the autophagosomal membranes. Proper autophagosomes
  processing also requires ubiquitin-like conjugating enzymes ATG3, ATG7 and ATG10
  and protease ATG4 which catalyzes LC3-I to LC3-II conversion. After the membrane
  enclosure, only ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 protein complex dissociates from the autophagosomes
  - LC3-II remains associated with autophagosomal membrane and is degraded in lysosomes
  together with other cytoplasmic molecules targeted for degradation. Various small
  molecules targeting distinct molecules are listed in red.
