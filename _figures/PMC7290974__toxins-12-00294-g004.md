caption: Altering host gene expression by disrupting transcriptional regulators. (A)
  The Lm effector internalin C (InlC) is produced and secreted when bacteria enter
  the host cytosol. InlC binds to IKKα and blocks IκB phosphorylation and degradation
  thereby inhibiting NF-κB nuclear translocation and the transcription of NF-κB-regulated
  gene. (B) Listeriolysin (LLO) blocks the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes in
  the Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway thereby inhibiting the activation
  of downstream transcription factors such as c-Jun. LLO also induces proteolysis
  of ubiquitin and Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E2-conjugating enzymes, causing
  a global decrease in ubiquitylated and SUMOlyated proteins, many of which, are transcription
  factors. The transcription regulator promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) also undergoes
  deSUMOlyation in response to LLO, causing it multimerize and induce anti-Listeria
  responses.
