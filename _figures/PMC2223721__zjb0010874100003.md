caption: 'Effect of nitrogen availability on expression of genes involved in carbon
  catabolism. Glycolysis, the pentose phosphate and Entner-Doudoroff pathways, and
  the glycerol uptake pathway are represented. Enzymes encoded by genes that are NtrC
  repressed are enclosed in boxes. Abbreviations: Zwf-1, glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase;
  Gap-1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase; GlpD, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  GlpF, glycerol uptake facilitator protein; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  FDP, fructose diphosphate; 6PGA, 6-phosphogluconate; KDPG, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate;
  GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; PPP-ED, pentose phosphate and Entner-Doudoroff
  pathways; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; CoA,
  coenzyme A; TCA, tricarboxylic acids.'
