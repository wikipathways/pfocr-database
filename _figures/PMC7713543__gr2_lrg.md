caption: SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Interaction with Host Cells(A) Simplified schematic
  of the viral replication cycle. The virus enters the cell through binding of the
  ACE2 receptor and is internalized. Inside of the cell, viral RNA is produced, and
  structural and non-structural proteins are translated. New virions are assembled
  and released from the cell, resulting in cell lysis.(B) Interferon pathway activation
  by SARS-CoV-2. Innate immune sensors recognize the virus, and transcription of interferon
  is turned on, leading to the production of interferon-stimulated genes. Stem-cell-derived
  models in which this has been detected are highlighted in the box.(C) Disruption
  of cellular processes by SARS-CoV-2 and cell death. Through the hijacking of host
  cell proteins and pathways, SARS-CoV-2 can disrupt the essential functions of cells.
  Stem-cell-derived models in which this has been detected are highlighted in the
  box.(D) Viral production. When cells are productively infected, SARS-CoV-2 virions
  are released at the end of the viral life cycle, causing cell lysis and death. Stem-cell-derived
  models in which this has been detected are highlighted in the box.
