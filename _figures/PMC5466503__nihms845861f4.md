caption: 'Melanocyte differentiation. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling
  pathway.(A) In the absence of UV radiation (left-hand side section), keratinocytes
  express TGF-β that blocks melanocyte differentiation via SMAD signaling, by repressing
  PAX3. In the presence of UV, the JNK/AP-1 pathway downregulates TGF-β (middle section).
  TGF-β is itself repressed in epidermal keratinocytes by p53 that promotes melanocyte
  differentiation., (B, C) Canonical WNT signaling pathway.(B) In the absence of WNT:
  Upper side in the melanocyte nucleus-the complex of PAX3-SOX10 can activate the
  expression of MITF. Lower side in the melanocytes nucleus-the transcriptional repressor
  complex PAX3-LEF1-groucho-related proteins (GRGs) represses DCT transcription.(C)
  In the presence of WNT: Upper side in the melanocyte nucleus-β-catenin is activated
  by WNT and, together with LEF1, upregulates expression of MITF. Lower side in the
  melanocyte nucleus-activated β-catenin also forms an activator complex on the DCT
  promoter with MITF and LEF1 and displaces the repressor complex containing PAX3.
  SOX10 can also synergistically activate DCT with MITF. Experimental evidence used
  for this figure was generated in human and mouse. Parts B and C of Figure 4 are
  based on and modified from []. Figure 4 was done by the medical illustrator Debbie
  Maizels.'
