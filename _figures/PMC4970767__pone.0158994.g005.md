caption: In the current model, CFTR plays a critical role in spermatogenesis through
  regulation of heat shock proteins and related pathways. We propose that CFTR mutations
  lead to an over-activated heat shock response, and reduced Grp78 and VDAC1 interactions
  to initiate the cascade leading to altered energy metabolism and ROS production.
  Furthermore, over-activated NF-κB activates the pro-inflammatory response and related
  interleukin increase. Finally, the key RNA binding protein MSY2 expression was significantly
  reduced, indicating that CFTR affect spermiogenesis through regulation of MSY2 expression.
