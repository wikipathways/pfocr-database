caption: Ingenuity Core Analyses/Comparison Analyses generated networks (top 2 shown).
  The top 2 derived networks (out of 14; network scores from 25 down to 1) using IPA-extracted
  pathway data are shown. Network scores are derived from a right-tailed Fisher’s
  exact test, where scores as p-score = −log10 (p values) indicate probabilities of
  random protein associations based on focus molecules in a total gene group. Focus
  molecules are nodes from which networks initiate. Higher cytokine scores are indicated
  by red shading and lower values by green shading, relative to their representation
  in stroke patients vs. healthy donors. Proteins clustered within the top networks/associated
  functions as derived from IPA algorithms are shown as members of “interactomes”.
  Proteins from the arrays are labeled in larger bold font, with the background color
  described above. Solid lines (edges) = direct connections between/among proteins;
  dashed lines = indirect interactions. Dark blue lines = connections between array
  proteins; light blue lines = known interactions between array proteins and other
  proteins in the interactome derived from the Ingenuity Knowledgebase. (A) Network
  1, “Cellular Movement; Hematological System Development & Function; Immune Cell
  Trafficking”. (B) Network 2, “Cell Signaling; Cell-Cell Signaling & Interaction;
  Cellular Growth & Proliferation”.
