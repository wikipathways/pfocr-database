caption: Gene expression patterns related to the biosynthesis of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes,
  and triterpenes. The names of enzymes in each catalytic stage are represented by
  abbreviations and italics in bold. Color scales indicate gene expression levels
  (Log10TPM) at different time stages of HRM stress. Each horizontal band represents
  a gene, and those with more than one homologous gene are ranked in Arabic order.
  Gene ID of this pathway all gene are listed .
