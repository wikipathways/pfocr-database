caption: Pervasive regulation of TLR signaling pathway by miR-146a/b family and miR-125a~99b~let-7e
  cluster. (A) During overt inflammation binding of LPS to TLR4 induces the expression
  of NF-κB pathway, that ultimately leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (including TNFα, IL-6, CCL3, and IL-12). NF-κB also positively regulates the expression
  of miR-146a, which operates a negative feedback control of the NF-κB-dependent inflammatory
  response by repressing TRAF-6 and IRAK1. (B) During the late phase of the inflammatory
  response, production of IL-10 induces the expression of miR-146b and miR-125a~99b~let-7e
  cluster, via STAT3 binding to their promoters, thus resulting into downregulation
  of multiple components of TLR signaling pathway.
