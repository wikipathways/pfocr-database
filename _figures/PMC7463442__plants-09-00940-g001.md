caption: Photoreceptors regulate cell growth through altered auxin synthesis, transport
  and signalling. ➀ Wavelength-specific activation of the photoreceptors UV Resistance
  Locus 8 (UVR8), cry, phyB and phyA triggers their nuclear accumulation []. PhyB
  activation by red light is reversed by far-red light and spontaneous conversion
  that is accelerated at high temperature [,,]. ➁ Active photoreceptors trigger Phytochrome
  Interacting Factor (PIF) phosphorylation, which leads to degradation for PIF4 and
  PIF5 and inactivation for PIF7 []. ➂ Free PIFs bind to promotors of YUCCAs, HFR1
  and many other target genes and stimulate their expression [,,,,,,,,]. HFR1, which
  is stabilised in UV-B via UVR8, inhibits DNA binding of PIFs []. ➃ Auxin synthesis
  mainly occurs in a two-step pathway [,,,,]. Trp is first converted to IPyA by TAA1
  and TARs [,,]. IPyA is next converted to active IAA auxin via YUCCA [,,]. Negative
  feedback on IPyA levels occurs through reversal to Trp via VAS1 and IPyA glucosylation
  by UGT76F1 [,]. IAA is also inactivated by conjugation to amino acids via GH3 proteins
  []. ➄ In the nucleus, IAA interacts with the TIR1/AFB receptors of the SCFTIR1/AFB
  receptor complex. Upon IAA binding, SCFTIR1/AFB ubiquitinates Auxin/Indole Acetic
  Acids (AUX/IAA) proteins, which leads to AUX/IAA degradation []. In the absence
  of IAA, AUX/IAAs inhibit auxin signalling by interacting with Auxin Response Factors
  (ARFs), preventing their DNA binding and transcriptional activity. ARF activity
  is further reduced by photoreceptor stabilisation of AUX/IAAs, and the formation
  of a transcriptionally inactive photoreceptor-AUX/IAA-ARF complex [,,]. PhyB inactivation
  in persistent shade enhances auxin signalling through reduced expression of the
  TIR1-targeting miR393 []. ➅ The transcriptional activity of ARFs is reinforced by
  the formation of a trans-activating transcription factor module together with BZR
  and PIF [,,]. BZR1, ARF and PIF are all inhibited by interaction with growth-repressive
  DELLA proteins, forming the BAP/D module []. DELLA repression is alleviated by GA-mediated
  DELLA degradation in persistent shade conditions. Besides DELLAs, various active
  photoreceptors have also been shown to inhibit the activity of BZR1, ARF and PIF
  [,,]. Active BZR1, ARF and PIF target many shared and unique target genes, including
  genes involved in auxin inactivation and transport, as well as gibberellin synthesis
  and cell growth [,]. ➆ Phot1 associates with NPH3 at the plasma membrane []. Phot1
  activation by unilateral blue light leads to phot1 autophosphorylation. This triggers
  NPH3 dephosphorylation and a loss of PIN3 from the outer endodermal plasma membrane
  on the illuminated side of the hypocotyl (for details see ) [,,]. ➇ Polar redistribution
  of PIN3 occurs in response to photoreceptor cues [,,]. Moreover, PIN3 can be phosphorylated
  by PID, D6PK and AGC1-12 kinases that are required for various photoreceptor-mediated
  growth responses [,,]. Polar localisation of PIN3 allows for directed auxin flow
  towards target tissues (for details see ). ➈ Auxin stimulates apoplast acidification
  through SAUR19-mediated activation of H+-ATPases [,,]. This enhances the activity
  of cell wall modifying enzymes and results in acid growth [,,,,]. This figure was
