caption: 'Hypothetical pathway for aceticlastic methanogenesis in M. maripaludis.
  As demonstrated, this scheme would require 2 cycles of Eha/Ehb in order to oxidize
  ferredoxin reduced by the CODH/ACS and Hdr reactions. By constraining the Eha/Ehb
  reaction to only 10% of methane efflux, this pathway becomes infeasible. Enzyme
  names are shown in blue. Metabolites: Fdrd, reduced ferredoxin; Fdox, oxidized ferredoxin;
  MFR, methanofuran; HSCoM, coenzyme M; HSCoB, coenzyme B. Enzymes: CODH/ACS, carbon
  monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase complex; Mtr, methyl-H4MPT coenzyme M
  methyltransferase; Mcr, methyl coenzyme M reductase; Hdr, heterodisulfide reductase;
  Eha/Ehb, energy-conserving hydrogenases; ATPS, ATP-synthase.'
