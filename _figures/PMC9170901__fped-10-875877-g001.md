caption: The three RBC antioxidant systems that are compromised in G6PD deficiency.
  The more familiar glutathione peroxidase/glutathione reductase (GPx/GR) and antioxidant
  mechanisms are shown in gray (middle) and the more recently recognized peroxiredoxin
  2 system in light blue (top). Prdx2 is a thiol protein that is oxidized to an interchain
  disulfide then recycled predominantly by thioredoxin (Trx) and thioredoxin reductase
  [TrxR; ()]. Prdx2, the third most abundant RBC protein, is present at a much higher
  concentration than glutathione peroxidase or catalase. It is highly reactive with
  peroxides and is favored to consume most of the intracellular H2O2 (). NADPH is
  required as a reducing substrate for both GR and TrxR, and it protects catalase
  against inactivation. It is produced via the pentose phosphate pathway of which
  the first step is catalyzed by G6PD. By restricting the supply of NADPH, G6PD deficiency
  compromises the ability of all three antioxidant systems to detoxify hydrogen peroxide.
  O2–, superoxide; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSG, glutathione
  disulfide; SOD, superoxide dismutase. The “red” and “ox” subscripts refer, respectively,
  to the reduced and oxidized forms of the proteins.
