caption: Insulin and insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS) is triggered by binding
  of the insulin receptor (InsR) or insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R)
  and activation of an adaptor protein, which can be one of three or four IRS proteins
  in mammals or the Chico protein in Drosophila fruit flies. The pathway then splits
  into two main branches. One activates the proteins PI3K and AKT to cause inhibition
  of the transcription factor FOXO, an activator of gene transcription. The other
  branch activates the protein RAS, which then triggers a cascade involving RAF, MEK
  and ERK to inhibit the transcription factor ETV6 (or its equivalent in flies, AOP),
  a repressor of gene transcription. Slack et al. show that, in Drosophila, mutating
  chico to disrupt either of these pathways, or inhibiting the RAS–ERK pathway by
  treating flies with the MEK inhibitor trametinib, leads to extended lifespan. Adapted
  from ref.  (CC BY 4.0).
