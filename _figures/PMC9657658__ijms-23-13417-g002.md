caption: 'VceC mediates IREα inflammatory responses and apoptosis in cells. ①②: VceC
  ectopic to rough ER through Brucella T4SS. RER is stimulated by VceC and causes
  ER stress to increase unfolded products, and prolonged stress leads to UPR, activation
  of ATF6, PERK and IREα metabolic pathways. ③④: VceC binds to the GRP78 chaperone
  at the ER to induce the IREα inflammatory pathway. ⑤–⑨: IREα is activated and recruits
  TRAF2 to the ER membrane and triggers NOD1/2 homo-oligomerization and activation.
  TRAF2 binds and k63-polyubiquitinates RIP2, both of which are involved in NOD1/2
  signaling to mediate the collection of TAK1, ultimately activating NF-κB, thus increasing
  the levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-6, IL-12p40, and causing the placental
  occurrence of inflammation. ⑩–⑫: VceC binding to GRP78 affecting the changes of
  the PERK pathway in host cells is still controversial. ER stress induces another
  important pathway, the PERK apoptosis pathway, which induces the expression of CHOP
  by gene Ddit3, which eventually leads to apoptosis.'
