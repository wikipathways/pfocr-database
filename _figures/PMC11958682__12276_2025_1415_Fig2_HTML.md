caption: a–d, The critical dependencies and alterations in amino acid (a–c) and FA
  metabolism within HCC cells (d). Glutamine is pivotal for nucleotide and amino acid
  production and antioxidant synthesis. In HCC, enhanced glutamine uptake is facilitated
  by upregulated transporters such as SLC38A1 and SLC1A5, while the conversion to
  α-ketoglutarate is suppressed due to downregulation of glutamate dehydrogenase 1
  and 2 (GLUD1 and 2), promoting glutaminolysis. Elevated levels of GS are associated
  with increased cell proliferation, highlighting its complex role in cancer progression
  (a). Serine is essential for nucleotide synthesis and maintaining redox balance,
  derived from external sources and metabolic pathways from glucose or glutamine.
  Increased activity of PHGDH boosts de novo serine synthesis in HCC (b). The urea
  cycle and arginine metabolism involve increased ammonia production and disruptions
  in metabolism leading to elevated nitrogen supply for biosynthesis. The downregulation
  of enzymes such as CPS1, ASS1, ARG1 and OTC results in abnormal ammonia metabolism,
  while dysregulated arginine metabolism promotes oncogenic activities (c). BCAAs
  undergo conversion to BCKAs, crucial for nucleotide biosynthesis and energy production
  via the TCA cycle and linked to FAO pathways. Fatty acid metabolism is characterized
  by increased de novo synthesis and altered FAO. Key enzymes such as ACLY, ACC, FASN,
  SCD1 and CPT1 are dysregulated, contributing to the metabolic reprogramming that
  supports tumor growth and progression (d). Proteins with increased levels in HCC
  are marked in red, while those decreased are shown in blue, providing a clear visual
  differentiation of metabolic changes in HCC
