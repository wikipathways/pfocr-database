caption: Schematic representation of (−)-epicatechin anticancer activity in MDA-MB-231
  and MCF-7 cells. The anticancer effect in MDA-MB-231 cells was possibly triggered
  through TRAIL receptor interaction (DR4/DR5) and its upregulation. This extrinsic
  pathway activation was enhanced through the intrinsic pathway, resulting in caspases-dependent
  apoptosis and enhanced by the modulating of inhibitors of apoptosis by Smac/Diablo
  and HtrA2/Omi (continuous arrow). In MCF-7 cells, an anticancer effect was evident
  through the interaction with another receptor, the modulation of cellular kinases,
  and the upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bad and Bax. This Bad and
  Bax upregulation induced the leak of cytochrome C, Smac/Diablo, and HtrA2/Omi into
  the cytoplasm, activating apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway. These mechanisms
  are tightly related to ROS generation (dashes arrow). (Arrows indicate activation,
  ⊥ indicates inhibition).
