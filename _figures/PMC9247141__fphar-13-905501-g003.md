caption: The pathway of p53 and Nrf2 in ferroptosis. The generation of ROS, lipid
  peroxidation and iron homeostasis are the indispensable course in triggering ferroptosis.
  Nrf2 and p53 participate in ferroptosis by influencing the expression of a series
  of downstream proteins. For example, Nrf2 promotes the expression of GPX4 and upregulates
  the expression or the function of solute carrier family seven member 11 (SLC7A11)
  to exert influence on lipid peroxidation. Nrf2 also activates NADPH oxidases (NOX),
  NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), aldosterone reductases
  (AKRS), which all contribute to the production of ROS, resulting in ferroptosis.
  GLS2 induced by p53 inhibit the depletion of ROS. P53 also promote the synthesis
  of Spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4
  (DPP4), which enhance the lipid peroxidation. P53 also regulates frataxin, ferredoxin
  one and 2 (Fdx1/Fdx2), iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme (ISCU), SAT1, the activation
  of those molecules contributes to iron homeostasis.
