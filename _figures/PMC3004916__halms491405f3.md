caption: 'In response to proliferative stimuli such as insulin, glucose and nutrients,
  the cyclin/cdk4 complex is activated and phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein
  pRB, which represses transcription when associated with E2F transcription factors.
  Activated E2F1 stimulates the expression of target genes implicated in cell cycle
  progression (blue circle). In addition, E2F1 triggers an adapted metabolic transcriptional
  response, depending on the cell type. In beta cells, E2F1 will stimulate the expression
  of Kir6.2, thus facilitating insulin secretion. In other cell types, such as muscle
  or cancer cells E2F1 facilitates glycolysis and represses, by still unknown mechanisms
  oxidative phosphorylation. This coordinated response is essential to sustain normal
  proliferation and development. It is conceivable that changes in this coordinated
  response might lead to abnormal metabolic changes during tumor development and cancer
  progression. Abbreviations: OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation.'
