caption: The multifunctional role and mechanism of IMφs in NEC pathogenesis. During
  intestinal inflammation of NEC, inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils are sequentially
  recruited to mount an immune response to the stimulations of environmental, dietary,
  and bacterial factors. (1) Immature intestinal development induces to the immature
  function of IMφs in preterm infants, including excessive inflammation response,
  immature intestinal motility and intestinal microvascular development. (2) The pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and regenerative signals released by IMφs affects the gap junction of
  IECs and repair function of intestinal epithelial barrier. (3) Alterations in gut
  microbiota makes the decreased engulfing of IMφs to them and reduced the differentiation
  of CD206+ M2 macrophage, leading to differentiation defect of stem cells. The metabolites
  of microbiota also regulate the inflammatory state of IMφs in NEC. (4) Red blood
  cell transfusion activates inflammation pathways in IMφs to expand inflammatory
  response of intestine.
