caption: Role of L-arginine in enhancing fetal growth and development in response
  to maternal undernutrition or overnutrition. Through the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-dependent
  synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) and production of polyamines from arginine-derived
  ornithine as well as activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) signaling
  pathway, L-arginine can promote embryogenesis and placental vascular growth. Antioxidants
  are essential to maintain sufficient levels of BH4 in cells for NO synthase (NOS).
  Enhancement of uteroplacental blood flow ensures adequate transport of nutrients
  and oxygen from mother to fetus to support fetal growth and development under the
  conditions of maternal malnutrition. ODC, ornithine decarboxylase.
