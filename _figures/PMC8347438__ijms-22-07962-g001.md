caption: Energy metabolism pathway in FH-deficient carcinoma. Fumarate hydratase (FH)
  is an enzyme that converts fumarate to malate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  in mitochondria. When FH malfunctions, fumarate and succinate accumulate, resulting
  in prolyl hydroxylate inhibition and consequent hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha
  (HIF-1α) stabilization. Accumulation of HIF-1α leads to the upregulation of vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). VEGF promotes
  angiogenesis, while GLUT1 promotes glucose uptake and contributes to the etiology
  of high-grade FH-deficient carcinoma. In cancer cells, oxidative phosphorylation
  is impaired, and aerobic glycolysis (known as the Warburg effect) becomes the primary
  energy production mechanism. As glycolysis progresses, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
  production increases, prompting cell proliferation. In FH-deficient carcinoma, the
  proliferation of highly malignant cancer cells depends on these mechanisms.
