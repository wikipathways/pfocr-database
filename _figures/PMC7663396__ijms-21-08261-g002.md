caption: Comparison of the consequences of excessive STAT3 activation in muscle and
  cancer cells. STAT3 hyperactivity in myocytes leads to an increase (marked with
  an up arrow) in caspase activity, leading to universal stress proteins’ (USP) involvement.
  In the area of muscle tissue, a decrease in myogenin and MyoD expression (marked
  with a down arrow), and a weakening of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mTOR
  signal pathway were observed, which induces the process of muscle cachexia. Neoplastic
  cells increase the level (marked with an up) of angiogenesis, metastasis, proliferation,
  and inhibition of apoptosis. In this case, these events lead to the progression
  of the neoplastic process. On the other hand, tumor cells secrete pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, including IL-6, which additionally stimulate the activation of STAT3
  (marked with +), intensifying pathological changes in skeletal muscles and stimulating
  tumor progression.
