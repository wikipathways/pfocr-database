caption: Examples of different pathways commonly implicated in the regulation of the
  SASP. The activation of these pathways converges in the activation of NF-κB, which
  is probably the most important pathway for the secretion of most of the inflammatory
  factors from the SASP. IL-1 inhibition with IL-1RA or neutralizing antibodies has
  shown to restrain the SASP by reducing NF-κB activation, highlighting the importance
  of IL-1/IL-1R1 signalling in this process. Green arrows mean stimulation, red inhibition.
