caption: Illustration of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle. The glutamate (Glu) released
  by a glutamatergic pre-synaptic terminal (left) is mainly taken up into astrocytes,
  although a small portion could flood back into the terminal through the transporter
  GLT-1b. In the GABAergic synapse (right), the released GABA is taken up into both
  the pre-synaptic terminal and the astrocytes, with the former having higher affinity
  for the neurotransmitter. Inside the astrocyte, GABA is catabolized to succinate
  before entering the TCA-cycle. The carbon skeleton of this amino acid exits the
  TCA-cycle as α-KG, which is then transformed to glutamate. The glutamate is amidated
  to glutamine (Gln) by glutamine synthetase, an enzymatic reaction that benefits
  adjacent tissues by consuming and detoxifying free ammonia. The synthesized glutamine
  returns to the pre-synaptic terminals of both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons,
  with a preference for the former. In both terminals, glutamine is used to regenerate
  glutamate and ammonia via phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG). The regenerated
  glutamate in the GABAergic pre-synaptic terminal is converted back into GABA via
  glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). The more relevant a pathway is, the more thick is
  its arrow.
