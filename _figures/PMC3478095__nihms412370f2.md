caption: 'Biogenesis and functions of non-coding RNAs mediating RNAi are shown. a
  | Left panel: microRNAs (miRNAs) are transcribed as primary miRNA (pri-miRNA; canonical
  pathway) or from introns (mirtrons; non-canonical pathway). After pri-miRNA and
  mirtron processing by the DROSHA–DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8) complex
  or lariat debranching or folding enzymes, respectively, and nuclear export, precursor
  miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) are processed by DICER1 and undergo ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
  assembly with Argonaute proteins 1–4 (AGO1–4). Right panel: endogenous small interfering
  RNAs (endo-siRNAs) are generated from cis- or trans-acting sense–antisense pairs,
  inverted repeats and transposons. endo-siRNAs undergo nuclear processing and export,
  cytoplasmic processing by DICER2, and RNP assembly with AGO2. miRNAs promote deadenylation
  and translational repression and endo-siRNAs promote endonucleotytic cleavage, respectively.
  b | PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are generated from transposons and piRNA clusters.
  piRNA precursors undergo nuclear processing and export, primary or cyclic secondary
  processing (by the PIWI proteins MILI and MIWI2) and piRNP complex assembly. piRNAs
  mediate transposon modulation and post-transcription regulation. c | Roles of small
  nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are shown. snoRNAs are transcribed from introns, processed
  into C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs, undergo small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) assembly
  in Cajal bodies and promote methylation and pseudouridylation of pre-ribosomal RNA
  (pre-rRNA) in the nucleolus. Small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs) promote similar
  splicesosomal RNA modifications and other snoRNAs display additional functions.'
