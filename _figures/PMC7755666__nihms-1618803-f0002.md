caption: 'Ang-1/Tie-2 signaling maintains systemic vascular quiescence by negatively
  regulating endothelial hyperpermeability and inflammation through the stabilization
  of TJs via the Akt pathway. In diabetes, there is overt production of VEGF and accumulation
  of AGE contributing to inflammation, which in turn activates several downstream
  kinases such as Src, p38MAPK, and Akt pathways. Each of these pathway activations
  leads to discrete effects on TJ stability. TJ protein turnover through changes in
  the expression and phosphorylation are the major contributing factors of increased
  vascular permeability observed in several vascular disorders. Ang-1: Angiopoietin-1,
  Ang-2: Angiopoietin-2, VEGF: Vascular endothelial Growth Factor, AGEs: Advanced
  glycation end products, RAGE: Receptor for AGE, TNFα: Tumor necrosis factor α, FoxO1/3a:
  Forkhead box O family of transcription factors 1/3a, p38MAPK: p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase.'
