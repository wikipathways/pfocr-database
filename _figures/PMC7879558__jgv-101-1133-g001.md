caption: NHEJ and antiviral innate immunity. Damaged self-DNA and foreign viral DNA
  are both sensed by the DDR machinery (HR and NHEJ). The DDR machinery is responsible
  for repairing damaged DNA and ensuring survival of the cell. It also leads to the
  activation of a number of stress response pathways, which determine the fate of
  the cell, such as apoptosis/senescence, cellular antiviral state, etc. This graphic
  emphasizes the role of an NHEJ component, the DNA-PK complex, in antiviral immunity.
  DNA-PK recognizes intracellular viral DNA and activates the IFN innate immune response
  through activation of the STING adaptor protein or possibly via the direct phosphorylation
  of the IRF3 transcription factor. The indicated viral proteins suppress the innate
  immune response by blocking the signalling pathway at various stages. DDR, DNA damage
  response; HR, homologous recombination; NHEJ, non-homologous end-joining; DNA-PK,
  DNA-dependent protein kinase; STING, stimulator of IFN genes; IRF3, IFN regulatory
  factor 3; DNA-PKcs, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; HSV ICP0, herpes
  simplex virus infected cell polypeptide 0; VACV, vaccinia virus; AdV, adenovirus.
