caption: 'The species differences in BA synthesis in the liver between humans and
  mice (A), and the FXR regulation of the BA synthesis, BA amidation, and taurine
  synthesis pathways (B,C). The primary BAs, CA and CDCA, are metabolized from cholesterol
  and then further converted to the secondary BAs, DCA and LCA, respectively, by the
  intestinal bacteria in humans. In the mouse liver, CDCA is further metabolized to
  MCAs by Cyp2c70, and the secondary BAs are converted back to the respective primary
  BA by Cyp2a12. Consequently, CA and MCAs are the main BAs in mice. The mouse-specific
  reactions are shown in orange. The human-type BAs act as endogenous FXR agonists,
  and the order of ligand activity is CDCA > DCA > LCA > CA. On the other hand, MCAs
  behave as endogenous FXR antagonists. The gene expression of the rate-limiting enzymes
  in BA synthesis, BA amidation, and taurine synthesis might be regulated by FXR.
  Blue arrow and red line with head show the acceleration and inhibition, respectively.
  The orange line and the arrow show the BAs in the mouse liver and the mouse-specific
  metabolic pathway. Abbreviations: BA, bile acid; BAAT, bile acid-coenzyme A:amino
  acid N-acetyltransferase; BACS, ATP-dependent microsomal bile acid coenzyme A synthetase;
  CA, cholic acid; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; CDO, cysteine dioxygenase; CSD, cysteine
  sulfinate decarboxylase; CYP7, CYP, cytochrome P450; DCA, deoxycholic acid; FMO1,
  flavin containing monooxygenase 1; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; LCA, lithocholic acid;
  MCA, muricholic acid.'
