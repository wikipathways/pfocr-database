caption: Regulation of tumor immune efficacy by the cGAS-STING pathway. Activation
  of the cGAS-STING pathway in tumor cells plays a crucial role in inducing the secretion
  of cytokines and chemokines, thereby promoting the immune-mediated elimination of
  early-stage tumor cells. Additionally, tumors have the capability to produce cGAMP,
  which initiates the transcription of STING in neighboring cells within the tumor
  microenvironment (TME). Following uptake of abnormal extracellular DNA from dying
  tumor cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages engage directly with cGAS. This
  interaction results in increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80 and
  CD86) and MHC molecules in these immune cells, enhancing their capability to activate
  a cytotoxic T-cell response. By releasing type I interferons, antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs) augment the cytotoxic potential of natural killer (NK) cells. Furthermore,
  cGAMP mitigates immunosuppression by inhibiting the recruitment of M2 macrophages
  and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Conversely, sustained activation of
  the STING pathway suppresses dendritic cells (DCs) while attracting myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSCs), thereby tilting the balance towards an immunosuppressive
  tumor microenvironment (TME). Moreover, the involvement of STING in stromal and
  endothelial cells elicits anti-tumor effects by enhancing the inflammatory milieu,
  attracting immune cells, and guiding tumor necrosis. The cGAS-STING signaling pathway
  exhibits a dual role in both promoting and inhibiting tumor growth, with its effects
  predominantly influenced by the intensity and duration of the stimuli. In this context,
  black arrows represent promotion, while black bars symbolize inhibition. This figure
