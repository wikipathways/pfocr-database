caption: Endosomal and exosomal changes in the DS brain. Endocytosed material is sorted
  through early endosomes and late endosomes/MVB for either degradation in lysosomes
  or exosomal secretion. In DS, where neuronal endosome dysfunction begins before
  birth, an age-dependent increase in exosome release appears to be a compensatory
  response to limit the extent of the endosomal pathway pathology that results from
  DS genetic effects.
