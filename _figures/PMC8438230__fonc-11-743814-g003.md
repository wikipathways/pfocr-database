caption: Schematic showing some of the major metabolic pathways for GSC bioenergetic
  function and potential adaptability. The import of both glucose and glutamine are
  emphasised as the major nutrients available for cellular uptake though their respective
  transporters. Glucose is imported through the cellularly expressed glucose transporter,
  in this case either GLUT1 or GLUT3 and is enzymatically processed in the cytoplasm
  to pyruvate. Glycolytic processing can yield intermediate precursors largely subject
  to processing via the PPP – a major nucleotide synthesis pathway. Complete glycolytic
  processing to pyruvate is determined by the final enzymatic step - conversion of
  PEP by PKM2, yielding either lactate for export through MCT4 or pyruvate for mitochondrial
  entrance and processing via TCA and OXPHOS. In addition, Glutamine is imported via
  the ASCT2 transporter and enzymatically converted to glutamate via GLS. The reverse
  reaction is catalysed by GS. Direct conversion of Glutamate to cytoplasmic glutathione
  can take place via GCL, however, indirect conversion can also take place via xCT
  export, coupled to cystine import. Glutamate can be processed further to synthesise
  amino acids and lipids but can similarly be used for TCA anaplerosis via mitochondrial
  import and conversion to αKG by the transaminases GPT and GOT or GLUD. Black arrows
  represent glycolysis and glutaminolysis. Blue curly arrows represent the shuttling
  of intermediates from glycolysis and glutaminolysis and their processing by subsequent
  enzyme-catalysed reactions. Blue dashed arrows represent mitochondrial import/export.
  Magenta arrows represent the reactions that take place as a result of IDH1/2 mutations.
