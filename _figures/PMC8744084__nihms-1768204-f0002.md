caption: Summary of the changes in the circadian molecular system and its downstream
  regulation of metabolism in epilepsy. The circadian molecular system is intimately
  implicated in epilepsy. Several studies demonstrate evidence of reduced expression
  of the two core genes that make up the positive limb, namely Clock and Bmal1, in
  various animal models of epilepsy. There are also numerous changes in the negative
  limb of the system. Per1 was shown to be acutely upregulated in various studies
  on epileptic animals. Triple knockout animals of the PAR bZIP transcription factors
  experience epilepsy, implicating the loss of these transcription factors in epilepsy.
  Finally, changes have also been reported in the Rev-erb and Ror system. Ror was
  reported to be reduced in epileptic tissue, whereas there are conflicting results
  regarding Rev-erb, with some studies reporting increased and some decreased expression
  in models of epilepsy. We also propose that circadian regulation of brain metabolism
  may represent the link between the circadian molecular system and epilepsy. These
  metabolic pathways were pyridoxal metabolism, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  pathway, regulation of redox state, and epigenetic regulation by sirtuins. The pyridoxal
  metabolism, specifically pyridoxal kinase—a rate-limiting enzyme—has been shown
  to be under regulation of the PAR bZIP transcription factors. Reciprocal interaction
  between the mTOR signaling and circadian molecular system transcription, particularly
  Bmal1, was discussed. Dysfunction in the circadian molecular system has led to oxidative
  stress and dysregulated cellular redox state. Finally, sirtuins directly inhibit
  mTOR and are regulated by the circadian rhythm of redox state as exemplified by
  nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH) oscillation. Thus, the circadian molecular system directly modulates
  most of these metabolic pathways while also receiving reciprocal input from some
  of these metabolic pathways. mTORC, mTOR complex
