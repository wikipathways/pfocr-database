caption: Suggested mechanism of pinitol-induced effects on the insulin secretion pathway.
  Pinitol is a glucose mimetic molecule, which is absorbed in the small intestine
  and distributed though the bloodstream to the whole organism. An increase in the
  acid labile subunit (ALS) and C4A complement proteins induce a protection of β-cells.
  Pro-preinsulin granules are packed inside pancreatic β-cells and secreted outside
  the cell as insulin, in response to nutrient intake.
