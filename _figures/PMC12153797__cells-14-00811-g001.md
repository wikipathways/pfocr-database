caption: Exploration of the VE-cadherin structure and the transformations it undergoes
  when it comes into contact with VEGF-A. The principal component of adherens junctions
  is VE-cadherin, which associates with p120-catenin and β-catenin through its intracellular
  structure. The cytoplasmic structural domain of VE-cadherin allows it to associate
  with p120-catenin and β-catenin, as well as platelet hemoglobin. Also, it aids in
  connecting to the cytoskeletal F-actin through alpha-catenin, which leads to the
  assembly of the VE-cadherin–catenin complex. VE-cadherin assembles into clusters
  at the adherens junctions of resting endothelial cells, a state that phosphatases
  like VE-PTP and PTP-A help to maintain by preventing phosphorylation. The activation
  of VEGF-A triggers the binding of VEGF R2 with VE-Cadherin and Src, resulting in
  the breakdown of adherens junctions. VEGFR2 and Src kinase collaborate to phosphorylate
  VE-cadherin, which supports cell survival through the PI3K/AKT pathway and stimulates
  cell growth and migration through the ERK/MAPK pathway. Density-enhanced phosphatase-1
  (DEP-1); C-terminal Src kinase (Csk). This figure was generated using BioRender
