caption: Gene regulatory networks involved in photoreceptor development. (A) A possible
  gene regulatory network for progenitors in their last cell cycle. Ascl1 can activate
  Otx2, although it is not necessary for this event. Thus, other factors (asterisk)
  and/or the loss of Notch signaling are needed to activate Otx2 expression. The expression
  of Ascl1 requires intact miRNA regulatory pathways. Otx2 and Rorb combine to activate
  Prdm1. Alternatively, Rorb and Foxn4 can cooperate to activate Ptf1a and push the
  cell towards amacrine or horizontal cell fates. Transient expression of Otx2 and
  Prdm1 does not prevent amacrine and horizontal development. (B) A possible gene
  regulatory network in Otx2-expressing precursors. Ptf1a suppresses Otx2, probably
  through downstream effectors. Otx2 activates several genes needed for photoreceptor
  and bipolar cell formation. Many, perhaps all, of these targets require additional
  co-factors for their expression. Prdm1 and Vsx2 are likely to cross-repress each
  other to stabilize photoreceptor and bipolar fates, respectively. (C) A gene regulatory
  network that simultaneously shows the rod and cone specification pathways. Otx2
  and Crx are expressed by all photoreceptors. Downstream of Otx2, Prdm1 silences
  the bipolar cell pathway (gray). Nrl and Nr2e3 expression defines rods, whereas
  Thrb2 and Rxrg expression marks cones. The activities of Thrb2 (positive and negative)
  and Rxrg (negative) are needed to generate green (Opn1mw-expressing) cones. Drawn

  description: Gene regulatory networks involved in photoreceptor development. (A)
    A possible gene regulatory network for progenitors in their last cell cycle. Ascl1
    can activate Otx2, although it is not necessary for this event. Thus, other factors
    (asterisk) and/or the loss of Notch signaling are needed to activate Otx2 expression.
    The expression of Ascl1 requires intact miRNA regulatory pathways. Otx2 and Rorb
    combine to activate Prdm1. Alternatively, Rorb and Foxn4 can cooperate to activate
    Ptf1a and push the cell towards amacrine or horizontal cell fates. Transient expression
    of Otx2 and Prdm1 does not prevent amacrine and horizontal development. (B) A
    possible gene regulatory network in Otx2-expressing precursors. Ptf1a suppresses
    Otx2, probably through downstream effectors. Otx2 activates several genes needed
    for photoreceptor and bipolar cell formation. Many, perhaps all, of these targets
    require additional co-factors for their expression. Prdm1 and Vsx2 are likely
    to cross-repress each other to stabilize photoreceptor and bipolar fates, respectively.
    (C) A gene regulatory network that simultaneously shows the rod and cone specification
    pathways. Otx2 and Crx are expressed by all photoreceptors. Downstream of Otx2,
    Prdm1 silences the bipolar cell pathway (gray). Nrl and Nr2e3 expression defines
