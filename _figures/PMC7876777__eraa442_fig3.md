caption: 'Network of NO and low oxygen interactions in a stress-based context. Abiotic
  and biotic stresses. Left: abiotic stress such as flooding causes NO and ethylene
  (ET) accumulation. ET signaling promotes enhanced levels of the NO-scavenger phytoglobin
  1 (PGB1), limiting Group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) degradation through
  inactivation of the PRT6 N-degron pathway. ERFVII members induce expression of core
  hypoxia response genes. In roots, PGBs also protect meristems during PEG-induced
  water stress and hypoxia, since they scavenge NO to prevent programmed cell death
  (PCD), a process initiated by the overaccumulation of NO and mediated by ET and
  ROS. Right: after certain pathogen attacks, the respiration rate increases in the
  plant, leading to local hypoxia that promotes accumulation of ERFVII members. The
  oxidative burst (ROS and NO) as a response to the infection can trigger PCD and
  promotes, along with ERVII members, activation of defense genes. In addition, flooded
  soils predispose root plants to infections by soilborne pathogens (created with
  BioRender.com). EIN2 (ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2); PGB1 (phytoglobin 1); ERFVII (Group
  VII ethylene response factors); ROS (reactive oxygen species); PCD (programmed cell
  death).'
