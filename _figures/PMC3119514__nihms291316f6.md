caption: RNA polymerase II transcription complex. Formation of the transcription pre-initiation
  complex (PIC) begins with the general transcription factor TFII-D, which is composed
  of the TATA-binding protein TBP and 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The transcription
  factor, TBP binds to the TATA box in the promoter region and is necessary for completion
  of the PIC complex. TAF1 and TAF5 appear to be the “organizers” of the complex with
  TAF1 serving as the scaffold for TAF2, TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF9, TAF11, and TAF12
  and branching across two of three lobes in TFII-D. TAF5 binds to TAF1, TAF7, TAF11,
  TAF12, TAF13, and TBP and contains connections to all three of the TFII-D lobes.
  Creation of the TFII-D complex recruits TFII-A to bind to both the DNA and TFII-D,
  stabilizing their interaction. TFII-B binds to TBP and the DNA, serving as a scaffold
  for RNA polymerase II. TFII-F enters the complex with RNA polymerase II, both of
  which bind to the TFII-B/TBP complex. After RNA polymerase II is bound, TFII-E and
  TFII-H enter, completing the PIC and initiating transcription
