caption: Comparison between the gene expression profiles and predicted substrate uptake
  rates. The upper panel in each pair of graphs represents the measured relative gene
  expression profiles as a function of time (in hours). The lower panels represent
  the predicted substrate uptake profiles (mmol/min·g) also as a function of time
  (in hours). Of the carbon sources present in the original growth medium (red), the
  uptake and entry points of glucose, maltose, galactose, glycerol, and lactate into
  the E. coli glycolytic pathway and citric acid cycle are shown in the diagrammed
  metabolic pathways. Acetate (purple) is initially produced and later consumed by
  E. coli cells growing in batch culture. All other substrates are shown in black,
  and the genes encoding various enzymes catalyzing the transport and degradation
  of intermediary substrates are also italicized. The description of genes responsible
  for uptake and utilization of listed carbon sources, their biological roles, and
  description of substrate entry mechanisms are detailed in SI Table 1. mRNA expression
  profiles of genes encoding metabolic transporters and enzymes specifically involved
  in galactose, glucose, glycerol, lactate, acetate, and maltose metabolism are shown.
  The detailed profiles and the full microarray data are presented in the SI Dataset
  3. Gene expression values (on y axis) in the time series microarray data are the
  calculated fold changes for each time point relative to the geometric mean of the
  hybridization intensity of all time points for each gene and are expressed as log2.
  The low values represent lower gene expression, and higher values represent higher
  gene expression.
