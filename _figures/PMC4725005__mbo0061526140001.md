caption: 'Mechanisms of PRA synthesis. Metabolic mechanisms capable of contributing
  to thiamine synthesis (via PRA formation) in the absence of PurF are shown. The
  reactions that form PRA are denoted i to v. Reactions i, ii, and iii are means to
  increase R5P, which then allows nonenzymatic formation of PRA when ammonia is in
  excess, as described in the text. Reactions iv and v are independent of the ammonia
  concentration. The allosteric inhibition of IlvA by isoleucine is depicted to reflect
  its importance in the reported work. Abbreviations: PRPP, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate;
  PRA, phosphoribosylamine; AIR, aminoimidazole ribotide; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate;
  OPP, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate; PR-anthranilate,
  phosphoribosyl anthranilate; ProFAR, 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-5-[(5-phosphoribosylamino)methylideneamino]imidazole-4
  carboximide.'
