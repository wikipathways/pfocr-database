caption: 'A brief overview of the main molecular mechanisms in PCDs (A) Apoptosis
  is initiated by the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. In the intrinsic pathway,
  DNA damage activates p53, and subsequently activates Puma/Noxa to induces signaling
  genes including proapoptotic proteins (Bax, Bak, tBid), apoptosome (Cyt c, Apaf-1,
  pro-Caspase-9), antiapoptotic protein (Bcl-2), and apoptosis execution factors (caspase-3/7).
  The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is initiated by the binding of TNF to its receptors,
  leading to the recruitment of FADD and caspase-8. In addition, caspase-8 can cleave
  Bid to t-Bid, which participates in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis (B) Autophagy
  is initiated by nutrient sensoring, including AMPK, PI3K-1, mTORC1. Autophagosome
  formation and maturation are mediated PI3K-III complex, ATG3, and LC3. Finally,
  the autophagosome contents undergo is degraded by lysosomes (C) Necroptosis is initiated
  by the binding of TNF-α and the receptor TNFR. Under conditions of caspase-8 (initiator
  caspase of extrinsic apoptosis) is not active, the formation of necroptosome (integration
  of phosphorylated RIPK1 and RIPK3) induces the MLKL phosphorylation and oligomerization.
  Finally, the MLKL oligomers translocation to membranes and disrupt it to kill cells
  (D) Pyroptosis is triggered by various pathogens and danger signals. These signals
  activate NLRP3 inflammasome, which consists of NLRP3, ASC and procaspase-1, and
  subsequently leads to cleavage of GSDMD and pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Finally, the
  N-terminal fragment of GSDMD targets to membrane to form membrane pores and induces
  inflammatory cell death (E) Ferroptosis is triggered by severe lipid peroxidation
  with ROS and iron overload, leading to membrane damage. The uptake of Fe2+ is regulated
  by DMT1. The lipid peroxidation is mainly caused by loss of activity of GSH and
  GPX4. The xCT also functions in regulating ferroptosis via Cys. In addition, p53,
  an initiator of intrinsic apoptosis, controls ferroptosis by regulation of the production
  of GSH. Abbreviations: Cyt c, cytochrome c; Apaf-1, apoptotic peptidase activating
