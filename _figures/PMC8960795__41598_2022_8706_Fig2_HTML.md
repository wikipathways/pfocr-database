caption: 'Cold response regulatory pathway based on identified genes for FroT in the
  current study: The major key transcription factor ICE1 becomes initiated via low
  temperature signals and ABA, repressed via JAZ proteins and control transcription
  of CBF genes. CBFs regulate the expression FroT response genes (COR/LEA genes).
  On the other site vernalization genes regulate flowering and specially VRN1 is involved
  in FroT response. FPA promotes flowering and represses FroT. PHYA which are regulated
  via light signals promotes flowering and also FroT. Ovals represents proteins and
  the bar on the bottom genomic DNA. The blue color indicated positive FroT regulators,
  red repressors and green flowering proteins. The gray box (CANNTG) in the bar on
  the bottom stays for CBF promotor interaction sequence. The arrows symbolize activation
  and T headed lines repression. The numbers in black boxes representing the count
  of identified genes in the current study. PHYA Phytrochrome A, VRN Vernalization,
