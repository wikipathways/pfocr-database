caption: 'BBB integrity is maintained by tight junction (TJ) and adherens junction
  (AJ) proteins between endothelial cells and low-level bulk flow transcytosis. Pericyte-endothelial
  cells crosstalk: Notch ligands-Notch3 receptor signaling promotes pericyte survival.
  Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) binds to PDGFRβ on pericytes causing
  pericyte survival, proliferation, and migration. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A
  (VEGFA) binds to endothelial VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) mediating endothelial survival.
  Pericyte-derived notch ligands bind to endothelial Notch1 receptor which mediates
  BBB stability, as does endothelial sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P). Transforming growth
  factor-β (TGFβ) and TGFβ receptor-2 (TGFβR2) signaling occurs bi-directionally between
  pericytes and endothelial cells. Pericyte-secreted angiopoietin-1 (Angpt1) binds
  Tie2 receptor on endothelial cells to promote proliferation. Astrocyte-endothelial
  cells crosstalk: Astrocyte-secreted APOE2 and APOE3, in contrast to APOE4, suppresses
  the pro-inflammatory signaling cyclophilin A-NFkB-matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9)
  pathway in pericytes to maintain BBB stability. Similarly, astrocyte-produced laminin
  maintains BBB stability. Astrocyte-secreted sonic hedgehog (Shh) interacts with
  patched-1 (PTCH1) at the endothelium to further promote BBB stability. Smooth muscle
  cell (SMC)-endothelial cells crosstalk: Ephrin B2 (EphB2) on the endothelium promotes
  BBB stability. PDGF-BB binds PDGFRβ on SMCs to promote survival and migration. Endothelial-secreted
  jagged-1 (Jag-1) binds Notch3 to promote SMC maturation and survival. Neuron-endothelial
  cells crosstalk. Neuron secreted Wnt is a ligand of frizzled (FZD) at the endothelium
  that promotes endothelial cell differentiation.'
