caption: Innate immune response In the first step, infectious viral particles (PAMPs)
  were sensed through PRRs. SARS‐CoV‐2 is detected through endosomal PRRs including
  TLR 3, 7, 8, and 9 and/or through cytoplasmic PRRs such as MDA5 and RIG‐1. Moreover,
  the virus can be sensed through TLR4, which is localized in the cell membrane. Following
  TLRs activation, NF‐'kB's transcription factor induces inflammatory cytokines, whereas
  activated MDA5 and RIG‐1 recruit IRF3 and IRF7 for interferon production. When interferon
  binds its receptor, IFRAR1/2, an IFN‐induced signaling pathway is initiated, resulting
  in the recruitment of JAK‐1 and TYK. JAK‐1 and TYK activation trigger the phosphorylation
  of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 and 2, respectively.
  Subsequently, an IFN‐stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex is formed, containing
  STAT1, STAT2, and IRF‐9. This complex translocated to the nucleus and increases
  the expression of IFN‐stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs translation and posttranslational
  modification trigger antiviral action interferons, including Inhibition of mRNA
  inhibition, RNA degradation, RNA editing, and the initiation of T cell response,
  and NO synthesis. IFN, interferon; IRF, IFN regulatory factor; MDA, melanoma differentiation‐associated
  protein; mRNA, messenger RNA; PRRs, pattern recognition receptors; RIG, retinoic
  acid‐inducible gene‐1‐like receptor; SARS‐CoV‐2, severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus 2; TLR, Toll‐like receptor
