caption: Overall pathways for DR's beneficial effects inferred from the metabolomics
  study. The DR procedure up-regulates phase II detoxification enzymes through the
  Nrf-2 pathway, and the products of this phase II metabolism were detected using
  a multi-platform metabolomics approach. The enhanced phase II metabolism could be
  responsible for various beneficial effects of DR such as lower ALT levels, reduced
  glycogen granules, reduced cancer incidence (), and lower xenobiotic toxicity ()
  as reported here and elsewhere.
