caption: The nucleotide-sugar UDP-GlcNAc is produced through the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway (HBP). This pathway integrates metabolic signals from carbohydrate (glucose),
  amino acid (glutamine), fatty acid (acetyl-CoA), and nucleotide (UTP) metabolism.
  Because ATP is required for UTP biosynthesis, the HBP also reports on energy charge.
  UDP-GlcNAc is required for various forms of glycosylation, including the production
  of the O-GlcNAc modification. O-GlcNAc is produced by the enzyme OGT and removed
  from proteins by the enzyme OGA. Sites of O-GlcNAc modification are often competitively
  phosphorylated by kinases.
