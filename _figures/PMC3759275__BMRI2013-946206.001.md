caption: 'Glycolysis and molecular targets of glycolytic inhibitors. The solid arrows
  indicate glycolytic reactions. 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG) inhibits hexokinase (HK), inducing
  early blockage of glycolytic pathway. 3-Bromopyruvate (3BrPA) inhibits HK and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GAPDH), both blocking glycolytic flux. [3-dihydroxy-6-methyl-7-(phenylmethyl)-4-propylnaphthalene-1-carboxilic
  acid] (FX11) inhibits lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), further preventing the lactate
  production. Dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK),
  limiting the acetyl-CoA production by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). GLUT1, glucose
  transport 1; HK, hexokinase; PGI, phosphoglucose isomerase; PFK, phosphofructokinase;
