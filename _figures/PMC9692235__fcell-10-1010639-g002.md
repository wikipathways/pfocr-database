caption: The oncogenic activity of TLE1 in cancer. TLE1 suppresses cytosolic Bit/TLE5-induced
  apoptosis by forming a TLE1/TLE5 complex, which is mainly localized in the nucleus.
  The ER pathway is activated in the presence of estrogen (E2), and pathway activation
  promotes breast cancer growth. TLE1 forms a complex with activated ER and enhances
  ER target gene expression. TLE1 overexpression increases the expression of ERBB1/2
  and induces EMT, which was found to contribute to lung adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis
  in transgenic mice. In GBM, the TLE1/FOXG1 complex suppresses a cluster of FOXG1
  target genes, thereby promoting GMB tumorigenesis by activating the Notch signaling
  pathway.
