caption: A. GSK3-binding proteins. GSK3-binding proteins regulate the action of GSK3
  in the Wnt signaling pathway. Axin acts as a scaffold bringing together the substrate
  β -catenin with APC, the priming kinase, casein kinase 1 (CK1), and GSK3. In the
  absence of Wnt, phosphorylation of β -catenin by CK1 and GSK3 targets it for degradation.
  Wnt activation results in disheveled (dvl) and FRAT binding to GSK3, inhibiting
  its phosphorylation of β -catenin. This results in the stabilization and accumulation
  of β -catenin, its translocation to the nucleus, and facilitation of TCF/LEF-mediated
  transcription.APC, adenomatous polyposis coli gene product; FRAT, frequently rearranged
  in advanced T-cell lymphoma; LEF, lymphoid-enhancing factor; TCF, T cell factor.B.
  Subcellular distribution. GSK3 is predominantly a cytosolic protein, where it can
  be regulated by serine phosphorylation carried out by several kinases, such as Akt.
  GSK3 reversibly translocates to the nucleus where it’s level is increased in the
  S-phase of the cell cycle and during some types of apoptosis. Nuclear accumulation
  of GSK3 facilitates its actions on nuclear substrates, such as the transcription
  factor cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which is inhibited following
  phosphorylation by GSK3. Mitochondria also contain GSK3. Although no studies have
  reported alterations of mitochondrial GSK3 levels, its activity can be regulated
  by serine phosphorylation. For example, activation of cytosolic Akt can lead to
  its import into mitochondria where it can serine-phosphorylate mitochondrial GSK3
  to inhibit its activity.C. Priming phosphorylation of GSK3 substrates. Many substrates
  of GSK3 must be "primed", which means they are pre-phosphorylated at a serine/threonine
  four residues removed from the serine/threonine that is phosphorylated by GSK3.
  Thus, the consensus site for phosphorylation of primed substrates by GSK3 is S/T-X-X-X-S/T(p).
  This provides an important regulatory mechanism controlling the action of GSK3 because
  signaling pathways phosphorylating its substrates must be active before GSK3 can
  have any effect on such substrates. The preference of GSK3 for phosphorylating substrates
  that have been prephosphorylated (or "primed") 4 amino acids C-terminal to the target
  Ser/Thr is due to the presence of a phosphate binding pocket in GSK3. The phosphate
  of the primed substrate sits in this pocket and positions the phosphate acceptor
  site to enable efficient phosphorylation by GSK3.
