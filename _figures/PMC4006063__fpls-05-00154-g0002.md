caption: Regulation of ion transport across the plasma membrane by polyamines and
  their catabolites. (1) PAs are exported from the cytosol to the apoplast against
  the electrochemical gradient. (2) PAs inhibit K+ (inward-rectifying, KIRC and outward
  rectifying, KORC) and non-selective voltage-independent cation (VI-NSCC) channels.
  (3) PAs oxidation by diamine (DAO) and/or polyamine (PAO) oxidases generates H2O2
  in the apoplastic space. There H2O2 can be converted to •OH by the single electron
  reduction catalyzed by transient valency metal ions. (4) H2O2 and •OH activate a
  variety of non-selective Ca2+-permeable channels, including hyperpolarization-activated
  Ca2+ influx channel (HACC), annexin-formed channel (ANN), and non-selective voltage-independent
  conductance (ROSIC). (5) H2O2, released during PAs catabolization, causes a rapid
  NO generation. In its turn, NO inhibits KORC by a direct nitrosylation and in1duces
  the intracellular Ca2+ release via a pathway involving cGMP and cyclic adenosine
  ribose (cADPR). (6) Ca2+-sensitive network. Several PM channels, including slow
  anion channel (SLAC) and pumps, are regulated by cytosolic Ca2+. (7) PAs potentiate
  the ROSIC activation, activate the PM Ca2+-ATPase and alter the activity of the
  PM H+-ATPase.
