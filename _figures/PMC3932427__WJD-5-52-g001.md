caption: 'Schematic showing the interference of Hepatitis C virus in the insulin signaling
  pathway. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein is known to up regulate Ser312 phosphorylation
  of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 leading to degradation of IRS-1, the key molecule
  involved in propagation of insulin signal downstream from the insulin receptor (IR).
  HCV infection is also known to down regulate TSC1/TSC2 complex, resulting in subsequent
  upregulation of mTOR/S6K1 which leads to Ser1101 phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its
  subsequent degradation. A role of HCV mediated upregulation of SOCS3 and tumor necrosis
  factor-α (TNF-α) has also been proposed which leads to degradation and blocking
  of IRS-1 function. HCV also upregulates glucose 6 phosphatase (G6P), phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase 2 (PCK2) leading to increased glucose production, and down regulates
  glucose transporter (GLUT)-4, GLUT-2, leading to decreased glucose uptake by hepatocytes.
  Overall, these alterations lead to insulin resistance. mTOR: Mammalian target of
  rapamycin.'
