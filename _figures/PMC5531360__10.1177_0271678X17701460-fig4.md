caption: Wnt/β-catenin signaling in TBI. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is tightly regulated
  by soluble Wnt factors. In the presence of these factors, β-catenin escapes degradation
  where it accumulates and promotes transcription of Wnt target genes. The role of
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling after TBI is not completely understood, but many suggest
  that it is involved in regenerative processes such as astrogliosis and neurogenesis.
  It is unclear at the present times what role Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays in vascular
  repair, but there is data in support for it. During vascular development, Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling is required for the development of CNS blood vessels and works in conjunction
  with Notch signaling in arterial-venous specification. Additionally, many angiogenic
  growth factors (VEGF), metalloproteases (MMP-9), and tight junction proteins (Claudin
  3 and ZO-1) are both directly and indirectly modulated by the Wnt signaling cascade.
  Thus, Wnt/β-catenin pathway and its associated molecules may be involved in repairing
  the injured vasculature after TBI.
