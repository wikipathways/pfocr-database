caption: 'Summary of the neurotoxic pathways of MPTP. MPP+ causes inhibition of COMPLEX-1
  in the mitochondria which leads to the opening of transitional pores and then release
  of cytochrome C which causes a cascade of reactions that leads to cell death (Mitochondrial
  apoptotic pathway). Inhibition of COMPLEX 1 also causes an increase in ROS which
  leads to cell damage and eventually cell death (Oxidative stress pathway). Further
  excessive production of ROS leads to formation of AS monomers, and the monomers
  then form toxic oligomers which then inhibits UPS and ATGS and eventually leads
  to cell death (Alpha synuclein pathway). MPP+ causes excessive binding of glutamate
  at the synaptic cleft. This causes Ca influx that leads to excessive production
  of ROS, which damages the cell and cell death occurs finally (Glutamatergic pathway).
  MPP+ activates microglia cell and induces release of proinflamatory cytokines/enzymes
  leading to excessive ROS production, then cell damage and eventually cell death
  (Inflammation pathway). APAF-1: apoptosis protease activating factor 1; AS: Alpha
  synuclien; ATGS: autophagy system; iNOS: Inducible nitric oxide synthase; LB: Lewy
