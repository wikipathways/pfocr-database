caption: The Hippo pathway is involved in megakaryopoiesis (upper panel) and erythropoiesis
  (bottom panel). In megakaryopoiesis, YAP activity is elevated during endoreduplication.
  Although RhoA activity is reduced, LATS1/2 activity is unaffected. This uncoupling
  of RhoA and Hippo-p53 signaling is assumed to be essential for megakaryopoiesis
  (upper panel). YAP/TAZ are required for the maturation and enucleation of erythroblasts
  at late stages of erythropoiesis. However, they are unnecessary in the early stages
  (bottom panel)
