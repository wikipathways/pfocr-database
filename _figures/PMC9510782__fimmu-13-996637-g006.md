caption: Proposed signaling mechanism underlying Dok3 negative regulation of calprotectin
  production in neutrophils. Binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to TLR4 triggers
  phosphorylation of MyD88 on Y257. This activates downstream JAK2-STAT3 signaling
  cascade to turn on the production of calprotectin. Dok3 negatively regulates this
  pathway by recruiting SHP-2 to mediate the de-phosphorylation of MyD88, as such
  preventing excessive release of calprotectin which leads to uncontrolled inflammation
  associated with severe COVID-19. Treatment with TLR4 inhibitor Resatorvid and STAT3
  inhibitor STATTIC, as well as clinically approved JAK inhibitors Fedratinib and
  Momelotinib, can dampen calprotectin production by neutrophils, revealing potential
  therapeutic targets to improve disease outcome in severe COVID-19 patients.
