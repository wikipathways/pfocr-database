caption: Schematic of putative progenitors of the alveolar epithelium. Alveolar type
  II cells (AT2) cells secrete surfactants essential for alveolar function, such as
  surfactant protein C (pro-SP-C). During lung homeostasis, AT2 cells also function
  as self-renewing alveolar progenitor cells, in addition to differentiating into
  AT1 cells, which facilitate gas exchange. Renewal vs. differentiation is regulated
  by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. In response to acute
  lung injury, airway epithelial progenitors [club-like cells, bronchioalveolar stem
  cells (BASCs), and distal airway stem cells (DASCs)] are capable of rapid proliferation
  and, in response to Wnt and FGF signaling, they can differentiate into AT1 and AT2
  cells, respectively (). Studies in mice suggest that airway club cells self-renew
  and generate ciliated cells and alveolar cells during homeostasis, whereas severe
  damage to lung epithelium triggers the expansion and differentiation of BASCs, which
  regenerates the pool of AT2 and club cells () SCGB1A1, secretoglobin family 1A member
