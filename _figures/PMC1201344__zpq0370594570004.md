caption: Fasting effects on fatty acid composition. (A) The fatty acid desaturation/elongation
  pathway (, ). The genes shown in green are strongly repressed by fasting, the genes
  shown in light red are modestly induced, and the genes shown in dark red are strongly
  induced (see ). (B) Long-chain fatty acid abundance in early L4 fed animals (black
  bars) and early L4 animals fasted for 12 h (light gray bars). Total fatty acids
  were extracted from whole animals and quantified by GC/MS. The relative abundance
  of each fatty acid species is expressed as fraction of total measured fatty acid.
  The data shown here were obtained from three independent experiments, and the error
  bars represent standard error.
