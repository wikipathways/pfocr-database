caption: 'The interactions of the microbiota with the host immune system. Bidirectional
  interactions between the mucosal immune system and the microbiota. These include
  (1) the mucus layer, (2) epithelial cells (intercellular tight junction, antimicrobial
  peptide secretion, recognitions of MAMPs), (3) innate immunity (hematopoiesis, IgA
  secretion in LP, Inflammasome), and (4) acquired immunity (Th17 cell activation,
  DCs in LP, M-cells and APC cells in Peyer’s patches, regional lymph nodes). As a
  recognition of MAMPs in epithelial cells, for instance, TLR4－MD2 complex binding
  to LPS activates NF-κB and MAPK via the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. Microbes
  control inflammatory reaction in epithelial cells activating or inhibiting these
  pathways (GAS6-TAMR axis, MD2, MyD88, SIGIRR, PPARγ). Metabolites or MAMPs of microbiota
  have a role in educating the host innate system. In bone marrow, SCFAs promote DC
  maturation and PAMPs induce MCP1 production in MSC, resulting in monocyte migration.
  Epithelial cell-derived cytokines TSLP and APRIL promote class-switch recombination
  and the production of IgA by B cells in intestinal LP, transmitted into mucosal
  layer. Not only microbiota, but also FUBA or SCFAs influence the inflammasome involving
  caspase 1 and proinflammatory cytokines. Th17 cell differentiation induced by commensal
  microbiota, including SBF, produce IL-17 and IL-22, which play a homeostatic role
  in microbiota–host interactions. The M-cell of Peyer’s patches transfers the luminal
  antigen to DCs and APCs, which is drained and induces T cell-dependent B cell maturation
  in MLNs. APC: antigen-presenting cell; APRIL: aproliferation-inducing ligand; DCs:
