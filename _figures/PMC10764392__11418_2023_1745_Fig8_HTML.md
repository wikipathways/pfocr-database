caption: Mechanism diagram of allicin inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation and
  apoptosis. Allicin promoted nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and the expression of
  HO-1, followed by reducing the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, ROS and MDA.
  Allicin inhibited the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria to cytoplasm and
  restored mitochondrial dysfunction. Allicin also inhibited cell apoptosis. In conclusion,
  allicin inhibits inflammation, oxidative stress and cell apoptosis through Nrf2/HO-1
  signaling pathway in sepsis-induced AKI
