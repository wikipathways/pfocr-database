caption: 'Soluble Aβ (blue dots) could activate G-coupled receptors or ionic (Ca++)
  channels leading to increase Ca++ entry. The same effect could be achieved intracellularly
  (green dots) via interaction with the ER, liberating Ca++. This could lead to JNK
  activation and finally AP1-mediated transcription of BACE1. Inhibition of IRs and
  Akt pathway by Aβ could liberate the action of JNK on AP1, achieving the same effect.
  Increased production of BACE1 completes the cycle, enhancing the processing of AβPP
  (red circle) to form more Aβ. Oligomers and fibrils (aggregated blue dots) are formed
  as a consequence of enhanced amyloidogenesis, but it is not clear if they have a
  role in this signalling.Blue dots: Aβ; green dots: Ca++; arrows: stimulation; blunt
  arrows: inhibition; IRs: insulin receptors; G: G-proteins and G-coupled receptors;
  β and γ: β-and γ-secretase cleavages; ER: endoplasmic reticulum.'
