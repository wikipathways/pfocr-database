caption: Schematic presentation of the signaling pathway induced by HCV core protein
  for insulin resistance in human hepatocytes. The results from the present study
  suggest that HCV core protein increases Ser312 phosphorylation of IRS-1, which in
  turn decreases Tyr phosphorylation of IRS-1. This results in impairment of the PI-3K/AKT
  signaling pathway and decreases insulin-induced glucose uptake by human hepatocytes.
  An arrowhead pointing upward (↑) represents activation, an arrowhead pointing downward
  (↓) represents the repression of activities, and blunt arrowheads (⊣) represent
  blockade of signaling.
