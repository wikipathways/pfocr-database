caption: A working hypothesis of the intracellular signal pathway of enocytoid lysis
  in response to PGs in Spodoptera exigua. Following bacterial challenge, PGs are
  produced and bind to membrane receptors (“GPCR”) on enocytoids, which activates
  phospholipase C (PLC) and releases inositol trisphosphate (IP3). The secondary messenger
  then up-regulates intracellular calcium level and activates protein kinase C (PKC).
  The activated PKC may induce opening of Na+ channels and increase osmotic pressure,
  which allows influx of water, responsible releasing prophenoloxidase (PPO) by lyzing
  the enocytoids.
