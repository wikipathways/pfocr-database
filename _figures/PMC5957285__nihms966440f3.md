caption: Rim21, Dfg16, and Rim9 are plasma membrane proteins that are implicated in
  the initial step of ambient pH sensing. Rim8 and Rim20 represent subsequent steps
  in the pathway, and both have interactions with proteins of the ESCRT complex that
  are required for signaling. In the final steps, the Rim13 protease is activated
  and cleaves Rim101, which is then transported to the nucleus. Further details are
  provided in the text. The diagram is adapted from [].
