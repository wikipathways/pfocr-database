caption: Immune cell development and trafficking to the heart. Lymphoid progenitors
  traffic to the thymus, where they undergo positive and negative selection on recognition
  of new antigens or self-antigens, respectively. Positively selected T-cell clones
  migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs [lymph nodes (LNs) and spleen] and wait
  for antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) to induce specific T-cell responses
  and acquisition of migratory phenotypes that will guide them to the heart. Myeloid
  progenitors traffic to secondary lymphoid organs. Heart inflammation results in
  endothelial adhesion molecules in the intramyocardial vessels that mediate T-cell
  and myeloid extravasation. Data from ischemic (solid lines) and nonischemic (dotted
  lines) models of experimental heart failure (HF) suggest that neutrophils (1) and
  monocytes (2) will be recruited from the bone marrow and the spleen by the CCR2/chemokine
  (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 2–CCL5 pathway and contribute to heart inflammation in
  response to ischemia and pressure overload T cell (3) traffic from lymph nodes and
  use CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) and the lymphocyte function–associated antigen
  1 (LFA-1)/intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) to infiltrate the heart in
  nonischemic HF. T-cell expansion occurs in the spleen and LNs in response to ischemia,
  and LFA-1 and very late antigen 4 (VLA-4) mediate heart infiltration. CXCL, C-X-C
  motif ligand; IFN, interferon; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PD-1, programmed
  cell death-1; PDL-1, PD-1 ligand; TCR, T-cell receptor; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α;
  VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1.
