caption: Proposed model for the interaction of ROP-1 with components of the  dauer
  formation pathway. ROP-1 modulates the activity of components in  both the daf-2
  and daf-7 pathways to  influence dauer formation signaling. Favorable growth conditions
  allow  a signal from daf-2 (and maybe also  daf-7) to activate an aspartic proteinase.
  This  proteinase in turn catalyses the processing of ROP-1, which relieves  its
  influence on both signaling pathways. This processing allows ROP-1  to perform another
  set of activities, possibly also related to RNA  degradation as part of its RNA
  quality control function(s).
