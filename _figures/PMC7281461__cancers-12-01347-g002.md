caption: Primary pancreatic cancer recruits fibroblasts to become cancer associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs). Tumor cells with CAFs invade the portal vein and metastasize
  to the liver. In order to establish a focus in the liver, Kupffer cells secrete
  transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) that recruits and activates hepatic stellate
  cells to become CAFs. Strategies to treat pancreatic cancer through CAFs include
  inhibitors of the hedgehog pathway, hyaluronidase, tyrosine kinase, and inhibitors
  of CAF recruitment. miRNAs are a potentially useful strategy because such tools
  can inhibit multiple pathways, simultaneously. Nab-Paclitaxel has been shown to
  target pancreatic cancer CAFs. AMD3100, a CXCL12 chemokine receptor inhibitor, shows
  improved immune response/immunotherapy response to pancreatic cancer—CXCL12 is secreted
  by CAFs.
