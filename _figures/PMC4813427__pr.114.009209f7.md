caption: Schematic representation of the organization of basal ganglia regulating
  motor function and the effects dopamine (DA) depletion on N/OFQ expression and release.
  DA neurons are represented in blue; glutamate (Glu) neurons in green; GABA neurons
  in red; color density indicates the relative levels of activity in each system with
  normal DA neuron function (Panel A, normal function), or after loss of a significant
  fraction of DA neurons (Panel B). GP, globus pallidus; N/OFQ, nociception/ orphanin
  FQ; SNc, substantia nigra compacta; SNr, substantia nigra reticulate; STN, subthalamic
  nucleus, Panel A. With DA neuron function intact, GABA release in the pallido-subthalamic
  neurons in the “indirect” striato-nigral pathway reduces Glu release from the subthalamic
  neurons that activate the GABAergic nigrothalamic pathway. With low release of GABA
  in the thalamus from this pathway, the thalamocortical glutamatergic neurons are
  active, increasing activity in motor cortex and maintaining normal motor function.
  N/OFQ levels and release in the SNr are relatively low under these conditions. Panel
  B. When nigrostriatal DA function is impaired (e.g., after 6-OHDA or MPTP treatment),
  activity in the subthalamic glutamatergic neurons to the SNr is increased, resulting
  in activation of the nigrothalamic GABA pathway and inhibition of thalamocortical
  neurons that facilitate normal motor function. After 6-OHDA or MPTP treatment, ppN/OFQ
  mRNA and N/OFQ levels and release in SNr are increased (, ); N/OFQ release in SNr
  is also increased by haloperidol treatment (). NOPr antagonists largely reverse
  the effects of DA depletion by 6-OHDA on GABA release in SNr and thalamus (, , ).
  Treatment with 6-OHDA also reduces NOPr mRNA expression in SNc (; ). Arrows indicate
  the direction of change in N/OFQ, GABA or Glu release after 6-OHDA or MPTP treatment.
