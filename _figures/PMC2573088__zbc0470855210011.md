caption: Model for S1P2 up-regulation impairs the activation of  integrin αvβ3, chemotactic,  wound-healing,
  and morphogenetic responses in senescent ECs.  S1P1-mediated Akt/Rac signaling stimulates
  integrin  αvβ3 activation, chemotactic, wound-healing,  and morphogenetic responses
  in young ECs. In contrast, both S1P1  and S1P2 subtypes of S1P family receptors
  are up-regulated in  senescent ECs. The increased expression of S1P2 antagonizes
  the  “stimulatory” signaling mediated by S1P/S1P1pathway  via elevating cellular
  PTEN phosphatase activity. The S1P2-mediated  PTEN activation results in the inactivation
  of Rac GTPase, which ultimately  inhibits the integrin αvβ3 activation,  migratory,
  wound-healing, and morphogenetic capabilities in senescent ECs.
