caption: 'Illustration showing presumed mechanisms mediating suberoylanilide hydroxamic
  acid (SAHA)-induced autophagy. (A) Acetylated cytoplasmic p53 protein that escapes
  deacetylating activity by applying HDACi (histone deacetylase inhibitor) preferentially
  induces apoptotic cell death by direct interaction with the Bcl-2 family of pro-apoptotic
  proteins. Concurrently, cytoplasmic p53 protein inhibits autophagic cell death by
  inducing Beclin-1 degradation via the ubiquitin-specific peptidases USP10 and USP13
  and/or inhibiting the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway. It is unclear whether the
  canonical pathway is mediated by direct p53/FIP200 interaction or whether this represents
  an extra pathway. TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) inhibits
  autophagy by downregulation of glycolysis and a suppression of ROS formation. The
  p53 family members p63/p73 possibly also possess transcription-independent inhibitory
  functions for autophagy (dashed line). (B) Mutant p53 (p53Mut) protein reverses
  the situation and predominantly activates autophagy due to its inability to inhibit
  autophagy or stimulate apoptosis. Fork symbols: inhibition by indicated proteins.
  Arrow lines: activation or interaction with indicated proteins. Double arrow: major
  pathway activity. For abbreviations, see .'
