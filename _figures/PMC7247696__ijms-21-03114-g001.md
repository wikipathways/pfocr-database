caption: Toll-like-receptor (TLR)-4, after activation by pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) supported by myeloid
  differentiation factor-2 (MD-2), initiates downstream signaling in two major ways.
  The first is the MyD88-dependent pathway connected with toll-interleukin 1 receptor
  domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) resulting in myddosome formation, a structure
  containing IRAK-4 and IRAK-1 kinases. Activation of IRAK-1 results in TRAF-6 induction
  with collateral ubiquitination and phosphorylation. TRAF-6 promotes TAK-1. Activation
  of TAK-1 results in IKK/NF-κB complex formation and promotion. ERK1/2 kinases are
  also activated, which indicates activated protein-1 (Ap-1), the factor activating
  the transcription process. The second pathway, MyD88 -independent, connected with
  translocating chain-associating membrane (TRAM), leads through toll-like receptor
  adaptor molecule-1 (TRIF) activation resulting in TRAF-3 and TRAF-6 promotion. RIP
  is recruited by TRAF-6, activating RIP signaling on the TAK-1/ERK 1/2/Ap-1 axis.
  TRAF-3 activates IKK and TBK-1 to activate interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3).
  IRF-3 induces interferon expression and other proinflammatory cytokines.
