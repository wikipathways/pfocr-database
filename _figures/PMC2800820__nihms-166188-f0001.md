caption: Multiple pro-inflammatory mediators in the tumor microenvironment increase
  the accumulation of MDS cells and enhance their immunosuppressive activity. MDS
  cell accumulation is driven by the proinflammatory factors prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),
  S100A8/A9 proteins, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cytokines IL-1β and
  IL-6, and complement component C5a (), all of which are produced in the tumor microenvironment
  by host stromal cells. COX2 and PGE2 can also be secreted by tumor cells. MDS cells
  express receptors for all of these molecules except IL-1β. Besides increasing MDS
  cell abundance and potency, C5a and S100A8/A9 proteins are chemotactic, attracting
  MDS cells to tumor sites. VEGF and S100A8/A9 proteins are produced by both MDS and
  other host cells, providing an autocrine regulatory pathway for maintaining MDS
  cell levels. By activating MDS cells, these pro-inflammatory mediators inhibit anti-tumor
  immunity and interfere with cell-mediated immunotherapies.
