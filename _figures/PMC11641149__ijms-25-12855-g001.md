caption: Regulatory factors of mitochondrial dynamics, associated with Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). In AD (red arrows), beta-amyloid (Aβ)
  aggregation decreases PGC-1α level and thus, biogenesis of mitochondria. Aβ aggregation
  leads to inhibited fusion of mitochondria is inhibited through interaction of appoptosin
  with Mfn1/2. On the contrary, Aβ aggregation causes increased mitochondrial fission
  and fragmentation by elevating Drp1 and Fis1 levels. PD (blue arrows, blue asterisks)
  is associated with accumulation of α-synuclein and genetic forms of PD are often
  linked to disruptions in PINK1/PARKIN signaling pathway. PINK1 overexpression inhibits
  Drp1-mediated fission, while PINK1 knockdown increases mitochondrial fragmentation.
  Additionally, LRRK2, a genetic factor of the dominant form of PD, phosphorylates
  Drp1, which promotes its translocation to mitochondria and fission. LRRK2 also leads
  to decreased level of fusion-associated protein Opa1. Another factor of familial
  PD, DJ1, causes increased fragmentation of mitochondria
