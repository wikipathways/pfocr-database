caption: Contributions of the Pa in psychiatric disorders. Rodent studies suggest
  a role for the Pa in anxiety, drug relapse, and regulating the effects of chronic
  stress. (A) Orexin (ORX) projections from the hypothalamus to the Pa regulate fear
  and anxiety-like behavior through the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), and
  bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). (B) In a pathway for drug relapse, ORX
  and cocaine- and amphetamine-related transcript (CART) from the hypothalamus, and
  contextual cues from the subiculum project to the Pa. In turn, the Pa regulates
  dopamine (DA) efflux in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAccSh) and drug-seeking behavior.
  (C) Via the CeA and BNST, the Pa has been shown to be an important regulator of
  the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis during chronic stress. A few studies
  in rodent models of depression have shown involvement of the Pa, however its specific
  role in depressive-like behavior remains to be determined. The role of the Pa in
  regulating chronic stress may also influence (A) and (B). There is likely significant
  overlap between the pathways for these disorders, which are highly comorbid, and
  are exacerbated by severe or chronic stress. MDD, major depressive disorder; sgACC,
  subgenual anterior cingulate cortex.
