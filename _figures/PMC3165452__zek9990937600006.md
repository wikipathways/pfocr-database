caption: Schematic representation of the functions proposed for cell fusion proteins.
  The transcription factor PP-1 is a target for phosphorylation by MAK-2. PP-1, along
  with the other transcription factors identified (ADV-1, ADA-3, SNF5, and the dimeric
  RCO-1/RCM-1), is proposed to reside in the nucleus (N) and to direct the transcription
  of the cell fusion genes. HAM-5 is proposed to function in directing MAK-2 into
  the nucleus, where it phosphorylates PP-1 and perhaps some of the other transcription
  factors. In addition to regulating transcriptional activity, the two MAP kinase
  signaling pathways (NRC-1/MEK-2/MAK-2 and MIK-1/MEK-1/MAK-1) also regulate CAT formation
  and growth by controlling vesicular trafficking to and from the hyphal tip. The
  two MAP kinase pathways are activated by cell-to-cell signaling, and the plasma
  membrane-associated HAM-6, HAM-7, and HAM-8 proteins might function as receptors
  for the signaling factor(s) or might be directly involved in fusion between the
  plasma membranes. As part of the cell-to-cell signaling process, the HAM-1/SO protein
  and the RAC-1/NRC-1/MEK-2/MAK-2 complex transiently associate with the plasma membrane
  in an oscillatory “ping pong” manner. The PP2A phosphatase might function in dephosphorylating
  the MAP kinase pathway proteins. The HAM-2/HAM-3/MOB3 complex is located on an intracellular
  vesicle (V) and is proposed to regulate vesicular trafficking to the hyphal tip.
  We propose that the HAM-2/HAM-3/MOB3 complex could receive input from the MAP kinase
  pathways and that the HAM-9 protein could function to connect the HAM-2/HAM-3/MOB3
  complex to the MAP kinase pathways. AMPH-1 is proposed to play roles in mediating
  the formation of endosomes and to be necessary to maintain a balance between exocytosis
  and endocytosis of vesicles during CAT growth. The HAM-10 protein may function in
  regulating the movement of vesicles at the hyphal tip. The PKR1 protein is found
  in the ER and is necessary for efficient vesicular trafficking in the secretory
  pathway.
