caption: 'Schematic diagram of KEGG-derived phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan
  biosynthesis pathways. Boxes indicate key products/intermediates. Briefly, over
  seven metabolic steps, the shikimate pathway converts phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose
  4-phosphate to shikimate which is then converted to chorismate, the precursor of
  aromatic amino acids. Red arrows indicate reactions associated with predicted conditionally
  essential genes in M9 minimal medium while gray arrows indicate reactions in which
  the associated genes are non-essential. Associated genes are listed next to their
  corresponding reactions: essential genes in black font; non-essential genes in gray
  font.'
