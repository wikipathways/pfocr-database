caption: Cell death pathways currently implicated in motor neuron cell death in ALS
  and related miRNAs. (A) Extrinsic apoptosis. Fas ligand (FASL) activation of the
  cognate FAS death receptor induces intracellular formation of the death‐inducing
  signalling complex (DISC), which in turn interacts with Fas‐associated protein with
  death domain (FADD) through their death effector domains, inducing the recruitment
  and dissociation of pro‐caspase‐8 from the DISC. Activated caspase‐8 initiates the
  caspase cascade and leads to apoptosis through caspase‐3 activation. miR‐375 can
  promote the extrinsic pathway by various mechanisms. miR‐375, miR‐125b, and miR‐27a/b
  can inhibit the extrinsic pathway by silencing p53. miR‐21 can inhibit the extrinsic
  pathway by targeting FasL. (B) Intrinsic apoptosis. Following cytotoxic stimuli,
  pro‐apoptotic BH3‐only proteins silence the anti‐apoptotic protein BCL2, effectively
  allowing BAX and BAK to dimerize. This dimerization makes the outer mitochondrial
  membrane permeable and allows cytochrome_c (cyt_c) release into the cytoplasm. The
  cyt_c binding to apoptotic protease activating factor‐1 (Apaf‐1) prompts formation
  of the apoptosome, which activates caspase‐9 and the caspase cascade, in which apoptosis
  is ultimately driven by caspase‐3 activation. MiR‐125b, miR‐155, miR‐365, miR‐24,
  miR‐1, and miR‐21 promote apoptosis by silencing BCL2. MiR‐133a inhibits apoptosis
  by silencing caspase‐9. MiR‐23, miR‐27, miR‐1, miR‐21, and miR‐26 inhibit intrinsic
  apoptosis, and miR‐23 has also pro‐apoptotic properties. (C) Necroptosis. Necroptosis
  is favoured by low levels of caspase‐8, combined with sufficient concentrations
  of receptor‐interacting protein 3 (RIP3) and mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase
  (MLKL). Following tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) stimulation by tumour
  necrosis factor (TNF), RIP1 interacts with RIP3, and its phosphorylation is activated
  MLKL. They form a complex called the necrosome, which causes cell membrane rupture.
