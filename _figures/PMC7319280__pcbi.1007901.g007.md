caption: a) The first mechanism comprises the two parameter combinations αmpi & αm
  & βsp and αmpi & αm & Ts. The dotted lines indicate that the parameter combinations
  differ in the corresponding parameters (βsp and Ts), but the affected process is
  the same. In both parameter combinations the process is predicted to be reduced,
  which is denoted by the blue color. In contrast, the red solid lines represent the
  two processes shared among the two combinations, which are predicted to be increased.
  b) The parameter combinations αmpa & αsm & βsp and αmpa & αsm & Ts constitute the
  second mechanism. In accordance to the first mechanism, the two parameter combinations
  differ in parameter βsp and Ts. The two parameters affecting ATM-induced degradation
  of Mdm2 (αsm) and Mdm2-mediated degradation of activated p53 (αmpa) are predicted
  to be reduced upon IKK2 inhibition.
