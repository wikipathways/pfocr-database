caption: Impact of autophagy on the cellular effectors of liver fibrogenesis. (a)
  Autophagy drives hepatic stellate cell activation from a quiescent, lipid-rich to
  a myofibroblastic, fibrogenic phenotype. In response to chronic liver injury, quiescent
  hepatic stellate cells lose their retinyl ester-containing lipid droplets and acquire
  myofibroblastic features, associated with fibrogenic properties. Autophagy in hepatic
  stellate cells is stimulated by oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress and may
  serve to provide free fatty acids from retinyl esters, thereby supplying the energy
  required for initiating and perpetuating the fibrogenic phenotype. (b) Autophagy
  as a protective anti-inflammatory process with antifibrogenic properties. Hepatic
  macrophage autophagy stimulates an anti-inflammatory pathway, that reuses the production
  of IL1 alpha and IL1 beta, resulting in inhibition of liver fibrogenesis. In addition,
  inhibition of Th17 polarisation by IL1 alpha and beta may also contribute to the
  antifibrogenic effects of macrophagic autophagy. (c) Hepatoprotective properties
  of autophagy may contribute to inhibition of fibrogenesis. Autophagy is generally
  considered as a survival pathway for hepatocytes, therefore limiting oxidative stress
  profibrogenic pathways for hepatic stellate cells such as ER stress and mitochondrial
  damage.

  description: Impact of autophagy on the cellular effectors of liver fibrogenesis.
    (a) Autophagy drives hepatic stellate cell activation from a quiescent, lipid-rich
    to a myofibroblastic, fibrogenic phenotype. In response to chronic liver injury,
    quiescent hepatic stellate cells lose their retinyl ester-containing lipid droplets
    and acquire myofibroblastic features, associated with fibrogenic properties. Autophagy
    in hepatic stellate cells is stimulated by oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum
    stress and may serve to provide free fatty acids from retinyl esters, thereby
    supplying the energy required for initiating and perpetuating the fibrogenic phenotype.
    (b) Autophagy as a protective anti-inflammatory process with antifibrogenic properties.
    Hepatic macrophage autophagy stimulates an anti-inflammatory pathway, that reuses
    the production of IL1 alpha and IL1 beta, resulting in inhibition of liver fibrogenesis.
    In addition, inhibition of Th17 polarisation by IL1 alpha and beta may also contribute
    to the antifibrogenic effects of macrophagic autophagy. (c) Hepatoprotective properties
    of autophagy may contribute to inhibition of fibrogenesis. Autophagy is generally
    considered as a survival pathway for hepatocytes, therefore limiting oxidative
    stress profibrogenic pathways for hepatic stellate cells such as ER stress and
    mitochondrial damage.
