caption: Interaction of CD8+ NKT-like cells, CD8+ T cells and γδT cells with NK cells. (A)
  Interaction strength of CD48 signaling pathway in liver metastasis and adjacent
  tissues in BC, CRC, NPC and THCA. (B) CD48 signal among CD8+ NKT-like cells, CD8+
  T cells, γδT cells and NK cells. Heatmap shows the total probability and bubble
  plot shows the probability and P value of individual ligand-receptor pairs. (C)
  Expression of CD48 in CD8+ NKT-like cells, CD8+ T cells and γδT cells as well as
  expression of CD244 in NK cells in liver metastasis and adjacent tissues in BC,
  CESC, CRC, NPC and THCA. (D) Interaction strength of TNF and CD40 signaling pathway
  in liver metastasis and adjacent tissues in BC, CRC, NPC and THCA. (E) TNF and CD40
  signals among CD8+ NKT-like cells and NK cells. Heatmap shows the total probability
  and bubble plot shows the probability and P value of individual ligand-receptor
  pairs. (F) Expression of TNF and CD40LG in CD8+ NKT-like cells in liver metastasis
  and adjacent tissues in BC, CESC, CRC, NPC and THCA. (G) Expression of ITGAM, ITGB2,
  TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B in NK cells in liver metastasis and adjacent tissues in BC,
  CESC, CRC, NPC and THCA. Student’s t-test was performed, P < 0.05 was considered
  significant.
