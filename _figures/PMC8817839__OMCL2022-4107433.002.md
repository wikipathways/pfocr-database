caption: CGRP secreted by TRPV1 neurons in the stem cell niches promotes the proliferation
  and differentiation of AT II cells. Stem cell niches are specialized microenvironment
  composed of different types of cells, extracellular matrix proteins, and growth
  factors. Promoter DNA methylation regulates CGRP expression. CGRP secreted by TRPV1
  neurons in the stem cell niches takes effect on lung pluripotent stem cells to induce
  the proliferation and differentiation of AT II cells through downstream pathways,
  such as Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway.
