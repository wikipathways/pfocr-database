caption: 'Schematic representation of the mechanistic PK-PD model: bone cell differentiation
  stages along with biochemical and biomechanical interactions are presented. Subcutaneous
  injection of denosumab leads to distribution of the drug into the central compartment
  where it interacts with the RANK-RANKL-OPG pathway (red arrow between Obp and Ocp).
  The latter interactions are accounted for via competitive binding reactions. The
  mineralisation of osteoid is shown in orange.'
