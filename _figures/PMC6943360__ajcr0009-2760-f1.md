caption: 'An overview of MIF signaling pathways: MIFs interactions can contribute
  to the formation of cancer and neural development. When MIF targets the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway, β-galactosidase is upregulated, resulting in an increase of NSPCs.
  MIFs interaction with the PI3K/AKT pathway results in an increase of VEGF and a
  decrease of the pro-apoptotic factors BAD and BAX, leading to both angiogenesis
  and metastasis. MIF also has the capability to interact with p53, decreasing the
  expression of p21 and BAX, which results in crucial cell proliferation. MIF can
  also directly interact with CXCR2 and CXCR4, which result in inflammatory activity
  and leukocyte chemotaxis.'
