caption: 'Viral CD8+ T cell evasion. ① Infected DC entering lymph nodes pass virus
  to B cells. They also secrete viral evasins: M1, M3, and M4 (). EBV and KSHV secrete
  their own evasin sets. M1 promotes an expansion of Vβ4+CD8+ T cells (). M4 promotes
  lymphoid colonization (,). M3 binds chemokines () to evade CD8+ T cells () and can
  provide bystander protection (). Thus, lytically infected DC create an evasive milieu
  for latently infected B cell proliferation. K3 degrades MHC class I heavy chains
  () and the associated peptide transporter (), further protecting infected DC against
  CD8+ T cells () and promoting B cell proliferation (). ② Infected B cells make ORF73,
  which maintains the viral episome, and M2, which like the EBV LMP-2 and KSHV K1
  mimics antigen receptor signaling (). Like EBNA-1, ORF73 minimizes its entry into
  the MHC class I presentation pathway and bypassing this evasion terminates lymphoid
  infection at an early stage (). Linking a well-presented epitope to M2 also attenuates
  infection (). KSHV, Kaposi''s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.'
