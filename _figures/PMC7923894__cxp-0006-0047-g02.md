caption: 'Summary of potential mechanisms linking PD and MDD. a MDD as a non-motor
  symptom of PD: oligomeric misfolded α-syn released by neurons is detected by microglia
  and astrocytes mainly via TLRs. Activated microglia release various pro-inflammatory
  markers, propagating neuroinflammation to other microglia and astrocytes and interacting
  with different processes that can contribute to the manifestation of depressive
  behaviours. IL-1β acts via IL-1β receptors and the p38 MAPK inflammatory pathway
  to increase serotonin reuptake from synapses through SERT, reducing synaptic serotonin
  levels to produce depressive behaviour []. TNF-α, IL-1, and IFN-α disrupt HPA axis
  function and cause GC resistance, which are hallmarks of depression. IFN-γ, IL-6,
  and TNF-α induce IDO, an enzyme that catabolizes the monoamine precursor tryptophan
  into kynurenine, which reduces capacity for monoamine synthesis by reducing concentrations
  of their precursor []. The kynurenine can be converted to an NMDA receptor agonist
  (QUIN) which stimulates increased glutamate release and reduces its uptake by astrocytes
  (an effect also observed due to increased circulating GCs), resulting in glutamate
  excitotoxicity [, ]. This excess glutamate combined with neuroinflammation reduce
  BDNF, impairing neural plasticity and subsequently contributing to depressive behaviour
  []. Inhibition of neural plasticity may also be caused by IL-1β through NF-κβ signalling
  activation []. b MDD as a prodrome or risk factor of PD: microglia and astrocytes
  respond to stress potentially via c-Fos signalling from neurons [] and/or peripheral
  cytokines that have travelled past the BBB []. These activated glial cells propagate
  neuroinflammation to activate other glial cells, all of which may produce ROS, RNS,
  cytokines, and glutamate, which can lead to neurodegeneration through glutamate
  excitotoxicity and/or direct oxidative and nitrative damage [, ]. Stress also increases
  neuroinflammatory signalling proteins, including TLR4 and CD86, on microglial membranes,
  leading to the “priming” of microglia to subsequent pathogens to produce more vigorous
  α-syn-induced microglial activation in future []. Astrocyte activation results in
  pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and impairs glymphatic clearance which further
  increases the risk of α-syn accumulation and PD pathology, possibly through reduced
  AQP4 distribution, structural atrophy of astrocytes, and/or physical reduction in
  astrocytes. The combination of these processes may increase the risk of PD as glymphatic
  disruption means that any misfolded fibrillar α-syn present is more likely to accumulate
  in the brain parenchyma. Following this, neuroinflammatory responses are able to
  do more significant damage as the microglia being activated have been primed [,
