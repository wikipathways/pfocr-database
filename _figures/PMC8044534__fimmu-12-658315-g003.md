caption: The diverse range of possible modulatory effects of the heme catabolites
  generated by the enzyme activity of HO-1 in the TME. This figure summarizes the
  possible modulatory effects of the heme catabolites in the TME. However, the relative
  utilization and biological importance of each pathway in disease progression or
  control is TME-dependent and key observations relating to these pathways are discussed
  within the text. CO and biliverdin/bilirubin mediate their anti-apoptotic effects
  via the modulation of signal transduction, and the inhibition of K+ influx. Their
  antioxidant effects are mediated via the inhibition of iNOS. Both CO and biliverdin/bilirubin
  inhibit the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the NF-κB pathway and increase
  production of IL-10, and CO also activates sGC. CO induces the maturation of tolerogenic
  DCs and inhibits the activity and proliferation of CD8+ T-cells, while bilirubin
  inhibits the activation of CD4+ T-cells. Ferrous iron [Fe (II)] enacts antioxidant
  effects via ferritin, however, an imbalance between ROS levels and iron overload
  can lead to lipid oxidation and ferroptosis.
