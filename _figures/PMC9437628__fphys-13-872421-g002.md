caption: TNF-α mediated Sphingomyelin Signaling Pathway- The pathway starts from the
  binding of TNF-α with TNF receptor 1. The binding of TNF-α trimer with TNFR1 leads
  to receptor trimerization. It is followed by the recruitment of three cytosolic
  adaptor proteins, namely, TRADD, RAIDD, and FAN. TRADD and RAIDD bind with the DD
  of TNFR1 while FAN binds with its NSD. The recruitment of TRADD causes the recruitment
  of three additional adapter proteins, namely, RIP, TRAF2, and FADD. The RIP along
  with RAIDD (another death domain-containing molecule) induces activation of caspase
  2, which leads to apoptosis. FADD allows the activation of caspase 8 via interacting
  with its DED domain (death effector domain). TRAF2 is capable of interacting with
  NIK (NF-κB Inducing Kinase) which belongs to the MEKK family. NIK phosphorylates
  its target IKK (Inhibitor of κB Kinase) which ultimately leads to the activation
  of NF-κB. NF-κB produces an anti-apoptotic effect by promoting transcription of
  cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (c-IAP2), which blocks the caspase 8 activation
  and consequently apoptosis. In the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, sphingomyelinases
  (SMase) catalyze the conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide. In neurons, ceramide
  is produced by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin via acidic (A-SMase) or neutral (N-SMase).
  The activation of both forms of SMases is mediated by the TNF-α signaling cascade.
  The adaptor proteins TRADD and FADD induce the activity of acid SMase, whereas FAN
  is associated with the activation of neutral SMase. Ceramide, generated in response
  to acid sphingomyelinase, activates aspartyl protease cathepsin D responsible for
  the cleavage and activation of pro-apoptotic Bid (family member Bcl-2). The elevated
  levels of ceramide cause increased permeability of mitochondria which induces the
  release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria. It causes the activation of caspases
  3 and 9, ultimately leading to apoptosis via an intrinsic pathway. On the other
  hand, ceramide produced via neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) directly activates
  two target enzymes, namely, CAPK (ceramide activated protein kinase) and CAPP (ceramide
  activated protein phosphatase) (). Both of them are capable of evoking signaling
  that leads to apoptosis. CAPK phosphorylates raf-1, which enhances its activity
  towards MEK (MAPK kinase). The MAPK signaling cascade induces activation of ERK
  cascade, which either results in cell cycle arrest and cell death or contributes
  to neuronal cell survival depending upon the form of ERK activated. On the other
  hand, CAPP (comprising of serine-threonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A) moves the
  system towards apoptosis by inactivating Akt.
