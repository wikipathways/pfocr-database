  indicated with red arrows. The reactions catalyzed by xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR)
  are indicated with yellow arrows and the boxes corresponding to irreversible products
  are colored in green []. The physiologic functions of uric acid are reported: 1.
  Uric acid supports blood pressure, even in the absence of an adequate dietary intake
  of salt, counteracting the nitric oxide-induced vasodilation, increasing cyclooxygenase-2
  expression and activating the renin-angiotensin system []. 2. Uric acid is a free
  radical scavenger that takes part in the non-enzymatic defense system against oxidative
  stress in biological fluids. The antioxidant activity of uric acid plays an essential
  function in preventing cancer, cardiovascular diseases [] and other pathological
  conditions []. Indeed, a correlation has been proposed in different species between
  levels of uricemia and their life expectancy []. 3. During tissue injury, intracellular
  uric acid is released from dead cells, stimulating macrophages and inducing the
  inflammatory response by acting as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)
  []. 4. Uric acid promotes fat accumulation, which can help to overcome periods of
  starvation, as well as hepatic gluconeogenesis, thus elevating blood sugar [,].'
