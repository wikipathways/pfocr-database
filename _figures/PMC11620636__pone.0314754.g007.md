caption: 'Based on the literature and our RNA-seq analysis, we proposed a schematic
  representation of the IL-27 pathway during SARS-CoV-2 infection, where IL-27 interacts
  with its receptor, leading to the activation of signaling pathways. (A) IL-27 can
  directly activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, leading to STAT1 homodimerization
  and induction of different ISGs. In this pathway, lncRNAs LINC00487 and GBP1P1 can
  upregulate RSAD2 and GBP1/4/5 mRNA, respectively, inducing an IFN-I-independent
  antiviral state. (B) IL-27 promotes TLR8 expression through cis-regulation exerted
  by LINC02154. TLR8 expression leads to increased detection of viral RNA in endosomes
  and the activation of kinases such as IRAK4 that can activate IRF7, which in turn
  is translocated to the nucleus and induces the expression of IFN-I. However, viral
  proteins can counteract this pathway and prevent or delay the production of these
  mediators. (C) On the other hand, IL-27 may contribute to the inflammatory response
  through the TLR8/IRAK4 pathway or directly induce the translocation of transcription
  factors such as AP-1 and NF-kB, leading to the expression of chemokines and cytokines.(D)
  IL-6 has been associated with severe disease and is a target of cis-upregulation
  by STEAP1B-AS1 and downregulation by the RBP ZC3H12A. (E) SARS-CoV-2 induces miRNA
  expression such as MIR155HG, which can positively regulate the inflammatory response
  during viral infections. ISG: Inteferon-stimulated gene; miRNA: micro-RNA; lncRNA:
  Long no coding RNA'
