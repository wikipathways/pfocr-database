caption: TNFα and TCR activation pathways. A TNFα binding to its receptors TNF-R1
  and TNF-R2 triggers a coupling between TNF-R1/2 and TRADD via their death domains
  (DD). TRADD recruits TRAF2, RIPK1, RIPK2, and RIPK3, and TRAF5. Following TNF-R1
  endocytosis, TRADD dissociates from the receptor complex and associates with FADD
  and caspase-8, initiating pro-apoptotic signaling pathways. After TRAF2 auto-poly-ubiquitination,
  RIPK1 is poly-ubiquitinated, which recruits TAB 1, TAB 2, TAB 3, TAK1, and TRAF6
  to the complex. TAB 2 forms a bridge between TRAF6 and TAK1, allowing TAK1 to activate
  the IKK complex by phosphorylating IKKβ. B Activation of the TCR-CD3 complex induces
  phosphorylation of ITAMs on TCRζ and CD3. ZAP70 and LCK are recruited, LCK phosphorylates
  ZAP70, PLCγ1, and the scaffold protein SLP-76, and recruits PKCθ to the complex.
  PKCθ recruits CARMA1, CARD9, CARD10, CARD14, BCL-10, and MALT1, leading to activation
  of the IKK complex
