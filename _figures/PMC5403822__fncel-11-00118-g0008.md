caption: A schematic of VIP-activated pathways in the mouse submucosal plexus determined
  using Ca2+ imaging. This wiring diagram represents the most plausible neuro-glia
  circuit based on our experimental observations. VIP acting via VPAC1 and/or VPAC2
  receptors elicits [Ca2+]i transients in submucosal neurons. Neurons respond directly
  to VIP or secondarily via nicotinic transmission. Selective activation of VPAC1
  receptors evokes glial [Ca2+]i transients. This neuron to glia signaling pathway
  involves a TTX-insensitive mechanism. VPAC1 receptors expressed on cholinergic neurons
  and/or on CGRP+ nerve terminals may be involved. VIP also activates a VPAC2 receptor-mediated
  pathway that inhibits glial [Ca2+]i responses. However, whether the VPAC2 receptor-expressing
  neuron inhibits glial responses directly or by inhibiting the VPAC1 receptor-mediated
  pathway, is yet to be determined. Note that the neurochemical identities of neurons
  involved are not illustrated for simplicity. Further, the possibility that VPAC1-
  and VPAC2-receptors are expressed on the same neuron, but activate different intracellular
  signaling pathways, cannot be excluded.
