caption: 'Generation of an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. (1) Regulatory
  T-cells (TRegs) suppress immune response via direct cell contact and humoral mechanisms.
  TRegs constitutively express CTLA-4, which binds to CD80 and CD86 on antigen-presenting
  cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), leading to impaired DC maturation and blocking
  binding of CD80/CD86 to CD28 on conventional T-cells, thereby preventing co-stimulation
  and T-cell activation. Moreover, TRegs can directly target effector T-cells (TEff)
  and natural killer (NK) cells for destruction by secreting cytotoxic granzymes and
  perforin. Secretion of inhibitory cytokines such as TGFβ, IL-10 and IL-35 further
  inhibit anti-tumor immune response. (2) Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are
  a major component of the immune infiltrate in solid tumors. Chronic inflammation
  within the TME and production of IL-4 and IL-13 by TH2 cells and IL-10 by TRegs
  induce pro-tumorigenic macrophage polarization. In turn, TAMs exacerbate immune
  suppression by releasing cytokines such as IL-10 and TGFβ that suppress TEff and
  NK cells but stimulate TRegs. Pro-tumorigenic TAMs also up-regulate metabolic enzymes
  such as IDO-1 and Arg-1, which can severely affect the composition of the immune
  infiltrate by competing for catabolism of nutrients. In addition, TAMs can directly
  inhibit T-cells by expressing immune checkpoint ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. (3) Myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells
  that accumulate in response to chronic inflammation and fail to differentiate into
  mature cells. MDSCs secrete significant levels of IL-10 and TGFβ, thereby inducing
  TReg accumulation and pro-tumorigenic macrophage polarization, while simultaneously
  inhibiting TEff and NK cells function and activation. Furthermore, MDSCs promote
  metabolic stress by dramatically depleting nutrients needed for T-cell function.
  (4) Oncogenic events can directly and indirectly inhibit immune response by multiple
  mechanisms: a) Numerous cytokines secreted by tumor cells, including TGFβ, IL-10
  and the pro-angiogenic molecule VEGF, promote recruitment of immune suppressive
  cells. b) Down-regulation of pro-inflammatory chemokines, including CCL3, CCL4 and
  CCL5, and CXCR3 ligands such as CXCL9 and CXCL10 result in decreased DC and T-cell
  recruitment and impaired T-cell priming/activation. c) Expression of PD-L1 and direct
  inhibition of T-cell effector function by tumor cells has been observed in numerous
  cancer types. PD-L1 can be induced by multiple non-exclusive mechanisms, including
  by cytokines such as type I and II IFNs, TNFα and IL-10, and specific oncogenic
  events, including chromosomal amplification and up-regulation by oncogenic signaling.
  d) Decreased immunogenicity may result from defects in antigen presentation and/or
  defective response to IFNγ, which can occur due to genomic inactivation or downregulation
  of class I MHC and MHC-related molecules (e.g. B2M) or of genes related to the IFNγ
  pathway. e) Tumor cells also exert strong metabolic stress on the immune infiltrate
  by competing for nutrients and secreting byproducts that negatively affect immune
  effector function. (Reviewed on (,,).)'
