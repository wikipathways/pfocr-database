caption: Simplified scheme of the enzymes and transcription factors involved in de
  novo lipogenesis pathway. Briefly, the enzymes Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase alpha (Acaca),
  Fatty acid synthase (Fasn), Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 6,
  (Elovl6), and Stearoyl-CoenzimeA desaturase, (Scd1) participate directly in the
  synthesis and elongation of fatty acids starting from Acetyl-CoA. Liver X receptor
  regulates the transcription of Sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1, (Srebf1),
  which in turn, stimulates the transcription of the enzymes mentioned above to increase
  the lipid biosynthesis in the liver. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  gamma (Pparg), a master regulator of transcription, also affects the expression
  level of the proteins in the de novo lipogenesis process. In the figure the molecules
  studied in this research has been highlighted by bold letters in a square. The blue
  letters are the changes occurring in the maternal liver. In red are the changes
  found in fetal livers.
