caption: cGAS-STING and cell death pathways. cGAS recognizes cytosolic dsDNA released
  from the nucleus, mitochondria or exogenous pathogens, and then catalyzes the conversion
  of GTP and ATP to cGAMP. cGAMP initiates an inflammatory response via the SITNG-TBK1-IRF3-IFN
  and IKK-NF-κB pathways. cGAS-STING also involves in regulating cell death pathways.
  Chronic activation of STING increases the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by enhancing
  the interaction of IRF-3 and Bax. STING also activates pyroptosis by initiating
  potassium efflux and upregulating and maintaining NLRP3. On the contrary, activated
  CASP9/3/7/1 will suppress the activation of cGAS-STING pathway and avoid to awaking
  the antitumor immunity. Moreover, STING also regulates necroptosis through ZBP1-RIPK3-MLKL
  axis. Furthermore, STING also activate autophagy independent of TBK1 and IFN by
  translocating to ERGIC and Golgi, which leads to LC3 lipidation and autophagosome
  formation. cGAS, GMP-AMP synthase; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; cGAMP, cyclic GMP-AMP;
