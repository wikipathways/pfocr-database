caption: A) C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis – Upon uptake into the host cell, the
  infectious elementary body (EB) of C. pneumoniae forms the inclusion body. The early
  inclusion body associates with Rab4, Rab11, and Rab14 through unknown mechanisms.
  Subsequently, EBs differentiate into the non-infectious replicative bodies (RB).
  At this later stage the inclusion is associated with Rab11 through direct interaction
  with the C. pneumoniae inclusion protein Cpn0508. As a result, the Rab11 adaptor
  proteins Rab11FIP2 (FIP2) is recruited leading to recruitment of Rab14 to the inclusion
  body and interaction with the actin motor protein Myosin Vb. The developmental cycle
  of infection of C. trachomatis is similar to C. pneumoniae. Rab4 is recruited to
  the early inclusion by the C. trachomatis inclusion protein CT229. The Rab11-FIP2-Rab14
  complex is also recruited to the inclusion body, but it is unclear if it facilitates
  interactions with the cytoskeleton.B) S. flexneri – The nascent vacuole containing
  S. flexneri associates with Rab11-positive macropinosomes. Recruitment of macropinosomes
  is critical for vacuolar rupture and escape of S. flexneri into the cytosol. The
  effector protein IpgD, a PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase, is responsible for recruitment of
  Rab11-positive macropinosomes to the invasion site. In the absence of IpgD, Rab11-positive
  macropinosomes are not recruited and instead the vacuole becomes enclosed in an
  actin cage. S. flexneri effector IpaB is thought to directly bind cholesterol to
  induce formation of Rab11 positive compartments while the bacterium enters a replicative
  state.C) S. enterica serovar Typhimurium – replicates within the Salmonella-containing
  vacuole (SCV). The SCV matures to resemble a late endosome, but does not fuse with
  lysosomes. The SCV interacts with endocytic recycling pathways through the early
  recruitment of Rab4 and Rab11. The cell adhesion molecule CD44 is recycled from
  the SCV back to the plasma membrane through a Rab11-dependent pathway. The effector
  SopB, a PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase, prevents Rab35 recruitment to the SCV by modifying
  the SCV’s surface charge.D) Uropathogenic E. coli – can reside within a vacuole
  that co-localizes with Rab35 and the transferrin receptors, a major transporter
  of iron within the host cell. UPEC is also capable of being expelled from the cell
  without damage to the bacterium or the host. TLR4 present on the vacuole interacts
  with Sec6 and Sec15 which recruit Rab11a and Rab27b to the UPEC-containing vacuole.
  Rab11a can then bind its adaptor protein Rab11FIP3 (FIP3) to recruit the actin motor
  protein Myosin VIIa while Rab27b recruits the microtubule motor protein dynein through
  its adaptor protein MyRIP.E) L. pneumophila – The Legionella-containing vacuole
  (LCV) associates with Rab4a, Rab11a and Rab14 through an unknown mechanism. The
  effector protein AnkX phosphocholinates Rab35 preventing activation by the cognate
  GEF, Connecdenn, and thereby inhibiting Rab35 activation. A mutant of L. pneumophila
  missing five of its genomic islands encoding effector proteins (Δpentuple) still
  recruited Rab4a, Rab11a and Rab14 and did not prevent Rab35 recruitment.
