caption: Summary of heterologous production of 5-HTP. Chromobacterium violaceum, with
  the first use of PAH for tryptophan hydroxylation to 5-HTP. Escherichia coli, with
  a) utilization of MH4 instead of BH4 as the native pterin coenzyme for 5-HTP synthesis,
  b) the biosynthesis of 5-HTP with the use of a novel salicylate 5-hydroxylase that
  uses glucose as the substrate for the production of the non-natural substrate anthranilate
  to 5-hydroxyanthranilate (5-HI), c) substitution of the promoter of aroHfbr gene
  encoding 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase to feed the biosynthetic pathway
  of tryptophan production. The use of yeasts with the heterologous expression of
  either a prokaryotic PAH or eukaryotic tryptophan 3/5-hydroxylase, together with
  enhanced synthesis of the two cofactors MH4 or BH4; the native Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  gene, DFR1, which encodes dihydrofolate reductase to catalyze tetrahydrofolate,
  plays a pivotal role in 5-HTP synthesis by regenerating MH4. Created with BioRender.com.
