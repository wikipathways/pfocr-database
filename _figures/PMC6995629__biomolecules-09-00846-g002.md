caption: 'Cellular anti-cancer/anti-tumor effects of metformin: The hydrophilic and
  cationic metformin is transported into the cell via the organic cation transporters
  (OCT), which support the intracellular accumulation of metformin. The anti-proliferative
  activity of metformin in several cancers is at least in part attributed to its ability
  to reduce the levels of insulin/IGF1, which in turn inhibits the insulin/IGF1 mediated
  molecular pathways that support tumor initiation and progression. Metformin treatment
  directly activates AMPK and the ‘AMPK dependent’ effects include inhibition of c-Myc,
  NF-κB, and mammalian target of rapamycin-C1 (mTORC1) pathways and acetyl Co-A carboxylase
  (ACC)-dependent lipogenesis pathways while activating the p53 pathway and DICER-mediated
  miRNA synthesis. Metformin, albeit at high concentrations, is also known to inhibit
  the mitochondrial Complex 1 of the electron transport chain (ETC) thereby reducing
  ATP, levels which increases the AMP/ATP ratio further leading to AMPK activation.
  A decrease in ATP/energy levels can also lead to mismanaged protein folding mechanisms
  leading to the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins and prolonged unfolded
  protein response (UPR) without rectification of endoplasmic stress triggers apoptosis
  through multiple mechanisms, which include activation of UPR mediated apoptotic/death
  signaling and activation of autophagy and subsequent autophagic cell death. AMPK
  independent metformin treatment-associated anti-cancer effects are mediated by Rag
  GTPases, REDD1, and STAT3. Overall metformin treatment in cancer cells causes translational
  inactivation, cell-cycle arrest, inactivation of cell proliferation and migration,
  inhibition of UPR, promotes apoptosis, inhibits EMT, invasion, and metastasis, and
  increases susceptibility to chemotherapy/radiation therapy.'
