caption: Genomic alterations in signaling molecules that interact with the VEGF angiogenesis
  pathway at baseline. Percentages of HER2−/HR+ and TNBC tumors (represented on the
  left and right of each module diagram, respectively) with alterations in signaling
  molecules that interact with the angiogenesis pathway are shown. Blue highlights
  the presence of inactivating mutations while red highlights the presence of activating
  mutations within that gene. The arrows describe whether the interactions are activating
  or inhibitory upon downstream signaling molecules. Sunitinib and bevacizumab have
  direct inhibitory effects on certain targets within the signaling cascades which
  are marked by the symbols. HER2− human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative;
  HR+ hormone receptor positive; TNBC triple-negative breast cancer; VEGF vascular
  endothelial growth factor
