caption: Summary by schematic illustration. The histone of the Zac1 promoter in untreated
  EC cells was hypo-acetylated, which repressed Zac1 gene transcription. HDAC inhibitors
  induced histone acetylation and increased Zac1 expression. Zac1 protein bound to
  the NF-κB p65 subunit and inhibited its phosphorylation at Ser468 and Ser536, leading
  to suppression of NF-κB activity and induction of cell apoptosis. The reverse process,
  as indicated by a dashed arrow, shows a potential pathway that maintains NF-κB activity
  and is important for cancer cell survival. High levels of HDAC or HDAC activity
  maintained the Zac1 promoter in a hypo-acetylated state and thus suppressed Zac1
  expression, which accounted for the relatively high phosphorylation levels at Ser468
  and Ser536 residues of p65 protein and the relatively high NF-κB activity
papertitle: Zac1 is a histone acetylation-regulated NF-κB suppressor that mediates
  histone deacetylase inhibitor-induced apoptosis.
