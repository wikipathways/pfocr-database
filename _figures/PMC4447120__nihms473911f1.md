caption: AMPK is a negative regulator of the Warburg effect in Fumarate hydratase-deficient
  kidney cancer. Fumarate hydratase (FH)-deficient kidney cancer, characterized by
  impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and undergoes a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis
  to generate ATP required for the increased energetic demands of rapidly proliferating
  cells. The increased glycolysis suppresses expression and activation of AMPK which
  results in increased S6 and ACC activity, promoting anabolic growth and proliferation.
  Decreased AMPK results in decreased p53 and the iron transporter, DMT1. The iron
  responsive proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, as well as the IRP target, transferrin receptor
  protein 1 (TFRC) are elevated, indicating that cytosolic iron concentrations decrease
  secondary to decreased DMT1 activity. Prolyl hydroxylase, which is sensitive to
  iron levels, would be inhibited by decreased cytosolic iron levels, stabilizing
  HIF1α. Fumarate, which increases in FH-deficient cells, has been shown to inhibit
  prolyl hydroxylase, which would lead to further stabilization of HIF1α, increasing
  transcription of factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the
  glucose transporter, GLUT1. Increased fumarate has been shown to succinate KEAP1,
  thus altering it's conformation and disrupting its ability to induce degradation
  of Nrf2. Nrf2 transcription is increased activating anti-oxidant response and protecting
  against oxidative stress. Increased HIF1α would stimulate LDHA, increasing lactate
  production, and would stimulate PDK1, which inhibits PDH and would decrease entry
  of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. FH-deficient kidney cancer use a glutamine-dependent
  reductive carboxylation rather than rather than oxidative metabolism for citrate
  formation (red arrows). Glutamine is the major source for the increased fatty acid
  synthesis required for rapid proliferation in these cells with disabled normal oxidative
  phosphorylation. Potential approaches for treatment of this aggressive form of kidney
  cancer include agents that stimulate AMPK, agents that target the tumor vasculature
  and glucose transport, agents that inhibit LDHA and agents that target the critical
  glutamine-dependent reductive fatty acid/lipid synthetic pathway.
