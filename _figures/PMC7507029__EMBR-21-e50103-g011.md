caption: Under nutrient‐rich conditions, LRP6 is O‐GlcNAcylated and it maintains its
  interaction with Merlin. In this situation, YAP is activated and its target genes
  are expressed. In nutrient starvation, the O‐GlcNAcylation of LRP6 is lower and
  Merlin is detached from LRP6, followed by lysosomal degradation of LRP6. Merlin
  then binds to LATS1/2, allowing LATS1/2 to be activated by upstream kinases such
  as MST1/2 and MAP4K4/6/7. Activated LATS1/2 phosphorylates and inactivates YAP,
  thereby decreasing the expression of YAP target genes.
