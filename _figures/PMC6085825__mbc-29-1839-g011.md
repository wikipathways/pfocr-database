caption: 'Working model for ADAM12 during proliferation in preadipocytes. Active ADAM12
  cleaves IGFBP3 and IGFBP5 to release the potent regulator of growth IGF into the
  extracellular matrix (). IGF is free to bind to IGFR on the cell surface stimulating
  proliferation of preadipocytes through the mTOR signaling pathway. Knockdown of
  ADAM12 results in reduced proliferation and regulation of the IGF1 mTOR signaling
  pathway. We propose knockdown of ADAM12 results in reduced cleavage of IGFBP, particularly
  IGFBP3 and IGFBP5, to make IGF1 available to IGFR on the cell surface reducing mTOR
  signaling and proliferation of preadipocytes. (ADAM12: a disintegrin and metalloprotease
  12; IGFBP3: insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3; IGFBP5: insulin-like growth
  factor binding protein 5; IGF: insulin growth factor; IGFR: insulin growth factor
  receptor; mTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin).'
