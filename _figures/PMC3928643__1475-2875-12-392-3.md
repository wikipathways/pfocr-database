caption: IFNα/β and IL-4 centred pathway analysis. A IFN-αβ centred pathway analysis.
  Network analysis was performed by using IFN-α and IFN-β as the central nodes. This
  study used software to select IFN-α or IFN-β related genes from the gene list. 24
  IFN-α or IFN-β related genes were selected. Red entities mean proteins. Green entities
  mean small molecules including phospholipids and drugs. Hexon means groups of family
  proteins. A---B means A binds to B to form a complex. A- → B means A binds B’s promoter
  region to up-regulate B. A-- + - > B means A induces B release. A---|B means A causes
  B’s degradation or inhibition. Little square in the middle of the line means there
  is a third molecule which regulates the conversion from A to B. B IL-4 centred pathway
  analysis. Network analysis was performed by using IL-4 as the central nodes. This
  study used software to select IL-4 related genes from the gene list. Only four IL-4
  related genes were selected.
