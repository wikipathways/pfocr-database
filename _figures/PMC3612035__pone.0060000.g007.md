caption: CSN-CRL4A/4BCDT2 is required in two different steps of the DNA replication
  during a normal cell cycle. (A) At the G1/S transition CSN-CRL4A/4BCDT2 is required
  to prevent DNA origins re-firing by means of a variety of molecular mechanisms.
  Failure to do so causes DNA re-replication, DSBs and ATM signaling activation. Eventually,
  DSBs are repaired and cells with re-replicated DNA re-enter the cell cycle and divide.
  Mitosis of cells with re-replicated DNA causes chromosomal aberrations that may
  drive tumorigenesis. Following origins firing, replication-linked DNA damage activates
  regulative loops between the ATR- dependent checkpoint and PRR. Inactivation of
  this pathway causes permanent replication stress, ATR hyper-signaling and eventually
  apoptosis. The relevance of this pathway makes it a pharmacological target to potentially
  induce replication stress and apoptosis in cancer cells. (B) CSN-CRL4A/4BCDT2 regulates
  RAD18 recruitment to chromatin, possible in cooperation with Spartan, in a feed-forward
  loop leading to the amplification of PCNA ubiquitylation and consequent error-free
  and error-prone TLS. CSN-CRL4A/4BCDT2 may also contributes to the amplification
  of PCNA ubiquitylation by directly mono-ubiquitylating PCNA.
