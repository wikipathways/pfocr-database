caption: Role of PP2A and TBLR1 in WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway. a. beta-catenin
  is phosphorylated by the degradation complex (DC) with PP2A and HSP105 as its components,
  and it undergoes phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination without the stimulus wnt
  and degraded by proteasome. b. The accumulation of beta-catenin induced by the stimulus
  wnt. c. The co-repressors TLE1 and HDAC1 repress the wnt target genes. d. TBL1-TBLR1
  and beta-catenin recruit each to remove co-repressors TLE1 and HDAC1 and activate
  the transcription of wnt target genes. This figure is our own
