caption: Upon ligand binding the phosphorylation of ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  activation motif) associated with the adaptor protein DAP12 (DNAX activation protein
  of 12 kDa) occurs resulting in the recruitment and activation of Syk (spleen tyrosine
  kinase). Syk phosphorylates a battery of downstream kinases that activates NF-κβ
  and facilitates its nuclear translocation where it functions as a transcription
  factor for a panel of pro-inflammatory genes. TLR (toll-like receptor) signaling
  also integrates with TREM-1 pathway via NF-κβ signaling. All these events result
  in inflammation.
