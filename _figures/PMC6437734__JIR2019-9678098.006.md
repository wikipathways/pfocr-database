caption: VPA induces apoptosis in neutrophils and diminishes their phagocytic capacity.
  VPA induces apoptosis in neutrophils in response to LPS, by increasing annexin A1
  release. Additionally, VPA on its own can alter the mitochondrial membrane potential
  and increase activation of the both caspase 9 and caspase 3, which activate the
  apoptosis intrinsic pathway. Furthermore, VPA impedes proliferation by stopping
  the cells in the G0/G1 cell cycle phase. Finally, VPA reduces their phagocytic and
  antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus. Green arrows indicate the
  processes, molecules, or mediators in the signaling pathway that are augmented and/or
  promoted by VPA. Red arrows indicate processes, molecules, or mediators in the signaling
  pathway that are inhibited by VPA.
