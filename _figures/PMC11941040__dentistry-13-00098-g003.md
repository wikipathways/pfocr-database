caption: Mechanisms of acute inflammation and molecular pathways induced by red complex
  bacteria and Fusobacterium nucleatum in endothelial cells. This figure depicts the
  interactions between Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola,
  Fusobacterium nucleatum, and endothelial cells, highlighting their molecular mechanisms.
  The bacteria attach to endothelial cells via specific receptors and release virulence
  factors that activate pathways such as TLR-NF-κB, MAPK, MyD88, and PI3K signaling.
  These activations result in the upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1
  (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, P-selectin, and
  inflammatory cytokines, leading to enhanced adhesion molecule expression and chemokine
  secretion. Degradation of ApoB-100, aggregation of ox-LDL, and foam cell generation
  contribute to atherosclerosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, antioxidant
  depletion, reduced nitric oxide levels, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis via BAX protein
  activation further exacerbate endothelial dysfunction. Upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines promotes vascular damage, linking these mechanisms
  to the progression of atherosclerosis (the figure is created in BioRender.com)
