caption: Photoreduction with bisulfite may proceed via competing mechanisms in (a)
  and (b). In (a), photolysis of the thioanhydronucleoside occurs before reduction,
  providing different intermediates in the reduction of N9-thioanhydroadenosine 62
  and N7-thioanhydroadenosine 63, and thus different outcomes. In (b), reduction of
  62 and 63 is effected by a photochemically generated hydrated electron, resulting
  in different radical anion intermediates and different reaction outcomes. (c) Stable
  encounter complexes of the thioanhydroadenosines and hydrosulfide such as 77 were
  calculated, and allow the reduction to proceed for regioisomers 62 and 62 in a similar
  fashion, with radical anion 75 and its N7-regioisomer as intermediates (mechanism
  for 63 not shown). (d) Photoreduction (300 nm) of 67a to generate 64a presumably
  proceeds via the mechanism calculated by Powner et al. for related ribo- and arabino-8-mercaptopurine
  nucleosides 67b–g. The yield of ribo- and ara-inosine (64f and 64g) was low because
  of a competitive photodecomposition pathway via 80. CT = charge transfer.
