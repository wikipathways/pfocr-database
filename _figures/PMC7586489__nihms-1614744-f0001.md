caption: Oxidative stress leads to the formation of oxidized DNA base lesions, i.e.,
  8-oxoGs, in a CTG repeat tract. OGG1 removes 8-oxoGs leaving an abasic site that
  is 5′-incised by APE1. In the scenario where a base lesion occurs at the 5′-end
  of the repeat tract, Pol β performs multi-nucleotide gap-filling DNA synthesis to
  pass through the template hairpin, whereas FEN1 cleavage of the repeats is inhibited
  by the hairpin. This results in repeat expansions (the pathway on the left). On
  the other hand, a base lesion located in the middle of CTG repeats results in the
  formation of an upstream hairpin and a downstream hairpin along with two hairpins
  on the template. The upstream hairpin inhibits pol β DNA synthesis. The downstream
  hairpin is converted into a flap that is efficiently cleaved by FEN1, leading to
  repeat deletions (the pathway on the right) ().
