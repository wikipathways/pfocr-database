caption: This schematic diagram demonstrates the inducing effect of CDH17 on Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
  signaling pathway and illustrates the hypothetic involvement of integrins in GC.
  CDH17 indirectly affects integrins to stabilize their structure and activity. The
  up-regulation of cadherin-integrin signaling activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
  The activation of ERK regulates various nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates, including
  p53 and p21, which involve in diverse cellular responses, such as cell proliferation,
  migration, adhesion, colony formation, cell-cycle and apoptosis.
