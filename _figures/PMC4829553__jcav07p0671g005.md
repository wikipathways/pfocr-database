caption: Genes positively and negatively connected to the expression of Egfr in the
  mouse liver. The 16 nodes in the graph below show the selected traits. All the nodes
  are displayed. The graph's canvas is 40.0 by 40.0 cm; the node labels are drawn
  with a 16.0 point font, and the edge labels are drawn with a 16.0 point font. A.
  Genes positively and negatively connected to the expression of Egfr in the male
  liver. The 69 edges between the nodes, filtered from the 120 total edges and drawn
  as curves, show Pearson correlation coefficients greater than 0.5 or less than -0.5.
  B. Gene network based on the expression level in the female liver for genes that
  are positively and negatively connected to the expression of Egfr. The 35 edges
  between the nodes, filtered from the 120 total edges and drawn as curves, show Pearson
  correlation coefficients greater than 0.5 or less than -0.5.
