caption: Overview of canonical WNT signaling. (A) OFF State. The absence of WNT ligands
  and the presence of antagonists such as DKK family members are associated with the
  inactive state of the pathway. The β-catenin destruction complex, formed by the
  scaffolding proteins AXIN and APC, and the kinases CK1α and GSK3, promotes the β-catenin
  phosphorylation, triggering its ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP
  and its proteosomal degradation. (B) ON State. R-spondin (RSPO) and WNT ligands
  activate the pathway. RSPO binds both the ring finger proteins RNF43/ZNRF3 and the
  LGR receptor to form a ternary complex which is rapidly endocytosed. WNT glycoproteins
  are then able to bind Frizzled and LRP5/6 coreceptors, forming the WNT–FZD–LRP5/6
  trimeric complex which recruits the scaffold protein Dishevelled (DVL) which itself
  polymerizes to bind AXIN. This promotes the formation of LRP6 signalosomes in which
  LRP6 is phosphorylated by CK1 and GSK3 kinases, releasing β-catenin, which accumulates
  and translocates into the nucleus to form an active transcription complex with TCF/LEF
  proteins.
