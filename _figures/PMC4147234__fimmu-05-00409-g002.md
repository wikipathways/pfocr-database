caption: The mTOR pathway in T cells. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is
  a component of both the TORC1 and TORC2 signaling complexes. The TORC1 complex acts
  as the main integrator of many different signals (input signals shown in blue text)
  from nutrients such as glucose, via TORC2, the TCR, costimulation and growth factors,
  via PI3K and AKT, and amino acids via the regulator complex. Hypoxia and AMP levels
  are also sensed via AMPK and TSC1/2. AKT activation downstream of TORC2 is important
  for cell survival, drives the expression of the glucose receptor (Glut1) and glycolytic
  metabolism, and is required for the differentiation into Th2 cells (outputs of signaling
  shown outlined in red). TORC1 is important for the initiation of mRNA translation
  via S6K1 mediated phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6, and the up-regulation
  of amino acid transporters at the cell surface. TORC1 also activates lipid oxidation
  and cell proliferation while it inhibits the expression of FOXP3 and Treg differentiation
  in favor of Th1 and Th17 cells. The sites where three different clinically available
  drugs (rapamycin, fingolimod, and metformin) impact on the mTOR pathway are indicated
  (orange boxes).
