caption: B19V infection of human erythroid progenitor cells (B19V life cycle). When
  human erythroid progenitor cells are infected with B19V, the virus initially interacts
  with P antigen (globoside) (step 1), the primary low-affinity attachment sugar molecule
  on the cell surface. This interaction confers a conformational change of VP1, extruding
  itself on the surface of the virion instead of remaining embedded inside the virion
  (step 2). The VP1u region on the virion then binds a putative cellular surface receptor
  (VP1u-interacting protein), which mediates internalization of the virion inside
  the cells, presumably by endocytosis (step 3). Virions undergo several steps of
  intracellular trafficking in the endosome, are eventually released from the endosome
  through a function of the PLA2 motif of VP1u, and enter the nucleus (step 4). In
  the nucleus, the virion is uncoated and releases either a positive-sense ssDNA or
  a negative-sense ssDNA (−ssDNA) genome (step 5). The ssDNA genome, shown as negative-sense
  ssDNA, is first converted into dsDNA that is primed by the 3′ OH of the left-hand
  ITR (step 6), a process that requires cellular DNA polymerase (DNA Pol) and other
  DNA replication factors. Phosphorylated STAT5 (p-STAT5), which is activated through
  the Epo/Epo-R/Jak2/STAT5 pathway, is required for viral DNA replication. After dsDNA
  conversion, NS1 binds NSBEs and nicks one of the strands at the trs (step 7a). This
  event creates a new 3′ OH to lead DNA synthesis following melting of the hairpinned
  ITR, which subsequently repairs the ITR and results in an open-ended duplex replicative
  intermediate (step 7b). The repaired ITR is then denatured (step 7c), which likely
  requires the helicase activity of NS1, and is reannealed, in a process termed reinitiation,
  to form a double-hairpinned intermediate, which creates a new 3′ primer (3′ OH)
  to initiate a round of strand displacement synthesis (step 7d). The RF DNA is capable
  of transcription of viral mRNA by cellular RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II). Various
  B19V mRNAs are generated through alternative processing of the pre-mRNA (step 9)
  and are exported to the cytoplasm (step 10). Capsid proteins; VP1 and VP2; and the
  NS1, 11-kDa, and 7.5-kDa nonstructural proteins are translated in the cytoplasm
  (step 11). VP1 and VP2 are assembled as trimers (capsid precursors), which are transported
  into the nucleus (step 12a) to assemble empty capsids (step 13). A viral ssDNA genome
  is presumably produced through a process called strand displacement (step 7e), when
  an empty capsid is available, through a putative NS1-mediated packaging mechanism
  (step 14). NS1 is transported to the nucleus (step 12b) and is essential for viral
  DNA replication. NS1 also induces cell cycle arrest at G2 phase. Finally, apoptosis
  is induced, in which both NS1 and the 11-kDa protein play important roles (step
  16). Apoptosis releases the matured virion from infected cells through the broken
  nuclear membrane (step 15). As noted, steps 6, 7, and 12 to 14 are partially hypothetical.
