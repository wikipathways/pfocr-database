caption: These pathways are important for the generation of the major surface active
  component of the lung surfactant. Lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) is produced by
  hydrolysis of the sn-2 acyl bond of phosphatidylcholine (PC) through the PLA2 activity
  of Prdx6. LysoPC can be further degraded by various enzymes; the choline phosphate
  moiety is conserved and used along with two palmitates for DPPC synthesis by the
  de novo pathway. sn-1Palmitoyl lysoPC also can be re-acylated with a palmitoyl CoA
  by the LPCAT activity of Prdx6 (remodeling pathway) to generate DPPC.
