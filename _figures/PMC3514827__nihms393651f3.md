caption: Here we summarize the findings discussed in this review. In short, colorectal
  cancer can be treated by targeting transcription factors that down-regulate the
  vitamin d receptor, which is essential in order for vitamin d to mediate its effects
  in promoting an epithelial phenotype. Furthermore, we show that their our potential
  preventative measures to protect individuals from colon cancer, such as increasing
  serum levels of 25(OH)D3 by either sun exposure, diet or supplements.
