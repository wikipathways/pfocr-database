caption: 'Functional prions in immune signaling. In mammals, receptors such as RIG-I
  and NLRP3 induce the prion conversion of their respective adaptors MAVS and ASC,
  which then rapidly polymerize leading to protective cytokine secretion and cell
  death. In filamentous fungi, a homologous pathway depends on the NWD2 protein, which
  likely converts the downstream HET-S/s protein into a prion to induce cell death.
  The fungal NWD2/HET-S/s pathway shares remarkable similarities to the mammalian
  NLRP3/ASC inflammasome in function and organization. Abbreviations: ASC, apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain; CARD,
  caspase activation and recruitment domain; CTD, C-terminal domain; LLR, leucine-rich
  repeat; MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral signalling; NLRP3, NLR family, pyrin domain
  containing 3; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible gene I.'
