caption: 'Carotenoid metabolic pathway. Expression levels of DEGs are reported in
  red–green scaled boxes, while the accumulation of DAMs is reported in blue–red scaled
  boxes. For each transcript/metabolite, the abundance level is represented by a heat
  map, where the blocks shown from left to right represent the three stages of the
  peel and pulp: green fruiting (S1), color change (S2), and ripening (S3)'
