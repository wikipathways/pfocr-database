caption: 'After insulin binds with IR, the activation of many tyrosine residues occur
  by auto phosphorylation. These phospho-tyrosine residues are important for IRS-1/IRS-2,
  since they initiate several signaling cascades such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K), GSK3ß signaling, mitochondrial regulation for energy production, and wnt
  signaling cascades. The PI3K pathway is associated with almost all metabolic functions
  of insulin [-], converting the phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3). Then, PIP3 captures protein kinase B (PKB, also known
  as Akt) to the plasma membrane, where it is activated by phosphorylation carried
  out by specific kinases []. PKB would connect the IRs at the cell surface with enzymes
  of glycogen metabolism in the interior of the cell through GSK3ß phosphorylation,
  observing that inhibitors of GSK3ß mimic the action of insulin on glycogen synthesis
  []. One of the main features of insulin resistance is IRS-1 serine phosphorylation
  []. The mechanism associated with insulin resistance would be the following: insulin
  signaling is blocked by the activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway
  by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which then causes the serine phosphorylation
  of IRS-1 by various stress-sensitive kinases [, ]. Serine phosphorylation of IRS-1
  then inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its subsequent binding of
  PI3K, which is normally induced by insulin stimulation [], blocking insulin signaling
  within the cell. (A higher resolution / colour version of this figure is available
