caption: The serotonin metabolic pathway. Tryptophan (Trp, shown in green), an essential
  amino acid, is metabolized in the presynaptic neuron and microglia by tryptophan
  hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), respectively. TPH2 hydroxylates
  Trp into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP, shown in red), which is then converted into
  serotonin (5-HT, shown in blue) by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). Vesicular
  monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2, shown in yellow) facilitates the packaging of 5-HT
  into synaptic vesicles and the subsequent release of 5-HT into the synaptic cleft.
  5-HT in the synaptic cleft binds to serotonin receptors (5-HTR) on the postsynaptic
  neuron, leading to the activation of cell signalling pathways and contributing to
  the regulation of mood, memory, anxiety, and depression. 5-HT levels in the synaptic
  cleft are regulated by the serotonin transporter (SERT, shown in purple), which
  facilitates the reuptake of 5-HT into the presynaptic neuron. 5-HT is broken down
  in the presynaptic neuron by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A, shown in orange) to form
  the waste product 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA).
