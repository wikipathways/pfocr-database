caption: A model for the role of HtrABb through proteolysis of P66, Hbb, and three
  enzymes of the glycolytic pathway in a potential decrease in metabolic activity
  of B. burgdorferi. Proteolytic degradation of P66 could limit the amount of essential
  nutrients required for motility or for production of energy. Proteolytic degradation
  of glycolytic enzymes could result in a decrease of energy-producing molecules.
  The combined net effect of proteolysis of P66 and enzymes would be to prepare B. burgdorferi
  for the stage that requires lower metabolic activity.
