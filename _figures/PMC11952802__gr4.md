caption: Regulation of periosteal microenvironment on P-SSCs. (A) Damage to the periosteal
  vasculature results in oxygen deprivation, which promotes the expression of Runx2
  in P-SSCs. (B) Sensory nerves secrete NGF, activating TrkA and facilitating ossification
  by PSSCs. (C) Mg2⁺ stimulates sensory nerves to secrete CGRP, which activates CREB1,
  promoting the expression of Runx2/Osx and ossification by PSSCs. (D) Trap+ periosteal
  macrophages secrete factors that interact with PDGFRβ in P-SSCs, activating the
  Pi3K–Akt–CREB pathway and enhancing ossification. (E) Overexpression of Hox11 does
  not enhance the proliferative capacity of P-SSCs; however, it converts CD200−CD105+
  periosteal progenitor cells into P-SSCs, thereby increasing their population. (F)
  SFRP4 promotes ossification by PSSCs through antagonism of the Wnt signaling pathway
  or local inhibition of the Ror2-JNK signal. (Created with BioRender.com.) CGRP,
  calcitonin gene-related peptide; CREB1, cAMP responsive element binding protein
  1; Hox11, homology box 11; NGF, nerve growth factor; Osx, osterix; PDGFRβ, platelet-derived
  growth factor receptor β; P-SSCs, periosteal skeletal stem cells; Runx2, runt-related
  transcription factor 2; TrkA, tropomyosin-related kinase A.; SFRP4, secreted frizzled
  receptor protein 4
