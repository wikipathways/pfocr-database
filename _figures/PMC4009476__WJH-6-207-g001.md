caption: 'Mechanisms of hepatic fibrogenesis. A: The proposed sources of hepatic myofibroblasts:
  Resident cells (hepatic stellate cells and portal fibroblasts); bone marrow-derived
  mesenchymal cells, and EMT from hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Different insults
  initiate inflammation and then cause hepatocyte stellate cells activation and hepatocyte
  and biliary cell damage, necrosis and EMT. Continuous insults will shift those EMT-like
  cells to complete EMT cells and finally myofibroblasts, the main producer of extracellular
  matrix, which may be one of the main causes of an early loss of regenerative capacity.
  A similar process also occurs in biliary cells. Some cytokines play an important
  role to affect the adjacent cells and promote EMTs, such as TGF-β1 (B); B: Schematic
  presentation of the major intracellular signal transduction pathways of TGF-β1 in
  liver fibrosis. TGF-β1 is a chief inducer of the EMT process, and p-Smad2/3, p38
  MAPK and ILK function as mediators of the intracellular signaling pathway. TGF-β1
  signals via heteromeric transmembrane complexes of type I and type II receptors
  that are endowed with intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity (ALK activin receptor-like
  kinase). Upon type-II-mediated phosphorylation of the type I receptor, the activated
  type I receptor initiates intracellular signalling by phosphorylating receptor regulated-Smad2
  and Smad3. Activated Smads form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and these complexes
  accumulate in the nucleus where they mediate transcriptional responses. p-Smad2/3:
  Phosphorylated-Smad2/3; MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase; GSK-3β: Glycogen
  synthase kinase-3β; ILK: Integrin-linked kinase; TCF/LEF-1 complex: T cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer-binding factor-1 complex; EMT: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; TGF:
  Transforming growth factor.'
