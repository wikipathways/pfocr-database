caption: MET amplification causes EGFR-TKI resistance by activating EGFR-independent
  phosphorylation of ErbB3 and downstream activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, providing
  a bypass resistance mechanism in the presence of an EGFR-TKI. MET can also activate
  PI3K/Akt signaling through ErbB3. In EGFRm NSCLCs with MET amplification, EGFR-TKIs
  can still inhibit EGFR phosphorylation but not ErbB3 phosphorylation, leading to
  persistent activation of PI3K/Akt signaling via ErbB3 in an EGFR-independent manner
