caption: miR-155-5p and miR-200a-3p greatly influence TLR4 signaling pathways. miR-155-5p
  and miR-200a-3p targets were obtained and analyzed using the database of the Cancer
  miRNA Regulatory Network [] along with Cytoscape v3.4.0 []. The overall effect of
  miR-155-5p downregulation and miR-200a-3p upregulation is an increased transcription
  of INFA1 and INFA2. Here, the two canonical signaling pathways triggered by TLR4
  activation are shown, one through MYD-88 (with the final production of NFκB and
  AP-1 transcription factors) and the other through TICAMs (and production of IRF-3
  transcription factor). A close analysis reveals that miR-200a-3p inhibits the production
  of AP-1 from MYD88, downregulating that pathway, while miR-155-5p is positively
  affecting interferon expression by activating a series of transcription factors.
  Red boxes indicate our previously described findings [], and dotted rectangles highlight
  the transcription factors directly targeted by these miRNA and directly related
  to interferon gene expression.
