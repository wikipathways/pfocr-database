caption: Multi-target interactions in the replicon assay. Each panel presents a schematic
  of the sterol pathway showing the connection to replicon replication mediated by
  protein prenylation, along with response matrices for combinations representing
  different kinds of mechanistic interactions. Dose matrices, colored to show the
  activity at each dose point, are shown with green markers indicating the targets
  of each combination, and with shape symbols to indicate the type of interaction
  seen (either synergy or epistasis with an arrow indicating the direction of dominance
  from single agent to combination activity). (A) Combinations targeting the top of
  the sterol pathway produced epistatic responses, where the upstream agent's response
  predominates at high concentrations, irrespective of the pro- or antiviral activity
  of the single agents. (B) Targeting the lower end of the pathway led to inhibitory
  synergy in both the replicon and host viability assays, especially when both agents
  were downstream of OSC. (C) Inhibitors of the prenylation pathway interacted weakly
  (close to the SPE expectation) with probes targeting enzymes at the upper end of
  the sterol pathway, but had significant interactions further downstream. The strongest
  synergies were produced in combination with agents targeting enzymes downstream
  of OSC.
