caption: Mitochondrial pathways of electron flow resulting from the substrates and
  inhibitors used in this study. Substrates used were glutamate/malate (which generates
  NADH via the tricarboxylic acid cycle, feeding into complex I), succinate (which
  feeds electrons directly into complex II), and palmitoyl-carnitine (which feeds
  electrons into the ETC via acyl-CoA dehydrogenase as well as through the β-oxidation
  pathway). (For a more thorough explanation, refer to Ref. .) Inhibitors used were
  rotenone (which inhibits at the downstream Q binding site of complex I ()), malonate
  (a competitive inhibitor of complex II (, )), and antimycin A (a complex III inhibitor
  that prevents electron flow to the QI site of complex III, thus stabilizing QH˙
  at the QO site (, )).
