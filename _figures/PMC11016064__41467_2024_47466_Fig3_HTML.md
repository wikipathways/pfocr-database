caption: a Carnitine biosynthetic pathway in animals. HTMLA, the missing enzyme catalyzing
  the second step of the pathway is highlighted in yellow. b Atomic model of the energy-minimized
  conformation of the HTML-PLP external aldimine used for the OSMES procedure. In
  yellow the carbon atoms of HTML, in white the carbon atoms of PLP. Non-carbon atoms
  are colored according to CPK convention. Rotatable bonds are colored in green. c
  Expected geometry of the catalytically favorable conformation of the docked HTML-PLP
  substrate. The Cα-Cβ bond is considered labile when χ1 < χ2 > χ3 and d ≤ 5 Å. Source
  data are provided as a Source Data file.
