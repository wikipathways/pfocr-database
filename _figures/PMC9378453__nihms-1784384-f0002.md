caption: 'Left panel: bacteria acquire pathways for synthesis and export of iron-chelating
  molecules (siderophores) in order to obtain iron from various iron sources in diverse
  ecological niches. The resulting iron–siderophore complexes are bound by surface
  siderophore receptors for transport across the outer membrane (OM). The iron–siderophore
  complex is transferred to a siderophore-binding protein (Sbp), shuttled across the
  periplasmic space, and then transported into the cell by an inner membrane (IM)
  transport complex. Bacteria adapting to different ecological niches and microbial
  communities develop a diversity of additional TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs)
  with similar periplasm to cytoplasm pathways for acquiring iron and other metal
  ions. Middle panel: an ancestral TBDT acquires the ability to bind transferrin and
  remove iron that is transported by an established periplasm to cytoplasm pathway.
  The ancestral TBDT, represented by Tf-binding protein A2 (TbpA2) (lobes in red font),
  was replaced by the more efficient bipartite receptor (right panel). The modern
  day TbpA2 (middle panel, lobes in black font) more recently evolved in the bacteria
  colonizing ruminants (lobes in black font) due to the unique physiological conditions.
  Right panel: the present day bipartite transferrin receptor has the additional surface
  lipoprotein, Tf-binding protein B (TbpB), that is capable of extending from the
  cell surface and capturing iron-loaded Tf and delivering it to TbpA for iron removal
  and uptake, as also illustrated in .'
