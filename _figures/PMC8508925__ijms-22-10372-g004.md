caption: Potential role of cGMP in hepatic encephalopathy. Hyperammonemia reduces
  the function of the glutamate-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway. Activation of NMDA receptors
  leads to increased intracellular calcium in the postsynaptic neuron. Calcium binds
  to calmodulin, which in turn activates function of calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II (CaMKII) by phosphorylation. CaMKII itself phosphorylates neuronal
  NO-synthase, reducing its activity and NO formation. This results in reduced synthesis
  of cGMP, leading to reduced learning ability.  NMDA-receptor; ↑ increased expression;
  ↑↑ markedly increased expression; ↑ increased concentration; ↓ decreased concentration.
