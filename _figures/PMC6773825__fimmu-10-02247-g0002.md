caption: Overview of the main strategies of immunomodulation. (A) In age-related diseases,
  in particular in some metastatic cancers, the use of the monoclonal antibody (such
  as Nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor) alone or in combination with other antagonists (PD-L1
  antibody, like Atezolizumab) shows positive results on T cell activities in older
  adults. These cells became able to respond to the action of their inhibitory receptors
  with a recovery of cytotoxic activity. (B) In old models, with Lack of activity
  of CD8+, it is possible to rejuvenate CD8+ T cell responses in an autophagy dependent
  manner, using the polyamine compound spermidine. Spermidine induces autophagy and
  prolongs lifespan in model organisms. Moreover, in the CD8+/CD45RA+/CCR7− T cells,
  a block at the level of MAPK p38 by sestrins causes age-related signaling defects.
  The knockout of sMAC restores T cell activity (antigen-specific proliferation and
  cytokine production) in older humans, and enhances responsiveness to influenza vaccination
  in old mice. (C) GATOR and RAG A/B GTPase make a sestrin-inhibitory complex that
  involves the mTOR pathway. In particular, sestrins stimulate the activation of AMPK
  (by an unknown mechanism), inhibiting mTORC1 signaling. In addition, mTOR inhibitors,
  i.e., rapamycin and everolimus, are promising treatments for several age-related
  pathologies, including immunosenescence, prolonging lifespan. A soft inhibition
  of mTOR could be beneficial for immune function in older adults, although mTOR activity
  inhibits autophagy, and involves a decrease in the percentage of PD-1 positive T
  cells. See the text for the acronyms.
