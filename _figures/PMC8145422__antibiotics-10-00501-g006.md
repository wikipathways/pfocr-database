caption: Graphical representation of proteins involved in central carbon metabolism
  with altered abundance upon imipenem challenge. The indicated proteins are active
  in the glucose metabolism, pyruvate dehydrogenase, citric acid cycle, or pentose
  phosphate pathway. Boxes marked in yellow represent downregulated proteins, red
  marks upregulated proteins, and gray marks detected proteins that show no regulation
  in the presence of imipenem. Filled bullets mark the main pathway products and open
  bullets mark the intermediate products.
