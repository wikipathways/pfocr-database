caption: Representative medicinal compounds in O. fragrans and their pharmacological
  mechanisms of action. (A) Pathways by which Dio affects MH7A cell apoptosis. Dio
  inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6,
  etc.) induced by D-GalN and can also regulate the Akt/NF-kB pathway. Dio can also
  inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway. PI3k is phosphorylated to generate Akt, and Akt is
  a key molecule in the activation of the NF-κB signalling pathway. Inhibition of
  this pathway reduces cell proliferation and inflammatory cytokine production in
  MH7A cells and promotes apoptosis. (B) Effects of DHQ on the mTORC2/Akt signalling
  pathway under high-glucose conditions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can activate
  the protein kinase PI3K signalling pathway. There are two downstream pathways of
  PI3k. In the one presented here, the PI3k-Akt signalling pathway affects mTORC2
  and mTORC1. PI3k generates PIP3, PIP3 further activates PDK1, PDK1 activates Akt
  through phosphorylation, and Akt further activates mTORC2. DHQ has an inhibitory
  effect on ROS production. After the addition of DHQ, the activity of ROS is reduced,
  the regulatory effect of ROS on the PI3k pathway is weakened, the expression of
  Akt, which is downstream of PI3k, is decreased, and the expression of mTORC2, which
  is downstream of Akt, is inhibited. Akt phosphorylation can regulate GSK3 and reduce
  cell survival to ameliorate diabetic nephropathy in rats. (Red indicates increase/promotion,
  green indicates decrease/inhibition, and yellow indicates promotion of the original
  pathway but inhibition of this pathway.)
