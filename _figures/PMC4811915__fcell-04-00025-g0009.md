caption: Proposed model for the role of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway during odontogenesis.
  Overactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway induces increased FGF expression. This
  may explain the significant increase in dental mesenchyme proliferation that causes
  an increase in tooth size. Based on our data showing increased Dkk1 expression after
  activation of the Wnt pathway, we propose a feedback loop between the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway and Dkk1. Our data confirm that there is a positive inductive
  relationship between Wnt/β-catenin and BMP. Overactivation of canonical Wnt signaling
  causes activation of Bmp4, Nestin and Epfn in the dental mesenchyme, which suggests
  ectopic differentiation of odontoblast-like cells. Based on our results, we propose
  a positive regulation between Wnt/β-catenin and Epfn. Our present results suggest
  the presence of a positive feedback loop between Epfn and Wnt/β-catenin. Similarly,
  our microbead results indicate the existence of a negative feedback loop between
  Epfn and Bmp4.
