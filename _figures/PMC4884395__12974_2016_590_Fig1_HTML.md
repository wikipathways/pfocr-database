caption: Kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. Tryptophan is metabolized to
  kynurenine by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), IDO-like enzyme, IDO2, and tryptophan
  2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). Tryptophan can also be metabolized by tryptophan hydroxylase
  (TrpH) and l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (L-AADC) to serotonin (5-HT) which
  is further broken down by monoamine oxidase (MAO) to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
  (5-HIAA). Kynurenine can be metabolized to kynurenic acid (KA) by one of four isoforms
  of kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT), of which KATI and KATII are most relevant
  to mammals. The production of KA by KATs mainly occurs in astrocytes, cells which
  predominantly express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Alternately, kynurenine
  can be metabolized to 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) by kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO).
  3-HK is metabolized to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) by kynureninase (KYNU)
  and 3-HAA to quinolinic acid (QA) by 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid dioxygenase (HAAO).
  This branch of the kynurenine pathway is compartmentalized in microglia, indicated
  by ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) and CD11b expression. The elevation
  in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor
  necrosis factor α (TNFα), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), during inflammatory conditions
  activates glial cells. Further, IDO expression is up-regulated and flux through
  the neurotoxic kynurenine metabolic branch increases. Underlined targets were assessed
  by real-time RT-PCR to determine changes in mRNA
