caption: Mechanistic pathway of KSHV infection negatively affecting lipoxin secretion.
  KSHV infection apart from upregulating several proinflammatory cell signaling pathways
  and enzymes, such as NF-κB, AKT, FAK, Src, ERK, COX-2, and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO),
  also downregulate anti-inflammatory lipoxins. The KSHV miRNA cluster targets enzyme
  15-LO to reduce lipoxin secretion. The ALX/FPR receptor has been shown to be vital
  for lipoxin signaling since blocking this receptor elevates the levels of NF-κB,
  ERK, and COX-2. Treating cells with lipoxins reduces the levels of KSHV infection-induced
  NF-κB, AKT, and ERK.
