caption: Toward novel ways of MALT1 activation?. ‘The path of reference’ represents
  the classical pathway of MALT1 activation as depicted in . TCR, T-cell receptor;
  BCR, B-cell receptor; CTL-R, C-type lectin receptor. ‘The TNFRSF way…’ is based
  on an understanding of and questions about signaling and NF-κB activation in the
  context of the OX40 pathway. OX40 stimulation leads to the recruitment of TRAF proteins
  at the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, which might enable recruitment of a CBM
  complex via binding of a CARD protein to TRAF2() or lead to recruitment of MALT1
  by TRAF6, perhaps together with BCL10.,  ‘Other paths?’ refers to pathways relying
  on signaling hubs able to recruit TRAF proteins, such as the IL-17R pathway via
  the protein, ACT1, which could potentially attract MALT1 in similar ways as proposed
  for the OX40 pathway. Finally, ‘the viral route’ summarizes the recent findings
  that two viral proteins, K13 and K15, from KSHV can activate MALT1 in a BCL10-dependent
  and likely CARD-independent manner—K13 binds to MALT1, possibly indirectly, whereas
  K15 does not—thus representing potential novel MALT1 activation pathways. CARD#
  represents CARD11 for antigen receptor (TCR/BCR) signaling; CARD9 for C-type-lectin
  (CTL)-receptor signaling and potentially stands for the four CARD/CARMA family proteins
  (CARD9, CARD10, CARD11, CARD14) or isoforms thereof, in case of the hypothesized
  signaling crosstalks depicted in the figure.
