caption: 'LRF/ZBTB7A’s silencing compromises Warburg effect and induces apoptosis
  in cancer cells. The inhibition of aerobic glycolysis and concomitant activation
  of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is promoted by the LRF/ZBTB7A’s silencing
  and the subsequent activation of the expression and phosphorylation of p53, leading
  thus to compromised Warburg effect in cancer cells. Furthermore, LRF/ZBTB7A’s silencing
  induces apoptosis in cancer cell lines by mediating both known apoptotic pathways
  (intrinsic and extrinsic) as well as their cross-talk. That is, upon LRF/ZBTB7A’s
  silencing and the subsequent activation of p53, the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins
  as well as AIF are activated and promote cytochrome c release from mitochondria
  and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (intrinsic apoptotic pathway).
  Meanwhile, LRF/ZBTB7A’s silencing promotes the expression of the Fas receptor (death
  receptor), leading to the activation of the downstream caspase-10 and caspase-8
  and leading thus to activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. In addition,
  caspace-8 further enhances the activation of Bcl2 family members, as well as the
  activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 supporting the hypothesis that LRF/ZBTB7A,
  besides affecting both apoptotic pathways, potentially mediates the cross-talk between
  the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in cancer cells (in red color are
  cellular processes inhibited and in green color are cellular processes activated
  by LRF/ZBTB7A silencing). Abbreviations: AIF, apoptosis inducing factor; FasR, Fas
  receptor; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; SCO2, cytochrome c oxidase 2; TIGAR, TP53-induced
  glycolysis and apoptosis regulator'
