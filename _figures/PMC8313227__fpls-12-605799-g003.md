caption: Regulation networks involving microRNAs functioning in grain size and grain
  weight. Normal arrows indicate the enhanced or positive regulation, and the block
  arrows indicate down-regulation, or negative regulation. The solid lines represent
  interactions supported by scientific evidence, and the dotted lines represent hypothetical
  associations. Yellow indicates the proteins that are involved in microRNA signaling
  pathways. Blue indicates the involvement of ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation,
  and green colored boxes represent the phytohormone pathway.
