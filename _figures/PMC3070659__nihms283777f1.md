caption: Representative axon regeneration-regulating pathways discovered in genetic
  model organisms. (a) In C. elegans, axon injury triggers elevation of intracellular
  Ca2+ and cAMP, and activation of the DLK-1 MAPK cascade and PKA kinase. The DLK-1
  level is negatively regulated by the E3 ligase RPM-1. The transcriptional factors
  CEBP-1 and CRH-1/CREB mediates the effects of these kinases respectively and regulate
  different aspects in axon regeneration. (b) In Drosophila adult CNS, the DLK/Wallenda
  MAPKKK promotes Wallerian degeneration through the JNK signaling. Together with
  PKA, JNK also promotes axon regrowth in sLNv neurons in the fly brain. (c) In Drosophila
  larvae NMJ, the DLK pathway stabilizes synapses after transient cytoskeletal disruption.
  In the presence of persistent cellular stress, the JNK phosphatase Puckered (Puc)
  is also activated and leads to synapse disassembly by antagonizing the JNK signaling.
  (d) In mouse RGCs, the mTOR-dependent protein synthesis is essential for neuron
  survival and axon regrowth after optic nerve injury. Releasing suppression of SOCS3,
  PTEN, or TSC1/2 on this pathway can re-activate the mTOR signaling and promote axon
  regeneration.
