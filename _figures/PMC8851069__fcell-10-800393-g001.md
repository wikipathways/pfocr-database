caption: The activation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Foreign DNA and RNA in cytoplasm
  could be sensed by cGAS, which sub-sequently facilitates the synthesis of cyclic
  GMP-AMP (cGAMP) by binding with GTP and ATP. The integration of cGAMP and STING
  induces STING activation. STING is then switched from the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) to perinuclear endosomes assisted by the Golgi apparatus. STING signaling can
  sense and response to foreign DNA and RNA in cytoplasm. The STIGN-TBK1 compound
  triggers innate immune response via phosphorylating IRF3 or NF-kB.
