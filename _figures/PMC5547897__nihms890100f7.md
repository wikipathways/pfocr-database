caption: Schematic diagram depicting the signalling pathways linking insulin-RBM20-titin
  splicing. Insulin activates the PI3K, and recruits Akt to membrane for phosphorylation
  and activation by PDK1 and mTORC2; activated Akt then activates mTORC1, and in turn
  phosphorylates S6K1 and 4E-BP1 that promote RBM20 expression and thus enhance titin
  exon skipping; PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and KU0063794
  reduce RBM20 expression by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt-mTOR kinase axis, and thus represses
  titin exon skipping; In addition, Akt can directly act on SR proteins or indirectly
  act on SR proteins via kinase SRPK or CLK/Sty. Since RBM20 is a SR protein, we assume
  that posttranslational modifications of RBM20 could be another pathway to regulate
  titin splicing via Akt kinase or the Akt-SRPK/CLK/Sty-SR axis. The dotted lines
  represent a potential mechanism for titin splicing via RBM20, but need be explored
  in future studies.
