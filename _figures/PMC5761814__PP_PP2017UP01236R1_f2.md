caption: TOR-dependent and -independent regulatory pathways for autophagy in plants.
  Autophagy can be activated by abiotic stress, including osmotic, nutrient, salt,
  oxidative, and ER stress. This activation can be regulated in a TOR-dependent or
  -independent manner. A, Upon osmotic, nutrient, or salt stress, the SnRK1 complex
  can inhibit TOR, leading to activation of the ATG1 complex or deactivation of S6K
  and Tap46, in turn activating autophagy. SnRK1 can also activate the ATG1 complex
  by phosphorylation of ATG1, leading to activation of autophagy. B, Upon oxidative
  or ER stress, SnRK1 activates the ATG1 complex, leading to the activation of autophagy.
  Upon ER stress, unfolded proteins accumulate and activate IRE1b, leading to autophagy.
  Ovals represent kinase complexes, hexagons represent TOR targets, and octagons represent
  components of the ER stress response pathway.
