caption: A schematic model delineating the mechanisms of SEC14L3 in ccRCC. In summary,
  knocking down SEC14L3 facilitated the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of RPS3,
  and augmented IκBα accumulation in ccRCC. These events collectively impede the nuclear
  translocation of P65, thereby inhibiting the activation of the NFκB signaling pathway
  and consequently restraining the proliferation and metastasis of ccRCC cells. Furthermore,
  diminished SEC14L3 levels exerted a suppressive effect on NFKB1 expression within
  the NFκB signaling cascade. the inhibited NFKB1, acting as a transcription factor
  in the SEC14L3 promoter and enhancer regions, further suppresses SEC14L3 expression,
  establishing a positive feedback loop of SEC14L3/RPS3/NFκB that collectively exerts
  inhibitory effects on ccRCC progression
