caption: TREM2 molecular signaling in microglia, initiating phagocytosis and microglial
  survival or modulating proinflammatory response, is not well characterized so only
  validated components are displayed. In vitro studies have suggested possible ligands
  for TREM2, which bind TREM2 to initiate signaling. TREM2 associates with DAP12,
  which is phosphorylated to activate signaling through recruitment of spleen tyrosine
  kinase (Syk). Syk activates the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/protein
  kinase C (PKC) pathway to initiate phagocytosis. Microglial survival is initiated
  by the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target
  of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. TREM2 is thought to influence inflammatory
  response by inhibiting the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway which can be activated
  when ligands like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bind toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), initiating
  the production of proinflammatory cytokines.
