  The arrow (→) indicates enhancement, while the barred line (┤) signifies inhibition.
  Lipid metabolism, a complex process, involves the synthesis, cleavage, transport,
  and storage of fats in living organisms. It includes the β-oxidation of fatty acids,
  cholesterol production, and lipoprotein metabolism, all finely regulated by hormones
  such as insulin and glucagon. These are crucial for maintaining energy balance,
  cellular structure, and function. The dysregulation of these pathways can lead to
  obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and other metabolic disorders
