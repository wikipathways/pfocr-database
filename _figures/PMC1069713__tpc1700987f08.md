caption: Model for the Priming Mechanisms behind BABA-IR against Different Biotic
  and Abiotic Stresses.Infection by P. syringae and H. parasitica leads to activation
  of the SA-dependent defense pathway. Treatment with BABA primes for SA-dependent
  defenses, resulting in augmented expression of SA-dependent resistance during infection
  by P. syringae or H. parasitica. The expression of this BABA-IR is marked by enhanced
  expression of the PR-1 gene and enhanced formation of trailing necrosis upon infection
  by P. syringae and H. parasitica, respectively. Infection by H. parasitica also
  activates a defense pathway that leads to callose deposition. Treatment with BABA
  generates a PtdIns- and ABA-dependent priming for this defense response, leading
  to augmented deposition of callose and enhanced resistance against H. parasitica.
  Salt stress activates an ABA-dependent defense response. Treatment with BABA triggers
  a PtdIns-dependent priming for ABA-dependent defenses, causing augmented expression
  of ABA-dependent defenses upon exposure to salt stress. This BABA-induced tolerance
  to salt is marked by enhanced expression of the ABA-inducible genes RAB18 and RD29A.

    and Abiotic Stresses.Infection by P. syringae and H. parasitica leads to activation
    of the SA-dependent defense pathway. Treatment with BABA primes for SA-dependent

    parasitica also activates a defense pathway that leads to callose deposition.
    Treatment with BABA generates a PtdIns- and ABA-dependent priming for this defense
    response, leading to augmented deposition of callose and enhanced resistance against
    H. parasitica. Salt stress activates an ABA-dependent defense response. Treatment
    with BABA triggers a PtdIns-dependent priming for ABA-dependent defenses, causing
    augmented expression of ABA-dependent defenses upon exposure to salt stress. This
    BABA-induced tolerance to salt is marked by enhanced expression of the ABA-inducible
