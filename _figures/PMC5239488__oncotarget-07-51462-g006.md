caption: Schematic diagram depicting the most representative KRAS/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway and its connection to cellular metabolism. Dashed lines refers to complex
  connections not detailed for clarity. Colored boxes refer to metabolites (circle)/proteins
  (rectangle) measured in this study. Arrows indicate metabolite/protein whose level
  is increased/decreased after PI3K inhibitor treatment compared to untreated conditions
  in G12C (red) and WT (blue) KRAS clones compare to untreated conditions. Equal (=)
  sign indicates metabolite/protein whose level does not change after PI3K inhibitor
  treatment in G12C (red) and WT (blue) KRAS clones compare to untreated conditions.
