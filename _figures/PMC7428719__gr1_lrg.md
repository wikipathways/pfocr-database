caption: 'Molecular mechanisms linked to antioxidant/pro-authophagy activities of
  ozone (O3) via Nfr2 signalling.In the absence of stimuli, Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid
  2–related factor 2) binds to its repressor Keap1 (kelch-like ECH-associated protein),
  an adapter between Nrf2 and Cullin 3 (Cul3) protein, which leads to ubiquitination
  followed by proteasome degradation. When O3 is administrated, it dissolves immediately
  and it reacts with PUFA (Poly-Unsaturated Fatty Acids) leading to the formation
  of fundamental messengers such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE)
  and lipid oxidation products (LOPs). These messengers can influence the modifications
  of cysteine residues present in Keap1 (S-HNE or ―S―S) inhibiting ubiquitin conjugation
  to Nrf2 by the Keap1 complex and provoking the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. Once
  in the nucleus, Nrf2 dimerizes and binds to cis-acting DNA AREs (Antioxidant Response
  Elements) in different genes: Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1), Superoxide dismutases (SOD),
  Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST), Catalase (CAT),
  GSH-reductase (GR), NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs),
  Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP450), Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), phase II enzymes
  (UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, UGTs; N-acetyltransferases, NATs, sulfotransferases,
  SULTs).A) O3 involves casein kinase 2 (CK2), a regulator of the Nrf2 activity through
  its phosphorylation, and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signalling pathway,
  that is inhibited with consequent inactivation of oxidative stress and apoptosis
  by O3 administration.B) O3 modulates the degradation protein systems (autophagy),
  via activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) signaling pathway.C) O3 downregulates inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS),
  which generates nitric oxide (NO) via NF-κB (Nuclear Factor Kappa B Subunit 1) pathway.
