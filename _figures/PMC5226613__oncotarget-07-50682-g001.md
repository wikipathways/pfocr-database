caption: In response to changes of nutrients, energy and intracellular calcium and
  calmodulin, LKB1 and CaMK activate AMPK following direct modulation of downstream
  TSC2, raptor and ULK1. The mTOR inhibited by TSC2 or p18 is accompanied with inhibited
  p70S6K. Beclin1 promoting autophagy process while is inhibited through its bindings
  with Bcl2 or Mcl-1. ATG5–ATG12–ATG16L1 complex and LC3-II engage in the process
  from initiation of phagophore elongation to autophagosome formation. The iASPP depletion
  represses Mcl-1 or promotes ATG5–ATG12–ATG16L1 action. Armus promotes initiation
  of phagophore which could be blocked by Rac1. Rab9 could be assembled to double-membrane
  vesicles independently of ATG5/ATG7 and LC3. FGF7-FGFR2 signal stimulates the processes
  of formation and turnover of autophagosomes. BNIP3 promotes autophagy process but
  without recognized molecular target yet.
