caption: Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) ligation to tumor necrosis factor receptor
  1 (TNFR1) results in receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)
  mediated formation of complex-I, which is mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligases cellular
  inhibitor of apoptosis protein (cIAP1/2) (and/or X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
  protein XIAP) and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), as well as linear ubiquitination
  complex (LUBAC). Complex-I promotes survival and cytokine production via I-kappa-B-kinase
  (IKK)- and transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-mediated nuclear
  factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway activation. Apoptosis, RIPK1-dependent apoptosis
  (RDA) or necroptosis pathways may be activated to promote cell death following deubiquitination
  of RIPK1 by Cyld and/or A20. While canonical complex-IIa does not require RIPK1
  kinase activity, RDA complex-IIa and complex-IIb/necrosome require RIPK1 kinase
  activity (*), which is inhibited by Nec-1s. Caspase8-caspase3 pathway is activated
  downstream of both canonical and RDA complex-IIa to promote apoptotic cell death,
  while Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) phosphorylation and oligomerization
  downstream of complex-IIb/necrosome to promotes necrotic cell death.
