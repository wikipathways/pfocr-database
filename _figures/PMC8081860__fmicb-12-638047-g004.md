caption: LAM-induced regulation of the adaptative immune cells. (A) B cells express
  TLR-2 that recognizes LAM and activates MyD88-dependent pathway. The TLR-2 signaling
  cascade activates the PI3K pathway and the MAP kinase (MAPKs) pathway, the latter
  induces MEK1 and JNK phosphorylation and activation of AP-1. While the PI3K pathway
  activates NF-kB, both pathways lead to IL-10 production. Moreover, TLR-2/LAM complex
  induces polyubiquitylation of IKK-γ (subunit of NF-κB essential modulator) by K63
  activity and, consequently, the Th1 immune response is affected. (B) The LAM insertion
  into lipid rafts in T cells blocks the activation process since phosphorylation
  of lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck), linker for activation of T
  cells (LAT), Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70), CD3-epsilon, and CD3-delta
  chains is inhibited. LAM also induces low expression of Akt and mTOR, whereas the
  levels of genes related to anergy in lymphocytes (GRAIL) increases, together limiting
  the T cell activation. Finally, there are also reports suggesting that LAM induces
  the limited phosphorylation of zeta chains that sequester endosomal vesicles and
  favor low expression of Usp9x and Otub1 enzymes, consequently limiting the differentiation
  to inflammatory phenotypes. The figure was created in BioRender.
