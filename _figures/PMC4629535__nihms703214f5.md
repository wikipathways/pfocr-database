caption: Canonical pathway and gene network analysis of the 18 identifiers that were
  expressed in the lungs of PQ-free rats. The 18 identifiers were analyzed using IPA
  and the identifiers were grouped to 11 canonical biological process pathways. The
  EGF signaling, PDGF signaling, NF-kB activation by viruses, ceramide signaling,
  regulation of IL-2 expression in activated and anergic T lymphocytes, and PTEN signaling
  were found to be the dominant canonical pathways represented by the identifiers.
  p-Value <0.05 indicated that a maximum False Discovery Rate of 5% was accepted in
  the functional analysis of IPA. A representative protein network of the dominant
  canonical pathways was then generated. The networks was obtained by merging the
  2 highest scored networks into one overall network; cell signaling, cardiovascular
  system development (score 19), cell death (score 13). CSRNP3 and KCNH8 were not
  eligible to mapping. POU3F3 and EMCN were not involved in the highest scored networks.
  Solid grey lines and dotted grey lines indicated direct and indirect interactions,
  respectively. Arrow-headed lines and simple lines without arrows indicated ‘acts
  on’ and ‘binding only’, respectively. Solid orange lines and dotted orange lines
  indicated highlighted direct and indirect interactions, respectively.
