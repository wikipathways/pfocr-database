caption: IL-10 signal transduction and hypothesized treatment by dual gene therapy.
  (a) shows multiple possible IL-10 signal transduction pathways. The STAT3 pathway
  results in an anti-inflammatory response. (b) shows our attempt to enhance IL-10
  signaling at two points with the hypothesis that enhanced gene expression of the
  anti-inflammatory gene set would occur. The gene delivery is indicated by larger
  font and bolded IL-10 and STAT3. More powerful signal transduction is represented
  by larger arrows and larger font.
