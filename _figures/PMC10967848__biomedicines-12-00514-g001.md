caption: 'Representation of metabolic pathways of lipoprotein. Chylomicrons are synthesized
  from the intestine and are elaborated by the members of the low-density lipoprotein
  (LDL) receptors. Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)/intermediate density lipoprotein
  (IDL)/LDL particles are produced by the liver and the LDL clearance is due to the
  LDH receptors. The high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolic pathway involves the
  synthesis of discoidal HDLs and the formation of mature spherical HDLs. Their clearance
  is due to the action of the SR-BI receptor. The exchange of lipids between HDLs,
  chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, and VLDLs is also represented. LPLs are essential
  for the conversion from chylomicron (CM) to CM remnants in the exogenous pathway
  and from VLDLs to LDLs in the endogenous pathway. Apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2) is
  a critical factor for LPL activity. Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) competes with LPL
  for binding to lipid emulsion particles. MTTP: microsomal triglyceride transfer
  protein; CEPT: cholesteryl ester transfer protein; LPL: lipoprotein lipase; PLTP:
  phospholipid transfer protein; ABCA1: ATP-binding cassette transporter; ApoB100:
  apolipoprotein B; ApoB48: apolipoprotein B48; LCAT: lecithin–cholesterol acyltransferase'
