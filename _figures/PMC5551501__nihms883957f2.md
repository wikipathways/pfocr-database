caption: 'Elimination of amino-acids.The carbon skeletons of amino acids are broken
  down into metabolites that can either be oxidized into CO2 and H2O to generate ATP,
  or can be used for gluconeogenesis. The catabolism of amino acidsaccounts for 10
  to 15% of the human body’s energy production. Each of the 20 amino acids has aseparate
  catabolic pathway, yet all 20 pathways converge into 5 intermediates, all of which
  can enter thecitric acid cycle. From the citric acid cycle the carbon skeletons
  can be completely oxidized into CO2 or diverted into gluconeogensis or ketogenesis.
  Glucogenic amino acids are broken down into one of the following metabolites: pyruvate,
  α-ketoglutarate, succinyl CoA, fumarate or oxaloacetate. Ketogenic amino acids are
  broken down intoacetoacetate or acetyl-CoA. Larger amino acids, tryptophan, phenylalanine,
  tyrosine, isoleucine andthreonine are both glucogenic and ketogenic. Only two amino
  acids are purely ketogenic they are lysine and leucine. If two of the amino acids
  are purely ketogenic and five amino acids are both ketogenic and glucogenic, than
  that leaves 13 amino acids that are purely glucogenic: Arginine, Glutamate, Glutamine,
  Histidine, Proline, Valine, Methionine, Aspartate, Asparagninen, Alaanine, Serine,
  Cysteine, and Glycine [].'
