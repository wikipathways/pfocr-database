caption: Putative model of Cmhyd1 regulating hypha growth, pigmentation, conidiation,
  hydrophobicity and infection as well as primordium differentiation in Cordyceps
  militaris. CmAreA directly activated the transcription of Cmhyd1, cooperating with
  CmOTam. Cmhyd1 was expressed and CmHYD1 was secreted. CmHYD1 formed a hydrophobic
  coating for hyphae and conidia to ensure their hydrophobicity. CmHYD1 was involved
  in conidiation and infection as well as primordium differentiation by regulating
  the transcription of Cmfrq, Cmvosa and genes of the MAPK signaling pathway. CmHYD1
  also regulated the transcript level of Cmarea via a positive feedback mechanism.
  Dotted arrows indicate the relationship was only confirmed at transcript levels.
  The “?” indicates unknown protein.
