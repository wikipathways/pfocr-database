caption: A working model for losartan and transient receptor potential cation channel
  6 (TRPC6) antagonist SAR mitigating the NS-elicited podocyte injury via targeting
  the AngⅡ-controlled TRPC6 cellular calcium influx defense pathway. The TRPC6-dictated
  regulation of Ca2+ plays a key role in governing the injury response at a delayed/late
  phase. AngⅡ can catalyze TRPC6 activation. NS insults are capable of eliciting AngⅡ
  hyperactivity. This enhances AngⅡ-mediated TRPC6 activation, leading to CaN and
  apoptosis signal expression and actin cytoskeleton molecular degradation that results
  in podocyte injury, aggravating proteinuria. Losartan can directly inhibit AngⅡ
  activity, as well as SAR, inhibit TRPC6 activity, and thereby suppress TRPC6-mediated
  calcium influx at the same effect, mitigate the expression export of CaN and apoptosis
  signal, increase actin cytoskeleton molecular accumulation, and ultimately attenuate
  podocyte injury and proteinuria. CaN, calcineurin.
