caption: Bet v 1a mostly escapes the antigen presentation pathway, because its cleavage
  sites are cryptic at pH ≥ 5.5; therefore the majority of Bet v 1a ends up in the
  degradation pathway. By contrast, Bet v 1d is readily processed in the antigen presentation
  pathway with pH ≥ 5.5. Consequently, large amounts of Bet v 1d-derived peptides
  will be loaded and presented on class II MHC, explaining the protective TH1 response.
  The large amounts of endocytosed Bet v 1a allergen together with its low proteolytic
  processing at pH ≥ 5.5 warrant a continuous supply of Bet v 1a peptides for presentation
  albeit at low concentration, thus explaining its allergic TH2 response. pH values
  for the early endosome (EE, pH 6.8-5.5), the late endosome (LE, pH 5.5-5) and the
  lysosome (pH 5-4) are approximate values as reported in the literature.
