caption: Simplified illustration of the physiological pathways used for H2 production
  in Chlamydomonas (Adapted from The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook []). The two photoproduction
  pathways involving PSII and PSI under the light period are showed in black. Electrons
  excited to higher energy (low potential) by PSI are able to reduce ferredoxin (FDX),
  the physiological electron donor to hydrogenase. Both the PSII-dependent and NPQR-dependent
  (red) pathways require reduction of the PQ pool and PSI activity. In the case of
  the PSII-independent pathway (reactions in red), reducing power formed by the catabolism
  of organic substrates is used for reduction of the PQ pool. During dark fermentation
  the oxidation of pyruvate catalysed by PFR (green reactions) is used to reduce ferredoxin
  and putatively mediates the observed production of H2 in the dark. White reactions
  show the parallel main fermentative products from pyruvate, competing with H2. Dashed
  arrows show linear and cyclic electron flow.
