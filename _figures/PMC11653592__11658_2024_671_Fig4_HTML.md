caption: The role of 4-OHE in pulmonary hypertension; 4-OHEs competitively decrease
  the activity of 2-OHE2, inhibiting the formation of 2-ME2. They activate ERs, leading
  to the production of free radicals and generation of ortho-quinones, resulting in
  ROS production and DNA damage, which can cause dysfunction of PAECs and promote
  the proliferation and migration of PASMCs. By binding to ARs, 4-OHEs increase VEGF
  expression and activate ERK1/2, JNK, and p38MAPK pathways and promote the proliferation
  of AECs; 4-OHEs induce DDR and upregulate the levels of proinflammatory cytokines
  IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF, potentially aggravating the deterioration of PH. However,
  4-OHEs also increase HO-1 levels through the Nrf2–Keap1–ARE pathway, inhibiting
  oxidative stress and PASMCs proliferation and promoting apoptosis. In lung tissue,
  they enhance Nrf2 expression, reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-8
  and TNF. In LPS-stimulated macrophages, 4-OHEs upregulate GSTP1, decreasing the
  levels proinflammatory cytokines TNF, NO, iNOS, and COX-2, mitigating inflammation,
  and potentially ameliorating PH deterioration. Furthermore, they inhibit the PI3K–Akt–mTOR
  pathway and LC3-II levels, decrease p62 levels, and enhance autophagy stability.
