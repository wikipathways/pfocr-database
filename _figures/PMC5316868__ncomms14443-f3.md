caption: '(a) Multiple core components of Shh, Wnt and Hippo pathways that are under
  significant translational regulation are shown in blue. Pointed and blunt arrows
  indicate stimulation or inhibition. (b) Firefly luciferase (Fluc) reporter activity
  downstream of 5′-UTRs of Hippo or Shh pathway genes. Values are shown relative to
  HBB 5′-UTR construct indicated by the dashed line. Full-length wildtype 5′-UTRs
  contain multiple uAUGs (red arrows) and non-canonical initiation sites within a
  strong Kozak context (blue arrows). Black bars indicate activity of wildtype 5′-UTR,
  grey bars indicate activity of mutated 5′-UTRs in which point mutations were generated
  in all uAUGs (red triangles) and non-canonical initiation sites (blue triangles).
  (c–f) Values are shown relative to wildtype 5′-UTR constructs: uORFs initiating
  at uAUG (red arrows); uORFs initiating from non-canonical start sites (blue arrows);
  point mutations in uAUGs (red triangle); point mutations in non-canonical start
  sites (blue triangles). (c) Fluc activity downstream of wildtype and mutant Gli1
  5′-UTR (d) or Ptch1 5′-UTR. (e) uORF overlapping with main ORF (oORF) is indicated
  by yellow arrows. Point mutation in the 4th uAUG reveals that it is not important
  for translational repression of Ptch1 5′-UTR. (f) uORFs that are in frame with main
  ORF are indicated by blue arrows; oORF (yellow arrows). A green triangle indicates
  the location of a point mutation (tg‘T''GA to tg‘A''GA). This point mutation disrupts
  the upstream stop codon for the 3rd and 5th uAUGs changing the two corresponding
  uORFs to oORFs and producing a new stop codon following the 4th uAUG changing its
  corresponding sequence from an oORF to an uORF. The insertion of 1 nt (‘Stop+1 frameshift'')
  just before the CDS shifts the 3rd and 5th uAUGs in frame with the main ORF. The
  insertion of 2 nt (‘Stop+2 frameshift'') just before the CDS shifts these uAUGs
  back out of frame. For data in panels (b–f) assays were performed in NIH3T3 cells.
  Fluc reporter activity was normalized to Fluc mRNA and transfection efficiency using
  co-transfected Renilla luciferase (Rluc) normalized to Rluc mRNA. Error bars represent
  s.d. AU, arbitrary unit; **P<0.01; *P<0.05; NS, not significant (t-test, n≥4).'
