caption: 'ApoE, secreted by astrocytes, assembles cholesterol and other lipids into
  lipoprotein particles. The ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily A member 1
  (ABCA1) at the plasma membrane transports and loads lipids to apoE. Liver X receptors
  (LXRs) increase the expression of both ABCA1 and apoE. ApoE/lipoprotein particles
  may undergo modifications such as recruiting oligodendrocyte-specific lipids and
  additional apoE molecules prior to binding to neuronal apoE receptors LRP1/LDLR
  or being transported to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cholesterol and other lipids
  transported to neurons play important roles in synaptic formation and repair (see
  main text for details). The inset shows the main components of apoE/lipoprotein
  particles: cholesterol, cholesterol esters and phospholipids.'
