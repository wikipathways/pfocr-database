caption: Trypsinogen activation and cell death in pancreatic acinar cells. Intracellular
  trypsinogen activation is an early event at the onset of acute experimental pancreatitis.
  Supramaximal secretagogue-receptor stimulation or activation of bile salt receptors
  leads to an un-physiological peak-plateau calcium signal. This results in disrupted
  exocytosis of zymogen granules, secretory blockage, zymogen retention and formation
  of endocytic vacuoles, which contain trypsin and trypsinogen, taken up from the
  extracellular space. Those vacuoles co-localize and fuse with lysosomes containing
  cathepsin B, which in turn transforms trypsinogen into active trypsin. Due to increasing
  instability endocytic vacuoles often rupture, releasing trypsin and cathepsin B
  into the cytosol. Active trypsin is thought to induce mainly apoptosis, a silent
  form of cell death, which suppresses inflammation. In contrast, if the pathological
  calcium release cannot be contained, rapid energy depletion occurs and cells undergo
  necrosis during which the plasma membrane becomes leaky and cellular components
  e.g. DNA or mitochondria reach the extracellular space. Those will be recognized
  by leukocytes, which will be activated via the inflammasome signaling pathway. IL1β-
  and TNFα-release as well as pyroptosis occur. If TNFα reaches the basolateral membrane
  of previously unaffected or slightly damaged acinar cells it can induce another
  form of programmed cell death, called necroptosis.
