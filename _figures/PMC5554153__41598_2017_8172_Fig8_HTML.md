caption: 'Proposed inputs from three distinct photoreceptor classes to DACs under
  different lighting conditions. The dorsal retinal network is illustrated on the
  left side; the ventral retinal network is depicted on the right side. R: rod; M:
  M-cone; BC: bipolar cell; AII: AII amacrine cell; DAC: dopaminergic amacrine cell;
  ipRGC: intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell. Under dim lighting conditions,
  DACs in the ventral and dorsal retina receive equal input from rods through the
  primary (rod ─ > rod BC ─ > AII amacrine ─ > cone BC) and secondary (rod ─ > cone)
  rod pathways (blue arrows) and possibly from the tertiary rod pathway (rod ─ > cone
  BC) (dashed blue line/arrow). Under intermediate lighting conditions, DACs in both
  the ventral and dorsal retina receive input from rods (green arrows). DACs in the
  dorsal retina also receive input from cones and melanopsin (green arrows). Under
  bright lighting conditions, DACs in the dorsal and ventral retina receive cone input
  (orange arrows). Additionally, DACs in the dorsal retina receive melanopsin input
  (orange arrow); melanopsin may contribute to DAC signalling in the ventral retina
  as well (dashed orange line/arrow). Under bright lighting conditions, rods may also
  excite DACs through the secondary and tertiary rod pathways (dashed orange line/arrow).'
