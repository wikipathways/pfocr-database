caption: Synthesis, metabolic pathways and function of acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is predominantly
  generated in the mitochondrial matrix through glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation and
  catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), such as valine, leucine and isoleucine.
  Acetyl-CoA can then be transported from the mitochondria using the “citrate-malate-pyruvate
  shuttle” to create oxaloacetate and cytoplasm acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA can be generated
  from the reductive carboxylation of glutamine. In addition, acetate can be used
  to produce cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA catalysed by acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family
  member 2 (ACSS2) in an ATP-dependent manner. Synthesized acetyl-CoA is widely used
  as a precursor for the biosynthesis of numerous metabolites, such as fatty acids,
  steroids and some specific amino acids, which include glutamate, proline, and arginine.
  Reducing the conversion of mitochondrial-derived citrate to acetyl-CoA downregulates
  lipogenesis. This process also decreases cell proliferation, which is stimulated
  by cytokines and regulated by the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. Citrate-derived acetyl-CoA
  functions as an acetyl donor for protein acetylation. In the cytoplasm, acetylation
  can activate the function of proteins, resulting in a series of biological activities.
  In the nucleus, the acetylation of the histone tail neutralizes the charge of the
  histone, weakens the interaction between histones and DNA, and relaxes the chromatin
  structure, thus facilitating transcription.
