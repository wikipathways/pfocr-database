caption: Genetic lesions in PBL. The graph summarizes main genetic lesions and other
  factors in the pathogenesis of PBL reported by Liu and colleagues (), and also findings
  from earlier work (EBV infection, MYC translocations). Mutations in STAT3, JAK1/2,
  NOTCH1, and RAS stand exemplarily for mutations in various members of each of these
  pathways or gene families. NOTCH-IC is the intracellular part of NOTCH that is cleaved
  upon receptor activation and then functions as a transcription factor. The RAS–MAPK
  pathway is normally activated through binding of ligands to receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTK). Black arrows denote signaling steps; blue arrows denote the link between
  genetic lesions and the corresponding gene products.
