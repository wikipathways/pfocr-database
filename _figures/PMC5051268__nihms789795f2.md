caption: A) Bone-Kidney Endocrine Axis. FGF-23 produced in bone regulates FGFR/α-Klotho
  complexes in the kidney to inhibit phosphate reabsorption and lower circulating
  1,25(OH)2D through suppression of Cyp27b1 synthetic and activation of Cyp24a1 degradative
  pathways. FGF-23 also suppresses ACE2 and increases distal tubule sodium reabsorption,
  leading to increased blood pressure. FGF-23 also regulates the expression of α-Klotho,
  which is released into the circulation by ectodomain shedding and acts as a hormone
  with FGF-23 independent effects. 1,25(OH)2D stimulates systemic release of FGF-23
  from bone that in turn suppresses 1,25(OH)2D release from the kidney to create a
  negative feedback loop. A positive feedback cardiovascular loop is theoretically
  created by Ang II and SNS stimulation of FGF-23 expression by bone and effects of
  circulating FGF-23 to decrease ACE2 and increase renal sodium reabsorption. B) FGF-23
  and α-Klotho are also expressed in activated macrophages, which creates a pro-inflammatory
  paracrine FGF-23 signaling pathway. FGF-23 expression in macrophages and stimulation
  of TNF-α may offset the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D on the innate immune
  response. In macrophages, 1,25(OH)2D may suppress FGF-23 expression. C) A model
  of FGF-23 cardiotoxicity derived from FGF-23 effects on the kidney and/or the ectopic
  expression of FGF-23/α-Klotho in infiltrating macrophages. Stimulation of FGF-23
  release into the circulation by RAS, SNS, or oxidative stress or local production
  of FGF-23 in macrophages could attenuate the beneficial effects of Vitamin D on
  the cardiovascular and innate immune responses.
