caption: Overview of several disease pathways involved in AD pathogenesis. Causal
  AD genes and AD risk factors are marked in blue. APP is synthesized by the endoplasmatic
  reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus (1). Following the amyloidogenic pathway
  in neurons, APP is cleaved by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase (PSEN) to generate
  Aβ peptides and the amyloid intracellular domain [AICD] (2), which influences the
  transcription of several genes (3). In the APP retromer recycling pathway (1), APP
  is redirected to endosomes by SORL1. PICALM has a presumed role in APP endocytotic
  recycling (1). Aβ monomers aggregate into Aβ fibrils, causing amyloid plaques in
  brain parenchyma and vasculature (4). Aβ activates microglia and astrocytes, inducing
  the complement system, local inflammatory responses and oxidative stress (5). CR1
  is the receptor of the complement C3b protein and participates in the clearance
  of Aβ from circulation (6). Besides causing increased Aβ endocytosis into glial
  cells, CLU is involved in Aβ clearance at the blood–brain barrier (7). APOE enhances
  amyloid plaque formation by conformational changes of Aβ. Clusterin (APOJ) and APOE
  are the main escorting proteins of Aβ in brain (7). Both are also important in cholesterol
  metabolism at the neuronal membrane (8) and high intracellular cholesterol may enhance
  APP amyloidogenic processing (2), which in turn can lead to membrane damage (9).
  Moreover, impaired cholesterol metabolism may influence synaptic dysfunction (10).
  Both PICALM and DNMBP are related at the synapse (10). Interaction of Aβ oligomers
  at the membrane is further connected to the calcium hypothesis in AD (11). Polymorphisms
  in the Ca2+ channel CALHM1 impair Ca2+ permeability at the plasma membrane (11).
  In addition, PSENs function as ER Ca2+-leak channels and several early-onset mutations
  impair Ca2+-leak-channel function, resulting in an excessive Ca2+ accumulation in
  the cytosol. An excessive Ca2+ is taken up by mitochondria, further leading to oxidative
  stress and apoptosis (12).
