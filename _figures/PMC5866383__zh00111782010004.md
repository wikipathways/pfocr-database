caption: The centrally controlled, parallel sympathetic nerve and slow neurohumoral
  pathways that regulate both arterial and cardiac function, and participate in the
  pathogenesis of hypertension and heart failure (HF). Angiotensin II (Ang II) and
  high dietary salt (↑[Na+]) are convergent signals that act via hypothalamic Ang-type
  1 receptors (AT1R) to activate central nervous system (CNS) sympathetic pathways;
  the role of the kidneys in the retention of salt has been omitted for the sake of
  simplicity. The increased sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) promotes vasoconstriction
  and increases cardiac rate and contractile force. Prolonged stimulation of hypothalamic
  AT1R also activates a novel neurohumoral pathway (box at top right) that includes
  aldosterone (Aldo), mineralocorticoid receptors (MR), epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC),
  endogenous ouabain (EO), and α2 Na+ pumps. This hypothalamic pathway feeds back
  (green line, “+”) to modulate Ang II-activated SNA and also promotes adrenal secretion
  of EO, triggered by, e.g., ACTH, adrenal SNA, and/or Ang II. The elevated plasma
  EO acutely inhibits α2 Na+ pumps in both the heart and arteries, and the rise in
  intracellular Na+ rapidly induces Na/Ca exchanger (NCX)-mediated Ca2+ gain, and
  cardiotonic and vasotonic effects. Prolonged plasma EO elevation also activates
  an α2 Na+ pump-associated protein kinase cascade (e.g., EGFR/Src/MEK/ERK-mediated)
  that increases cardiac and arterial NCX expression, and arterial sarcoplasmic reticulum
  (SR) Ca2+ pump (SERCA2) expression. In arteries with tone, NCX normally favors Ca2+
  entry and helps to sustain cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]CYT) above contraction threshold.
  The EO-induced NCX and SERCA2 upregulation enhances Ca2+signaling and helps the
  very modestly increased SNA to increase vascular tone and resistance and elevate
  blood pressure. In the heart, NCX promotes Ca2+ extrusion during diastole, but prolonged
  α2 pump inhibition by EO reduces the Na+ gradient driving force so that [Na+]CYT
  and diastolic [Ca2+]CYT are both elevated; consequently, cardiac relaxation is slow
  and/or incomplete. Also, cardiac SERCA2 expression is usually reduced in HF (perhaps
  due to the high EO), as are SR Ca2+ stores and [Ca2+]CYT transients, and systolic
  function is impaired. The diastolic dysfunction and attenuated cardiac contraction
  and stroke volume contribute to HF. These cellular mechanisms are discussed further
  in a recent review (). [Modified from Blaustein et al. () with permission.]
