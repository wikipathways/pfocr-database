caption: The inflammatory signaling pathway in macrophages. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)
  stimulates TLR4 (Toll‐like receptor 4), which leads to a cascade of signaling events,
  resulting in the transcription and release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF.
  The squared box contains both hypotheses for the effect of the anti‐inflammatory
  drug dexamethasone (Dexa). In hypothesis A, the protein inhibitor of B (IB is synthesized
  in response to dexa bound to glucocorticoid receptors (GR). IB in turn binds to
  nuclear factor ‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cells (NF‐B) proteins (RelA
  and NF‐B1) to inhibit their transcriptional activity. In hypothesis B, there is
  a direct physical association between activated GR and the NF‐B subunit RelA that
  reduces the transcriptional activity. p, phosphorylation.
