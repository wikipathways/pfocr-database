caption: Expression of ethylene signaling genes in wild-type (WT) and CKX-4 tubers
  after GA3-induced tuber sprouting. Expression data of differentially expressed ESTs
  representing genes of the ethylene signaling pathway are shown in the left-hand
  panel and a schematic overview of this pathway, as assumed from knowledge in Arabidopsis
  (; ), is shown on the right. Color bars as displayed by the MapMan tool were copied
  to and aligned in Microsoft PowerPoint. The color scale next to the panel indicates
  transcript levels, with red representing an increase and blue representing a decrease
  in transcript levels. The colors saturate at 4-fold change. Details on the assignment
  of individual POCI identifiers to genes shown are listed in Supplemental Table S3.
  Without ethylene binding, the ethylene receptor complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum
  membrane activate CTR1. RTE1 acts as a negative regulator of ethylene response by
  regulating the ethylene receptor ETR1. CTR1 is proposed to be a MKKK that activates
  a cytosolic kinase signaling cascade, leading to phosphorylation of residues Thr-592
  and Thr-546 of the transcription factors EIN3 and EIL1 in the nucleus as well as
  the inhibition of membrane-bound protein EIN2. Phosphorylated EIN3 and EIL1 interact
  with F-box proteins EBF1 and EBF2, resulting in constant degradation of the transcription
  factors and thus suppression of ethylene signaling. EIN5/XRN4 indirectly influences
  transcript levels of EBF1 and EBF2. Upon binding of ethylene, CTR1 is inactivated,
  which leads to inactivation of the CTR1-MAPK signaling and activation of another
  kinase signaling cascade involving MKK9, MPK3, and MPK6 and probably an as yet unknown
  MKKK. This cascade leads to the phosphorylation of residues Thr-176 and Thr-176
  of EIN3 and EIL1, presumably resulting in increased stability because of a reduced
  interaction with EBF1 and EBF2. Membrane-bound protein EIN2 also positively influences
  EIN3 accumulation through a mechanism that has not been elucidated yet. EIN3/EIL1
  activates ethylene responses both directly and indirectly through expression of
  the transcriptional activator ERF1. CTR1, Constitutive triple response 1; ERS, ethylene
