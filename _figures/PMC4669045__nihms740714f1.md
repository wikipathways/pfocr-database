caption: Brown shows the general pathway of differentiation of neutrophils and mononuclear
  cells in healthy individuals. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) differentiate into
  common myeloid progenitors (CMP), then into granulocytes macrophage progenitors
  (GMP), which give rise to mature neutrophils via sequential steps of differentiation
  involving myeloblasts (MB), promyelocytes (PM), myelocytes (MC), metamyelocytes
  (MM), and band forms (BF). Differentiation of macrophages (MΦ) and DCs involve macrophage/dendritic
  cell progenitors (MDP), DC progenitors (CDP), pre-cDCs, as well as several types
  of monocytes. In cancer (blue), tumor-derived factors regulate various molecular
  pathways, including upregulation of RORC1, which affect all steps of granulocytic
  and monocytic cell differentiation. RORC1 promotes the accumulation of immature
  pathologically activated PMN-MDSC neutrophils for the expense of mature PMN. M-MDSCs
  differentiate to TAM in the tumor site. RORC1 promotes polarization toward the M2
  phenotype of TAM.
