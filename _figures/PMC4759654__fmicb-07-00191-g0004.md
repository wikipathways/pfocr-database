caption: Predicted pathway of sulfate reduction in D. reducens based on proteomic
  findings. The core sulfate reduction machinery (Sat, APS reductase, sulfite reductase)
  does not display significant differential abundance. Instead, certain clusters of
  proteins encoded within hdr-containing loci are increased in abundance during sulfate
  reduction and are predicted to be involved in the process. Abundance comparisons
  are shown for sulfate and Fe(III)-citrate reduction conditions. All protein abundance
  comparisons are displayed in Tables , .
