caption: Visual diagram of the mitochondrial dysfunction canonical pathway identified
  by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) as being associated with both the sham-irradiated
  group and the 1H-irradiated group. The diagram provides an image of how the pathway
  is structured, where the molecules from the dataset are located, and a prediction
  of molecule activity. The nodes outlined in magenta are the molecules found in the
  dataset. The node color indicates expression value, and color intensity indicates
  degree of upregulation (red) or downregulation (green). Gray nodes are dataset molecules
  that were not significantly expressed and therefore did not pass the IPA analysis
  cutoff. Uncolored nodes were not part of our dataset but were incorporated into
  the pathway based on evidence stored in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Blue indicates
  a prediction of inhibited activity. Solid lines indicate a direct interaction between
  molecules and the predicted relationship between the molecules. Grey arrows indicate
  the effect is not predicted. The direction of the interaction is represented by
  arrows. For signaling pathways, an arrow pointing from one molecule to another indicates
  the cause of activation.
