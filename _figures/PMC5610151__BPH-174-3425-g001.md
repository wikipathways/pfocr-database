caption: 'PVAT‐derived vasoactive molecules. Methyl palmitate produced by PVAT adipocytes
  (AC) causes vasodilatation by opening the Kv channels on VSMC. H2S is synthesized
  in PVAT by CSE and induces VSMC hyperpolarization by stimulating KCNQ‐type Kv or
  KATP channels. Leptin induces endothelium‐dependent vasodilatation by stimulating
  leptin receptor (LepR), which leads to activation of eNOS via a pathway involving
  AMPK and Akt and to H2S production. This H2S functions as an EDHF and activates
  endothelial small (SKCa) and intermediate (IKCa) conductance calcium‐dependent K+
  channels via autocrine mechanisms. The resulting hyperpolarization of endothelial
  cells can be transmitted to VSMC by electrical coupling through myoendothelial gap
  junction (MEGJ). Leptin also causes endothelium‐independent vasodilatation by inducing
  VSMC hyperpolarization through unknown mechanisms. NO and H2O2 released from PVAT
  can elicit vasodilatation by activating sGC leading to the synthesis of cGMP. Adiponectin
  released from PVAT AC can be enhanced by stimulation of β3 adrenoceptors (β3) and
  by the NO‐cGMP‐PKG pathway. Adiponectin exerts multiple vascular effects: it stimulates
  NO production from PVAT and from endothelial cells and induces VSMC hyperpolarization
  by activating TRPM4 channels followed by opening BKCa; Ang 1–7 produced by PVAT
  acts on endothelial Ang 1–7 receptor (Mas; MAS1 receptor) thereby stimulating endothelial
  NO production. Besides stimulating sGC activity, NO from PVAT and endothelial cells
  can also induce/potentiate VSMC hyperpolarization through KCa or BKCa. Partly adopted
  from (Beltowski, ; Weston et al., ; Withers et al., ).'
