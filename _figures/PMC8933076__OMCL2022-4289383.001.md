caption: 'Bile acid synthesis and metabolism. BAs are synthesized in the perivenous
  hepatocytes through a series of enzymatic reactions. There are the classical and
  alternative pathways for bile acid synthesis: The “classic pathway” is formed by
  a series of catalytic reactions via CYP7A1, HSD3B7, CYP8B1, and CYP27A1. Two hydrophobic
  primary bile acids, CA and CDCA, were synthesized. CYP7A1 located in the endoplasmic
  reticulum of liver cells is the main rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. The alternative
  pathway occurs in a variety of tissues and macrophages, which is initiated by CYP27A1
  in mitochondria and CYP7B1 in the endoplasmic reticulum to synthesis CDCA. In the
  rodent liver, primary bile acids α- and β-MCA are generated by 7β-hydroxylation
  from CDCA and UDCA via CYP2C70. Primary BAs are then combined with glycine or taurine
  to form conjugated BAs. The conjugated BAs were transported from liver cells to
  the gallbladder by BESP and MRP2. After eating, the gallbladder contracts and secretes
  BAs into the intestine. Primary BAs are metabolized by intestinal bacteria to produce
  secondary BAs, mainly including DCA, LCA, and HDCA.'
