caption: 'Distinct developmental subnetworks regulate cardiac progenitor cell division
  and specification. (A) Schematic of Jumu, CHES-1-like and Myb regulation of cardiac
  progenitor cell divisions by Polo kinase. The forkhead TFs Jumu and CHES-1-like
  regulate Polo kinase activity to mediate three distinct classes of cardiac progenitor
  cell divisions: asymmetric cell divisions, symmetric cell divisions, and an earlier
  round of cell division that determines the number of Svp progenitors (). Mutations
  in Myb result in defects in only the latter two categories of cell divisions, which
  also exhibit synergistic genetic interactions among Myb, jumu, CHES-1-like and polo.
  As Myb transcriptionally regulates polo (), Myb and the forkhead TFs act in concert
  to control Polo activity and thus govern both the symmetric and earlier class of
  cell divisions. (B) Schematic of the involvement of the Notch signaling pathway
  in the lineage decision between PCs and CCs for PC enhancers like that of Him. Modes
  of regulation activating and repressing target genes are shown as green and red
  arrows, respectively. In CCs, the enhancers of PC genes are repressed by the Su(H)-co-repressor
  complex. The Delta ligand expressed by CCs activates Notch receptor in neighboring
  PCs, with the resulting cleaved Nicd fragment associating with Su(H) and displacing
  the co-repressor. The consequent elimination of repressor complex binding in PCs
  is sufficient to initiate transcription due to the presence of other local TF activators,
  and is enhanced further by the Nicd-Su(H) complex.'
