caption: A schematic of proposed mechanisms for the antidepressant-like effects of
  neuritin acting via LGI1. Chronic stress reduces neuritin expression and HDAC5 phosphorylation.
  Normally MEF2 associates with HDAC5 and blocks its nuclear export, which results
  in repression of MEF2 transcriptional activity. Neuritin stimulates phosphorylation
  of IR and IRS-1, leading to PKD activation. HDAC5 is phosphorylated in a PKD-dependent
  pathway, which is followed by nuclear export of p-HDAC5. This leads to reduced binding
  of HDAC5 to the Lgi1 promoter, thereby derepressing LGI1 expression. LGI1 increases
  neurite outgrowth and may restore other neuronal signaling. As a result, the depressive
  behaviors induced by chronic stress are rescued.
