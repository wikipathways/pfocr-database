caption: Potential signaling pathways involved in anthracycline-induced cardiomyocyte
  injury. Anthracycline-induced cell death is balanced by intracellular survival signaling
  which is linked to neuregulin/ErbB2 and Akt activation. The suggested principal
  mechanism of anthracycline damage is via generation of reactive oxygen species ROS
  by iron-anthracycline complexes, leading to lipid peroxidation and membrane damage.
  Oxidative stress (ROS, nitric oxide NO, and peroxynitrite ONOO–) causes activation
  of kinase pathways (mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK, stress-activated protein
  kinase SAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinases JNK) modulating response to anthracyclines
  and linking to apoptotic pathway. In mitochondria, ROS and calcium overload lead
  to the release of cytochrome c (cyt c) from mitochondria into cytoplasm, via mitochondrial
  permeability transition pore opening (mPTP), which results in membrane potential
  dissipation (delta psi m), activation of caspases and apoptosis. Other putative
  mechanisms include damage to nuclear DNA, disruption of sarcomeric protein, suppression
  of transcription factors (GATA-4, p300, p53) that regulate cell survival and sarcomeric
  protein synthesis, and disturbance of energy metabolism.
