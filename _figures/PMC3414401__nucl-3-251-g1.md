caption: Figure 1. Pfa4 in the anchoring of telomeres and the dynamics of heterochromatin
  in budding yeast. (A) A simplified view of pathways that anchor telomeres at the
  nuclear periphery. A single chromosome is shown for simplicity, and the dynamics
  of heterochromatin proteins (Sir proteins) between telomeric and internal (e.g.,
  HM) heterochromatic loci are depicted. Additional details, including cell cycle
  specificity of the relevant pathways (depicted by dotted lines) are comprehensively
  discussed in reference . At the ends of chromosomes, Ku interacts with telomerase
  that in turn associates with the integral membrane protein Mps3 (Mps3-Ku via telomerase).
  The heterochromatin protein Sir4 is involved in two additional anchoring mechanisms
  via interactions with Mps3 and a membrane associated protein named Esc1 (Mps3-Sir4
  and Esc1-Sir4).- Ku interacts with Sir4 and it also participates in another anchoring
  pathway involving as yet unidentified factors at the INM (Ku-other). Sir4-based
  anchoring pathways are also used at an internal heterochromatic loci such as HMR
  but are not shown. Based on our study, we propose that palmitoylated Rif1 binds
  to telomeric-bound Rap1 proteins and thereby contributes to telomeric anchoring,
  presumably because the palmitoyl group is imbedded in the INM. Rif1 also attenuates
  the recruitment of Sir proteins by DNA-bound Rap1. Pfa4, the palmitoyltransferase
  required to modify Rif1, is an integral membrane protein shown in the ER. (B) Nuclear
  consequences of loss of Pfa4 are depicted. Rif1 is no longer anchored in the membrane,
  allowing it to dissociate from telomeric clusters and redistribute into the nucleoplasm.
  Rif1 is now able to sample other sites in the genome with the consequence of influencing
  silencing or other functions at other loci. While enrichment of Rif1 at telomere
  clusters is diminished, interactions between Rif1 and Rap1 maintain sufficient levels
  of Rif1 at telomeres to leave telomeric silencing and length regulation relatively
  unaffected. However, the increased dynamics of Rif1 that result from loss of Pfa4
  leads to a perturbation in Sir protein dynamics (bolder arrows) that in turn leads
  to changes in transcriptional silencing and the appearance of unusual Sir3 aggregates
  that are molecularly uncharacterized (not depicted, please see text).
