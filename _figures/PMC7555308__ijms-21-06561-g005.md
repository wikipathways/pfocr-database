caption: 'Model of the effects of IGF1R and TSHR antagonists on GO- immunoglobulin
  (Ig) stimulation of hyaluronan secretion by Graves’ orbital fibroblasts. GO-Igs
  bind directly to and activate TSHR, stimulating two signaling pathways: IGF1R-independent
  (dark gray arrow) and IGF1R-dependent (light gray arrows), leading to secretion
  of hyaluronan. TSHR/IGF1R crosstalk is initiated by binding of GO-Igs to TSHR and
  requires TSHR and IGF1R to be in close proximity within a signalosome. Synergistic
  interactions between TSHR and IGF1R occur rapidly at phosphorylation of ERK, demonstrating
  that crosstalk between TSHR and IGF1R occurs early in the signaling cascade, proximal
  to the receptors []. β-arrestin 1 (βARR) is essential for GO-Ig stimulation of ERK
  phosphorylation, and hyaluronan secretion and proximity ligation assays in GOFs
  demonstrated that β-arrestin 1 physically scaffolds TSHRs and IGF1Rs in a protein
  complex []. These pathways appear not to involve cAMP, which has been considered
  a canonical pathway of TSHR in thyrocytes. However, recent evidence has demonstrated
  β-arrestin-mediated signaling in thyrocytes and osteoblast-like cells also. Some
  inhibitory IGF1R antibodies (IGF1RAb), such as 1H7 and probably teprotumumab, bind
  to IGF1Rs and inhibit activation of IGF1R by activated TSHR via crosstalk. TSHR
  antagonists, including drug-like small molecule inhibitors, anti-TSHR antibodies
  and cyclic peptides via immune hyposensitization inhibit signaling initiated by
  GO-Ig activation of TSHR, and thereby totally abolish both pathways of stimulation
  of hyaluronan secretion. Combination therapy with TSHR and IGF1R antagonists could
  minimize drug side effects and, therefore, may have therapeutic benefits [].'
