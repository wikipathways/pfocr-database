caption: In neurocytes, Metrnl protein promotes neurite outgrowth via the JAK-STAT3
  and MEK-ERK signaling pathways. In adipocytes, overexpression of Metrnl enhances
  lipid metabolism, relieves high-fat diet-induced inflammation, and improves adipose
  remodeling through upregulation of PPARγ, subsequently improving insulin resistance.
  In myocytes, Metrnl protein upregulates PPARδ and promotes the phosphorylation of
  AMPK by increasing intracellular calcium and further promotes the phosphorylation
  of TBC1D1, HDAC5, and p38 MAPK in an AMPK-mediated manner, subsequently promoting
  expression and translocation of GLUT4, improving insulin sensitization and reducing
  inflammation. In naïve/M0-like bone marrow-derived macrophages, Metrnl protein increases
  STAT3 phosphorylation, promotes macrophage differentiation to an anti-inflammatory
  phenotype, and releases insulin-like growth factor 1, subsequently increasing primary
  muscle satellite cell proliferation and skeletal muscle repair.
