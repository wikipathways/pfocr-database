caption: 'Pathway of miRNAs involved in root development of plant. MiR164, miR167,
  miR393, and miR171 targeted transcription factors regulate root development through
  auxin and the GA signaling pathway. MiR156, miR847, and miR169 also participate
  in regulating root development by targeting special transcription factors. Note:
  → represents positive regulation, and ┤ represents negative regulation.'
