caption: NNK can be oxygenated by cytochromes P450 or reduced by several enzymes of
  the AKR and HSD families to form nitrosamine alcohol (NNAL). Reduction represents
  detoxification pathway as NNAL is glucuronydated by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl
  transferases (UDPGT) and is subsequently excreted.
