caption: 'An example of cellular nutrient–gene interaction mechanisms. This diagram
  shows the regulation of gene expression by the available nutrients, nutrient metabolites,
  or nonnutrient compounds within a cell. For example, nutrients, such as Glc, become
  available in the circulatory system through either the digestion of feed ingredients
  or the metabolic degradation of chemical components of tissues (e.g., liver, adipose,
  and muscle). Multiple Glc sensing mechanisms coexist: extraorganismal, extracellular,
  and intracellular (). The extraorganismal Glc is sensed by oral taste receptors.
  With the extracellular mechanism, Glc is sensed by GLUT2 or GLUT4. With the intracellular
  mechanism, Glc is sensed by GCK. GCK further phosphorylates Glc to produce Glc-6-phosphate
  (Glc-6-P), which acts as a signaling molecule (metabolic messenger) to activate
  the downstream molecules and regulate the expression of genes (e.g., insulin, glycogen
  synthase, and glycogen phosphorylase) related to Glc metabolism (, ). Pathway [A]
  shows the role of Glc in insulin gene expression. Although multiple factors are
  involved in transcription of the insulin gene, Pdx-1 is a crucial one in pancreatic
  β-cells (). Glc is transported to pancreatic β-cells by GLUT2 and initiates the
  signaling to induce Pdx-1 phosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus, where
  it binds to the insulin gene promoter, resulting in increased insulin transcriptional
  activation and increased insulin secretion (, ). Pathways [B] and [C] show the roles
  of Glc and insulin in the expression of glycolytic and lipogenic genes in hepatocytes.
  Insulin first binds to insulin binding receptor, initiating the signaling to recruit
  GLUT2 or GLUT4. The active GLUT2 or GLUT4 carry Glc into the cell. An elevated concentration
  of Glc in hepatic and adipose cells can indirectly upregulate the expression of
  genes encoding Glc transporters, glycolytic enzymes (e.g., L-PK), and lipogenic
  enzymes (e.g., FAS, ACC, and SCD1), while repressing the expression of genes related
  to the gluconeogenic pathway, such as PEPCK (). ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FAS,
  fatty acid synthase; GCK, glucokinase; Glc, glucose; GLUT, Glc transporter; L-PK,
  L-type pyruvate kinase; Pdx-1, pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor-1; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase; SCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1.'
