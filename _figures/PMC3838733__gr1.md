caption: The conventional and branched cross-bridge cycles. (A) A simplified four-state
  version of the conventional model of the cross-bridge cycle (). In this model, Pi
  release is coupled to rotation of myosin’s lever arm and the rebinding of Pi to
  the AM.ADP state reverses this step. (B) Conventional (green) and branched (red)
  kinetic pathways where the rebinding of Pi to the AM.ADP state causes myosin to
  dissociate from actin in a postpowerstroke state and complete the release of Pi
  and ADP and the rebinding to ATP off actin. In this model, the powerstroke is not
  reversed with the rebinding of Pi to the AM.ADP state. From Walcott et al. (), we
  can specify all parameters of the green pathway. There are then four free kinetic
  parameters, boxed and shown in bold for the red pathway.
