caption: Summary of the cGAS–STING pathway and potential pathogen evasion strategies.
  Recognition of cytosolic double-stranded DNA triggers assembly of cGAS into DNA
  ladder structures, and liquid droplets. Oligomerization into a minimal 2:2 cGAS:DNA
  complex is required for activation to produce the second messenger 2′3′-cGAMP from
  ATP and GTP. 2′3′-cGAMP is subsequently recognized by STING which oligomerizes to
  form a signalosome complex and traffics to the ERGIC and perinuclear regions. This
  leads to recruitment of the downstream kinase TBK1 to promote innate immune signaling.
  Points in the pathway which are known (checked box) or potential (red open box)
  pathogen targets for restriction of cGAS–STING signaling are summarized on the right
  in the viral escape checklist.
