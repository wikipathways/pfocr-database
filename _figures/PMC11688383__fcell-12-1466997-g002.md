caption: The insults to airway epithelial cells, their impact on UPR and the consequences
  of UPR activation. Cigarette smoke, pollution, aging, and pathogens invade airway
  epithelial cells, causing oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and cellular
  damage. These insults lead to the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins
  within the ER lumen.The three signaling pathways of UPR are activated. PERK activation
  increases the formation of the transcription factor ATF4 that reduces protein synthesis.
  IRE1 activation results in the production of sXBP1, enhancing the protein folding
  capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum. Activated ATF6 stimulates the expression
  of UPR-related genes. Normally, the protective UPR and apoptotic signals are in
  a balanced state in a cell; however, this equilibrium might incline towards the
  proapoptotic condition as the damage worsens. If the UPR can successfully alleviate
  ER stress, the cell can restore protein homeostasis and thus survive. If ER stress
  persists, the UPR signal can activate the apoptotic pathway, leading to cell death
