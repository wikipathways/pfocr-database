caption: Schematic representation illustrating the mechanism of action of erianin
  in lung cancer. Pyrimidine biosynthesis, a process essential for DNA and RNA synthesis,
  has a crucial role in regulating cellular growth. The initial steps of this biosynthetic
  pathway are catalyzed by the enzyme complex, CAD, comprised of carbamoyl-phosphate
  synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase. CAD activation is mediated
  by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through S6K-mediated phosphorylation.
  This activation promotes pyrimidine biosynthesis and supports cell cycle progression
  by facilitating the formation of dihydroorotate, the first committed intermediate
  in the pathway. The early stages of pyrimidine biosynthesis depend on essential
  substrates, including HCO₃⁻ (bicarbonate) and aspartate. A critical subsequent step
  in the pathway involves dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a rate-limiting enzyme
  that catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate. This reaction is facilitated
  by the co-factor, flavin mononucleotide (FMN), which is reduced to FMNH₂ as it accepts
  electrons during the oxidation process. Inhibition of DHODH disrupts pyrimidine
  metabolism, leading to oxidative stress, nucleotide depletion, and an increased
  susceptibility to ferroptosis, highlighting a functional link between pyrimidine
  metabolism and ferroptosis. Erianin was identified as a molecular inhibitor of mTOR
  signaling in lung cancer. By suppressing mTOR phosphorylation, erianin impairs the
  activation of downstream effectors, including S6K and CAD. Consequently, erianin
  disrupts pyrimidine biosynthesis, leading to impaired nucleotide production and
  the inhibition of cell growth and proliferation. The dashed arrow in the schematic
  representation indicates that the pathway involves multiple intermediate reactions
  or multi-step processes, rather than a single direct enzymatic reaction
