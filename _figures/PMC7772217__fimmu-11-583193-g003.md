caption: Role of the inflammasome complex in modulating immune responses in a Toxoplasma
  gondii infection. (A) T. gondii-mediated NLRP1 inflammasome activation in Lewis
  rat bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), subsequently leads to the generation
  of the biologically active IL-1β and IL-18 cytokines and cell pyroptosis. T. gondii
  dense granule proteins GRA35, GRA42, and GRA43 are involved in NLRP1 inflammasome
  activation. In murine cells, multiple mechanisms including potassium K+ efflux,
  ATP, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and CASP11 are involved in NLRP3 activation
  in a T. gondii infection. Furthermore, NLRP1b is activated in parasitic infections,
  albeit through unclear mechanisms. (B) T. gondii infection activates both NLRP1
  and NLRP3 inflammasomes in human monocytic cells. T. gondii induces a Syk-CARD9/MALT-1-NF-κB
  signaling pathway and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome for IL-1β release, and GRA15
  directly activates NF-κB. Recent studies have reported that in human macrophages,
  IFN-γ impels guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1) to mediate cell apoptosis via the
  absent in melanoma (AIM2) inflammasome, ASC, and caspase-8 in a T. gondii infection.
