caption: Detailed schematic models representing changes in cellular processes with
  CdSe/ZnS QDs or InP/ZnS QDs in the budding yeast. Cellular processes are illustrated
  and labeled with the genes involved and whose normal regulation has been up or downregulated.
  (A) CdSe/ZnS QD exposure causes an increase in the expression of genes involved
  in cellular processes such as transmembrane transport/cellular homeostasis, vacuole
  acidification, amino acid metabolic activity, protein folding, and trafficking within
  the trans-Golgi network. (B) Decreased expression in many genes treated with CdSe/ZnS
  has revealed many important downregulated processes involved in endocytosis, the
  Cvt pathway, rRNA processing, proteasome assembly, metabolic activity, cell cycle
  regulation, and trafficking within the trans-Golgi network. (C) Yeast exposed to
  InP/ZnS QDs has upregulated many genes required for processes like endocytosis,
  peroxisome assembly, proteasome assembly and activity, the Cvt pathway, the ETC,
  and oxido-reduction metabolic processes. (D) Several more processes are downregulated
  when exposed to InP/ZnS QDs including endocytosis, rRNA processing, translation,
  the Cvt pathway, actin and microtubule growth, vesicle fusion, and protein targeting
  to the plasma membrane, and some trans-Golgi network trafficking.
