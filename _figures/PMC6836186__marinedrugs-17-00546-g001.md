caption: The signaling pathways that regulate autophagy and autophagy-related proteins
  that are affected by astaxanthin (AST). Low nutrients levels (glucose or amino acid
  withdrawal, oxygen deprivation) and cellular energy starvation activate AMPK, which
  inactivates mTORC1 via stimulation of TSC2. When mTORC1 is inactivated, dephosphorylated
  ULK1/2 and mAtg13 form a stable ULK complex (ULK1/2-mAtg13-FIP200 complex). The
  ULK complex is the regulator of the autophagy pathway that initiates organization
  of the phagophore membranes. Upon induction of autophagy, mAtg9, a major transport
  protein, transports membrane lipids from donor organelles to the phagophore. Two
  ubiquitin-like protein conjugation systems, mAtg12 along with its conjugate mAtg5
  and LC3 play roles in elongation and expansion of the phagophore to induce autophagosome
  formation and closure. In the Class III PI3K complex, hVsp34 works in concert with
  its regulatory adaptor proteins p150 and Beclin 1 to regulate vesicular trafficking
  and vacuolar protein sorting. p150 is required for association of hVsp34 with the
  phagophore membrane. Binding of Beclin 1 to Atg14L directs the class III PI3K complex
  to the phagophore, where it initiates both recruitment of the Atg machinery and
  phagophore nucleation. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTOR signaling is activated.
  Activated mTORC1 induces phosphorylation of mAtg13 and dissociation of the ULK complex
  leading to inhibition of autophagy. PIK3/Akt activates the mTOR pathway leading
  to inhibition of autophagy. JNK inhibits the mTOR pathway and increases expression
  of Beclin 1, mAtg5, and LC3, resulting in induction of autophagy. p38 increases
  expression of Beclin 1 and induces autophagy. In contrast, p38 phosphorylates ULK1
  and blocks ULK1 activation of its downstream effector mAtg13. Also, p38 inhibits
  starvation-induced autophagy by phosphorylating mAtg5 and blocking autophagosome
  fusion with lysosomes. p38 alters trafficking of mAtg9 and autophagosome formation.
  In the context of autophagy, AST stimulates or inhibits autophagy by increasing
  or decreasing LC3 and Beclin 1 depending on the experimental model used. In relation
  to Akt signaling, AST inhibits the activation of Akt, leading to induction of autophagy
  via the Akt/mTOR pathway and increases expression of Beclin 1 and LC3. AST blocks
  JNK and reduces the levels of the autophagy-related proteins Beclin 1 and LC3. AST
  inhibits p38 and JNK and, consequently, it reduces autophagy by modulating MAPK-mediated
  release of Beclin 1. Dotted lines represent autophagy activation by astaxanthin
  (by inhibiting Akt activation) or p38 (by increasing Beclin 1 level).
