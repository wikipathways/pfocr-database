caption: (a) Dynamics of CTLA-4 expression and membrane cycling. Following synthesis
  in the Trans Golgi Network (TGN), CTLA-4 binds to T cell receptor-interacting molecule
  (TRIM), promoting formation of CTLA-4-containing vesicles. TCR signaling-mediated
  calcium influx induces CTLA-4 release from the vesicles to the cell surface, and
  CTLA-4 and TRIM no longer associate. CTLA-4 externalization also depends on phospholipase
  D (PLD) and GTPase adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor 1 (ARF-1). Unphosphorylated
  CTLA-4 cytoplasmic domain binds to the clathrin adapter protein 2 (AP-2) which promotes
  rapid internalization to endosomes and lysosomes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the
  CTLA-4 cytoplasmic domain retards internationalization. Upon T cell activation,
  CTLA-4-containing endosomes are recycled to the cell surface; this is regulated
  by lipopolysaccharide-responsive and beige-like anchor protein (LRBA). Association
  of CTLA-4 with adapter protein 1 (AP-1) mediates shuttling from the TGN to lysosomal
  compartments for degradation, a mechanism that controls the overall abundance of
  CTLA-4 in the TGN.(b) CTLA-4 can exert T cell-intrinsic and T cell-extrinsic functions.
  Intrinsic control. (1) Inhibitory signaling. Signals through CTLA-4 can interfere
  with proximal signaling by the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28. (2) Competition for
  ligands. CTLA-4 is the higher affinity receptor than CD28 for CD80/CD86 and can
  outcompete CD28 for CD80/CD86 binding. (3) Promote adhesion or reduced stop signal.
  CTLA-4 can increase T cell/APC adhesion through a pathway mediated by LFA1 and decrease
  duration of APC/T cell interactions by inhibiting the TCR-mediated stop signal,
  resulting in reduced T cell activation. (4) Ligand-independent inhibition. A CTLA-4
  splice variant that cannot bind to ligands may inhibit T cell activation through
  a similar signaling pathway as full length CTLA-4. Extrinsic control(1) Reverse
  signaling through ligands into APCs. CTLA-4 may reverse signal through CD80 and
  CD86 into APCs, leading to IDO production and suppression of T cell effector responses.
  (2) Reduce ligand expression/availability. Secreted factors such as IL10, TGFp or
  soluble splice variants of CTLA-4 reduce ligand expression or availability. (3)
  CTLA-4 removes ligands from APCs. CTLA-4 binding to CD80 or CD86 can result in transendocytosis
  of the ligands from the APC, resulting in lower levels of ligands on the surface
  of APCs.
