caption: PHD2/3 and miR-155 negative-feedback loops are part of the regulatory network
  of HIF-1α in prolonged hypoxia. A computational model based on experimental data
  was generated to estimate the relative contributions of miR-155 and PHD2/3 in determining
  temporal HIF-1α activity during prolonged periods of hypoxia. (A) Temporal deviation
  from normal (transient) HIF-1α activity predicted by removal of the PHD2/3 feedback
  loop, the miR-155 feedback loop, or both feedback loops from the model are shown
  in red, green, and blue, respectively. (B) Schematic representation of the proposed
  network of known and predicted negative-feedback loops in the HIF-1a pathway. The
  “?” indicates currently unidentified direct or indirect negative-feedback mechanism(s).
  (C) Caco-2 cells were transfected with a vector containing an HRE promoter controlling
  expression of a secreted form of luciferase derived from Gaussia princeps and cultured
  under normoxia (21% O2; red) or hypoxia (1% O2; black). The medium was sampled every
  3 h, and the HRE-luciferase activity assessed for each time period and normalized
  to the cell number. Representative traces are shown for HIF activity in arbitrary
  units (AU).
