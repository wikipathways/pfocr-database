caption: Principal oxidative modifications of cysteinyl residues and their reduction
  pathways. Reactive cysteine residues mostly exist in thiolate forms at physiological
  pH and can form a sulfenic acid (SOH) by reacting with H2O2. This sulfenic acid
  is an intermediate for most other redox PTMs forming (i) intra- or intermolecular
  disulfide bonds, (ii) glutathione adducts in the presence of GSH, (iii) sulfenyl-amides,
  (iv) persulfides upon reaction with hydrogen sulfide, (v) thiosulfinates by reacting
  with another sulfenic acid, and (vi) sulfinic (SO2H) and sulfonic (SO3H) acids by
  further reacting with H2O2. Another possible glutathionylation pathway could rely
  on the reaction between a thiolate and nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). Interestingly,
  the latter compound will also promote S-nitrosylation reactions similarly, to some
  other derived forms of NO not represented here (see the text). Most of these redox
  PTMs are reversible and the enzymatic reduction of these different oxidation forms
  is essentially achieved by glutaredoxins (mainly glutathionylated proteins but also
  some disulfides) and thioredoxins (disulfides and possibly persulfides, nitrosothiols
  and some glutathionylated proteins). In addition to specifically reducing sulfinic
  acids formed on peroxiredoxins, sulfiredoxin (Srx) may also catalyze Prx deglutathionylation
  (; ). It is not yet demonstrated that plant Trxs have a denitrosylase activity.
  The reduction pathway of thiosulfinates, sulfenyl-amides is unclear but glutathione
  and subsequently Grxs might be involved.
