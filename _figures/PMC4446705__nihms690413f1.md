caption: 'Schematic representation of the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor signaling pathways.
  Both IL-4 and IL-13 signal predominantly or entirely through the IL-4Rα polypeptide,
  which is a component of two IL-4Rs: the type I receptor, composed of IL-4Rα and
  γc, and the type II receptor, composed of IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1. IL-4 signals through
  both IL-4Rs, whereas IL-13 signals only through the type II IL-4R. IL-13 also binds
  to the IL-13Rα2 chain, which does not contain a transmembrane signaling domain and
  is thought to act as a decoy receptor. The binding of IL-4 and IL-13 to their respective
  partners results in receptor dimerization of either the type I or the type II receptor
  complexes, which activates the JAKs associated with the cytoplasmic tails of the
  receptors. Type I receptors activate JAK1 and JAK3, whereas type II receptors activate
  JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2. Tyrosine residues in the IL-4Rα chain become phosphorylated
  and act as docking sites for signaling molecules. The first tyrosine residue interacts
  with protein-binding domains (PTBs) such as IRS proteins. Phosphorylated IRS binds
  to the p85 subunit of PI3K and to the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound
  protein 2 (Grb2). This pathway is linked to the proliferation of TH2 cells and the
  induction of genes associated with alternatively activated macrophages in response
  to IL-4. The second through fourth tyrosines of IL-4Rα interact with the SH2 domain
  of STAT6. Phosphorylated STAT6 dimerizes, migrates to the nucleus, and binds to
  the promoters of IL-4– and IL-13–responsive genes such as those associated with
  IgE class switching. STAT6 is dephosphorylated by various SH2 domain–containing
  phosphatases. IL-13 signaling through the type II receptor in nonhematopoietic cells
  may also activate STAT3 through the tyrosine residues on IL-13Rα1. Hematopoietic
  cells such as T and B cells express only the type I receptor, whereas cells of the
  myeloid lineage such as monocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts express both type
  I and type II IL-4Rs. Nonhematopoietic cells such as smooth muscle cells and epithelial
  cells predominantly express the type II receptor. The separate functions of IL-4
  and IL-13 arise from a combination of factors, including the ability of IL-4 alone
  to drive the proliferation of TH2 cells, IgE synthesis, and gene expression in alternatively
  activated macrophages through binding to its type I IL-4R. IL-13, but not IL-4,
  signaling through type II receptors preferentially drives the development of the
  pathological features of disease because of differences in the amount of IL-13 produced
  and the higher abundance of IL-13Rα1 as compared to that of IL-4Rα at the site of
  inflammation. Because the recruitment of eosinophils is not driven by the type II
  receptor, it is assumed that this occurs through the type I receptor, but the mechanisms
  involved are unknown.'
