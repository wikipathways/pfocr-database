caption: Schematic representation of metabolism rewiring in MM cells. MM cells are
  glycolytic. GLUT1/4, glucose transporters. The levels of GLUT1/4 are high and allow
  an elevated glucose uptake. Intracellular glucose is transformed into lactate by
  oxidative glycolysis. This multi-step catabolism is controlled by several glycolytic
  enzymes all overexpressed in MM cells such as HK2, PFK, PKM2, LDHA [,,,]. The end-product
  of glycolysis, lactate is secreted by MM cells. However, MM cells take up exogenous
  lactate produced by the surrounding TME. Lactate enters cells through the MCT1/4
  transporters and fuels OXPHOS fully performing in MM. Glutamine synthase is lacking
  in MM cells, therefore MM cells are dependent on glutamine uptake. By contrast,
  glutaminase (GLS) expression is increased []. PDH is a gatekeeper enzyme that converts
  pyruvate into acetyl-CoA and regulates the mitochondrial metabolism. PDK1 is a serine/threonine
  kinase that negatively regulates PDH, its inhibition induces MM cell death []. The
  serine metabolism is also involved in MM cell adaptation to BTZ treatment. Phosphoglycerate
  dehydrogenase, PHGDH, the first limiting enzyme of the SSP pathway that converts
  3-PG into PHP is elevated and increases GSH synthesis in BTZ-resistant cells [,].
  G6PD, the first rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP, converting G6P into 6PG, is elevated
  in MM cells and associated with an exacerbated flux []. Associated with increased
  mitochondrial biomass and function, MM cells have higher concentrations of ATP,
  NADH/NADPH ratio and mitochondrial membranes are hyperpolarized, all these changes
  leading to impaired drug response and resistance [,]. β-oxidation participates in
  the myeloma metabolism changes []. The abbreviations used in the  are gathered at
  the end of the text.
