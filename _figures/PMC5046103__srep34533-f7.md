caption: Upon MSU crystal stimulation, mTOR and p38 MAPK are rapidly phosphorylated
  in human primary monocytes, leading to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, Mnk1, MK2,
  and eIF4E, which are all predominant post-transcriptional regulators. Translational
  initiation and mRNA stability of pro-IL-1β in human monocytes is selectively regulated
  by p38 MAPK signaling pathway via MnK1 and MK2 phosphorylation, but not the mTOR
  signaling pathway.
