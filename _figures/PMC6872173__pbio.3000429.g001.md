  cholerae. One autoinducer–receptor pair consists of CAI-1, which is synthesized
  by CqsA and detected by the two-component sensor-histidine kinase, CqsS. The second
  autoinducer–receptor pair is AI-2, produced by LuxS and detected by LuxPQ, also
  a two-component sensor-histidine kinase. At LCD (left), both receptors act as kinases
  that promote phosphorylation of the response regulator, LuxO. Phosphorylated LuxO
  activates expression of genes encoding regulatory RNAs called the Qrr sRNAs. The
  Qrr sRNAs activate production of the LCD master regulator, AphA, and repress production
  of the HCD master regulator, HapR. These conditions drive biofilm formation and
  virulence factor production. At HCD (right), the autoinducer-bound receptors act
  as phosphatases that strip phosphate from LuxO, resulting in AphA repression and
  HapR production, conditions that promote the free-swimming, planktonic lifestyle
  and repression of virulence. (B) Two additional QS receptors, VpsS and CqsR, also
  funnel information into LuxO. Their cognate autoinducers and autoinducer synthases
  are not known. (C) A recently discovered QS pathway consists of the autoinducer
  DPO, synthesized by Tdh, and its partner receptor VqmA. At HCD, DPO-bound VqmA activates
  expression of a gene encoding a sRNA called VqmR. VqmR represses biofilm formation.
