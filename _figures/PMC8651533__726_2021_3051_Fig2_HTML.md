caption: 'Proline metabolism at a glance. The three main carbon sources for proline
  biosynthesis are glucose, glutamine and ornithine, which foster the reactions of
  PYCR1, 2 and 3/L. Proline and extracellular proline can then be recycled by PRODH
  during nutrient starvation or metastasis formation. Almost all the reactions of
  this pathway contribute to cellular redox control. Abbreviations: α-KG; α-ketoglutarate,
