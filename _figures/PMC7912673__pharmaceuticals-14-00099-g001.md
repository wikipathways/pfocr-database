  Aromatase catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens by aromatization of
  the A-ring. A-ring structure of androgens is noted by the red star. (CellCept) GTP
  synthesis increases cell anabolism through upregulation of inosine monophosphate
  dehydrogenase, IMPDH, the rate-limiting enzyme of the GTP nucleotide synthesis pathway
  [,]. IMPDH is inhibited by CellCept. (BMS-777607 and LY-2584702) Shown is the canonical
  oncogenic kinase signaling pathway downstream of TAM receptor, Axl. PTEN deficiency
  is depicted by transparency. (Imipramine Blue) Imipramine Blue, shown here in schematic,
  is thought to have an effect on cell migration due to its ability to inhibit NADPH
  oxidase, which catalyzes electron transfer to oxygen from NADPH, thereby limiting
  actin fiber formation. Importantly, O2− inhibits transcription factors critical
  to cell survival, including PTEN, Iκ-B, p53 []. (Verteporfin) Verteporfin can act
  as an inhibitor of the Yes-associated protein (YAP) and PDZ-binding motif (TAZ)
  family transcriptional coactivators [], which have roles in the Hippo and RTK signaling
  pathways. Verteporfin disrupts the interaction between YAP and TEAD transcription
  factors, which regulate the Hippo signaling pathway. Panel (B): Chemical structure
  of the molecules discussed above.'
