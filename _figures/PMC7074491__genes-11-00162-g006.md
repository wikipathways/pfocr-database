caption: Altered methylation of genes in the cholinergic synapse pathway. Depiction
  of genes involved in cholinergic signaling. Green represents genes hypermethylated
  in the reduced cognition group, red represents genes hypomethylated in the reduced
  cognition group, and grey represents genes without differential methylation. Blue
  circles represent acetylcholine, orange circles represent potassium, and purple
  circles represent calcium.
