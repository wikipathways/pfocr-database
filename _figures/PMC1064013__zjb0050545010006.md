caption: Summary of mutant phenotypes and model for FrzE signal transduction in directing
  A and S motility. (A) Hypothetical intramolecular phosphotransfer of FrzE for the
  various frz mutant strains constructed in this study and the corresponding reversal
  phenotypes. Phosphotransfer (“P”) from the “CheA” to the “CheY” portion of FrzE
  (or lack thereof) is illustrated for the mutants. The motility phenotype is indicated
  by arrows. The long, double-headed arrow stands for the wild-type (wt) reversal
  phenotype; single-headed arrows stand for the hyporeversal phenotype; and short,
  double-headed arrows stand for the hyperreversal phenotype. (B) Model for FrzE signal
  transduction in directing A and S motility. The phosphoryl group of FrzECheA could
  be transferred to either FrzECheY or another response regulator (RR), with FrzZ
  being a likely candidate. The two proteins are hypothesized to compete for phosphorylation
  by FrzECheA (pathways 1 and 2). Possible phosphotransfer reactions between the response
  regulator (RR) and FrzECheY are indicated (pathway 3). See Discussion for details.
