caption: 'Model for the role of microRNAs in the regulation of ‘tumor suppressor’
  pathways in Drosophila. The miRNA bantam is a key target of the transcriptional
  regulator Yorkie. Yorkie is under tight control of the Hippo pathway that consists
  of merlin and expanded at the membrane integrating signals from an unknown transmembrane
  receptor. In certain cell types in Drosophila, expanded mRNA is regulated by miR-278.
  Warts and Mats transduce the signal from Merlin/Expanded and Hippo/Salvador. Warts
  and Mats are also elements of Fat/Dachsous signaling (another Drosophila tumor suppressor
  pathway) through Dachs. Fat also can interfere with canonical Wnt signaling and
  activate noncanonical Wnt signaling. This could theoretically occur via the inactivation
  of Yorkie and Bantam: one of Bantam''s target mRNAs is Hid, which has been shown
  to inhibit canonical Wnt signaling.'
