caption: A) An episode of OGD-RP causes strong depolarization of CA3 PCs and neurotransmitter
  release, including glutamate and BDNF. BDNF can be released from the mossy boutons,
  filopodial extensions (), dendritic trees of CA3 PCs (Kuczewski et al., 2008) but
  also from astrocytes (). In response to the OGD-mediated depolarization, fast-spiking
  interneurons in Stratum Lucidum also exhibit increased glutamatergic activity modulated
  by TrkB receptors (Herrera-L칩pez, Barrionuevo and Galv치n, unpublished observations).
  B) The proposed mechanism by which BDNF/TrkB counteract the deleterious effects
  of OGD-RP in CA3 PCs requires downstream activation of the PI-3-K/Akt, and possibly
  activation of the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR), to promote cell survival.
  Activation of this signaling cascade maintain the membrane integrity, and reduces
  the expression of Caspase-3 enzyme in OGD-RP treated slices. Simultaneously, the
  BDNF-mediated activation of TrkB receptor causes a downregulation of the MAPK-ERK
  1/2 pathway and upregulation of the CaMKII pathway.
