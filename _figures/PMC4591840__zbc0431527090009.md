caption: Hypothetical model of the results of the present study. Mammary gland involution
  is characterized by the apoptosis of epithelial cells, decreases in milk production,
  collapse of lobular-alveolar structures, and adipocyte repopulation. After weaning,
  Nucling expression is up-regulated through the NF-κB signaling pathway to mediate
  mammary gland involution by the expression of Calpain-1 and IL-6. Nucling also induces
  STAT3 activity via the gp130 expression to regulate involution by the modulation
  of M2 macrophage recruitment and expression of C/EBPδ. Therefore, Nucling controls
  mammary gland involution by regulating NF-κB and STAT3.
