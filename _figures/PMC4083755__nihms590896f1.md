caption: The role of the mitochondria in the generation of purines and thymidylate
  for DNA synthesis. Reactions 1, 3, 4, and 5 occur in both the mitochondria and the
  cytoplasm, with reaction 2 limited only to the mitochondria. Reaction 1 and 2 are
  catalyzed by SHMT2 and the glycine cleavage system, respectively. In the cytoplasm,
  reactions 3, 4, and 5 are carried out by the trifunctional enzyme (MTHFD1); in the
  mitochondria, 2 enzymes are required (MTHFD2 catalyzes reactions 3 and 4 and MTHFD1L
  catalyzes reaction 5). The enzyme 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (not
  shown) has been reported to be absent in most cancer cells (). Serine hydroxymethytransferase
  (1); glycine oxidase complex (2); 5–10 methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase
  (3); methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (4); and formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase
  (5).
