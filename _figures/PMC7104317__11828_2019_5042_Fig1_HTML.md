caption: 'Induction of TLR3-dependent cell signaling pathways in response to exposure
  to dsRNA. Binding of extracellular dsRNA or dsRNA absorbed during endocytosis or
  phagocytosis to TLR3 leads to receptor phosphorylation and binding to the adapter
  molecule TRIF, which serves as a platform for assembly of proteins involved in triggering
  signaling pathways leading to activation of IRF-3 (7) or NF-κB. In the case of the
  NF-κB signaling pathway, activated TRIF interacts with TRAF6, after oligomerization
  the latter acquires ubiquitin-E3-ligase activity, causing ubiquitination of both
  TRAF6 and RIP1 protein. The polyubiquitin sequence is recognized by the TAK1-binding
  proteins TAB2 and TAB3, which promote TAK1 kinase binding to the complex. RIP1 with
  attached ubiquitin molecules is recognized by NEMO, resulted in IKK complex binding
  to the TRIF–RIP1–TRAF6–TAB–TAK1 complex. TAK1 phosphorylates the IKKb subunit of
  the IKK complex, promoting its activation. Phosphorylated IkB binds to ubiquitin
  undergoes proteasomal degradation with release of NF-κB, which migrates into the
  nucleus, where it binds to the IFN-β promoter. For activation of the IRF-3 (7) pathway
  TRAF3 binds to TANK or NAP1 and SINTBAD peptides, which, in turn, interact with
  TBK-1 and/or IKKε; their activated forms are able to phosphorylate IRF-3. Activation
  of the factor IRF-7 occurs similarly. In the nucleus, activated IRFs bind in the
  region of the IFN-β promoter with NF-κB and ATF-2/c-jun, resulting in the involvement
  of cofactors and RNA polymerase II and initiation of transcription. Abbreviations:
  TRIF—Toll—interleukin (IL)-1-resistance (TIR) domain-containing adaptor inducing
  IFN-β ; IRF—interferon regulatory factor; NF-κB—nuclear factor κB (nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells); TRAF6—TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6; RIP1—receptor-interacting protein 1; NEMO—NF-κB essential modifier; IKK—inhibitor
  of nuclear factor κB kinase; TAK1—transforming growth factor β-activated kinase
