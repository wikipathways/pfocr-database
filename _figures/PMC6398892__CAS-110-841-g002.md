caption: Regulation mechanism of ECM/integrin/EphA1‐mediated cell adhesion. A, Co‐immuno‐precipitation
  of EphA1 and integrin β1. GFP‐fused EphA1‐expressing HEK293 cells were stimulated
  with Fc‐ephrin‐A1 (2 μg/mL). EphA1 was co‐immuno‐precipitated with integrin β1 without
  affecting tyrosine phosphorylation status of EphA1. B, Regulatory signaling pathway
  of ECM/integrin/EphA1‐mediated cell adhesion. In the absence of ephrin‐A1 stimulation,
  ILK is in active. ECM/integrin signal provides cell spreading mediated by Rac1 activation.
  Once EphA1 is stimulated with ephrin‐A1, ILK is inactivated. Subsequently, the Rac1
  GTP‐bound form is hydrolyzed by Rac1 GTPase activating protein followed by RhoA
  activation, which in turn induces cell retraction
