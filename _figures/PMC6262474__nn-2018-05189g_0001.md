caption: Schematic to explain BC immunotherapy by combined delivery of an immunogenic
  cell death stimulus plus an inhibitor of the IDO-1 pathway. Doxorubicin (DOX) delivery
  to the tumor site provides an effective stimulus for immunogenic cell death (ICD),
  which is characterized by calreticulin (CRT) expression (an “eat-me” signal for
  dendritic cell uptake) on the cancer cell surface. Subsequent release of adjuvant
  stimuli, HMGB-1 and ATP, by the dying cancer cells induce DC maturation and tumor
  antigen presentation to naïve T-cells. Recruitment of CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes
  (CTLs) triggers a full-fledged immune response, provided that the tumor infiltrating
  lymphocytes (TILs) can escape the immunosuppressive micromilieu at the BC tumor
  site. These immunosuppressive pathways include a contribution by FOXP-3+regulatory
  T cells, autoregulatory effects of immune checkpoint receptors (e.g., PD-1) and
  the metabolic effects of the overexpressed IDO-1 immune surveillance pathway. The
  small molecule inhibitor, indoximod (IND), interferes in the IDO-1 pathway. We propose
  that simultaneous delivery of DOX and IND through the use of a nanocarrier can effectively
  combine the use of an ICD stimulus and interference in an immune surveillance pathway
  for the development of BC immunotherapy. The improved pharmacokinetics of drug delivery
  by the nanocarrier allows achievement of sufficiently high tumor drug levels to
  trigger an effective and sustained immune response for the reduction or elimination
  of the primary BC tumor and its metastases.
