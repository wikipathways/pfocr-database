caption: Structure and signaling machinery of the Met receptor. Met is an α/β heterodimer
  formed by a completely extracellular α subunit and a transmembrane β subunit that
  contains the tyrosine kinase activity. The extracellular region of Met encompasses
  a large Sema domain - which spans the α subunit and part of the β subunit, folding
  into a β-propeller structure - a cysteine-rich domain and four repeats of an unusual
  type of immunoglobulin-like domain. The intracellular portion of Met includes the
  kinase domain - with two catalytic tyrosines (Tyr1234 and Tyr1235) that enhance
  the receptor enzymatic activity following transphosphorylation - and key tyrosine
  residues in the carboxy-terminal tail (Tyr1349 and Tyr1356). Phosphorylation of
  these distal tyrosines creates docking sites for several interactors, many of which
  are schematized here. Recruitment of these signaling effectors activates downstream
  pathways that together enable biological execution of the invasive growth process.
  The Ras-Erk/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade launches a program of
  transcriptional modulation that involves changes in the expression of cell-cycle
  regulators and extracellular matrix proteinases. Ras also stimulates the Rac1/Cdc42-PAK
  pathway, which, together with the Gab1-Crk-C3G-Rap1 axis, regulates the activity
  of cytoskeletal and adhesion molecules such as cadherins, Arp, N-WASP, paxillin,
  integrins and focal adhesion kinase. The Gab1-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt
  pathway encourages cell survival by inhibiting the proapoptotic molecule Bad and
  the apopototic effector caspase 9.
