caption: Schematic of the VEGF-A/NRP1 signaling pathway to promote cancer cell proliferation.
  Schematic of a new pathway of NRP1 signals leading to the proliferation of cancer
  cells. Cancer cell-secreted VEGF-A binds to NRP1 in an autocrine manner and stimulates
  complex formation by GIPC1, a scaffold protein, and Syx, RhoGEF, via the NRP1 cytoplasmic
  region. The GIPC1/Syx complex increases the activation of RhoA in order to induce
  the degradation of p27 and consequently promotes cancer cell proliferation.
