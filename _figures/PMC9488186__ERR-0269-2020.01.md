caption: Simplified schematic diagram of the activators and substrates of mammalian
  target of rapamycin complexes (mTORC)1 and mTORC2 in the context of fibrosis. a)
  mTORC1 activity is highly dependent on RAS homologue enriched in brain (Rheb), which
  is under negative regulatory control by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1/2. TSC1/2
  converts RhebGTP into RhebGDP. For mTORC1 to become activated through this axis,
  TSC1/2 must therefore be inhibited. The phosphorylation of different sites within
  the TSC1/2 complex in response to extracellular signal-regulated kinaes (ERK) and
  phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathways leads to activation
  of mTORC1; whereas activation of 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses
  mTORC1. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 can activate PI3K/AKT, ERK and AMPK
  (through TAK1), however, the inhibition of neither of those kinases is able to modulate
  TGFβ1-mediated mTORC1 activity. In the presence of amino acids, the Rags can release
  TSC1/2 from the lysosome and instead recruit mTORC1 to bring it into close contact
  with Rheb. Upon activation, mTORC1 phosphorylates its substrates Eukaryotic Translation
  Initiation Factor 4E Binding Protein 1 (4E-BP1), ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1
  (p70S6K), sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and Unc-51 Like Autophagy
  Activating Kinase 1 (ULK1) which in turn regulate extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition,
  senescence, lipid synthesis and autophagy. b) mTORC2 activity is highly dependent
  on PI3K activity. Upon activation, mTORC2 phosphorylates AKT, SGK1 and protein kinase
  C (PKC) to control cell growth, ion transport and cytoskeleton rearrangement.

  description: Simplified schematic diagram of the activators and substrates of mammalian
    target of rapamycin complexes (mTORC)1 and mTORC2 in the context of fibrosis.
    a) mTORC1 activity is highly dependent on RAS homologue enriched in brain (Rheb),
    which is under negative regulatory control by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1/2.
    TSC1/2 converts RhebGTP into RhebGDP. For mTORC1 to become activated through this
    axis, TSC1/2 must therefore be inhibited. The phosphorylation of different sites
    within the TSC1/2 complex in response to extracellular signal-regulated kinaes
    (ERK) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathways leads
    to activation of mTORC1; whereas activation of 5' AMP-activated protein kinase
    (AMPK) suppresses mTORC1. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 can activate PI3K/AKT,
    ERK and AMPK (through TAK1), however, the inhibition of neither of those kinases
