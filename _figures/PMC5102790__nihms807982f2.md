caption: 'A. MCPyV oncoproteins drive cellular transformation through interaction
  with host proteins. Shown are the domain structures of MCPyV LT and sT as well as
  the cellular targets that they interact with to drive cancer development. CR1: conserved
  region 1; OBD: Origin Binding Domain; LSD: LT-stabilization domain. B. Molecular
  signaling contributing to MCPyV infection. Induction of MMP genes by the WNT/β-catenin
  signaling pathway and other growth factors, such as EGF and FGF, stimulates MCPyV
  infection. MMPs may contribute to MCPyV infection by disrupting the extracellular
  matrix of the host cells. In the physiological skin environment, skin damage induced
  by UV/ionizing radiation (IR) and wounding processes can activate both WNT signaling
  and MMP expression. Aging skin also shows dramatically increased MMP expression.
  Therefore, these major MCC risk factors may promote viral infection to drive MCC
  tumorigenesis.'
