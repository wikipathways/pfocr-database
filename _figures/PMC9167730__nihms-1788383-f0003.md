caption: The conventional TLR-dependent signaling is mediated via membrane recruited
  MyD88/TRIF proteins, that result in phosphorylation and nuclear import for NFκB
  complex, thereby transcriptionally upregulating pro-inflammatory molecules, such
  as IL-6, IL-1β and TNFα. A second arm of TLR-dependent signaling results in AKT-dependent
  phosphorylation and degradation of FOXO3, that results in de-repression of IFN I
  pathway, resulting in transcriptional upregulation of IFN I. Novel small molecule
  allosteric agonists, such as LA1, activate CD11b that results in recruitment of
  kinases Src and Syk, leading to phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of MyD88/TRIF
  downstream of TLRs. This leads to suppression of p65 phosphorylation and reduced
  nuclear translocation of NFκB, suppressing generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  IL-6, IL-1α and TNFα. Allosteric activation of CD11b also suppresses AKT phosphorylation,
  decreasing pFOXO3 levels, that allows import of FOXO3 to repress IRF3/IRF7 mediated
  expression of IFNα/β.
