caption: Differences in the cell cycle machinery of β cells (a) and undifferentiated
  embryonic stem (ES) cells (b). The cell cycle of ES cells is shortened relative
  to that of β cells. An abbreviated G1 phase is responsible for the difference in
  cell cycle length. a In β cells, mitogen signaling through the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activates CDK4–cyclin D kinase activity, thus hypophosphorylating
  retinoblastoma protein (pRB), which then leads to release of E2F, allowing it to
  activate transcription of genes necessary in the progression of the cell cycle.
  b In ES cells, mitogen signaling through the MAPK pathway seems to be irrelevant
  in the progression of cell cycle. Cyclin E–CDK2 expression is cell cycle-independent
  and constitutively active throughout the cell cycle, which allows the transition
  of ES cells from M phase directly to late G1. The resulting absence of the cyclin
  D-dependent early G1 phase shortens the G1 phase and the entire cell cycle. In beta
  cells, cyclin D–CDK4 is highly active but cyclin E–CDK2 is absent, making the cell
  cycle between these two cells highly different
