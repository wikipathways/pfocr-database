caption: Schematic representation of the important connections between cancer cell
  signaling and the regulation of alternative splicing that the manuscript summarizes.
  Shown are the key components of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), activated rat
  sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS), rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/ v-akt murine
  thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) pathways as well as the wingless (Wnt) pathway.
  Their activation can occur by the several oncogenic mechanisms described in the
  manuscript and lead to the modulation of splicing factor (SF) activity, localization
  or expression levels, as exemplified. These modifications have consequences for
  the choice of alternative exons during pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and cause
  the expression of variant proteins with distinct functional properties. These variants
  provide selective advantage for tumor cell progression and some of the examples
  described in the manuscript are mentioned.
