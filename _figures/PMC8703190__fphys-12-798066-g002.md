caption: A schematic model of action of the Smoothened receptor signaling on GABAergic
  transmission in the immature hippocampus. (1) Activation of the non-canonical Smo
  signaling pathway by its ligand (SAG) leads to an intracellular calcium increase
  in the post-synaptic neuron which can be mediated either through calcium channels
  or by the release of intracellular stores from the endoplasmic reticulum. (2) The
  intracellular increase in calcium concentration triggers the exocytosis of BDNF.
  (3) BDNF binds to its receptor TrkB on neighboring synapses and (4) increases GABAergic
  synaptic transmission.
