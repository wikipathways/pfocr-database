caption: Hypothetical schematic image of the pathogenesis pathway for Alzheimer’s
  disease is shown. Inflammation trigger, amyloid-β, X-ray, and UV irradiation all
  contribute to the ROS formation. The uncontrolled generation of ROS and oxidative
  stress mediated by inflammation and/or amyloid-β might contribute to neuron apoptosis
  via the hyper-phosphorylation of tau protein. Note that some critical pathways such
  as NADPH oxidase activation have been omitted for clarity.
