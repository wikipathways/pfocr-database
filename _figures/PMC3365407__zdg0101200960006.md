caption: 'Working model for moderate (A) vs. severe AIH (B)-induced pLTF, a form of
  phrenic motor facilitation (pMF). A: moderate AIH. 1) During moderate hypoxia, we
  postulate that classical pLTF is triggered via the “Q” pathway (5-HT2 receptor dependent).
  The dominant “Q pathway” to pMF during moderate hypoxia likely occurs from new BDNF
  synthesis and subsequent activation of its high-affinity receptor, mature TrkB.
  At the same time, activation of A2A receptors (Gs coupled) via adenosine elicits
  the less dominant “S pathway” to pMF. We suggest that new TrkB synthesis (immature
  form) within phrenic motor neurons normally results in a constraint on the “Q” pathway
  during moderate hypoxia. 2) Inhibition of 5HT receptors via methysergide inhibits
  moderate AIH-induced pMF. 3) MSX-3 spinal delivery inhibits A2A receptors and results
  in enhanced pMF, most likely as a result of a constraint on the “Q” pathway being
  relieved. B: severe AIH. 4) During severe hypoxia, we postulate that pMF is triggered
  via the “S” pathway. The “S” pathway likely occurs from severe AIH causing release
  of adenosine/ATP from neurons/glia and subsequently activating A2A receptors to
  cause new TrkB synthesis (immature form) within phrenic motor neurons and elicit
  pMF. We suggest that at the same time, the “Q” pathway is inhibited due to inhibition
  from the “S” pathway. 5) MSX-3 spinal delivery before severe AIH inhibits A2A receptors
  and results in attenuated pMF. 6) Methysergide spinal delivery before severe AIH
  does not affect severe AIH-induced pMF; thus the “Q” pathway is not constraining
  the “S” pathway during severe AIH.'
