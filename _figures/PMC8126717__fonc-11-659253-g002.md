caption: 'The different processes involved in therapy resistance in AML (stem) cells.
  Plasticity and therapy resistance: Within the hypoxic BM niche, persistent AML (stem)
  cells might exist prior to drug treatment or might become resistant and obtain leukemia
  re-initiating potential upon exposure to a treatment, such as chemotherapy or venetoclax.
  The transcriptional signature of AML LSCs is associated with “stemness” and leukemia-initiating
  capacity. LSCs aberrantly express lymphoid and myeloid antigens, including CD123,
  CCL1, CD25, CD32, CD44, GPR56 and IL1RAP. These cell surface markers differ within
  and between individual AML patients and can change during the course of the disease.
  Different processes are involved to induce therapy resistance: Epigenetically regulated
  therapy resistance (yellow box): LSCs and therapy-resistant AML cells show modulated
  expression of components of the PRC2 complex (i.e. EZH1/2), upregulation of BET
  proteins (i.e. Brd4), and altered methylation profile caused by enhanced HDM activity
  (i.e. LSD1, KDM2, KDM4, and KDM6) and HMT activity (i.e. DOT1L and G9a). These differential
  epigenetic processes induce transcriptional deregulation of genes, like MEIS1, Myc
  and HOXA. Microenvironment and therapy resistance (green box): In response to hypoxia,
  HIF-1α signaling promotes expression of VEGF, CXCR4, and SCF. CXCR4 on AML cells
  interact with CXCL12, increasing stromal protective effects. VEGF expressing ECs
  protect VEGFR3-expressing AML cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, due to
  increased BCL2/Bax ratios. LSCs express VLA-4, VLA-5 and LFA-1 on their cell surface,
  which interact with the stromal ligands VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and fibronectin to support
  attachment to stromal cells, promoting NF-κB signaling. SCF enhances anti-apoptotic
  and proliferative effects of fibronectin expressed on AML cells. Pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, including TNFα, influence cell adhesion, promoting LSC survival and chemotherapy
  resistance through modulation of NF-κB signaling. Several members of the TGFβ family
  suppress proliferation of AML cells and enhance chemotherapy resistance. Metabolism
  and therapy resistance (orange box): AML LSCs often lack the ability to enhance
  glycolysis and therefore switch from anaerobic glycolysis to mitochondria-mediated
  OXPHOS to generate ATP. Therapy-resistant AML cells show increased mitochondrial
  mass and high OXPHOS. In addition to glucose, FFA can by metabolized to drive the
  TCA cycle and OXPHOS. Adipocytes, the major MSC present in the BM, support survival
  of AML cells by stimulating FAO and OXPHOS through fatty acid transfer. Part of
  the LSC population expresses the fatty acid transporter CD36 to control uptake of
  FFA. CPT1, regulated by PPAR, controls FAO translocation by conjugating FFA with
  carnitine for translocation into the mitochondrial matrix. FABP4 is involved in
  the interaction of adipocytes with LSCs. Furthermore, LSCs are able to reduce ROS
  production generated by mitochondria in response to hypoxia, by activation of autophagy.
  Inhibition of BCL2 by venetoclax efficiently reduces LSC survival by impairing homeostasis
  and inhibiting OXPHOS. Integrated Stress Response induced resistance (blue box):
  In response to stress stimuli, such as ROS, the PERK-eIF2α ISR pathway is activated
  in LSCs. eIF2α is phosphorylated by GCN2 or PERK, reducing global protein synthesis
  while allowing translation of specific genes, including ATF4. Increased activity
  of the ISR pathway protects LSCs to enable restoration of homeostasis favoring survival.
  Signaling and therapy resistance (purple box): Upregulation of FOXM1 activates the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by direct binding to β-catenin, inhibiting its degradation,
  preserving LSC quiescence and promoting LSC self-renewal. Overexpression of miR-126
  repress multiple components of the PI3K/Akt pathway, resulting in the proliferation
  of LSCs, delayed G0 exit of LSCs and enhances resistance to combination chemotherapy.
