caption: SSA significantly impacts cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing
  apoptosis, suppressing invasion, reducing cell growth, and alleviating skin toxicity.
  It inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation via ERK pathway suppression and
  COX-2 expression. In gastric cancer, SSA activates CROS, Ca2+, LDH, NOX4, and Caspase
  pathways to induce apoptosis. It triggers mitochondrial apoptosis in bladder cancer
  and inhibits neuroblastoma invasion by targeting P-VEGFR1, P-src, and P-AKT. In
  prostate cancer, SSA induces apoptosis through AKT/mTOR pathway inhibition, and
  in pancreatic cancer by suppressing P-EGFR, P-AKT, and P-PI3K signaling. In breast
  cancer, it inhibits proliferation via Bax/Bcl-2, c-myc, and CXCR-4 modulation, while
  reducing growth by affecting Th1/Th2 balance and the PI3K/AKT pathway. SSA also
  induces breast cancer cell apoptosis through mitochondrial pathways and DNA damage
  and promotes keratinocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway, alleviating
  skin toxicity by suppressing immune responses
