caption: Sulfur amino acid metabolism, and its connections with the one carbon metabolism.
  The essential sulfur amino acid l-methionine is the precursor of homocysteine (Hcy)
  in the methionine-Hcy cycle (green), in which methionine is first enzymatically
  activated to S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in an ATP-dependent reaction. AdoMet
  is the universal methyl donor for about 50 different methyltransferases. The AdoMet
  demethylated product, i.e., AdoHcy, is the immediate Hcy precursor in a fully reversible
  reaction. AdoHcy is a powerful competitive methyltransferase inhibitor, although
  under normal conditions, this inhibition is hampered by prompt removal of AdoHcy
  hydrolysis products (Hcy and adenosine). Hcy can be remethylated to methionine,
  in a reaction catalyzed by methionine synthase, a l-5-methyltetrahydrofolate-dependent
  (MTHF) enzyme, yielding tetrahydrofolate (THF). Hcy is also the precursor of l-cysteine
  through transsulfuration (blue), a two-step pyridoxal phosphate-dependent pathway,
  catalyzed by cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) which condenses l-serine and Hcy, forming
  cystathionine, followed by its hydrolysis to l-cysteine (Cys) and α-keto-butyrate
  (α-KB), catalyzed by cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE). Cys is in turn the precursor of
  glutathione (GSH). Both CBS and CSE may independently catalyze hydrogen sulfide
  (H2S; yellow) biosynthesis, by using Cys (or Hcy as an alternative substrate) (see
  also ). The partitioning of sulfur amino acid metabolism between transsulfuration
  and H2S formation is highly regulated. CBS and CSE are crucially regulated by many
  modulators, also including the availability of cystathionine produced by CBS. It
  has been reported that, under acute conditions, in human embryonic kidney cells,
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, induced by thapsigargin treatment, induces CSE
  and triggers a change from the transient induction of the complete transsulfuration
  pathway to preferential H2S production. An increase of CO, produced by heme-oxigenase-2
  overexpression in these cells, inhibits CBS and, in the absence of ER stress, switches
  CSE activity from the cystathionine hydrolysis mode, where cystathionine is converted
  into cysteine (and eventually GSH), to H2S production from cysteine. The latter
  condition may mimic the consequences of chronic CBS-impairing mutations underpinning
  homocystinuria []. Conversely, in hemodialysis patients, both oxidative stress and
  cystathionine are increased [].
