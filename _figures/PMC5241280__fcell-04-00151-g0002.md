caption: '(A) The Notch signaling pathway. In the Golgi, after being glycosylated
  by members of the Fringe family, pre-Notch is cleaved by a Furin-like convertase
  into the extracellular and intracellular domains (termed the S1 cleavage), resulting
  in a heterodimeric receptor with non-covalently associated domains that is transported
  to the plasma membrane. The Fringe modifications introduced in the Golgi affect
  sensitivity of the receptor on the signal-receiving cell to the DSL (Delta-Serrate-Lag2)
  ligands, in the signal-sending cell. Following ligand-receptor interaction, trans-endocytosis
  of the Notch extracellular domain, by the signal-sending cell, exposes the second
  so called S2 cleavage site, facilitating intramembranous cleavage by an ADAM (a
  disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain) protease, in the extracellular domain.
  S2 cleavage, in turns, exposes the S3 proteolytic cleavage site within the transmembrane
  domain, which is cleaved by the γ-secretase complex and liberates the intracellular
  domain of Notch (NICD), allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and thus activate
  transcription of target genes. In order to prevent inappropriate signaling from
  the pool of Notch that has not been activated by ligand, Notch receptor is continuously
  internalized into early endosomes and thus degraded. (B) Zoom-in into the nucleus
  of the signal-receiving cell (A). Once released into the nucleus, NICD binds the
  DNA-binding protein CSL as well as the SKIP protein. The trimeric complex thus recruits
  Mastermind-like protein (MAM), which recruits additional co-activators (not shown),
  required for the transcriptional regulation of Notch target gene expression. Kinases,
  such as CDK8 and GSK3β, phosphorylate (p) NICD on its PEST domain, rendering it
  susceptible to recognition by Fbxw7 E3 ligase, leading to ubiquitination (Ub) and
  subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In the absence of NICD, CSL associates
  with transcriptional co-repressors blocking Notch target gene activation. Target
  genes are repressed until more NICD is produced to re-initiate a new cycle of target
  gene expression. (C) Notch ligands and receptors. In the signal-receiving cell,
  the four mammalian Notch receptors (Notch1-4) are represented. They are expressed
  on the cell surface as heterodimers and characterized by epidermal growth factor
  (EGF)-like and LIN repeats in their extracellular region. The intracellular domain
  includes an RBP-Jκ-associated molecule (RAM) domain, seven ankyrin (ANK) repeats,
  two nuclear localization signals (NLS), a transactivation (TAD) domain (lacking
  in Notch3 and Notch4), and a Proline-, Glutamate-, Serine-, and Threonine-rich (PEST)
  domain. The five Notch ligands (Delta-like 1, 3, and 4 and Jagged 1 and 2) are represented
  on the surface of the signal-sending cell. Each ligand contains an EGF-like repeat
  region and a conserved domain DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag). A conserved cysteine-rich
  (CR) domain is also present on Jagged1 and Jagged2. The DOS (Delta and OSM-11) domain,
  containing two atypical EGF repeats, is part of Dll1, JAG1 and JAG2 ligands. (D)
  SCFFbxw7 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex representation. The upper part of the figure
  shows Fbxw7 domains: a conserved dimerization motif, which mediates dimerization
  of the SCF complex and thus facilitates ubiquitin conjugation; the F-box, which
  binds the SCF complex through Skp1; the WD40, containing three specific amino acid
  residues, which binds the phosphorylated substrate. In the bottom part of the figure
  the SCFFbxw7 complex is schematically represented. In general, in the ubiquitin
  system, three enzymes are involved in the signaling cascade: the ubiquitin-activating
  E1, the ubiquitin-conjugating E2 and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The first step is ATP-dependent
  and involves the binding of ubiquitin to E1. Ubiquitin is then activated and transferred
  to E2. The ubiquitin-E2 complex then interacts with a specific E3 (SCFFbxw7, refer
  to main text for a description), which recognizes the substrate (phosphorylated
  NICD, in this case) and facilitates transfer of the ubiquitin molecules to the substrate,
  leading to substrate degradation by the 26S proteasome.'
