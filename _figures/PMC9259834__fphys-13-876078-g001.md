caption: Smad and non-Smad mediated signaling pathway of MSTN. MSTN binds to the ACVRIIB
  and ALK4/5 complex resulting in successive phosphorylation of Smad2/3, leading to
  its binding with Smad4 and translocation of the complex to the nucleus. Non-Smad
  signaling, on the other hand, tends to suppress the AKT intracellular signaling
  pathways. Both Smad and non-Smad mediated signaling cause gene transcriptional alterations
  in the nucleus, as well as activation of muscle atrophy marker genes (MuRF1 and
  Atrogin1), resulting in muscle loss. Extracellularly, MSTN pathway inhibitors can
  bind MSTN directly or bind its receptor complex to prevent MSTN from interacting
  with its receptor complex and triggering downstream signals.
