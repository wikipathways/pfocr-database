caption: '(A) Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exhibit condense and immature mitochondria,
  low metabolic status and high glycolytic activity, as suggested by low ATP, low
  ROS and low membrane potential (ΔΨ) which uphold stemness of the HSCs, in contrast
  to progenitors and more differentiated cells that exhibit high mitochondrial activity
  and utilize oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Furthermore, stabilized hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1α (HIF1α) in HSCs can support self-renewal and stemness potential. (B) Mechanisms
  of metabolic regulation of HSC function. Under hypoxic conditions, cytokine TPO
  and MEIS1 can stabilize HIF1α to promote glycolysis by regulating glycolytic pathway
  enzymes including HK, hexokinase; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; PFK, phosphofructokinase
  2; PKM2, pyruvate kinase M2. HIF1α can also controls HOXB4 and pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase (PDK) activation that prevents pyruvate oxidation by suppressing the pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation and leading to
  maintenance of HSC quiescence and stemness. ROS, Reactive Oxygen Species: MEIS1,
  Meis Homeobox 1; TPO, thrombopoietin; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; HOXB4, Homeobox
  B4; PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase;'
