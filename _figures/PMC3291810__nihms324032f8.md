caption: The model depicts PAK1 mechanism of action to activate the RAS-MAPK (Orange)
  pathway through direct activation of RAF1 and MEK1. The second arm (Purple) shows
  that PAK1 and Merlin are in an inhibitory loop, which can be pushed by PAK1 amplification
  and overexpression to inhibit Merlin that leads to MET signaling activation through
  GAB1.
