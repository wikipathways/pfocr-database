caption: Pathogenesis of HMGB1 in vitiligo. Stimulated melanocytes (MCs) exhibit activation
  of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and JAK signalling pathways, both of which facilitate
  the nuclear translocation and subsequent release of HMGB1. Extracellular HMGB1 can
  bind to the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) on melanocytes,
  thereby activating the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT) signalling pathway and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway.
  This activation mediates the release of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
  (SASP). On the one hand, HMGB1 binds to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and RAGE receptors
  on the surface of keratinocytes (KCs), which stimulates KCs to secrete CXC chemokine
  ligand 16 (CXCL16). On the other hand, HMGB1 binds to TLR4 and RAGE located on the
  surface of dendritic cells (DCs), which promotes the migration of DCs to lymph nodes
  and the activation of T cells. After activated T cells migrate from the lymph nodes
  into blood vessels, CXCL16 secreted by KCs recruits T cells to lesions and accelerates
  the progression of vitiligo disease
