caption: Response strategies of plants to cold stress. When cold stress occurs, plant
  cells can sense and transduce cold signals, COLD1 senses low temperature and triggers
  Ca2+ channels (ANNEXIN1 and CNGCs) to transport Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. Further,
  Ca2+ signaling pathway activates the ICE1-CBF-COR cascade (through the Ca2+-binding
  proteins and kinases, MAPK cascade pathway) and ROS homeostasis (through the NADPH
  oxidase pathway). In this process, ICE1-CBF-COR cascade and ROS homeostasis are
  involved in CBF-dependent ways to respond to cold stress. In addition, plant hormone
  signaling pathways also regulate plant cold tolerance through CBF-dependence and
  ROS homeostasis, indicating a cross interconnections between these pathways
