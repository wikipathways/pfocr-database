caption: Schematic overview of study design. Lung cancer is used as an illustrative
  example. (A) The lung cancer susceptibility network was constructed from the lung-expressed
  products of genes that are located within 10 kb of independent lung cancer-associated
  SNPs (‘key proteins’) along with mutual tissue-specific interaction partners (‘linking
  proteins’). (B) This cartoon depicts protein participants in a pathway from the
  Reactome database. Key proteins for lung cancer are bubbled in yellow. (C) Key proteins
  for both lung cancer and breast cancer involved in the same pathway are bubbled
  in orange, the intersection of yellow and red. Shared and unique key proteins between
  other cancer pairs are portrayed analogously. (D) Formula for the hypergeometric
  pathway enrichment P-value.
