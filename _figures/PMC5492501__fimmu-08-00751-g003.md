caption: Schematic representation of N-myristoyltransferase functions during T cell
  activation. (A) Simultaneous cross-linking of T cell receptor, CD3, and CD28 on
  cell by the peptide presented on the major histocompatibility complex on the antigen-presenting
  cell (APC) induces myristoylation (Myr) of Lck which then associates with either
  CD4 or CD8, leading to the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
  motifs (ITAMs) of CD3. This mediates recruitment of ZAP-70 that activates Lat. Phosphorylated
  Lat serves as a docking site, recruiting multiple adaptor proteins essential for
  mediating downstream signals during T cell activation. PLC is among the several
  signaling proteins recruited by activated Lat, PLC mediates the activation of protein
  kinase C (PKC), which in turn activates myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate
  (MARCKS). Formins (FNML) are equally activated in parallel by geranylgeranylated
  (Ger) cell division control protein 42, which helps in maintaining membrane plasticity
  that is very essential during the formation of immunological synapse. Also, inositol
  triphosphate, product of PLC, initiates calcium signaling by binding to its receptor
  on the endoplasmic reticulum. Binding of Ca2+ ion to FUS1, a calcium-myristoyl protein
  switch, promotes the release of the myristoyl group from the myristoyl-binding hydrophobic
  pocket and anchoring of the protein in mitochondrial membrane structures ensuring
  mitochondrial calcium handling. (B). However, knockout or inhibition of NMT activity
  makes Lck to be predominantly cytosolic. Cytosolic Lck is unable to phosphorylate
  ITAMs and as a consequence cannot reconstitute T cell downstream signaling pathway.
  Similarly, non-myristoylated MARCKS and FNMLs are unable to induce membrane plasticity.
