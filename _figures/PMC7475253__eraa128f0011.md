caption: A simplified model showing the role of AtHSPR in GA- and light intensity-dependent
  regulation of flowering time and seed set in Arabidopsis. Under long-day (LD), short-day
  (SD), and low light-intensity conditions, AtHSPR may interact with OFP1 and KNAT5
  and affect the expression of GA synthesis genes (GA3ox and GA20ox) and GA catabolism
  genes (GA2ox), which subsequently activates GA-dependent signaling. AtHSPR may also
  interact with the light intensity-dependent pathway to promote flowering time and
  seed set. Lines with arrows indicate promotion, lines with blocked ends indicate
  inhibition.
