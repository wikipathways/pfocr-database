caption: Model summarizing the functional relationship between the early recycling
  pathway and BDNF/TrkB signaling. (A) In dendrites, BDNF increases the activity and
  reduces the mobility of Rab11-endosomes, fostering the local recycling of TrkB in
  dendrites and increasing local BDNF signaling (Lazo et al., ). On the other hand,
  BDNF transiently increases the activity of Rab5, a process that increases the number
  and mobility of Rab5 endosomes in dendrites. Since Rab5 early endosomes are upstream
  of Rab11 recycling endosomes, increased activity of Rab5 may, on the one hand, foster
  the Rab11-dependent recycling of TrkB in dendrites and, on the other hand, increase
  the transport of Rab5 endosomes to the soma. (B) In the soma, increased activity
  of both Rab5 (this paper) and Rab11 (Lazo et al., ) by BDNF may increase the cell
  body recycling of TrkB, increasing the long-lasting signaling of BDNF required for
  dendritic growth. Increased activity of the TORC1 complex by BDNF increased the
  protein levels of Rab5 and Rab11 acting as a positive feedback loop that contributes
  to BDNF-induced dendritic branching.
