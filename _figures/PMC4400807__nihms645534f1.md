caption: A simplified schematic of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) identifying
  the point of entry of glucose, fructose and glucosamine into the pathway. GFAT=
  glutamine:fructose-6-phospahte aminotransferase, the enzyme which controls flux
  of glucose into the HBP. OGT= O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase, the enzyme
  which transfers a single N-acetylglucosamine by O-glycosidic (O-GlcNAc) linkage
  to serine or threonine residues of proteins. O-GlcNAcase= the enzyme that reverses
  O-GlcNAc protein modification.
