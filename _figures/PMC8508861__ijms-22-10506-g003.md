caption: PDT activation of the apoptotic and necrotic pathways. During PDT, the PS
  becomes activated from its singlet ground state to its excited singlet state. With
  continued light irradiation the PS undergoes an intersystem, crossing to its excited
  triplet state. Two types of reactions can occur depending on the availability of
  free radicals and molecular oxygen. These include type I and type II reactions.
  In type I, photo-oxidation occurs with the use of free radicals, while in type II
  reactions it occurs with the use of molecular oxygen. The apoptotic pathway will
  take place via the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. Intrinsic pathway results from
  DNA fragmentation and ER stress. Extrinsic pathway is activated by the death ligand
  on the membrane surface. Necrosis will occur due to ATP depletion.
