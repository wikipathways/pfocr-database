caption: 'Highlights of tumor metabolism. The diagram depicts metabolic reprogramming
  in tumor cells with overexpression of transporters meant for nutrient uptake, pH
  regulation, and receptors for cytokines, hormones, and other ligands. Internal components
  include prominent metabolic pathways of bioenergetics and biosynthetic machinery,
  including carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism, integration of metabolic networking
  for efficient utilization of substrates like glucose, fructose, lactate, acetate,
  amino acids, and precursor of membrane components. Signal transduction events indicate
  a crucial role of PI3K, HIF-1α, AKT, Ras, Myc, and mTOR downstream to receptor–ligand
  ligation with promoting consequences on metabolic pathways. The exterior of the
  membrane depicts a manifestation of the Warburg effect and modulation of the TME.
  Altered mitochondrial functions and its correlation to lipid metabolism, ROS generation,
  and glutamine assimilation are also depicted. The overall effect of such cross-talk
  of metabolic pathways resulted in the promotion of neoplastic cell survival. The
  diagram also indicates the metabolism-dependent regulation of gene expression. Carbohydrate
  metabolism is indicated by the golden color; cell signaling is indicated by the
  red color; alternative fuels and their cytoplasmic fates are indicated by the teal
  color; pH regulators are depicted by the orange color; choline metabolism is shown
  in purple color; enzymes of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis are indicated by
  the yellow color; pink color represents folic acid metabolism; kynurenine and tryptophan
  pathways are depicted by the black and white boxes; amino acid transporters are
  shown in black; and major phenomena are indicated in boxes of gray color. Abbreviations:
