caption: Proposed sequence of steps in the pathogenesis of salt-dependent hypertension.
  The “interventions,” listed at the left, indicate some of the pharmacologic and
  genetic manipulations that were used to test the proposed sequence, as discussed
  in this review. Genotype nomenclature for genetically-engineered mice is given in
  the text and in  and  legends. Interventions shown in green increase traffic through
  the pathway and promote BP elevation; those shown in red block traffic through the
  pathway and prevent BP elevation or lower BP. Modified from Ref. .
