caption: 'A. Working model of scytonemin biosynthesis based on genomic analyses. UV‐A
  is absorbed and activates the proposed gene cluster to produce the corresponding
  protein products localized according to putative protein domains. UV‐A is blocked
  by scytonemin accumulated in the cyanobacterial sheath, which ultimately deactivates
  the transcription of the gene cluster and eliminates the need for the putative protein
  products.   B. Proposed biosynthetic pathway for scytonemin and associated gene cluster in Nostoc
  punctiforme ATCC29133. Green genes are predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis
  of (precursors of) aromatic amino acids, while most of the red genes (e.g. scyA–scyF)
  are predicted to be involved in scytonemin biosynthesis. Continuous arrows signify
  gene products that are functionally characterized, whereas broken arrows indicate
  the gene products that are still to be functionally characterized.   Adapted from ) and ), with kind permission from Springer Science+Business Media.'
