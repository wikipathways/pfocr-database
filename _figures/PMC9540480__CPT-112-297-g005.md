caption: Activation of the TLR7/8 pathway by ssRNA viruses (such as SARS‐CoV‐2), RNA‐containing
  immune complexes, or the dual TLR7/8 agonist R848 is blocked by enpatoran. Downstream
  cytokines IL‐6 and IFN‐α were used in PD assessments to indirectly assess TLR7/8
  occupancy by enpatoran. CR, complement receptor; DC, dendritic cell; FcR, Fc receptor;
  IFN, interferon; IRF7, interferon regulatory factor 7; IRAK1/4, interleukin receptor‐associated
  kinases 1 and 4; IL‐6, interleukin‐6; mDCs, MYD88, myeloid differentiation primary
  response 88; NETosis, neutrophil extracellular trap death; NF‐κB, nuclear factor‐kappa
  B; PD, pharmacodynamic; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SARS‐CoV‐2, severe acute respiratory
  syndrome‐coronavirus 2; ssRNA, single‐stranded RNA; TLR7/8, toll‐like receptor 7/8;
  TNFα, tumor necrosis factor alpha. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
