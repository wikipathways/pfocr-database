caption: Bmi1 represses p16ink4a, which in turn inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases
  4/6 (CDK4/6) from binding to cyclin D. CDK4/6-cyclin D complexes are required for
  the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) family of proteins. In the absence
  of CDK4/6-cyclin D complexes, Rb remain in their inactive hypophosphorylated form.
  After phosphorylation, Rb release the elongation factor 2 (E2F) group of transcription
  factors. E2F activate the transcription of various genes that are required for progression
  from the G1-phase of the cell cycle, through the restriction point and into the
  S-phase. After passing the restriction point, the cell becomes committed to the
  cell cycle even in the absence of external proliferation stimuli. Figure adapted
  from [].
