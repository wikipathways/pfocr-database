caption: Proposed reaction mechanism of CarA and the C-glycoside metabolic pathway
  in soil and intestinal bacteria. (A) In C-glycoside metabolism, the C-glycoside
  is oxidized by an FAD-dependent enzyme (CarA) in soil bacteria or NAD-dependent
  enzyme (DgpA) in intestinal bacteria followed by a C–C bond-cleavage reaction through
  β-elimination. (B) CarA catalyzes FAD-dependent glycoside 3′ oxidation. 1, carminic
  acid; 2, 3′-keto carminic acid (compound X1). The numbering of the amino acid residue
  in this figure is that for CarA.
