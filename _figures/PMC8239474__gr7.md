caption: Schematic diagram of the possible mechanism of Mito-Tempo against glutamate-induced
  cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Extracellular glutamate concentration causes redox
  imbalance, which subsequently decreased MMP and increased autophagy signaling pathway
  (LC3-I/LC3II and p62), leading to initiate neuronal death. Mito-Tempo may counteract
  glutamate-induced neurotoxicity by increased SOD activity, which might contribute
  to inhibit ROS production. Mito-Tempo may provide neuronal protective effects against
  glutamate insult via modulating the function of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which
  is essential pathway in promoting cell survival. Taken together, these events protect
  SH-SY5Y cells from oxidative stress and promote SH-SY5Y cells survival.
