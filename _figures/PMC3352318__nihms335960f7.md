caption: 'Association of mitochondrial peptidyl Cys with functional networks according
  to reduction and oxidation of Cys residues. Percent reduction values for Cys more
  reduced than average (Panel A) and more oxidized than average (Panel B) were analyzed
  by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. In A, more reduced peptides (n=24) associated with
  functional networks of lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry and cancer
  (Score 39). In B, more oxidized peptides (n=13) associated with cellular function
  and maintenance (Score 36). Abbreviations: ADCYAP1, adenylate cyclase activating
  polypeptide 1; ECHS1, short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase; ETFA, electron-transferring
  favoprotein-A; ETFB, electron-transferring favoprotein-B; GLUD1, glutamate dehydrogenase-1;

  mitochondrial carrier homolog-2; NDUFAB1, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit
  AB1 (ACPM, acyl carrier protein, mitochondrial); SHMT2, serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2;
