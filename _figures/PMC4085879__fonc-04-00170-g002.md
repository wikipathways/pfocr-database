caption: 'Potential targets in T-ALL: PI3K/AKT/mTOR, cyclin D3:CDK4/6, BRD4/MYC. (A)
  BET bromodomain inhibitors displace BET bromodomain, such as BRD4, from chromatin
  by competitively binding to the acetyl lysine recognition pocket and lead to the
  repression of BRD4 transcriptional targets. (B) CDK4/6 inhibitors specifically inhibit
  CDK4 and 6, thereby inhibiting retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation in early
  G1. Inhibition of Rb phosphorylation prevents CDK-mediated G1-S-phase transition,
  thereby arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase, suppressing DNA synthesis, and
  inhibiting cancer cell growth. (C) PI3K catalyzes phosphorylation of the D3 position
  on phosphoinositide to generate the second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4-5
  trisphosphate (PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol-3,4 bisphosphate (PIP2). PIP3 binds
  to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of the 3′ phosphoinositide-dependant kinase
  (PDK-1) and AKT causing both proteins to translocate to the cell membrane where
  they are subsequently activated. AKT activation stimulates metabolism, cell-cycle
  progression, survival and migration through phosphorylation of many physiological
  substrates, including mTOR. The tumor suppressor PTEN inhibits PI3K signaling by
  the dephosphorylation of PIP3. AKT can activate mTOR directly by phosphorylation
  at S2448 or indirectly by inhibition of the tuberous sclerosis complex TSC2. Potential
  inhibitors of the above described pathway are indicated in red.'
