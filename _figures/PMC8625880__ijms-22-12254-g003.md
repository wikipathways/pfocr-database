caption: 'The NER pathway. (i) DNA damage can be recognized by XPC/HR23B/CETN2 and/or
  DDB1/2, which detect helix distortions caused by lesions during GG-NER, or indirectly
  upon RNA pol II stalling at a DNA lesion during TC-NER. Stalled RNA pol II tightly
  binds CSB complexed with CSA and UVSSA/USP7. After damage recognition, the TFIIH
  complex, which includes the helicases XPD and XPB as subunits, is recruited to the
  site of damage, and TFIIH further recruits XPA and verifies the existence of the
  damage. RPA binds to ssDNA, and endonuclease XPG is recruited to the complex by
  TFIIH, forming the TFIIH-XPA-RPA-XPG pre-incision complex. (ii) The endonuclease
  XPF-ERCC1 complex recruited by XPA incises 5′ to the lesion. Subsequent incision
  by XPG occurs, releasing the oligonucleotide containing the damage. (iii) The gap
  is filled and ligated. Green line: newly synthesized DNA.'
