caption: Model of Crosstalk between Cold Response and Flowering Time Regulation.Arrows
  indicate promotion, and T bars indicate repression. In cold early spring or fall,
  the expression of CBF genes is activated by the cold signal, and the increased CBFs
  activate FLC expression, which eventually delays flowering time. By contrast, in
  warm late spring, floral induction occurs and the increased SOC1, GI, FVE, and FPA
  suppress the CBF-dependent cold response pathway.
