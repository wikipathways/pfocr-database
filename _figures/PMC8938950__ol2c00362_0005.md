caption: 'Reaction conditions: 0.05 mmol substrate, 1 mol % A, 1 mL of DCM, 100 bar
  H2, 16 h, rt. The stereochemistry was tentatively assigned by assuming a similar
  hydrogenation pathway as that of 1a, the absolute configuration of which was assigned
  by comparing the sign of the optical rotation with the literature value after the
  reduction of 2a with LiAlH4. Isolated yields. Enantiomeric excess was determined
  by SFC analysis using chiral stationary phases.'
