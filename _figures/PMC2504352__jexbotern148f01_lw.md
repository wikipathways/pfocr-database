caption: 'The phenylpropanoid pathway for the biosynthesis of anthocyanin and three
  monoligols. ρ-Coumaroyl CoA is at the junction of the metabolic routes leading to
  anthocyanin synthesis or to lignin production. Enzymes in each step: PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, ρ-coumaroyl-CoA synthase;
  CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone-flavanone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase;
  F3′H, flavanone 3′-hydroxylase; DRF, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin
  synthase; AGT, anthocyanin glycosyltransferase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:skimimate/quinate
  hydroxycinnamoyltransferase; C3H, ρ-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA
  3-O-methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase;
  COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase.'

  anthocyanin synthesis which is controlled by the NLA gene.
