caption: Comparison of the mevalonate biosynthetic pathways in insects and vertebrates.
  Modified after. Insects do not have the gene coding for squalene synthase. As a
  result, they cannot synthesize cholesterol by themselves. Some chemical structures
  of endogenous sesquiterpenoids, retinoic acid and the SERCA-pump blocker thapsigargin
  (which is also a sesquiterpenoid) are also represented.
