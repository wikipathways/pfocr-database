caption: The Hippo pathway regulation of advanced prostate cancer. a. During androgen
  deprivation, Wingless (WNT) signaling drives the nuclear translocation of YAP and
  AR, resulting in YAP and AR target gene induction []. Additionally, YAP and AR colocalize
  in the nucleus and induce gene expression independently from WNT signaling or androgen
  availability []. b. α3β1 integrin stimulates the kinase activity of Arg/Abl, which
  phosphorylates 190RhoGAP, resulting in the inhibition of RhoA GTPases. Consequently,
  YAP/TAZ are phosphorylated via LATS1 activity and/or actin rearrangement and retained
  in the cytoplasm. α3β1 loss results in the disruption of this signaling cascade,
  inducing prostate cellular migration and metastasis []. c. PTEN and SMAD4 activity
  loss results in YAP hyperactivation. YAP signaling induces the recruitment of inflammatory
  cells []. d. LAST2 impedes AR receptor activity and restricts the binding of AR
  to the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter []. e. EZH2 and c-MYC cooperate
  to induce methylation and silencing of MST1, which might induce AR activity [].
  g. ETV1/4/5 activate TAZ, triggering metastasis via the induction of SH3BP1 [].
