caption: Insulin like growth factor (IGF) and insulin receptor (IR) signaling system.
  The availability of IGF-1 and IGF-2 ligands is highly influenced by IGFBPs (IGF-binding
  proteins), whereas insulin has direct access to its receptor. IGF-2 can also be
  sequestered by IGF-2R, which does not activate downstream signaling. Tyrosine-kinase
  receptors, such as holo-IR, IGF-1R/IR hybrids and holo-IGF-1R phosphorylate their
  adaptor proteins (IRSs), by this way conducting to downstream receptor signaling
  activation. Phosphoinsitide 3-kinase (PI3K)—Akt—mammailian target of rapamycin (m-TOR)
  is a critical pathway in IGF-1R signaling. ( IGF1, 2—insulin-like growth factor
  1 and 2, IGFBPs—IGF binding proteins, IR—insulin receptor, IGF-1R—insulin-like growth
  factor receptor-1, IGF-2R—insulin-like growth factor receptor-2, IRS—insulin receptor
  substrate)
