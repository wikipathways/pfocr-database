caption: In Healthy Donors (HD, left panel) and High Responder Tuberculosis patients
  (HR TB, left panel), SAP is associated with NTB-A, dislodging SHP-1 and inducing
  the expression of target genes such as FASL, increasing the TCR signal strength
  that triggers the RICD process after TCR restimulation. The exclusion of FYNT and
  the involvement of proteins like IL-2 and its receptor CD25, ensure the homeostasis
  of T cells in response to M. tuberculosis. On the other hand, Low Responder Tuberculosis
  patients (LR TB, right panel) suppress the induction of apoptosis by the recruitment
  of FYNT to NTB-A cytoplasmic tail. This association abrogates NTB-A signaling to
  sustain the viability of T cells. Furthermore, cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein
  could lead to an inhibition of FAS receptor as a consequence of the low expression
  of IL-2. Similar to LR TB, SAP-deficient T cells of XLP patients show a resistance
  to RICD, inhibiting NTB-A signaling and allowing cells to escape from apoptosis.
  Solid arrows represent regulation based on experimental evidence; dotted arrows
  represent inferred regulation.
