caption: 'Reduced Tdo2 expression leads to reduced Trp flux through the kynurenine
  pathway (KP). (A) Predicted flux through the large amino acid transporters SLC7A5
  and SLC7A8 in hepatocytes under hypoxia (maroon bars) as compared to control normoxic
  hepatocytes (white bars). The abbreviations used for the transporters are SLC7A5—large
  neutral amino acids transporter small subunit 1 (LAT1) and SLC7A8—large neutral
  amino acids transporter small subunit 2 (LAT2). ECM – extracellular matrix (n=3).
  (B) Graphical depiction of the changes in the flux through the different enzymes
  involved in the Trp metabolic pathway upon exposure to either normoxia (white bars)
  or hypoxia (blue bars). Microarray data generated from primary murine hepatocytes
  exposed to either 48 h hypoxia or normoxia as described in , was integrated into
  a mathematical model of Trp metabolism to calculate the fluxes through the different
  enzymes. (n=3) The abbreviations used for the enzyme names are DDC: dopa decarboxylase;
  TPH1: L-tryptophan hydroxylase 1; IL4I1: interleukin 4 induced 1; INMT: indolethylamine
  methyltransferase; KATs: kynurenine aminotransferases; KYNU: kynureninase; KMO:
  kynurenine 3-monooxygenase; HAAO: hydroxyanthranilic acid oxidase and QPRT: quinolinic
  acid phosphoribosyltransferase. Data represented as mean ± S.E.M. Statistical significance
  is assumed at p < 0.05 (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). ns, not significant.'
