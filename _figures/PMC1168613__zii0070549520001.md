caption: Comparison of the D. melanogaster innate immunity pathway with homolog pathways
  in C. elegans and mammals. In mammals and D. melanogaster, Toll-like receptors are
  crucial in the recognition of microbial pathogens prior to the elicitation of innate
  immune responses. The C. elegans Tol-1 receptor is apparently not involved in this
  process. The intracellular TIR domain of Toll interacts with a similar domain contained
  in the MyD88 conserved protein. In mammals, this leads to the activation of both
  MAPKs and NF-κB that ultimately activates the innate immune system. Similarly, Toll
  activation triggers innate immunity in D. melanogaster through the activation of
  the NF-κB-like transcription factors Dorsal and DIF. Upon the recognition of microbial
  pathogens, a C. elegans receptor(s) yet to be identified activates innate immunity
  through a Tir-1/MAPK signaling pathway. As in mammals, C. elegans defense responses
  involve the activation of microbial killing pathways and apoptotic pathways. Although
  caspases are required for the activation of innate immunity in D. melanogaster,
  an apoptotic defense response has not yet been reported.
