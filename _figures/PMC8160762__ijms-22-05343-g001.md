caption: Schematic depiction of the cellular constituents of the blood–brain barrier
  (BBB) and a model of glutamate trisynapses with presynapses, postsynapses, and astrocytes.
  (A) The BBB is formed by capillary endothelial cells and pericytes and surrounded
  by astrocytes. The complex tight junctions of endothelial cells and astrocytes contribute
  to severely restricted penetration and protect against circulating toxins or pathogens
  in the brain. (B) In glutamatergic trisynapses, glutamate is released from glutamatergic
  presynaptic neurons and binds to the GluN2 subunit of NMDARs postsynaptically. Meanwhile,
  the GluN1 subunit of the NMDARs is occupied by D-serine or glycine, which is released
  from astrocytes as coagonists to activate NMDARs. The activation of NMDAR removes
  Mg2+ and opens the ion channel. In astrocytes, glucose is converted to L-serine
  via the glycolysis pathway with 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), and then
  serine racemase (SR) converts L-serine to D-serine, which is released into the synaptic
  cleft. D-Serine is also metabolized by D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) to hydroxypyruvate
  in astrocytes. In addition, astrocytes also participate in the glutamate–glutamine
  cycle. Glutamate is taken up by astrocytes and readily converted into glutamine
  by glutamine synthetase (GS). In return, glutamine is released into the extracellular
  space and taken into presynaptic terminals. Astrocytic adenosine A2A receptors regulate
  excitatory amino acid transporter expressions and glutamate uptake.
