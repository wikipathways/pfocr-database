caption: Simplified circuitry cartoon showing the interaction between PDE10A pathway
  and dopaminergic signaling in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of striatum. Intercellular
  cAMP levels in MSNs is modulated by adenylate cyclase and PDE10A. Adenylate cyclase,
  which catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP, is activated by D1 signaling and
  suppressed by D2 signaling. Concordantly, D2 inhibition induced by (−)-eticlopride
  removes the suppression of adenylate cyclase, resulting in increased cAMP levels,
  which lead to compensatory upregulation of PDE10A to hydrolyze overexpressed cAMP.
