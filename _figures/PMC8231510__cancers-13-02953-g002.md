caption: 'Cellular responses to RAS-driven production of reactive oxygen species.
  In physiological conditions, RAS proteins (KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS) alternate between
  their GDP- and GTP-bound states which are regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange
  factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) []. Binding of a receptor tyrosine
  kinase (RTK) to its ligand induces its dimerization and autophosphorylation, which
  in turn allows the recruitment of SH2 domain-containing proteins such as GRB2 that
  recruits the GEF protein SOS which then activates RAS [,]. In cancer, RAS is activated
  by a number of mechanisms including activating mutations in one of the RAS genes,
  overexpression of RTKs, and loss of GAP proteins (reviewed in []). In its GTP-bound
  state, RAS activates a number of downstream effector pathways that elevate the level
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in multiple ways []. The mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathway leads to the transcriptional activation of NOX1 which codes
  for NADPH oxidase 1, a member of the NADPH oxidase enzyme family that catalyzes
  the one-electron transfer of oxygen to generate superoxide at the plasma membrane
  [,]. In addition, phosphorylation of the p47phox Nox1 subunit by protein kinase
  C δ (PKCδ) induces its translocation to the plasma membrane []. Another study provided
  evidence that RAS-induced ROS production is dependent on RAC1 and NOX4, another
  member of the NADPH oxidase enzyme family []. The RAF–MEK–ERK pathway causes the
  transcriptional repression of sestrin family genes, SESN1 and SESN3, which code
  for antioxidant modulators of peroxiredoxins []. Another important signaling pathway
  downstream of RAS is the pleiotropic PI3K/AKT pathway []. Importantly, the PI3K/AKT
  pathway is frequently activated in human cancers in a RAS-independent manner following
  a mutation or amplification of PIK3CA which codes for the p110α catalytic subunit
  of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or following inactivation of PTEN, a
  gene encoding the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensing homolog, which dephosphorylates
  phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2), thereby terminating PI3K-dependent signaling []. The accumulation of PIP3
  facilitates the localization of PH domain-containing proteins such as AKT and PDK1
  to the plasma membrane where AKT is activated following its phosphorylation by PDK1
  [,,] and mTORC2 [,,]. Activated AKT phosphorylates a large number of proteins involved
  in diverse cellular processes []. Importantly, PI3K/AKT signaling has been implicated
  in the activation of NOX activity [,]. Moreover, phosphorylation of AKT induces
  its translocation to the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane [], where it can
  phosphorylate GSK-3β, thereby lifting the negative regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase
  and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, two complexes that produce superoxide and H2O2
  [,,]. Note that reactive oxygen species (ROS) do not travel through the cell since
  they react with the next molecule. However, ROS can be converted into H2O2 which
  moves into the cells and penetrates the nucleus, where it can be converted into
  hydroxyl radicals (•OH−) when it comes in contact with ferrous ions []. Hydroxyl
  radicals in turn cause oxidative DNA damage, and sustained DNA damage eventually
  causes cellular senescence. Cells can adapt via two mechanisms: (1) increased expression
  of antioxidants following inactivation of KEAP1 and/or upregulation of NRF2 [],
  or (2) increased expression of BER enzymes and accessory factors such as CUT domains
  [,,,,,].'
