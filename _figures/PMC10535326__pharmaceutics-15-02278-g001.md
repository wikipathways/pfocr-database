caption: The regulatory mechanism of AMPs on macrophages (Drew in Figdraw.). AMPs
  inhibit apoptosis of macrophages, and enhance proliferation and phagocytosis of
  macrophages. AMPs inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory responses through P2X7R receptors
  or TLR2/4 receptors. AMPs inhibit Akt-p38 phosphorylation and NF-κB activation in
  different pathways induced by LPS through different receptors. Moreover, AMPs enter
  macrophages directly to block IKK phosphorylation, inhibit NF-κB pathway activation
  and production of the inflammatory factors.
