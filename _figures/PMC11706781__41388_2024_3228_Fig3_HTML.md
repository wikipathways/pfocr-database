caption: The TME composition varies between cancer type and organ site. A The release
  of VEGFA from tumors and other cell types in the TME such as Treg cells and TAMs
  contributes to excessive angiogenesis and the formation of immature blood vessels
  that are unable to effectively deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste within
  the TME. This further exacerbates the harsh conditions as metabolites such as glucose
  and glutamine are scarce, which are critical for the function of cells involved
  in anti-tumor immunity such as CD8+ T cells. Altered glucose and changes in nutrient
  sensing signaling pathways such as mTORC1 also affect the localization of cells
  within the TME, and the formation of hypoxic niches sequester TAMs and CD8+ T cells.
  Besides poor infiltration, TECs also contribute to immunosuppression by expression
  of ligands PD-L1 and FasL, which contribute to T cell dysfunction. Intrinsic TEC
  metabolism also contributes to angiogenesis and poor barrier integrity, promoting
  tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. Lastly, uptake of LCFAs by CD8+ T cells
  have immunosuppressive effects, and it was recently shown that VEGFB-mediated delivery
  of LCFAs across ECs has tumor-promoting effects in the lungs. B Targeting angiogenesis
  with traditional VEGF/VEGFR2 inhibitors in combination with immunotherapy has synergistic
  effects as tumor vessel normalization facilitates T cell infiltration and tumor
  killing abilities, which in turn reduces the feedback loop of excessive angiogenesis
  from tumor cell-derived pro-angiogenic factors. Additionally, targeting EC metabolism
  in pathological angiogenesis could also be a potential treatment approach for targeting
  tumor vessel normalization and improved immunotherapy efficacy and decreased metastasis
