caption: The Nodal signaling pathway in melanoma. (A) Classic Nodal signaling involves
  binding to a heteromeric complex composed of Cripto-1 and Activin type I (Alk4/7)
  and Type II (ActRIIB) serine threonine kinase receptors. Nodal activation of the
  Type I/Type II receptor complex induces phosphorylation and activation of Smad2/3/4.
  The activated Smad2/3/4 complex translocates to the nucleus where it activates the
  transcription of target genes, including Nodal itself. (B) Notch signaling involves
  the cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) by activated gamma-secretase
  (g-SC). NICD is then capable of binding to a multimeric activator complex (AC) and
  translocate to the nucleus where it regulates the expression of target genes. Recently
  we have shown that Notch4 can positively regulate Nodal expression in aggressive
  human melanoma cells. (C) Nodal has been shown to control plasiticity of melanoma
  cells for example during vasculogenic mimicry where melanoma cells acquire endothelial-like
  characteristics and organize to form vascular-like networks. Nodal expression in
  melanoma has also been associated with progression of melanoma from radial growth
  phase to vertical growth phase to metastatic spread.
