caption: Generally accepted allicin biosynthetic pathway (). Feeding studies performed
  by Granroth have shown serine and GSH to be key metabolites of this process, as
  they are integrated into SAC (). AsFMO has been proposed to oxidize SAC, producing
  alliin, which is subsequently hydrolyzed by alliinase into allyl sulfenic acid and
  pyruvate. Allyl sulfenic acid then reacts with another allyl sulfenic acid, producing
  allicin.
