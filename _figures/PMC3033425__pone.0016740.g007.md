caption: A hypothesis of how pro-inflammatory TNFα is up-regulated by IPNV infection
  and how it regulates the apoptotic and necrotic death pathways. When a cell is infected
  with IPNV (E1-S), the virus binds to the cellular receptor, penetrates the cell,
  uncoats (the entry stage), and up-regulates the expression of TNFα (a) during the
  early replication stage (0–6 h p.i.). This up-regulation of TNFα regulates the next
  wave of gene expression, including the pro-apoptotic genes bad and bid, during the
  early-middle stage of replication (6–12 h p.i.; b), at which point the TNFR necrotic
  signaling complex and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced. During this stage,
  phosphatidylserine (PS) is externalized and endonuclease is released from the mitochondria,
  resulting in DNA restructuring and cleavage. Furthermore, the cell finally enters
  the post-apoptotic, necrotic stage during the middle-late stage of replication (12–18
  h p.i.; c). During the late replication stage (18–24 h p.i.; d), the cells are broken
  down. The TNFα-mediated death signal is halted by treatment with a specific inhibitor
  of TNFα production. (e) TNFα-specific siRNA or AG-126, which block both the pro-apoptotic
  Bad/Bid-mediated death pathway and the TNFR/ROS-mediated secondary necrotic death
  pathway. (f) DPI, Nec-1 or RIP-1-specific siRNA, which block the activity of RIP-1
  or Nox1 and block the formation of the TNFR necrotic signaling complex. (g) BHA
  blocks the formation of ROS.
