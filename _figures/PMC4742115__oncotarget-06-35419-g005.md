caption: A. – C. & E. – G. Gene network analysis for key genes involved in age-dependent
  splenic changes for old mice compared to all other age groups. Pathway analysis
  was done with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. IFNG, IL5, and TNF were
  added to the network to provide relations and connections between all genes. Predicted
  activity due to other genes is also shown for these two genes. Log2 fold changes
  to the gene expression were used to obtain different shades of green for regulation
  levels for 1.2 fold change in down-regulated genes, while different shades of red
  depict regulation levels for 1.2 fold change in up-regulated genes. The darker the
  shade of green or red, the greater the fold change. D. & H. A schematic of the significant
  genes (Table 4), determined to be key in regulating many functions at older ages,
  illustrating the balance between the tumor promoters (text in yellow) and tumor
  suppressors (text in white and underlined) with the Log2 fold change color coded
  as before. Genes that have no determined effect on tumor progression appear in white
  text.
