caption: 'The original model by Neumann et al. and results of the model reduction.
  A. The original model decomposed into modules according to three steps of the CD95
  signaling pathways: activation of caspase-8, pro-apoptotic pathway resulting in
  caspase-3 activation and anti-apoptotic pathway regulated by NF-κB. The species
  retained during the model reduction are colored; reactions are represented by solid
  lines. B. The modular view of the model. Activation of caspase-8 and p43-FLIP (product
  of cFLIPL cleavage) occurs at the DISC complex and triggers simultaneous processes
  of cell death and survival.'
