caption: Simplified pathway of de novo sphingolipid synthesis. Serine palmitoyltransferase
  (SPT) catalyzes the initial reaction of the de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids.
  Dihydrosphingosine (dhSPH) is generated after an intermediate step regulated by
  3-keto-dihydrosphingosine reductase (KDS). Successively, dhSph can be either phosphorylated,
  with the generation of dhSphingosine-1-phosphate (dhS1P) by sphingosine kinase 1
  and 2 (SPHK1/2), or acetylated by Ceramide Synthase (CerS) and desaturated by ceramide
  desaturase (DES) to form Ceramide (Cer). Ceramide may be also generated by both
  hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and by the salvage pathway.
