caption: The NOX system is central to host defense. When induced through various triggering
  elements (top-left block), NOX family members become activated, producing ROS (central
  block). The block arrows represent the main signal pathway. While ROS directly kills
  microorganisms, additional downstream cellular factors work in an orchestrated manner
  to mount pressure against the invading pathogens or the cells harboring these microbes
  (right block). However, when non-pathogenic inducers, such as cigarette smoke or
  alcohol, induce the NOX system, ROS exerts damaging effects on the host, causing
  pathogenesis. The signaling mechanisms illustrated in this figure include the induction
  of TLR4-mediated signaling through cigarette smoke and LPS, leading to the activation
  of NOX4. TLR5 recognizes flagellin and activates NOX1 and Duox2. Virus-like HCV
  also activates NOX4, leading to ROS production. TLR5 and NOD2, when activated through
  flagellin or peptidoglycan, respectively, activate Duox2, leading to NLRP3 binding
  and activation. Furthermore, the NLRP3-mediated induction of caspase-1 activity
  leads to the maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, promoting the influx and activation
  of lymphocytes. ROS, produced through NOX, activates NF-κB through various intermediates,
  including PKC, MEKK and NIK, thereby inducing the upregulation of IL-8, ICAM-1 and
  VCAM-1 and promoting the lymphocyte influx important for host defense/pathogenesis.
