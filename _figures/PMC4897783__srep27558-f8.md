caption: (A) Normoglycemic glucose promotes sustained expression of DKK4 protein.
  DKK4 antagonizes activation of canonical Wnt signaling by facilitating degradation
  of β–catenin in cytosol and thus reducing its transcriptional activation thereby
  causing decrease c-Myc level. Increased DKK4 expression affects progression of cells
  at S-phase of cell cycle and therefore limits proliferation of HCC cells. (B) High
  glucose diminishes DKK4 expression allowing activation of canonical Wnt signaling
  because of inactivation of β–catenin degradation complex, by Wnt3a proteins. Increase
  in β–catenin level enhances its transcriptional activity and promotes c-Myc expression
  which causes uncontrolled proliferation of HCC cells.
