caption: Schematic depicting the hormonal regulation of the mammalian Hippo signaling
  pathway. In response to hormonal stimuli including S1P, LPA, Estrogen, Epinephrine
  and Glucagon, the activity of YAP and TAZ can be enhanced via the GPCR G-proteins
  Gαq/11, Gα12/13, or Gαi/o, or inhibited via Gαs signaling axis. When active, these
  stimuli influence YAP and TAZ phosphorylation/localization through modulation of
  F-actin/RHOA/RAC1. YAP can also be phosphorylated and sequestered by the AMOT family
  of proteins. In addition to regulation by GPCR signaling, YAP, and TAZ activity
  is altered by secreted proteins such as WNT and by glucocorticoids.
