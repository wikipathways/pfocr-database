caption: 'The Integrated Stress Response (ISR). The PERK pathway of the UPR is also
  a member of the ISR. Various stressors, including ER stress, amino acid deficiency,
  ultraviolet rays, heat, ROSs, and heme deficiency, can activate one or more of the
  four eIF2α kinases: PERK, HRI, GCN2, and PKR. The ISR hinges on eIF2α, which is
  phosphorylated by the four kinases. Phosphorylated eIF2α binds eIF2β, a key component
  of an essential complex involved in initiating protein translation, to inhibit global
  protein synthesis, except ATF4 and ATF4-regulated genes like CHOP. ATF4 positively
  regulates expression of cytoprotective genes, as well as upregulating CHOP, which
  can induce apoptosis under chronic ER stress conditions. Independent of the ISR,
  ER stress-induced activation of the PERK pathway can also enhance the anti-oxidant
  response by upregulating genes via the direct phosphorylation of nuclear factor
  erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf)2.'
