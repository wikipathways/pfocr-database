caption: Scheme of green light-induced alcohol production in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (PCC
  6803). a The biosynthetic pathway to produce isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol (3MB)
  from captured CO2 via photosynthesis in PCC 6803. The CcaS/CcaR two-component system,
  which was derived from PCC6803, was applied to regulate the gene expression levels
  of keto-acid decarboxylase (kdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adh), which are required
  to produce isobutanol and 3MB via the amino acid biosynthesis pathway. b Scheme
  of regulation of gene expression under the control of the CcaS/CcaR system by red
