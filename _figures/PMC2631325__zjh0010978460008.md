caption: Regulation of OC differentiation and OC-osteoblast coupling. Pathways identified
  by our microarray analyses as potentially modulated by RTV and reversed by pharmacological
  doses of IFN-γ are indicated. Based on additional experimental data, the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway, critical to induction of osteoblast differentiation and activity, is postulated
  to also have a direct inhibitory role in OC differentiation. (Diagram format derived
  from References  and ).
