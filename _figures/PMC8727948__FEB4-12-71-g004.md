caption: Schematic diagram of the function of AAV2‐shmTOR. Inhibition of mTOR expression
  by AAV2‐shmTOR suppresses the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells stimulated
  by VEGF. mTOR is a major activator in endothelial cells under VEGF stimulation,
  and inhibition of mTOR by AAV2‐shmTOR blocked the activation of downstream signaling
  molecules such as S6 and PKCα. Consequently, inhibition of the mTOR pathway affected
  the cell proliferation and remodeling of the tight junction between endothelial
  cells.
