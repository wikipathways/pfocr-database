caption: 'Function of GluRs: Glutamate discharged from presynaptic neurons spread
  across the cleft of the synapse (by diffusion) to bind to receptors situated on
  the postsynaptic cell membrane. Group I mGluRs are affixed to PLC, whereas groups
  II and III receptors trigger the inhibitory cAMP pathway. IGluRs have permeability
  largely for Na+ and Ca2+. Discharged glutamate is predominantly removed by specific
  excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) found on neighboring astrocytes. Accumulated
  glutamate inside the astrocytes is transformed to glutamine and transported to the
  presynaptic cell, which forms glutamate through mitochondrial glutaminase to be
  re-released. Astrocytes also express AMPA and kainate IGluRs, including mGluRs,
  bestowing evidence for bidirectional signaling of glutamate involving neurons and
  astrocytes. AC, adenylyl cyclase; DAG, diacylglycerol; Gln, glutamine; Glu, glutamate;
  Ins (1,4,5)P3, inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate.'
