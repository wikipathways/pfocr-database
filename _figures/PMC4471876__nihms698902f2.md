caption: Ageing is accompanied by changes in cellular processes, impairments in the
  integration of cellular activities, and deficits in physiological functions. a |
  At the cellular level, important hallmarks of ageing in the CNS are impairments
  in mitochondrial functions, disruption of proteostasis and autophagy, and alterations
  in signalling pathways involved in nutrient sensing, such as the mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) act as intracellular signalling
  molecules that modulate mitochondrial activity through cannabinoid type 1 (CB1)
  receptors located either in the plasma membrane or on lysosomes (l-CB1) and possibly
  mitochondria (m-CB1). In particular, activation of m-CB1 seems to reduce mitochondrial
  respiration, and to decrease mitochondrial cyclic AMP levels and protein kinase
  A (PKA) activity. CB1 receptors located on lysosomes enhance the intracellular release
  of Ca2+, increase the permeability of lysosomes and the release of cathepsin D.
  CB1 receptors on the cell surface also stimulate mTOR signalling, through an Akt-dependent
  mechanism, resulting in an enhanced activity of phosphoprotein 70 ribosomal protein
  S6 kinase (p70S6K). The mechanism by which cannabinoids stimulate autophagy is not
  entirely clear (indicated by a question mark), and is probably independent of mTOR.
  b | At the tissue level, disruption of intercellular communication is another hallmark
  of ageing. Endocannabinoids are best known as signalling molecules for short-range
  cell–cell communication. At synapses they provide a retrograde feedback system,
  in which activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors reduces neurotransmitter release
  probability. Endocannabinoids also modulate the activity of astrocytes and microglia.
  These cells may also be a source for brain endocannabinoids (eCBs). Increased numbers
  of activated microglia and astrocytes are typically found in the ageing brain and
  result in an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs). This process
  leads to a change towards a more pro-inflammatory milieu in the brain. c | At the
  organism level, eCBs modulate the activity of several systems that are important
  in ageing, such as metabolic processes or hypothalamic activity. Cannabinoids are
  generally protective against age-related pathologies, including neuroinflammation
  and neurodegeneration. They also protect against some age-related pathologies outside
  the CNS, such as osteoporosis. Akt, serine/threonine Akt; DAG, diacylglycerol; DAGLs,
