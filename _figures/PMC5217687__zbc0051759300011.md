caption: Multiple regulatory pathways are utilized by the cell to control activation
  of the STING signaling pathway. A, our data support a model in which the presence
  of AMPK signaling is required for optimal activation of STING-dependent signaling.
  Conditions that interfere with AMPK signaling, including chelation of intracellular
  calcium (1), pharmacologic inhibition of AMPK signaling (2), or genetic ablation
  of AMPK signaling (3) inhibit STING-dependent signaling. As ULK1−/− and ULK1−/−ULK2−/−
  MEFs exhibit no defect in response to STING agonists, we conclude that the regulatory
  role of AMPK on STING is independent of ULK1 and that the ULK1 inhibitor SBI-0206965
  has off-target effects leading to signal impairment. B, the exact role of AMPK in
  the regulation of STING is unknown at present. AMPK might directly promote STING
  signaling by substrate level phosphorylation (1). Alternatively, it might act indirectly
  by activating a positive regulator (PR) or inhibiting a negative regulator (NR)
  of STING-dependent signaling (2). An alternate possibility is that the STING signaling
  pathway operates efficiently in a narrow metabolic window and is indirectly inhibited
  in the absence of the catabolic pathways promoted by AMPK (3). Future studies will
  delineate which of these mechanisms is operative.
