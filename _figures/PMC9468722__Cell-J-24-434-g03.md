caption: Retinoic acid signaling pathway in the regulation of germ-cell related gene
  expression. A. On the cell surface, retinol (Rol) by binding to retinol binding
  protein enters the target stem cell and is converted to all-trans retinoic acid
  (RA) following the lecithin:retinol acyl transferase (LRAT), retinol dehydrogenase
  10 (RDH10) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a2 (ALDH1A2) reactions. Then, RA is transferred
  to the nucleus by binding to cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 (CRABP2).
  Once in the nucleus, RA is initially bound to retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and
  the RA-RARs complex by binding to retinoid X receptors (RXRs) will interact with
  RA primary response genes (). B. RA primary response genes have some enhancers known
  as RA response element (RARE) which RARs/RXRs complex binds to, leading to RNApol
  II activation and increased PGCsrelated genes, including Stella, Fragilis, and Stra8,
  expression (). C. PcG proteins form a gene-silencing complex for gene expression
  regulation. RA causes the dissociation of these proteins and activates the differentiationrelated
  genes expression (, ).
