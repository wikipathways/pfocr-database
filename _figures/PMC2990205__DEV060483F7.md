caption: Hippo signaling restrains Yki-accelerated cell division in response to injury.
  Schematic shows the transition of ISCs between normal homeostasis, which occurs
  in the absence of injury, and acute regeneration following injury. Upon damage,
  the Hippo pathway ligand, Ds, no longer activates Hippo signaling in ISCs, allowing
  Yki to activate downstream targets. One of these targets is the Upd/Os cytokine,
  which stimulates proliferation of ISCs/Ebs through the JAK/STAT pathway. When ee
  and EC progeny are regenerated, Hippo signaling acts as a brake, cytokine production
  slows and the system returns to the homeostatic state.
