caption: The DNA damage response of human cells with differing p53 status discussed
  in this article. Ionizing radiation triggers growth arrest through stress-induced
  premature senescence (SIPS) in p53 wild-type (WT) cells, and the development of
  giant cells (containing multiple nuclei or a single enlarged nucleus) within cultures
  of cancer cells lacking wild-type p53 function. In addition, a proportion of p53
  WT cells “escapes” from SIPS and gives rise to giant cells. While some giant cells
  may die through apoptosis, others may undergo complex genome-reduction processes
  (e.g., depolyploidization and neosis), ultimately giving rise to rapidly-proliferating
  progeny. The mitotic kinase Aurora B plays an important role in regulating the survival
  of giant cells. ATM may prevent the propagation of giant cells and their descendants
  by activating protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and inhibiting Aurora B kinase activity
  [,]. Caspase 3 either functions as the executioner caspase in the apoptotic pathway
  or, paradoxically, promotes cell survival by mediating prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secretion.
  DSB, double-strand break; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated.
