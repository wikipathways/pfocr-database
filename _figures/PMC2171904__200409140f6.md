caption: A model for the ROP GTPase control of actin dynamics and tip growth. The
  model predicts that ROP1 is activated at the tip and activates RIC4 and RIC3, which
  promote the assembly of tip F-actin and lead to the formation of tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt
  gradients, respectively. The two pathways check and balance to control actin dynamics
  and tip growth. The RIC4-dependent tip F-actin may target vesicles to the site of
  exocytosis as well as is required for the proper regulation of the RIC3 pathway.
  The RIC3-mediated Ca2+ promotes the disassembly of the tip F-actin, likely releasing
  F-actin blockage of vesicle fusion, and may also directly activate vesicle fusion.
  The dual and antagonistic roles of Rho signaling explain a dilemma for the regulation
  of exocytosis by Rho GTPase–dependent cortical F-actin; i.e., cortical F-actin is
  both required for and inhibits exocytosis. The check and balance of the two ROP1
  downstream pathways also explain how the extremely polarized growth is coupled with
  growth oscillation in pollen tubes. Solid arrows indicate steps supported by experimental
  data described in this paper or elsewhere (), whereas dotted arrows indicate more
  speculative steps. In addition to profilin, other potential Ca2+ sensors such as
  gelsolin, which might also be involved in RIC3-mediated actin disassembly, are not
  indicated in the model.
