caption: The most significant molecular network by IPA pathway enrichment analysis
  in SPARC overexpressed cells. Red symbol represents miRNAs targets and clear symbol
  is associated with protein targets The IPA proprietary database manually curates
  information about gene-phenotype associations, molecular interactions, regulatory
  events, and chemical knowledge to provide a global molecular network. Related network
  was algorithmically constructed based on connectivity, as enabled through IPA. Statistical
  significance of each biological function in each resulting network was calculated
  based on Fisher’s exact test with p < 0.05 considered as significant.
