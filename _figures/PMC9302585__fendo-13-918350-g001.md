caption: The effect of sodium–glucose co-transporters (SGLTs) on the regulation of
  mineral ions in renal tubules. The SGLT-1/SGLT-2 co-transporters are mainly expressed
  in proximal renal tubules, regulating the reabsorption of sodium and glucose. SGLT-2
  reabsorbs sodium and glucose from the lumen side of proximal tubules and acts synergistically
  with glucose transporters (GLUTs) to transport glucose into the blood. In addition,
  the Na–Pi IIa/c co-transporters are expressed in the lumen side, which synergistically
  regulate the transport of sodium and phosphorus. Calcium and magnesium pass through
  intercellular channels. In proximal tubules, the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)
  is located on the lumen side, which senses the concentration of extracellular calcium
  and synergy with the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR), which is stimulated by
  the parathyroid hormone (PTH), to regulate the transporter function and maintain
  the hemostasis of calcium/phosphate. Sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors
  (SGLT-2is) increase the excretion of urinary sodium and glucose. The increased sodium
  delivery in distal convoluted tubules stimulates dense plaques, triggers tubulo-glomerular
  feedback, and shrinks the afferent glomerular arteriole. In distal convoluted tubules,
  the insulin receptor is expressed in the blood side. Magnesium reabsorption passes
  via transient receptor potential melastatin type 6 (TRPM6), and the channel activity
  is suppressed by insulin binding to the insulin receptor via the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway. In this way, SGLT-1 and SGLT-2 play an important role in regulating mineral
  metabolism.
