caption: Simplified scheme of sphingolipid biosynthesis. Selected enzymes participating
  in the sphingolipid metabolism are shown in boxes, and lipids analyzed in this study
  are indicated in black bold letters. De novo sphingolipid synthesis is initiated
  by the condensation of fatty acyl-CoA and l-serine. Palmitoyl-CoA (16:0) is the
  favored substrate for this reaction, but other fatty acyl-CoAs, primarily myristoyl-CoA
  (14:0) and stearoyl-CoA (18:0), may also be used, as well as other amino acids.
  From the point of ceramide, the synthesis pathways branch out creating a wealth
  of complex sphingolipids, differing in their lipid backbones and head groups. The
  only exit for sphingolipids from this tree is by the activity of S1P lyase on sphingosine-1-phosphate,
  producing ethanolamine phosphate and fatty aldehydes. The fatty aldehydes can be
  recycled through a series of enzymatic steps (not shown) to reenter the de novo
  pathway or be used in other metabolic processes.
