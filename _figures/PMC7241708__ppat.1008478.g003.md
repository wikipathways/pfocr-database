caption: In Candida species, pH adaptation is mediated by the Rim pathway. Under acidic
  pH, the exposure of both chitin and β-glucan is enhanced and facilitates their recognition
  by the host innate immune system. Chitin exposure is promoted by the repression
  of both Rim101 and Bcr1, resulting in reduced expression of CHT2. β-glucan exposure
  is regulated by a noncanonical signaling pathway. Under alkaline pH, Rim8 is hyperphosphorylated,
  a signal that induces the endocytosis of the Rim complex and the recruitment of
  Rim13. The C-terminal proteolysis of Rim101 by Rim13 activates it and promotes the
  expression of target genes, including CHT2.
