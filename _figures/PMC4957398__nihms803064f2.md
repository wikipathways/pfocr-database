caption: Signaling of pexophagy by ROS, hypoxia and inhibition of PEX5 export from
  peroxisomes. Pexophagy depends on (a) a peroxisomal target that tags the organelle
  for turnover (e.g. PEX5); (b) activation of the core autophagy machinery and (c)
  ubiquitin-binding pexophagy adapters, such as NBR1 and p62, . All these components
  were studied in the ROS signaling pathway, but the role of NBR1 was not investigated.
  It is likely, but not definitive, that ATM is activated by ROS at peroxisomes. The
  pexophagy pathway studied by Nordgren et al., which identifies PEX5 as the peroxisomal
  target, appears to be independent of the known pexophagy adapters, p62 and NBR1,
  and leaves unclear how the core autophagy machinery is activated, although this
  machinery is involved. In hypoxia-induced pexophagy, neither the peroxisomal receptor,
  nor how the core autophagy machinery is activated, was studied, although this machinery
  is necessary. Both NBR1 and p62 are activated and relocate to the peroxisomes during
  hypoxia-induced pexophagy. Questionmarks denote open questions and undetermined
  points.
