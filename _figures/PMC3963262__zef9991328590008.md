caption: Spatially defined regulation of myocardial β1- and β2-AR/cAMP signaling.
  cAMP and cGMP are intracellular second messengers involved in the regulation of
  myocardial contractility and are under tight control by cyclic nucleotide degrading
  enzymes PDEs. A, In caveolae of myocytes, β1- and β2-adrenergic signaling mediates
  the positive inotropic effects of catecholamine via cAMP generation and PKA activation.
  Under basal conditions, a complex of PDE4D8 and the β1-AR is likely responsible
  for regulation of local cAMP concentrations and PKA activity, and PDE4D8 dissociates
  from the complex after ligand binding and activation of β1-AR. PDE4D5 is not associated
  with β2-AR, but after ligand binding, a preformed complex of β-arrestin and PDE4D5
  is recruited to the β2-AR-signaling complex (, ). B, cAMP generated via activation
  of β1/β2 receptors can be counteracted by β3-AR signaling which generates NO, leading
  to sGC activation, synthesis of cGMP, and activation of PDE2. cGMP allosterically
  activates PDE2 via its binding to regulatory PDE2 GAF-B domains and increases cAMP
  hydrolysis. This action defines a key role for compartmentalized PDE2 in the β3-AR-activated
  feedback loop. cGMP generated by β3-AR/NO/cGMP pathway can reduce cAMP signals and
  β-adrenergic-induced cardiac inotropy via increased cAMP hydrolysis caused by cGMP-activated
  PDE2. GPCRs other than β-AR are localized outside of such a signaling loop and activate
  a separate pool of AC. AC, adenylate cyclase; eNOS, endothelial NOS; P, phosphorylation;
  sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase.
