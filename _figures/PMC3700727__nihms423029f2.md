caption: The AHR is represented in the cytosol of both DCs and T cells. In the top
  part of the figure, which represents the endogenous pathway, ligands including TCDD,
  SU5416, ITE, VAV347, and kynurenine bind to the AHR on DCs, leading to IDO generation.
  IFN-γ can generate IDO irrespective of the AHR. This leads to the metabolism of
  tryptophan to kynurenine, which itself is a ligand for the AHR that binds to the
  receptor on T cells to generate Regulatory T cells. The bottom part of the figure
  represents the exogenous pathway, where ligands like FICZ or polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons bind directly to the AHR on T cells to favor Th17 differentiation under
  the right conditions. This AHR binding also leads to the transcription of metabolizing
  enzymes, most notably the cytochrome P450 enzymes. The two pathways potentially
  function together in a feedback loop, where the AHR metabolizes compounds that then
  themselves become ligands that can shift the T cell differentiation response when
  the inflammation abates. Modified and reprinted from () with permission from the
