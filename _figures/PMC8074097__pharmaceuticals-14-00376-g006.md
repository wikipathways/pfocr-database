caption: Molecular signaling activated by seizures leading to cell death by apoptosis.
  Two pathways, extrinsic and intrinsic, may trigger apoptosis. TNF (tumor necrosis
  factor) activates cell-surface death receptors in the extrinsic pathway, leading
  to an intracellular death-inducing signaling complex containing Fas-associated death
  domain and caspase-8 or -10. A caspase cascade is initiated by the activation of
  “effector” caspases, such as caspase-3, which cleave essential intracellular structural
  and survival proteins and lead to apoptosis. The intrinsic pathway is triggered
  by increased intracellular calcium, free radicals, and dimerization interactions
  of Bcl-2 family proteins that regulate mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial
  alteration leads to cytochrome c release, which activates the apoptosome formed
  by Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor 1) and caspase-9, followed by downstream
  executioner caspases. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular calcium can
  alternatively induce lysosomal disruption, releasing cathepsins. Cathepsins may
  directly trigger cytochrome c release, leading to caspases activation. Caspase-1
  is activated by the inflammasome and converts pro-IL-1B to mature IL-1B. These pathways
  can be modulated by survival proteins AKT, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, and HSP-70. The
  A1Rs (adenosine A1 receptors) are effective modulators of excitatory transmission
  where they exert combined pre-, post-, and non-synaptic effects to decrease glutamate
  excitability. In this manner, the activation of presynaptic A1R by R-PIA reduces
  the influx of calcium through voltage-sensitive calcium channels and consequently
  inhibits the release of glutamate; at the post-synaptic level, it inhibits voltage-sensitive
  calcium channels and the NMDA receptor function; and finally, at the neuronal non-synaptic
  level, it hyperpolarizes neurons by modulating potassium channel conductance. Finally,
  R-PIA, by activating A1R, reduces cathepsin D release and increases the levels of
  survival proteins AKT and HSP70 as well as the anti-apoptotic response.
