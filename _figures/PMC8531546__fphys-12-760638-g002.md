caption: Sphingolipid metabolism in lung pathologies. Sphingolipid metabolism promotes
  pulmonary fibrosis via TGF- and IL-13 signaling. Sphingolipid metabolism induces
  phospholipase C to enhance the progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension. In
  the context of lung cancer, sphingolipid metabolism has been shown to impact angiogenesis
  via the Rac1 pathway. Additionally, sphingolipid metabolism is involved in the inflammatory
  phenotype associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
