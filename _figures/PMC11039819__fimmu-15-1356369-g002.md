caption: The cGAS-STING pathway is directly connected to autophagy. cGAS-STING signaling
  is an innate immune pathway, responsible for the production of type I IFNs. Extracellular
  stressors such as genotoxic stress or viral infection as well as genomic instability
  can lead to the appearance of dsDNA in the cytosol. cGAS is activated upon binding
  dsDNA, which leads to the production of the secondary messenger cGAMP. cGAMP then
  activates STING, located at the ER, inducing its oligomerization and translocation
  to the Golgi via the ERGIC. Alternatively, cGAMP can also trigger the activation
  of STING in neighbouring cells via intercellular transport mediated by gap junctions.
  At the Golgi, STING induces the phosphorylation of TBK1 and ultimately IRF3 leading
  to its translocation to the nucleus where phosphorylated IRF3 drives the transcription
  of type I IFNs. Each distinct step of the cGAS-STING pathway is interconnected with
  autophagy. For example, STING, upon activation, leads to the formation of autophagosomes
  at the ERGIC in a WIPI2-dependent manner. This acts as a negative feedback loop
  by degrading dsDNA and other members of the pathway, such as cGAS or IRF3. Additionally,
  microautophagy is responsible for the final termination of STING signaling in an
  ESCRT-dependent manner.
