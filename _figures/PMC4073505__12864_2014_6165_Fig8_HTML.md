caption: A newly identified miRNA-target regulatory pathway in the inner ear. A suggested
  pathway for miR-6715-3p and Arhgap12, whereby miR-6715-3p down-regulates expression
  of Arhgap12, which in turn blocks the hydrolysis of Rac1 (Ras-Related C3 Botulinum
  Toxin Substrate 1) GTPase. This may result in increased cell adhesion, actin reorganization
  and inner ear morphogenesis.
