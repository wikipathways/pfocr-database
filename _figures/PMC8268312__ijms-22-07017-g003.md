caption: Strategies employed by SARS-CoV-2 to evade innate immune response. SARS-CoV-2
  utilizes a plethora of structural and nonstructural proteins (nsp) to interfere
  with IFN signaling. In particular, the activation of the cytosolic RNA-sensing pathway
  is antagonized at multiple levels. SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, open reading frame (ORF)9b,
  and membrane (M) proteins target and associate with the cytosolic receptor MDA5
  and with the adapter protein MAVS. The binding of nsp6 and nsp13 to the TANK binding
  kinase TBK1 causes the inhibition of IRF-3 phosphorylation and the consequent reduction
  of type I IFN release. TBK1 activity can also be affected by the ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation induced by SARS-CoV-2 M protein. Moreover, the papain-like protease
  (PLpro) impairs type I IFN response through the proteolytic cleavage of the ubiquitin-like
  molecule IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15). The nuclear translocation of the IRF-3
  transcription factor and the consequent activation of type I IFN pathway can be
  also prevented by ORF3b, ORF6, ORF8, and N proteins. SARS-CoV-2 nsp6, nsp13, ORF3a,
  and ORF7b proteins interfere with the phosphorylation/activation of both signal
  transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT2. The nuclear translocation
  of STAT1 may be inhibited by ORF6, while the ISRE promoting activity is hampered
  by ORF6, ORF8, and nsp1 proteins.
