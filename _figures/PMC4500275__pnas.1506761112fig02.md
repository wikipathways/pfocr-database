caption: 'Proposed biosynthetic pathway for LNM (1) featuring (i) the LnmQPIJ hybrid
  NRPS-AT–less type I PKS with the discrete LnmG AT loading the malonyl CoA extender
  units to all six PKS modules, (ii) the LnmKLMF enzymes catalyzing the β-alkyl branch
  at C3, and (iii) LNM E1 (2) as a key intermediate for 1 biosynthesis, setting the
  stage to investigate the mechanism of sulfur incorporation and the tailoring steps
  that convert 2 to 1, requiring minimally hydroxylations at C-8 and C-4′, oxidation
  at S-1′, S-insertion at 2′, and 1,3-dioxo-1,2-dithiolane ring formation. Color coding
  indicates the moieties installed by NRPS (blue), PKS (red), β-alkyl branch (green),
  and other tailoring enzymes (black). SAM, S-adenosylmethionine. The green oval denotes
  an AT docking domain. Domain abbreviations are: A, adenylation; AT, acyltransferase;
  Cy, cyclization; DH, dehydratase; KR, ketoreductase; KS, ketosynthase; MT, methyltransferase,
  Ox, oxidation; PCP, peptidyl carrier protein; TE, thioesterase; ?, domain of unknown
  function.'
