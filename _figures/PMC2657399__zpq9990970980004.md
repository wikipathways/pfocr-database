caption: Selected examples of structural analysis of modified polysaccharides by mass
  spectrometry. Major peaks in the spectra correspond to different fragments of repeating
  unit structures. The information was obtained by selecting the ion at m/z 204.2,
  which corresponds to the HexNAc oxonium ion, as a precursor to perform precursor
  ion scan experiments. The peaks corresponding to the fragments containing fucose
  or fucose analogs are circled in red.
