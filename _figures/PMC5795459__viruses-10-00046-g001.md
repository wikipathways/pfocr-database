caption: Canonical type I and III IFN signaling. Upon interaction of type I and type
  III IFNs with their receptors, TYK2 and JAK1 phosphorylation occurs, recruiting
  STAT1 and STAT2 for phosphorylation. STAT1 and STAT2 dimerize and associate with
  IRF9 to form the ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) complex, which traffics to the nucleus (dashed
  arrow) and binds IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) to drive transcription
  of ISGs (bold arrow). Both IFNs also activate the MAPK pathway (not shown). While
  shown in equivalent quantities here for simplicity, differential type I and type
  III IFN receptor densities, based on cell type, may influence subsequent host responses.
