caption: Oxidative stress signaling in phytopathogenic fungi.Extracellular ROS increase [Ca2+]cyt
  signatures, which act as secondary messengers in signaling cascades. Ca2+ binds
  to calmodulin, followed by calcineurin activation via the Ca2+-calmodulin-calcineurin
  pathway. Calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation triggers nuclear localization of
  the Crz1 transcription factor for transcriptional activation of stress response
  and cell wall integrity genes. In the cytosol, freely diffusing H2O2 is perceived
  by the redox-sensitive thiols of glutathione peroxidases (Gpx), which oxidize cysteine
  thiols of Yap1 in a redox cascade and disrupt the Yap1–Crm1 complex. Oxidized Yap1
  translocates to the nucleus and transcriptionally regulates antioxidant genes. Other
  transcription factors such as AflRsmA, Tps1, and MsnA2/MsnA4 are also involved in
  oxidative stress tolerance; however, their upstream activation mechanisms remain
  unclear. The ATM/Mec1-mediated activation of Cds/Dun1 kinase leads to phosphorylation-triggered
  nuclear localization of SOD1, which prevents DNA damage and regulates catalase gene
  expression. A histidine sensor kinase (Bos1/Sln1) phosphorylates Ypd1, which activates
  Skn7 in a phosphorelay to work with Yap1 against oxidative stress. In parallel,
  Bos1 initiates a MAPK phosphorelay involving MAP2Ks such as VdPbs2 and FvBck1, as
  well as PsMPK7, Sak1, SRM1 (a Hog1 homolog), and Pmk1, which are essential for antioxidation
  and for the regulation of aflatoxin biosynthesis-related transcription factors AtfA/AtfB.
  Coordinated activation of these signaling cascades orchestrates oxidative stress
  defense response in fungi.
