caption: Elevation of intracellular ROS leads to activation of signal transductions
  mediated by p-EKR, p-P38, and subsequent Nrf2 activation. Nrf2 activation results
  in the induction of antioxidant genes, allowing cells to be protected against oxidative
  stress. Lines in black were drawn based on the result of the present study and lines
  in gray were drawn based on previous studies.
