caption: 'A previously developed model of minimal network [] is utilized to elucidate
  some of the robust systems level regulatory mechanisms in apoptosis signaling. This
  signaling network can be thought of as a highly coarse-grained representation of
  the full apoptotic signaling network. The following rate constants were used: 2
  × 10−4 (for the type 1 pathway); 1.0, 10−7 and 10−1 (for the type 2 pathway). X0
  measures the strength of an apoptotic stimulus (varied in ). Initial numbers for
  all other the molecules (X1, X2, X3) were assumed to be 100.'
