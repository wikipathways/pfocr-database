caption: 'Proposed theoretical schematic of active mechanistic processes regulating
  the reciprocal nature between NREM sleep and wake with respect to Aβ burden. During
  wake (orange box), glymphatic Aβ clearance is low, neurometabolic and neuronal spiking
  activity is high, , and oxidative stress is high, fostering higher Aβ burden (red
  box), , , . Aβ, in turn, promotes greater oxidative stress, neuronal hyperexcitability,
  and reduces glymphatic clearance through processes including cerebral amyloid angiopathy
  and, presumably, NREM sleep disturbance, . Thus, a facilitatory process is created
  where Aβ may promote its own accumulation. During NREM sleep (blue box), glymphatic
  Aβ clearance is high, neurometabolic rate is low,, and active cellular processes
  promote cellular restitution that reduces oxidative damage. This balances both Aβ
  accumulation and the negative consequences of Aβ accumulation under conditions of
  healthy sleep. However, under pathological conditions, Aβ burden may actively disrupt
  NREM sleep, . This disruption, alongside reduced Aβ clearance due to cerebral amyloid
  angiopathy, theoretically creates an environment whereby NREM sleep can no longer
  successfully suppress Aβ accumulation. This once again exacerbates the vicious cycle,
  triggering greater Aβ aggregation and accelerating AD pathophysiological progression.
  Abbreviations: Aβ, amyloid-β protein; and NREM SWS, non-rapid-eye-movement slow
  wave sleep.'
