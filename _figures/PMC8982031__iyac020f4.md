caption: Early wing disc patterning. Schematics of wing discs illustrating key early
  steps in patterning. a) Expression of En in the posterior of the wing disc creates
  distinct anterior and posterior compartments. En represses expression of the Hh
  pathway transcription factor Ci. Ci directly and indirectly represses Hh, restricting
  Hh expression to posterior cells. The complementary expression of Ci and Hh limits
  Hh to signaling to anterior cells, where it induces transcription of Dpp. b) The
  wing disc is subdivided into appendage-body wall regions by the differential expression
  of Wg in ventral cells and Vn in dorsal cells, which mutually antagonize each other.
  Vn promotes notum fate by activating expression of Iro-C genes, while Wg promotes
  wing fate by promoting expression of Vg and suppressing expression of Tsh. c) Expression
  of Ap in the dorsal half of the wing disc creates distinct dorsal and ventral compartments.
  Ap regulates activation of Notch (N) along the D窶天 boundary by promoting transcription
  of Fng and Ser in dorsal cells. Notch activation along the D窶天 boundary leads to
  upregulation of Vg, from its boundary enhancer, as well, in the future wing region,
  Wg. d) Schematic cross-section illustrating subdivision of the wing disc into DP
  and PE cell layers. Expression of Vn, Wg, and Lines promotes DP fate and repress
  PE fate and Bowl.
