caption: Soluble amylin and pramlintide are capable of activating the endogenous AMYR
  which is responsible for recruiting adenylate cyclase. Activation of adenylate cyclase
  results in the production of cAMP and the release and activation of PKA. This canonical
  amylin signaling pathway is what is hypothesized to give rise to the beneficial
  effects seen by amylin signaling. However, at higher concentrations amylin forms
  oligomers and eventually aggregate plaques, effectively removing signaling capable
  amylin. Amylin plaques are unable to signal through the endogenous AMYR but amylin
  oligomers are thought to interact with the AMYR and/or the TRPV4 receptor to initially
  depolarize the membrane through the influx of Na+ and Ca2+. This initial depolarization
  allows voltage-gated Ca2+ to reach threshold and results in further Ca2+ influx.
  Uncontrolled Ca2+ influx is severely detrimental and also occurs in β-cells of the
  pancreas and is attributed to late stage β-cell loss in T2D.
