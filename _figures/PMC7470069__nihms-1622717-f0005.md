caption: Mercury-sulfhydryl-dependent effects on apoptosis regulation. Mercury exposure
  may induce both anti- (low dose) and pro-apoptotic (high-dose) signaling. Covalent
  modification of Keap1 through Hg binding to Cys151 (MeHg) or Cys319 (MeHg-SG) results
  in Nrf2 activation and subsequent downstream signaling leading to up-regulation
  of antioxidant enzymes and anti-apoptotic signals. Akt/CREB pathway may be involved
  both in the anti- and pro-apoptotic effects of Hg. PTEN S-mercuration results in
  Akt activation and subsequent Bcl2 up-regulation. In contrast, increasing Hg levels
  bind Cys286 residue in CREB, thus disrupting Akt/CREB/Bcl-2 signaling and induction
  of proapoptotic signaling. NF-κB may also partially mediate the effects of Hg on
  apoptosis through S-mercuration of p50 (p50-Cys62-S-HgCH3) and alteration of its
  antiapoptotic effects. Finally, inhibition of mitochondrial Mn-SOD through Cys196-S-HgCH3
  binding may result in mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysfunction, causing increased
  cytochrome c (CytC) leakage and caspase-mediated apoptosis.
