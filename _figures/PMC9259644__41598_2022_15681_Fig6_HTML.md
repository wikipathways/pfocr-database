caption: Partial reconstruction of microbial metabolic pathways in the tick microbiome.
  Partial reconstruction of methane, nitrogen, arginine and proline, glycine, serine
  and threonine, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate, purine, pyruvate, glycan biosynthesis
  and steroid degradation metabolic pathways is displayed. Only metabolic enzymes
  and pathways with significant differences in relative abundances (p < 0.05) between
  R. helvetica-positive and pathogen-free I. ricinus ticks are represented. KEGG annotation
  were included in this analysis. Continuous lines represent direct reactions catalyzed
  by enzymes. Dashed lines represent reconstruct reactions with shortcuts. Oval boxes
  represent pathway reconstruction based in KEGG. Enzymes with significant abundance
  difference are represented in a green rectangle, if they have a higher abundance,
  and in red, if they have a lower abundance, in R. helvetica-positive compared to
  pathogen-free samples. Pathway with a significant difference of abundance between
  pathogen-free and R. helvetica-positive samples are represented in brackets, in
  green or in red if the abundance is higher or lower with R. helvetica presence.
