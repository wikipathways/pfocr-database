caption: Epac1 signalosome in cardiac stress conditions. (A) Ischemia. In the context
  of cardiac ischemia, mitochondrial Epac1 is activated by the soluble adenylyl cyclases
  (sAC) and decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification through isocitrate
  dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) inhibition. In addition, Epac1 facilitates Ca2+ exchange
  from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the mitochondrion by enhancing the formation
  of a Ca2+-handling macromolecular complex composed of voltage-dependent anion channel
  1 (VDAC1), the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75), and the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) receptor 1 (IP3R1) between the ER and the mitochondrion interface. Epac1-induced
  Ca2+ overload and ROS accumulation promotes mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore (mPTP) opening and cardiomyocyte death. (B) Adrenergic stress. Under chronic
  β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, the β-arrestin/Epac1 complex is recruited
  at the plasma membrane and activates a Rap2/phospholipase C (PLC)ε pathway to induce
  1,4,5-trisphosphate production. This signalling pathway converges to the nucleus
  to promote nuclear Ca2+ load, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)
  activation, histone deacetylase type 4 (HDAC4) nuclear export and eventually activation
  of the prohypertrophic transcription factor, myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). In
  addition, Epac1 induces G-protein receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) nuclear import and histone
  deacetylase type 5 (HDAC5) nuclear export to promote MEF2 activity. Yet, Epac1 prohypertrophic
  signalling includes the phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) and nuclear factor of activated
  T cells (NFAT). cAMP synthesized at the Golgi by intracellular β-AR may also stimulate
  the prohypertrophic Epac1/PLCε/A-kinase anchoring protein (mAKAP) signalling at
  the nuclear membrane of cardiomyocytes. (C) Arrhythmia. Epac1 activation contributes
  to cardiac rhythm disorders by increasing the expression level of pro-arrhythmic
  channels (transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 3/4 and potassium voltage-gated
  channel (KCN)). Epac1 also promotes spontaneous diastolic Ca2+ leak via CaMKII-dependent
  ryanodine receptors (RyR) hyperphosphorylation.
