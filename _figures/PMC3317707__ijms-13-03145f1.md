caption: 'Overview of GSH biosynthesis and its involvement in chelation and redox
  control. Glutathione is made of three amino acids: γ-glutamate (Glu), cysteine (Cys)
  and glycine (Gly) by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GSH1) and GSH synthetase (GSH2)
  and depends on sulfur (S) availability. Multiple GSH molecules are polymerized by
  phytochelatin synthase (PCS) to form phytochelatins (PCs). Several antioxidative
  defense pathways are interconnected with GSH in order to remove excess hydrogen
  peroxide (H2O2). The first defense pathway represents direct non-enzymatic GSH oxidation.
  Secondly, the ascorbate(AsA)-GSH cycle is displayed in which AsA and GSH are successively
  oxidized and reduced to allow AsA peroxidase (APx) to neutralize H2O2. Thirdly,
  the two major thiol-redox enzymes glutaredoxin (GRx) and thioredoxin (TRx) are presented
  that complement the GSH system in redox signaling ether by recycling peroxiredoxin
  (PRx) that neutralizes H2O2 or through redox control of protein thiols. In order
  to investigate the role of GSH in metal stressed plants, inhibitors of GSH synthesis
  [i.e., buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)] or deficient mutants are used. Abbreviations:
  dehydroascorbate (DHA), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), ferredoxin (Fd), ferredoxin-dependent
  thioredoxin reductase (FTR), γ-glutamylcysteine (γ-EC), NADPH-dependent thioredoxin
  reductase (NTR).'
