caption: Canonical (left) and noncanonical (right) WNT signaling pathways. In the
  absence of WNT signaling, the effector of canonical WNT signaling, β-catenin is
  found complexed in the cytoplasm with a destruction complex containing Axin and
  GSK3β. GSK3β phosphorylates β-catenin, which results in its targeting to and degradation
  by the proteasome. The binding of canonical WNT ligands to Frizzled (Fz) and LRP5/6
  receptors results in the phosphorylation of LRP5/6 through the action of Dishevelled
  (Dsh). Phosphorylated LRP5/6 recruits Axin away from the destruction complex, liberating
  β-catenin that accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus, where
  it interacts with transcriptional regulators of the TCF/LEF family to alter gene
  expression. AKT and PKC downstream from RTK signaling may inhibit the activity of
  the β-catenin destruction complex to promote β-catenin signaling. Noncanonical WNT/Ca2+signaling
  is initiated by the activation of PLC, probably through trimeric G-proteins such
  as Gbg. The release of Ca2+ results in the activation of NFAT (nuclear factor associated
  with T cells) transcription factors through calcineurin (Cn). Other downstream transcription
  factors (TFs) are activated by PKC and CaMKII. A Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway
  involves Diego (Dgo), Smurf, and Par6, which through cross-inhibitory interactions
  with Van Gogh-like (Vangl)-Prickle (Pk) complexes regulate planar cell polarity.
