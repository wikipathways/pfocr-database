caption: Allosteric regulation underlies the complex binding−function relationship
  in cellular networks. The figure highlights the inadequacy of current cellular diagrams
  that depict series of binding events. As an example. we depict the estrogen receptor,
  for which there are experimental data. Estrogen receptors (Era and ERb) can be selectively
  activated by ligand binding, with allosteric control of ligand selectivity and function
  (). A) Schematic “textbook” network diagram of the estrogen receptor (ER) signaling
  pathways. ER activation is controlled by extracellular signals, hormone and cofactor
  binding events (). Extracellular signals lead to phosphorylation of the ER monomer.
  Examples of the extracellular signals are (i) dopamine and cAMP binding to GPCR
  can activate PKA; (ii) growth factors (GFs) activate their receptors with subsequent
  activation of the RAS-RAF-ERK pathway; and (iii) nongenomic action of ER in the
  membrane activates the PI3K-Akt pathway. Both antagonist and agonist ligands can
  prompt ER dimerization with different allosteric consequences for the helix H12
  position (see , panel B). The shift in the H12 position triggered by antagonist
  ligands blocks subsequent cofactor binding, while agonist ligands allostericaly
  change the ER conformations to allow cofactor recruitment. Cofactors () like the
  nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) and the repressor of the estrogen receptor
  activity (REA) lead to repression of ER response elements (ERE). Examples of direct
  activators are the thyroid hormone receptor (TRAP), steroid receptor activator (SRA),
  and steroid receptor co-activators (SRCs). The secondary co-activators (like CoCoA
  and PRMT) also bind ERS indirectly through association with SRCs. Thus, the network
  diagram provides simple binding events but misses the allosteric regulation of binding
  and function (), which are highlighted in panels B and C. B) Affinities between
  the central node (here the human ERa) and its binding partners (agonists, connected
  via the edges), where line thickness indicates the binding strength () thus specifying
  its rank. For example, the 17b-dihydroequilenin (17b-DHEquilenin) ranks third, and
  Equilenin ranks tenth in binding strength. C) The rank of human ERa functional activity
  (), where line thickness indicates the strength of the functional activity. Unlike
  the binding strength, 17b-DHEquilenin only ranks eighth and Equilenin ranks third
  in binding strength for ERa. For ERb, the Equilenin ranks last in binding strength
  but is the most active for ERb (). Comparison of the widths of corresponding edges
  between panels B and C illustrates that the extent of the affinity does not necessarily
  correspond to the degree of function. Thus the allosteric control of estrogen receptors
  strongly supports the notion that allostery should be considered when trying to
  understand how binding phenomena determine the functional outcome.
