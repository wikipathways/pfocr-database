caption: The scheme here depicts the microenvironmental roles of VSMCs under cyclic
  stretch in EPC differentiation and angiogenesis during vascular repair. Cyclic stretch
  promotes the secretion of CTGF from VSMCs, which subsequently activates the FZD8/β-catenin
  signaling pathway in EPCs, and increased β-catenin nuclear translocation eventually
  induces the differentiation and angiogenic abilities of EPCs.
