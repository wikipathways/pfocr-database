caption: 'NP small EV protein cargo and membrane constituents are involved in key
  metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, Krebs cycle and PPP.
  They are crucial for energy production and to maintain the cellular redox balance.
  NP small EVs with the aid of the 20S proteasome, ensure protein quality control
  and reduced inflammation in a recipient cell. NP small EVs modulate signaling through
  EPH receptors, impacting cellular communication and tissue organization. Additionally,
  NP small EV interact with the complement system, influencing the classical, alternative,
  and lectin pathways involved in immune responses and inflammation. The PI3K/AKT/RAS
  signaling pathway is axis is impacted by the NP small EV proteome, which could promote
  ECM synthesis, cell growth and proliferation. Together, these processes underscore
  the essential role of the NP small EV proteome in sustaining NP cell function and
  NP niche homeostasis. ECM: Extracellular matrix; EPH: Ephrin receptor, ER: endoplasmic
