caption: Schematic diagram for MEK1-dependent and independent ERK activation. A. In
  the presence of MEK1and MEK2, TLR4 engagement activates RTKs as well as RAS GTPase.
  This leads to activation of the RAF pathway upstream to MEK1/2, utilizing predominantly
  MEK1 to subsequently phosphorylate ERK1/2. B. In the absence of MEK1, ERK activation
  requires two signals. TLR4 (LPS) and RAR (RA) engagement may lead to co-activation
  (stronger signal) of the classical pathway through RTKs, RAS GTPase-RAF-MEK2 to
  activate ERK1/2. Alternatively, ERK can be activated directly by PKCζ. C. Co-activation
  of the TLR4 and IL-10 receptor (IL10R) leads to the activation of the classical
  RTKs, RAS GTPase-RAF pathways with subsequent activation of MEK2, followed by phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2. Alternatively, co-stimulation of TLR4 and IL10R may activate PI3K and/or
  PKC followed by activation of ERK in the absence of MEK1 either through MEK2 or
  through the activation of unknown kinases. Engagement of IL-10 to its receptor activates
  the JAK-STAT pathway, predominantly STAT3 with positive feedback on IL-10 production.
  Similarly, activation of ERK parallels a decrease in STAT4 phosphorylation but an
  increase in STAT3 phosphorylation resulting in decreased IL-12 promoter activity.
