caption: A two-step model for generation of axial and appendicular cartilage. (A)
  Naivepresomitic mesoderm (psm) responds to BMPs by assuming lateral plate fates
  (red); following its conversion into sclerotome (blue) by Shh, these cells respond
  to the same BMP signal by differentiating into chondrocytes (purple). (B) In the
  early limb bud, exogenous BMPs induce apoptosis (red); it is likely that endogenous
  BMPs also play a patterning role at this stage. As the limb bud matures, BMPs are
  necessary and sufficient to convert prechondrocytes (blue) into chondrocytes (purple),
  as in the somite. The scapula and ribs, which develop independently of Shh from
  the lateral somite, may follow a pathway similar to that of the limb bud. It is
  suggested that in all of these tissues a hypothetical factor ‘C’ acts to promote
  the later, chondrogenic response to BMP signaling.
