caption: A schematic representation showing the miR-34b-5p-mediated MDA5 signaling
  pathway during ALV-J infections. This model is based on knowledge of the MDA5-mediated
  signaling pathway. As a member of the RLH family, MDA5 can detect ALV-J infections
  in the cytoplasm. Abnormal expression of miR-34b-5p suppressed the function of MDA5,
  which triggered the signal transduction cascade to induce an IFNβ response and which,
  in turn, upregulated downstream antiviral genes (PKR, OAS, Mx1, and MHC class I).
  MiR-34b-5p inhibited the expression of MDA5, and led to increased proliferation
  and migration of the ALV-J-infected cells, and promoted ALV-J replication. ALV-J,
