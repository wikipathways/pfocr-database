caption: A plausible Buchwald-Hartwig catalytic cycle for the enolate-driven palladium
  catalyzed α-vinylation reaction is illustrated in . It was felt the active Pd(0)L2
  species was generated primarily by reduction of Pd(OAc)2 with triphenylphosphine
  in this phosphine-assisted catalytic cycle., The active Pd(0)L2 species could then
  undergo oxidative addition on the vinyl iodide to form a vinylpalladium(II) iodide
  complex. Ligation to the oxygen and rearrangement to the carbon atom at C(15) can
  then occur. Finally, reductive elimination of the carbon bound Pd(II) intermediate
  would furnish the desired E-olefin 10 while regenerating the active Pd(0)L2 species.
  A key to the success of this Pd-mediated cross coupling reaction rested on the enolate
  concentration. This must be high enough to permit ligand substitution to occur.
  It was well known that vinyl iodides would be quite reactive in the oxidative-addition
  step. If nucleophilic substitution of the iodide by the nucleophilic enolate in
  the coupling process was comparably slow, the rate of byproduct formation would
  be significant. Eventually, a highly reproducible yield could be obtained by employing
  an excess of the phosphine ligand. In the case of different substrates, sometimes
  it was necessary to carry out the reaction with a 10:1 ratio of PPh3 (30 mol%) to
  Pd(OAc)2 (3 mol%). The process then took three days to go to completion in comparison
  to that of five hours required under the original conditions, but the amount of
  byproducts () was decreased. The yield of the sequence in this series was 81%. Furthermore,
  the best solvent system to date was DMF/H2O (9/1), alternation to CH3CN, pure DMF,
  or DMF/H2O (4/1) resulted in no reaction or low yields. Because the conditions employed
  for the enolate driven palladium coupling process were different from the recent
  Buchwald-Hartwig arylation reactions, efforts were directed toward intramolecular
  α-vinylation under the conditions of the arylation process. This might permit lower
  catalyst loading, and be effective for both E and Z ethylidenes. The homogenous
  reaction conditions might permit a faster rate and thereby facilitate scaleup. In
  fact, Liao first reported a Pd(0) catalyzed α-vinylation process in which the cheaper
  DPEphos was employed in the case of a Z-ethylidene for the synthesis of (−)-koumidine.
  Moreover, utilization of this ligand for the synthesis of the E-ethylidene 10 was
  also executed by Liao et al. in 80% yield. However, a related approach has also
  been effective based on a palladium-catalyzed coupling of amino-tethered vinyl halides
  with ketones reported by Solé, Bonjoch et al., In this regard, ketone 22 was heated
  to 70–75 °C in the presence of a palladium (0) triphenylphosphine catalyst and potassium
  phenoxide. The intramolecular cyclization took place to afford ketone 10 in 80%
  yield, again in stereospecific fashion (See ). The use of the weaker potassium phenolate
  base limited the presence of any acetylene byproduct formed from loss of HI from
  halide 22.
