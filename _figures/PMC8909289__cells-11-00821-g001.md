caption: miRNA let-7a and epidermal growth factor stimulation control AKT1 phosphorylation
  by regulating PIK3C2A and RICTOR. Overview of the PI3K/AKT pathway and contributions
  of let-7a. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are activated by epidermal growth factor
  (EGF) stimulation, leading to activation of PIK3C2A. Active PIK3C2A phosphorylates
  PtdIns (4,5) P2 (PIP2), converting it to PtdIns (3–5) P3 (PIP3). PIP3 recruits PDK1
  and AKT1 to the cell membrane, leading to activation of PDK1, which subsequently
  phosphorylates AKT1 at Thr-308, activating the kinase. Fully activated AKT1 is formed
  by the additional phosphorylation of Ser-473 by mTORC2 and phosphorylates various
  cellular substrates. The AKT1 substrate TENT2 is inactivated by Ser-116 phosphorylation.
  Arrows indicate positive regulation, and flatheads indicate inhibition. Glows indicate
  proteins activated upon EGF stimulation. The established AKT pathway (black arrows)
  are shown along with the novel signaling pathway we identified (yellow highlights),
  where miRNA let-7a, a substrate of TENT2, forms a feedback mechanism wherein it
  inhibits the mTORC2 member RICTOR and increases PIK3C2A, leading to changes in downstream
  signaling.
