caption: Metabolic and proteomic disruption of glycolysis and the TCA cycle following
  VX exposure. All proteins and metabolites identified and quantified within these
  pathways are displayed. A series of symbols next to each protein (square) or metabolite
  (circle) represent each molecule’s temporal expression profiles. The first circle
  is a summation of all early time points up to 24 h. The second circle represents
  all ‘mid’ time points between days 1–7. The final circle denotes all ‘late’ time
  points between days 7–14
