caption: Evasion of the DNA sensor-mediated IFN-I signaling pathway by HSV-1. Cytosolic
  DNA sensors, such as cGAS, IFI16, DDX41, and DAI, recognize double-stranded DNA
  in the cytosol and trigger IFN-I production through the transmission of a series
  of signals. Multiple steps in the DNA-sensing signaling pathway can be targeted
  by HSV-1 proteins, including both DNA sensor-mediated viral recognition and subsequent
  signaling. Many adaptors and transcription factors further downstream in the DNA
  sensor-mediated signaling pathway, such as TBK1, IRF3, p65, and p50, are shared
  by the RLR-mediated IFN-I signaling pathway. Therefore, it is plausible to consider
  that viral proteins targeting these molecules in the RLR-mediated signaling pathway
  may inhibit cytosolic DNA-sensing signals through a similar mechanism. Solid lines
  indicate confirmed interactions between adaptors and HSV-1 proteins. Dashed lines
  indicate uncertain interactions or that the underlying mechanism is not known. CBP,
  CREB-binding protein; P, phosphate; U, ubiquitin. (Based on data from reference
  .)
