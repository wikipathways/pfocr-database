caption: 'Synergistic effects of combined systemic and intratumoral therapy in skin
  cancer treatment exemplified by CM. Systemic immune checkpoint inhibition (a–e):
  Blocking of immune checkpoints on cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) and CM cells disrupting
  tumor immune evasion (a). Systemic BRAFi/MEKi: Blocking overactivation of RAS-RAF
  signaling pathway in BRAF-mutated melanoma by BRAF and MEK inhibitors (b). Intratumoral
  application of genetically engineered oncolytic viral particles to express checkpoint
  inhibitors on CM cells, force production and release of tumor antigens and GM-CSF
  to prime T cell immune response and induce tumor cell lysis (c). Intratumoral pharmacological
  application of IL-2, IL12, GM-CSF, TLR-9 and STING agonists: Priming locally advanced
  CM to become immunogenic (d).'
