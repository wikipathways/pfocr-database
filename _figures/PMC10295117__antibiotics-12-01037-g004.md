caption: Mechanisms of AMPs improving host immune function. AMPs can inhibit inflammatory
  responses caused by Toll-like receptor ligands. Antimicrobial peptide inhibits an
  increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α from macrophages induced by LPS
  via Toll-like receptor ligands. This prevents a combination of LPS and lipopolysaccharide-binding
  proteins to suppress the increase in inflammatory cytokine levels caused by LPS
  on the cell membranes of macrophages. Furthermore, AMPs mediate NF-κB signaling
  and cellular immune responses by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway to improve
  immune function
