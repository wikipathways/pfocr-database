caption: Role of Excitatory Cerebellar Nucleocortical Circuit in controlling associative
  motor learning. (A) Left, schematic viral injection of AAV2-hSyn-ChR2-eYFP targeting
  the interposed nucleus. Right, in the eyeblink conditioning (EBC) paradigm, a conditioned
  stimulus (CS, tone) is presented before the onset of an unconditioned stimulus (US,
  air puff). The inter-stimulus interval (ISI) is the time interval between CS and
  US onset. The two stimuli normally co-terminate. During the training, mice learn
  to generate a delayed conditioned response (CR) to the CS before the onset of the
  expected US. (B) Mossy fiber (MF) afferents can influence deep cerebellar nuclei
  (DCN) output via projections onto granule cells (GrCs). GrCs can directly affect
  Purkinje cell (PC) activity via parallel fiber connections or indirectly via feedforward
  GrC-MLI-PC processing. The EBC paradigm increases the inhibitory/excitatory (I/E)
  ratio in PCs, indicating a preferential enhancement of the feedforward inhibitory
  GrC-MLI-PC pathway.
