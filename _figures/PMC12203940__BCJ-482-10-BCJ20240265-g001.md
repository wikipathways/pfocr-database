caption: In the β-catenin-dependent pathway, Wnt is considered ‘off’ when Wnt is not
  bound to FZD receptors and LRP5/6 co-receptors. β-catenin associates with the destruction
  complex (APC, Axin, CK1, GSK33), where it is phosphorylated by GSK-3 and CK1, followed
  by subsequent degradation via the proteasome. Wnt is considered ‘on’ when a Wnt
  ligand binds to LRP5/6 and FZD receptors, and the scaffold protein Dvl recruits
  Axin along with the kinases CK1 and GSK-3 to the membrane. This disrupts the formation
  of the destruction complex, preventing the phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin.
  As a result, β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and then translocates to the
  nucleus, where it activates transcription of Wnt target genes. In the Wnt/PCP pathway,
  small G proteins RhoA and RAC are activated via Dvl, resulting in signaling via
  the ROCK and Jnk signaling pathways. In the Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway, signaling
  is via heterotrimeric G proteins that activate PLC, which leads to a rise in intracellular
  Ca2+. This leads to the activation of calcineurin (Ca), calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  kinase II (CamKII), and PKC. Both CamKII and PKC activate various regulatory proteins
  such as NF-κB and CREB, and Cn can activate the cytoplasmic protein NFAT. CamKII,
