caption: The enzymes and intermediates involved in different reaction steps of apocarotenoid
  biosynthetic pathway known in C. sativus are shown. Heatmaps displaying the differential
  expression of transcripts encoding for enzymes (transcript identifier has been provided)
  involved in different steps are also shown. In the heatmaps, different columns represent
  tissues in order of corm, tepal, leaf, stigma and stamen from left to right (as
  given in the first heatmap on the pathway). Color scale representing normalized
  expression values is shown at the bottom.
