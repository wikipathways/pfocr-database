caption: 'The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), its bypass loops, and converging signaling
  pathways. In the classical RAS (blue), angiotensinogen is converted to angiotensin
  I (ATI) by renin. ATI is converted to angiotensin II (ATII) by angiotensin-converting
  enzyme (ACE). ATII is the main effector for the RAS that binds to ATII receptor
  1 (AT1R) and ATII receptor 2 (AT2R) to exert its physiological effects. Angiotensin
  1–7 (Ang1–7) is a cleavage product of ATII which binds to the G protein–coupled
  receptor Mas receptor (MasR), which in turn exerts physiological effects. Ang1–7
  is converted to alamandine by decarboxylation, which acts on Mas-related-G protein
  coupled receptors (MrgDs). ATII is converted to angiotensin III (ATIII) by aminopeptidase
  A, and ATIII is converted to angiotensin IV (ATIV) by aminopeptidases. ATII and
  ATIII bind to both AT1R and AT2R. Proteases including cathepsins B, D, and G, and
  chymase constitute bypass loops of the RAS (red), providing redundancies to this
  system. Other signaling pathways converge on the RAS (green) with the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway being upstream of the RAS, activated by (pro)renin receptor. Inflammatory
  signaling via the NOX-ROS-NFκB-COX2 axis, downstream of the RAS, is induced by activation
  of AT1R. Abbreviations: COX2, cyclooxygenase 2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; VEGF,
