caption: 'Toxicity overlay of anti-angiogenesis drugs combined radiotherapy. Bevacizumab
  acts on VEGF, blocking its binding to VEGFR. Anlotinib and endostar competitively
  bind to VEGFR, similarly inhibiting the VEGF/VEGFR pathway. Anlotinib can also bind
  to multiple receptors such as PEDFR, and C-kit. Through the above binding process,
  various cell activities mediated by the corresponding pathway can be inhibited:
  (1) cell cycle inhibition(main parts); (2)act on intracellular Bcl-2 protein to
  cause cell lysis; (3) downregulate HIF1α Factor; (4) inhibits DNA repair. Ultimately
  leading to pathological changes: (1) increased vascular permeability; (2) inhibits
  platelet production; (3) alveolar capillary hemorrhage (4) inhibits endothelial
  cell migration; (5) improving the radiosensitivity of tumor cells; (6) recruiting
  CD8 + T cells to infiltrate the tumor microenvironment to aggravates the inflammatory
  response. The above series of changes make patients receiving anti-angiogenesis
  drugs and chest radiation more prone to pulmonary fibrosis and exudation, ultimately
  leading to an increased risk of radiation pneumonia'
