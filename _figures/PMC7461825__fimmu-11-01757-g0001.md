caption: The role CRP on the innate immune system and tumor progression. The Fcγ receptor
  is expressed on the cell surface of immunocyte and multiple myeloma cells. CRP binds
  to Fcγ receptor to promote inflammation and tumor progression. The downstream pathways
  of this receptor in tumors include the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, the ERK/NF-κB pathway
  and the p38/MAPK pathway. CRP regulates the expression of osteolytic cytokines in
  myeloma cells through p38 MAPK-Twist signaling.
