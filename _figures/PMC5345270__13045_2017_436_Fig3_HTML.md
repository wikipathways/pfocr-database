caption: CD44 variant-xCT axis-mediated ROS regulation determines the malignant transformation
  of gastric epithelial cells showing CagA accumulation. Stabilization of xCT (cystine/glutamate
  antiporter) at the cell membrane in gastric epithelial stem cells due to high CD44v8-10
  expression promotes glutathione synthesis, thereby inactivating the Akt signaling
  pathway. Phosphorylated Akt in CD44v-negative cells induces ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent
  degradation of p53 in the cytoplasm. Activated Akt signal transduction in non-cancer
  stem-like cells expressing the standard isoform of CD44 exhibit selective autophagy-mediated
  degradation of CagA. CagA is translocated from H. pylori via type IV secretion channels,
  and importantly, accumulation of this pathogenic protein in CD44v-expressing cancer
  stem-like cells leads to carcinogenesis and maintenance of “stemness.” Note that
  the red bar shows the relatively high level, while the blue bar indicates the low
  level
