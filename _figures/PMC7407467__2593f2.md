caption: The pheromone and cell wall damage response pathways in C. albicans showing
  the effects of different deletions on white-to-opaque switching. Deletions with
  at least a fivefold decrease in white-to-opaque switching are indicated in red and
  deletions with smaller or undetectable effects are indicated in black. Data for
  the effects of the cph1 deletion on white-to-opaque switching are taken from a previous
  study (). These results suggest that, for white-opaque switching, the main input
  into Cek1 is through the cell wall damage response pathway, although there may be
  smaller contributions (indicated by the dashed line) from the pheromone response
  pathway.
