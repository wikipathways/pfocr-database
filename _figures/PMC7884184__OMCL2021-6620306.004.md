caption: Effective treatment methods to overcome therapeutic resistance. PI3K-AKT
  and Keap1-Nrf2 signalling pathways are activated after radio- or chemotherapy for
  ROS production. The downstream antioxidant elements of these two pathways facilitate
  cancers with radio- and chemoresistance by resisting the cytotoxicity of high ROS.
  Halofuginone, trigonelline, delicaflavone, and perifosine are potential inhibitors
  of the PI3K-AKT or Keap1-Nrf2 pathway to reduce resistance and meet the need of
  radiosensition and chemosensition.
