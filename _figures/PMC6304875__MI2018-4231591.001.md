caption: 'A general overview of the autophagic pathway and its regulators. In mammals,
  the ULK1/2 kinase complex regulates autophagosome initiation. ULK1/2 is regulated
  by nutrient sensing or stress signaling by mTOR complex 1, which inhibits autophagy
  in the presence of amino acids or insulin/PI3K/AKT signaling. ULK1/2 is also regulated
  by AMPK, which is activated by high AMP/low ATP levels. Activated ULK1/2 then phosphorylates
  and activates components of the class III PI3K nucleation complex responsible for
  the formation of PI3P and for the recruitment of PI3P-binding proteins. Vesicle
  elongation is mediated by two ubiquitin-like protein conjugation systems: ATG5-ATG12
  and LC3-PE. Once the autophagosome is formed, it fuses with the lysosomes and their
  contents are degraded. The figure shows pharmacological regulators of autophagy
  mentioned in the text (ATG: autophagy related; mTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin;
  PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; PI3P: phosphatidylinositol
  3-phosphate; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; 3MA: 3-methyl adenine).'
