caption: ncRNAs promote PCa growth through the PAM signaling pathway. This figure
  illustrates that ncRNAs associated with the PAM signaling pathway promote PCa growth
  through regulating apoptosis, autophagy, and cell cycle. Blue represents the role
  of suppressing the PAM signaling pathway. Red represents roles that facilitate the
  PAM signaling pathway. Cyan color represents an association with autophagy, purple
  color represents an association with apoptosis, and light red color represents an
  association with the cell cycle
