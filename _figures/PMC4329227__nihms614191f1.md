caption: The oxidative arm of pentose phosphate pathway is initiated by conversion
  of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by hexokinases. (1) Glucose-6 Phosphate
  Dehydrogenase (G6PDH) oxidizes glucose-6 phosphate to form 6-phosphogluconolactone
  while reducing NADP+ to NADPH. (2) Hydrolysis of 6-phosphogluconolactone by 6-Phosphogluconase
  (6PGL) generates 6-phosphogluconate(6PG). (3) Formation of ribulose-5-phosphate
  occurs by oxidative decarboxylation of 6-phosphogluconate by 6PGDH. In this step
  the second molecule of NADPH is generated. NADPH produced in oxidative PPP can be
  utilized for lipid biosynthesis or ROS detoxification (GSH) (see text for deatails).
  Ribulose 5 phoshate (Ru5P) undergoes (5) an isomerization by Ribulose-5-Phoshate
  Isomerase (RPI) or (6) epimerization reaction by Ribulose-5-Phoshate Epimerase (RPE)
  to generate ribose-5-phosphate(R5P) or xylulose-5-phosphate(Xu5P) respectively.
  Ribose-5-phosphate is converted to phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate that serves as the
  backbone for ribonucleotide synthesis. In the nonoxidative PPP, (7) Transketolase
  transfers two carbon units from xylulose-5-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate to generate
  sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). (8) Transaldolase
  transfers three carbon units from sedoheptulose-7-phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  to generate erythrose-4-phosphate and the first molecule of fructose-6-phosphate.
  (9) In a second transketolase reaction, two carbon units from xylulose-5-phosphate
  are transferred to erythrose-4-phosphate to yield a second molecule of fructose-6-phosphate
  and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) can either be used for
  glycolysis or be converted back to G6P to replenish the oxidative PPP, while G3P
  can be utilized in glycolysis, depending on the cellular requirements (see text
  for details). The oxidative and nonoxidative branches of the PPP are highlighted
  by a blue and yellow backgrounds respectively.
