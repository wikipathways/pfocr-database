caption: Autophagy, the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, the JUxta Nuclear
  Quality (JUNQ) control compartment, and the Insoluble Protein Deposit (IPOD) systems
  are cellular mechanisms responsible for protein maintenance. These systems are dependent
  on many chaperones and transport proteins for successful protein management. Mca1,
  Hsp104, Hsp40, Ydj1, Ssa1, VCP/p97, and p62 are some of the important chaperones
  in protein quality control systems. Most misfolded/aggregated proteins are initially
  processed in the ERAD and autophagy systems. The chaperones are very active in these
  protein quality control systems. But once proteins become terminally aggregated,
  the IPOD and JUNQ systems are utilized by the cell as alternate pathways for damage
  control. The upregulation of Mca1, Hsp104, Ydj1, p62, Ssa1, Hsp40 and VCP/p97 in
  ASH may indicate that autophagy, the ERAD, the JUNQ, and the IPOD systems are active
  in ASH.
