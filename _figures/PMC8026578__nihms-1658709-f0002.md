caption: 'The underlying genes in the drug addiction pathway in relation to miRNAs
  experimentally linked to these genes have been mapped using Cytoscape. There are
  many more non-confirmed miRNAs that are putatively targeting these genes, but for
  the sake of validity and simplicity the map has been limited to those that were
  confirmed by miRPathDB to have experimental validity linking them to impacting these
  genes. The miRNAs which have experimental data linking them to a drug of abuse mentioned
  in this article have been denoted with a number according to the key above: (1)
  METH, (2) cocaine, (3) nicotine, (4) oxycodone, (5) morphine/heroin, (6) alcohol'
