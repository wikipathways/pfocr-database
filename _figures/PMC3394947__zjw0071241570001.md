caption: Schematic representation of the proteins involved in the different pathways
  related to eicosanoid biosynthesis. Highlighted in color are proteins for which
  MRM assays have been developed, and among them, dark-colored proteins have been
  detected and quantified in RAW264.7 murine macrophage whole cell extracts by MRM
  targeted proteomics. Those proteins for which no MRM assays could be developed are
  in dark gray.
