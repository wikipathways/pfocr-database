caption: A, during LPS-induced endotoxaemia, cytokine-mediated impairment of Akt/Forkhead
  box O (FOXO) signalling is thought to be important in both the induction of muscle
  atrophy, via FOXO-mediated upregulation of muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and muscle
  RING finger 1 (MuRF1), leading to an increase in ubiquitin–proteasome pathway (UPP)-dependent
  protein degradation, and the impairment of carbohydrate oxidation, through upregulation
  of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) and subsequent pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex (PDC) inhibition. An increase in lysosome-mediated proteolysis is also thought
  to contribute to muscle protein loss, via cytokine-induced cathepsin-L upregulation.
  B, low-dose Dex infusion during endotoxaemia provides protection against muscle
  atrophy and the impairment of carbohydrate oxidation, most likely due to the blunting
  of cytokines e.g. tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Dex treatment prevents LPS-induced
  inhibition (i.e. reduced phosphorylation) of Akt and activation (i.e. reduced phosphorylation)
  of FOXO. Furthermore, LPS-induced upregulation of PDK4, and muscle glycogen breakdown
  and lactate accumulation, are suppressed by administration of Dex during endotoxaemia.
  In contrast, LPS-induced MAFbx and MuRF1 upregulation are not suppressed by Dex,
  and may be upregulated via an unknown, Akt/FOXO-independent mechanism. However,
  the LPS-induced increase in cathepsin-L mRNA expression is blunted by Dex.  and  arrows
  indicate upregulation/increased activity and downregulation/decreased activity,
  respectively, and arrow thickness represents the magnitude of upregulation/increased
  activity and downregulation/decreased activity.
