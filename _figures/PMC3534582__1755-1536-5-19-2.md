caption: Mechanism of collagen gene regulation by scleraxis. Scleraxis expression
  is increased in response to transforming growth factor (TGF)-β via the canonical
  Smad signaling pathway [,]. Collagen synthesis is upregulated by scleraxis and/or
  by Smads (for example, Smad3), either independently or synergistically via direct
  interaction with the collagen gene promoter []. It is unclear whether other mechanisms
  may upregulate scleraxis expression independently of TGF-β (dashed line). These
  mechanisms may act as a regulatory ‘cassette’, governing cardiac infarct scar formation
  [], cardiac fibrosis (and potentially fibrosis in other tissues as well) [,], tendon
  formation [,], and possibly keloid formation [] and wound healing []. Therapeutic
  attenuation of scleraxis expression or activity may provide a means to alter one
  or more of these processes.
