caption: The activation of PLC (phospholipase C) in response to GPCR agonists (G protein-coupled
  receptors) induces the cleavage of PI(4,5)P2, generating DG (diacylglycerol) and
  IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate), which leads to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular
  stores and the activation of PKC (protein kinase C), respectively. The drop in the
  total PIPn pool caused by PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis is compensated by the activation
  of PI synthesis. It has been proposed that this PI re-synthesis involves a closed
  ‘PI cycle’ (red arrows), where the DG generated by the hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 is
  selectively recycled back into PI to maintain the total PIPn pool. This process
  involves the transport of the generated DG and/or PA from the PM (plasma membrane)
  to the ER (endoplasmic reticulum), where it can be utilized by PI synthesis enzymes
  CDS and PIS. This cycle could be spatially confined to PM-ER contact sites, where
  LTPs (lipid transfer proteins) transport the lipid intermediates between membranes
  (dotted lines). The C38:4 backbone could facilitate the PI cycle by providing molecular
  identity with the DG and PA molecules, preventing their consumption by other biosynthetic
  pathways as well as the utilization of intermediates from other origins, such as
  PA generated from PC via PLD (phospholipase D).
