caption: 'Mechanism of action of GS-441524 and Remdesivir following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  The diagram depicts the structures and potential disposition of GS-441524 in SARS-CoV-2
  infected cytoplasm of a Type II pneumocyte. Remdesivir is converted into GS-441524
  extracellularly and into NTP intracellularly, while the only major metabolic pathway
  of GS-441524 is its conversion into NTP in cells. The bioactivation of Remdesivir
  involves liver-specific enzymes Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), Cathepsin A (CTSA), and
  Histidine Triad Nucleotide Binding Protein 1 (HINT1). NTP disrupts RdRp activities,
  inhibits viral replication, and prevents the translation and assembly of viral proteins
  (e.g., Spike protein, Envelope protein, Membrane protein) to ultimately minimize
  further damages of the human body from the amplifying SARS-CoV-2 virus. Recreated
