caption: 'The steroid synthesis pathway and photomicrographs of immunohistochemical
  labeling of steroid synthases in the resected tumor. The tumor was positive for
  steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), 21-hydroxylase, 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11β1),
  17α-hydroxylase, DHEA-sulfotransferase (DHEA-ST), and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  (HSD) 5 (17β-HSD5). The tumor was negative for 3β-HSD and 18-hydroxylase (CYP11β2).
  Blue dotted lines show related enzymes. Bold arrows mean “convertible” because of
  the existence of related enzymes. Dotted arrows mean “difficult to convert” because
  of low-level related enzymes. Scale bar: 100 μm. Abbreviations: DHEA: dehydroepiandrosterone,
  DOC: deoxycorticosterone.'
