caption: Ca2+ channels in the ER are involved in regulating neuroinflammation, apoptosis,
  tau phosphorylation and Aβ deposition, leading to cognitive impairment. The accumulation
  of Aβ in neuronal cells induces Ca2+ influx from the intracellular Ca2+ store, namely,
  the ER. In addition, Ca2+ depletion from the ER triggers sustained extracellular
  Ca2+ influx to the cytosol via a SOCE pathway, including TRPC1 and Orai1, by activating
  the Stim. During these processes, InsP3R and RyR2 play important roles in inducing
  Ca2+ influx from the ER to the cytosol, regulating apoptosis, neurogenesis, tau
  phosphorylation and Aβ deposition and subsequently leading to cognitive impairment.
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SOCE, store-operated calcium entry.
