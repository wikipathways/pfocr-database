caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway for BSH compared with MSH. BSH biosynthesis requires
  three enzymes that sequentially couple GlcNAc to malic acid (BshA), deacetylate
  the GlcNAc-Mal intermediate to generate GlcN-Mal (BshB), and couple Cys to generate
  BSH (BshC). In B. subtilis, two genes (bshB1 and bshB2) encode enzymes with BshB
  activity. MSH biosynthesis (bottom) follows a parallel logic, with two additional
  steps: a dephosphorylation (catalyzed by MshA2) after the initial coupling, and
  a final acetylation of the Cys amino group (MshD).'
