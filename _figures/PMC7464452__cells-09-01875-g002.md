caption: Possible endothelial–mesenchymal and epithelial–mesenchymal interactions
  in BPD-PH. Disrupted endothelial Apelin, miR-503, and miR-424 results in an increased
  expression of FGF2 and induces the hyperproliferation of vessel smooth muscle cells
  (VSMC). An increase of α-SMA-positive myofibroblasts could be due to endothelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EndMT). The continuous high expression of miR-154 in AT2 cells stimulate
  the activation of TGFβ1 signaling pathway, which results in an impaired alveologenesis.
  Decreased FGF10 expression in BPD, which is caused by the upregulation of miR-421,
  SHH, and Spry2, leads to the downregulation of VEGFA and upregulation of α-SMA,
  ultimately resulting in an impaired angiogenesis and an increase of α-SMA positive
  cells. However, whether FGF10 acts directly on the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)
  to induce them to differentiate into α-SMA positive cells or through activating
  TGFβ1 signaling pathway needs to be further investigated.
