caption: 'Each example shows a major mechanism that makes them a source of signaling
  diversification: paralog-specific interaction profiles, expression patterns, and
  protein regulators. (a) SMAD2 and SMAD3 critical paralog proteins are represented
  with their domain structures and major phosphorylation motifs. Note the 30 amino
  acid insert in SMAD2 (red), the different phosphorylation sites (dark green) and
  the different binding partners of SMAD2 and 3, including the absence of the DNA-binding
  site in SMAD2. Only multi-pathway protein interactors are presented (except ALK4,
  ALK5 and ALK7, which are receptors of the TGF-β pathways). Phosphorylations are
  represented by directed edges from a kinase, and protein interactions by edges without
  arrows. Relative affinity of an interaction is shown with normal and dashed lines.
  NLS: Nuclear Localization Signal, TA: Transcription Activator. Structure and binding
  information are based on the work of Wrighton et al. (b) The role of paralog-specific
  ligands and co-factors is demonstrated with the NOTCH critical paralog group. Activating
  interactions are shown with green arrows, inhibiting interactions with red blunted
  arrows. Dashed links are for indirect effects. NOTCH interactors are shown in blue,
  and those that function in other pathways are highlighted with a yellow border.
  Only NOTCH1 has connections to such proteins. MFNG and LFNG have opposing effects
  on NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 meanwhile, NOTCH3 can inhibit NOTCH1 interactions within the
  Notch pathway. (c) Two MAPK critical paralog groups. For clarity, only selected
  interactor proteins are shown, and we excluded phosphatases and scaffold proteins.
  We present the expression patterns of each protein in three selected tissue types
  where the expression difference illustrates its regulatory role in the regulation
  of signaling flow: liver and gall (brown), cardiovascular (red), peripheral nervous
  system (green). Full circles represent expressed proteins, while empty circles represent
  non-expressed ones. Edges are marked with the color of the tissue, where the given
  interaction may happen as both interactor proteins are present. Note, the different
  ways of signaling flow and output functions in the three tissues based on expression
  levels only.'
