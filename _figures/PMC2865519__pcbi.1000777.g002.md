caption: According to the French-American-British (FAB) classification, AML samples
  are classified into seven different types according to their level of differentiation
  (see ). Expression data from 362 AML patients and 7 Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS-AML)
  patients is used to construct a phylogeny of these leukemias. We include expression
  data of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), CD34+ cells from bone marrow (CD34 BM)
  and peripheral blood (CD34 PB), and mononuclear cells from bone marrow (BM) and
  peripheral blood (PB). The differentiation pathway from hESCs to mononuclear cells
  from peripheral blood is represented in purple, and the common ancestors of subtypes
  are shown as pink dots. The bootstrap values of branches are indicated by boxed
  numbers, representing the percentage of bootstrapping trees containing this branch.
  The ranking of AML subtypes identified by the phylogenetic algorithm corresponds
  with the differentiation status indicated by the FAB classification. The M6 subtype,
  represented by only 10 samples in our dataset, has the least stable branch, leading
  to lower bootstrap values for those branches where it can alternatively be located.
