caption: Viral carcinogenesis pathway and differentially expressed genes in primary
  NSCLC tumors. The viral carcinogenesis was displayed in part, focusing on three
  over-expressed genes in virus-infected Primary NSCLC tumors in comparison with uninfected
  primary tumors. Eclipse and rectangle boxes indicate viral product and host cellular
  target, respectively. a HPN (hepsin), b ACTN4 (actinin alpha 4), and c GP130 (interleukin
  6 signal transducer) are host cellular targets of three different viral oncoproteins
  (HBx, Tax, and vIL-6) that lead to cell proliferation/survival, regulation of actin
  cytoskeleton, and proliferation angiogenesis, respectively
