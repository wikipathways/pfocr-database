caption: 'The hierarchical executive control system for movement. The executive control
  system is anatomically organized via a hierarchical architecture of cortical modules
  (layers, minicolumns with microcircuits), subcortical nuclei (basal ganglia and
  thalamus with cortical-subcortical-thalamic loops; hippocampus and hypothalamus),
  brainstem (midbrain, pons, medulla with cortical-brainstem networks), and spinal
  cord (locomotor central pattern generators, CPG). At the higher level in the hierarchy
  are the columnar laminar modules of frontal (cognitive), parietal (motor), extrastriate
  (visual), temporal, orbital frontal cortices (emotion) and entorhinal (limbic),
  Beneath, are the subcortical structures: striatum (caudate, Cn, putamen, Pu and
  nucleus accumbens, NAcc), globus pallidus [GPe/GPi (external/internal segments),
  the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA), the ventral pallidum (VP), substantia
  nigra (SNc/SNr: pars compacta/pars reticulata), subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the
  thalamus. Motivation and emotion are processed by the hypothalamus and amygdala,
  respectively. The coordination of the navigation systems involves the frontal cortex
  and the hippocampus (Hipp). The subthalamic locomotor region (SLR) is a subcortical
  center for coordinating locomotion. At the level of the brain-stem and spinal cord,
  locomotion is initiated by the direct activation or disinhibition of the mesencephalic
  locomotor region (MLR) and/or the reticulospinal (RS) pathway. Stimulation of the
  MLR activates reticulospinal neurons which project through the ventrolateral funiculus
  to activate spinal locomotor central pattern generator neurons, in part, by the
  release of excitatory amino acids. The reticulospinal pathway is considered to comprise
  the primary “command pathway” for the initiation of locomotion. MLR stimulation
  also activates in parallel, multiple monoaminergic descending pathways during centrally-generated
  locomotion. The flexor (F) and extensor (E) components of the locomotor CPG are
  activated/modulated by descending bilateral reticulospinal and monoaminergic projections
  as well as by crossed excitatory (▸) and inhibitory (•) segmental projections from
  the CPG opposite to it. Sensory afferents from skin and muscles innervate spinal
  neurons in the dorsal horn, intermediate zone and ventral horn to fine-tune the
  locomotor step cycle. Details of the flexor and extensor components of the CPG are
  omitted in order to emphasize general interconnections between them and their target
  neurons. LC, locus ceruleus; SubC, subceruleus; KF, Kölliker-Fuse; DRG, dorsal root
