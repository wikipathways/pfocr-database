caption: The Effect of Cortisol Reactivity on the Relationship between Autonomy and
  Relatedness and Adolescents' Externalizing Problems and Internalizing Problems.
  Standardized betas are presented and * indicates significance at p < .05 level.
  aindicates that the critical ratio difference test was above 1.96 indicating significant
  differences across groups in the structural pathway. Those low in cortisol reactivity
  are to the left and youth high in cortisol reactivity are to the right of the diagonal.
  Analyses controlled for gender and W1 youth outcomes. Although represented here
  in the same figure, separate models were estimated for externalizing problems and
  internalizing problems.
