caption: The pathway for EBV reactivation-induced Ig production. [1] B cells are infected
  by EBV released by preexisted plasma cells. [2] Newly infected cells become latency
  3 and express LMP1. LMP1 activates host cells (polyclonal B cell activation). [3]
  LMP1 stimulates AID expression through NF-κB, which enables to produce class-switched
  Ig. [4] EBV reactivation induces plasma cell differentiation and Ig production.
  CSR, class-switch recombination; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B.
