caption: Molecular cascade of the involvement of GluD2 or GluRδ2 in cerebellar cell
  death. Black arrows and texts represent pathways/molecules, respectively, proved
  to be directly involved in degeneration in Lurcher mice. Gray arrows and texts are
  used for pathways/molecules, respectively, involved in cell death mechanisms in
  general, but not being proved to be specifically enhanced in Lurcher mice. Because
  of their relation to components of the cascades that are modified in Lurchers, their
  direct or indirect role can be hypothesized.??– unknown signals and components of
  the signaling pathway.???– Hypothesis presented by many authors [70, 72, 76–78]
