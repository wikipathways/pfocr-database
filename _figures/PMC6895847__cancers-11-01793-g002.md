caption: The unfolded protein response (UPR) and its connection to cell death. Under
  severe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, sustained protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like
  ER kinase (PERK) activation is required for the transition from protective to pro-apoptotic
  UPR function. Cell-surface binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) forms a complex
  with Kringle 5, enhancing caspase-7-mediated cell death. In addition, extracellular
  prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) binds to cell-surface BiP, thereby leading
  to apoptosis via activation of Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD)/caspase-8/caspase-3
  pathway. Upregulated CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP)
  regulates the expression of pro-apoptotic and pro-survival genes, thereby leading
  to cell death. CHOP also mediates cell death via the upregulation of the expression
  of ER oxidoreductin 1 (ERO1α) and growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein
  (GADD34). As a molecular scaffold, inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1) is responsible
  for the recruitment of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated
  receptor 2 (TRAF2), and for the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  signaling pathways, triggering cell death. In addition, regulated IRE1-dependent
  decay (RIDD)-mediated cleavage of miRNAs and mRNAs induces cell death.
