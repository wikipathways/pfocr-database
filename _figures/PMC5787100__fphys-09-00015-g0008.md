caption: The proposed regulatory pathway for astragaloside IV action in inhibition
  of adipose lipolysis. Astragaloside IV (AIV) activated Akt and prevented cAMP accumulation
  in adipose tissue by protecting PDE3B induction from inflammation- associated impairment,
  and thereby inhibited lipolysis via blocking cAMP/PKA activation and decreased hepatic
  glucose production via reducing hepatic lipid deposition.
