caption: Toll-like receptor (TLR), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like
  receptor (NLR), and retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) signaling.
  TLR1 or TLR2 or TLR6 recognizes lipoproteins, TLR3 recognizes dsRNA, TLR4 recognizes
  bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TLR5 recognizes bacterial flagellin, TLR7/8
  mediates recognition of ssRNA. TLR9 acts as a DNA sensor and recognizes CpG DNA
  of bacteria and viruses. The NLR proteins NOD1 and NOD2 are cytosolic pattern recognition
  receptors (PRRs). NOD1 senses intracellular meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP), whereas
  NOD2 recognizes muramyl dipeptide (MDP). C-type lectin receptor (CLR) signaling
  senses carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), or structurally similar C-type lectin-like
  domains (CTLDs). The RLR pathway is involved in the recognition of viral dsRNA.
  TLR, NLR, CLR, and RLR signaling causes activation of NF-κB, leading to the production
  of proinflammatory cytokines and the stimulation of immune responses.
