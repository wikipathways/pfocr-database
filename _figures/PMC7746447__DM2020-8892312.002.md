caption: 'TRPV2 regulation is involved in cellular responses relevant to cancer. In
  unstimulated cells, the majority of TRPV2 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and
  (early) endosomal compartments, while a minor fraction of the channel is present
  at the cell surface. Upon stimulation of the cells with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-
  (PI3K-) activating ligand, the vesicular transport of TRPV2 is increased between
  intracellular compartments and plasma membrane. Subsequently, the increase in TRPV2-mediated
  Ca2+ entry leads to activation of signaling pathways involved in cellular processes
  (e.g., survival, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and migration/metastasis).
  When stimulation is terminated, TRPV2 is recycled back to the intracellular compartments
  via an endocytic pathway. PM: plasma membrane; ER: endoplasmic reticulum.'
