caption: Schematic model of the signaling networks involving H2 and NO during adventitious
  root development in cucumber. The H2 triggers a transient NO accumulation. In turn,
  NO induces the division of cell and the expression of cell cycle-related gens, CycA/B
  and CDKA/B. The above pathway might be mediated by the expression of CsDNAJ-1 and
  CDPK1/5 genes. T bars, inhibition
