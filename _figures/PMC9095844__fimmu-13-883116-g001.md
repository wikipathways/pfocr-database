caption: (A) Mechanism of redox regulation by the thioredoxin (Trx) system. The reduced
  form of Trx catalyzes the reduction of the disulphide bonds in the target protein.
  Oxidized thioredoxin is restored to its reduced state by the NADPH-dependent flavoenzyme
  thioredoxin reductase. (B) Trx1 inhibition of eosinophil activation and chemotaxis.
  Trx1 can eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by eosinophils and directly
  inhibit the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal pathway when
  entering cells. Trx1 regulates Th2 response by inhibiting IL-13 production, which
  prevents IL-13 from stimulating epithelial cells or fibroblasts to produce eotaxin.
  In addition, Trx1 blocks the pro-inflammatory effect of the upstream chemokine macrophage
  migration inhibitory factor, which can directly induce the chemotaxis of eosinophils
  or promote the production of eotaxin by epithelial cells or fibroblasts to promote
  eosinophil recruitment. (C) Potential mechanisms of the effects of Trx1 on mast
  cell degranulation. Crosslinking of the allergen and IgE complex with FcϵRI activates
  the mast cell degranulation pathway, which then activates Lyn, Syk, Btk, and phospholipase
  Cγ (PLCγ). Activation of PLCγ eventually activates Ca2+ and protein kinase c (PKC),
  which contributes to degranulation. ROS induced in FcϵRI-stimulated mast cells activate
  mast cells by activating PLCγ, Ca2+ influx, and PKC. Accordingly, Trx1 prevents
  mast cell degranulation by scavenging ROS. The effective catalytic function of βII
  tryptase secreted by mast cells depends on the existence of normal disulphide bonds
  in molecules. The Trx1 system selectively reduces the number of disulphide bonds,
  which then reduces the catalytic activity of βII-tryptase.
