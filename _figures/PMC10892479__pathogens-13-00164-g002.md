caption: 'Activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway induced by SARS-Co-V-2 and mediated
  by RIP/TRAF-dependent pathways or RIP-dependent/TRAF-independent IKKβ activation.
  The pathways activating NF-κB are RIP/TRAF-dependent pathways and RIP-dependent/TRAF-independent
  IKKβ activation, which may encompass antigen receptor signaling. Signaling to IKK
  downstream of RIPs and TRAFs involves several kinases implicated in NF-κB signaling
  pathways. Specifically, IKK activation is mediated by TAK1 in the TNF-alpha and
  IL-1 signaling pathways. RIP/TRAP-dependent pathways, including TNF receptor 1,
  IL-1 receptor, and TLR4 receptor signaling stimulated with their ligands (such as
  TNF-alpha, IL-1, and SARS-Co-V-2 spike proteins, respectively), recruit the binding
  of adaptor proteins such as RIP1-TRAF2-TRADD with TNF receptor 1, and MyD88-IRAK1-TRAF6
  with the TLR4/IL-1 receptor. SARS-Co-V-2 spike proteins stimulate TLR4 signaling
  that recruits the binding of adopter protein TRIF, which leads to TAK1-mediated
  IKK activation. K63-linked polyubiquitin chain formation occurs by catalyzation
  with E3 ligase TRAF. K63-linked polyubiquitin chains bind to TAB2 and TAB3 subunits,
  thereby leading to the assembly and activation of the TAK1-TABs complex. IKKs bind
  to NEMO, forming an IKK-NEMO complex. The TAK1-TABs complex phosphorylates the IKKα
  and IKKβ present in the IKK-NEMO complex, leading to the activation of IKKs, which
  further activates transcription factor NF-κB (p65/p50). The transcription of NF-κB
  target genes leads to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. LT-beta signaling-mediated
  alternative NF-κB activation through NIK is independent of TAK1, whereas NIK signaling
  mediates TAK1-dependent classical NF-κB activation. In RIP-dependent/TRAF-independent
  IKKβ activation, TNFα stimulates the TNF receptor 1, which induces the binding of
  adopter protein RIP that further recruits the IKK complex by direct interaction
  with NEMO and leads to IKKβ activation and NF-κB activation. NF-κB: Nuclear factor
