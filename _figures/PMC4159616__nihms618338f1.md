caption: Cholesterol is converted to two primary bile acids in human liver, CA and
  CDCA. Key regulatory enzymes in these pathways include CYP7A1, CYP8B1, CYP27A1,
  and CYP7B1. CYP7A1 initiates the classic (neutral) biosynthetic pathway, while CYP27A1
  initiates the alternative (acidic) pathway in liver and macrophages. CA and CDCA
  can be conjugated with glycine (G) and taurine (T). In the intestine, conjugated
  CA and CDCA are deconjugated and then dehydroxylated at the 7α-position to the secondary
  bile acids DCA and LCA, respectively.
