caption: Proposed cross-regulation of TRα1 and Wnt effectors in normal intestine and
  in tumors. In physiological conditions (Wild Type panel), TRα1 binding on TREs regulates
  in a positive manner the expression and stabilization of β-catenin, then contributing
  to maintain epithelial homeostasis. In vil-TRα1 mice, the levels of stabilized β-catenin
  are increased leading to WNT activation and hyper-proliferation. In vil-TRα1/Apc
  mice, the stronger β-catenin stabilization and Tcf4 overexpression might induce
  a competitive shift in TRα1 binding from TREs to WREs. We can speculate that this
  mechanism is one of the factors responsible for the activation and/or the acceleration
  of the tumorigenic process dependent upon TRα1-up regulation. TREs, Thyroid hormone
  response elements; WREs, WNT response elements. Solid arrows indicate genomic actions;
  dotted lines represent (i) the β-catenin translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus
  and (ii) the speculative model of TRα1 shift from TRE to WRE. Thickness of the solid
  arrows indicates an increased level of transcriptional activity. Double black arrows
  indicate crypt width in WT and vil-TRα1 intestinal sections or the size of the altered
  mucosa in vil-TRα1/Apc tumor.
