caption: Synthesis and breakdown of proteins by amino acids. The increased concentration
  of       extracellular amino acids, via a plasma membrane signal or sensor, causes
  activation of mTOR       which via eIF4E and p70S6K stimulates protein synthesis
  and suppresses protein       breakdown by the autophagy/lysosome pathway. Amino
  acids, by stimulating insulin secretion,       could also induce these changes via
  the Akt pathway. However, the stimulatory effect of amino       acid administration
  on insulin secretion has not been consistently documented (see text for       details).
