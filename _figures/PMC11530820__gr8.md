caption: Heparin enhances recovery after AGEs-stimulated endothelial injuryThe combination
  of glucose and proteins in the blood generates AGEs, which bind to RAGE on the membrane
  of vascular endothelial cells to activate NADPH and ROS, inducing downstream signaling
  pathways, such as the Ras-MEK-ERK/JAK-MAPK/PI3K-AKT pathways, to mediate inflammation.
  AKT activates the nuclear expression of NF-κB, which exacerbates inflammation and
  injures vascular endothelial cells. However, heparin antagonizes the AGEs-RAGE interaction
  by competitively binding RAGE, and interaction with extracellular matrix proteins
  or HMGB-1 to block RAGE signaling pathway. Additionally, heparin promotes the expression
  of LYAR, ultimately alleviating vascular endothelial injury
