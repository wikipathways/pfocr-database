caption: Schematic diagram demonstrating the signaling pathway in the context of ectomesenchymal
  interaction for maintenance and proliferation of DESCs in mouse incisor cervical
  loop. Nfic is involved the cell proliferation and maintenance of DESCs in two different
  pathways. Within the dental epithelium, it mediates FGF8-NFIC-SOX2 signaling pathway.
  In the dental mesenchymal stem cell, Nfic induces FGF10 which controls the proliferation
  of dental epithelial stem cells.
