caption: Cartoon models of DR6 signaling (A) DR6-mediated intracellular signaling
  pathways are showed in four different cells, brain endothelial cell, neurons, HeLa,
  and HEK293T. In brain endothelial cell, DR6 and TROY complex is involved in angiogenesis
  and BBB formation. They are regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling and engage in crosstalk
  with the VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway. In neuron cells, DR6 can interact with APP
  or p75NTR to promote neuronal apoptosis and axonal degeneration. In HeLa cells,
  DR6 can promote mitochondria-dependent apoptosis through membrane protein PSAP.
  In HEK293T, DR6 can induce NF-kB pathway and promote cell survival through adaptor
  protein TRADD. (B) Extracellular signaling pathway of sDR6. In MCF-7 cancer cell
  line, cleavage of the extracellular region of DR6 by the metalloenzyme MMP-14 leads
  to the formation of sDR6. This soluble protein can hinder the differentiation of
  monocytes into immature dendritic cells, thereby inhibiting the body’s immune response.
  In neurons, sDR6 produced by metalloprotease ADAM10 cleavage can trans-act on Schwann
  cells and inhibit their proliferation and myelination in the PNS. The intracellular
  domain is released into the cytosol and rapidly degraded by proteasome.
