caption: CR signaling mediators to chromatin. CR induces an energetic imbalance through
  changes in the NAD+/NADH ratio that activates Sirtuins and down-regulates PARPs.
  Because of their capacity to respond to changes in the NAD+/NADH ratio, CtBP and
  GAPDH (and other metabolic enzymes such as LDH) are likely to be activated by CR
  response (gray arrows), but the link between their activity and CR has not been
  formally demonstrated yet. Interestingly, the inhibition of the TOR pathway by CR
  has dramatic effects on chromatin nucleolar structure and expression (see the text).
  In blue boxes are represented the roles that these mediators perform or are likely
  to perform (indicated by ?) in chromatin.
