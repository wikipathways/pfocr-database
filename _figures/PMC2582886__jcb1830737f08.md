caption: Proposed model of p120 action. The presence of E-cadherin causes the potent
  inhibition of Ras and Rac1, inhibits MAPK/ERK signaling, reduces cyclin D1, and
  promotes increased levels of p27, thus blocking cell growth. Under these conditions,
  p120 promotes the stabilization of E-cadherin complexes and their ability to suppress
  Ras. p120 recruitment by E-cadherin also decreases mesenchymal cadherin stability
  and function, resulting in reduced Rac1 activation. However, upon E-cadherin loss
  during tumor progression, the negative regulation of Ras is relieved. Under these
  conditions, endogenous p120 induces transformed cell growth by activating Rac1 and
  inducing the Rac1-dependent, PAK-mediated phosphorylation of Raf and MEK, which
  result in the constitutive, anchorage-independent activation of the Ras–MAPK–ERK
  signaling pathway. Dotted arrows denote potential Ras-mediated signaling events
  leading to anchorage-independent growth.
