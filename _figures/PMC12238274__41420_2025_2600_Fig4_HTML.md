caption: 1. ApoE4 competes with insulin for the IR and traps the IR in the endosome,
  thereby hindering the endocytic recycling of IR [111]. 2. ApoE4 inhibits key molecules
  in the insulin signaling pathway, including the HK, GLUT, and PGC-1α, the master
  regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to impaired insulin signaling, glycolytic
  function, and mitochondrial respiration [28, 112, 138]. 3. Under specific conditions
  (such as low ATP and high FAs levels), AMPK may be activated in ApoE4-expressing
  neurons to adapt to and mitigate fatty acid toxicity [103]. 4. ApoE4-mediated cholesterol
  accumulation may interfere with ABCA1 localization or recycling at the plasma membrane,
  impairing its lipid efflux function and disrupting ApoE lipidation. ApoE levels
  may also be affected, and inadequate cholesterol transport leads to further intracellular
  lipid accumulation [139–141]. Excess fatty acids (FAs) can cause mitochondrial uncoupling
  and dysfunction, further inhibiting glucose metabolism and mitochondrial OXPHOS
  in neurons [103]. 5. Lipid degradation in astrocytes is also impaired due to mitochondrial
  dysfunction, leading to lipid accumulation and reduced ability to receive additional
  lipid transfer from neurons. Aerobic glycolysis is suppressed, resulting in excessive
  lactate production [103, 118, 119]. Although lactate shuttling can provide metabolic
  fuel to neurons, this compromised metabolic state cannot effectively support sustained
  and stable neuronal metabolism, and excessive lactate accumulation may further damage
  the surrounding environment [118, 119]. Red lines indicate blocked pathways. Ac-CoA
