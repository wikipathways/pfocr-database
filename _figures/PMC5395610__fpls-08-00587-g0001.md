caption: A simplified overview of the direct ABA biosynthesis in fungi and the indirect
  biosynthesis in plants. Yellow background indicates cytosolic compartment, and green
  background the chloroplast compartment. For more detailed biosynthetic pathways,
  see Siewers et al. () for the direct pathway in fungi and Finkelstein () for the
  indirect pathway in plants. Molecular structures in scalable vector graphics (SVG)
  format were obtained from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org) on 2017-02-08, and
  the images were licensed “public domain” by the original authors.
