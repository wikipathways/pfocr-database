caption: MiRNAs in inflammatory milieu of rheumatoid joint. Roles of several miRNAs
  in T cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle of synovial cells and joint destruction
  are depicted. Importantly, there appears to have a feedback loop by which miRNAs
  contribute to inflammatory reactions and synovial phenotype in rheumatoid joints.
  Through NF-κB pathway, some miRNAs such as miR-146a and miR-155 may stimulate the
  release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-17. As the inflammatory
  mediators, these cytokines can induce lymphocytes, resident synovial cells and other
  inflammatory cells to produce miRNAs that related to disease activity of RA patients.
  Bcl-2 = B-cell lymphoma 2, FAF1 = Fas associated factor 1, MMPs = matrix metalloproteinases,
  NF-κB = nuclear factorκB, XIAP = X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein.
