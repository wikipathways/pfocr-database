caption: The potential mechanism of cells dysfunctions that S1P may stimulus S1PR1/3
  coupled Gαi/Gαs conversion and the regulation of GE. S1P binds to the ligand S1PR1/3,
  resulting in an imbalance in the conversion of Gαi and Gαs and inducing an inflammatory
  response. Meanwhile, it mediates the activation of the downstream signal pathway
  AC/cAMP and protein ERK1/2, which leads to the dysfunctions of FLSs. GE exerts regulation
  by blocking S1PR1/3 coupling Gαi/Gαs conversion, restoring the dynamic balance of
  Gαi and Gαs protein and anti-/pro-inflammatory factors.
