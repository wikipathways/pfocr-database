caption: The schematic elucidation of the FA pathway mechanism used during DNA repair.
  In response to exogenous and/or endogenous damage, 8 FA genes (FANCA, FANCB, FANCC,
  FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, and FANCM) were assembled into the FA core complex,
  which functioned as a nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, to monoubiquitinate the
  I-D heterodimer. The monoubiquitinated I-D heterodimer was localized to the damaged
  chromatin, and interacted with DNA-repair proteins and other FA proteins (FANCD1,
  FANCDN, FANCJ, and FANCS) in the FA pathway, to conduct the repair process through
  homologous recombination (HR). After the damage was repaired, monoubiquitin was
  removed from the I-D complex by a de-ubiquitylation enzyme, Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase
  1 (USP1), to “turn off” the network.
