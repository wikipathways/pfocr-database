caption: Network analysis using key molecules in VL pathogenesis. We prioritized five
  DEGs (STAT1, MYC, PRKCD, PTPN6, and FGFR2) based on combined transcriptional- (VL-blood
  and skin) as well as in silico bioinformatics-based analyses. These 5 molecules/proteins
  were used as seed nodes to construct a network using the shortest path algorithm
  with a 2-step connection. Proteins are ordered according to their cellular localization
  from left to right. All five prioritized molecules are reaction hubs (blue ovals)
  where curated interactions are observed with both positive (green lines) and negative
  effects (red lines) directly to and from (direction of arrow) the hubs with several
  objects in the VL-blood profile as well as the larger human proteome database. (a)
  Portions of several canonical pathways are included in the network (in cyan), (b)
  a few canonical pathway portions have been traced including PTPN6-MYC-ELK1, Collagen
  1-alpha11/beta1integrin-MYC, PTPN6-JAK2-BCL2 (in magenta) that are involved in immune
  regulation and inflammation and others such as CASP8-Cytochrome c-CASP9, Apo2L-DR5-BAX
  (in orange), are associated with apoptosis and survival. Gene expression data from
  both VL-blood and skin profiles are overlaid on the same network. The up- and down-stream
  interactions revealed by our network analyses may be leveraged to assess and validate
  functional consequences of targeting the 5 molecules by therapeutic drugs in future
  investigations. See Fig.  for legend
