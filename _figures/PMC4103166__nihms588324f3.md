caption: The central pacemaker controlled autonomic nervous and neuroendocrine systems
  (ANS and NES) rhythmically signal to all of their target tissues. The resulting
  circadian rhythm in peripheral tissue function also generates local and/or circulating
  signaling molecules that rhythmically act on their targets. Together, these extracellular
  signals including neurotransmitters, steroid hormones, peptide hormones, chemokines,
  growth factors and cytokines activate intracellular signaling mediated by G-protein
  coupled receptors (GPCRs), tyrosine kinase receptors, integrins (not shown), and
  nuclear receptors in a tissue and cell-type specific manner. These same intracellular
  signaling pathways also activate the peripheral clock. The coordinated activities
  of the central and peripheral clocks orchestrate the complicated extracellular and
  intracellular signaling to maintain tissue homeostasis by controlling a network
  of gene expression. Disruption of the central clock-controlled extracellular signaling
  or mutations in core circadian genes both abolish peripheral clock activity leading
  to loss of circadian homeostasis in peripheral tissues. The representative intracellular
  signaling pathways directly or indirectly controlled by the central clock shown
  in the figure include the c-AMP/PKA/CREB/AP1, Ras/MARK/JNK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/β-Catenin/TCF/LEF
  pathways essential for c-Myc activation and cell cycle progression–, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling controlling biosynthesis and drug resistance,, the GPCR/ATM signaling
  for p53 activation, the GPCR/PKC/NF-κB pathway that regulates stress and immune
  response, the JAK/STAT pathway controlling apoptotic response, and the GR and ERα
  signaling pathways cross-talking with the AP1 signaling,. These signaling pathways
  also control the expression and function of circadian genes leading to a coupled
  activation of the molecular clock with tissue-specific function in vivo including
  cell proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis, DNA repair, biosynthesis, secretion and
  senescence–.

  description: The central pacemaker controlled autonomic nervous and neuroendocrine
    systems (ANS and NES) rhythmically signal to all of their target tissues. The
    resulting circadian rhythm in peripheral tissue function also generates local
    and/or circulating signaling molecules that rhythmically act on their targets.
    Together, these extracellular signals including neurotransmitters, steroid hormones,
    peptide hormones, chemokines, growth factors and cytokines activate intracellular
    signaling mediated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), tyrosine kinase receptors,
    integrins (not shown), and nuclear receptors in a tissue and cell-type specific

    clock. The coordinated activities of the central and peripheral clocks orchestrate
    the complicated extracellular and intracellular signaling to maintain tissue homeostasis
    by controlling a network of gene expression. Disruption of the central clock-controlled
    extracellular signaling or mutations in core circadian genes both abolish peripheral
    clock activity leading to loss of circadian homeostasis in peripheral tissues.
    The representative intracellular signaling pathways directly or indirectly controlled
    by the central clock shown in the figure include the c-AMP/PKA/CREB/AP1, Ras/MARK/JNK/ERK
