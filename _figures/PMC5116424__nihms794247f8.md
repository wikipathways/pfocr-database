caption: A simplistic chemotaxis signaling pathway of B. burgdorferi (wave-like red
  shapes) is depicted here and is described in the Discussion. We postulate that CheY2
  or CheY1 controls some non-chemotactic cellular processes such as serving as virulence
  determinants rather than acting as a classical chemotaxis response regulator, like
  CheY3. Tick illustrations were kindly provided by the Medical Entomology and Zoonoses
  Ecology team at Public Health, England.
