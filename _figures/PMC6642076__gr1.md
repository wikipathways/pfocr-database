caption: 'Schematic representation of the complement system, showing approximately
  50 directly involved soluble and membrane-bound complement proteins. The complement
  system is activated through three different pathways: the classical, lectin, and
  alternative pathway. Activation of each of these proteolytic cascades leads to the
  cleavage of the central component complements C3 and C5. Complement factors are
  also active in extrinsic pathways. The multiplex MRM Complement assay targets proteins
  from the three main pathways, as indicated in green. Proteins indicated in orange
  are those that were excluded from the assay because of low abundance. Proteins indicated
  in red were not detectable with this method. Proteins in gray are not in the assay
  as they are mostly membrane bound or complexes. (For interpretation of the references
  to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
  article.)'
