caption: Schematic presentation of the mechanism underlying RAS‐MAPK inhibition‐induced
  upregulation of CD73 expression in a subset of cancer cells lines. (A) CD73 expression
  is stimulated by strong activation of the RAS‐MAPK pathway through HGF activation
  of the RTK. (B) Exposure to MEKi in HCT116 and A549 cells decreases the expression
  of CD73. (C) Exposure to EGFR‐TKI in PC9 and MEKi in SKBr3, 4T1, CT26, and MC38
  cells activates p38, which subsequently induces CD73 expression. (D) CD73 produced
  adenosine suppresses the cytotoxicity of both CD8+ and NK cells and induces polarization
  of M2 macrophages. (E) Co‐administration of anti‐CD73 antibodies and MEKis might
  accelerate the recruitment of innate immune cells to control tumor growth. RKT,
  receptor tyrosine kinase and HGF, hepatocyte growth factor.
