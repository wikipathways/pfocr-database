caption: A schematic illustrating the mechanisms involved in the protection of hyperoside
  against oxidative liver stress. Hyperoside was able to down regulate PHLPP2 expression
  in liver cells treated with t-BHP and in CCl4-injured rat liver to induce AKT phosphorylation
  and inactivate GSK-3β (Ser9), and thereby, reduced Fyn phosphorylation, and nuclear
  translocation. The phosphorylation of Nrf2 at S40 site was probably involved in
  Hyp-mediated regulation of Fyn kinase, likely through nuclear translocation for
  HO-1 transcription and translation. The dashed line highlights that this is a strong
  suggestion and has not been completely proven with experiment.
