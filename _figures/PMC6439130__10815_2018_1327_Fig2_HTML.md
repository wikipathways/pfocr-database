caption: Cellular polyamine pathways. ODC catalyzes decarboxylation of L-ornithine
  to produce putrescine [NH2(CH2)4NH2]. Two other enzymes are involved in spermidine
  (spd) synthesis. First, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAM-DC) converts SAM
  to decarboxylated SAM (dcSAM). Spermidine (spm) synthase then transfers an amino
  propyl radical (NH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-) from dcSAM to putrescine to produce spermidine
  [NH2(CH2)3NH(CH2)4NH2]. Similarly, spermine synthase transfers an amino propyl radical
  from dcSAM to spermidine to produce spermine [NH2(CH2)3NH(CH2)4NH-(CH2)3NH2]. In
  the catabolic pathway, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) first converts
  spermine to N1, N12-diacetylspermine, which is then oxidized to spermidine by polyamine
  oxidase (PAO). Similarly, SSAT converts spermidine to N1-acetylspermidine, which
  is then oxidized to putrescine by PAO. The two rate-limiting enzymes in (forward)
  polyamine synthesis are in bold
