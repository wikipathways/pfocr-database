caption: Proposed mechanism for the role of sEVs in APS pathogenesis. Proposed mechanism
  for sEVs-derived miRNA in APS pathogenesis. Activated platelet release sEVs that
  are going into endothelial and monocyte cells. Inside sEVs there is an upregulation
  of miR-483-3p and a downregulation of miR-326. In endothelial cells, miR-483-3p
  targets PTEN inducing an upregulation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR and NF-ҡB pathway producing
  endothelial proliferation and dysfunction with high levels of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, END-1
  and tissue factor. Low levels of miR-326 provoke a monocyte activation by the upregulation
  of its target gene (NOTCH1) and co-stimulatory factors (CD80). Inflammatory response
  regulated also by NF-ҡB pathway increase in cytokines production (MCP-1 and IL-12)
  and procoagulant factors (tissue factor).
