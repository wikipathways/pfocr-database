caption: Type I IFN synthesis pathway and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  Virus-responsive induction of the IFN-β promoter is directed by cytoplasmic helicases
  RIG-I and MDA5 []. Intracellular RNA pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs;
  e.g., dsRNA) are recognized by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs; e.g.,
  RIG-I, MDA5, TLR3), triggering antiviral signalling cascades. Activation of two
  signalling kinases TBK-1 and IKK-ε results in phosphorylation and activation of
  latent IRF-3 transcription factor that is subsequently translocated to the nucleus
  upon dimerization [,]. IRF-3 binds to p300 and CBP to form the DRAF1 transcription
  complex for IFN-β production. Cytoplasmic V protein is known to inhibit TBK-1 driven
  activation of IRF-3, whereas W protein successfully inhibits both TBK-1 and IKK-ε
  driven activation of IRF-3, with significant effects on TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing
  interferon β (TRIF)-mediated activation [].
