caption: 'Fatty acid remodeling of membrane phospholipid (compartment A). The existing
  fatty acids at the SN2 position of a phospholipid is hydrolyzed by PLA2, generating
  a lysophospholipid molecule. Lysophospholipid serves as an acceptor of a new PUFA
  (usually arachidonic acid) to synthesize remodeled arachidonoyl-phospholipid catalyzed
  by acyl-CoA transferase enzymes. In the next step, arachidonoyl-phospholipid undergoes
  deacylation reaction (by PLA2) releasing free arachidonic acid. Free arachidonic
  acid acts as a substrate of COX and LOX enzymes of eicosanoid pathway (compartment
  B) and synthesizes PGs, TXA2, LTs and HETE/HPETE molecules. Compartment B: (1) arachidonic
  acid can be utilized by cytochrome P450 enzymes to synthesize HETEs, HPETEs and
  epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). (2) COX-1/COX-2 enzymes converts arachidonic acid
  to PGH2 and then to other PGs facilitated by 12-LOX and 15-LOX as shown in step
  4; (3) 5-LOX converts arachidonic acid to various LTs. (5) 15-, 12- and 8-HPETEs
  are synthesized from arachidonic acid by the help of 12- and 15-LOX enzymes. PLA2,
  phospholipase A2; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; PG, prostaglandin; TXA2, thromboxane
  A2, LT, leukotriene; HETE, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids; HPETE, hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic
  acids; COX, cycooxygenase; LOX, lipooxygenase.'
