caption: Endocytosis regulates Wnt signaling. Upon activation of the Wnt pathway,
  the signalosome (formed by the ligand–receptor complex, and associated proteins)
  is rapidly internalized through caveolar endocytosis. Early endosome (EE) vesicles
  containing the signalosome fuse and mature into multivesicular bodies (MVB), dragging
  GSK3 and Axin into the intraluminal vesicles of the MVB. Several endosomal proteins,
  such as the ESCRT machinery (including HRS and VPS4), are required for this process.
  Prmt1 and arginine methylation are also key regulators of GSK3 sequestration into
  MVBs. On the other hand, endocytosis can also be utilized to dampen Wnt signal.
  An example is Dkk1 binding to Lrp6 and the transmembrane protein Kremen, which promote
  Lrp6 clearance from the plasma membrane through clathrin‐mediated endocytosis. Wnt
  can also mediate nutrient uptake, by regulating macropinocytosis. GSK3 and Axin
  normally repress micropinocytosis; however, when Wnt signaling is turned on, their
  sequestration into MVBs allows for sustained macropinocytic activity
