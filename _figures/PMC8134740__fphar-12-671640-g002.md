caption: Alcohol metabolism in the liver. Three pathways are involved in alcohol metabolism
  and all of them converge on the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde
  is further converted to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase in the mitochondria. Acetate
  can be rapidly oxidized into CO2 and H2O by peripheral tissues, or can be diverted
  to the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) pathway. The oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde
  by microsomal ethanol oxidation system (MEOS) occurs in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum
  and changes the NADPH/NADP ratio which in turn influences the regeneration of glutathione
  thereby increasing cellular oxidative stress. The alcohol dehydrogenase pathway
  is the major pathway and occurs in the cytosol, generating large amounts of NADH.
  NADH in turn inhibits TCA cycle enzymes and leads to accumulation of acetyl CoA
  and increase in ketone body generation and acidosis. NADH also inhibits fatty acid
  oxidation leading to accumulation of fats and causing “fatty liver.” A combination
  of the above factors leads to tissue injury and activation of the fibrogenic pathway.
