caption: Working model for the role of the miR-29 family in TGF-β2–mediated signaling.
  TGF-β2 stimulation activates SMAD3 signaling, which is necessary for both miR-29b
  expression and ECM induction by TGF-β2. Concurrently, TGF-β2 suppresses miR-29b
  levels by an unidentified molecular pathway dominant over that mediated by SMAD3
  signaling. TGF-β2 stimulation also results in the induction of miR-29a expression.
  Together, the miR-29 family functions as an important modulator of ECM synthesis
  by TGF-β2.
