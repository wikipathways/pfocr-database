caption: Genetic alterations leading to HIF activation in GB. Activation of the Epidermal
  Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) by EGFR gene mutation (e.g., EGFRvIII) and/or amplification
  frequently occurs in GB cells resulting in activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  with the subsequent accumulation of HIF-1α levels. The tumor suppressor Phosphatase
  and Tensin homolog (PTEN) gene is deleted in 20–40% of GBs. PTEN is the main inhibitor
  of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Consequently, loss of PTEN will also lead to
  accumulation of HIF-1α via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Loss of p53 inhibits MDM2-mediated
  ubiquitination of HIF-1α leading to its accumulation and increased HIF activity
  in GB cells.
