caption: 'a, Brainstem/hypothalamic mechanisms of state control simultaneously modulate:
  pupil diameter, through the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and the Edinger-Westphal
  (EW) nucleus; activity within the central auditory pathway, including the medial
  geniculate nucleus (MG) and primary auditory cortex (A1); and the animal’s behavior.
  b, Relationship between state, behavioral performance, and auditory neural responsiveness.
  When pupil size is small, cortical slow frequency oscillations are prominent (slow
  waves), resulting in low gain, low reliability of sound-evoked neuronal responses
  in the auditory cortex, and thus poor performance on the auditory detection task
  (low percent correct choices, frequent misses, variable latency behavioral responses).
  Moderate arousal (quiet, alert) is associated with a suppression of slow wave activity
  and an increase in the gain and reliability of auditory cortical evoked neuronal
  responses. Behavioral performance is optimal, with short latency, correct choices,
  and less variability. The hyper-aroused state (with or without walking), is associated
  with further ACtx neuronal depolarization, the appearance of fast as well as arrhythmic
  synaptic activity, and a decrease in MG evoked responses. Together, these effects
  result in decreased amplitude and reliability of ACtx sound evoked responses, and
  this is also reflected by diminished behavioral accuracy, with increased false alarms,
  misses, and more variable and longer response latencies.'
