caption: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and TLR 7/8 recognize SARS-CoV-2 RNA and initiate
  the inflammatory cascade via type I and type II IFN gene expression and NF-κB nuclear
  translocation [,]. Via NF-κB, the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory genes
  is stimulated, including pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, TNF and IL-6 []. The virus is also
  recognized by cytoplasmic NLRP3, which forms, together with ASC and caspase-1 (Casp-1),
  the inflammasome complex that will cleave and release mature forms of IL-1β and
  IL-18 []. The cytokines IL-1β, IL-18 and TNF bind to specific receptors and promote
  further NF-κB nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which will
  lead to great expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [,]. IL-6,
  an important player in COVID-19, binds IL-6R and gp130 receptors to activate JAK/STAT-3
  pathway and then contribute to the CRS observed in COVID-19 patients [].
