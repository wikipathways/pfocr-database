caption: 'Overview of mechanism of Inflammasome signaling pathway. NLRP3 and AIM2
  inflammasome activation requires two distinct signals: Signal 1 (priming signal,
  left) is induced by the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
  or endogenous cytokines by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) or cytokine receptors (IL-1R,
  TNFR, IFNAR) and thus leading to increased transcription of NLRP3, ASC, pro-IL-1β,
  pro-IL-18 and pro-caspase-11 through activation of NF-κB. Signal 2 (activation signal,
  right) for the NLRP3 inflammasome is triggered by various stimuli such as potassium
  (K+) efflux, chloride (Cl-) efflux, calcium (Ca+2) influx, oxidized mitochondrial
  DNA (ox-mtDNA), lysosomal rupture and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  production. All these triggers lead to oligomerization and assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome
  complex. AIM2 directly recognizes either DNA released from Gram negative bacteria
  or mtDNA released from mitochondria and lead to assembly of AIM2 inflammasome complex.
  Activated inflammasome complexes (NLRP3 or AIM2) recruit and cleave pro-caspase-1
  to active caspase-1 that further results in the proteolytic cleavage of pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18 to the mature forms IL-1β and IL-18. Caspase-1 also cleaves gasdermin
  D (GSDMD) to its pore-forming N-terminal fragment GSDMD-N which results in pyroptosis.
  Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) by unknown mechanism as indicated by “?” oligomerizes and forms
  a pore to facilitate release of LDH, HMGB1 and the accumulation of these pores ultimately
  led to plasma membrane rupture which is not achieved by the GSDMD-N pores. Post-translational
  modifications (PTM) of cytosolic sensors (NLRP3/AIM2) and adaptor protein (ASC)
  regulate the activity of inflammasome. Gram negative bacteria are lysed to releases
  LPS and DNA via a mechanism requiring various interferon-inducible Guanylate-binding
  proteins (GBPs) and IRGB10. The LPS binds to pro-caspase-11 to initiate autocleavage
  into active caspase-11 which further cleaves GSDMD to GSDMD-N and results in pyroptosis
  (indicated as Non-Canonical NLRP3 inflammasome) and increased efflux of K+, thus
  further activating the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathway (dashed lines = indirect
  interaction; solid lines = direct interaction; arrowhead = activation). Created
