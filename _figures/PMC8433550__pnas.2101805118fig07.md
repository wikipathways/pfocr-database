caption: SI3 states during RNA chain elongation and pausing aid transcription. In
  an active posttranslocated EC with an unfolded TL (NAC, Top Left), SI3 docks on
  the jaw domain, but thermal fluctuation enables SI3 to sample among different positions.
  In this state, the secondary channel (2° channel) is open and can admit NTPs or
  regulators. Binding of cognate NTP then stabilizes the folded TH with SI3 shifted
  in the closed position. In this location, SI3 will clear the secondary channel of
  regulators and, together with the TH, close the active site to catalyze nucleotide
  addition. After nucleotide addition, the EC either undergoes translocation with
  PPi release, TL unfolding, and SI3 movement back to the open position or undergoes
  a transition to the elemental paused state. In response to RNA–DNA sequences, the
  ePEC can either isomerize back to the elongation pathway (back to the NAC) or convert
  to either a backtracked PEC (not shown) or a hsPEC.

  description: SI3 states during RNA chain elongation and pausing aid transcription.
    In an active posttranslocated EC with an unfolded TL (NAC, Top Left), SI3 docks
    on the jaw domain, but thermal fluctuation enables SI3 to sample among different
    positions. In this state, the secondary channel (2° channel) is open and can admit

    SI3 shifted in the closed position. In this location, SI3 will clear the secondary
    channel of regulators and, together with the TH, close the active site to catalyze
    nucleotide addition. After nucleotide addition, the EC either undergoes translocation
    with PPi release, TL unfolding, and SI3 movement back to the open position or
    undergoes a transition to the elemental paused state. In response to RNA–DNA sequences,
    the ePEC can either isomerize back to the elongation pathway (back to the NAC)
