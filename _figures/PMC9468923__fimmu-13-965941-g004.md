caption: mTOR, an important molecule involved in the development of SLE by AhR. In
  this figure, we only show the possible association between themTOR and AhR pathways
  and their effects on SLE. AhR can reduce acetyl coenzyme A levels and thus have
  an effect onmTORC1-induced glycolysis. mTORC1-induced glycolysis is also inhibited
  by PP2A, which has a negative crosstalk with mTORC1 and is a regulator of AhR. AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) is regulated by ATP/ADP or AMP/ATP ratio in the cell. Activated
  AMPK inhibits the activity of mTORC1 (). AMPK is also regulated by AhR-driven degradation
  of Synphilin-1, which can reduce AMPK production (). So PP2A and AMPK may be importantmolecules
  linking mTOR to AhR. PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is one of the upstream pathways regulating
  mTOR, and AhR enhances the activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, thus promoting
  cell survival. Kyn itself has a powerful pro-inflammatory effect and can induce
  SLE development by activating AhR. Moreover, Kyn activation ofmTOR is also involved
  in the development of SLE, a process accompanied by production of cytokines such
  as IL-4, IL-17, IFN-γ, and increased T-cell metabolism. Treatment with NAC inhibits
  mTOR activation and significantly reduces Kyn levels in SLE patients. PP2A, protein
  phosphatase 2A; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase;
  Akt, autologous tumor killing; NAC, N-acetylcysteine.
