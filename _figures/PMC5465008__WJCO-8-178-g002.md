caption: 'Potential crosstalk between leptin signaling, cancer stem cells, histone
  deacetylases and microRNA. Leptin and its receptor LEPR (OB-R) are involved in the
  regulation of PCSC markers, Classical HDAC, miR21, and miR200a/b/c. HDAC 1, 2, 3,
  8: Histone Deacetylases Class I; HDAC 4, 5, 7, 9: Histone Deacetylases Class IIA;
  HDAC 6,10: Histone Deacetylases Class IIB; HDAC11: Histone Deacetylase Class IV.
  MiR200a, miR200b, and miR200c: Tumor Suppressors MicroRNA; MiR21: Oncogenic MicroRNA.
  CD24, CD44, ALDH1A1, ABCB1, MET, and EPCAM: Pancreatic Cancer Stem Cell Markers.
  HGF: Hepatocyte growth factor cytokine; LEP: Leptin adipokine; LEPR: Leptin receptor.
  Data generated from Pathway Studio (Pathway Studio – web; Ariadne Genomics, Inc.).
  Genes were analyzed by Pathway Studio 11 software (Elsevier, Inc., Atlanta, GA,
  United States) for disease, cellular processes and miRNA interactions. Only genes
  that had a P value of 0.05 were reported in this study. Specific references supporting
  these relationships are shown in Supplemental Table . References found by Pathway
  Studio were exported into an Excel file, column D, that contains the PMID number
  for the citations.'
