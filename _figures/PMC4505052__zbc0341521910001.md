caption: A schematic diagram showing the proposed mechanisms involved in transferring
  PUFAs from PC into TAG. The Kennedy pathway for TAG synthesis is indicated by white
  arrows, and acyl transfer reactions are shown in dashed lines. The transfer of PUFAs
  from PC into TAG catalyzed by coupled reactions of the LPCAT-catalyzed reverse reaction
  and the DGAT-catalyzed reaction is highlighted in black bold. ACS, acyl-CoA synthetase;
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FAX1, fatty acid export 1; FFA, free fatty acid; G3P,
  glycerol-3-phosphate; GPAT, acyl-CoA:glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; LPA,
  lysophosphatidic acid; LPAAT, acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase; PAP,
  phosphatidic acid phosphatase; PDCT, phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase;
  PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D.
