caption: 'A simplified scheme highlighting tested ways to increase photosynthesis
  and crop yield by overexpressing selected Calvin cycle enzymes and by creating synthetic
  chloroplastic photorespiratory bypasses. The enzymes in green circles/squares have
  been overexpressing either individually or together. Details of the different photorespiratory
  pathways can be found in the main text: 1 is based on the bacterial glycerate pathway
  leading to 3-PGA from glycolate (; ), 2 is an incomplete glycerate pathway leading
  to glyoxylate from glycolate (), 3 are pathways leading to the production of CO2
  from glycolate (; ; ). The transporter in the red circle was repressed to improve
  photorespiratory bypasses (see ). Abbreviations can be found in the main text.'
