caption: Shown is the situation for mating type a haploid yeast cells. Cells normally
  express the α-factor receptor Ste2p – Frizzled receptors are introduced by ectopic
  expression. Ste2p activation through its ligand α-factor leads to GDP-GTP exchange
  in the Gα protein Gpa1p, and dissociation of the heterotrimeric G protein. The resulting
  free βγ subunits trigger activation of a MAP kinase cascade leading to the transcription
  of pheromone-responsive genes such as FUS1, as well as to G1 growth arrest via inhibition
  of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor FAR1 gene product. A mating pathway activation
  growth assay using wildtype yeast cells (MH272-1da) is shown bottom left. The strain
  was spotted in serial dilutions (∼1E4, 1E3, 1E2, 1E1 cells in duplicate) onto complete
  minimal medium, and treated with 1 µg α-factor spotted directly onto the yeast patches
  as indicated.
