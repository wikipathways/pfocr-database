caption: Model hypothesizing the potential regulation of β-catenin by G-alpha subunits
  and PMT. The classical G-protein targets for G12/13 (cadherins and Rho/ROCK) and
  Gq/11 (Rho/ROCK and calpain) proteins and their stimulation of active β-catenin
  are indicated. (A) Regulation of β-catenin by PMT-modified G-alpha subunits. LiCl
  stimulates β-catenin signaling through inhibition of GSK. Proposed PMT-stimulated
  pathways are indicated in red. PMT-modified G-proteins (Q > E) enhance LiCl stimulation
  of active β-catenin levels (red arrows). This effect could be mediated through the
  known interactions between G-alpha subunits and either GSK3 or the RGS sequence
  in axin2. PMT might also affect G-protein interactions with cadherins and Rho/ROCK
  to induce β-catenin (red dashed arrows). Our data suggest that the Gq-calpain pathway
  is not involved in PMT action (black dashed arrows). (B) Complete deletion of G-alpha
  subunits results in significant enhancement of β-catenin signaling in the absence
  of LiCl treatment (boldface black arrows), compromising cell viability (red dagger).
  PMT treatment (Q > E) of cells with transient knockdown (KD) of G12 and G13 (shaded)
  results in decreased β-catenin levels only via the Wnt destruction complex. See
  the text for details.
