caption: UPS presynaptic pathways. UPS pathways regulate presynaptic differentiation
  and neurotransmission strength. In Drosophila and C. elegans, the large E3 ligase
  Highwire/Rpm-1 operates as part of a unique SCF complex that includes the F-box
  protein FSN-1/DsFn, which targets the MAPKKK Wallenda/DLK and regulates synaptic
  growth via JNK MAPK or p38 MAPK signaling, respectively. In C. elegans, Rpm-1 regulates
  axon termination through a separate incompletely characterized pathway. In Drosophila,
  Highwire also regulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release, as does targeted ubiquitination
  of dUNC-13, a synaptic vesicle priming protein. The APC E3 ligase complex operates
  presynaptically to regulate synaptic growth by targeting Liprin-α.
