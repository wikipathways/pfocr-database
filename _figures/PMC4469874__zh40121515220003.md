caption: Signaling pathway triggered by myocardial stretch leading to Anrep Effect
  or slow force response (SFR). To better appreciate the development of the SFR after
  the initial increase in force following myocardial stretch, an original force record
  of an isolated papillary muscle stretched suddenly from 92% to 98% of its maximal
  length is included at the bottom of the figure. ET, endothelin; ALD, aldosterone;
  TSA, transactivation; mKATP, mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel; MPTP,
  mitochondrial permeability transition pore; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor;
  MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; NCX, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. See text for details and
  other abbreviations.
