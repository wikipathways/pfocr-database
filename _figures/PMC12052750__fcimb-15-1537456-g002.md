caption: The role of gut microbiome imbalance in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 induces gut
  dysbiosis by disrupting the balance between beneficial bacteria (which protects
  the gut) and pathogenic bacteria (which promotes inflammation). The virus uses the
  Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on intestinal epithelial cells to
  enter, causing downstream effects that impair gut integrity and immune function.
  Inside epithelial cells, viral proteins increase Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS),
  triggering oxidative stress and activating the transcription factors nuclear factor
  Kappa B Cells (NF-κB) and Tumor Protein 53 (p53). These pathways promote inflammation
  and cell damage. At the same time, the gut’s tight junction proteins, such as Junctional
  Adhesion Molecule (JAM), Occludin, and Claudin, are disrupted, leading to the breakdown
  of the intestinal barrier. The dysbiotic environment allows Lipopolysaccharides
  (LPS), a component of pathogenic bacteria, to activate Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs)
  on epithelial cells. This degrades Inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB), further stimulating
  NF-κB and resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as Interleukin-6
  (IL-6), IL-1, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). These cytokines contribute
  to a cytokine storm, exacerbating local and systemic inflammation. Additionally,
  SARS-CoV-2 reduces the function of B0AT1 Amino Acid Transporter (BOAT1), impairing
  amino acid absorption and metabolic regulation through the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin
  (mTOR) pathway. The reduced production of Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) weakens
  the gut’s natural defenses, allowing pathogenic bacteria to proliferate
