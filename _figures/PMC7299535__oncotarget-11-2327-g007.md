caption: In malignant prostate epithelium, ARSB increased and GALNS declined, in association
  with increase in CHST15. This pathway may contribute to continuing increases in
  CHST15 and chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S), due to inhibition of SHP2 and activation
  of Wnt signaling through a non-canonical pathway. Noting higher C4S in stroma, with
  higher C6S in normal epithelium, a relative increase in C4S suggests potential for
  epithelial to mesenchymal transition in the epithelium. In the normal epithelium,
  CHST11 expression is less than in stroma and CHST3, leading to C6S, is higher. These
  findings are consistent with the disaccharide analysis showing lower 4S and higher
  6S disaccharides in the prostate epithelial cells. [ARSB = arylsulfatase B; C4S
  = chondroitin 4-sulfate; C6S = chondroitin 6 = sulfate; CHST = chondroitin sulfotransferase;
  DKK = Dickkopf Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor; ERK = extracellular regulated kinase;
  GALNS = N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase; SHP2 = PTPN11 = non-receptor tyrosine
  phosphatase 2].
