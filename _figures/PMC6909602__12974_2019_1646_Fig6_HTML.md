caption: Schematic of the mechanism by which α-synuclein induces the accumulation
  of microglia through CXCL12/CXCR4. Released α-syn establishes a gradient in the
  space between the neurons and the microglia. α-Syn aggregates may bind to the TLR4
  on microglia, eliciting an overexcretion of CXCL12 through TLR4/IκB-α/NF-κB signaling.
  CXCL12 participates in α-synuclein-induced microglial migration through binding
  to CXCR4 through the CXCL12/CXCR4/FAK/Src/Rac1 pathway. As a result, the microglia
  continue to migrate along the concentration gradient of α-syn and CXCL12 toward
  the sources of α-syn
