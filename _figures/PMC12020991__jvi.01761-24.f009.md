caption: The schematic diagram of the molecular mechanism of PEDV hijacking CD4+ T
  cells for migration to the intestinal mucosa. In previous studies, we have preliminarily
  elucidated that PEDV can be transmitted through the air and invade nasal mucosa
  by utilizing submucosal DCs. Subsequently, PEDV-carrying DCs allow the virus to
  be transferred to peripheral blood T cells via the virological synapse. In our present
  study, we discovered that the virus primarily enters CD4+ T cells. Afterward, PEDV
  establishes latent infection in CD4+ T cells and promotes their homing to the small
  intestine by upregulating the expression of the small intestinal homing receptor
  integrin α4β7 on these cells. Furthermore, the virus induces microfilament skeleton
  rearrangement in CD4+ T cells by activating the integrin α4β7-Rho-GTPases-Cofilin
  signaling pathway, facilitating the formation of cellular pseudopodia. This allows
  the cells to migrate through post-capillary venules in lymphatic tissue to the lamina
  propria of the intestinal mucosa and ultimately delivers the virus to intestinal
  epithelial cells
