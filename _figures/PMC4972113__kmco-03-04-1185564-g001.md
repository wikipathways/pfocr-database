caption: 'Mechanisms of tumor responsiveness to statins. Overexpression of the ARF6-AMAP1-EPB41L5
  pathway critically promotes invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance of cancers.
  ARF6 requires RAB11b to be activated at the plasma membrane by receptor tyrosine
  kinases (indicated as Receptors), whereas the mevalonate pathway is essential to
  RAB11b function by mediating its geranylgeranylation by geranylgeranyl transferase-II.
  Mutant p53 proteins, which are known to activate the mevalonate pathway, hence become
  driving forces to promote ARF6-based malignancies. Possible involvement of estrogen
  stimulation in ARF6 activation needs further experimental scrutiny. Proposed surrogate
  markers predictive of statin responders by their combinations are indicated (*;
  combinations are indicated by the same colors). Abbreviations: AMAP1, A Multi-domain
  ARF GAP Protein 1; EPB41L5, Erythrocyte Membrane Protein Band 4.1 Like 5; GGT-II,
  geranylgeranyl transferase-II; HMGCR, HMG-CoA reductase; MVP, mevalonate pathway.'
