caption: Gut microbiota dysbiosis and bacterial metabolites in the gut-liver-kidney
  axis. Gut dysbiosis induces bacterial translocation to the liver, where it promotes
  the release of proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative species, and profibrogenic factors.
  These molecules can enhance the gut dysbiosis and induce kidney damage. Renal dysfunction
  results in the accumulation of uremic toxins, which increase gut dysbiosis and liver
  damage. In contrast, gut dysbiosis promotes an increased release of indoxyl sulfate,
  p-cresol, LPS, and proinflammatory cytokines (due to the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB
  pathway by LPS), which promote kidney damage. Also, gut dysbiosis increases the
  production of TMAO, which can promote further liver damage and trigger kidney dysfunction.
  TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response 88;
  TMAO, trimethylamine N-oxide.
