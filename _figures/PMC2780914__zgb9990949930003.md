caption: Transmigration causes differential expression of genes in the apoptosis pathway.
  Genes belonging to the Negative Regulation of Apoptosis functional group were mapped
  to the apoptosis pathway. Apoptosis is shown at the bottom of the pathway. Caspase
  3 and caspase 9 are key enzymes in promoting apoptosis by activation through enzymatic
  cleavage of a number of proteins that control apoptotic functions, such as chromatin
  condensation, DNA fragmentation, and membrane blebbing. Both of these caspase genes
  are inhibited by NAIP, which is up-regulated in transmigrated monocytes compared
  with untreated monocytes, as indicated by the gray shading. Various intracellular
  and extracellular signaling pathways are involved in expression and inhibition of
  caspase 3, caspase 9, and NAIP. FasL, Fas ligand; ICAD, inhibitor CAD; ROCK1, Rho-associated
  coiled-coil protein kinase 1; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.
