caption: Contrast inflammatory signals in human gingival fibroblasts triggered by
  the different acylation structures of P. gingivalis LPS and E. coli LPS. P.g-LPS1690
  upregulates the expression of IL-6 and IL-8, mainly via the MD-2/TLR4-NF-κB pathway.
  This process seemed to mimic hexa-acylated E. coli-LPS. Both P.g LPS1435/1449 and
  LPS1690 stimulate increased expression of TLR2, but E. coli LPS did not trigger
  TLR2. P.g-LPS1435/1449 primarily induced the p38/MAPK signaling pathway with little
  sensitization of the NF-κB pathway.
