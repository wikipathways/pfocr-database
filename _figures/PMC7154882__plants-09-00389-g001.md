caption: Pathogen-induced dynamics within the plant endomembrane system. (A) Different
  proteins and metabolites relevant for plant defense (green) can be secreted into
  the apoplast via the secretory pathway. Pathogen detection and signaling depends
  on the endocytosis of pattern recognition receptors (blue). (B) Pathogens have evolved
  effectors (red) to efficiently inhibit conventional trafficking routes and thus,
  functional plant defense. Upon pathogen attack, plants use unconventional trafficking
  pathways (dashed arrows) such as multivesicular bodies (MVB)/ late endosomes (LE)
  fusion with the plasma membrane (PM) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) body formation
  for compensation.
