caption: 'Model: FGFR blockade reverses T cell exclusion and ICT resistance by modulating
  CAFs. Blocking FGFR by FGFR inhibitor (FGFRi) suppresses the activation of MAPK/ERK
  signaling pathway in CAFs, thereby inhibiting the proliferation, migration and secretion
  of VCAM-1 of CAFs, leading to the breakage of physical and chemical barriers built
  by CAFs to prevent T cell infiltration. Notably, FGFRi improves ICT efficacy by
  increasing the infiltration of anti-tumor immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and
  M1 macrophages, inhibiting the infiltration of pro-tumor immune cells such as MDSC
  and M2 macrophages, and enhancing anti-tumor activity of CTLs in tumors.'
