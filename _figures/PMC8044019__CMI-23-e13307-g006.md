caption: Schematic depicting the involvement of Ire1 in circumventing multiple stresses
  in C. albicans. Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  lumen, caused by tunicamycin‐induced ER stress, results in the activation of the
  canonical unfolded protein response (UPR) branch via Ire1. This protein kinase also
  responds to membrane stress, generated by depleting the growth medium of inositol,
  to activate the UPR via processing of HAC1 umRNA. Ire1 mediates the splicing of
  pre‐mRNA (HAC1 u) to mature mRNA (HAC1 i) by virtue of its endoribonuclease activity.
  The spliced HAC1 synthesizes functional Hac1 protein and activates the UPR target
  genes for survival during ER stress. Processing of HAC1 u mRNA is not necessitated
  in response to other stress stimuli such as cell wall and cell membrane stress,
  though the involvement of the splicing event at longer time points (beyond 5 hr)
  cannot be ruled out (indicated by dotted arrows). ER stress also activates complementary
  signalling pathways such as the cell wall integrity pathway that may operate directly
  or indirectly with the Ire1‐dependent UPR pathway to coordinate cellular responses
  in C. albicans
