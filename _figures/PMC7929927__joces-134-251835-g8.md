caption: Proposed model of BPIFB3–ARFGAP1/TMED9 autophagy control. Given that BPIFB3
  is predicted to be a lipid transfer protein, we propose a model where BPIFB3 functions
  to traffic lipids from the ER, which serves as a major site for cellular lipid synthesis,
  to the Golgi. We propose that ARFGAP1 and TMED9 serve as key regulators of this
  pathway based on their interaction with BPIFB3 and role in regulating BPIFB3 depletion
  dependent autophagy. When BPIFB3 expression is reduced, either by RNAi treatment
  or the undetermined cellular mechanisms used to regulate its expression, lipid trafficking
  is disrupted, which specifically increases the level of autophagy and vesicle trafficking
  out of the ER. Created with BioRender.com.
