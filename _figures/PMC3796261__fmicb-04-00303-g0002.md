caption: The complement of the secretome involved in colonization process in diderm-LPS
  bacteria. Among the 9 distinct secretion systems through which a secreted protein
  can be translocated across the OM in diderm-LPS bacteria, the T1SS, T2SS, T3SS,
  T4SS, T5SS, T7SS, T8SS, and T9SS can be involved in colonization process (depicted
  in red). Translocation machineries depicted in violet are protein export pathway
  participating to the protein transport of effectors involved in colonization process.
  The T1SS can secrete adhesins, which the release into the extracellular milieu (GO:0005576)
  and/or the association to the external side of the OM (GO:0031244) remain to be
  clarified. Besides the secretion of adhesion factors, the T2SS is involved in the
  formation of Type 4 pilus (GO:0044096), i.e., the T2SS subfamily c (T2cSS). The
  subfamily a of the T3SS (T3aSS) can be involved in the formation of pilus structure
  (GO:0009289), i.e., either the injectisome or the Hrp (hypersensitive response and
  pathogenicity) pilus, whereas the subfamily b of the T3SS (T3bSS) is involved in
  flagellum assembly (GO:009288). The T4SS is involved in the formation of pili (GO:0009289),
  either pilus T (T4aSS) or pilus F (T4bSS). The T5SS is involved in the secretion
  of adhesion either integral (GO:0045203) or extrinsic (GO:0031244) to the OM. The
  T7SS (CUP; chaperone-usher pathway) is involved in the formation of Type 1 pilus,
  and the T8SS (ENP; extracellular nucleation-precipitation pathway) in the formation
  of pilus of the type curli. The T9SS (Por secretion system) can secrete adhesins
  involved in gliding motility. In addition, some surface proteins could use systems
  as yet uncovered, the so-called non-classical (NC) secretion. Only branches corresponding
  to the complement of the secretome involved in bacterial colonization are colored.
  Extracytoplasmic proteins, i.e., single proteins and supramolecular protein structures,
  potentially involved in surface colonization are depicted in blue. Orange and yellow
  arrows indicate the routes for proteins targeted to the CM possessing or lacking
  an N-terminal SP, respectively. Violet arrows indicate the routes for exported proteins
  and red arrows for secreted proteins. CP, cytoplasm; IM, inner membrane; PP, periplasm;
  OM, outer membrane; EC, extracellular milieu; SP, signal peptide.
