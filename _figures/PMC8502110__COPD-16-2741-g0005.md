caption: Potential mechanism of GS exerting biological activity. Under physiological
  condition, relatively more miR-361-5p and less miR-196-5p in BECs respective targeting
  bact1 and arhgef12 3ʹUTR result to low BCAT1 and high ARHGEF12 protein expressions.
  In one way, as an enzyme metabolizing BCKAS to BCAAS, low expressed BCAT1 decrease
  BCAAS production, which merely partial activate mTOR-pS6K pathway and slightly promoting
  BECs proliferation. In another way, high expressed ARHGEF12 protein activate and
  subsequently promote ROCK and PTEN expressions, the later inhibit mTOR-pS6K pathway
  and result to anti-proliferation of BECs. In contrast, under COPD condition, the
  levels of miR-361-5p and miR-196-5p are reversed, which cause enhanced BCAAS-mTOR-pS6K
  and weakened RhoA-ROCK-PTEN pathway result to BECs proliferation. The biological
  activities of GS are simultaneously inhibits miR-196-5p and promote miR-361-5p levels
  in order to ameliorate mTOR-pS6K pathway, finally exert anti-proliferation of BECs
  in COPD.
