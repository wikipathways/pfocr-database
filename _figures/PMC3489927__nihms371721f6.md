caption: To confirm the activation of c-Kit signaling by KSHV, a series of kinase
  inhibitors were utilized. The diagram (A) depicts the c-Kit kinase-signaling pathway
  and where each inhibitor acts (modified from ()). A p-Erk 1/2 immunoblot was performed
  on KSHV-infected cells pre-incubated with the indicated kinase inhibitors prior
  to 10 minutes of SCF stimulation (B, top blot). The blot was stripped and reprobed
  with antibodies to Erk 1/2 to measure total protein levels (B, bottom blot). The
  concentration (μM) of inhibitor is indicated above the blots.
