caption: Downstream signaling and effect of immune checkpoint ligands PD-L1/2, CD80/86
  and MHC-II in APCs. PD-1/PD-L1/2 interaction results in inhibition of apoptosis
  by interference with the IFN induced STAT3/CASP7 pathway. Blocking of this pathway
  by anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1/2 leads to less inhibition of the STAT3/CASP7 pathway
  and therefore increased apoptotic signaling in the presence of IFN signaling. CTLA-4/CD80/86
  binding increases self-tolerance by inducing tryptophane catalyzation. Blocking
  of CTLA-4 leads to reduced tryptophane catalyzation and reduced self-tolerance.
  MHC-II/LAG-3 binding results in activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway leading to an
  increase in survival signals. Therefore, blocking LAG-3 results in less PI3K/Akt
  activation and a reduction in survival signals. CTLA-4, Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated
  Protein four; FGL1, fibrinogen-like protein one; Gal3, Galectin three; IFN, Interferon;
  LSECtin, liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin; LAG-3, Lymphocyte Activation
  Gene-3; MHC-II, major histocompatibility complex II; PD-1, programmed cell death-1;
  PD-L1/2, programmed cell death-ligand 1/2. Created with BioRender.com.
