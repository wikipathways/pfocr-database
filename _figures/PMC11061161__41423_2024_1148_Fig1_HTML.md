caption: Regulation of T cell activation and subset differentiation and function by
  lipid metabolism. A The length of the fatty acid chain influences CD4 + T cell differentiation.
  Furthermore, Treg cells and Th17 cells employ distinct strategies to obtain fatty
  acids (i.e., importing exogenous fatty acids or synthesizing fatty acids). The IL-6-STAT3
  signaling pathway is expected to play a key role in the decision-making between
  these two strategies. In addition, the sterol supply not only provides essential
  substrates for T cell clonal expansion but also modulates Th17 differentiation through
  the LXR pathway. B Fatty acid oxidation promotes memory CD8 + T cell formation.
  The AA-PGE2 pathway suppresses CD8 + T cell effector function. Endogenous cholesterol
  synthesis supports CD8 + T cell activation and proliferation. Supplementation with
  cholesterol rescues CD8 + T cell proliferation with defects in cholesterol synthesis.
