caption: In fibroblasts, Nod2 senses bacteria at the plasma membrane and recruits
  the autophagic machinery through direct interaction with ATG16L1. This leads to
  the autophagy-dependent elimination of the bacteria after fusion of bacteria-containing
  autophagosomes with degradative lysosomal compartments. The CD-associated variant
  Nod2 1007fs cannot detect bacteria at the plasma membrane resulting in a defect
  in the recruitment of ATG16L1 and the autophagic response. While the CD-associated
  variant ATG16L1*300A can be recruited at the membrane by Nod2, it further negatively
  affects the autophagic pathway. In parallel, Nod2 activation induces an inflammatory
  response to bacterial invasion through the classical RIP2/NFκB pathway that is dispensable
  for Nod2 autophagy at the membrane.
