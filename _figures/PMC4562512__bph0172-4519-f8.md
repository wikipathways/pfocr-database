caption: Scheme illustrating the effects of γ-oryzanol on pancreatic islets in mice.
  In pancreatic islets and beta cells, γ-oryzanol suppresses D2 receptor signalling,
  at least partly via the inhibition of local dopamine synthesis, leading to an increase
  in the intracellular cAMP level. Consequently, GSIS is augmented via the cAMP/PKA
  pathway (amplifying pathway). On the other hand, γ-oryzanol ameliorates exaggerated
  secretion of glucagon from pancreatic α-cells, not via the direct action on α-cells,
  but presumably via some intra-islet paracrine factors.
