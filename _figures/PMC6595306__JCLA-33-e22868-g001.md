caption: Purine metabolic pathway. Purine bases derived from tissue Nucleic acids
  are reused through the salvage pathway. The enzyme hypoxanthine‐guanine phosphoribosyl
  transferase (HGPRT) salvages hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and guanine
  to guanosine monophosphate (GMP). In a similar salvage pathway, adenine phosphoribosyl
  transferase (APRT) converts adenine to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). A small portion
  of urate overproduction owing to HGPRT deficiency and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate
  (PRPP) synthetase (PRPPS) superactivity. Futhermore, the net degradation of ATP
  result in the accumulation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate
  (AMP), which can be rapidly degraded to uric acid. Xanthine oxidase (XO) is the
  enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine, and xanthine to
  uric acid
