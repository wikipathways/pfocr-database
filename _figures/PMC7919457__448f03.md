caption: Gene fusions in pancreatic cancer. Overview of proteins in the MAPK signaling
  pathway found to be fused in pancreatic tumors. Colored proteins were fused to one
  of the genes listed in the callouts. Proteins shown in gray were not found to be
  fused. The frequencies of recurrent fusion partners are indicated in parentheses.
  The detailed structure of all fusions is depicted in Supplemental Figure S6.
