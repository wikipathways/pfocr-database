caption: Modes of cell death in NASH. Apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis have all
  been described in NASH. Apoptosis, which can be demonstrated by caspase 3/7 activation,
  is triggered through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in NASH. Lysosomal dysfunction
  and ER stress are involved in the initiation of intrinsic pathway. In addition,
  caspase 2 is increased in NASH, whereas caspase 9 level is reduced in ballooned
  hepatocytes. In the extrinsic pathway, death receptor 5, apoptosis antigen 1 (Fas)
  and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1) are increased in NASH leading to activation
  of caspase 8 and induction of apoptosis. Necroptosis is characterized as a mixed
  lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL) related pore formation in the plasma
  membrane. It is induced by Receptor-Interacting Protein 3 (RIP3) and RIP1. Caspase
  8 inhibits RIP3 activation. Pyroptosis is characterized as gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediated
  pore formation in the plasma membrane. Its activation is accompanied by inflammasome
  formation, which involves the maturation of caspase 1, IL-1β and NLRP3. Arrows (red)
  indicate the up- or down-expressions of specific proteins in NAFLD. IL-1β interleukin-1β,
  NLRP3 NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3
