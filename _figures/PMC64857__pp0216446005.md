caption: A possible BR biosynthetic and signaling  pathway in zinnia cell culture.
  BRs are synthesized via two parallel  branched pathways during stage II of tracheary
  element differentiation.  Uniconazole may inhibit the step of 22α-hydroxylation.
  Among BRs,  6-DeoxoBRs are mostly accumulated within the cell but 6-OxoBRs are  preferentially
  secreted out of the cell. The secreted active BRs may  bind to a BRI1-like receptor
  on the plasma membrane of the cells that  are secreting BRs (autocrine) and/or that
  are not secreting BRs  (paracrine), and induce the initiation of stage III in which
  secondary  wall formation and cell death occur. Yellow circles indicate the levels  of
  BRs semiquantitatively.
