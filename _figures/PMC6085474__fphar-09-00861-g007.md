caption: The crucial molecules and regulatory pathways of ERBB2+ GC. The main regulatory
  pathway is NRG2-ERBB2-MYC, which is cross-interfaced with RARA-MYC pathway. For
  ERBB2+ GC, beyond ERBB2 itself, RARA and NRG2 are potential drug sensitive biomarkers
  too for predicting response to ERBB2-targeted therapy. Combination of NRG2 antagonist
  or RARA agonist with ERBB2-targeted drug may be effective regimens for ERBB2+ GC.
