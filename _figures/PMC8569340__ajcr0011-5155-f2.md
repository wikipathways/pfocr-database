caption: Akt inhibition compared with Her2/EGFR-targeted therapy in breast cancer
  cells. The mechanisms of actions of different drugs targeting Her2+ breast cancer
  cells. Akt interconnects different cellular organelles to hijack cellar metabolism,
  forcefully alters the TME, and promotes breast cancer progression and metastasis.
  T-DM1, a monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab) conjugated with a small molecule (DM1),
  is an innovative drug against Her2+ breast cancer, which targets both Her2 signalling
  and tubulin polymerization. However, internalized DM1 can still be targeted by MDRs
  and GSH/ROS-mediated recycling systems. Direct targeting of Akt in combination with
  common chemotherapy reverses resistance to chemotherapy. MK-2206, ipatasertib, capivasertib,
  and uprosertib are well-studied Akt inhibitors.
