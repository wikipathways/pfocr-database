caption: Proposed schematic of NAA synthesis in neuronal mitochondria. Dashed lines
  show α-ketoglutarate pathway through GDH that is bypassed by synthesis through AAT.
  As more pyruvate enters the cycle NAA synthesis is increased, aspartate export from
  mitochondria is decreased and NAA export is increased. See text for details. AAT,
  aspartate amino-transferase (also known as glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase);
  Asp-NAT, aspartate N-acetyltransferase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; NH3, ammonia.
