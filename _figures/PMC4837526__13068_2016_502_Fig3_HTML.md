caption: Metabolic distribution of reducing power [H] in B. subtilis mutants. The
  arrows represent the delivery of the [H] in NADH, and the dashed arrows represent
  the creation of the [H]. The acetoin synthesis and breakdown pathway are indicated
  in the oval frame. Overexpressed genes are underlined. Disrupted pathway steps ar
  indicated by broken arrows
