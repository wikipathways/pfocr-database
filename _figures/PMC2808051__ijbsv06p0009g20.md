caption: Reversible phosphorylation regulation of the cell cycle. Cyclin/CDK complexes
  may be inactivated through phosphorylation, mediated by the Wee kinase family. Phosphorylation
  may be reversed by the Cdc-25 phosphatase. This phosphatase may also be inactivated
  through Chk-1 mediated phosphorylation. DNA checkpoint kinases are regulated by
  the ATM kinase, which in turn may receive signals from DNA damage and the insulin
  response pathway. The Akt kinase of the insulin signaling pathway, phosphorylates
  numerous cell cycle targets, including Cip/Kips and GSK-3 (which targets cyclin
  D).
