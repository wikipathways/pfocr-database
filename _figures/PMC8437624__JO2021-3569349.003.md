caption: Molecular findings, which support the theory that chloroquine and analogues
  exerts, at least in part, antineoplastic effects altering the phosphorylation status
  of EGFR/PI3K/Akt/mTOR/Atg and p53 pathways, inhibiting directly PI3K-Akt and mTOR
  kinases, obstructing catalytic subunits in the ATP-binding site or altering the
  recycling of tyrosine kinase receptors, besides impairing or interfering in lysosomal
  and autophagosome functions. mTOR phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor
  4E-binding protein (4E-BP) and the p70S6 kinase1 (S6K1). Therefore, if specific
  drug inhibitors against mTOR kinase are used, this should not only have altered
  proliferation but also the protein synthesis rate. Vesicular protein sorting 34
  (Vps34) complex I has Atg14p as an additional factor, which participates in the
  formation of autophagosomes, while complex II has Vps38, which is required for vacuolar
  protein sorting. These catalytic complexes work as ubiquitin-like conjugation systems
  for phagophore elongation and recruitment of other proteins to the self-digesting
  process, as seen with Vps34, a phosphatidylinositol serine-threonine kinase, its
  binding partner Beclin-1 (Atg6) and the protein kinase p150 in mammals (Vps15).
  Assembly of this complex is crucial for autophagy and it recruits other proteins
  to the phagophore assembly site (PAS). Therefore, the phagophore elongates into
  a cup-shaped structure and begins to engulf cellular material, sequestering the
  material in a double-membraned autophagosome. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine
  block autophagy in initial phases, causing accumulation of acidic vesicle cell markers
  and appear to deactivate upstream members of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  pathway, preventing phosphorylation and activation of extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases (ERK)1/2 by a paradoxical phosphorylation of Raf at specific residues, which
  possibly blocks ERK activation by Akt activity.
