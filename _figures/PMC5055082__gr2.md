caption: 'Cell signalling during Dictyostelium development.(a) The asexual life cycle
  of D. discoideum. (b) Cell signalling mechanisms. The schematic shows the signals
  (in red) that control the life cycle transitions and the differentiation of amoebae
  in spores and somatic cell types. The enzymes that synthesise secreted signal molecules
  are shown in green text, and proteins and small molecules involved in the intracellular
  signal transduction pathway are in blue text. Blue arrows and t-crosses denote stimulatory
  and inhibitory effects, respectively. Double blue arrows signify that no components
  of the signal transduction pathway are known. All pathways are described in detail
  in the main text. Abbreviations: PSF: prestarvation factor; MPBD: 4-methyl-5-pentylbenzene-1,3-diol;
