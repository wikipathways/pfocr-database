caption: Combining PARP inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade. (A) Antitumor immunity
  depends on a series of stepwise events. Primarily this process includes the capture
  and processing of Tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) by Antigen-presenting cells (APCs),
  such as dendritic cells or macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (step 1). Next,
  APCs cells presented antigen to CD8+ T cells at the lymph nodes (step 2). This process
  promotes the prime and activation of effector CD8 T cells (step 3). Finally, the
  activated effector T cells migrate from lymphocytes (step 4) and infiltrate into
  the tumor microenvironment to recognize and eliminate tumor cells (step 5), completing
  the cancer-immune cycle. However, the continued immune attack may enable cancer
  cells to evolve mechanisms for the escape of immune attacks. Molecules that negatively
  regulate T lymphocyte activation, called immune checkpoints are central players
  involved in tumor immune escape. In the cancer-immune cell cycle the ICIs (anti-CTLA-4,
  anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1) reactivate and drive the immune response to detect and
  destroy tumors by overcoming the negative feedback mechanism of the immune response
  acting in steps 3 and 5. (B) Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have
  effects in the early steps of the cancer-immune cell cycle. PARPi induce DNA breaks
  in BRCA1/2-deficient cells which can result in cell death or genomic instability
  and neoantigen formation. Furthermore, the DNA damage induces the release of DNA
  fragments into the cytosol which causes the cGAS/STING pathway activation in tumor
  cells and the production of type I IFN and chemokines (CCL5 and CXCL10). This effect
  culminates with paracrine activation of APCs such as dendritic cells (step 1 and
  2) and with the recruitment of CD8 cells for the tumor microenvironment (step 4).
  Another important immune effect of PARPi is associated with the increased expression
  of Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in tumor cells (step 5). Therefore, the combined
  use of PARPi with Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has the potential to amplify
  the entire cancer immune cycle (image created at Biorender).
