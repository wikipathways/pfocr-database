caption: The strategy of metabolic engineering of the PII(I86N) protein in Synechocystis
  sp. PCC 6803 for arginine/cyanophycin overproduction. The conversion of N-acetylglutamate
  (Ac-Glu) to N-acetylglutamate-phosphate (Ac-Glu-P) is the rate-limiting step in
  the cyclic arginine synthesis pathway and is catalyzed by NAGK. NAGK activity is
  controlled by complex formation with the PII protein, which senses the nitrogen
  status by 2-oxogluterate (2-OG) binding. In the wild-type, unbound NAGK has low
  activity (dashed line) and is highly susceptible to arginine feedback inhibition,
  whereas NAGK bound to the PII protein has high activity (solid black line) and much
  less sensitive towards arginine. The PII(I86N) variant of strain BW86 (in orange
  box) permanently binds to NAGK and strongly increases its activity (solid orange
  line) and relieves arginine feedback inhibition. When excess arginine (Arg) is produced
  cyanophycin is synthesized from arginine and aspartate (Asp in red)
