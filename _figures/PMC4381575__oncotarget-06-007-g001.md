caption: The synthesis of miRNAs via the canonical pathway starts with transcription
  of miRNA genes by RNA polymerase II, which results in primary-miRNAs. These are
  processed by Drosha and DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 (DGCR8), generating
  precursor-miRNAs which are transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 and cleaved
  by Dicer and TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP). The resulting duplex is separated,
  generating mature miRNAs. MiRNAs can also arise from splicing through the non-canonical
  pathway. The designation of miRNAs includes the term “miR” preceding a number attributed
  sequentially. Similar sequences can have the same number but a different suffix
  (number or letter). Letters defining the species are added as prefixes, such as
  hsa for Homo sapiens. Additionally, they can be designated miR-#-3p or miR-#-5p
  depending on which arm of the precursor structure the leading strand is located
  [].
