caption: 'Biochemical strategies for enhanced supply of ATP without the accumulation
  of inorganic phosphate. (A) Conventional methods for ATP regeneration during cell-free
  protein synthesis simply rely on the substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP using
  the energy sources with high-energy phosphate bonds (i.e., phosphoenolpyruvate,
  creatine phosphate, and acetyl phosphate). In this scheme, inorganic phosphate accumulates
  in the reaction mixture in amounts proportional to those of the energy sources.
  (B) Kim and Swartz demonstrated that pyruvate can be used as a phosphate-free energy
  source, in combination with exogenously added pyruvate oxidase []. In their scheme,
  pyruvate and recycled inorganic phosphate produce acetyl phosphate, which is subsequently
  used to regenerate ATP. (C) Generation of acetyl phosphate from pyruvate can also
  be achieved by using the endogenous enzymes in the cell extract. (D) Use of glucose
  to regenerate ATP via glycolytic pathway in the cell extract. (E) Use of maltodextrin
  as a secondary energy source. ADP: adenosine diphosphate; ATP: adenosine triphosphate;
  Pi: inorganic phosphate; NAD: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADH: reduced nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide; GAP: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DPG: 1,3-diphosphoglycerate.'
