caption: Illustration of the major metabolic pathways for the biosynthesis of domoic
  acid (DA). The precursor of the C10 isoprenoid can either arise via the mevalonate
  (MEV) pathway that is located in the cytosol and/or an alternative route in the
  plastid, the methyl-erythritol phosphate metabolic (MEP) pathway. The tricarboxylic
  acid is proposedly derived from l-glutamate. The green arrow indicates where genes
  are upregulated when Pseudo-nitzschia is triggered to produce DA, the assigned enzymes
  are highlighted bold green, number of replicates = 3. Mean fold change (FC) and
  adjusted P values as well EC numbers for the enzymes and are given in Table
papertitle: Transcriptomic responses to grazing reveal the metabolic pathway leading
  to the biosynthesis of domoic acid and highlight different defense strategies in
  diatoms.
