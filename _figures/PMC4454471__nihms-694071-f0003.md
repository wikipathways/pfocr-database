caption: Model for generation of repeat expansions during MMR and BER. (A) Mismatch
  repair (MMR) is initiated when MutSβ (a heterodimer of MSH2/MSH3) binds to and stabilizes
  the hairpin formed by the repetitive DNA element. PCNA loading (facilitated by RFC,
  not shown) also occurs at the extrusion. The interaction between MutSβ and PCNA
  activates the cryptic endonuclease activity of the MutLα complex (a heterodimer
  of MLH1/PMS2). MutLα can nick either strand; here, a nick on the top strand is shown.
  Exo1 exonucleolytic activity digests the end to form a single-stranded gap that
  extends ~150 nt past the hairpin. The hairpin is unwound by helicase activity, potentially
  Sgs1/WRN (see section ‘‘The role of helicases in resolving hairpins during repair
  and fork restart’’), and Polδ fills the gap. The nick is sealed by Lig1. These steps
  are repeated on the other strand to resolve the second hairpin; DNA synthesis through
  the hairpin at this stage leads to an expansion on both strands. Note that after
  nicking, repair could also proceed by strand displacement (indicated by dotted gray
  arrow to part B), leading to an expansion by slippage during replication or inefficient
  flap cleavage by Fen1. (B) BER is initiated to repair 8-oxoG lesions caused by oxidative
  damage. 8-oxoG is first recognized by a DNA glycosylase (Ogg1 or NEIL1). ApeI creates
  a nick, and strand slippage during fill in by Polβ, Polδ, Polε, or Polη can lead
  to an expansion (left pathway). Alternatively, hairpins can impede Fen1 cleavage
  (indicated by dotted Fen1), leading to inefficient or ‘‘alternative’’ flap cleavage
  (indicated by solid Fen1) and expansions (right pathway). A nick on the complementary
  (bottom) strand followed by DNA synthesis through the hairpin leads to an expansion
  on both strands. Alternatively, direct nicking of the hairpin, or oxidative damage
  within the hairpin followed by nicking, could start the BER cycle again, leading
  to further expansions (toxic oxidation cycle, not shown). (see colour version of
  this figure at www.informahealthcare.com/bmg).
