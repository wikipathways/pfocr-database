caption: A medium-complexity representation of the yeast glycolytic pathway (). The
  system consists of eight metabolites and eight reactions. The main regulatory step
  is the phosphofructokinase (PFK), here combined with the hexokinase (HK) reaction
  into the reaction rate ν1. Although PFK is known to have several effectors, we only
  consider the inhibition by its substrate ATP () (see Supporting Appendix for further
  details). Glc, glucose; FBP, fructose-1,6-biphosphate; TP, pool of triosephosphates;
  BPG, 1,3-biphosphoglycerate; Pyr, pool of pyruvate and acetaldehyde; EtOH, ethanol.
  Glc and EtOH are assumed to be the external source and sink, respectively.
