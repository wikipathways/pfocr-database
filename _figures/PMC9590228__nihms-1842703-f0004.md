caption: (a) A regulatory pathway, involving the phosphodiesterase (PDE) RmcA and
  diguanylate cyclase (DGC), links redox cues (in this case, oxidized phenazines)
  to matrix production in wild type (WT, top) and phenazine-deficient (Δphz, bottom)
  P. aeruginosa biofilms. Biofilms shown were grown on medium containing 1% tryptone
  and matrix-staining dyes . (b) Several regulators influence the architecture of
  E. coli colony biofilms. Sigma factors are shaded pink, and activities that modulate
  levels of cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) and thereby affect matrix production are
  shaded cyan. The activities of the regulators are influenced by resource gradients
  and they control pathways with opposing effects on levels of c-di-GMP. This intracellular
  signal promotes production of cellulose, a component of the biofilm matrix. RpoS
  also promotes the synthesis of curli fibers, proteinaceous components of the matrix,
  via c-di-GMP-independent mechanisms. FlhDC is a transcriptional regulator that controls
  production of the sigma factor FliA. Both FlhDC and FliA promote production and
  assembly of flagella, which form a mesh-like structure at the biofilm base (not
  visible in micrograph on the right). Arrows indicate the overall effects of the
  indicated regulators and not direct interactions. Additional regulatory steps, some
  of which have been omitted here for simplicity, are described in detail in . The
  micrograph at the right shows an E. coli biofilm treated with a fluorescent matrix
  stain, reproduced with permission from . Part a provided by M. Smiley.
