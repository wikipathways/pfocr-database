caption: Model for Nrf2-mediated regulation of aging. Nrf2 is a stress-responsive
  transcription factor that regulates expression of multiple protective genes, including
  XMEs. Activation of XMEs may protect cells from damage and could, in principle,
  help delay aging. Nrf2 is negatively regulated by Keap1 protein, which promotes
  rapid turnover of Nrf2 by the proteasome. Keap1 contains multiple cysteine residues,
  which are oxidized under stressful conditions, or by chemical Nrf2 activators, such
  as tBHQ, resulting in conformational changes that release bound Nrf2. Nrf2 can then
  translocate to the nucleus and induce transcription of XMEs through antioxidant
  response elements (ARE) and may also interact with nuclear receptors (NR) or xenobiotic
  response elements (XRE). Nrf2 may also be repressed by GH/IGF-I signaling or the
  target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway. CR and rapamycin treatment may enhance Nrf2 activity
  through attenuation of these signaling pathways.

  of mouse models with extended lifespan.
