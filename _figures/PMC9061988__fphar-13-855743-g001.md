caption: 'Simplified overview of the processes in the complement pathway model for
  plasma and cell surface reactions. Key processes shown here: alternative pathway
  (AP) tickover, regulation by FH and FI in plasma and cell surface, AP surface amplification,
  terminal pathway, and surface regulators: sialic acid, DAF, and CD59. Dynamics for
  binding of complement proteins to Properdin are not included here for simplicity
  and represented separately in . Other key processes included in the model but not
  shown here: dynamics of regulation by CR1, clusterin, and vitronectin.'
