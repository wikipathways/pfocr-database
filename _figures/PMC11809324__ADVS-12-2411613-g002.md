caption: 'Schematic of Treg cell aging and regulatory role of PD‐1 in advanced‐age
  pregnancies. Treg cells exhibit senescent phenotypes in advanced‐age pregnancies
  in humans and mice, which are characterized by increased levels of P16 and ROS,
  SASP, increased expression of PD‐1, and a naïve/memory Treg cell balance that is
  biased to memory Treg cells. The proportion of PD‐1+ Treg cells are positively correlated
  with Treg cells with an aging phenotype (CD28− and HLA‐DR+CD45RA‐Treg cells). The
  ability of aged Treg cells to suppress effector T cells is also decreased. PD‐1
  positively regulates DUSP4 in aged Treg cells, which activates the p38 MAPK signaling
  pathway. The active transfer of young Treg cells or aged Treg cells pretreated with
  α‐PD‐1 mAbs effectively reduces the incidence of abnormal fetuses and improves the
  placental development in a reproductive‐aged mouse model. ROS: intracellular reactive
  oxygen species; SASP: senescence‐associated secretory phenotype; DUSP4: dual specificity
  phosphatase 4; MAPK: mitogen‐activated protein kinase. Figure 7 was generated using
