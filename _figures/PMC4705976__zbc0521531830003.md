caption: Orf306-induced metabolic diversion in MG1655 (pSDP10). Heat maps represent
  differential expression of genes encoding glycolysis, glyoxylate, and TCA cycle
  enzymes at 0, 1.5, and 3.0 h. The green arrows represent down-regulated pathways.
  The up-regulated pathways are shown with red arrows. Up-regulation of the phenylpropionate
  pathway and down-regulation of glycolysis are shown with dotted green and red arrows,
  respectively. Quantitative PCR results showing either an Orf306-dependent decrease
  (pfkA, eno, and acnA) or increase (glcB, glcC, and prpB) in the concentration of
  specific mRNAs are inserted at places showing the corresponding enzyme reactions
  with the error bars representing the S.D. The two-dimensional gel portions indicate
  Orf306-dependent induction of MhpA, HcaR, GlcC, PrpB, and SdhA. Eno, enolase; PEP,
  phosphoenolpyruvate.
