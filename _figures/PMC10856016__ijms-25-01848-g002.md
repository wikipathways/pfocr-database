caption: 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR), PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  signaling pathway activation in gastric cancer (GC). Environmental factors, growth
  factors, genetic mutations, and infections with Helicobacter pylori and Epstein–Barr
  virus (EBV) activate both PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways via receptor
  tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Further, PI3K is activated by phosphorylation, inducing
  the activation of AKT and downstream activation of other protein kinases such as
  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In a similar manner, MAPK cascade is activated,
  and together with PI3K/AKT/mTOR, contributes to GC development, sustaining growth,
  survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In clinical studies, several
  inhibitors of these protein kinases have been used. Therefore, PI3K, AKT, mTOR,
  MAPK kinase (MAPKK or MEK1/2), and human epithelial growth receptor 2 (HER2), showed
  different responses regarding the survival rate. Note: + denotes activation; − denotes
  inhibition'
