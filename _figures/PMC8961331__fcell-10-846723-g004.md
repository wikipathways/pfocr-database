caption: 'Interplay Between TGF-β Signaling and Polyamine Synthesis. The main biosynthetic
  pathway of polyamines begins with ODC1-catalyzed formation of putrescine from ornithine,
  a product of the urea cycle, which is generated from arginine through hydrolysis
  by ARG1. Synthesis of spermidine and spermine requires transfer of aminopropyl groups
  from dcAdoMet, a decarboxylated product of AdoMet (S-adenosylmethionine) catalyzed
  by AMD1. Putrescine and spermidine may inhibit TGF-β signaling since depletion of
  cellular putrescine and spermidine has been shown to enhance TβRI/II levels and
  Smad nuclear translocation, while TGF-β signaling promotes synthesis of putrescine
  and spermidine through upregulation of ARG1. In addition, TGF-β signals can stimulate
  or dampen the activity of ODC1 and AMD1 depending on the cell types. Pink texts
  and arrows, the urea cycle and polyamine synthesis. Abbreviations: MTA, methylthioadenosine;
  ARG1, arginase 1; ODC1, ornithine decarboxylase 1; AMD1, adenosylmethionine decarboxylase
