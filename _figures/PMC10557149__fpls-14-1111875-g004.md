caption: 'Simplified graphical illustration of the phytohormonal signalling crosstalks
  underpinning plant drought and/or heat stress (D/+H) stress tolerance. Generally,
  ABA negatively regulates growth-promoting hormones brassinostroids (BRs), giberrelic
  acids (GAs), cytokinins (CKs), ethylene (ET) and auxins (Aux). Nonetheless, ABA,
  BR, ET and salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathways crosstalk to induce D/+H stress
  tolerance, through sharing similar transcriptional targets (Choudhary and Muthamilarasan,
  2022). Meanwhile, SA crosstalk with jasmonic acid (JA) to improve antioxidant capacity,
  whereas strigolactones (SLs) interact with H2O2, nitric oxide (NO) and SLOW ANION
  CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1 (SLAC1) to induce stomatal closure and enhance osmotic stress
  tolerance (Lv et al., 2018). SLs also regulate root system architecture (RSA) adjustment,
  aquaporins (AQP) activity and AMF processes (Mostofa et al., 2018), which all contribute
  to enhanced D/+H stress tolerance. Note: For clarity, connections between components
  have been kept to a minimum; see text for detailed discussion. Solid arrows denote
  confirmed and positive regulation, whereas blunt ended lines show inhibition. Dashed
  arrows imply relationships yet to be confirmed. Modified from (Tenorio Berrío et al.,
  2022; Zenda et al., 2022). Pro, proline; Jas accum, jasmonates accumulation; ROS,
