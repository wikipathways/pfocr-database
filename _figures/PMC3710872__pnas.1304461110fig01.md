caption: 'Avoidance of toxic IC accumulation is a phenotype favored by selection to
  drive gene clustering in fungi. Several human genes that, when disrupted, lead to
  inborn errors of metabolism have fungal orthologs that are clustered. For example,
  galactosemia arises when any one of three enzymatic steps in the galactose pathway
  is disrupted (A). Type 1 galactosemia, the most severe form, leads to accumulation
  of galactose-1-phosphate, a toxic inhibitor of glycolysis. In many fungi, this pathway
  is clustered. Similarly, tyrosinemia arises when any one of three different genes
  in the tyrosine catabolic pathway is disrupted, with symptoms that vary in severity
  according to the properties of the accumulating IC (B). Tyrosinemia type I, the
  most damaging form that frequently leads to hepatic cancer, stems from loss of the
  final step in the pathway, leading to accumulation of fumarylacetoacetate, a mutagenizing
  and alkylating IC. In many fungi, the genes participating in this pathway are also
  clustered. Our hypothesis (C) is that natural selection against the accumulation
  of toxic ICs results in the clustering of the genes that handle them. We tested
  this hypothesis on the simplest type of gene cluster, gene pairs that are neighbors
  in the metabolic network, i.e., share an IC, and that are also immediately adjacent
  neighbors on the chromosome, which we refer to as DNGPs. Topologically, the two
  genes composing a DNGP can have four possible orientations relative to each other
  on the chromosome (D): one divergent orientation, one convergent orientation, and
  two different colinear orientations depending on gene order.'
