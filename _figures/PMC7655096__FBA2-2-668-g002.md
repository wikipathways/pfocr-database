caption: Major signaling pathways during the process of osteoclast differentiation.
  RANK and OPG are TNFR receptor‐related proteins, and RANKL is a TNF‐related cytokine
  that interacts specifically with either RANK or OPG. RANKL and M‐CSF regulate osteoclastogenesis
  through M‐CSF‐cFms, RANKL‐RANK as well as Ig‐like receptors associated with ITAM‐harbouring
  adaptor molecules such as DAP12 and Fc‐receptor common γ‐subunit (FcRγ). RANKL and
  its receptor RANK transduce a signal via the adaptor molecule TRAF6. TRAF6 recruits
  TAB2 and TAK1, which in turn activates the NF‐κB pathway and MAPK pathway. NF‐κB
  persuades c‐Fos expression via IKKs. Activation of MAPK pathway results in the activation
  of the Jun proteins. The c‐Fos and Jun proteins associate to form the complex AP‐1.
  The expression of the master regulator of osteoclastogenesis, NFATc1, is driven
  by AP‐1, NF‐κB and NFATc1 itself. The activation of NFATc1 is regulated by a co‐stimulatory
  signal pathway. FcRγ, DAP12 and their associating molecules activate Syk, which
  forms a complex with Btk/Tec and BLNK/SLP76. This complex further activates PLCγ,
  resulting in calcium signaling. The calcium signaling activates calcineurin, which
  dephosphorylates NFATc1, promoting its entry into the nucleus. Activated NFATc1
  promotes its own expression making an autoamplification loop. The calcium signaling
  also induces c‐Fos expression via CAMKIV and CREB. NFATc1, together with other factors
  including PU.1 and MITF, promotes the expression of osteoclastogenic genes.
