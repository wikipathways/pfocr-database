caption: Expression of B cell maturation antigen on plasma cells. The stages of B
  cell differentiation take place in the bone marrow and Lymphnode. When memory cells
  differentiate into plasma cells, BCMA expression begins and is expressed on short-lived
  proliferating plasmablasts, and long-lived PCs, mature B-cells and malignant B cells
  which are much more pronounced in malignant cells. An example is multiple myeloma
  cells. BCMA isn’t critical for normal B-cell homeostasis but is required for the
  survival of long-lived PCs. induction of BCMA expression occurs with a BAFF-R decreasing
  during the differentiation of PCs. APRIL and BAFF are two ligands for BCMA, And
  BCMA has a closely related to calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor
  (TACI). In addition to binding to BCMA, these ligands bind to their receptors at
  the cell surface, triggering signaling pathways which promote the growth and survival
  of PCs and activate anti-apoptotic pathways. APRIL binds to sulfated side chains
  of heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) its binding site to bind to TACI and BCMA.
  APRIL/BCMA signaling pathway Increases the activity of malignant plasma cells. BCMA
  is converted to soluble BCMA (sBCMA) by the enzyme protease γ-secretase, sBCMA can
  interfere with signaling and the level of sBCMA is a marker for b cell involvement
  in some disease
