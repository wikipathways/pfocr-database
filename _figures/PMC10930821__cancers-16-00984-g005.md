caption: Molecular mechanisms of immunogenic cell death and tumor-specific immune
  activation via unfolded protein response (UPR) activation by anticancer drugs. When
  anticancer drugs are administered, cancer cells exceed the UPR threshold to the
  point of lethality, activating the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like
  ER kinase (PERK) and inositol-requiring 1 (IRE1) signaling pathways and activating
  transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible gene 153
  (Gadd153)/CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) induction, which
  in turn downregulates X-linked inhibitor of apoptotic protein (XIAP), decreasing
  antiapoptotic and increasing proapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein expression,
  leading to cell death. In this process, dying cancer cells externalize calreticulin
  (CRT) to the membrane surface and release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
  such as ATP, annexin 1, and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) for immune activation.
  Dendritic cells (DCs) are recruited and activated by the secretion of ATP that binds
  to P2RY2 and P2RX7 receptors. They are then homed by the binding of released annexin
  1 to formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1). CRT stimulates the phagocytosis of dying
  cancer cells by binding to CD91 receptors on DCs. HMGB1 release stimulates DC recruitment
  via binding to receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) receptors and
  induces DC maturation via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Mature DCs migrate
  to lymph nodes, where they cross-prime and cause the clonal expansion of T cells,
  including interleukin 12 (IL-12) and type I interferon (IFN). IFN-γ-producing T
  cells are recruited and exert cytotoxic responses to eradicate cancer cells. Tumor
  antigens (TAs) released from dying cells are taken up by immature DCs, which then
  activate and mature. TAs and tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) are processed in mature
  DCs and presented to CD8+ T cells as major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I)
  molecules, generating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) for tumor-specific immune responses.
