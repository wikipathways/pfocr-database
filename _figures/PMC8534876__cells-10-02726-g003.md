caption: Membrane organization of cofilin regulatory proteins and lipid binding sites.
  Membranes associated phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), found in highest concentrations
  in sphingolipid/cholesterol enriched lipid raft domains, bind both cofilin and serine
  3 phospho-cofilin ①, which are released upon activation of PLC. Different isoforms
  of phospholipase C (PLC) can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs, diagrammed
  here) or by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and release diacylglycerol (DAG)
  and various phosphoinositols. ② Inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3), released from
  PI(4,5)P2, (PIP2) is an activator for release of intracellular Ca2+. Both GPCRs
  and RTKs also activate pathways for stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange factors
  (GEFS) for activating Rho family GTPases (e.g., Rac1) ③, which work at the plasma
  membrane to activate PAKs ④ by binding to their autoinhibitory domain to permit
  autophosphorylation that activates the PAK. Active PAK phosphorylates and activates
  LIMK1, also membrane bound, to locally inactivate cofilin ⑤. Cofilin phosphorylated
  on S3 is an activator of phospholipase D1 ⑥, which converts phosphatidylcholine,
  a major membrane phospholipid, to choline and phosphatidic acid (PA) []. PA can
  further signal through binding to other membrane proteins, such as those with DOCK
  domains, to enhance or reduce downstream signaling. The cofilin phosphatase chronophin
  (CIN) is recruited to the leading edge of cells through a Rac1 ⑦ and PI3-kinase
  dependent pathway [].
