caption: The increased understanding that selective COX-2 inhibitors are not free
  of unwanted side effects (particularly on renal and cardiovascular systems) have
  led to a reevaluation of other potential targets in the PG synthesis pathway downstream
  of COX for treatment and/or prevention of lung cancers, including PGE synthases
  and 15-PGDH. Another attractive target for inhibition of the activity of the PG
  synthesis pathway is inhibition of downstream receptor signaling.
