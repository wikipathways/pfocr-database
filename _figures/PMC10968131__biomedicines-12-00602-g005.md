caption: (A) EFNA4, FGFR4, SLC3A2, and HNF1A are involved in signaling pathways that
  may promote carcinogenesis. Within these pathways, RAS proteins, PI3K, AKT, mTOR,
  and other proteins promote cell proliferation, carcinogenesis, survival, and various
  carcinogenic events. (B) FGFR4 and HNF1 are involved in the pluripotency pathways
  of embryonic stem cells. For example, the TGF-β signaling pathway transmits signals
  to Smad2/3/4 and FGFR, which in turn activate the MAPK and AKT pathways to promote
  cell self-renewal [24]. FGFR4, EFNA4, and SLC3A2 are also involved in different
  pathways involved in the development of malignant pleural mesothelioma, where RAS
  family genes TP53, AKT, and APC also participate in promoting angiogenesis. FGFR4
  and EFNA4 together participate in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which promotes
  cell survival and growth
