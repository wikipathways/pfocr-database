caption: Summary of glucose effects on proteins involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
  and the TCA/glyoxylate cycle. Glucose down-regulates Hxk1p, Pgi1p, and Pgm2p in
  the glycolytic pathway. Glucose also down-regulates Fbp1p in the gluconeogenic pathway,
  Icl1p and Mls1p in the TCA/glyoxylate cycle, and Ach1p in acetate metabolism. Mdh2p
  and Pck1p are known to be down-regulated by glucose and are included in this figure.
