caption: Engineered metabolic pathway for 3-HP production by S. pombe. Two genes (adh8
  and adh SPBC337,11) were disrupted; the expression of three endogenous genes (atd1,
  acc, ptk1) was enhanced; and four exogenous genes (acsSE* from Salmonella enterica,
  separate fragments encoding MCR-C* and MCR-N from Chloroflexus aurantiacus, and
  BGL from Aspergillus aculeatus) were introduced
