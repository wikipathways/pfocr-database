caption: Two-step model of chordin gene regulation in the zebrafish gastrula. (A)
  During early- and mid-blastula stages, β-catenin-2 enters the nuclei of the dorsal
  YSL and dorsal blastomeres triggering the transcriptional activation of boz and
  sqt, which in turn induce axial expression of chd (expressed in the region shown
  in dark blue) in a process dependent on FGF signaling. boz is shown activating chd
  by inhibition of a repressor, X, which could be one or more of the Vox/Vent/Ved
  class of homeobox repressor proteins. Approximately 30 minutes after the first dorsal
  appearance of sqt and FGF transcripts, Nodal signals from the YSL induce sqt expression
  in the lateral and ventral germ-ring, and germ-ring Sqt induces expression of FGF
  genes in this region. (B) By mid-gastrula stage, axial mesoderm (shown in dark blue)
  continues to express chd and is also the source of anti-Wnt secreted proteins such
  as Fzb1. These anti-Wnt and anti-BMP proteins will diffuse laterally and form a
  region (shown in beige) in which Wnt and BMP signaling is inhibited In cells around
  the germ-ring, wnt8 is induced by Nodal signaling. A broad band of potential germ-ring
  derived chd expression (light blue) is established by sqt/cyc acting through Fgfs.
  In the paraxial regions where Wnt8 is inhibited by anti-Wnt proteins (light blue/grey
  stipes), chd is expressed, whereas in the more lateral and ventral regions, Wnt8,
  acting through Vox and Vent, inhibits the expression of chd. Indicated in grey typeface
  and arrows are those parts of the pathway that normally do not operate in that particular
  region due to the normal inhibitory network.
