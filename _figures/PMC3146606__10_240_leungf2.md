caption: 'Model of PARP function in base excision repair and consequences of PARP
  inhibition. PARP is recruited and activated to sites of spontaneous or drug-induced
  single-strand DNA damage through its DNA binding domain. ADP-ribose is then polymerized
  from its substrate NAD+ to PARP-1 itself at the automodification domain and to histone
  (H1 and H2B) tails, forming linear and branched poly(ADP-ribose) chains. Histone
  poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation causes relaxation of the chromatin to accommodate more DNA
  repair enzymes. The auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-1 creates a negatively charged
  region that mediates the recruitment of base excision repair proteins, including
  XRCC1 (X-ray repair cross-complementing 1), DNA polymerase β and DNA ligase III.
  After repair of damaged DNA, PARP-1 dissociates and the poly(ADP-ribose) chains
  are degraded by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) and possibly the ADP-ribose
  hydrolase ARH3 to produce PARP and ADP-ribose, which is converted to AMP by NUDIX.
  PARP hyperactivation can cause cell death by mechanisms involving NAD+ depletion
  and AMP accumulation. Consequences of PARP inhibition are as follows: When PARP
  is inhibited, unresolved single-strand breaks will accumulate and convert into double-strand
  DNA legions in the S-phase. The MRN complex and ATM are recruited to sites of double-strand
  DNA damage and damage repair signaling is initiated. Of note, MRN and ATM will likely
  be less efficiently recruited because of PARP inhibition, resulting in prolonged
  double-strand breaks. During the S-phase, ATM activation will result in activation
  of homologous recombination repair (HR) proteins such as BRCA1, BRCA2, RPA2, RAD51,
  RAD52 and potentially FANCD2 proteins. Functional Rad51-mediated HR may then repair
  DNA breaks through homology search, strand invasion, DNA synthesis and ligation.
  In the absence of a functional HR pathway, dsDNA breaks may persist or be repaired
  by the error-prone NHEJ pathway.'
