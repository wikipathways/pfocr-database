caption: 'The key components in auxin perception and signaling in Arabidopsis. ARF
  proteins contain a non-conserved AD or RD flanked by an N-terminal DBD (composed
  of a B3 domain, a dimerization domain: DD, and a Tudor-like ancillary domain within
  the C-terminal region of the flanking domain: FD) and a C-terminal PB1 domain (previously
  referred to as domain III/IV). Parts of the DD and FD are found both N-terminal
  and C-terminal to the B3 domain. In this pathway, the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE
  1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX proteins (TIR1/AFBs) are F-box proteins that, together with
  other proteins (ASK1, CUL1, RBX), form the ubiquitin protein ligase complex, SCFTIR1.
  At low auxin levels (A), the Aux/IAA proteins form multimers with ARFs and recruit
  TPL to the chromatin. High levels of auxin (B) promote ubiquitination and degradation
  of Aux/IAAs through SCFTIR1∕AFB and the 26S proteasome (Kim et al., ; Guilfoyle
  and Hagen, , ; Szemenyei et al., ; Boer et al., ; Guilfoyle, ; Korasick et al.,
  ; Salehin et al., ).'
