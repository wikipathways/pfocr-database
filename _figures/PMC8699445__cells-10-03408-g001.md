caption: 'Pathways and proteins identified in brain metastasis from ovarian cancer.
  (A) Hormones pathway. Effects of estrogens are mediated by activation of nuclear
  receptors, the estrogen receptor-α (ER-α), and estrogen receptor-β (ER-β). The complex
  estrogen and ERα/β, phosphorylated and dimerized, moves into the nucleus and activates
  transcription of a battery of genes (ERE-genes), which stimulate cell proliferation.
  However, complex estrogen-ER, through transmembrane protein, activates the MAPK
  and PI3K/AKT pathway. Indeed the association progesterone and PR, regulates these
  pathways. Finally, AR causes the synthesis of pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL-6
  and IL-8) and activates the ABC transporters expression, as MDR-1. (B) Homologous
  recombination pathway. The complex ATM recognizes dsDNA break and recruits complex
  BRCA1 and BRCA2, blocking the replication fork. RAD51 forms a nucleoprotein filament
  that mediates homologous pairing to the sister chromatid to repair the dsDNA break.
  (C) MDR-1 gene. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the product of the MDR1 gene, is an ATP-binding
  cassette (ABC) efflux transporter. This pump can efflux cytotoxic agents using ATP
  driven energy. (D) PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. The interaction between PD-1 on CD8 positive
  T cell and its ligands PD-L1 on tumor cell inhibits TCR signalling, leading to reduced
  T cell proliferation and cytokine production and increasing susceptibility to apoptosis.
