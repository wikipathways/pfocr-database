caption: 'Mechanism of arteriogenesis. Oxidative stress at endothelial cell level
  produces LDL oxidation (ox-LDL) and foam cells formation that compose atheroma plaque,
  and, in the end, determine the vessels occlusion. After an arterial occlusion (a),
  the increase in shear stress forces through the collateral vessels (b, c) activates
  shear stress genes (SSRE) triggering the arteriogenic response. Adhesion molecules
  (CAM) and some cytokines such as MCP-1 are produced by the endothelial cells, attracting
  monocytes and lymphocytes from the blood to the vascular wall that start up the
  vascular remodeling (b1,c1). eNOs is also activated, increasing NO that produces
  vasodilation, inhibits SMC growing and the oxidation of LDL molecules. These facts
  lead to the control of the atheroma plaque, lowering oxidative stress. GH contributes
  to increase NO pathway by activating the Pi3K/Akt pathway. NO: nitric oxide; eNOS:
  endothelial nitric oxide synthase; ox-LDL: oxidized low density lipoprotein; GH:
  growth hormone; GHR: GH receptor; SSRE: shear stress response elements (promoter
  sequences that mediates the responsiveness of endothelial genes to shear stress);
  SMC: smooth muscle cells. Blue arrows indicate stimulation. Red line indicates inhibition
  of SMC growth and inhibition of ox-LDL. Black arrow indicates the absence of blood
  flow after the occlusion, due to the lack of enlargement of collateral arterioles.'
