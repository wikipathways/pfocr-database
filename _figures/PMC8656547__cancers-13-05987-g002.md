caption: A schematic diagram of the role of various ncRNAs in modulating the TGF-β/SMAD
  signaling pathway in pituitary gland tumors. According to this cascade, it could
  be triggered through the binding of active TGF-β with TβRII and forming the TβRI-TβRII
  heteromeric complex, resulting in phosphorylation of Smad2/3, oligomerization with
  Smad4, and consequent nuclear translocation to modulate the transcription of ECM
  genes. Furthermore, Smad7 could play a remarkable role as a negative modulator of
  the TGF-β cascade. In addition, TGF-β has a significant part in triggering the activation
  of downstream signaling pathways containing MAPK, modulated by the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK
  cascade, and TAK1, regulated by the TAB1 pathway. This could also lead to mediating
  the activation of MKK4-JNK and MKK3-p38 cascades and upregulation of AP-1 and ATF-2,
  respectively, and the overexpression of NF- κB to modulate profibrotic responses
  []. Previous studies have authenticated that several ncRNAs could have a significant
  part in regulating the TGF-β/SMAD cascade in pituitary gland tumors. As an illustration,
  recent literature has detected that overexpression of lnc-SNHG1 could considerably
  elevate the expression level of TβRII through activating TβRII/SMAD3 in invasive
  pituitary tumor cells via sponging miR-302/372/373/520 []. Furthermore, other research
  has indicated that upregulation of miR-93-5p could downregulate the expression level
  of Smad7, thereby activating the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling-mediated fibrosis of prolactinoma
  cells []. Green arrows indicate the upregulation of target genes modulated via ncRNAs
  (miRNAs and lncRNAs); red arrows depict inhibition regulated by them.
