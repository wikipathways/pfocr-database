caption: Schematic representation of BMP signal transduction. Upon BMP ligand binding
  to Type II BMP receptors, Type I BMP receptors are cross-phosphorylated, recruiting
  R-Smads (Smads 1/5/8) to the intracellular domain of the Type I receptor and initiating
  signal transduction via phosphorylation. Activated R-Smads then form a heteromeric
  complex with Co-Smads (Smad 4) before translocating to the nucleus to regulate gene
  expression. Inhibitory Smads (Smads 6/7) reside in the nucleus, migrate to the cytoplasm
  and negatively regulate BMP signaling by inhibiting signal transduction at several
  points along the pathway. The Type I and Type II receptors thought to be involved
  in BMP9 signal transduction are highlighted.
