caption: 'Scheme of potential molecular targets and therapeutic agents including FDA-approved
  and upcoming targeted therapies in TNBC. Extracellular stimuli, such as growth factors,
  initiate PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK signaling pathways to activate transcription of target
  genes involved in proliferation, survival, and tumorigenesis. There are potential
  targeted therapeutics that inhibit these pathways, including AKT inhibitors or MEK
  inhibitors. In the case of TNBC tumors harboring BRCA1/2 mutations, PARP replaces
  them, allowing DNA damage to repair and tumor cells to survive. Thus, PARP inhibitors
  are commonly prescribed for BRCA1/2 mutated TNBC patients. Carboplatin, a platinum
  salt, induces DNA crosslink strand breaks and causes the apoptosis of tumor cells
  with a dysfunctional repair pathway. Androgen receptor (AR) is activated by binding
  of androgen, triggering dimerization and translocation of androgen-AR complex to
  stimulate cell growth and metabolism in TNBC. AR inhibitors compete with androgens
  to bind AR and block the AR signaling pathway. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes recognize
  the neo-antigen of tumor cells binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I
  and kill the tumor cells. To avoid anti-cancer immunity of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes,
  TNBC tumor cells exhibit anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which binds to
  PD-1 of the T-lymphocyte. Immunotherapeutic antibodies have been introduced to suppress
  immune evasion in TNBC tumors. Recently, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) have been
  approved by the FDA for clinical use in TNBC. Blue arrow: signaling transduction,
  red arrow: action of blockers and inhibitors, yellow star: mutations, yellow circle:
