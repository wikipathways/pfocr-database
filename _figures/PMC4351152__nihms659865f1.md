caption: 'The mTOR pathway is regulated by numerous upstream pathways, typically in
  response to growth factors (anabolic) or energy/nutrient deficiency (cell static
  or catabolic). Two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, then activate downstream regulators
  of cellular activity, including protein translation and ribosomal biogenesis. Brain-specific
  activity likely crucial to the development of seizures or epilepsy include regulation
  of cell structure, primarily through mTORC2, and mTORC1-dependent regulation of
  channel and receptor expression, cell growth and proliferation, autophagy and apoptosis.
  Rapamycin primarily inhibits the activity of mTORC1 and has little effect on mTORC2,
  at least under acute conditions. Abbreviations: Akt protein kinase B, AMPK AMP-activated
  protein kinase, DEPDC5 DEP domain containing 5, GABAr gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor,
  Kv1.1 potassium channel, voltage dependent 1.1, LKB1 liver kinase B1, mTOR mammalian
  target of rapamycin, mTORC mTOR complex, PI3K phosphoinositide 3-kinase, PTEN phosphase
  and tensin homolog, Rheb Ras homolog enriched in brain, S6K S6 kinase, TSC tuberous
  sclerosis complex.'
