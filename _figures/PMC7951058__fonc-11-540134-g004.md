caption: Molecular pathway and network analysis of proteomics analysis of differentially
  expressed proteins in LTLT-Ca mammospheres and LTLT-Ca adherent cells. The proteome
  data was uploaded into IPA software that determined a network view of predicted
  associations for midasin. The network nodes represent proteins, and solid lines
  indicated a direct relationship while dashed lines represent an indirect relationship
  between proteins.
