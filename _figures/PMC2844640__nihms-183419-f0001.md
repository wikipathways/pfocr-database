caption: Classical canonical TGF-β signaling pathway showing the dual effects of this
  signaling on the cell growth. Normally this pathway induces cell growth suppressive
  effects, however, during the process of tumorigenesis due to several factors TGF-β
  signaling pathway induces proliferation, invasiveness, angiogenesis, metastasis
  and immune suppression. In this figure, based on the findings from our group, radiation
  can potently induce TGF-β and this TGF-β can be activated to exert negative growth
  effects by inducing the expression of cdk inhibitors such as p21 and p16. It is
  also shown here that the inhibitory Smad7 can be induced by Smad4 that can in turn
  inhibit the TGF-β signaling.
