caption: 'Regulation of GPCR signaling. Binding of agonist to the GPCR initiates a
  series of events: exchange of GDP for GTP on Gα subunit, dissociation of activated
  GTP-Gα and Gβγ dimer, stimulation of downstream effectors (depicted in ). To prevent
  overstimulation and assure receptor resensitization, GPCR signaling is regulated
  by multiple mechanisms (few are enumerated here; see Further Reading list for detailed
  description). (A) Regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins function as GTPase-activating
  proteins, enhance the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of the Gα subunit resulting
  in generation of inactive GDP-Gα, and promoting the reassembly G-protein heterotrimer
  and its reassociation with the receptor. (B) GPCR kinases (GRK) phosphorylate specific
  residues on the intracellular domain of agonist-occupied receptor. Phosphorylated
  receptor recruits β arrestin that sterically hinders interaction of the receptor
  with G-protein, thus uncoupling the G-protein complex from the GPCR (termed as desensitization).
  (C) Binding to the phosphorylated GPCR activates arrestin enabling it to perform
  ligand regulated scaffolding functions. Activated β arrestin interacts with the
  endocytic machinery (clathrin and adaptor proteins) and initiates receptor internalization.
  (D-F) Internalized GPCR in GPCR-β arrestin endosome can have multiple fates. GPCR-β
  arrestin complex can (D) direct the assembly of signalosome by allowing coupling
  of mitogen-activated protein kinases propagating further signaling pathways, (E)
  be targeted for lysosomal degradation, or (F) GPCRs can be trafficked to recycling
  endosomes and recycled back to the plasma membrane for resensitization. (G) Ligand
  type can also determine course of GPCR signaling where biased agonists can specifically
  activate either G-protein or β arrestin-mediated signaling pathway. (H) Gene transcription
  can also affect the total membrane levels of the GPCR. Transcription can be regulated
  by various inflammatory mediators, which can activate transcription factors that
  bind directly like XBP-1 on FFA2 promoter or indirectly affect chromatin accessibility
  by altering acetylation/methylation of the promoter (IFNγ for GPR109a). (I) GPCRs
  can form oligomers (homodimers or heterodimers) that can regulate () cell surface
  delivery following receptor maturation or cellular trafficking following agonist
  activation, and () receptor pharmacology and signaling. Short chain fatty acid receptors
  (highlighted in blue color font) are noted if data exist on their regulatory mechanisms.
