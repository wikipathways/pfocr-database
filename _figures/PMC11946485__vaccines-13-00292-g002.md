caption: The regulatory role of PI3K signaling pathway in immune cell function. The
  PI3K signaling pathway widely regulates the activation, differentiation, and survival
  of immune cells such as T cells and B cells by integrating signals transmitted by
  multiple receptors. Its functions include immune cell proliferation, cytokine secretion,
  and antigen presentation ability, thereby coordinating the dynamic balance of innate
  and adaptive immune responses, providing support for the body’s immune defense and
  homeostasis maintenance
