caption: Parasitic infections induce the metabolic reprogramming in macrophages. M1
  type macrophages can be activated by the infection of intracellular parasites such
  as T. cruzi, T brucei and L. donovani, which are characterized by glycolysis. However,
  helminths infection can induce the M2 polarization of macrophage in the chronic
  stage, which are dominated by fatty acid oxidation and broken of TCA cycle. The
  SEA of Schistosoma sp. can inactivate PTEN and its downstream pathway, thereby promoting
  glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation and inducing a mixed but type 2 biased anti-inflammatory
  response in macrophage. Interestingly, the ESPs of larval E. granulosus can activate
  the expression of ACOD1, which can encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the cis-aconitate
  to produce itaconate in the TCA cycle. It is reported that itaconate can inhibit
  the activity of SDH, thereby leading to the accumulation of succinate. Moreover,
  the succinate can activate GPR91 to induce the M2 polarization of macrophage through
  PI3K/HIF-1α pathway. ESPs, excretory/secretory products; SDH, succinodehydrogenase;

  description: Parasitic infections induce the metabolic reprogramming in macrophages.
    M1 type macrophages can be activated by the infection of intracellular parasites
    such as T. cruzi, T brucei and L. donovani, which are characterized by glycolysis.
    However, helminths infection can induce the M2 polarization of macrophage in the
    chronic stage, which are dominated by fatty acid oxidation and broken of TCA cycle.
    The SEA of Schistosoma sp. can inactivate PTEN and its downstream pathway, thereby
    promoting glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation and inducing a mixed but type 2
    biased anti-inflammatory response in macrophage. Interestingly, the ESPs of larval
    E. granulosus can activate the expression of ACOD1, which can encodes the enzyme
    that catalyzes the cis-aconitate to produce itaconate in the TCA cycle. It is
    reported that itaconate can inhibit the activity of SDH, thereby leading to the
    accumulation of succinate. Moreover, the succinate can activate GPR91 to induce
