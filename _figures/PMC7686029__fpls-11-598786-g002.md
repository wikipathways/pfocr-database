caption: Illustration of proposed interactions among glycolytic pathways, photosynthesis,
  and isoprene biosynthesis in (A) photoautotrophic eukaryotes in continous light
  (B) heterotrophic eukaryotes in continuous darkness. Metabolic cross-talk among
  CBB cycle (active only in light), the three glycolytic pathways namely the OPP pathway,
  the ED pathway, and cytosolic glysolysis, is indicated by prominent arrows. The
  thickness of arrows indicate the potential flux strength. The CBB cycle and glycolytic
  pathways co-contribute GAP, pyruvate to the MEP pathway and isoprene synthesis in
  light. The three glycolytic pathways sustain carbon and energy supply for isoprene
  synthesis in darkness. CBB, Calvin-Benson-Bassham; OPP, oxidative pentose phosphate;
  G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; ED, Entner-Doudoroff; 6-P-gluconate, 6-phosphogluconate;
  KDPG, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate; Ribulose-5-P, ribulose-5-phosphate; 3-PGA,
  3-phosphoglycerate; 2-PGA, 2-phosphoglycerate; GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  PEP, 2-phosphoenol pyruvate; MEP, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate; and DMADP,
  dimethylallyl diphosphate.
