caption: Consolidation of interneuron fate specification and differentiation through
  the actions of Bhlhb5 and the Notch signaling pathway. (A) Retinoic acid (RA) and
  Shh signaling activate the expression of Class I and Class II HD proteins in the
  spinal cord to establish discrete neural progenitor domains. The combinatorial actions
  of these transcription factors promote Bhlhb5 expression in the intermediate spinal
  cord. Bhlhb5 helps to refine progenitor domain borders and drives the formation
  of dI6, V1 and V2 interneurons. Repressive interactions between Bhlhb5 and opposing
  fate determinants such as Scl subsequently divide V2 neurons into V2a and V2b subclasses.
  Dashed lines indicate more subtle effects and those primarily supported by gain-of-function
  evidence. Once progenitor domains are formed, Bhlhb5 regulates the expression of
  the Notch ligands Dll1 and Jagged1 along with Lfng. (B) Within the V2 interneuron
  lineage, Bhlhb5 promotes V2a differentiation and the expression of Dll4 that engages
  Notch receptors (N) on neighboring V2 cells to induce Foxn4, Scl and Gata3, and
  elicit V2b interneuron formation.
