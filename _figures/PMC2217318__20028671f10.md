caption: Schematic description of receptors and pathways known to be involved in IP3-generated
  calcium signals and early gene regulation in muscle cells. The signaling pathway
  begins at the DHPR located in the T-tubule membrane; a heterotrimeric G protein
  with a Gi type subunit is proposed to interact with DHPR and to activate PLC to
  produce IP3 and DAG. IP3 will diffuse into the cytosol and reach IP3Rs located both
  at the SR membrane and at the nuclear envelope. Calcium release will occur independently
  into both cytosol and nucleoplasm and several calcium-dependent mechanisms will
  be activated. ERKs 1/2 will be phosphorylated in the cytosol and phosphorylated
  CREB (P-CREB) will increase inside the nucleus. Transcription of early genes such
  as c-jun will increase after P-CREB activation of a CRE box located upstream. All
  of the above steps are based on published data. Roles for the Ras-raf pathway upstream
  of ERKs and for PKC, activated by DAG as nuclear coactivator of CREB are postulated
  based on inhibition experiments (unpublished data). Red arrows denote activation
  and blue arrows indicate release.
