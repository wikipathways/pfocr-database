caption: Schematic overview of the BR signaling cascade and the results of this study.
  The figure provides a simplified scheme of BR signaling based on [, ]. ‌The genes
  studied in this work are indicated by a yellow star. Binding of BRs to the BRI1/BAK1
  receptor triggers the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation signaling cascade that leads
  to the deactivation (dephosphorylation) of BIN2. The effects of BIN2 and BZR1/BES1
  on BR-biosynthesis genes are depicted. The overlap between stress-response and BR
  response genes and the dual effect of BZR1/BES1 on stress response genes is also
  shown. The question marks indicate missing links that have been suggested based
  on the result of the present study. The hypothetical inferred role for BRS1 in providing
  a better condition for BRI/BAK1/BR binding by generating a more acidic environment
  is shown on the top right-hand side. The compensatory pathway resulting in the over-expressing
  expression of PP2C mediated by ABA is shown on the left-hand side. (Created with
