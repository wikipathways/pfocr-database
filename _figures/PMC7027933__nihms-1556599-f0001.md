caption: Homologous recombination is a complex pathway involving multiple meta-stable
  reversible intermediates. Resection can be reverted by fill-in by Polα-dependent
  DNA synthesis (), the NPF can be disassembled by the action of helicases and ubiquitin
  ligases (), and D-loops can be disrupted (see text). Second end capture can be accomplished
  by two different mechanisms, annealing of two single-strand DNAs or invasion of
  duplex DNA of the second end (past the resection junction) by the extended first
  end (not shown)
