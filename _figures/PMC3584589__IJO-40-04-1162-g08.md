caption: Two mechanisms by which miR-200a regulates the activity of β-catenin. One
  mechanism is that miR-200a directly interacts with the 3′ untranslated region of
  β-catenin, another is that miR-200a up-regulates E-cadherin through down-regulation
  of its target gene, ZEB1/2, which then influences the activity of Cadherin/Catenin
  complexes.
