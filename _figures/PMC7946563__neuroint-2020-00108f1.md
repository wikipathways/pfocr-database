caption: Increased activity of IkB/NFkB as the basis of the chronic inflammation and
  insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Intracellular fatty acyl-CoA levels found
  in insulin resistance and lipotoxicity, in correlation to the subsequent activation
  of the enzyme IkB kinase (via inflammatory factors such as fatty acyl-CoAs), will
  phosphorylate IkB, causing the release of NFkB (upon the polyubiquitination and
  degradation of IkB), which enters the nucleus where it is responsible for inflammation,
  cell proliferation and atherogenesis by the stimulation of inflammatory cytokines,
  growth factors, and iNOS, which in turn will stimulate TNFα, IL-6, and PKC, which
  will impede insulin signaling by serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 ultimately, causing
  insulin resistance. Therefore, the increased activity of IkB/NFkB will not only
  instigate inflammation but also further aid and boost atherogenesis. The MAP kinase
  pathway is responsible for the insulin-stimulated glucose impaired metabolism and
  for this reason, related to cardiovascular diseases. FACoA, Fatty acyl-CoA; IkB,
