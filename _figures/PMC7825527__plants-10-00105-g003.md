caption: Changes in major metabolic pathways of maize roots and leaves under exogenous
  GSH and cadmium stress conditions. The solid arrows represent direct metabolic pathway
  connections, and the dashed arrows indicate that these metabolites are involved
  in the metabolic pathway. The changes in the metabolites in maize roots and leaves
  under exogenous GSH and cadmium stress conditions are shown in the heatmap, and
  their order within the heatmap is CdL, CdR, GSHL, and GSHR. CdL, Cd treatment vs.
  control in leaves; CdR, Cd treatment vs. control in roots; GSHL, exogenous GSH and
  Cd treatment vs. Cd treatment in leaves; and GSHR, exogenous GSH and Cd treatment
  vs. Cd treatment in roots. Cd treatment (5 μM CdCl2), exogenous GSH (30 μM GSH).
