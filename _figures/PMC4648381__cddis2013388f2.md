caption: 'MGMT and other DNA repair mechanisms deal with DNA damage produced by the
  alkylating agent TMZ in cancer cells. TMZ cause potentially cytotoxic DNA lesions
  such as O6-meG (red circle), N7-meG (red ellipse) and N3-meA (red ellipse). (a)
  MGMT removes the O6-alkylguanine DNA adduct, O6-meG, through covalent transfer of
  the alkyl group to the conserved active-site cysteine and restores guanine to normal.
  After receiving a methyl-group from O6-meG, MGMT is inactivated and subjected to
  ubiquitin-mediated degradation. (b) If an O6-meG DNA adduct escapes MGMT repair,
  it would form a base pair with thymine during DNA replication. The mismatched base
  pair of the persistent O6-meG with thymine is recognized by the MMR pathway, resulting
  in futile cycles of repair leading to DSBs and triggering apoptosis. (c) N7-meG
  and N3-meA DNA adducts are efficiently repaired by the BER pathway and normally
  contribute little to TMZ cytotoxicity in cancer cells. Methoxyamine binds to apurinic/apyrimidinic
  (AP) DNA damage sites produced by methylpurine glycosylase (MPG, blue circle), the
  first step in BER processing. Methoxyamine-bound AP sites are refractory to AP endonuclease
  cleavage, resulting in the blockage of the BER pathway, leading to strand breaks,
  disrupted replication, and increased cytotoxicity of TMZ. Chemistry of the lesion
  and the repair intermediates throughout the repair process are highlighted as the
  three major steps for BER: lesion recognition/strand scission, gap tailoring, and
  DNA synthesis/ligation'
