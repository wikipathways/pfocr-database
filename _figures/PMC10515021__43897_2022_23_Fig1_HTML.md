caption: A schematic diagram of plant carotenoid metabolic pathway in plastids. Carotenoid
  biosynthesis utilizes the plastidial MEP pathway to supply the C5 precursor metabolites
  IPP and DMAPP. The first committed step in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway involves
  the condensation of two C20 GGPPs into C40 carotenoid phytoene catalyzed by PSY,
  a major rate-limiting enzyme for carotenoid biosynthesis. Carotenoid degradation
  involves specific enzymatic oxidative cleavages by CCDs and NCEDs, nonspecific enzymes,
  and non-enzymatic oxidation to produce diverse apocarotenoids including phytohormones
  ABA and strigolactones. Phytohormones are highlighted with blue color. Various plastids
  provide different storage capacity to accumulate very little of carotenoids in etioplasts
  to massive amounts of carotenoids in chromoplasts. OR is the only known bona fide
  regulator of chromoplast biogenesis. MEP, methylerythritol 4-phosphate; GA3P, glyceraldehyde
