caption: Overview of PAMPs/TLR9, type I IFN, and JAK/STAT signaling mediate the activation
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ACE2, and activation of PARP1 by sensing DNA damage
  from the induction of ROS to facilitating the transcription of TMPRSS2. ACE2 receptors
  on the surface of host cells recognize S1 glycoprotein, which contains receptor
  binding domain (RBD), and TMPRSS2 primes S2, containing fusion peptide. It can achieve
  entry via the plasma membrane or endosome. The presence of exogeneous and membrane-bound
  proteases, such as trypsin and TMPRSS2, triggers the early fusion pathway (not shown).
  In parallel, host cells endocytosed it by cleaving at the S1/S2 site. After entry
  into the lung’s alveolar epithelium, endosomal single-stranded (ss)RNA sensors (TLR7
  and TLR8) sense the viral genomes and recruit the adaptor proteins, MyD88, for downstream
  signaling. MyD88 activates TRAF6 as well as the transcription factor NFκB and induce
  expression of IFN-β cytokine. Through autocrine, Type I interferon (IFNβ) binds
  to the IFN-α/β receptors to phosphorylate and activate JAK1. This kinase further
  phosphorylates STAT1 (Y701) and STAT2 (Y). JAK/STAT signaling initiates through
  the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, a physical interaction with IRFs to form
  the ISGF3 complex (STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9) and regulates the expression of ISGs.
  ISGF3 enters the nucleus and directly binds to the upstream regulatory regions (IFNs)
  of IFN-sensitive genes (iNOS) and cytokine (IL6) and causes a cytokine ‘storm’,
  thereby regulating the expression of specific gene expressions of M1 phenotype,
  which leads to M1-polarized macrophages. DAMPs bind to TLR4 receptors after phagocytosis
  of bacteria by M1 polarized macrophages. Simultaneously, type I IFNs binds to neighboring
  cells by paracrine signaling and via the similar JAK/STAT pathway, while the ISGF3
  complex binds to ISRE of the ACE2 promoter to initiate the expression. Production
  of NO increases the ROS in the cell, which leads to ssDNA damage. It enzymatically
  activates auto-poly(ribosyl)ation of PARP1 and accumulation of negatively charged
  pADPr repulse poly(ribosyl)ated PARP1 from DNAs (TMPRSS2, IFNβ and STAT1/2), mediating
  loosening of chromatin and facilitating the transcription initiation of these genes.
  Potential targets ACE2, TMPRSS2, NFκB, STAT1/2, IRF9 (ISGF3 complex), TLR9, and
  type I IFN receptors are indicated by a red arrow. Nucleotide sequences in promoter
  of ISGs are termed as interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs).
