caption: The SARS-CoV-2 life cycle in the host cell. After attachment to its receptor,
  the virus enters the cytosol through the endosomal pathway. The next step in the
  coronavirus lifecycle entails the translation of the virion’s replicase gene from
  genomic RNA (gRNA), which forms two co-terminal polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These
  proteins produce various non-structural proteins (nsps) following the proteolysis
  processes. Approximately all nsps merge into the Replicase-Transcriptase Complex
  (RTC) to render a region suitable for RNA synthesis and are unanimously responsible
  for replication and transcription of subgenomic RNA (sgRNA). The sgRNAs act as mRNAs
  for the structural as well as accessory genes that are located downstream of polyprotein
  replicase. Both gRNAs and sgRNAs are produced via ribosomal frameshifting that generates
  intermediate RNAs by discontinues transcription. Upon replication and synthesis
  of the (+) sgRNA, the viral structural proteins, including S, E, and M, are translated
  into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and pass through the secretory cycle into the
  endoplasmic Reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Subsequently, the
  virus genome, covered by N protein, buds inside the ERGIS membrane, which is composed
  of other viral structural proteins. After assembly, the particles are transported
  to the cell exterior via vesicles and released by exocytosis
