caption: Interactions of Rex with host pathways, uncovered and covered. Besides the
  known interactions between Rex and CRM-1, importinβ, and B-23, a number of potential
  interactions between Rex and cellular proteins, based on the high-throughput yeast
  two-hybrid system, were reported by . Rex is suspected of interacting with a series
  of proteins that play crucial roles in mRNA surveillance, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling,
  tumor growth regulation, and SUMOylation. Air1 (ZCCHC7) is a component of the TRAMP
  complex, which is involved in nuclear mRNA surveillance. NUP62 is one of three nucleoporins
  (NUP54, 58, and 62) composing the nuclear pore complex and is essential for nuclear
  transport. LZTS2 is a tumor suppressor and its expression is transcriptionally regulated
  by NF-κB. LZTS2 expression levels affect cell proliferation and tumor growth through
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in various cancer cell lines. An E2 SUMO ligase, UBC9,
  and an E3 SUMO ligase, PIAS2, are also expected to interact with Rex. Rex is also
  expected to interact with SP100, a major component of the nuclear body, which has
  a transactivating function and is induced in stimulated and malignant cells. Since
  Rex impacts the host cell through an unknown mechanism, such as increasing il-2rα
  mRNA level and fyn-b mRNA expression level by enhancing unusual exon 7 usage, unknown
  interactions between Rex and cellular proteins may be related to Rex functions.
  Solid lines indicate reported interactions. Dashed lines indicate potential interactions.
