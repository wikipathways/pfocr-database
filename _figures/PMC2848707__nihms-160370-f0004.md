caption: Schematic representation of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway for phosphorylation
  of ceramides and long chain bases (LCBs) in plants. Activities are indicated in
  black boxes. Genes which have been cloned are indicated in dark grey ovals. The
  substrate specificity has been characterized for LCB lyase and LCB kinase. Biochemical
  properties of LCB-P phosphatase remain to be determined.
