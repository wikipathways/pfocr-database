caption: Schematic pathway for the synthesis of biarsenical probes built on the fluorescein
  platform. Stages include the synthesis of parent the fluorophore, its subsequent
  mercurization, transmetalation with AsCl3, and final capping with EDT. It should
  be noted that first reaction results in forming of two isomers, where Z is located
  at position 5 or 6 in the product. Since the probes used in this study are single
  isomers the Z was placed at position 5.
