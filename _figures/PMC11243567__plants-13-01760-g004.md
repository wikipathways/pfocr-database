caption: Illustration of Al tolerance mechanisms in plants through bio-exclusion during
  stress. The plant’s response to Al stress includes the formation of Al–organic acid
  (* oxaloacetate and * citrate as predominat residues) complexes, leading to increased
  alkalization of the root surface. This process involves the induction of Al-malate
  transporters (* ALMT), activation of proton ATPases, and alterations in cell wall
  polysaccharide composition. These adaptations aim to minimize Al accumulation within
  cells, thereby mitigating oxidative damages through enhanced antioxidation pathways
