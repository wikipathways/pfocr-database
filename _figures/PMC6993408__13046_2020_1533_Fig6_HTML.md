caption: Schematic representation of the LSS-triggered VEGF-ATOH8 signal axis mediates
  CRC m-CTCs survival. The exposure of 4–20 dyn/cm2 LSS can upregulate ATOH8 expression
  by promoting autocrine VEGF secretion of colorectal cancer cells in the circulation.
  These ATOH8high m-CTCs possess an advantage in surviving and establishing distant
  metastases. Mechanically, in CRC m-CTCs responding to LSS stimulation, VEGF activates
  the downstream AKT pathway by acting on the VEGFR2 receptor, thereby facilitating
  ATOH8 expression. Meanwhile, ATOH8 advances HK2 transcription, which not only enhances
  the mitochondrial binding of HK2 to VDAC, but also inhibits ROS production through
  activating glycolysis. Both ultimately contribute to the survival of CRC m-CTCs
