caption: Schematic overview of type I IFN production and response and the counter
  measures due to the activity of several SARS-CoV-2 (red) and SARS-CoV (blue) proteins.
  These factors act at different steps in the signal transduction pathway, leading
  to inhibition of IFN-I production in the first stage and, subsequently, by inactivating
  the JAK–STAT–ISGF3 pathway, impairing ISGs transcription. ORF6 and Nsp1 represent
  the main inhibitors of IFN production and signaling (emphasized in green).
