caption: 'M1 activated macrophages are reported to have elevated HIF‐1α expression
  associated with an increase in the utilisation of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate
  pathway (left). Conversely, these cells demonstrate a reduced activity of mitochondrial
  respiration with the TCA cycle being broken at two points: after citrate and after
  succinate. Alternatively, activated M2 macrophages (right) show upregulated HIF‐2α
  expression and are characterised by increased fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial
  respiratory chain activity.'
