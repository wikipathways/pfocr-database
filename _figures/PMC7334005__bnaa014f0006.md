caption: Metabolic regulation of the clock. Activated AMP-activated protein kinase
  (AMPK) phosphorylates CRY1 to induce its degradation, which results in reprogramming
  of the liver clock. Many metabolic pathways such as heme biosynthesis and NAD+ production,
  are regulated in a circadian manner at the transcriptional level. NAD+ regulates
  activity of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) that deacetylates clock TFs and their associated factors
  and histones. Heme serves as an endogenous ligand that potentiates REV-ERB activity.
  The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway regulates O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) activity,
  which controls the stability and transcriptional function of clock TFs.
