caption: Carcinogenesis is orchestrated by a combination of HCV as well as ROS-mediated
  processes. Increased ROS levels directly cause increased genetic mutations. However,
  if ROS levels as well as other stress signals are not high enough to induce apoptosis,
  pro-survival and repair programs, including the Nrf2/ARE pathway are activated,
  which in turn overcome cell cycle arrest, induce mitophagy and reprogram metabolism.
  See text for more details.
