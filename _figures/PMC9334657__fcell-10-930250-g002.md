caption: Metabolic features and routes towards invasion and metastasis. Melanomas,
  subjected to microenvironment-driven non-genetic heterogeneity, are composed of
  several cell subsets, which express different levels of MITF and display specific
  metabolic features that provide a distinct identity. Eventually, as a consequence
  of such a reversible identity and as a first step of the metastatic process, some
  cells acquire invasive capacity and escape from the primary tumor. Migrating cells
  can adapt to the extrinsic insults affecting them. FA metabolism may provide melanoma
  cells with survival advantages that facilitate the metastatic process. The main
  dynamic microenvironmental cues that lead to melanoma phenotypic changes are nutrients,
  drugs, and inflammatory signals (not represented in the figure). Melanoma cells
  respond to changes in these parameters adapting their metabolism, at least in part,
  through the activation of the ISR. The ISR works in melanoma as a microenvironment-sensing
  pathway that modulates cell phenotype and metabolic activity, alone or in coordination
  with other key nutrient sensing pathways, like mTORC1.
