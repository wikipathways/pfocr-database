caption: A pathway for Parkinson’s. A possibly fictitious attempt to fit the known
  environmental and genetic factors associated with sporadic and familial PD into
  a common pathological pathway involving α-synuclein proteostasis. Many parts of
  this diagram are hypothetical, and it is predicated on the assumption that there
  is a nonpathological, folded form of synuclein that must be unfolded before aggregation
  can commence. Further, it is assumed that Lewy body formation is off the pathway
  of toxicity, but this is far from certain. The direct connection between organelle
  dysfunction/damage and cell death is purely speculative. The pathway is intended
  to provide a framework for thinking about therapeutic strategies based on proteostasis,
  but it should be taken with more than just a pinch of salt.
