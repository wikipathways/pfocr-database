caption: 'Overlapping Networks and Selection of Network #7 for Further Analysis. The
  18 networks (A) are displayed and show that they have overlapping functions. Network
  #7 (B) was selected to show the molecules involved in this particular network. The
  genes in green indicate downregulation, while red signifies upregulation by TA treatment.
  The intensity of the color correlates to the degree of down- or upregulation.'
