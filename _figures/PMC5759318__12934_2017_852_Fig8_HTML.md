caption: Fluxes correlation network of compatible solute and main carbon and nitrogen
  metabolism pathways at low (a) and high (b) salinity. Each node represents a metabolic
  reaction and each edge represents an observed correlation (with Spearman Rank correlation
  value larger than 0.7). The adjacency matrix was visualized in CYTOSCAPE (3.2).
  Nodes were grouped according to their membership to different pathway subsystems
  and some reactions/enzymes was specified. Aspk aspartate kinase, AsD aspartate semialdehyde
  dehydrogenase, C fix carbon fixation, Ict isocitrate lyase, Ms malate synthase,
  PP pentoses phosphate, Ppc phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase
papertitle: Insights into metabolic osmoadaptation of the ectoines-producer bacterium
  Chromohalobacter salexigens through a high-quality genome scale metabolic model.
