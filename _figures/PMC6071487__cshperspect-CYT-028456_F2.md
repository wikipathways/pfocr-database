caption: Interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor-mediated signaling pathway and an IL-6 inhibitor,
  the humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab. IL-6 binds to soluble and
  transmembrane IL-6R and the resultant complex induces homodimerization of gp130,
  leading to activation of Janus kinase (JAK)1, JAK2, and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2).
  JAKs, in turn, phosphorylate cytoplasmic tyrosine-based motifs of gp130, followed
  by attracting Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing molecules SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine
  phosphatase 2 (SHP2) to YXXV, signal transducers and activators of transcription
  (STAT)3 to YXXQ, or STAT1 to YXPQ (Y, tyrosine; V, valine; Q, glutamine; P, proline;
  X, any amino acid), which results in a downstream signal. Of the negative feedback
  molecules in cytoplasm, negative feedback molecules, suppressor of cytokine signaling
  (SOCS)1 binds to and inhibits JAK, whereas SOCS3 binds to gp130 and inhibits STAT3
  activation. A humanized anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antibody, tocilizumab, blocks
  the IL-6-mediated signaling pathway by inhibiting IL-6 binding to both the soluble
  and transmembrane form of IL-6Rs. IL-6 can also bind to CD5 with low affinity, which
  leads to STAT3 activation. MAPKs, Mitogen-activated protein kinases.
