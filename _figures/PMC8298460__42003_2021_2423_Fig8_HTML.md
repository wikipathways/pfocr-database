caption: Under the exposure of antibiotics, SCV subpopulations emerge rapidly, accompanied
  by genomic variation and consequent metabolic dysfunction. Frameshift of AGXT1 in
  SCV potentially results in a defective glycine biosynthetic pathway, which leads
  to slow cell-wall building rate and consequent growth arrest. Overflowed pyruvic
  acid and acetyl-CoA lead SCV to generate and release a higher level of acetic acid,
  which triggers cell autolysis of SCV cells but protects NC cells against lysis by
  upregulating cidA expression of SCV and lrgA expression of NC, thereby allowing
  SCV to far more quickly autolyze. Rapid autolysis of SCV leads to the leakage of
  intracellular contents such as DNA and enhances biofilm formation, which renders
  the whole population recalcitrant toward both host immune system and antimicrobial
  agents and more importantly, facilitates persistent infection.
