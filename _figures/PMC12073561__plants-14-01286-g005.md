caption: 'Small RNAs are involved in the regulation of plant female gametophyte development.
  A: Megasporogenesis. The small RNAs involved in this process are as follows: (1)
  The target gene ARF17 of miR160 interacted genetically with the SPL/NZZ gene, and
  they ensured the formation of only one MMC in the ovule subepidermal layer by regulating
  the expression domain of PIN1. (2) The transcription and production of TAS3 ta-siRNA
  were promoted by TERMINAL EXON1 (TEX1), etc., TAS3 ta-siRNA targeted inhibition
  of ARF3 and regulated MMC specialization. (3) AGO family members ARGONAUTE 4/6/8/9
  (AGO4/6/8/9) mediated MMC establishment through siRNAs pathway. (4) siRNAs regulated
  MMC specialization by moving between cells through RDR6 and SGS3. (5) DMT103 encoded
  methyltransferase, which was involved in RNA-mediated DNA methylation and MMC formation
  together with siRNAs and other proteins. (6) MEL1 bound to siRNAs to regulate the
  entry of MMC into meiosis. (7) ARGONAUTE 104 (AGO104) participated in the meiosis
  process of MMC through a certain siRNA-mediated gene regulatory network. (8) As
  the downstream effector molecule of SWR1-ERECTA-SDG2 signaling module, BZR1 transcription
  factor directly activated the expression of HYL1, SE and DCL1 genes in the miRNA
  processing complex, and synergistically regulated the process of Arabidopsis megasporogenesis.
  (9) The AGO9-miR822 signaling pathway regulated unicellular development by limiting
  the survival of meiosis-derived cells to a single megaspore. B: Megagametogenesis.
  The small RNAs involved in this process are as follows: (10) SWR1 and ERECTA signaling
  pathways promoted the expression of AGO10 at the chalazal, localized and limited
  miR398 to the chalazal region and could not be transferred to the female gametophyte,
  ensuring that the target gene AGAMOUS-LIKE 51/52/78 (AGL51/52/78) of miR398 were
  normally expressed in the embryo sac. (11) miR165/166 affected the integument development
  of Arabidopsis ovules by regulating the expression of PHABULOSA (PHB) gene. (12)
  miR167 negatively regulated the target genes of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 6/8 (ARF6/8),
  the construction of mARF6 transgenic plants and mir167 mutants would hinder the
  development of inner and outer integument, resulting in the exposure of embryo sac
  and affecting the fertility of female gametes. (13) miR156 targeted the mRNA expressed
  by SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 8 (SPL8) gene and regulated the development
  of male and female gametophytes in Arabidopsis thaliana. (14) The insertion mutation
  of ago5-4 produced a semi-dominant ARGONAUTE 5 (AGO5) gene, which inhibited the
  initiation of female gametophyte development, caused the FM to stagnate at FG1 stage
  and could not undergo mitosis, and the female gametophyte could not form normally.
