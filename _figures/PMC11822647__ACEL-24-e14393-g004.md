caption: 'A schematic image shows the role of neuronal CTSS in the process of aging
  and Alzheimer''s disease (AD). Left: In young and healthy mice, neuronal CTSS can
  induce the secretion of CX3CL1 by neurons and acts on CX3CR1 receptors in microglia,
  which degrades proteins along the endocytic pathway; Right: In aging and AD model
  mice, the expression level of neuronal CTSS was significantly elevated in neurons,
  which increases neuroinflammation and causes cognitive decline via CX3CL1‐CX3CR1
  axis and JAK2‐STAT3 pathway. LY 3000328, the selective inhibitor of CTSS, LY3000328,
  significantly rescues AD‐related pathological features in APP/PS1 mice'
