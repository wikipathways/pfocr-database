caption: A putative model for the formation of stable and labile LTM of aversive (fear)
  and appetitive (drug) stimulus. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has a
  major role in synaptic plasticity associated with a) formation of fear memory and
  b) drugs of abuse. nNOS is linked to the NMDAR through PSD 95, and increased calcium
  influx activates nNOS (). The increased NO level stimulates the soluble guanylate
  cyclase (sGC) leading to cGMP-mediated activation of PKG which subsequently stimulates
  ERK1/2. NO can induce histone acetylation and subsequent transcriptional activity
  through S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 (). This pathway is likely involved in consolidation
  labile of LTM. NO signaling may further modulate pCREB levels (,,), as depicted
  in ; transcription that develops through NO-pCREB pathway may also result in labile
  LTM. On the other hand, other downstream NMDAR signaling molecules as well as D1/D5
  dopamine receptors may activate PKA signaling molecules which are recruited for
  the formation of a stable LTM. This alternate pathway (left side) may involve PKA/ERK/pCREB/CBP
  (CREB binding protein); CBP is a main histone acetyltransferase involved in consolidation
  of LTM (). Transcriptional activity through this pathway may be different than that
  generated through the NO signaling pathway; as a result the memory strength encoded
  by each pathway could be different.
