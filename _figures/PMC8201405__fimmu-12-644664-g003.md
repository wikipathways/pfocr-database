caption: Recognition of HSV–1 by PRRs (pattern recognition receptors) activates interferon
  (IFN) and cytokine production. PRRs include toll–like receptors TLR2, TLR9 and TLR3.
  (A) TLR2 recognizes HSV–1 glycoprotein B (gB), promoting NF–κB activation and the
  secretion of interleukin (IL)–8 through the MyD88/TRAF6–dependent signaling pathway.
  Subsequent degradation of I–κBα (an inhibitor of NF–κB) allows NF–κB to translocate
  to the nucleus. TLR2 also signals through TRIF–related adaptor molecule (TRAM) and
  MyD88 for IFN production. (B) TLR9 senses viral DNA, which contains unmethylated
  CpG motifs. TLR9 is dependent on IRAK–4 and MyD88–dependent pathways. MyD88 and
  TRAF6 resulting in the activation of the NF–κB pathway for downstream cytokine secretion.
  TLR9 activation also signals IRF7, which produces type I IFNs. (C) TLR3 recognizes
  dsRNA, which are produced during viral replication. TLR3 activates MyD88–independent
  signaling cascade through the Toll/IL1 receptor domain, containing adaptor inducing
  IFNβ (TRIF) and TRAF3, resulting in IRF3/7 translocating to the nucleus, for the
  production of type I IFNs. TLR3 also signals TRIF and TRAF6, resulting in NF–κB
  activation.
