caption: Heterotropic cooperativity in eIF4E and the translational initiation cycle.
  A recent study has suggested testable models that can explain how p20 regulation
  (A) and cyclical eIF4F function (B) might be achieved (). Binding of eIF4G to eIF4E
  induces a high-affinity cap-binding state in eIF4E (A). This promotes 40S-mRNA interactions
  and ultimately translational initiation. p20 can bind to part of the eIF4G-binding
  site on eIF4E (Fig. ), potentially generating a dead-end complex unable to participate
  in the eIF4G-mediated initiation pathway. Since p20 binds with a lower affinity
  to eIF4E, it does not block translation but, rather, exerts fine regulation via
  competition with eIF4G for a shared site on eIF4E. Measurements of the relative
  binding affinities between these proteins () have provided the basis for understanding
  how a cyclical cap-eIF4E-binding pathway might function (B). The binding of eIF4G
  mediates both enhanced cap binding and association of the 40S ribosomal subunit.
  The relatively high affinity of eIF4G binding to eIF4E ensures that the latter binds
  to the 5′ cap almost exclusively as part of the eIF4F complex. Subsequently, and
  perhaps during scanning or as a result of 60S junction, a rearrangement of the preinitiation
  complex induces dissociation of eIF4E from eIF4G, which results in the loss of the
  high-affinity cap-binding state in eIF4E. As a result, eIF4E can be released relatively
  easily from the mRNA, thus becoming free to rebind eIF4G and thus restart another
  cycle. Reproduced from reference  with permission of the publisher.
