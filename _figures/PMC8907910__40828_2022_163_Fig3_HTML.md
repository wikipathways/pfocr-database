caption: 'Processing of protein antigens: the MHC-II pathway. Protein antigens are
  taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APC) into endosomes, which then fuse with
  lysosomes. There the proteins are broken down into protein fragments. After their
  synthesis in the ER, MHC-II molecules are transported in vesicles. Newly synthesized
  MHC-II molecules carry a peptide that occupies the antigen binding site and is called
  CLIP (class II invariant chain peptide). If both vesicles fuse, CLIP is released
  from the peptide binding site of the MHC-II by the protein DM and MHC-II can now
  bind antigen fragments. These MHC-II/peptide complexes are then transported to the
  cell membrane and can be recognized by CD4-positive cells ([] with kind permission)'
