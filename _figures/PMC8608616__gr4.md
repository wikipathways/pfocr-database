caption: ROS-regulated DUBs and its cellular signaling in cancer. Elevated ROS levels
  inside cells has been associated with pro-tumorigenic signaling and increased cell
  proliferation via many signaling cascades including NF-kB, MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT.
  Ubiquitination and deubiquitination events of downstream signaling molecules also
  regulate the fate of signaling cascades. ROS directly activates the IKK-based NF-κB-inducing
  signaling and also inactivate A20, Cezanne and CYLD which are negative regulators
  of NF-kB pathway. Binding of ligands to RTKs activate PI3K that produces PIP3 from
  PIP2, which is reversed by tumor suppressor PTEN through the phosphorylation circuit.
  PTEN is positively regulated by DUBs, USP11 and USP13. Direct ROS inhibition of
  PTEN or by ROS inactivation of USP11 and USP13 could be a possible DUB-mediated
  regulation of PI3K/AKT pathway in cancer. PHLPP1, a tumor suppressor inhibits AKT
  signaling and is positively regulated by USP1. ROS also regulate DUBs such as USP19,
  USP28 and OTUD7B that regulate HIF-1α. The MAPK/ERK pathway promote cell proliferation
  and cancer progression. The ROS-mediated control of the indicated DUBs such as USP11,
  USP13 and USP1 in several signaling cascades can also be a target of cancer therapeutics
  which need to be investigated.All the DUBs are underlined and represented in red
  text.PHLPP1, PH Domain and Leucine Rich Repeat Protein Phosphatase 1; PPP1CA, Protein
  Phosphatase 1 Catalytic Subunit Alpha; GLUT, Glucose transporters.
