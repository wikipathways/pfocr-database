caption: 'The overview of USP36-mediated signaling pathways. (A) Hippo/YAP signaling.
  USP36 stabilizes the YAP protein by inhibiting the polyubiquitination of the K48
  chain of the YAP protein. First, USP36 binds to the YAP protein to form a stable
  complex. Second, USP36 prevents the degradation of YAP protein by inhibiting the
  polyubiquitination of the K48 chain of YAP protein. Finally, stable YAP protein
  can continue to participate in the regulation of Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, thereby
  affecting the growth and differentiation of cells. (B) PRL1/Snail2 signaling. In
  glioblastoma (GBM), PRL1 promotes tumor invasion and metastasis by activating USP36-mediated
  deubiquitination of Snail2. (C) c-Myc/SOD2 signaling. Overexpression of USP36 is
  accompanied by increased levels of c-Myc and SOD2 proteins, attenuating ischemia-induced
  ubiquitination of these two proteins. (D) CEP63/YAP1 signaling. USP36 can promote
  YAP1 expression by binding to CEP63 and inhibiting K63 ubiquitination degradation
  of FXR1, thereby enhancing cancer stem cell properties. (E) ERK/AKT signaling. USP36
  regulates the stability of PM-1. Through deubiquitination, USP36 decreases the expression
  level of PME-1 and promotes the activation of ERK and Akt signaling pathways. (F)
  ALR/MDM2 signaling. MDM2 promotes the degradation of ALR proteins by ubiquitinating
  them, while USP36 maintains the stability of ALR proteins by removing ubiquitination
  modifications. (G) PARP1 signaling. Dox promotes the progression of DIC by activating
  USP36-mediated deubiquitination of PARP1. This figure was produced by Biorender
