caption: Alterations in the PI3K pathway in malignant B cells. In malignant B cells,
  several pathway players have been found to be over-expressed or hyper-phosphorylated.
  The figure illustrates signaling molecules whose expression, phosphorylation or
  activity are reported to be altered in malignant B cells (green indicates increased
  activity, red indicates reduced activity). Altered molecules discussed in the text
  include p110 subunits, Lyn, Syk, Btk, Akt, TC21, and the BCR signaling chain CD79b.
  The formation of a non-physiological complex between Lyn and Hsp90 in malignant
  B cells is indicated. Increased expression of microRNA species that target PTEN
  and SHIP are reported to reduce expression of these phosphatases. Moreover, the
  PTEN kinase CK2 is reported to be over-expressed which may diminish PTEN activity.
  ZAP-70 is expressed in some B cell malignancies, however the impact on the PI3K
  pathway is currently not clear.
