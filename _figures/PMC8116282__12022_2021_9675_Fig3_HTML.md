caption: Pseudohypoxia-driven PPGLs. The pseudo-hypoxia cluster of PPGL is traditionally
  associated to worse clinical outcome, but a closer look at the sub-stratification
  of this cluster reveals an association between mutations in genes implicated in
  the regulation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and increased metastatic potential,
  as opposed to TCA cycle non-aberrant PPGLs within the same cluster. While both subgroups
  activate the HIF signaling pathway, TCA cycle mutated tumors also exhibit epigenetic
  dysregulation as a consequence of the accumulation of onco-metabolites (fumarate,
  succinate, and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) derivatives. The risk of metastatic events
  among patients with pseudohypoxia-driven PPGLs is much higher in TCA cycle aberrant
  cases (40.5% of patients) than in TCA cycle non-aberrant cases (11.2% of patients)
