caption: A schematic model for the salinity tolerance mechanisms in Supreme versus
  the salinity tolerance mechanisms in Parish. Numbers indicated are intracellular
  and extracellular Na+ concentrations. ROS detoxification and maintaining K+ uptake
  under salt stress are two common mechanisms for salinity tolerance in both cultivars.
  High Na+ levels in Supreme under normal and salt-treated conditions lower the water
  potential, preventing water loss. Moreover, an array of salt stress inducible transcription
  factors is highly expressed in Supreme under normal conditions, possibly induced
  by the Ca2+signaling pathway due to Na+ accumulation under normal conditions, making
  Supreme prepared for salt stress
