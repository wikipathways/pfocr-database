caption: MicroRNAs involved in aromatase regulation in breast cancer. (A) Role of
  MIR155 upregulating aromatase levels via mRNA degradation of SLC16A3 gene encoding
  monocarboxylate transporter 4 protein (MCT4) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1)
  gene increasing letrozole resistance in ER-positive breast cancer. (B) Role of MIR221/222
  in upregulating aromatase level by activating β-catenin pathway contributing to
  increased fluvestrate resistance in breast cancer cells. (C) Role of MIR128-1 in
  upregulating aromatase level by activating transforming growth factor receptor-1
  (TGFβ-R1) pathway, which initiates cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation and fibrosis.
