caption: 'Metabolic pathway for transformation of glycerol in L. reuteri. Proposed
  metabolic pathway for biotransformation of glycerol to 3HP and 1,3PDO via 3HPA as
  intermediate by resting cells of Lactobacillus reuteri. The different enzymes and
  co-factors involved are shown. Enzymes: [] B12-depdendent glycerol/diol dehydratase
  (PduCDE), [] 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase (PduQ), [] propionaldehyde dehydrogenase
  (PduP), [] phosphotransacylase (PduL), and [] propionate kinase (PduW). νi represent
  the specific reaction rate.'
