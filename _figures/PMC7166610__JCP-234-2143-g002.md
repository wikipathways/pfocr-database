caption: 'Illustration of virus activation of IFN‐I synthesis and its inhibition by
  the MERS‐CoV M, 4a, 4b and PLP proteins. M protein interacts with TRAF3 and suppresses
  IRF3 activity. 4a protein interacts with PACT and inhibits activation of RIG‐I and
  MDA5. 4b protein is unlikely to be a potent inhibitor of the NF‐κB signalling pathway.
  PLPs are known to have the ability to remove ISG15 conjugates from cellular substrates
  and reduce the levels of ubiquitinated and ISGylated host cell proteins. IFN: interferon;
  IRF: interferon regulatory factor; ISG: interferon‐stimulated gene; MDA: melanoma
  differentiation associated protein; MERS‐CoV: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus;
  NF‐κB: nuclear factor‐κB; RIG‐I: cytoplasmic retinoic acid‐inducible gene I; TRAF: TNF
