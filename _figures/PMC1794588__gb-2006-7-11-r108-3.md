caption: 'Small subnetwork identified for the shift from glucose to ethanol as carbon
  source. Genes marked red are upregulated and genes marked green are downregulated
  upon the shift. The metabolic map is simplified (many transport reactions are not
  included and the two steps of the glycoxylate pathway [encoded by the genes acuD
  and acuE] are placed in the mitochondria even though they are really located in
  the glyoxysomes). Conversions that involve several steps are indicated by dashed
  arrows. The metabolites are as follows: ACCOA, acetyl-CoA; ACE, acetate; ACHO, acetaldehyde;
  CIT, citrate; F16BP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; G6P,
  glucose 6-phosphate; GLY, glyoxylate; ICIT, isocitrate; MAL, malate; OAA, oxaloacetate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PYR, pyruvate; SUC, succinate.'
