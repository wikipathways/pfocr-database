caption: 'Structures of central metabolic pathways in (a) Escherichia coli and (b)
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The backbone models for E. coli (iBKEco52: an iBioKE.
  coli metabolic model containing 52 reactions) and S. cerevisiae (iBKSce50) were
  reconstructed on the basis of these pathways. The black and blue lines represent
  irreversible and reversible reactions, respectively. The structure of the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) is simplified in the figure. The metabolite for the carbon
  source (glucose) and fermentation products are described in plain black font. The
  metabolic pathways for the biosynthesis of each higher alcohol are shown in red.
  Abbreviations: AcCoA (acetyl-CoA), OAA (oxaloacetate), PYR (pyruvate), Suc (succinate),
  and 3 MB (3-methyl-1-butanol).'
