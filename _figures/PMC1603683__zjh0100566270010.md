caption: 'Deregulation of the PI3K-Akt-GSK-3β pathway and neurodegeneration in NPC:
  a hypothesis. Activation of PI3K/Akt by the cytokine TNF-α or other factors, induces
  the phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3β in neurons, which in turn 1) impairs
  nuclear import of p65, 2) decreases the processing of p105 to p50, and 3) reduces
  proteasome (prot)-mediated degradation of p50. The net result would be a deficiency
  in p65/p50 nuclear dimers of NF-κB and decreased transcription of trophic factors,
  anti-apoptotic factors, and anti-oxidant protein/enzymes, which would lead to neurodegeneration.
  In addition, inactivation of GSK-3β may also be involved in autophagy, impairment
  in axonal trafficking, and formation of dystrophic neurites. On the other hand,
  cytokines and ATP released from damaged neurons bind to receptors that are specifically
  expressed in glia and activate NF-κB, which would induce glial proliferation and
  production of cytokines and free radicals that further facilitate neurodegeneration.
  Arrows indicate stimulating and ⊥ signs indicate inhibitory effects; thicker solid
  lines indicate enhanced, whereas broken lines indicate decreased levels of activation
  in NPC.'
