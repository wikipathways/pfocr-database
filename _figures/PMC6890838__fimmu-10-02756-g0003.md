caption: Mutant proteasomes from CANDLE/PRAAS subjects have a potential pro-inflammatory
  potential due to the negative impact they exert on mTORC1. The decreased degradation
  capacity of cells carrying CANDLE/PRAAS proteasomes results in amino acid deficiency
  which causes engagement of the integrative stress response (ISR). In this pathway,
  the GCN2 kinase intersects with the UPR by phosphorylating eIF2α, thus promoting
  the upregulation of ATF4 and the subsequent transcription of various inhibitors
  of the mTORC1 complex including REDD1, TRIB83, SESN2 and 4E-BP1, as indicated. In
  addition, the drop in intracellular levels of free amino acids is directly sensed
  by mTORC1, resulting in its downregulation. Decreased mTORC1 activity is accompanied
  by excessive mitophagy and a potential metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylations
  to anaerobic glycolysis. This results in the fragmentation of the tricarboxylic
  (TCA) cycle and parallel accumulation of pro-inflammatory metabolites as citrate
  and succinate. Besides, the suppression of mTORC1 signaling leads to cholesterol
  deficiency which has been shown to act as a danger signal initiating a type I IFN
  response following sensing by STING1.
