caption: The pathway is reconstituted based on the metabolites observed in the untreated
  N. fowleri (shown in bold) and treated with the CYP51 (shown in green), SMT (in
  blue) and ERG2 (in dark red) inhibitors. Metabolites not observed in the wild-type
  N. fowleri are depicted in thin lines. The cholesterol arm of the pathway is highlighted
  by the yellow-green background, the ergosterol arm is highlighted by the blue background.
  Enclosed in frame are potential SMT substrates. Enzymes interrogated in these studies
  are labeled in colors corresponding to the accumulating metabolites. Numbering of
  atoms in sterol molecule is adapted from Nes and Venkatramesh, 1994.[] Sterol labelling
  is as in . ERG enzyme nomenclature is according to the convention for S. cerevisiae.
