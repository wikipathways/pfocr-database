caption: The ADSCs-Exo pathway reduces pyroptosis and improves tissue regeneration
  in the liver, which has been injured by ischemia-reperfusion and partial resection.
  The findings reveal that ADSCs-Exo suppresses the NF-κB signaling pathway while
  activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. If the liver is injured severely,
  an inflammatory reaction occurs, which inhibits hepatocyte proliferation. After
  transplanting ADSCs-Exo, NF-κB phosphorylation is blocked, and the creation of inflammation
  and activation of GSDMD is not stimulated. ADSCs-Exo, on the other hand, can activate
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and -catenin translocates into the nucleus, enhancing
  Cyclin D1 expression and driving cell proliferation. Finally, ADSCs-Exo helps to
  prevent cell injury while also promoting tissue regeneration and functional recovery.
