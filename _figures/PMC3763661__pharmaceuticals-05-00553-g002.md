caption: Current gene therapy treatments for PD. In each panel (A–D), the nigrostriatal
  (NS) neuron cell bodies (diamond shapes) are shown within the substantia nigra pars
  compacta (SNc), with normal (black), degenerating (gray), and degenerated (white)
  perikarya and axons projecting to the putamen. The reciprocal striatonigral pathway
  is depicted (orange dashed arrow). Typically, NS dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons
  (black diamond) influence putamenal neurons. Excitatory putamenal neurons (black
  circles and arrows) project to the globus pallidus, where inhibitory neurons (white
  circles and arrows) are activated. Inhibitory tone from the globus pallidus suppresses
  excitatory output from the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and thereby maintains normal
  motor control. In PD, the loss of excitatory DAergic input to the putamen, therefore
  leads to a relative increase output from the STN, leading to motor dysfunction.
  (A) GAD gene therapy. Stereotactic delivery (yellow arrow) of AAV2-GAD (green circle)
  into the bilateral STN allows increased local GABA production, thereby inhibiting
  excitatory STN output and improving motor system dysfunction; (B) AADC gene therapy.
  AAV2-AADC (yellow circle) delivery to the bilateral putamen replaces lost AADC.
  Re-establishing the DAergic stimulation of striatal neurons helps normalize the
  motor feedback loop through globus pallidus and STN; (C) NTRN gene therapy. AAV2-NTRN
  (and GDNF) (blue circle) delivery provides local production of NTRN and enhances
  residual DAergic cell function within the putamen. Retrograde transport of AAV2-NTRN
  within residual intact DAergic nigral neurons, as well as anterograde transport
  of AAV2-NTRN via the striatonigral pathway (dashed orange arrow) to the SNc, further
  improves DAergic neuronal function and survival. Injection of vector into SN is
  not shown but would increase the amount of AAV2-NTRN within the SN, independent
  of the anterograde transport pathway; (D) AADC+ gene therapy. Lentiviral (LV) vector
  delivery, carrying the tripartite gene construct for the dopamine biosynthetic enzymes
  (TH/GCH1/AADC) (red circle), allows restoration of excitatory DAergic tone within
  the putamen.
