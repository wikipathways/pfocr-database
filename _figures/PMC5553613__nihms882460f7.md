caption: In the presence of sufficient amino acids, mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosome
  and activated through the actions of the Rag GTPases, the Ragulator complex, and
  the V-ATPase. Active mTORC1 inhibits the initiation of autophagy. In the absence
  of amino acids, mTORC1 is inactive and autophagy is upregulated. This pathway can
  be modulated by the Gator1 complex and AMPK signaling. Autophagic degradation of
  membranous organelles releases FAs that are selectively channeled into DGAT1-dependent
  LDs, which form clusters of LDs in close proximity to mitochondria. These new LDs
  are degraded by ATGL-mediated lipolysis, presumably supplying FAs to mitochondria
  for energy. These LDs also sequester FA in TAG, preventing acylcarnitine accumulation,
  which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction.
