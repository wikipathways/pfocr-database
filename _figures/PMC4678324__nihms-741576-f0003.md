caption: Cell-intrinsic versus cell-extrinsic control of metastatic progression by
  miRNAs. (a) The let-7-regulatory network suppresses metastasis by inhibiting the
  cell-intrinsic phenotype of cancer cell invasion. Direct targeting of HMGA2 and
  BACH1 by let-7 leads to transcriptional suppression of a set of pro-invasive genes.
  Let-7 is regulated by LIN-28, a miRNA-binding protein that destabilizes the let-7
  pre-miRNA and ultimately promotes metastasis. RKIP, an indirect repressor of LIN-28,
  suppresses metastasis through upregulation of let-7-. (b) miR-126 halts metastasis
  by impairing the cell-extrinsic ability of breast cancer cells to recruit endothelial
  cells into the metastatic niche. Cancer-expressed miR-126 coordinately targets PITPNC1,
  IGFBP2, and MERTK. Cancer cell-secreted IGFBP2 promotes endothelial cell migration
  by binding to endothelial IGF1-R, while PITPNC1 induces IGFBP2 expression. In parallel
  to this IGFBP2-driven pathway, cancer cell-cleaved MERTK ectodomain increases endothelial
  cell migration by binding and sequestering Gas-6—an extracellular factor that inhibits
  endothelial cell migration through its action on endothelial MERTK receptors. (c)
  Three miRNAs—miR-199a-3p, miR-199a-5p, and miR-1908—promote melanoma metastasis
  by convergent targeting of DNAJA4 and ApoE. DNAJA4 suppresses metastasis by inducing
  ApoE expression. Melanoma cell-secreted ApoE halts metastatic progression by both
  cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. ApoE suppresses melanoma cell
  invasion by targeting melanoma LRP1 receptors, while its inhibition of endothelial
  cell migration results from its engagement of endothelial LRP8 receptors.
