caption: Model for the role of RIPS-1 methyltransferase in the mitochondrial and cytosolic
  vitamin B12-dependent pathways. Adenosyl cobalamin (B12) is required in the conversion
  of TCA cycle-dependent propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This process includes the
  isomerisation of d-methylmalonyl-CoA to l-methylmalonyl-CoA and is catalysed by
  the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (MCE-1), followed by the B12-dependent methyl
  malonyl-CoA mutase (MMCM-1) conversion to succinyl-CoA that feeds directly into
  the TCA cycle. In conditions where B12 is depleted or MCE-1 or MMCM-1 are disrupted,
  this pathway is interrupted and propionyl-CoA is converted into toxic propionate
  (and the acdh-1prom::GFP marker is induced). Methyl cobalamin (vitamin B12) is also
  required for the folate and methionine cycles in the cytosol by acting as an essential
  co-factor for the methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (methionine
  synthetase) enzyme (METR-1). This enzyme demethylates methyl tetrahydrofolate (methyl
  THF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF) in the folate cycle and methylates homocysteine to
  methionine in the methionine cycle. Methionine can be further converted to S-adenosyl
  methionine (SAM) then gets demethylated to S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH). This demethylation
  reaction is a major source of methyl groups that is catalysed by S-adenosyl methionine
  methyltransferases including RIPS-1. The final step of the methionine cycle involves
  the conversion of SAH to homocysteine, which can ultimately feed into the TCA cycle
  via cystathionine, alpha-ketobutyrate, and propionyl-CoA. Thiol-reducing agents,
  including DTT, induce the S-adenosyl methionine methyltransferase RIPS-1. The vitamin
  B12-dependent reactions including methionine synthetase become rate-limiting, and
  in the absence of B12 supplementation, thiol-reducing agents cause developmental
  defects and lethality in C. elegans
