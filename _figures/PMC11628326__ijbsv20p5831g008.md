caption: Bile acid derivatives from gut microbiota promote GBPs-mediated activation
  of caspase-4/11 by LPS through lncRNA57RIK. BA metabolites such as DCA induce lncRNA57RIK
  expression through SIPR2 mediated signal pathways, which can be promoted by H3K4me3
  enrichments. The generated LncRNA57RIK can mediate the binding of caspase-4/11 with
  GBP1 induced by IFNγ to transfer LPS onto caspase-4/11, and finally activate caspase-4/11
  to cause IL-1β maturation and cellular pyroptosis
