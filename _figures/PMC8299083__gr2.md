caption: 'Benzoxazinoid biosynthetic pathway in maizeBenzoxazinoid biosynthesis begins
  in the chloroplast by the conversion of indole-3-glycerol phosphate (an intermediate
  of tryptophan biosynthesis) into indole, catalyzed by the indole-3-glycerol phosphate
  lyase benzoxazinoneless 1 (BX1). A subsequent stepwise introduction of four oxygen
  atoms by the P450 monooxygenases BX2, BX3, BX4, and BX5 leads to the formation of
  2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIBOA). DIBOA is a substrate for the UDP-glucosyltransferases
  BX8 and BX9, which convert the toxic compound DIBOA into the stable glucoside (Glc)
  form DIBOA-Glc. The 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (2ODD) BX6 catalyzes a
  hydroxylation of DIBOA-Glc at C-7, followed by a methylation of the introduced hydroxyl
  group catalyzed by the O-methyltransferase BX7, yielding DIMBOA-Glc in the cytosol.
  An O-methylation reaction catalyzed by a group of three O-methyltransferases (BX10,
  BX11, and BX12) converts DIMBOA-Glc to 2-hydroxy-4,7-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one
  glucoside (HDMBOA-Glc). BX13, a BX6-like 2-ODD, catalyzes the conversion of DIMBOA-Glc
  to 2,4,7-trihydroxy-8-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one glucoside (TRIMBOA-Glc). TRIMBOA-Glc
  can be O-methylated by BX7 to form 2,4-dihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one
  glucoside (DIM2BOA-Glc), which can be further methylated by the O-methyltransferase
  BX14 to generate 2-hydroxy-4,7,8-trimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one glucoside (HDM2BOA-Glc).
  BX14 can also produce HDMBOA-Glc from DIMBOA-Glc. The benzoxazinoid glucosides (Bx-Glc)
  are stored in the vacuole, where they are protected from β-glucosidases located
  in the chloroplast and cell wall. Upon cell disruption (e.g., by herbivory), the
  Bx-Glc are exposed to the β-glucosidases, which cleave the glucosyl group, generating
  bioactive aglucons.Abbreviations: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TRIBOA-Glc, 2,4,7-trihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one
  glucoside.'
