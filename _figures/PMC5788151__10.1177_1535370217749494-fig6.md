caption: Illustrating diagram for several growth factors and signaling molecules that
  regulate different stages of satellite cells. Transition from quiescence into activation
  and proliferation is stimulated by HGF and inhibited by myostatin (GDF-8). IGF-II
  induces proliferation. IGF-I can induce both proliferation and differentiation.
  HGF and NOTCH sustain proliferation and inhibit transition to differentiation. Transition
  to differentiation is also inhibited by Rb protein through activating Ras/ERK pathway.
  Transition to differentiation can be induced either directly by the Wnt family of
  proteins, or indirectly via inhibition of the Ras/ERK pathway by Sprouty, IMP, Raf-1
  KIP, and DA-Raf1. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)
