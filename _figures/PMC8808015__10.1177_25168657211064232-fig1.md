caption: Signaling pathways involved in CHD. In normal conditions, the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway is kept inactive as the β-catenin is complex with APC/Axin complex. When
  the Wnt or other specific ligands bind with membrane receptors, including frizzled
  and Ror, or by situations in which APC/Axin become unstable, cascades become activated
  and increase the free form of β-catenin and is not being phosphorylated, leading
  to accumulation in the cytoplasm. Eventually, this free β-catenin is associated
  with nuclease and promotes the expression of several Wnt target genes. APC helps
  Axin phosphorylate β-catenin and subsequent degradation of β-catenin through ubiquitination
  if the cell remains inactive. Wnt/β-catenin non-canonical signaling pathway is transduced
  independent from β-catenin activation. After ligation, Dvl utilizing Daam 1 activates
  Rho kinase (RhoA). Dvl also activates CaMK, calcineurin, and PKC, resulting in subsequent
  activation of JNK. The integrity of these pathways leading to cytoskeletal changes
  and stimulation of cell polarization and mutilations during gastrulation.
