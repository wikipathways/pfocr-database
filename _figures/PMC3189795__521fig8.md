caption: Proposed mechanism. Both H2S and HCN can inhibit electron transport. Electron
  transport inhibition causes induction of HIF-1 activity resulting in high expression
  of SQRD-1 and CYSL-2. SQRD-1 catalyzes the first step in the H2S-oxidation pathway,
  ultimately resulting in production of sulfate and thiosulfate. CYSL-2 catalyzes
  the first step in the HCN assimilation pathway, producing H2S. The resultant H2S
  is detoxified by CYSL-1.
