caption: Proposed estrogen receptor (ER)-activated signaling pathways involved in
  vasodilation. 17β-Estradiol (E2) can activate a subpopulation of ER at the plasma
  membrane (mER) that interacts with adaptor proteins (adaptor) and signaling molecules
  such as c-Src (1), which is critical for down-stream ER-induced signaling via PI3K/Akt
  and MAPK pathways. E2 also binds to the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPER,
  which is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (2). GPER activates downstream
  effectors, such as adenylate cyclase (resulting in cAMP production), and c-Src.
  c-Src, in turn, activates matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), which cleave pro-heparin-bound-epidermal
  growth factor receptors (EGFR). EGFR leads to multiple downstream events, including
  activation of MAPK and PI3K. Once activated, PI3K can induce NO generation by NO
  synthase (NOS) in vascular endothelial (eNOS) or smooth muscle cells (nNOS). Membrane
  permeant NO, in turn, activates guanylate cyclase (resulting in cGMP production).
  The NO/cGMP pathway is involved in acute vasodilator mechanisms, such as protein
  kinase G (PKG)-dependent regulation of myosin light chain phosphorylation, and activation
  of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channels. E2 also regulates
  cellular gene expression either via binding of ER dimers in the promotor region
  of target genes (3), through interaction of ER with other classes of transcription
  factors (TF) (4), or by regulation of TF phosphorylation (5). Target genes regulating
  vascular homeostasis include NOS and inflammatory cytokines. Adapted from Mol Cell
