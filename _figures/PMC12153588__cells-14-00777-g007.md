caption: 'Schematic representation of the JAK-STAT pathway’s dual role in regulating
  cytoskeletal dynamics through transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms.
  Activated by FGF-FGFR signaling, STAT proteins transcriptionally control Rho GTPases
  (e.g., via STAT6-dependent RhoA promoter activity) to influence actin remodeling
  and cell migration, while STAT1/3 balance Rac/Cdc42 activity. Non-transcriptionally,
  STAT3 interacts with stathmin in axons to stabilize microtubules, counteracted by
  inhibitory GSK3β and ROCKII phosphorylation post-injury. STAT signaling enhances
  neurofilament organization and intermediate filament dynamics, thereby supporting
  axonal guidance. Red arrows: the sequence of signals activation'
