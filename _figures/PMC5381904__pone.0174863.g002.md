caption: All 106 differentially regulated kinases were analyzed by integrated pathway
  analysis using IPA. The posttranslational modification cell cycle, cellular assembly
  and organization, one of the most dominant networks, is depicted here. Signaling
  pathways are colored according to expression, green representing down-regulation
  and red representing up-regulation with the expression fold change represented by
  more intense colors.
