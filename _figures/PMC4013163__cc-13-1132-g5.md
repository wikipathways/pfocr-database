caption: Figure 5. Canonical pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in
  MCF-7/MET-R cell populations chronically adapted to grow in the presence of metformin.
  Using the “canonical pathways” feature of the IPA global functional analysis, we
  were able to identify metformin response-related pathways that were significantly
  impacted in metformin-refractory MCF-7/MET-R cells when compared with metformin-naïve
  MCF-7 parental cells. Figure shows 2 selected canonical pathways with the lowest
  P value differentially activated (left panel) or deactivated (right panel) in MCF-7
  cells upon acquisition of resistance to metformin.
