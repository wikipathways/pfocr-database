caption: Extracellular MIF binds to the cell surface receptor complex, which consists
  of CXCR2/CXCR4 and CD74. CD74 interacts with CD44, which mediates signal transduction
  through MAPK/ERK. ERK has been reported to repress the mTOR complex via the PI3K/Akt
  pathway to induce the formation of autophagosomes, which later fuse with lysosomes
  to become autophagolysosomes and degrade proteins. Both MIF-induced junction protein
  translocation and degradation could increase vascular permeability.
