caption: Key contributions of the UPS to the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway
  in response to LPS. Depicted is the NF-B pathway emanating from the cell surface
  receptor TLR4 upon LPS binding. NF-κB signalling relies on the upstream E3 ubiquitin
  ligase TRAF6 which catalyzes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains which themselves activate
  the TAK kinase complex. Activated TAK1 phosphorylates the downstream heterotrimeric
  IKK kinase complex whose full activation further requires the generation of Met1-linked
  linear polyubiquitin chains by LUBAC. Once activated, IKK promotes the phosphorylation
  of κBα and its subsequent proteasomal degradation following its K48-ubiquitination
  by SCFTRCP, thereby allowing NF-κB nuclear translocation. Genes induced by NF-κB
  include those coding for deubiquitinating enzymes Otulin and A20 which ensure a
  negative feedback loop by trimming linear and K63-polyubiquitin chains.
