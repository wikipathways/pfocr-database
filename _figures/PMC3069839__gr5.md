caption: 'Regulation of Atm pathway genes after Rif-Phen-MCT. A: Expression of genes
  in normal liver from the array of 84 genes studied ( describes gene symbols). Genes
  in gray boxes were absent from the array studied. Genes in pink boxes were expressed.
  B: Down-regulated genes (green boxes) and up-regulated genes (red boxes) compared
  with normal liver 3 days after Rif-Phen-MCT. These changes in gene expression were
  similar 1 or 7 days after drug treatments. In particular, Atm expression declined
  with evidence for impaired protection against DNA damage, leading to activation
  of p21 and growth-arrest of damaged cells. Specific pathways in differentially expressed
  gene lists were mapped (PathwayStudio 5.0; Aridane Genomics, Rockville, MD).'
