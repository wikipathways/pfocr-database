caption: Insulin crosstalk with immune signalling pathways in macrophages. PAMPs/DAMPs
  trigger surface and endosomal TLRs, signalling largely via MyD88 to NF-kB to drive
  cytokine production, proliferation, and scavenger receptor expression. InsR/IGF1R
  signals through MAPK and Akt/mTORC1 to boost cytokine production and proliferation,
  supporting the TLR response. These signalling events also drive downstream metabolic
  programming to support the redox balance and energetic demands, promoting an inflammatory
  phenotype. Activation of mTORC1 also blocks autophagy, which provides substrates
  for OXPHOS. Various points of crosstalk exist between InsR, PRRs, cytokine receptor,
  and nutrient sensing responses can also drive insulin resistance via negative feedback
  mechanisms (dotted lines), for example in cases of chronic hyperinsulinemia. The
  degree to which each intersecting pathway is stimulated likely determines the nature
  of the pleiotropic phenotypes seen in IR macrophages. PAMPs, Pathogen-associated
  molecular patters; DAMPs, Damage-associated molecular patterns; OXPHOS, Oxidative
  phosphorylation; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; TLR, Toll-like receptor; MyD88,
