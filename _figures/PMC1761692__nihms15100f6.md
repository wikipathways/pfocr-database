caption: A proposed model for PMT action on Gq-mediated mitogenic signaling. In this
  model, activation of Gq protein by either PMT or Gq-coupled receptors, such as α1A-AR
  or α-thrombin receptor, results in activation of PLCβ1, as well as transactivation
  of the EGF receptor via Gαq subunit and inhibition of the PDGF receptor. In HEK-293
  cells and cardiac fibroblasts, subsequent activation of the Erk1/2 cascade is mediated
  predominantly via Gαq transactivation of the Ras-dependent EGF receptor tyrosin
  kinase pathway, with no significant contribution derived from the PLCβ1-dependent
  activation of the PKC pathway. In cardiomyocytes, PMT stimulates via the Gαq-PLCβ1
  pathway both Ca2+-dependent PKCα and novel nPKCs (PKCδ and PKCε), which in turn
  lead to activation of the Erk1/2, as well as p38 MAPK and JNK cascades. PMT both
  inhibits PDGF receptor-dependent PI 3-kinase (PI3K) activation and prevents subsequent
  activation of the Akt-dependent survival pathway.
