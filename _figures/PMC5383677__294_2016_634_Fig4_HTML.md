caption: The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint contributes to the DNA Damage Response. Molecular
  diagram showing the pathways that block anaphase in response to genotoxic stress.
  Our results place the SAC as a redundant control that blocks chromosome segregation
  even in the absence of an S phase checkpoint response. In grey, regulatory pathway
  taken from previous works
