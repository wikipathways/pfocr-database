caption: High ALDOA expression leads to AMPK inhibition and YAP unphosphorylation.
  Unphophorylated YAP translocates into the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional
  co-activator by binding to the TEAD family of transcription factors. The YAP-TEAD
  complex triggers its target genes (CTGF and AREG) expression that promote cell proliferation
  and migration. Under low expression of ALDOA, cellular ATP formation is decreased
  due to low glycolysis. A decreased ratio of ATP/ADP leads to phosphorylation of
  AMPK. Knockdown of ALDOA can also trigger the formation of v-ATPase-Ragulator-AXIN/LKB1
  complex, which activates AMPK in an AMP/ADP-independent manner. Activated AMPK then
  phosphorylates YAP, promoting its binding to 14-3-3, thus resulting in its cytoplasmic
  localization and functional inactivation. Moreover, phosphorylated YAP is also targeted
  for ubiquitylation and degradation
