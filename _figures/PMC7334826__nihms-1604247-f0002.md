caption: Canonical cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathways involved in aquaporin-2 (AQP2)
  trafficking. When vasopressin (VP) binds to the vasopressin receptor type 2 (V2R),
  a G protein–coupled receptor, the Gs (stimulatory) subunit of the G protein activates
  adenylyl cyclase (AC), which in turn hydrolyzes ATP to increase intracellular cAMP.
  cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA) by dissociating its catalytic and regulatory
  subunits, and PKA then phosphorylates AQP2. A major effect of AQP2 phosphorylation
  is to decrease its rate of endocytosis, but phosphorylation is not necessary for
  the constitutive recycling and insertion of AQP2 into the plasma membrane. VP treatment
  of cells also increases the rate of exocytosis, but this is not AQP2 phosphorylation
  dependent, and the mechanism remains unclear. This combination of decreased endocytosis
  and increased exocytosis upon VP exposure results in a net accumulation of AQP2
  in the plasma membrane, thus increasing transepithelial water permeability. This
  schema highlights the potential therapeutic targets along this canonical signaling
  pathway to increase AQP2 membrane accumulation and increase water permeability and
  reabsorption. Similar to VP, calcitonin, secretin, glucagon, serotonin, EP2, and
  EP4 all activate Gs and trigger a similar signaling pathway to stimulate AQP2 membrane
  trafficking. P2Y12R and EP3 are Gi (inhibitory regulating G protein) receptors,
  and their antagonists will remove the inhibitory signal that blocks AC activity.
  Angiotensin II activates AT1R, which belongs to the family of Gq-linked receptors;
  it activates the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway and increases cAMP levels.
  Inhibiting the degradation of cAMP to AMP using phosphodiesterase inhibitors such
  as cilostamide or rolipram increases cAMP levels and could induce AQP2 membrane
  accumulation. In the resting state, PKA catalytic subunits are tethered by A kinase–anchoring
  proteins (AKAPs). An increase in intracellular cAMP causes dissociation of the AKAP-PKA
  complex, releasing PKA catalytic subunits. Using the AKAP-PKA disruptor FMP-API-1,
  PKA substrates, including AQP2, are phosphorylated, increasing AQP2 membrane accumulation.
  PKA also acts in the nucleus by phosphorylating CREB, which in turn activates AQP2
  gene transcription, raising AQP2 levels within the cell over several hours.
