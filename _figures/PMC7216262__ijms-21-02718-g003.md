caption: 'This figure illustrates how activity from the mTOR signaling pathway contributes
  to axon regeneration in the selected examples of retinal nerve damage (a) and spinal
  cord injury (b,c): (a) Concerning retinal nerve regeneration, mTOR activity enhances
  axon elongation and survival leading to functional regeneration. Signals that upregulate
  mTOR activity like PTEN inhibition, siRTP801, Pam3Cys (pro-inflammatory signal),
  CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic factor) or IGF-1 lead to axon recovery. TOR-independent
  axon recovery exists however as rapamycin-treated PTEN-deleted neurons and Pam3Cys
  untreated neurons still showed recovery. (b) For spinal cord injuries, mTORC1 activity
  in astrocytes hinders neuronal recovery with the formation of glial scars (gliosis).
  Growth factors like EGF (epidermal growth factor) can activate mTORC1. (c) On the
  contrary, mTORC1 signaling in hemisection spinal cord injuries promotes growth and
  functional regeneration.'
