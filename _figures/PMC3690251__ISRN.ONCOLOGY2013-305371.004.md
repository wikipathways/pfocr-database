caption: 'This figure describes the role of the P-TEFb complex in stabilizing RNA
  elongation. Panel (a) illustrates a nonpermissive state for RNA elongation. In this
  configuration, RNA pol II is associated with N-TEF, and the RNA pol II CTD is not
  phosphorylated. In this case, RNA transcription can start but stops prematurely.
  Panel (b) shows a state of transition, in which P-TEFb is about to substitute N-TEF
  in the transcription complex. P-TEFb contains the complex Cdk9/cyclin partner. Panel
  (c) exhibits a permissive state for RNA elongation. The presence of P-TEFb in the
  transcription complex phosphorylates the RNA pol II CTD, which, in turn, allows
  for the stabilization of the RNA transcript elongation. Abbreviations: RNA pol II:
  RNA polymerase II; N-TEF: negative transcription factor; CTD: carboxyl terminal
  domain of RNA pol II; P-TEFb: positive transcription factor b.'
