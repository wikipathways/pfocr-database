caption: Published studies showed that Dmp1 receives oncogenic signals from mutant
  Ras () or overexpressed HER2 () and directly transactivates the Arf promoter ().
  This p19Arf induction, in turn, neutralizes all the activities of Mdm2 and activates
  p53. Our study shows that the Dmp1 protein directly interacts with p53 and blocks
  the activities of Mdm2, especially in epithelial cells and T lymphocytes (). Dmp1
  also stabilizes p53 binding to transcriptional target genes (). These two mechanisms
  will act synergistically to boost the p53 activity to prevent tumorigenesis. The
  Dmp1 promoter has binding sites for Egr1 () and the transcription factor Egr1 is
  one of the target genes for Dmp1 that has tumor-suppressive activity (). Egr1 mediates
  p53-independent c-Myc-induced apoptosis via a non-canonical ARF-dependent transcriptional
  mechanism (, ). Both the Dmp1 and Arf promoter has numerous binding sites for Egr1
  where Egr proteins play critical roles in the Arf-C/EBPβ pathway () in oncogene-induced
  senescence. In addition Arf promotes sumoylation of several interacting proteins
  such as Egr1, topoisomerase I, Mdm2, and p53 (–) suggesting extensive crosstalks.
  Both PTEN and p53 are transcriptional targets for EGR1 (, ). In addition to Egr1-Dmp1-Arf-p53-Pten
  signaling, EGR1 transactivates the Fibronectin (FN) and TGFβ1 promoters for tumor
  suppression (). The signaling pathways that connect p53 and Dmp1α (negative feedback),
  DMP1β and RB are currently under investigation (discontinuous lines).
