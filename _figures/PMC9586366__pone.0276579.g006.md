caption: 'Mitochondrial use of citrate is mainly catabolic via sequential oxidative
  decarboxylation reactions while cytosolic utilization of citrate yields anabolic
  precursors. Metabolic reprogramming in KRas-driven cancer cells changes the fate
  of citrate from mitochondrial catabolism to the anabolic ACLY pathway. Blocking
  ACLY in combination with blocking GOT disturbs the reprogramming in KRas-driven
  cancer cells creating a synthetic lethal situation where cancer cells harboring
  KRas mutations undergo apoptotic cell death. Additional abbreviations: ACLYi, ACLY
  inhibitor (SB-204990); Cyto, cytoplasm; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; GA3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate; Mito, mitochondrion.'
