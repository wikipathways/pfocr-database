caption: Treg cells suppressive mechanisms. Treg cells inhibit the proliferation and
  effects of NKs through membrane-bound TGF-β, mainly including inhibiting the expression
  of the latter’s surface protein NKG20 and the production of IFN-γ. Treg cells can
  inhibit the secretion of IL-5 and IL-13 by ILC2 in an ICOS/ICOSL-dependent manner,
  thereby inhibiting its function. Treg cells can inhibit conventional T cells (Tcons)
  action in many ways. 1) Treg cells can produce anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10,
  IL-35, and TGFβ) affecting Tcons; 2) they can release perforin and granzyme, which
  damage the target cell membrane leading to apoptosis; 3) Treg cells can also sequester,
  by the high expression of CD25, IL-2 from the microenvironment reducing effector
  Tcons proliferation; 4) Treg cells can quickly inhibit TCR-induced Ca2+, NFAT, and
  NF-κB signaling; 5) indirectly inhibiting Tcons by reducing the expression of CD80/CD86
  on DCs through CTLA-4 (inhibit DC antigen presentation function) or disrupting the
  microenvironment in the immunological synapse provided by DCs (essential for T cell
  proliferation); 6) The expression of CD39 on Treg cells mediates the conversion
  of ATP to adenosine and reduces the proliferation of Tcons. Treg cells can directly
  affect B cells via PDL1/PD-1 interaction and DCs via CTLA-4 and LAG-3. CTLA-4 blocks
  co-stimulation, reducing CD80/CD86 expression, and it induces upregulation of IDO.
  Treg cells can inhibit B cells action and release granzyme B and perforin through
  the PD-1 signaling pathway to kill B cells. Treg cells can also bias monocytes to
  M2 macrophages, enhancing CD163 and CD206 on their surface molecules. They can similarly
  induce the suppressive phenotype of neutrophils and basophils and reduce the secretion
  of ILC2 cytokines.
