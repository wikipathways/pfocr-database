caption: Simplified overview of the intracellular signaling mechanisms governing CCA
  cell motility and invasiveness. The upregulation (red boxes) or downregulation (blue
  boxes) of different transcription factors [S100A4, Sal-like protein 4 (SALL4), Yes-associated
  protein (YAP), Notch intracellular domain (NICD)], protein kinases [mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP3K4)] and phosphatases [phosphatases of regenerating
  liver 1 (PRL1)], ubiquitin ligases [F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBXW7)],
  and adaptor proteins (14-3-3ζ) is responsible for the emergence of proinvasive features
  in CCA cells, due to the activation of deleterious transcriptional programs that
  are closely interwoven with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process.
  Protein tyrosine phosphatases protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 3 (PTPN3)
  and eyes absent homolog 4 (EYA4) are also endowed with protumorigenic and antitumorigenic
  functions in CCA, respectively, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have yet
  to be unveiled. Because of space limitations, we could not fully illustrate the
  extensive crosstalk among the depicted pathways. For instance, miR-29c, which is
  upregulated by YAP, can negatively regulate the expression of phosphatase and tensin
  homolog (PTEN), thereby allowing Akt to upregulate the expression of the oncoprotein
  gankyrin. Moreover, BMI-1 upregulation by SALL4 supports the activation of the prometastatic
  Wnt pathway. See text for further details. aPKC)-ι, atypical protein kinase C-ι;
  FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; GSK-3β, lycogen synthase kinase-3β; mTOR,
  mammalian target of rapamycin; MMP-9, matrix metalloproteinase-9; MT1-MMP, membrane-type
  1-MMP; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; Sox9, sex-determining region Y-box 9.
