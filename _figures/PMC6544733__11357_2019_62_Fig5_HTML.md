caption: 'Bioenergetic metabolites differ significantly between the Boxers and Chihuahuas.
  Boxplots from left to right: Chihuahuas, Chihuahua-mixed, Labradors, and Boxers.
  Raw metabolite values were normalized to protein concentrations and averaged across
  three replicates for every donor cell line. Asterisk indicates significant difference,
  in the respective metabolite, between the Boxers and Chihuahuas. a Glycolysis and
  citric acid cycle metabolite pathway schematic. b Fold enrichment of significantly
  different acylcarnitines between the Boxers and Chihuahuas (Labradors had intermediate
  concentrations for all acylcarnitines, see Supplemental File  for raw data and fibroblast
  donor information)'
