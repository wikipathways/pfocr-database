caption: The signaling pathway of mosquito’s innate immunity. Recognition of pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) activates the Toll pathway
  by proteolytic cleavage of spaetzle which binds to Toll receptors and triggers the
  signalling through adaptor proteins. This results in phosphorylation and degradation
  of the Cactus protein, which is an inhibitor of Rel1. Degradation of Cactus allows
  Rel1 to be translocated to the nucleus for the activation of transcription of genes
  regulated by Toll pathway. The IMD pathway is triggered by the binding of pathogens
  with PGRP-LC, which further triggers the signalling through IMD, FADD, and Dredd.
  This results in the phosphorylation of Rel2 by the activity of the Dredd protein.
  This step is regulated by the Caspar protein which is a negative regulator of the
  IMD pathway. Now Rel2 enters the nucleus to regulate the transcription of IMD-regulated
  genes, which are also involved in the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides. The JAK-STAT
  pathway is triggered by the binding of Upd with receptor proteins (Dome), leading
  to the activation of Hop proteins. Activated Hop proteins phosphorylate each other
  and STAT proteins, which are dimerized upon phosphorylation. This dimer of STAT
  proteins translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of JAK-STAT
  regulated genes, some of which are involved in the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides.
  PIAS is a negative regulator of dimerized STAT proteins inside the nucleus, and
  over-expression of PIAS inhibits JAK-STAT signalling pathway. Melanization is triggered
  by the activity of hemocytes, which is induced by the recognition of pathogens by
  PRRs. This results in the cleavage of prophenoloxidases (ProPO) by the activity
  of serine proteases (SPs), to form phenoloxidases (PO). Here, the activity of serine
  proteases is negatively regulated by serpins. Activated phenoloxidases trigger a
  series of reactions initiated in the presence of Tyrosine, ultimately leading to
  the melanization of invading pathogens.
