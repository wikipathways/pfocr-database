caption: 'Mitochondrial roles in health and disease. (A) Despite the presence of an
  own DNA in the mitochondrial matrix (mtDNA), most mitochondrial proteins are imported
  from the cytosol by two translocase complexes: the translocase of the outer membrane
  (TOM) and the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM). Mitochondria are hubs for
  several cellular processes, such as iron-sulfur clusters (Fe-S) assembly, metabolite
  oxidation by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and ATP production via the oxidative
  phosphorylation chain (OXPHOS). Further, mitochondrial proximity to the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) regulates calcium (Ca2+) buffering and phospholipid synthesis, e.g.,
  cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from their ER precursors phosphatidic
  acid (PA), and phosphatidylserine (PS), respectively. ER-mitochondrial contacts
  also regulate mitochondrial fission, by facilitating the recruitment of DRP1 to
  the mitochondria. In turn, mitochondrial fusion requires the mitofusins MFN1 and
  MFN2 at the OM and OPA1 at the IM. (B) Mitochondrial function is kept in check by
  mitophagy, a quality control mechanism. Mitophagy can occur dependently or independently
  of ubiquitin. The canonical ubiquitin-dependent PINK1/Parkin pathway initiates with
  the accumulation of the kinase PINK1 at the OM, which recruits the E3 ligase Parkin.
  Ubiquitylation (U) of several OMM substrates (S) by Parkin and additional phosphorylation
  (P) of ubiquitin and Parkin generates a positive feedback loop increasing Parkin
  activity. The ubiquitin chains formed on OM substrates bind to the lipidated autophagosome
  receptor LC3, via receptors proteins (R). Mitochondria are then surrounded and engulfed
  by the autophagosome, which finally fuses with the lysosome for degradation. The
  ubiquitin-independent mitophagy only requires the recognition of OM substrates (S)
  by lipidated LC3 directly via mitochondrial receptors (R). (C) Mitochondria are
  directly involved in the initiation of apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
  In this pathway, intrinsic death stimuli induce permeabilization of the OM by oligomerization
  of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins BAX and BAK. Apoptotic molecules such as cytochrome
  c (c) are release form the IMS, activating the apoptotic complex apoptosome. This
  complex is able to cleaved and thereby activate initiator caspases which, in turn,
  activate effector caspases.'
