caption: Pathways regulating contractile process of a pericyte around a capillary
  in the brain. Amyloid beta (Aβ) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) (via NOX4),
  which evoke the release of endothelin (ET)-1, which can activate contraction by
  binding to ETA. These lead to the release of Ca2+, which evokes contraction of pericytes
  and brain capillaries, which leads to a decrease of the glucose and oxygen supply
  to the brain tissue. This pathway can be inhibited by blocking NOX4 with GKT137831
  (GKT), blocking ETA receptors with BQ-123, and blocking the ET-evoked contraction
  by C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).
