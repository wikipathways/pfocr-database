caption: TNF-α signaling pathways to IKK activation. (A) Signaling pathways to full
  IKK activation. Upon ligation, TNFR1 recruits TRADD, RIP1, TRAF2, and cIAP1/2. TRAF2
  and cIAP1/2 then, in conjunction with UbcH5, catalyze linearly linked (M1-pUb) and
  K63-linked (K63-pUb) polyubiquitination of RIP1, as well as autoubiquitination of
  themselves (not shown for cIAPs). K63-pUb recruits the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex, and
  M1-pUb recruits the IKKα-IKKβ-NEMO complex, leading to TAK1 activation and TAK1-mediated
  activation of the early phase of IKK. Thereafter, K63-pUb recruits the HOIL-1L–HOIP
  complex, which in turn catalyzes linear ubiquitination of NEMO, leading to more
  IKK recruitment and full activation of IKK. Although the early phase of IKK activation
  is sufficient for induction of some NF-κB target genes (e.g., IκBα and IP-10 genes),
  full activation of IKK is essential for the efficient expression of other genes
  (e.g., RANTES and IL-6 genes) that require strong and prolonged NF-κB activation.
  (B) RIP1-independent pathway to delayed IKK activation. In embryonic hepatocytes,
  RIP1 protein is not detectable, due most likely to posttranslational degradation.
  As a result, upon TNFR1 ligation, receptor-recruited TRAF2 and cIAP1/2 undergo increased
  autoubiquitination through K63 (K63-pUb) and K48 linkages. This K63-pUb can mediate
  the recruitment of the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 and HOIP–HOIL-1 complexes but not the IKK
  complex. Consequently, the early phase of IKK activation is impaired. However, the
  HOIL-1L–HOIP complex (and possibly also TRAF2-K63-pUb) is still able to recruit
  the IKK complex with delayed kinetics compared to that of M1-pUb. This triggers
  HOIP–HOIL-1-mediated linear ubiquitination of NEMO and the subsequent recruitment
  of more IKK, resulting in the activation of the delayed phase of IKK. Such delayed
  IKK activation is sufficient for induction of some NF-κB target genes (e.g., IκBα
  and IP-10 genes).
