caption: PZM diseases linked to the RTK pathway. Shown are the RTK and G protein‐coupled
  receptors (GPCR) and the actors of their downstream signaling cascade involving
  the RAS/MAPK/Erk pathways, as well as the interaction between these pathways. Activation
  of GPCR and RTK leads to a cascade of intracellular signals involving many different
  genes that finally regulate important cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation,
  migration, and many more. Genes affected by postzygotic mosaic mutations causing
  disease (magenta border), the associated syndromes (magenta), and the specific genes
  affected (green) are also shown.
