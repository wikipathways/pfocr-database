caption: Schematic of CR2 site-targeted complement inhibitors. The CR2 moiety of the
  fusion protein binds the C3 degradation products iC3b, C3dg, and C3d that are covalently
  attached at sites of complement activation. Complement inhibitory constructs that
  have previously been prepared and characterized are CR2-Crry (murine inhibitor of
  C3 activation), CR2-CR1 (human inhibitor of C3 activation), CR2-fH (murine and human
  inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway), and CR2-CD59 (murine and human
  inhibitor of MAC formation). F1, factor 1; SP, serum protease; CR1/2, complement
  receptor 1/2; Crry, complement receptor-1 related protein y.
