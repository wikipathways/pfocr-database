caption: '(A) The nitro reduction pathway: six electrons are required for a full nitro
  reduction, but nitroso and hydroxylamine intermediates could also be formed during
  this process. (B) A schematic presentation of the anaerobic AO catalytic cycle for
  O6BG as the oxidative substrate and dantrolene as the reductive substrate. The electron
  flow pathway from the MoCo site to the FAD site through the two iron-sulfur clusters
  is presented with a dashed arrow. The electron leakage through nitroso and hydroxylamine
  intermediates formed as a result of incomplete nitro reduction can pose a risk of
  TDI of the enzyme (orange dotted arrow). However, this is not the case for O6BG
  oxidation by AO.'
