caption: Notch signaling and osteoclastogenesis. NOTCH1 inhibits osteoclastogenesis
  through the RBPJκ canonical pathway and by enhancing OPG levels and Wnt signaling
  in osteoblasts and osteocytes. NOTCH2 induces osteoclastogenesis through NF-κB and
  HES1-dependent mechanisms and by increasing RANKL in osteoblasts. NOTCH3 promotes
  osteoclastogenesis by enhancing RANKL levels in osteoblasts and osteocytes. NOTCH1,
  NOTCH2 and NOTCH3 act on the cells of the immune system during inflammation leading
  to the induction of pro-inflammatory and osteoclastogenic cytokines that can promote
  osteoclast differentiation and function either directly on osteoclasts or indirectly
  through the release of RANKL by osteoblasts.
