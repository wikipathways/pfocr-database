caption: 'Molecular and cellular signaling of intestinal tuft cells in response to
  infections. (by Figdraw 2.0). Left panels: Tuft cell detection of bacterial and
  viral infections. Upper left: Overview of tuft cells recognizing bacterial and viral
  pathogens. Lower left: Magnified view of molecular mechanisms. Bacterial metabolite
  N-C11-G from Shigella is recognized by Vmn2r26 GPCR expressed on tuft cells, activating
  PLCγ2-Ca2+ signaling pathway. This leads to PGs production and SpiB-induced tuft
  cell hyperplasia. Norovirus binds to CD300lf receptors on tuft cells, leading to
  viral replication. Rotavirus triggers tuft cell activation through an unknown receptor,
  resulting in ISG expression that contributes to antiviral defense. Enteroviruses
  upregulate IL-25 expression and induce tuft cell expansion through folate metabolism,
  but it is uncertain whether it activates type 2 immune responses. Right panels:
  Tuft cell-mediated response to parasitic infections. Upper right: Overview of tuft
  cells in anti-parasitic immunity. Tuft cells detect parasite metabolites and produce
  IL-25 and LTs, which activate ILC2 to secrete IL-13. IL-13 binds to IL4Rα on intestinal
  stem cells, promoting differentiation into tuft cells and goblet cells. Goblet cells
  secrete mucus to aid in parasite clearance, establishing the tuft cell-ILC2 circuit.
  However, PGs counteract IL-13 effects. Moreover, tuft cells secrete Ach which can
  directly inhibit helminth reproduction or act on adjacent epithelial cells, inducing
  chloride secretion followed by water secretion, thereby promoting worm expulsion.
  Lower right: Magnified view of molecular mechanisms. Succinate binds to Sucnr1,
  while TAS2R and TAS3R, all GPCRs, detect other parasite-derived metabolites. Receptor
  activation triggers phospholipase C (PLCβ/γ), converting PIP2 to IP3 and DAG, leading
  to increased intracellular Ca2+ and Trpm5 channel opening. This cascade results
  in IL-25 release, enhanced ChAT expression, and activation of eicosanoid pathway-related
  proteins (COX1, COX2, and ALOX5). Adapted from Seminars in Cell & Developmental
