caption: Pictured is a hypothetical model for capsule biosynthesis in S. pneumoniae
  based on a mixture of experimental evidence and speculation. For a recent review,
  see Yother [].(1) Non-housekeeping nucleotide sugar biosynthesis.(2) The initial
  transferase (WchA in this case) links the initial sugar as a sugar phosphate (Glc-P)
  to a membrane-associated lipid carrier (widely assumed to be undecaprenyl phosphate).(3)
  Glycosyl transferases sequentially link further sugars to generate repeat unit.(4)
  Wzx flippase transports the repeat unit across the cytoplasmic membrane.(5) Wzy
  polymerase links individual repeat units to form lipid-linked CPS.(6) Wzd/Wze complex
  translocates mature CPS to the cell surface and may be responsible for the attachment
  to peptidoglycan. The complex of WchA, Wzy, Wzx, Wzd, and Wze shown in the membrane
  is based on that in  of Whitfield and Paiment [] for the related Escherichia coli
  Type 1 capsule.
