caption: The alternative pathway is constitutively active at low levels through the
  hydrolysis of the thioester in C3 to C3(H2O). Hydrolyzed C3 combines with factor
  B, and in the presence of factor D, C3(H2O)Bb is formed. This intermediate convertase
  leads to the production of C3a and C3b from C3, and C3b enters the C3bBb amplification
  loop. Amplification on soluble C3bBb occurs with low efficiency because free C3b
  is rapidly inactivated by factors H and I. However, if C3b binds covalently to surfaces
  or as a covalent dimer to fluid-phase IgG, then it is partially protected from inactivation.
  In its dimeric form (C3bC3bIgG), it is seven to 10 times more efficient in generating
  a C3 convertase than surface-bound monomeric C3b. The very same enzyme on surfaces
  or on IgG in the fluid phase becomes a C5 convertase by acquiring an additional
  C3b in its vicinity, which increases the affinity of the enzyme for C5. Here we
  show in red just one of the possible amplification routes, which seems to be the
  most relevant in DDD (see text). In the absence of factor H to control levels of
  C3b in the fluid phase, the Cfh−/− mouse mutant develops DDD. Because factor B is
  critical to the formation of C3bBb, its absence in the Cfh−/−.Cfb−/− mutant rescues
  the disease phenotype and DDD does not develop. In the Cfh−/−.C5−/− mutant and the
  Cfh−/− mutant treated with anti-C5 antibodies, the degree of kidney disease is decreased
  compared with the degree of kidney disease seen in the Cfh−/− mutant.
