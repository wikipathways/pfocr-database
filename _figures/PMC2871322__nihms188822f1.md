caption: Schematic of central regulation of body fluid regulation in response to acute
  changes in sodium and volume. The OVLT (organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis)
  is a circumventricular organ located outside the blood-brain barrier (BBB), in the
  anteroventral part of the third ventricle that is an essential component of the
  osmotic thirst sensation pathway. Osmotic information from the OVLT is transmitted
  neurally to the hypothalamus and ultimately results in thirst, drinking, and arginine
  vasopressin (AVP) release. The median preoptic nucleus (NM) is responsible for initiating
  drinking in response to volumetric and angiotensinergic thirst stimulation. Through
  these mechanisms, the NM is used by both the subfornical organ (SFO) and the nucleus
  of the solitary tract (NTS), structures at the center of sodium appetite and thirst
  regulation. Changes in volume are initiated by the kidneys and stimulated by angiotensin
  outside the BBB. The SFO sends a message across the BBB to the NM, which then initiates
  volumetrically controlled thirst and drinking responses. Atrial baroreceptors also
  send a signal to the NTS. In addition to stimulating thirst, angiotensin stimulates
  the SFO and causes fluid regulating hormones to be secreted by the pituitary and
  adrenal glands, increases blood pressure, and eventually causes the kidney to stop
  secreting sodium and water, which, in turn, decreases both salt appetite and water
  intake. The paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON), both located in the
  hypothalamus, signal the release of AVP by the posterior pituitary. Thus both the
  PVN and SON also represent important structures involved in the control of water
  and sodium regulation because AVP has powerful effects upon both blood pressure
  and free water retention. Finally, the anterior cingulate cortex is involved in
  the relay of neural signals between the right and left hemispheres of the brain.
  This part of the brain is important for decision-making and plays an important role
  in sensing thirst and initiating drinking (). Figure 1 by G.W. Mack (with permission).
