caption: Schematic model for the role of Gbp1 in macrophages. Gbp1 expression is upregulated
  in response to the stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ and LPS) as a
  defensive mechanism during infection and inflammation. Gbp1 functions in eliminating
  dysfunctional mitochondria induced during inflammation via promoting mitophagic
  pathway. During chronic metabolic stress, such as HFD feeding and aging, Gbp1 is
  downregulated leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent activation of
  AMPK-p53 pathway and cellular senescence. Activation of p53 can also limit glycolytic
  activity of senescent cells.
