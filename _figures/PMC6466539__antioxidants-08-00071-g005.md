caption: The molecular pathway of amino-acid-related (over) activation of mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and the beneficial action of sheep/goat whey
  protein administration that mimics fasting. mTOR regulates diverse cellular processes,
  such as cell growth and proliferation, autophagy and protein synthesis and exists
  in two forms; mTORC1 and mTORC2. Two well-known substrates of mTORC1 are p70-S6
  Kinase 1 (p70-S6K1), whose expression was measured in the present study and the
  eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1). When they are phosphorylated,
  mRNA translation and, subsequently, protein synthesis are enhanced. The adaptor
  p62 is an important signaling molecule for the physiological function of mTORC1
  since it interacts with signaling intermediates and activates S6K1 and 4EBP1. Whey
  protein, similar to fasting, inhibits the overactivation of mTOR and, therefore,
  exerts a potential protective role against diverse pathologies.
