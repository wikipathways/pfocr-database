caption: The TLR6 variants associated with KD are predicted to yield lower levels
  of NFKB upon stimulation, thus resulting in lower levels of IL6. During vascular
  inflammation, neutrophil apoptosis is associated with shedding of the soluble IL6R-IL6
  complex, which binds to gp130 on endothelial cells. This stimulates a signaling
  pathway that switches the adhesion molecule and chemokine profile to one that favors
  attraction of monocytes to the vessel wall with subsequent downregulation of vascular
  inflammation. In KD, lower levels of IL6 may lead to persistence of neutrophil recruitment
  to the vessel wall and prolonged inflammation.
