caption: Quantifying the interaction between K230 and T234 in the transition state
  of Bacillus stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. The double mutant free energy
  cycle shown is used to determine the standard free energy of interaction (ΔΔGoint)
  for the interaction between the K230 and T234 side chains in the E•[Tyr~ATP]‡ transition
  state of Bacillus stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. Standard free energies
  for each variant are calculated using . Standard free energies corresponding to
  the addition of each side chain (ΔGa through ΔGd) are calculated by subtracting
  the standard free energies of each variant. For example, to calculate ΔGa, the standard
  free energy of the K230A/T234A variant is subtracted from that of the K230/T234A
  variant (ΔGoa = ΔGoK230/T234A − ΔGoK233A/T234A). The standard free energy of interaction
  is calculated by subtracting ΔGoa from ΔGod (ΔΔGoint = ΔGod − ΔGoa). Since free
  energy is a state function, the standard free energy of interaction can also be
  calculated by subtracting ΔGob from ΔGoc (ΔΔGoint = ΔGoc − ΔGob). Analogous double
  mutant free energy cycles can be used to calculate the free energy of interaction
  of the K230 and T234 side chains for each step along the reaction pathway. Rate
  and kinetic constants used to calculate the standard free energies of each variant
  are taken from [].
