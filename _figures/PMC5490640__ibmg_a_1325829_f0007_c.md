caption: TRIMs in the regulation of the immune response. (a) TRIM5α restricts retroviral
  infection. The TRIM5α SPRY domain interacts with the retroviral capsid lattice,
  which has two distinct consequences. First, TRIM5α recruits the autophagy machinery
  for degradation of the capsid. Second, TRIM5α in conjunction with UEV1A/UBC13 generates
  unanchored Lys 63-linked ubiquitin chains, which mediates TAK1 transactivation and
  subsequent NF-κB activation. (b) TRIM25 positively controls IFNβ production. By
  generating Lys 63-linked ubiquitin chains, TRIM25 releases RIG-I from its repressed
  conformation, which results in RIG-I tetramerization and subsequent IFNβ production.
  (c) TRIM6 controls type I interferon production and signaling, by generating Lys
  48-linked, unanchored ubiquitin chains, which activate IKKɛ. Nipah virus antagonizes
  interferon signaling by targeting TRIM6 for degradation. (d) TRIM65 activates the
  cytoplasmic dsRNA sensor MDA5 by conjugation of Lys 63-linked ubiquitin chains on
  MDA5 Lys 743. TRIM65 is critical for MDA5 oligomerization and activation. Similar
  to TRIM56, Salmonella SopA can also interact with TRIM65 and mediate its degradation.
  However, unlike TRIM56, SopA does not interfere with TRIM65 E3 activity. (e) TRIM56
  controls the STING-dependent cytosolic dsDNA response pathway by ubiquitinating
  STING with Lys 63-linked ubiquitin chains on Lys 150. Ubiquitination allows for
  STING dimerization, which is crucial for its activation. Salmonella SopA has been
  shown to bind and ubiquitinate TRIM56, thereby inhibiting it through preventing
  E3 ligase activity and degradation, respectively (see color version of this figure
  at www.tandfonline.com/ibmg).
