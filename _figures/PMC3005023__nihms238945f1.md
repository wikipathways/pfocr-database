caption: (A) In the presence of oxygen (O2), PHDs hydroxylate proline residues of
  HIF-1α, a reaction that can be inhibited by iron chelation. Hydroxylated HIF-1α
  interacts with VHL, which is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates
  the ubiquitination (Ub) of HIF-1α and targets HIF-1α for degradation in the proteasome.
  Under hypoxia, HIF-1α is not hydroxylated and is released from VHL-mediated degradation.
  Stabilized HIF-1 moves into the nucleus, dimerizes with HIF-1β and binds to the
  hypoxia response element (HRE). By interacting with cofactors such as CBP/p300 and
  DNA polymerase II, HIF-1 activates transcription of target genes. Binding to CBP/p300
  is blocked when HIF-1α is hydroxylated by FIH-1. HIF-1α is additionally regulated
  by oncogenic pathways (e.g., ERBB2, SRC, ET-1, RAS/MARK pathway, PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway),
  mutations of tumor suppressor genes (e.g., PTEN, VHL, SDH and FH), and reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). HIF-1 target genes related to cancer are categorized into
  four groups, with representative genes in each group listed. (B) The role of hypoxia
  responsive genes in different steps of metastasis. 1) The primary response to hypoxia
  during primary tumor growth is the induction of angiogenesis through VEGFA. HIFs
  also enhance cancer stem cell self-renewal ability partly through DLK1. Hypoxia
  activates the expression of SNAIL, TWIST1, TCF3, ZEB1 and ZEB2 to promote epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition of tumor cells. 2) Tumor cells acquire additional motility under hypoxia
  with increased expression of LOX, MET and AMF. Furthermore, hypoxia promotes invasion
  through basement membrane (BM) and extracellular matrix (ECM) by upregulating proteases
  such as CTSD, uPAR and MMPs. Increased production of fibronectin by hypoxia facilitates
  the establishment of a tumor-specific ECM. 3) Hypoxia facilitates intravasation
  by increasing the expression of VEGFA, miR-372/373 and MMPs. 4) Circulating tumor
  cells may acquire the resistance to anoikis by activation of TrkB and repression
  of integrin α5 (ITGA5), both of which are hypoxia targets. 5) After reaching the
  secondary vasculature, tumor cells extravasate using hypoxia-induced molecules such
  as ANGPTL4, MMPs and VEGFA. Hypoxia-dependent induction of CXCR4 and LOX mediates
  tumor cell homing to secondary organs and formation of pre-metastatic niche, respectively.
  6) In the parenchyma of the distant organ, hypoxia response factors such as ANGPTL4,
  CXCR4, DUSP1, CTGF, OPN, IL6, IL8 and MCP1 facilitate tumor-stromal interactions
  to foster the formation of overt metastasis in distinct organs.
