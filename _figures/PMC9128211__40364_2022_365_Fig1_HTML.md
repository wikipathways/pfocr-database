caption: Signaling pathways and genes controlling YAP expression and its regulatory
  system. YAP can be affected by many factors. when YAP is phosphorylated in the cytoplasm
  by some factors like Hippo pathway, AKT, c-Abl, NLK, MYPT1 and PRP4K, it finally
  can be degraded, YAP can also be enhanced by OTUB2 so that it can enter in nucleus
  easily. Active YAP localizes in the nucleus and combines with TEAD, p73 or ZEB1
  at its TED domain thus affect other factors. YAP-TEAD co-activator could enhance
  CTGF, CYR6, MYC and NUAK2, which participates in a feed-forward loop that enhances
  YAP activity by inhibit Hippo pathway. YAP-TEAD co-activator could also be inhibited
  by TRPS1, TIAM1 and RUNX3, and be enhanced by MRTF and SS18-SSX. Aurora a kinase
  can phosphorylate YAP in nucleus thus reduce the activity of it
