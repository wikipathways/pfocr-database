caption: A proposed model for signaling pathways affected by UTD2 in breast cancer
  cells. By targeting tubulin and promoting tubulin polymerization, UTD2 inhibits
  the Rac1/PAK1/p38/MMP-2 signaling pathway, which is critical for the UTD2-induced
  actin cytoskeleton dysfunction. Meanwhile, the Rac1/PI3K/Akt/MMP-2 pathway may be
  also involved in UTD2-induced actin cytoskeleton dysfunction. In addition, represented
  by a thinner arrow in this model, UTD2 can moderately inhibit the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway.
  Together with the effect on survival factor Akt, these account for at least part
  of UTD2's antitumor activities.
