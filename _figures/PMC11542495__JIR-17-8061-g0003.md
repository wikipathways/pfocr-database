caption: 'The Cytoprotective Mechanisms of HO-1: Heme oxygenase 1 is an enzyme responsible
  for the breakdown of heme into Fe²⁺, CO, and bilirubin, which is subsequently converted
  to bilirubin by BVR. This process also involves the participation of NADPH and is
  associated with the regulation of ferroptosis. As shown in the upper right corner
  of the figure, when free heme accumulates, Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1 and translocates
  to the nucleus, promoting the expression of HO-1. Additionally, free heme recruits
  the E3 ubiquitin ligase component Fbxo22, facilitating the degradation of Bach1,
  an inhibitor of HO-1. Following ubiquitination, Bach1 is degraded via the proteasome
  pathway'
