caption: Pseudomonas aeruginosa secreted protease AprA degrades IFN-λ and reduces
  the antiviral response to RSV and hRV infection. Sörensen and others () report that
  the protease AprA can inhibit the antiviral response of bronchial epithelial cells.
  When RSV or hRV infect the airway, they are sensed by endosomal PRRs of bronchial
  epithelial cells. This recognition triggers the activation and nuclear translocation
  of transcription factors such as IRF1, IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB, leading to transcription,
  translation, and secretion of IFN-λ. The binding of this cytokine to its receptor
  (IFNLR) activates a JAK/STAT-dependent pathway that promotes the transcription of
  ISGs through binding to an ISRE. Those ISGs, which include MX1 and OAS1, have antiviral
  properties and decrease virus spread and cytopathic effects. However, specific strains
  of the bacterium P. aeruginosa, such as PAO1, can alter this mechanism. This microorganism
  produces the alkaline protease AprA, whose expression depends on the quorum sensing
  regulator LasR. After secretion through the T1SS, this enzyme degrades IFN-λ, thereby
  inhibiting downstream signaling through IFNLR, production of ISGs, and antiviral
  effects. hRV, human rhinovirus; IFN, interferon; IFNLR, IFN-λ receptor; IRF, IFN
  regulatory factor; ISG, interferon stimulated gene; ISRE, interferon stimulated
  response element; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; RSV,
