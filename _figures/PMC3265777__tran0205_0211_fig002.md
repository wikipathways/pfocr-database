caption: Context-dependent regulation of Rho GTPase signaling. (A) TGFβ-dependent
  regulation of RhoB activity. TGFβ upregulates RhoB expression by a MEK/ERK-dependent
  and Smad-dependent pathway. Once activated, RhoB signals through the ROCK-LIMK pathway
  to alter cell motility and migration. (B) RhoB-dependent cell death following DNA
  damage. Ionizing radiation (IR) triggers the DNA damage response to activate Ect2
  and Net1. These GEFs promote the GTP exchange and activation of RhoB. Activated
  RhoB signals via the JNK pathway to induce the pro-apoptotic protein BIM and cell
  death. A positive feedback loop might allow JNK phosphorylation to further increase
  RHOB transcription and amplify RhoB-dependent cell death. (C) p53 regulates pro-survival
  functions of Rho GTPases. Caspase-3 is activated in response to genotoxic stress
  and cleaves and activates ROCK1. This kinase phosphorylates a number of substrates
  (including MYPT1 and MLC), which modify the actin cytoskeleton and ultimately generate
  contractile force within the cell. This increased contractility provides the force
  required for apoptotic membrane blebbing and disruption of the nucleus. RhoE can
  bind and inhibit ROCK1 activity, thereby promoting cell survival. A separate pro-survival
  pathway is triggered downstream of p53 by the upregulation and activation of RhoC
  and LIMK2. Signaling via an as yet unknown substrate of LIMK2 promotes cell survival.
