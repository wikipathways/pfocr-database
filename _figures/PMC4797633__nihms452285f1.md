caption: The complement system. The classical pathway is activated by antigen-antibody
  complex and the alternative and lectin pathways by microbial surfaces. Activation
  of these pathways results in the generation of the key enzymes C3 and C5 convertases,
  which in turn results in the release of C3a, C4a, and C5a anaphylatoxins (inflammatory
  response) and C3b (opsonization of target cells) and the generation of the membrane
  attack complex in the target cell (lysis). The different steps of the cascade where
  some of the complement regulatory proteins inhibit complement activation are shown.
  MBL = mannose-binding lectin; MASP = MBL-associated serine protease; C4bp = C4-binding
  protein, CR1; DAF = decay-accelerating factor; MCP = membrane cofactor protein.
