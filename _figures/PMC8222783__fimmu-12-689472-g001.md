caption: The B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway and the effect of kinase inhibitors.
  The BCR pathway trifurcates into, from left, NF-κB, NFAT and AP-1 signaling. The
  AP-1 pathway is believed to be connected to the BCR through LYN, SYK and ZAP70 (not
  depicted). Filled protein symbols correspond to Gain-of-Function (GoF) drug resistance
  mutations. BTK inhibitors (BTKi) and p110δ inhibitors (p110δi) are marked with yellow
  background. The MYD88 L265P GoF mutation found in 95% of WM patients, and also in
  ABC-type DLBCL, and in some CLL patients induces an activated endolysosome containing
  TLR9 and the BCR.  proteins affected by BTKi,  proteins affected by p110δi.
