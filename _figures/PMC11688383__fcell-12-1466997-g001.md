caption: ER stress and activation of the UPR signaling pathways. The UPR is triggered
  by ER stress sensors, namely IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 upon UPR target genes related
  dissociation of BiP. The activation of PERK through its dimerization and autophosphorylation
  suppresses the overall protein synthesis by eukaryotic translation initiation factor
  2 subunit α (eIF2α) phosphorylation. PERK activation also increases the formation
  of the transcription factor ATF4 that regulates several components involved in amino
  acid transport and protein folding. IRE1α is activated following its dissociation
  from BiP and spontaneously undergoes homodimerization and autophosphorylation; the
  modified IRE1α induces splicing of the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA to generate
  sXBP1 that regulates several UPR target genes responsible for protein folding, lipid
  synthesis, and quality control of cellular proteins. The activated ATF6 is processed
  in the Golgi apparatus by site 1 protease (S1P) and site 2 protease (S2P) to release
  the cytosolic domain ATF6f that regulates some UPR target genes related to XBP1,
  protein folding, and quality control of cellular proteins
