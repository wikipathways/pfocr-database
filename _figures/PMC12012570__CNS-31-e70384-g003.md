caption: CIH modulates glial cells in the CNS through various mechanisms. CIH may
  be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and cerebral apoplexy by
  inducing the release of DAMPs from neuronal cells to regulate the M1/M2 phenotypic
  switch in microglia and trigger neuroinflammation. CIH can regulate the M1/M2 phenotypic
  transition of microglia by inducing the release of DAMPs, activate the TLRs signaling
  pathway, inhibit the TOM1 signaling pathway by reducing the level of SENP1, regulate
  the A1/A2 phenotypic transition of astrocytes by activating the NLRP3/Caspase‐1/ASC/IL‐1β
  pathway, and promote iron accumulation in microglia by activating the TLR4/MyD88/NF‐κB
  pathway, thus participating in the pathogenesis of AD. CIH may increase the production
  of reactive oxygen species in oligodendrocytes and reduce the production of ATP
  by activating microglia‐induced oxidative stress, thus contributing to the pathogenesis
  of multiple sclerosis
