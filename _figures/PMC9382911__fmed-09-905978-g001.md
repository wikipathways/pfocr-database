caption: Exogenous pyruvate metabolism in cellular hypoxia. Exogenous pyruvate enters
  cell plasma with [H+]. The pyruvate or glycolytic pyruvate with [H+] spontaneously
  reduces to lactate with LDH free of energy in anoxia, leading to [H +] consumption
  and increment of the NAD+/NADH ratio that promotes the glycolytic pathway at glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase. Exogenous pyruvate also facilitates glycolysis by stimulating the
  HIF-1α-EPO signal pathway, increasing G-6PD activity, thereby preserving the PPP
  pathway and GSH/GSSG ratio. It inhibits AR activity in the sorbitol pathway likely
  by competing inhibition, enhancing NAD+/NADH also in the second step of sorbitol
  pathway. Thus, pyruvate sustains canonical glycolytic pathways and glycolytic ATP.
  It also inhibits LDH-A to decline the pyruvate reduction to lactate. Pyruvate enters
  mitochondria with [H+] and oxidates in hypoxia and normoxia by renovating inhibited
  PDH in the TCA cycle, resulting in mitochondrial ATP generation and [H +] consumption.
  Also, it promotes the TCA cycle via anaplerosis with preservation of PC and ME activities.
  Hence, pyruvate reverses the Warburg effect. Pyruvate-based gluconeogenesis consumes
  additional [H +] in relation to lactate-based one in cytosol. Pyruvate has the most
  powerful energetics with the least oxygen consumption in equal molar ATP generation
  among lactate, acetate, citrate, and malate oxidation. AR, aldose reductase; ATP,
