caption: Schematic representation of I. scapularis immune-related genes potentially
  representing three major signaling pathways that lead to anti-microbial responses.
  While annotated tick genes from each pathway are shown in black font, the apparently
  missing genes are indicated in blue. For further details on these pathways, including
  abbreviations, please refer to the text and earlier publications (Lemaitre, ; Liu
  et al., ).
