caption: Sample signalling scheme showing pathways known to be active in melanoma.
  Preclinical studies support the combined targeting of either BRAF/MAPK and PI3K/AKT
  pathway or the BRAF/MAPK and mTOR signalling pathways in melanoma. It is likely
  that the combined inhibition of BRAF/PI3K pathways will have synergistic effects
  at the level of growth inhibition, via effects upon cyclin D1 expression, as well
  as through increased expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21waf-1/cip-1.
  Inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway is likely to affect cell survival via modulation
  of BAD/Bcl-2, as well as affecting protein translation at the level of S-6-kinase
  (S6K).
