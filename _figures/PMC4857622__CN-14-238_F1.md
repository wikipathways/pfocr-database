caption: The three types of autophagy and their pathways. Macroautophagy (often referred
  to as just autophagy) is the most common pathway. Autophagy induction can be triggered
  by either mTORC1-dependent or -independent means, causing activation of the ULK
  protein complex, comprised of Atg13, ULK1/2 and FIP200, which assembles at the isolation
  membrane and causes activation of the Vps34-Beclin 1 complex at the PAS. Upon nucleation,
  phagophore formation and elongation is mediated by Atg9. This requires the Atg5-Atg12-Atg16L1
  complex, which mediates the conjugation of phosphatidylethanolamine to LC3-I, generating
  LC3-II which becomes anchored on the surface of the nascent autophagosome. Upon
  completion, autophagosomes undergo microtubule-dependent transport to fuse with
  either late endosomes (to form amphisomes), or with lysosomes (to form autolysosomes),
  and contents are degraded in the acid environment with the help of acid hydrolases.
  During chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), substrates bearing a KFERQ-like motif
  are recognized by a chaperone/co-chaperone complex in the cytosol. This complex
  transfers the protein to the surface of the lysosomal membrane, where the binding
  to the cytosolic tail of the LAMP2A receptor takes place. Binding causes LAMP2A
  multimerization and substrate unfolding, followed by the translocation of the protein
  across the lysosomal membrane and its subsequent degradation by lysosomal hydrolases.
  Microautophagy is the least understood process, consisting of the direct invagination
  of the lysosomal membrane to form intraluminal vesicles loaded with cytosolic contents
  or organelles. Once inside the lysosome, these vesicles and their contents are then
  degraded. For further details see text.
