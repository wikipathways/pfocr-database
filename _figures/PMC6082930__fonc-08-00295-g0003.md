caption: Smurf2 as an oncogene. Smurf2 monoubiquitinates UBCH5α and forms an active
  complex for the degradation of the KRAS negative regulator, βTrCP. This stabilizes
  KRAS and could potentiate its pro-oncogenic functions. Smurf2 also ubiquitinates
  EGFR and protects it from degradation. In addition, Smurf2 through the degradation
  of GSK3β and Axin could upregulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Through this mechanism,
  Smurf2 might also increase the pro-oncogenic activities of this pathway. Dotted
  arrows specify potential mechanisms determined from existing evidence.
