caption: The largest gene regulatory subnetworks in yeast. While the dotted, dash-dotted,
  dashed, and solid lines implied the corresponding connections were constructed respectively
  in [80%, 90%), [90%, 95%), [95%, 100%), and 100% of the bootstrapping data sets,
  the blue arrow- and red bar-headed lines indicate up and down regulations, respectively.
  Highlighted in yellow is the Inositol subnetwork in which several genes involved
  in the CDP-DAG/phosphocholine pathway are coordinately repressed by exogenous inositol.
  Within the amine biosynthetic process subnetwork highlighted in green, LEU2, LPD1,
  YGR012W, LYS14, ILV6, and ARO4 are involved in multiple biosynthetic processes (as
  shown in Table ).
