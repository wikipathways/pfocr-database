caption: The role of axin in Wnt signalling. The Wnt signalling pathway plays an important
  role in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, motility, and
  morphogenesis. Axin serves as a scaffold protein that binds many of the proteins
  involved in this pathway. In the absence of Wnt ligands, the β catenin destruction
  complex, which is composed of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), glycogen synthase
  kinase 3 (GSK3), and axin, is formed and leads to the phosphorylation and degradation
  of β catenin. In the presence of Wnt ligands, the formation of this complex is inhibited
  and the now stabilised β catenin is translocated into the nucleus and activates
  the transcription of downstream target genes. Axin is also implicated in shuttling
  β catenin out of the nucleus. However, β catenin can move in and out of the nucleus
  independently of axin. It is unclear whether axin participates in the regulation
  of all of the different pools of β catenin in the cell. Deregulation of many components
  of the Wnt pathway has been found in human cancer. DVL, Dishevelled; LEF, lymphoid
  enhancer binding factor; P, organic phosphate; TCF, T cell specific factor.
