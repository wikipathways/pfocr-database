caption: Molecular pathways involved in the maintenance of the MDSC suppressive function.A
  wide variety of proinflammatory factors are involved in the induction of the suppressive
  function in MDSCs. Several of those pathways promote the suppressive function of
  both M‐MDSCs and PMN‐MDSCs (e.g., IL‐4/IL‐13–mediated STAT6 signaling and TNF‐α–induced
  NF‐κB activation), whereas others are more specific to maintaining the suppressive
  properties of either PMN‐MDSC or the M‐MDSC subsets (e.g., MIF‐cyclooxygenase 2‐PGE2signaling
  in M‐MDSCs). The STAT1 pathway has been hypothesized to have contrasting roles by
  inducing the M‐MDSC suppressive activity but inhibiting the activity of PMN‐MDSCs.
