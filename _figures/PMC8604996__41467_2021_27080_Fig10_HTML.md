caption: Part of orally administered NR is directly absorbed from the small intestine.
  Orally administered NR is also degraded to NAM by BST1 in the small intestine. NAM
  derived from NR is further metabolized to NA by gut microbiota in the large intestine.
  Then, NA absorbed from the large intestine is used for the generation of NAD+ in
  the liver via the Preiss–Handler pathway. However, the base-exchange reaction for
  NR and NAR may function as a backup route when Preiss–Handler pathway is impaired.
