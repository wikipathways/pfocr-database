caption: 'JNK signaling pathways and functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm of spinal
  cord neurons. JNK pathways are activated by different anti- or pro-apoptotic signals
  such as extracellular (e.g., inflammatory signals, pathogens, developmental factors,
  and neurotransmitters) as well as intracellular (e.g., oxidative stress, and DNA
  damage) stimuli that converge on the three JNK isoforms and promote JNK pleiotropic
  functions (physiological vs. stress-inducible): they can translocate in the nucleus
  and in mitochondria, or remain into the cytoplasm. JNKs phosphorylate a variety
  of cytoplasmic as well as nuclear substrates, can trigger the programmed cell death,
  promote a wide range of functional roles in brain development (e.g., cell migration,
  axonal guidance, neurite formation, and outgrowth) and in nerve regeneration. Abbreviations:
  JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; MKK4/7, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
  4/7; PCD, programmed cell death, TFs, transcription factors.'
