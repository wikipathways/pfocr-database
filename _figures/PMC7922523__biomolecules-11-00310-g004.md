caption: TGF-β/EMT signalling in pSS. TGF-β activates both the canonical SMAD2/3 pathway
  and the non-canonical MAPK pathway, triggering the EMT process in healthy SGEC.
  An inflammatory microenvironment including pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17,
  IL-22, and IL-6 may induce EMT through the TGF-β/SMAD and non-SMAD signalling pathways.
  TGF-β exerts its cellular effects by linking to the TGF-β type I/ II receptor, and
  this binding leads to the activation of SMAD2/3 canonical signalling. Phosphorylated
  SMAD2/3, with cofactor SMAD4, form a heteromeric complex, which translocates to
  the nucleus to mediate signalling events linked to EMT activation. The activation
  of the transcription factor Snail and the induction of EMT markers have the consequence
  of upregulating the mesenchymal markers Vimentin and Collagen Type 1 and downregulating
  the epithelial marker E-Cadherin. During the activated EMT program, salivary epithelial
  cells exhibit dramatic morphological changes and the acquisition of mesenchymal
  properties, including an increased migratory capacity and contractility. Finally,
  these mesenchymal cells become myofibroblasts, which are responsible for progressive
  SG fibrosis. Alternatively, TGF-β can deliver signals via non-SMAD pathways, such
  as the MAPK signalling cascade including phosphorylated ERK1/2. The ERK1/2 signalling
  pathway has a complex and crucial correlation with the TGF-β1 system in controlling
  the EMT process.
