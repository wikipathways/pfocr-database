caption: Simplified model summarizing the effect of OSRG on gene expression in the
  course of IAA-induced adventitious root formation in buckwheat hypocotyls. Differentially
  expressed genes in IAA+OSRG compared to IAA samples are presented after 6 and 24
  of treatment; upregulated genes (FC>2) are indicated in red and downregulated genes
  (FC<0.5), in blue; if a gene did not show DE but its product may play an important
  role in the examined processes or interactions with other genes (proteins) according
  to the literature, it is indicated in black. To designate the association of gene
  products with processes or other gene products, black arrows are used. If a positive
  or negative association is clear (based on the literature), it is designated by
  a red or blue arrows, respectively. Most of the designated genes and their products
  are discussed in the manuscript. OSRG cannot pass through the plasma membrane as
  such, but it can affect targets associated with ROS and IAA regulatory modes. The
  ROS mode is more active at the early stage of the response (6 h). The ROS mode comprises
  cell wall peroxidases, RBOH, and others. Both of these modes could be associated
  with the changes in cell wall components. One of the types of targets that could
  be involved in the intracellular modulation of both ROS and auxin action is the
  glutathione transferases (GST). OSRG is suggested to affect the PIN distribution
  and, as a result, the auxin signaling pathway (IAA mode). The important regulators
  whose activity can be modulated by OSRG include IAA3, IAA4, UPB1, and LBD41 at the
  early stage and IAA3, MYB77, HY5, C2H2, GL3, and BHL1 at the later stage. The presence
  of OSRG increases the number of IAA-induced adventitious roots (ARs).
