caption: TGF-β signaling in gliomagenesis and its targeting. The TGF-β/Smads signaling
  pathway contributes to glioma development through induction of multiple carcinogenic
  processes. This pathway promotes glioma proliferation via PDGF-B and miR-182, invasiveness
  via miR-182, miR-10 and MMP, as well as angiogenesis via VEGF, IGFBP7, and JNK.
  The TGF-β/Smads signaling pathway induces immunosuppression by inhibiting NK cells,
  cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), dendritic cells (DC), and by upregulating T regulatory
  (Treg) cells. The TGF-β/Smads signaling pathway also drives GSC stemness via LIF,
  Sox4-Sox2, and Id1-Id3. Aberant TGF-β signaling can be targeted by multiple apporaches,
  including blockade of TGF-β mRNA translation using antisense oligonucleotides (AON)
  (AP12009), sequestering TGF-β with soluble receptors (sTGFβRII) or neutralizing
  antibodies (GC1008), and suppressing TGF-β receptors activity with kinase inhibitors
  (LY2157299, LY2109761 and SB-431542).
