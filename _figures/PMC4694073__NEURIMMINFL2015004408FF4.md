caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed the main canonical pathways, biofunctions,
  and diseases identified with significant metabolites. Metabolites playing a key
  role are associated to arrows indicating the relative change in patients with multiple
  sclerosis (MS) compared with healthy controls (blue arrow: decrease; red arrow:
  increase). Among the canonical pathways and cellular functions, the tryptophan degradation
  and the energy production were the most relevant (box and lines in green). Decrease
  of glucose in patients with MS leads to a decrease in the production of acetyl coenzyme
  A (acetyl-CoA), a fundamental precursor of the Krebs cycle and the most important
  pathway in energy production. To overcome the lack of glucose, the β-oxidation of
  fatty acids in mitochondria is induced. This leads to an increased production of
  ketone bodies (3-OH-butyrate, acetoacetate, acetone) in patients with MS. Ketone
  bodies can migrate into the bloodstream for use in peripheral tissues where they
  are metabolized for the production of ATP, especially 3-OH-butyrate. In particular,
  tryptophan and some of the intermediaries of this pathway (kynurenine, 3-OH-anthranilate)
  are implicated in the cell-mediated immune response (differentiation of regulatory
  T lymphocytes, activation of T lymphocytes). Moreover, the pathways analysis identifies
  correlation between tryptophan, glucose, and 3-OH-butyrate with immunologic/inflammatory
  disease and neurologic disease (box and lines in violet).'
