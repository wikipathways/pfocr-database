caption: Neural cholesterol clearance pathway and bile acid transport into the CNS.
  Cholesterol is catalyzed in the brain via sterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1), an enzyme
  expressed only in neurons. It is converted to 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and is able
  to be removed from the CNS through the blood brain barrier (BBB) via the transporter
  ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), indicated via green arrow. Other transporters
  mediate systemic circulating bile acids into the CNS. Organic anion transporter
  polypeptide 1 (OATP1) expressed in the choroid plexus and organic anion transporter
  polypeptide 2 (OATP2) expressed at the BBB both mediate the transport of bile acids,
  both processes indicated by purple arrows.
