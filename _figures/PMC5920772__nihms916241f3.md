caption: Shh, Wnt and Fgf signaling promotes development of dbx1b-expressing dHb progenitors.
  These give rise to cxcr4b-expressing neural precursors that differentiate into mature
  dHb neurons. It is unclear whether Shh functions directly to generate habenular
  progenitors or acts upstream of Wnt and/or Fgf signaling. Outgrowth of efferents
  from Hb neurons is posteriorly directed by transient chemokine signaling. Expression
  of multiple components in the Cxcr4b-chemokine signaling pathway is positively regulated
  by Fgf and, indirectly, negatively regulated by Wnt signaling. Proper formation
  of the fasciculus retroflexus fiber bundles and innervation of specific target regions
  require additional repulsive and attractive axon guidance cues.
