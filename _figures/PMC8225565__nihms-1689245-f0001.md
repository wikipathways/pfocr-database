caption: Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) is a glycoprotein mainly produced by
  the liver and secreted into the circulation, which is not part of the sex metabolism
  pathway. The main function of SHBG is as a carrier protein of sex steroid hormones.
  Testosterone and estrogen compete with the same binding site, while testosterone
  has higher binding affinity than estradiol and estrone. When testosterone and estradiol
  are not bound to SHBG, they are referred to as “free”, or “bioavailable”, and can
  freely exert their effects upon your body.
