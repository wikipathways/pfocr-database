caption: Schematic of the core elements of the mammalian Hippo signaling pathway.
  The core Hippo pathway kinases (TAO1-3, MST1/2, MAP4K1-4, 6, 7, LATS1/2, and NDR1/2),
  plus the adaptor proteins (SAV1 and MOB1A/B), function to inhibit the activity of
  the transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ/WWTR1 by phosphorylation at critical
  serine residues that results in cytoplasmic retention and/or protein degradation.
  When active, YAP and TAZ bind to TEAD transcription factors to regulate proliferative,
  metabolic and anabolic gene expression. YAP-TEAD signaling is limited by competitive
  interaction with VGLL-4. During mitosis, YAP activity can be enhanced by phosphorylation
  by CDK1. Elements inhibitory to YAP and TAZ activity are shown in green; elements
  that active/enhance YAP and TAZ activity are shown in blue.
