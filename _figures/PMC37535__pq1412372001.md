caption: 'Biosynthesis of IPP and DMAPP via the mevalonate pathway (A) and the mevalonate-independent
  (DXP) pathway (B). The indicated enzymes are: AACT, acetyl-CoA/acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase;
  HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase; HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  reductase; MK, mevalonate kinase; PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; MDC, mevalonate-5-diphosphate
  decarboxylase; DXPS, 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase; DXR, 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate
  reductoisomerase; MCT, 2-C-methylerythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) cytidyltransferase;
  CMK, 4-(cytidine-5′-diphospho)-2-C-methylerythritol kinase; MECPS, 2-C-methylerythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate
  synthase; and IPP isomerase (IPPI). The circled P denotes the phosphate moiety.
  The large open arrows indicate several as-yet-unidentified steps. The pathway may
  give rise to IPP and DMAPP independently () of the interconversion catalyzed by
  IPPI.'
