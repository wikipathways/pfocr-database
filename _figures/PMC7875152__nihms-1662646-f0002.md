caption: Advances in high throughput sequencing have allowed for new genetic causes
  of PH to be identified. Beyond bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) and
  related pathway members (endoglin and ACVRL1) and the ligand BMP9, these include
  mutations in SMAD9, and membrane-related proteins caveolin 1 (CAV1), the potassium
  channel Two Pore Domain Channel Subfamily K Member 3 (KCNK3), aquaporin-1 (AQP1),
  and the sulfonylurea receptor 1 protein of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (ABCC8).
  Other variants have been identified in the transcription factors T-box transcription
  factor 4 (TBX4) and SRY-box transcription factor 17 (SOX17) as well as the endosomal
  ATPase polyamine transporter (ATP13A3). Eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2-α
  kinase 4 (EIF2AK4) has also recently been associated with pulmonary veno-occlusive
  disease and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.From Southgate L, Machado RD, Graf
