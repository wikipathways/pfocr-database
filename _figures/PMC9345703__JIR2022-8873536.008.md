caption: 'Proposed upregulation of the IFN-1 response pathway by cryptolepine. Cytosolic
  RNA is detected by the MDA5 or RIG-1 which leads to the activation of IRF3 via the
  TBK1. However, cytosolic DNA is recognised by cGAS which then stimulates the STING-dependent
  signalling, leading to the phosphorylation of IRF3. The phosphorylated IRF3 homodimerises
  and moves into the nucleus causing the release of the IFN-1 (mainly IFN-α/β). The
  secreted IFNs simulate the later phase of the IFN-1 pathway (JAK-STAT axis) through
  the IFNARs, which transmit a cascade of signalling events to activate the promoters
  of ISGF3 and induce the production of numerous IFN-responsive proteins which facilitate
  anticancer and antiviral responses. This study has demonstrated that cryptolepine
  activates the IFN-1 response pathway via the JAK-STAT axis (as indicated by arrows)
  but is independent of the first phase of the pathway (as indicated by a crossed
  arrow). CRYPT: cryptolepine.'
