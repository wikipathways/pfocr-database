caption: Proposed mechanism of action of Rasd1 in cAMP-dependent gene regulation.
  Rasd1 mRNA expression is upregulated by glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) and increased
  plasma osmolality (hypertonic stress). In the cytoplasm RASD1 undergoes posttranslational
  processing by isoprenylation of its CAAX box motif enabling trafficking to the cell
  membrane. RASD1 activates Gαi which inhibits the cAMP dependent pathway by inhibiting
  adenylyl cyclase. This results in the inhibition of the cAMP-PKA-CREB signalling
  pathway
