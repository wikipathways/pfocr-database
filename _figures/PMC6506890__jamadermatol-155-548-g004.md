caption: The mevalonate pathway is an essential metabolic pathway that uses acetyl–Coenzyme
  A (CoA) to produce sterols and isoprenoid metabolites that are essential for a broad
  range of metabolic processes. Genes previously found to be involved in familial
  porokeratosis are in bold. Dashed arrows indicate multiple processes. tRNA refers
  to transfer RNA.aGenes in which second-hit postzygotic mutations were identified.
