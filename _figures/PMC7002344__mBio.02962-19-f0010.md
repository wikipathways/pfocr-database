caption: Differential phosphorylation of MAPK pathways during response to cell wall
  damage. The wild-type, ΔsakA, ΔmpkC, and ΔsakA ΔmpkC strains were exposed to CR
  for 30 min. Phosphorylated (green boxes) or dephosphorylated (red boxes) proteins
  in the presence of CR are shown in the different MAPK pathways. Superscript names
  correspond to the respective homologue genes in S. cerevisiae. Proteins with no
  phosphorylation modulation are represented with the S. cerevisiae corresponding
  name, adapted from the MAPK signaling pathway, yeast, Aspergillus fumigatus, in
  KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [https://www.genome.jp/kegg/]).
