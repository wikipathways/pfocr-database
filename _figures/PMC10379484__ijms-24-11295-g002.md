caption: Simplified schematic diagrams of the proposed storage and release mechanisms
  of ET-1. ET-1 could be stored in Weibel–Palade bodies (WPB) and released via a regulated
  pathway or released via a constitutive pathway. ET-1 may also be recycled through
  the endocytic pathway. Through multivesicular bodies (MVB), there is also the possibility
  of storage and release of preproET-1 mRNA in exosomes. Several markers (e.g., Rab5)
  in this pathway have been highlighted as suggestions for future colocalisation studies.
