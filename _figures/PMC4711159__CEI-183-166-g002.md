caption: 'Mechanisms regulating CD4+ and CD4+CD25+forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3) balance.
  An antigen‐presenting cell (APC) cell interacts with both CD4+ and CD4+CD25+FoxP3
  by means of the same ligands, i.e. the T cell receptor (TCR)/CD4/CD3 that interacts
  with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II complex and CD80/86 and CD40.
  The former molecules, i.e. TCR/CD4/CD3, are present on both CD4+ and CD4+CD25+FoxP3
  and does not represent a regulatory mechanism; this route activates the Signal 1
  pathway. At variance, CD80/86 interact with CD4+CD25+FoxP3 cells: in the former
  case, i.e. CD4+, CD80/86 interacts with CD28 and constitutes a positive stimulus
  for CD4+ expansion (in black), whereas it interacts preferentially with cytotoxic
  T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA‐4) in CD4+CD25+FoxP3 and represents an inhibitory mechanism
  (in purple). Actually, regulatory CD4+CD25+FoxP3 cells contain both CD28 and CTLA‐4
  in a ratio of 1 : 2 that implies that negative regulatory mechanisms prevail in
  these cells and block the Signal 2 pathway that is necessary for activating CD4+
  effector cells. CD40–CD40L has the same expression in both cell lineages and does
  not represent a regulatory mechanism.'
