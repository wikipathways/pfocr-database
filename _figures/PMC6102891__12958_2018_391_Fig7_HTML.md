caption: The signaling pathway of OS and pregnancy (a brief view). When the body,
  especially the maternal body, suffers from an imbalance between oxidation and antioxidant
  levels during pregnancy, in addition to changes in TNF-α, changes in progesterone
  cannot be ignored. First, TNF-α activates a series of signaling pathways in cells
  through cAMP, such as stimulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling
  pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, etc., then promoting an increase in cytokines and
  changes in antioxidant-related genes. However, FOXO3 is involved in these signaling
  pathways. When FOXO3 is increased, it promotes the binding of Keap1-Nrf2, lowering
  the level of antioxidants and promoting the release of NF-κB by IKKβ by stimulating
  BCL10, thereby promoting the increase in cytokines and apoptosis. Finally, the mechanism
  underlying the changes in the FOXO family under the combined effects of both reproductive
  and oxidative stress remains unclear. It can only be demonstrated that JNK undergoes
  dephosphorylation of FOXO1 under the action of cAMP and ROS when oxidative stress
  occurs to induce it to enter the nucleus and promote apoptosis. When progesterone
  is reduced, nuclear translocation occurs in FOXO1, and it is phosphorylated
