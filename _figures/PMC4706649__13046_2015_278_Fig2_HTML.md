caption: 'Different apoptotic pathways are modulated by PEDF. 1. PEDF contributes
  to apoptosis in endothelial cells via the extrinsic FAS/FASL pathway [] 2. PEDF
  can sequentially induce the expression of PPARγ and p53 in endothelial cells. Stimulated
  p53 increases pro-apoptotic PUMA, inducing this protein to initiate the intrinsic
  pathway to apoptosis [ ] 3. Also, PEDF mediates endothelial cell apoptosis through
  JNK activation, leading to cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) blockade,
  which propels cells into a pro-apoptotic state []. 4. PEDF can utilize the BCL2
  family of proteins from the intrinsic pathway to stimulate apoptosis in tumors.
  Notably, activated caspase-8 stimulates apoptosis via two parallel cascades: it
  either directly cleaves and activates caspase-3, or it can cleave BID, a pro-apoptotic
  BCL2 family protein. tBID activation of BAX results in oligomerization of BAX on
  the cell membrane []. Anti-apoptotic BCL2 protein inhibits BAX oligomerization by
  sequestering tBID. The ratio of BAX/BCL2 may be more important than either promoters
  alone in determining apoptosis []. (→) means protein activation, and (—) means protein
  inhibition'
