caption: In highly myopic lens, higher TGF-β1 induces increased levels of m6A modifications
  by up-regulation of METTL3, and m6A modified DVL2 mRNA was then stabilized by m6A
  reader IGF2BP3. The m6A modification regulates DVL2-dominant PCP signaling pathway,
  activates downstream p-JNK signaling, and alters cell proliferation, migration,
  and polarity formation, leading to accelerated nuclear cataract formation in high
  myopia
