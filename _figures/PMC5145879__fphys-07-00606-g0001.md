caption: Bioinformatics workflow of microbiome profiling. The first step is the data
  acquisition that can be derived from any NGS technology (Illumina, IonProton, PacBio)
  and generating of the FASTQ file to proceed with the analysis. In the quality control
  step, the aim is to clean and eliminate possible errors in data, for example, to
  discard low quality score and very short reads, quimeric and adapter sequences.
  In addition, it is important to evaluate the presence of some contaminants from
  other organisms, specific GC content bias or repeated sequences that may interfere
  with the assembly step. The following steps depend on the nature of data, whether
  the aim is to sequence a marker gene, such as the 16S rRNA gene or ITS, or to perform
  shotgun metagenomic sequencing. OTU clustering is a critical step and many algorithms
  and strategies have emerged to accomplish a proper classification of sequences for
  a more accurate determination of taxa proportions and diversity indexes (diversity
  assessment). Good assemblies and alignments are an important aspect to reach correct
  gene predictions in the whole genome pipeline. In the functional assignment step,
  we gather a biological understanding for regulation and gene pathway reconstruction,
  obtaining finally the microbiome profiling.
