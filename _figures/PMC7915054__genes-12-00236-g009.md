caption: 'Model that illustrates a scenario for primary root growth recovery during
  osmotic stress. Osmotic stress is perceived in epidermal cells of EZ and integrates
  through TTL1 in the BR/auxin signaling pathway that regulates balanced root growth.
  TTL1 maintain cell wall integrity to sustain cell anisotropic expansion necessary
  to continuous primary root growth. EZ: Elongation Zone; PM: Proximal Meristem; QC:
  Quiescent Center; BR: brassinosteroid.'
