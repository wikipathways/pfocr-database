caption: A. Virions bind to cell-surface attachment molecules and receptors and are
  internalized through endocytosis. B. In the low pH of the endosome, viral glycoproteins
  mediate fusion of viral and cellular membranes, allowing disassembly of the virion
  and release of RNA into the cytoplasm. C. Viral RNA is translated into a polyprotein
  that is processed by viral and cellular proteases. D. Viral non-structural proteins
  replicate the genome RNA. E. Virus assembly occurs at the ER membrane, where capsid
  protein and viral RNA are enveloped by the ER membrane and glycoproteins to form
  immature virus particles. F. Immature virus particles are transported through the
  secretory pathway. In the low pH of the trans-Golgi, network (TGN) furin-mediated
  cleavage of prM drives maturation of the virus. G. Mature virus is released into
  the cytoplasm. Numbers shown in colored boxes refer to the pH of the respective
  compartments.
