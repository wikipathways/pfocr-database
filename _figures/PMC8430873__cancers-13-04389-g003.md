caption: Role of CDK1 in apoptosis induction during the G2 and M phase. During the
  G2 phase, CDK1 inhibition leads to a decrease in anti-apoptotic proteins and an
  increase in pro-apoptotic proteins, stimulating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
  Furthermore, lack of CDK1 activity induces G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, which can
  also lead to apoptosis. During the M phase, CDK1 activity phosphorylates anti-apoptotic
  proteins in low amounts, inactivating them. In the situation of mitotic arrest,
  this phosphorylation is sustained, reaching high enough levels of inactivated anti-apoptotic
  proteins to induce apoptosis.
