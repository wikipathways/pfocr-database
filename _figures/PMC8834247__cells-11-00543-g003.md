caption: Mitochondrial calcium and its implication in cancer mechanisms. Calcium plays
  a role in many mitochondrial mechanisms in cancer cells. mTORC2–AKT induces the
  direct phosphorylation of IP3R, which induces escape from cell death by stopping
  the flow of calcium between the ER and the mitochondria. In liver, lung, breast,
  and colorectal cancers, Mfn2 is able to restore cell death by inhibiting the mTORC2–AKT
  axis []. Bcl-2 exerts calcium-dependent oncogenic activity by inhibiting apoptosis
  stimuli through direct interaction with IP3R and Bax []. During apoptosis, the oncosuppressive
  protein p53 induces the release of calcium from the reticulum to the mitochondria
  by increasing the activity of the SERCA pump. Likewise, the PML protein can interact
  with IP3R3 to induce calcium flux from the ER to the mitochondria, thereby affecting
  apoptosis and autophagy. PTEN is able to block the proteasomal degradation of IP3R3
  induced by FBXL2 (F-box protein) [,]. Apoptosis can be induced by extra or intracellular
  pathways. In the extracellular pathway, an extracellular ligand induces the formation
  of cell death complexes that activate the caspase cascade. In the intrinsic pathway,
  mitochondrial permeabilization induces the release of cytochrome c, which allows
  the formation of the apoptosome and then the activation of caspases []. In human
  leukemia cells, apoptosis can occur using inhibitors of NK-1R, which induces calcium
  efflux from the reticulum to the mitochondria by the IP3R receptor. Because of a
  lack of space, NK-1R is the only membrane receptor represented in the figure. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction is induced by the entry of calcium into the mitochondria via VDAC. ROS
  production and cellular damage induction are induced by the apoptotic axis ATM–CHK2
  []. Autophagy is also a mechanism adopted by cancer cells; the increased expression
  of VGCC reduces autophagy, while a decrease in ORAI1 expression activates autophagy.
  Additionally, an increase in cytosolic calcium allows the activation of CAMKII,
  which in turn activates autophagy by regulating the AMPK–mTOR axis []. In cancer
  cells, IDH1 is mutated in the cytoplasm, and IDH2 is mutated in the mitochondria.
  These enzymes allow the production of oncometabolite 2-HG from α-KG, which induces
  a modification of the methylation of histones [].
