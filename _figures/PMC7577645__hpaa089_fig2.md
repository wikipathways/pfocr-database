caption: 'Schematic representation of the complex interplay between the TNFR1, Nox1,
  and anion channels in oxidant-dependent signaling. The close association of these
  3 proteins along with aquaporins may provide a mechanism by which highly localized
  changes in O2·− and H2O2 concentrations can affect intracellular signaling processes.
  Furthermore, endocytosis of redox-active vesicles that can by trafficked along the
  cytoskeleton may allow local delivery of oxidants throughout the cytoplasm. Collectively,
  this inflammatory signaling pathway influences NF-κB activation via redox-dependent
  activation of ASK1. Downstream activation of the p38 MAPK is a prime driver of NF-κB
  activation while JNK provides negative feedback regulation of Nox1. ERK also contributes
  to NF-κB activation but by an ASK1-independent mechanism that requires receptor
  endocytosis. LRRC8 anion channels support Nox1 activity at the plasma membrane while
  ClC-3 appears to be required for generation of endosomal O2·−. Understanding the
  details of O2·−-dependent TNFα signaling may identify novel opportunities to disrupt
  the process for therapeutic purposes. Abbreviations: ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating
  kinase 1; ClC-3, Chloride Channel 3; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase;
  H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; JNK, c-jun N-terminal kinase; LRRC8, leucine-rich repeat
  containing 8; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappaB; Nox1, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate oxidase 1; O2·−, superoxide; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor alpha; TNFR1,
  TNFα receptor type 1.'
