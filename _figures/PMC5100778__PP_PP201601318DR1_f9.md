caption: Summary of omics and physiological responses in B. nigra during sequential
  O3 and herbivory stress treatments. The model links metabolome and transcriptome
  fluctuations to physiological responses of photosynthesis, CO2 assimilation, and
  stomatal opening. Stress adaptation mechanisms are proposed (1–5). Blue, O3 fumigation
  (5 d at 70 nL L−1, 16 h per day); red, O3 followed by P. brassicae (24 h, 30 first
  instar caterpillars). Up arrows indicate up-regulation (genes) or increase (metabolites),
  and down arrows indicate the opposite. 1 and 2, O3 induces the abiotic stress responses
  of senescence (EIN3 and ERF2) and stomatal closure (MYB44), with feedback on NOGC1
  and FMO.  and / cross talk integrates responses between O3 and sequential herbivory
  (MYC2 and ERF2), with opposite effects on stomatal closure. 3 and 4, Photosystem
  suppression (LHCs) and nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ1) in response to O3 are linked
  to the regulation of glycerolipid metabolism (LPTs, LIP1, and SQD2). Glycerol derived
  from degraded chloroplast membranes enters the  shuttle (GPDHc1/SDP6) to sustain
  NAD+ recycling and mitochondrial activity (SDH1-1, MSD1, and ) as antioxidative
  stress mechanisms. A possible role of glycerol and sugars as osmolytes also is suggested.
  Sequential herbivory restores the glycerolipid pathway for alternative source-sink
  priorities (e.g.  responses [LOXs/MYC2]). 5,  plays multiple roles in plant stress
  adaptation, regulating Ca2+ homeostasis, carbon-nitrogen metabolism, leaf senescence,  scavenging,
  and signaling of plant-insect interactions.
