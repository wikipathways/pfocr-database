caption: 'Type I and II cytokine receptors associate with Janus kinases (Jaks). Cytokine
  binding activates Jaks, which then phosphorylate cytokine receptors allowing STAT
  (signal transducer and activator of transcription) DNA-binding proteins to attach
  to receptors and become phosphorylated. STAT activation leads to their dimerization
  and translocation to the nucleus where they regulate gene expression. Targets along
  the signal transduction pathway, including specific kinase inhibitors, are shown
  (left). In B cells, antigen ligation leads to activation of three main protein tyrosine
  kinases (PTKs) — the Src-family kinases Lyn, Syk and the TEC-family kinase Btk.
  Syk phosphorylates adaptor protein BLNK and, along with Btk, activates PLC γ. Activation
  of PLC γ leads to the release of intracellular Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase
  C (PKC), which activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The MAPK cascade
  activates transcription factors nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and nuclear factor of
  activated T cells (NFAT), allowing gene regulation (right). Abbreviations: BLNK:
  B cell linker protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NFAT, nuclear factor
  of activated T cells; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PLC γ, Phospholipase γ; PIP3K, phosphatidylinositol
  triphosphate kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; STAT, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription; Syk: Spleen tyrosine kinase; DAG, diacylglycerol; IP3, inositol
  1,4,5-triphosphate.'
