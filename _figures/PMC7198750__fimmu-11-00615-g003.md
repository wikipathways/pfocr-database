caption: Interaction of the cGAS-STING pathway with other DNA-sensing pathways and
  its role in cell survival. (A) Absent in melanoma2 (AIM2) pathway and pyroptosis
  and necroptosis. AIM2 can be triggered by cGAMP and form an inflammasome, consequently
  triggering interleukin (IL)-1 production and pyroptosis. Stimulator of interferon
  genes (STING) trafficking to the lysosome ruptures the lysosome membrane, resulting
  in K+ efflux and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to pyroptosis. Cyclic-GMP-AMP
  synthase (cGAS) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) can be a target for caspase-1
  cleaving. Gasdermin D can lead to K+ efflux and inhibition of cGAS. (B) Interferon
  gamma inducible protein 16 (IFI16). IFI16 can be transported to the cytoplasm to
  help to recruit STING and TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1). IFI16 as a PYHIN family
  protein may form the inflammasome only in theory. (C) Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway.
  TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFNβ (TRIF) may be responsible for helping
  the dimerization of STING. STING signaling can induce suppressor of cytokine signaling
  1 (SOCS1) expression, which negatively regulates MyD88 activity. (D) Apoptosis.
  Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) formed by BAX/BAK induced by
  mitochondrial stress can release oxidized mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and cytochrome
  c into the cytosol. Oxidized mtDNA is a suitable ligand for cGAS recognition and
  is resistant to DNaseIII (TREX1) degradation. Cytochrome c binds to apoptotic protease-activating
  factor 1 (APAF1) and initiates the formation of an apoptosome cooperatively with
  caspase-9 to activate caspase-3, which can induce apoptosis. Caspase-3 can cleave
  cGAS.
