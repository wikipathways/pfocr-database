caption: Metabolism in skeletal myoblasts and myotubes. (A) Myoblasts use GLUT1 and
  GLUT3 for glucose uptake. Glycolysis mediated by phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1)
  is necessary for myoblast self-renewal. The low activity pyruvate kinase isoform
  M2 (PKM2) then facilitates accumulation of glycolytic intermediates for anabolic
  metabolism in myoblasts. For example, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which
  is mediated by hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD), shunts glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P) into ribose and NADPH synthesis. ATP citrate lyase (ACL), which generates
  acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) from citrate, is also necessary for myoblast self-renewal. (B)
  Upon cell fusion and differentiation into myotubes, glucose uptake and glycolysis
  are increased by GLUT4, which is sensitive to regulation by insulin-PI3K-Akt signaling.
  Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) also increases, partly owing to
  the switch to the high activity pyruvate kinase isoform M1 (PKM1).
