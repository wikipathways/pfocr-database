caption: Key players of the pathway are shown in blue, whereas the positive modulators
  are shown in yellow and the negative modulators in purple. Endothelial cells (EC)
  is shown in green (top), while the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) is shown in
  red (bottom). The space between the two cells is called myoendothelial junction
  (MEJ). cGMP mediates its cellular functions through cGMP-modulated (cyclic nucleotide-gated,
  CNG) cation channels, cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGKs) and cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases
  (PDEs). BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin; CAV1, caveolin-1; cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate;
  CYB5R3, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase 3; DNA, desoxyribose nucleic acid; eNOS, endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase (NOS3); NO, nitric oxide; NOsGC, NO-sensitive guanylate cyclase;
  Hb2+/Hb3+, hemoglobin α (reduced/oxidized); PDE, phosphodiesterase.
