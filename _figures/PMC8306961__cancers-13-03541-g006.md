caption: Therapy-resistance machinery. Upon arginine-depletion, TAM receptor, Axl,
  is activated by the growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6), resulting in the activation
  of downstream signaling cascades. The activation of signaling pathways leads to
  MYC-induced ASS1 restoration and cell survival. In addition, the TREM1 induces CCL2
  expression via ERK/AKT/mTOR/ STAT3 pathway, which leads to cell survival in ASS1-restoration
  cells, which also leads to the therapy-resistance.
