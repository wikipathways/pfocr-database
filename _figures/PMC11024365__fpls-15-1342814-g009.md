caption: Proposed modeling of antioxidant mechanisms in H. compressa under submergence
  stress. Red font indicates that the gene or transcription factor was up-regulated
  during stress, green font indicates that the gene or transcription factor was down-regulated,
  and blue font indicates that there was a change. The ovals represent genes and the
  rectangles represent transcription factors. H. compressa responded to submergence
  stress by hormonal regulation, metabolic regulation and transcriptional regulation
  through a series of antioxidant pathways, plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid
  biosynthesis pathway and transcription factors. However, N1291 did not respond to
  stress through the plant hormone signal transduction
