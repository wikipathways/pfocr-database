caption: 'Graphical summary of the compensatory pathways activated upon treatment.
  Four pathways are activated during the development of drug tolerance in both PC9
  lung cancer cells and SKMEL28 melanoma cells: IGFR1, YAP, STAT3, and PLC/PKC. The
  mTOR pathway is down-regulated in drug-tolerant cells'
