caption: 'The sphingolipid network: metabolic interconnection between bioactive sphingolipids.
  Ceramide, the central hub of sphingolipid metabolism, is synthesized by the de novo
  pathway (light blue), from serine and palmitoyl CoA, by the sphingomyelinase pathway,
  i.e., through hydrolysis of sphingomyelin mediated by sphingomyelinases (SMase)
  (orange) or by the salvage pathway (green). Ceramide can then be phosphorylated
  to generate Ceramide-1-phosphate and/or deacylated to form sphingosine, which is
  then phosphorylated to generate sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). The catabolism of
  S1P mediated by S1P lyase provides the only exit route from the sphingolipid network.
  CDase, ceramidase; CERK, ceramide kinase; GCase, glucosylceramidase; SMase, sphingomyelinase;
  SM synthase, sphingomyelin synthase; SphK, sphingosine kinase; SPPase, sphingosine
  phosphate phosphatase. The inhibitors mentioned in this Review are indicated in
  red.'
