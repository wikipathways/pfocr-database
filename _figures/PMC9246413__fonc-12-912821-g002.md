caption: 'Mechanism of TMZ-induced cytotoxicity and cellular senescence and possible
  mode of interaction of TMZ and IR. MGMT and IR inhibiting the cytotoxic pathway
  are indicated. DDR: DNA damage response involving the kinases ATR, ATM and the transcription
  factor p53. (A) Genotoxic pathway triggered by O6MeG; futile MMR cycle model. (B)
  MMR and BER of N-methylation lesions cooperate in inducing DSBs. (C) MMR and BER
  of oxidative lesions cooperate in inducing DSBs. (D) DSBs are formed in overlapping
  base excision repair patches of lesions induced by TMZ and radiation. BER, long-patch
  base excision repair; MPG, N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase; OGG1, 8-oxo-guanine-DNA
  glycosylase.'
