caption: Schematic representations of the two main mechanisms that activate NF-κB
  in thyroid cells. (A) Activation of the NF-κB pathway in an inflammatory environment,
  such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Some of the main factors that act throughout transmembrane
  and cytosolic receptors are indicated. (B) Activation of the NF-κB pathway by thyroid
  oncogenes, such as the cytosolic RET/PTC rearranged protein and the cytosolic BRAFV600E
  mutated kinase.
