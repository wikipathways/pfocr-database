caption: HBV- and HCC-related genes in L1 biology. HBx activates c-MYC, and HBx and
  c-MYC synergistically promote tumorigenesis. L1 de novo insertions were preferentially
  localized near the c-MYC gene, which may upregulate gene expression. L1 plays a
  role in genomic rearrangement in MYC-induced oncogenesis. Rad21 is upregulated in
  HBV-related HCC, which drives L1 expression. Upregulation of L1 may enhance L1 retrotransposition
  and thereby cancer development. HBV and L1 sequences are reportedly inserted into
  the TERT gene locus. The insertions upregulate the gene expression, which can affect
  tumorigenesis. The HBx sequence is inserted into L1 loci, which generates HBx-L1
  chimeric transcripts. HBx-L1 functions as a non-coding RNA that activates the oncogenic
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
