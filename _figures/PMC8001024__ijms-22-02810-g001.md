caption: Cohesin cycle in human cells. The cohesin loader, Scc2-Scc4, and unloader,
  Pds5-Wapl, promote dynamic association of cohesin to chromatin in telophase and
  G1. During S phase, Smc3 acetylation and Sororin binding stabilize cohesin association
  to chromatin. Sister chromatids are entrapped by cohesin rings at the replication
  forks and cohesion is established. In prophase, cohesin bound to chromosome arms
  is released by Wapl-Pds5 following phosphorylation of Sororin (“prophase pathway”).
  In contrast, cohesin bound at the centromeres is protected by Shugoshin (Sgo1) and
  protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) against the releasing activity of Wapl. At the metaphase-anaphase
  transition, Shugosin-PP2A dissociates from cohesin. Thus, in anaphase cohesin can
  be cleaved by Separase to enable chromosome segregation. Cohesin drawing has been
  inspired by [] with modifications.
