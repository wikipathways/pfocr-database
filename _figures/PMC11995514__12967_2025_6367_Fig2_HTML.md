caption: 'The core mechanism of apoptosis and related kinases affect the signaling
  pathway. In apoptosis, the outer membrane permeability induced by pore-forming molecules
  Bax and BAK leads to the release of cytochrome c and pro-apoptotic factors, such
  as Smac and Omi. The dimerization of caspase-9 with APAF1 facilitates the activation
  of downstream caspases, specifically caspase-3, -6, and − 7. Extracellular stimulation
  activates DRs, including members of the TNFR superfamily, such as TNFR1, CD95/Fas,
  and TRAIL which can initiate exogenous apoptosis. Additionally, HER2 phosphorylation
  activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. The activation of IGF1R
  occurs upon binding with ligands IGF1 and IGF2, subsequently triggering two major
  pathways, PI3K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK, which regulate apoptosis. Notably, Shp-1-dependent
  inhibition of p-STAT3 significantly enhances apoptosis in triple-TNBC cells. Furthermore,
  EGFR activation can initiate various downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  and ERK/MAPK, which are implicated in cell proliferation, cell cycle progression,
  primary tumor initiation, and metastasis. (Red: Tyrosine kinase; Yellow: Serine-threonine
  kinases; Blue: Lipid kinases.)'
