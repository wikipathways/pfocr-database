caption: Pathways of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) production. Foods are enriched
  in TMAO precursors (choline, carnitine and betaine) or TMAO itself. Choline can
  be metabolized to trimethylamine (TMA) by the choline-utilizing TMA lyase (CutC/D).
  L-carnitine can be metabolized to TMA by the carnitine Rieske-type oxygenase/reductase
  (CntA/B). YeaW and YeaX, the homologs of CntA/B, can also metabolize choline, carnitine
  and betaine to generate TMA. The above processes occur in the microbiota. TMA produced
  in the gut is absorbed into the blood and transported to the liver, where flavin
  monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) catalyzes TMA into TMAO. Dietary TMAO can bypass processing
  by the gut microbiota before intestinal absorption
