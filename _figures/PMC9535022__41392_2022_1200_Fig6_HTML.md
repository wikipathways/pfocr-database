caption: Impact of oncogenic signaling on tumor immune response. a Loss of PTEN protein
  function and improper PI3K activation inhibit efficient LC3 lipidation, which further
  promote resistance to T-cell-mediated killing by inhibiting autophagy. PTEN loss
  could also induce expression of immunosuppressive cytokines, including CCL12 and
  VEGF. b CDK4/6 inhibition enhances T-cell activation through the derepression of
  NFAT family proteins and their target genes, which encodes critical regulators of
  T-cell function. CDK4/6 inhibition could also induce Rb-mediated G1-arrest and promote
  the phenotypic and functional acquisition of immunologic T-cell memory. Besides,
  the PD-L1 protein stability is regulated by the CDK4-SPOP-FZR1 signaling pathway.
  Physiologically, PD-L1 protein stability is negatively regulated through phosphorylating
  its upstream physiological E3 ligase SPOP. This phosphorylation promotes SPOP binding
  to 14-3-3γ, which subsequently disrupts FZR1-mediated destruction of SPOP. The inhibition
  of CDK4/6 inhibits the phosphorylation of SPOP, thus promoting its degradation by
  FZR1, thus increasing PD-L1 protein levels. c Tumor-derived VEGF limits NF-κB activation
  in immature DCs, which in turn leads to defective functional maturation of DCs and
  insufficient induction of tumor immunity. VEGF could also impact the endothelial
  cells expression of immunological molecules. It decreases the expression of VCAM-1,
  which is important for the antitumor T cells adhesion and infiltration into tumors.
  Besides, VEGF also increases the expression of FAS ligand on endothelial cells,
  triggering apoptosis of T cells. VEGF also promotes the expansion of immune suppressive
  MDSCs, which further promotes the recruitment of Tregs. d EZH2 inhibition increases
  the production of CXCL9 and CXCL10, which are attractant cytokines promoting trafficking
  of T cells to tumor. Besides, EZH2 inhibition could selectively target intratumeral
  Tregs and reduce its immunosuppressive capacity. e In tumor cells, the ablation
  of LSD1 in cancer cells increases repetitive element expression, including ERVs,
  and decreases expression of RISC components. This leads to dsRNA stress and activation
  of type 1 interferon, which stimulates antitumor T-cell infiltration. In addition,
  inhibiting LSD1 in CD8+ T cells unleashes the transcription program mediated by
  TCF1, which is critical for the maintenance of the progenitor subset of intratumoral
  CD8+ T cells for persistent tumor control. dsRNA double-stranded RNA, ERVs endogenous
  retroviral elements, MDSCs myeloid-derived suppressor cells, RISC RNA-induced silencing
