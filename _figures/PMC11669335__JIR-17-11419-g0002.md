caption: The extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway
  is activated when the ligand activates the death receptor, recruiting FADD and Caspase-8/10
  to form the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC). Subsequent activation of Caspase-8/10
  and death effector Caspase-3/7 induces apoptosis. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway
  involves the activity of the BCL-2 family of proteins located in the outer mitochondrial
  membrane, and many stimuli lead to permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane
  (MOMP) and further release of cytochrome C. The latter binds to APAF-1 to form the
  DISC. The latter binds APAF-1 to form apoptotic bodies, which then activate Caspase-9
  and downstream Caspase-3/7. In some cells, Bid cleavage also activates BAK/BAX thereby
  leading to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and promoting apoptosis.
