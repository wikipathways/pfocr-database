caption: The left side of this figure depicts the molecular interactions associated
  with continuous movement of variant GC B cells along the stromal network of mature
  FDC that have coated immune complexes on their dense light zone processes through
  FcR and complement receptors. The right side of the figure depicts the intercellular
  engagement of a GC TFH cell and a GC B cell. We have not labeled the molecules as
  there is still very little information on the molecular nature of this interaction
  regarding cell surface molecules or secreted cytokines. The phenotype that has been
  reported is largely similar between effector TFH cells and their GC TFH counterparts.
  The far right of figure depicts the predicted cellular outcomes of Checkpoint IIIA
  and IIIB interactions based on the known output of the GC reaction. There are broadly
  two classes of memory B cell that exits the GC 1) high affinity precursors for the
  memory response to antigen re-challenge that exist in a variety of physiological
  states and 2) long-lived PCs that contribute high affinity antibodies to the circulation
  of the animal largely for life. The latter compratment is not considered able to
  react to antigen re-challenge but is nevertheless considered a component of long-term
  B immunity. Finally, each post-GC pathway potentially comprises of all antibody
  isotypes that we propose may be considered to be separable lineages of memory B
  cells. For example, it is likely that IgG1 memory B cells have diverged in development
  from IgA memory B cells and not only received distinct inducing signals to develop
  in the first place (at Checkpoint II), but reside in separable microenvironmental
  niches around the body with distinguishable migratory phenotype, but also require
  unique activation requirements upon antigen re-challenge.
