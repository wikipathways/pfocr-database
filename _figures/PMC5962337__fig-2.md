caption: Cu at synapse and redox signaling. (a) After activation of NMDAR, Cu is released
  at the synapse through the secretory pathway. Several Cu binding proteins are present
  in the synaptic cleft, including PrPC, APP, Aβ peptides, and NKB. (b) The Cu-PrPC
  interaction is particularly important for the modulation of NMDAR activity via S-nitros(yl)ation.
  In turn, NO production is dependent on the activation of NMDAR and its interaction
  with nNOS through the PSD-95. (c) While NKB can assist Cu uptake into astrocytes,
  Cu distribution among Cu-binding proteins at the synapse likely depends on their
  relative concentration and affinities for Cu. (d) On the contrary, α-synuclein is
  an important presynaptic Cu-binding protein found in neurons; it is an IDP that
  can interact with membranes when it acquires α-helix structure at N-terminal region.
  Interestingly, Cu+ binding to the N-Terminal of α-synuclein enhances its α-helical
  conformation. Aβ, amyloid beta; APP, amyloid precursor protein; Cu+, cuprous ion;
  IDP, intrinsically disordered protein; NKB, neurokinin B; NMDAR, glutamate/N-methyl-d-aspartate
  receptor; nNOS, neural nitric oxide synthetase; PrPC, cellular prion protein; PSD-95,
  postsynaptic density protein 95.
