caption: Drugs and antibodies that affect the function of the neuromuscular junction.
  Upon arrival of an action potential, presynaptic P-type VGCC (voltage-gated calcium
  channels) open and calcium enters the motoneuron terminal. This may be negatively
  affected by autoantibodies that block the VGCC, Mg+ or Verapamil. Calcium stimulates
  Ca2+ mediated exocytosis of neurotransmitters via the SNARE complex, which is negatively
  affected by BoNT-A which induces cleavage of one of its components, SNAP-25. Release
  of acetylcholine may also be reduced by corticosteroids or antibiotics. At the postsynaptic
  side, AChRs are densely aggregated, which is regulated via the agrin-Lrp4-MuSK-Dok-7
  signaling pathway. Neural agrin is released by the motoneuron and binds to its co-receptor,
  Lrp4, located in the muscle membrane. Lrp4 and agrin bind as a dimer of dimers to
  the muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), a receptor tyrosine kinase that then phosphorylates
  itself, leading to the attachment of the adapter protein Dok-7. This binding leads
  to a full activation of MuSK and phosphorylation of downstream molecules, cumulating
  in the phosphorylation and dense aggregation of AChRs. The interaction between MuSK
  and Lrp4 can be blocked by autoantibodies, leading to interrupted signal transduction
  and reduced AChR clustering. The AChR clustering can be strengthened by SHP2-inhibitors
  and β2-adrenergic agonists, and de-stabilized by β2-adrenergic antagonists. Binding
  of acetylcholine to the AChR leads to opening of the channel, influx of cations,
  depolarization of the membrane and opening of voltage-gated Na + channels, which
  amplifies the depolarization. A range of drugs was shown to block the AChR, including
  fluoroquinolones, chloroquine, antibiotics, anesthetics, NMBA, telithromycin, curare
  and class Ia antiarrhythmics. Quinidine, a class Ia antiarrhythmic drug, may also
  be beneficial in the context of slow channel CMS with a pathological prolonged open
  state of the AChR. Voltage-gated Na+ channels are inhibited by phenytoin and class
  Ia antiarrhythmics. Acetylcholine is recycled in the synaptic cleft by the acetylcholinesterase
  (AChE), which hydrolyses acetylcholine to choline and acetate. AChE is arranged
  in tetramers attached to collagen q like tail (ColQ), which in turn is anchored
  to the synapse via binding to MuSK. AChE is inhibited by pyridostigmine, leading
  to prolonged presence of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, and is used as first
  line symptomatic treatment in myasthenia gravis.
