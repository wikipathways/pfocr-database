caption: Cellular response to T–R conflicts. (A) The fate of a replication fork facing
  a transcription-induced obstacle would likely depend on the nature of the block,
  whether affecting only one or both replicating strands. (B) Possible outcomes after
  T–R conflicts. Repriming ahead of the fork can directly solve encounters of the
  lagging strand with obstacles, such as DNA–RNA hybrids. In contrast, blocks in unwinding,
  such as those caused by head-on T–R conflicts might induce fork reversal. Fork arrest,
  possibly involving some uncoupling and long ssDNA accumulation, triggers the activation
  of the checkpoint, which is responsible for maintaining the stability of forks,
  thus preventing irreversible collapse. Replication-associated repair functions,
  such as FACT, BRCA1, BRCA2, and FA repair pathway, are required for proper fork
  progression through T–R conflicts such as R loops, likely with the help of specialized
  helicases.
