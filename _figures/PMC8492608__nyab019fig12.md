caption: 'Diagram illustrates signaling pathways involved in hereditary predisposition
  cancer syndromes pathogenesis. Many HCS genetic alterations affect cell cycling
  proteins (LFS, RB, and MAS), DNA repair (ATM, CMMRD, and PPAP), mTOR pathway (NF1,
  NF2, TSC, VHL, and Cowden), or epigenetic modifications (RTS, RTPS, Schwannomatosis,
  and MEN1).  “→,” stimulation; and “⊣” inhibition. Color code: “warm” colors (yellow,
  orange, and peach) represent proto-oncogenic proteins, whereas “cold” colors (blue,
  magenta, violet, and green) represent tumor suppressors. Red patches – names of
  the diseases linked with the associated abnormal proteins. Golden yellow – Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK
  (also known as MAPK/ERK) pathway, one of the main growth signaling pathways. Yellow-green
  – hypoxia-inducible factors sustain growth and development in an oxygen-deprived
  environment. Orange – PI3K-AKT (also known as protein kinase B) pathway, the second
  major cellular growth, and proliferation signaling cascade. AKT phosphorylates more
  than a hundred of other proteins and is highly conservative throughout all eukaryotic
  organisms. The RAS pathway also activates it. Peach – protein kinase A/cAMP pathway;
  regulated by G proteins (Gs activates, Gi inhibits); involved in glucose metabolism,
  cellular growth, and proliferation (via CREB). Lime – proteins involved in cytoskeleton
  regulation and intercellular contacts (WNT/B-catenin pathway, Merlin). WNT pathway
  is a key regulator of cellular polarity, migration, and body axial orientation;
  it also controls regeneration in adult bone marrow, skin, and intestine. Merlin
  is a membrane-cytoskeleton scaffolding protein, normally promotes contact-mediated
  growth and proliferation inhibition through the Hippo pathway (not shown in a diagram).
  Green – DNA reparation proteins; includes single- and double-strand breaks repair
  systems and mismatched base repair system. Mismatch errors occur when DNA in the
  synthetic (S) phase, whereas others can occur throughout the cell cycle. Double-stranded
  breaks, as shown, mostly happen because of ultraviolet radiation, which explains
  sunlight sensitivity in AT. Blue – inhibitory proteins (VHL, NF1, and TSC1/TSC2).
  These are major negative regulators of growth signaling pathways. This group is
  heterogeneous by the mechanism of action. Magenta – cell cycle regulatory proteins;
  includes P53 and RB1 (G1-S checkpoint control). Purple – DNA binding proteins, which
  include SWI/SNF complexes and RNA polymerases. SWI/SNF complexes, as shown, responsible
  for proper chromatin packing and nucleosome sliding. Abbreviations: GF – growth
  factors (such factors as insulin and insulin-like growth factors, epidermal growth
  factor, nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial
  growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor); UV – ultraviolet light; DSB – double-strand
  breaks); RTK – receptor tyrosine kinase; MAPK – mitogen-activated protein kinases;
  MEK – MAPK/ERK kinase; ERK – extracellular signal-regulated kinases; NF1– neurofibromin
  1 protein; NF type 1 – neurofibromatosis type 1; Ras – rat sarcoma proteins; RAF
  – rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase; cAMP – cyclic adenosine monophosphate;
  PKA – protein kinase A; CREB – cyclic AMP response element-binding protein; PI3K
  – phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PTEN – phosphatase and tensin homolog; TSC1/TSC2 –
  tuberous sclerosis complex proteins 1 and 2; mTOR – mammalian target of rapamycin
  complex; CD44 (HCAM) – homing cell adhesion molecule; NF type 2 – neurofibromatosis
  type 2; VHL – von Hippel-Lindau; HIF 1a/1b – hypoxia-inducible factors 1a/1b; LRP5/6
  – low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6; APC – adenomatous polyposis
  coli; SWI/SNF – SWItch/sucrose nonfermentable chromatin-remodeling complexes; MLL
  – mixed lineage leukemia complexes; MEN1 – multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1;
  ATM – ataxia-telangiectasia mutated; CMMRD – constitutional mismatch repair disorder;
  EXO1 – exodeoxyribonuclease 1; Shh – sonic hedgehog protein; PTCH1 – protein patched
  homolog 1; SMO – smoothened; SUFU – suppressor of fused homolog; Gli – glioma associated
  oncogene; PPAP – polymerase proofreading-associated polyposis; Pole – DNA polymerase
  epsilon.'
