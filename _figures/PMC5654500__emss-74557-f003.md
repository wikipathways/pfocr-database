caption: A) Intracellular concentrations of heme must be tightly regulated to sustain
  oxidative metabolism in mitochondria during fasting, while limiting heme-mediated
  oxidative damage. Heme is an endogenous ligand of REV-ERBα, a nuclear receptor that
  acts as a transcriptional suppressor of gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism (not depicted)
  and heme biosynthesis, and that is a critical component of the circadian clock core
  machinery that adapts cellular metabolism to circadian rhythms[, ]. The biological
  role of the binding of heme to TSPO is currently unclear, although a role in porphyrin
  degradation to reduce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production has
  been proposed []. Here, we speculate that TSPO plays a critical role in energy state-dependent
  heme metabolism, and that binding of heme to TSPO could constitute a nuclear transcription-independent,
  signaling pathway to directly modulate mitochondrial metabolism. In this model,
  similar to REV-ERBα being a heme sensor for transcriptional control of energy balance
  in the nucleus, TSPO binds free heme or porphyrins. Based on this interaction, mitochondrial
  ATP production is reduced through unkown mechanisms, while TSPO-catalyzed degradation
  of heme and porphyrins reduces ROS toxicity. B) When the demand for heme increases
  during fasting, the transcriptional co-regulator PGC1α induces expression of Alas1,
  which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of heme biosynthesis, as well as that the
  gluconeogenic genes Pck1 and G6pc in the liver [, ]. In addition to the heme - REV-ERBα
  -nuclear axis, low levels of free heme may activate TSPO and release ATP production
  in mitochondria. Thus, the binding of heme to TSPO may integrate mitochondrial metabolism
  with nuclear gene transcription to regulate cellular energy balance and to reduce
  oxidative damage. Genetic lack of TSPO in mouse microglia or drosophila leads to
  decreased ATP production [, ]. Furthermore, treatment of fasted mice or zebrafish
  with synthetic TSPO ligands enhances the activation of a fasting gene signature
  in the liver, including increased expression of Alas1, Pck1 and G6pc in the liver
  []. Dashed arrows indicate hypothetical links, whereas continuous lines represent
  experimentally established connections. Pgc1a, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ coactivator 1 alpha; G6pc, glucose-6-phosphatase; Pck1, phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase;
