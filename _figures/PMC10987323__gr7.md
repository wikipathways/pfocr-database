caption: Role of mtETC in regulating bacterial infection. The inhibited bacterial
  species are shown the right. C I triggers mtROS production, which induces NLRP3
  activation leading to the production of HIF-1α-mediated IL-1β production; on the
  other hand, mtROS inhibits IL-10 production which prevents polarization of macrophages
  into M2 macrophages. C I-mediated mtROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines production
  inhibit E. coli, S. typhiumurium, M. avium, and S. saprophyticus infection. C II
  also induces RET-induced mtROS through C I. C II contributes to the inhibition of
  E. coli, and S. typhiumurium infection, and succinate, which is a substrate of C
  II, acts as a positive regulator of HIF-1α, leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine
  production. C III is the major producer of mtROS, both in the IMS and the mitochondrial
  matrix, thus restraining L. monocytogenes infection. C IV inhibits L. monocytogenes
  infection by maintaining high mitochondrial respiratory activity, however, C IV
  also negatively regulates M1 polarization and phagocytosis. The broken blue arrows
  represent the enhanced production of mtROS and/or activation of signaling pathway;
  the broken red lines represent the suppression of the signaling pathways and the
  type of bacterial infection controlled by respective mtETC complex. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
