caption: A working model for the feedback regulatory loop involving PAP1/MYB75 and
  TAS4 in response to sugars in Arabidopsis. PAP1 expression is induced by Suc, Glc
  or other stimulus. PAP1 may regulate TAS4 expression presumably by binding to the
  PAP1 cis-regulatory elements in TAS4 promoter and transactivate its transcription.
  Alternatively, TAS4 expression may directly respond to sugar stimulus through a
  signaling pathway involving PAP1. Increased TAS4 transcript abundance generates
  more TAS4-siR81(−) through the ta-siRNA pathway, which then down-regulates PAP1,
  PAP2 and MYB113 expression levels. miR828 controls MYB113 expression by guiding
  MYB113 transcripts into RISC. At the same time, miR828 also promotes TAS4 cleavage
  and routes its cleaved product into ta-siRNA pathways for TAS4-siR81(−) biogenesis,
  which reinforces the feedback loop involving PAP1 and TAS4, as well as the regulatory
  network on PAP2 and MYB113 by TAS4. It is not clear whether PAP1 regulates MIR828
  transcription, or whether miR828 can down-regulate the expression level of MYB82,
  a putative miR828 target
