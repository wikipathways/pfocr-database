caption: Biosynthetic pathway from EPA to 5S,18R‐DiHEPE (RvE2) and 5S,18S‐DiHEPE (18S‐RvE2)
  via 18R‐HEPE and 18S‐HEPE in the presence of cysteine as a reducing agent by the
  sequential reactions of the engineered 18R‐LOX from S. cellulosum or engineered
  18S‐LOX from A. violaceum and D. rerio 5S‐LOX, respectively. The biosynthetic pathways
  from EPA to RvE2 and from 18S‐RvE2 via 5S‐HEPE are unavailable because the engineered
  18R‐LOX and 18S‐LOX exhibited little activity for 5S‐HEPE
