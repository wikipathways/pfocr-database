caption: Schematic model of apoptotic melanocyte death mediated by FADS1 downregulation.
  Downregulation of FADS1 increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which
  led to inhibition of the p38/ERK MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, Downregulation
  of FADS1 induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in PIG1 cells via inhibition of
  the p38/ERK MAPK signaling pathway.
