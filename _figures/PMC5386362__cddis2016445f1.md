caption: E1A ‘throws the PIDD switch' to favor caspase-2-mediated apoptosis. Expression
  of E1A increases cellular sensitivity to both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis-inducing
  stimuli by altering several cellular mechanisms. E1A sensitizes cells to extrinsic
  apoptosis induced by members of the TNF-super family (TNF-α, Fas Ligand [FasL] and
  TRAIL) by increasing death receptor expression and caspase 8 activation and by repressing
  NF-κB dependent anti-apoptotic defenses. In the case of intrinsic apoptosis pathway
  triggering by DNA-damage-inducing stimuli, E1A might also repress the NF-κB dependent
  response, but the essential E1A activity is enhancement of processing of PIDD-C
  to PIDD-CC, which pushes the balance of intrinsic pathway activities toward caspase-2-dependent
  mitochondrial injury and cell death
