caption: Hsp70 has been linked to multiple steps of the protein misfolding and aggregation
  pathway, including in preventing misfolding, blocking early stages of aggregation
  and in mediating the degradation of misfolded intermediates through coupling to
  the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The Hsp70 co-chaperones BAG2 and CHIP have both
  been linked to clearance of misfolded proteins. In some systems (including yeast
  prions), Hsp70 activity is required for fibril formation. For simplicity, this schematic
  encompasses broad aspects of the misfolding pathway of amyloid beta, polyglutamines
  and tau, although important differences likely exist. See the main text and  for
  references.
