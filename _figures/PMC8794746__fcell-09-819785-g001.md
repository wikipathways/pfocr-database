caption: Mechanisms of LINC00346 in HCC (HCC). LINC00346 upregulates the expression
  levels of CDK1 and CCNB1 by sponging miR-199a-3p in HCC. It attenuates cell invasion
  and apoptosis and to regulates the cell cycle by regulating p53 and the miR-199a-3p/CDK1/CCNB1
  axis. LINC00346 facilitates WDR18 expression and activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  by acting as a sponge of miR-542-3p in HCC. β-catenin and LINC00346 form a positive
  feedback loop by interacting with MYC. Finally, LINC00346 affects cell proliferation
  and survival by activating the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway.
