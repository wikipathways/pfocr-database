caption: 'Schematic representation of adenosine biosynthesis and complex signalling
  pathways induced by adenosine receptors activation. Adenosine is a purine nucleoside
  continuously generated from the catabolism of adenine nucleotides via a cascade
  of nucleotidases. Regarding the fate of intracellular adenosine, it may (preferentially)
  re-enter the purines savage pathway by intracellular phosphorylation via adenosine
  kinase (ADK) or it is inactivated to inosine by adenosine deaminase (ADA). The main
  source of adenosine results from the hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)
  by SAH hydrolase. Under low oxygen availability and/or during high energy working
  loads, recruitment from ATP hydrolysis increases favouring intracellular adenosine
  accumulation, which promotes its diffusion to the extracellular medium via equilibrative
  nucleoside transporters (ENTs). Extracellular adenosine may also result from the
  extracellular breakdown of released adenine nucleotides, namely adenosine 5′-triphosphate
  (ATP), ADP (adenosine 5′-diphosphate), and AMP (adenosine 5′-monophosphate), by
  a cascade of ecto-nucleotidases bound to the plasma membrane. CD39 dephosphorylates
  ATP directly into AMP; the rate limiting enzyme of the ecto-nucleotidase cascade
  is ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73, which dephosphorylates AMP to adenosine and inorganic
  phosphate. Extracellular adenosine levels are tightly regulated by cellular uptake
  via ENTs and/or by deamination into inosine by ADA. Adenosine activates 4 G protein-coupled
  receptor (GPCRs) known as P1 receptors (adenosine receptors (ARs): A1AR, A2AAR,
  A2BAR, A3AR). In brief, A1AR and A3AR are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase
  (AC) through binding to Gi and Go proteins, resulting in decreased intracellular
  cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Both A2AAR and A2BAR are coupled to Gs proteins and stimulate
  AC leading to increases in cAMP accumulation. Despite the canonical positive and
  negative coupling to the AC/cAMP system, A1AR, A2BAR, and A3AR are also entitled
  to activate phospholipase C-beta (PLC- β) isoform, resulting in increased inositol
  1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization; intracellular Ca2+
  and diacylglycerol (DAG) production contribute to stimulate Ca2+-dependent protein
  kinase C (PKC) and/or downstream Ca2+-dependent pathways. Adapted from (Borea et
