caption: Regulation and interaction of Rac1-related signaling pathways at the postsynaptic
  terminal. Effectors of FXS and Huntington's disease, such as FMRP and HTT, can directly
  activate or inhibit Rac1 activity to modulate its downstream signaling cascades,
  mainly via the Rac1-PAK-cofilin pathway, which subsequently influences synaptic
  plasticity. In schizophrenia, NMDA receptors activate Kal-7 via TIAM1, while DISC1
  and NRG1/ErbB4 interact with Kal-7 to activate or inhibit Rac1. In ASD, SHANK3 directly
  modulates Rac1 activity, while other effectors like AUTS2, P-Rex-1, and Elmo2/Dock180
  form a complex to modulate Rac1 activity and then affect NMDA receptor activity
  through the PAK pathway. In Rett syndrome, BDNF activates TrkB receptors to modulate
  the activity of CDKL5 and MECP2 that further regulate the function of the Rac1-cofilin
  pathway. Abnormalities of these proteins in any pathways may affect neuroplasticity
  and cause neurodevelopmental disorders.
