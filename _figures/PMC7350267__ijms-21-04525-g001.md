caption: Cellular and Molecular effects of Angiotensin II on VSMC. Angiotensin II
  (Ang II) is produced from the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I by
  renin, and then cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) into Ang II. Ang
  II is recognized by a G-protein-coupled receptor, Angiotensin type 1 (AT1R). Canonical
  GPCR signaling activates receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) as well as activating the NAD(P)H complex, resulting in generation
  of reactant oxygen species (ROS), a potent second messenger. In addition to regulation
  of VSMC contractility in a calcium/calmodulin-mediated pathway, AT1R stimulation
  results in activation of MAPK, and ultimately, NF-κB transactivation. Together,
  this leads to VSMC pathophysiological responses such as matrix production, hypertrophy,
  hypercontractility, vascular remodeling and hypertension.
