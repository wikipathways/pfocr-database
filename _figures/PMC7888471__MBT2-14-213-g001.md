caption: (A) The overall pathway scheme of electron transport chain in engineered
  mutants with heterologous gene expression for synthesis of reduced compounds. The
  redox cofactor NADH is generated by glycolysis and TCA cycle and consumed by electron
  transport chain under aerobic conditions. The intracellular NADH can be accumulated
  when the activity of electron transport chain was inactivated despite aerobic conditions.
  The two NADH dehydrogenases (Nuo and Ndh) and two terminal oxidases (Cyo and Cyd)
  were removed in combinations, and expression of quinone synthesis pathway (ubiE)
  was modulated in this study, resulting in the construction of seven ETC mutants.
  The heterologous pathways were expressed using the electron transport chain inactivated
  mutants as host strains to produce reduced compounds. The overexpressed heterologous
  genes are marked in blue (budB, acetolactate synthase; budA, acetolactate decarboxylase;
  budC, acetoin reductase; ilvC, ketol‐acid reductoisomerase; ilvD, dihydroxyacid
  dehydratase; kivD, α‐ketoisovalerate decarboxylase; and adhA, alcohol dehydrogenase).
  The required cofactors for synthesis of reduced compounds such as 2,3‐butanediol
  and isobutanol are marked in red. Several metabolites were written in abbreviation
  (2,3‐DIV, 2,3‐dihydroxyisovalerate; KIV, 2‐ketoisovalerate; UQ, Ubiquinone; and
  MK, Menaquinone). (B) Modification of ubiE 5′‐UTR using CRISPR/Cas system. The expression
  levels of UbiE in wild‐type strain were predicted and synthetic UTR sequences which
  are expected to have lower expression levels were designed by UTR designer. The
  RBS of ubiE was replaced using CRISPR/Cas9 guided cleavage followed by the repair
  of the broken DNA via homologous recombination. As a result, three engineered strains
  were constructed (UbiE117, UbiE86 and UbiE26).
