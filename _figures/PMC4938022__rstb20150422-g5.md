caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the different mechanisms by which P2 receptor
  subtypes might alter cancer cell function. P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors could affect
  the rate of cell proliferation through altering the intracellular levels of cAMP
  by modulating adenylyl cyclase (AC) or by increasing intracellular calcium levels
  through the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. P2X5 and P2Y11 receptor activation might
  switch the cell cycle from proliferation into a state of differentiation. The P2X7
  receptor activates the apoptotic caspase enzyme system. IP3, inositol trisphosphate.
