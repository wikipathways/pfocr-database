caption: The energy-yielding substrates (fatty acids, glucose, ketones, and amino
  acids), via specific catabolic pathways, converge on acetyl CoA production with
  subsequent entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The final step of energy
  transfer is accomplished through oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), supplying greater
  than 95% of ATP consumed by the heart. The boxes (in pink) above each metabolic
  pathway indicate the pathological and/or physiological condition in which the specific
  substrate becomes a predominant contributor to metabolism. TAG, triacylglycerol;
  DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase; ATGL, adipose triglyceride lipase; mCPT1,
  muscle form of carnitine palmitoyl transferase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; TCA,
  tricarboxcylic acid; O2, oxygen.
