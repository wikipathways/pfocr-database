caption: 'AKT regulates cell survival, proliferation, metabolism, and growth by phosphorylating
  multiple down-stream substrates. This figure shows the three main targets phosphorylated
  by AKT: FoxO, GSK3 and TSC2. FoxO inhibits survival and proliferation while promoting
  metabolism. In B cells, FoxO affects B cell development and differentiation via
  regulating RAG expression, inhibiting class-switch recombination and promoting plasma
  cell differentiation. GSK3 inhibits survival, proliferation, and metabolism after
  being phosphorylated by AKT. In B cells, GSK3 affects B cell survival, proliferation
  and function. After the inactivation of GSK3, FoxO1 relocalize in nucleus, this
  increase of FoxO1 initiate the transition from LZ to DZ. By inhibiting the mTOR
  signaling pathway via TSC2, AKT affects cell cycle and differentiation'
