caption: Schematic of cell interactions and differentiation. Apoptosis was induced
  in SKOV3 cells using DDP. Following stimulation by apoptotic SKOV3 cells, M0 macrophages
  (M0-DS macrophages) express M2 macrophage markers, and promote the proliferation
  and migration of SKOV3 cells by activating the ERK pathway. DPP, cisplatin; IL,
  interleukin.

  macrophages and promote the proliferation and migration of ovarian cancer cells
  by activating the ERK signaling pathway.
