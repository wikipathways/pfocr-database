caption: Autophagy in non-cancer cells supports unique metabolic properties in PDAC.
  In response to stimuli from PDAC cells, PSCs become activated and secrete alanine
  in an autophagy-dependent manner. This PSC-derived alanine is taken up by PDAC cells
  and used to fuel the TCA cycle and biosynthesis of free fatty acids (FFAs)(red),
  allowing PDAC cells to use glucose and glutamine primarily to generate nucleic acids
  [](blue) and NADPH for redox control [](green). Ac-CoA acetyl-CoA, Ala alanine,
