caption: Potential molecular mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors on iron homeostasis, mitochondrial
  function, and cardiac microvasculature in diabetic cardiomyopathy. SGLT2Is can reduce
  cardiomyocyte sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca2+) by inhibition of NHE activity in cardiomyocytes.
  In addition, SGLT2Is also regulate Ca2+ through enhancing SERCA2α function and CaMKII
  activation. SGLT2Is can enhance mitochondrial function by improvement of mitochondrial
  fusion–fission proteins, such as Mfn1:Mfn2 ratio and Fis1, as well as Drp1, which
  is dependent of AMPK activation. Activation of the PGC1α–NRF1–Tfam signaling pathway
  by SGLT2Is play a crucial role in regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in the
  diabetic heart. Microcirculation can be improved by SGLT2Is by eNOS phosphorylation
  and NO-dependent improvement of endothelial function. All these changes have beneficial
  effects on attenuation of cardiac stiffness and diastolic dysfunction
