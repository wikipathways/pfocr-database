caption: 'Pathways in HNSCC cells involving growth factor receptors like TGFβ causing
  cell migration and invasion leading to metastasis. MKKs consist enzymes that phosphorylate
  and activate MAPKs, serving as intermediaries in cellular signalling pathways. MAPKs
  are protein kinases that regulate gene expression and cellular processes in response
  to extracellular stimuli through phosphorylation of target proteins. MAP3K7 is a
  protein kinase that activates downstream MKKs in the MAPK signalling pathway, involved
  in diverse cellular processes such as immune responses and inflammation. Abbreviations:
  TGFβ, transforming growth factor beta; TGFBR, transforming growth factor beta receptor;
  RAS, rat sarcoma virus; RAF, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma; MEK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase; MKK, MAP kinase kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  MAP3K7, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7; NF-κΒ, nuclear factor
  kappa B; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3 kinase; AKT, protein kinase B; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; TFs, transcription
  factors; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid. Created with
