caption: The role and mechanism of L-serine in host homeostasis. (a) L-serine is used
  to prevent and treat fatty liver diseases by increasing homocysteine metabolism.
  (b) L-serine significantly reduces ingestion and weight gain by reducing the expression
  of foodborne peptides. (c) L-serine addition reduces blood sugar and improves blood
  glucose tolerance, thereby reducing the incidence of type 1 diabetes in Non-obese
  diabetes (NOD) mice. (d) L-serine improves blood glucose tolerance, thus reducing
  the incidence of diabetes by regulating the composition of sphingomyelin, which
  regulates insulin folding, proliferation and apoptosis. (e) L-serine inhibits oxidative
  stress by increasing GSH and activating the AMPK pathway. (f) L-serine reduces macrophage-
  and neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses by inhibiting inflammasomes. (g)
  L-serine significantly reduces the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (e.g.
  TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8) via the NF-κB signaling pathway
