caption: Relative to physiological regulation of thrombosis (left), porcine endothelium
  exposed to human blood is activated by binding of anti-pig antibodies, creating
  a prothrombotic environment (middle). Physiologically inappropriate amplification
  of blood clotting is contributed to by ineffective neutralization of human thrombin
  by porcine thrombomodulin, inefficient conversion of protein C (PC) to activated
  PC (aPC) by thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, and low-affinity binding of human aPC
  to porcine endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), which in turn leads to inefficient
  thrombin degradation and reduced cytoprotective signaling through endothelial cell
  proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1). These molecular incompatibilities between
  species are addressed by expression of human thromboregulatory proteins, including
  human thrombomodulin and human EPCR (right), as well as human tissue factor pathway
  inhibitor (not illustrated). WT indicates wild-type.
