caption: Factors Implicated in Insulin/Growth Factor-Induced Regulation of Mammalian
  or Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Complex-1 (mTORC1). In response to cellular
  stimulation by mitogens (e.g., insulin/growth factors), activation of the mTORC1
  protein complex leads to phosphorylation of several downstream targets, such as
  Unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1), transcription factor EB (TFEB),
  S6K1, and 4EBP1, to regulate processes such as autophagy, protein synthesis, and
  cell growth and proliferation. The presence of insulin/growth factors leads to increased
  protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activity, which, in turn, phosphorylates and inhibits
  the upstream repressor of mTORC1, known as tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2, which
  forms a complex with TSC1). This consequentially reduces the GTPase-activating protein
  (GAP) activity of TSC2 towards the G-protein Rheb, which then accumulates in its
  GTP-bound active form, thereby promoting stimulation of its target mTORC1. By contrast,
  following insulin/growth factor deprivation, diminished PKB/Akt activity leads to
  increased TSC2 GAP activity towards Rheb and reduced mTORC1 activation. Evidence
  also implicates a role for regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1)
  in modulating the TSC2-Rheb-mTORC1 pathway, whereby REDD1 may act to sequester 14-3-3
  proteins away from TSC2, enabling the latter to then repress Rheb activity. Alternatively,
  REDD1 has been suggested to facilitate the association of protein phosphatase 2A
  (PP2A) with PKB/Akt, leading to inactivation of the protein kinase, which, in turn,
  would promote increased TSC2 GAP activity towards Rheb and subsequent repression
  of mTORC1. In addition to mitogenic stimuli, amino acids also confer a potent stimulatory
  effect on mTORC1 (Box 2 and Figure 2, main text). Black arrows indicate a stimulatory
  effect, whereas blunt red arrows indicate an inhibitory action.
