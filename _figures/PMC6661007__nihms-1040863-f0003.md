caption: Liver disease in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), which
  is caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene (encoding fibrocystin (FPC)), is characterized
  by cystic dysgenesis of the intrahepatic bile ducts that retain an immature phenotype
  reminiscent of the embryonic biliary structures (ductal plate malformations). The
  disease is associated with progressive portal fibrosis, leading to portal hypertension
  and related complications. In FPC-defective cholangiocytes, increased levels of
  cAMP activate protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin (β-Cat)
  at Ser675 that leads to the nuclear translocation of pSer675β-catenin and transcriptional
  activation. This mechanism mediates the secretion of CXC-chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1),
  CXCL10 and CXCL12 that recruit inflammatory cells, mostly M1 and then M2 macrophages,
  around the cystic epithelium. Macrophages secrete transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)
  and TNF and stimulate the expression of αVβ6 integrins on cystic cholangiocytes
  that in turn activate latent TGFβ. CXCL10 secretion is further increased by the
  production of IL-1β through the activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. IL-1β secretion is mediated by
  an activated inflammasome. Signalling molecules that are druggable are highlighted
  in bold and detailed in . ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing
  a CARD; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; NLRP3, NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing
  3.
