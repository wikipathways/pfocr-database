caption: Schematic representation of the role of small catalytic amounts of external
  cytochrome c for transferring electrons from cytosol into mitochondria via enzymatic
  (OMM Cyb5R3-dependent) (A) and non-enzymatic (ascorbate-dependent) pathways (B)
  [according to data described in La Piana et al. [, , , ]]. The authors have suggested
  that in physiological conditions, cytochrome c might be transferred in a very limited
  amount outside the mitochondria so as to promote the activation of Cyb5R3-dependent
  electron transport pathway. The process is highly dependent on induction of contact
  sites in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes (membrane remodeling), as well
  as on inhibitors of VDAC1. The activity of this Cyb5R3/VDAC1-dependent system becomes
  functional in removing the excess cytosolic NADH and is essential for cell survival
  under impairment of the ETC at the level of one of the first respiratory complexes.
  Since the Cyb5R3-catalyzed electron transfer generates an electrochemical membrane
  potential associated with the activity of the cytochrome oxidase, it represents
  an additional pathway for providing energy to cells. This aspect is essential for
  the cells in which oxidative phosphorylation activity is not properly supported
  by the respiratory chain. Such phenomenon is observed in cancer cells. (B) The same
  authors also demonstrate a non-enzymatic induction of this alternative pathway for
  ATP synthesis in mitochondria). They added ascorbate (instead of NADH) and small
  catalytic amounts of external cytochrome c to intact mitochondria and detected oxygen
  uptake, accompanied by cytochrome c reduction and ascorbate oxidation. These processes
  are dependent on Complex IV and induction of contact sites in mitochondrial membrane,
  and are sensitive to inhibitors of VDAC1.AFR – ascorbate free radical; DH – NAD-dependent
  cytosolic dehydrogenases; ETC – electron-transport chain; OMM – outer mitochondrial
  membrane; S – oxidized substrate; SH2 – reduced substrate; VDAC1 – voltage-dependent
  anion channel 1.
