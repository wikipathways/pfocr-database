caption: The agr locus has been investigated in detail and is known to contain two
  divergent transcripts named RNAII and RNAIII []. The RNAII transcript is an operon
  of four genes, agrBDCA, that encode factors required to synthesize AIP and activate
  the regulatory cascade. Briefly, AgrD is the precursor peptide of AIP, AgrB is a
  membrane protease involved in generating AIP, AgrC is a histidine kinase that is
  activated by binding AIP, and AgrA is a response regulator that induces transcription
  of both RNAII and RNAIII. The RNAIII transcript yields a regulatory RNA molecule
  that acts as the primary effector of the agr system by up-regulating extracellular
  virulence factors and down-regulating cell surface proteins []. The agr pathway
  is illustrated here with potential target sites for 224C-F2.
