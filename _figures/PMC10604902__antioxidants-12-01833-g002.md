caption: Oxidative stress is a critical factor in the onset and progression of AF.
  The susceptibility to paroxysmal AF is increased due to automaticity, triggered
  activity, and electrophysiological and structural remodeling of pulmonary veins.
  The arrhythmia triggers are promoted by ROS, which lead to afterdepolarizations.
  Electrophysiological and anatomical alterations in pulmonary veins cause conduction
  slowing and altered depolarizing and repolarizing currents, which, in turn, promote
  reentry-triggered activity. ROS target sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins, causing
  RyR2 dysfunction and increased Ca2+ leak, activation of NXC in reverse mode, and
  triggered activity in atrial CMs. Additionally, ROS contribute to AF progression
  by inducing electrophysiological and structural remodeling in atria. Membrane current
  flux is altered by ROS, accelerating membrane repolarization and shortening the
  refractory period, thereby accelerating reentry. In structural remodeling, ROS enhance
  profibrotic pathways and disarray integral components of gap junctions (connexins),
  slowing cardiac conduction or increasing conduction heterogeneity, favoring reentry.
