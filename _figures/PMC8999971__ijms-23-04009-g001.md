caption: Schematic representation of sphingolipid metabolism. The de novo synthesis
  pathway begins in the cytosolic leaflet of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
  It starts with the condensation of palmitoyl coenzyme A (CoA) and serine, followed
  by several enzymatic reactions (red arrows) leading to the formation of sphinganine,
  sphingosine (S) and then ceramide (Cer). Once generated, Cer is transported to the
  Golgi apparatus where it is converted to sphingomyelin (SM) by SM synthase (SMS).
  SM is then transported to the plasma membrane where under specific condition/stimulation,
  SM can be reconverted in Cer by sphingomyelinase (SMase) that is further transformed
  into S and with the help of sphingosine kinases (SKs) is phosphorylated, thus leading
  to the generation of the bioactive lipid S1-phosphate (S1P) that is transported
  outside the membrane. Of note, the production of S1P is also possible in the lysosomes
  (salvage pathway) where SM is converted into Cer and then S. The S1P generated in
  this pathway can be either transported outside the cells or is reconverted into
  S by S1P phosphatase (SPP). S is finally transformed into Cer by Cer synthase.
