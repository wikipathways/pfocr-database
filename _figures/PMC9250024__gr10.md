caption: Schematic diagram of PACAP signaling based on this study. PAC1R is expressed
  predominantly and plentifully in PIC. PACAP from enteric nerve fibers bind to PAC1R
  in PICs, opens SK3 through increasing intracellular [Ca2+] by IP3 in PIC and hyperpolarize
  (Hyperpol.) them. Hyperpolarization of PIC is propagated to SMCs (pale blue cell)
  via gap junctions (GJ). Hyperpolarization of SMCs reduces the open probability of
  L-type Ca2+ channels (L-VDCC) and decreases intracellular [Ca2+], leading to relaxation
  of SMCs. ICC (pale pink cell) do not seem to be involved in this pathway.
