caption: (A) Fourteen signaling (left) and six groups of metabolic pathways (right;
  grouping of 81 individual metabolic pathways) were selected from the KEGG database
  to develop the S-M interconnected network (SMIN) through PPI. Experimentally validated
  data from the STRING protein-interaction database were used to construct an initial
  HPPIN. The levels of interaction were restricted at the interactors of interactors
  to create the network resulting in four possible linking paths through which selected
  signaling and metabolic pathway proteins could be connected directly or through
  one, two and three PPI. (B) Conversion of interconnecting paths into network representation.
