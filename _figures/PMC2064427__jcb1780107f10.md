caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the signaling mechanisms that control the
  bidirectional responses of the growth cone to BMP7 gradients. In 4–8-h neurons,
  BMP7 induces an attractive response through the LIMK pathway. In overnight neurons,
  BMP7 repels the growth cone through the CaN–SSH phosphatase pathway, which is activated
  by Ca2+signaling through TRP channels. ADF/cofilin acts as the common downstream
  target of these two signaling pathways to locally regulate the actin cytoskeleton
  for distinct turning responses. PM, plasma membrane.
