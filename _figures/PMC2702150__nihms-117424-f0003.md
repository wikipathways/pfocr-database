caption: Interleukin-13 (IL-13) promotes collagen production by three distinct but
  possibly overlapping mechanisms. a | IL-13 is produced by activated CD4+ T helper
  2 (TH2) cells and stimulates the production of latent transforming growth factor-β
  (TGF-β) by macrophages. The activation of latent TGF-β is important for both its
  physiological and pathological actions on target cells, such as fibroblasts. Following
  the intracellular processing of prepro-TGF-β to its latent complex, the latent TGF-β
  is secreted and then anchored to the macrophage membrane through thrombospondin-1
  bound to its receptor, CD36. Activation of TGF-β might be mediated by plasmin/serine
  protease- and/or matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9)-dependent mechanisms. After the
  latency-associated peptide (LAP) is cleaved, TGF-β is free to bind and activate
  TGF-β receptors (TGF-βRs) expressed by fibroblasts. In this pathway, the fibrogenic
  effects of IL-13 are mediated largely by the downstream actions of TGF-β. b | Because
  fibroblasts express IL-13 receptors (IL-13Rs), IL-13 might also directly activate
  the collagen-producing machinery in fibroblasts-. c | IL-13 can also promote the
  alternative activation of macrophages and/or fibroblasts. By upregulating arginase
  activity in these cells, IL-13 increases l-ornithine, l-proline and polyamine concentrations,
  which promotes fibroblast proliferation, collagen production and ultimately, fibrosis.
  Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) produced by TH1 cells seems to antagonize all of these pathways.
  IFN-γ inhibits alternative macrophage activation, inducing nitric-oxide synthase
  2 (NOS2) instead of arginase, and directly decreases collagen synthesis by fibroblasts.
  NOS2 activity promotes the production of l-hydroxyarginine, l-citrulline and nitric
  oxide. The intermediate by product l-hydroxyarginine also functions as a potent
  inhibitor of arginase activity, which can further antagonize the fibrotic pathway.
  OAT, ornithine amino transferase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase.
