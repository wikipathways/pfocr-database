caption: 'Characteristic enzymes for the synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP)/dimethylallyl
  diphosphate (DMAPP) and the formation of the isoprenoid diphosphate chain. Mevalonate
  (MVA) pathway: Aact (acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase), Hmgs (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
  CoA synthase), Hmgr (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase). Methylerythritol
  4-phosphate (MEP) pathway: Dxs (1-desoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase), Dxr (1-desoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate
  reductase), Ids (isopentenyldiphosphate: dimethylallyl diphosphate synthase). Condensation
  of IPP and other allylic precursors: DMAPP, GPP (geranyl diphosphate), Gpps (geranyl
  diphosphate synthase), FPP (farnesyl diphosphate), Fpps (farnesyl diphosphate synthase),
  GGPP (geranylgeranyl diphosphate), Ggpps I and II (geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase).
  Carbon sizes of allylic precursors are written in brackets.'
