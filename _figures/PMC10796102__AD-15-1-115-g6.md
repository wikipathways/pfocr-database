caption: Mechanism of action of cerebral lymphatic system in brain diseases due to
  impaired renal function. (A) Indoxyl sulfate (IS) accumulates during impaired renal
  function and activates its receptor AhR (Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor), which in turn
  activates downstream oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptotic pathways. This
  ultimately leads to the damage of astrocytes. This is a common mechanism for the
  development of kidney-induced neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. (B)
  The accumulation of metabolic wastes in the brain is able to increase the expression
  of AQP-4 and widen the perivascular spaces. This induces the development of neurodegenerative
  diseases. (C) The accumulation of metabolic wastes in the brain can cause endothelial
  cell damage, increased AQP-4 expression, and the enlargement of perivascular spaces.
  This can induce the development of cerebrovascular diseases such as intracranial
  aneurysms
