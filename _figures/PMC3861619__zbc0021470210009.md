caption: Proposed iisoA2E formation cascade. A, the proposed biosynthetic pathway
  by which iisoA2E, A2E, isoA2E, and A2-DHP-PE form in the retina. All-trans-retinal
  released from activated rhodopsin after photoisomerization of ground state 11-cis-retinal
  reacts with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the disk membrane to produce the NRPE
  Schiff base that undergoes a [1,6]-proton tautomerization to generate PAE. After
  reaction with a second molecule of all-trans-retinal and 6π-aza-electrocyclization,
  dihydropyridinium A2PE is generated. This intermediate readily undergoes a 1,3-H
  shift and hydrogen atom elimination to give A2-DHP-PE or can eliminate two hydrogens
  to form A2PE. Hydrolysis of the A2PE phosphate ester yields A2E. Because the C13C14
  double bond of all-trans-retinal is most prone to cis-isomerization, yielding 13-cis-retinal,
  this chromophore is considered to coexist with all-trans-retinal in vivo at low
  levels. All-trans-retinal reacts with PE to generate NRPE. After NRPE undergoes
  a [1,6]-proton tautomerization to PAE, the intermediate reacts with 13-cis-retinal
  (not all-trans-retinal). Following 6π-aza-electrocyclization, dihydropyridinium
  isoA2PE forms and undergoes facile auto-oxidation to isoA2PE. Ester hydrolysis removes
  phosphatidic acid from isoA2PE to produce isoA2E. As an alternative, after PAE reacts
  with 13-cis-retinal to form a 13-cis-iminium salt, the latter undergoes a hydrogen
  shift, C13C14 double bond cleavage, and 6π-aza-electrocyclization to generate an
  intermediate bearing a three-membered ring that readily opens. Following opening
  of the three-membered ring at the C14C15 single bond and shift of C13-H to C15,
  dihydropyridinium iisoA2PE is generated. Facile auto-oxidation of this intermediate
  with the loss of two hydrogen atoms gives rise to iisoA2PE, which is cleaved by
  hydrolysis of the phospholipid to release iisoA2E. A2E and isoA2E can be interconverted
  by light. B, proposed mechanism by which isoA2E is converted into iisoA2E by light.
  isoA2E undergoes C13C14 double bond cleavage and a shift of 6-H to C13 to produce
  an intermediate with a three-membered ring. Photochemical ring opening and intramolecular
  hydrogen shift occur in this intermediate, leading to formation of iisoA2E. PLD,
  phospholipase D.
