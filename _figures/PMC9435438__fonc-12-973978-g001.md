caption: 'Oxygen-sensing regulatory pathway of HIF1α and HIF2α. A schematic view of
  HIF1α and HIF2α regulation via the action of oxygen sensors prolyl hydroxylases
  (PHDs) and factor inhibiting HIF (FIH). (A) PHD and FIH are HIFα hydroxylases that
  require iron (Fe2+) and ascorbate as co-factors and utilize 2-oxoglutarate and molecular
  oxygen as co-substrates of their enzymatic reaction, with the release of CO2 and
  succinate as waste products. In the presence of oxygen, these enzymes catalyze hydroxylation
  of HIF1α and HIF2α at proline (P) and asparagine (N) residues respectively, thus
  provoking a dual effect: PHDs cause HIFα polyubiquitination and degradation by the
  proteasome, while FIH inhibits binding of co-activators like CREB-binding protein
  (CBP) and p300 to the HIF transcriptional complex. (B) In conditions of oxygen scarcity,
  the activities of PHDs and FIH are inhibited and HIFα subunits become stabilized,
  dimerize with HIF1β and bind hypoxia responsive elements (HREs) within the regulatory
  regions of specific target genes to activate their transcription. (C) HIFα factors
  may also recognize HREs in the minus DNA strand (reverse HRE, rHRE) thus allowing
  recruitment of histone methyltransferases or deacetylases (EZH2 and HDAC1) and provoking
  epigenetic silencing and transcriptional repression.'
