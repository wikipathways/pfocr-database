caption: A diagram of miRNAs associated with major altered pathways reported in GBM
  development, including the P53 pathway, RB pathway, and P13K pathway. The function
  and the interaction of these miRNAs are based on their mechanistic studies following
  their baseline expression in GBM cells and tissue. An arrow (→) out of any miRNA
  represents a direct activation towards a targeted gene. For example, in the nucleus,
  it is reported that miR-126 targets P53, and an increase in miR-128 expression leads
  to an increase in the expression level of P53. Conversely, the symbol (⊢) represents
  an inhibition by miRNA towards a targeted gene. For example, an up-regulated expression
  of miR-34a leads to an inhibition in the expression of cyclin D gene. Figure created
  with BioRender.com.
