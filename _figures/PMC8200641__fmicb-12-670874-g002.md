caption: UPR participates in the pathological damage caused by parasite infection.
  (A) T. Cruzi (yellow) infection caused heart damage, with upregulation of PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP
  pathway, and 2-aminopurine treatment alleviated the heart’s pathological damage.
  (B) P. berghei (red) infection induced neuronal cell death and caused experimental
  cerebral malaria by activating the three branches of the UPR (PERK-eIF2α-ATF4/GADD34,
  IRE1-XBP1s, ATF6). (C) Rhoptry protein 18 (ROP18) of T. gondii (orange) phosphorylated
  reticulon 1-C (RTN1-C), which led to the acetylation of GRP78 and further upregulated
  the expression of cleaved caspase-12, CHOP, cleaved caspase-3, and induced the apoptosis
  of neural cells. (D) S. japonicum (blue) infection led to increased levels of CHOP,
  which was involved in hepatic fibrosis, and the treatment with taurine suppressed
  the egg-induced hepatic granuloma and fibrosis. PERK, protein kinase RNA-like ER
  kinase; IRE1, inositol-requiring kinase/endoribonuclease 1; eIF2α, α-subunit of
  eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2; ATF6, activating transcription factor
  6; ATF4, activating transcription factor 4; XBP1, X box-binding protein 1; CHOP,
  C/EBP-homologous protein; Bip, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein;GADD34,
  DNA damage-inducible protein-34.
