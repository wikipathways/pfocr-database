caption: 'Proposed hippocampal signaling pathway altered by early amyloidosis. Proteins
  found to be modified by a single oAβ1−42icv. injection are represented in red, with
  a red arrow indicating either up- or down-regulation, while proteins on which they
  exert their effect/modulate are shown in gray and connected with black lines (arrows:
  stimulation; dots: inhibition). Highlighted in green is GSK-3β due to its special
  relevance, as it is modulated by most of the proteins studied, and a decrease in
  its expression along with an overactivation have been found after oAβ1−42 administration'
