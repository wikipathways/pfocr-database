caption: Conflicting roles of RASAL2 in different cancers. (A) RASAL2 inhibits angiogenesis,
  invasion and metastasis of several types of cancer cells. In luminal B breast cancer,
  the loss of RASAL2 activates wild-type RAS and then increases MEK (mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase)/ERK (extracellular regulated protein kinases) and PI3K (phosphoinositide
  3-kinase)/AKT (a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase) signaling to promote
  invasion, and it induces NF-kB activation to promote epithelial–mesenchymal transition
  (EMT). In lung adenocarcinoma, the loss of RASAL2 promotes migration capability
  via EMT through ERK regulation. In ovarian cancer, the loss of RASAL2 activates
  the RAS-ERK pathway, leading to EMT. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), RASAL2 reduces
  Serine9 (Ser9) phosphorylation to activate glycogen synthase kinase-3 β (GSK3β)
  and then decreases the expression of c-FOS and vascular endothelial growth factor
  A (VEGFA) to suppress RCC cells. In bladder cancer, RASAL2 depletion enhances the
  phosphorylation of AKT and then upregulates the expression of ETS proto-oncogene
  1 (ETS1) and VEGFA, leading to angiogenesis. RASAL2 also downregulates sex-determining
  region Y-box 2 (SOX2) and CD44 expression by inhibiting the ERK/mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPK) pathway to induce cancer stemness. (B) RASAL2 promotes invasion
  and metastasis of several types of cancer cells. In triple-negative breast cancer
  (TNBC), miR-136 and miR-203 downregulate RASAL2 to suppress cell migration, EMT
  and invasion. The activation of a RASAL2/ARHGAP24 (Rho GTPase activating protein
  24)/RAC1 (RAS-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1) module contributes to TNBC
  tumorigenesis. RASAL2 is hypomethylated and promotes invasiveness in HCC. Downregulation
  of RASAL2 alters the phosphorylation of the effectors of the MAPK, WNT/β-catenin,
  and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways and then impairs these pathways. RASAL2 is
  also the target of miR-203 in HCC cells. In colorectal cancer (CRC), importin-5
  (IPO5) binds to the nuclear localization signal or sequence (NLS) sequence of RASAL2,
  which induces RAS signal activation. RASAL2 is also involved in the Hippo signaling
  pathway, which promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis by inhibiting the expression
  of large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2) and then increasing the expression of
  yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) in CRC.
