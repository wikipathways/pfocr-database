caption: 'A) Model of multi-agent vs. single agent therapy for CML. The BCR-ABL translocation
  is thought to arise in the stem cell population, giving rise to leukemic stem cells
  (LSC). If untreated, the progeny from the LSC expressing the constitutively active
  tyrosine kinase fusion protein BCR-ABL give rise to expanded cell populations which
  is fatal to the patient. Current clinical care uses targeted therapy against the
  kinase ABL, which does treat the disease. However, mutations within the ABL gene
  can generate a resistant population which can lead to leukemic cell survival. Using
  a BCR-targeted inhibitor is hypothesized to decrease the possibility of resistance,
  and adding a second agent can enhance cell killing. B) Left: A CML cell and a simplified
  disease pathway of CML (black arrows). Current treatment modalities (TKIs) can act
  to reverse these effects; however a potential escape from conventional therapy through
  the autophagy pathway is depicted with grey arrows. Right: Experimental strategies
  for addressing untreated, or resistant populations of CML disease states. (1) The
  CCmut2 targets the BCR domain with a similar effect on in vitro cells as TKIs; (2)

  inhibitor GO-201; (3) Autophagy blockade can be achieved by chloroquine (CQ) or
  by RNAi targeting Atg7; (4) The LSC enhancing factor Alox5 is inhibited by targeting
  5-LO metabolism with zileuton (zil) or degrading Alox5 message using RNAi.'
