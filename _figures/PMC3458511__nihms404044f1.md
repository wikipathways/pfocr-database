caption: 'Schematic representation of the zonulin mechanism of action. A. Resting
  state: During the resting state TJ proteins are angeged in both homophilic and heterophilic
  protein-protein interactions that keep TJ in a competent state (TJ) closed as reflected
  by the complexity of TJ meshwork shown in the freeze fracture electron microscopy
  photograph. B. Following zonulin pathway activation: Zonulin transactivates EGFR
  through PAR2 (1). The protein then activates phospholipase C (2) that hydrolyzes
  phosphatidyl inositol (PPI) (3) to release inositol 1,4,5-tris hosphate (IP-3) and
  diacylglycerol (DAG) (4). PKCα is then activated (5), either directly (via DAG)
  (4) or through the release of intracellular Ca2+ (via IP-3) (4a). Membrane-associated,
  activated PKCα (6) catalyzes the phosphorylation of target protein(s), including
  ZO1 and myosin 1C, as well as polymerization of soluble G-actin in F-actin (7).
  The combination of tight junction protein phosphorylation and actin polymerization
  causes the rearrangement of the filaments of actin and the subsequent displacement
  of proteins (including ZO-1) from the junctional complex (8). As a result, intestinal
  TJ become looser (see freeze fracture electron microscopy). Once the zonulin signaling
  is over, the TJ resume their baseline steady state.'
