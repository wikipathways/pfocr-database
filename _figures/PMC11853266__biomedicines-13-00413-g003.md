caption: Antioxidant effect of taurine. The effects of taurine may be regulated through
  Kelch ECH-associating protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
  2 (Nrf2) cell signaling pathway. Keap1 is a repressor protein that binds to Nrf2
  and promotes its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Taurine reduces
  the level of Keap1, leading to increased Nrf2 and heme oxygenase (HO-1) levels.
  Nrf2 binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) of its target genes to mediate
  gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nrf2 induces the expression of HO-1
  and increases the activity of HO-1. HO-1 catalyzes the degradation of heme into
  carbon monoxide (CO), free iron, and biliverdin, which then is converted to bilirubin
  by biliverdin reductase. Free heme is pro-inflammatory, while CO, bilirubin, and
  HO-1 have significant anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, Nrf2 has been shown to
  induce the quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) expression, which inhibits the activation
  of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. NLRP3 regulates the maturation
  and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines via activating caspase 1. Nrf2 also
  inhibits NF-ĸB transcriptional activity
