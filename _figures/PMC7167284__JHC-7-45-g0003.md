caption: 'Chronic HCV replication in liver cells induces a multifaceted stress response.
  The infection is initiated by the attachment and entry of the virus particle through
  several cell surface receptors. The HCV RNA binds to the ribosome and translates
  a single large polyprotein, which is processed into structural and non-structural
  proteins. Accumulation of viral proteins induces proliferation of ER-membranes and
  formation of membranous web structure. HCV replication in the membranous web produces
  many new genomic positive-strand and negative-strand RNA. Genomic HCV positive-strand
  RNA packages into complete infectious virus particles that release through the secretory
  pathway. Arrows show the emerging new DAAs targeting the viral protein and HCV replication
  cycle.Note: Adapted from Chapter 8,  of Viral Polymerases: Structures, Functions
