caption: Schematic diagram for the proposed model of the PTX resistance in NSCLC cells.
  Continuous exposure of cancer cells to PTX activates a stress-induced kinase p38
  MAPK to develop PTX resistance. In chemo-naïve cells, p53 is generally degraded
  by its E3 ligase, MDM2, conferring the high sensitivity to PTX. However, the constitutively
  activated p38 MAPK in PTX-resistant cells induces the rapid degradation of MDM2
  through the classical ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the consequent stabilization
  of p53. The stabilized p53 translocates to the nucleus and regulates the expression
  of its target genes, including EGFR, which finally leads to the generation of acquired
  resistance to PTX.
