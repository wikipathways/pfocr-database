caption: Schematic representation of the possible mechanism of ANP on the cholesterol
  efflux mediated by the PPARγ/LXRα–ABCA1/ABCG1 signaling pathway in macrophages.
  In the THP-1 derived macrophages, ANP inhibited the transcription of PPARγ and LXRα,
  then the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 was inhibited, thereby inhibiting cholesterol
  efflux from macrophages to apoA-I and HDL mediated by ABCA1 and ABCG1.
