caption: The role of COX-2 in tumorigenesis. COX-2 is induced in the DC cells and
  monocytes infected with M.tb. On the one hand, promotion of tumor metastasis of
  COX-2 depends on the p-Akt-NF-κB pathway affecting the activity of MMP-9. On the
  other hand, up-regulation of COX-2 can increase BCL-2 synthesis to inhibit apoptosis,
  and BCL-2 inhibits mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway, mitochondrial dysfunction
  aggravates DNA damage, which further promotes cell mitosis and tumorigenesis
