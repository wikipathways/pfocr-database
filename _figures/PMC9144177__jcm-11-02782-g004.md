caption: Inflammasome pathway relevant to ACLF predicted by IPA®. IL-10 was identified
  as the main immunomodulatory cytokine in the pathway, inhibiting the inflammatory
  cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α (dotted lines indicate increased or decreased expression,
  while solid lines show activation; Asc, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein
  containing a CARD; CASP, caspase; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; MCP-1,
  monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response
  88; NFκB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; NLRP3;
  NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; PANX1, pannexin 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  TLR-4, roll-like receptor 4; TNF-α, rumor necrosis factor-α).
