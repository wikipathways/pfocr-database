caption: The “canonical pathway” (center) is stimulated when Wnts bind to Fzd receptors
  and Lrp5/6 co-receptors. A cytoplasmic complex composed of GSK3β, Axin, and APC
  is inhibited, allowing cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin levels to rise. Some β-catenin
  translocates to the nucleus where it associates with Tcf/Lef transcription factors
  to regulate gene expression. During non-canonical Wnt signaling (left), Wnts bind
  to a Fzd receptor, Ryk or Ror2, and activate downstream signaling events that do
  not involve GSK3β or β-catenin. Wnt signaling pathways are inhibited by several
  mechanisms (right). Secreted frizzled-related proteins (Sfrps) antagonize canonical
  Wnt signaling by binding the ligands and preventing their association with Fzd receptors.
  Dkk1 suppresses Wnt signaling by forming a ternary complex with Lrp5/6 and Krm1/2.
  Sclerostin (Scl) also binds to Lrp5/6, but not Krm1/2, to antagonize canonical Wnt
  signaling. In the absence of Wnt/Lrp signaling, GSK3β phosphorylates (asterisks)
  β-catenin, which marks it for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation.
