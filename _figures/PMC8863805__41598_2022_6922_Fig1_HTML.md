caption: Scheme of the Notch signaling pathway. The Notch receptor is cleaved at S2
  cleavage site by ADAM 10 protease upon binding to Notch ligand, Jagged from neighboring
  cells. Thus, releasing Notch extracellular domain (NECD) for receptor endocytosis.
  Cleavage of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) at S3 cleavage site by γ secretase
  leads to the translocation of NICD into nucleus. NICD then recruits MAML1, p300,
  CSL and other co-activators to activate the expression of Notch target gene, HES1.
  Beta HPV E6 protein associates with MAML1 and inhibits Notch Signaling. Adapted
