caption: AMBRA1, a novel mitophagy receptor. The PINK1/PARKIN pathway is induced after
  mitochondrial membrane depolarization (indicated as ΔΨm decrease in the figure).
  PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase1) is stabilized on the mitochondria and allows
  mitochondrial recruitment of PARKIN. PARKIN ubiquitylates mitochondria (ubiquitin
  molecules are indicated as “Ub” in the figure), which can then be recognized by
  the cargo protein p62. AMBRA1 (activating molecule in beclin 1 regulated autophagy)
  plays a crucial role in triggering mitochondria degradation by interacting with
  LC3 through its LIR (LC3-interacting region) motif. Furthermore, high levels of
  AMBRA1-ActA at the mitochondria are able to induce massive mitophagy in both PARKIN-dependent
  and -independent context. It is likely that an E3 ubiquitin ligase is involved in
  mitochondria ubiquitylation following AMBRA1-ActA expression. Based on our knowledge
  of other mitophagy receptors, a kinase is probably involved in the post-translational
  regulation of AMBRA1 under mitochondrial stress. Finally, in cancer, an increase
  in BCL2 expression leads to inhibition of PARKIN-mediated mitophagy and, most likely,
  AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy.
