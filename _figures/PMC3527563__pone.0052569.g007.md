caption: Lines with arrow represent ‘activation’ and lines with no arrow represent
  ‘inhibition’. It has become clear from the past several years of research that an
  increased production of PICs in response to overactivated RAS within the cardiovascular
  regulatory centers of the brain (such as paraventricular nucleus) causes increased
  sympathetic outflow leading to increased arterial pressure and cardiac remodeling
  in experimental models of hypertension. At the cellular level, PICs activate reactive
  oxygen species which in turn can activate various intracellular signaling pathways,
  including that of NFκB. Activation of NFκB induces gene transcription of PICs fostering
  a positive feedback mechanism, and eventually leading to the progression of hypertension.
  A growing body of evidence suggests that the beneficial effects of exercise in hypertension
  could be attributed to reduced PICs, improved cellular redox homeostasis, and downregulation
  of NFκB activity. A step further, in the present study, we demonstrated that transient
  cessation of exercise (2 weeks of detraining) abolishes the exercise-induced improvements
  in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac function, anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) and
  oxidative stress in the PVN of hypertensive rats, although, positive effects in
  MAP and PICs remains unchanged. Further studies are still warranted to unravel the
  effects of exercise and detraining on other components of the AngII-induced signaling
  pathway such as downstream transcription factors and sympathetic activity.
