caption: 'RAF fusion genes in prostate and gastric cancer and melanoma. The RAF family
  of protein kinases are activated by RAS GTPases. In turn, RAF kinases activate the
  protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2 by serine phosphorylation at two sites within the
  activation segment of the kinase domain. MEK1 and MEK2 activate the ERK MAP kinases
  by phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in the activation segment
  of the kinase domain. Among the plethora of ERK1/2 MAP kinase targets are a number
  of ETS family transcription factors, which are also implicated in prostate carcinogenesis,
  as ETS genes are frequent targets of chromosome translocations,. Palanisamy et al.
  identified fusion transcripts resulting from chromosome translocations that lead
  to expression of three fusion genes: SLC45A3-BRAF or ESRP1-RAF2 in prostate cancer
  or type 1 angiotensin II receptor–associated protein (AGTRAP) BRAF in gastric cancer.
  The SCL45A3-BRAF fusion mRNA encodes a 329–amino acid protein that comprises only
  a C-terminal fragment of BRAF. By contrast, the ESRP1-RAF2 and AGTRAP-BRAF fusions
  encode proteins with substantial contribution of N-terminal sequences from the RAF
  fusion partner. The common feature of the proteins encoded by these fusion mRNAs
  is the presence of a RAF kinase domain that is likely to be constitutively activated.
  A large number of pharmacological inhibitors of the RAF→MEK→ERK MAP kinase pathway
  are being developed, a subset of which are listed in the figure.'
