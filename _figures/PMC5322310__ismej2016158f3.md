caption: 'Schematic of the proposed metabolic map of strain CF. The red crosses (X)
  represent missing genes in the strain CF genome, whereas a red curved dashed line
  beside a reaction represents the absence of the essential cofactor. The black arrows
  represent nutrients imported from medium. Note that the threonine–glycine conversion
  (highlighted in blue) is catalyzed by promiscuous SHMT. Abbreviations for cofactors
  and enzymes involved in the reactions are listed below with full name: CfrA, chloroform
  reductive dehalogenase; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; TDP, thiamine diphosphate; PK,
  pyruvate kinase; PPDK, pyruvate phosphate dikinase; FDH, formate dehydrogenase (molybdopterin);
  FHL, formate hydrogen lyase complex (molybdopterin); ACS, acetate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming);
  PFL, pyruvate formate-lyase; PFO, pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase (TDP); PCT,
  pyruvate carboxyl transferase (biotin); NDME, NADP-dependent malic enzyme (NADP);
  CS, citrate synthase; AH, aconitate hydratase; ICDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP);
  2-OGs, 2-oxoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (TDP); SCL, succinyl-CoA ligase;
  FH, fumarate hydratase; GK, glucokinase; PSP, phosphoserine phosphatase; OAD, oxaloacetate
  decarboxylase (biotin); SDH, succinate dehydrogenase(heme); SDHT, serine dehydratase;
  MDH, malate dehydrogenase; ICL, isocitrate lyase; MS, malate synthase; TAL, threonine
  aldolase (PLP); SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (PLP). Other abbreviations:
  CM, cytoplasmic membrane; CW, cell wall; Cyt b, cytochrome b; WL pathway, Wood–Ljungdahl
  pathway.'
