caption: Netrin-1 is expressed in the exocrine acini of normal pancreatic tissue,
  and this expression is impaired in early-stage PDAC. Netrin-1 inhibits PDAC tumorigenesis
  by interacting with the UNC5b receptor and stimulating FAK phosphorylation. Activated
  FAK induces the production of nitric oxide (NO) and promotes the expression, 3-nitrotyrosine
  modification and dephosphorylation of the protein phosphatase PP2A, leading to significantly
  enhanced PP2A activity. PP2A suppresses MEK/ERK/c-Jun signaling and down-regulates
  integrin β4 expression, facilitating the in vivo growth arrest of PDAC cells. Interestingly,
  in this study, that netrin-1 also mildly induced c-Raf phosphorylation, which could
  promote MEK/ERK signaling. Together, our data suggest that netrin-1 protects against
  PDAC and, at the same time, imply that netrin-1 intricately regulates PDAC progression
  in different cells and/or distinct stages of PDAC tumorigenesis.
