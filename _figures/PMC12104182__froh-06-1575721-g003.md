caption: Possible mechanisms by which periodontal pathogens may promote activation
  of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway during oral carcinogenesis. When the Wnt/β-catenin
  is “off”, β-catenin is targeted for proteasomal degradation by a complex composed
  by dishevelled segment polarity protein 1 (DVL1), AXIN, APC regulator of WNT signaling
  pathway (APC), casein kinase 1 alpha 1 (CSNK1A1/CK1α) and glycogen synthase kinase
  3 beta (GSK3B/GSK3β). To promote β-catenin degradation, CK1α and GSK3B phosphorylate
  β-catenin at S45 and S33/S37/T41, respectively. β-catenin is also found forming
  a complex with E-Cadherin at the cell membrane. To activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway, extracellular Wnt ligands bind to the Frizzled (FDZ) receptor and the LDL
  receptor related protein (LRP) 5/6 co-receptor. With this, the destruction complex
  is drawn from the cytoplasm and bound to the receptor at the cell membrane, leading
  to upregulation of β-catenin. Stable β-catenin translocates to the nucleus as a
  co-transcriptional factor of TCF/LEF genes. Possible mechanisms by which periodontal
  pathogens may activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway include increasing the levels of
  Wnt ligands at the extracellular medium, a gingipain-dependent proteolytic processing
  of β-catenin, and disrupting the β-catenin-E-cadherin complex at the cell membrane
