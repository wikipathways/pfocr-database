caption: Hypothetical illustration showing the development of endotoxin tolerance
  in a target cell mediated by miRNA packaged within the EVs. EVs carrying miRNAs
  (and other contents) are released from the original placental trophoblasts upon
  exposure to initial LPS dose as seen in . The released EVs travel to the target
  cells where they are selectively internalized by different mechanisms as shown.
  Microvesicles are internalized into the cytoplasm by fusing with the cell membrane
  while exosomes are internalized into vesicular bodies, lipid rafts on cell surface
  or by directly binding with specific cell surface receptors (). The target cell
  in this scenario can represent a distant cell (exposed to first dose of LPS) or
  the original trophoblast cell (exposed to a second dose of LPS). We hypothesize
  that the miRNAs within the EVs are released into the cytoplasm and enter the nucleus
  thereby negatively regulating the inflammatory pathway at multiple levels (including
  direct inhibition of TLR4, downregulating mRNA translation of TLR and negative feedback
  for NF-κB mediated TLR4 pathway). Upon exposure to a second dose of LPS, the original
  tolerized cell generates an attenuated inflammatory response (since it has high
  levels of anti-inflammatory miRNAs as a result form the first LPS exposure).
