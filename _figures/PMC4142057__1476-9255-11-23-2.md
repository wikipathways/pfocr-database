caption: 'NF-κB and p53 antagonises each others activity. Various mediators involved
  in the pathways are indicated. In addition, p53 and NF- κB can inhibit each other
  by direct physical interaction through their multimerization domain. Eventually,
  the effect of activation NF- κB pathway prevents the activation of p53 pathway and
  vice versa. The detail is described in the text. The black colored upward arrows
  adjacent to NF- κB and p53 indicate activation of these transcription factors. MDM2:
  mouse double mute 2; β-TrCP1: beta transducing repeat containing protein1; ARF:
  alternate reading frame of INK4/ARF locus; ATR: ATM-Rad3 related; CHK: check point
  kinase; I κB: inhibitior of kB; IKK: inhibitor of kappaB kinase.'
