caption: L. casei genes of amino acid metabolism and their role in L. casei establishment
  in the gut. (A) Metabolic pathway context. (B) Genetic environment. Genes needed
  for gut persistence are in red letters; genes not needed are in green letters; genes
  for which no mutant was found in the library (genes not tested) are in black letters.
