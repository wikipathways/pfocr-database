caption: A possible mechanism of action of glycyrrhizin (GL) in colon cancer. GL inhibits
  the binding of its target protein HMGB1 to the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) receptor
  and blocks the downstream MyD88-NEMO pathway. Subsequently, NF-κB nuclear translocation
  induces the pro-inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-α. GL also suppresses COX-2 expression.
  In addition, the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α lowers the
  expression of downstream DNA damage markers including 8-NitroG and 8-OxodG. IL-6-induced
  cancer stem cell markers, YAP1 and SOX9, are also inhibited by GL. Therefore, GL
  attenuates carcinogenesis by inhibiting inflammation in ulcerative colitis-colorectal
  cancer. Note—pathways are simplified and only key elements are shown.
