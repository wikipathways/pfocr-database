caption: Cartoon illustration of the activity of phytomelatonin and the PMTR1-mediated
  signaling pathways under different stress conditions. High salinity results in the
  inhibition of photosynthesis, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and
  the disruption of redox homeostasis, all of which were alleviated by phytomelatonin
  treatment. Under salt stress conditions, phytomelatonin is perceived by its PMTR1
  receptor, which induces the expression of genes encoding SOS, InsP3, InsP6, MPK3,
  and MPK6, as well as the expression of other transcription factors, leading to the
  release of Na+ and Ca2+ and enhancing the plant responses to salt stress. Under
  osmotic conditions, the plant stress signaling hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is accumulated
  and binds to its receptor PYR/PYL/RCAR, which may, in turn, activate SnRK2s. The
  activated SnRK2s regulates the expression of ABA-responsive genes through ABA-responsive
  element (ABRE) binding protein/ABRE binding factor (AREB/ABF) transcription factors.
  Phytomelatonin likely regulates plant adaptation to osmotic stress through interactions
  with PP2C by using PMTR1 to activate ABA-dependent signaling pathways. Phytomelatonin
  can also induce stomatal closure to prevent water loss and enhance plants’ tolerance
  to osmotic stress. Upon pathogen infection, the PMTR1-mediated activation of MKK4/5
  and the subsequent phosphorylation of MPK3/6 can result in the upregulation of genes
  encoding the salicylic acid (SA) pathway, which contribute to pathogen resistance.
  Phytomelatonin may also trigger the translocation of NPR1 from the cytosol to the
  nucleus, where it activates the expression of defense genes. Phytomelatonin can
  also mediate NADPH-dependent H2O2 production to close the stomata, thereby restricting
  pathogen infection. Upon darkness exposure, the expression of GWD, a gene responsible
  for starch degradation, and the accumulation of the GWD protein are induced, which
  promotes starch degradation. Phytomelatonin can inhibit leaf senescence by inducing
  the expression of miR170, which targets GWD for degradation. In dark conditions,
  the phytomelatonin signals can also be perceived by PMTR1 to initiate unknown downstream
  signaling to inhibit leaf senescence. PP2C can interact with and dephosphorylate
  PMTR1 to fine-tune phytomelatonin signaling. However, it can also interact with
  MeRAV1, MeRAV2, and MeWRKY20 to inhibit the transcriptional activation of MeRAV1/2
  and MeWRKY20 on the phytomelatonin biosynthetic genes.
