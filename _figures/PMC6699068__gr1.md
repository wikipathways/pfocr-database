caption: Notch signaling in bone tissue development. Notch signaling has dual effects
  on osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Notch signaling activation not only enhances
  osteogenic differentiation and the bone mineralization process, but also inhibits
  the osteogenesis by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Meanwhile, Notch signaling
  inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester
  (DAPT) can enhance the osteogenesis process. Furthermore, Notch activation in osteocytes
  can suppress bone resorption and increase bone volume by reducing sclerostin (Sost)
  and dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1 (Dkk1), as well as up-regulation
  of Wnt signaling. Notch1–3 deficiency directly promotes osteoclastic differentiation,
  and Notch1 deficiency can promote this process indirectly by decreasing the osteoprotegerin
  (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) ratio. The Notch1/Jagged1
  axis suppresses osteoclastogenesis, whereas the Notch2/Delta-like (Dll) 1 axis has
  the opposite effect. Notch activation has a negative effect of osteoclast formation
  by strongly inhibiting the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF).
