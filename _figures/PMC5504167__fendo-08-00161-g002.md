caption: '(A) Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) controls the placental “surveillance
  and response” system so that the fetus can detect threats to survival and adjust
  its developmental trajectory. The placenta employs an intricate network of sensors
  to decode signals from the maternal environment and prepare the fetus for postnatal
  survival. Disruption of these sensors might have detrimental effects on fetal neurodevelopment.
  The “CRH placental clock” might be part of this surveillance and response system:
  when stress signals such as cortisol from the maternal environment are detected
  by the fetal/placental unit, the “placental clock” may adapt by altering rate of
  synthesis of the “master” stress hormone, CRH. The rapid increase in circulating
  CRH might initiate mechanisms targeting maternal tissues to regulate myometrial
  contractile machinery and the onset of labor. In parallel, fetal developmental trajectories
  are adjusted to accelerate maturation of critical organs such as modification of
  its nervous system to ensure survival in a potentially hostile environment. (B)
  Maternal behaviors resulting in decreased hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis
  response to stress in adulthood are most likely driven by enhanced feedback sensitivity
  of CRH to glucocorticoids in the hippocampus. This involves epigenetic modifications
  of NR3C1, the gene encoding glucocorticoid receptors, in the brain increasing its
  mRNA expression via mechanisms that promote binding of the transcription factor
  nerve growth factor-inducible factor A (NGFI-A). This interaction involves a thyroid-hormone-dependent
  increase in serotonin (5-HT) activity at 5-HT7 receptors and the subsequent activation
  of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. Hippocampal
  CRH gene expression is also regulated by maternal care and early life stress through
  similar epigenetic mechanisms. Similarly, increased histone H3 acetylation and decreased
  cytosine methylation in the promoter region of CRH gene in hippocampal CA1 layer
  promote mRNA expression of the neuropeptide. One potential mechanism that enables
  positive environmental signals (induced by augmented maternal care) to influence
  transcription of the CRH gene in the offspring hypothalamus involves increased hypothalamic
  levels of the repressor neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF). NRSF represses
  the transcription of the CRH gene by binding in the regulatory region of the CRH
  gene, an epigenetic regulation that persists into adulthood.'
