caption: Comparison of global and selective inhibition interpretation models of pathogen-encoded
  protease mediated NF-κB interference. Under infection conditions, NF-κB activation
  results in p65 nuclear translocation and the transactivation of a wide array of
  target genes, a subset of which require the aid of known specifier proteins, such
  as RPS3 and Sam68. This leads to a coordinated cellular responses and clearance
  of infection (A). Pathogen-encoded proteases can have devastating, widespread effects
  (global, B) or they can inhibit specific aspects of a pathway. Complete cleavage
  of p65 interrupts the signal transduction cascade, preventing all downstream outcomes
  in a global fashion. However, partial proteolytic processing of p65 can result in
  selective inhibition (C), as there are still some full length and functioning p65
  molecules within the cell. In the experimentally verified (checked) examples of
  NleC-mediated cleavage of p65, during A/E pathogen infections, an N-terminal fragment
  is produced that sequesters RPS3, preventing the activation of that arm of the NF-κB
  signaling pathway. This inhibition thus results in the amplification of the effect
  of cleaving only a percentage of the p65 cellular pool. It is likely, yet remains
  to be verified experimentally (question marked), that a similar mechanism is employed
  by other pathogens. EPEC/EHEC/C. rodentium- NleC; Phdp- AIP56; C. trachomatis- CT441;
