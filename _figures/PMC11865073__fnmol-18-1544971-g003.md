caption: Neuroinflammation signaling pathway activity and member DEGs from mThy1-α-synuclein
  overexpression at 7 months. Identified DEGs at 7 months were submitted to Qiagen’s
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for core analysis and enrichment of canonical pathways.
  DEGs from our data involved in determining the enrichment of this pathway are demonstrated
  in the dot plot with significance levels based on a −log10(adjusted p-value), and
  the x-axis represents the observed log2 fold change. Measured DEGs within the pathway
  are outlined in purple and colored either red for up-regulated or green for down-regulated.
  IPA leverages observed changes to calculate a Z-score to predict activation (orange)
  or inhibition (blue) of multiple elements of the pathway. Yellow interactions represent
  inconsistent downstream measurements compared to the calculated prediction while
  any gray interactions could not be predicted
