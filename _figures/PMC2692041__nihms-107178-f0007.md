caption: Proposed mechanism of PAF-induced enterocyte apoptosis and its inhibition
  by PUFA. Survival signals maintain a baseline PI 3-kinase activity, resulting in
  Akt phosphorylation and a steady-state inhibitory effect on the mitochondrial death
  signaling. Activation of the palmitoylated PAF receptor (PAFR) relays a strong inhibitory
  signaling to PI 3-kinase, resulting in loss of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
  (PIP3), dephosphorylation of Akt, and activation of the mitochondrial death pathway.
  PUFA can interfere with this mechanism by inhibiting palmitoylation of the PAFR
  and other members of the receptor signal transduction complex (not shown for simplicity).
  The effect of PAFR activation is mimicked by direct inhibition of PI 3-kinase with
  LY-294002, but this effect cannot be counteracted by PUFA because palmitoylation
  is not involved in the signaling downstream of PI 3-kinase. Heterologous overexpression
  of Bcl-2 can limit both PAF-induced and PI 3-kinase-inhibition-induced apoptosis
  at the level of mitochondrial protection.
