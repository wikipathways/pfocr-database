caption: 'The forward and reverse transsulfuration pathway in yeast. Transsulfuration
  is the metabolic pathway that allows the interconversion of cysteine and methionine
  through the common intermediates homocysteine and cystathionine. In yeast, both
  forward and reverse routes are present, which enables the use of either cysteine
  or methionine as a sulfur source. The forward transsulfuration pathway (dotted grey
  arrows), which is also found in bacteria and plants, catalyzes the formation of
  methionine from cysteine, while the reverse transsulfuration pathway of mammals
  (thick black arrows) leads to the formation of cysteine from methionine. Unlike
  human and other mammalian CBS enzymes, yeast CBS is haem-independent and its activity
  is not regulated by S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet). Abbreviations: CBS, cystathionine
  β-synthase; CBL, cystathionine β-lyase; CGL, cystathionine γ-lyase; CGS, cystathionine
  γ-synthase.'
