caption: 'Schematic representation of the anti-MIRI effect of PE. PE suppress the
  inflammation by inhibiting the TLR4-NF/κB and JNK- NF/κB signaling pathways, inhibit
  mitochondrial oxidative stress by activating the SIRT1 pathway, and promoted the
  activity of the mitochondrial complex by inhibiting the RohA pathway. In addition,
  PE attenuated calcium overload via STIM1-mediated SOCE. Notably, PE not only maintained
  mitochondrial homeostasis through interaction with estrogen receptors, but also
  promoted NO production, which effectively exerted cardioprotective effects. TLR4:
  toll-like receptor four; JNK: JunNterminal kinase; NF/κB: nuclear factor-κ-gene
  binding; SIRT1: silent information regulator 1; FOXO1: forkhead box O; PGC-1α: proliferator-activated
  receptor-γ coactlvator-1α; ROS: reactive oxygen species; ROCK: RhoA/Rho-associated
  coiled-coil containing protein kinase; PKCε: protein kinase C; STIM1: stromal interacting
  molecule 1; SOCC: store-operated calcium channels; ER: estrogen receptor; NOS: nitric
  oxide synthase; USP19: ubiquity specific peptidase 19.'
