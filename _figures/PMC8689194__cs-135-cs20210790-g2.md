caption: In healthy patients, the gut epithelia form a barrier, connected by tight
  junction proteins including claudins, occludins and ZO-1, to prevent molecules in
  the gut lumen from crossing into the blood. However, in diseases including asthma
  and obesity, tight junctions can become weak, allowing molecules of endotoxin (LPS)
  to cross into the circulatory system, which can cause an immune response and inflammation.
  This can occur through several mechanisms; firstly, LPS can bind to TLR-4, which
  activates the NF-κB signalling pathway and increases the expression of inflammatory
  cytokines. Secondly, when LPS binds to TLR-4 it can also lead to a signalling cascade
  that decreases the expression of tight junction proteins, weakening the gut barrier
  and allowing more LPS to cross. Finally, LPS can be transported into gut cells by
  chylomicrons, which usually transport fat to the liver and adipose tissues. LPS
  is taken up by the chylomicrons, they enter the cell and are packaged by the Golgi
  apparatus, before exiting the cells and into the circulatory system via vesicles.
