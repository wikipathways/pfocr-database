caption: '(A) Ferulic acid degradation pathway: a coenzyme A is added to ferulic acid
  by Atu1416, a feruloyl-CoA synthase. Feruloyl-CoA is then converted by Atu1417,
  an enoyl-CoA hydratase, into 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl-β-hydroxypropionyl (HMPHP)-CoA,
  which is in turn transformed into vanillic acid by Atu1415, a phenylhydroxypropionyl-CoA
  dehydrogenase, and then Atu1421, a 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl-β-ketopropionyl-CoA
  (HMPKP)-CoA β-keto-thiolase. The O-demethylase Atu1420 degrades vanillic acid into
  protocatechuic acid using tetrahydrofolate (H4F) as a cofactor and produces N5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate
  (MH4F). Protocatechuic acid enters the cycle of Krebs. Atu1418 enzyme was proposed
  to be involved in the recycling of H4F from transformation of MH4F into MEF, a compound
  that can be enzymatically or spontaneously converted to H4F (,). Dashed arrows indicated
  putative reactions based on sequence similarities and references (,,,). (B) Organization
  of the SpG8–1b region for which genes expression is regulated by the two transcriptional
  factors HcaR and Atu1419 (their genes are framed in red). Promoters are shown with
  small arrows in black for HcaR dependent-transcription and in blue for putative
  Atu1419 dependent-transcription indicating the direction of gene transcription.'
