caption: 'Canonical TGFβ pathway. The first step in TGFβ canonical pathway is an interaction
  of the dimeric TGFβ ligand with a tetrameric receptor complex consisting of two
  pairs of TGFβRIs and TGFβRIIs. The activated dimer of TGFβRIIs due to its constitutive
  kinase activity phosphorylates TGFβRIs. The ligand-induced activation of TGFβRIIs
  with following phosphorylation of TGFβRIs results in release from TGFβRI an inhibitory
  FKBP12 protein, what promotes the activation of TGFβRI kinase domains. The signal
  propagation occurs when activated TGFβRs tetramer phosphorylates cytoplasmic Smad2/3
  proteins complex. The SARA protein stabilizes the interaction of Smad2/3 complex
  with TGFβRIs. An activated Smad2/3 complex translocates to the nucleus, and together
  with Smad4 and other transcription factors and/or cofactors, activate an expression
  of TGFβ responsive genes. Smad7 antagonizes TGFβ induced signaling by an association
  with the activated TGFβRI receptor, thus blocking an interaction, activation, and
  phosphorylation of Smad2 effectors. Smad7 can also disrupt the Smad-DNA complex
  formation in the nucleus, thereby altering cell responsiveness to TGFβ at the transcriptomic
  level. FKBP12: immunophilin 12-kD FK506 binding protein; SARA: Smad anchor for receptor
  activation.'
