caption: 'The hedgehog signaling pathway was visualized with regard to genes regulated
  by T3 based on RNA-Seq and/or bound by TR based on ChIP-Seq. The arrows show functional
  interaction: green for activation; red for inhibition. Letters in red indicate upregulated
  genes in wild-type intestine after T3 treatment. Letters in black indicate genes
  with no change in wild-type intestine after T3 treatment. Red boxes indicate ChIP-Seq
  detected genes both with and without T3 treatment, and purple boxes indicate genes
  identified by ChIP-Seq only in wild type with T3 treatment. Note that many genes
  including Sonic hedgehog (Hh) were upregulated by T3 and also bound by TR. No downregulated
  genes were found by RNA-Seq in this pathway.'
