caption: 'Graphical summary for pathways regulated after celastrol treatment. The
  topmost five regulated canonical pathways post-celastrol treatment were cyclins
  and cell cycle regulation, senescence pathway, cell cycle control and chromosomal
  regulation, cell cycle: G1/S checkpoint regulation, apoptosis of embryonic cell
  lines, estrogen-mediated S-phase entry and prostatic cancer signaling. An asterisk
  (*) indicates that a given gene is represented in the microarray set with multiple
  probes.'
