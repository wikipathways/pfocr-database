caption: 'Model for EBV related chemoresistance.Notes: EBV activates the ATR-mediated
  DDR pathway, which is characterized by enhanced phosphorylation of the pathway proteins
  RPA32, CHK1, and H2AX. During CDDP- or 5-FU-induced DDR in EBV-positive CNE1, ATRi
  leads to enhanced p53 phosphorylation, resulting in S-phase arrest and initiation
  of a p53-mediated apoptosis pathway. Meanwhile, ATRi also impairs Rad51 formation,
  leading to ineffective HR repair.Abbreviations: 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; ATM, ataxia
  telangiectasia mutation; ATR, ATM and Rad-3 related; ATRi, ATR interference; CDDP,
  cisplatin; DDR, DNA damage response; EBV, Epstein–Barr virus; HR, homologous recombination.'
