caption: Signaling pathways controlling ENS precursor migration and lamellipodia formation.
  (A) This simplified pathway shows that Ret activation by GDNF causes Pik3 activation,
  generating PIP3 and activating Cdc42 and Rac1 as part of a positive-feedback loop
  at the leading edge of migrating cells. Rac1 is crucial for lamellipodia formation.
  Pten reverses Pik3 activity and stops the positive-feedback loop. RA signaling reduces
  Pten protein abundance in the most actively migrating ENS precursors in vitro and
  at the leading edge of the wavefront of Ret+ cells organ culture. (B) A model of
  how cells polarize in response to chemoattractants. In the absence of chemoattractant,
  signaling proteins might be distributed throughout the cell. In actively migrating
  cells, Cdc42, Rac1, PIP3 and Pik3 accumulate at the front edge of the cell, inducing
  cytoskeletal changes and lamellipodia formation. Pten, Rho and Rho kinase (Rock)
  become restricted to the trailing edge of the cell. High levels of Pten in ENS precursors
  deprived of Rar signaling disrupts the positive-feedback loop and causes loss of
  the cell polarity needed for migration.
