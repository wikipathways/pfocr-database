caption: Model for regulation of CPE production. This updated model for CPE regulation
  integrates result regarding the roles of the master regulator of sporulation Spo0A
  [], the sporulation-specific sigma factors [,], and the Agr-like quorum sensing
  system [] in the regulation of CPE production. Note that the precise mechanisms
  of regulation of CPE production by Spo0A and the Agr system remain unknown and thus
  indirect interactions are depicted with broken arrows or arrows and question marks.
  All regulatory factors shown are required for sporulation and all but SigG are also
  required for CPE production. CcpA (not shown) also controls CPE production and sporulation
  through an unknown pathway []. Adapted from [].
