caption: Comparative metabolic pathway analysis between the 18°C and 33°C groups.
  Analysis of the metabolic profiles resulting from tilapias cultured at 18°C and
  33°C provides a better insight into the effect of 97 differential abundances of
  metabolites (p < 0.01). Based on the KEGG compound (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/compound/),
  metabolic network pathways in tilapias are further analyzed with iPath2.0 (http://pathways.embl.de/iPath2.cgi).
  Red line represents increase in the 33°C group; blue line represents decrease in
  the 33°C group.
