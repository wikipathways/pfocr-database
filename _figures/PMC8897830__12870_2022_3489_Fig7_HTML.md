caption: 'Schematic representation of (a) overall putative differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) and modulated pathways in response to alkalinity stress, b) Detailed
  description of DEGs related to ABA pathways which were induced due to alkalinity
  stress. PUB44: Promotes the degradation of AAO3 and thus represses abscisic acid
  (ABA) biosynthesis; XERICO: Function on ABA homeostasis at post-translational level,
  probably through ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent substrate-specific degradation; AHK3: Redundant
  negative regulator of ABA signalling; ABC25G: High affinity ABA transporter that
  mediates export of ABA, with a preference for ( +)-ABA, through the plasma membrane,
  especially in vascular tissues (e.g. phloem companion cells), and is involved in
  the intercellular ABA signalling pathway; PTR19: Mediates cellular ABA uptake; DHN1: Induced
  by ABA; LST8: Involved in plant growth; RGLG5: Mediates ubiquitination and subsequent
  proteasomal degradation of the target protein PP2CA, a major inhibitor of ABA signalling; WRKY24: Negative
  regulator of ABA signalling via specific repression of ABA-induced promoters; NAC2:
  Transcription factor that activates the expression of senescence and ABA associated
  genes including NCED1, ABCG40, CYP707A2, SAG113, SGR1 and PAO, by directly binding
  to their promoters; JA2: Regulates the expression of NCED1, and required for the
  stomatal closure. Both the images are created with BioRender.com'
