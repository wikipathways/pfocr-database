caption: Rigosertib is a multi-kinase inhibitor that can influence signaling of multiple
  pathways important for cellular proliferation and survival. Rigosertib inhibits
  both Plk-1 and PI3K. This could explain rigosertib’s influence on AKT activity,
  thereby regulating protein synthesis, cell survival, proliferation and metabolism.
  Rigosertib is also likely to influence the activity of other gene products.
