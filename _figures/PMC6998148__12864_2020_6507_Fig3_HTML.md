caption: The simplified pathway of starch metabolism. The numbers in the rectangles
  are enzyme codes, all the enzymes are identified in the transcriptome, the arrows
  show the direction of enzyme-catalyzed reaction; enzymes up-regulated on 0.5-h of
  stress are highlighted by light orange; enzymes up-regulated on 1-h of stress are
  highlighted by orange, enzymes up-regulated on 0.5-h of stress were also up-regulated
  on 1-h of stress; enzymes up-regulated on 2-h of stress are highlighted by red,
  enzymes up-regulated on 0.5-h and 1-h of stress were also up-regulated on 2-h of
  stress
