caption: 'Proposal of the main molecular signaling pathways by which celecoxib exerts
  its anti-inflammatory action as a promising strategy in breast cancer therapy. By
  stimulating a wide range of immunosuppressive cells, the COX-2/PGE2 pathway promotes
  the sustainment of an immunosuppressive TME. The figure illustrates precisely how
  COX-2/PGE2 hyperactivity is involved in establishing an immunosuppressive TME, as
  evidenced by the signaling interplay between different cell types in the tumor landscape.
  Although celecoxib is well regarded for its ability to selectively inhibit COX-2,
  a key enzyme in the inflammatory mechanism, it has also attracted interest for its
  cancer-fighting properties, especially concerning cancer pathophysiology and metastasis.
  As a major mediator of the TME, PGE2 is reduced by celecoxib, which in turn plays
  a crucial role in controlling tumor biology. Celecoxib directly affects angiogenesis,
  essential for tumor growth, by inducing a reduction in PGE2 levels. Used alone or
  in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, selective inhibitors of COX-2
  signaling such as celecoxib can be an effective partner in the fight against breast
  cancer. Abbreviations: PGE2, prostaglandin E2; COX, cyclooxygenase; MDSC, myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells; PD-1, programmed death-1; NK, natural killer; CD, cluster of differentiation;
  MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; DCs, dendritic cells; NSAIDs, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
