caption: Apoptosis signaling under ER stress conditions. Prolonged or severe ER stress,
  as well as dysfunction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), induces apoptosis
  signaling, primarily through the IRE1 and PERK pathways. In the IRE1 pathway, activated
  IRE1 recruits TRAF2 and ASK1 on the ER membrane and activates the ASK1-dependent
  apoptosis pathway. In addition, the IKK-NFκB pathway is also activated by IRE1-TRAF2
  and induces an apoptotic response. Proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bax and Bak,
  interact with IRE1 and promote its RNase/kinase activity. Moreover, IRE1 induces
  ER-localized mRNA degradation. In the PERK pathway, ATF4 induced by the PERK-eIF2α
  pathway upregulates the expression of CHOP, which in turn activates the transcription
  of GADD34, ER oxidoreductase 1 (ERO1), and many proapoptotic factors. GADD34 then
  promotes dephosphorylation of eIF2α with PP1, canceling translational attenuation,
  and leads to an increase of protein loads into the ER. Furthermore, the translational
  attenuation of global proteins by the PERK-eIF2α pathway also applies to IκB, which
  has been terminally linked to the activation of NFκB.
