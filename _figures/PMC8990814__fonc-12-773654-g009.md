caption: Working model of the mechanism by which TRPV1 regulates chemoresistance in
  A549 cells. In sensitive NSCLC cells, DDP or 5-FU induces DNA damage, resulting
  in cell death. In DDP/5-FU sensitive cells with TRPV1 overexpression and in DDP/5-FU
  resistant cells, high levels of TRPV1 increase ABCA5 drug transporter expression
  resulting in increased drug efflux, enhances HR DNA repair efficiency subsequently
  leading to cell apoptosis inhibition, activates the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and
  increases IL-8 secretion to promote cell survival. Through the above three ways,
  TRPV1 finally induces chemoresistance. In addition, partial of IL-8 induces chemoresistance
  via CXCR1/2 receptors.
