caption: A. Double-strand DNA (dsDNA) breaks activate ATM leading to CHK2 phosphorylation.
  CHK2 subsequently activates p53 and promotes G1/S phase checkpoint blockade. Replicative
  stress, through the accumulation of single strand DNA, activates ATR. ATR phosphorylates
  CHK1 leading to activation of p53 and WEE1 as well as the inhibition of CDC25C,
  which ultimately causes S phase prolongation and G2/M checkpoint blockade. B. When
  there is ATM deficiency, replicative stress increases leading to compensatory activation
  of the ATR signaling pathway. C. Lack of signaling through both the ATR and ATM
  pathways prevents DNA repair and leads ultimately to cancer cell death from genomic
  catastrophe.
