caption: miR-351 abolished ITGB3 expression and the PI3K/Akt pathway in high-fat diet-induced
  atherosclerosis in T2DM mice. In the high-fat diet-induced atherosclerotic T2DM
  mouse model, miR-351 was upregulated due to the influence of diabetes combined with
  a high-fat diet, while atherosclerosis was alleviated in the miR-351 KO mouse model.
  The reason is related to the inhibition of ITGB3 expression by miR-351. Downregulated
  ITGB3 cannot stimulate the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, resulting in decreased
  cell resistance to oxidative stress and survival. After miR-351 is eliminated, ITGB3's
  ability to stimulate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is restored, and endothelial
  cells can resist antioxidative stress and apoptosis and enhance cell survival
