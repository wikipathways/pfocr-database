caption: Anticancer properties of glycyrrhizinic acid in cervical cancer models. Gly
  inhibits the Notch signalling pathway, leading to reduced expression of Clicin D1,
  HES1, Bcl2, C-MYC, etc., and to an increase in the expression of Bad, Bax, p21,
  etc. As a result, Gly prevents the proliferation of cervical cancer cells, induces
  their apoptosis, and prevents epithelial–mesenchymal transition and cell migration.
  The proapototic action of Gly is mediated by both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.
  Gly also reduces the levels of the viral oncoproteins HPV-E6/E7, leading to an increase
  in p53. On the other hand, Gly directly inactivates HMGB1, thus preventing the increase
  in Treg cells and a decrease in pDCs in the tumour microenvironment, preventing
  evasion to the control of the immune system
