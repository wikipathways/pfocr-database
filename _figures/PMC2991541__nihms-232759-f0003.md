caption: Our data suggests that age associated MMP-1 expression is redox-sensitive.
  The redox-dependence is initially due to the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  pathway. Previous results have also shown that the activation of JNK pathway involves
  activation of upstream MAPKK, MKK-4 and MKK-7. Our lab has shown that MKK-4 is similarly
  regulated in an age- and redox-dependent manner. Furthermore, with age there is
  decrease in total levels of MKP-1 which may implicate a process of “oxidative inactivation”.
  Use of kinase specific pharmacological and molecular inhibitor indicate that other
  MAP kinases such as Erk, p38 and PI-3-Kinase may also participate in oxidant-dependent
  regulation of MMP-1 transcription. To conclude, JNK is one of the key mediators
  of redox dependent MMP-1 induction and the senescence-dependent MMP-1 induction
  is a complex signaling process dependent on ROS regulating a number of distinct
  signaling networks that converge to drive MMP-1 expression. Dashed lines indicate
  sites of redox regulation.
