caption: HIV infection of brain capillary pericytes triggers a biphasic metabolic
  response. The first stage involves depletion in occludin by a pathway that involves
  p38-MAPK activity. Occludin depletion leads to decreased NAD+ generation and increased
  NADH availability. Increased NADH results in enhanced nuclear translocation of CtBP1,
  which induces decreased SIRT-1 expression. In addition, diminished NAD+ availability
  decreases SIRT-1 phosphorylation and activation. In these conditions, levels of
  acetylated (i.e., transcriptionally active) NFκB-p65 are elevated, enhancing HIV
  replication. Pericytes escape from this pathway by increasing occludin expression
  in a manner that requires ROCK activity, shifting the infectious cycle to a second
  stage characterized by occludin recovery with subsequent reduction in NADH and nuclear
  CtBP1 translocation, normalized SIRT-1 expression, and increased SIRT-1 activation,
  resulting from elevated NAD+ availability. Increased SIRT-1 deacetylates active
  NFκB, hindering efficient HIV replication.
