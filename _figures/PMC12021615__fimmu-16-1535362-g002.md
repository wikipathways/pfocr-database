caption: The role of E3s and DUBs in SIRT, TGF-β, JAK, TLR4 and STING signaling pathway
  in NAFLD. (1) ATGL stimulates the autophagy signaling pathway via SIRT1, promotes
  fatty acid beta oxidation, and decreases liver steatosis. E3 ubiquitin ligase RFWD2
  targets ATGL proteasome degradation, while E3 ubiquitin ligase Grail targets SIRT1
  proteasome degradation, which increases FA and hepatic lipid accumulation. The deubiquitinase
  USP22 can deubiquitinate SIRT1, stabilize SIRT1, and have anti-NAFLD actions. USP10,
  a deubiquitinase, can prevent NAFLD by stabilizing SIRT6 and blocking downstream
  signaling pathways such as NF-κB and SREBP. (2) TrkB can suppress the TGF-β/Smad
  signaling pathway, alleviating NASH-related liver fibrosis. Ndfip1 can ubiquitinate
  and degrade TrkB via the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4L, aggravating NASH-associated
  liver fibrosis. (3) The activation of JAK2/STAT5/PPAR gamma axis increases hepatic
  lipid accumulation. ARID2 can impede downstream signal transduction by ubiquitinating
  and degrading JAK2 via the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4L. (4) TLR4 can activate the
  MVB lysosome signaling pathway, causing inflammation, insulin resistance, and glucose
  metabolism disorders, aggravating NASH. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4L activates
  Tmbim1 via ubiquitination, boosting lysosomal degradation of TLR4 and improving
  NASH. (5) The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF13 catalyzes TRIM29, increasing its stability.
  Ubiquitinated TRIM29 causes STING to be degraded by proteasomes, which inhibits
  hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation
