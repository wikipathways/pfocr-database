caption: IGF-I-induced activation of PI 3-kinase/AKT and MAPK pathways in  VSMCs.
  VSMCs maintained in HG conditions upon IGF-I stimulation show  enhanced activation
  of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways leading to increased  proliferation and migration
  compared with cells grown in NG. IGF-I-stimulated  Shc mediates activation of MAPK
  via Grb2-Sos binding. In HG conditions  Shc-mediated, Grb2-associated p85 recruitment
  to SHPS-1 activates the PI3K/AKT  pathway increasing VSMC proliferation and migration
  in response to IGF-I  stimulation.
