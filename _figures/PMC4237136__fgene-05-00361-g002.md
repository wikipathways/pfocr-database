caption: Proposed mechanism for miR-155-mediated myeloid leukemogenesis. Overexpression
  of miR-155 leads to the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway through negative regulation
  of Src Homology 2 domain-containing Inositol-5-Phosphatase (SHIP1). SHIP1 is a phosphatase
  that mediates the conversion of phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol
  diphosphate (PIP2). PIP3 normally acts as a docking site for signaling molecules
  in the PI3K-Akt pathway and helps relay the signal. Upon miR-155 overexpression
  and thus, SHIP1 downregulation, PIP3 level is increased, which leads to the activation
  of the PI3K-Akt pathway. Green arrows indicate increased, and red arrows decreased
  activity upon miR-155 overexpression.
