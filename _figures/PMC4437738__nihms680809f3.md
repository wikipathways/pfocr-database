caption: A) The transcriptional activators VpsR, VpsT and transcriptional repressors
  HapR and H-NS directly and indirectly regulate several genes that have key roles
  in biofilm formation. Positive regulators of biofilm are shown in orange, while
  negative regulators are shown in purple. These include the vps (vibrio polysaccharide)
  cluster and the rbm (rugosity and biofilm structure modulator) cluster, which contain
  genes that encode proteins involved in VPS production and matrix proteins. The vps
  and rbm clusters comprise a functional genetic module, the V. cholerae biofilm-matrix
  cluster (VcBMC). In addition, the bap1 (biofilm-associated extracellular matrix
  protein) gene has also been shown to be regulated by these core regulators. The
  recognition sequences for VpsR, VpsT, HapR and H-NS have been identified in the
  regulatory region of vps-1 and vps-2 clusters and the genes encoding the extracellular
  matrix proteins RbmA and RbmC. Binding of VpsT to promoter regions requires its
  interaction with c-di-GMP. As shown, the VpsR and VpsT targets extensively overlap,
  though some biofilm genes appear to be only directly regulated by one. Additionally,
  the negative regulators directly downregulate many of the genes encoding proteins
  involved in VPS production and matrix proteins, as well as the genes that encode
  the positive transcriptional regulators of those genes (shown in part b).B) An extensive
  regulatory network governs V. cholerae biofilm formation. VpsR, VpsT and AphA are
  the main activators of biofilm formation, and HapR and H-NS are the main repressors
  (shown in the core the dashed box). VpsR, VpsT, HapR and H-NS directly regulate
  genes involved in biofilm formation (see part a).These core regulators directly
  and indirectly regulate each other and are modulated by a complex regulatory network
  in response to a number of environmental and host signals. The quorum sensing (QS)
  pathway, which responds to cell density via bacterial signaling, has a key role
  in the regulation of HapR and, thus, the other major biofilm regulators. The signaling
  molecules autoinducer 2 (AI-2) and cholerae autoinducer 1 (CAI-1) regulate a phosphorelay
  event that culminates at the histidine phosphotransfer protein, LuxU, and the response
  regulator, LuxO. Together with the alternative sigma factor RpoN, LuxO activates
  transcription of the quorum-regulated small RNAs (sRNAs), Qrr1–4, which work in
  conjunction with the sRNA chaperone Hfq to prevent the translation of hapR.HapR
  production is repressed at low cell density, when CAI-1 and AI-2 production is not
  high, shown by dashed arrows, leading to LuxO phosphorylation by the QS signal transduction
  pathway. The VarS-VarA system responds to an unknown environmental cue and represses
  biofilm production by post-transcriptionally upregulating HapR. This process involves
  the regulatory sRNAs CsrB, CsrC, and CsrD, which bind to and titrate the RNA-binding
  protein CsrA, thereby interfering with LuxO-mediated activation of Qrr1-4. This
  leads to decreased levels of Qrr1-4 and enhanced HapR production. By contrast, the
  small protein Fis is a direct positive regulator of the QS-responsive sRNAs, Qrr1-4
  thereby promoting HapR repression. The histidine kinase VpsS, donates phosphate
  groups to LuxU, thus promoting HapR repression. The integration of many regulatory
  pathways enables the induction or repression of V. cholerae biofilm formation in
  response to a number of extracellular and intracellular signals.Small-nucleotide
  molecules, including cyclic-AMP (cAMP), (p)ppGpp, and cyclic-di-GMP regulate the
  induction and repression of major regulators, including HapR, VpsT and VpsR. The
  sigma factor RpoS promotes expression of hapR. Of note, RpoS is depicted with (p)ppGpp
  because the stringent response regulation of vpsT and vpsR has been shown to partially
  occur through RpoS. A key signaling molecule controlling V. cholerae motility and
  biofilm matrix production is the second messenger c-di-GMP. High cellular levels
  of c-di-GMP promote enhanced transcription of genes involved in biofilm formation,
  possibly by promoting VpsT-mediated transcriptional expression of vps genes. Several
  diguanylate cyclases (DGCs), which cumulatively contribute to c-di-GMP levels, and
  phosphodiesterases (PDEs), known to degrade cellular c-di-GMP to pGpG or GMP, are
  shown.The second messenger cyclic adenosine-monophosphate (cAMP) is involved various
  cellular responses and acts as a repressor of V. cholerae biofilm formation. cAMP
  in complex with cAMP receptor protein (CRP), has been shown to upregulate HapR production
  through its positive regulation of the CAI-I autoinducer synthase and its negative
  regulation of Fis. Finally, the sigma factor RpoS promotes expression of hapR.

    of vpsT and vpsR has been shown to partially occur through RpoS. A key signaling
    molecule controlling V. cholerae motility and biofilm matrix production is the
