caption: Major therapeutic strategies targeting cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs).
  The schematic diagram illustrates several strategies for targeting CAFs that have
  been tested in preclinical studies and clinical trials. These include the elimination
  of CAFs (e.g., FAP‐targeted CAR‐T, bispecific antibodies as T cell engagers, and
  anti‐FAP/LRRC ADC) and reprogramming of CAFs (e.g., reduction of ECM components
  by suppression of TGF‐β signaling, pathway‐specific inhibition such as IL‐1 and
  RTKs, and phenotypic conversion to tumor‐suppressive CAFs). ADC, antibody–drug conjugate;
  CAR, chimeric antigen receptor; FAP, fibroblast activation protein; LRRC15, leucine‐rich‐repeat‐containing
  protein 15. Created with BioRENDER.com
