caption: Hepcidin-mediated accumulation of iron in AD brains. Accumulation of intracellular
  oligomeric soluble Aβ and p-tau and extracellular amyloid plaques (1) activates
  microglia, triggering the release of IL-6 (2). This leads to glial cell activation
  (3) and the release of additional IL-6 (4). IL-6 binds to its receptors on neurons
  (5), activating the JAK/STAT pathway (6) [, , , ] and transcriptional activation
  of hepcidin (7). Increased synthesis and secretion of hepcidin (8) results in downregulation
  of Fpn (9), accumulation of iron, and upregulation of ferritin (10) []. IL-6-mediated
  upregulation of hepcidin occurs in glial cells as well and is not limited to neurons
  as depicted here.
