caption: Based on WGCNA, we explored the correlations among gene modules and all possible
  variables, with particular interest in those related to age. We identified 33 modules,
  including two gene modules (blue and royal-blue) significantly related to age ().
  The positive age-related blue module (R2=0.64, P=0.0008) contained 1 375 core genes,
  906 of which were age-related DEGs. These core genes were also significantly enriched
  in the FoxO signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling pathway, platelet activation,
  and innate immunity (Supplementary Table S3). Multiple genes showed very strong
  connections (weight>0.42) to FOXO3 and FOXO4 by WGCNA (Supplementary Figure S4).
  The royal-blue module contained 384 genes that were negatively associated (R2=–0.58,
  P=0.003) with advancing age, including 144 DEGs related to age. The genes in the
  royal-blue module were mainly related to ribosome (KEGG:03010) and spliceosome (KEGG:03040)
  (Supplementary Table S4).
