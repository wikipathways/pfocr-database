caption: Metabolic reprogramming in fibrogenic HSCs activation in chronic liver diseases.
  A, HSCs are activated by exosomes containing GLUT1 and PKM2. The overexpression
  of glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT2, and GLUT4 facilitates excessive glucose uptake
  by HSCs, leading to increased glycolysis. Pyruvate, a byproduct of PKM2-catalyzed
  glycolysis, is largely diverted toward lactate synthesis, resulting in lactate accumulation
  within HSCs, despite the increased expression of the lactate transporter monocarboxylate
  transporter 4 (MCT4) and enhanced lactate efflux. In a separate metabolic pathway,
  pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, which enhances the activity of the TCA cycle
  and releases lipids that are stored for β-oxidation. PKM2 regulates the expression
  of metabolic genes, which elevates ROS production and overall mitochondrial activity.
  Additionally, glutamine enters the cell via the ASCT1 and is metabolized to produce
  glutamate and α-ketoglutarate, which are subsequently integrated into the TCA cycle.
  Hedgehog signaling through leptin represents a significant pro-fibrotic signal that
  may reprogram glucose metabolism, primarily converging on the transcription factor
  HIF-1α. Since AGEs result from hyperglycemia, TGF-β signaling enhances HSC expression
  of RAGE, rendering activated HSCs more susceptible to global glucose metabolism.
  B, The lipid metabolism of activated HSCs is characterized by the loss of retinyl
  ester-containing cytoplasmic droplets. HSCs utilize enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation
  to degrade the contents of lipid droplets within the autolysosome. Lipid droplets
  are transported to the autolysosome, where they undergo degradation. The contents
  of lipid droplets are degraded in the autolysosome under LAL activity, and REH activity
  is also increased in the lysosome, releasing free retinol into the extracellular
  space. SREBP-1c and PPAR-γ are adipogenic markers of quiescent HSCs that are downregulated
  upon activation. The conversion of some intracellular retinol to retinoic acid facilitates
  elevated transcription of RARβ and RXRβ. C, Free cholesterol in activated HSCs is
  partially absorbed through PCSK9, which interacts with low-density LRP5 and LDLR,
  promoting the degradation of endosomes and lysosomes. Free cholesterol enhances
  the expression of TLR4 and is converted into cholesterol esters through ACAT1, sensitizing
  HSCs to TGF-β signaling. oxLDL increases the expression of profibrogenic genes such
  as TNF-α and IL-1β through the pJNK. D, Metabolic stress responses in HSCs lead
  to the conversion of latent TGF-β into activated TGF-β. Unfolded proteins and TGF-β
  signaling trigger ER stress responses via IRE1α, resulting in increased expression
  of fibrogenic genes through ASK1/JNK signaling and the canonical splicing of XBP1
  into its active form. This process promotes the expression of C/EBPβ, COL1A1, TGF-β,
  and XBP1 in the cell nucleus, leading to increased collagen accumulation. TGF-β
  signaling activates NADPH oxidase in a self-replicating cycle, producing H2O2, which
  promotes fibrogenic gene expression and activates latent TGF-β in extracellular
  spaces. Reduced nuclear receptor signaling, such as that of LXR, FXR, or THRα, is
  a hallmark of HSC activation. Nevertheless, active HSCs also exhibit increased PPARβ/δ,
  which stimulates HSC proliferation. ACAT1, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase
