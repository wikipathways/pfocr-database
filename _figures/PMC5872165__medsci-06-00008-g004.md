caption: Mechanisms for reduced capsule synthesis in lysine decarboxylase deficient
  pneumococci. Deletion of lysine decarboxylase in pneumococci results in reduced
  capsule compared to wild type TIGR4 strain. Reduced capsule synthesis could be due
  to the reduced expression (shown in red) of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis
  gene cps4A, the first gene in the cps locus in S. pneumoniae TIGR4 (A). The first
  four genes from the cps locus adjacent to the gene dexB that are conserved in all
  pneumococcal serotypes are shown. Our proteomics data indicates a shift in central
  metabolism (B) from glycolysis (yellow box) to the non-oxidative branch of pentose
  phosphate pathway (green box), due to increased expression (shown in blue) of transketolase
  (Tkt,). Reactions that involve multiple steps are represented by a broken line.
  Reduced expression of GlmU involved in the synthesis and increased expression of
  NagB involved in the degradation of UDP-GlcNAc could result in reduced concentration
  of UDP-GlcNAc. UDP-GlcNAc is a precursor for UDP-ManNAc, an acetylated sugar that
  is the constituent of the 4-sugar repeat unit of capsular polysaccharide in capsular
  serotype 4 (open oval). The net effect of these changes in pneumococcal gene and
  protein expression could result in the observed reduction in capsule biosynthesis
  in ΔcadA.
