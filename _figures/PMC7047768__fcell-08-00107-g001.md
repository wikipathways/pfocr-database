caption: Summary of transcriptional regulation of senescence in MSCs. In response
  to different stresses (oncogene, telomere attrition, oxydative stress, inflammation
  or mitochondrial dysfunction), DNA damage response (DDR) is induced in healthy MSCs
  leading to the activation of the two main signaling pathways p19ARF and p16INK4A.
  Activation of p19ARF results in p53 and p21 activation, which inhibits CDK2 and
  induces senescence. Activation of the p16INK4A-pRB pathway leads to cell cycle arrest
  and triggers senescence. Senescent MSCs are characterized by enlarged cells and
  nuclei, increased number of stress fibers, increased number of γH2AX foci and senescence-associated
  heterochromatin foci (SAHF), positive staining for SA-βGal and increased senescence
  markers and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).
