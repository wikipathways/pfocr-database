caption: Metabolic changes induced by hypoxia. Enhanced expression of the icl gene
  caused the conversion of isocitrate to glyoxylate and succinate. The glcB and gcvB
  genes are involved in the conversion of glyoxylate to malate and glyoxylate to glycine,
  respectively. The electrons generated in this pathway may lead to nitrate reduction,
  which is also associated with increased dosR expression. Increased dosR expression
  also affects the expression of other genes such as narK2 and narX.
