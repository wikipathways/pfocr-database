caption: The complex roles of Wnts in cartilage homeostasis and disease. a | Both
  overexpression and loss of β-catenin in the articular cartilage lead to joint damage.
  Overexpression β-catenin results in chondrocytes hypertrophy and loss of matrix
  quality, whereas loss of β-catenin function results in tissue damage through chondrocyte
  death. b | Canonical and noncanonical Wnt signalling pathways keep each other in
  check through reciprocal inhibition. The canonical pathway appears to stimulate
  proliferation. The noncanonical pathway stimulates dedifferentiation.

  description: The complex roles of Wnts in cartilage homeostasis and disease. a |
    Both overexpression and loss of β-catenin in the articular cartilage lead to joint
    damage. Overexpression β-catenin results in chondrocytes hypertrophy and loss
    of matrix quality, whereas loss of β-catenin function results in tissue damage
    through chondrocyte death. b | Canonical and noncanonical Wnt signalling pathways
    keep each other in check through reciprocal inhibition. The canonical pathway
    appears to stimulate proliferation. The noncanonical pathway stimulates dedifferentiation.
