caption: RGC death induced by glaucomatous stimuli involves receptor-mediated caspase
  activation, and caspase-dependent and -independent components of the mitochondrial
  cell death pathway. Amplified ROS generation and oxidative damage are associated
  with both receptor-mediated and mitochondria-mediated pathways of RGC death. A critical
  balance between a variety of intracellular signaling pathways linked to cell survival
  or cell death determines whether a RGC dies or survives the glaucomatous stress
  (IOP, intraocular pressure; ROS, reactive oxygen species; bcl-xL and bax, anti-apoptotic
  and pro-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family of proteins, respectively; aif and
  c, mitochondrial cell death mediators, apoptosis inducing factor and cytochrome
  c, respectively; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha; TNF-R1, TNF death receptor;
  NO, nitric oxide; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappaB, transcription factor; IκB, NF-κB
  inhibiting protein; JNK and ERK, mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-jun N-terminal
  kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, respectively).
