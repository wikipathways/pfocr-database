caption: Sorting and trafficking of exosomes. (a) In non-polarized cells, GPI-anchoring,
  lipid raft-association or antibody-induced oligomerization sorts proteins into the
  exosomal pathway [,]. Degradation of the clathrin adaptor AP2 reroutes the transferrin
  receptor away from recycling (orange) and towards the MVB pathway (red) []. This
  is dependent upon binding of the YXXΦ motif of the transferrin receptor to the class
  E protein Alix. Many studies have shown that increasing intracellular calcium[,-],
  decreasing membrane cholesterol [,,] or inducing cellular stress [,] stimulates
  the release of exosomes. Once released, exosomes interact with cells by binding
  to specific receptors such as Tim-4 [], an endogenous phosphatidylserine receptor
  [], or other cell surface molecules [], or by directly fusing with target cells
  []. (b) Epithelial cells release exosomes at both the apical (intestine, kidney)
  and basolateral (intestine) surfaces [,,]. Exosomes released apically by intestinal
  epithelial cells have a different composition than those released basolaterally
  [], raising the possibility of differential sorting into apical and basolateral
  exosomes. However, how this might occur is still largely speculative. Here, we depict
  two potential sorting mechanisms (red dashed arrows) that might function in polarized
  exosomal sorting; on the basis of mechanisms operating in non-polarized cells, we
  hypothesize that GPI-anchoring and association with lipid rafts (which are both
  apical targeting signals in the biosynthetic route in polarized cells []) direct
  proteins into MVBs destined for fusion with the apical membrane. Sorting into MVBs
  destined for basolateral release might use interactions between the ESCRT machinery
  and canonical basolateral sorting signals. In a manner analogous to that seen in
  non-polarized cells, binding of Alix to the YXXΦ motif of the transferrin receptor
  might direct it into exosomes destined for basolateral release. It is currently
  unknown whether apical and basolateral exosomes arise from two separate LE/MVBs
  or from a common LE/MVB pool []. The V0 subunit of the vacuolar ATPase has been
  implicated in the apical secretion of exosomes []; it remains to be investigated
  if Rab11, which is involved in exosome release in non-polarized cells [], and syntaxin-3,
  which is involved in secretory granule exocytosis [], also function in apical release
  of exosomes.
