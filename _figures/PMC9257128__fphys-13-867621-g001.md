caption: 'Proposed non-photic and photoperiodic pathways that control pupal diapause
  in the Chinese tussar moth, Antheraea pernyi (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae). Both pathways
  are based on circadian clock-driven regulation of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase
  (aaNAT) as an endocrine conjunct between the clock and the secretagogue prothoracicotropic
  hormone (PTTH). The non-photic pathway responds to temperature rather than light.
  In the photoperiodic pathway (right), long-day (LD) conditions prevent or terminate
  diapause, whereas short-day (SD) conditions induce or maintain diapause. In both
  the non-photic and photoperiodic pathways, metamorphosis is driven by 20-hydroxyecdysone
  derived from 20C monooxygenation of ecdysone (E) secreted by the prothoracic gland
  (PTG) under stimulation by PTTH released from dorsolateral neurosecretory cells
  colocalized with circadian clock neurons. The clock operates based on an interlocked
  transcription/translation coupled negative feedback loop consisting of the genes
  period, timeless, cycle, clock, vrille, PAR domain protein 1, cryptochrome, double-time,
  clockwork orange, sgg, and lark. The clock neurons are equipped with a melatonin-synthesizing
  enzyme complex such as aaNAT and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase as well as their
  substrate indoleamines. aaNAT is a clock-controlled gene that has cis element enhancer
  E-boxes in its upstream promotor region, which is where the cycle/Clock (cyc/Clk)
  heterodimer binds. This machinery synthesizes melatonin from 5-hydroxytryptamine
  (5HT; serotonin). In the photoperiodic pathway, aaNAT transcription under circadian
  control is stimulated at night and under long-day conditions. PTTH-secreting cells
  express melatonin receptor type 2 (MT2). Melatonin binding to this receptor opens
  Ca2+ channels in the cell membrane, which increases the intercellular Ca2+ concentration.
  The influx of Ca2+ activates protein kinase C (PKC) for the phosphorylation of Rab8,
  which in turn drives exocytosis of secretary granules containing PTTH to the hemocoel.
  The released PTTH stimulates the PTG to release ecdysone, a prohormone of the molting
  hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). 20E makes peripheral cells commit to metamorphosis
  or apoptosis. Under short-day conditions, the aaNAT transcription level is low,
  and therefore, melatonin synthesis is also low, which results in the activation
  of 5HT receptor type B, which opens the endocrine switch, resulting in the induction
  or maintenance of diapause. In the temperature-based pathway (left), diapause is
  terminated after about 2 months of exposure to low temperatures. This process is
  likely independent of the photoperiodic process, and it is possible that another
  type of aaNAT, aaNATB, is expressed in clock neurons and another type of 5HTR, 5HTRA
  (=5HTR1A), is expressed in PTTH-secreting cells. How this pathway increases or decreases
  aaNAT expression under a particular photoperiod or temperature remains unknown,
  and it is difficult to solve multi-oscillator equations due to the large numbers
  of genes and proteins involved.'
