caption: Signaling pathways associated with PCSK9 during the immune response (created
  in https://BioRender.com). ① MAPK signaling pathway. MAPK regulates cytotoxicity
  and metabolic switching in activated CD8 + T cells through the activation of NFATc1.
  PCSK9 is involved in endothelial cell apoptosis through the MAPK and Bcl-2/Bax-Caspase
  9/3 signaling pathways. ② PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. IL-12 and T11TS immunotherapy
  can protect T cells from apoptosis and promote their survival through the PI3K/Akt
  pathway. Inhibition of PCSK9 by PI3K/Akt promotes apoptosis. ③ NF-κB signaling pathway.
  PCSK9 promotes Th cells differentiation through the activation of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. PCSK9 promotes vascular inflammatory responses through the upregulation
  or activation of the TLR-4/NF-κB pathway. ④ JAK/STAT signaling pathway. JAK/STAT
  promotes the differentiation of Th cells and the expansion of Tregs. PCSK9 expression
  in different cells is affected by JAK/STAT-related cytokines or kinases
