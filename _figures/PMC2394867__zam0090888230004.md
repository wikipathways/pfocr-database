caption: Hypothesized mechanism of E. coli biofilm formation with R1drd19. Envelope
  stress caused by conjugative pili initiates the network. OmpA is the potential outer
  membrane protein that receives the signal from conjugative pili and then translates
  the signal to the sensor, CpxA, of the two-component system in which CpxR is the
  response regulator. Phosphorylated CpxR (CpxR-P) then regulates biofilm-related
  gene expression. RseA-ﾏウ is another system involved in the envelope stress response
  system and, to some extent, overlaps with the CpxAR system. In this pathway, RseA
  is the sensor to detect the envelope stress caused by conjugative pili. MicA is
  a negative antisense regulator of OmpA synthesis, and this sRNA is induced by the
  overexpression of ﾏウ. OM stands for outer membrane, and IM stands for inner membrane.
