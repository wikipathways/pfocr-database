caption: 'Graph representing the interaction network of AGER (the gene encoding RAGE)
  with genes encoding RAGE ligands. HMGB1, S100B, and Diaph1 are the most well-known
  RAGE ligands. The interaction of AGER/RAGE with HMGB1, S100B, and Diaph1 may be
  crucial for EC progression. The interaction network includes the cancer-related
  factors NFKB1, NFKB2, and EGFR. The colors of the line suggest the type of interaction,
  that is, red—physical interactions; purple—co-expression; orange—predicted; blue—co-localization;
  light blue—pathway; green—genetic interactions; olive—shared protein domains. Limited
  to Homo sapiens. Abbreviations: HMGB1—high-mobility group box 1; S100B—S100 calcium-binding
  protein B; Diaph1—diaphanous-related formin 1; MAPKAPK5—MAPK-activated protein kinase
  5; CAPZA1—capping actin protein of muscle z-line subunit alpha 1; CAPZA2—capping
  actin protein of muscle z-line subunit alpha 2; IRAK4—interleukin 1 receptor-associated
  kinase 4; NFKB2—nuclear factor kappa B subunit 2; NFKB1—nuclear factor kappa B subunit
  1; RELA—RELA proto-oncogene, NFKB subunit; EGFR—epidermal growth factor receptor;
  S100A4—S100 calcium-binding protein A4; ITGB2—integrin subunit beta 2; SFTPB—surfactant
  protein B; CYP4B1—cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily B member 1; S100A1—S100 calcium-binding
  protein A1; SLC6A4—solute carrier family 6 member 4; ITGAM—integrin alpha M; S100A8—S100
  calcium-binding protein A8; S100A12—S100 calcium-binding protein A12. See File S2.

  the publication Zglejc-Waszak et al. [8]. These are not the same interaction networks
  as in the previous publication [8]. The similarity may result from the databases
