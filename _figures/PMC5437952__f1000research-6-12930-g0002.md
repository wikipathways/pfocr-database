caption: Activation of the LXR pathway by “physiological” oxidized cholesterol derivatives
  (oxysterols) or synthetic LXR agonists induces the decrease of PDC intracellular
  cholesterol content by stimulating cholesterol efflux through ABCA1 cholesterol
  transporter, inhibiting cholesterol entry by decreasing LDL or VLDL receptor (LDLR
  and VLDLR, respectively) expression and inhibiting de novo cholesterol biosynthesis
  (also known as the mevalonate pathway). Cholesterol efflux via ABCA1 requires cholesterol
  acceptors, such as APOA1, and immature HDL (HDL2/3) to generate mature HDL that
  transport cholesterol towards the liver. Activation of this LXR pathway inhibits
  TLR7-induced NF-κB activation and phosphorylation of STAT5 and Akt in response to
  IL-3 stimulation (green font and green arrows). Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis
  by statins (violet font and arrows) inhibits TLR7/9-induced IRF7 translocation in
  the nucleus, as well as phosphorylation of p38 kinase, and consequently the production
  of type I IFN. For more details and abbreviations, please refer to the main text.
