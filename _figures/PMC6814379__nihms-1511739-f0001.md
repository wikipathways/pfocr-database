caption: Glucose is metabolized to pyruvate which can serve as a substrate for oxidative
  phosphorylation. It can also be converted from there to lactate to maintain flux
  through glycolysis. This underlies the Warburg effect (red/red arrow). However,
  glucose metabolism is much more complex and serves many other purposes other than
  production of precursors for aerobic respiration, including the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) and de novo serine synthesis which connects glycolysis to nucleic
  acid synthesis as well as one carbon metabolism (blue/blue arrow). The synthesis
  of serine and glycine can also branch into other pathways such as production of
  cystathionine, which will make cysteine, and glycine is a substrate for heme, glutathione,
  and purines. Glycine can also be degraded using the glycine cleavage system (GCS)
  to produce carbon units. An additional product of this pathway is alpha-ketoglutarate
  (a-KG) which can feed into the citric acid cycle. (*) Represent metabolites that
  show preferential accumulation in tumors by positron emission tomography scan.
