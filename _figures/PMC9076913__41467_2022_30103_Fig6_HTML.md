caption: Mast cells use primarily a clathrin-mediated pathway to internalize SCF,
  leading to mast cell activation and anaphylaxis. In contrast, mast cells use predominantly
  clathrin and caveolin-mediated pathway to uptake tmSCF-based treatments and these
  treatments do not cause mast cell activation. Endothelial cells use both of clathrin-
  and caveolin-mediated pathway to uptake SCF, inducing angiogenesis in endothelial
  cells. Endothelial cells use both of clathrin- and caveolin-mediated pathway to
  internalize tmSCFPLs with medium uptake speed, triggering tube formation of endothelial
  cells and therapeutic angiogenesis. However, tmSCFNDs are internalized through clathrin/caveolin-mediated
  pathways with slow kinetics and do not induce an angiogenic response from mature
  endothelial cells. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) use clathrin-mediated pathway
  to uptake SCF, triggering colony formation of EPCs and bone marrow cell mobilization.
  For tmSCF-based treatments, EPCs use a caveolin-mediated pathway for internalization
  leading to colony formation and angiogenesis. Treatment with tmSCFNDs further induced
  the mobilization of CD34−CD133+ EPCs to the peripheral blood.
