caption: MYB3R transcription factors regulate a suite of G2/M-specific genes, including
  many positive mitotic regulators. However, SCL28, similarly regulated by MYB3Rs
  acts as a negative regulator of the cell cycle together with AtSMOS1, which may
  be under the control of the E2F-RBR pathway. Formation of the SCL28-AtSMOS1 heterodimer
  generates specific binding sequences, enabling direct transcriptional activation
  of SMR family genes. An increasing amount of SMR proteins, in turn, inhibits CDK
  activity, thereby negatively influencing cell cycle progression during G2. By controlling
  the activity of SCL28-AtSMOS1 heterodimer, G2 duration in the cell cycle can be
  finely tuned to maintain a proper balance between cell size and cell number in developing
  plant organs.
