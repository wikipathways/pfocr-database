caption: a. O-GlcNAc is a posttranslational modification that is regulated by the
  enzymatic activity of the cycling enzymes OGT and OGA, and the availability of the
  sugar donor UDP-GlcNAc produced from the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP).
  Inhibitors of the HBP enzyme GFAT or of OGT (in red dotted circles) lower O-GlcNAc
  levels in cells or animals, while inhibitors of OGA (in blue dotted circle) increase
  O-GlcNAc. b. Native and expressed protein ligations enable the preparation of homogeneously
  O-GlcNAcylated proteins. This involves the chemoselective reaction between a peptide
  fragment bearing a C-terminal thioester and another fragment with an N-terminal
  thiol (such as that in cysteines). These fragments can be prepared by recombinant
  expression or solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), with SPPS also enabling precise
  installation of O-GlcNAcylated serine/ threonine residues.
