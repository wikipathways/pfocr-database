caption: Ras trafficking routes among subcellular compartments. Ras proteins, synthesized
  in cytoplasmic polysomes, are farnesylated and bind to the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), where they are processed (dark blue arrows). Therein, H-Ras and N-Ras are
  palmitoylated and subsequently translocated to the Golgi complex (GC) and to recycling
  endosomes from where they are transported, via vesicular transport, to their final
  destination in plasma membrane (PM) lipid rafts and disordered membrane microdomains
  (light blue arrows). K-Ras4B is transported by an unknown mechanism, probably mediated
  by microtubules to disordered membrane microdomains at the PM (brown arrow). At
  the PM, H-Ras can diffuse between lipid rafts and disordered membrane microdomains
  depending on its activation state (red arrow). At the PM, H-Ras and N-Ras are depalmitoylated
  and sent back to the GC, closing the acylation cycle (light blue arrows). The trafficking
  mechanism is unclear and could involve RhoGDI-like chaperones. H-Ras and N-Ras can
  also be internalized through the endocytic pathway via endosomes (dashed orange
  arrow). At the PM, K-Ras4B can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC), dislodging
  it from the PM to endomembranes, particularly mitochondria (green arrow). Also at
  the PM, H-Ras and N-Ras can be ubiquitinated, promoting their association to endosomes
  (purple arrow). Calmodulin binding to K-Ras4B at the PM brings about its recruitment
  to endosomes and the GC (orange arrow).
