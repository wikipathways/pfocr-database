caption: The core of the Hippo pathway is the kinase cascade of MST1 and MST2 and
  LATS1 and LATS2. MST proteins, activated by upstream signals, phosphorylate and
  activate LATS proteins directly, and also activate the scaffold proteins MOB1 and
  SAV1. MAP4Ks also phosphorylate and activate LATS proteins. Activated LATS proteins
  phosphorylate YAP1 and TAZ at multiple sites, triggering 14-3-3-mediated cytoplasmic
  retention and protein degradation. YAP1 and TAZ function as transcriptional co-activators
  of TEAD proteins to induce expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and
  apoptosis. Merlin, Willin and KIBRA form a complex to recruit MSTs and LATS to the
  apical plasma membrane, activating LATS proteins. AMOT and PTPN14 sequesters YAP1
  and TAZ at tight junctions, and α-catenin sequesters YAP1 and TAZ at adherens junctions,
  to prevent their nuclear translocation. LKB1, which has important roles in both
  cell polarity and cellular stress response, regulates the activity of YAP1 and TAZ
  through activation of its substrates MARK and AMPK, both of which activate LATS.
  Activated AMPK also phosphorylates YAP1 and disrupts the YAP1 TEAD complex. The
  Hippo pathway is further regulated by ECM stiffness and mechanotransduction through
  Rho GTPases or JNK. GPCRs mediate many extracellular signals to either activate
  or inhibit LATS via Rho GTPase. AMOT, Angiomotin; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase;
  ECM, extracellular matrix; GPCRs, G protein-coupled receptors; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; LATS, large tumour suppressor; LKB1, liver kinase B1; MAP4K, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase kinase; MARK, microtubule affinity-regulating kinase;
  MOB1, Mob1 homologue; MST, mammalian ste20-like kinase; P, phosphorylation of stated
  amino acid; PTPN14, protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 14; SAV1, salvador
  family WW domain-containing protein 1; TAZ, transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding
  motif; TEAD, TEA domain family member; TAOK, thousand and one amino acid protein
  kinase; YAP1, Yes-associated protein 1.
