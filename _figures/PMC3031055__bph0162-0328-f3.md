caption: TFM-C-induced alteration to IL-12p40 chaperone interactions. (A) Under normal
  circumstances the IL-12 family subunit p40 has been shown to interact with CRT,
  PDI, GR94, GRP78 [*inferred from ability of bacterial HSP70 DnaK to assemble IL-12p40
  into IL-12p80 ()] and ERp44. (B) TFM-C results in increased IL-12p40 ERQC capture
  by CRT and blocks association with ERp44. Modulation of PDI, GRP94 and GRP78 levels
  are as yet unknown. TFM-C induces IL-12p40 degradation via drug-dependent association
  with HERP and putatively the rest of the ERAD retrotranslocation proteasomal pathway
  ().
