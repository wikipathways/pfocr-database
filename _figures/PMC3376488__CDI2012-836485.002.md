caption: T-cell development and differentiation. It is believed that thymic lymphoid
  progenitor cells are derived from circulating hematopoietic stem cells originating
  from the bone marrow. The initial CD4/CD8 double-negative (DN) thymocytes migrate
  from the corticomedullary junction to the subcapsular region of the cortex and sequentially
  transform into DN1 (CD44+CD25−), DN2 (CD44+CD25+), DN3 (CD44−CD25+), DN4 (CD44−CD25−)
  and pre-DP cells, which weakly express CD4, CD8, CD25 and CD44. Then CD4/CD8 double-positive
  (DP) thymocytes under the influence of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for
  Ras, Sos1 develop TCRαβ surface expression. cTECs present self-peptide-MHC complexes
  to TCRαβ to induce clonal deletion or thymocytes developing into CD4 or CD8 SP cell
  lineage. nTreg cell development possibly begins at the DP stage. Foxp3+ DP thymocytes
  with a functional IL-7 receptor and upregulated expression of Bcl-2 protect themselves
  from being negative selected. Foxp3+ DP thymocytes with CD103 expression are possible
  precursors of Foxp3+ CD8+ SP cells and finally differentiate into nTreg cells. SP
  cells move to the medulla through CCR7-mediated chemotaxis and interact with mTECs,
  which promiscuously express multifarious “tissue-specific” antigens. These antigens
  are taken up by DCs and cross-presented to developing thymocytes to induce negative
  selection establishing self-tolerance or nTreg lineage development. Circulating
  DCs bearing peripheral tissue antigens are also recruited intrathymically for cross-presentation.
  mTECs are also able to serve as APCs to induce nTreg lineage development and negative
  selection. Hassall's corpuscles are required to support nascent nTreg cell development.
  Positively selected mature thymocytes migrate through perivascular space in the
  corticomedullary junction and medulla and become peripheral naive T lymphocytes.
  When infection occurs, APCs process antigen and present epitope in combination with
  MHC molecules to TCR on the T-cell membrane in the presence of co-stimulatory molecules
  and with the help of specific cytokines to induce T-cell differentiation. IL-12
  and IFN-γ are essential for the induction of Th1 cell. IL-4 and IL-2 are required
  for naive CD4+ T-cell differentiation into IL-4-producing Th2 cells. TGF-β stimulates
  naive CD4+ T cell to differentiate into Th17 cells in the presence of IL-6 or induces
  iTreg cell in the presence of IL-2. Th17 cells can also be induced by an alternative
  pathway through the cooperation of TGF-β and IL-21 without the participation of
  IL-6. Tfh cells are induced with the help of IL-6 (mice) or IL-12 (human) to produce
  IL-21, which backfeeds to promote Tfh cell differentiation. As a major transcription
  factor, T-bet along with STAT4 and STAT1 is essential for Th1 cell differentiation.
  Activated Th1 cell can produce IFN-γ and IL-2 to help CD8+ effector T-cell functioning.
  GATA3 is the Th2 master regulator. STAT6 and STAT5 are essential in Th2 cell differentiation
  and expansion. STAT3 cooperates with STAT6 in promoting Th2 cell development. TCF-1
  participates in GATA3 activation and promotes STAT6-independent IL-4-producing Th2
  cell differentiation. Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 to boost antibody production
  in B cells against extracellular parasites. Production of IL-17 by Th17 cells is
  ROR-γt and ROR-α dependent. STAT3 is involved in Th17 cell differentiation, expansion
  and maintenance. Th17 cells participate in the immune response against extracellular
  bacteria by production of IL-17. Treg cell development is controlled by Foxp3 that
  is required for Treg lineage commitment, differentiation, expansion and function.
  STAT5 promotes Treg cell development by enhanced expression of Foxp3. Treg cells
  play a critical role in maintaining homeostasis and immune tolerance by suppression
  of effector cell in a cell-contact or cytokine-mediated pattern. Lineage commitment
  of Tfh cell is controlled by Bcl-6, while Blimp-1 plays an inhibitory effect on
  Tfh cell generation and function. STAT3 is necessary for Tfh cell development. Tfh
  cells interact with B cells in germinal center to induce generation of long-lived
  plasma cells and memory B cells. Naive CD8+ T cell primed by signals from TCR and
  co-stimulatory molecules differentiate into early effector cell expressing transcription
  factor T-bet and cytotoxic cytokines, for example, IFN-γ, TNF-α to acquire partial
  cytolytic abilities. The early effector cell further differentiates into late effector
  cell or memory cell, and this is determined by multiple factors such as the strength
  of IL-2R and the presence of IL-12, the presence of distinct amounts of intracellular
  components such as proteasome, T-bet, CD8 and IL-7Rα, or the potency of TCR signals.
  T-bet and Blimp-1 are responsible for IFN-γ expression and participate in the cytolytic
  gene expression, for example, Granyeme B, Perforin to induce short-lived effector
  CD8+ T cells. STAT5 plays a critical role in maintenance of phenotype of effector
  CD8+ T cells. Eomes and Bcl-6 expressions favor memory CD8+ T-cells differentiation.
  STAT5 activation also promotes memory CD8+ T-cell survival.
