caption: Key miRNAs and their targets involved in the host cell response to JEV invasion.
  A majority of miRNAs regulate the NFκB pathway, including miR-155-targeted SHIP1
  and PEL1, miR-301-targeted NKRF, miR-22-targeted MAVS, miR29-b-targeted TNFAIP3
  and miR-19b-3p-targeted RNF11. IFN and cytokine response is regulated by miR-301-targeted
  SOCS5 and IRF1, miR-432-targeted STAT1 and miR-34c-5p-regulated NOTCH1. RIG1 regulates
  miR-15 promoter via the MAPK/NFκB pathways. miR-15 regulates RIG-1 via its target
  RNF125. miR-22 promoter is indirectly regulated by JEV. miR-33a5p targets the translation
  factor EEF1A1 to restrict viral replication. TRIAP1, STAT3 and MAP2K7 are targeted
  by miR-125b-5p. miR-374-5p targets PTEN to regulate the PI3K/AKT pathway. let-7a/b
  targets cell surface receptors, NOTCH1 and TLR7, and is exported in exosomes to
  cause neuronal apoptosis by caspase activation.
