caption: A pro-adhesive PPARγ-mediated chemokine receptor switch, CCR2→CX3CR1, in
  atherosclerosis. LDL diffuses from the blood into the vascular intima, where it
  undergoes oxidative modifications forming randomly distributed extracellular pools
  of oxLDL and its stable linoleic acid metabolites. Circulating blood monocytes expressing
  both CCR2 and CX3CR1 invade inflamed arteries in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and chemoattractants produced by vascular endothelium through a multi-step process
  that includes selectin-mediated rolling, integrin-firm arrest, spreading and diapedesis.
  After entering the subendothelial space, the atheromatous microenvironment rich
  in oxLDL stimulates monocyte differentiation into foamy macrophages that are the
  predominant cell population in early atherosclerotic lesions. Furthermore, ingestion
  of oxLDL by monocytes activates the transcription factor PPARγ, which not only participates
  in maturation of monocytes to macrophages, but also promotes simultaneous downregulation
  of CCR2 and upregulation of the adhesion chemokine receptor CX3CR1 expression, thus
  promoting cessation of macrophage migration, and their capture and retention in
  the plaque. Furthermore, since CX3CR1 and its ligand CX3CL1 are expressed by various
  cell types in lesions, this pro-adhesive CCR2→CX3CR1 switch may support formation
  of numerous heterotypic and homotypic intercellular interactions maintained by a
  pro-atherogenic CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis that may contribute towards organization of cells
  in plaque. Mo, monocyte; Mϕ, foamy macrophage; oxLDL, oxidized LDL; SMC, smooth
  muscle cell.
