caption: C. albicans mechanisms to evade AMP responses. Histatin 5 (Hst 5) is taken
  up by the C. albicans influx transporters Dur3 and Dur31 and induces the formation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS); in addition, Hst 5 acts by promoting the efflux
  of ions and ATP. The Hog1 MAP kinase pathway is activated during AMP stress and
  upregulates antioxidative and other response mechanisms to overcome AMP activity.
  The toxicity of Hst 5 is decreased further by its extrusion from fungal cells via
  the polyamine efflux transporter Flu1. The cell wall-anchored protease Sap9 cleaves
  and inactivates Hst 5 on the outside of fungal cells. In addition, the shed exodomain
  fragment of the Msb2 membrane sensor (Msb2*) binds several AMPs extracellularly
  to provide broad-range protection against AMPs. P, phosphate.
