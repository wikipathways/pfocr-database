caption: Apoptosis inhibition in cancer. Schematic representation compiling some of
  the described mechanisms of apoptosis inhibition in cancer cells. Certain cancer
  cells have been observed to activate the PI3K-Akt pathway as survival mechanisms.
  In healthy cells and early-stage cancer cells, Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)
  can induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, there is evidence proving that
  in late-stage cancer cells, TGF-β can promote tumorigenesis, metastasis, and chemoresistance.
  Another described mechanism for cancer cell survival is the activation of the Ciclooxygenase
  2 (COX-2) pathway, which activated Akt and inhibits the overall antitumor effect
  of TGF-β in healthy cells or early-stage cancer cells.
