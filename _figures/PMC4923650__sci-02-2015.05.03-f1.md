caption: Integration of RDGN with TGF-β to regulate EMT. Upon ligand binding, TGF-β
  receptor type I/II (TGFβRI/II) are sequentially phosphorylated, leading to further
  phosphorylation of smad2/3. Then phosphorylated smad2/3 recruits smad4. The complex
  translocates into the nucleus to transcriptionally activate mesenchymal genes Snail/Slug,
  Zeb1, etc., and represses epithelial genes E-cadherin and cytokeratin, leading to
  the EMT phenotype. DACH1 is reported to repress TGFβRI/II expression, and associates
  with smad2/3/4 to recruit transcriptional repressors NCoR/mSin to block Smad activation.
  DACH1 could also recruit transcription repressors to AP-1 protein to indirectly
  inhibit TGF- activation. In opposite, SIX/EYA complex up-regulates the expressions
  of TGFβRI/II and smad3, and down-regulates smad7, enhancing the activation of TGF-β.
  RDGN, Retinal Determination Gene Network; TGF-β, transforming growth factors β;
  EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
