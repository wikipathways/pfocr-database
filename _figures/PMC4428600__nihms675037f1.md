caption: Binding of Wnt ligands to frizzled and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) complex leads to attenuation of phosphorylation and stabilization
  of cytoplasmic β-catenin. β-catenin is then translocated into the nucleus, where
  it associates with and activates T cell factor (TCF). TCF activation leads to transcription
  of Wnt target genes including VEGF (left). Nanoparticle delivery of VLN inhibits
  LRP6 leading to destabilization of β-catenin, inactivation of TCF, and inhibition
  of transcription of Wnt target genes including VEGF (right).
