caption: Endogenous and exogenous apoptotic events are involved in ischemic cardio-brain
  injuries. Major apoptosis pathways include mitochondria-dependent and death receptor-mediated.
  These apoptosis pathways together interacted mutually when ischemic diseases occurred.
  For the former, hypoxia-induced ROS surge and DNA damage directly activated caspase-2
  and downstream Bid-activated mitochondrial apoptosis. In parallel, the activated
  p53 also stimulated the mitochondrial apoptotic process. Meanwhile, DNA damage,
  ER stress and hypoxia metabolic stress can evoke the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway
  by activating BH-3 only protein. As for the specific process of mitochondrial apoptosis,
  Bax and Bak dimers induced by hypoxia formed the channels of cyt-c and AIF in and
  out on the mitochondrial membrane, which further infuriated the overexpression of
  Apaf-1, caspase-9 and the apoptosis executor caspase-3 to seduce apoptosis. On the
  contrary, the increased Smac could negatively inhibit IAPs to further subdue mitochondrial
  apoptosis. For the latter, pro-caspase-8 and pro-caspase-10 could be activated by
  the combination of death receptors (FasL/TRAIL) and death ligands (Fas/TRAILR).
  Together with ER stress and caspase-2, caspase-3/6/7 was thus triggered to result
  in apoptosis. On the other hand, the formation of TRADD, TRAF, CIAP1/2 and RIPK1
  complexes activated by TNF can also lead to apoptosis by irritating caspase-3/6/7/8.
