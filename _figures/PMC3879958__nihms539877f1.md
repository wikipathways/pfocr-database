caption: (A) The GDP/GTP cycle of Ras is shown. Inactive, GDP-bound Ras is activated
  by a GEF that induces the release of GDP and thereby permits GTP to bind. GTP binding
  induces a marked conformational change in Ras that allows it to bind effectors via
  their Ras binding domains (RBD). The “on” state of Ras is limited by its slow intrinsic
  GTPase activity, which is accelerated up to 105 fold by the binding of a GAP, and
  allows Ras to return to its inactive, GDP-bound state. (B) The Ras/Raf-1/Erk pathway.
  This pathway is engaged by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are activated
  upon growth factor binding. The adaptor protein GRB2 binds to activated (that is,
  phosphorylated) RTKs. GRB2 also binds the GEF son of sevenless (SOS) and brings
  it to the membrane where it can activate Ras. Ras initiates downstream signaling
  by bringing RAF1 to the membrane and activating its kinase activity. This is the
  best characterized Ras regulated pathway and it is frequently dysregulated in cancer.
  (C) Multiplex regulation of, and signaling from, Ras. The various families of GEFs,
  GAPs and effectors that have been reported to regulate Ras or transmit signals from
  Ras-GTP, are shown.
