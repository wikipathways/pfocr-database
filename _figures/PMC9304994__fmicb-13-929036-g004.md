caption: A hypothetical model of the IAA-mediated interaction between strains Z1 and
  Z2 for nitrogen removal. (1) The strain Z2 promoted the autologous Iac metabolic
  pathway, provided IAA for the strain Z1, and activated the Iaa metabolic pathway
  for strain Z1. (2) IAA induced the expression of key enzymes in denitrification
  in the nitrogen removal process. (3) The metabolic pathway of IAA in strain Z1 required
  nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptors. (4) The activation of Iaa pathway in
  strain Z1 reduced the level of intracellular oxidative stress. (5) Strain Z2 played
  a major role in promoting energy flow and maintaining metabolic levels.
