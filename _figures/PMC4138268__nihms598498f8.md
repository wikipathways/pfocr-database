caption: Schematic representation of smoke-provoked MUC1 glycosylation in regulation
  of MUC1-C/p120ctn interaction and adherens junction (AJ) disruption. MUC1 is localized
  on the apical plasma membrane (PM) of polarized HBE cells as a MUC1-N/MUC1-C heterodimer
  where it is spatially segregated from AJs and EGFR on the basolateral PM. Cigarette
  smoke (Smk) stimulates internalization of MUC1 and its intracellular trafficking
  to the Golgi, where MUC1 is initially O-glycosylated (O-Gly) by GALNT6 and further
  N- (N-Gly) and O-glycosylated by other enzymes. In response to smoke, fully glycosylated
  MUC1 is sent back to apical PM and subsequently translocated to basolateral PM,
  where MUC1-C, EGFR and galectin-3 form a signalosome through the bridging of their
  sugar moieties following smoke-induced shedding of MUC1-N. Src is also recruited
  to the MUC1-C/EGFR/galectin-3 complex by smoke where it binds the cytoplasmic tail
  of MUC1-C (MUC1-CT). Smoke destroys tight junctions (TJs) and gains access to basolateral
  EGFR through increased paracellular permeability. MUC1-C is then activated through
  tyrosine phosphorylation (Y-P) by smoke-induced EGFR/Src/Jnk signaling. Activation
  of MUC1-C promotes its interaction with p120ctn and β-ctn at AJs. MUC1-C/p120ctn
  interaction exposes ubiquitin ligation sites of E-cad and thereby results in proteasomal
  degradation of E-cad, a hallmark of EMT []. MUC1-C/β-ctn interaction facilitates
  β-ctn’s entry into nucleus and activates the Wnt signaling pathway leading to cell
  proliferation and migration []. Blocking smoke-induced MUC1 glycosylation through
  GALNT6 knock down prevents the loss of Ecad and restores AJ integrity. Thus, targeting
  the initiating O-glycosylation step of MUC1 may provide a novel therapeutic approach
  to prevent smoke-induced EMT and early lung carcinogenesis.
