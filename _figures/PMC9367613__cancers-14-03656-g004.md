caption: 'Radiomics workflow typically seen in the included studies. Imaging, biological,
  and clinical data were sourced from institutions and/or public repositories, before
  being subjected to further processing. To develop radiomic signatures, Pipeline
  A describes the main approach taken in the reviewed studies. Here, radiomic features
  were directly analysed for their association with CD8+ TILs. Features associated
  with CD8+ TILs were retained for radiomic signature derivation, model construction,
  and further evaluation. Pipeline B describes an alternate pathway where radiomic
  signatures were first developed by assessing the association of features with clinical
  variables, e.g., objective response. Signatures were then evaluated for their association
  with CD8+ TILs to explain, at least partially, the biological basis of the radiomic
  signatures. Acronyms: TCIA/TCGA = The Cancer Imaging Archive/The Cancer Genome Atlas,
  IHC = immunohistochemistry, RNA-seq = RNA sequencing.'
