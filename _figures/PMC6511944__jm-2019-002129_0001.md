caption: Several mechanisms of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling in macrophages are
  connected to cell death. LPS-mediated activation of the NF-κB pathway results in
  the overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). This leads to the
  production of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive nitrogen species (RNOS), which are
  involved in cell death. In the 15-LOX-1 pathway, 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid
  (13-HpODE), the metabolite of 15-LOX-1 activity, can also induce cell death. Both
  mechanisms act in concert, and crosstalk exists.
