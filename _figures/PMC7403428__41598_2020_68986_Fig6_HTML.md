caption: Hypothesis explaining the difference between MBZ and other TBAs for MAPK
  activation. TBAs are known to activate MAPK signalling, however, mainly through
  SAP/JNK. MBZ but no other benzimidazoles activate ERK. Additionally, MBZ inhibits
  DYRK1b which can lead to ERK activation, as well as potently inhibits BRAF which
  in cells with wild type RAF leads to paradoxical ERK activation.
papertitle: Mebendazole is unique among tubulin-active drugs in activating the MEKâ€“ERK
  pathway.
