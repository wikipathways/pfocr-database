caption: Sub-networks constructed based on the differentially expressed genes identified
  in the communities of interest in the protein-protein interaction network using
  CFinder software. The network is undirected, where a circular node represents a
  protein and a gray line represents an interaction between nodes. (A) A sub-PPI network
  was identified in the community 1 of the M1 group and is constructed of 42 protein
  nodes, 10 of which are colored red to indicate highest degree. (B) The PPI network
  consists of 11 proteins from community 1 of the M2 group, including seven of the
  previously identified highest degree proteins and 24 PPIs. (C) The PPI network derives
  from community 3 of the M2 group. PPI, protein-protein interaction.
