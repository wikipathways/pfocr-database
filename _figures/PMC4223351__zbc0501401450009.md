caption: Schematic diagram indicating a hypothesis of the mechanism of GnT-V expression
  regulating colon tumor development. Pathways implicated in the regulation of colon
  tumor development are depicted based on the observations presented in this study.
  The expression level of GnT-V regulates the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  through N-glycan modulation of Wnt receptors, resulting in abnormal colon tumorigenesis
  and affecting adenoma progression in Apcmin/+ mice. The regulation of colon tumor
  development by GnT-V is mediated at least in part by alterations in the cancer stem
  cell population.
