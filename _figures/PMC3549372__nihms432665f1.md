caption: Retinoic acid signaling pathway for neurogranin expression. Retinoic acid
  is transported into the cell by CRBP and cellular levels are controlled by CYP26A1
  enzyme that degrades RA. RA is processed by a series of dehydrogenase enzymes (ADH,
  ROLDH, RALDH) into its 9-cis RA form that can interact with RXR-γ. The RXR-γ/9-cis
  RA complex binds the TRE, along with the T3/TR-β to activate neurogranin expression.
  Without both ligands (9-cis RA and T3) binding to RXR-γ and TR-β, respectively,
  neurogranin expression is not initiated (red ‘X’). Tri-iodothryonine, T3; cellular
  retinol-binding protein, CRBP; CYP26, CYP26A1 enzyme; aldehyde dehydrogenase, ADH;
  retinol dehydrogenase, ROLDH, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, RALDH; 9-cis-retinoic
  acid, 9-cis RA; retinoid-X-receptor-γ, RXR-γ; thyroid hormone nuclear receptor-β,
  TR-β; Thyroid hormone responsive element, TRE; Neurogranin, Ng.
