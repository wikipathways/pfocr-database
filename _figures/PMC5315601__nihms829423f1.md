caption: 'Representation of the mechanisms of UV-induced cellular response in skin:
  1) UV-radiation is absorbed by the genomic DNA and causes direct DNA damage through
  the formation of CPDs and (6–4) PPs. The formation of these photoproducts further
  triggers the ATR signaling pathway to activate Chk1 and p53. Activated p53 further
  initiates cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and/or apoptosis. In the case where repair
  and tumor suppressor functions are compromised, mutations occur that eventually
  lead to skin cancer. 2) Molecules in the mitochondria such as porphyrins absorb
  UV radiation to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS can either cause
  DNA damage, or activate the MAPK pathway through ERK1/2, JNK or p38 MAPK, which
  in turn activates transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB. These pathways regulate
  inflammation, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis, and the presence of ROS destabilizes
  these processes and induce cellular stress.'
