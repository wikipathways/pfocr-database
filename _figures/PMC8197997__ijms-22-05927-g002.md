caption: 'Anterograde CaV1.2 channel delivery pathways. Bottom: A depiction of the
  ‘Biosynthetic Delivery Pathway’ that commences when CaVα1c are translated directly
  into the rER membrane. These pore-forming subunits have several ER retention motifs
  and just one identified ER export motif. Binding of the CaVβ subunit to the CaVα1c
  while in the ER membrane is thought to lessen the influence of the retention signals
  and favor channel export, whereby the channels subsequently exit the ER in vesicles
  to the Golgi complex. Absence of the CaVβ subunit may render the channels more vulnerable
  to ubiquitination on the ER membrane, precipitating proteosomal degradation. Note
  this vulnerability has been reported in neuronal CaV1.2 and has not yet been confirmed
  in the cardiac channels. Single or clustered channels exit the trans-Golgi network
  (TGN) and are carried along microtubules by motor proteins to BIN1-anchored delivery
  hubs on the t-tubule sarcolemma to assume positions in dyadic and caveolar regions.
  It is unclear exactly when and where in the anterograde trafficking pathway CaVα2δ
  joins the complex. Top: Stable sarcolemmal CaV1.2 channel expression is maintained
  in the face of ongoing channel internalization by the endosomal recycling pathway.
  Endocytosed channels enter the early endosome and are sorted, a subpopulation is
  sent to Rab7 positive late endosomes and may subsequently undergo lysosomal degradation.
  The remainder of the channels are recycled back to the membrane either through a
  fast, direct pathway from the early endosome along a Rab4-dependent fast recycling
  pathway, or through a slower Rab11-dependent recycling pathway from the recycling
  endosome. If some channels are degraded, it is possible that endosomal reservoirs
  of channels take their place and supplement this pathway to maintain stable membrane
  expression.'
