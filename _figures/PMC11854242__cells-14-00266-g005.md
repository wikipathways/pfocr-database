caption: 'YAP-mediated gene expression in liver fibrosis. Simplified scheme showing
  the regulation of profibrotic gene expression by YAP during liver fibrosis and the
  attenuation of gene expression by the inhibitor verteprofin. When the Hippo pathway
  is activated, the active Hippo core kinase complex phosphorylates YAP at five serine
  residues, leading to either the cytoplasmic retention of YAP through interaction
  with 14-3-3 proteins or the degradation of YAP by the proteasome. Inactivation of
  the Hippo core kinase complex in response to initial tissue injury or mechanotransduction
  prevents YAP phosphorylation, allowing its nuclear translocation. Once in the nucleus,
  YAP forms a complex with TEAD transcription factors, leading to the upregulation
  of profibrotic genes, such as CTGF, COL1A1, ACTA2, and ANKRD1, among others. Treatment
  of HSCs or animal models with the FDA-approved drug verteprofin, which blocks the
  interaction between YAP and TEADs, inhibits YAP/TEAD-mediated profibrotic gene expression,
  HSC activation, and the progression of fibrosis. The precise mechanism leading to
  the activation of Hippo pathway activity in response to upstream signals during
  liver fibrosis remains to be fully determined. However, when cells encounter a rigid
  ECM, they respond by adjusting their cytoskeletal tension through integrin-mediated
  focal adhesions, which link the ECM to the intracellular F-actin cytoskeleton, involving
  kinases, such as Src and FAK, and adhesion proteins, such as vinculin, talin, and
  paxillin. Integrin-mediated mechanosignaling induces RhoA activation via RHO-GEFs,
  which triggers the reorganization of the cytoskeleton. RhoA, via the ROCK2-dependent
  regulation of myosin II motors, also promotes an increase in actomyosin tension.
  The increase in cell contractility, among other actin-dependent mechanisms, modulates
  YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation by inhibiting Hippo pathway signaling. YAP/TAZ then
  interact with TEAD transcription factors to promote target gene expression. Multiple
  other upstream inputs, such as GPCR signaling induced by ligands such as ET-1, Ang
  II, S1P, and LPA, can inhibit Hippo signaling via RhoA. Abbreviations: ACTA2, smooth
