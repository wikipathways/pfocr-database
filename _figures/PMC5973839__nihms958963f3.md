caption: 'Fumarate accumulation, HIF-1α regulation, and glycolysis in renal cells
  with increased intracellular glucose. The reduced pAMPK enhances NOX4 leading to
  increased H2O2, which reduces fumarate hydratase (FH) levels and then leads to fumarate
  accumulation. Both increased H2O2 and fumarate contribute to ER stress and thereafter
  apoptosis. The increased fumarate suppresses HIF-PHD activity resulting in HIF-1α
  accumulation, which drives the metabolic flux to the glycolytic pathway (eg, through
  increased LDH) while suppresses oxidative phosphorylation (eg, through reduced PDK
  and increased PDH) and reduces mitochondrial   HIF-1α also increases levels of glucose
  transport proteins (eg, GLUT1 and GLUT4) and growth factors (eg, VEGF and TGF-β).
  Abbreviations: ADP, adenosine diphosphate; G-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; GLUT1/GLUT4,
  glucose transporters; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase;
  PHD, prolyl hydroxylase; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor.'
