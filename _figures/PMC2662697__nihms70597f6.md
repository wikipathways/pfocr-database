caption: 'C. pneumoniae infection mediates foam cell formation through at least two
  signalling pathways: TLR2 and TLR4-dependent signaling through MyD88, and TLR4-TRIF-dependent
  signalling. The MyD88 pathway leads to activation of NF-κB, and the TRIF pathway
  leads to activation of IRF3. The addition of ox-LDL increases C. pneumoniae-promoted
  foam cell formation and activates NF-κB and IRF3 signalling pathways. LXR agonists
  like GW3965 reverse C. pneumoniae-induced foam cell formation by increasing cholesterol
  efflux via ABCA1 expression. Others have shown that TLRs that can activate TRIF
  and IRF3 inhibit LXR responses () and we show that the LXR agonist GW3965, in turn,
  can inhibit C. pneumoniae-induced IRF3 activation, suggesting a bi-directional cross-talk.
  Thus, LXR activation can negatively modulate both TLR/MyD88 and TLR/TRIF-dependent
  innate immune signaling networks. Abbreviations: LXR= liver-X-receptor; ABCA1= ATP-binding
  cassette transporter.'
