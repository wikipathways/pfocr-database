caption: 'Multistep model of the evolution of classic ILC and its morphological variants.
  A lineage of ‘lobular’ disease evolves from a normal epithelial cell on a background
  of a loss of E-cadherin expression and function, and key early somatic alterations
  involving gain of chromosome 1q, loss of 16q, and mutations in PIK3CA, AKT1, or
  PTEN. The morphological and molecular diversity of in situ and invasive lobular
  lesions is likely to be a result of the subsequently arising pattern of molecular
  alterations that drive progression. Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) is distinguishable
  from lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) based on the extent of proliferation within
  the lobule. Pleomorphic LCIS (PLCIS) and florid LCIS (FLCIS) can emerge either from
  ALH (presumably) or from classic LCIS (CLCIS), with an increasing level of genomic
  complexity and the accumulation of mutations in driver genes such as ERBB2, ERBB3,
  and TP53. Various morphological variants of ILC have also been described (see also
  Fig. ), which exhibit either architectural or cytological atypia relative to the
  classic invasive type, which we imagine being the ‘default’ pathway of evolution.
  A number of important points to note: (1) the genomic alterations listed may arise
  during any stage of progression, though are likely to be acquired at the in situ
  stage, or earlier (e.g. amplification of 11q13 is evident in the in situ stage);
  (2) it is assumed FLCIS may progress to alveolar, solid, tubulo-lobular variants,
  or even the pleomorphic type; (3) it is uncommon for invasive tumours to be of a
  pure variant morphology, with tumours often also exhibiting classic and/or other
  variant patterns; (4) a variety of molecular alterations have been associated with
  some of these morphological variants, but these are not necessarily pathognomonic
  of the architectural variant; and (5) the interplay between the malignant cells
  and extracellular matrix may also impact the resulting growth pattern. -, loss;
