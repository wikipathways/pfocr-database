caption: Aquaporins network in the induction of metabolic disease. Schematic representation
  of the likely interaction of AQPs between adipocytes and hepatocytes in the context
  of insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes. The black arrows highlight the major
  interaction between adipocytes and hepatocytes during lipolysis of TG stores. Glycerol
  is trafficked between adipocytes and hepatocytes with the help of AQP7 and AQP9,
  respectively. Hepatic glycerol of adipose tissue origin can enter gluconeogenesis
  or de novo lipogenesis together with FFA to yield hepatic MAG, DAG and TAG. Obesity
  leads to mitochondrial dysfunction with the subsequent oxidative stress accumulation
  in form of H2O2. This is likely driven into the ER through AQP11, promoting the
  creation of a stress-promoting-stress circle (Red arrows). Conversely, AQP11 displays
  beneficial effects in adipocytes, where its overexpression leads to a decrease of
  the ER stress caused by lipid overload by promoting the efflux of H2O2 from the
  ER itself. We hypothesize that a similar protective mechanism could be mirrored
  in hepatocytes (Green arrow). The light blue arrows denote the novel branch of the
  insulin signaling pathway in hepatocytes, which involves AQP3 for its modulation.
  The insulin signaling from the PI3K/AKT branch brings to the inhibition of the gluconeogenesis
  in physiologic conditions. Accumulation of DAG in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes due
  to increased uptake of glycerol and FFA inhibits the signaling cascade at the level
  of PI3K/AKT with the subsequent up-regulation of the gluconeogenesis, increasing
  blood glucose levels. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
