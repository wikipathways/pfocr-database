caption: 'The bioactive form of thiamine is necessary for several cellular processes.
  TPP is the bioactive form of thiamine. It is a necessary cofactor in the pentose
  phosphate pathway, glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Additionally, it plays a role in
  maintaining equilibrium between pyruvate and lactate. TCA: tricarboxylic acid; TPP:
  thiamine pyrophosphate.'
