caption: Regulation of angiogenesis via the VEGF signaling pathway in CRC. As monoclonal
  antibodies to VEGFA or VEGFR2, bevacizumab, aflibercept, and ramucirumab can inhibit
  angiogenesis in CRC by binding to their corresponding molecules. The chemokine CCL19
  can promote miR-206 to inhibit VEGFA in a CCR7-dependent manner. MiR-181a and miR-590-5p
  inhibit the expression of related target molecules by binding to the target 3’-UTR.
  These processes can affect the expression of VEGFA. 4’-HW can block PI3K and AKT
  phosphorylation and inhibit VEGFA expression. The compounds Tan IIA and 5,6-dehyprocarivaine
  can also affect the increase in VEGFA.
