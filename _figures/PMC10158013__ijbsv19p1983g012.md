caption: Diagram shows new mechanism of As3+ carcinogenesis. Under normal condition,
  either basal or ligand-activated AHR can translocate to nuclei where it form repressive
  complexes with other nuclear proteins to limit the expression of the genes in the
  pathways of TGFβ, Nrf2 and oncogenesis. The cells are in a state of tumor suppressive.
  Exposure of the cells to As3+ will disrupt the tumor suppressor-like activity of
  AHR, either through preventing the formation of repressive complexes and/or blocking
  recruitment of the repressive complexes to these oncogenic genes. Meanwhile, the
  reduced AHR binding to the DNA may also enhance the nuclear translocation and transcriptional
  regulation of these oncogenic transcription factors induced by As3+, such as Nrf2
  and HIF1α, leading to active transcription and expression of oncogenes and genes
  in the TGFβ and Nrf2 signaling pathways, which promotes carcinogenesis or tumorigenesis.
