caption: Schematic representation of core pathways involved in development of Peyronie’s
  disease and their interrelationships. In canonical TGF-β signaling, binding of TGF-β1
  to the receptor leads to phosphorylation of SMAD2/SMAD3, triggering a cascade of
  responses. Phosphorylated SMAD2/SMAD3 in a complex with SMAD4 is then translocated
  to the nucleus, leading to the increased transcription of profibrotic genes. SMAD7,
  an inhibitory SMAD, is downregulated in PD and activates the TGF-β/SMAD signaling
  pathway. CTGF is directly induced by ERK1/2 and by non–canonical TGF-β signaling
  and then promotes TGF-β1 activity by decreasing SMAD7 expression and activating
  SMAD2 phosphorylation. IGF-1, which inhibits the transition of SMAD3 to nucleation,
  is also decreased in PD and contributes to the promotion of the TGF-β/SMAD pathway.
  TGF-β1 signaling also induces transcription of the profibrotic Hedgehog transcription
  factor GLI2, upregulates WNT ligands, and activates WNT/β-catenin signaling. Under
  activation of WNT signaling, GSK-3β loss of function prevents β-catenin phosphorylation.
  Subsequently, the unphosphorylated form of β-catenin accumulates in cytoplasm and
  enters the nucleus and then finally activates WNT target genes with the help of
  TCF/LEF family proteins. TGF-β1 inhibits the transcription of the WNT suppressors
  DKK1 and SFRP1 in a p38-dependent manner, and further activates the WNT/β-catenin
  signaling pathway involved in fibrosis. The profibrotic mechanism of TGF-β1-induced
  PI3K/AKT signaling involves the inactivation of NR4A1, which inhibits the expression
  of profibrotic genes. αVβ integrins activate intracellular signaling pathways, including
  RHOA/ROCK signaling. Subsequently, formation of F-actin stress fibers and translocation
  of YAP/TAZ to the nucleus are activated, promoting profibrotic gene expression via
  TEAD activation. Additionally, RHOA/ROCK signaling activates p300 in the nucleus
  through the activation of AKT, further promoting the transcription of profibrotic
  genes. YAP and TAZ also bind to the phosphorylated SMAD2/SMAD3 and SMAD4 complexes
  formed in the nucleus, and induce SERPINE1 transcription, thus leading to the excessive
  accumulation of ECM. TGF-β1–transforming growth factor-β1; CTGF–connective tissue
