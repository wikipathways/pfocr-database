caption: Mechanism of progesterone action in the brain. This figure provides a conceptual
  overview of how progesterone can elicit both genomic and non-genomic effects that
  impact its protective effects on the brain, and exemplifies how activation of complementary
  signaling cascades may be required for progesterone to fully elicit its effects.
  Using BDNF and two members of the ERK/MAPK family as paradigmatic examples of key
  mediators of progesterone-induced neuroprotection, this diagram underscores the
  fact that the protective effects of progesterone cannot be elicited by one signaling
  pathway alone, but rather, require complementary activation of multiple signaling
  pathways. In this example, the induction of BDNF synthesis requires the PR operating
  through its classical, genomic mechanism of action. However, such synthesis may
  not be meaningful unless the cellular content of BDNF can be secreted, leading in
  turn to the activation of its cognate receptors (ex. TrkB and/or p75) which can
  then elicit additional signaling pathways associated with cellular protection. This
  release of BDNF is mediated by a distinct receptor, Pgrmc1. In addition, other membrane-associated
  progesterone receptors, such as the mPR family of receptors, may elicit the activation
  of related signaling pathways that help finely regulate the process. In the example
  illustrated, activation of mPR may lead to activation of ERK1/2, which in turn,
  has been shown to exert an inhibitory influence on BDNF gene expression.
