caption: Pathway analysis of CNA suppressors. The 247 CNA facilitator genes in Supplementary
  Table  did not show significant enrichment in a pathway. The 253 CNA suppressor
  genes in Supplementary Table  were further subcategorized to amplification/insertion
  CNA suppressors (Supplementary Table ) and deletion CNA suppressors (Supplementary
  Table ). Amp/ins CNA suppressors include only 23 genes, while deletion CNA suppressors
  include 253 genes, suggesting that CRC cells with amplification/insertion CNA and
  deletion CNA are suppressed through different modalities. Deletion CNA suppressor
  genes show enrichment in the (A) Antigen Presentation Pathway, (B) Interferon signaling
  pathway, and (C) JAK-STAT signaling pathway, suggesting that CRC cells carrying
  CIN-associated deletion CNA are targeted by these immune-associated pathways and
  that they represent an immunosurveillance mechanism of CIN cells in CRC. Purple
  highlighting indicates particular genes with significant GE-CNA correlations and/or
  a cluster of such genes in the IPA pathways. Figures were generated with IPA (Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis, QIAGEN, Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis).
