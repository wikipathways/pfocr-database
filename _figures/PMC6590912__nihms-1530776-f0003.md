caption: Proposed mechanism by which TBI alters the brain-gut axis, and in turn, how
  peripheral pathological signals impact the brain. Right after TBI, dysfunctional
  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis disrupts metabolic balance and increases stress
  hormones such adrenocorticotrophic and cortisol. It is postulated that the ACTH-induced
  Epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) by adrenal gland together with efferent
  vagal output promote splanchnic hypoperfusion, thereby increasing Cytokines and
  chemokines. The secreted TNF-α by spleen macrophages after TBI binds TNF receptors
  (TNFRs) on intestinal epithelial cells and activates several pathways, including
  the NF-κB pathway that upregulates genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and
  myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). These signals enhance tight junction permeability
  in the intestine involving damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), Pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs), and cytokines. The Cytokines produced increases intestinal
  permeability and then penetrate the leaky BBB to contribute to secondary brain damage
  characterized by fatigue, and learning and memory dysfunctions.
