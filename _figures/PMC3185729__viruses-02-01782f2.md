caption: 'Schematic representation of the assembly and release of HCV. Replication
  occurs at dedicated ER-derived membranes. Core and NS5A interact with lipid droplets
  and recruit the other non-structural proteins, and with them, the replication complex.
  Core and genomic RNA interact and oligomerize, and must interact with the envelope
  glycoproteins to form the viral particle. The viral particle interacts with the
  VLDL. VLDL assembly is depicted on the left side. ApoB interacts with triglycerides
  in an MTP-dependent manner to form a pre-VLDL, which will accumulate more lipids
  and ApoE in an MTP dependent process. Both the VLDL and the virus continue to undergo
  maturation during their passage through the secretory pathway. Red blocks mark potential
  drug targets in this process: (1) inhibition of the interaction of NS5A with LD
  or the other non-structural proteins, thus blocking their recruitment to LDs; (2)
  inhibition of NS2, a late stage block of assembly; (3) inhibition of p7 (BIT225
  for example); (4) inhibition of the interaction of the core with LDs; (5) inhibition
  of the maturation of envelope proteins (inhibitors of α-glycosidases); (6) inhibition
  of core oligomerization and interaction with RNA; (7) inhibition of virus-VLDL association;
  (8) inhibition of VLDL secretion; (9) inhibition of VLDL formation from pre-VLDL
  targeting ApoE and MTP; (10) inhibition of the formation of pre-VLDL by the MTP
  dependent association of triglycerides with ApoB.'
