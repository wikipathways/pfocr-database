caption: 'An integrated synthesis of potential signal transduction responses to repetitive
  (HX9) preconditioning. A) Bioinformatic analyses revealed that preconditioning modulates
  receptor-mediated signaling activity through: Integrin receptors via SYK activation
  (left); RTK receptor signaling (such as VEGF, ERBB [estrogen-like], and growth factor
  receptors (center); and EGFRs and solute carrier complexes (SLCs) that suppress
  ferroptosis by regulating TP53 activity. Overall, these signaling pathways result
  in the expression of genes promoting cell survival (including those inhibiting ferroptosis),
  as well as the expression of pro-inflammatory and immune genes (see  and ). The
  former is more robust after HX9, the latter more dampened, relative to the expression
  changes triggered by HX1. B) and C) provide details for the activation and signaling
  of T cell receptors (TCR) and B cell receptors (BCR) shown in the red box in Panel
  A. Panel B shows the consequences of T cell activation occurring 3 h after both
  HX1 and HX9. The surface protein CD28, which serves as a co-stimulus required for
  T-cell activation and survival, was a significant upstream regulator in both groups.
  T cells produce TGFβ, which drives early signaling (), IL-17 from its CD4+ subset
  (consistent with ‘Th17 Activation Pathway’ being a top Canonical), and IL-6, TNFα,
  interferon gamma (IFNγ), and other cytokines that our bioinformatic findings, and
  existing literature, support as mediators of conditioning-induced signal transduction.
  Panel C relates to BCR signaling, which was activated in a delayed fashion 2 days
  after HX1 (and was the top Canonical in this group). Of note, BCR signaling reduces
  apoptosis through PI3K/Akt, and drives activation of the NFAT transcription factor
  family through SYK.'
