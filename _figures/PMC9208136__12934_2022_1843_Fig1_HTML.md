caption: 'Library construction and visual selection based on-plate and 96 deep-well
  plate selections. A Lycopene accumulation pathway in E. coli by heterogenous MVA
  pathway. The whole pathway was divided to three modules: module ESE, the upstream
  MVA pathway; module MPMI, the downstream MVA pathway; module EBI, the lycopene synthesis
  pathway containing Erg20, CrtE, CrtB, and CrtI, In the module2, an RBS library and
  combinatorial constructs based on three plasmid backbones (with the pT7 promoter
  and the p15A origin, with pTrc promoter and p15A origin, or with pTrc promoter and
  pSC101) were employed to screen the optimal expression levels for the four genes
  MVK, PMK, MVD, and IDI to achieve the purpose of optimizing the lycopene metabolic
  flux. B On-plate and 96-deep-well plate visual selection of pHM-library. Each colony
  on the plate or 96-deep-well plate showed different colors indicating different
  lycopene accumulation'
