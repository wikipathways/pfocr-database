caption: 'Putative metabolic pathway for the production of derivatives of nitrogen-containing
  azaphilone red pigments in the marine-derived Talaromyces sp. 30570 strain, based
  on the previously reported models for Monascus-like azaphilone pigments biosynthesis

  and reviewed by Liu et al. []. Names of the enzymes are specified with reference
  to those identified in M. ruber M7 [,]. The non-reducing polyketide synthase MrPigA
  gene cluster encodes for a starter unit acyl carrier protein transacylase (SAT),
  a ketoacyl synthase (KS), an acyltransferase (AT), a product template (PT), two
  acyl carrier proteins (ACP), a C-methyltransferase (MT) and a reductive release
  domain (R). MrPigC: C-11-Ketoreductase; MrPigD: 4-O-Acyltransferase; MrPigM: O-Acyltransferase;
  MrPigN: FAD-dependent monooxygenase; MrPigE: NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase; MrPigF:
  FAD-dependent oxidoreductase; MrPigO: Deacetylase. This figure was adapted from
  Chen et al. [] and Liu et al. [] with some modifications.'
