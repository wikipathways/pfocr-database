caption: The dual pathway model for altered N-glycan exposure during late apoptosis
  and formation of two distinct types of scMP (1). Conventional de novo glycan synthesis
  is not active during apoptosis (2). ER membranes with immature glycans are exposed
  on the cell surface and in ER-derived scMP (). Apoptosis is accompanied by a caspase-dependent
  activation of surface sialidase(s) leading to desialylation of pre-existing glycoepitopes
  on the cells surfaces and on PM-derived scMP.
