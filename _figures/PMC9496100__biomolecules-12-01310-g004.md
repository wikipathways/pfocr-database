caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of regulating CREB/BDNF signaling pathway by ginsenosides
  in treating cognitive impairment in the pathological model. CREB/BDNF signaling
  pathway can be activated by ginsenosides in multiple ways: (1) Rd, Rb1, PF 11, and
  Rg1 promote the expression of TrKB. (2) Rg1 and Rd increase the expression of MEK1/2
  and PI3K, respectively. (3) Rg1 activates ERK, PKA, CREB, and CaMKII. (3) Rd, Rb1,
  Rg1, Rg3, Rg5, F1, and PF11 can promote both CREB and BDNF. All ginsenosides play
  a positive role in stimulating key factors in CREB/BDNF pathway to further improve
  synaptic plasticity and decrease Aβ deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation.'
