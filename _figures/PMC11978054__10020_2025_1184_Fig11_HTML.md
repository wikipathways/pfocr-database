caption: The impact of hydroxyurea and metformin on γ-globin induction involves complex
  molecular pathways. (a) Upon entering the cell, hydroxyurea enhances the production
  of ROS and activates P38 through modulation of the PKG pathway, subsequently leading
  to activation of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. This ultimately results in the
  downregulation of SP1, which in turn increases IGF2BP1 and decreases GCNT2. Consequently,
  this signaling cascade inhibit the activity of HDAC and DNMT. On the other hand,
  metformin increases the expression of FOXO3. (b) Additionally, KLF1, activated by
  BCL11A, displaces the LCR from the beta gene, leading to the suppression of gamma
  gene expression and a decrease in hemoglobin F production. LIN28 inhibits BCL11A
  and promotes gamma gene expression. The combined effect of hydroxyurea, including
  the activation of HDAC and DNMT1, and the inhibition of BCL11A, leads to chromatin
  remodeling and increased gamma gene expression
