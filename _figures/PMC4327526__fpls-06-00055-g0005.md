caption: LCBs, PA, MAPKs, and ROS in the signaling pathway in response to low temperature
  stress. Stomata closure and cold acclimation are two effects caused by exposure
  to low temperature. In order to reach these responses, some transducers to the cold
  signal have been described as it is illustrated in this figure. In the case of the
  stomata closure, information about a decrease in water availability at the plant
  root due to low temperatures is sensed by the guard cells that close in order to
  avoid water loss. Acclimation, the other response triggered by cold exposure is
  very complex, since it includes metabolic and genetic reprogramming that lead to
  membrane remodeling and synthesis of anti-freezing or crio-protecting molecules.
  As a result, plants later withstand freezing temperatures. Stomata closure requires
  MPK9/12. Since cold stress promotes rapid production of PA through PLDδ activation,
  as well as the joint action of PLC and DGK, it is suggested that these enzymes function
  upstream of an MPK9/MPK12 cascade, as in the case of ABA-induced stomata closure.
  Furthermore, it has been shown that during cold acclimation, there is an increase
  in LCB-Ps upstream of MPK6, which can then regulate ROS accumulation mediated by
  tAPX in the chloroplast. Therefore, the model suggests that MPK6 could be an activator
  of tAPX. DGK, diacylglycerol kinase; LCB, free long-chain base; LCBK2, long-chain
