caption: Dmrt genes integrate sex-specific, spatial, and temporal cues to induce sexually
  dimorphic differentiation in restricted groups of cells. A. In the D. melanogaster
  sex comb, dsx is controlled by the splicing-based sex determination pathway (red),
  the HOX gene Scr and intrasegmental positional cues (green), and presumably by ecdysone
  signaling that regulates the timing of metamorphosis (purple). dsx induces sex comb
  development by controlling cell fate decisions and several distinct morphogenetic
  processes []. B. In C. elegans, dmd-3 and mab-3 are controlled by the sex determination
  pathway (red), by posterior group HOX genes, Wnt signaling and GATA transcription
  factors (green), and by the heterochronic pathway (purple). dmd-3 and mab-3 induce
  male-specific tail differentiation by regulating cell-autonomous morphogenetic processes
  as well as signaling pathways including TGF-β (sma-3) and Rho kinase (vav-1). In
  both organisms, arrows indicate either direct or indirect regulation [,].
