caption: Mode of action of sarilumab according to [98], where IL-6—interleukin-6;
  MIL-6R—membrane-bound interleukin-6 receptor; SIL-6R—soluble interleukin-6 receptor;
  GP130—transmembrane glycol protein 130; JAK—Janus family tyrosine kinases; STAT—signal
  transducers and activators of transcription; SOCS-3—suppressors of cytokine signaling;
  P—phosphoryl group. Sarilumab selectively and strongly binds to a distinct site
  on IL-6R, including both its membrane-bound and soluble forms, effectively inhibiting
  both cis- and transactivation of IL-6 signaling. IL-6 interacts with its receptor
  and functions through both cis- and trans-signaling pathways. The fully functional
  IL-6 receptor consists of membrane-bound IL-6 receptor-α, which is associated with
  IL-6, and the signal-transducing GP130 molecule. In the classical (cis) signaling
  pathway, IL-6 attaches to MIL-6R, leading to the activation of GP130. This activation
  triggers the phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 (tyrosine kinase 2), which
  subsequently stimulate STAT1 and STAT3, ultimately driving the transcription of
  pro-inflammatory molecules. In the trans-signaling pathway, IL-6 binds to soluble
  IL-6R, forming a complex that can activate any cell expressing GP130. Under normal
  physiological conditions, a soluble form of GP130 acts as a regulator, preventing
  IL-6 trans-signaling while allowing cis-signaling to proceed
