caption: Diagram of a simplified alternative BA synthetic pathway and its effect on
  cholesterol metabolism and the importance of oxysterols in lipid metabolism. (A)
  Cholesterol is chaperoned into the mitochondria via STARD1 and CYP27A1 converts
  it to two important bioactive oxysterols, 25OHC and 26OHC. Treatment with the BAs,
  TCDCA and TUDCA, have been associated with higher expression levels of CYP27A1.
  The OHCs are then acted on by CYP7B1 to form dihydroxylated species and ultimately,
  CDCA as the primary product. It is also possible to form CA via CYP8B1 activity
  in this pathway. In CLD such as T2DM and NAFLD/early NASH, the expression of CYP7B1
  is suppressed. Cold temperatures, BA treatment with TCDCA and TUDCA, theobrownin
  and anything which increases insulin sensitivity induces higher expression of CYP7B1.
  Decreased GLP-1 (increased insulin resistance), CA and DCA treatment can increase
  expression of CYP8B1 which has poor patient outcomes. (B) Oxysterols are the first
  products formed in the alternative BA synthetic pathway and are important endogenous
  agonists for LXR. LXR activation leads to upregulation of important enzymes in the
  glycolysis pathway (GK, PK) and also upregulation of enzymes for de novo lipogenesis
  (ATP citrate lyase, ACC, FAS, SCD1). When this pathway becomes overactive as in
  NAFLD, there is increased fat accumulation in the liver leading to NASH. OHC induced
  activation of LXR can also cause an increase in RCT as the transporters, ABCA1 and
  ABCA5/8 are downstream targets of LXR. Activation of LXR also upregulates CYP7A1,
  the regulatory enzyme that governs BA synthesis in the classical pathway. OHCs can
  also directly activate INSIG which then forms a complex with SCAP to block the transcription
  action of SRBEBP-1c. OHCs can also directly activate SRBEBP-1c. BA activation of
  FXR also acts in an antagonistic way towards LXR activation. The endogenously produced
  OHC-3S and the synthetically produced 22(S) OHC are also both antagonists to LXR
  activation. When CYP7B1 is repressed as in insulin resistant metabolic diseases
  such as CLD, then more cholesterol ends up as oxysterols which in overabundance
  can cause lipotoxicity and inflammation in the liver
