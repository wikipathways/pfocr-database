caption: Strategy and mechanism for oncolytic gene therapy. (A); Oncolytic gene therapy
  employs replication-competent virus vectors capable of selective replication in
  target tumor cells. Spreading to new adjacent progeny cells occurs as the host cell
  is lysed and progeny virus is released. (B); Most viruses can replicate poorly in
  normal cells by a defense mechanism as follows. In response to viral infection,
  Protein Kinase R (PKR) in the host cells shut off protein synthesis by which PKR
  dimerizes and is inactivated by autophosphorylation resulting in the conversion
  of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 alpha (EIF-2α) into its inactive state following
  phosphorylation, which is required for translation initiation. Consequently, translation
  is arrested in the infected host cells as an anti-viral protective mechanism. However,
  the ICP34.5 in HSV-1 can overcome this defense by recruiting protein phosphatase-1α
  to dephosphorylate EIF-2α allowing protein synthesis to proceed. Therefore, when
  a deletion of γ34.5 gene is engineered, the HSV-1 mutant can no longer successfully
  proliferate in non-replicating cells. HSV-1 lacking ICP34.5 activity can only infect
  cells with defective PKR pathway. In tumor cells, PKR autophosphorylation is blocked
  due to Ras activation, permitting replication of viruses lacking the γ34.5 gene
  in tumor cells with hyper-activated Ras.
