caption: A detailed schematic of the metabolic pathway essential for the enhanced
  regeneration in ogt-1 animals with the tested genes, metabolite supplementations,
  and pharmacological treatments indicated. As highlighted in green, ogt-1 mutations
  required metabolic pathways apart from glycolysis including one-carbon metabolism
  (OCM), the SPP, the transsulfuration pathway (TSP), and the vitamin B12 independent
  shunt pathway to support enhanced regeneration. Dispensable metabolic branches are
  shown in red. Different genetic manipulations (RNAi and mutants) in respective pathways
  are mentioned at respective places along with methionine and cystathionine metabolites
  supplementation. Details are mentioned in the main manuscript text
