caption: 'Glycolysis pathway and TCA cycle in response to HSAF. The red asterisk indicates
  key pacemaker enzyme for the pathways. The red arrow represents the exergonic reaction.
  One square denotes one gene in related reaction and its color implies the gene’s
  expression level. The asterisks (*) indicate the key reaction. FC (Fold change of
  RPKM (HSAF)/RPKM (CK)), PGI1 (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase), FBA1 (fructose-bisphosphate
  aldolase), FBP1 (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase), TDH1 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase), PGK1 (phosphoglycerate kinase), ENO1 (enolase), PYK1(pyruvate kinase),
  PDA1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component alpha subunit), PDB1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase
  E1 component beta subunit), PDC (pyruvate decarboxylase), CIT1 (citrate synthase),

  metabolites (red fonts), these abbreviations represent: glucose-6-P (glucose 6-phosphate),
