caption: Cycle of frailty combines elements of body composition, nutrition, and mobility
  into a pathophysiologic pathway. In this pathway, sarcopenia and poor muscle strength,
  by limiting mobility and physical activity, reduce total energy expenditure and
  nutritional intake, thereby causing weight loss and further sarcopenia. In defining
  frailty, involvement of musculoskeletal system is central and paramount. Loss of
  movement capacity frequently accelerates decline in other organ systems. From J
