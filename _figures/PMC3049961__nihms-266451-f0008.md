caption: Pathway Studio 6 was used to construct a pathway from all phosphoproteins
  that had a higher signal in ΔEGFR vs ΔEGFR-ki and a p<0.05 in statistical analysis
  (red). The mammalian database was used with protein modification being the only
  parameter used to connect different protein nodes. Pathway Studio added several
  intermediate nodes (yellow) to complete the pathway. For more information on the
  proteins shown in this analysis and their relationship see Supplemental Data, Tables  and
  .
