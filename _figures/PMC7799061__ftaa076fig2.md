caption: Mechanistic basis of proposed COVID-19 immunopathogenesis in humans. Notwithstanding
  the proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 disease warrants an extensive global population
  screening, some studies have estimated that ∼80% of individuals, diagnosed with
  the SARS-CoV-2 remain sub-clinical. Despite being an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 can activate
  the STING pathway (Fischer, Tschachler and Eckhart ) to induce cytokine storm syndrome,
  also fueled by NLRP3 inflammasome activation and production of IL-1β, and IL-18,
  besides TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-6 to deteriorate disease severity. A Chinese study has
  shown that asymptomatic individuals displayed an extended median duration of 19
  days of viral shedding compared to symptomatic patients portraying the role of asymptomatic/subclinical
  disease status with the exponential upsurge in global COVID-19 cases (Long et al.
  ).
