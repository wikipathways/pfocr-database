caption: When a DNA single-strand break (SSB) happens, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
  (PARP) guides SSB repair through NAD+poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) of histones
  and chromatin remodeling enzymes. PARP inhibitors (PARPis) act mainly by trapping
  PARP and by inhibiting PARylation. Unrepaired SSB leads to DNA double-strand break
  (DSB) during DNA replication. DSB is mainly resolved by homologous recombination
  repair (HRR) during the G2/S phase of cell cycle. During G1/G2 and in HRR deficient
  cells, DSB is solved by the error-prone non-homologous end-joining pathway with
  consequent genomic instability and cell death. HRR is activated by the recognition
  of DSB by the MRN complex that resects DNA ends, leading to the formation of single-strand
  DNA (ssDNA). ssDNA is preserved from degradation by RPA. The MRN complex activates
  ATM and that with RPA contributes to ATR activation. ATM and ATR phosphorylate several
  proteins such as CHEK1/2. ATM, ATR, and CHEK1/2 mediate cell cycle arrest. FANCD2
  contributes to BRCA1 activation once monoubiquitinated by FANC and phosphorylated
  by ATM. BRCA1-BARD1 complex facilitates DNA end resection and interacts with the
  bridging protein PALB2 phosphorylated by CHEK2. PALB2 recruits BRCA2. PALB2 and
  BRCA2 remove RPA and facilitate the assembly of RAD51. RAD51 and RAD51 paralogs
  mediate strand invasion of ssDNA into the intact sister chromatid, searching a homologous
  template for DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase (DNA pol). DNA repair process interacts
  with androgen receptor (AR) pathway. CYP17A1 is a key enzyme for testosterone synthesis
  from cholesterol. Testosterone is metabolized to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by
  5α-reductase. DHT exerts its biological effects by binding AR in the cytoplasm.
  A rapid non-genomic signaling pathway contributes to cell proliferation by activation
  of MAPR/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. In addition, once it has bound the ligand, AR
  homodimerizes and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to the androgen
  response element (ARE) located at the promoter regions of genes involved in DNA
  damage repair, cell proliferation and apoptosis evasion. PARP plays also a role
  in androgen-dependent transcription. Drugs currently used in clinical practice alone
  or in combination with PARPis for the treatment of prostate cancer are labelled
  in red. Abiraterone is a CYP17A1 inhibitor. Enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide
  competitively inhibit DHT binding to the AR, nuclear translocation of the AR, and
  DNA binding. Docetaxel and cabazitaxel inhibit AR nuclear translocation by targeting
  AR association with microtubules. Drugs that are currently being explored in combination
  with PARPis are labelled in blue
