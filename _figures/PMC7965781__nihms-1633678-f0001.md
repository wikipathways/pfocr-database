caption: The ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway (see text for details). Light yellow
  circles mark the modification sites in each reaction. The Black Box reactions are
  marked by light grey background. Red question marks indicate the catalyzing enzymes
  are unknown. “A” and “B” presents the two alternative ways in which Δ4-diketol is
  transformed into 5β-ketodiol. The post-Black Box reactions in Drosophila and Manduca
  are marked by light green and light orange background, respectively.
