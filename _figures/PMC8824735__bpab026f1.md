caption: the role of CYP17A1 in the steroid biosynthesis pathway; the reactions catalyzed
  by CYP17A1 are shown in bold and black arrows. HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
  CYP17A1 is a bifunctional enzyme that hydroxylates pregnenolone and progesterone
  in 17α positions of the steroid to produce 17α-hydroxypregnenolone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone,
  respectively. CYP17A1 then employed its C17,20-lyase (lyase) functionality to cleave
  17α-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone
  to androstenedione. DHEA and androstenedione yield testosterone. Furthermore, testosterone
  can be converted into potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the prostate.
  There is a notable production of androgen in prostate tumors of PCa patients [,
  ]. Therefore, CYP17A1 lyase represents the rate-limiting step in androgen biosynthesis
  and a critical therapeutic target in CRPC treatment.
