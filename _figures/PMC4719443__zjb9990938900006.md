caption: Model predicting GrvA-dependent regulation of acid resistance and LEE-dependent
  adherence. During exponential-phase growth, GrvA represses acid resistance (GDAR)
  and activates LEE-dependent adherence. This requires the negative regulation of
  gadW by GrvA. As GadW is a direct activator of gadE, the central regulator of GDAR,
  its repression by GrvA downregulates GDAR gene expression (gadE, gadA, gadBC) and
  acid resistance. GadE also directly represses the LEE-encoded regulator ler, the
  product of which activates the LEE (5 operons encoding the T3S, other regulators,
  and toxic effectors). The repression of GadW/GadE by GrvA leads to activation of
  the LEE and LEE-dependent adherence. Bicarbonate in the intestine is hypothesized
  to stimulate GrvA-dependent control of GDAR and the LEE in a manner requiring the
  Rcs phosphorelay system. RcsB activates GDAR as a heterodimer with GadE. The role
  for GrvB in this regulatory pathway is unknown. GrvA regulates the expression of
  >700 genes in EHEC O157:H7 strain TW14359. The model is inferred from the results
  of experiments performed in this and previous studies (, , , , ). See the text for
  further details. GDAR, glutamate-dependent acid resistance; LEE, locus of enterocyte
  effacement.
