caption: The plastoquinone and α-tocopherol biosynthetic  pathway in higher plants.
  For clarity, not all biosynthetic steps are  shown and only the HPPDase reaction
  is shown in detail. The  CO2 lost and molecular oxygen introduced by HPPDase are  indicated
  with a larger font and asterisks, respectively. The  conjugated rings of HPP and
  HGA are numbered to indicate rearrangement  of the side chain. The locations of
  the pds1 and  pds2 mutations in the pathway are indicated.
