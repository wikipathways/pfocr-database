caption: Summary diagram showing the core pathway of Pro metabolism in relation to
  lipid, cuticle, and redox-related genes found to affect Pro accumulation. Multiple
  genes and pharmacological treatments disrupting lipid metabolism or NADPH oxidase
  activity were found to affect Pro accumulation and PDH1pro:LUC2 expression. This
  included CYP86A2 and LACS2 identified in the PDH1pro:LUC2 forward genetic screen;
  CYP86A4, CED1, MYB16, and MYB106 identified by reverse genetics; CAC3 and KCS genes
  identified by p5cs1-4 RNA sequencing; as well as strong effects of the NADPH oxidase
  inhibitor . The reactions catalyzed by these proteins are spread across several
  compartments, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER), chloroplast, and plasma membrane
  (PM). The commonality among these pathways and Pro metabolism itself is an effect
  on redox status by the consumption of NADPH and the regeneration of NADP+, either
  directly, as for P5CS1, P5CR, LACS2, CYP86A2, and NADPH oxidases, or indirectly
  by modifying the flux through lipid synthesis, as for CAC3, KCS, CED1, MYB16, and
  MYB106. This commonality, along with data obtained with  scavengers and  treatment,
  indicates that redox status is a key factor linking these pathways together. Consistent
  with this, RNA sequencing data showed that p5cs1-4 had substantial alterations in
  gene expression-related chloroplast and mitochondrial redox metabolism, further
  indicating the relationship of Pro to redox status. The similar effects of p5cs1-4
  on gene expression at both high and low ψw indicated the importance of Pro metabolism,
  and likely a high rate of flux through the Pro cycle of synthesis and catabolism,
  even in unstressed plants where Pro level is low. P5CS1 is drawn in its own box
  to indicate that its subcellular localization is unclear. How changes in redox state
  are communicated between these subcellular compartments is unknown.
