caption: 'A proposed signalling pathway for GS-evoked pruritus. The highly accumulated
  GS in the epidermis of patients with AD will activate the peripheral sensory neuron
  to induce pruritus in the following way: (1) GS activates 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2A)
  with subsequent stimulation of PLC via Gαq/11 and Gβγ complex, which in turn breaks
  down phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol triphosphate (IP3)
  and diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG will then activate phosphokinase C (PKC), which leads
  to sensitization of TRPV4. (2) Activation of the sensitized TRPV4 can be directly
  facilitated by GS, which will allow a massive influx of cations from the extracellular
  regions, increasing a chance to induce depolarization and possibly an action potential.
  This GS-induced electrical signal produced in the peripheral sensory neuron will
  be further transmitted through the spinal cord and to the brain, where the signal
  can finally be perceived as pruritus'
