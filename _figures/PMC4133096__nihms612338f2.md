caption: Role of 53BP1 during the cell cycle. 53BP1 mediates the recruitment of factors
  in the cell cycle G1 phase that play a role in NHEJ, V(D)J and CSR. During S phase
  after exposure to DNA damaging agents, ATM/MOF-dependent phosphorylated 53BP1 interacts
  with RIF1, which is critical for intra-S-phase checkpoint activation. Release of
  53BP1 from DNA DSB sites allows BRCA1 during S/G2 phase recruitment of the HR-related
  proteins required for DNA end resection.
