caption: Pathways of glucose metabolism and 14C-tracers used in quantitative metabolism.
  The main pathway of ATP generation from glucose in the brain, especially in neurons,
  depends on oxidative phosphorylation in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In astrocytes,
  however, glycolysis dominates, and glucose flux into its shunt pathway, the pentose-phosphate
  pathway (PPP), is five to seven times higher than in neurons. The PPP plays an important
  role in generating a reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (NADPH) from the oxidized form (NADP+). Although the oxidation of [14C] lactate
  or [14C] pyruvate and the production of 14CO2 is much lower (1/6–1/4) in astroglia
  than in neurons, astroglial [14C] glutamate oxidation is much higher, suggesting
  normal mitochondrial function.
