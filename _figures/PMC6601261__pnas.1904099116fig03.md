caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for R. gnavus glucorhamnan (A) A gene cluster
  (RUMGNA_03512 to RUMGNA_03534) encoding five glycosyltransferases and the biosynthetic
  enzyme for rhamnose is likely responsible for glucorhamnan synthesis. Five genes
  (designated by *) were transcribed during culture conditions (SI Appendix, Fig.
  S11). (B) A proposal for the biosynthesis of the glucorhamnan. Sequentially, monosaccharide
  precursors are synthesized, assembled into the repeating unit, transported across
  the membrane, where they are polymerized to form the full-length glucorhamnan, which
  is then covalently attached to the peptidoglycan.
