caption: Metabolic pathways of selected AGE and their inhibitors. Advanced glycation
  end-products (AGE) are formed via non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins. Glycation
  initially occurs when the aldehyde or ketone groups of reducing sugars react reversibly
  with an amino group as found in lysine, forming a Schiff base. Rearrangement of
  the Schiff base yields a more stable ketoamine (Amadori product), in which the free
  carbonyl may react with an arginine free amino group to form pentosidine. Oxidation
  of glycolipids, glucose, Schiff base or Amadori products yields highly reactive
  carbonyl intermediates (e.g., glyoxal, methyl-glyoxal, 3-deoxy-glucosone) that react
  with a free amino group, forming various AGEs (CEL, CML, pentosidine, pyrraline,
  imidazolone). Aminoguanidine, guanidine, metformin, pyridoxamine, and ALT-711 inhibit
  AGE formation.
