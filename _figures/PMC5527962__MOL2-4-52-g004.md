caption: Cell adhesion pathway and ECM–receptor interaction pathways are affected
  by RCT. The signalling pathways for cell adhesion and ECM–receptor interaction,
  generated with KEGG comparing non‐radiated rectal tumour samples with radiated rectal
  tumour samples, is shown. Each bar (blue or red) represents a gene. Red bars indicate
  an increase in irradiated rectal tumour gene expression as compared to non‐irradiated
  rectal tumour samples. Blue bars indicate a decrease. Bar height is inversely related
  to p‐value; a larger bar represents a smaller p‐value up to a maximum height at
  p‐value less then 10−8.
