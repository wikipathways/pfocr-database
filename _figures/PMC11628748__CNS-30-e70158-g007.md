caption: The anti‐inflammatory and neuroprotective mechanisms of the novel drug LIGc
  in models of neuroinflammation and cerebral ischemic injury involve its ability
  to downregulate the expression of the FPR1/NLRP3 signaling pathway in microglia/macrophages.
  This regulation facilitates the transformation of these cells into an anti‐inflammatory
  phenotype, leading to inhibition of pro‐inflammatory factor release and promotion
  of anti‐inflammatory factor production
