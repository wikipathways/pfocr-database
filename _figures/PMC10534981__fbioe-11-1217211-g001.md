caption: The NOTCH signaling pathway occurs upon the interaction of JAG1 with the
  NOTCH receptor. This causes γ-secretase to cleave the NIC, which moves to the nucleus,
  leading to the initiation of transcription of NOTCH target genes such as Hes1 and
  Hey1. This is known as the canonical NOTCH pathway. Target genes are present even
  after inhibiting γ-secretase. This is known as the non-canonical NOTCH. Created
