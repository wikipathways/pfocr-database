caption: 'Pathway Studio® (Ariadne Genomics) was used to identify known relationships
  among human homologues of the genes identified as differentially regulated by ANOVA.
  Blue indicates a down-regulation in the gene and red indicates an induction in gene
  expression. In panel A, all direct relationships were identified between any two
  differentially regulated transcripts (p<0.01). In panel B, the shortest known connections
  were identified between any two transcripts from the enlarged clusters from  (i.e.
  transcripts regulated in a fashion similar to ERα or AR). Symbols include  transcription
  factors,  nuclear receptors,  kinases,  phosphatases,  membrane receptors and  ligands.
  Abbreviations follow mammalian nomenclature rules (all letters capitalized) because
  these pathways are primarily based upon mammalian literature: ABL1, c-abl oncogene
