caption: FOCM. One-carbon metabolism is required for the synthesis of purines, dTMP,
  and methionine. The hydroxymethyl group of serine is a major source of 1C units,
  which are generated in the mitochondria in the form of formate via SHMT2 or in the
  cytoplasm through the activity of SHMT1 or SHMT2α. Mitochondria-derived formate
  can enter the cytoplasm and function as a one-carbon unit for folate metabolism.
  The synthesis of dTMP occurs in the nucleus and mitochondria. At S phase, the enzymes
  of the dTMP synthesis pathway undergo SUMO-dependent translocation to the nucleus.
  The remethylation of homocysteine to methionine by methionine synthase (MTR) requires
  vitamin B12. The one carbon is labeled in boldface type. The inset shows the thymidylate
  synthesis cycle, which involves the enzymes SHMT1, SHMT2α, TYMS, and DHFR. MTHFR,
  methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; MTHFD1, methylene THF dehydrogenase; GAR Tfase,
  glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase; AICAR Tfase, aminoimidazolecarboxamide
  ribonucleotide transformylase; GCS, glycine cleavage system.
