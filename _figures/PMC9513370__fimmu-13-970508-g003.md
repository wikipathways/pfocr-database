caption: 'Inhibitory cytokines and metabolic enzymes involved in DC-Treg cell crosstalk.
  From the perspective of cytokines, both DCs and Tregs can secrete inhibitory cytokines
  IL-10/IL-35/TGF-β and form inhibitory feedback mechanisms: DCs promote the generation
  of different subtypes of Tregs, and Tregs inhibit the maturity and antigen presentation
  ability of DCs and improve their tolerance. From the perspective of metabolic enzymes,
  Tregs can induce IDO expression in DCs with the help of signals axes, such as CTLA-4-CD80/86,
  initiate the tryptophan metabolic pathway, trigger the generation of IDO-dependent
  Tregs, and form a negative feedback loop with IDO at the core. There is also unidirectional
  regulation of Tregs by DCs: DCs influence Treg generation by secreting IL-27, and
  IL-12/IL-6/TNF-α inhibits Treg cell proliferation. TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β;
  IFN- γ, Interferon- γ; IDO1, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1; + p, phosphorylation;
  P-IDO1, phosphorylated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1; Trp, tryptophan; Kyn, kynurenine;
  AHR, aromatic hydrocarbon receptor.'
