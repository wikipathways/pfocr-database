caption: (A) The top ten KEGG pathway analysis enriched in circRNAs. (B) Insulin signaling
  pathway. (C) Endometrial cancer. (D) Hippo signaling pathway, insulin signaling
  pathway, endometrial cancer. Hippo signaling pathways regulated by the up-regulated
  circRNAs in NK/T-LAHS. The KEGG analysis revealed 21 signaling pathways related
  to the 114 up-regulated circRNAs in patients with NK/T-LAHS. (B) Insulin signaling
  pathway, (C) endometrial cancer pathway, and (D) Hippo signaling pathways were connected
  with expression of GSK-3β, which played a crucial role in pathogenesis of NK/T-LAHS.
