caption: 'A) Classical IL-17 producing subsets: IL-17+ innate immune cells in steady
  state are γδ T cells, type three innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) cells (including Lymphoid
  tissue inducer cells, lymphoid tissue inducer like cells and CCR6+ cells) and invariant
  NK T cells (iNKT) cells. Adaptive immune cells that include CD4+ T cells (TH17)
  and CD8+ T cells (Tc17) produce IL-17 upon engagement with their cognate antigen
  under inflammatory conditions. Antigen independent CD4+ IL-17+ cells have also been
  described and are known as “natural occurring” TH17 or nTH17. All these innate and
  adaptive immune cell subsets are dependent on the expression of the transcription
  factor RORγt for the stable production of IL-17. B) IL-17 cytokines and subunit
  receptors family: IL-17 family members share different percentage of sequence homology
  and are named from A to F. They signal through protein complexes formed by two or
  more IL-17 receptor subunits named from IL-17RA to IL-17RE. The particular affinity
  of each cytokine for its receptors and the different IL-17R expression patterns
  define overlapping or unique effector function for each IL-17 family member depending
  on the tissue/cell type. C) Intracellular IL-17R signaling and effector mechanisms.
  Upon IL-17RA binding, IL-17 induces the consecutive recruitment of ACT1 to the SEFIR
  intracellular domain, and TRAF6 to the ACT1-SEFIR. This process is critical for
  NF-κB activation and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Another pathway activated
  by IL-17 signaling is MAPK pathway (ERK, JNK and p38) and stimulation of C/EBP β,δ.
  Also, one of the most important effects of IL-17 signaling is the stabilization
  of mRNA transcripts encoding IL-17 target genes through TRAF2/5 molecular adaptors.
  IL-17 target genes include antimicrobial peptides, chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines
  and matrix metalloproteinases that drive host immunity against extracellular and
  intracellular bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. Deregulation of these proinflammatory
  mediators may give rise to chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. Created with Biorender.com'
