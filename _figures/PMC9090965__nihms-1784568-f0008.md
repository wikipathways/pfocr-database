caption: Proposed metabolic pathway of 4,8-dimethylnonanoyl-CoA, the CoA ester of
  dMC9. LCAD, and/or MCAD, catalyzes the first α,β-dehydrogenation of 4,8-dimethylnonanoyl-CoA
  in this pathway and medium chain TFP is hypothesized to catalyze the next three
  reactions. 2,6-Dimethylheptanoyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA are produced in this first β-oxidation
  cycle with the former using LCAD to start another β-oxidation cycle that continues
  to produce propionyl-CoA and isocaproyl-CoA as end products for additional metabolism
  by other pathways. Isocaproyl-CoA is hypothesized to be further oxidized by branched
  chain amino acid metabolism enzymes to release one acetyl-CoA and one propionyl-CoA.
  Reducing equivalents expected from the above pathways are five NADH+ and three FADH2.
  This is in addition of two acetyl-CoAs and two succinyl-CoAs that are the anaplerotic
  contribution to the TCA cycle
