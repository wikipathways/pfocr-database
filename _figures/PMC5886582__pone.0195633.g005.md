caption: A schematic illustration of significant gene expression changes for the genetically
  engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae NRRL Y-50463 compared with its parental wild
  type industrial yeast strain NRRL Y-12632 for endogenous genes involved in glycolysis,
  pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle at 24 h using xylose as the sole source
  of carbon when glucose was depleted. Arrows on the left and the top from the parallel
  lines represent aerobic growth condition and those on the right side or at the bottom
  represent oxygen-limited fermentation condition. Blue or green colored arrows indicate
  significantly greater gene expression for aerobic and oxygen-limited condition,
  respectively. Arrows in red indicate repressed expression and arrows in black indicate
  gene expression at normal or nearly normal levels. Elements of the signature expression
  for strain NRRL Y-50463 were boxed in varied colors and marked as I, II and III,
  respectively.
