caption: (1) CSFV nonstructural protein NS5B hijacks HRD1 to inhibit its ubiquitination
  modification of METTL14. (2) During CSFV infection, upregulated METTL14 mediates
  the m6A modification in TLR4 mRNA and (3) recruits YTHDF2 that recognizes and affects
  the modified TLR4 mRNA decay, ultimately leading to a reduction in TLR4 protein
  expression, (4) followed by the inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway
