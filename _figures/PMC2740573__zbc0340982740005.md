caption: A model of the serine proteases cascades regulating the Toll pathway in Tenebrio.
  When the β-1,3-glucan of fungi is exposed to the insect, Tenebrio GNBP3 binds to
  β-1,3-glucan and then recruits pro-MSP. In the presence of Ca2+, the β-1,3-glucan/GNBP3
  complex induces activation of pro-MSP to activated MSP (aMSP). The aMSP converts
  pro-SAE to activated SAE (aSAE), which subsequently converts the pro-SPE to activated
  SPE (aSPE). The aSPE cleaves pro-Spätzle to processed Spätzle leading to the production
  of AMPs such as Tenecin 1 and Tenecin 2 via the Toll receptor. The Lys-type PG-dependent
  Tenebrio Toll signaling pathway was previously reported by our group ().
