caption: Immune regulatory checkpoints in cancer immunotherapy. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated
  antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) are two well-described
  co-inhibitory molecules that are expressed on naïve or memory T cells and decrease
  antitumor immune responses. The CTLA-4-mediated immune checkpoint is induced in
  T cells at the initial response to antigen (early activation phase). After the T
  cell receptor (TCR) is triggered by antigen encounter, CTLA-4 is transported to
  the surface of naïve or memory T cells. In contrast, the major role of the PD1 pathway
  is not at the initial T cell activation stage but rather the regulation of inflammatory
  responses by effector T cells that recognize antigen in peripheral tissue cells.
  Thus, PD-1 is highly expressed by antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)
  in malignancies and is associated with impaired T-cell function. The best-characterized
  signal for PD1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) induction is interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which is predominantly
  produced by Th1 cells. Although PD-L2 expression is limited to dendritic cells (DCs)
  and macrophages, PD-L1 is broadly expressed in tissues and is considered a molecular
  shield that protects cells from auto-reactive attack. In some tumors, PDL1 is not
  constitutively expressed but is induced in response to inflammatory signals that
  are produced by an active antitumor immune response. Loading DCs with soluble PD1
  decreases their function. Therefore, antibodies can be used to block inhibitory
  ligand:receptor interactions by acting on tumor cells, DCs (e.g., anti-PD-L1) or
  T cells (e.g., anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD1). Combining the blockade of multiple inhibitory
  pathways synergistically decreases T cell anergy and improves T cell responsiveness
  against tumors.
