caption: 'Causal concept of NSAID-triggered eicosanoid imbalance for in vitro diagnosis
  of AERD. The causal concept of NSAID-trigger eicosanoid imbalance for in vitro diagnosis
  of AERD is best allegorised as a tray balancing all parameters (which might be relevant
  for the pathway) on a needle. Disease-free individuals: housekeeping PGE2 balances
  synthesis of pLT (e.g., by induction of endogenous cAMP, which inhibits synthesis
  of pLT); expression of enzymes or receptors are unremarkable (A1). Upon exposure
  to NSAIDs the PGE2 level is diminished but remains high enough ensuring “uncritical”
  levels of pLT (even though cAMP might by diminished); expression of enzymes and/or
  receptors are not modified (A2). Patients with AERD: synthesis of housekeeping PGE2
  is diminished, but still balances synthesis of pLT (e.g., by reduced endogenous
  cAMP); expression of enzymes (up regulation of LTC4-synthase) or receptors (up regulation
  of cysLT) can be mutated in some cases (B1). Exposure to NSAIDs/aspirin blocks the
  COX-pathway causing reduced synthesis of PGE2 (and consequently further reduced
  cAMP level), and consequently the metabolism of arachidonic acid is shifted to the
  5LO-pathway provoking elevated synthesis of pLT; expression of enzymes and/or receptors
  may by altered, but not modified by NSAIDs (B2).'
