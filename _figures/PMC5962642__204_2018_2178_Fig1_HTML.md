  cloning technology is used to maintain endogenously regulated reporter protein levels
  and regulation. Monoclonal reporter selection from a high number of clones to ensure
  endogenous response to positive control stimuli and suitability of reporter for
  imaging. Middle panel high content live cell screen of 123 compounds at 1, 5, 10,
  50 and 100 C-max at 2 or 3 replicates. Right panel image and data analysis is performed
  with CellProfiler/Fiji and R, respectively. In-house tools were developed in CellProfiler
  and R to assist in the quality and analysis of the large data output
