caption: 'The figures show the metabolism and role of biotin, cobalamin, and pyridoxine
  in various pathways.  depicts the biotin-biotinidase cycle.  illustrates the pathway
  for the metabolism of tyrosine and tryptophan, and the role of aromatic amino acid
  decarboxylase and its cofactor vitamin B6.  highlights the metabolism of cobalamin
  to its to active forms: methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin and their role in
  methylation of homocysteine to methionine and conversion of methyl-malonyl-CoA to
  succinyl-CoA'
