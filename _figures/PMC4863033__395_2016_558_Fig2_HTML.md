caption: Reperfusion Injury Salvage Kinase (RISK) and Survivor Activating Factor Enhancement
  (SAFE) pathway model of ischaemic conditioning. The acute ischaemic stress of non-injurious
  ischaemia leads to the release of multiple stress-inducible factors that may activate
  through G-protein coupled receptors (GCPR) or receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) to
  induce the RISK cascade, or through inflammatory cytokines via the glycoprotein
  130 (gp130) or tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) to activate the SAFE pathway.
  The resulting signalling cascade then impacts upon mitochondria, potentially inhibiting
  the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and other mitochondrial proteins
  such as connexin-43 (Cx43), or via the nucleus to induce, through promotors, new
  protein synthesis. PI3K (Phosphoinositide 3-kinase), Akt [Serine/threonine kinase
  (protein kinase B)], eNOS (Endothelial nitric oxide synthase), ERK (Extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases), JAK (Janus Kinase), MEK (Mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase), NO (Nitric oxide), p70S6K (p70 S6 ribosomal protein kinase), PKC (Protein
  Kinase C), Ras/Raf (small GTPase proteins), STAT (Signal transducer and activator
  of transcription)
