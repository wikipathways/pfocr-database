caption: Schematic illustration of TGF-β signaling pathway members and potential pathway
  member LRG1. TGF-β pathway comprises the canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways.
  miR-335 regulates cell migration and invasion through targeting of the three branches
  of the non-canonical TGF-β pathway. In this study, miR-335 has been demonstrated
  to directly target ROCK1, MAPK1 and putative TGF-β member LRG1. miR-335 inhibition
  of ROCK1 prevents phosphorylation of MLC thereby reducing actomyosin assembly and
  contraction and ultimately the motile potential of the cells. Similarly, inhibition
  of MAPK1 signaling also prevents phosphorylation of MLC.
