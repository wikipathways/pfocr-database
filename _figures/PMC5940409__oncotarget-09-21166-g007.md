caption: Metformin blocks mitochondrial complex I leading to activation of AMPK via
  reduction in ATP production. This in turn, leads to activation and inactivation
  of several pathways dependent on AMPK. Only some of the relevant molecules are shown.
  In addition, metformin blocks or activates several pathways independent of AMPK.
  Some of them include inactivating PI3K/AKT pathway, activating DNA damage response
  (ATM/Chk2 and p53) pathways, inhibiting Rag-GTPases that activate mTOR. Venetoclax,
  a bcl-2 inhibitor is potentiated by metformin likely via it's role in blocking Stat3
  pathway independent of AMPK and BAY-1143572 is likely potentiated by metformin via
  it's role in reducing cyclin D1 independent of AMPK. Though, involvement of other
  pathways in the potentiation of these drugs can't be ignored. All these signaling
  changes with metformin treatment eventually lead to increase in apoptosis-mediated
  cell death and reduction in cell proliferation of lymphoma cells. However, it should
  be noted that depending on the lymphoma cell type, some of these pathways may be
  more active and some pathways may be missing or dysregulated altogether.
