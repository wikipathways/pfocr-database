caption: Role of BRCA1 in DNA double-strand break repair. Homology-directed repair
  or homologous recombination is an error-free repair pathway of DNA double-strand
  breaks (DSBs), which occurs primarily during S/G2 cell cycle phases. ATM is a serine/threonine
  protein kinase that is recruited to and activated at the DNA damage sites by the
  MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 (MRN) complex. Upon activation, ATM phosphorylates a large
  number of substrates to promote DNA repair. DNA end resection is the initial step
  in determining the DSB repair choice and is controlled by BRCA1, MRN, and CtIP.
  The replication protein A (RPA) binds to single-stranded DNA after the end resection.
  BRCA1 promotes the recruitment of PALB2 and BRCA2 at DNA-damage sites, and the interaction
  between BRCA1 and PALB2 is important for the HR repair pathway. BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2
  complex leads to the formation of RAD51 filaments on the 3’ single-stranded DNA,
  followed by the strand invasion into a homologous DNA, initiating the formation
  of displacement loops (D-Loops), which leads to the resolution of DSBs. Created
