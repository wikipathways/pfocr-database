caption: 'Cilia fall into two broad classes: motile and non-motile. Motile cilia beat
  with a wave-like motion to either propel cells, such as sperm and protozoa, or generate
  flow over the cell surface. Conversely, a non-motile primary cilium is present on
  almost every cell type in the human body. A widespread view was that primary cilia
  represented nonfunctional vestigial structures. However, landmark discoveries recast
  primary cilia as the ‘signaling antenna’ of the cell [–]. For example, mutations
  causing polycystic kidney disease were linked to an IFT subunit (IFT88) and a shortened
  cilia phenotype, supporting a sensory role for kidney primary cilia []. Hedgehog
  signaling, an important pathway for embryonic patterning, was found to depend on
  IFT proteins in mice [] and involve dynamic localization of the receptor Smoothened
  to and from the ciliary membrane []. Other signaling components, involved in processes
  as diverse as sight, smell, taste, and appetite control, localize within cilia [].
  Moreover, receptor-containing ectosomes have recently been found to be secreted
  from the tip of the cilium to modulate signaling [–]. The core of all cilia is the
  axoneme, a cylindrical array of typically nine microtubule doublets that extends
  from the basal body. Motile axonemes normally also have a central pair of microtubules,
  as well as periodic arrays of axonemal dyneins and regulatory complexes that co-ordinate
  ciliary beating []. The axoneme is covered by a ciliary membrane that is continuous
  with the plasma membrane but distinct in protein and lipid content. During ciliary
  growth and maintenance, new subunits are incorporated at the ciliary tip, where
  the microtubule plus ends (+) reside. A diffusion barrier separates the ciliary
  volume and the cytoplasm [,]. This selective barrier involves the ‘transition zone’,
  a region immediately distal to the basal body characterized by Y-shaped links between
  the doublets and the ciliary membrane. Anterograde IFT, powered by kinesin-II motors,
  moves cargoes synthesized in the cytoplasm through the transition zone and toward
  the tip of the cilium. Conversely, dynein-2 returns cargoes to the cell body. Both
  motors associate with IFT trains, polymeric arrays involving two sub-complexes,
  IFT-A and IFT-B (consisting of IFT-B1 and IFT-B2) [,]. Genetically, IFT-B proteins
  tend to be critical for anterograde IFT and ciliogenesis, while IFT-A proteins are
  typically linked with retrograde IFT. However, the functions of IFT-A and -B are
  not so simply separated, as IFT-B proteins can be involved in cargo export, while
  IFT-A proteins are required for ciliary entry of a subset of membrane proteins via
  the adaptor protein TULP3 []. Structurally, dynein-2 comprises a tail domain and
  a motor domain containing the linker, a ring of six AAA+ modules (1–6), a coiled-coil
  stalk with the MTBD at its tip, a shorter coiled-coil strut/buttress, and a C-terminal
  domain (CTD).'
