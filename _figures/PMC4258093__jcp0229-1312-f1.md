caption: PI3K signaling. Activated RTKs activate class I PI3K through direct binding
  or through tyrosine phosphorylation of scaffolding adaptors, such as IRS1, which
  then bind and activate PI3K. PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to generate PIP3 in a reaction
  that can be reversed by PTEN. PDK-1 and PKB bind to PIP3 at the plasma membrane,
  and signal to multiple downstream targets such as SGK3 and S6K and GSK-3, respectively.
  RTK signaling also activates mTORC-2 which phosphorylates PKB. PKB activates mTORC-1
  through phosphorylation of TSC2 within the TCS1–TCS2 complex, which blocks the ability
  of TSC2 to act as a GTP-ase-activating protein for Rheb. Accumulated Rheb-GTP activates
  mTORC-1 which phosphorylates downstream targets such as 4E-BP1.
