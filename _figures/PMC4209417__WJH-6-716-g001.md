caption: 'Insulin-like growth factor receptors and their ligands. The insulin-like
  growth factor (IGF) system is composed of three receptors: IGF-IR, IGF-IIR and insulin
  receptor (IR). IGF-IR is the main receptor of the IGF system. It can bind IGF-I and
  IGF-II with high affinity. IGF-IIR is a negative regulator of the pathway that binds
  IGF-II and promotes IGF-II degradation. Finally, IR mediates insulin signaling.
  Two IR isoforms exist: the adult IR-B isoform that binds insulin and the fetal IR-A
  isoform, that can bind IGF-II in addition to insulin promoting mitogenic signaling.
  The IR-A isoform is commonly overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). IR
  isoforms can form IR-A/IR-B hybrids which behave as IR-A receptors. Moreover, HR-A
  or HR-B hybrid receptors can be formed between IGF-IR and IR-A or IR-B respectively.
  These hybrid receptors lack high affinity binding to insulin and act, similar to
  the IGF-IR receptor, promoting proliferation and survival.'
