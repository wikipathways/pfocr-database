caption: Phosphorylated BAD is critical for the anti-apoptotic effect of multiple
  signaling pathways, while dephosphorylated BAD has a pro-apoptotic effect. Stress,
  EGF, and PI3K can activate independent signaling pathways that phosphorylate BAD.
  Stress, represented by epinephrine (or VIP) can promote the phosphorylation of BAD
  at Ser112 via activation of cAMP and PKA. EGF phosphorylates BAD at Ser112 through
  the Ras/Raf-MEK/ERK-KinaseX pathway and at Ser136 through the Rac-PAK pathway. PI3K
  transmits signals to Ser136 through AKT activation, and AKT can partially regulate
  Ser112. The anti-apoptotic role of the activation of CREB and Mcl-1 induced by stress
  was determined by comparing the predictive power of different models. Multiple drugs
  targeting different signaling pathways were integrated into the model.
