caption: Retrograde signaling during photooxidative stress in chloroplasts. 1O2 along
  with H2O2 have been described as signaling molecules able to modulate gene expression.
  EXECUTER1 (EX1) located at the grana margins has been reported to mediate responses
  to 1O2 production, as well as OXIDATIVE SIGNAL INDUCIBLE1 (OXI1), which mediates
  1O2response in an EX1-independent pathway, possibly through oxylipins. Moreover,
  oxidation products such as β-cyclocitral also are essential to mediate 1O2signaling.
  In contrast, H2O2 is a more stable form of ROS and direct modulation of gene expression
  could be possible, although this molecule also activates retrograde downstream signaling
  through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK3/6) interacting with OXI1, protein
  kinase Pto-interacting1 (PTI1), and PTI4. Continuous lines show pathways and interactions
  already described in the literature, while discontinuous lines are unknown pathways.
