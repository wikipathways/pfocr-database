caption: Summary of the complement system biochemical network. Activation and propagation
  of the alternative pathway are shown in blue, the classical pathway is shown in
  yellow, and the lectin pathway in conjunction with different segments of humoral
  immunity is shown in magenta. The interconnection between all pathways is shown
  in green. The continued propagation terminates in the formation of either fC5b-9
  (soluble MAC) or surface-bound MAC. LP is used as an umbrella term that equates
  to pattern recognition molecules, such as MBL trimers and tetramers, collectin liver
  1 (CL-L1), collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1), heteromeric CL-L1/K1 known as CL-LK, ficolin-1
  (M-ficolin), ficolin-2 (L-ficolin), and ficolin-3 (H-ficolin), MBL-associated serine
  proteases (MASPs)-1, MASP-2, MASP-3, MBL-associated proteins (MAp19 and MAp44).
  Complement proteins that make up the regulatory checkpoints such FH, FHL-1, and
  Vn are shown in red. Activated C1 (C1*) will use C1s* to cleave C4 into C4a and
  nascent C4b (nC4b). Similar to nC3b, nC4b can also covalently attach to nearby cells
  and initiate complement.
