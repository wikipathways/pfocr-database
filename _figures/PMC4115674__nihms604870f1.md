caption: The Ras/MAPK signal transduction pathway. The MAPK signaling pathway of protein
  kinases is critically involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, motility,
  apoptosis, and senescence. The RASopathies are medical genetic syndromes caused
  by mutations in genes that encode components or regulators of the Ras/MAPK pathway
  (indicated by dashed lines). These disorders include neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1),
  Noonan syndrome (NS), Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML), capillary
  malformation–ateriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM), Costello syndrome (CS),
  cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC), and Legius syndrome.
