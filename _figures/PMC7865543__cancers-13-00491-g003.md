caption: 'Signaling pathways involved in regulation of and therapeutic avenues for
  targeting the LOX family. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) regulates LOX family
  expression through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling
  pathway. LOX family induced ECM stiffening causes mechano-activation of mitogen
  activated protein kinase (MAPK) and focal adhesion kinase/proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein
  kinase (FAK/Src) signaling pathways which are also known to upregulate LOX family
  expression, whilst decreasing oxygen diffusion into the tumour resulting in hypoxia.
  Hypoxia stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) and leads to increased
  LOX and LOXL2 transcription through binding the hypoxia response elements in their
  promoters. LOX family members can be inhibited directly with small molecule drugs
  targeting their active sites (1A) or humanized antibodies that may bind directly
  or indirectly (allosterically) to the active sites of individual family members
  (1B). Alternately, LOX family members can be inhibited indirectly through use of
  copper chelators which remove the critical copper cofactor from the lysyl oxidase
  active site (2A), inhibitors of copper trafficking proteins (2B), inhibitors of
  bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) to prevent LOX and LOXL1 proenzyme processing
  and activation (3) or inhibitors of the components of the pathways involved in LOX
  family regulation (4). Abbreviations: Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK),
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), messenger RNA (mRNA).'
