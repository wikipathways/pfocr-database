caption: A. In the mollusk Aplysia, feedforward mechanisms coordinate neuropeptide
  modulation of feeding circuitry. Satiation is signaled by sensory afferents from
  the gut (here symbolized by EN1 and EN2, blue). EN1 signaling is mediated in part
  by the NPY homologue apNPY that modulates many different elements including the
  B20 interneuron to switch from ingestion to egestion modes. A parallel feedforward
  pathway is mediated by EN2 afferents to activate the B18 interneuron (red) which
  also releases apNPY to augment the ingestion-to-egestion switch. Adapted from .B.
  In the mollusk Aplysia, feedforward mechanisms provide neuropeptide-mediated compensation
  in feed circuitry. The allatotropin-related peptide (ATRP) is released centrally
  by the CBI-4 interneuron (blue) shortening protraction duration, but it also increases
  the rate of protraction motorneurons (MN, red). By this feedforward mechanism, MNs
  release ATRP (and another neuropeptide, MM) to increase muscle contraction amplitude
  and so compensate for the effect of a decreased duration.C. In Drosophila, a feedforward
  mechanism is suggested by the arrangement of neuropeptide PDF signals to modulate
  circadian neural circuits. Genetic experiments suggest both the large LNv (blue)
  and the small LNv (red) contribute to coordination of daily locomotor rhythms under
  the influence of light and dark. Pharmacology and expression studies indicate the
  existence of a direct and an indirect (feedforward) PDF pathway to help synchronize
  other pacemakers in the circuit.
