caption: Effect of Notch signal modulation on the bone marrow trilineage progenitor
  (TLP) in the inflammatory context. Conditional inducible transgenic mouse strain
  in which expression of the Cre recombinase is driven by the monocyte marker CX3CR1
  was crossed with either a mouse strain in which Notch receptor 1 intracellular domain
  (NICD1) is overexpressed or a mouse strain in which the transcriptional factor RBP-J
  is deleted upon Cre-mediated recombination. The transgene was activated in vitro,
  by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment of isolated TLPs, from the beginning of
  differentiation. The effects of Notch modulation were assessed by cell proliferation,
  differentiation gene expression, LPS-stimulated activation phenotype and functional
  assays, and the major findings are schematically presented. The clearest effect
  was observed in cells of the osteoclast lineage. Deletion of RBP-J involved in Notch
  canonical signaling enhanced osteoclast progenitor proliferation and osteoclast
  Ctsk differentiation gene expression as well as RANK abundance and TRAP activity,
  whereas NICD1 overexpression had the opposite effects. The macrophage lineage responded
  to RBP-J deletion by upregulation of Il12b differentiation gene expression, without
  significant difference in the activation phenotype. However, both NICD1 overexpression
  and RBP-J deletion enhanced LPS-induced phagocytosis, indicating that other pathways
  beside Notch critically regulate macrophage activity. The Notch pathway seems to
  be less active during dendritic cell commitment from TLP, so Notch modulation did
  not affect dendritic cell proliferation and their activation phenotype but had a
  moderate effect on Cd86 differentiation gene expression. However, in the functional
  assay, mature dendritic cells overexpressing NICD1 showed diminished activation
  markers and a reduced antigen-presenting ability.
