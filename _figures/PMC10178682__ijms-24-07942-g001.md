caption: A simplified picture of cancer metabolism. Glycolysis is a multistage process
  of glucose transformation into pyruvate in the presence of specific enzymes. The
  obtained pyruvate can be further converted to lactic acid (aerobic glycolysis) or
  access the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which leads to its full metabolization
  to CO2. The NADH and FADH2 released during the TCA cycle trigger the electron transport
  chain, which gives rise to oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). It turns out that
  aerobic glycolysis is a prime metabolic pathway to provide energy in cancer cells,
  while pyruvate oxidation is reduced, despite its higher energetic efficiency. Due
  to the high demand for NADH and the TCA cycle intermediates (needed to synthesize
  amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids), cancer cells render glutamine to sustain
  the tricarboxylic acid cycle in a process called glutaminolysis, where glutamine
  is converted to glutamate and further to α-ketoglutarate in the presence of glutaminase
  (GLS), GDH1, and/or other enzymes to, finally, enter the TCA cycle. Created with
