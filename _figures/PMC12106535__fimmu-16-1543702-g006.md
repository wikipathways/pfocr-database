caption: 'Role of the apoptosis-related gene/tumor-associated antigen MUC1 in mesenchymal
  stem cell-mediated treatment of IBD. MSCs significantly upregulate the expression
  of MUC1, which is closely associated with the pathological processes of IBD, by
  preventing disruption of antioxidant defenses, regulating the sensitivity of cell
  ferroptosis, and improving inflammation and extraintestinal manifestations of IBD:
  (A) MUC1 is a tumor-associated antigen that is downregulated in IBD. The presence
  of abnormal forms of MUC1 has a profound impact on the timing and severity of inflammation,
  as well as the progression of certain extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. The
  low-glycosylated and overexpressed MUC1 can attract innate immune system cells,
  including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, immature myeloid DCs, and macrophages, thereby
  promoting acute inflammation. Over time, acute inflammation can evolve into chronic
  inflammation. The presence of abnormal forms of MUC1 can also enhance the carcinogenic
  potential of colon and pancreatic cells. (B) MSCs can secrete various intestinal
  trophic factors and exosomes to inhibit intestinal epithelial cell death. Among
  these, MUC1 may promote regeneration of the epithelial cell barrier by inhibiting
  ferroptosis. MUC1 can upregulate ferroptosis-related genes, such as the glutamate/cystine
  antiporter SLC7A11 and GPX4 in small intestinal crypt epithelial cells while downregulating
  ACSL4 to facilitate epithelial cell growth. (C) MUC1 has an anti-inflammatory effect
  by targeting the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and reducing oxidative stress levels.
