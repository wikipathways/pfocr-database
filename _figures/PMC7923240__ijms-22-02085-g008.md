caption: Putative enzymes involved in the phytoecdysteroids (PEs) biosynthetic pathway.
  (a) Proposed PEs biosynthetic pathway in Microsorum species. Orange, yellow, and
  green boxes represented proteins involved in the MVA, sterol biosynthesis, and 20E
  biosynthetic pathways, respectively. Expression level of individual genes was indicated
  by + sign; < 5 (+), 5–20 (++), 20–50 (+++), >50 (++++) based on average transcripts
  per million (TPM) values, and the highest TPM value for each enzyme was used. (b)
  The heatmap of the TPM distribution of all transcripts involved in the PEs biosynthesis
  was visualized by red and green, indicating up-regulated and down-regulated genes,
  respectively. Detailed information for enzymes identified is provided in .
