caption: ‘Target-centric’ cancer drug discovery (left panel) involves the selection
  of a target gene, and the generation of inhibitors by high throughput screening,
  and lead optimization. These agents may inhibit the target, and cause indirect activation
  of mitochondrial cell death, in vivo, but anticancer activity is often reduced by
  pathway redundancy and compensatory prosurvival signals. Conversely, combinatorial
  engineering of pathway inhibitors, for instance 17-AAG, to target a subcellular
  cancer network, i.e. mitochondria (right panel), generates antagonists that directly
  induce organelle collapse, and enhanced anticancer activity, bypassing compensatory
  survival mechanisms. ΔΨm, mitochondrial membrane potential, PTP, permeability transition
  pore; cyt c, cytochrome c, CypD, cyclophilin D.
