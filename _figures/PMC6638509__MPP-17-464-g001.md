caption: AMPs and cooperative defence responses. The innate immune system of plants
  includes cellular signalling based on hormones and small metabolites, including
  sugars (Bolouri Moghaddam and Van den Ende, ). Classical immunity (black arrows)
  includes the recognition of MAMPs by PRRs, whereas sweet immunity (blue arrows)
  can be activated by changes to the sucrose/hexose ratio (Bolouri Moghaddam and Van
  den Ende, ). Both pathways can elicit an immune response through the MAPK pathway,
  which phosphorylates target proteins and induces the synthesis of antimicrobial
  compounds, although the detailed mechanisms remain unclear (broken arrow). Cross‐talk
  between the hormonal, ROS and sugar‐dependent pathways (bidirectional arrows) can
  modulate the production of AMPs, which, in turn, stimulate the production of ROS
  and NO. ROS can be detoxified in the plant by antioxidants (inhibition arrow). Sugars
  contribute to the modulation or scavenging of ROS via the HXK‐dependent pathway
  (Bolouri‐Moghaddam et al., ), and to the production of NO via cell wall‐derived
  OGs, all of which can converge on the MAPK pathway to activate downstream defence
  genes (Wawer et al., ). ABA, abscisic acid; AMP, antimicrobial peptide; AOs, antioxidants;
