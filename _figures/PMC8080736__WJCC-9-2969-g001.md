caption: 'T cell checkpoints and their inhibitors to induce anti-cancer immunity.
  A: cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) in priming and activation
  of T cell in a lymph node. A T cell normally recognizes a specific tumor antigen,
  which is presented by an antigen presenting cell in the context of a major histocompatibility
  complex molecule in addition to the costimulatory signal B7. CTLA-4 is a negative
  regulator of costimulation that mediates inhibitory signaling into the T cell via
  competitive inhibition of CD28. CTLA-4 pathway to suppress initiation of an immune
  response can be blocked with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies (e.g. ipilimumab); B: Programmed
  cell death 1 (PD-1) in recognition and killing of cancer cell by cytotoxic T cell
  within a tumor. PD-1 is expressed on activated T cell after the triggering of the
  T cell receptor. Engagement of PD-1 with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)
  mediates inhibitory signaling into the cytotoxic T cell. PD-1 pathway to suppress
  antitumor T cell responses can be blocked by anti-PD-1 (e.g. pembrolizumab) or anti-PD-L1
  antibodies (e.g. atezolizumab). CTLA-4: Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein
  4; APC: Antigen presenting cell; I: Inhibitory signaling; PD-1: Programmed cell
  death 1; PD-L1: Programmed cell death ligand 1; TCR: T cell receptor; MHC: Major
  histocompatibility complex; MDSC: Myeloid-derived suppressor cell; M2: M2-polarized
  macrophage.'
