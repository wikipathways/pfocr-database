caption: Schematic of the transcriptional/translational feedback loop. The BMAL1:CLOCK
  heterodimer binds enhancer (E)‐Box elements within regulatory sequences of its target
  genes, such as Per, Cry, Rev‐erb, Ror, Dbp, Tef, Hlf, E4bp4, and clock‐controlled
  genes (CCGs). Upon transcriptional induction of Per and Cry, PER and CRY proteins
  accumulate and dimerize in the cytosol, where they either get degraded by the 26S
  proteasome upon CK1ε/δ‐mediated phosphorylation or from where they migrate to the
  nucleus to inhibit BMAL1:CLOCK transcriptional activity and therefore their own
  transcription. Upon gradual phosphorylation and ubiquitination by FBXL3, they are
  degraded in the nucleus, completing the first feedback loop. The second BMAL1:CLOCK‐dependent
  feedback loop is driven by rhythmic Ror and Rev‐erb transcription. Upon accumulation
  of their respective proteins in the cytosol, ROR and REV‐ERB shuttle to the nucleus
  where they activate/repress Bmal1 transcription via competitive binding to the REV‐ERB/ROR
  response (RRE) element in its regulatory sequences. Additional post‐transcriptional/translational/epigenetic
  modifications mediate robustness of the pathway, thereby establishing cycles of
  around 24 h of rhythmic BMAL1:CLOCK‐mediated transcriptional activation of CCGs.
