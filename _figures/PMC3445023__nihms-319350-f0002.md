caption: a) Projections from the ventral subiculum (VS) to the NAcc and VP normally
  provide tonic inhibition of firing of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. b)
  However, when the VS is activated by glutamate injection, or is overactive as in
  schizophrenia, this leads to disinhibition of the VP-to-VTA pathway, allowing more
  VTA dopamine neurons to fire in response to pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg)
  input. This ultimately increases burst firing in the VTA. This over-responsivity
  in VTA neurons may lend inappropriate salience to stimuli that would otherwise be
  irrelevant, a process that may underlie the development of psychotic delusions and
  ideas of reference.
