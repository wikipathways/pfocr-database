caption: Proposed mechanism of FASN in cancer []. Atg1 (autophagy-related 1), CAV1
  (caveolin-1), FAO (fatty acid oxidation), and TFEB (transcription factor EB). Expression
  and activity of FASN are impacted by EGFR and HER2. Lipid synthesis, PI3K/AKT pathway
  signaling, extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling, and transcription
  of genes involved in lysosome biogenesis are all mediated by FASN. Proliferation
  is accelerated by FASN overexpression.
