caption: The FGF signaling pathway regulates SSC self-renewal during spermatogenesis
  and ERM transcription factor mediates the FGF2 signaling pathway. In addition, MAST4
  interacts with ERM directly and regulates its transcriptional activities. ERM activates
  the transcription of its target genes and coordinates spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal.
  Mast4 KO testes show a loss of maintenance of SSC self-renewal and thus present
  progressive germ cell depletion and an SCO morphology, indicating that MAST4 is
  involved in the FGF2/ERM pathway in SSC self-renewal.
