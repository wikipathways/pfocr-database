caption: 'Fish could catalyze arginine via 3 sets of enzymes: (1) arginine:glycine
  amidinotransferase (AGAT), (2) nitric oxide synthases (NOS; 3 isozymes, namely,
  neuronal NOS [nNOS], endothelial NOS [eNOS?, unsure about its existence in fish],
  and inducible NOS [iNOS]), and (3) arginases (ARG, 2 isozymes, namely, arginase-1
  [ARG-1] and arginase-2 [ARG-2], whereas the existence of arginine decarboxylase
  (ADC) in fish is still unknown. Arginine can activate mTORC1 signaling pathway to
  promote fish protein synthesis, and regulate AMPK signaling pathway to increase
  fish glucose uptake and decrease lipid retention. In addition, arginine can also
  elevate fish disease resistance and immune responses, during which process nitric
  oxide (NO) and polyamines are involved in. mTORC1 = mechanistic Target of Rapamycin
  Complex 1; INS/IGF-1 = insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1; AMPK = adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase.'
