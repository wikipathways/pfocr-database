caption: A synthesis from the literature of known protein interactions in the Wnt
  pathway for significantly differentially expressed genes between lines is shown.
  Orange indicates the gene for the protein was upregulated in the High-Active relative
  to Control mice. Blue identifies canonical Wnt proteins. Lines extending from one
  node toward another indicate the former regulates the latter. Arrows indicate positive
  regulation, whereas terminals (flat, perpendicular ends) indicate negative regulation.
