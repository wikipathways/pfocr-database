caption: Schematic representation of the estrogen biosynthesis pathway from cholesterol
  to estetrol with the enzymes involved. The main synthesis pathway of the most abundant
  estrogens (estradiol, estrone and estriol) is their production from cholesterol
  and through the aromatization of androgens. On the other hand, estetrol is synthesized
  only during pregnancy from estradiol and estriol by fetal liver enzymes 15α and
  16α-hydroxylase and it reaches the maternal circulation through the placenta. Created
