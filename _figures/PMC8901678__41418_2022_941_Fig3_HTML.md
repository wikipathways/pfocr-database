caption: Under iron-deficient conditions (left), the majority of iron is bound to
  transferrin (TF), which binds to the transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) at the cell surface
  followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis, resulting in ferric iron being released
  from TF and reduction to ferrous iron by an lysosomal reductase such as STEAP3.
  The ferrous iron is then transported into the lysosomal membrane by DMT1 and TRPML1/2,
  where it becomes part of the labile iron pool in the cytosol. Labile iron can be
  stored in the iron-storage protein ferritin or used to synthesize heme and iron-sulfur
  clusters in the mitochondria or in the cytosol. Iron can also be exported from the
  cell by the body’s sole iron exporter, ferroportin (FPN). In addition, the IRE/IRP
  system regulates the expression of iron-related proteins such as TFR1, ferritin
  and FPN, upregulating TFR1 and DMT1 expression and downregulating FPN and FTH/FTL
  expression. During iron overload (right), hepcidin expression is upregulated by
  either the canonical bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD pathway or by IL-6-pSTAT3
  inflammatory signaling, which in turn limits iron absorption by increasing FPN degradation.
  In response to excess iron, BMP6, together with HJV, activates type 1 (Alk2/3)and
  type 2 (BMPR2, ACVR2A) BMP serine threonine kinase receptors to phosphorylate R-SMAD
  (receptor-activated SMAD), leading to activation of BMP/SMAD signaling pathway.
  High concentration of TF-Fe2 interact with TFR1, resulting in forming complex of
  TFR2/HJV/HFE to enhance the BMP/SMAD signaling in regulating hepcidin. TMPRSS6 inhibits
  BMP/SMAD signaling by cleaving HJV. The IRP system not only downregulates iron uptake-related
  genes such as TFR1 and DMT1 expression, it also upregulates FPN and FTH/FTL expression.
  IRP2 mediated by SKP1-CUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and NCOA4 are degraded, while IPR1
  works as aconitase to convert citrate to isocitrate due to conformational change.
  RNF217 is a recently identified E3 ligase that regulates the degradation of FPN.
  Non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) enters hepatocytes through metal transporter proteins
  such as SLC39A14, and the increased iron can directly induce ferroptosis. ACVR2A,
