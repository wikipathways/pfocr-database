caption: The depiction of biosynthesis and degradation of phosphatidylcholine. In
  the anabolic pathway, phosphorylation of choline takes place by choline kinase (CK),
  yielding phosphocholine, which is followed by condensation of phosphocholine catalyzed
  by cytidylyltransferase (CT), resulting in the formation of CDP-choline. Later,
  the coupling of phosphatidic acid and CDP-choline by choline-phosphotransferase
  (CPT) results in phosphatidylcholine synthesis. The breakdown of phosphatidylcholine
  results in the formation of lyso-phosphatidylcholine and free fatty acids (FFA)
  in the presence of PLA2. Lyso-PC quickly hydrolyzed to form FFA and glycerophosphocholine
  that form free choline, or phosphocholine through hydrolysis, by the action of alkaline
  phosphatase.
