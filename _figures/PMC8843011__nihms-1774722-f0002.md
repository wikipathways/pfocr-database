caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of bacterial PK-IIs. (A) The general overview of PK-II
  biosynthesis showing four phases and enzymes involved in each phase. Medermycin
  belonging to the BIQ subclass was used as the example compound; (B) Combinations
  of enzymes required for the “immediate tailoring” phase in the biosynthesis of four
  common PK-II core structures. Gene function abbreviations: C9KR — ketoreductases
  for C-9 ketoreduction; AroCycN1-C — bifunctional (didomain) AroCyc enzymes; AroCycN2
  — monofunctional AroCyc enzymes that are members of the SRPBCC superfamily; Cyc1
  — TcmI-like polyketide cyclases; Cyc2 — TcmJ-like polyketide cyclases; Cyc3 — proteins
  that are members of the NTF-2 superfamily; Cyc5 — cyclases that are members of the
  metallo β-lactamase superfamily; C3KR — ketoreductases for C-3 ketoreduction; MOX1
  — PdmH-like monooxygenase;, MOX2 — PdmI-like monooxygenase;, and pen19KR — ketoreductases
  for PEN C-19 ketoreduction., The color codes are showing the reaction sites corresponding
  to each enzyme.'
