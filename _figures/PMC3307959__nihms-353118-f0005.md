caption: Unconventional roles of kinesins in cell signaling. (A, B) Kinesins interfere
  with the normal interaction between nuclear (A) or cytoplasmic (B) signaling molecules.
  (A) The kinesin-4, KIF4, binds to the nuclear protein, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1
  (PARP-1), a DNA-repairing enzyme and transcriptional modulator, and prevents its
  interaction with chromatin remodeling proteins []. Phosphorylation of PARP-1 by
  calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) leads to the release of KIF4, thus allowing
  its interaction with, and inactivation of, the chromatin remodeling proteins. (B)
  The atypical kinesin-11, KIF26A, blocks glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-RET
  signaling by interfering with the interaction between the downstream adaptor proteins,
  SHC and GRB2, thus preventing propagation of the signal, and subsequent activation
  of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and mitogen activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) signaling pathways []. The receptor tyrosine kinase, RET, is shown in the
  active, phosphorylated form (pRET). GFRα1 is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored
  coreceptor. (C) Costal2 (Cos2), a Drosophila kinesin-like protein with disrupted
  ATPase activity participates in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Cos2 acts as scaffolding
  protein for recruiting a complex of three kinases – protein kinase A (PKA), casein
  kinase I (CKI), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) – to their substrate, the
  transcription factor, Cubitus interruptus (Ci). In the absence of Hh signal, the
  transmembrane protein, Smoothened (Smo) is “repressed”, and the three kinases phosphorylate
  Ci, priming it for proteolysis. The generated Ci fragment, Ci75, then translocates
  to the nucleus and acts as repressor of target genes. Activation of the Hh pathway
  “de-represses” Smo, leading to the release of the kinase complex, followed by phosphorylation
  of Cos2 through activation of the Ser/Thr kinase, Fused (Fu). As a consequence,
  the full-length, transcriptionally active Ci155 is released from Cos2, escaping
  proteolysis, and translocates to the nucleus to trigger expression of target genes.
  (D) Kinesin-1 binds – through one of its KLCs - to the amyloid-β precursor protein
  (APP), via the adaptor protein, Fe65, and recruits, via its second KLC, an active
  c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) complex, assembled on the JNK interacting protein-3
  (JIP-3). This leads to phosphorylation of Thr668 of the ER-localized APP, followed
  by its amyloidogenic cleavage. The phosphorylation of APP could be triggered by
  the accumulation of kinesin-1 in the cell body of neurons with disrupted axonal
  transport. Details on the signaling pathways included in this figure are given elsewhere
