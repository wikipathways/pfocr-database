caption: Diagram depicting the proposed mechanism of action of sorafenib in mesothelioma
  TICs. Sorafenib treatment causes the inhibition of MEK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation
  and the downregulation of Mcl-1 expression, leading to cell cycle arrest and activation
  of the apoptotic program. Sorafenib antitumor effects are mainly ascribed to a direct
  inhibition of FGFR1 activity rather than downstream effectors, such as Raf/Ras/MEK/ERK
  pathway. Thus TIC cultures autocrinally activating FGFR1 via the release of high
  amount of bFGF are likely to be more sensitive to the drug. bFGF basic fibroblast
  growth factor, FGFR FGF receptor, TIC tumor-initiating cell

  effects in human malignant pleural mesothelioma tumor-initiating cells.
