caption: 'Overview of the BCAA catabolic pathway. BCAA leucine, isoleucine, and valine
  undergo transamination that is catalyzed by branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT).
  This reaction requires α-Ketoglutarate, leading to the production of α-ketoacids
  α-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC), α-keto-β-methylvaleric acid (KMV), and α-ketoisovaleric
  acid (KIV). These intermediates undergo oxidative decarboxylation, catalyzed by
  the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKAD) complex.Figure reprinted from
