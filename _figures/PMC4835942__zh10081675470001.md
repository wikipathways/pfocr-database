caption: 'Ca2+-mediated regulation of autophagy in the heart. A: the autophagic process.
  Autophagy begins with the formation of the initiation complex and nucleation of
  the phagophore, with both processes being stimulated by Ca2+. Conversely, elongation
  of the phagophore to form the autophagosome and its fusion with lysosomes is antagonized
  by Ca2+. Ultimately, autophagy leads to the lysosomal degradation of the autophagosome
  content. B: Ca2+-mediated autophagy regulation. Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stimulates the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-β (CaMKK)β/5′-AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which inhibits mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR),
  thus prompting autophagy initiation. In contrast, Ca2+ transfer from ER to mitochondria
  stimulates ATP production, thereby inhibiting AMPK and preventing autophagy. Interestingly,
  the ER-mitochondria contact sites have been proposed as the hotspots for phagophore
  nucleation. Lysosomal-derived Ca2+, on the other hand, stimulates the calcineurin
  (CaN)/transcription factor EB (TFEB) pathway, leading to the transcription of ATG
  genes crucial for autophagy. C: Ca2+-mediated regulation of autophagy in the heart.
  Both insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)
  signaling in the heart decrease the autophagic flux via increased Ca2+ transfer
  to mitochondria. Increased Ca2+-sensing receptor expression during angiotensin II
  (Ang II)-induced hypertrophy stimulates autophagy through the CaMKKβ/AMPK pathway.
  Decreased levels of ryanodine receptor (RyR) expression have been shown to increase
  or decrease autophagic flux, depending on whether RyR downregulation is global or
  heart specific. In the case of cardiovascular medication, T-type Ca2+ channel blockers
  have been reported to inhibit autophagy, whereas blockers of L-type Ca2+ channels
  display the opposite effect. ULK1, UNC-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1; BECN1,
  beclin 1; LC3, light chain 3.'
