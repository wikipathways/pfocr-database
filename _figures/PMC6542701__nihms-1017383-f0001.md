caption: Risk factors for endometrial cancer. In general, estrogens, including 17β-estradiol
  (E2), drive endometrial growth and progestogens, including progesterone (P4), block
  endometrial growth and promote differentiation. Excess estrogens can be caused by
  obesity, where adipose tissue can synthesize estrogens, estrogen only hormone replacement
  therapy (HRT), and breast cancer treatment with tamoxifen, which acts as a partial
  ER agonist in endometrial cells. Loss of progesterone, which can occur due to anovulation,
  can also contribute to endometrial growth
