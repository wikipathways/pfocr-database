caption: 'Adropin regulates various signaling pathways to enhance insulin sensitivity,
  glucose metabolism, motor coordination, and endothelial function. In neurons (A),
  adropin binds to the Notch ligand NB3 to activate Notch1 signaling and regulate
  brain development. In addition, adropin activates mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) signaling in endothelial cells (B) through either the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)
  [to increase nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability via endothelial NO synthase (eNOS)
  upregulation], or in cardiomyocytes (C) through G-protein coupled receptor 19 (GPR19)
  [to regulate pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) expression and increase pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (PDH) activity]. Note: In this figure, VEGFR2 is represented as a
  plasma membrane receptor, but it has not yet been determined whether it acts as
  an extracellular receptor, or as part of an endosomal pathway, in adropin signaling
  (). Figure produced with license using Biorender software.'
