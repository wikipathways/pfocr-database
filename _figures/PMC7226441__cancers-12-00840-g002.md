caption: Stem cells of the neural crest-derived tumors (NCDTs) make epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) pathway reactivating together with the immunological suppression
  strategies useful during the embryonic life to guarantee maternal-fetal and intra-embryonic
  immune tolerance. The principal antigens connected to EMT in NCDTs are detailed
  related to the type of tumor. Moreover, NCDTs maintain a distinctive trait related
  to the common upregulation of the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) -dependent pathway.
  Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and hypoxia response elements (HRE) are used by embryonic
  stem cells to modulate their own stemness. In the tumor context, HIF triggers EMT
  in cancer cells, both HIF and EMT favor cytokine release inducing inflammation.
  These actions are sustained by hypoxia, that during tumor growing increased proportional
  to the tumor volume, and induces HER HIF-dependent. HIF determine a dependent positive
  feedback loop that included NF-kB, IL-6, STAT3, favoring further cytokines are released
  to trigger inflammation and to impair innate immunity reactions. Both TWIST1 and
  TGF-β1 are, in turn, regulated by directly or indirectly binding to HER HIF-dependent.
  TWIST1 is able to repress expression of E-cadherin, to coordinate EMT and chemotaxis
  toward the chemokine SDF-1 by upregulating its receptor CXCR4. SDF1/CXCR4 is involved
  in the chemotactic guidance and its activation is common in the progression phase
  of NCDTs. Finally, both EMT and HIF pathways in NCDTs are able to induce MHC II
  loss of expression and gain of expression of PD-1, impairing the adaptive immunity
  by B and T cells function failure.
