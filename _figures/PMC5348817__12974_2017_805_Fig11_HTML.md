caption: TOCI. An illustration demonstrates the cellular and molecular events associated
  with PWMD in the septic developing brain. Microglia are activated after LPS intraperitoneal
  injection and release proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β, which inhibits the generation
  of NFL, NFM, and NFH in the axon through its IL-1R1 via p38-MAPK signaling pathway.
  This suppresses axon development and contributes to axonal hypomyelination in septic
  neonatal brain. Moreover, the synaptogenesis of neurons involved in this process
  is ultimately affected
