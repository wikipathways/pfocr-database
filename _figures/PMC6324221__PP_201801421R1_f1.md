caption: Updated model of biogenic retrograde signals. The current model omits ABI4
  and PTM and highlights different GUN proteins and intermediates derived from the
  tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. GUN1 is believed to be a signal integrator. GUN6
  (FERROCHELATASE1), GUN2 (HEME OXYGENASE1), and GUN3 (PHYTOCHROMOBILIN SYNTHASE)
  are involved in the heme branch of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. GUN5 (SUBUNIT OF MG-CHELATASE)
  and GUN4 (a porphyrin-binding protein that enhances the activity of MG-CHELATASE)
  are involved in the biosynthesis of Mg-protoporphyrin IX. Tetrapyrrole intermediates
  such as Mg-protoporphyrin IX and heme are suggested to be exported from plastids
  to the nucleus and to act as regulators of PhANGs. The transport mechanism involved
  in signaling remains unknown, and nuclear targets of retrograde signals, although
  via unknown mechanisms, are the transcription factors GOLDEN-LIKE1 (GLK1), GLK2,
  ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5), and the blue-light receptor CRYPTOCHROME1 (CRY1).
