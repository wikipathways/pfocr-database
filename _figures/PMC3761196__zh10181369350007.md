caption: Cell compartment view for network of lipid metabolic genes highlighting the
  role of SREBF1, THRSP, and ESRRA curated by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Green
  nodes indicate downregulated genes; red indicates upregulated genes, and numbers
  represent fold changes at 72 h vs. 6 h. Orange arrows indicate predicted activation,
  yellow indicate inconsistent findings with state of the downstream gene, and gray
  indicate that the relationship is not predicted. Activation of SREBF1 leads to increase
  in expression of the genes for lipases (LPL), HDL transporter (SCARB1), TCA cycle
  (IDH), de novo FA synthesis (ACACA&B, ACLY, FASN), FA activation (ACSS1&2, ACSL1&4),
  FA elongation (ELVOL6), FA desaturation (FADS2, SC5DL), TG synthesis (GPAM), whereas
  the remaining genes are primarily involved in sterol biosynthesis. Downstream of
  ESRRA activation is the induction of the transcription factor (PPARA), FA transporter
  (CD36), lipase (LPL), FA binding (FABP3), TCA (SDHB, ACO1), FA modification (ACOX1,
  ACADM, ACADVL), FA activation (ACSL1), and others for cholesterol synthesis (HMGCS1,
  HMGCR, DLAT). Activation of THRB upregulates transcription factor (STAT5B) and de
  novo FA synthesis regulator (THRSP) as well as FA synthesis (FASN), FA activation
  (ACSL1), FA oxidation (PHYH, EHHADH), protein phosphatase (PPP2CA), and sterol synthesis
  (HMGCR, IDI1).
