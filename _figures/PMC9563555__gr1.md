caption: 'Redox-dependent antioxidant mechanisms of NAC. Intracellular GSH is synthesized
  from three amino acids: cysteine, glutamine, and glycine. Glutamine and cysteine
  levels are increased through transport of extracellular cystine and glutamine imported
  into cells. Glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) enables formation of γ-glutamyl cysteine
  and glycine catalyzed by GCL and glutathione synthetase (GSS) enzymes. GSH is formed
  by the GSS-catalyzed reaction between γ-glutamyl cysteine and glycine. Redox coupling
  to NADPH/NADP+ via thioredoxin (Trx) reductase-mediated oxidation/reduction of thioredoxin
  regulates the GSH/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) pathway catalyzed by glutathione reductase
  (GSR). GPX detoxifies H2O2 and lipid hydroperoxide using GSH as a substrate. This
  pathway also regulates transferrin receptor mediated iron signaling.NAC enhances
  GSH levels through a direct or indirect mechanism enhancing the detoxication of
  H2O2 and lipid peroxides described above. NAC also inhibits iron/heme catalyzed
  oxidations (ferroptosis), preventing the formation of more potent oxidants. NAC
  stimulates the NRF2-regulated cellular free iron responsible for iron-mediated lipid
  peroxidation or ferroptosis. NAC stimulates NRF2, thus inhibiting ferroptosis. NAC
  is metabolized to sulfanes that can directly react with ROS (superoxide and H2O2)
  and decrease their intracellular levels.This is an oversimplified version of the
  redox-coupled processes involved in the H2O2 detoxifying pathway. It does not include
  a redox relay for H2O2signaling through the redox activation pathway involving peroxiredoxin,
  STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and thioredoxin [].
  However, NAC can influence ROS mechanisms through redox regulation of thiol-containing
  redox couples.'
