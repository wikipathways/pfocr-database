caption: 'Simplified schematic of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/MET signaling pathway.
  Activation of phosphorylation of the kinase domain in cMET, a receptor tyrosine
  kinase (RTK), by HGF results in activation of adaptor proteins: growth factor receptor-bound
  protein2 (Grb2) and Grb2-associated binding protein (Grb2 and Gab1). Activation
  of these adaptor proteins leads to activation of various downstream effectors resulting
  in transcription of various genes important in mitogenesis, angiogenesis, and morphogenesis.'
