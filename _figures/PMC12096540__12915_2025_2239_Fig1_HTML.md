caption: 'Schematic representation of key reactions involved in glycerolipid synthesis
  in plants. Fatty acids are synthesized in the chloroplast stroma by the fatty acid
  synthase (FAS) complex, which uses acetyl-CoA to produce fatty acids conjugated
  with ACP. The 18:0-ACP molecules can be desaturated to 18:1-ACP by SAD. Acyl-ACPs
  (16:0, 18:0 and 18:1) are either incorporated into the prokaryotic lipid synthesis
  pathway within the chloroplast or exported for eukaryotic lipid synthesis at the
  ER. To participate in ER glycerolipid synthesis, these acyl-ACPs must first be converted
  into acyl-CoAs and transported to the cytosol through the sequential actions of
  the FAT, FAX1 and LACS enzymes. The acyl group is then transferred to G3P to produce
  LPA, which then enters the eukaryotic lipid synthesis pathway. Subsequent reactions
  catalysed by LPAT and PAP generate PA and DAG, respectively. Within the chloroplast,
  similar reactions occur, leading to the production of analogous lipids. Additionally,
  in the ER, glycerolipids undergo lipid remodelling, modifying their head groups,
  acyl chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation. This process involves enzymes such
  as LPCAT, PDAT, PLD and PLC, which generate various species of Lyso-PC, PC, PA and
  DAG. Some of these lipids can be transferred back to the chloroplast, although most
  of the proteins and complexes involved in this transport remain unidentified. In
  the chloroplast, DAG serves as the precursor for galactolipid synthesis, which is
  catalysed by MGD synthases (MGDG1/2/3) and DGD synthases (DGD1/2), generating DGDG.
