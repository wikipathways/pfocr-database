caption: Abiotic stress signalings and the related E3 ligases. (A, B) Schematic representation
  of water-deficit stress signaling in the presence or absence of ABA (A) and the
  involvement of E3 ligases in ABA-mediated drought signaling via AREB/ABF/ ABI5/DPBF
  bZIP subfamily (B). ‘Substrate modification’ indicates either negative regulation
  by polyubiquitination or positive regulation by monou-biquitination. (C, D) Simplified
  scheme of cold signaling pathway (C) and the negative regulation of ICE1 by HOS1
  E3 ligase (D). The protein stability of ICE1 is negatively regulated by ubiquitination,
  whereas its activity is positively regulated by phosphorylation and sumoylation.
  The activated ICE1 binds to MYCRS in the promoter region of CBF3 and then positively
  regulates the expression of CBF3 and its downstream genes. ‘P’ and ‘S’ indicates
  phosphate and small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO), respectively.
