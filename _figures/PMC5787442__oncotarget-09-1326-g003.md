caption: Hypoxia is a common characteristic of solid malignancies, which is involved
  in the processes of self-renewal, stemness maintenance, and EMT of CSCs. Hypoxia-inducible
  factors (HIFs) are the main effecters on CSC biology under hypoxia and are associated
  with the Akt, mTOR, Notch, TGF-β and ER-α signaling pathways. ER-α also participates
  in the response to hypoxia of CSCs. Additionally, the HIF-independent pathway is
  also implicated that downregulation of prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) can expand the
  CSC population.
