caption: 'Combined model of bacterial ethanolamine utilization pathways (adapted from
  [,]). Central routes of ethanolamine catabolism with reaction products and involved
  enzymes, as well as up-to-date polyamine uptake systems known in bacteria, are shown.
  EUTP: eut-pathway; AMNP: amination pathway; GGP, gamma-glutamylation pathway; BUE:
  biosynthetic utilization of ethanolamine; PHRP: polar head recycling pathway. Dashed
  arrows represent diffusion. Gray, rounded rectangle represents the bacterial microcompartment.
  Pathways in black: E. coli and S. typhimurium; dashed blue box: Mycobacterium sp.
  and M. tuberculosis; dashed orange box: C. salexigens and S. coelicolor [,,,,,,,,,].'
