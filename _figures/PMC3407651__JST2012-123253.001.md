caption: The STAT3 signalling pathway in ALK+ ALCL. STAT3 is activated by NPM-ALK
  signalling, but reports differ as to whether this is JAK3-dependent or independent.
  The phosphatase, PP2A, and signalling through the IL-9, IL-21, and IL-22 receptors
  also promote STAT3 activation in ALK+ ALCL. STAT3 promotes the expression of genes
  that suppress apoptosis and enhance proliferation in ALK+ ALCL. STAT3 can also repress
  a variety of genes in this malignancy through DNA methylation. Suppression of the
  SHP1 phosphatase by STAT3 is particularly important in ALK+ ALCL, as SHP1 inhibits
  NPM-ALK and STAT3 activity.
