caption: Potentiating immune response by activating TLR signaling pathways.With the
  exception of TLR3, all TLRs activate MyD88 dependent pathway which leads to NF-κB
  mediated proinflammatory cytokine upregulation. TLR3 and TLR4 can activate TRIF-dependent
  pathway which leads to IRF3 mediated interferon stimulated gene upregulation. TLR2
  and TLR4 reside on the cell membrane whereas TLR3/7/9 are localized in the endosomal
  compartment. TLR, Toll-like receptor.
