caption: 'Subgroup-specific heterogeneity in common pathways. (a) Based on data from
  Knepp et al, Brain Hemorrhages, 2022 (PMID: 36936603). ICH location-specific differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in the ICH location-common NF-κB Signaling Pathway. DEGs
  between Lobar ICH and Control are highlighted in green; DEGs between Deep ICH and
  Control are highlighted in blue; DEG in common – in orange. (b) Based on data from
  Tian & Stamova et al, JCBFM, 2012 (PMID: 22167233). Sex-specific DEGs in the Cellular
  Infiltration of Granulocytes Biofunction in female ischemic stroke (IS) vs female
  control (left) and male IS vs male control (right) at ≤3 h post ictus, before thrombolytic
  treatment. Red – genes that were upregulated in IS vs control; green – genes that
  were downregulated in IS vs Control. The oval circles genes that were common to
  female and male IS. GF – Growth Factor; Prot. – Protein; Rec. – Receptor; Reg. –
  Regulator. For details, please see Supplementary Material'
