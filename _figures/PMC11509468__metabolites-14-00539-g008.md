caption: 'Interplay between differential metabolites in HD group compared to ND group.
  Metabolic pathways are illustrated based on information obtained from KEGG database.
  Red boxes represent increased metabolites, blue boxes show decreased metabolites,
  blank boxes reveal no significant changes in metabolites. Numbers 1 to 12 represent
  metabolic pathways with impact value larger than 0.1 (Figure 5). ND group: normal
  diet group, n = 10; LD group: low dose group, n = 10; HD group: high dose group,
  n = 10'
