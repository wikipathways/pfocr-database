caption: Castrate-resistant prostate cancer progression is coupled with AR pathway
  inhibitions. (A) Intracellular mechanisms can be adopted by PCa cells under ARPI
  treatments that shift the ligand-dependent AR signalling to the ligand-independent
  AR signalling and AR bypass oncogenic pathways. (B) Intercellular mechanisms can
  be adopted by tumours under ARPI treatments to select tumours that are less dependent
  on androgens to survive and populate. During this process, tumours exhibit heterogeneous
  phenotypes that can be classified by luminal epithelial markers such as AR and PSA
  and neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin.
