caption: The mitochondrial PHB2/OMA1/DELE1 pathway cooperates with endoplasmic reticulum
  stress to induce ovarian cancer cell death. Destruction of the prohibitin 2 (PHB2)/stomatin-like
  protein 2 (STOML2) complex releases OMA1 protease activity. Activated OMA1 cleaves
  optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) and DELE1, resulting in mitochondrial cristae remodeling
  and DELE1’s cytoplasmic interaction with EIF2AK1. Activated EIF2AK1 cooperates with
  EIF2AK3 to induce EIF2S1 phosphorylation, promoting the transfer of ATF4 into the
  nucleus and the upregulation of DDIT3 and ATF5. Then, pro-apoptotic proteins, BBC3,
  BCL2L11 and PMAIP1, are upregulated and anti-apoptotic protein MCL1 is downregulated,
  triggering accumulation of BAX and BAK1 on the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM)
  and the rupture of the MOM. Under the coordination of mitochondrial inner and outer
  membranes, cytochrome c is released, and the cell dies. Green arrows indicate positive
  regulation; red arrow indicates negative regulation.
