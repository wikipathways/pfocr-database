caption: Synthetic lethality is depicted on the left, using VPS4A on chromosome 16q
  and VPS4B on chromosome 18q as an example. When 16q or 18q deletions occur separately,
  there is no effect on tumour growth. However, when VPS4B is inhibited in tumour
  cells with 16q deletion, or when VPS4A is inhibited in tumour cells with 18q deletion,
  synthetic lethality occurs and there is cell death (Neggers et al, ). Oncogenic
  addiction is depicted on the right, using BRAF as an example. In cells harbouring
  an oncogenic BRAF‐V600E mutation, there is constitutive activation of the signalling
  pathway leading to cell growth and proliferation. However, these cells are particularly
  sensitive to knockdown or inhibition of BRAF, which leads to cell death, as the
  cells are dependent on this signalling pathway for continued growth (Settleman,
  ).
