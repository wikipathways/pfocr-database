caption: Overview of Wnt signaling pathway. (a) In the canonical Wnt pathway, DKK
  directly competes with Wnt for binding to LRP6. When DKK binds to the receptor,
  cytosolic pool of β-catenin is maintained at low levels through proteasomal degradation,
  due to its phosphorylation by the complex consisting of Axin/APC/CK1/GSK-3β. (b)
  Binding of Wnt to receptors Fz/LRP leads to the recruitment of components of the
  destruction complex to the membrane. This prevents phosphorylation and degradation
  of β-catenin, resulting in its accumulation in the cytoplasm. Stabilized β-catenin
  translocates into the nucleus and activates transcription of Wnt target genes.
