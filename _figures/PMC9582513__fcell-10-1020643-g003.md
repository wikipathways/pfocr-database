caption: Activation of DNA damage checkpoint and cell cycle arrest in mammalian cells.
  The DSBs in mammalian cells are recognized by MRN complex and processed with the
  help of CtIP, EXO1, BLM, and DNA2 proteins to generate 3′ ssDNA extension. This
  results in the recruitment and activation of ATM/ATR kinase and subsequently, the
  activation of CHK/CHK2 kinases. The activated kinases then inhibit the effectors
  required for the onset of mitosis, thus causing cells to arrest in G2. In addition,
  ATR/ATM/CHK1/CHK2 kinases stabilize p53 which help in the imposition of G2 arrest.
  P53 also activates apoptotic pathway in certain cellular contexts. As in yeast,
  the activation of checkpoint effectors in mammalian cells also trigger the DNA repair
  pathways.
