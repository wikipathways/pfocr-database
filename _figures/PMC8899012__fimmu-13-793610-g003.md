caption: UBE2L3 binding with different E3 ubiquitin ligases acts on NF-κB signaling
  pathway. Upon the stimulation of IL-1R, TAX interacts with UBE2L3 to synthesize
  the heterotypic chains, resulting in IκB phosphorylation, and the degradation and
  activation of NF-κB. In the TNFR pathway, UBE2L3 interacts with LUBAC to synthesize
  first, a linear ubiquitin chain, then there is a linear ubiquitination of NEMO and
  a phosphorylation of IKKβ, ultimately leading to the activation of NF-κB. While
  OspG can interact with UBE2L3-Ub conjugates to improve the kinase activity of OspG,
  which inhibit the activation of NF-κB.
