caption: The transcript abundance of candidate genes involved in the proposed L-galactose
  pathway of ascorbate biosynthesis and regeneration during fruit maturation of ‘WCHL’
  and ‘YCHL’ pitayas. Gene abbreviations are shown in . The correlation analyses of
  ascorbic acid contents and gene expressions are labeled as * (p < 0.05, two-tailed)
  or ** (p < 0.01, two-tailed), red indicates positive relationship while blue is
  negative.
