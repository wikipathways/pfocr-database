caption: Schematic diagram of myocilin signaling in cell migration. Binding of myocilin
  or Wnt to frizzled receptors may enhance the association of Dvl with APC leading
  to the activation of FAK and its accumulation at the leading edge. Downstream targets
  of activated FAK include PI3K lipid kinase and Akt serine/threonine kinase. Inhibition
  of these kinases reduced cell migration. Myocilin proteolytic fragments also stimulate
  cell migration through the same mechanism.
