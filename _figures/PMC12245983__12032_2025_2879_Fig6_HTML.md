caption: Hedgehog pathway is mediated by ligand HH, upon binding to PTCH the SMO inhibition
  is weakened, allowing its translocation to plasma membrane leading to HH pathway
  activation. Upon activation of SMO, GLI-SuFu complex is dissociated, releasing GLI
  proteins into the nucleus. Gli1 is a transcription target but also a strong positive
  activator of downstream target genes and is used as a marker for abnormal activation
  of HH pathway. Gli2 has dual function of activation and inhibition while Gli3 is
  inhibition
