caption: Summary of NAD+ synthesis using nicotinamide as substrate. In vertebrates,
  NAD+ is synthesised primarily from nicotinamide, obtained either from the diet or
  the actions of NAD+-consuming enzymes, via the salvage pathway. NAD+ is also cleaved
  by the NAD+-ase SARM1, releasing nicotinamide plus the signalling molecule (cyclic)ADP-ribose.
  Levels of nicotinamide are regulated by the N-methylation of nicotinamide, producing
  1-methylnicotinamide, by nicotinamide N-methyltransferase. In invertebrates, NAD+
  is synthesised from nicotinic acid, produced via the deamination of nicotinamide
  by nicotinamidase. The key intermediates in both pathways are boxed. MNA = 1-methylnicotinamide;
  NAM = nicotinamide; N(a)MN = nicotinamide(ate) mononucleotide; N(a)AD+ = nicotinamide(ate)
  adenine mononucleotide; NA = nicotinic acid; NNMT = nicotinamide N-methyltransferase;
  N(a)A(M)PT = nicotinamide(ate) phosphoribosyltransferase; N(a)MNAT = nicotinamide(ate)
  mononucleotide adenylyltransferase; NADA = nicotinamidase; NADS = NAD+ synthase;
  SAM = S-adenosylmethionine; SAH = S-adenosylhomocysteine; PPi = pyrophosphate; NH3
  = glutamine; PPRP = phosphoribosyl diphosphate.
