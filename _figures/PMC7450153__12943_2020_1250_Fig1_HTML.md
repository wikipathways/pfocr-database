caption: The cGAS-STING DNA sensing signaling pathway. Various DNA derived from virus,
  dying tumor cells or nucleus and mitochondria binds to and activates the cytosolic
  DNA sensor cGAS, cGAS catalyzes the synthesis of 2′3′-cGAMP in the presence of ATP
  and GTP, then 2′3′-cGAMP binds to the ER adaptor STING, which also can be activated
  by CDNs derived from bacteria. Upon activation, STING translocates from ER to Golgi
  compartments, where it activates TBK1 and IKK, which phosphorylate IRF3 and IκBα
  respectively. Then IRF3 and IκBα dimerize and enter nucleus, initiating the transcription
  of Type I IFN, TNF and IL6. The primary roles of these cytokines are reflected in
  host defense, inflammation and antitumor immunity
