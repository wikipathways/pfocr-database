caption: (A) The proteins in the shikimate pathway. (B) Chemical reactions of shikimate
  dehydrogenase (SDH) and shikimate kinase (SK). SDH converts 3-dehydroshikimate into
  shikimate using NAPDH and then SK converts shikimate into shikimate 3-phosphate
  by ATP. These three compounds share the same substructure (blue region). (C) Establishment
  of site-moiety maps of SDH and SK. A site-moiety map represents the binding environments
  of a protein binding site by anchors. (D) The site-moiety map alignment of SDH and
  SK for identifying the conserved binding environments (pathway anchors). (E) Pathway
  anchors of SDH and SK. Hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals anchors are colored in
  green and gray, respectively. (F) Pathway inhibitors identified by the pathway anchors.
