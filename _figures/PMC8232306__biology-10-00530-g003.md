caption: Pathways that repair SpCas9-directed DNA breaks. The pathway employed to
  repair Cas9 generated double-strand breaks (DSBs) is dependent on the repair factors
  present, level of resection, extent of homology, and cell cycle phase. If the ends
  of a DSB are immediately capped by Ku proteins, preventing resection, the nonhomologous
  end-joining pathway (NHEJ) initiates to ligate the DNA ends back together. NHEJ
  leads to uncontrolled insertions and deletions (indels), varying in size. Specific
  insertions can be incorporated through NHEJ via homologous independent targeted
  insertions (HITI) by supplying a double-stranded (ds) DNA donor flanked by Cas9
  cleavage sites. During the M and S phase, when low levels of resection occur in
  the presence of 2–25 bp of homology, microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) takes
  place that results in small indels. During S and G2 phases, homology-directed repair
  (HDR) can achieve precise deletions, insertions, and edits, utilizing ss or ds donors.
