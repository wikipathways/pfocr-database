caption: A) Representation of membrane protein O-glycosylation with emphasis on the
  STn expression by cancer cells. This is a highly regulated process of critical importance
  for protein stability and function. Briefly, newly synthesized proteins are O-glycosylated
  in the Golgi apparatus by the ppGalNAcTs-mediated addition of GalNAc moiety to Ser/Thr
  residues. This originates the Tn antigen (GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr-protein backbone), which
  is the simplest O-glycan. In normal cells these chains are extended through the
  sequential addition of other sugars first by CGALT-1 and then other enzymes. This
  culminates in highly complex, heterogeneous and elongated glycans often terminated
  by ABO or Lewis blood group related antigens (left drawing). In cancer cells the
  Tn antigen is immediately sialylated by ST6GalNAc.I, originating the STn antigen
  (Neu5Ac-GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr-protein backbone), thereby inhibiting further chain elongation
  (right drawing). The expression of STn at the cell surface influences cell-cell
  adhesion and cancer cell recognition, favouring motility, invasion and immune escape.
  B) Schematic representation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which is ubiquitously
  activated in bladder tumours. This is a highly conserved pathway regulated mainly
  by a wide variety of extracellular signals, including mitogenic growth factors,
  hormones, nutrients, cellular energy levels, and stress conditions. These signals
  activate tyrosine receptor kinases that recruit PI3K, which catalyses the conversion
  of membrane-bound PIP2 to PIP3. Then Akt and PDK-1 are activated through binding
  to PIP3. PTEN preferentially dephosphorylates PIP3, inhibiting signalling progression.
  Full Akt activation requires double phosphorylation by PDK-1 itself and PDK-2 (not
  shown). Akt phosphorylates mTOR directly or may also inactivate TSC1/TSC2 complex,
  inhibiting mTOR inactivation. mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by phosphorylating
  eukaryotic translation regulators, among these p70S6 kinase (p70S6K or S6K1) that,
  in turn, phosphorylates the ribosomal protein S6 (pS6), and the eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 4E–binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). For the protein mTOR to activate
  its signalling cascade, it must form the rapamycin-sensitive ternary complex mTORC1.
  Key PI3K/Akt/mTOR-pathway proteins pAkt, pmTOR and pS6 explored in this studied
  are highlighted by orange circles.
