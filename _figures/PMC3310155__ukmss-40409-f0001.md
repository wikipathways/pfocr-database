caption: Model of CaS receptor sorting traffic. During synthesis the polypeptide,
  together with the ribosome, is targeted to the rough ER due to the presence of the
  signal sequence (co-translational transport). Upon completion of synthesis, the
  receptor becomes anchored in the ER membrane in an orientation maintained throughout
  the secretory pathway. In the ER, CaS receptor monomers assemble as homodimers,
  which are retained (stop sign) and are core glycosylated. CaS receptor dimers in
  association with RAMP1 or RAMP3 bypass the ER retention and reach the Golgi apparatus
  where they are terminally glycosylated before being delivered to the plasma membrane
  (PM). For clarity, additional proteins modulating CaS receptor traffic such as GABAB1
  and GABAB2 are not indicated. The stoichiometry between RAMP and the CaS receptor
  is not known but, for simplicity, we depict one RAMP per CaS receptor homodimer.
