caption: This well-known pathway describes the inhibition of the conversion of pyruvate
  to acetyl CoA, alteration of the TCA cycle, increased glutaminolysis and ketone
  body production. Organic acids within the box were measured for both cancer and
  normal tissues in this study. *represents significantly increased levels of OAs
  in gastric cancer tissues.
