caption: A proposed model of molecular targets of Luteolin (Lut) in preventing MG-induced
  apoptosis. Our study found that Lut prevents MG-induced apoptosis by decreasing
  protein phosphorylation of mTOR, and 4E-BP1 in PC12 cells. Furthermore, our study
  also confirmed the mTOR/4E-BP1 signaling pathway modulates apoptosis and regulates
  the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax in PC12 cells. This suggests that
  Lut prevented MG-induced cell apoptosis and decreased the expression of the pro-apoptotic
  Bax protein and Cyt C and casepase-3 through inhibiting mTOR/4E-BP1 signaling pathway.
