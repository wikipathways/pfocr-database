caption: Diverse mechanisms of NETs’ role in pathogenesis of lupus. (A) NET formation
  starts with the activation of neutrophils through triggering of stimuli, which activate
  NADPH and mitochondria pathway. The latter promotes the citrullination of histone
  and facilitates their interaction with DNA. NETs are enriched in oxidized mitochondrial
  DNA, LL37 and HMGB1. (B) The extruded DNA from NETs is highly immunogenic. It activates
  plasmacytoid dendritic cells via TLR9 signaling, leading to the production of IFN-α.
  LL37-DNA complexes and DNA–HMGB1 complexes directly trigger polyclonal B cell activation
  via TLR9 or TLR7/9 and produce autoAbs. Both IFN-α and immune complex activate neutrophils,
  lead to more NETs formation and a positive feedback cycle. NETs can also have a
  direct cytotoxic effect on renal epithelial and endothelial cells via the externalization
  of histones, and therefore lead to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), endothelial-mesenchymal
  transition (Endo-MT). Abs, antibodies; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Endo-MT,
  endothelial-mesenchymal transition; HMGB1, high-mobility group box 1; IFN, interferon;
  NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen; NET, neutrophil extracellular
  trap; PAD, peptidyl arginase deaminase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TLR, toll-like
  receptor.
