caption: 'Effect of phenolic compounds on neurodegenerative processes. (a) The mechanism
  of entry of phenols has not been fully clarified, but it has been proposed that
  they could enter by passive diffusion (green dotted arrows), or by using some transporter
  (purple dotted arrows), which is still undefined. At the cellular level, phenolic
  compounds can prevent protein aggregate formation and neuron loss, as well as alleviate
  oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory processes. (b) Phenols favor the activation
  of signaling pathways involved in cell survival and the synthesis of neurotrophic
  factors and inhibit proteins involved in the pro-inflammatory signaling pathway
  (NF-kB), as well as the inhibition of ROS, an oxidizing agent of proteins, nucleic
  acids, and lipids, which favors the survival of neuronal populations. 1. Ferulic
