caption: 'Overview of the mammalian UPR. The three ER resident sensors (IRE1α, PERK,
  and ATF6) transduce information about the protein folding status of the ER to the
  cytosol and nucleus to restore the protein folding capacity. Under normal conditions,
  the sensors are inactivated by binding to the chaperone BiP. Under ER stress conditions,
  the sensors are activated by BiP dissociation and/or direct misfolded protein binding.
  Each pathway uses a different mechanism for signal transduction upon activation.
  IRE1α dimerizes, autophosphorylates, and triggers its RNase activity. This leads
  to the splicing of the XBP1 mRNA to produce an active transcription factor, spliced
  XBP1 (XBP1s). XBP1s induces the transcription of the genes encoding protein chaperones,
  ERAD, and phospholipid synthesis. The RNase activity of IRE1α also degrades certain
  mRNAs through RIDD. Activated IRE1α can activate the JNK, p38, ERK, and NF-kB pathways,
  thus playing an XBP1-independent role to modulate diverse cellular responses. Upon
  activation, PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, leading to global translational attenuation
  while selectively mediating translation of ATF4. In turn, ATF4 induces the expression
  of genes involved in amino acid metabolism, proapoptotic factor DDIT3/CHOP, and
  antioxidant responses (HO1). PERK also phosphorylates and stabilizes NRF2, a transcription
  factor involved in redox metabolism. ATF6 is transported to the Golgi apparatus
  under ER stress, where it is processed by S1P and S2P, releasing its cytosolic domain
  fragment as a transcription factor. ATF6 activates genes encoding protein chaperones,
  ERAD components, and XBP1. Abbreviations: ATF, activating transcription factor;
  BiP, binding immunoglobulin protein; DDIT3, DNA damage inducible transcript 3; eIF2α,
  eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  ERAD, ER-associated protein degradation; HO1, heme oxygenase 1; IRE1α, inositol-requiring
  enzyme 1α; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa light-chain
  enhancer of activated B cells; NRF2, NF-E2-related factor 2; PERK, PKR-like ER kinase;
  RIDD, regulated IRE1α dependent decay of mRNA; S1P and S2P, site 1 and site 2 proteases;
  UPR, unfolded protein response.'
