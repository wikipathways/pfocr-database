caption: Edge differences between receptor positive (luminal A and B) and receptor
  negative (HER2, triple negative) breast tumor samples for a common sub-network of
  the T cell and B cell receptor signaling pathways (left) and the T cell receptor
  signaling pathway (right). Red edges are those that are more stable in receptor
  positive breast cancer, while green refers to receptor negative breast cancer. AKT3
  and NFATC1 regulation appear to be driving the change between these phenotypic groups
