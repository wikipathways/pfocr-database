caption: Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Nrf2-Keap1)-antioxidant response element
  (ARE) pathway. Under basal conditions, the Nrf2/Keap1 complex is a prerequisite
  for its subsequent polyubiquitination, resulting in proteasomal degradation of this
  complex. Under oxidative stress, free Nrf2 can translocate to the nucleus and activate
  ARE-related gene transcription. The signaling steps that are affected by phytochemicals
  in the Nrf2-signaling axis are presented.
