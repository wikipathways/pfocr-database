caption: 'Polarized macrophages have differential metabolic programming. Inflammatory
  macrophages characteristically increase glucose uptake to fuel aerobic glycolysis,
  producing increased lactate and ATP production. The pentose phosphate pathway feeds
  off of the increased flux of glycolytic intermediates, resulting in heightened nucleotide
  and amino acid synthesis. Classically activated macrophages have a disrupted TCA
  cycle in two locations: at isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and at succinate dehydrogenase
  (SDH). As a result, citrate and succinate accumulate and drive such functions as
  fatty acid and NO synthesis, antimicrobial itaconate production, and HIF1α activity
  to promote further glycolysis and inflammatory cytokine production. Arginine is
  differentially metabolized in polarized murine macrophages, producing the antimicrobial
  molecule NO in inflammatory macrophages. Anti-inflammatory macrophages are not as
  metabolically active compared to classically activated macrophages, and they utilize
  glutamine, glucose, and fatty acids to fuel the TCA cycle and OXPHOS. In alternatively
  activated macrophages, glutamine uptake drives UDP-GlcNAc production, which is important
  for N-glycosylation of cell surface receptors, such as CD206 and CD301. In anti-inflammatory
  murine macrophages, arginine is metabolized to ornithine, which promotes tissue
  repair through production of prolines and polyamines. White arrows indicate metabolic
  intermediates driving M1 or M2 activities. α-KG, alpha-ketoglutarate; ARG1, arginase;
