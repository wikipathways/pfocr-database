caption: Type I interferon pathway during SARS‐CoV infection and modulatory mechanisms,
  PLpro excluded. MDA5 and RIG‐I can both recognize SARS‐CoV dsRNA and RIG‐I is also
  able to recognize uncapped 5′‐triphosphate RNA. M protein can avoid IFN production
  mediated by RIG‐I and disrupt the interaction of TRAF3 with TANK, TBK1, and IKKɛ.
  N protein may serve as an NMD inhibitor and is able to interfere IRF3 signaling
  pathway. Besides, nsp15 possesses EndoU activity that can make virus avoid recognized
  by MDA5, PKR, and OAS‐RNase L pathway. Additionally, S, E, and N protein, as well
  as nsp1 can antagonize NF‐ kB pathway. Besides, ORF3b, 6, 8b, and 8ab can inhibit
  mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)‐mediated IRF3 pathway, while ORF3a
  and ORF 7a protein are able to suppress NF‐kB pathway. ORF6 protein can also inhibit
  STAT1 nuclear import in response to IFN signaling.
