caption: Pyrimidine biosynthesis. Buchnera is able to synthesize UMP, but most successive
  steps are missing, while “Candidatus Blochmannia” seems to need UMP as the starting
  material but, with the exception of trymidylate synthase (ThyA), can catalyze all
  consecutive steps. Only in Wigglesworthia is the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway
  complete. Missing steps are highlighted in grey.
