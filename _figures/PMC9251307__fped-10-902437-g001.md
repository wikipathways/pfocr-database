caption: Hyperoxia increases the levels of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker
  Bip and downstream effectors. On sensing the presence of ER stress, both PERK and
  IRE1α are phosphorylated, activating downstream effectors, while ATF-6 is cleaved.
  Through the above reactions, the body initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR),
  alleviating oxidative stress damage. If the stress persists, the UPR becomes ineffective.
  Cells will undergo CHOP-mediated apoptosis if the UPR fails to mitigate the ER stress.
  Caffeine can attenuate all of the responses. In addition, when excessive ROS are
  generated upon exposure to hyperoxia, caffeine administration can prevent and/or
  reduce hyperoxia-induced ROS generation and any resultant DNA damage. In response
  to oxidative stress, the expression of antioxidant genes is regulated by the Nrf2/Keap1
  pathway. Expression of Nrf2, a cytoprotective mediator that regulates the expression
  of genes encoding antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxifying proteins is induced
  by hyperoxia, while expression of Keap1 is repressed. Caffeine inversely regulates
  RNA expression. The expression of Sod1, Sod2, and HO-1 are regulated by Nrf2. ROS,
