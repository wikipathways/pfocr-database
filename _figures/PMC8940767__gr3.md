caption: 'Schematic illustration of cell mechanobiological responses to substrate:
  ① mechanosensation process. Transmembrane protein integrins perceive substrate mechanical
  cues by activating the assembly of focal adhesion molecules (e.g., vinculin, talin,
  and paxillin) and recruiting FAK; ② mechanotransduction process from the extracellular
  environment to the cytoplasm. The perceived mechanical signals are transmitted from
  FAs to the cytoplasm through multiple mechanisms, including ion channel activation,
  actin remodeling, as well as RhoA/ROCK molecule pathway; ③ mechanotransduction process
  from the cytoplasm to the nucleoplasm. This transmission process is mainly mediated
  by LINC molecular complexes, which are composed of nesprin isoforms that link to
  cytoskeletons in the cytoplasm and inner nuclear membrane-associated SUN proteins
  that bind to lamins in the nucleoplasm; ④ mechanoresponse process. The interactions
  between Lamins and LINC result in gene and protein expression changes and then induce
  the adaptive cellular response.'
