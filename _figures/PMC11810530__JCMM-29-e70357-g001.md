caption: Pyroptosis signalling cascade in IHD involves a series of events. During
  ischaemic stress and the reperfusion period several DAMPs such as TNF‐α, HMGB1 and
  mtDNA bind to TLR4 on the plasma membrane. This interaction primes TLR4, leading
  to subsequent activation of the TLR4/MyD88/TAK1/NF‐κB signalling pathway. Activated
  NF‐κB translocases into the nucleus, resulting in the transcriptional upregulation
  of pro‐caspase 1, NLRP3, ASC, pro‐IL‐1β and pro‐IL‐18. NLRP3 recruits the adapter
  protein ASC, forming the NLRP3 inflammasome. mtROS and oxidised mtDNA can also directly
  interact with NLRP3, facilitating the assembly of the inflammasome and the subsequent
  activation of caspase 1. Assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome causes the cleavage
  of procaspase 1 into its active form, cleaved caspase 1. Once activated, caspase
  1 further cleaves pro‐IL‐1β into IL‐1β and pro‐IL‐18 into IL‐18. Cleaved caspase
  1 also proteolytically cleaves GSDMD into GSDMD‐NT. GSDMD‐NT undergoes oligomerisation
  and translocates to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, leading to the formation
  of GSDMD‐NT transmembrane pores. These pores allow for the influx of extracellular
  substances (e.g., extracellular Ca2+ and H2O) and the efflux of intracellular components
  (e.g., IL‐1β, IL‐18 and K+), ultimately culminating in pyroptosis execution. Consequently,
  IHD‐mediated myocardial pyroptosis results in myocardial cell death, inflammation,
  cardiac injury, adverse cardiac remodelling, contractile dysfunction and the development
  of heart failure. ASC, apoptosis‐associated speck‐like protein containing a CARD;
