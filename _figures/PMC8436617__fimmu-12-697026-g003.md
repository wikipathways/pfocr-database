caption: The schematic of m6A in immune cell. (1) In dendritic cells (DCs), YTHDF1
  suppresses the antigen-presentation by DCs through maintain the expression of lysosomal
  cathepsins; METTL3-mediated m6A modification promotes DCs activation through enhancing
  the translation efficiency of CD40, CD80 and TIRAP. (2) METTL3 in Tregs sustains
  the suppression roles of regulatory T cells through IL-2-STAT5 signaling pathway
  impairing CD8+ T cells tumor killing ability. (3) In macrophages, METTL3 sustains
  the YTHDF1-mediated translation of SPRED2, which inhibits NF-kB and STAT3 through
  the ERK pathway, restricting tumor growth and metastasis; METTL14-deficiency in
  macrophage impairs CD8+ T cells to eliminate tumors.
