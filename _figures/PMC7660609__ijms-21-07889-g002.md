caption: 'Role of HO-1 in I/R injury and cardioprotection. Cardiac I/R induces oxidative
  stress that consequently activates intracellular adaptive mechanisms in cardiomyocytes
  such as PI3K/Akt, PKC, JNK, or ERK1/2 signaling pathways. They further activate
  Nrf2 as the major positive regulator of HO-1 in the cell. Nrf2/HO-1 pathway can
  be activated also by application of several cardioprotective substances including
  polyphenols, L-carnitine, atorvastatin, crocetin, or hydrogen-rich water. HO-1 products
  (Fe2+, biliverdin, CO) then can scavenge free radicals, thus attenuating oxidative
  stress, which, in result, leads to cardioprotection. Finally, CO can be increased
  by direct application of CO donors, which, in turn, also leads to cardioprotection.
