caption: Cytokine-mediated bone remodeling. The adhesion of plasma cells to stromal
  cells increases the regulation of IL6 with the activation of osteoclasts. The Wnt/DKK1
  pathway is overexpressed in MM-associated lytic lesions. IL-3, IL-7, sFRP-2, and
  Runx2 are involved in bone formation; HGF and TGF-β act in bone remodeling. Wnt
  signaling stimulates osteoblasts’ (OB) differentiation. Blockade of this pathway
  through DKK1 inhibits OB formation. Wnt signaling upregulates RANKL expression from
  OB precursors, resulting in increased osteoclastic activity and bone resorption.
  Activation of Wnt pathway increases OPG production from OB which in turn downregulates
  RANKL-driven osteoclastogenesis. MIP-1α, produced by MM PC, promotes the proliferation
  and differentiation of osteoclast maturation. MM cells inhibit the osteoblastic
  activity through inhibitory factors and reduced production of cytokines.
