caption: Glycosides and UC-related receptors AND transcriptional regulation. Paeoniflorin
  12, vitexin 6, and baicalin 2 produced relief of UC by reducing TLR4 expression
  and blocking the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Glycyrrhizin 15, convallatoxin 20,
  and naringin 7 produced relief of UC by suppressing the expression of NF-κB via
  activated PPARγ. Salidroside 10 and naringin 7 produced relief of UC by inhibiting
  the expression of inflammasome and thereby reducing the release of IL-1β. Punicalagin
  8, paeoniflorin 12, pedunculoside 14, liriodendrin 19, baicalin 2, mangiferin 4,
  polydatin 11, and vitexin 6 produced relief of UC by blocking the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. Mangiferin 4, polydatin 11, pedunculoside 14, and paeoniflorin 12 produced
  relief of UC by blocking the MAPK signaling pathway. Asperuloside 13, hyperoside
  3, and polydatin 11 produced relief of UC by blocking the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway
