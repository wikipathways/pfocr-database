caption: (A) Classical genomic signaling. E2 binds ER in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus
  to mediate translocation, dimerization, and association of ERs to gene regulatory
  regions known as estrogen response elements (EREs). (B) Indirect genomic signaling
  (non-classical activation). Binding of growth factors (GFs) to growth factor receptors
  (GFRs) such as IGF-1R can activate PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways that in turn
  can phosphorylate ERs in the cytoplasm. The phosphorylated ERs translocate to the
  nucleus where they tether with other transcription factors on non-ERE sites (i.e.
  transcription factor response elements, TFREs) to modulate transcription of genes
  lacking EREs. The phosphorylated ER can also dimerize with ligand-bound ER to further
  modulate transcription or (C) bind to EREs in the absence of ligands to mediate
  gene-transcription. (D) Non-genomic signaling. E2 can bind to ERs in the cytoplasm
  (or at the plasma membrane) which directly interact with Src that modulates PI3K
  and MAPK signaling. In addition, E2 can bind the membrane bound GPER1 which also
  modulates kinase activations, either in a Src-mediated way or by stimulating adenylyl
  cyclase and cAMP production, which in turn can modulate different transcription
  factor activations, as well as phosphorylation of Ca2+ channels and influx of Ca2+.
  E2 binding to GPER1 can also activate the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway and mobilization
  of intracellular Ca2+ stores. This Ca2+ mobilization results in rapid non-genomic
  effects, adapting the cell to immediate responses, whereas the genomic signaling
  is slower, adapting the cell to long-term effects.
