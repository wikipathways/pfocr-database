  Numbers in the yellow boxes are the marginal frequencies of the aberration in the
  disease population. The numbers on/blow the arrows are the conditional probabilities
  between mutations along the oncogenic pathway. For example, consider the arrow from
  Mut A to Mut B in panel (a), the “P = 0.6” above the arrow means: Prob(Mutation
  B happens | Mutation A happens)= 0.6; while the “P′ = 0.05” below the arrow means:
  Prob(Mutation B happens | Mutation A does not happen)= 0.05. The remark “P′ = 0.05
  for all arrows” in panel (b) suggests: Prob(The right side mutation happens | the
  left side mutation does not happen)= 0.05.'
