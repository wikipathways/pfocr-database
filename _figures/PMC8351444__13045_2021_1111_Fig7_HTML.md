caption: The interactions between BCR-ABL and MYC in B-cell lymphocytic leukemia with
  t(9;22). Dashed arrows represent an indirect pathway of action, and thick arrows
  show the mediator's direct effect. Both mature and immature BCR signaling cascades
  are able to increase the MYC expression. sIgM signaling increases the MYC mRNA stability,
  which results in a higher level of MYC, and increase the BCR-ABL expression. BCR-ABL
  can induce MYC expression. Pre-BCR signaling can increase MYC stability and expression.
  Inhibitors of these signaling mediators can significantly reduce the activity and
  expression of MYC
