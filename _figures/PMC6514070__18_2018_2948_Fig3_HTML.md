caption: Potential cellular pathways and major players for the induction of the immediate
  early genes egr (a) and c-jun (b), and downstream targets, with focus on pathways
  previously linked to learning and memory in honey bees [, , , ]. a Activation of
  tyrosine receptor kinases (Trk) by neurotrophins induces via Ras (G protein) and
  Raf (kinase) the MAPK/ERK pathway, resulting in an activation of the transcription
  factors (TF) Elk-1 and/or CREB-1. By binding to their consensus target sequences
  (ETS and CRE sites), the TFs induce the transcription of egr. The Egr protein product
  in turn functions as a TF and activates the transcription of various late-response
  target genes. A list of candidate downstream genes in honey bees can be found in
  Khamis et al. []. Egr additionally auto-regulates its own expression by interacting
  with the promotor of the egr gene. Alternative regulation pathways include the cAMP-PKA
  signaling pathway and NMDA receptor-mediated activation of PKC or CaM kinases. b
  Activation of c-jun is also mediated by the MAP/ERK pathway. Another MAPK signaling
  pathway includes the c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), which activates c-jun expression
  by binding of the MEF2 site in the promotor. c-Jun protein is regulated through
  phosphorylation by JNK and forms homo- or heterodimers (e.g., with c-Fos) resulting
  in the activator protein 1 (AP-1) complex, which regulates gene transcription via
  AP-1 binding sites on the DNA. c-Jun also auto-regulates its own transcription.
