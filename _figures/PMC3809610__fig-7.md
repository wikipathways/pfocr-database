caption: Role of oxysterols in regulating cell signaling pathways related to oxidative
  reactions. Among various signaling pathways induced by oxysterols, the activation
  of Ca2+-dependent Plase A2, followed by AA release and NADPH oxidase up-regulation,
  has been hypothesized. The consequent ROS generation induces a complex network of
  cellular signals, which can lead to inflammation through NF-κB or to cell death
  by activating mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Plase A2, phospholipase A2; AA, arachidonic
  acid; PYK2, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2; PKC, protein kinase C; ERK1,2, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase1,2; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappaB; Bim, Bcl-2 interacting
  mediator of cell death; Bad, Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 associated death promoter.
