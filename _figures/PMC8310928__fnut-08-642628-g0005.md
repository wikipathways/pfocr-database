caption: Warburg effect. The Warburg effect is a form of modified cell metabolism
  observed in many neoplastic cells where, unlike normal differentiated cells, which
  rely primarily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate the energy
  needed for cellular processes, relies on aerobic glycolysis. Aerobic glycolysis
  is an apparently inefficient way of generating adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP),
  compared to oxidative phosphorylation which allows the production of ATP by the
  oxidative disruption of pyruvate in mitochondria. However, the rate of glucose metabolism
  through aerobic glycolysis is higher, so that lactate production from glucose takes
  place 10–100 times faster than complete glucose oxidation in mitochondria. The metabolic
  difference observed by Warburg adapts cancer cells to hypoxic (oxygen deficient)
  conditions within solid tumors and derives largely from the same mutations of oncogenes
  and tumor suppressor genes that cause the other abnormal characteristics of cancer
  cells. Hypoxic conditions could induce HIF1A, a major regulator of glucose metabolism,
  and activate the expression of key enzymes for glycolysis. The high use of glucose
  in aerobic glycolysis, in addition to the high production of ATP, and the increase
  in the pathway of pentose phosphates, both essential for the anabolic processes
  necessary to support cell proliferation, is associated with the production of high
  levels of lactate and the acidification of the tumor microenvironment which plays
  a favorable role to the growth of neoplastic. CAV, Caveolin; Gln, Glutamine; MCT,
  Monocarboxylated transporter; OXPHOS, Oxidative phosphorylation.
