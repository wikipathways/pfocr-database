caption: 'Model for initial bacterial transcription. The progress of initial transcription
  is illustrated by depicting RNAP (yellow block) at key points of the inferred mechanism.
  The mechanism includes three competing reaction pathways, which the ITC can embark
  on. Productive Transcription pathway (highlighted in green) results in promoter
  escape and synthesis of full-length RNA. Abortive Initiation pathway (highlighted
  in red) leads to the synthesis and dissociation of short RNA products. Futile Cycling
  (highlighted in blue) temporarily traps the ITC6 into catalytically inactive interconverting
  pre-translocated and backtracked states, respectively. Purple finger shows the different
  conformations of σ3.2. Green triangle marks the template base for the next incoming
  nucleotide in the active site of RNAP. Red and black strands represent the nascent
  RNA and template DNA, respectively. The multi-timescale transitions between PS and
  US in Fig.  have here been broken up to suggest a simple composition that would
  give rise to the two timescales observed in Fig. . The numeration (1, 2, and 3)
  indicates the three significant molecular mechanisms described by the model: the
  initial barrier imposed by σ3.2 to the transcript elongation, the subsequent loss
  of catalytic conformation and the RNA-dependent reversible backtracking, respectively.
  The US, PS, and FS FRET levels observed during the experiments are indicated at
  the bottom of the schematic'
