caption: Lenalidomide is uptaken by macrophages and directly promotes macrophages
  M2 polarization by IL10-STAT3 signaling pathway. Specifically, lenalidomide effectively
  increases IL10 expression and subsequently phosphorylates STAT3 Tyr-705. Phosphorylated
  STAT3 translocated into the nucleus encoding M2 macrophages-related genes such as
  Arg1, Ym1, and CD206. Anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted by M2 macrophages can
  reduce the infiltration of peripherally generated autoreactive Th1 and Th17 cells
  into CNS, inhibit demyelination, and therefore prevent of EAE
