caption: The Notch pathway is regulated by short-range cell–cell signaling. Notch
  is activated by interaction of one of the Notch receptors with its ligands and induces
  a sequence of proteolytic event leading to production of the Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD). NICD translocates to the nucleus, binds to the RBPJ complex, and
  recruits other transcriptional co-activators to initiate the transcription of target
  genes. Notch also regulates other target genes controlled by the TGF-β, NFκB, mTORC2,
  and HIF1α pathways.
