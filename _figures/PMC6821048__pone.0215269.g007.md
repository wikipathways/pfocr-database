caption: The diagram shows butein inhibitory effect in TNF-α-stimulated CCL2 expression
  at mRNA and protein level, attenuating IKBKE expression as a possible molecular
  mechanism in Caucasian cells; in addition to a possible signaling pathway for butein
  apoptotic effects in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cells.
