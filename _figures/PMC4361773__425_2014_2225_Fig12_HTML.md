caption: A proposed model of the auxin–ethylene interactions that are controlled by
  ERF022 and LEC2 and that are involved in the induction of SE. LEC2 expression is
  auxin stimulated (Ledwoń and Gaj ) and repressed by ethylene (present results, eFP
  browser). Conversely, ERF022 expression is repressed by auxin and stimulated by
  ethylene (present results). LEC2 activates the YUCCA (YUC) genes that are involved
  in auxin biosynthesis (Wójcikowska et al. ). ERF022 may enhance the auxin level
  through a positive regulatory interaction with LEC2 (present results). ERF022 may
  control ethylene signalling genes, ETR1 and ERF1 via the indirect inhibition of
  ethylene biosynthesis (ACS7). An ERF022-mediated decrease in ethylene production
  may result in the increased activity of ETR1 and inhibition of ERF1, which is consistent
  with the regulatory relations that were expected between ethylene, ETR1 receptor
  and ERF1 (Chen et al. ). Black lines with arrows indicate activation and black lines
  ending with bars indicate repression. Inferred functions with less experimental
  evidence are indicated by dashed lines
