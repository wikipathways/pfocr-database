caption: Colored-coded diagram of the key biochemical events in the feedback regulation
  of proximal TCR signaling. This cartoon illustrates the competing negative (SHP-1
  mediated) and positive (ERK-mediated) feedback loops that sharpen TCR discrimination
  of pMHC ligands. p56Lck* = kinase active Lck. p59Lck* = kinase active Lck serine
  phosphorylated on position 59. ppERK is dually-phosphorylated, active ERK. pSHP-1
  is tyrosine 564 phosphorylated SHP-1. The signaling starts with the interaction
  of peptide-MHC ligands with the TCR, which is coupled to the src-family kinase Lck
  in its p56 form. This leads to activation of Lck to p56 Lck* (blue arrow). The active
  Lck tyrosine phosphorylates SHP-1, producing pSHP-1, which in turn becomes activated
  within the phosphorylated environment of the active receptor, leading to dephosphorylation
  of key components of the signaling complex, including Lck itself, TCR ζ, and ZAP-70
  (not shown). This negative feedback pathway is indicated by red arrows and dominates
  with poor ligands, explaining the lack of effective downstream signaling. TCR engagement
  can also lead to signal propagation via Ras-GRP and SOS to ERK, producing active
  ERK (ppERK), shown in green arrows. ppERK can phosphorylate TCR-associated p56 Lck
  to produce p59 Lck (green arrows). This form of Lck is resistant to recruitment
  of pSHP-1 (indicated by beige arrow with X). This active kinase (p59 Lck*) mediates
  prolonged signaling through the TCR complex that communicates with various pathways
  leading to gene activation (not shown). This positive feedback loop (inhibition
  of the negative SHP-1 feedback loop) dominates with highly effective ligands and
  explains their potency.
