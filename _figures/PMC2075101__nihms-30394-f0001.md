caption: 5-HT2A receptor agonists cause activation of Gαq/11 proteins which in turn
  activate the second messenger enzyme PLC. Chronic treatment with olanzapine causes
  desensitization of this pathway as measured by either production of inositol phosphate
  in cells or PLC activity in brain tissue. We hypothesize that 5-HT2A receptor antagonism
  (induced by olanzapine) activates the Jak2/Stat3 pathway causing phosphorylated
  Stat3 to dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, stimulate immediate early genes
  and subsequently increase RGS7 transcription and RGS7 protein levels in the membrane.
  The increased membrane-associated RGS7 protein can then increase hydrolysis of activated
  Gαq/11 and result in desensitization of 5-HT2A receptor signaling.
