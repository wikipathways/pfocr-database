caption: The major lignan biosynthetic pathway in plants. Coniferyl alcohol is dimerized
  by DIR into pinoresinol, which is then converted into lariciresinol and secoisolariciresinol
  in a step-wise manner catalyzed by PLR. Secoisolariciresinol is converted into matairesinol
  by SIRD, which is eventually converted into pharmacologically active compounds such
  as hinokinin and podophyllotoxin.
