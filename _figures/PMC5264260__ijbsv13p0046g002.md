caption: The intracellular signaling pathways of α7nAchR in anti-inflammatory response.
  Acetylcholine (Ach), released from the terminal of synapsis, is a primary endogenous
  agonist of α7nAchR and exerts anti-inflammatory effect by activating α7nAchR. Activated
  cytomembrane α7nAchR inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines mainly
  through blocking nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity, which may involve multiple
  intracellular cascades. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of
  transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway represent a typical anti-inflammatory cascade for
  α7nAchR which can be blocked by AG490, a selective antagonist of JAK2. Phosphorylated
  STAT3 suppresses the dissociation between IκB and NF-κB, and subsequently inhibits
  the activation of NF-κB. Activated STAT3 also up-regulates the expression of suppressor
  of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase M (IRAK-M),
  both are essential for anti-inflammatory reaction. IRAK-M can negatively regulate
  Toll-like receptor (TLR) activity by preventing the dissociation of active IRAKs
  (IRAK-1 and IRAK-4) from MyD88 and subsequently bonding with TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6), thus it can interfere active TLR downstream signalings and inhibit
  the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Synergistically, PI3K-Akt pathway
  can attenuate the pro-inflammatory cytokine production when activated by α7nAchR
  agonists. Mitochondria are reported to express α7nAchR. Intra-cellular acetylcholine
  can inhibit production of IL-1β and HMGB1 by suppressing release of mitochondrial
  DNA and inhibiting activation of NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3
  (NLRP3) inflammasome.
