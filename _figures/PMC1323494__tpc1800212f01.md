  of GGDP is shown in detail. Enzyme designations are shown in italicized bold text.
  GGDP is proposed either to be directly reduced by GGR to PDP or to serve as substrate
  for chlorophyll synthase to form geranylgeranyl chlorophyll a. GGR reduces geranylgeranyl
  chlorophyll a to form chlorophyll a. Hydrolysis of chlorophyll by the action of
  chlorophyllase releases phytol, which can be reassimilated through two subsequent
  phosphorylation reactions with phytol kinase (VTE5) catalyzing a CTP-dependent phosphorylation
  of free phytol. Another enzyme, phytylphosphate kinase, is proposed for the second
  phosphorylation reaction to obtain PDP. PDP can enter the tocopherol biosynthetic
  pathway, be utilized for chlorophyll biosynthesis, or enter vitamin K (phylloquinone)
  biosynthesis. MEP, methylerythritol phosphate pathway.
