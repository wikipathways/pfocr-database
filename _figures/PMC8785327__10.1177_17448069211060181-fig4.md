caption: Illustration of proposed modulation of Cl− transport. Proteins involved in
  Cl− regulation that are modulated by DTMP treatment. GABA receptors and the glycine
  receptors are key proteins allowing Cl− into the cell for inhibitory control and
  subsequent pain relief. The presynaptic release and recycling of GABA, with the
  aid of neighboring astrocytes, facilitates continued inhibition and pain control
  as evidenced by a shift in protein expression that would facilitate increased intracellular
  Cl−. Regarding proteins involved in GABA signaling and Cl− hyperpolarization, DTMP
  was able to reverse expression of proteomic changes induced by the pain model, as
  well as to increase expression of proteins unaffected by this but important to GABA
  and Cl−signaling pathway.
