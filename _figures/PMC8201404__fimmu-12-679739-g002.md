caption: T cell signaling pathways that are influenced by GIMAP5. Following TCR stimulation
  by MHC:peptide complex or by Ab-mediated TCR cross-linking, LCK phosphorylates CD3
  zeta chains and ZAP70, resulting in the phosphorylation of LAT that acts as a scaffold
  for downstream signaling molecules such as PLCγ. Activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway downstream of TCR phosphorylates and inhibits the TSC1/2 complex, relieving
  repression of the mTORC1 kinase and leading to activation of downstream signaling
  events. IL-7 signaling stimulates STAT5 and also activates the PI3K/AKT pathway.
  GIMAP5 deficiency in rat and mouse T cells compromises proximal TCR signaling characterized
  by reduced Tyr phosphorylation of ZAP70 and LAT, but results in constitutive activation
  of AKT and mTORC1. GIMAP5 deficient T cells also display reduced IL-7-induced STAT5
  phosphorylation. It is unclear how GIMAP5 impacts the TCR and IL-7R signaling pathways
  and regulates AKT activity (, , –).
