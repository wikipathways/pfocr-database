caption: 'Glucose metabolism is highly crucial for cancer cells. This six-carbon monosaccharide
  can not only be used to fuel the energetic needs of cancer cells, but also to address
  the oxidative stress that accumulates as a byproduct of proliferation, metabolism,
  and growth. One mechanism employed to address oxidative stress is the use of the
  serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). During glycolysis, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase
  (PFK-2) drives the commitment of glucose flux through the glycolytic pathway by
  influencing the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and converting it
  into fructose-1,6,-bisphosphate (FBP). PP2A can reverse the flux of glucose to flow
  into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by de-phosphorylating PFK-2. When this
  occurs, an increase of NADPH is generated and subsequent decreases in ROS is observed.
  The mechanism in this pathway is denoted by solid, black arrows, while the consequences
  of de-phosphorylated PFK-2 are marked by dashed, black arrows. Along the same note
  of rewired metabolism to address ROS accumulation, constitutive activation of casein
  kinase 2 (CK2) has been observed in many cancers, yet its mechanism was poorly understood.
  Recently, it was found that CK2 activity is dependent upon glucose metabolism, and
  from glycolysis, CK2 signaling relies on the metabolic enzyme lactase dehydrogenase
  (LDHA) to promote cancer cell migration and invasion. The CK2/LDHA signaling pathway
  is marked by solid, red arrows and the results of this signaling is marked by dashed,
  red arrows. Intriguingly, although LDHA promotes the conversion of pyruvate into
  lactate at the end of glycolysis in the cytosol, oxidative stress induces its translocation
  to the nucleus wherein it promotes the conversion of α-ketobutyrate (α-KB) into
  α-hydroxybutyrate (α-HB) which promotes a complex formation with LDHA and disruptor
  of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOTL1) to drive a Nrf2-dependent transcription of
  antioxidant genes as well as Wnt target genes. The consequence of these upregulated
  genes is diminished ROS levels and promotion of tumor growth. The ROS-induced LDHA
  translocation pathway is marked by solid, green arrows, while the consequences are
  indicated with dashed, green arrows. Other Abbreviations: glucose-6-phosphate (G6P);
  hexokinase (HK); glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH); 6-phosphogluconolactone
  (6PG); 6-phosphogluconate (6P-Gluconate); ribose-5-phosphate (R5P).'
