caption: 'OIS is a barrier to tumorigenesis. Ras oncogene (such as H-RASv12) can promote
  senescence by two main mechanisms: generation of RS and subsequent DNA damage signaling
  and activation of inflammatory response by the cGAS-STING pathway. Replication stress
  (RS) and cGAS-STING pathway are molecularly connected at different levels (shown
  with dashed arrows). Oncogenic stress may lead to the accumulation of cytosolic
  DNA because of genomic DNA damage and/or formation of micronuclei. Interferons (IFNs)
  and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) have been proposed to generate RS and DNA
  lesions. Proliferation arrest upon senescence induction has been proposed to block
  tumorigenesis. As such, cancers do inactivate tumor suppressor genes, such as key
  factors of the DDR (1), or downregulate the cGAS-STING pathway (2). It has also
  been observed that some pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines can exert a pro-tumorigenic
  effect (3). Further details and references are in the main text'
