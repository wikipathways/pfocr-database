caption: Schematic of the glycolytic pathway. Chondrocytes of the epiphyseal growth
  plate exist in a low O2 microenvironment. Under these conditions, the cells generate
  ATP by glycolysis. Thus, glucose is converted to pyruvate, and under anaerobic conditions,
  this molecule is reduced to lactate. During the latter step, NADH generated during
  glycolysis is oxidized to NAD, an important co-enzyme for maintenance of the glycolytic
  pathway Some pyruvate can be converted to acetyl CoA, by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH); this molecule serve as an intermediate in the tricarboxylic (citric) acid
  cycle in the mitochondrion. The low oxemic environment also suppresses the cycle
  and the flow of electrons into the respiratory chain. This is achieved by stimulating
  the production and activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), an enzyme that
  inhibits PDH.
