caption: 'Ceramide synthesis pathways. Ceramides are synthesize through three ways,
  namely, de novo pathway, salvage pathway, and sphingomyelinase pathway. The de novo
  synthesis of ceramide commences with the condensation of serine and palmitate via
  action of serine palmitoyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase, followed by the continuous
  action of 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine reductase, dihydroceramide synthases, and dihydroceramide
  desaturase. In the sphingomyelinase pathway, ceramide can be produced from hydrolysis
  of sphingomyelin through the action of either acid or neutral sphingomyelinase,
  and ceramide also can synthesize sphingomyelin through the action of sphingomyelin
  synthase. The salvage pathway is more complex than the other two pathways. Glucosylceramide,
  complex sphingolipids, sphingosine, and sphingomyelin can generate ceramide from
  the action of diverse enzymes such as glucosylceramide synthase, LASS, and sphingomyelinase.
  SPT: Serine palmitoyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase; SMase: Sphingomyelinase; GCS:
  Glucosylceramide synthase.'
