caption: Proposed model of autophagy regulation by  in plants and algae. The intracellular
  level of  is modulated by different signals, including high-light stress, nutrient
  limitation,  stress, or pathogen infection.  ultimately lead to ATG1 activation
  and hence autophagy induction either via TOR signaling or a TOR-independent mechanism,
  denoted here as X. This unknown pathway might control autophagy through ATG1 regulation,
  as reported in mammalian cells for AMPK (SnRK1 in plants), or by a different mechanism
  as described for the ATG4 protease. See text for details. DPI, Diphenylene iodonium;
  NF, norflurazon; rap, rapamycin; tun, tunicamycin.
