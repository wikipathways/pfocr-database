caption: The potential treatments for intraocular malignancy by intervening the pathogenic
  factors of diabetes. GLUT1 inhibitors as well as GLUT1 antibodies inhibit tumor
  cell growth by limiting glucose translocated into the cell. Treatments targeting
  glycolytic enzymes inhibit glucose metabolism and tumorigenesis, including miR-216a-5p
  (the HK2 inhibitor), SOX-10 knockdown (GAPDHS suppression), and 2-DG and 2-FG (glycolytic
  inhibitors). Anti-IGF-1R antibody, IGF-1R inhibitor (such as pristimerin), PI3K/AKT
  inhibitors, FoxO3a overexpression, and miR-98 upregulation exert antitumor function
  by limiting IGF-1R and IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling pathway. Insulin sensitizer (such
  as metformin) and adiponectin treatment are considered potential approaches for
  treating intraocular malignancies by improving insulin resistance. →, activation;
  ⊥, inhibition.
