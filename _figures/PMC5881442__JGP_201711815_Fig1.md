caption: Mechanisms for visual chromophore production in the retina relevant to cone
  pigment regeneration. Cone-mediated vision is initiated by photoisomerization of
  11-cis-retinaldehyde bound to cone visual pigments, a process that leads to pigment
  activation and initiation of phototransduction. Photoisomerization leads to the
  release of all-trans-retinaldehyde from the visual pigment, which must be regenerated
  to allow for sustained visual function. Two enzymatic systems are thought to contribute
  to 11-cis-retinaldehyde production for the regeneration of cone pigments. The classical
  RPE65-dependent visual cycle pathway involves enzymes and retinoid-binding proteins
  located in photoreceptor outer segments and the RPE. This pathway is also critically
  involved in rod pigment regeneration. The RPE can store 11-cis-retinoids either
  in the form of 11-cis-retinaldehyde or 11-cis-retinol complexed with cellular retinaldehyde-binding
  proteins or, in some species, as 11-cis-retinyl esters. A second cone-specific enzymatic
  pathway, which is believed to be RPE65 independent and mechanistically distinct
  from the classical visual cycle, may involve enzymes and binding protein components
  located in cones and Müller cells. This pathway could generate the 11-cis-retinoids
  that are present in Müller glia, but such compounds could also originate in the
  RPE and be transferred through the retina to the Müller cells. Müller cells can
  store 11-cis-retinoids by the same mechanisms as used by RPE, but the extent of
  11-cis-retinyl ester formation is species dependent, typically being higher in diurnal
  animals. Selective regeneration of cone visual pigments relies on the unique ability
  of cones to use 11-cis-retinol delivered by Müller cells to form the necessary visual
  chromophore 11-cis-retinaldehyde. 11-cis-retinaldehyde also can be generated in
  situ in a light-dependent fashion via photoisomerization of all-trans-retinaldehyde-phosphatidylethanolamine
  Schiff base adducts. In this figure, solid lines indicate established pathways,
  whereas dashed lines indicate processes that are either hypothetical or not yet
