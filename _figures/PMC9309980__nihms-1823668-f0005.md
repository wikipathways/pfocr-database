caption: Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyses the first and rate-limiting step
  in sphingolipid biosynthesis. The most abundant acyl-CoA used by SPT is palmitoyl-CoA,
  which after condensation with L-serine results in an 18-carbon long-chain base,
  3-dehydrosphinganine. 3-dehydrosphinganine is rapidly reduced by 3-dehydrosphinganine
  reductase (KDSR) to form dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine). Sphinganine is acylated
  by a variety of ceramide synthases (CerS) to form dihydroceramides, which can be
  converted to ceramides by sphingolipid desaturase (DEGS). Many complex sphingolipids
  can be synthesized from a ceramide backbone. However, the only true exit from the
  pathway depends on activity of sphingosine kinase (SK) and sphingosine-1-phosphate
  aldolase (SGPL) to form phosphoethanolamine. SGPP = sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase.
