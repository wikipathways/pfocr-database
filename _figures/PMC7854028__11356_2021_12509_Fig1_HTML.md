caption: miRNAs participate in the regulation of key genes related to cellular response
  to IR. a IR-induced damaged DNA is sensed by ATM and ATR. Both of them can trigger
  activation of CHK and initiate the signaling pathway, leading to Checkpoint activation
  and DNA repair. Actived CHK degrades CDC25A, and consequently impairs CDK/Cyclin
  complex that is necessary for transform from G1 to S phase and G2 to M phase. What
  is more, ATM/P53/P21 is another vital pathway to inhibit cell cycle progress. P53
  can be activated by ATM with phosphorylation and subsequently stimulates expression
  of P21, which is an inhibitor of CDK/Cyclin complex. After activation of checkpoint,
  if DNA repair goes smoothly, the cell cycle goes on. b ATM-activated P53 aggregating
  in cytoplasm cooperates with P21 and promotes mitochondria to produce reactive oxygen
  species via inhibition of anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2 and enhance pro-apoptotic gene
  BAX, ultimately leading to apoptosis. c IR is able to activate EGFR and EGFR initiates
  PI3K/AKT pathway and MAPK pathway to promote cell proliferation. PTEN is an important
  antagonist of AKT. Its inhibition is closely related to activation of PI3K/AKT pathway
  and cell proliferation. miRNAs have a great effect on cellular response to IR via
  negative regulation of genes associated with proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair,
  and cell cycle. More information depicted in text
