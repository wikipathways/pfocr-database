caption: 'Radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE). Ionizing radiation can directly
  cause DNA damage and activate the DNA damage response and repair reactions pathway
  (DDR/R), while the latter activates macrophages through the release of damage-associated
  molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), thereby further enhancing the inflammatory
  and immune response. The reactive oxygen species (ROS)/nitric oxide (NO) and various
  cytokines produced by the damaged cells eventually crosstalk with the bystander
  cells through various paths, causing damage to the cells. PGE2: prostaglandin E2;
  PRR: pattern recognition receptor.'
