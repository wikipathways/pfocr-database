caption: 'A schematic view of the sterol and SGA biosynthetic pathways. Dashed arrows
  represent multiple biosynthetic reactions whereas solid arrows represent a single
  step. Graphs next to each gene name show expression levels in wild-type (WT), two
  GAME9-Ox (lines 1:#6328 and 2:#6359) and two GAME9-RNAi lines (line 3:#6319 and
  4:#6355) determined by qRT-PCR. For genes where qRT-PCR data is not presented, it
  is due to technical reasons and differential expression awaits confirmation. According
  to RNA-Seq data, expression of SQS, TTS1, TTS2 and GAME2 was similar in GAME9-Ox
  and GAME9-RNAi tomato lines. For other genes, expression is represented based on
  RNA-Seq data, with arrows next to each gene depicting an increase (red) or decrease
  (blue) in GAME9-Ox and GAME9-RNAi lines, respectively. Values represent means±s.e.
  (n=3). Student''s t-test was used to assess whether the transgenic lines significantly
  differ from wild-type plants: *P value<0.05; **P value<0.01; ***P value<0.001.'
