caption: Model of JAM-A regulation of Hippo pathway signaling through extracellular
  adhesive interactionsJAM-A senses cell-cell contacts through dimerization at the
  TJ, resulting in outside-in signaling that triggers changes in the intracellular
  JAM-A scaffold complex. These changes likely affect JAM-A cytoplasmic contacts mediated
  through its PDZ-binding motif with ZO-2. This interaction recruits TJ scaffold proteins
  that can facilitate interaction between NF2 and LATS1. The formation of this complex
  will activate Hippo core kinases, including LATS1, to mediate downstream Hippo signaling
  in which YAP is phosphorylated and subsequently sequestered by 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm.
  This results in decreased YAP target gene transcription and suppression of proliferation
  (Left panel).When JAM-A is unable to dimerize, as in the case of the JAM-A-DL1 mutant,
  this signaling is lost. Subsequently, NF2 and LATS1 fail to be recruited to the
  TJ to activate Hippo signaling. Thus, YAP remains active, translocating to the nucleus,
  and interacts with TEAD to promote transcription of its pro-proliferative target
  genes, including EVI1 (Right panel).
