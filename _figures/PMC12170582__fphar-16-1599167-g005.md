caption: This figure illustrates the diverse neuroprotective effects of Rut and its
  underlying molecular mechanisms. Rut exhibits antidepressant effects by modulating
  the CA3 region and the HPA axis, as well as influencing GABA and GAD67. It demonstrates
  anticonvulsant properties through interactions with Glu, AMPA, NMDA receptors, and
  components like GluA1, GluA2, IL-1R1, and TLR4. Rut’s analgesic effects are linked
  to its interaction with CB1, CRIP1a, MAPK, and NF-κB pathways. The compound enhances
  neural signaling by regulating BDNF, GDNF, ERα, and ERβ. Additionally, rutin improves
  learning and memory skills via NGF, TrkA, TrkB, and CREB. The figure also highlights
  Rut’s role in protecting the BBB by modulating miR-124, MMP-9, BACE1, and APP. Furthermore,
  it shows Rut’s influence on GAD67 and Aβ in the context of neurological protection.
  Overall, this diagram provides a comprehensive overview of rutin’s multifaceted
  neuroprotective and neuromodulatory effects
