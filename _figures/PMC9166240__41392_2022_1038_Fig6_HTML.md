caption: The regulating mechanisms of SHP2 in various inflammatory diseases. SHP2
  plays a key role in the diverse inflammatory processes illustrated in the figure.
  SHP2 acts in many cellular signaling pathways in different cell types in inflammatory
  tissues. In neuroinflammation, SHP2 functions in neuron cells through involvements
  in the DIR/ERK, JAK/STAT3 and PINK/Parkin signaling pathways to regulate Aβ, tau,
  and LRKK2 accumulation, and inflammatory cytokine levels. In liver inflammation,
  SHP2 KO in liver resident macrophages or hepatocytes decreases liver inflammation
  by inhibiting IL-1β and IL-18 secretion and ROS production. In bone-related inflammatory
  disease, the different roles of SHP2 in T cells, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and
  fibroblasts lead to bone inflammations, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing
  spondylitis, and osteoarthritis. In diabetes, abnormal expression of SHP2 in macrophages
  leads to insulin resistance and metaflammation and further attacks on pancreatic
  β cells. SHP2 in T cells interacts with PD-1 involved in T1DM. SHP2 also mediates
  RAS/ERK activation and insulin receptor endocytosis that lead to insulin resistance.
  In inflammatory intestinal diseases, SHP2 interacts with CagA, activates the RAS/RAF/ERK
  signaling pathway, and inhibits STAT1 in epithelial cells. SHP2 in macrophages also
  regulates IL-10 and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in the intestine, thereby
  affecting nearby club cells and goblet cells. In inflammatory lung diseases, SHP2
  in lung epithelial cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and fibroblasts participates
  in lung inflammation by regulating the epithelial repair process, M2 polarization,
  neutrophil infiltration into lung tissue, and IFN-γ production. In skin inflammation,
  SHP2 activates fibroblasts, macrophage-mediated inflammation, T cells s and NETs
  formation that are responsible for skin inflammation. The figure is generated from
