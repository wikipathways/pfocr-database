caption: Schematic depicting the process underlying TOD-dependent muscle regeneration.
  Following injury, skeletal muscle experiences passive hypoxia, triggering enhanced
  anaerobic glycolysis in SCs. The regeneration of cytoplasmic NAD+ during this process
  acts as a substrate as activated PARP1, which then activates NF-κB through the phosphorylation
  of the p65 subunit at serine-536. This activation further promotes the expression
  of immunomodulator genes (e.g., Ccl2), aligning with a peak in neutrophil infiltration
  into the wounded site. This synchronization facilitates interactions between SCs
  and neutrophils, reciprocally enhancing SC proliferation and muscle repair efficiency.
  Given that the glycolysis pathway is regulated by the circadian clock, this signaling
  cascade contributes to variations in muscle repair efficacy depending on the TOD
