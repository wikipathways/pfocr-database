caption: TGF-β signalling is triggered through BMP or TGF-β ligands. Ligands bind
  the TGF-β receptor II (TGF-βR-II) which recruits and phosphorylates TGF-β receptor
  I (TGF-βR-I). In the TGF-β signalling pathway, TGF-βR-I phosphorylates the SMAD2
  and 3, or SMAD1, 5, and 8. The cofactor SMAD4 forms a heterotrimeric complex with
  SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/8. Activated SMAD complex, translocate into the nucleus interacting
  with transcription factors and modulating or repressing the gene transcription.
  Feedback regulation is mediated by inhibitory SMAD 6/7. Both SMAD6 and SMAD7 are
  in turn induced by TGF-β receptors and regulated through the help of SMAD ubiquitination
  regulatory factors (Smurfs) 1 and 2.
