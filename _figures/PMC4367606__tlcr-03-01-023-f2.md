caption: 'Tumor cell ligands recognized by human γδ T cells. Left panel, IPP is an
  intermediate metabolite produced through the mevalonate/cholesterol production pathway
  in mammalian cells. Pharmacological agents that can block upstream (statins) or
  downstream (aminobisphosphonate) this pathway lead to decreased or increased intracellular
  IPP levels, respectively. Endogenous IPP accumulation is observed in diverse tumor
  cells; IPP metabolites can be converted into ApppI, which could then be presented
  at the cell surface with much higher affinity to γδ TCR than IPP. Right panel, in
  pathogen-infected cells (e.g., mycobacterial infection), bacterial HMB-PP, or HDMAPP
  produced through the DOXP pathway could be presented. Abbreviations: IPP, isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate; TCR, T cell receptor; HMB-PP, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate;
  HDMAPP, 4-hydroxy-3-dimethylallyl pyrophosphate.'
