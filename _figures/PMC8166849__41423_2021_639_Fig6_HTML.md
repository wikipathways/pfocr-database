caption: The Nrf2 activation pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is found in the
  cytoplasm bound to the inhibitory protein Keap1, and protein levels are kept low
  through a ubiquitin-dependent degradation mechanism. During oxidative stress and
  the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), structural restriction of the Keap1
  protein complex stimulates the release of Nrf2 and its subsequent translocation
  into the nucleus. Sestrin 2 (sesn2) is also induced by oxidative stress and facilitates
  the autophagic degradation of Keap1 to ensure Nrf2 activation. Within the nucleus,
  Nrf2 functions as a strong transcriptional activator of antioxidant response elements
  (AREs) in the promoter segments of corresponding genes. Itaconate can alkylate cysteine
  residues on Keap1, allowing Nrf2 to accumulate in the cytoplasm, translocate to
  the nucleus, and increase the expression of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory genes
