caption: Putative pathway for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. According
  to the beta-amyloid hypothesis, the production of beta-amyloid represents the first
  step in the entire process following the sequential cleavage of APP by β-secretase
  and γ-secretase. Beta-amyloid in turn may lead to NFT formation and eventual cell
  death by promoting oxidative stress and caspase activation through initiation of
  the mitochondrial-mediated pathway of apoptosis. The activation of caspases results
  in cleavage of critical cellular proteins including tau, leading to its modification
  and hyperphosphorylation, a key prerequisite for filament formation. See main text
  for details.
