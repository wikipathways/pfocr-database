caption: (a) Upregulation of ALC, associated to β-oxidation of fatty acids, (b) NAD-induced
  pathway alterations and other alterations only induced by PC-3S cells. 3PG– 3-phoshogluconate,
  αKG– α-ketoglutarate, β-Ala– β-Alanine, ALC—acetyl L-carnitine, Asp—aspartate, CAT—Carnitine
  acetyltransferase, CoASH—reduced co-enzyme A, Cys-Gly—cysteinylglycine, DMG—Dimethylglycine,
  FA Acyl-Coa—fatty acid acyl-CoA, Hcy—homocysteine, Gly—glycine, GSH—glutathione
  reduced, Glu—glutamate, Met—methionine, OAA—oxaloacetate, PDH—pyruvate dehydrogenase,
  Pyr—pyruvate, ROS—reactive oxygen species, Ser—serine, Thr—threonine, RM—control
  HUVECs, VEGF—HUVECs treated with VEGF, S—HUVECs co-cultured with PC-3S. Peak area
  = Peak area×105 (A.U. per 106 cells).
