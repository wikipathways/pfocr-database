caption: A diagram of the BR signal transduction pathways. In the absence of BR, BRI1
  is inactive, and BIN2 phosphorylates BZR1 and BZR2/BES1 and targets them for degradation
  by the proteasome. BR binding to the cell-surface receptor BRI1 activates BRI1 kinase
  and leads to inhibition of the BIN2 kinase, allowing dephosphorylation and accumulation
  of BZR1 and BZR2/BES1 proteins in the nucleus. BZR2/BES1 activates BR-induced genes
  and growth responses. BZR1 mediates BR-regulated gene expression to confer growth
  response and feedback regulation of BR biosynthesis.

  regulator of the brassinosteroid signaling pathway in Arabidopsis.
