caption: Steroid interconversion and their receptors. The steroids investigated in
  the present study are underlined, shown alongside the receptors through which they
  exert their rapid effects. All neuroactive steroids are produced from pregnenolone,
  which can be converted to progesterone by 3β‐hydroxysteroid hydrogenase (3β‐HSD),
  or sulphated to pregnenolone sulphate, which positively modulates NMDA receptor
  (NMDA‐R) signalling. Progesterone can subsequently be converted to deoxycorticosterone
  (DOC) then corticosterone, and both target glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid
  receptors (GR and MR, respectively). Progesterone and DOC can also undergo 5α‐reduction
  to respectively form dihydroprogesterone (DHP), which has a greater affinity for
  the progesterone receptor (PR), or dihydrodeoxycorticosterone (DHDOC), which modulates
  GABAA receptors (GABAAR). Following a further 3α‐hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α‐HSD)
  reduction, the 5α,3α‐reduced steroids, allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone
  (THDOC) are formed, both of which are positive modulators of the GABAAR. Progesterone
  can be converted to androgens by a two‐step pathway, catalysed by the 17‐hydroxylase
  and 17,20‐lyase activities of a single enzyme, cytochrome P450c17. Dihydrotestosterone
  (DHT), which has more potent effects on the androgen receptor (AR) compared to testosterone,
  is produced from testosterone via 5α‐reduction or from a ‘backdoor pathway’ without
  the need for testosterone production. DHT is subsequently reduced to form 3α‐androstanediol
  (3α‐diol) and 3β‐androstanediol (3β‐diol). Although 3α‐diol potentiates GABAA receptors,
  3β‐diol is likely to exert its rapid effects through the oestrogen receptor β (ERβ).
  Lastly, testosterone can be converted to 17β‐oestradiol via the actions of aromatase
