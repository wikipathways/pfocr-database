caption: NOX4-related mechanisms in thyroid carcinogenesis. Mutations in the proto-oncogene
  BRAF increase NOX4 expression through the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway leading to constitutive
  MAPK activation and a decrease in thyroid-specific genes. H-RAS oncogenic mutations
  increase NOX4-mediated H2O2 production and thyrocyte survival. Energy deficiency
  induces AMPK which in turn inhibits NOX4 activity. Hypoxia leads to the stabilization
  of the transcription factor HIF-1α. HIF-1α induces NOX4 expression and reduces mitochondrial
  ROS production. ROS produced by NOX4 and the mitochondria increases HIF-1α activity
  providing a feed-back loop to mitigate ROS-induced cell damage. Mitochondrial ROS
  also activates AMPK (not shown on the scheme). NOX4-derived H2O2 exerts its effects
  in direct and indirect ways in various cell compartments. Taken together, these
  different pathways interact and mediate different aspects of thyroid carcinogenesis,
  most notably thyrocyte dedifferentiation, enhanced cell proliferation and survival,
  a metabolic switch towards glycolysis and an inhibition of mitochondrial ROS.
