caption: a | While capturing antigen, intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) are exposed
  to microbial Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and epithelial-cell-derived cytokines,
  including thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). These signals promote the generation
  of tiDCs, which are DCs that express tumour-necrosis factor and inducible nitric
  oxide synthase; these cells present antigen to CD4+ T cells in the perifollicular
  area of Peyer’s patches. In addition, tiDCs transfer antigen to follicular IgM+IgD+
  naive B cells and induce them to upregulate the expression of TGFβ1 receptor (TGFβR)
  through nitric oxide (NO). During cognate interactions with CD4+ T cells, B cells
  undergo IgA class-switch recombination (CSR) in response to CD40 ligand (CD40L)
  and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1) from activated T cells. IgA expression
  requires interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-6 and IL-10 from activated T cells, as well as
  B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) from
  tiDCs. After being imprinted by retinoic acid (RA) from DCs, IgA+ effector B cells
  migrate to the lamina propria, where they differentiate into IgA-secreting plasma
  cells. This differentiation is enhanced by APRIL secreted by epithelial cells, DCs
  and tiDCs. b | After sensing microorganisms via TLRs, epithelial cells from intestinal
  villi release APRIL, thereby triggering direct IgA CSR in lamina-propria IgM+ B
  cells and sequential IgA2 CSR in lamina-propria IgA1+ B cells in a T-cell-independent
  manner. This pathway may also involve APRIL, BAFF and TGFβ1 from DCs and tiDCs exposed
  to microbial TLR ligands, NO and TSLP. Epithelial cells, DCs and tiDCs promote plasma-cell
  differentiation via APRIL, BAFF, IL-6 and IL-10. BCMA, B-cell maturation antigen;
  FAE, follicle-associated epithelium; M cell, microfold cell; pIgR, polymeric immunoglobulin
  receptor; SED, subepithelial dome; sIgA, secreted IgA; TACI, transmembrane activator
  and calcium-modulating cyclophilin-ligand interactor.
