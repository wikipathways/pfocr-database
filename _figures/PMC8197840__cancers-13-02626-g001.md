caption: Mechanism of action of immune checkpoint inhibitors (antibodies that target
  CTLA4, PD1, or PDL1) in the HCC tumour microenvironment, where chronic inflammation
  and cirrhosis lead to immune exhaustion. Exhausted T cells have a reduced capacity
  to produce cytokines, to proliferate, and to kill tumour cells; tumour growth is
  facilitated by blockade of signalling resulting from interaction of the T-cell receptor
  (TCR) with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Key actionable drivers of
  immune exhaustion in HCC are the PD1–PDL1 pathway and CTLA4 signalling, and blockade
  of these pathways (i.e., immune checkpoint inhibition) enhances the immune reaction
  against the tumour cells [,]. (Adapted from Giannini et al. 2019 [].)
