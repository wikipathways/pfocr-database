caption: Dysregulation of nitric oxide signaling pathway and development of cardiovascular
  disease in CKD patients. In CKD, the kidney is not functioning properly due to dysregulation
  of nitric oxide signaling. (A) Dysregulation of nitric oxide inhibits ApoA1 lipoprotein
  metabolism, and accumulation of HDL causes hyperlipidemia, which inhibits endothelial-dependent
  relaxation of the blood vessel and causes atherosclerosis. (B) Dysregulation of
  nitric oxide inhibits sodium ion reabsorption in different parts of the nephron,
  which causes sodium ion retention and creates volume overload and hypertension.
  (C) Excess nitric oxide combined with superoxide (O2−) forms peroxynitrite, which
  causes damage to the myocyte membrane and causes reperfusion-induced myocardial
  injury. (D) Chronic kidney infection can lead to an accumulation of endotoxins.
  These endotoxins trigger the release of inflammatory molecules, which in turn stimulate
  the production of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide can vasodilate and reduce blood pressure(hypotension).
  This can result in reduced heart function and cause myocardial depression and septic
  shock
