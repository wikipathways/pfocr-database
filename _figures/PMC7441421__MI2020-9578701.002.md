caption: Signaling pathways mediated by CTHRC1 involved in the progression and metastasis
  of tumor. (1) TGF-β signaling pathway is quite complex, especially in terms of its
  effects, which are often contradictory depending on location and time. There exists
  a critical negative feedback regulatory loop between TGF-β-smad2/3 signaling pathway
  and CTHRC1. (2) WNT signaling includes WNT/β-catenin canonical pathway and β-catenin-independent
  noncanonical pathway. In the canonical WNT signaling, Fzd receptor and LRP5/LRP6
  coreceptor are transduced to β-catenin signaling cascade for the maintenance of
  stem and progenitor cells. In the noncanonical WNT signaling, Fzd receptor and ROR2/PTK7/RYK
  coreceptor are transduced to RhoA, JNK signaling cascades for the control of tissue
  polarity, cell adhesion, or cell movement. The downstream molecules of the WNT/PCP
  pathway mainly include the small GTPase family, such as Rac1, RhoA, and JNK, which
  play essential roles in cancer cell migration and invasion. (3) CTHRC1 signal via
  WAIF1 can activate PKCδ, which is an essential component of the WNT/PCP pathway.
  Furthermore, PKCδ is responsible for the activation of the CTHRC1-induced ERK signaling
  pathway. (4) In CTHRC1/integrin β signaling pathway, the upregulation of CTHRC1
  is related to the progression and metastasis of several cancers through the activation
  of several key signaling molecules, including Src, FAK, paxillin, MEK, ERK, and
  Rac1. FAK promotes cancer cell migration by regulating focal adhesion formation
  and turnover, which involve activation of Src and paxillin. FRA-1 is activated by
  CTHRC1 through the MAPK/MEK/ERK signaling, which leads to the upregulation of cyclin
  D1 and that promotes cell proliferation. FRA-1 also induces snail1-mediated MMP14
  expression to facilitate ESCC cell invasion, migration, and metastasis. PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway induces EMT change and MMP2/MMP9 expression. (5) HIF-1α and VEGF
  are activated by CTHRC1 through activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway,
  which promotes tumor angiogenesis. CTHRC1 also participates in tumor cell migration
  and invasion through HIF-1α/CXCR4 signals.
