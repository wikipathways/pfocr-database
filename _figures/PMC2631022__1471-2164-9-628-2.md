caption: KEGG Focal adhesion pathway enriched by human switch-like genes. Nodes enriched
  for human bimodal genes are colored orange, while nodes also identified as bimodal
  in mouse orthologs are outlined in bold. In all, the overlap between human and mouse
  orthologs contains twenty-two unique genes represented in nine unique nodes in the
  focal adhesion pathway. Nodes colored in gray were not identified as bimodal, while
  white nodes are used for genes that are not represented on the HGU133A array.

  mechanisms for bimodality.
