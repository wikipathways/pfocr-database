caption: Novel acylations participate in head and neck cancer metastasis. In OSCC,
  Khib upregulation in multiple proteins are correlated with the actin cytoskeleton
  regulatory pathway, and thereby increasing the aggregation and stability of actin;
  EGFR palmitoylation promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OSCC
  cells. In HNSCC, most Kcr regulators, such as DPF2, KAT2B, and HDAC2–3 are significantly
  dysregulated, which are closely correlated with the progression of HNSCC. In TC,
  Ksuc regulates the synthesis of T3 and T4, and improves the TG affinity for membrane
  receptors; SDH participates in the modulation of Ksuc, thus promoting TC metastasis
  as a result. (Created with BioRender.com.)
