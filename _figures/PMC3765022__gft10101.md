caption: Proposed mechanisms by which AKI induces cytoresistance against further ischemic
  or toxic insults. Four pathways by which AKI can initiate renal resistance are presented.
  The most prominently mentioned in the literature is AKI-initiated stress protein
  production, particularly within the HSP family (far right). Most notable are the
  induction of HSP 70/72 and HSP-32 (more commonly referred to as ‘HO-1’). In addition,
  recent work has revealed that AKI can initiate a ‘renal hepatization’ response,
  leading to the activation of the albumin, alpha fetoprotein, haptoglobin and hemopexin
  genes within proximal tubule cells. Since these four genes are typically active
  only in the liver, this ‘renal hepatization’ response suggests that injured proximal
  tubules assume features of an hepatic phenotype (up-regulation of normally silent
  genes in the kidney). Because each of these four proteins can exert cytoprotective
  and/or anti-inflammatory effects, they may contribute to the cytoresistant state.
  AKI can also impact lipid, and not just ‘stress protein’ expression. For example,
  AKI activates the HMG CoA reductase pathway, leading to increased cholesterol content
  within proximal tubule cell membranes. This decreases membrane fluidity, and thus
  protects the membrane from rupture during the evolution of necrotic cell death.
  Activation of the sphingomyelinase (SMase) may also occur, leading to the production
  of cytoprotective sphingosine and sphingosine-1 phosphate. Additional protective
  pathways include a suppression of nephrotoxin uptake due to decreased brush border
  and OAT/cation transport pathways. Independent of cytoprotectve protein and lipid
  synthesis, uremia, per se, may confer cytoprotection via the retention of low-molecular
  ‘uremic compounds' that possess cytoprotective properties. Finally, uremia is associated
  with an increase in solute loads per nephron (due to a decrease in functional nephrons,
  thereby increasing the loads of urea, NaCl, etc. per nephron). Thus, this imposes
  a relative solute diuresis per functional nephron, potentially decreasing cast formation.
  In concert, these factors act to initiate and maintain a cytoresistant state.
