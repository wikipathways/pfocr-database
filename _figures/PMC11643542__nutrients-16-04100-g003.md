caption: 'Dietary polyphenols can inhibit the NF-κB pathway, which is activated in
  inflammatory conditions, thereby suppressing the generation of inflammatory cytokines
  and inhibiting STAT3. The NF-κB pathway suppresses apoptosis; hence, the polyphenol
  method induces apoptosis in leukemic cells. NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa B'
