caption: 'Biochemical schematics: This figure maybe regarded as the biochemical underpinning
  of our model. (Such figures are sometimes informally called “wiring diagrams” or
  “network diagrams”.) For example, benign cells express the wild type p53, which
  in its turn inhibits the transcription factor SP1 from initiating TGF α expression.
  Hence the blunt arrow leading from p53 to Sp1. No such inhibition is possible from
  the mutant p53 and hence is not shown in the figure or included in the model. Similarly,
  the double arrows express the fact that both cell types will secrete TGFα and in
  turn are influenced by this growth factor. The pathway from TGFα to the ECM proteins
  is really a schematic for the cell production of the matrix metallo-protein, which
  in its turn degrades the ECM via “standard” enzyme kinetics. Such diagrams, popular
  in the biochemical and molecular biology community, contain the seeds of systems
  of differential equations that begin with a consideration of the Law of Mass Action.
  In this sense, our model is in the spirit of [] where the authors modeled the citric
  acid cycle in order to predict the onset of solid tumor growth in the micro environment.'
