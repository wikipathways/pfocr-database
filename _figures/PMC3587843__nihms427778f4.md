caption: 'mTORC1 modulates cell response (cell growth and proliferation) to nutrients
  and is a key suppressor of autophagy. An adequate level of amino acids, glucose
  and growth factors is required for its activation (black arrows). Lipids (green)
  and lipid enzymes (yellow) play a major role in mediating the regulation of mTORC1.
  In the presence of nutrients and mitogens, class I PI3K product PI(3,4,5)P3 indirectly
  activates mTORC1, however, in absence of nutrients (purple arrows) mTORC1 signaling
  is shut down and several lipids (e.g., PI3P, PA, DAG, SPH-1-P) act as positive modulators
  of autophagy. Specifically, SPH-1-P produced by SK1 contributes to mTORC1 inhibition,
  whereas PI3P, PA and DAG produced by Class III PI3K, PLD1 and PAP, respectively,
  act downstream (or independently) of mTORC1 and mediate signaling and membrane remodelling
  to support autophagy activation. Both PI3P and PA have an antagonistic role on mTORC1
  regulation: amino acid re-addition after nutrient withdrawal (light purple lane)
  stimulates PI3P production and activation of PLD1. Locally synthesized PA, binds
  directly to mTORC1 and contributes to its recruitment back to the lysosomes and
  recovery of the signaling. Under normal growth conditions (black lane), ceramide
  upregulation activates autophagy through the downregulation of nutrient (amino acids,
  glucose) transporters and inhibition of upstream mTORC1 signaling (Akt/PKB). The
  product of lipid kinase PIKfyve, PI(3,5)P2, binds to mTORC1 and participates to
  its reactivation in presence of insulin (pink lane) and amino-acids re-addition
  (light purple lane).'
