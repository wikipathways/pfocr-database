caption: Overview of polyamine biosynthesis and dietary sources related to the polyamine
  pathway. Polyamines come from exogenous sources (mainly the diet), or they can be
  biosynthesized in the cell. Putrescine is synthesized after arginine is converted
  into ornithine via the urea cycle. Ornithine is then decarboxylated by the rate-limiting
  enzyme in polyamine synthesis, ODC. The addition of a propylamine group to putrescine
  gives rise to spermidine. This propylamine group is donated by dcSAM via spermidine
  synthase. Spermidine can be subsequently propylaminated by spermine synthase to
  make spermine. Spermine can be recycled back to spermidine and eventually putrescine
  via PAO. The polyamine cycle is closely tied to the Met cycle via SAM (). SAM is
  derived from adding an adenosine group to Met and can be decarboxylated by SAM decarboxylase
  to form dcSAM, which is vital for polyamine biosynthesis. SAM can also be demethylated
  to SAH, hCys, and eventually recycled to Met. Met can also be derived from the diet.
  The conversion of hCys to Met is a required coreaction to the 5-methyl THF to THF.
  This is the link between folate and Met cycles. THF can go on to purine synthesis
  or be converted to 5,10-methyl THF for pyramidine synthesis. Like Met, THF can be
  derived from the diet. However, dietary folate must first be converted to DHF and
  then to THF. dcSAM, decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine; DHF, dihydrofolate; hCys,
  homocysteine; Met, methionine; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; PAO, polyamine oxidase;
  SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; THF, tetrahydrofolate.
