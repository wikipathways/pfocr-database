caption: Schematic of HER-2 structure, activation, and signalling. (a) HER-2 is a
  single transmembrane cell surface receptor with extracellular, transmembrane, and
  intracellular regions. The extracellular region comprises of two ligand-binding
  domains (L I and L II) and two cysteine-rich domains (C I and C II) []. Intracellularly,
  HER-2 receptors have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (TK). (b) HER-2 does not
  bind ligands but is activated by forming heterodimers with other ErbB receptors
  via interaction at the cysteine-rich domains. This results in autophosphorylation
  of the tyrosine kinase domains and induction of downstream signalling. Normal signalling
  includes stimulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway which induces survival mechanisms and
  inhibits apoptosis, whilst the RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK pathway stimulates cell proliferation
  [].
