caption: Regulation of one-carbon (1C) metabolism in cancer. Serine and glycine are
  transported into the cell or synthesized in the cell and serve as input molecules
  for 1C metabolism. Serine is synthesized from the glycolytic intermediate, 3-phosphoglycerate,
  via the de novo serine biosynthetic pathway (SSP) and glycine can be synthesized
  from serine via serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) in the cytoplasm or SHMT2
  in the mitochondria. Upregulation of the SSP in cancer occurs via cMyc, Nrf2, and
  ATF4. Upregulation of the mitochondrial isoform SHMT2 occurs in cancer via hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1α (HIF-1α) and mutant KRAS-dependent pathways. Serine and glycine can both
  enter the early part of 1C metabolism, the folate cycle, although cancer cells tend
  to preferentially utilize serine over glycine. Upon entering the folate cycle, serine
  and glycine can donate 1C units to tetrahydrofolate (THF) to form 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
  (me-THF). From there, one of three transformations can occur that lead to thymidylate
  synthesis, purine synthesis, or methionine synthesis via the coupling of the methionine
  synthase (MTR) reaction to conversion of homocysteine (hCYS) to form methionine
  (MET). The latter connects the folate cycle to the methionine cycle. The methionine
  cycle can be used to generate glutathione, proteins, and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM),
  all of which are important for cancer cell growth. ATP; adenosine tripihosphate,
