caption: 'CTLA-4 pathway inhibition. The antitumor immune response is initiated by
  the uptake and processing of tumor protein antigens by APCs, which subsequently
  activate T cells. T-cell activation requires two steps: first, the presentation
  of antigenic peptides on the surface of APCs in conjunction with MHC molecules to
  naïve T cells expressing the appropriate TCR, and second, costimulatory interaction
  between the CD80/CD86 ligands on APCs and the CD28 receptor on T cells (A). Expressed
  on the surface of T cells after activation, CTLA-4 delivers an inhibitory signal
  to the T cell by outcompeting the CD28 receptor for binding to CD80/CD86 (B). CTLA-4
  blockade may remove this inhibitory signal and stimulate antitumor immunity (C).Abbreviations:
  APC, antigen-presenting cell; CTLA-4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4; MHC, major
  histocompatibility complex; TCR, T-cell receptor.'
