caption: Temozolomide function and activated DNA repair pathway. Temozolomide (TMZ)
  is chemically converted to MTIC (5-3-(methyltriazen-1-yl) imidazole-4-carboximide)
  at physiologic pH and degrades to a methyldiazonium cation, which transfers a methyl
  group to DNA. The most common site of methylation is N7-MeG (60–80%) followed by
  N3-MeA (10–20%) and O6-MeG (5–10%). When active MGMT is present, O6-MeG is repaired
  without cytotoxicity. When MGMT is inactivated or does not have the potential to
  completely repair O6-MeG, unrepaired O6-MeG is continuously repaired by the futile
  cycle of MMR, which ultimately induces cell death by provoking double-strand breaks
  (DSB). When MMR does not function properly, genomic instability is amplified. N7-MeG
  and N3-MeA is repaired by BER. If not repaired, alkylated bases cause a replication
  stall and collapse of the replication fork, generating single-strand breaks (SSBs),
  which ultimately induce DSB. It is possible that SSB and DSB repair pathways are
  activated and diminish the cytotoxic effects of TMZ.
