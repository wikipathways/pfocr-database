caption: A) Axl expression can be elevated by TGFβ and epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT)
  transcription factors. Axl in turn regulates the expression of EMT markers through
  the PI3K/Akt pathway. Gas6-stimulated Axl activation can also induce EMT transcription
  factors. Axl-induced Elmo activation can increase the expression of Rac. Finally,
  Axl activation can enhance the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). B)
  Axl can be upregulated in cancer cells after therapy and help cancer cells gain
  resistance through the regulation of homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA
  repair, cell plasticity, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) nuclear translocation,
  and CDC2 dephosphorylation. C) Axl on tumor cells can regulate PD-L1 expression
  through the PI3K/Akt pathway and MHC1 expression through STAT1. Axl activation on
  tumor cells and immune cells, such as NK cells, also leads to an immunosuppressive
  cytokine and chemokines profile, which results in increased M2 macrophages, and
  decreased T cells and DCs in the tumor microenvironment.
