caption: Potential pharmacological agent for breast cancer therapies. This schematic
  diagram illustrates Zoledronic acid (ZOL) and Epilgallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)
  obstructing breast cancer progression and metastasis by targeting CCN1 and CCN5
  proteins. ZOL, DEX and EGCG play significant roles in inhibiting breast tumor formation,
  proliferation and metastasis. ZOL inhibits the CCN1 protein expression through FOXO3a
  activation in the Triple Negative Breast Cancer. DEX reestablished the CCN5 expression,
  which can block the TGF-β signaling pathway associated with EMT and induce metastasis
  suppressor protein Nm23-H1 in the ER-negative breast cancer and the EGCG from green
  tea, suppresses the CCN5 protein expression in the Triple Negative Breast Cancer.
