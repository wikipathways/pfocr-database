caption: Mechanisms in microglial activation and neuroinflammation triggered by periodontal
  pathogens. Upon reaching the brain, periodontal pathogens and/or their toxins induce
  a transition of microglia from a quiescent state to an activated state. LPS can
  bind to TLR receptors on the cell membrane, starting CatB to facilitate IL-1β production
  through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Periodontal pathogens and OMVs may enter microglia
  via endocytosis, stimulating the caspase-1 production and IL-1β release through
  activating NLRP3 inflammasome, while CatB is also involved in NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation. Furthermore, gingipains derived from periodontal pathogens, upon binding
  to PAR2, could potentially contribute to releasing IL-6 and TNF-α through the PI3K/AKT
  and ERK pathways. As a result, microglia release an array of inflammatory mediators
  and complement C1q, inducing neuroinflammation. Created with BioRender.com
