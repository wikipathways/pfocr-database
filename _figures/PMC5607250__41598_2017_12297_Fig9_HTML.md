caption: Predicted regulation relationships between differentially expressed miRNAs
  and target genes based on KEGG pathway. 79 differentially expressed miRNAs, 12 target
  genes annotated in mammary gland development/lactation and 41 KEGG pathways were
  selected to construct the network, comprising 132 nodes and 170 edges. The square
  frame with red colour presents target genes, the pink circle presents miRNAs, the
  green rhombus presents KEGG pathway, the blue line presents a regulatory relationship
  between miRNAs and target genes, and the red line presents the target genes involves
  in the KEGG pathway.
