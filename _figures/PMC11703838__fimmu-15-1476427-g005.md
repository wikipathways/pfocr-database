caption: Crosstalk between TCSCs and immune cells. (A) TCSCs release immunomodulatory
  substances (CCL2, CCL15, and CSF 1) and metabolites (e.g., lactate) that promote
  macrophage recruitment and M2-like TAM polarization. TCSCs can also avoid being
  phagocytosed by macrophages by expressing CD47. TAM secretes wnt1 and wnt3a, which
  promote TCSCs’ ability to proliferate. (B) TCSCs release SCF to attract c-kit-expressing
  MCs into the TME, while MCs emit TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 to support TCSCs’ self-renewal
  ability, stem cell markers, and the EMT process for TC invasion and development.
  (C) TCSCs evade recognition and attack by CD8 + T lymphocytes either through immune
  checkpoints (MHC-I and PD-L1) or by secreting SIGLEC15. The acetylcholine produced
  by nerves acts on TCSCs to up-regulate the expression of PD-L1 and further inhibits
  the function of CD8+ T cells by competing for nutrients and the accumulation of
  metabolites, thereby promoting the self-renewal and immune escape of TCSCs. (D)
  Metabolites from TCSCs serve as substrates to increase CAF’s TCA cycling activity,
  which effectively sustains TCSCs’ high energy flux absorption. By regulating the
  JAK/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, CAF encourages the growth and invasiveness
  of TCSCs
