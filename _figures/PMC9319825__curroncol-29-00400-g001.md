caption: Androgen Synthesis and Mechanism of Action. (A) Gonadotropin-releasing hormone
  (GnRH) is typically released from the hypothalamus in a pulsatile fashion to signal
  the anterior pituitary to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing
  hormone (LH), which then signal the gonads to produce testosterone through the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal
  (HPG) axis and is responsible for 90% of the body’s testosterone production (represented
  by T in the figure). GnRH also signals the pituitary to release adrenocorticotropin-releasing
  hormone (ACTH) to signal the adrenal glands to produce androgens. Chemical androgen
  deprivation therapy (ADT) consists of GnRH agonists or antagonists, which inhibit
  these pathways. The production of testosterone itself involves the conversion of
  steroid precursor molecules into testosterone in part by the enzyme cyp17. Abiraterone
  is an androgen receptor-axis targeted agent (ARAT) that works by inhibiting this
  enzyme and, ultimately, androgen production. (B) Testosterone, as steroid molecules,
  typically then diffuses through the cell membrane into the prostate cancer cell,
  where they are converted by 5-alpha-reductase into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which
  then binds to the intracellular androgen receptor (AR). This receptor complex then
  migrates into the nucleus and is involved in transcription and translation of genes
  involved in cell growth and division. Chemotherapy such as docetaxel and cabazitaxel
  exert their effects by interfering with the cell cycle, growth, and division. Enzalutamide,
  Apalutamide, and Daralutamide are ARATS that work by inhibiting binding of DHT to
  AR, translocation to the nucleus, and transcription of genes. Acquired resistance
  to this pathway can develop when other mutations occur. When the androgen receptor
  is mutated, such as the AR-V7 splice variant, it is able to exert its effects on
  cell growth independent of androgen binding and is also resistant to binding of
  competitive inhibitors such as enzalutamide. The androgen receptor pathway is also
  inversely related to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, such that inhibition of one often
  leads to upregulation of the other via acquired mutations. PTEN and mTOR inhibitors
  were investigated as possible drug targets for prostate cancer. The AKT inhibitor,
  Ipatasertib, showed some activity and potential benefit in prostate cancer in combination
  with abiraterone.
