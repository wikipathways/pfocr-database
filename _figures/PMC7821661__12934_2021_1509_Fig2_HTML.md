caption: 'Comparison of glycolate bioproduction pathways from substrates of interest.
  a Glycolate can be bioproduced from a variety of different substrates, including
  (i) xylose, (ii) glucose and (iii) ethylene glycol (EG). Xylose and glucose are
  the two most commonly studied substrates; however, glycolate production from these
  substrates is limited by the interconnectedness of the growth and production pathways,
  as indicated by their topology and low orthogonality scores. Consequently, efficient
  production of glycolate from either of these compounds necessitates the coupling
  of growth and glycolate synthesis. Alternatively, EG assimilation lends itself to
  a branched topology that permits the decoupling of glycolate synthesis and cell
  growth (high orthogonality score). b Although Escherichia coli (E. coli) cannot
  naturally assimilate EG, the conversion of EG to glycolate can be introduced via
  the overexpression of a mutant propanediol oxidoreductase (encoded by fucO) and
  glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase (encoded by aldA). The subsequent conversion of glycolate
  to glyoxylate provides a branch point that serves as a metabolic valve. Under fully
  aerobic conditions, glycolate is converted to glyoxylate and channeled to the central
  metabolism for growth via glycerate metabolism. Alternatively, under oxygen limiting
  conditions glycolate accumulates. Oxygen can thus be used for dynamic control of
  this metabolic valve, thereby decoupling the production of glycolate and biomass.
