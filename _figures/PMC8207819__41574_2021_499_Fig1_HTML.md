caption: Apoptosis represents a non-inflammatory pathway that is mediated by caspases
  (part a). Two distinct signalling pathways of apoptosis, extrinsic and intrinsic
  apoptosis, have been characterized. While apoptosis depends on the activation of
  caspases, necroptosis is mediated by kinases (part b). Dependent on its RHIM domain,
  RIPK3 forms an amyloid-like structure referred to as the necrosome, the central
  signalling platform of necroptosis. Therein, RIPK3 phosphorylates the pseudokinase
  MLKL. By unknown mechanisms, the phosphorylated form of MLKL (pMLKL) triggers plasma
  membrane rupture, a process that was demonstrated to be counteracted by the membrane
  repair ESCRT-III complex. In contrast to apoptosis and necroptosis, inflammasomes
  are involved in the initiation of cell death by pyroptosis (part c). The activation
  of caspases (1, 4, 11) in inflammasomes results in the cleavage of pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18
  and gasdermin D (GSDMD). Finally, and without any clear connection to apoptosis,
  necroptosis and pyroptosis, ferroptosis is a failsafe rather than a typical cell
  death pathway (part d). In cellular homeostasis, H2O2 concentrations of iron-catalysed
  and Fenton reactions are limited by diverse cellular anti-redox systems. Glutathione
  peroxidase 4 (GPX4) prevents lipid peroxidation that otherwise leads to plasma membrane
  rupture by unknown mechanisms. By contrast, the oxidoreductase FSP1 (also known
  as AIFM2) prevents lipid peroxidation upon myristoylation-dependent recruitment
  to the plasma membrane in a GSH-independent manner. casp, caspase; DAMP, damage-associated
  molecular pattern; DD, death domain; DED, death effector domain; ER, endoplasmic
