caption: Relevant steps of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) biosynthesis are
  indicated. After the deficient step (1.), normal LLO/protein bound oligosaccharides
  are depicted in black, white and grey whereas the biosynthetic pathway of the tetrasaccharide
  is in color. 1. Deficiency of the ALG1 catalyzed mannosylation causes the accumulation
  of GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol and lack of Man-GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol. 2. The GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol is flipped
  to the inside of the ER, presumably by the RFT1-encoded “flippase”. 3. The GlcNAc2-Dol
  serves as a donor substrate for the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) forming N-linked
  chitobiose. 4. The chitobiosylated protein is recognized by a β1,4-galactosyltransferase
  (GalT) in Golgi forming Gal-GlcNAc2-protein. 5. The structure is finalized by the
  addition of NeuAc by the action of a sialyltransferase (SiaT).
