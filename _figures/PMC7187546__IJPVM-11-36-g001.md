  effects of cocaine by activating the TNF-α receptor (TNFR)/JNK/Bcl-2-Beclin1 or
  TNFR/Bcl-2/Bax signaling pathway and cell death caused by it. Melatonin receptor
  activation by both melatonin and ramelteon also causes mitochondrial biogenesis
  activation and may cause direct inhibition of JNK/Bcl-2-Beclin1 or JNK/Bcl-2/Bax
  signaling pathways, which may reduce apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation.
