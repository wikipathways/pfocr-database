caption: Inbound virions bind to the cell membrane via poorly characterized receptors
  (a), are captured in vesicles by a clathrin-mediated pathway (b), and delivered
  to endosomes, where a pH-dependent fusion of the particles with the endosome membrane
  occurs (c). Subsequent to uncoating, the single stranded, positive sense genome
  (d) migrates to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is translated (e) as a polyprotein
  traversing the ER membrane several times (f). The polyprotein is cleaved into the
  viral proteins by viral and cellular proteases, although prM and E remain covalently
  attached. Through the agency of several viral nonstructural proteins and cellular
  proteins, there is a proliferation of ER-derived membranes and the formation of
  spherules which maintain a pore-like connection to the cytoplasm (g); the viral
  genome is replicated within these spherules by the viral proteins comprising the
  replication complex. By an as yet uncharacterized mechanism, progeny genomes are
  delivered to adjacent ER membranes where the capsid protein mediates assembly and
  inclusion of prM-E into immature virions (h). The immature virions transit the Golgi
  membrane system (i) and as a mild pH change occurs, the cellular enzyme furin cleaves
  the prM-E linkage (j) allowing the virus particle to assume its final mature stage
  prior to release from the cell (k). Defined roles for the individual viral proteins
  are enumerated in .
