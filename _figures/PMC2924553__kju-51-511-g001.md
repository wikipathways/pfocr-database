caption: 'BMP signal transduction. BMP signaling is transduced by both type I and
  type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. BMPs bind to the heteromeric
  complex of type I and type II receptors. Subsequently, type II receptor phosphorylates
  type I receptor, which in turn facilitates phosphorylation of R-Smads (Smad1, 5,
  and 8). R-Smads directly interact with activated type I receptor and are released
  upon phosphorylation. Following the release from the receptor complex, R-Smads complex
  with Co-Smad (Smad4) and translocate into the nucleus to modulate the transcription
  of target genes (canonical BMP-Smad pathway). Independent of the Smads, BMPs may
  transduce signal via the MAPK p38 pathway. Endogenous mechanisms of BMP signaling
  inhibition include extracellular antagonists such as noggin and chordin, inhibitory
  Smads (Smad6 and 7), Sno/Ski, and Smurfs. The small molecule inhibitor dorsomorphin
  inhibits type I BMP receptors. →: stimuation, ┆---: inhibition, BMPs: bone morphogenetic
