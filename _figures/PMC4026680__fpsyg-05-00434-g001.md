caption: Early life stress can influence development of the HPA axis, as well as regulation
  of satiety-related hormones, leptin, insulin, and ghrelin to alter feeding behavior
  long-term. Thus, early life stress can lead to epigenetic modification of glucocorticoid
  receptor (GR) expression in the hypothalamus and hippocampus and arginine vasopressin
  (AVP) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the hypothalamus, resulting in
  suppressed GR and increased AVP and CRH activity in response to stress later in
  life. Synaptic pruning in the hippocampus and circulating 11βHSD2 are also affected
  leading to elevated circulating glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations both under basal
  conditions and in response to stress. These effects of early life stress are ultimately
  seen in altered outputs from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN)
  to feeding-related nuclei such as the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the dorsomedial
  nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH). Early life stress can also potentially induce
  increased release of trophic/satiety hormones such as leptin, insulin, and ghrelin,
  again influencing appetite, feeding behavior, and metabolism throughout life.
