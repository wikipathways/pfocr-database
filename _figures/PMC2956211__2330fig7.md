caption: Model. Brain-derived serotonin (5-HT) regulates bone mass accrual through
  a CaM/CREB signaling cascade in VMH neurons. Serotonin is released from the presynaptic
  terminal of serotonergic neurons of the brainstem. Serotonin, following its binding
  to the Htr2c receptor expressed in VMH neurons, activates the CaM signaling pathway
  and leads to the activation of CREB by its phosphorylation. CREB favors bone mass
  accrual by inhibiting the activity of sympathetic neurons.
