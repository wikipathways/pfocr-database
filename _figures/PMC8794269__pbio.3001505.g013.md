caption: At 65 hpf, just prior to delamination, WSS (orange arrow) activates Nfatc
  signaling in luminal cells. This leads to the production of a secreted signal that
  results in the inhibition of twist1b expression in abluminal cells. Since twist1b
  causes abluminal cells to transition toward more mesenchymal cell states, its inhibition
  is necessary to allow MEndoT, a process key to correct valve delamination. EndoMT,
  endothelial–mesenchymal transition; hpf, hours postfertilization; MEndoT, mesenchymal–endothelial
  transition; WSS, wall shear stress.
