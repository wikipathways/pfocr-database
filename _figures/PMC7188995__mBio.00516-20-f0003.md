caption: Metabolites and enzymes of the upstream central carbon metabolism of P. putida
  KT2440, including the proposed glycerol degradation pathway initiated by PQQ-ADH
  PedE or PedH or both. Enzymes involved in the specific metabolic steps that were
  differentially abundant in response to 10 μM La3+ during growth on glycerol are
  color coded (green = increased, red = decreased, black = not affected). The figure
  is inspired by a scheme originally published by Nikel et al. () and was redrawn
  to include the novel metabolic route(s) identified in this study.
