caption: nTregs obtained from WT (CD8+) donors when transferred into sensitized and
  challenged WT recipients suppress the development of lung allergic responses. Interactions
  between CD8 and MHC I are essential. In the absence of CD8 (CD8-deficient mice),
  nTregs from these mice when transferred into sensitized and challenged WT recipients,
  enhance development of lung allergic responses. Enhancement is triggered by transcriptional
  reprogramming of the nTregs, mediated through ligation of GITR and activation of
  the GITRL-GITR-JNK pathway. In CD8+/+ mice signaling through CD8-MHC I dominates
  and is associated with the maintenance of the regulatory phenotype and suppressive
  activities of nTregs even in face of GITR ligation.

  description: nTregs obtained from WT (CD8+) donors when transferred into sensitized
    and challenged WT recipients suppress the development of lung allergic responses.
    Interactions between CD8 and MHC I are essential. In the absence of CD8 (CD8-deficient
    mice), nTregs from these mice when transferred into sensitized and challenged
    WT recipients, enhance development of lung allergic responses. Enhancement is
    triggered by transcriptional reprogramming of the nTregs, mediated through ligation
    of GITR and activation of the GITRL-GITR-JNK pathway. In CD8+/+ mice signaling
    through CD8-MHC I dominates and is associated with the maintenance of the regulatory
    phenotype and suppressive activities of nTregs even in face of GITR ligation.
