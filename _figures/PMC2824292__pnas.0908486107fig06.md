caption: EED is the missing link that couples TNF-R1 to nSMase2. The scheme depicts
  the proposed role of EED in the N-SMase pathway. Activation of TNF-R1 in response
  to TNF induces translocation of EED from the nucleus to the plasma membrane, where
  it binds to RACK1 and becomes part of the TNF-R1•FAN•RACK1 complex. Concurrently,
  EED binds to the catalytic C-terminal domain of nSMase2, which is more freely accessible
  than the tightly membrane-integrated N-terminal region. This interaction physically
  links nSMase2 to the TNF-R1•FAN•RACK1•EED complex, resulting in activation of nSMase2.
  Subsequently, nSMase2 is deactivated by EED-independent mechanisms. The membrane
  topology of nSMase2, including the palmitoylation clusters (P) and the two N-terminal
  hydrophobic segments (HS1, HS2) is adapted from ref. .
