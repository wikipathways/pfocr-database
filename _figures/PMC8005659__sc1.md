caption: Schematic illustration of this work. SIRT3 is known to possess an NAD+-dependent
  protein deacetylase located in mitochondria. Lentiviral transduction efficiency
  in cells with LV-shSIRT3 or LV-SIRT3 was determined by fluorescence microscopy,
  Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses. Ti particle-induced bone loss surrounding the
  implant was inhibited by upregulating the expression of SIRT3 to mitigate osteogenic
  reduction through the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome and downstream proinflammatory
  cytokines via the GSK-3β/β-catenin signalling pathway.
