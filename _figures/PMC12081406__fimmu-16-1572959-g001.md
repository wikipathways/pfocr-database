caption: The biosynthetic pathway of sphingosine 1-phosphate and related molecules.
  De novo sphingolipid (SPL) metabolism begins with serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)-mediated
  condensation of serine and palmitoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and reduction of that product
  to generate dihydrosphingosine (dhSph). dhSph can then be phosphorylated to dihydrosphingosine
  1-phosphate (dhS1P) by sphingosine kinases (Sphk1 and 2) or acylated by (dihydro)
  ceramide synthases ((dh)Cers) to form dihydroceramide (dhCer). If αOH-fatty acyl-CoAs
  are utilized by dhCers rather than non-hydroxylated fatty acyl-CoAs, α-hydroxylated
  Cer (αOHCer) are synthesized and can serve as the backbone for αOH glycosphingolipids.
  Dihydrosphingomyelin (dhSM) is synthesized from dhCer by sphingomyelin synthase
  (SMS), or desaturation of dhCer by dihydroceramide desaturases (Des 1 and 2) generates
  ceramide (Cer). Cer can then be phosphorylated by ceramide kinase (CERK) to form
  ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P), used as a substrate by SMS to produce SM and diacylglycerol
  (DAG), modified with covalently linked sugar moieties to create glycosphingolipids,
  or hydrolyzed by ceramidases (CDase), creating Sph and a free fatty acid. Like dhSph,
  Sph can be phosphorylated by Sphks, producing sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which
  can be dephosphorylated by S1P phosphatase (SPP1 and 2) or lipid phosphate phosphatase
  3 (LPP3) back to Sph or terminally degraded by S1P lyase to phosphoethanolamine
  to produce phospholipids and hexadecenal and subsequently provide palmitoyl-CoA.
  In the salvage pathway, Cer is produced from SM hydrolysis by sphingomyelinases
  (SMase)
