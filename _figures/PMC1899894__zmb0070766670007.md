caption: A model of the role of FoxO4 in phenotypic modulation of SMCs in response
  to cytokine and growth factor signals. During phenotypic modulation of SMCs in restenosis
  and atherosclerosis, nuclear FoxO4 is upregulated in response to TNF-α, which leads
  to suppression of myocardin-mediated smooth muscle (SM) differentiation, activation
  of MMP9 transcription, and promotion of SMC migration. The activity of FoxO4 is
  negatively regulated by Akt kinases through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.
