caption: 'Generalized schema of possible interactions between AA transporters/transceptors
  and major nutrient-responsive signaling pathways in animal cells [target of rapamycin
  complex 1 (TORC1), general control nonrepressed (GCN)2 pathways]. ATF, activating
  transcription factor. For clarity, transporter and transceptor functions are shown
  separately, but it should be stressed that both are incorporated within a true AA
  transceptor (e.g., Gap1, SNAT2). Transceptors are proposed to exist in both signaling
  and nonsignaling states: In the diagram, State 1 (AA bound at extracellular surface)
  is stimulatory, or ON, whereas State 2 (AA bound at intracellular surface) is inhibitory,
  or OFF, with respect to the TORC1 pathway. This may account for transient activation
  of the TOR pathway by external methyl-aminoisobutyric acid (Me-AIB) before it accumulates
  substantially in the cytoplasm. Binding of any AA substrate (for SNAT2 at least)
  represses the adaptive upregulation of transporter/transceptor expression in response
  to nutrient deprivation, although whether this requires intracellular or extracellular
  binding remains a matter of debate. AA transporters may modulate intracellular free
  AA pools by coupled transport processes at the cell surface, including primary (I),
  secondary (II), and tertiary (III) active transport (as detailed in ). In discrete,
  unperfused extracellular spaces (e.g., synaptic clefts), AA transporter actions
  may also exert significant effects on extracellular AA pools.'
