caption: The canonical Wnt signalling pathway. Wnt binding causes inhibition of the
  GSK3-CK1α-APC-Axin complex through dishevelled protein (DVL). DVL gets activated
  by phosphorylation through PAR-1. As a result of the inhibition activity, free β-catenin
  accumulates in the cytoplasm and then translocates to the nucleus to mediate the
  transcriptional activation of oncogenic target genes such as cyclin D1, C-MYC and
  ZEB1. In absence of Wnt ligands, β-catenin is bound to E-cadherin as a part of adherens
  junction complex. The β-catenin destruction complex composed of Axin, GSK3, CK1α
  and APC causes phosphorylation of β-catenin through GSK3 and CK1α leading to proteasomal
  degradation of β-catenin.
