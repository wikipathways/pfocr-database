caption: Aerotactic signaling. Aer is an FAD-binding protein that is an oxygen sensor
  for positive aerotaxis in E. coli. Aer may sense the redox state of a component
  of the electron transport chain and communicate with the chemotaxis signaling pathway
  through a conserved, MCP-like cytoplasmic domain. Tsr may act as a second sensor
  for aerotaxis, possibly by measuring the proton motive force.
