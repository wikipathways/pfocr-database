caption: 'Dysregulation of signaling pathways in AD: Mutation of PSEN-1 gene triggers
  the activation of GSK3β signaling pathway through inhibition of the neuroprotective
  PP2 A. Augmentation of GSK3β signaling pathway leads to mitochondrial dysfunction
  and activation of mTOR signaling, which through inhibition of AMPK inhibits autophagy
  and induces neurodegeneration. GSK3β by activating PTEN results in direct neurodegeneration.
  In addition, over-activated GSK3β promotes tau protein hyperphosphorylation with
  formation of NFTs which induce neurodegeneration. Progressive neurodegeneration
  is linked with the development and progression of AD'
