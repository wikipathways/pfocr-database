caption: BA regulates glucose homeostasis. (a) In hepatocytes, bile acids activate
  the farnesoid pathway, which in turn reduces the production of very low density
  lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglycerides (TG). The interaction between FGF15/19-FGFR4
  enhances SHP expression, leading to increased fatty acid oxidation and maintenance
  of glucose homeostasis through upregulation of UCP1 and FEBP1. (b) In intestinal
  cells, activation of FXR by bile acids induces the production of fibroblast growth
  factor 19 (FGF19/15), which subsequently acts on hepatocytes through the FGFR4 complex
  to promote fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, bile acid activation of TGR5 in intestinal
  L cells can elevate cAMP production, resulting in GLP-1 secretion and enhanced insulin
  sensitivity. (c) Activation of FXR and TGR5 in pancreatic β cells can also improve
  insulin secretion and sensitivity and reduce blood glucose levels. (d) Activation
  of TGR5 in adipose tissue stimulates cAMP production, leading to the synthesis of
  T3 by type 2 deiodinase (DIO2), which promotes energy metabolism and browning of
  adipose tissue. This activation also upregulates the expression of UCP-1 and CPT1,
  enhancing fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, FXR activation induces FGF19/15 to
  increase PGCα expression, thereby activating mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation
  and facilitating fat consumption for energy release in the form of heat
