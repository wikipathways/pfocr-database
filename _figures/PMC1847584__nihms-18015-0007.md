caption: Model for G1 CDK inhibition of Ste5 signalingAs cells pass Start, G1 CDK
  activity inhibits pheromone signaling by phosphorylating CDK sites flanking the
  PM domain in Ste5. The negatively-charged phosphates interfere with binding between
  the basic PM domain and the anionic phospholipid membrane.Ste5 serves as an integration
  point for both external and internal regulatory cues, which act through the Gβγ-binding
  domain and the membrane-binding domain.Far1 promotes pheromone arrest by inhibiting
  Cln/CDK activity, but Far1-independent arrest pathways also exist and are revealed
  when Ste5 signaling cannot be downregulated by Cln/CDK activity.
