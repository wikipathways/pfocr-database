caption: Schematic diagrams illustrating the mechanism by which GSPE protects against
  IR-induced renal insult by inhibiting the HMGB1-TLR4-p65 pathway. Once tubular epithelial
  cells suffer IR-induced damage and necrosis, HMGB1 is transported from the nucleus
  to cytoplasm and released into the extracellular milieu, where they can then bind
  to TLR4 and promote p65 translocation to the nucleus through autocrine or paracrine
  signaling. However, all of those effects can be lessened by GSPE. Decreased NF-κB
  p65 transcription and translation led to less cytokine and chemokine release, which
  can trigger a pro-inflammatory response and activate immune cells. Decreased tubulointerstitial
  inflammation can then inhibit the activation of fibroblasts and mitigate the tubular
  damage. At the same time, successive treatment with GSPE can also inhibit the HMGB1-TLR4-p65
  pathway, which leads to not only less inflammation but also the release of the most
  potent pro-fibrosis cytokine TGF-β. Green arrows mean promotion and red line means
  inhibition.
