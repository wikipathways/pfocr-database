caption: The riboflavin biosynthetic pathway. Riboflavin is synthesized from GTP and
  ribulose-5-phosphate, two derivatives of the purine pathway and the pentose phosphate
  pathway, respectively. Rib1, Rib2, and Rib7 convert GTP into 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione
  5′-phosphate which is then dephosphorylated by a yet unknown enzyme. Ribulose-5-phosphate
  is converted by Rib3 and Rib4 to 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine. Finally, Rib5 converts
  these two intermediates into riboflavin. Riboflavin can be converted into FMN or
  FAD by Fmn1 and/or Fad1 (28, 29)
