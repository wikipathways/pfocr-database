caption: The Krebs cycle is a metabolic pathway operating in the mitochondrial matrix
  of all aerobic organisms. Breakdown of nutrients, such as glucose, generates acetyl-CoA
  which can then be funnelled into this pathway. For a full cycle to be completed,
  a series of 10 enzymatic reactions are required. These reactions are catalysed by
  the mitochondrial enzymes citrate synthase (CS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH),
  aconitase (ACO2), α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), succinyl-CoA synthetase,
  succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), fumarase (FH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH). The
  primary function of the TCA cycle is to generate reducing equivalents, such as NADH
  and FADH2 (produced by SDH). NADH and FADH2 can then transfer electrons to the ETC
  to drive oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the production of the high energy
  nucleoside triphosphate, ATP, via ATP synthase.
