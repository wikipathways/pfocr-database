caption: Pathways of poliovirus replication and the dilemma of ribosome-polymerase
  collisions. (A) The replication of poliovirus RNA in infected cells and in cell-free
  replication reactions in vitro is fundamentally different. The initial concentration
  of viral RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells is very low. In the infected cell,
  protein synthesis and RNA replication are codependent since protein synthesis requires
  RNA replication and vice versa. During the course of the infection, this results
  in the amplification of the input viral RNA and leads to a circular replication
  pathway. In contrast, a relatively high concentration of input virion RNA is used
  in the in vitro reactions to achieve maximum rates of protein synthesis. In this
  case, amplification of the input RNA is not required to achieve maximum rates of
  protein synthesis and RNA replication in vitro, which leads to a linear replication
  pathway. (B) Poliovirus RNA is translated before it replicates (). Translating ribosomes
  move 5′ to 3′ on the viral mRNA, while the poliovirus polymerase must initiate negative-strand
  RNA synthesis at the 3′ terminus of the viral RNA and move in a 3′-to-5′ direction.
  The results of this study indicate that the poliovirus polymerase is not able to
  dislodge translating ribosomes from viral mRNA. This suggests that the virus has
  evolved a different mechanism to regulate the switch from translation to RNA replication
  to avoid this dilemma which would impede the efficient replication of the viral
  genome.
