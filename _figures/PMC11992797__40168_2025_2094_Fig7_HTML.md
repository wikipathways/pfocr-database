caption: '2′-FL promote cognition and behavior in growing mice by influencing gut
  microbiota and facilitating 5-HTP production through two potential mechanisms. 1
  2′-FL could impact the 5-HT synthesis pathway within the intestinal flora: it appears
  to increase tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) levels while possibly reducing 5-hydroxytryptophan
  decarboxylase (5-HTPDC) activity, thereby favoring the conversion of tryptophan
  (Trp) into 5-HTP and potentially limiting the conversion of 5-HTP into 5-HT. This
  might lead to an accumulation of 5-HTP within the microbiota. 2 2′-FL might indirectly
  influence 5-HT synthesis in enterocytes by promoting the production of short-chain
  fatty acids, which could increase TPH levels in enterochromaffin cells and subsequently
  enhance 5-HTP synthesis; the 5-HTP produced through these pathways may contribute
  to its accumulation in the bloodstream, potentially leading to increased 5-HT levels
  in the brain and supporting cognitive improvements'
