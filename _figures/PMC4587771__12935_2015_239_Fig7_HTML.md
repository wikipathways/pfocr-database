caption: Schematic pathway alternations of MK-2206 resistance. a Signal pathway study
  of MK-2206 non-resistant cells showed that AKT acted in mTOR-S6K dependent method
  (LAN-1 and SK-N-DZ), in which inhibition of AKT reduced activity of mTOR-S6K signaling.
  Activity of PDK1 took the place of AKT, and elevated PDK1-mTOR-S6K transduction
  contributed to MK-2206 resistance, when AKT-mTOR-S6K was blocked. b AKT acted in
  mTOR-S6K independent method (KP-N-SIFA and NB-19), in which inhibition of AKT did
  not impair the activity of mTOR-S6K signaling. Parallel signaling pathway of PDK1-MTOR-S6K
  became an important alternative for cell growth of MK-2206-resistant sublines, when
  AKT was inhibited. And some other signal pathway may contribute to MK-2206 resistance
  as well
