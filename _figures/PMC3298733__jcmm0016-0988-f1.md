caption: New therapies targeting the deregulated pathways to treat TICs in pancreatic
  cancer. Surface markers CD24+, CD44+, CD133+, ESA+ and ALDH+ have been identified
  to help isolate TICs. Conventional therapy can reduce the tumour size by exerting
  effect on cancer cells; however, it does not eradicate TICs. The remaining TICs
  possess self-renewal ability and can re-initiate tumour growth, increasing the risk
  of tumour recurrence as well as promoting tumour metastasis. With the use of TIC-targeting
  therapy that eliminates TICs by either interfering with the signalling pathway or
  regulating the activity of miRNAs, complete tumour eradication is possible. The
  signalling pathways associated with TICs include the SHH pathway and the Notch-1
  pathway that both up-regulate the activity of EMT and TIC itself. The Notch-1 pathway
  can also influence the expression of miRNA such as miR21, miR200b, miR200c and miR34
  that all play a role in TIC regulation.
