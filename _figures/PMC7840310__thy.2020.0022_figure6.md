caption: TRα knockout causes reduction in mmp expression during intestinal remodeling.
  (A) Mapping of TRα-specific T3-regulated genes to the ECM–receptor interaction pathway
  (KEGG). Genes regulated by T3 for at least twofold after one day of T3 treatment
  of wild-type but not TRα−/− tadpole were mapped onto the KEGG pathway for the ECM–receptor
  interaction. Pink boxes indicate upregulation, and blue boxes indicate downregulation.
  Note that all mapped genes were upregulated by T3. (B) The mRNA level of mmp genes
  in the intestine is significantly increased during T3-induced metamorphosis in wild-type
  tadpoles but not in TRα−/− tadpoles. The mRNA levels of mmp2, mmp9, mmp11, mmp13,
  and mmp14 were determined by real-time PCR and shown relative to the levels in the
  wild-type intestine at stage 54. The wild-type intestine had much higher levels
  of expression of mmp2, mmp9, mmp11, mmp13, and mmp14 after one and two days of T3
  treatment. The asterisk (*) indicates a significant difference between the TRα−/−
  tadpoles and wild-type tadpoles (p < 0.05). Experiment was repeated twice, and each
  bar represents the mean + S.E. ECM, extracellular matrix.
