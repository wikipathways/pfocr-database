caption: A, SCI-induced increases in SOCS3 expression lead to inhibition of the Jak/STAT3
  pathway, which in turn increases the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. This contributes to SCI-induced
  neuronal death in vivo. B, Reduction of SOCS3 by shSOCS3 activates STAT3 signaling
  and decreases the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, which consequently contributes to neuronal protection/survival
  after SCI.
