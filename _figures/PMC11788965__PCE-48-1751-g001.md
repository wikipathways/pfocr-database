caption: Simplified brassinosteroids (BR) biosynthesis and signalling pathways. Main
  steps of the mevalonate/non‐mevalonate, sterols and BR biosynthesis pathway are
  shown, alongside the enzymes that are discussed in the main text. Below, the main
  proteins involved in BR export and signalling are represented alongside the effectors
  that modify each component of the cell wall. Full black arrows represent direct
  continuity, and dashed arrows represent multistep relationships
