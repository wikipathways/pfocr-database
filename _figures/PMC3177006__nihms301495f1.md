caption: Conversion of cholesterol to prenenolone by the P450 side chain cleavage
  enzyme (P450ssc) is the first committed step in steroid biosynthesis. The 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase
  (P450c17) catalyzes multiple 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase reactions in the steroidogenic
  pathway that require P450 oxidoreductase (P450ox/red) electron transfer. P450c17
  coded by the CYP17A1 gene is the target for inhibition by abiraterone acetate. Progesterone,
  17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17α-OH-progesterone) and testosterone are substrates for
  5α-reductase type 1, 2 or 3 (5αR1, 2 or 3). Finasteride is an 5αR2 inhibitor. Dutasteride
  is an inhibitor of 5αR1, 5αR2 and 5αR3. Isozymes of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  (3βHSD), 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17βHSD) and aldo-keto reductase (AKR1C3)
  are often reversible enzymes with oxidative and reductive activities that require
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactors. Testosterone and DHT are the two biologically
  active androgens that activate AR. Testosterone is the major circulating active
  androgen formed in the testis. DHT is formed from testosterone in the testis, and
  can be synthesized in a so-called backdoor pathway (green) from progesterone and
  androsterone precursors independent of DHEA, androstenedione or testosterone intermediates.
