caption: T helper subsets and tumor immunity. Different T helper subsets are found
  in tumor microenvironments. The roles of these T cell subsets in tumor immunity
  may be highly context dependent. TH1 cells may mediate antitumor immunity through
  the interferon-γ(IFN-γ) signaling pathway. TH2 cells may suppress antitumor immunity
  by inhibiting the TH1 response and inducing alternative macrophages through IL-4
  and IL-13. However, it is also possible that TH2 cells may promote tumor immunity
  through B cell activation. The work of Purwar et al. suggests that TH9 cells may
  mediate antitumor immunity via the direct killing of tumor cells and by mast cells.
  The polyfunctionality, stemness and longevity of TH17 cells may be associated with
  their antitumor immunity. The role of TH22 cells in tumor immunity is poorly understood,
  although they may be associated with poor outcome in patients with gastric cancer
  and have been linked to hepatocellular carcinoma progression. APC, antigen-presenting
  cell; NK, natural killer cell.
