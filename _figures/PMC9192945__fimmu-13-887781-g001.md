caption: Myeloid cells within glioma microenvironment. Gliomas are composed of different
  types of myeloid immune cells which promote tumor progression, including MDSCs,
  GAMs, GANs, and GADCs. Each of these cell types contributes to glioma progression
  in unique ways. (A) Both G-MDSC and M-MDSC recruitments contribute to T cell inactivation
  and inhibition cytotoxicity of glioma cells. BATF-2 on G-MDSC and sulforaphane on
  M-MDSC could cause inhibitory effect and further prevent from T cell inactivation
  and glioma progression. (B) GAMs engage in significant bidirectional crosstalk with
  glioma cells. Glioma cells release cytokines and chemoattractants to recruit GAMs
  to the glioma microenvironment, and M2 GAMs in turn supply pro-tumorigenic and pro-survival
  factors. In addition, GM-CSF promote GAMs’ mitochondrial reprograming that sway
  between M1 and M2 inflammatory response leading to glioma resistance. (C) GANs can
  be reprogrammed to express pro-tumor phenotype (N2) with TGFβ signaling in the TME
  to facilitate tumor growth through NE and MMP9 secretion. The release of the pro-angiogenic
  factors BV8 and the S100 proteins (S100A8 and S100A9) by N2 GANs activate VEGFA
  to promote tumor growth. Glioma cells can induce NETs formation via IL-8 production.
  NETs are correlated with glioma progression and prognosis through a HMGB1/RAGE/IL-8
  axis. (D) A variety of signaling molecules alter GADC migration, infiltration of
  the TME, maturation, and function. FGL2 and CCL2 secreted by GAMs and GADCs induce
  Treg activity, which suppresses antigen presentation function of GADCs. MIF, also
  secreted by GAMs, inhibits GADC maturation as well as migration and infiltration
  to the TME. The STAT3 signaling pathway inhibits GADC maturation, as does VEGF through
  inhibition of costimulatory factors CD80 and CD86. VEGF is expressed by tumor cells
  and influenced by mutant IDH1 and IDH2, as well as altered metabolism in the TME.
