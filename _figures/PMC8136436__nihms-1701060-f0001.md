caption: (a) Reactions showing the major routes for H2S synthesis by CBS and CSE at
  cellular concentrations of substrates and their canonical reactions in the transsulfuration
  pathway. (b) H2S generation by MPST from 3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP), which is derived
  from cysteine via the action of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), which
  is also referred to as cysteine aminotransferase. A persulfide intermediate is formed
  on MPST and transferred to a low molecular weight (LMW) acceptor like cysteine or
  to thioredoxin (Trx). TrxR represents thioredoxin reductase. (c) LMW persulfides
  can be synthesized by CBS and CSE, with the latter being the major source under
  cellular conditions. Pyr and AKB denote pyruvate and α-ketobutyrate. (d) The mitochondrial
  sulfide oxidation pathway enzymes lead to oxidation of H2S to thiosulfate and sulfate.
  Electrons from the first step in the pathway, which is catalyzed by SQOR (sulfide
  quinone oxidoreductase), enter the ETC at the level of complex III. ETHE1 is a persulfide
  dioxygenase and SO denotes sulfite oxidase (e) Sulfide can be oxidized at ferric
  heme centers in globins leading to formation of thiosulfate and iron bound polysulfides.
