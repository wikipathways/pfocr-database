caption: The two-hit vascular model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia. Vascular
  factors, such as hypertension and diabetes, and/or genetic risk factors for AD,
  such as apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4), can all lead to cerebrovascular damage (hit
  1; green boxes). Within the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ)-independent pathway, cerebrovascular
  damage leads to blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and accumulation of blood-derived
  neurotoxic molecules in the brain, from one hand, and oligemia or reduced cerebral
  blood volume, from the other. Additionally, within the amyloidogenic Aβ pathway,
  BBB dysfunction can disrupt Aβ clearance across the BBB and oligemia leads to overexpression
  and enhanced processing of Aβ precursor protein (APP), which both can promote Aβ
  accumulation in the brain (hit 2; black boxes). The converging Aβ-independent and
  Aβ-dependent pathways can each independently and/or synergistically lead to synaptic
  and neuronal dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and disruption of brain structural
  and functional connectivity that ultimately leads to dementia.
