caption: Model for the B. subtilis membrane protein insertion monitor MifM and comparison
  to the E. coli protein secretion monitor SecM. (A) Model for YidC2 regulation. The
  mRNA hairpin masks the yidC2 SD site to block yidC2 translation (I). When MifM inserts
  into the membrane, the translational arrest is transient or does not occur, thereby
  allowing only transient unfolding of the mRNA secondary structure by the ribosome
  (II–IV). When membrane insertion of MifM is impaired, mifM translation is arrested
  and the ribosome unfolds the mRNA, allowing ribosomes to recognize the yidC2 SD
  and initiate translation (V). (B) Comparison to the protein secretion monitor secM.
  Formation of the mRNA hairpin masks the secA SD and blocks secA translation. When
  SecM is secreted, the translational arrest is released, transiently exposing the
  secA SD and basal levels of SecA are synthesized (I–IV). When secretion is impaired,
  SecM is not secreted and a prolonged translational arrest occurs (V), unfolding
  the mRNA and allowing elevated SecA synthesis. (C) Proposed modular arrangement
  of MifM and SecM. The N-terminus of each protein contains a targeting signal comprised
  of either the putative transmembrane domain of MifM, which likely directs the protein
  to the SpoIIIJ (YidC1) membrane protein biogenesis pathway, or the signal sequence
  of SecM, which directs the protein to the SecYEG protein secretion pathway. Positive
  and negative charges flanking the hydrophobic core of these signals are indicated.
  The C-terminus of each protein contains a translational arrest motif comprising
  ∼12–20 amino acids preceding the final amino acid required for translational arrest
  (indicated by a D or P). This motif is located within the polypeptide exit tunnel
  of the ribosome, whereas the final amino acid translated is a peptidyl–tRNA at the
  PTC. TnaC is shown for comparison.
