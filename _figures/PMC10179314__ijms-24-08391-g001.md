caption: Renal cancer is characterized by overexpression of growth factors; epidermal
  growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and insulin growth
  factor (IGF) that will induce the activation of the phosphatidyl-3-kinase-protein-kinase
  B-mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and RAS/MEK/ERK (RAS/mitogen-activated
  protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase). Further, this molecular signaling
  pathway inhibits the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene leading to the activation of hypoxia-inducible
  factors (HIFs) involved in renal cancer-reprogramming metabolism. Therefore, regarding
  glucose metabolism, this malignancy has increased glycolysis, glycogenolysis, pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), and increased tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), leading to
  lactate, pyruvate, NADPH, ribose-5-phosphate, malate, succinate, citrate, and acetyl-CoA
  accumulation. Additionally, the RAS/MEK/ERK signaling pathway promotes glycolysis
  and TCA. The compounds that resulted from altering glucose metabolism are involved
  in glutathione (GSH) regeneration, lipids, nucleotides, and amino acids (AA) biosynthesis.
  Fatty acids (FA) are used to produce energy by β-oxidation. Lipid metabolism alterations
  also include synthesis of FA, TAG (triacylglycerols), cholesterol, ceramides, sphingolipids,
  and phosphatidylcoline/phosphatidylethanolamine. Amino acids such as glutamine can
  suffer several modifications forming glutamate, α-ketoglutarate, and aspartate.
  The intermediates together with increased Tyr (tyrosine) and decreased Arg (arginine)
  and Trp (tryptophan) will be used by renal cancer cells for the synthesis of new
  AA, nucleotides, FA, citrate, oxaloacetate (OAA), and pyrimidine bases. All these
  compounds that result from the altered pathway lead to cancer cell survival, aggressiveness,
  and metastasis. These characteristics of malignant tumors are also promoted by cyclin
  D1 deregulation produced by mTORC1 by activating S6K and 4E-BP1. + represents activation;
  − means inhibited
