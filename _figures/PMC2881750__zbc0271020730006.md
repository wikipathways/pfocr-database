caption: Signaling pathway model showing the role of NAADP in the acrosome reaction
  in sea urchin sperm. The fucose sulfate polymer (FSP) in the egg jelly activates
  the receptor of egg jelly (REJ, 1), which stimulates a plasma membrane channel resulting
  in a transient Ca2+ increase (2). The initial Ca2+ increase stimulates NAADP synthesis
  possibly by ADP-ribosyl cyclase (ARC, 3). NAADP binds to its receptor (Two-Pore
  Channel) on the acrosome and releases Ca2+ (4). These steps parallel the traditional
  pathway in which the Ca2+ increase stimulates phospholipase Cδ (PLCδ, 5) to produce
  inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate that activates its receptor (6). Ca2+ release from
  the acrosome might trigger exocytosis directly or indirectly via store-activated
  Ca2+ entry (7).
