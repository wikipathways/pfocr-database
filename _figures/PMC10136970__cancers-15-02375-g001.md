caption: RAS-mediated signaling pathway. Signaling begins with a ligand such as the
  epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to a receptor tyrosine kinase such as the
  EGF receptor (EGFR). This binding activates downstream guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor (GEF) proteins such as the son of sevenless (SOS) protein to mediate cycling
  of GDP to GTP on RAS proteins. This cycling induces a conformational change that
  allows for binding with downstream signaling components. RAS once activated can
  bind RAF and signal through the mitogen-activated pathway kinase (MAPK) pathway
  or bind to phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and signal through the PI3K pathway.
  The PI3K pathway can then activate or be activated by the mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) pathway. The downstream effect of these pathways leads to transcriptional
  reprogramming, affecting cellular survival, differentiation, apoptosis, and proliferation.
  The signaling of RAS is controlled by intrinsic GTPase activity that is catalyzed
  by a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) to hydrolyze the GTP into GDP and induce RAS
  into its inactive conformation.
