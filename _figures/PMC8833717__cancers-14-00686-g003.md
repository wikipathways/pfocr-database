caption: 'Stimulation of the mitochondrial-dependent intrinsic apoptosis pathway by
  gefitinib and erlotinib. This pathway is marked by a key event—mitochondrial outer
  membrane permeabilization (MOMP)—which results in the release of cytochrome c from
  the mitochondrial intermembrane space. MOMP can be triggered by the activation of
  BH3-only proteins of the BCL-2 family [] following their post-translational modification
  (e.g., phosphorylation) []. Activated BH3-only proteins generally stimulate MOMP
  by inducing the oligomerization of BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) and/or BCL2 antagonist
  or killer (BAK) in the outer mitochondrial membrane, thereby forming supramolecular
  channels that mediate the liberation of cytochrome c []. At the cytosol, cytochrome
  c triggers the assembly of a caspase-activating complex between caspase 9 and apoptotic
  protease-activating factor 1 []. TKI inhibition can stimulate the transactivation
  of genes encoding pro-apoptotic proteins (such as the BH3-only protein p53-upregulated
  modulator of apoptosis (PUMA)). Gefitinib and erlotininib can also activate the
  so-called death receptor FAS, leading to activation of caspase 8 [,]. Caspase 8
  proteolytically activates downstream effector caspases or truncates the BH3-only
  protein BID (BH3-interacting domain death agonist), which co-activates the intrinsic
  pathway of apoptosis by translocating to mitochondria. Caspase-8 interacts with
  caspase-9 to activate the executioner caspase-3, which coordinates the destruction
  of cellular structures, such as DNA fragmentation or degradation of cytoskeletal
  proteins []. Fluorescence image inserts: left: Live cell image of exogenous GFP-BAX
