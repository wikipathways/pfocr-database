caption: 'Schematic representation of the interaction between the Rho/ROCK pathway
  and miRNAs in spinal cord injuries. Spinal cord injuries trigger multiple signaling
  pathways that upregulate the Rho/ROCK pathways in neurons, leading to neuron cell
  apoptosis and axon growth inhibition. MiRNAs inhibit these signaling pathways, resulting
  in reduced cell apoptosis and the promotion of axon regeneration. † miRNA involving
  oxidative stress. * miRNA involving cell apoptosis. Sema3A: Semaphorin-3A; NRP-1:
  neuropilin-1; BRD4: bromodomain-containing protein 4; WNT5A: Wnt family member 5A;
  ROCK: Rho-kinase.'
