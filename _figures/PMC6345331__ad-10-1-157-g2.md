caption: 'Mechanism of whey protein/resistance training to induce muscle protein synthesis.
  Amino acids (AAs)/resistance training, together with insulin, promote the muscle
  protein synthesis (MPS) by affecting the components of the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, as described
  in detail in the text. “?”: whether or not AAs directly promote activation of mTOR
  remains unknown; ?: phosphorylate; PKB: protein kinase B; GSK3: glycogen synthase
  kinase 3; 4E-BP1: eIF4E-binding protein 1; p70S6k: 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 protein
  kinase; elF2B/4E/4G: eukaryotic initiation factor 2B/4E/4G.'
