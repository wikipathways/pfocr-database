caption: 'The mechanisms of human NLRP6 inflammasome activation. The activation of
  NLRP6 inflammasome obey a two-steps mechanism: a priming and an activation. In the
  priming step, induction of the Nlrp6 gene transcription and other NLRP6 inflammasome
  components is triggered by TNF‐α, viral and bacterial PAMPs/DAMPs, and/or the peroxisome
  proliferator‐activated receptor-γ (PPAR‐γ). Once translated, NLRP6 inflammasome
  is activated by dsARN from RNA virus and LPS, and occurs through NLRP6 recruitment
  of ASC and Casp1. The activated NLRP6 inflammasome activates IL-1β, and IL-18 from
  their respective precursors (pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18, respectively) by catalytic
  cleavage. NLRP6 inflammasome also catalyses digestion of GSDMD into GSDMD-C and
  GSDMD-N that forms gasdermin membrane pore, which yields to pyroptosis. IL-1β and
  IL-18 cytokines are release out of the cells to promote pro-inflammatory responses.
  Besides, the NLRP6 protein is also found in the cytosol in low level and is autoinhibited
  in quiescent cell condition. In this condition, LTA from Gram + bacteria induce
  an indirect non-canonical activation of the NLRP6 inflammasome. LTA activates caspase-11
  (involved in the non-canonical inflammasome activation pathway) which trigger activation
  of NLRP3/6 inflammasomes, through production of ions flux (specifically K+ efflux
  via GSDMD pores), which in turn activate caspase-1 and release IL-1β and IL-18'
