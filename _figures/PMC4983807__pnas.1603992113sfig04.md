caption: (A) Members of receptor tyrosine signaling pathways that are predicted as
  indispensable nodes and targeted by cancer mutations, OMIM disease, viruses, or
  FDA-approved drugs. RTK pathway members are as defined by the SignaLink database
  (). (B) Indispensable nodes that are targeted by all three inputs (cancer mutation,
  viruses, and drugs). The labels of FDA drug nodes correspond to DrugBank IDs. The
  network was generated using Cytoscape ().
