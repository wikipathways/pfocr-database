caption: 'Inhibitors of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) effector
  signalling. RAS protein acts as a binary molecular switch in a variety of signal
  transduction pathways. It is active when combined with GTP, but doesn’t have activity
  when combined with GDP. The GDP/GTP cycle is regulated by GEFs, which can promote
  the formation of active RAS - GTP and GAP stimulates GTP hydrolysis and forms inactive
  RAS - GDP. Normal RAS can be activated by upstream signalling factors, which in
  turn activates multiple downstream signalling pathways, including: MAPK, pathway;
  PI3k - AKT - mTOR, and pathway; RALGDS pathways. MAPK pathway, PI3K, pathway and
  JAK-STAT pathways promote the transcription of genes related to cell proliferation,
  metastasis, and drug resistance. PD -1 exists on the surface of activated T cells.
  When it is combined with PD-L1/2, it causes a series of immunosuppressive effects.
  Many Several methods have been developed to directly inhibit KRAS and inhibit KRAS
  downstream signalling pathways. Many new treatment strategies for KRAS inhibitors,
  KRAS downstream signalling pathway inhibitors, and ICIimmune checkpoint inhibitors
  are under investigation.'
