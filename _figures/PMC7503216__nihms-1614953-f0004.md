caption: Changes in inner retinal signaling in early diabetes. The strongest early
  deficits in diabetes have been shown in the rod pathway that starts with the rod
  photoreceptor (R) that releases glutamate onto the rod bipolar cell (RBC). Diabetes
  causes reductions in GABAergic inhibition (GABA AC, red arrow) onto the rod bipolar
  cell. This also causes an increase in the glutamatergic output from rod bipolar
  cells onto their output neurons AII (AII) and A17 (not shown) amacrine cells. Ganglion
  cell (GC) spontaneous activity and excitability is also increased, likely through
  inputs from the rod pathway. Additionally, dopamine levels from dopaminergic amacrine
  cells (DA) are decreased in the diabetic retina, leading to functional deficits.
