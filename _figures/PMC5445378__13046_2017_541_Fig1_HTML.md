caption: EGF-R and TGF-β signaling pathways interfered by E5. EGF-R and TGF-β share
  several signal transduction pathways, so that the inteference of hrHPV E5 on any
  of these receptors have effects on each other. TGF-β is an important immunosuppressive
  cytokine, which activates different transduction pathways interposed by E5 activity.
  In a natural condition (without any infection), TGF-β prioritizes SMAD pathway,
  which results in expression of several tumor suppressive proteins. In the HPV infection,
  SMAD pathway is hampered by HPV oncoproteins, whereas other alternative pathways
  are stimulated. (1) E5 is capable of increasing the EGF-R levels (by preventing
  the activities of c-Cbl and V-ATPase) and activating MAPK-ERK, NF-κB and PI3K pathways.
  (2 and 3) These pathways interact each other in an intricate regulation way. Ras
  protein stabilizes TGIF [], a co-inhibitor of SMAD pathway. Moreover, ERK activation
  inhibits the SMAD activity through phosphorylation [] and activates PI3K and NF-κB
  pathways []. In turn, activation of NF-κB and PI3K pathways by EGF-R cause a negative
  feedback on SMAD pathway. (4) E5 also inhibits TGF-βRII expression, (5) SMAD2 phosphorylation
  and (6) SMAD2-SMAD4 complex translocation to the nucleus []. (7) The activation
  of non-SMAD pathways leads to cell proliferation and disruption of cytokines synthesis,
  which stimulate tumor progression. (8) E5 can also can stimulates VEGF through EGF-R-PI3K-Akt
  signaling inducing angiogenesis []
