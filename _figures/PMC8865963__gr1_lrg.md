caption: Major cellular pathways in innate viral sensing and interferon induction
  in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early after viral infection, viral nucleic
  acids in the form of single-stranded (ss)RNA or double-stranded (ds)RNA of the viral
  genome or replication intermediates are recognized by cytosolic or membrane-bound
  pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These include the endosomal Toll-like receptors
  (TLR)3 and TLR7 recognizing dsRNA and ssRNA, respectively. In the cytosol, RIG-I
  and MDA recognize 5′triphosphorylated RNA species. These events trigger major signalling
  pathways, most notably governed by and dependent on the transcription factors NF-κB
  and interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs), inducing the production of type
  I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines. Type I IFN acts in an autocrine and paracrine
  manner by binding to cognate receptors composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 and signal
  through the JAK-STAT pathway to induce an antiviral program through expression of
  numerous IFN-stimulated genes. Molecules with known genetic defects conferring susceptibility
  to SARS-CoV-2 infection as described in the main text are marked with a red asterisk.
