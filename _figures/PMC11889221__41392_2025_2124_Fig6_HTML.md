caption: Role of Tissue Macrophages in Diseases. In neurodegenerative disorders such
  as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, macrophages are implicated in neuronal
  damage and neurotoxicity, involving the processing of amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein.
  In metabolic disorders like obesity, which represents a state of systemic chronic
  inflammation, macrophages accelerate the development of insulin resistance and affect
  the efficacy of cell-based immunotherapies through tumor-associated macrophage interactions.
  Additionally, the diverse functions of macrophages are also evident in the progression
  of hepatic diseases, including hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
