caption: '(a) Heatmap (average linkage hierarchical clustering with a Euclidian correlation
  distance matrix) of the amino acids (AAs) and glucosinolates (GLSs) identified in
  the leaves of savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea convar. capitata var. sabauda) of
  C: control, D: drought-stressed (for the whole duration of the experiment) and F:
  soil-flooded plants (drought stress with subsequent soil flooding, followed by a
  potential recovery phase) at the three harvest time points (T1, T2, and T3). A higher
  concentration of a metabolite in a stress group relative to the corresponding control
  plants is shown in yellow, a lower concentration is shown in blue. Grey and crossed-out
  boxes indicate metabolites that were not present in at least 50% of the replicates
  in that group, asterisks show significant differences between the groups (* p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01, Mann–Whitney U-test, n = 6). Abbreviations are given in ; (b)
  metabolic pathway map of the identified metabolites (black font), with the changes
  in metabolite concentration in the different treatment groups compared to the control
  group depicted in the color-coded heatmap stripes (order of stripes indicated in
  insert in the center top). Dashed lines indicate intermediates. Additional abbreviations
  are given in the top right box. (b) is based on the metabolic map designed by R.
