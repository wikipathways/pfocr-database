caption: In innate immune cells, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) network
  can be activated via multiple signals. Growth factors, Toll-like receptor (TLR)
  ligands or cytokines activate mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 through their cognate
  receptors. Receptor activation leads to the recruitment of class I phosphatidylinositol-3
  kinases (PI3Ks) to the receptor complex by different adaptors including the small
  GTPase RAB8A in macrophages. PI3Ks generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PtdInsP3) as a second messenger to recruit and activate the serine-threonine kinases
  AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3 via phosphorylation on threonine 308 by phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase 1 (PDPK1). This process is negatively regulated by phosphatase and
  tensin homologue (PTEN), which dephosphorylates PtdInsP3. mTORC2 phosphorylates
  AKT on serine 473, which seems to be required for full activation and substrate
  specificity of AKT. In addition, mTORC2 phosphorylates protein kinase C (PKC) and
  serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) to regulate important cellular
  processes such as cytoskeleton reorganization. Two main effectors of AKT are forkhead
  box O1 (FOXO1) and tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2). TSC2 forms a heterodimeric complex
  with TSC1 and inhibits mTORC1. Phosphorylation of TSC2 at threonine 1462 (Thr1462)
  by AKT inhibits its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity for the small GTPase
  RAS homologue enriched in brain (RHEB), which therefore remains in a GTP-bound active
  state and activates mTORC1 on the lysosome. In parallel to the PI3K-AKT pathway,
  the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38α, and COT also activate mTORC1
  via MK2- and ERK-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2, respectively,. AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) detects low cellular energy by sensing the AMP levels and
  inhibits mTORC1 by phosphorylating regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (RAPTOR)
  at serine 792 and TSC2 at serine 1387 that promotes the inhibitory function of the
  TSC1-TSC2 complex. mTORC1 senses amino acid sufficiency on the lysosome via RAG
  GTPases and the ragulator complex, which seems to be a prerequisite for mTORC1 activation
  by growth factors. Moreover, low levels of glucose-6-phosphate inactivate mTORC1
  by inducing binding to hexokinase 2 (HK2). Binding of the lipid metabolite phosphatidic
  acid (PA) to mTORC1 is also a prerequisite for mTORC1 activation. mTORC1-dependent
  phosphorylation of a variety of downstream effectors, such as eIF4E-binding protein
  1 (4E-BP1), 4E-BP2 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), promotes protein synthesis.
