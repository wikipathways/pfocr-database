caption: Potential role of chronic PE on mitochondrial function and structure. ATP
  degradation and calcium release caused by muscle contraction also significantly
  induce the PGC1-α and ULK1 downstream pathways. Also, muscle contraction stimulates
  large ROS released (by NOX2 and mitochondria activity), further activating the PGC1-α
  downstream. Acute PGC1-α activation results in gene transcription related to mitochondrial
  remodeling (mitofusin, mitofission, and mETC proteins) and mitophagy induction.
  Chronic PE will decrease the mitofission pathway and significantly enhance the mitofusion
  and mitophagy pathways. Consequently, the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, which
  can induce cell death (due to the release of cytochrome C), decreases due to chronic
  PE. Acute PE also activates P38, an important stimulator of PGC1-α. For example,
  the lack of activity of this protein can decrease PGC1-α activation, even when there
  are other stimuli (e.g., only AMPK stimulation). Also, P38 is activated by insulin;
  in turn, p38 increases cell glucose uptake upregulating GLUT1. Hypothetically, a
  sedentary lifestyle and insulin resistance decrease the pulsative activation of
  p38, thus decreasing mitochondrial remodeling potential. ADP, adenosine diphosphate;
