caption: 'Overview of protein kinase A signaling. In this signaling pathway, the binding
  of neurotransmitter (NT) to G protein–coupled receptors leads to the activation
  of G proteins, which, in turn, activate adenylyl cyclase, leading to the production
  of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In the inactive state, the α subunit of
  G protein is bound to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and to βγ subunits. The binding
  of agonists to receptors causes an interaction of receptors with G proteins, which,
  in turn, releases GDP in exchange with guanosine triphosphate (GTP). This leads
  to generation of α-GTP and a βγ subunit dimer. Both α and βγ subunits can interact
  with effectors. Protein kinase A (PKA) is a holoenzyme composed of two subunits:
  regulatory (R) and catalytic (C). These regulatory and catalytic subunits form a
  tetrameric holoenzyme (R2C2). In the absence of cAMP, PKA exists as a stable inactive
  tetramer. The catalytic activity of cAMP is suppressed when the C subunits form
  a complex with the R subunits. Cyclic AMP, generated in response to adenylyl cyclase
  activation, binds to the R subunits of tetrameric PKA holoenzymes. The binding of
  cAMP to an R subunit lowers its affinity for the C subunit. This causes the release
  of free C subunits. The C subunit can catalyze phosphorylation of substrates in
  the cytoplasm or, after translocation of the C subunits, in the nucleus. Protein
  kinase A is also anchored with A kinase–anchoring proteins, causes compartmentalized
  localization of PKA, and initiates phosphorylation of substrates in a localized
  fashion. One of the substrates of PKA is transcription factor cAMP response element
  binding (CREB) protein, which regulates the transcription of many neuronally expressed
  genes, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The exchange protein
  activated by cAMP (Epac) is stimulated by cAMP to exchange GDP with GTP on Rap1.
  Rap1 can also be regulated by phosphorylation by a C subunit of PKA. Deactivation
  of PKA is achieved through degradation of cAMP to 5’AMP by cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases
  (PDEs).'
