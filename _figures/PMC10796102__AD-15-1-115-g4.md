caption: The binding of CCL19/CCL21 to CCR7 activated signaling pathways in tumor
  cells, including PI3/Akt, MAPK/ERK and Jak/STAT, which enhanced the expression of
  VEGF-C and thus promoted lymphangiogenesis. Meanwhile, activation of the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3
  signaling pathway can promote the release of CCL19 and CCL21 in lymph nodes. Furthermore,
  activation of the CCR7 chemokine axis can promote dendritic cell entry into the
  T cell compartment of lymph nodes, which enables specific recognition of CD80/CD86
  on dendritic cells and CD28 on T cells. This activates T cells and promotes T cell
  infiltration into the tumour
