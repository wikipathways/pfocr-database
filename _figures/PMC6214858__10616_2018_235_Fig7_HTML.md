caption: Schematic flow diagram of signal transmission from regulatory factors secreted
  by TM4 cells to ADSCs. TM4 cells secrete multiple trophic factors such as transforming
  growth factor β (TGFβ), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factors
  (FGF). These factors interact with each other and promote the stemness and migration
  of ADSCs via PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK/12 and P38MAPK pathway. Among this, the purple arrows
  indicate signaling pathways related with apoptosis, the red arrows indicate signaling
  pathways related with cell proliferation, the blue arrows indicate signaling pathways
  related with cell proliferation, cell migration and differentiation. The green arrows
  indicate signaling pathways may be related with cell self-renew and multipotent
  differentiation potential. (Color figure online)
