caption: We have previously demonstrated that butyrate induces colonocyte apoptosis
  via a non-mitochondrial, Fas-mediated, extrinsic pathway which is antagonized by
  activated Ras []. DHA and butyrate work coordinately in the colon to initiate a
  distinct intrinsic proapoptotic cycle involving the activation of store-operated
  channels (SOC), leading to rapid entry of Ca2+ through the plasma membrane and mitochondrial
  Ca2+ loading. This directly or indirectly increases mitochondrial phospholipid hydroperoxides
  (PLOOH) and triggers the opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) and release
  of pro-apoptotic molecules like cytochrome C. These effects culminate in the induction
  of apoptosis.
