caption: Proposed signal transduction pathways in NG following receptor activation
  with leptin and CCK-8. There are two potential pathways for phosphorylation of STAT3.
  Leptin activates JAK2 phosphorylation at tyrosine 1138, which directly phosphorylates
  STAT3, or leptin activates PI3K via the insulin receptor substrate, leading to STAT3
  phosphorylation. CCK-8 activates PI3K via Src and RhoA, which leads to phosphorylation
  of STAT3, suggesting that PI3K is central to the synergistic leptin/CCK STAT3 phosphorylation.
  The MAPK inhibitor PD98059 had no effect on leptin and CCK-8 synergism, suggesting
  that the leptin/CCK-8-stimulated MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway was not involved in STAT3 phosphorylation.
  STAT3 usually acts by stimulating the transcription of target genes, but the rapid
  electrophysiological effects suggest STAT3 may be involved in modifying the activity
  of K+ channels.
