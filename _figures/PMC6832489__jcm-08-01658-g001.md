caption: The Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway in homeostasis. (a) In the
  absence of Wnt ligands, intracellular β-catenin levels are controlled by a destruction
  complex encompassing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2a), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3β)
  and casein kinase 1α (CK1α), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and AXIN1/2. This
  complex binds and phosphorylates β-catenin at serine and threonine residues, thereby
  targeting it for ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation by the proteasome. (b)
  In presence of Wnt, co-activation of the Frizzled and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins) receptors
  prevents the formation of the destruction complex leading to the stabilization and
  consequent translocation of β-catenin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Here, β-catenin
  interacts with members of the T-cell specific transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer
  binding factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors and modulates the expression
  of a broad spectrum of Wnt downstream target genes. DVL – disheveled. Adapted from
  [].
