caption: Glycolisis/Gluconeogenesis model pathway. The studied metabolic module is
  reported in the figure (KEGG data base at (26)) with the indication of the involved
  enzymes, the ellipse marks the portion of the metabolic module at the basis of the
  difference marked by the first principal component. The bolded enzymes are shared
  by all the 25 organisms data sets.
