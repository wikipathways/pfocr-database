caption: Diagrammatic representation of key alterations in signaling molecule expression
  and phosphorylation states as determined by examination of both SK-Hep-1 cell line
  models and TRAPS patient PBMCs expressing the C33Y TNFR1 variant, compared with
  cells expressing the WT TNFR1, or normal control sample PBMCs. The diagram does
  not show every target examined during this research project, but only indicates
  known signaling pathway interactions between different molecules. Dashed lines represent
  interactions involving more than one intermediate. Thick lines indicate where there
  is likely to be increased interaction and activation of downstream molecules or
  events. Signaling intermediates highlighted in green are those that are significantly
  upregulated in C33Y TRAPS patients’ PBMCs compared with those of healthy control
  individuals. The signaling intermediates highlighted in blue show no significant
  difference in levels between patient and control PBMCs.
