caption: The TGFβ pathway in muscular dystrophy. SPP1, encoding osteopontin (OPN),
  and TGFβ are co-regulated. A) When myofibers are injured, osteopontin and TGFβ signaling
  pathways are activated, leading to ECM accumulation and fibrosis of the muscle.
  B) TGFβ activates the SPP1 promoter through SMAD signaling. A SNP in the SPP1 promoter
  is associated with a more severe form of DMD. A SNP in TGFBR2 results in increased
  SPP1 expression. The “VTTT” allele of LTBP4 leads to increased TGFβ signaling and
  is associated with a more severe form of DMD. Treatment of myoblasts with TGFβ results
  in increased osteopontin expression. The mdx mouse deficient for SPP1/osteopontin
  has reduced TGFβ signaling and reduced fibrosis.
