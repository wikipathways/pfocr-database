caption: 'Wnt signaling. A simplified diagram ofWnt β-catenin dependent and independent
  signaling: a β-catenin-dependent pathway: β-catenin dependent signaling is initiated
  by binding of Wnts to frizzled seven transmembrane receptors. This binding leads
  to a series of events culminating in deactivation of a multi-protein β-catenin destruction
  complex. Subsequently, hypophosphorylated β-catenin translocates to the nucleus
  where it binds TCF/LEF transcription factors to regulate gene expression. b Wnt
  β-catenin independent/calcium pathway. Wnts binding to frizzled lead to calcium
  influx, which activates calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and NFAT. NFAT binds
  to its cognate target gene to regulate gene expression. c Wnt β-catenin independent/planar
  cell polarity pathway: Wnt binding to frizzled leads to Rac/Rho activation and subsequently
  to activation of kinases such as JNK that modulates cytoskeletal rearrangements.
