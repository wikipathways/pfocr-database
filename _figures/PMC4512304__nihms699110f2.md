caption: Ramification of IFN signaling pathways leading to immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive
  regulation of macrophage polarization. Viral infection of tissue-resident macrophages
  or nearby cells leads to production of type I and type III IFNs, which are perceived
  by distinct membrane-bound receptor complexes but stimulate similar signaling pathways
  in the infected or other proximal macrophages. In addition to the canonical signaling
  pathway through STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 (also known as the ISGF3) binding to IFN-stimulated
  response elements (ISREs) in gene promoters, leading to induction of a large number
  of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and pro-inflammatory responses, both types of IFNs,
  in particular manifested using type I IFNs, also signal through STAT1 homodimers,
  which are more commonly associated with the IFNγ-mediated signaling pathway for
  classical activation (M1) macrophages. Other STAT heterodimers and homodimers (including
  STAT3-6) may also be activated but lead to production of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive
  IL-10 and IL-1Ra. Other STAT-independent signaling pathways including MAPK- and
  PI3K-pathways also may be activated, thereby exerting diverse effects in macrophages
  as well as other immune cells (such effects on T cell, in particular Treg cell ratio),
  which critically regulate the outcomes of virus-host interaction through, at least
  in part, the modulation of macrophage polarization [,].
