caption: The interaction of cancer cells and astrocytes frequently causes astrocyte
  activation and the release of multiple growth factors that contribute to tumor progression.
  Astrocytes can also secrete exosomes containing microRNAs that silence key tumor
  suppressors such as PTEN. Co-culture of astrocytes with melanoma cells also limits
  responses to BRAF inhibition through increased PI3K/AKT activity in the melanoma
  cells. At the same time astrocytes connect directly to cancer cells through Connexin-43
  (Cx43) mediated gap junctions, where the transfer of the second messenger cGAMP
  activates the STING pathway in astrocytes leading to the release of IFNα and TNFα
  to stimulate STAT1 signaling in the cancer cells, leading to enhanced survival and
  chemoresistance.
