caption: Protein complex analysis. a Complex 1544—the Arc pathway, synaptic plasticity-related,
  is regulated by vortioxetine treatment at the mRNA level. b Complex 85—transcriptional
  regulation, including FOS modulated by vortioxetine at the mRNA level. c Complex
  163—endocytosis/neurotransmitter release pathways, including EPN1 that was upregulated
  in the qPCR study. d DLG4/PSD-95 network, including SEMA4G that was upregulated
  in the qPCR study. The connecting lines represent physical protein–protein interactions.
  The targets outlined in red indicate genes modulated in response to chronic vortioxetine
  treatment in adult rats. The scale indicates p values for significance of differential
  expression, ranging from green (p = 0) to dark red (p = 1). Targets with colored
  borders represent the rat p value, and center colors indicate mouse p values. Gray
  represents targets in which no qPCR data were obtained
