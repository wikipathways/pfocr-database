caption: Proposed roles of the newly identified trans-acting factors in the snoRNA
  trafficking pathway. After synthesis, intron removal, and core protein assembly
  in the nucleoplasm, yeast U3 snoRNA accumulates within the nucleolar body for cap
  hypermethylation, 3′-end trimming, and final assembly and then localizes to the
  nucleolus for function in rRNA biogenesis. The novel trans-acting factors identified
  in our study that are important for nucleolar body accumulation (NOP4, PRP21, and
  TAO3) and nucleolar targeting (SEC14 and HTL1) of U3 snoRNA are indicated.
