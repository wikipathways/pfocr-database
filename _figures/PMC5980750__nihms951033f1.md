caption: 'The signaling pathways mediated by protein kinase Hippo (Mst1/2 in mammals),
  the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (Yap; HGNC:16262) and transcriptional
  coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (Taz also known as WWTR1; HGNC:24042) have been
  recognized as important regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation, organogenesis
  and tissue regeneration (, ) (). After its functional significance as a major suppressor
  of tissue growth was first identified in Drosophila melanogaster, Hippo, a downstream
  signal transducer (Warts) and target (Yorkie) were found to have great structural
  and functional conservation in mammals (, , , , ). The upstream signals that activate/inhibit
  this pathway are still not completely understood, but the proposed initiators include
  mechanical forces, cellular stress, cellular polarity, and cell-cell contact (,
  , , , , , , ). Upon activation of the Hippo pathway, the serine-threonine kinase
  cascade involving Mammalian STE20-like protein kinase (Mst1/2 kinases) phosphorylates
  and activates a second class of kinases, large tumor suppressor kinases (Lats1/2).
  The Lats1/2 kinases phosphorylate Yap; this phosphorylation sequesters Yap in the
  cytoplasm, which prevents nuclear translocation and instead signals its proteasomal
  degradation (, ). Inhibition of the Hippo pathway enables unphosphorylated Yap to
  translocate to, and be retained in, the nucleus (, ). Within the nucleus, due to
  its lack of a DNA binding domain, Yap binds to sets of transcription factors. One
  major family identified is the TEA domain transcription factor [Tead1–4; HGNC: 11714–11717]
  (, , ). Binding to Tead causes transcription of target genes responsible for cellular
  proliferation and inhibition of cellular apoptosis, among them cyclins, inhibitors
  of apoptosis (IAP), and connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf) (, , ). Other transcription
  factors that interact with Yap/Taz are PPXY-motif containing proteins such as tumor
  suppressor p73, Smads, and Runx2. PPXY-motif interacts with the WW domain of Yap
  (, , , ). Additionally, Tbx5, which lacks a WW domain-interacting PPXY-motif, physically
  interacts with transcription coactivator Taz via multiple domains, including its
  carboxyl-terminal sequence (). The Hippo-Yap pathway, which we define in this review
  as Mst1/2-Lats1/2 signaling influencing Yap, also interacts with numerous other
  pathways, including Wnt, Bmp, Tgfβ, Shh, and Notch (, , , , , , , , , , , ). The
  diversity of these pathways highlights the impact of Yap on multiple biological
  processes and the complexity of its regulatory pathways. Because the role of the
  Hippo-Yap signaling pathway during development has been particularly well studied
  during embryogenesis of the mouse eye, we will briefly highlight the complex processes
  that occur during embryogenesis of mouse ocular tissues. Ocular development is a
  complex process that depends on various signaling pathways. The Hippo-Yap signaling
  pathway affects multiple stages of embryonic eye formation.'
