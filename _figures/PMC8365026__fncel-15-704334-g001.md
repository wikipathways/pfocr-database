caption: UPR of ER stress in cerebral ischemia determines cell fate through PERK,
  IRE1, and ATF6 pathways. Under the ischemic state, PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP axis controls
  cell fate by apoptosis where p- eyIF2α play a key role in inhibiting protein synthesis
  and its role will be reversed by PERK inhibitor GSK2606414. GADD34, which is simultaneously
  regulated by ATF4 and CHOP promotes promoting the dephosphorylation of eIF2α under
  prolonged ER stress. Similarly, the role of GADD34 can disappear with the intervention
  of salubrinal and guanabenz. The rescue of cell fate by ATF4 is mainly achieved
  by inhibiting autophagy and controlling the ER chaperones. The different expression
  of XBP1 induced by ATF6 and IRE1α can also bring disparate endings to the cell.
  MAPK apoptosis pathway and NF-κB inflammation related to IRE1α can directly determine
  cell survival.
