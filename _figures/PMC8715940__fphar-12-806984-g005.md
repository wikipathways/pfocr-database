caption: Enrichment analysis of GO biological process of UR targets associated with
  Aβ, tau pathology and Alzheimer disease pathway. (A) Top 20 bubble chart of biological
  process (BP) of GO enrichment analysis. The X-axis represents the rich factor, bubble
  size represents the count of targets enriched in terms and the color represents
  the p value. (B,C) PPI network of UR targets involved in neuron death (GO:0070997)
  and learning or memory (GO:0007611). The darker the color, the higher the degree.
  The thickness of the edges represents the combined score.
