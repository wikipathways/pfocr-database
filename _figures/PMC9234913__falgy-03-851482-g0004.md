caption: Hypothetical involvement of HIF in the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia.
  A dysbiotic gut microbiota may lead to alterations in the SCFA profile and bile
  acid pool and therefore the inappropriate activation of cellular stress response
  pathways, such as HIF. Immune dysfunction may serve as another contributing factor
  to cellular stress response pathways via pro-inflammatory cytokine production and
  consequent epithelial tissue damage. A dysregulated HIF transcriptional pathway
  may have downstream effects on the expression of HIF transcriptional targets that
  mediate eosinophil recruitment and barrier structure in FD. For example, HIF mediated
  upregulation of TNF and IL-1β, which have been shown to be raised in FD inflammation,
  may contribute to FD duodenal eosinophilia. Similarly, decreases in the expression
  of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 have been described in FD. Given the role of HIF
  in maintaining the integrity of the epithelial barrier, HIF dysregulation presents
  a possible pathway through which the differences in expression of these cell adhesion
  proteins and in turn barrier dysfunction in FD may be explained. Both, duodenal
  eosinophilia and losses in mucosal integrity serve as key contributing factors to
  the low-grade duodenal inflammation seen in FD. In this way, HIF dysregulation may
  have a hypothetical role to play in driving the pathophysiology of FD. SCFAs, Short-chain
  fatty acids; HIF, Hypoxia-inducible factor; TNF, Tumor Necrosis Factor; IL-1β, Interleukin-1β;
  ZO-1, Zonula occludens-1.
