caption: 'Bold and underlined compounds showed cofactors produced or consumed in catabolic
  steps. Bold and italic letters indicated enzymes involved in D-ribose biosynthesis,
  which abbreviated as follows: G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; XPE, xylulose-5-phosphate
  epimerase; RPI, ribulose-5-phosphate isomerase; PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate sugar transferring
  system; TA, transaldolase; TK, transketolase; XI, xylose isomerase; XK, xylulokinase.
  And other metabolites abbreviated below: G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  Gly3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; Pyr, pyruvate; AcetCoA, acetyl-CoA; AT, acetoin;
  2,3-BD, 2,3-butanediol; Acet-P, acetyl phosphate; Acet, acetic acid; Ribu5P, ribulose-5-phosphate;
  X5P, xylulose-5- phosphate; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate, E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate.
  Crosses indicated the disruption of the transketolase gene, leading to blocking
  the non-oxidative PP pathway. Oval symbols indicated the sugar transport system'
