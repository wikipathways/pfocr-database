caption: (A) Overview of affected metabolic pathways from a N. ceranae infection that
  have been determined from previous transcriptomic and proteomic analysis[, , ] and
  additional new pathways affected suggested by significant differences in metabolite
  relative abundances from the exposomic analysis. TCA represents The Citric Acid
  Cycle while the ETC represents the Electron Transport Chain. (B) Location of the
  14 significantly higher or lower relative abundance compounds mapped onto 9 corresponding
  Apis mellifera metabolic pathways using the KEGG database. Compounds with significantly
  lower relative abundances are denoted with a red dot while chemicals with significantly
  higher abundances are denoted with a green dot. The pathways potentially affected
  are shown with different colors and their immediate connections revealed by comparing
  uninfected and uninfected hives are marked in red. Each color denotes a different
  metabolic pathway that contains a corresponding label. Other chemical names in the
  pathways are not labeled and less connected metabolic pathways have been removed
  for clarity. Grey boxes represent metabolic pathways not directly linked to a change
  in metabolite relative abundance in N. ceranae infected hives. (C) The difference
  of the means in fold changes (log 2) for the significant 14 chemical relative abundances
  identified between N. ceranae infected and uninfected hives corresponding to the
  nine KEGG pathways shown in Fig 2B. Error bars represent standard deviation of the
  difference between N. ceranae uninfected and infected chemical abundances.
