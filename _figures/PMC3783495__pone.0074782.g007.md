caption: 'The results of the present study revealed the following possible mechanisms:
  NF-κB activation stimulated by LPS directly promotes the expression of miR-33s and
  inflammatory cytokine production. miR-33s repress the expression of ABCA1 and subsequently
  decrease the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids. Inhibition of the efflux of
  macrophage lipids and promotion of inflammatory cytokine release lead to increased
  atherosclerosis. BA treatment decreases the phospho-protein levels of IκBα and the
  subsequent NF-κB activation. Inhibition of NF-κB activation suppresses miR-33s expression
  and promotes ABCA1-dependent lipid efflux in macrophages. In addition, BA possesses
  an anti-inflammatory activity by reducing the levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. Together,
  BA plays an important role in the reduction of atherosclerotic lesions. →: Activation;
  ┤: inhibition.'
