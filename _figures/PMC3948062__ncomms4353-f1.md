caption: 'Introduced enzymes and pathways are depicted in magenta. 16C pheromones
  are produced from preexisting cytosolic pool of 16:CoA whereas 14C pheromones are
  produced from a cytosolic 14:CoA pool created by introduction of a Cuphea palustris
  thioesterase intersecting chloroplast de novo acyl synthesis at 14C level. The genes
  for the enzymes involved in the pheromone production in this study were cloned from
  various moth and plant species: CpFATB2, Cuphea palustris 14:ACP thioesterase; AveΔ11,
  Argyrotaenia velutinana desaturase; CroΔ11, Choristoneura rosaceana desaturase;
  CpaE11, Choristoneura parallela desaturase; OnuΔ11, Ostrinia nubilalis desaturase;
  AtrΔ11, Amyelois transitella desaturase, HarFAR, Helicoverpa armigera acyl reductase;
  YroFAR, Yponomeuta rorellus acyl reductase, OnuFAR_E/Z, Ostrinia nubilalis acyl
  reductase, EaDAcT, Euonymus alatus acetyltransferase. Acyl intermediates in the
  pathway (also throughout the article) are given as short forms, for instance, E/Z11-14:CoA
  refers to the fatty-acyl coenzyme A with a chain length of 14-carbon atoms and a
  double bond at Δ11 position in ‘E’ or ‘Z’ configuration. ACP, acyl carrier protein;
  FFA, free fatty acid; OH, fatty alcohol; OAc, acetate.'
