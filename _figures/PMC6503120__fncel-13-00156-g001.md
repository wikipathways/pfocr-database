caption: The classical p53-dependent nucleolar stress response pathway. Nucleolar
  stress is caused by e.g., mutation of ribosomal proteins (RP), impaired transcription
  of rDNA into rRNA, abrogated rRNA processing, disrupted nucleolar integrity as well
  as by genotoxic stressors, such as UV irradiation. As a consequence, RPs are released
  and bind and inhibit the E3-ubiquitin ligase MDM2. In turn, p53 is no longer degraded
  in the proteasome and is stabilized. Given the p53 accumulation, p53-mediated effects
  are propagated, such as cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis or genotoxic stress.
  Note that also p53-independent routes exist, which are not indicated in this scheme.
