caption: DV enters the monocytes and uncoat. The capsid protein enters the nucleus
  and triggers the acetylation of HMGB1 by PCAF complex. HMGB1 then translocates from
  the nucleus to cytoplasm, a process that can be inhibited by EP. HMGB1 gets released
  from the monocytes and binds to RAGE receptors on endothelial cells, triggering
  a signalling pathway which leads to the lost of vascular integrity. The increased
  in vascular leakage can be repressed by HMGB1-neutraling antibody or anti-RAGE antibody.
