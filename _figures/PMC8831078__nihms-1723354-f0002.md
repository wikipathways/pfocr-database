caption: Multiple proposed mechanisms of AMPA receptor ubiquitination. GluA1-containing
  AMPA receptor subunits can be ubiquitinated (Ub) by multiple pathways. 1.) AMPA
  stimulation leads to ubiquitination of GluA1 subunits by the E3 ligase Nedd4-1.
  This pathway requires Ca2+signaling and is thought to lead to lysosome-dependent
  degradation of GluA1. This may be counteracted by the DUBs, USP46 or USP8 and PKA
  phosphorylation of the GluA1 C-terminal tail at Ser-845. 2.) Treatment of neurons
  with bicuculline (BIC) leads to recruitment of APCCdh1 to EphA4 which stimulates
  K48-linked ubiquitination of GluA1. This process leads to proteasome-dependent GluA1
  degradation. 3.) BIC, AMPA, or kainate stimulation lead to ubiquitination of all
  AMPA receptor subunits and phosphorylation of GluA2 on Ser-880. The E3 ligase RNF167
  coordinates with the E2s UBE2D1 and UBE2N to promote the ubiquitination of GluA2
  AMPA receptor subunits. These pathways are thought to lead to lysosome-dependent
  degradation. 4.) Treatment of neurons with picrotoxin (PTX) engages Mdm2 dependent
  ubiquitination of p53 and forms a complex with FMRP. FMRP is required for Nedd4-2
  phosphorylation which ubiquitinates GluA1 via K48-linkages to promote proteasome-dependent
  degradation of GluA1. This process can be blocked by the phosphatase, PLPP.
