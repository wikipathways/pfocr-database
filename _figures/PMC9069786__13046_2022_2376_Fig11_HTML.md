caption: Schematic overview of the mechanistic basis for the observed study results.
  IL-6 plays an oncogenic role in OSCC progression by activating JAK2/STAT3/Sox4/NLRP3
  pathway. IL-6 could accelerate OSCC cell proliferation by activating inflammasome
  via JAK2/STAT3/Sox4/NLRP3 pathways. STAT3 played as a transcription factor which
  positively regulated Sox4, and IL-6 promotes Sox4 expression by activating JAK2/STAT3
  pathway. IL-6 could promote proliferation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation via
  JAK2/STAT3/Sox4 pathway in OSCC cells
