caption: Experimental overview. Schematic overview for the development of prediction
  models for lapatinib sensitivity in human bladder cancer cell lines. Thirty-nine
  bladder cancer cell lines were subjected to in vitro determination of lapatinib
  sensitivity, baseline microarray gene expression profiling, and EGFR pathway phosphoprotein
  profiling by reverse-phase protein microarrays in parallel. Using these data for
  cell lines showing in vitro sensitivity and resistance to lapatinib through the
  MiPP algorithm, models were developed and evaluated based on all microarray data,
  EGFR pathway phosphoprotein data and a subset of array data for known EGFR pathway
  proteins.
