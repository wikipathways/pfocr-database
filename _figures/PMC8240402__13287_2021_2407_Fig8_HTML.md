caption: Summary of hPMSC-mediated PD-1 expression on CD4+IL-10+ T cells and mitigation
  of liver damage in GVHD model mice. The oxidative stress aggravated during GVHD
  and indirectly induced by the imbalance in the percentage of CD4+IL-10+T cells and
  the expression of PD-1 on CD4+IL-10+T cells. These factors elicited the inflammatory
  and redox response in the GVHD liver and resulted in the occurrence of liver damage.
  The hPMSCs can enhance Nrf2 activation and attenuate the activation of NF-κB, which
  reduces the oxidative stress and increase the percentage of CD4+IL-10+T cells by
  suppressing the CD4+IL-10+T cell apoptosis induced by PD-1 in CD4+IL-10+T cells.
  Both effects reduce the inflammatory and redox responses, further alleviating the
  liver damage observed in GVHD mice
