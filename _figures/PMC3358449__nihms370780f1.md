caption: 'Key components in the regulation of methionine metabolism. In vivo, both
  free and protein bound methionine can be oxidized by reactive oxygen and nitrogen
  species. msrA and msrB can reverse the methionine oxidation to replenish the methionine
  pool. The vast majority of methionine is found in proteins. The most important role
  of methionine in intermediary metabolism is in one carbon transfer. Methionine is
  required for generation of SAM, the major biological methyl donor in vivo. In the
  transmethylation cycle, SAM is converted to SAH, primarily by GNMT in the liver.
  SAH is further hydrolyzed to form homocysteine, which can be remethylated to regenerate
  methionine by MS or BHMT. Homocysteine can also undergo an irreversible transsulfuration
  pathway to form cystathionine. This also occurs mainly in the liver and is catalyzed
  by the enzyme CBS. The abbreviations are: MS, methionine synthase; BHMT, betaine-homocysteine
  methyltransferase; GNMT, glycine N-methyltransferase; CBS, cystathionine –synthase;
  Ox, oxidizing species; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine'
