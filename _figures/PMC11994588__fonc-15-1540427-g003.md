caption: 'The Role of Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) in Cellular Signal Transduction
  Pathways. (A) Ras Signaling Pathway: Ras proteins, as small GTP-binding entities,
  utilize LLPS to form phase-separated microenvironments near the cell membrane. This
  increases the local concentration of Ras and its effectors, enhancing signal transduction.
  Raf kinase forms LLPS droplets with scaffold protein KSR1, enriching downstream
  kinases MEK and ERK. (B) SynGAP and PSD-95: These proteins experience concentration-dependent
  LLPS, creating dynamic, membrane-deficient, protein-rich phases. This hinders Ras/Rap
  GTPase activation, thus modulating the Ras signaling pathway. (C) Wnt Signaling
  Pathway: LLPS facilitates the assembly of the β-catenin destruction complex (DC),
  wherein Axin1 and APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Co) form condensates concentrating
  other DC components. This promotes β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. Upon
  Wnt pathway activation, LRP6 phosphorylation inhibits Axin1’s phase separation,
  reducing DC assembly. DC condensates interact with Wnt receptor complexes, forming
  larger aggregates crucial for signal transduction. (D) Insulin Signaling Pathway:
  Upon insulin stimulation, PI3K and its effectors, like Akt, localize to specific
  membrane regions, forming phase-separated condensates. This spatial organization
  amplifies PI3K activity, providing efficiency and specificity in signal transduction
  through more effective interactions with substrates and regulatory partners. (E)
  Tumor Suppressor p53: The transactivation domain of p53 binds to Poly-PR or Poly-GR
  sequences, inducing LLPS, which affects transcription regulation, cell cycle control,
  DNA repair, and apoptosis'
