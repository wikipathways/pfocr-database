caption: 'Schematic representation of the pinene production strategy and modifications
  to enhance the production in D. radiodurans. D. radiodurans carbohydrate sources
  including glycerol, glucose, and amino acids catabolism and pyruvate (Pyr) production
  in the cell. Pyr with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P) is converted to 1-Deoxy-D-Xylulose
  5-Phosphate (DXP) by the enzyme 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS). Following
  this pathway, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP)
  molecules are produced. Afterward, GPP synthase produces a GPP molecule from these
  two molecules. Finally, pinene synthase (Ps) catalyzes synthesis of pinene by cyclizing
  GPP. Black arrows indicate the natural path inside the cell; purple arrows indicate
  overexpression in the pathway; green arrows indicate heterologous expression, and
  the cross sign indicates the inactivation of the gene in the cell. The abbreviations
  of the pathway are as follows: Ec. GPPs, E. coli GPP synthase gene; Dr1395, native
  GPP synthase; Dr0862, native phytoene synthase'
