caption: The synthesized cDNA was applied to a TaqMan array 96-well fast plate, and
  comparative Ct method for relative quantification was performed. The delta delta
  Ct value was determined by subtracting the delta Ct of the control sample from the
  individual delta Ct of the test sample. Significant changes in butyrate-induced
  gene expression were analyzed based on more than 5-fold changes compared to the
  control group. MAPKAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase activated protein kinase;
  P, protein
