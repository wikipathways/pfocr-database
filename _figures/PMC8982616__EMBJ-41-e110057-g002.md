caption: (1) Autophagosome biogenesis is locally regulated at synapses and increases
  in response to neuronal activity. ATG9, the only transmembrane protein in the core
  autophagy pathway, undergoes exo‐ and endocytosis in an activity‐dependent manner
  and couples autophagosome biogenesis at presynaptic sites with the activity‐dependent
  synaptic vesicle cycle. (2) At the postsynapse, autophagic ATG8/LC3 containing vesicles
  can be generated in dendrites upon induction of long‐term depression (LTD). Collectively,
  this mechanism contributes to the removal of PSD‐95 from synapses, which in turn
  leads to an increase in AMPAR surface mobility, as well as removal of AMPAR raising
  the possibility that autophagy pathway is involved in activity‐dependent synaptic
  changes. (3) Synaptic activity reduces the motility of autophagosomes in dendrites
  and (4) increases their presence in dendrites. (5) Amphisomes, hybrid organelles
  resulting from the fusion of autophagosomes with endosomal compartments, enable
  local TrkB signaling at bouton. This promotes neurotransmitter release and might
  serve to mediate activity‐dependent synaptic changes. (6) Neuronal ER‐phagy is involved
  in regulation of pre‐synaptic excitatory neurotransmission by controlling the axonal
  endoplasmic reticulum and calcium release from ER stores.
