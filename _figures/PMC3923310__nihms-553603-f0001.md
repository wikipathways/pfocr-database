caption: 'The trypsin-like protease seminase is cleaved while still in the male reproductive
  tract during mating, leading to the processing of the astacin metalloprotease CG11864.
  Both cleavages are predicted to active the respective proteases. Seminase is required
  for localization of other Sfps to the female sperm storage organs, which in turn
  is required for the post-mating processes regulated by sex peptide (right half of
  figure). As depicted, sex peptide is cleaved only from the sperm tail and not the
  head (). In the short-term response pathway, seminase—through activation of CG11864—regulates
  processing of two Sfps: ovulin and Acp36DE (left half of figure). The trypsin protease
  inhibitor Acp62F may also interact with this pathway, as it affects ovulin processing.
