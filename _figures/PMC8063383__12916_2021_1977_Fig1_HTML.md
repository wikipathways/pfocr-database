caption: Overview of folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 in homocysteine metabolism.
  Homocysteine is reconverted to methionine by receiving a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate,
  the active form of folate, or betaine in the remethylation pathway. Irreversible
  removal of homocysteine occurs through the transsulphuration pathway where homocysteine
  condenses with serine to form cystathionine
