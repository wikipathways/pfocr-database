caption: 'Mechanisms of NSCLC immunotherapy resistance. In primary resistance mechanism,
  KRAS/STK11 co-mutation is the main genomic driver of primary ICI resistance, which
  reduces lymphocyte infiltration and PD-L1 expression. EGFR is the upstream signaling
  pathway of KRAS. When EGFR is activated, ILT4 levels rise, which increases the recruitment
  of M2-TAMs and inhibits immune function. EGFR mutant tumor cells inhibit T cell
  proliferation and associated functions and exhibit a significant increase in resistance
  to T cell-mediated killing. In contrast to EGFR WT NSCLC, EGFR mutant tumor cells
  express a higher level of CD73, and the LAG-3 receptor expressed on T cells is notably
  upregulated following TKI treatment. At the same time, circ-CPA4 regulates the growth,
  migration, dryness, and drug resistance of NSCLC cells through the let-7 miRNA/PD-L1
  axis. Exhausted MAIT cells produced high levels of IL-17A, which was associated
  with a poor prognosis. The loss of chromosome 9p21 is associated with primary resistance
  to ICI and CDKN2A, and MTAP deletions account for about 9.2%. IL-6 can activate
  the JAK1/STAT3 pathway to enhance PD-L1 expression. The level of IL-6 is negatively
  correlated with CD8+ T cells. VEGF can induce M2 macrophages to enhance the immunosuppressive
  effect. The overexpression of xCT in TAMs participates in the regulation of the
  TME, which can promote M2 polarization and inhibit immunity. Mitochondria produce
  ROS, promote oxidative stress, and immunosuppressive components combine with tumor
  acidity to maintain tumor growth and block antitumor immune response. In addition,
  the B2M deletion of HLA-I complex is also associated with immune escape. Figure
