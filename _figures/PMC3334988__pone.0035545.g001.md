caption: A. Myrosinase-catalyzed hydrolysis of glucosinolates upon plant tissue disruption
  yields an unstable aglucone which most commonly rearranges to a toxic isothiocyanate.
  Larvae of P. rapae redirect glucosinolate breakdown to the formation of simple nitriles
  by the gut nitrile-specifier protein (NSP). R, variable side chain. B. Examples
  of glucosinolates with aromatic (i.e. benzene ring-containing) side chains. C. Upon
  ingestion of plant material by P. rapae larvae, 1 and 2 are converted to phenylacetonitrile
  (3) and 3-phenylpropionitrile (4), respectively. These undergo further metabolism
  to the glycine conjugates 5–7 which are excreted with the feces. The major metabolite
  of 1 is hippuric acid (N-benzoylglycine, 5; 23, 24), the major metabolite of 2 is
  N-(3-phenylpropionyl)glycine (7, this study). N-phenylacetylglycine (6) is formed
  as a minor metabolite from both glucosinolates. This study establishes the pathways
  from 3 and 4 to 5–7. While the conversion of 3 to 5 involves a C1-loss through HCN
  release (route a), the side chain of 4 is maintained throughout its major metabolic
  pathway (route e). Reactions a, b and c are catalyzed by an NADPH-dependent microsomal
  enzyme activity. Reaction d, and likely, reaction e involve nitrilase activity from
  the ingested plant material. Compounds 9, 11b and 12 were detected as intermediates
  in this study. Bold and thin arrows indicate major and minor metabolic pathways,
  respectively.
