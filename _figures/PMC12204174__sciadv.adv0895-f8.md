caption: In the dark, hypocotyls are insensitive to ABA, despite an intact ABA signaling
  pathway being present and ABA-responsive genes being induced. The accumulation of
  PIFs in the dark transcriptionally induces SAUR gene expression. SAURs interact
  with PP2C.D, preventing them to interact with and dephosphorylate the PM H+-ATPase
  (14, 76). Under these conditions, hypocotyls are insensitive to ABA. In the absence
  of PIFs, the level of SAURs is reduced and PP2CD.2 can dephosphorylate the PM H+-ATPase,
  rendering hypocotyls sensitive to ABA. The mutation of PP2C.D2M331K makes the phosphatase
  unable to be inhibited by SAURs, restoring hypocotyl responsiveness to ABA, as in
  pifq mutants. The hypocotyl responses to ABA in the dark involve a canonical ABA
  perception by the PYL receptors and PP2C.A-type phosphatases. In the light, ABA
  down-regulates auxin synthesis and signaling, which is also regulated by PIFs. ABA
  inhibition of hypocotyl elongation depends on auxin transport. Blue lines represent
  a path or step that promotes cell elongation, and orange lines represent inhibition
  or regulation by ABA. Dashed lines represent connections or mechanisms that are
  not active or are not important for cell elongation in the WT plants in the represented
  condition (dark or light)
