caption: Three enriched GeneGo pathways from Figure  were retrieved and reconstructed,
  and the miRNA-mRNA regulation pairs were also appended. A. The AKT signaling pathway.
  The target genes and their related network of miR-218, miR-197, miR-145, miR-122,
  and let-7b were found to consist of PI3K and the AKT3 signaling network, which is
  part of the AKT signaling pathway. B. Influence of Ras and Rho proteins on the G1/S
  Transition. C. The role of the SCF complex in cell cycle regulation. MiR-218, miR-145,
  miR-197, miR-149, miR-122, and let-7b were indicated to influence the function of
  Ras and Rho proteins and the SCF complex and thus could contribute to the development
  of CRPC. D. The legend for the symbols included in these pathway maps.
