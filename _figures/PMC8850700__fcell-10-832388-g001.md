caption: Relevant molecular mechanisms of DUXAP10 in the process of cell invasion
  and migration in cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma, DUXAP10 enhances cell invasion
  and migration through the Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. In papillary
  thyroid carcinoma, DUXAP10 mediates the activity of the Akt/mTOR pathway to regulate
  cancer cell invasion and migration. In gastric cancer, DUXAP10 is involved in the
  regulation of invasion and migration via combination with the RNA-binding protein
  HuR and subsequently increases the stability of β-catenin. In esophageal carcinoma,
  DUXAP10 regulates cell metastasis by binding with EZH2 and inhibiting p21 expression.
