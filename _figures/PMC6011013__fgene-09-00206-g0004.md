caption: 'mRNA expression data: BMD+DAD-screening network using Coxnet (left) and
  ADMMnet (right) methods with mRNA expression data and the integration of mRNA data
  and CNAs profiles. Non isolated genes are represented as nodes in the network, then
  a link a drawn between two (adjacent) genes when the two genes belong to the same
  KEGG pathway. We use different colors for KEGG pathways and three colors to identify
  the type gene: orange color for genes-HEFaIMp-high, green color for genes-HEFaIMp-low,
  purple color for genes-no-HEFaIMp. Triangular-shaped nodes indicate the genes identified
  in literature as breast-cancer associated genes. The number of papers is also reported
  in the triangular nodes.'
