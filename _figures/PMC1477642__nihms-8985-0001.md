caption: Signaling pathway. Upon binding of the chemoattractant cAMP to the receptor,
  the subunits of the G-protein dissociate. This response leads to parallel and complementary
  regulation of two enzymes. PI3K, moves to the cell membrane, where its role is to
  synthesize PI(3,4,5)P3. In contrast, PTEN, which destroys PI(3,4,5)P3 and which
  is originally on the cell membrane, is released. Both these localizations, and the
  corresponding formation of PI(3,4,5)P3, are transient. Finally, PI(3,4,5)P3 accumulation
  leads to the formation of F-actin.
