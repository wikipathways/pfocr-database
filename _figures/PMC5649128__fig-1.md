caption: TGF-β1 signaling pathways and collagen homeostasis. Collagen synthesis is
  usually controlled by two distinct TGF-β signaling pathways, Smad and TAK1/MKK3/p38.
  TRAF6 regulates the canonical Smad pathway via cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8.
  In addition, there are Smad-independent pathways involving TAK1/MKK3/p38, the latter
  including a negative feedback loop involving Beclin-1. Beclin-1 is critical to autophagy-dependent
  collagen degradation in the heart and kidney in murine models as well as in cardiac
  myocytes and renal tubular cells examined in vitro. IL, interleukin; TGF-β, transforming
  growth factor-β; TRAF6, TRAF6 tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6.
