caption: Arrows indicate enzyme reactions with enzymes manipulated in the present
  study indicated in green and italicized. Open circles, essential genes; closed circles,
  nonessential genes; blue, overexpressed genes; red, knockdown or nulls in chemogenetic
  experiments. A gray square indicates an enzyme whose activity has not been studied
  or a gene essentiality that has not been analyzed. The red circles with white asterisks
  indicate TbSYJ1 which is annotated as synaptojanin (N-terminal domain) and is predicted
  to be a PI/IP 5-phosphatase. At least two genes encode enzymes with TbPIP5K, TbPIP5Pase
  and TbIMPase predicted activity. Annotation is based on predicted or demonstrated
  function ().
