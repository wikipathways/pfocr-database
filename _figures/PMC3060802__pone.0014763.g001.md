caption: The mevalonate pathway is localized to the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells
  and supports the biosynthesis of numerous terpenoids using different precursor molecules,
  while ergosterol is the dominant terpenoid. Whole genome Illumina-Solexa sequencing
  of CEN.PK113-7D and S288C was completed prior to our study, and SNPs strictly related
  to metabolic genes were identified . There were clear correlations between physiology
  and pathway enrichment of non-silent SNPs observed in genes involved in the ergosterol
  biosynthesis (red font indicates non-silent SNPs, while blue font indicates silent
  ones), suggesting that genome-sequencing may assist in reducing the genetic target
  space for metabolic engineering applications. Various combinations of over-expressions
  (single, double, triple) of genes coding for phosphomevalonate kinase (Erg8), squalene
  synthase (Erg9), and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (HFA1) may yield yeast strains
  capable of accumulating excess levels of β-amyrin, a triterpene molecule originating
  from oxidosqualene.
