caption: Localization, intracellular trafficking, and signaling pathways of nucleic
  acid-sensing Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are synthesized
  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to endosomes via UNC93B1. Each
  TLR is transported to its destination [endosomes, endolysosomes, and lysosome-related
  organelles (LRO)] by individual mechanisms. TLR9 requires the AP-2 complex to translocate
  from the cell surface to endosomes, whereas TLR7 interacts with the AP-4 complex
  for direct trafficking to endosomes. Several endosomal proteases and endoribonucleases
  in endosomes/endolysosomes process TLRs and nucleic acids, respectively. Upon the
  recognition of cognate ligands, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 recruit MyD88 to activate downstream
  signaling pathways. MyD88 recruits IRAKs and TRAF6, which subsequently activate
  TAK1. Activated TAK1 leads to the activation of AP-1 through MAPK to initiate the
  transcription of proinflammatory cytokines. NF-κB is also activated by TAK1 and
  induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines. In pDCs, TLR7 and TLR9 in LRO
  induce the activation of IRF7 by forming a complex with TRAF6, TRAF3, IKKα; and
  IRF7, which results in the expression of type I IFNs. An AP-3 complex is required
  for the localization of TLR7 and TLR9 to LRO. TLR3 recruits TRIF to initiate downstream
  signaling pathway. TRIF recruits TRAF3 and TRAF6 to activate TBK1 and TAK1. Activated
  TBK1 induces type I IFNs through IRF3, and TAK1 induces proinflammatory cytokine
  production through NF-κB and AP-1.
