caption: 'A The essential amino acid tryptophan (TRP) is the precursor of 5-hydroxytryptophan
  (5-HTP) which forms serotonin. However, the majority of peripheral TRP enters the
  kynurenine pathways thanks to two rate-limiting enzymes: the liver tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase
  (TDO) and the extra-hepatic indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). The activity of IDO
  is negligible under basal conditions but dramatically inducible by inflammatory
  signals. Kynurenine (KYN) can be then metabolized through three distinct pathways
  to form kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and anthranilic acid (AA)
  by the action of kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT), kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO)
  and kynurenase enzymes, respectively. 3-HK can be further converted into xanthurenic
  acid (XAN), whereas both 3-HK and AA may be enzymatically converted to 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid (3-HANA), which in turn form picolinic acid (PIC) and quinolinic acid (QUIN).
  The final product of the pathway is nicotamine adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ), an
  important cofactor in cellular reactions linked to energy metabolism. B Plasma concentration
