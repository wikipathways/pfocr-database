caption: Releases and signalling of IL-33. Full length of IL-33 is predominantly expressed
  by stromal cells, endothelial and epithelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts.
  In necrosis, IL-33 is released and binds to ST2L/IL1-RAcP heterodimer receptor,
  which induces signalling via TIR domain of ST2L/IL1-RAcP and recruits MyD88 and
  followed by IRAK1/4 and TRAF6. TRAF6 further induces either MAPK which in turns
  activating P38, ERK and JNK, and/or IKK pathway which activate NF-κB. Both pathways
  lead to the recruitment of transcription factors and proinflammatory cytokines,
  which consequently drives the regulatory transcription factors of Th2 cytokines
  and chemokines. Alternatively, binding of IL-33 to sST2 neutralises the proinflammatory
  effect of IL-33 as well as with SIGIRR which negatively regulates ST2L signalling
  pathway. In apoptosis, IL-33 is cleaved and deactivated by caspase-3/7.
