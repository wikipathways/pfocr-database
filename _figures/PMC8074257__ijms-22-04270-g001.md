caption: Schematic representation of leptin signaling pathway cascade. Leptin binds
  to its dimerized membrane receptor, and signal propagation starts. Janus kinase
  2 (JAK2) phosphorylation causes transition of phosphate groups to three tyrosines
  within BOX2 of ObR and activation of (i) SH2-domain containing protein tyrosine
  phosphatase (SHP-2), which, in turns, binds its adapter molecule Grb-2 and activates
  downstream signaling, resulting in extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2
  activation, (ii) signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 activation
  and (iii) STAT3 activation. The phosphorylation of JAK2 also activates the MAPK
  signaling pathway and promotes SH2B adaptor protein 1 (SH2B1) and insulin receptor
  substrate (IRS) binding, which initiates the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)
  pathway, which leads to phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) activation. During hyperactivation
  of the leptin signaling pathway, two main inhibitors can be transcribed—protein
  tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B, which dephosphorylates JAK2 and suppressor of cytokine
  signaling (SOCS) 3, which blocks tyrosine and JAK2 phosphorylation. Created with
