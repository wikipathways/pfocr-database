caption: FcεRI signaling events in WT, NTAL−/−, and LAT−/− cells. In WT cells expressing
  both NTAL and LAT, aggregation of the receptors by multivalent antigen leads to
  rapid Lyn kinase-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in ITAM motifs of
  FcεRI β and γ subunits, followed by anchor of Syk to FcεRI through interaction of
  Syk SH2 domains with phosphorylated ITAMs. Syk then phosphorylates NTAL and LAT
  to create binding sites for various SH2-containing proteins. Phosphorylated LAT
  allows direct binding of SH2 domains of PLCγ1, Grb2, Gads, and SHIP1. Grb2 and Gads
  serve as binding sites and stabilizers for other molecules including SLP-76, VAV,
  and SOS. Activity of PLCγ1 leads to enhanced production of IP3 and DAG, followed
  by increased Ca2+ influx, degranulation, and production of transcription factors.
  Phosphorylated NTAL also binds Grb2 and some other signaling proteins, except for
  PLCγ1. However, even in the absence of binding to PLCγ1, NTAL can modulate Ca2+signaling,
  degranulation, and cell survival through indirect cross-talk with PI3 activation
  pathway. In activated NTAL−/− cells, an important Syk substrate (NTAL) is missing
  and LAT is therefore more phosphorylated. This leads to enhanced binding and activity
  of PLCγ1 and all subsequent PLCγ-dependent events. However, NTAL-dependent activity
  of Akt is impaired and this could lead to decreased cell survival. In activated
  LAT−/− cells, decreased Ca2+ influx, degranulation, and production of transcription
  factors are due to the absence of PLCγ1 anchored to LAT. The remaining weak Ca2+response,
  degranulation and production of transcription factors is based on NTAL-mediated
  activation events.
