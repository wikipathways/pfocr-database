caption: Bioinformatics Analysis of miR-124-3p and Its Downstream Targeted Genes(A)
  The genetic interaction network of miR-124-3p built by Biovista Vizit. There are
  22 possible targeted genes of miR-124-3p associated with neurodegeneration and amyloid
  deposition. Rela is one of the core genes connected with other genes in the network.
  (B) KEGG analysis for the predicted miR-124-3p targeted genes using Cytoscape software.
  Note that Rela is the only gene that was involved in all the top three enriched
  signaling pathways (neurotrophin signaling pathway, focal adhesion, and cAMP signaling
  pathway) regulated by the 22 neurodegeneration-associated miR-124-3p targeted genes.
