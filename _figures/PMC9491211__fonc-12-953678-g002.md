caption: The effects of bacteria-derived toxins on cancerous cells. (A) Ras/Rap1-specific
  endopeptidase (RRSP) toxin secreted by Vibrio vulnificus blocks the RAS signal transduction
  pathway, leading to the abrogation of key signaling modulators (especially Raf)
  and a reduction in cell proliferation, differentiation, and, ultimately, survival.
  (B) Apoptosis induced by excessive osmotic pressure caused by the action of pore-forming
  toxins such as Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and Aeromonas hydrophila
  aerolysin. (C) The receptor-mediated internalization of diphtheria toxin (DT)-based
  immunotoxin blocks protein synthesis via inducing the ADP-ribosylation of elongation
  factor-2 (EF-2), leading to ADP-ribosyl transferase-mediated apoptosis. (D) Other
  bacterial toxins, such as toxin A (produced by Clostridium difficile), can induce
  mitochondria damage and, subsequently, cell death. (E) The cytotoxic necrotizing
  factor (CNF) is a bacterial single-chain exotoxin produced by Gram-negative bacteria,
  such as Escherichia coli, and promotes oncogenesis through inducing the activation
  and proliferation of host cells via a Rho-GTPase-dependent mechanism.
