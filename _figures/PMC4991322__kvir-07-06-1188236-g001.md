caption: The conserved pathway of sterol synthesis, storage and transformation in
  C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. A. Schematic representation of the common ergosterol
  synthesis process including the enzymes and intermediate products in C. albicans.
  The storage and transformation between steryl esters and fatty acids or sterols
  is uncharacterized in C. albicans and labeled with dotted boxes, based on the homologous
  genes and their roles in S. cerevisiae. B. Accumulated intermediates when ERG3 function
  is lost. C. Bypass pathway when C. albicans is treated with Erg11p inhibitors. The
  resulting aberrant sterol 14-methylergosta-8,24(28)-dien-3β,6α-diol is produced
  by ERG3. Solid arrows, single enzymatic process; dashed arrows, multiple enzymatic
  processes; underlined genes, S. cerevisiae genes and their homologous genes in C.
  albicans are shown in parentheses.
