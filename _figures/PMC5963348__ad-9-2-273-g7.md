caption: A schematic model for SIRT3-induced autophagy and its underlying mechanism
  in SH-SY5Y cells following rotenone treatment. SIRT3 overexpression leads to an
  acceleration of LKB1 activation (phosphorylation) and downstream AMPK activation,
  thus decreasing mTOR phosphorylation and initiating an autophagic response. In a
  rotenone-induced Parkinson cell model, there is enhanced α-synuclein aggregation,
  accelerated oxidative stress and increased mitochondria dysfunction. With SIRT3
  overexpression and induced autophagic levels, these injuries are ameliorated. Blocking
  autophagy using 3-MA abolished the protective effect. Our results suggest that SIRT3
  protects cells from rotenone by generating autophagy. The LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway
  is involved in the generation.
