caption: mTOR Signaling pathway. Activation of P13K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to form phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). Phosphatase
  and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) regulates the function of PIP3.
  PIP3 prompts the activation of downstream processes such AKT, which transmits signals
  to effectors including mTOR complexes to enhance cellular processes. The mTORC1
  is stimulated during cell activation whereby the T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulates
  the activation of P13K. mTORC1 comprises of three mTOR catalytic subunits, namely
  the regulatory associated protein of mTOR (RAPTOR), mammalian lethal with SEC13
  protein 8 (MLST8), as well as the noncore components PRAS40 and DEP domain-containing
  mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR). mTORC2 comprises also of three proteins – the
  namely rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR), MLST8, and the mammalian
  stress-activated protein kinase interacting protein 1 (SIN1). Activation of mTORC2
  occurs through the phosphorylation of AKT at serine-473 while that of mTORC1 when
  activated, phosphorylates the effectors which are major regulators of protein translation
  including translation-regulating factors ribosomal S6 kinase-1 (S6K-1) and eukaryote
  translation initiation factor 4E binding protein-1 (4EBP-1) to enhance protein synthesis.
