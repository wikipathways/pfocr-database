caption: Increased research into the molecular mechanisms of breast cancer brain metastasis
  has identified that, key molecule inhibitors such as PARP inhibitors, cathepsin
  S inhibitors, HER2/ERBB inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors; and pathway inhibitors such
  as VEGF pathway inhibitors, PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway inhibitors and CDK4/6 pathway
  inhibitors, play vital roles and that have become target of study in preclinical
  research or clinical trials.
