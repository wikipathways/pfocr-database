caption: Immune system response with prophylactic cancer vaccine administration. Following
  administration of a cancer vaccine, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from the innate
  immune system such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) recognize the injected
  antigen as foreign via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), and uptake the antigen.
  Subsequently, the APCs transport the antigen, migrating to a lymph node and processing
  and presenting the antigen via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) pathway. Once
  in the lymph node, an immune synapse will form as the APC presents the antigen to
  an immature T cell at the T cell receptor (TCR). T cells will be activated by this
  interaction, with the aid of cytokines and co-stimulatory signals from the APC.
  Upon activation, T cells proliferate via IL-2 production and differentiate into
  effector T cells depending on cytokines and MHC type from the APC. These T cells
  can then contribute to the activation of B cells or travel to distant sites as effector
  or memory T cells. This primary response following vaccination produces memory cells
  so that secondary exposure to cancer-associated antigens results in a rapid and
  robust secondary immune response.
