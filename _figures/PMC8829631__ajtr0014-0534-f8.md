caption: Schematic diagram of the effects of APN on MSCs survival and therapeutic
  efficacy in AMI. Adiponectin (APN) increased the survival rate of transplanted mesenchymal
  stem cells (MSCs) by activating the AMPK pathway. This change augmented the cardioprotective
  effects of MSCs on suppressing the inflammatory response, inhibiting cardiomyocyte
  apoptosis, and enhancing arteriogenesis and angiogenesis in the peri-infarct myocardium.
  These beneficial effects subsequently resulted in markedly improved cardiac function
  and a decreased infarct size after acute myocardial infarction.
