caption: Methylation and phosphorylation are two major post translation modifications
  of PP2A. The conserved sequence TPDYFL in PP2Ac undergoes phosphorylation and methylation,
  respectively. Phosphorylation of Y307 by receptor associated tyrosine kinases effectively
  decreases the PP2A activity by inhibiting the interaction of the catalytic subunit
  with the scaffold subunit. On the other hand, the addition of the methyl group to
  PP2Ac by LCMT1 at L309 by PP2A-methyltransferase (PPMT) will enhance the specific
  binding of the AC dimer to the distinct B regulatory subunit providing the enzymatic
  activity. PP2A activity is indispensable for every cell and takes part in the majority
  of the cellular pathways. Phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 leads to activation
  of Akt and is associated with PP2A activation. PP2A also possesses a vital role
  in the Wnt signaling pathway and phosphorylation of PP2A-B56 directs the activation
  of the Wnt pathway. In addition to these pathways, PP2A activity is indispensable
  in apoptosis. BAD (pro-apoptotic) and Bcl-2 are also regulated by PP2A. Phosphorylation
  of BAD suppresses, and its dephosphorylation by PP2A promotes pro-apoptotic activity.
  In addition, phosphorylation of Bcl-2 activates, and its dephosphorylation by PP2A
  suppresses anti-apoptotic activity. Thus, this diagrammatic representation will
  elucidate the importance of PP2A during cell growth survival and apoptosis.
