caption: 'Metabolic pathway of Jacobaea vulgaris displaying changes in the pathway
  due to growth in inoculated or in 100% sterilized soil. Green font indicates higher
  and red font lower concentrations of compounds in plants grown in 100% sterilized
  soil than in inoculated soil. This pathway only depicts the main pathways; not all
  reactions and intermediates are depicted. The compounds displayed were associated
  to signals as follows: glucose 5.2 ppm, sucrose 6.60 ppm, citrate 2.52 ppm, malate
  4.32 ppm, mannitol 3.84 ppm, inositol 4.04 ppm, malic acid 2.64 ppm, pyrrolizidine
  alkaloid A 6.42 ppm, pyrrolizidine alkaloid B 2.56 ppm, ARG 1.7 ppm, HIS 8.1 ppm,
  GLU 2.4 ppm, THR 1.3 ppm, ALA 1.5 ppm, TYR 3.16 ppm, LEU 0.9 ppm, fumarate 6.73 ppm,
  phenylpropanoid 6.45 ppm. Compounds presented in black could not be identified'
