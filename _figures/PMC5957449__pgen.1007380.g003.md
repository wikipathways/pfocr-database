caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to generate the network overlaid with
  relative gene expression levels of inflammation to tumor transition. Node colors
  indicate the upregulated (red) and downregulated (green) genes relative to the comparison
  of tumor samples over inflamed livers. Items depicted by a dashed circle represent
  several members of the Cyp2c (specifically, Cyp2c29, Cyp2c37, Cyp2c38, Cyp2c39,
  Cyp2c40, Cyp2c44, Cyp2c50, Cyp2c55, Cyp2c67, Cyp2c68, Cyp2c69, Cyp2c70) and Cyp4a
  (Cyp4a10, Cyp4a12a, Cyp4a12b, Cyp4a14, Cyp4a32) families. Network edges (the relationship
  between nodes represented by lines and arrows) represent direct (solid lines) and
  indirect (dashed lines) interactions between molecules as supported by information
  in the Ingenuity knowledge base. Each functional class of molecules is represented
  by a different node shape.
