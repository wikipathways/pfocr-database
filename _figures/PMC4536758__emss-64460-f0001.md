caption: CLL cells and indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (iNHL) cells express B cell
  receptors (BCR) that are activated in the lymphoid tissues, leading to downstream
  signaling. PI3Kδ activation is a critical component of this signaling pathway, promoting
  survival and proliferation of the malignant cells (left). PI3Kδ activation also
  induces secretion of chemokines (CCL3, CCL4) by the malignant B cells, which in
  turn attract accessory cells, such as T cells, to the tissue microenvironment. These
  activation events are turned off by PI3Kδ blockade with idelalisib. In addition,
  idelalisib also interferes with tissue homing and retention mechanism (right hand
  side). Tissue stromal cells, such as monocyte-derived nurselike cells (NLC) and
  lymphoma-associated macrophages (LAM) secrete chemokines (CXCL12, CXCL13) which
  cause homing and tissue retention of CLL and iNHL cells. Blockade of chemokine receptor
  (CXCR4, CXCR5) signaling by idelalisib explains the re-distribution of tissue-resident
  CLL cells into the peripheral blood during idelalisib therapy.
