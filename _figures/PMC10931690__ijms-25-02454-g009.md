caption: Diagram depicting the mechanism of neuroprotective effect of siponimod/BAF312.
  The potential mechanism of neuroprotective effect of siponimod/BAF312 is to reverse
  TNFα-driven neuroinflammation by affecting genes mainly involved in apoptosis, mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation, MAPK/NFκB signaling pathways, and cytokine–cytokine receptor
  interaction. Siponimod/BAF312 decreases neuronal apoptosis through relieving oxidative
  stress in human neuronal cells, as shown in the schematic model
