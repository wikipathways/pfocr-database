caption: Integrated metabolic pathway network analysis in NE-affected jejunal tissues.
  This schematic represents the intricate metabolite-protein networks highlight the
  involvement of metabolites [Arginine, Glutamate, Proline, Butyric Acid, and Citrate
  (in green color)] and proteins (GATM and ALDH18A1 shown in yellow and PC, PCK, CS,
  ACO and IDH shown in turquoise). Glutamate acts as a precursor to arginine, proline,
  and butanoate metabolites. Butanoate is further connected to acetyl Co-A, indicating
  metabolic adaptations in pathophysiology of CP induced NE in broiler chickens
