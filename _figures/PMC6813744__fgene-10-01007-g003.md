caption: Pathways enriched for each chemical. Red hexagons indicate steatogenic chemicals.
  Blue circles indicate pathways enriched for two or more chemicals. Orange circles
  indicate pathways enriched for only one chemical. An edge (shown in grey) was created
  between the chemical and the pathway if the pathway is enriched in any dose/time
  exposures for that particular chemical. Signaling pathways enriched for more than
  two chemicals were marked with red start. Signaling pathways enriched for one or
  two chemicals were marked with green star.
