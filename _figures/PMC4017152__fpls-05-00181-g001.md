caption: Model for the Self-Incompatibility response in Arabidopsis. Upon pollen contact
  with the stigmatic papilla, the papilla must determine if the pollen grain is self
  or non-self. For a self-pollen grain, the SCR/SP11 ligand binds to SRK, and SRK
  will then become phosphorylated. ARC1 interacts with the phosphorylated cytoplasmic
  kinase domain of SRK and become phosphorylated and activated. ARC1 then seeks its
  target for ubiquitination, Exo70A1, which is located at the plasma membrane in preparation
  for exocyst-mediated exocytosis. ARC1, with the help of an E1 activating enzyme
  and E2 conjugating enzyme, ubiquitinates Exo70A1. The nature of this ubiquitination
  is not known, as it could be either mono-ubiqitination resulting in Exo70A1 relocalization,
  or poly ubiquitination leading to degradation of Exo70A1 by the 26S proteosome.
  Either way, the inhibition of Exo70A1 appears to activate an autophagic response
  that leads to degradation of the secretory vesicles. There is also another (unknown)
  factor functioning downstream of SRK in this pathway. How ARC1, this factor, and
  the ubiquitination of Exo70A1 signals for autophagy is not known. Once the secretory
  vesicles have been removed, the self-pollen grain will not receive the resources
  needed for hydration and germination; as a result will be rejected.
