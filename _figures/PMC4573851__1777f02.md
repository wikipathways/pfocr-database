caption: The roles of FANCM family proteins in replication fork repair and crossover
  control. (A) Pathways that cope with replication blockage (denoted by the star),
  including error-prone translesion DNA synthesis and FANCM/Fml1/Mph1-mediated fork
  regression and subsequent recombination, are depicted. Note that Smc5/6 (structural
  maintenance of chromosomes 5/6) down-regulates Mph1's replication fork regression
  (or fork reversal) and DNA branch migration activities to prevent the generation
  of potentially harmful recombination intermediates, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  MHF (ScMHF) helps overcome this effect of Smc5/6. Two scenarios following fork reversal
  are shown. Following DNA synthesis, where one nascent strand uses the other to prime
  DNA synthesis, the fork can be reset, allowing replication resumption. Alternatively,
  the dsDNA ends can be resected to generate a substrate for invading the template
  strands that share sequence homology, generating a dHJ that requires resolution
  to allow replication resumption. Note that fork reversal can also lead to other
  outcomes that are not depicted here. (B) Model showing how FANCM family proteins
  promote DNA double-strand break repair via the synthesis-dependent strand annealing
  (SDSA) pathway that generates noncrossover products only. Repair via the double-strand
  break repair pathway (DSBR) leads to the formation of a dHJ intermediate that is
  resolved nucleolytically into crossover or noncrossover products. Alternatively,
  the dHJ can be dissolved by a helicase/topoisomerase complex composed of BTR or
  the yeast counterpart Sgs1/Top3/Rmi1 (STR), to yield noncrossover products. The
  dotted line denotes newly synthesized DNA.
