caption: 'Crosstalk of cell cycle and p53 pathway. p53 activity is under the direct
  control of MDM2. When the MDM2-p53 interaction is interrupted via stress signals
  or specific MDM2 inhibitors, p53 accumulates and activates its direct transcriptional
  targets, resulting in protein production: p21 involved in cell cycle arrest; PUMA,
  NOXA, BAX, BAK involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway; DR4 and FAS involved
  in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway; MDM2, WIP1 involved in p53 feedback regulation
  and many others participating in DNA repair, cell metabolism, autophagy, and translational
  control. Cell cycle progression is controlled by p53 activity mainly via p21 protein,
  which associates with and inactivates CDK/cyclin complexes and blocks cell cycle
  progression. CDK4/6 with cyclin D/E controls the activity of RB and E2F1. When RB
  is hyperphosphorylated, it is released from binding to E2F1, and E2F1 then activates
  its transcriptional program, leading to cell cycle progression'
