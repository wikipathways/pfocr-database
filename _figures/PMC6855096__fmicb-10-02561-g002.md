caption: '(A) Map of the lab cluster comprising genes for labrenzin production. (B)
  Scheme predicting the pederin/onnamide modular biosynthesis in a free-living Alfaproteobacterium
  Labrenzia sp. PHM005. Specific domains have been identified and analyzed using antiSMASH.
  Domains (shown in circles) that are part of the same module are represented in the
  same color, less the putative non-functional domains in white. Module boundaries
  are defined as described by . GNAT, GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase domain; ACP,
  acyl carrier protein domain; KS, ketosynthase domain; KS0, non-elongating ketosynthase
  domain; KR, ketoreductase domain; MT, methyltransferase domain; ECH, enoyl- CoA
  hydratase/isomerase domain; A, adenylation domain; AT, trans-acyltransferase; C,
  condensation domain; DH, dehydratase domain; PS, pyran synthase; PCP, peptidyl carrier
  protein domain; TE, thioesterase domain; OR, oxidoreductase; MT, methyltransferase.
  Putative trans-AT docking site associated with its respective KS is indicated by
  arrows. Two pathways are indicated: the synthesis of the labrenzin and the onnamide
  A questioned to be the complete molecule of the proposed pathway. Putative functional
  groups are marked inside brackets and putative modifications by tailoring enzymes
  are colored in pink.'
