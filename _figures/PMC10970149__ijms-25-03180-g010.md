caption: 'A possible molecular model of KN1 regulating LA with exogenous phytohormones.
  (A) Molecular model of WT KN1 regulating LA under exogenous ABA treatment. (B) Molecular
  model of WT KN1 regulating LA under exogenous IAA treatment. (C) Molecular model
  of mutant kn1 regulating LA under exogenous ABA treatment. (D) Molecular model of
  mutant kn1 regulating LA under exogenous IAA treatment. Note: Black lines ending
  with arrows and vertical lines represent promoting and inhibiting regulation, respectively.
  Solid and dashed lines represent the determined and undetermined interactions in
  the signaling pathway, respectively. Red and blue indicate differentially expressed
  genes that are upregulated and downregulated, respectively'
