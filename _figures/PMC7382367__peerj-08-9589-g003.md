caption: The red arrows in the figure represent the promoting effect. There are not
  many researches on METTL3 in prostate cancer compared with kidney cancer and bladder
  cancer. It is certain that it plays a role in oncogenesis by affecting downstream
  pathway SHH-GLI1, ITGB1, and LEF1-Wnt/β-catenin. At present, there is no research
  on the pathway of METTL14 in prostate cancer.
