caption: 'The comprehensive kinetic model illustrates dual lipidation interplay within
  the TME signaling pathways. A detailed representation of dual lipidation dynamics
  in T-cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction, mitochondrial antiviral signaling
  and Ras-dependent proliferative signaling within the TME. Initially, the proto-oncogene
  tyrosine-protein kinase Lck undergoes N-myristoylation. Subsequently, Lck undergoes
  reversible S-palmitoylation at cysteine residues, primarily catalyzed by ZDHHC within
  the Golgi apparatus. Palmitoylation significantly enhances Lck membrane affinity,
  promoting localization into lipid raft microdomains. Upon antigen presentation by
  antigen-presenting cells (APCs), dual lipidation anchors Lck at the plasma membrane,
  where it phosphorylates ITAM motifs on CD3 chains, initiating the T-cell activation
  cascade. Downstream signaling involves adaptor proteins (LAT, SLP- 76) whose S-palmitoylation
  stabilizes signaling assemblies within lipid rafts, enhancing the activity of PLCγ1,
  triggering secondary messenger production and signal amplification. A parallel dual
  lipidation mechanism governs small GTPases, notably HRAS and NRAS, involving initial
  irreversible S-prenylation catalyzed by FTase. This prenylation event primes Ras
  proteins for subsequent reversible S-palmitoylation via ZDHHC enzymes at the Golgi
  apparatus, enhancing their membrane microdomains: affinity and facilitating efficient
  trafficking to the lipid raft of plasma membrane (PM). At the PM, palmitoylated
  Ras isoforms upload GTP and tranlocated to the disordered (non-raft) regions of
  the PM then activate downstream effectors (RAF/MEK/ERK pathway), which promote oncogenic
  signaling cascades critical for proliferation and survival in the TME. S-palmitoylation
  dynamically modulates Ras localization between distinct cellular compartments. Thioesterase
  enzymes (APT1/2) reversibly remove the palmitoyl groups, enabling Ras isoforms to
  cycle between the PM and Golgi. This continuous palmitoylation–depalmitoylation
  cycling tightly regulates Ras signaling activity and membrane occupancy. The small
  GTPase Rac1 similarly undergoes dual lipidation cycles. Following viral infection,
  Rac1 translocates into cholesterol-enriched microdomains within mitochondria-associated
  membranes (MAMs), where it inhibits the interaction between MAVS and the E3 ligase
  Trim31. This prevents Trim31-mediated ubiquitination of MAVS, thereby blocking MAVS
  aggregation and downstream antiviral activation. ABHD: α/β-Hydrolase domain-containing
