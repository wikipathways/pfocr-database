caption: Pathways initiating transcription from pIV of the CIITA gene. Transcription
  from pIV is initiated in many nonhematopoietic cells, including cTECs, in response
  to IFN-γ and involves upregulation of the transcription factors STAT-1 and IRF-1.
  These factors in combination with USF-1 form a complex capable of initiating transcription.
  A second pathway drives transcription from pIV in cTECs and is responsible for the
  constitutive expression of MHC class II on these cells in vivo. The stimuli and
  signal transduction pathway involved in this second pathway are at present unknown,
  and here we suggest that this stimulus may be provided by either cell–cell contact
  between cTECs or the release of a short acting soluble factor from cTECs.
