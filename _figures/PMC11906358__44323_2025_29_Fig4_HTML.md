caption: The left part of the model depicts the phase delay process involving T-type
  voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), and the right part illustrates a hypothetical
  phase advance process involving L-type VGCCs. The delay model involves activating
  glutamate signalling via protein kinase A (PKA), Cav 3.1, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase (CaMK), and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which binds
  to CRE promoter elements of target genes such as Per1, Dec1, Sik1, and Gem. This
  transcriptional activation is supported by co-factors such as CREB-regulated transcription
  coactivator 1 (CRTC1), CREB-binding protein (CBP), and PER2. PER2 and PKA are regulated
  by Cdk5, whose activity depends on interaction with p35/25, which is influenced
  by light and opioids. The phase advance mechanism is unclear (hatched arrows) and
  may involve the MEK/ERK signalling pathway, which may also influence phase delays
  and FOS/JUN transcriptional activation
