caption: Scheme of the signaling pathway underlying astrocytic Ca2+ signal-dependent
  neuroprotection on brain injury. Injury evokes Ca2+ signals in astrocytes via IP3R2
  (1, 2), which lead to down-regulation of Pum2 (3). This in turn induces N-cadherin
  up-regulation (4) by relieving Pum2-mediated repression of N-cadherin translation.
  Up-regulated N-cadherin plays an essential role in reactive astrogliosis and neuroprotection
  (5).
