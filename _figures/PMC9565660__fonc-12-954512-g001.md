caption: 'NAD Biosynthesis is perturbed in HCC. (A) Diagrammatic representation of
  the liver NADnet. Metabolites are represented as yellow nodes; enzymes are in cyan
  colour. NAD+ can be synthesised by the three different routes - (A) Route I: de
  novo biosynthesis pathway starting with the precursor tryptophan (B) Route II: Preiss−Handler
  pathway from nicotinic acid and (C) Route III: NAD salvage pathway utilising nicotinamide
  and nicotinamide riboside for NAD+ biosynthesis. Note: NAD represents total NAD
  in the system (both oxidised and reduced form). (B) Validation of the liver NADnet.
  The above panel (Measured) is adopted from the report of Mori et al. and represents
  the metabolic reconstruction of NAD biosynthesis in mouse liver tissue and reflects
  the main route of NAD generation is via NMN. The below panel (Calculated) is the
  reconstruction of NAD biosynthesis from steady-state concentrations and fluxes obtained
  from model simulation. r is the Spearman correlation between measured and calculated
  fluxes. r* is the Spearman correlation between measured and calculated metabolite
  concentrations. (C) Time course simulation of NAD levels for the base model. The
  blue curve shows the changes in NAD concentration (µM) (log10 scale) with respect
  to time(s) (log10 scale).'
