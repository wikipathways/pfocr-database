caption: Model of the signaling pathway stimulated by sNAGs, that results in an integrin-dependent
  increase in fatty acid oxidation. sNAGs stimulate outside-in signaling of integrins
  resulting in an activation of Akt1 via the association of ILK1. Akt1 activation
  leads to an increase in the expression of PGC-1α which controls the expression of
  PDK4. PDK4 functions to inhibit the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, thus promoting
  the switch from glucose to fatty acid metabolism.
