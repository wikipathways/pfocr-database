caption: FXI-ASO (ISIS 416858) is a factor XI (FXI)–targeted second-generation antisense
  oligonucleotide. Tissue damage after surgery exposes tissue factor and results in
  the release of DNA, RNA, and inorganic polyphosphate from damaged cells and from
  activated platelets and neutrophils. Tissue factor binds factor VIIa and initiates
  the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, whereas DNA, RNA, and polyphosphate activate
  factor XII and initiate the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Factor XI–targeted
  antisense oligonucleotide attenuates the intrinsic pathway by binding to factor
  XI messenger RNA (mRNA) in the liver, which results in ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1)–mediated
  degradation of FXI messenger RNA, thereby preventing protein synthesis and reducing
  circulating FXI levels.
