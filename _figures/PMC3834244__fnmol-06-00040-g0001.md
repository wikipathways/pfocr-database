caption: 'MiRNA biogenesis and function. (A) The canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway
  is Drosha- and Dicer-dependent. It begins with RNA Pol II-mediated transcription
  of genomic loci containing miRNA genes. The primary transcript is referred to as
  pri-miRNA and like other RNA Pol II transcripts contains a 5′ 7-methylgunaosine
  cap and 3′ poly-A tail. The pri-miRNA is processed in the nucleus by Drosha and
  DGCR8 to form pre-miRNA. The pre-miRNA is then exported into the cytoplasm by Exportin-5
  where it is further processed by the RNase III enzyme, Dicer. Interaction with Dicer
  leads to hairpin cleavage and degradation of the anti-sense strand of the miRNA
  duplex, while the mature guide strand is complexed with members of the Argonaute
  family of proteins to form a functional RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). (B)
  In a Drosha-dependent and Dicer-independent non-canonical pathway of miRNA biogenesis,
  the cytoplasmic pri-miRNA undergoes processing by AGO2, although the precise mechanism
  of miRNA maturation via this pathway remains unclear. (C) Another non-canonical
  pathway involving Drosha-independent/Dicer-dependent biogenesis generates mirtrons,
  transcribed from intronic sequences and obtained by splicing and lariat-debranching.
  Mature miRNA can act via three primary methods: (1) destabilization and cleavage
  of target mRNA, (2) translational repression, and (3) mRNA stabilization.'
