caption: FLNA bound R-Ras can be activated through various receptor engagements (including
  TGFβ as depicted) leading to MAPK pathway activation of Erk1/2. pErk1/2 phosphorylates
  the pSmad2/3 linker region to inhibit nuclear import whereas phosphorylation of
  the Smad2/3 C-terminus by TGFβ-receptors result in nuclear import. Our data support
  a process by which pSmad2/3 nuclear import and beta1 integrin expression (possibly
  through R-Ras activities) are regulated through a filamin-A intermediate to balance
  the effects of ECM production and ECM compaction/remodeling.
