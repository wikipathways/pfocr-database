caption: Intracellular signalling during inflammation-induced osteoclastogenesis.
  RANKL (receptor activator of NF-kB ligand) binds to its receptor RANK and induces
  the key regulator of osteoclast differentiation NFATc1 (Nuclear factor of activated
  T cells, cytoplasmic 1) through two different signalling pathways. On the one hand,
  RANK recruits TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) and activates NF-κB, JNK,
  p38, c-fos and AP-1. On the other hand, NFATc1 is activated by calcineurin that
  is in turn activated by elevated calcium in the cytoplasm. Phospholipase C (PLC)γ
  mediates the release of calcium in the cytoplasm; PLCγ is activated by RANK through
  Btk/Tec and by OSCAR (osteoclast-associated receptor) and TREM-2 (triggering receptor
  expressed by myeloid cells 2) through the Fc receptor gamma chain (FcRγ), DAP12
  (DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa) and Syk signalling. TNF binds to its receptor
  TNFR1, which recruits TRADD (TNFR-associated DD protein) and RIP-1 (Receptor interacting
  protein-1). TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)2, TRAF5 and TRAF6 mediate further
  signalling through NF-κB, JNK and p38. The IL-1 receptor IL-1R1 binds MYD88 (myeloid
  differentiation primary response gene 88) and RAK4, which activates TRAF6 through
  phosphorylation of IL-1 receptor-activating protein kinase (IRAK)2 and IRAK1. After
  binding IL-6, the IL-6 receptor recruits two gp130 molecules and activates the signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway and the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (JNK, p38, ERK) through gp130. MMP, matrix metalloproteinase.
