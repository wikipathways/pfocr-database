caption: Overlap between networks linked to ovarian cancer and networks targeted by
  epigallocatechin‐3‐gallate (EGCG). Proteins linked to ovarian cancer are represented
  as black lines; EGCG‐targeted proteins, as purple lines. (a) Shared networks involved
  in cell death and survival, cellular growth and proliferation, cellular development,
  cell morphology, nervous system development and function, organ morphology. (b)
  Shared networks involved in cellular development, cellular growth and proliferation,
  protein synthesis, cell cycle, cancer, endocrine system disorders. Data were analyzed
  through the use of QIAGEN's Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA®, QIAGEN Redwood City,
  www.qiagen.com/ingenuity).
