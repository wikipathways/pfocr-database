caption: Schematic representation of the possible dysfunction of the angiotensin metabolites
  pathway in COVID-19 patients. (A) Modelization of the concentration of angiotensin
  metabolites in plasma of healthy volunteers, prolonged viral shedders, and short
  viral shedders. For each group, the individual circles indicate the metabolite median
  concentrations, shown in pg/mL. The arrows between the circles mark the catalyzing
  reactions mediated by the indicated enzymes. (B) Schematic diagram of the renin-angiotensin
  system (RAS) cascade in a normal physiological state and in COVID-19 patients. Renin
  cleaves Angiotensinogen to Ang I which is further processed to the vasoconstrictor
  Ang II peptide by ACE. The upper left panel illustrates the Ang II pathway of Ang-(1-7)
  biosynthesis where ACE2 converts Ang II to Ang-(1-7) and also Ang I to Ang-(1-9)
  next converted in Ang-(1-7) by ACE peptidase, leading to protective signal through
  MAS-receptor. This is the physiological state. The upper-right panel illustrates
  the possible dysfunction of signals when SARS-CoV-2 is attached to its ACE2 receptor.
  Under this condition Ang-(1-7) synthesis through ACE2 is likely decreased, Ang II
  accumulates and, increased Ang II binding to AT1R - leads to proinflammatory signals
  that ultimately will trigger both tissues damage (in particular lungs and heart)
  and hypertension. The lower - panel illustrates that during COVID-19, the ACE2 mRNA
  expression is reduced leading to low surface expression of ACE2 (and plasma sACE2),
  Ang II is in excess in plasma, yet Ang-(1-7) remains synthesized through the NEP/TOP
  alternative pathway where neprilysin (NEP) and thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) convert
  Ang I to Ang-(1-7).
