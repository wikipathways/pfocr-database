caption: 'General autophagy process and targets for potential drugs inducing autophagy.
  Autophagy can be induced by stress, energy deficiency, increased intracellular Ca2+,
  etc., through inhibition of the mTOR complex and subsequent activation of the ULK
  complex. The class III PI3K complex can be phosphorylated by ULK, subsequently catalyzing
  PI into PI3P and initiating autophagy. Atg9 vesicles are released from the Golgi
  complex and recruit the PI3K complex to downstream autophagy-related proteins. The
  Atg12-Atg5-Atg16L complex and LC3 are ubiquitin ligases that are indispensable for
  membrane elongation and closure. LC3 can be cleaved by Atg4, and the generated LC3-I
  binds with PE, which is mediated by the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16L complex, localized on
  the membranes of autophagosomes. The dynein-dynactin complex mediates the transportation
  of organelles along the microtubule. Mature vesicles labeled by LC3 are distributed
  along microtubules and LC3 colocalizes with dynein-dynactin complex. mSOD1 alters
  the cellular localization of dynein and inhibits the dynein-dynactin complex, impeding
  the transportation of autophagosomes. TFEB is regulated by mTORC1 to mediate the
  expression of autophagy and lysosome-related protein (atg9B and LAMP1), which in
  turn affects the formation of autolysosome. mSOD1 also interferes with the expression
  of TFEB. Rab7 regulates the formation and maturation of autolysosome, and interacts
  with C9ORF72. Lithium and n-butylidenephthalide enhance autophagy by inhibiting
  PI3K and GSK-3β, Rapamycin and Torkinib induce autophagy by inhibiting mTORC1, while
  carbamazepine, verapamil and trehalose initiate autophagy by activating AMPK. Also,
  trehalose regulates the phosphorylation and translocation of TFEB. It has been reported
  that ropinirole induces autophagy through a Beclin-1-dependent pathway. HDAC6 can
  control the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. mTORC1: mechanistic target of
