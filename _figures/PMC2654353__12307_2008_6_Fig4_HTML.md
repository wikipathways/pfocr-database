caption: From oxygen to HIF and from HIF to oxygen. a A drop in the partial pressure
  of oxygen results in the inactivation of PHDs and FIH. Consequently the HIF pathway
  is activated, due respectively to inhibition of proteasomal degradation and a release
  of the C-TAD activity. b HIF in turn impacts on oxygen homeostasis by a double mechanism
  touching metabolism (green) and oxygen distribution/angiogenesis (red). HIF increases
  the glycolytic flux and represses the entrance of pyruvate into the Krebs cycle.
  The consequence is a decrease in oxygen consumption by mitochondrial respiration.
  In parallel HIF promotes angiogenesis via stimulation of vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF), interleukin-A (IL-8) and angiopoitin-2 (Ang-2) leading to endothelial
  cell stimulation and blood vessel destabilization. In combination, HIF simultaneously
  increases tissue perfusion and decreases local oxygen consumption, thus promoting
  oxygen diffusion through hypoxic areas
