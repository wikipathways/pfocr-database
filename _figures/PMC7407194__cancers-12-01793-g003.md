caption: Schematic representation of main pathways regulating the DDR-mediated autophagic
  response. ATM is activated in response to DNA damage by the MRN complex and initiates
  a pathway that results in activation of AMPK and its target TSC2 (TSC complex subunit
  2), which removes the inhibitory effect of MTORC1 on autophagy, promoting ULK1-dependent
  autophagosome formation. ATM directly phosphorylates and stabilizes TP53, which
  activates the expression of several regulators of the autophagic pathway including
  SESNs (Sestrin family genes), DAPK (death-associated protein kinase 1) and PTEN
  (phosphatase and tensin homolog). ATM contributes to the activation of AATF (apoptosis
  antagonizing transcription factor) and leads to increased transcription of two mTOR
  inhibitors, DDIT4 (DNA damage inducible transcript 4) and DEPTOR (DEP domain containing
  MTOR interacting protein). DNA damage response activates MAPK8 (mitogen-activated
  protein kinase 8) and NFκB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells) pathways, that induce expression of several autophagy related genes, including
  BECN1. PARP1 activation in response to DNA damage causes reduction in NAD+ (nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide) and ATP (adenosine triphosphate) pool depletion; elevated
  AMP (adenosine monophosphate) levels are sensed by AMPK, leading to its activation
  and induction of autophagy. Black arrows (↑) and perpendicular lines (⊥) indicate
  activation and repression, respectively. Blue arrows indicate transcriptional regulation.
