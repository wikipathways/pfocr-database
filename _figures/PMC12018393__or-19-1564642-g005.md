caption: Mechanism of action of SERMs. The selective estrogen receptor modulators
  (SERMs), tamoxifen, toremifene, and raloxifene bind to the ER like 17β-Estradiol
  (E2) to induce conformational change. Heat shock proteins (HSP) chaperones, such
  as HSP90 are released as part of ER activation and nuclear translocation from the
  ER hinge domain. This results in the dimerization of ER and translocation to the
  nucleus, preferentially activating the activation factor 1 (AF1) domain while suppressing
  the activation factor 2 (AF2)/ligand-binding domain (LDB). Secondly, SERM-bound
  ER will bind to the Estrogen Response Element (ERE) on promotors of target genes,
  thus resulting in transcription attenuation of E2-responsive genes due to the inactivation
  of the ligand-dependent AF2 domain and reduced ER co-activator binding. Additionally,
  SERMs can influence transcription factor pathways involving proteins such as STAT
  and AP-1 pathways via meditation through altered ER-cofactor interactions (22, 35,
  104). Figure generated using (106)
