caption: Bidirectional crosstalk between Hofbauer cells and leptin-expressing trophoblasts
  induces IL-6 levels in HBCs in preeclamptic placenta. Preeclamptic (PE) placentas
  display increased leptin expression generated primarily from syncytiotrophoblasts,
  extravillous trophoblasts, as well as decidual stromal cells, and leptin receptor
  (LEPR) levels in Hofbauer cells (HBCs). Secreted leptin (blue circle) binding to
  LEPR activates ERK1/2 MAPK, p65 NF-κB, and STAT 3/5 signaling pathways to induce
  IL-6 (brown circle) expression in HBCs, which then may further promote leptin secretion
  in PE placentas, which causes a vicious cycle of leptin-triggered inflammation.
  Upon induction by excess leptin, HBCs may serve as one of the primary sources of
  IL-6 production in PE women
