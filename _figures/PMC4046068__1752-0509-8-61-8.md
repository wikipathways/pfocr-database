caption: Topology of the signaling and metabolic pathway of eicosanoid production
  in human. The known pathway topology was simplified by Gupta et al. [] based on
  the availability of metabolite concentration data in their experiments. The rectangles
  show the metabolites and the solid arrows indicate the metabolic transformations
  involved. The ellipses with dashed borders show the enzymes catalyzing the metabolic
  transformations between two metabolites that are neighboring it in the graph. The
  dashed lines denote the effect of enzymes and molecules on the activity of enzymes.
