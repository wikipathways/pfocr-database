caption: Enzymes analyzed in the present study are in bold face (DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose
  5-phosphate synthase; DXR, deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase; HDS, hydroxymethylbutenyl
  diphosphate synthase). GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DXP, deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate;
  MEP, methylerythritol 4-phosphate; MEcPP, methylerythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate;
  HMBPP, hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate. ABA, abscisic
  acid. The step branching to thiamine from DXP is indicated. Furthermore, inhibition
  of DXS and DXR by 5-ketoclomazone (formed in planta from clomazone) and fosmidomycin,
  respectively, is highlighted. Dashed arrows indicate multiple steps.
