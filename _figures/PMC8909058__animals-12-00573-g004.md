caption: Aquaporins (AQPs) and sperm function after ejaculation. (1) After entering
  the female tract, sperm encounter a hypoosmotic medium, which causes water influx
  and thus (2) cell swelling. (3a) The increase of cell volume causes membrane destabilization
  (which affects the sperm plasma membrane, but also alters mitochondrial and acrosomal
  membranes). (4a) As a consequence, mechanosensory ion channels are open and outflowing
  ion currents activate regulatory volume decrease (RVD) events, such as (4a) water
  outflow. (5a) Cell volume is then restituted, which allows (6a) normal sperm motility.
  (3b) In the female reproductive tract, membrane destabilization occurs in conjunction
  with cholesterol depletion. The resulting membrane reorganization elicits the entrance
  of calcium and bicarbonate through different ion channels, which activates capacitation
  signaling pathways (4b) that involve the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). (5b)
  Downstream events prepare the spermatozoon for the acrosome reaction (AR) and (6b)
  drive hyperactivated motility. (7) In this context, mitochondrial activity is elevated
  and reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as H2O2, are produced. This molecule at
  low concentrations is essential to elicit capacitation, but at high concentrations
  it acts as an inhibitor of this process. (8) Aquaporins (AQPs) play an essential
  role, allowing the outflow of the excess amounts of H2O2 towards the extracellular
  medium. (9) Another downstream event of the capacitation signaling pathway consists
  of the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, which triggers the opening of
  calcium-activated K+ channels that causes, in turn, plasma membrane hyperpolarization
  (10); membrane hyperpolarization subsequently opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.
  This increase in intracellular Ca2+ is crucial for acrosome reaction [,] (11) Glycerol
  transport through GLPs can be used by metabolic pathways. The sperm regions where
  AQPs have been identified in different mammalian species are highlighted in the
  diagram. Boxes indicate the species in which each AQP has been identified (C, cattle;
  P, pig; H, human; M, mouse; R, rat).
