caption: The biogenesis and function of Wnt signaling pathway. a Canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway. In the absence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin cannot accumulate in the cytoplasm
  as it is degraded by a multimeric protein complex consisting of APC, Axia, CK1 and
  GSK3). Receptor occupancy inhibits the kinase activity of the “destruction complex”,
  involving the actions of the Axia-binding molecule Dvl. Consequently, due to stabilization
  of β-catenin by disrupted Axia-mediated phosphorylation, β-catenin accumulates and
  travels to the nucleus where it engages the ICF/LE complex to mediate transactivation
  of target genes. b The non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway is initiated by Wnt binding
  to Fzd, then Dvl is recruited, followed by Rac1, JNK and NFAT activation and cytoskeletal
  rearrangement, and then NFAT is translocated to the nucleus to activate the expression
  of Wnt target genes
