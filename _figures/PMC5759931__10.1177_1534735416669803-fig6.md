caption: 'Proposed working model by which boehmenan exerted anti-proliferative activities
  in A431 cells. Boehmenan executed its anti-proliferative activities in 2 ways: by
  inhibiting STAT3 and p70S6 signaling pathways that ultimately suppressed EGF-mediated
  cell growth; and by disrupting mitochondrial function leading to apoptosis that
  indirectly repressed the proliferation of A431 cells.'
