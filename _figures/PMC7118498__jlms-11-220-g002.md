caption: 'TGF-β 1 acts as a double-edged sword. It could terminate the inflammatory
  response and interfere with wound healing, cell differentiation, and cell proliferation,
  and on the other hand, it may prevent apoptosis in myofibroblasts. TGF-β 1 increases
  the number of fibroblasts, converts them to myofibroblasts, and increases the extracellular
  matrix. Blocking the TGF-β 1 signaling pathway is an interesting and useful approach
  for the treatment of renal fibrosis. When the TGF-β1 ligand binds to its receptor,
  it is activated inside the cell by the transcription factor Smad, through which
  the p15 gene expression is upregulated, thereby inhibiting CDK4 which results in
  the arresting cell-cycle at the G1 stage. TGF-β1, on the other hand, acts through
  the Smad and non-Smad pathway. Upon the activation of the Smad pathway, transcription
  factor Smad2/3 is phosphorylated, which makes complexes with Smad4 and they induce
  snail gene expression and collagen production and also induces fibrosis. The non-Smad
  or TAK1 pathway contains PI3K/AKT, Pho-like GTPase, MAPKsMMK3-P38, and MMK4-JNK.
  TAK1 or TGF-β1 activated kinase1 belongs to the MAPK family, a serine-threonine
  kinase that is activated by TGF-β1 ( and ). The combination of map kinase with TGF-β
  1 signaling pathways induce epithelial cells to undergo changes and become myofibroblasts
  and it is involved in normal kidney physiology and different types of kidney disease.
  The kinase is divided into two groups: the first group contains ERK1, 2, 5, p38
  kinase alpha, beta, delta, JNK1, 2 and the second group contains ERKs 3, 4, 7, 8.
  Map kinases are involved in regulation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis,
  inflammation, and fibrosis. MAP kinases are expressed in all cell types. In fact,
  the low-level activity of the map kinase is observed in normal human and rodent
  kidneys. Angiotensin II, IL1, and hypoglycemia may increase the expression of the
  TGF-β1 transcription gene in cases of renal injury.'
