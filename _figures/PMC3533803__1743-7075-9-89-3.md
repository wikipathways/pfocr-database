caption: Metabolic fate of dietary fructose carbons. The data are obtained within
  study periods less than or equal to 6 hours. After 50–150 gm fructose ingestion,
  the peak of fructose concentration in plasma would be between 3–11 mg/dL. The percent
  data above arrow lines or under box are the estimated amounts of ingested fructose
  doses via the pathway, and the question mark represents that the data remain to
  be further confirmed. The dash-line represents presumably minor pathways.
