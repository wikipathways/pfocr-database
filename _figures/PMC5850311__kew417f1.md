caption: 'Biologic therapies and their targets in the immune systemShown are some
  of the common cytokines, pathways and functions of the immune system (in blue) known
  to be dysregulated in SLE and targeted by biologic therapies (in red). Plasmacytoid
  dendritic cells release type I IFNs, such as IFNα, in response to Toll-like receptor
  (TLR)9 stimulation induced by immune complexes. In SLE, immune complexes may be
  formed by autoantibodies, such as anti-DNA antibodies complexed to self-DNA. IFN-primed
  neutrophils release DNA in the form of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs; [])
  or oxidized mitochondrial DNA after activation by anti-Sm or anti-RNP autoantibodies,
  which trigger the Fcγ receptor, TLR7 and reactive oxygen species pathways []. Studies
  suggest that SLE disease activity is associated with type I IFN activity, which
  is elevated in the periphery of most SLE patients. Sifalimumab, a human anti-IFNα
  mAb, and rontalizumab, a humanized IgG1 anti-IFNα mAb, have been developed to target
  this pathway. BAFF (CD257, BLyS, TNFSF13B) is a key B cell maturation and survival
  factor that is produced predominantly by myeloid lineage cells. BAFF has been assessed
  as a therapeutic target, diagnostic marker and prognostic indicator for SLE. Therapeutic
  agents include a unique peptibody, blisibimod, which has four domains that bind
  to BAFF fused to a human IgG1 Fc domain, and belimumab, a humanized IgG1 mAb, which
  has achieved US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of SLE.
  Both agents block BAFF from binding to its receptors. Other B cell-targeted therapies
  are directed at CD19, CD20 and CD22 cell surface proteins. Rituximab is a humanized
  anti-CD20 mAb used for B cell depletion therapy and might be most effective in combination
  with anti-CD257 (BAFF) therapies. MEDI-551 is a humanized IgG1 mAb to CD19. MEDI-551
  is predicted to be a more effective B cell depletion therapy than rituximab because
  CD19 is expressed by plasmablasts and long-lived plasma cells, unlike CD20, and
  might spare B regulatory cells. Epratuzumab, a humanized IgG1 mAb, enhances the
  inhibitory function of CD22 on B cells. Epratuzumab, acting through CD22 (Siglec-2),
  reduced B cell activity as determined by a number of parameters, including decreased
  expression of cell surface proteins, such as adhesion molecules, reduced cytokine
  production (e.g. IL-6 and TNF) and diminished migration and cell growth. Abatacept
  is composed of a human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) protein
  joined to a human IgG1 Fc domain. Abatacept out-competes the CD28 receptor for binding
  to CD80 and CD86 ligands expressed by antigen-presenting myeloid cells, including
  B cells. CD28 is a key costimulatory molecule that delivers the ‘second signal’
  required for antigen-induced T cell activation. Abatacept treatment can result in
  diminished T cell responses and T-dependent B cell antibody production. CD154 (CD40
  ligand) is expressed on activated T cells and binds to the CD40 receptor on antigen-presenting
  cells. The CD154–CD40 interaction is important for T cell responses and T-dependent
  B cell responses. Thus, treatment with anti-CD154 can result in diminished T cell
  and humoral responses in an antigen-specific manner. IL-6 can be produced by a variety
  of cells and promotes inflammation and immune responses. Sirukumab, a human anti-IL-6
  mAb, binds with high specificity and affinity to IL-6. Sirukumab prevents IL-6 from
  binding to the soluble and transmembrane forms of the IL-6 receptor, thus inhibiting
  IL-6-driven inflammation and immune responses. Tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6
  receptor mAb, likewise dampens IL-6-dependent responses, and it has been approved
  for the treatment of RA. Eculizumab is an anti-C5 mAb under study for SLE. Eculizumab
  may be beneficial for lupus nephritis in cases resistant to other therapies with
  evidence of C5 activation. This figure was adapted from Petri, M: Treat to Target(s)—the
