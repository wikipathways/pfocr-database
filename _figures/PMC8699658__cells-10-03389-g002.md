caption: Schematic representation of parkin functional depletion grades. (A) Biallelic
  PARK2 and PARK6 mutations cause either complete lack of their respective proteins
  (parkin or PINK1) or their enzymatic activity, eventually causing early onset Parkinson’s
  disease. (B) Single heterozygous PARK2 and PARK6 mutations with partial lack of
  functional parkin or PINK1 are rarely found in symptomatic patients with PD and
  have mainly subclinical effects. (C) TDP-43 loss-of-function has been consistently
  observed to cause parkin downregulation, whilst the contribution of TDP-43 gain-of-function
  to parkin/PINK1 pathway deregulation requires more research (discussed in ; see
  also Table 1).
