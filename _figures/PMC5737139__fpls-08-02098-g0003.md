caption: Effect of glycine and nitrate supply on the composition and concentrations
  of polyphenols in lettuce leaf extracts. Relative abundance of metabolites is indicated
  from red (high) to green (low). The dotted lines in the metabolic pathway represent
  possible relationships that have not yet been proven experimentally and solid lines
  indicate pathways in the KEGG or PlantCyc databases.
