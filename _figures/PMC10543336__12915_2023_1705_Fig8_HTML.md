caption: The model of carbon source competition between seed coat and embryo in developing
  seed of B. napus. During seed development, a part of the carbon source is allocated
  to the seed coat, and phenylalanine is metabolized into 4-coumarate-CoA to provide
  one of the substrates (another is malonyl-CoA) for the synthesis of flavonoid compounds
  and lignin monomers. At the later stage of seed development, oxidized procyanidins
  and anthocyanins act as important fillers in the endodermis of the seed coat, determining
  the seed coat color and thickness. Another part of the carbon source is converted
  to pyruvate by glycolysis to produce acetyl-CoA, which provides the direct substrate
  malonyl-CoA for the synthesis of FAs and further transformed into stored oil bodies
  after the synthesis of triacylglycerol. These two processes compete for initial
  sugar allocation and malonyl-CoA allocation, while the phenylpropane metabolic pathway
  and FA synthesis pathway, as two important processes determining seed coat development
  and oil accumulation, are controlled by a strict and complex regulatory mechanism
  operated by a series of transcription factors
