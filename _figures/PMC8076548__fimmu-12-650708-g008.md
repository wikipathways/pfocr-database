caption: Putative mechanism underlying the effect of baricitinib on experimental autoimmune
  encephalomyelitis (EAE). Phosphorylation of receptor chains by JAKs is induced by
  cytokine binding. STAT1, STAT3, and STAT4 are phosphorylated by JAK1 and JAK2, leading
  to dimerization. Baricitinib inhibited JAK1 and JAK2, leading to decreased phosphorylation
  of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT4. The reduction in STAT3 phosphorylation may directly
  inhibit Th 17 cell differentiation. The reduction in STAT1 and STAT4 phosphorylation
  suppresses Th 1 cell differentiation. SEM, standard error of the mean.
