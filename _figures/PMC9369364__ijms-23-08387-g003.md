caption: TM4SF5-mediated liver disease development. Healthy livers can be injured
  by different stimuli, including excessive nutrients, leading to lipid toxicity and
  hepatocyte damage. Following chronic damage, components of the inflammatory environment,
  including TGFβ1, CCL, CCL5, etc., can induce TM4SF5 expression in hepatocytes. Enhanced
  TM4SF5 can play roles in the regulation of the immunometabolic pathway and activity,
  consequently leading to the development of nonalcoholic steatosis (NAFL) with increased
  lipid uptake and accumulation, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with further
  inflammation and immune cell infiltration, fibrosis with STAT3-mediated extracellular
  matrix (i.e., collagen type I, laminin γ2, etc.) deposition, and eventually, hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC) with increased expression levels of AFP (α-fetoprotein), FUCA (α-L-Fucosidase
  1), CD34 (CD34 antigen), laminin γ2, etc. TM4SF5-positive HCC can have features
  of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and actin reorganization, increasing
  the metastatic potential through the promotion of migration and invasion. Each dotted
  arrow indicates TM4SF5-mediated effects on the pathological development or progression.
