caption: (Panel A) Effective cancer therapy may require combination treatments. A
  putative “Drug X” may selectively kill bulk tumor cells that are well-differentiated.
  This could be combined with “Drug Y” to kill cells with a CSC phenotype. Cancer
  cells treated with Drug X may undergo EMT to acquire CSC-like properties, in which
  case co-administration of Drug Y would kill both pre-existing CSCs and those that
  emerge via treatment with Drug X. (Panel B) A novel strategy to eliminate CSCs could
  be to induce their differentiation, which could lead to intrinsic apoptotic cell
  death or could sensitize the resulting differentiated cells to existing therapies.
  This differentiation switch could be facilitated with compounds such as salinomycin,
  HDAC inhibitors or TGF-β pathway inhibitors. Finally, differentiation could also
  be promoted by administration of therapeutic microRNAs, such as mir-200 family members.
