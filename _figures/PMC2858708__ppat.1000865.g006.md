caption: Genes highlighted in blue correspond to those of the operon xpt-pbuX-guaB-guaA
  that is controlled by the guanine riboswitch. Red lines indicate genes that are
  inhibited by PC1 via its binding to the guanine riboswitch. Of these four inhibited
  genes, guaA and guaB are known to be critical for guanine nucleotide biosynthesis
  , , , , ,  and their inhibition very likely lead to the repression of GMP synthesis
  and most probably of RNA and DNA production.
