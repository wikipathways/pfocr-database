caption: Insulin biosynthesis and secretion. (A) Insulin maturation along the granule
  secretory pathway. Preproinsulin mRNA is transcribed from the INS gene and translated
  to preproinsulin peptide. As this transits through the RER and TGN, the prepropeptide
  is processed to its mature form and ultimately stored as hexameric insulin/Zn2+
  crystals within mature secretory granules. (B) Glucose sensing and metabolic signals
  leading to insulin granule secretion. The release of insulin via exocytosis of secretory
  granules from pancreatic β-cells is controlled by a series of metabolic and electrical
  signals arising as a result of glucose entry through GLUTs, phosphorylation by GK,
  and entry into the TCA cycle. The closure of ATP-dependent K+ (KATP) channels triggers
  electrical events that culminate in Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels
  (VDCCs), which triggers exocytosis mediated by SNARE complex proteins. The overall
  secretory response is modulated by numerous receptors, channels, intracellular Ca2+
  stores, metabolic signals, and cytoskeletal elements. (C) Islet communication for
  coordinated pulsatile insulin secretion. Within an islet, β-cells communicate with
  each other and with glucagon-producing α-cells and somatostatin (SST)–producing
  δ-cells to coordinate their activity. Many putative intraislet messengers have been
  implicated, including ATP, Zn2+, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glucagon-like peptide-1
  (GLP-1), acetylcholine (ACh), and others. These, along with electrical coupling
  via gap junctions, are likely important for the physiological coordination of pulsatile
  insulin secretion.
