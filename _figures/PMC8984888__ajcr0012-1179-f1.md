caption: 'A. Overview of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the E3 ligase family.
  Ubiquitin attaches to proteins through a cascade reaction involving E1, E2 and E3
  ligases. E3s attaches ubiquitin through specific lysine residues, which determine
  the fate of the protein after ubiquitin coupling. Among them, K48, K11 and K29 mainly
  mediate the degradation of substrates via 26s proteasome pathway; while K63, K6,
  K27 and K33 are primarily involved in the regulation of some cellular processes
  such as signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, growth response, DNA repair
  and replication, etc. B. The classification of E3 ligases. Based on its structural
  and biochemical characteristics, E3s are classified into three major isoforms: the
  truly interesting novel genes (RING), C-terminus of E6-associated proteins (HECT),
  and RING homology-in-between-RING (RBR) E3s.'
