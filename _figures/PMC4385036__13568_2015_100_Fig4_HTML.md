caption: 'A condensed view of the glycolytic pathway steps, as well as the XR and
  PHB pathway steps that are relevant for the PHB accumulation in the constructed
  strain. Abbreviations: EtOH, ethanol; Ac-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; G3P, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway The parts marked in red are the introduced
  xylose assimilation pathway and the overexpressed PPP. The parts marked in blue
  are the components of the PHB metabolic pathway.'
