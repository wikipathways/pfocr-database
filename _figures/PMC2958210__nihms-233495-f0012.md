caption: '(A) Simplified diagram of afferent/efferent connections of, and internal
  microcircuits within, area CA1. Only the most frequent cell types are shown for
  clarity. The perisomatic region of pyramidal cells (PCs; black and grey) is innervated
  by basket terminals from PV (red) and CCK (orange) cells. Both PV and CCK cells
  receive excitatory feedforward input from CA3 PCs via Schaffer collaterals (sc;
  light blue), and feedback input from CA1 PCs (black lines). CCK cells are also targeted
  by cholinergic axons from the medial septum (ACh; light green), and CCK is expressed
  also in sc-associated interneurons that innervate apical dendrites of PCs. PV cells
  are strongly interconnected and additionally electrically coupled via dendritic
  gap junctions, and they innervate most PCs within their vicinity; this arrangement
  synchronizes the entire network during fast oscillations. CCK cells, in contrast,
  innervate fewer PC targets and thus coordinate activity within smaller neuronal
  ensembles during theta band activity. Reciprocal connections between PV and CCK
  cells can shift the activity between these two complementary pathways. Either basket
  cell type shows somatodendritic expression of ErbB4 (green dots), which can presumably
  be activated by NRG from all three afferent fiber systems (sc, ACh, PC recurrents;
  dashed axons). The left side shows SOM-positive/ErbB4-negative O-LM cells (brown)
  that provide feedback inhibition to apical dendrites of CA1 PCs. O-LM cells also
  target nNOS/ErbB4-coexpressing cells (pink) in slm. Both nNOS cells and dendrites
  of PCs are innervated by glutamatergic lateral perforant path fibers (lpp; blue)
  from the entorhinal cortex that are NRG-positive. This connectivity enables nNOS
  interneurons, depending on the present level of activity in CA1, to regulate the
  corticohippocampal excitation of PCs via shunting currents in slm PC dendrites.
  nNOS cells presumably also innervate other interneurons (IN; grey); whether IN express
  ErbB4 is not known. Therefore, NRG-ErbB4 signaling is positioned to modulate many
  major microcircuits within CA1, with the notable exception of the PC-SOM feedback
  pathway. (B) Comparison of CA1 microcircuits in wildtype and ErbB4−/− mice. nNOS
  and PV cells provide feedforward inhibition to pyramidal cells from EC and CA3 driven
  by the excitatory lpp and sc pathways, respectively, that also directly innervate
  PCs (wildtype, left side). The severe reduction of nNOS and PV cells in ErbB4−/−
  mice (right side) increases the excitation-to-inhibition ratio in PCs, leading to
  increased firing of PCs and simultaneously to a decrease in oscillatory power due
  to decreased temporal coordination of individual neuron activity, as indicated by
  the traces below PCs. In addition, the overall reduction of inhibition increases
  the likelihood to generate epileptiform activity. Abbreviations: see ; acetylcholine
  (ACh), entorhinal cortex (EC), lateral perforant path (lpp), Schaffer collateral
  (sc).'
