caption: Screening of Mtb virulence proteins that interact with proteins from macrophages.
  (a) Scheme of protein screening approach. Briefly, differentiated THP‐1 macrophages
  were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 with the virulent strain
  H37Rv and avirulent strain H37Ra for 12 hr, respectively, and the cell lysates of
  the macrophages were incubated with the Mtb proteome microarray. Then, the differential
  Mtb proteins that bound to the macrophage proteins were analysed. This presented
  as the one replicate from two independent experiments. (b) The subnetwork of the
  differential proteins related to cell wall. The interaction between differential
  proteins was analysed by STRING (p < .05) and the subnetworks were obtained from
  sorting interaction networks according to the GO and KEGG terms using BiNGO v3.0.3
