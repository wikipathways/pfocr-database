caption: The regulatory mechanism of QKI in breast cancer. QKI can directly combine
  with RASA1 mRNA to enhance its expression and reduce the phosphorylation of MAPK
  signaling pathway, thus inhibiting the activation of MAPK pathway and proliferation
  of breast cancer cells. QKI can directly bind to 3’UTR of FoxO1, reduce its mRNA
  stability, and regulate cell cycle and apoptosis. LncRNA TPT1-AS1 can act as a ceRNA
  of miR-330-3p to up regulate QKI expression, thus inhibiting the proliferation,
  migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells. Arrows indicate activation and blunted
  lines indicate inhibition.
