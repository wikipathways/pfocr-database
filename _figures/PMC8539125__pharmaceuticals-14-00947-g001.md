caption: A model of possible molecular mechanism of amantadine action at the level
  of brain dopaminergic signaling. Activation of presynaptic dopamine receptor D2
  may reduce dopamine transporter 1 (DAT1) activity in response to high neurotransmitter
  and elevates dopamine level within synaptic cleft. D2 is a Gi-coupled receptor,
  its excitation causes an inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, decreased
  cAMP production and finally silencing of protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent neuronal
  signaling pathway. Amantadine is also able to inhibit monoaminoxidase B (MAO-B)
  but it does support L-DOPA decar-boxylase (DCC) activity in the presynaptic neuron.
  DDC—L-DOPA decarboxylase; MAO-B—monoaminoxidase B; DAT—dopamine transporter; AC—adenyl
  cyclase; PKA—protein kinase A.
