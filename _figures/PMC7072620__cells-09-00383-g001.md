caption: 'HMGB1/RAGE and HMGB1/TLR4 signaling pathways in AD: HMGB1 can interact with
  extracellular Aβ peptides and decrease Aβ deposition by inhibiting Aβ clearance
  by microglia, as well as increasing β- and γ-secretase activity. RAGE enhances production
  of Aβ, abnormal Tau hyperphosphorylation, and NFTs formation. HMGB1/RAGE and HMGB1/TLR4
  signaling induce neuroinflammation by activating the NF-κB pathway, increasing production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, activating microglia
  and astrocytes in a reactive and inflammatory state, and thus aggravating the AD
  pathogenesis through a vicious cycle of inflammation and oxidative damage. RAGE/CaMKK-β-AMPK,
  the RAGE/ERK1/2, RAGE/GSK-3β, and RAGE/NF-κB pathways have been involved in the
  regulation of abnormal Tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ pathology. RAGE signaling
  has been also implicated in synaptic dysfunction, reduced AChE activity, and neurodegeneration.
  However, activation of RAGE/NF-κB pathway by HMGB1 in adult NPCs promotes neuronal
  differentiation and formation of new neurons, leading to increased adult neurogenesis.
  In addition, HMGB1 may play dual roles in AD pathogenesis, since it can also contribute
  to reparative mechanisms in the AD brain. AD, Alzheimer’s disease; HMGB1, High mobility
