caption: During development of the mouse cerebellum, Ang1 expressed by neural cells
  and Ang2 expressed by ECs signal to Tie2, expressed in PCs to modulate dendritic
  morphogenesis and electrophysiological properties. Angiopoietin ligands expressed
  during the postnatal development also contribute to the proper formation of the
  vasculature in the cerebellum, via Tie2 signaling in ECs.
