caption: Schematic representation of the angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 receptor (AT2R)
  protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) AB55αC signaling pathway by which receptor activation
  with Compound-21 (C-21) inhibits Na+ reabsorption in the renal proximal tubule,
  increases cyclic GMP (cGMP) production, and induces natriuresis. Green arrows indicate
  stimulation; red arrows depict internalization and inactivation; red lines depict
  inhibition; blue arrows stand for effects on ion exchanges by Na+ transporters;
  broken arrows indicate impaired/reduced responses. In Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY, left),
  AT2R activation by exogenous non-peptide agonist C-21 stimulates AT2R recruitment
  from intracellular sites to the apical plasma membranes of renal proximal tubule
  cells via PP2A-dependent signaling, reinforcing and sustaining the natriuretic response.
  AT2R activation via a PP2A AB55αC signaling pathway internalizes and inactivates
  major Na+ transporter molecules Na+-H+-exchanger-3 (NHE-3) and Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA),
  counterbalancing angiotensin II (Ang II) type-1 receptor (AT1R) actions to increase
  Na+ reabsorption by stimulating these transporters. In WKY, PP2A inhibition with
  calyculin A inhibits AT2R translocation, cGMP formation, and natriuresis. In spontaneously
  hypertensive rats (SHR, right) AT2Rs are defective resulting in markedly reduced
  apical plasma membrane translocation, failure to associate with and activate PP2A,
  and internalize and inactivate NHE-3 and NKA. Modified from Circ Res. 2022, doi:10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.319519
