caption: The relationship between ferroptosis regulators and E3s. The system xc--GSH-GPX4
  pathway is important for protecting cells from ferroptosis and E3s participate in
  regulating this pathway. E3s can regulate lipid metabolism pathways including polyunsaturated
  fatty acid-containing phospholipids (PUFA-PL) and monounsaturated fatty acid-containing
  phospholipids (MUFA-PL). E3s also regulate key factors associated with the uptake,
  export, storage and utilization of iron during ferroptosis. Besides, E3s are involved
  in the modulation of other ferroptosis regulators including NRF2, Hippo pathway
  effectors (YAP and TAZ), VDAC, and LSH.
