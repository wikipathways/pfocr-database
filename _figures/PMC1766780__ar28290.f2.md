caption: Cytokine signalling and the pathogenesis of severe combined immunodeficiency
  (SCID). Cytokines that use γc, interleukin (IL)-2, 4, 7, 9, 15, and 21, are essential
  for many aspects of immune cell development and function (see table 1). Mutations
  of IL-7R, γc, and Janus kinase3 (Jak)3 disrupt the action of these cytokines and
  lead to SCID. Mutations of these genes account for roughly two thirds to three quarters
  of the cases of SCID. X-SCID, X-linked SCID, AR-SCID, autosomal recessive SCID.
