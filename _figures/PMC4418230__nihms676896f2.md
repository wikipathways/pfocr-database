caption: (A–C) The LGV C. t central carbon metabolic network. The distribution of
  all synonymous (green), neutral (yellow), non-neutral (orange), and nonsense (red)
  bearing alleles is depicted for each ORF in the network. Distributions are normalized
  to total number of SNV bearing alleles identified per ORF. All ORFs with observed
  nonsense alleles are shaded in light red. (A) Production and break down of branched
  glycogen is not necessary as LGV C. t tolerates nonsense mutations in glgB and glgX.
  (B) The presence of a nonsense mutation in pgi suggests that the pentose phosphate
  pathway is sufficient to circumvent loss of fructose-6-phosphate production when
  the EMP pathway (Glycolysis) is blocked. (C) Nonsense mutations in glt and sucA
  suggest that LGV biovars can sustain metabolic activity with a severely curtailed
  TCA cycle. The TCA cycle is further truncated due the presence of a fumC (dashed
  box) pseudogene. All compounds imported from the host are shown in blue. (D) LGV
  C. t biovars can tolerate defects in their DNA mismatch repair machinery as suggested
  by the presence of nonsense bearing alleles in mutS and mutL. (E) Defects in the
  nucleotide excision repair pathway are also tolerated as evidenced by the presence
  of nonsense bearing alleles in uvrA and uvrC.
