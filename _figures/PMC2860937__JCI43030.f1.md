caption: Shown is the relationship among different proteins encoded by genes known
  to be responsible for genetic syndromes associated with activation of mTORC1. Activation
  of mTORC1 ultimately leads to increased protein synthesis, and thereby increased
  cell growth. Germline mutations that result in mTORC1 hyperactivation are therefore
  associated with syndromes characterized by cellular overgrowth, usually in the form
  of hamartomas. LKB1 also activates an mTORC1-independent pathway that controls neuronal
  polarity specification; it is therefore possible that the neuronal migration defects
  seen in individuals with PMSE may be due to effects on this pathway, and not to
  hyperactivation of mTOR signaling. This would explain the lack of neuronal migration
  defects in disorders associated with germline mutations that do not affect LKB1
  localization or function. 4E-BP1, eIF4E-binding protein 1; eIF4E, eukaryotic translation
