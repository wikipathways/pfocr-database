caption: Bile acid synthetic pathways. The conversion of cholesterol into bile acids
  occurs through two different pathways, i.e., the classical (or neutral) pathway
  and the alternative (or acidic) pathway, which is quantitatively less important.
  The classical pathway is initiated by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (encoded by CYP7A1)
  in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes, and the alternative pathway is initiated
  by mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (encoded by CYP27A1). In the liver, 3β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase (3βHSD, HSD3B7) converts 7α-hydroxycholesterol to 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one
  (C4), which is used as a surrogate marker of bile acid synthesis. Sterol 12α-hydroxylase
  (encoded by CYP8B1) introduces a hydroxyl group at the steroid nucleus (at C-12),
  ultimately leading to the synthesis of cholic acid (CA). Without 12α-hydroxylation,
  chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is generated. Aldos-keto reductase 1D1 (AKR1D1) and
  AKR1C4 catalyse isomerization and saturation of the steroid ring. CYP27A1 then catalyses
  steroid side-chain oxidation. CA and CDCA represent the two main end-products of
  the primary bile acid synthesis pathways in the human liver and are conjugated with
  glycine or taurine before secretion into bile. In the intestine, these primary bile
  acids are subjected to activities of bacterial bile salt hydrolases and dehydroxylases,
  generating the various secondary bile acid species.
