caption: The tryptophan-kynurenine metabolic pathway and bioactive kynurenine metabolites.
  The pathway depends on the type of cells. In some cells some enzyme is missing,
  and thus, some metabolite is not produced. The kynurenine metabolites are multifarious
  molecules with various properties. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands are
  circled with a blue dotted line; toxic kynurenines (KYNs) are in red shade, and
  protective KYNs are in green shade [].
