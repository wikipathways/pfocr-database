caption: Hepatocytes contribute to 25% of the basal levels of LCN2 protein (approximately
  62 ng/ml) but are primarily responsible for the production of the highly elevated
  serum LCN2 protein levels following bacterial infection or PHx. This production
  is mainly dependent on the activation of the hepatic STAT3 signaling pathway activated
  by IL-6. Thus, hepatocyte-derived LCN2 proteins play an important role in controlling
  bacterial infection and promoting liver regeneration.
