caption: The dysfunctional pathways of miR-15a and miR-24-1. (A) The dysfunctional
  pathways of miR-15a. The miR-15a targeted CYP11B1, KRT33B, RUNX1T1, and SIK1. CYP11B1
  and KRT33B were involved in the estrogen biosynthesis signaling pathway and RUNX1T1
  and SIK1 were involved in pathways in cancer and tumor suppression process. (B)
  The dysfunctional pathways of miR-24-1. The miR-24-1 targeted MAP3K4, MLANA, and
  SFRP5 which participated in the MAPK signaling pathway, NF-kappaB Signaling pathway,
  and WNT signaling pathway, respectively.
