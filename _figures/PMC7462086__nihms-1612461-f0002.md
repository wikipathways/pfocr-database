caption: 'SOS1 activity is governed by complex interactions between six distinct functional
  domains. (A) SOS1 activity is natively suppressed by a primary auto-inhibitory unit
  comprised of the N-terminal histone-like fold (HF), Dbl homology (DH) domain, and
  pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and by secondary mechanisms facilitated by the
  proline-rich (PR) tail. This closed conformation blocks access of RAS to dual binding
  sites in the SOS1 catalytic core, comprised of the RAS-exchange motif (REM) and
  CDC25 domain. (B) Growth factor binding facilitates activation of receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs) and recruitment of SOS1 to the membrane via direct interaction of
  the PR tail with GRB2, itself bound to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the activated
  RTKs. Secondary membrane associations are further provided by the HF and PH domains
  via phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidic acid (PA). Alleviation
  of repression by these interactions permit RAS binding to a distal binding site
  in the REM, initiating additional allosteric changes that recruit a second RAS molecule
  to the adjacent CDC25 catalytic site. Following GDP/GTP exchange, SOS1 remains strongly
  associated with the membrane, facilitating recruitment and activation of additional
  RAS molecules. (C) Simplified overview of RAS signaling pathways and associated
  disease phenotypes. Solid arrows represent individual steps in the ERK signaling
  cascade. Hatched arrows represent steps in alternate RAS-mediated AKT and JNK signaling
  pathways. Disease phenotypes associated with activating variants in individual pathway
  components are listed in italics. Affected genes are indicated in brackets. Additional
