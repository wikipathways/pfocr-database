caption: Astrocyte G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. (A) A major communication
  pathway from neurons to astrocytes occurs through GPCRs expressed by astrocytes.
  (B) (1) Activation of astrocyte GPCRs (magenta) activate alpha subunits Gαq, Gαi,
  or Gαs. (2) Tools for astrocyte manipulation target these pathways. (3) Following
  Gq GPCR activation, the phospholipase C (PLC)/inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)
  pathway and ITPR2 receptor activation induces release of calcium (Ca2+, yellow)
  from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER, white). All three G protein signaling pathways
  are known to increase calcium in astrocytes though the intracellular signaling pathways
  are not fully resolved (question mark). (4) Additional sources of calcium include
  calcium influx through ionotropic glutamate receptors α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid receptor (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA); transient receptor
  potential (TRP) channels; store-operated calcium channels (SOC); and reversed operation
  of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (not shown). (5) Calcium is also released from mitochondria.
