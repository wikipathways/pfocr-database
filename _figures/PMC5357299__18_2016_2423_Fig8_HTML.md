caption: Schematic overview of the proposed iOGN:TLR4 signaling pathway. TLR4 stimulation
  with LPS results in receptor dimerization and subsequent high-affinity binding of
  the bridging adaptor molecules TRAM and TIRAP. The bound and activated MyD88 then
  activates IRAK4, TRAF6, TAK1, and IKK complexes, and TRIF signals through RIP1 to
  TRAF6/TAK1 and IKK. Both of these pathways result in increased pro-inflammatory
  cytokine expression. The phosphorylation of MAPKs by TAK1 is enhanced by OGN, resulting
  in increased c-jun phosphorylation with subsequent nuclear translocation of AP1
  (the phosphorylated c-jun/c fos complex), which again resulted in increased pro-inflammatory
  cytokine expression, reinforcing the inflammatory response []
