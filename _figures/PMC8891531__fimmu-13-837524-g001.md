caption: Intracellular Pathways Responsible for Trained Immunity. All three training
  agents train innate immunity to induce epigenetic modifications through multiple
  pathways. BCG binds to TLR 2 or TLR 4 and signals via the Akt/mTOR and NOD2 pathways,
  leading to downstream epigenetic modifications at H3K4me3. Activation of the Akt/mTOR
  pathway leads to upregulation of OXPHOS and glycolysis. The epigenetic change of
  H3K4me3 induced an increased production of IL-1β, TNF, IL-6, and IL-32 cytokines.
  β-glucan binds to the dectin-1 receptor to mediate downstream signaling through
  the Akt/mTOR/HIF-1α pathway. This signaling leads to decreased OXPHOS, increased
  glycolysis, and increased production of fumarate, succinate, and mevalonate in the
  TCA cycle. Fumarate further inhibits the KDM5 histone demethylase which acts at
  H3K4me3. β-glucan induced trained immunity was also shown to induce dynamic epigenetic
  changes at H3K27ac. The epigenetic changes further lead to increased IL-1β and IL-32
  secretion. LPS can induce trained immunity by binding to TLR4 and signaling through
  the MAPK/p38 pathway, resulting in reduced OXPHOS, increased glycolysis, increased
  levels of succinate, and activation of transcription factors C/EBPβ and NF-κB. Additionally,
  LPS induces the phosphorylation and release of the inhibitory transcription factor
  ATF7, which inhibits the repressive histone mark H3K9me2. Collectively, these epigenetic
  changes upregulate the production of TNF and IL-6.
