caption: Interaction between TKIs and BCRP. An active PI3K–Akt pathway is apparently
  important for BCRP expression and localisation in the plasma membrane. (A) Stimulation
  of this pathway with EGF, for example, will phosphorylate Akt, leading to BCRP localisation
  to the plasma membrane. (B) (I) BCRP can actively efflux TKIs, thus inducing resistance
  to these drugs. However, BCRP-mediated TKIs resistance might be abrogated by TKIs
  inhibition of the PI3K–Akt pathway, which can lead to (II) BCRP relocalisation to
  the intracellular compartment and/or (III) decreased BCRP expression.
