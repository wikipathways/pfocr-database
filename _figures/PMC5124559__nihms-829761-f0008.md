caption: (A) Schematic representation of the peptide generation pathway. KNG1 is first
  cleaved by KLK2 to form KNG1K438-R457, and subsequently the C-terminal arginine
  is removed by CPN1. (B) Ingenuity pathway maps between BRCA1 and KLK2. EP300, AR,
  and CTNNB1 are three key molecules that connect BRCA1 and KLK2.
