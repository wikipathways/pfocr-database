caption: '. Adopted from Lobry et al. 2014. Mammal Notch canonical activation pathway.
  Cognate interaction between Notch receptors and Notch ligands (Jagged/Delta) triggers
  2 consecutive proteolytic cleavages by the ADAM10 metalloprotease and the γ-secretase
  complex. This generates ICN, the signaling portion of the receptor, which enters
  the nucleus and displaces corepressors (SMRT and CtBP1) and recruits the coactivator
  MAML1 and the acetyltransferase p300. ICN activating complex is short-lived, and
  ICN gets phosphorylated on its PEST domain and subsequently ubiquitinated by Fbw7
  and targeted for degradation by the proteasome. ADP: Adenosine diphosphate; ATP:
  adenosine triphosphate.'
