caption: Neuroblastoma is a spectrum of diseases with a wide range of clinical behaviors.
  Disruption of the normal maturation progression with different genetic drivers at
  different times leads to heterogeneity of tumor initiating cells. Interaction between
  different epigenetic and genetic factors complicates the task of defining a primary
  oncogenic driver or pathway for this disease. This results in a wide range of pathologies
  with highly variable responses to treatment.
