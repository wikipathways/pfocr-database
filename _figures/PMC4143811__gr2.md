caption: Mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRMT) in C. elegans and mammals.
  (A) In C. elegans, mis-folded proteins are degraded by the ClpP protease and the
  cleaved products are exported to the cytosol through the HAF-1 peptide exporter.
  These peptides serve as a signal for activation of transcription factor, ATFS-1.
  Subsequently, ATFS-1 activates Ubl-5 to form a complex with transcription factor
  Dve-1 to transcriptionally activate UPRMT genes. (B) Currently, the signaling pathways
  involved in the UPRMT in response to mitochondrial protein stress are not completely
  defined in mammals. The accumulation of mis-folded proteins has been shown to activate
  the UPRMT through the Jnk/c-Jun pathway. In response to mis-folded proteins, protein
  kinase R (PKR) is activated and activates the nuclear translocation of Jnk via phosphorylation,
  which activates the transcription factor, c-Jun. Activated c-Jun in turn binds to
  the activation protein-1 (AP-1) element to initiate the transcription of CHOP. Subsequently,
  CHOP and co-transcriptional activator, C/EBPβ, induce the expression of UPRMT genes.
  Interestingly, activation of the Jnk/c-Jun pathway requires the ClpP protease suggesting
  that cleaved peptides could potentially serve as an initial signal for the induction
  of the UPRMT.
