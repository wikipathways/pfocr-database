caption: 'Graphical summary of the changes in the expression of genes for the biosynthesis
  of phenolic compounds under drought conditions. qRT-PCR data are from Table . Arrows
  highlight significant changes in gene expression according to the analysis of Table
  ; green and yellow represent WT and Ljgln2-2 plants respectively. Arrows pointing
  up mean induction and arrows pointing down mean repression; one arrow means moderate
  (<6 times, up or down) modulation while two arrows mean high (>6 times, up or down)
  modulation. A color code has been used to emphasize different branches of the pathway:
  blue for the common initial steps for phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, black for some
  enzymes of the central flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, gray for some enzymes for
  anthocyanins and protoanthocyanidins and red for some enzymes for isoflavonoid biosynthesis.
  For space reasons several intermediates in the biosynthesis of isoflavonoids have
  been omitted. The genes measured encode for enzymes that belongs to: (1) the common
  “entry” to the pathway, that comprehends the genes encoding for PAL, C4H and 4CL;
  (2) the central flavonoid biosynthetic pathways including the two key enzymes for
  the formation of the cyclic flavonoid scaffold: CHS, CHI, F3H, and FLS for the branch
  that leads to flavonols; (3) the first committed reactions for the biosynthesis
  of anthocyanins: DFR and ANS and for the biosynthesis of protoanthocyanidins (also
  known as condensed tannins): LAR and ANR; 4) the branch for the biosynthesis of
  isoflavonoids, that shares the enzyme activities CHS and CHI with the common flavonoid
  pathway, but also needs the activities of PKR, IFS, HI4''OMT, HID and I2''H and
  the “late” activities of this branch that lead to the formation of the phytoalexins
  vestitone: IFR and of the isoflavan vestitol: VR and PTR. For a detailed description
  of these steps see Davies and Schwinn () and Shelton et al. ().'
