caption: Translational balancing by PERK restores correct protein glycosylation. Symbol
  and font sizes reflect relative amounts of LLO, protein, and hexose. Arrow thicknesses
  represent relative activity at each step. Glycans from LLO intermediates are indicated
  by white squares, with extension to G3M9Gn2 indicated by attachment of black squares.
  (A) Under normal conditions, LLO intermediates are efficiently extended to G3M9Gn2-P-P-Dol,
  with proper N-glycosylation. (B) Metabolic dysfunction (for example, by limited
  hexose supply) reduces flux through the LLO pathway, leading to accumulation of
  LLO intermediates, incorrect protein glycosylation, ER stress, PERK activation,
  and phosphorylation of eIF2α. (C) Translational balancing requires only moderate
  translation attenuation by eIF2α-P. This reduces LLO consumption, allowing LLO intermediates
  to be extended to G3M9Gn2-P-P-Dol even with metabolic dysfunction. Note that fewer
  glycoproteins are produced than normal, but they are correctly glycosylated with
  G3M9Gn2.
