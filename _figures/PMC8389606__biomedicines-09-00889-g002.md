caption: Canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways. Shown are the two most common
  NF-κB pathways, including several of the pathway components that are affected by
  mutations in cancer. Blue font, affected by gain-of-function mutations; red font,
  affected by loss-of-function mutations; purple font, affected by both gain- and
  loss-of-function mutations. See text for more details.
