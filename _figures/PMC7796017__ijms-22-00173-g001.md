caption: The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. PI3K is activated by the binding of
  ligands (insulin, growth factors, hormones) to RTKs, but also to GPCR (chemokines).
  Once activated, this protein kinase will catalyze the phosphorylation of PIP2 to
  PIP3. AKT is recruited to the plasma membrane where it undergoes two phosphorylation
  processes, one catalyzed by PDK1 at the level of threonine residue and the second
  reaction being catalyzed by mTORC2. Once activated by phosphorylation, AKT will
  phosphorylate other substances such as the mTOR complex, which will be associated
  in the end with protein synthesis and cell growth. Other phosphorylated substrates,
  such as GSK-3 and Fox01, will be inhibited, associated with cell proliferation and
  survival. PTEN is the major negative regulator of this signaling pathway involved
  in PIP3 dephosphorylation.
