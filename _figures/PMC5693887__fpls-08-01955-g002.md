caption: A subset of volatile attractants involved in deceptive orchid pollination
  and their potential biosynthetic pathways. (A) Formation of 2-hydroxy-6-methylacetophenone
  (2) using one acetyl-CoA and four malonyl-CoA starter units via a polyketide synthase
  pathway involving aldol condensation, reduction, tautomerization, and decarboxylation/dehydration
  reactions. Involvement of polyketide synthase (PKS) is indicated. (B) Formation
  of the (Methylthio)phenols, 2-(methylthio)phenol (3), 2-(methylthio)benzene-1,4-diol
  (4), 4-hydroxy-3-(methylthio)benzaldehyde (5), and 4-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(methylthio)phenol
  (6) via sulfhydryl/thiol (-SH) methylation of sulfhydryl-containing precursors.
  Involvement of S-methyltransferase (SMT) and O-methyltransferase (OMT) is indicated.
  (C) Formation of dimethyl disulfide (7) and dimethyl trisulfide (8) via auto-oxidation
  of methanethiol. The action of C-S lyase activity on methionine produces α-ketobutyrate,
  ammonia, and methanethiol. Involvement of methionine gamma-lyase (MGL) is indicated.
  (D) Formation of 1-octen-3-ol (12) via the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway with arachidonic
  acid and γ-linolenic acid as precursors. Involvement of LOX enzymes is indicated.
  Note that LOX activities on arachidonic acid and γ-linolenic acid precursors can
  give rise to 12-Hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE) and 10-γ-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic
  acid (10-γ-HPOTE) products, respectively. 12-HPETE and 10-γ-HPOTE serve as intermediates
  for the formation of compounds such as 12 and (2Z)-octen-1-ol via unusual LOX fatty
  acid chain-cleaving lyase activities. (E) Formation of ethyl 2-methylpropanoate
  (16) via decarboxylation and esterification of α-ketoisovalerate intermediate. (F)
  Formation of 3-methyl butanol (18) via decarboxylation and reduction/oxidation of
  α-ketoisocaproate intermediate. Transamination/deamination of L-valine and L-leucine
  leads to the formation of α-ketoisovalerate and α-ketoisocaproate, respectively.
  Involvement of branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT) enzymes is indicated. Note
  that α-ketoisovalerate can serve as alternative intermediate for (18). The numbering
  of compounds are kept consistent as listed in Figure  for clarity.
