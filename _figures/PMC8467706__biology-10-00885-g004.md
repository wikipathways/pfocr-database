caption: Expression of the genes involved in the carbohydrate metabolic pathway of
  A. oryzae BCC7051. The expression levels of individual genes were transformed to
  logarithmic space by using using log2(FPKM + 1). The C5_t1 (orange bar) and C5_t2
  (light orange bar) represent the xylose-grown cultures at active growth and lipid-accumulating
  phases, respectively. The C6_t1 (green bar) and C6_t2 (light green bar) indicate
  the glucose-grown cultures at active growth and lipid-accumulating phases, respectively.
  Red and black asterisks indicate significant DEGs of the cultures using xylose and
  glucose, respectively.
