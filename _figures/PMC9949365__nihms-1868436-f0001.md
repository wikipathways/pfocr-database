caption: a) Experimental strategy for parallel assessment of cell-beneficial and cell-detrimental
  effects of nuclear export inhibition with the XPO1 inhibitor, selinexor. Pooled
  CRISPR-Cas9 screening in OCI-AML2 cells treated with selinexor reveals genetic modifiers
  of drug sensitivity. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis in selinexor treated
  OCI-AML2 cells reveals drug-responsive protein and phosho-protein expression.b)
  Selinexor depletion gene scores ranked from most depleted to most enriched in the
  selinexor versus vehicle treated populations. Scoring genes in the PI3K/AKT pathway
  are annotated as sensitizers (orange, depleted in the selinexor population) or resisters
  (blue, enriched in the selinexor population). Screens conducted as n = 2 independent
  replicates with n = 5 sgRNAs per gene.c) Volcano plot depicting differential expression
  for 160 RPPA probes following 48 hours of selinexor treatment relative to statistical
  significance in dataset. Annotated probes comprise pathways with decreased expression
  (blue) or increased expression (orange). RPPA expression analysis conducted as n
  = 3 independent experiments. P-values computed by multiple unpaired (two-sided)
  t-tests.d) Schematic relating PI3K/AKT pathway members to selinexor depletion gene
  scores and RPPA expression. Genes scoring as selinexor sensitizers are shaded in
  orange; genes scoring as selinexor resisters are shaded in blue; genes absent from
  library not shaded. Phosphorylated proteins with selinexor-induced increased (orange)
  RPPA expression are indicated.
