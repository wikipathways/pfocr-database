caption: 'Model for the role of REDD1 in the regulating muscle protein balance in
  response to acute alcohol. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that alcohol,
  similar to other metabolic stressors, inhibits mTOR kinase activity, mRNA translation
  and protein synthesis via increases in REDD1. Such increases either directly or
  indirectly also may modulate protein degradation by regulating autophagy (via ULK1)
  and/or the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (via atrogenes). Abbreviations used include:
  REDD1, regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1; TSC, tuberous sclerosis
  complex; Rheb, Ras homolog enriched in brain; S6K1, ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1;
  rpS6, ribosomal protein S6; 4E-BP1, eukaryotic protein initiation factor 4E binding
  protein-1; ULK-1, Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase-1; AKT/PKB, protein kinase
  B.'
