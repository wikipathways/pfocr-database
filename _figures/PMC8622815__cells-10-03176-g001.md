caption: AHR genomic signaling pathway. Before ligand binding, AHR is bound by a chaperone
  complex (described in the text and the figure), which maintains its localization
  in the cytoplasm. Cells are exposed to different AHR ligands, such as bioproducts
  of microbiota, phytochemicals, xenobiotics, or endogenous ligands, mostly derived
  from L-tryptophan (L-Trp). When a ligand binds, the AHR changes its conformation
  and c-Src and AHR-interacting proteins (AIP) are released, resulting in the exposure
  of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the AHR’s N-terminus, that allows docking
  of importin β and mediates nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Once in the nucleus, the
  ligand-activated AHR heterodimerizes with its protein partner, the AHR nuclear translocator
  (ARNT), at the time it dissociates of cytoplasmic chaperone complex. (A) The ligand–AHR–ARNT
  heterodimeric complex binds specific DNA sequences located in the promoter regions
  of target genes, named xenobiotic responsive elements (XRE), and recruits additional
  coactivators and components of the transcriptional machinery (described in the text)
  that are required to initiate transcription of the target gene. (B) The ligand–AHR–ARNT
  complex can also interact with non-canonical AHR partners and regulate additional
  target genes. (A) Canonical genes include enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CyP) family
  and AHR repressor (AHRR). CyP enzymes metabolize AHR ligands and the AHRR competes
  with the AHR for interaction with the ARNT and DNA binding. After transcription,
  the AHR is exported out of the nucleus and is rapidly degraded by the proteasome.
  PAH—polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; HAH—halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon; ROS—reactive
  oxygen species; HSP90—90 kDa heat shock protein; EDC—epidermal differentiation complex;
  TF—transcriptional factor. Figure was created with BioRender.com.
