caption: Rho GTPase and heterotrimeric G-protein pathway interactions regulating neurotransmission
  and locomotion. G-protein pathways (blue boxes) interact with Rho GTPase pathways
  (red boxes) directly (solid arrows) or through indirect or unknown mechanisms (dashed
  arrows). Rho exists in two separate populations, only one of which interacts with
  DGK-1 (; ). The Gαo (GOA-1) pathway negatively regulates Gαq (EGL-30) and synaptic
  vesicle signaling, but is omitted for clarity (; ; ). UNC-73 RhoGEF-2 activity (UNC-73)
  functions downstream of EGL-30 and likely another factor(s) to modulate locomotion
  through dense core vesicle (DCV) and/or synaptic vesicle (SV) signaling. Constitutive
  Gαs (GSA-1) pathway activation can compensate for unc-73 RhoGEF-2 mutant locomotion
  defects, but the mechanism is not known. See the Discussion and references for details
