caption: Schematic representation of the variety of stimuli that can up-regulate NKG2D
  and DNAM-1 ligands. There is evidence that both in normal cells (e.g., antigen-activated
  T lymphocytes), as well as in pathological conditions, including virally-infected
  cells (in particular with HIV-1) and cancer cells, a major regulatory pathway involved
  in ligand up-regulation is the DNA damage response (DDR), activated by different
  stimuli. The increased expression of activating ligands has been shown to be implicated
  in the recognition and elimination of “stressed” cells by NK cells, and presumably
  also by other cytotoxic cells (i.e., γδ T cells and CD8+ T cells).
