  The signal from IDA-HAE/HSL2 is suggested to be transduced via a MAPK cascade that
  includes MKK4, MKK5, MPK3, and MPK6. Genetic evidence suggests that BP/KNAT1 acts
  as a negative downstream component of this signaling pathway by restricting cell
  wall degradation and consequently cell separation and the expression of KNAT2 and
  KNAT6. Upon activation of the IDA signaling pathway, the BP/KNAT1 restriction of
  KNAT2 and KNAT6 is elevated, and these transcription factors can act as positive
  regulators of floral organ separation. In addition, BP/KNAT1 is a positive regulator
  of EVR, which influences cell elongation by a separate parallel pathway ().
