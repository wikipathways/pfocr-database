caption: Tocopherol Biosynthetic Pathway and vte Mutations in Arabidopsis.Enzymes
  are indicated by black boxes, and mutations are indicated by gray letters and lines.
  Thick arrows show the primary biosynthetic route in wild-type leaves. DMPBQ, 2,3-dimethyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinol;
  GGDP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; GGDR, GGDP reductase; HGA, homogentisic acid;
  HPP, hydroxyphenylpyruvate; HPPD, HPP dioxygenase; HPT, HGA phytyltransferase; MPBQ,
  2-methyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinol; MT, MPBQ methyltransferase; PDP, phytyl diphosphate;
  TC, tocopherol cyclase; γ-TMT, γ-tocopherol methyltransferase; vte1, vte2, and vte4,
  mutants of TC, HPT, and γ-TMT, respectively.
