caption: Overview of canonical Wnt signaling pathway and targeted therapy in AS. In
  steady state, absence of Wnt ligands causes β‐catenin to be phosphorylated by the
  destruction complex, ubiquitinated by β‐Trcp, and finally degraded by the proteasome.
  While in active state, Wnt proteins induce a spatial interaction between the receptors
  Frizzled proteins and LRP5/6, which hinders the degradation of β‐catenin by destruction
  complex, allowing accumulated β‐catenin to translocate into the nucleus and interact
  with transcription factors TCF/LEF, upregulating the transcription of fibrosis‐related
  genes. Through enhancing activity of GSK3 β and directly inhibiting β‐catenin as
  a targeted therapeutic strategy
