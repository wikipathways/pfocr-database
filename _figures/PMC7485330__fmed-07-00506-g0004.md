caption: Purinergic system implication in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. DAMPS or
  PAMPs present in the microenvironment are recognized by TLR receptors, which in
  turn, upregulate pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 expression through NF-κB activity. BCP
  and CPPD crystals can be both recognized by TLRs and phagocytized by the cell. Impaired
  particle or crystal phagocytosis by phagosomes leads to cathepsin B release and
  mitochondrial dysfunction, which induce elevated ROS production and consequent NLRP3
  activation. Additionally, frustrated phagocytosis can lead to massive ATP release
  through Pannexin-1, activatingP2X7 and causing ionic cytoplasmic imbalance. Excessive
  K+ efflux, especially through TWIK2, and Na+ and Ca2+ influx through P2X7 activates
  NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of different P2Y by ATP or ADP increases intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration. Particles can also impede induction of purinergic AC-cAMP pathway
  allowing NLRP3 activity. A2AR activation by extracellular adenosine induces HIF-1α
  upregulation, which activates NLRP3. AC, adenylate cyclase; AK, adenosine kinase;
  BCP, basic calcium phosphate; CPPD, calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate; DAMP, danger-associated
