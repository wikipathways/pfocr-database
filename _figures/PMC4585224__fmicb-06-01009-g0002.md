caption: 'Opposing effects of anthrolysin, LF and EF on host cell apoptosis. Anthrolysin
  secreted by B. anthracis binds surface TLR4 receptors with downstream signaling
  through either TRIF and PKR to promote apoptosis, or through MEK to inhibit apoptosis;
  the latter inhibitory effect is opposed by LF cleaving MEK, thus promoting apoptosis.
  EF signals through the PKA and CREB pathway which has benefit in delaying apoptosis
  until the phagocytic host cell reaches the lymph node, an optimal niche for germination
  with further toxin release. Glossary: PKR, protein kinase regulated by RNA; PKA
  protein kinase A; CREB, cAMP response-element-binding protein; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing
  adapter-inducing interferon-β.'
