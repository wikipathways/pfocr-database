caption: Molecular mechanism of SGGY-suppressed H2O2-induced SH-SY5Y cells’ cytotoxicity.
  H2O2 increases the level of intracellular ROS, and then the oxidative stress induced
  by H2O2 triggers the JNK, p38, and Nrf2 signaling pathways. While SGGY pre-treatment
  attenuates the generation of intracellular ROS and dysfunction of mitochondria,
  it suppresses the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 and promotes the nuclear translations
  of Nrf2 to improve the antioxidant capacity of cells, thereby enhancing the activity
  of cells. The arrows in green highlight the primary roles of SGGY in protecting
  SH-SY5Y cells from H2O2-stimulated oxidative stress.
