caption: Primary skin carcinomas are initially resistant to TRAIL (R), but become
  sensitized (S) by detachment. Activated NK cells expressing TRAIL are the likely
  effector cells that kill detached carcinoma cells via TRAIL-R-mediated apoptosis.
  Detached carcinoma cells not expressing functional TRAIL-R are resistant to TRAIL
  induced apoptosis, which enhances their metastatic ability. The TRAIL system could
  generate selection pressure during metastasis to develop TRAIL resistance, either
  through mutations or downregulation of TRAIL-R or other components of the TRAIL
  apoptosis pathway, which could have a negative impact towards TRAIL-based therapy
  of established metastases.TRAIL-R expression inhibits metastasis formation of skin
  carcinomas by mediating TRAIL-induced apoptosis induced in detached skin carcinoma
  cells. Cell lines from primary skin carcinomas are resistant to TRAIL (RS), but
  detachment of WT skin carcinoma cells leads to sensitization of those cells to TRAIL
  by detachment (S). Activated NK cells express TRAIL, have been shown to mediate
  anti-tumor effects of TRAIL, and are likely to be the effector cells killing detached
  skin carcinoma cells via TRAIL-R-mediated apoptosis. This could potentially lead
  to selection pressure resulting in TRAIL resistance (RR) in detached, early metastasizing
  cells, either through irreversible mutations or downregulation of essential signaling
  components of the apoptosis-inducing TRAIL/TRAIL-R pathway.
