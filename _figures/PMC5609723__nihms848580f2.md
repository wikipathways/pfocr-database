caption: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated hepatotoxicity is a cumulative response
  to the overall burden of multiple disrupted pathways rather than a single adverse
  effect. Metabolic reprogramming redirects the pentose phosphate pathway and serine
  biosynthesis toward NADPH production in support of antioxidant defense, creating
  a tug-of-war between toxic responses and defensive mechanisms. Red represents factors
  or adverse effects which promote toxicity, while green represents defensive mechanisms.
