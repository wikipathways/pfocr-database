caption: 'Hepatitis C virus replication cycle. The replicative cycle of hepatitis
  C virus (HCV) is displayed. HCV interaction with its cell receptors is shown. Upon
  entry, the HCV genome is released into the cytoplasm and subsequently translated
  and translocate into the RE. The membranous web is used as scaffold for viral replication.
  Interferon and TLR3 signaling pathways are disrupted by the HCV NS3/4A protease
  by cleaving MAVS and TRIF (upper right window). Assembled virions are released via
  the constitutive secretory pathway. HCV: Hepatitis C virus; MAVS: Mitochondrial
  antiviral signaling protein; TRIF: Toll-like receptor-domain-containing adapter-inducing
  interferon-β.'
