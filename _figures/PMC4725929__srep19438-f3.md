caption: The pathway model was obtained from KEGG Pathway. (a) Identification of grazing
  responsive genes in the tolerant population. Green boxes surrounding EC identifiers
  represent genes with greater transcript abundance in the ungrazed versus grazed
  tolerant plants. Red boxes identify genes with transcripts that were more abundant
  in the grazed versus ungrazed tolerant plants. Boxes with mixed colors indicate
  both under-expression and over-expression of different transcripts of the same gene.
  Seventeen genes were consistently suppressed, while eight genes exhibited variable
  expression. Results suggest a strong suppression of this pathway in response to
  grazing. (b) Identification of 21 grazing responsive genes from (a) that were differentially
  expressed between tolerant and intolerant plants, both grazed. Green boxes identify
  genes with greater transcript abundance in the tolerant versus intolerant plants.
  Red boxes identify genes with greater transcript abundance in the intolerant versus
  tolerant plants. Boxes with mixed colors are as described above. Three and five
  genes were more abundantly expressed in the grazed tolerant and intolerant populations,
  respectively. Thirteen other genes possessed different homologous transcripts whose
  abundance varied between the tolerant in tolerant plants. Results suggest that expression
  of grazing responsive genes was highly variable between tolerant and intolerant
  plants, both of which were grazed.
