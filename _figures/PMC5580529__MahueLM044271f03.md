caption: Proposed model for the regulation of synaptic restructuring by Wnt during
  learning (from ). (A) When extracellular Wnt is maintained at basal levels, the
  proteasomal degradation of β-catenin by Gsk-3 is inhibited, allowing β-catenin to
  stabilize cadherin at the synapse. During learning Wnt levels are transiently decreased,
  resulting in the destabilization and phosphorylation of β-catenin, which in turn
  destabilizes cadherin, temporarily rendering the synapse labile until basal Wnt
  levels are reinstated. (B) Inhibiting the recovery of Wnt signaling following the
  transient decrease that occurs during learning via, for instance, administration
  of the Wnt antagonist Dkk1, prevents reinitiation of the stable phase and impairs
  memory consolidation. (C) Inhibiting the transient decrease of Wnt during learning
  likewise inhibits consolidation, but does so by preventing destabilization of β-catenin
  and, thus, the initiation of the labile phase itself.
