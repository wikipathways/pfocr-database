caption: 'Schematic showing the relevant components of C4 biochemistry and the theoretical
  impacts of light fluctuations on C4 and C3cycle coordination. A, A simplified diagram
  shows two types of C4 pathways, NADP-ME and NAD-ME. The PEP-CK pathway is absent.
  B, A high to low light transition results in a transient overpumping of CO2 into
  and subsequent CO2 leakage out of the bundle sheath. C, A low to high light transition
  results in higher rates of Rubisco oxygenation. The relative substrate size represents
  the concentration gradient between the mesophyll and bundle sheath cells based on
  measured data (see text). Metabolites are black, enzymes are blue, and cofactors
  are gray. Terms are abbreviated as follows: oxaloacetate (OA), malate (M), pyruvate
  (Pyr), PEP carboxylase (PEPC), NADP-malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH), Asp aminotransferase
  (AspAT), NAD malic enzyme (NAD-ME), Ala aminotransferase (AlaAT), and Pyr phosphate
  dikinase (PPDK).'
