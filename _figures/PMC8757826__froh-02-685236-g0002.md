caption: Mechanisms involved in CSC-induced drug resistance in HNSCC. EGF binds to
  the EGFR receptor tyrosine kinase resulting in activation and autophosphorylation
  of the receptor. This activates RAS and PI3K, triggering major signaling cascades
  that include MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT. NOTCH-activated NICD1, upregulates the SIRT2/ALDH1A
  pathway. Hedgehog ligands (Hh) bind to Patched receptors and derepress the G-protein-coupled
  receptor (GPCR) SMO. Hh targets ALDH+ CSCs through GLI1 expression, which is regulated
  by ALDH1A1. WNT proteins bind to the Fz transmembrane receptor and the LRP 5/6 to
  form a functional complex. β-catenin then becomes uncoupled from the degradation
  complex and translocates to the nucleus to promote transcription of downstream targets.
  TGF-β is recognized by TβR1/2 resulting in the phosphorylation of SMAD 2/3 and formation
  of a SMAD 2/3/4 complex. These pathways are involved in regulating multiple biological
  functions of CSCs, including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, self-renewal
  and survival. EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor;
