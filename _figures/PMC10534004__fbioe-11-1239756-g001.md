caption: Schematic portraying the enzymatic and spontaneous reactions for biosynthesis
  of eumelanin starting from L-tyrosine as a substrate and intermediates along the
  biosynthetic pathway. The conversion of DOPA to dopaquinone can be either enzymatic
  via a tyrosinase (i.e. Tyr1 or MelA) or can occur spontaneously in the presence
  of oxidants [O] such as molecular oxygen. All enzymatic steps along the pathway
  require molecular oxygen (O2) for the initial oxidation reactions. DOPA–3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine;
  DHICA–5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid.
