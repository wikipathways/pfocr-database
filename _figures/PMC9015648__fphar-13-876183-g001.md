caption: Interaction of DOX with propolis extract, which led to enhanced cell apoptosis,
  sensitized anti-cancer activity, and reduced multi-organ toxicity based on preclinical
  evidence. Black arrows represent the action of DOX, whereas red arrows represent
  the action of propolis. In the cancer cells, propolis was reported to induce the
  MEK1/2-ERK-mediated apoptotic pathway, which caused the cell cycle arrest in the
  S phase and strengthened the induced cell death from DOX. Propolis also inhibited
  the P-gp efflux pump, which increased the intracellular concentration of DOX. This
  action reduced the chemoresistance of cancer cells to DOX. On the contrary, the
  improved anti-oxidant status from propolis by scavenging ROS and increased production
  of anti-oxidant enzymes protected multi-organs in the body against the toxicity
  from DOX.
