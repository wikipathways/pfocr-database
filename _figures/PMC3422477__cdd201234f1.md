caption: Apoptosis affects cell signaling pathways that control lipid synthesis and
  energy metabolism. The enzymes involved in de novo lipid synthesis are depicted
  as well as the signaling pathways that regulate them. Lipids are synthesized from
  citrate, which is transported into the cytosol following synthesis in the mitochondria
  by condensation of acetyl-CoA with oxaloacetate. Glucose is the principal origin
  of citrate carbon, although other metabolites can also be used as carbon donors.
  Lipid synthesis also requires NADPH, which originates from the pentose phosphate
  pathway and from the reaction catalyzed by malic enzyme. Pictures of the mitochondrion
  and cell membrane were obtained from Servier Medical Art (www.servier.com). ACC1,
