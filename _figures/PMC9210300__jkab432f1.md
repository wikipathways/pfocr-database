caption: Diagram of the TorC1 regulatory pathway as it is generally viewed and Whi2
  participation as reported (). It is important to emphasize that “active” or “inactive,”
  as used in the figure, indicates overall activity. The designations may not apply
  to other functions or conditions that the depicted regulatory proteins may also
  be executing. For example, Sit4 functions both when TorC1 is highly active as well
  as inactive, i.e., when complexed with Tap42 or not associated with Tap42; Sit4
  and PP2A are both required along with Ure2 to maintain Gln3 in the cytoplasm in
  nitrogen-rich medium; TorC1 is rarely if ever fully inactive; Ego–Gtr complex components
  are required for nuclear Gln3 ().
