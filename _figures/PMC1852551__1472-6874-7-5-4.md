caption: Multiple estrogen-regulated steps in the metabolisms of prostaglandin J2
  and retinoic acid are implicated in estrogen-dependent growth of human uterine fibroids.
  Prostaglandin synthesis pathway was taken from the KEGG pathway database and simplified.
  Retinoic acid metabolic pathway was compiled based on previous work [51], [29]and
  [55]. E2 stands for 17 β-estradiol, PGH2 for prostaglandin H2, PGD2 for prostaglandin
  D2, PGJ2 for prostaglandin J2, RA for retinoic acid, RAR for RA receptor, RXR for
  retinoid × receptor, PPAR for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. Five human
  and rat ortholog and estrogen-regulated genes (NR4A1, ANXA1, L-PGDS, ALDH1A1 and
  CRABP2) are in bold font. NR4A1 is nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member
  1, which is also called NGFI-B (neuronal growth factor-induced clone B) in rat,
  Nur77 in mouse and TR3 in human. Its roles in cell proliferation and apoptosis summarized
  in the figure were largely taken from Cao et al [36] and references therein. ANXA1
  stands for annexin A1, L-PGDS for lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase, ALDH1A1
  and ALDH1A2 for aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A1 and member A2 respectively,
  CRABP2 for cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2, COX1 and COX2 for cyclooxygenase
  1 and 2, eRolDH for epithelial retinal dehydrogenase [63].
