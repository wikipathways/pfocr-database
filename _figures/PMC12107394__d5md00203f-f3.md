caption: The impact of CFTR on NF-κB is manifesting in two distinct ways. Firstly,
  CFTR interacts with β-catenin in small intestine or esophagus, stabilising it and
  thereby inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. In the absence or damage of CFTR protein,
  there is degradation of β-catenin and translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus (A).
  Secondly, the cftr protein interacts with TRADD, resulting in its subsequent degradation.
  Absent this interaction, TRADD activates the NF-κB pathway (B)
