caption: The model illustrates that the fate of Leishmania parasites depend on the
  availability of extracellular L-arginine. If L-arginine is available, it is taken
  up from the external medium by cationic L-arginine transporters (y+) and metabolized
  by arginase (AS) and other polyamine biosynthetic and thiol metabolic pathway enzymes
  such as γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), spermidine
  synthase (SpdS), trypanothione synthetase (TryS), trypanothione reductase (TR),
  tryparedoxin (TXN) to produce L-ornithine (Orn), putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd)
  and thiols such as trypanothione (TryP) which promotes parasite proliferation and
  cell growth. Whereas, if extracellular L-arginine is unavailable or deficient, cellular
  redox balance is altered characterized by increased NADP+/NADPH ratio, decreased
  antioxidant levels such as SOD activity and thiol content that led to increased
  ROS production. L-arginine unavailability also triggered the phenomenons like phosphatidyl
  serine externalization, increased lipid peroxidation and release of intracellular
  calcium. Calcium influx in turn causes mitochondrial membrane depolarization leading
  to release of cytochrome-c from mitochondrion and intracellular ROS generation that
  ultimately damages DNA and promotes an apoptosis-like cell death.
