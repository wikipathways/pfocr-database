caption: (A) A linear representation (left to right) of the core components of the
  C. elegans EGFR/Ras/MAPK pathway (black) and some negative regulators (red) of the
  pathway are shown above or below their presumptive targets. The mammalian homologs
  are shown in parenthesis below the C. elegans names. (B) The Anchor Cell (AC) in
  the gonad secretes a LIN-3 EGF signal (green) to the Vulva Precursor Cells (VPCs),
  P3.p-P8.p, most strongly activating LET-23 EGFR signaling in the closest VPC, P6.p,
  inducing the 1° vulva cell fate (green). Subsequently, ligands on P6.p activate
  LIN-12 Notch (N, blue) on the P5.p and P7.p cells inducing them to adopt the 2°
  vulva cell fate (yellow). P5.p, P6.p. and P7.p give rise to the 22 cells of the
  vulva, while P3.p, P4.p, and P8.p divide (P3.p only ∼50% of the time) and fuse with
  the surrounding hypodermis (Hyp). (C) A diagram representing the rab-7 W03C9.3 gene
  and the upstream gene W03C9.5. The genes are oriented with the 5′ end to the left
  and 3′ to the right with boxes representing the exons and intervening lines as introns
  and the 3′ UTR. The regions coding for the putative switch and nucleotide binding
  domains in the RAB-7 protein are shown in blue and red, respectively. The ok511
  deletion that removes the first three exons of rab-7 as well as the 3′ UTR of W03C9.5
  is marked with a bracket. The indicated lines represent the genomic clones used
  for RNAi feeding.
