caption: Schematic illustration of ZA-CaP bilayer coating Mg-Sr alloy regulating the
  cross-talk of osteoblast-osteoclast in the microenvironment of bone remodelling
  through OPG/RANKL/RANK signalling pathway. ZA and ions released from the Mg-Sr alloy
  could promote the secretion of OPG from osteoblasts, which competitively interrupt
  the RANK-RANKL system. Therefore, our surface modified Mg-Sr alloy could inhibit
  the osteoclasts differentiation from monocytes and osteoclast maturation, as well
  as be beneficial to osteogenesis.
