caption: Proposed Model of PI3Kα Resistance in SGK1-Expressing CellsPIK3CA-mutant
  breast tumors depend on the PI3K pathway, which mainly signals through AKT. AKT
  phosphorylates and inhibits FOXO3 and TSC2, promoting mTORC1 activity and tumor
  progression (left panel). In the presence of PI3Kα inhibitors, PIP3 levels in the
  plasma membrane are negligible and AKT cannot be activated. High SGK1 cells become
  resistant to PI3Kα inhibitors, as SGK1 is not fully inhibited in the presence of
  these therapies, supporting FOXO3 and TSC2 phosphorylation, which promotes mTORC1
  activity and tumor progression (middle panel). When SGK1 expressing cells are treated
  with PI3Kα and PDK1 inhibitors, both AKT and SGK1 are inhibited, inducing tumor
  regression as a result of FOXO3 activation and mTORC1 inhibition (right panel).
