caption: 'Canonical and noncanonical pyroptosis pathways. The canonical pyroptosis
  pathway requires the involvement of inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are multiprotein
  complexes assembled in response to external stimuli, such as hypoxia, injury, toxins,
  and pathogens. A typical inflammasome contains a pattern recognition receptor and
  a downstream adaptor such as apoptosis-associated speck-like (ASC) protein. Four
  main inflammasomes have been identified: NLR members NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain
  containing 1 (NLRP1); pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3); NOD-, LRR-, and caspase
  recruitment domain containing 4 (NLRC4); and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), a sensor
  for nucleic acids. Different inflammasomes receive different stimulatory signals.
  Activation of inflammasomes promotes maturation of procaspase-1 into caspase-1,
  which further cleaves immature prointerleukin- (pro-IL-) 1β and pro-IL-18 into mature
  IL-1β and IL-18. Caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD into N- and C-terminal components. The
  N-terminal domains bind to cell membranes to form oligomeric pores, causing lytic
  cell death. In the noncanonical pyroptosis pathway, caspase-11 and caspase-4/5 are
  involved and inflammasomes are not needed. The stimulatory signals mainly come from
  Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS activates caspase-11 (caspase-4/5
  in humans) directly and mature caspase-4/5/11 cleave GSDMD to trigger pyroptosis.
  Caspase-4/5/11 do not have the function to process pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into
  mature IL-1β and IL-18. However, inflammatory cytokines released in the noncanonical
  pyroptosis pathway have been observed, which indicates the probable interaction
  between the two pathways.'
