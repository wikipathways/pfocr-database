caption: Potential mechanism for the δOR-Cys27 variant-induced alteration in APP processing.
  APP can be processed via the nonamyloidogenic (I) or the amyloidogenic (II) pathway.
  γ-Secretase-induced intramembranous cleavage in the juxtanuclear late endosome/lysosome
  (LEL) compartment (III) is preceded by ectodomain shedding by α-secretase at the
  cell surface (I) or by β-secretase in the endosomal compartment (II). Agonist-mediated
  activation of δOR (IV) has previously been shown to enhance the amyloidogenic route
  by coendocytic targeting of β- and γ-secretases (), leading to the increased production
  of Aβ. Expression of the δOR-Cys27 variant (V), which displays enhanced constitutive
  internalization (), inhibits the trafficking of APP CTFs to LEL and causes APP C83
  accumulation in the dispersed MVB-like compartments (VI). The changed processing
  and targeting phenotype of APP in δOR-Cys27-expressing cells is identical to those
  caused by PKC inhibition or ectopic alkalization (), thus suggesting similar or
  common underlying molecular mechanisms. A long-term treatment with δOR-specific
  antagonists/inverse agonists (VII) or with a c-Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VIII)
  suppresses the accumulation of δOR-Cys27 variant-induced APP C83. This indicates
  that the constitutive agonist-independent internalization and/or related signaling
  of δOR-Cys27 results in the altered trafficking and processing of APP. In contrast,
  the δOR-Phe27 variant, which harbors a higher intrinsic stability at the cell surface
  (IX) (), does not induce a similar process. EE, early endosomes.
