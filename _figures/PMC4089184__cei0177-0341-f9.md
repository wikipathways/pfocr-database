caption: A schematic of the proposed function of miR-199a-5p in regulatory T cells
  (Treg). Deregulation of miR-199a-5p due possibly to the increased production of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads eventually to an over-expression of the transforming
  growth factor (TGF)-β/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling pathway, thus skewing
  the T cell response to T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells. As we found a positive
  correlation between miR-199a-5p expression and age, it is also possible that any
  of the aberrant ageing mechanisms in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
  may be involved in the deregulation of miR-199a-5p.
