caption: Putative C4pathway in Alloteropsis semialata. A C4cycle is suggested for
  A. semialata based on the transcript abundance of C4-related genes, and the literature
  (; ). Pathway components are colored per the differential expression analysis, with
  those in black being putatively sufficiently abundant in C3 ancestors, parts of
  the pathway in green those up-regulated during the transition to C3+C4, and parts
  in red those up-regulated during the transition from C3+C4 to C4. ALA-AT=alanine
  aminotransferase, ASP-AT=aspartate aminotransferase, CA=carbonic anhydrase, NADP-MDH=NADP
  malate dehydrogenase, NAD(P)-ME=NAD(P) malic enzyme, PCK=phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase,
  PEPC=phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, PEPP=phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase, PPDK=pyruvate
  orthophosphate dikinase, PCR=photosynthetic carbon reduction (Calvin–Benson cycle).
