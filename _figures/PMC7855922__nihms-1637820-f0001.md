caption: Ras activates its effectors and signaling pathways at the membrane. (A) Active
  PI3Kα and its associated kinases/phosphatases, Akt, PDK1, PTEN, assemble at and
  are confined to membrane regions enriched in signaling lipids. The figure portrays
  activation of oncogenic PI3Kα by RTK signaling and Ras where the driver mutations
  mimic physiological events, as proposed in the seminal paper of Roger Williams and
  his co-workers (), and the chain of events initiating at the plasma membrane down
  to the nucleus via the PI3K/Akt pathway. (B) The activation of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway
  mainly occurs in the cytoplasm away from the membrane. The dimerized Raf or monomeric
  Raf mutant (V600E) phosphorylates the downstream MEK and ERK for cell proliferation.

  description: Ras activates its effectors and signaling pathways at the membrane.
    (A) Active PI3Kα and its associated kinases/phosphatases, Akt, PDK1, PTEN, assemble
    at and are confined to membrane regions enriched in signaling lipids. The figure
    portrays activation of oncogenic PI3Kα by RTK signaling and Ras where the driver
    mutations mimic physiological events, as proposed in the seminal paper of Roger
    Williams and his co-workers (), and the chain of events initiating at the plasma
    membrane down to the nucleus via the PI3K/Akt pathway. (B) The activation of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
    pathway mainly occurs in the cytoplasm away from the membrane. The dimerized Raf
    or monomeric Raf mutant (V600E) phosphorylates the downstream MEK and ERK for
    cell proliferation.
