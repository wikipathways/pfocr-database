caption: 'Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes via CDKN2A, TP53, and SMAD4. 1: CDKN2A
  (cyclin-dependent 2K kinase inhibitor) is a tumor suppressor gene that is found
  to be mutated usually in PanIN-2 lesions. This gene encodes the p16 protein that
  binds to cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 (Cdk4/6), interrupting the cell cycle in the
  G1 phase. The inactivation of CDKN2A causes the functional deactivation of the p16
  protein and, consequently, increased cell proliferation, contributing to tumor formation
  and growth; 2: TP53 (tumor protein p53) is the tumor suppressor gene that activates
  target genes (p21, Bax, Apaf-1) in response to cell oxidative stress and DNA damage,
  participating in the control of cell growth and apoptosis through gene transcription.
  The inactivation of this gene causes dysregulation of the cell cycle and worsening
  of neoplastic lesions; 3: The SMAD4 (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4)
  is located on chromosome 18q and encodes the beta transcription factor (TGF-b) involved
  in the regulation of important cellular functions, such as tissue differentiation,
  cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Inactivation of SMAD4 results in the
  interruption of the normal cell cycle, contributing to tumor metastasis. From: Author.'
