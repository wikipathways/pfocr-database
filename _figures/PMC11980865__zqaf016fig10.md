caption: Proposed model for the ATP-dependent paracrine and autocrine regulation of
  proton secretion by clear cells (CCs) and principal cells (PCs), respectively. PCs
  constitutively secrete ATP into the lumen through the concerted interaction between
  cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), PANX-1, and pannexin
  1 (P2X7). Activation of P2X7 by luminal ATP further activates PANX-1, providing
  a positive feedback mechanism for ATP release. P2X7 is an ATP-gated receptor that
  induces the entry of Ca2+ from the luminal space into the cell. P2Y receptors were
  also identified in PCs. Upon activation with luminal ATP, these GPCR receptors induce
  the release of calcium from intracellular stores. In vivo luminal perfusion of the
  cauda epididymis with ATPγS, the nonhydrolyzable form of ATP, induced the internalization
  of NHE3 from the apical membrane of PCs, showing the autocrine regulation of PCs.
  In a previous study,22 we showed that PANX-1-dependent ATP secretion by PCs leads
  to the activation of P2X4 located on the apical membrane of CCs, followed by the
  apical membrane accumulation of the proton pump V-ATPase. Thus, a complex ATP local
  signaling pathway exists in the epididymis, for the autocrine and paracrine regulation
  of luminal acidification in the epididymis. The full arrows indicate the results
  obtained in the present or previous22,32 studies. The dashed arrows indicate proposed
  mechanisms of action

  description: Proposed model for the ATP-dependent paracrine and autocrine regulation
    of proton secretion by clear cells (CCs) and principal cells (PCs), respectively.
    PCs constitutively secrete ATP into the lumen through the concerted interaction
    between cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), PANX-1, and
    pannexin 1 (P2X7). Activation of P2X7 by luminal ATP further activates PANX-1,
    providing a positive feedback mechanism for ATP release. P2X7 is an ATP-gated
    receptor that induces the entry of Ca2+ from the luminal space into the cell.
    P2Y receptors were also identified in PCs. Upon activation with luminal ATP, these
    GPCR receptors induce the release of calcium from intracellular stores. In vivo
    luminal perfusion of the cauda epididymis with ATPγS, the nonhydrolyzable form
    of ATP, induced the internalization of NHE3 from the apical membrane of PCs, showing
    the autocrine regulation of PCs. In a previous study,22 we showed that PANX-1-dependent
    ATP secretion by PCs leads to the activation of P2X4 located on the apical membrane
    of CCs, followed by the apical membrane accumulation of the proton pump V-ATPase.
    Thus, a complex ATP local signaling pathway exists in the epididymis, for the
    autocrine and paracrine regulation of luminal acidification in the epididymis.
