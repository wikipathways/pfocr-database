caption: Dual Role of Autophagy in Periodontal Tissue under Periodontal Pathogen Infection
  and Diabetes Environment. On the one hand, (P) gingivalis is negatively regulated
  by PI3K/Akt/mTOR, which activates autophagy in HGFs to block pathogen invasion.
  On the other hand, it can modulate autophagy in HDPFs by regulating Beclin1, ATG12,
  and autophagy markers to evade immune surveillance, causing excessive inflammation.
  Additionally, after invading human GECs, (P) gingivalis binds to the DC-SIGN receptor
  on DCs via its Mfa1 fimbriae, activating the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway to suppress
  dendritic cell autophagy, promoting survival and spread of the bacteria within the
  cells. In the diabetic environment, hyperglycemia blocks the ALP through the ATP6VOC
  gene, facilitating bacterial survival and proliferation and intensifying periodontal
  inflammation. Red upward arrows denote upregulation, whereas red downward arrows
  indicate downregulation. Figure 3 was independently designed by the authors using
  Affinity Designer 2, with all elements created using native software features
