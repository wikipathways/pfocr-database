caption: A proposed mechanism for RSV against Aβ mediated impaired neurogenesis. The
  figure describes the possibilities of how Aβ induces aberrant Wnt activity resulting
  in apoptosis. 1) RSV treatment-mediated intracellular increase of SIRT1 activity
  may decrease the expression of Dkk1 protein levels thereby facilitating positive
  Wnt signaling. 2) Blocked on Wnt signaling at the extracellular level by Aβ can
  be surpassed by RSV-mediated SIRT1 enhancement at the level of activation of Dvl
  and disassociate the β-catenin destruction complex β-catenin phosphorylation, 3)
  Enhanced SIRT1 levels in vivo may directly deacetylate β-catenin thereby promoting
  its translocation into the nucleus independent of the ligand, 4) RSV mediated SIRT1
  activity might deacetylate GSK3β by which it may prevent the destruction of β-catenin.
  Overall, the action of SIRT1 on these key events that promote Wnt signaling to a
  positive cell cycle might enhance the neurogenic process in AD-like conditions thereby
  facilitating neural regeneration.
