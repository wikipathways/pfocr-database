caption: Progression of primary prostate adenocarcinoma to NEPC and EMT-navigated
  metastatic prostate cancer follows diverse differentiation spectra. Normal epithelial
  cells may undergo EMT via loss of basoapical polarity and creating a more irregularly
  shaped, mesenchymal phenotype. Tumor epithelial cells may, upon detaching from the
  ECM, also transdifferentiate to NEPC as a cellular response to ADT. Another pathway
  to the neuroendocrine phenotype is differentiation of cell with stem cell-like properties.
  In addition to the separate lineages, a potential connection and spectrum of differentiation
  between the two phenotypes within the microenvironment may have significant functional
  consequences on prostate tumor progression. ADT, androgen deprivation therapy; ECM,
  extracellular matrix; EMT, epithelial–mesenchymal transition; NEPC, neuroendocrine-prostate
  cancer; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; AR, androgen receptor; MEK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; AURKA, aurora kinase A; CRPC, castration-resistant prostate cancer.
