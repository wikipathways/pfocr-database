caption: 'Control of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly.Notes: Inflammasome formation requires
  coordinated NLRP3 priming and activation. PAMPs/DAMPs and cytokines prime NLRP3
  through rapid post-translational modifications (non-transcriptional priming) and
  then NF-κB-dependent transcriptional upregulation of NLRP3 and putative other factors
  (transcriptional priming). Activation signals are provided by various stress signals
  including change in plasma membrane permeability, lysosome rupture, and metabolic
  stress. Downstream signaling pathways rely on cytosolic K+ decrease. Increase in
  cytosolic Ca2+ and decrease in cAMP are also often observed. NLRP3 activation results
  in inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation.Abbreviations: PAMPs, pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns; DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns; TLR, Toll-like
  receptor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; MSU, monosodium urate; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; GSDMD, gasdermin-D; ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein
  containing a CARD domain.'
