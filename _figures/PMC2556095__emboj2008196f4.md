caption: TGFβ-related signalling pathway controlling Myc activity in keratinocytes.
  The IKKα–Smad2/3 axis induces Mad1 and Ovol 1 expression on TGFβ stimulation. These
  proteins may inhibit the activity and expression of Myc, inducing in turn keratinocyte
  cycle exit and differentiation. Interestingly, a TGFβ–Smad3/4 signalling pathway,
  which is not associated with IKKα, but functions in cooperation with E2F4/5 transcription
  factors, has also been shown to negatively control c-Myc expression in keratinocytes
  ().
