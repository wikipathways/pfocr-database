caption: (A) Investigation of kinetic resolution. (B) Outline of a possible pathway
  for photoinduced, copper-catalyzed C–N cross-couplings of alkyl halides (for the
  sake of simplicity, all copper complexes are illustrated as neutral species, and
  all processes are depicted as being irreversible; X may be serving as an inner-
  or an outer-sphere ligand). (C) Synthesis and structural characterization of (L*)2Cu(carbazolide)
  (thermal ellipsoids drawn at 50% probability and H atoms omitted for clarity). (D)
  Stoichiometric cross-coupling reaction with isolated (L*)2Cu(carbazolide).
