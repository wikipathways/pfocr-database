caption: The schematic representation of the lipid synthesis pathway of A. baylyi
  ADP1. The carbon fate in ADP1 cells is distributed to biomass (including phospholipids),
  carbon dioxide and storage compounds, such as wax esters and triacylglycerols. The
  gene deletions of the studied strains M1 (ACIAD3383, Δacr1), M2 (ACIAD3381, ΔpoxB),
  M3 (ACIAD3309), and M4 (ACIAD2837, ΔdgkA), hypothetically affect the pathway as
  mapped in the figure. The main substrates of WS/DGAT are shown in the figure.
