caption: UvrD and NusA associate with RNAP throughout transcription elongation. Upon
  induction of the DNA damage response the concentration of UvrD increases (, ) resulting
  in UvrD dimerization and activation of its helicase activity. With the help of NusA,
  UvrD pushes RNAP backwards without collapsing the transcription bubble possibly
  using its helicase activity to unwind the upstream edge of the bubble. As with the
  Mfd-dependent TCR pathway, UvrD-dependent TCR joins general NER at the damage verification
  step. However, transcription elongation can resume after UvrD-dependent TCR with
  the assistance of anti-backtracking factors.
