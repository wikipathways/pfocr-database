caption: A proposed model of signaling crosstalk for the BCR to induce CSR. Ag stimulation
  of BCR activates proximal signaling elements, Syk, BTK and PLCγ2, leading to transcription
  factor NF-kB1 activation. NF-κB1 p50/RelA complex is required for AID transcription.
  NF-κB1 p50/RelA also induces NF-kB2 p100 transcription. TRAF2/3 restrict BCR proximal
  signaling strength. TRAF2 and TRAF3 also block NIK activity. Thus, Syk/BTK/PLCγ2
  complex cannot signal to generate transcription factor NF-κB2 p52 that is required
  for AID expression. Removal of TRAF3 and/or TRAF2 leads to NIK accumulation, which
  activates IKKα pathway, resulting in NF-κB2 p100 being processed into active NF-κB2
  p52. NF-κB2 p52/RelB complex and NF-κB1 p50/RelA together with additional factors
  initiate AID transcription. AID protein initiates CSR by targeting Igh locus. During
  humoral immune responses, CD40, BAFF-R as well as cell surface and intracellular
  TLRs are activated by corresponding ligands, CD40L, BAFF or TLR ligand (TLR-L),
  respectively. TRAF3/TRAF2 are recruited to cell membrane where TRAF3 is degraded
  by CD40 and BAFF-R signaling or sequestrated by TLRs. As a consequence, NIK and
  NF-κB2 complex can be activated. NF-κB2 activation allows the BCR to induce CSR.
  Thus, the critical function of co-stimulatory signals is to degrade or sequestrate
  TRAF3 to permit NF-κB2-dependent BCR-induced CSR essential for in vivo antibody
  responses. It is worthy of note that TRAF3 restricts Syk, BTK and PLCγ2 hyper-activation
  upon Ag stimulation that may be especially important for maintaining autoreactive
  B-cell anergy.
