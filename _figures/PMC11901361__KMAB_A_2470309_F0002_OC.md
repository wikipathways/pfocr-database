caption: 'Proposed FRα-mediated endocytosis and signaling pathways in cells. GPI-anchored
  FRα is invaginated into caveolae vesicles and forms early-to-late endosomes, which
  undergo increasing acidification and subsequent fusion with lysosomes to release
  non-anchoring FRα and folate/drugs. Alternatively, the GPI-anchored FRα is recycled
  from late endosomes to cell membrane. Proposed signaling pathways associated with
  FRα are presented in ①-④. ①The GPI-specific phospholipase D cuts off the GPI anchor
  of FRα in lysosomes, resulting in the free FRα translocating into nucleus and acting
  as a transcription factor. ②FRα physically interacts with the Progesterone Receptor
  (PR) and the cellular proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (cSrc) in a trimeric
  complex. cSrc auto-phosphorylates to activate itself and promotes the phospho-activation
  of ERK. Activated ERK induces the transcription of TP53 to regulate cell cycle progression.
  ③Folate binding to FRα can induce the activation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway
  via the gp130 co-receptor, leading to cell proliferation. ④FRα may upregulate the
  expression of cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin to promote cell migration.
