caption: Schematic model of signaling pathways involved in the synergistic potentiation
  of COX‐2 expression. In the first stage (left), sts sensitizes the colon cancer
  cells to the effect of DC. Translocation of a PKC isozyme from the cytosol to the
  cell membrane is stimulated, and p38 is activated. The ERK pathway is predicted
  to act as an upstream factor of the p38 pathway. In the second stage (right), the
  DC‐mediated induction of COX‐2 expression is potentiated.
