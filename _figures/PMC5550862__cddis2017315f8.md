caption: Schematic diagram of the role of SDC-4 in the regulation of the integrin
  and FGF signaling pathways. (a) SDC-4 functions as a co-receptor of integrin and
  mediates cell adhesion. ECM proteins, such as fibronectin, have an RGD sequence
  that binds to integrin and heparin-binding domains that bind to the polysaccharide
  side-chains of SDC-4, activating FAK and promoting focal adhesion formation. (b)
  SDC-4 also serves as a co-receptor of bFGF. The binding of FGF to FGFR activates
  PP1/2A, which leads to Ser183 dephosphorylation in the SDC-4 cytoplasmic tail. This
  dephosphorylation increases the binding affinity of PIP2 to SDC-4 and activates
  PKCα. PKCα further activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. In addition, SDC-4 is required
  for the activation of ERK1/2, which also contributes to mTOR activation. Activation
  of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and ERK1/2 promotes the G1/S transition
