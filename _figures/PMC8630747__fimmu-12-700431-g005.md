caption: Schematic of immunometabolic changes in macrophages with deletion of Bmal1.
  Glucose metabolism is increased in macrophages with deletion of Bmal1 which potentiates
  expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. In the absence of Bmal1 in macrophages,
  increased expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 leads to increased glucose
  uptake and higher glycolytic pathway activity. Increased dimerization of the glycolytic
  enzyme PKM2 facilitates its translocation to the nucleus where it phosphorylates
  STAT3 to drive IL-1β expression. In the mitochondria, flux of pyruvate through pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (PDH) and oxygen consumption is increased alongside increased Krebs
  cycle flux which fuels accumulation of the intermediate succinate. Activity of the
  electron transport chain complex succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is also increased
  in Bmal1 -/- macrophages which produces heightened levels of ROS which stabilizes
  HIF-1α to also promote IL-1β expression. Therefore, BMAL1 is regulating glucose
  metabolism in macrophages to impact upon the expression of IL-1β.
