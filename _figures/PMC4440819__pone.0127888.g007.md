caption: (A) TGF-β1-induced Smad2/3 signaling is essential for EMT from RLE cells
  to myofibroblasts expressing αSMA, collagen 1, and fibronectin. TGF-β1-induced Ras
  activity is weak, and intrinsic DA-Raf is sufficient to suppress the ERK pathway
  by binding to activated Ras. (B) FGF2 stimulation (as well as FGF1 or HGF stimulation)
  or overexpression of the constitutively active Ras, Raf, or MEK intensifies the
  activity of the Ras—ERK pathway activated by TGF-β1. Intrinsic DA-Raf is not sufficient
  to overcome the strong Ras—ERK pathway activity. Activated ERK might interfere with
  the nuclear translocation of Smad2/3, which is required to induce EMT.
