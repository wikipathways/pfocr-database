caption: Upon microbial infection, pattern recognition receptors (TLRs and RLRs) recognize
  pathogen products to trigger downstream signaling pathways to induce IFN-I and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. TLR3 recognizes double stranded RNA (dsRNA), TLR4 recognizes bacterial
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS), RIG-I recognizes single stranded RNA (ssRNA), MDA5 recognizes
  dsRNA and DDX41 recognizes double stranded DNA (dsDNA). In the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway,
  TRIM25 ubiquitinates RIGI for binding to MAVS. TRIM44 stabilizes MAVS. TRIM21 can
  act as both a positive and negative regulator of IFNβ. TRIM27 inhibits NF-κB and
  IFN activation mediated by IKKα/β/ε. TRIM30 degrades TAB2-TAB3 to inhibit production
  of IL-6 and TNFα. TRIM23 enhances NEMO function by promoting K63-linked ubiquitination.
  TRIM21 is involved in the inhibition of IKKβ and IRF7 and positive or negative regulation
  of IRF3 and IRF8. TRIM32 and TRIM56 ubiquitinate STING to promote dsDNA signaling.
  TRIM56 also positively regulates TRIF-mediated signaling whereas TRIM38 inhibits
  it. TRIM21 negatively regulates IFN production upon dsDNA signaling by ubiquitinating
  and targeting DDX41 for degradation. TRIM21 and TRIM28 inhibit IRF7 activation.
  TRIM5α catalyzes the synthesis of unanchored K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains that
  bind and activate TAK1 kinase. TRIM21 acts as an antibody receptor bound to viruses
  to activate TAK1. TRIMs in green and red represent positive and negative regulatory
  functions, respectively.
