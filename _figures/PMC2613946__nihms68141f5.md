caption: Schematic overview showing the membrane oestrogen receptor (mER) -mediated
  modulation of neurotransmitter regulated, G protein-coupled receptors in arcuate
  (POMC) neurones. Black colours are used to summarize the results of the current
  experiments. The cellular cascade activated by oestrogen (see Qiu et al., 2003)
  is shown in grey. Oestrogen activates a membrane-associated ER that is Gαq/11 -coupled
  to activation of phospholipase C that catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane-bound
  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3)
  and diacylglycerol (DAG). Calcium is released from intracellular stores (endoplasmic
  reticulum) by IP3, and DAG activates protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ). Through phosphorylation,
  adenylyl cyclase (ACVII) activity is upregulated by PKCδ. The generation of cAMP
  activates PKA, which can rapidly uncouple GABAB and μ-opioid (μ) receptors from
  their effector system through phosphorylation of a downstream effector molecule
  (e.g. the inwardly rectifying K+ channel, or GIRK). Tibolone (or 3βOH-tibolone)
  binds to mER and activates a different signalling pathway that involves PLC stimulation
  by Gα subunits of the Gαq/11 family and receptor-mediated hydrolysis of plasma membrane
  PIP2 (PIP2 depletion) that leads to inhibition of GIRK activity. Therefore, tibolone
  (or 3βOH-tibolone) through the mER intracellular signalling pathway dis-inhibit
  arcuate (POMC) neurones regulating the homeostasis.
