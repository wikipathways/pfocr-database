caption: The JNK pathway during homeostasis of the Drosophila gut. Damage or bacterial
  infection in the Drosophila midgut causes JNK activation in enterocytes (ECs). JNK
  induces expression of Ets21c, which then induces the secretion of inflammatory cues
  and mitogens such as IL-6 and EGFs. In cases of severe or chronic damage, JNK/Ets21c
  activity also induces apoptosis of the EC. Enteroblasts (EBs) activate JNK upon
  stress. This leads to the production of Hh, which acts in an autocrine manner to
  induce IL-6 production in EBs. In intestinal stem cells (ISCs), IL-6 and EGFs are
  received and integrated by the JAK/STAT and Ras/ERK pathways, respectively, to induce
  stem cell proliferation. Autonomous JNK pathway activation in ISCs upregulates its
  effectors Ets21c and Sox21a, which promote proliferation. In addition, JNK signaling
  induces symmetric divisions in ISCs by reorientating the mitotic spindle through
  its effector Wdr62 and by transcriptionally inhibiting Kif1a.
