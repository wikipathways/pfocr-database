caption: Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated activation of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. ROS, either produced endogenously or induced by extracellular stimuli,
  promote the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex (IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ). Activated
  IKK phosphorylates IκB, the inhibitory subunit of the cytoplasmic NF-κB complex
  (p50/p65 or p50/c-Rel). ROS has also been shown to activate NF-κB through alternative
  IκB phosphorylation. Phosphorylated IκB undergoes ubiquitination and subsequent
  proteasomal degradation, liberating the NF-κB dimer. The released NF-κB translocates
  into the nucleus, where it binds DNA and activates the transcription of pro-inflammatory
  and immune response genes. ROS also modulate the DNA binding of NF-κB and amplify
  transcriptional activity, creating a feed-forward loop in inflammation. Created
