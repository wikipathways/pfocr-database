caption: TNF-α–primed neutrophils extravasate from blood vessels, translocate PR3/NE
  to the cellular surface, and discharge PGRN to the pericellular environment (i).
  During transmigration of interstitial tissues (ii), neutrophil activation is initially
  suppressed by relatively high pericellular levels of antiinflammatory PGRN (green
  shading), which is also produced locally by keratinocytes and epithelial cells of
  the skin. Until IC depots are reached, neutrophil activation is inhibited by PGRN.
  Surface receptors (e.g., Mac-1) recognize ICs, which results in signal transduction
  (black dotted arrow) and activation of the phox. The molecular pathway of PGRN-mediated
  inhibition is not completely understood, but it may interfere with integrin signaling
  after IC encounter (green dotted line inside the cell). Adherence of neutrophils
  to ICs (iii) further increases pericellular PR3 and NE activity. PR3 and NE cooperatively
  degrade PGRN in the early stage of neutrophilic activation to facilitate optimal
  neutrophil activation (red shading), resulting in sustained integrin signaling (red
  arrow) and robust production of ROS by the phox system. Subsequently, neutrophils
  release ROS together with other proinflammatory mediators and chemotactic agents,
  thereby enhancing the recruitment of further neutrophils and establishing inflammation
  (iv). In the absence of PR3/NE, the switch from inflammation-suppressing (ii) to
  inflammation-enhancing (iii) conditions is substantially delayed, resulting in diminished
  inflammation in response to ICs (iv).
