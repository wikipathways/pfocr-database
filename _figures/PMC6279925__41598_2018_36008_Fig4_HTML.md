caption: Network visualization of top primary hits. (a) Network visualization of top
  positive regulator hits from screen A identifies one main cluster connected by multiple
  protein-protein interactions as well as several unconnected hits. Gene names are
  shown as node titles. Node size reflects enhanced Z-score values. Edges represent
  known protein-protein interactions (Cytoscape/Bisogenet) and interactions with one
  additional interactor are shown (see Methods for details). (a,c) Network as in a,
  highlighting genes (orange nodes) that belong to Reactome pathway categories related
  to synapse-to-nucleus signalling (b, refers to Fig. , see Supplementary Table )
  or those referenced in PubMed with MeSH terms related to neuronal signalling (see
  Methods for details on PubMed query) (c).
