caption: A In mammals, apoptotic effector caspase-3 cleaves of NF-κB members p65/Rel
  A, RelB, and c-Rel resulting in a comprehensive repression of both NF-κB signaling
  pathways, which is proposed to act as a self-protective mechanism to prevent overreactive
  innate immune responses. B In Drosophila, apoptosis mediates the proteolysis of
  DIF, the NF-κB of Toll pathway, resulting in the repression of Toll immune signaling,
  dependently of the effector caspases drICE and DCP-1.
