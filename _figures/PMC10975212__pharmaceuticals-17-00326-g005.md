caption: Non-SMAD, non-canonical TGF-β pathways. (A) ERK/MAP kinase pathway. TGF-β
  activates the ERK/MAP kinase pathway by direct phosphorylation of ShcA, which subsequently
  activates downstream signals. In conjugation with SMADs, Erk regulates target gene
  expression and EMT via the downstream TFs (transcription factors). (B) JNK and p38
  MAP kinase pathway. The Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6)
  and TGF-β complexes interact after activation of the receptors. TRAF6 is then induced
  by an autoubiquitylation and subsequently stimulates TAKI through polyubiquitylation.
  This event can lead to activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. (C) The MAP kinase
  pathway via TRAF4 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 4). TRAF4 is
  auto-ubiquitylated upon ligand binding and is recruited to the TGF-β receptor complex.
  (D) JAK/STAT (the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription)
  pathway. Phosphorylation and activation of STAT is initiated by JAK, which interacts
  with TGF-β receptor type I. (E) PI3/AKT/mTOR pathway. TRAF6 polyubiquitylates the
  regulatory subunits of PI3K, p85α. Then, a complex is formed between the TGF-β receptor
  type I and p85α, resulting in activation of PI3K and AKT. Phosphorylation of AKT
  prevents SMAD3-mediated signaling. (F) TGF-β type I receptor intracellular domain
  signaling. The interaction of TRF6 and TGF-β receptor I results in polyubiquitination
  of TGF-β receptor I at Lys63 and subsequent degradation by TNF-alpha converting
  enzyme (TACE). TACE is not shown here. The newly formed intracellular domain (ICD)
  of TGFβ receptor I, named TGFβRI ICD, associates with the transcriptional factor
  to activate genes. (G) Rho-like GTPase pathway. Activation of Rho GTPase is promoted
  by both SMAD and non-SMAD-mediated signaling. After stimulation, Rho-like proteins
  Cdc2 and Rac1 are activated, which drive actin reorganization through signals from
  PAK2. This figure has been adapted from Tzavlaki and Moustakas, 2020 [43]
