caption: In well‐oxygenated cells, the Embden–Meyerhof pathway (EMP) reactions convert
  glucose (Glc) to pyruvate (Pyr), which is converted to acetyl‐CoA (AcCoA) by pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (PDH) for entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, in which
  AcCoA is oxidized to CO2 + H2O and reducing equivalents are generated (NADH and
  FADH2) for donation to the electron transport chain (complex I and complex II, respectively).
  Proton (H+) pumping during electron transport generates an electrochemical gradient
  that is used to synthesize ATP (complex V) with O2 serving as the ultimate electron
  acceptor (complex IV). Premature transfer of electrons to O2 (at complex I or complex
  III) results in the formation of superoxide anion. Under hypoxic conditions, superoxide
  production at complex III increases, leading to the hypoxia‐inducible factor 1 activation
  and increased expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), which converts pyruvate
  to lactate (Lac), and PDH kinase 1 (PDK1), which inhibits the conversion of pyruvate
  to AcCoA, leading to decreased flux through the TCA cycle and decreased mitochondrial
  ROS production. CoQ, coenzyme Q (ubiquinone); Cyt c, cytochrome c; IMM, inner mitochondrial
  membrane; IMS, intermembrane space; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane.
