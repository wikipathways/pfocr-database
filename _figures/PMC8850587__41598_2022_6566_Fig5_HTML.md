caption: Expression analysis of nodulation signaling pathway components in response
  to different strains of R. etli. The scheme displays the main components of the
  nodulation signaling pathway triggered by rhizobia inoculation in root cells and
  their subcellular localization. The Log2 fold change (FC) of those genes that were
  identified as DEGs is shown as a heat map. Squares on the upper and bottom rows
  show the expression pattern in NAG12 and Alubia, respectively. From left to right
  R. etli strains are SC15 and CE3 (nodC-α), 55N1 and 24N1 (nodC-δ). The asterisk
  (*) indicates that the transcript levels in R. etli inoculated roots were significantly
  different from those treated with YEM with a p value < 0.05. EPR3 (Phvul.002G059500),
