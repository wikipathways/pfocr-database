caption: Early sporulation factors experimentally determined to function as positive
  regulators of Spo0A are highlighted in green, while those that inhibit Spo0A are
  highlighted in red (, , , , , , , , ). Hexagons indicate histidine kinase/phosphatases;
  rounded rectangles demarcate transcription factors; and circles highlight sigma
  factors. Red lines indicate negative regulation, and black lines indicate positive
  regulation. SinR and SinR’, C. difficile orthologs for regulatory proteins characterized
  in B. subtilis (grey), were recently shown to promote sporulation (). Solid lines
  indicate defined regulatory interactions, and dashed lines suggest proposed, and
  potentially indirect, regulatory effects. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are
  a CodY cofactor (), and their precursors are likely imported primarily through the
  Opp and App oligopeptide transporters (, ). CcpA-independent carbon-specific regulation
  is not shown (). The reciprocal transcriptional regulation of early sporulation
  factors by Spo0A has also been omitted for simplicity ().
