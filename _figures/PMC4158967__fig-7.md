caption: Model of the influence of mitochondrially derived malate on tomato fruit
  starch, soluble sugar content, post-harvest shelf life, and bacterial infection.

  Mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH) lines [(A); increased malate]; fumarase
  lines [(B); decreased malate]. The same ripening and postharvest sequence is presented
  for both transgenic sets. (i) Alterations in mitochondrial redox status are transmitted,
  either within the same cell type or from adjacent tissues, to the plastid via the

  () is currently unknown. (iii) This leads to redox-mediated alterations in pigment
  biosynthesis during ripening. (iv) Starch is rapidly broken down, leading to a decreased
  soluble solid content in red-ripe fruit in the MDH lines and an increased soluble
  solid content in the fumarase lines. (v) Potentially as a result of differences
  in cellular osmolarity, the transgenic sets oppositely display an increased water
  loss and wrinkling (MDH lines) or a decreased water loss and wrinkling (fumarase
