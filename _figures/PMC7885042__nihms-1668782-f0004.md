caption: 'A: For OPCs, overactivation of AMPA receptors has been associated with glutamate-mediated
  excitotoxic injury; more specifically, a pathway involving the sodium-potassium-chloride
  co-transporter 1 (NKCC1) and the reverse mode of NCX activity has recently been
  described to lead to calcium overload and OPC injury upon prolonged AMPA receptor
  activation []. B: For differentiating OLGs a protective role of NCX3 activity is
  emerging in the context of ischemic-hypoxic injury and oxidative stress; possible
  beneficial effects of both forward (left) [] and reverse mode activity have been
  proposed [, ].'
