caption: The Notch signaling pathway during myogenic progression and self-renewal.
  A Basic scheme of the Notch signaling pathway in murine muscle cells. The receptor
  is more highly expressed on the stem/progenitor cell (signal receiving cell), whereas
  the DLL ligands on the committed myoblasts and the mature myofibers (signal sending
  cells). Ligand-receptor interaction triggers intramembrane proteolysis and release
  of the intracellular domain of Notch (NICD). NICD then translocates into the nucleus
  where it forms a complex with its main downstream effector and DNA binding transcription
  factor RBPJ, and members of the coactivator Mastermind-like (MAML) family. The triprotein
  NICD transcriptional complex recruits additional coactivators and histone modifiers
  to activate transcription, not illustrated here for simplicity. B During MuSC activation
  and myogenic commitment, Notch signaling activity is downregulated. Quiescent MuSCs
  have high Notch activity (dark blue in color key), which maintains Pax7 and inhibits
  Myod and Myogenin expression. Immediately after MuSC activation, Notch activity
  rapidly declines and the cells express MYOD, which accelerates S-phase entry. During
  the proliferation phase, high Notch activity is restricted to some cells, which
  remain undifferentiated and self-renew to replenish the satellite cell pool (dotted
  arrow). Notch activation is principally triggered by ligand-bearing differentiating
  myoblasts (block arrow indicates direction of Notch signaling). Mature myofibers,
  in which Notch activity is insignificant (green color in color key), are the main
  source of ligand in the resting muscle and maintain MuSC quiescence by direct cell-cell
  interaction (block arrow)
