caption: Metabolic determinants of cell fitness in competition.A. Protein synthesis
  capacity. Winner cells display increased protein synthesis rates compared to loser
  cells. This may be due to increased Myc expression or higher mTOR pathway activity
  in winner cells, or to ribosomal protein mutations in loser cells.B. Glycolytic
  Flux. Winner cells display increased glycolytic flux relative to loser cells. This
  may be driven by transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes by transcription
  factors such as Myc and p53. Glucose availability in the microenvironment may also
  affect glycolysis, with winner cells displaying increased uptake of glucose.C. Mitochondria
  Function. Loser cells may display impaired mitochondria function, resulting in decreased
  mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), ATP production and mitophagy. Reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) production may also be elevated in loser cells with impaired mitochondrial
  function.
