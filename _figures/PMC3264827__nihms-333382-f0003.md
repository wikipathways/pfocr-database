caption: The illustration of the effects of mitochondrial ROS induced by NADH on the
  INa. A proposed signaling pathway by which mutant GPD1-L and NADH downregulate Nav1.5
  by causing PKC activation and ROS overproduction from the mitochondrial ETC. ROS
  are released from the mitochondria by the IMAC, which is modulated by the mitochondrial
  benzodiazepine receptor. NAD+ inhibits mitochondrial ROS overproduction through
  PKA activation followed by the upregulation of Nav1.5. (Modified from reference
  [])
