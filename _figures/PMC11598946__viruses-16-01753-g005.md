caption: 'Schematic representation of some of the respiratory syncytial virus’s immune-evading
  mechanisms. (A) NS2 interacts with the CARD domain of RIG-I; (B) NS1 binds to MAVS,
  the adaptor protein used by the RIG-I receptor on the signaling pathway. These interventions
  inhibit IRF3 activation, preventing downstream pathway events and hindering type
  I IFN production. (C) N protein is involved in sequestering the P65 subunit of NFκB
  into intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, leading to decreased translocation to the
  nucleus; (D) The SH protein interferes with pro-inflammatory cytokines’ production
  through the NFκB pathway. (E) Interference with IRF3 and NFκB pathways modulates
  the function of DCs and may suppress their maturation, resulting in decreased IL-12,
  which is essential for CD8 T-cell differentiation and viral clearance, and increased
  IL-4, leading to poorly protective and potentially detrimental Th2-biased responses.
  (F) BRSV infection may induce Th17 differentiation, contributing to neutrophil accumulation,
  NETosis, and oxidative stress, which are thought to enhance pathology. (G) BRSV-secreted
  G protein (sG) acts as a decoy antigen, sequestering antibodies away from the actual
  virion. Abbreviations: BRSV = bovine respiratory syncytial virus; dsRNA = double-stranded
  RNA; ssRNA = single-stranded RNA; TLR-3 and TLR-4 = toll-like receptor 3 and 4;
  TRIF = toll interleukin 1 receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing
  interferon-beta; IRF3 = interferon regulatory factor 3; NFκB = nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B-cells; IL-4 and IL-12 = interleukin 4 and 12 F protein = fusion protein;
  SH = small hydrophobic protein; NS1 and 2 = nonstructural proteins 1 and 2; G =
  major attachment glycoprotein; N = nucleoprotein; MyD88 = myeloid differentiation
  primary-response 88; MAVS = mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein; NOD2 = nucleotide
  oligomerization domain 2; RIG-I = retinoic acid-inducible gene I; MDA-5 = melanoma
  differentiation-associated protein 5; Th1, Th2 and Th17 = T helper cells 1, 2 and
  17; IFNs = interferons. Figure created using BioRender (BioRender.com/e06u568)'
