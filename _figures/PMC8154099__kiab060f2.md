caption: Oxygen and nitrogen reactive species metabolism in peroxisomes. A, Principal
  peroxisomal metabolic pathways associated with peroxisomal ROS and NO production.
  ROS are produced in metabolic pathways such as β-oxidation, photorespiration, ureides
  metabolism, and polyamine oxidation, and in a small electron transport chain associated
  with the membrane (peroxisomal membrane proteins, PMP18 and PMP29; ). NO is produced
  in peroxisomes by NOS-like (NOS-l) activity, although other sources, such as XOR,
  polyamine oxidation, and IBA metabolism, could also be involved. ROS, NO, and other
  RNS may leak out of the peroxisome (dashed arrows) and act as signal molecules that
  regulate cell metabolism and gene expression. B, Scheme of peroxisomal antioxidant
  defenses, RNS scavengers, and NAD(P)H supply. O2.− is regulated by SODs, while H2O2
  is controlled by CAT, the ASC-GSH cycle, and GPx. Peroxynitrite (ONOO−) and GSNO
  are produced in peroxisomes by reaction of NO with O2.− and glutathione (GSH), respectively.
  GSNO can negatively regulate MDHAR and CAT through S-nitrosylation and nitration,
  and SOD may be regulated by nitration. SOD may indirectly control ONOO− by regulating
  O2.− levels. Uric acid acts as an ONOO− scavenger. NAD(P)H is supplied by the oxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway (G6PD; 6PGD), ICDH, MDH, and NUDIX19. 6PGD, 6 phosphogluconate
