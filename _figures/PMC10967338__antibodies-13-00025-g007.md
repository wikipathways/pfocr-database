caption: TGF-β canonical intracellular pathways and single-domain vNAR T1 coupled
  to TGF-β1. In the canonical pathway, TGF-β1 employs two serine/threonine kinase
  receptors to trigger messenger proteins (SMADs), followed by the activation of TGF-β
  target genes, which is essential to the onset and progression of GBM. As depicted
  in the example, TGF-β1 (green) is neutralized by recognition of vNAR T1 (blue) from
  [172], further hampering TGF-β1 binding to TβI/TβRII receptors. The amino acid sequence
  of vNAR T1 that recognizes the human TGF-β1 cytokine is depicted in red
