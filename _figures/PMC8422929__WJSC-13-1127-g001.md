caption: 'Molecular factors that regulate the stemness of liver cancer stem cells.
  The factors that regulate liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) include the pluripotency
  transcription factor (pTF) network, in which pTFs affect the expression of one another
  to promote the development of LCSCs, the WNT signaling pathway, which is often activated
  by gene mutations, the IL6/STAT3 pathway, which can also be stimulated by hepatitis
  B virus or hepatitis C virus, the tumor-suppressive HIPPO pathway, the NOTCH signaling
  pathway, and hepatocyte growth factor and its downstream MAPK signaling pathway.
  Specific microRNAs such as miRNA-130b and miRNA-142-3p, and lncRNAs such as HOTAIR
  and MALAT1 can also promote the stemness of LCSCs. pTF: Pluripotency transcription
  factor; IL: Interleukin; HBV: Hepatitis B virus; HCV: Hepatitis C virus; YAP: Yes-associated
  protein; TEAD: TEA domain; iNOS: Inducible nitric oxide synthase; HGF: Hepatocyte
  growth factor.'
