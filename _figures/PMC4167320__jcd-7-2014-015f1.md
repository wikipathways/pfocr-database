caption: Overview of the extrinsic, intrinsic, and phagocytosis-induced apoptotic
  pathways. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by ligation and clustering of plasma
  membrane death receptors leading to activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. The intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway is initiated when the relative abundance of the proapoptotic Bcl-2
  family members (Bax and Bak) exceeds that of their anti-apoptotic counterparts (Mcl-1
  and A1), which allows Bax and Bak to oligomerize and form pores in the outer mitochondrial
  membrane. Release of cytochrome C into the cytosol is an essential signal for activation
  of caspase-9 upstream of caspase-3. The PICD pathway is driven by particle uptake
  and NADPH oxidase-derived ROS. Leakage of cathepsins from damaged azurophilic granules
  leads to death receptor-independent activation of caspase-8. In addition, cathepsin-driven
  activation of Bid and degradation of Mcl-1 favor mitochondrial disruption and intrinsic
  pathway activation. Additional details are provided in the text.
