caption: Main signaling pathways disregulated in HNC at the genomic or transcriptional
  level. Black arrow-ended lines indicate activation and red bar-ended lines indicate
  inhibition. RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK (A, B) and PIK3–AKT–mTOR (C) signaling pathways are
  involved in promoting cell survival and proliferation (D), antagonistically to the
  WNT pathway (E), in which AXN1/2 blocks beta-catenin activity. By enhancing JAK/STAT
  signaling (F), VEGF proteins (G), the main angiogenic molecules, are activated.
  Alternatively, VEGF expression is also modulated by hypoxia-induced factor 1A (H).
  Frequently reported in HNCs, angiogenesis builds the vasculature through which the
  tumors are supplied with oxygen and allows their progression and a worse prognosis.
  On the other hand, the NOTCH signalling pathway is involved in cell growth and evasion
  of apoptosis (I). Very important in the control of tumour processes in head and
  neck cancers is the Hippo pathway (J), which, when activated, phosphorylates YAP/TAZ,
  causing its intracytoplasmic sequestration and degradation, preventing its translocation
  to the nucleus and activation of TEAD. TEAD activation leads to cell proliferation.
