caption: 'Schematic illustration of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), its
  role in glycosaminoglycan synthesis and potential therapeutic targeting. In the
  present study, the HBP is targeted in different ways: (1) glucosamine derivatives
  (N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or glucosamine sulfate (GS)) were added at different
  concentrations to enhance the bioavailability of the substrate for uridine diphosphate
  GlcNAc (UDP-GlcNAc) generation; (2) the rate-limiting enzyme, glutamine fructose-6-phosphate
  amidotransferase (GFAT1), was inhibited by means of Azaserine, while hydrolysis
  of O-GlcNAc residues (de-glycosylation) was suppressed using PUGNAc, a specific
  inhibitor of OGA. GalNAc = N-Acetylgalactosamine, OGA = N-acetylglucosaminidase,
  OGT = O-GlcNAc transferase, PUGNAc = O-(2-acetamido-2deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate.'
