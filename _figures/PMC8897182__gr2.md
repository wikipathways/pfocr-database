caption: LDLR Regulates Oxidized LDL Level and LRP1 Preserves Vascular Homeostasis(A)
  Illustration outlining the publications to date on LDLR functions in pulmonary arterial
  hypertension (PAH). In PAH, LDLR expression is reduced, affecting the LDL homeostasis
  and leading to accumulation of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in the circulation and lungs.
  The impaired LDLR pathway and oxLDL induce the release of proinflammatory markers
  by endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) followed by monocyte infiltration
  and differentiation into macrophages as well as SMC proliferation. Altogether, this
  creates an inflammatory environment and vascular remodeling. (B) Illustration outlining
  the publications to date on LRP1 function in pulmonary artery SMCs during PAH and
  pathways suspected to occur in pulmonary vasculature. Under normal conditions, LRP1
  dampens the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 pathway by direct interaction with
  TGF-β receptor 1 (TGFBRI) in pulmonary artery SMCs and inhibits the differentiation
  of lung fibroblasts to a contractile phenotype. In PAH, LRP1 expression is reduced,
  disturbing the TGF-β1 balance and thus promoting proinflammatory and profibrotic
  genes such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). In fibroblasts, loss of LRP1
  results in acquisition of a contractile phenotype and integrin- and protease-dependent
  release of active transforming growth factor TGF-β1 from the extracellular matrix
  (ECM) stores. Pioglitazone treatment (a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  gamma [PPARγ] agonist) in smLRP1–/– mice reverses PAH caused by LRP1 deficiency,
  restoring an inhibition on TGF-β1 signaling. Other pathways known in non-PAH context
  remain to be investigated in the pulmonary vasculature, such as LRP1 interaction
  with platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), tumor necrosis factor receptor
  (TNFR), or bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR). Abbreviations as in .
