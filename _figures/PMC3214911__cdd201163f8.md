caption: Molecular mechanisms involved in the suppression of ER stress-induced apoptosis
  by 3′-deoxyadenosine. (a) 3DA suppresses the IRE–JNK pro-apoptotic UPR at the proximal
  site. On the other hand, 3DA triggers phosphorylation of eIF2α and enhances ER stress-induced
  activation of eIF2α, resulting in translational suppression and consequent attenuation
  of ER stress. 3DA also suppresses induction of ATF4 and GADD34, leading to sustained
  activation of eIF2α. Although 3DA causes sustained phosphorylation of eIF2α, it
  does not induce and rather suppresses induction of the ATF4–CHOP pro-apoptotic pathway.
  3DA may attenuate ER stress via transcriptional suppression that targets particular
  mRNAs. (b) 3DA is transported into the cells through adenosine transporters and
  causes early phosphorylation of eIF2α. 3DA suppresses expression of ATF4 and downstream
  GADD34 and CHOP by its intracellular action (major action) and extracellular action
  via the adenosine A3 receptor (minor action). These effects allow for sustained
  phosphorylation of eIF2α and blunted expression of pro-apoptotic genes, leading
  to attenuation of apoptosis
