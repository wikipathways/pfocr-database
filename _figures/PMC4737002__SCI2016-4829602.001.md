caption: Regulation of interconnected stem cell signaling nodes by the AR. Activation
  of the AR negatively regulates the core pluripotency transcription factors (Nanog,
  Sox2, and Oct4) as well as signaling cascades that reinforce a robust stem cell
  state. The AR (1) acts as a transcriptional repressor at the Nanog and Sox2 promoters;
  (2) inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling through induction of PHLPP, which dephosphorylates
  Akt to facilitate ERK pathway activation leading to Nanog gene repression, as well
  as GSK3-mediated c-myc and β-catenin repression; and (3) blocks STAT3-mediated transcription
  of stem cell-associated genes by inhibiting IL-6. Suppression of the AR by factors
  in the stem cell niche, such as CCL5, relieves this inhibition to favor self-renewal
  and pluripotency over differentiation. AR, androgen receptor; β-CAT, β-catenin;
  CCL5, chemokine ligand 5; IL-6, interleukin-6; JAK, Janus kinase; PHLPP, PH domain
  and leucine rich protein phosphatase; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.
