caption: 'Molecular regulation of autophagy. The autophagy pathway progresses through
  a series of sequential steps: (A) Initiation (formation of the isolation membrane)
  (upper panel). Growth factors or nutrient signals stimulate mTORC1, whereas starvation,
  ROS, or hyperoxia inhibit mTORC1 activity. mTORC1 inhibition leads to activation
  of ULK1. ULK1 resides in a macromolecular complex containing various regulatory
  proteins: FIP200, ATG13, and ATG101. Formation of the isolation membrane requires
  the Beclin 1 macromolecular complex, which includes VPS34/PIK3C3, p150/Vps15, and
  ATG14L. ULK1 positively regulates autophagy by activating Beclin1 via phosphorylation
  of Beclin1 or ATG14L. UVRAG can exchange for ATG14L. AMBRA-1 positively whereas
  BCL2 negatively regulates the Beclin1 complex. Bif-1 acts as a positive whereas
  Rubicon acts as a negative regulator of Beclin1–UVRAG complex. VPS34 activity generates
  PI3P, which promotes the formation of the isolation membrane. ATG9 also facilitates
  lipid recruitment to the nascent autophagosome membrane. (B) Elongation and maturation
  of the phagophore to form autophagosomes (lower panel). PI3P recruits regulatory
  proteins, including DFCP1 and WIPI, to the phagophore. The elongation of the phagophore
  involves two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems: (i) ATG5–ATG12 conjugation system.
  ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 by ATG7 (E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme-like) and Atg10
  (E2 ubiquitin-conjugase-like) enzymes. ATG5–ATG12 complex associates with Atg16L1
  with the assistance of VAMP7. (ii) LC3/ATG8 conjugation system, ATG4B endopeptidase
  cleaves pro-LC3 to generate LC3B-I. Conjugation of PE with LC3-I is catalyzed by
  Atg7 (E1-like) and Atg3 (E2-like) activities. Both conjugation systems are involved
  in autophagosome formation. Rab7 in its GTP bound form also regulates the maturation
  of autophagosome. The HOPS-tethering complex that includes VPS33A and VPS16 promotes
  autophagosome–lysosome fusion through interaction with the autophagosomal Qa-SNARE,
  syntaxin-17 (STX-17). STX-17 is localized on the outer membrane of the mature autophagosome,
  interacts with ATG14L and SNAP29. The SNARE complex involved in autophagosome–lysosome
  fusion is composed of STX-17, SNAP29, and VAMP8. LAMP-2A helps in recruitment of
  STX-17. The fusion results in cargo degradation by lysosomal acid hydrolases and
  recycling of nutrients through lysosomal efflux permeases. AMBRA-1, autophagy/Beclin
