caption: Representative metabolic pathway maps of significantly altered metabolites
  during proliferation and differentiation. Key metabolites related to (A) Pantothenate
  and CoA biosynthesis and Arginine and Proline metabolism that display significant
  alteration during proliferation and (B) Glutathione metabolism, (C) Tryptophan metabolism
  during differentiation. Colored boxes represent identified metabolites. Images were
  modified from map00770 and map00220 respectively for (A), map00480 for (B), and
  map00380 for (C) from the KEGG database (https://www.kegg.jp).
