caption: MDM phagosome network identified in (A) HIV-1-infected and (B) HIV-1-infected
  with URMC-099 and nanoATV treated cells. Proteins identified were compared against
  uninfected MDM cultures (p<0.05). The acquired profiles were analyzed through the
  bioinformatics tools DAVID and KEGG Pathway. Statistical significance was determined
  using a p-value <0.05. Proteins in red and blue, display up- and down- regulation,
  respectively. Proteins in green belong to the phagosome network and not deregulated
  by ATV treatment. URMC-099 deregulates phagosomal protein expressions in human MDM.
  The proteomics data were based on experiments conducted from 4 donor MDMs. MDM were
  treated with 100μM nanoATV for 16 hours with 0, 1, 10 or 100 ng/mL URMC-099. HIV-1ADA
  infection was performed at (C) day 0 or (D) day 5 after drug treatment. Cell lysates
  were collected on day 7 following infection. Expression of Rab5, Rab7, STAT1, and
  LAMP1 were determined by Western blot in URMC-099/nanoATV treated MDM. Results are
  from a representative experiment. Western blots were performed in duplicates from
  2 donor MDMs.
