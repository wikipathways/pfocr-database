caption: The proposed pathway for constitutive AhR signaling and crosstalk with Src.
  (1) Binding of various exogenous and endogenous ligands to the cytoplasmic AhR or
  deletion of the ligand binding domain stimulates translocation to the nucleus where
  the AhR/ARNT heterodimer forms. The AhR-ARNT dimer binds to a cognate xenobiotic
  response element (XRE) to induce transcription of genes important in a wide range
  of biological processes. (2). AhR forms aprotein complex with Src and regulates
  Src activity by phosphorylating Src at Tyr416 and dephosphorylating Src at Tyr527.
  (3) Phosphorylation of AR protein by non-receptor tyrosine kinases Src.
