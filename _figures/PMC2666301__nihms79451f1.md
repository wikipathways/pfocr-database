caption: 'Schematic representation of interactions between injury and endogenous repair
  processes. Vascular injury generates a Th1-type inflammatory response that triggers
  recruitment of cells (“detrimental” progenitors, in red) leading to tissue damage.
  Concurrently, cells that can mediate repair and renewal of the endothelium (“reparative”
  progenitors, in green) are mobilized reflecting endogenous repair. This reparative
  pathway is mediated by Th2-type cytokines. Ultimately, the availability and functional
  capacity of these “reparative” progenitor cell populations declines, Th1-type inflammatory
  response predominates and tissue damage is perpetuated leading to lesion progression.
  See text for a complete discussion. Abbreviations: Th, T-helper.'
