caption: PPI and the co-regulatory network of SLC7A11. (A) SLC7A11-interaction proteins
  in COAD tissue. The network consists of 11 nodes and 23 edges, the red nodes are
  involved in the ferroptosis signaling pathway. (B) TF-miRNA co-regulatory network.
  The network consists of 270 nodes and 397 edges. The nodes in red color are the
  co-expression genes, the blue nodes represent miRNA, the green nodes represent TFs,
  and the yellow nodes represent protein.
