caption: Summary of the pathways that mediate cellular Cu metabolism. Extracellular
  Cu2+ is reduced by the reductase STEAP to Cu+, which is transported into the cell
  by the Cu transporter CTR1, where it is delivered to cytosolic Cu chaperones such
  as CCS and SOD1 and then delivered to specific subcellular compartments such as
  the mitochondria, TGN, and nucleus. In the mitochondria, Cu is involved in the respiratory
  chain and redox pathways via binding to CCO. In the mitochondrial intermembrane
  space, COX17 binds to and delivers Cu to either SCO1 or COX11, which transfers Cu
  to the cytochrome oxidase subunit. In the nucleus, Cu can bind to transcription
  factors and drive gene expression. Finally, in the TGN the Cu+-ATPase transporters
  ATP7A and ATP7B transfer Cu from the cytosol to the TGN lumen, where it activates
  Cu-dependent enzymes in the secretory pathway. When cytosolic Cu levels are high,
  ATP7A and ATP7B exit the TGN and facilitate Cu export. Created with BioRender. ATOX1,
  antioxidant 1 copper chaperone; ATP7A and ATP7B, ATPase copper transporter 7A and
  7B, respectively; CCO, cytochrome c oxidase; CCS, copper chaperone for superoxide
  dismutase; COX17 cytochrome c oxidase copper chaperone 17, COX11 cytochrome c oxidase
  copper chaperone 11, SCO1 synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 1, SOD1 superoxide dismutase
