caption: Synthesis of the phenylalanine and tyrosine from the intermediate chorismate.
  Animals do not have complete pathways for the three AAA, which are anabolized de
  novo only by bacteria, other microorganisms and plants. The starting point for all
  three AAA is the shikimate pathway (not shown) which generates the common intermediate
  chorismate. The pathways on the left involving the bifunctional enzyme chorismate
  mutase/prephenate dehydratase (PheA or TyrA) and tyrosine aminotransferase (TyrB)
  are found in bacteria, while the ones on the right (via arogenate) occur in plants
  that use the enzymes prephenate aminotransferase, arogenate dehydrogenase and arogenate
  dehydratase.
