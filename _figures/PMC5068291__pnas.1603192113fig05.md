caption: Proposed model for the dual control of cueP by CueR and CpxR. Activation
  of the Cpx signaling pathway caused by a stressor other than copper will recruit
  the RNA polymerase (RNA Pol) to the promoter region of cueP. Nevertheless, transcription
  will not occur, because of the unfavorable spatial distribution of the −10 and −35
  promoter elements. Moreover, the sole activation of CueR by the presence of copper
  in the cytoplasm reorientates the −35 and −10 elements, but transcription is not
  initiated because the RNA polymerase does not recognize the promoter. Only the simultaneous
  activation of CpxR, by copper-induced periplasmic stress, and CueR, by cytoplasmic
  copper, will induce transcription of cueP. Further details are provided in the text.
