caption: (A) Protein interaction network generated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
  of the 576 probes differentially expressed between Proneural GBM and Proneural Oligodendrogliomas/Astrocytomas.
  Proteins marked in red are increased in Proneural GBM samples, and those in green
  are decreased, relative to Proneural low grade gliomas. Solid lines represent direct
  interactions, and dashed lines represent indirect interactions. All interactions
  are derived on the Ingenuity Knowledgebase, which is extracted from the PubMed literature.
  (B) Protein interaction network based on IPA analysis of 129 genes differentially
  expressed between PN-Oligodendrogliomas and Classic and Neural Oligodendrogliomas.
  Network hubs are readily discernible around the Notch receptor, Myc oncogene, and
  the GLI1 transcription factor.
