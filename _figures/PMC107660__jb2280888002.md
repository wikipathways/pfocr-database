caption: 'The ECA polysaccharide biosynthetic pathway and the wec gene cluster. (a)
  The ECA polysaccharide biosynthetic pathway. Gene names are listed in italics adjacent
  to the reactions that their products catalyze. The genes affected by the mutational
  analysis employed in this study are enclosed within rectangles. Abbreviations: C55-P,
  undecaprenyl monophosphate; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; ManNAcA, N-acetyl-d-mannosaminuronic
  acid; Fuc4NAc, 4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-d-galactose; Glc-1-P, glucose-1-phosphate;
  PPi, pyrophosphate; TDP-Glc, TDP-glucose; TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-Glc, TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose;
  α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; TDP-FucN, TDP-fucosamine; acetyl-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A;
  Co-ASH, coenzyme A; ManNAc, N-acetyl mannose. (b) The wec gene cluster. The open
  reading frames of this cluster are shown in shaded boxes. All open reading frames
  are transcribed from 5′ to 3′ as shown. The positions of the insertions described
  in this study are also depicted. A 13,000-bp scale is depicted below the gene cluster
  for reference.'
