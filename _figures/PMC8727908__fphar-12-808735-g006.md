caption: BRD4’s dynamically regulated gene networks. Schematic diagram of BRD4 dependent
  genes in RSV infection. Although BRD4 is required for innate signaling and expression
  of ECM remodeling proteins, this study provides evidence that BRD4 controls is own
  expression through an autoregulatory network. In addition, BRD4 controls expression
  of members of its interacting coactivators that bind the BD, including transcription
  factors, adaptors and chromatin remodeling complexes. Reproduced with permission
