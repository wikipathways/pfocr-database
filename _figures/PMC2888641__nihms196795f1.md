caption: A schematic of Hh pathway signal transduction derived from developmental
  and cancer models. (A) In the absence of Hh ligand, Ptch is located in the cilium
  and blocks Smo entry. Gli transcription factors exist in repressor forms that prevent
  transcription of target genes. (B) Three mammalian homologues of Hh (SHh, IHh, DHh)
  bind Ptch at the cell surface and allow it to move out of the primary cilium. Smo
  is derepressed and moves into the primary cilium where it can activate Gli transcription
  factors. During this process, the Gli transcription factors are processed to activator
  forms and translocated to the nucleus to induce the transcription of Hh target genes.
  Antibodies against the Hh ligands (5E1) and robotnikinin block pathway activation
  by preventing the interaction of Hh ligand with Ptch. Cyclopamine and novel antagonists
  of Smo directly bind and inhibit its function. Compounds such as HPI 2,3,4 block
  the transport of components in the signaling cascade. Direct Gli antagonists such
  as GANT block binding of Gli transcription factors to DNA.
