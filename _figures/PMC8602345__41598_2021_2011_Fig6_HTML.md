caption: Model of FHR-1-induced inflammation. Extracellular vesicles that transport
  FHR-1 (EVFHR1) bind to oxLDL in necrotic cores of atherosclerotic plaques and activate
  neutrophils and monocytes. These monocytes and neutrophils release inflammatory
  cytokines, which attract more immune cells. FHR-1 also induces monocytes to express
  tissue factor on their surfaces, which can trigger the coagulation pathway and thrombosis,
  the ultimate complication of atherosclerosis.
