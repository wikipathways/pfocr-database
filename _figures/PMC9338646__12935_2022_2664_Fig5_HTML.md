caption: New types of therapy. A Microparticle MP can deliver NAMPT inhibitor GMX1778
  to glioma cells in A directional manner and control its release amount to resist
  tumor by up-regulating PD-L1 expression, inhibiting m2-type macrophage generation,
  and collecting CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. B Encapsulation of exosomes protects siRNA
  from degradation, and modification of E3 aptamer can be directed to prostate cancer
  cells, and siRNA plays an anti-tumor role by silencing SIRT-6. C After the hybrid
  nanoparticles of silicon carbide (LSC) coated by lipid membrane enter the cell,
  LCS directionally binds to mitochondria and generates ROS under infrared light.
  ROS oxidizes NADH to NAD + and reduces ATP production, inhibiting p-glycoprotein
  (P-GP) from excreting chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cell, thus improving tumor
  drug resistance
