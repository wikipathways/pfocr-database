caption: In normal conditions with a balanced RAS, renin cleaves angiotensinogen to
  produce Ang I, and then Ang I is cleaved by ACE1 to Ang II. The combination of Ang
  II and AT1R activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, modulates the gene expression
  of inflammatory cytokines, and induces harmful effects such as fibrosis, inflammation
  and tissue damage. ACE2 induces the cleavage of Ang II into Ang 1-7. Subsequently,
  Ang 1-7 activates MAS-R and induces anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis effects.
  SARS-CoV-2 identifies ACE2 as a receptor to invade host cells. The endocytosis of
  the virus reduces the expression of ACE2 on the cell membrane, thereby impairing
  the protective effect of the ACE2/Ang 1-7/MAS-R axis. Accumulated Ang II leads to
  the excessive activation of AT1R, induces the release of a variety of inflammatory
  cytokines, and even causes a cytokine storm. SARS-CoV-2 can also invade immune cells
  (CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells) by binding with ACE2, causing immune response dysregulation.
  The intensified cytokine storm and immune response dysregulation may have indirect
  impacts on multi‐organ failure, especially the kidneys. AKI, acute kidney injury;
  SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; ACE2, angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2; RAS, renin-angiotensin system; Ang II, angiotensin II; AT1R, angiotensin
  receptor type 1; MAS-R, MAS receptor.
