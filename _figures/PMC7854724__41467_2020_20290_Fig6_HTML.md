caption: Prior to fusion, myocytes originating from the DML (in orange) express the
  ligand TGFB3, the effectors SMAD 3, & 4 and the receptor TGFBR1. They are competent
  to fuse. Myoblasts originating from the posterior or anterior borders of the somite
  (in blue) express TGFBR2. Upon fusion of myoblasts to DML-derived myocytes, membrane
  merging of the fusion partners allow the activation of the TGFβ pathway by a receptor
  heterodimer complementation mechanism (in purple), ultimately leading to a temporary
  inhibition of fusion of another myoblast. The process of fusion is likely reinitiated
  after RAB-mediated receptor degradation.
