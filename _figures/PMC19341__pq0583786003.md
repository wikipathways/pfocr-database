caption: Schematic drawing showing the relationship of PKA and hh pathways on CI proteolysis
  and activity. (A) In a cell that is not stimulated by the hh signaling pathway,
  PKA phosphorylates cytoplasmic CI. The phospho-CI is a target for proteolysis and
  the 75-kDa protein enters the nucleus and represses the CI target genes, perhaps
  blocking the recruitment of dCBP to the promoter. (B) In a cell that receives the
  hh signal, the phosphorylation of CI by PKA in the cytoplasm is inhibited and CI
  is not proteolysed to the 75-kDa repressor. This allows the active form of CI to
  enter the nucleus, recruit dCBP to the promoter, and activate the CI target genes.
  The CI activation of transcription is potentiated by PKA.
