caption: 'Protein synthesis pathway of HLA-C. Transcription of HLA-C is regulated
  through various transcription factors in the promoter region. Once the HLA-C mRNA
  is translated, the generated polypeptide undergoes proper folding, assembly and
  peptide loading. Translation of the HLA-C mRNA is regulated by micro-RNA-148 (miR148),
  which binds to the 3’ untranslated region. The assembly of the HLA-C heavy α-chain
  with β2m and a peptide is facilitated by a multi-subunit complex, composed of Cnx
  (calnexin), TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing), Tpn (type I transmembrane
  glycoprotein tapasin), the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 and Crt (calreticulin). The
  HLA complex is loaded with high-affinity peptides that are generated by proteasome-mediated
  protein degradation in the cytosol. Peptides are transported into the ER and loaded
  onto the peptide binding grove. After peptide loading, the mature HLA-C:peptide
  complex dissociates from the multiprotein complex and is transported to the Golgi
  apparatus and then to the cell surface. Only HLA-C molecules with high-affinity
  peptides are transported to the cell surface to present the peptide to immune cells:
