caption: Xanthine oxidase in the context of purine metabolism. Schematic representation
  of human purine metabolic pathways, culminating in the production of uric acid.
  Purine nucleotides are synthesized by alternative pathways, each requiring the key
  regulatory intermediate 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), which is synthesized
  from ATP and ribose-5-P in a reaction catalyzed by PRPP synthetase. The pathway
  of purine synthesis de novo involves a sequence of 10 reactions by means of which
  a purine ring is synthesized on a ribose-phosphate backbone donated by PRPP. The
  first reaction in the pathway is the rate-limiting step and is catalyzed by the
  enzyme amidophopshoribosyltransferase (AmidoPRT). The subsequent 9 reactions in
  the de novo pathway are represented by the dashed arrow. The alternative pathways
  of purine nucleotide synthesis are single step processes by which preformed purine
  bases (adenine, Ade; hypoxanthine (Hyp); guanine, Gua) are salvaged in reactions
  catalyzed by the phosphoribosyltransferase (PRT) enzymes adeninePRT (APRT) and hypoxanthine-guanine
  (HPRT), respectively. Regulation of nucleotide synthesis is effected mainly at the
  AmidoPRT step, by means of antagonistic allosteric regulation of the activity of
  AmidoPRT by inhibitory (-) purine nucleotide products and PRPP activation. Purine
  nucleotide products also inhibit PRPP synthetase activity. Purine nucleotides and
  nucleosides are readily interconverted by means of an extensive and complex series
  of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that provide the cellular requirements for balanced
  availability of adenine and guanine nucleotides and nucleosides. Phosphorolysis
  of the nucleosides inosine and guanosine result in production of Hyp and Gua, which
  are either salvaged (in the HPRT reaction) or are ultimately and irreversibly oxidized
  through the base xanthine (Xan) to the end product, uric acid, in reactions catalyzed
  by xanthine oxidase.
