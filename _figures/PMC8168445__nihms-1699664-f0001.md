caption: A) Cartoon showing astrocytes and microglia surrounding a parenchymal amyloid
  deposit. Both cell types respond to amyloid (and other extracellular factors) with
  morphologic and biochemical changes including the release of numerous cytokines,
  chemokines, and other inflammatory factors which can maintain and/or propagate glial
  reactivity. Neuroinflammatory processes resulting from chronic glial activation
  can have many deleterious (and sometimes beneficial) effects on neurons. B) Inflammatory
  factors trigger astrocyte reactivity through a number of transcriptional pathways
  involving NFκB, MAPK, Jak/Stat, and/or FOXO3. Concurrent Ca2+signaling and/or Ca2+
  dysregulation leads to the activation of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway, which further
  shapes astrocyte reactivity through extensive interactions with other transcription
  factors and second/third messenger systems. These pathways, in turn, regulate the
  production of numerous cytokines and chemokines involved in triggering and maintaining
  glial reactivity.
