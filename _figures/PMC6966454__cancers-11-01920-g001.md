caption: Proposed set of events underlying the mechanism of apoptosis induction in
  selective plasma cancer treatment. Before plasma treatment, catalase prevents formation
  of •OH in the extracellular matrix (ECM) from the HOCl and the ONOO‒pathway. In
  the HOCl pathway, this occurs through decomposition of H2O2 and in the ONOO‒pathway
  it precedes through decomposition of ONOO‒. During plasma treatment, catalase is
  inactivated by 1O2 that is either contained in the plasma or generated in the ECM
  from components transferred from the plasma. After plasma treatment, the cancer
  cell’s protection against the HOCl and the ONOO‒pathway is lost and •OH is formed
  in the ECM. Through lipid peroxidation in the cell membrane, •OH is causing apoptosis
  induction.
