caption: Schematic illustrating the function and mechanism of GC cells-derived exo-miR-15b-3p
  in recipient cells. The exo-miR-15b-3p released by GC cells promotes the proliferation,
  migration, invasion and inhibits apoptosis of recipient cells via the DYNLT1/Caspase-3/Caspase-9
  signaling pathway, thereby promoting tumorigenesis and malignant transformation.
  Serum exo-miR-15b-3p may function as a potential GC diagnostic biomarker

  through the DYNLT1/Caspase-3/Caspase-9 signaling pathway in gastric cancer.
