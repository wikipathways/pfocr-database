caption: 'Site of action and biotransformation of DCA. Panel A: The pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex (PDC) irreversibly oxidizes pyruvate to acetyl CoA, thereby linking cytoplasmic
  glycolysis to the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.
  Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) reversibly inhibits PDC activity by phosphorylation,
  whereas, pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) restores PDC activity via dephosphorylation.
  DCA inhibits PDK, thereby maintaining PDC in its catalytically active form. Panel
  B: DCA is dehalogenated by GSTZ1 to glyoxylate, upon which the xenobiotic enters
  the general carbon pool of the host. The same enzyme, as MAAI, catalyzes the penultimate
  step in the phenylalanine/tyrosine catabolic pathway, isomerizing maleylacetoacetate
  and maleylacetone to fumarylacetoacetate and fumarylacetone, respectively.'
