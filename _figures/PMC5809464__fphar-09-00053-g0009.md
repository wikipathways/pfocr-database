caption: Lipid metabolic pathway analysis of identified differential lipid species.
  (A) Summary of IPA with MetPA including glycerophospholipid metabolism, arachidonic
  acid metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid metabolism,
  α-linolenic acid metabolism, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis
  from significantly different lipid species. The size and color of each circle is
  based on pathway impact values and p-values, respectively. (B) Overview of glycerophospholipid
  metabolism with MetPA (reference map by KEGG). Green boxes represent enzymatic activities
  with putative cases of analogous activities in rats. (C) Lipid metabolic networks
  were constructed by using Wikipathways, Signalink, SMPDB, Reactome, PhosphoSitePlus,
  NetPath and MatrixDB. Adenine-induced CKD were associated with glycerophospholipid
  metabolism, triacylglycerol degradation, fatty acid activity, arachidonic acid metabolism
  and metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins.
