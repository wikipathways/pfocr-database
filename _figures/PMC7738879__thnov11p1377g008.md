caption: 'Model of AA-regulated signal transduction pathways. An AA-triggered Ca2+-
  ASK1 - p38 pathway induces a transcriptional stress response and mediates HSP27
  phosphorylation, thereby contributing to actin filament reorganization in concert
  with AA-regulated RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs. Other protein kinases phosphorylated in response
  to AA, such MAP4K2, may also impinge on this pathway. ROS produced by different
  mechanisms may contribute to p38 phosphorylation to a minor extent in a subset of
  donors. Orange: phosphosites identified by MS and confirmed by immunoblotting; yellow:
  phosphosites identified by MS. EX: extracellular space; PM: plasma membrane; CYT:
  cytosol; NUC: nucleus. AA is most likely derived from extracellular phospholipids
  with PLA2G2A possibly playing a crucial role (see text and Table ).'
