caption: 'Network analysis of TBP-associated factors. STRING analysis shows that the
  TBP-associated factors are involved in the known and predicted protein–protein interactions.
  Network analysis exhibited that many TBP-associated factors directly interact with
  TP53. The network nodes are proteins. The edges represent the predicted functional
  associations with 7 differently colored lines representing the existence of the
  seven types of evidence used in predicting the associations. Red line: the presence
  of fusion evidence; green line: neighborhood evidence; blue line: cooccurrence evidence;
  purple line: experimental evidence; yellow line: textmining evidence; light blue
  line: database evidence; black line: co-expression evidence.'
