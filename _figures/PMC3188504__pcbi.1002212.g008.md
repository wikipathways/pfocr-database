caption: (A) Reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential by squamocin increases
  cytosolic calcium to activate protease to degrade OPA1, which is a regulatory protein
  for side-to-side inter-mitochondria fusion . Hence branched tubules are not recovered
  by Caspase inhibitors (see ). (B) Our previous data  show that squamocin induces
  nuclear apoptosis, i.e. chromatin condensation, can be rescued by Caspase 8 inhibitor.
  Squamocin may activate Caspase 8 to further inhibit OPA1 or activate Caspase 9 to
  induce fission and inhibit biogenesis. (C) Squamocin also causes oxidative stress
  to recruit Bax to mitochondria, which results in cytochrome c release. Previous
  investigations ,  proved that cytochrome c release can activate Caspase 9. Therefore,
  squamocin may also activate Caspase 9 via oxidative stress. (D) In this study, it
  is observed that percentages of small globules and tubules are negatively correlated
  (see ), providing further evidence that tubular mitochondria fragments into small
  globules. (E) Squamocin reduces expression of , which is an essential protein for
  mitochondria biogenesis , via Caspases 8 and 9, causing reduction of total mitochondria
  area of individual cells (see ). (F) Caspase 8 cleaves Bid, and cleaved Bid recruits
  Bax to mitochondria. Bax proteins form pores on mitochondrial outer membrane, and
  release cytochrome c and subsequently activate Caspase 9 .
