caption: The tryptophan-kynurenine pathway and major functional consequences in the
  context of GBM growth. It should be emphasized that this pathway may regulate, through
  inflammatory reactions, also other pro-oncogenic factors such as transforming growth
  factor ß and signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling (not described
  here).
