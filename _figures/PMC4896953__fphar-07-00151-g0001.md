caption: Sorafenib induces autophagy response through modulation of the main downstream
  factors and pathways. In this scheme, some of the mediators of autophagy induction
  by sorafenib in tumor cells are represented. Sorafenib may induce AMPK pathway because
  it reduces ATP levels and increases ROS, which leads to inhibition of mTORC1 signaling
  pathway. Sorafenib can also stimulate ER stress, specifically IRE-1α branch and
  all its downstream genes, and release calcium ion to cytosol, which induces autophagosome
  formation. It may also disrupt Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 complex, with Beclin-1 release.
  Other non-protein mediators which may be involved in sorafenib effects are miRNA30α
  and sphingolipids, because the drug can reduce miRNA30α signaling, which is a Beclin-1
  repressor, induce ceramide formation, and reduce S1P levels, leading to autophagosome
  formation.
