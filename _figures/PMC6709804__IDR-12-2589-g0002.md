caption: Mechanism of response mediated by M1, M2, and M4 macrophages. Macrophage
  differentiation spectrum includes markers that modulate development of certain phenotypes.
  Depending on the stimulus, cytokines, such as TNF-α and IFN-γ, may influence the
  process of shifting the M0 macrophage to M1. In this scenario, we highlight the
  performance of IFN-γ, GM-CSF, and TLR4 that influence development of intracellular
  cascade, which aims to produce of a series of markers to enhance the pro-inflammatory
  response in several aspects of classical pathway. In contrast, the antagonistic
  relationship between the duality of M1/M2 macrophages shows that IL-4 and IL-13
  cytokines are mainly responsible for inducing differentiation of macrophages from
  M0 to M2. In the alternative pathway, activation of IL-4Rα or IL-10R shows that
  IL-4, IL-13, or IL-10 directly modulate development of anti-inflammatory responses
  and tissue repair. Through pathways of polarization, we emphasized the significance
  of M4 macrophages in the modulation of oxidative stress response as well as tissue
  repair. This relationship is particularly important in pathophysiology of atherosclerosis,
  where formation of foam cells due to LDL accumulation and low phagocytosis implies
  a regulatory phenomenon that triggers the production of TNF-α, IL-6, MRP8, MMP7,
  and MMP12.
