caption: The subnetwork of functional interactions of ESRP-target networks. Circles
  represent genes of ESRP targets, while diamonds represent linker genes. FIs extracted
  from pathways are shown as solid lines, while predicted FIs based on the naïve Bayes
  classifier are shown as dashed lines. FIs involved in activation, expression regulation,
  or catalysis are shown with an arrowhead, while T bars indicate inhibition. (A)
  Detailed view of module 1, enriched for pathways related to cell-cell adhesion,
  including those for E-cadherin-based adherens junctions, tight junctions, and nectin-based
  adhesion components. (B) Detailed view of module 2, enriched for the Rho GTPase
  signaling pathway.
