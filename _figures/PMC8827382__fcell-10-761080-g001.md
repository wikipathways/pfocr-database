caption: Importance and regulation of tumor suppressor p53 pathway in the regulation
  of cancer. p53 protein plays an essential role in coordinating with a complex signaling
  network which regulate aberrant cell proliferation and growth. Normally, p53 has
  preserved at low steady-state levels with crucial regulation of two proteins, murine
  double minute 2 (MDM2) as well as MDMX. MDM2 mediates an attachment of ubiquitin
  (Ub)-mediated proteasomal degradation. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and ionizing
  radiation activate several kinases and damaging stressors. Oncogenes overexpression
  has been found to stimulate the production of alternative reading frame (ARF), p14ARF
  in human and p19ARF in mouse, which binds to MDM2 as well as stabilizes p53. Activation
  of p53 protein has been targeted to transactivate numerous gene expressions depending
  on the stressors and the cell type which significantly control either DNA repair,
  cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis, mitochondrion regulation, autophagy, and
  angiogenesis.
