caption: Regulation of survival pathways by mutant B-RAF. (A) Mutant B-RAF activation
  of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. B-RAF mutants, with elevated
  kinase activity, interact with the microenvironment to hyperactively phosphorylate
  MAP, which results in the phosphorylation downstream of the kinase MEK and the translocation
  of ERK into the nucleus. B-RAF mutants with lowered kinase activity regulate the
  MAPK pathway indirectly through C-RAF. Translocation of ERK to the nucleus via B-RAF/C-RAF
  signaling results in the expression of metalloproteinases and EMT. (B) Mutant B-RAF
  activation of the NF-κB pathway. The constitutively active mutant B-RAF activates
  the NF-κB pathway via IKKβ activation. Activation of NF-κB results in EMT via up-regulation
  of the metastasis inducer, Snail, as well as other metastatic gene products. NF-κB
  is inhibited directly through the metastasis suppressor, RKIP. RKIP also indirectly
  inhibits NF-κB through inhibition of B-RAF activity. (C) Up-regulation of mutant
  B-RAF via PTEN deletion, PI3K signaling, and AKT overexpression. RAS signaling results
  in PI3K activation and AKT expression. Normally, PI3K-induced expression of AKT
  is antagonized by PTEN. However, deletion of PTEN as well as signals from the microenvironment
  can result in uncontrolled AKT production. Higher levels of AKT expression inhibit
  mutant B-RAF signaling levels. Inhibition of B-RAF signaling by AKT counterintuitively
  promotes EMT. When mutant B-RAF signaling is extremely high, cellular defense mechanisms
  will induce the cells into senescence. AKT inhibition of B-RAF lowers B-RAF signaling
  to levels high enough to promote EMT and low enough to evade senescence.
