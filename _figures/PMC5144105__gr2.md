caption: 'Signal transduction pathways in cranial development. The figure schematically
  illustrates the central signal transduction cascades implicated in cranial suture
  development. Possible impairment of these pathways can lead to premature cranial
  fusion thus craniosynostosis. FGF signaling: FGFs (FGF4, FGF3) bind to FGF receptor
  Tyr kinases; FGFRs are phosphorylated hence activated and further activate intracellular
  substrates, which initiate downstream signaling pathways such as the RAS–MAPK pathway.
  The phosphorylated ERK1/2 translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with the
  transcription factor ERF, which is then exported from the nucleus. Within the nucleus
  ERF can bind to RUNX2 and repress RUNX2 expression. TWIST also represses RUNX2 by
  forming a heterodimer with TCF12. Mutations in FGFRs are associated with craniosynostosis
  syndromes, as over-expression of FGFRs triggers the constant expression of ERK1/2,
  thus RUNX2 expression is not abrogated and osteogenesis occurs. TGF-β signaling:
  TGF-β signaling is correlated with downstream ERK1/2. BMP signaling: BMPs bind to
  type I/II transmembrane receptors. Activated receptors initiate signaling by phosphorylating
  downstream targets Smad1, Smad5, Smad8 proteins, which interact with Smad4 which
  translocates into the nucleus. BMP over-expression leads to the expression of RUNX2,
  thus to cranial fusion. BMP signaling is regulated by the antagonist Noggin. Wnt
  signaling: The Wnts signal through the canonical β-catenin pathway. Wnts bind to
  FZD receptors and an accumulation of β-catenin is triggered. β-catenin translocates
  to the nucleus and binds to TCF/LEF transcription factors. Subsequent transcription
  of osteogenic markers follows. BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; BMPR, bone morphogenetic
  protein receptor; CK1, casein kinase 1; DVL, the scaffolding protein Disheveled;
  ERF, ETS domain-containing transcription factor; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1/2; FGF3 and FGF4, fibroblast growth factors 3,4; FGFR1/2/3, fibroblast
  growth factor receptors 1/2/3; FRAT1 proto-oncogene; FZD, Frizzled receptor; GSK3-β,
  glycogen synthase kinase 3; LRP5/6, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
  5/6; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MSX2, homeobox protein MSX-2;
  RUNX2, runt-related transcription factor 2; TCF12, transcription factor 12; ΤGF-β,
  transforming growth factor beta; TGFβR, transforming growth factor beta receptor;
  TCF/LEF, T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor; (TWIST), twist-related protein
