caption: Relationship between ROS production and cancer cell development. Initiation,
  the first step among three stages in cancer, maintains the homeostasis of ROS against
  imbalance of ROS and regulates protein kinases, which have diverse cellular functions.
  Promotion, the second step, is related to DNA damage and induction of mutations
  appearing in the cellular signaling pathway. Progression, the third step, appears
  to activate EMT-related genes and other intracellular signaling pathway markers.
  Therefore, the generation of ROS is crucial to the three developmental stages of
  cancer; initiation, promotion, and progression.
