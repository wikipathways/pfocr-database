caption: Proposed NOTCH signaling pathway effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection, modeled
  from . SARS-CoV-2 entry is mediated by the binding of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein
  to ACE2 and proteolytic cleavage at the S1/S2 site of the S glycoprotein by the
  host protease furin. ADAM17 regulates ACE2 levels on the plasma membrane by promoting
  ACE2 shedding. NOTCH signaling is a positive regulator of furin and a negative regulator
  of ADAM17 transcript, the latter due to induction of miRNA-145. GSIs are NOTCH inhibitors
  that may represent a possible therapeutic strategy to inhibit viral entry into cells
  by reducing furin and increasing ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding. NOTCH precursor
  is cleaved by furin in the Golgi apparatus to form a heterodimer of NOTCH extracellular
  domain (NECD), plus the remaining cleavage product containing within the NOTCH intracellular
  domain (NICD). This cleavage-induced heterodimer is exported to surface expression.
  Upon productive ligand engagement, NOTCH is cleaved by ADAM10 or ADAM17 and later
  cleaved by the gamma-secretase complex. Afterwards, liberated NICD translocates
  into the nucleus and interacts with the transcription factor CSL and the transcriptional
  co-activator MAML to regulate the transcription of NOTCH target genes, including
  furin, and miRNA-145.
