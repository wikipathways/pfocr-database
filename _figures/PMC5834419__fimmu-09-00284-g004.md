caption: Immunomodulation mediated by hemocyte-derived cholinergic and adrenergic
  neurotransmitters. Oyster hemocytes should represent similar immune and neuroendocrine
  functions as their counterparts in vertebrates (e.g., macrophages) and play an indispensable
  role in autocrine/paracrine immunomodulation, demonstrating that they could serve
  as suitable model for the study of the origin and evolution of the immune cells.
