caption: Network of the genes related with cancer and DNA replication, recombination,
  and repair. Ingenuity® bioinformatics pathway analysis tool were used to build a
  gene network relative to cancer. DNA replication, recombination, and repair using
  all relevant genes are listed in  and . Symbols for genes representing specific
  categories of cellular molecules as well as interactive relationships are depicted
  in the legend. Color gradations are based upon gene regulation at the fold change
  level. Red color represents the genes overexpressed in highly aggressive ovarian
  cancer cell lines. Green color represents the genes overexpressed in moderately
  aggressive ovarian cancer cell lines. No color represents the genes that did not
  show any differences between two cell groups
papertitle: Highly and moderately aggressive mouse ovarian cancer cell lines exhibit
  differential gene expression.
