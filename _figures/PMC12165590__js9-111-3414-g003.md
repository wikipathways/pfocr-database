  from different sources primarily exert signaling regulatory roles by carrying miRNAs,
  lncRNAs, and proteins. MiRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that mainly regulate gene
  expression by binding to mRNAs and inhibiting their transcription. For example,
  exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells release miR-16-5p, which
  targets and inhibits the transcription of Axin2, thereby activating the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway to promote osteogenic differentiation. LncRNAs are long non-coding RNAs
  that can act as molecular sponges for miRNAs, often exerting their regulatory functions
  by competitively binding to miRNAs. For instance, exosomes from bone marrow mesenchymal
  stem cells release LncR-MALAT1, which competitively binds to miR-34c, promoting
  the transcription of the miR-34c target gene SATB2 and enhancing osteogenic differentiation.
  The role of proteins in exosomes is even more diverse; on one hand, they can exert
  effects through ligand-receptor binding, and on the other hand, they can act as
  transcription factors regulating the transcription of target genes. For example,
  exosomes derived from adipose stem cells can deliver OPG, which directly binds to
  its ligand RANKL, inhibiting the RANKL/RANK signaling pathway and thereby suppressing
  osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, exosomes from myoblasts can deliver the
  transcription factor Prrx2, which directly binds to the promoter of lncRNA-MIR22HG
  to promote its transcription, thereby activating the HIPPO signaling pathway and
  promoting osteogenic differentiation. Ultimately, these exosomes from different
  sources regulate various biological processes, including cell cycle, proliferation,
  apoptosis, differentiation, angiogenesis, and immune responses, by delivering distinct
  genetic information. OPG: osteoprotegerin: USP7: ubiquitin-specific protease 7;
