caption: Summary of the coagulation and inflammation phase of healing. The repair
  process begins with the formation of fibrin-based clots and the inflammatory response.
  Neutrophils were recruited in response to products released from platelet degranulation
  releasing IL-8 and CXCL8 and also by chemotactic signals produced from DAMP, MAMP,
  HSP, and HMGB and by complement opsonization. Monocytes migrate later in this phase
  from the circulation into the tissue due to LPS produced by invading bacteria, which
  are bound to TLR on the surface of monocytes. This pathway forms one example of
  the PAMP-stimulated migration of monocytes. Products released from damaged tissue
  such as ATP, extracellular RNA, or DNA influence monocyte migration. PAMP- or DAMP-mediated
  monocyte recruitment can stimulate interleukins or chemokines such as CCL20 and
  CCL2, which bind to their receptors—CCR6 and CCR2, respectively—on monocytes. Wound
  resident macrophages also play a role in this phase as they are activated by DAMP,
  including ATP and HMGB. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; DAMP, damage-associated molecular
  pattern; HMGB, high-mobility group box protein; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; PMN, polymorphonuclear
  neutrophil; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; TLR, Toll-like receptors;
  HSP, heat shock protein; MAMP, microbes-associated molecular patterns.
