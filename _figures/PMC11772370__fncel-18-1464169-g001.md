caption: The metabolic crosstalk between neurons and glia involving lactate is implicated
  in epilepsy. 1. Both glucose and lactate can serve as energy substrates for neurons.
  Glucose is primarily taken up by neurons via GLUT3, while lactate, mainly provided
  by astrocytes and microglia, is mostly taken up by neurons via MCT2 during situations
  of intense stimulation of neural function. In a hypoxic environment, within neurons,
  the lactate generated from glucose through glycolysis and the lactate transferred
  into the cell by MCT2 are spread on the mitochondrial membrane by MCT1 and MCT2.
  There, they penetrate the TCA cycle, and the TCA contributes to the production of
  a significant amount of ATP and ROS through the promotion of oxidative phosphorylation.
  The ATP not only supports neuronal excitation but also activates the NLRP3/NF-κB
  pathway in microglia, leading to epilepsy. The mtROS may cause epilepsy by inducing
  oxidative stress in neurons, but PPP can reduce it by synthesizing glutathione,
  an antioxidant. Additionally, lactate can lead to epilepsy by enhancing the lactylation
  levels of proteins related to mitochondrial function, such as inducing Ca2+ overload-mediated
  mitochondrial apoptosis by promoting lactylation of key proteins of the Ca2+ signaling
  pathway, Scl25a4 (K245), Slc25a5 (K96) and Vdac1 (K20, K266). The transfer of HMGB1
  from the nucleus to the cytoplasm can help coordinate homophilin lactylation, leading
  to epileptogenesis by mediating neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction. However, astrocytes
  maintain normal neuronal physiological activity and reduce epileptogenesis by providing
  healthy mitochondria to neurons. 2. In astrocytes, glucose taken up by the GLUT1
  channel is converted into lactate, which is primarily exported by the MCT1/4 and
  used as an energy source by neurons. Both microglia and astrocytes can secrete HMGB1,
  which is a damage-associated molecular pattern and continues to induce the activation
  of glial cells and the inflammatory damage of neurons, leading to the occurrence
  of epilepsy. Meanwhile, HMGB1 secreted by microglia can mediate epileptogenesis
  through activation of the NF-κB pathway in astrocytes. 3. In a hypoxic environment,
  the lactate generated by glycolysis in microglia not only supports neuronal energy
  metabolism but also facilitates the lactylation of histones H3K18 and H4K12, which
  enhances the expression of NF-κB and glycolysis-related genes. NF-κB can trigger
  the onset of epilepsy, and the enzymes, such as LDH, HIF-1α, and PKM2, can further
  promote the production of lactate, which then helps in the lactylation of histones,
  ultimately intensifying the symptoms of epilepsy. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP);
