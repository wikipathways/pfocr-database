caption: 'Minimum turnover of selected metabolites from the central carbon metabolism
  and from the VG biosynthetic pathway (including cofactors). Metabolites from the
  central carbon metabolism: glucose-6-phosphate, erythrose-4-phosphate, pyruvate
  and ethanol; Metabolites from the VG biosynthetic pathway (ATP, NADPH, SAM and UDP-glucose).
  Metabolites for which minimum turnover was calculated are represented by filled
  circles, metabolites for which no minimum turnover was calculated are represented
  by open rings. Reactions are represented as arrows. Qualitative variation of the
  minimum turnovers relatively to the reference (VG0) is shown by the arrows next
  to each metabolite; yellow corresponds to VG2 while red corresponds to VG4.'
