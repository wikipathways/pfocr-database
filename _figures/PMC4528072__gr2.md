caption: 'Model for the mechanisms leading from impaired regulation of the alternative
  pathway to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). (A) Pathway in unaffected individuals.
  Factor H (FH) binds to the glycosaminoglycans and to C3b on endothelial surface
  and prevents the interaction of C3b with factor B (FB) to form the alternative pathway
  C3 convertase. In addition, together with membrane cofactor protein (MCP), FH acts
  as cofactor for factor I (FI)-mediated cleavage of C3b. FH also dissociates the
  C3 convertase of the alternative pathway (not shown). Thrombomodulin (THBD) enhances
  FI-mediated inactivation of C3b in the presence of FH. (B) Pathway in patients with
  mutations in complement regulatory genes for FH, MCP, FI, and THBD (loss-of-function
  mutants are indicated with dashed lines). C3b is not degraded efficiently and forms
  the C3 and C5 convertases of the alternative pathway. C5b initiates assembly of
  the terminal complement complex (C5b-9), leading (together with C5a) to cell injury
  and activation, with exocytosis of adhesion molecules (P-selectin) and von Willebrand
  factor (VWF), which favor platelet adhesion and aggregation, and expression of tissue
  factor, which activates coagulation. Subsequent cell detachment exposes the subendothelial
  matrix, followed by VWF binding to collagen, which amplifies the prothrombotic state.
  Aggregated platelets release procoagulant microvesicles (PMV) containing tissue
  factor, which facilitate assembly of clotting enzymes. A similar picture applies
  to patients with gain-of-function mutations in FB and C3 (indicated with thick lines).
  Mutant C3b does not bind FH and MCP and is resistant to degradation by FI. Both
  mutant C3 and mutant FB form a superconvertase that is resistant to dissociation
  by surface complement regulators. Abbreviations: aHUS, atypical HUS; GAG, glycosaminoglycans.'
