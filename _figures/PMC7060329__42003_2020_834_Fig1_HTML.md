caption: Gray arrows represent the major enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis
  of naringenin. Blue arrows are flavanone 2-hydroxylases (F2H) and flavanone 3’-hydroxylases
  (F3’H) decorating the skeleton of flavanone. C-glycosyltransferases (CGTs) are indicated
  in red arrows. After the formation of C-glycosylated intermediates, a dehydration
  reaction occurs spontaneously in acidic solvent (yellow arrows), producing a mixture
  of 6-C- or 8-C-glucosides. TAL tyrosine ammonia lyase, 4CL 4-coumarate CoA ligase,
  CHS chalcone synthase, CHI chalcone isomerase, Nar naringenin, Eri eriodictyol,
  2OHNar 2-hydroxylnaringenin, 2OHEri 2-hydroxyleriodictyol, Vit vitexin, Isovit isovitexin,
  Ori orientin, Isoori isoorientin.
