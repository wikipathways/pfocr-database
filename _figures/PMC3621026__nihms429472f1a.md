caption: Pharmacological strategies to overcome resistance to apoptosis in cancer
  cells treated with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. (A) Many tumor cells have activated receptor
  tyrosine kinases (RTKs), or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, and/or activation of the
  RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Combining TKIs or MEK inhibitors with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
  can induce cancer cell death. (B) Pro-apoptotic genes are often silenced epigenetically
  in tumor cells. HDAC inhibition leads to increased histone acetylation and more
  open chromatin state at gene regulatory elements. PI3K/mTOR inhibition triggers
  nuclear accumulation of FOXO transcription factors, which can access pro-apoptotic
  gene promoters when cells are treated with HDAC inhibitors. (C) Low mitochondrial
  priming is a significant barrier to apoptotic induction in some cancer cells. BCL2
  antagonists can increase priming and lower the threshold for apoptotic induction
  by PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.
