caption: FOXO proteins are involved in multiple signaling pathways that control cell
  proliferation, apoptosis, survival, and immune functions in response to external
  and internal stimuli. Stimulated growth factors (insulin or insulin-like growth
  factor I) and their receptors (such as epidermal growth factor receptor) lead to
  activation of ERK (A), Akt (B) and CDK2 (C) through RAS and phosphoinositide 3-kinase–dependent
  phosphorylation of FOXOs. ERK and Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO proteins
  inhibit transcription of the gene that promote apoptosis (Bim, FasL, and TRAIL)
  and cell cycle arrest (p27, p21, and c-myc) by exporting FOXO proteins to cytoplasm
  and inducing ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Akt-mediated phosphorylation
  allows FOXOs cytoplasmic retention through 14-3-3 protein binding, whereas ERK pathway
  activation leads to FOXO ubiquitination through MDM2 binding. Similarly, tumor necrosis
  factor α (TNFα) stimulates IKK, which phosphorylates FOXO and thus promote cytoplasmic
  retention. FOXOs phosphorylation by CDKs also leads to cytoplasmic localization.
  However, this activity is abolished on any DNA damage, leading to the activation
  of CHK1 and CHK2. In case of any oxidative stress, FOXO proteins translocate back
  to the nucleus with the help of c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK)–dependent and MST1 phosphorylation
  (D) and on interaction with β-catenins.
