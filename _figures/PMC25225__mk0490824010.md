  as well as transcription of genes encoding ribosomal components (adapted from ).
  Broken arrows indicate that direct interactions between components have not been
  demonstrated. See text for details. Not depicted in the figure are Bmh1 and Bmh2,
  the yeast homologues of 14-3-3 proteins, which have been shown recently to be involved
  in TOR signaling ().
