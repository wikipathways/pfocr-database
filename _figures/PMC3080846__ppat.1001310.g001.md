caption: (A) Cytosolic DNA from invading viruses and bacteria engage and activate
  AIM2 binding to the adaptor ASC. ASC mediates caspase-1-dependent pro-IL-1β/pro-IL-18
  cleavage and secretion of their bioactive forms, IL-1β and IL-18. IL-1β and IL-18
  are significant mediators of inflammatory responses to infection. (B) Four known
  cytosolic sensors are represented here. Lrrfip1 recognized viral DNA as well as
  RNA to induce IFNβ via a β-catenin-IRF3 transactivator pathway independently of
  the kinase TBK1. DAI can bind double-stranded B-form and atypical Z-form DNA to
  induce TBK1-IRF3-dependent IFNβ production. Evidence for the role of adaptors MAVS/STING
  in these pathways is lacking. IFI16 can directly bind viral DNA via its HIN200 domains
  and initiate IFNβ induction in a STING-TBK1- and IRF3-dependent manner. RNA polymerase
  III (Pol III) generates 5′ tri-phosphate RNA that is a ligand for RIG-I. RIG-I signals
  via the adaptor MAVS, subsequently activating ubiquitin ligase TRAF3 and subsequently
  TBK1 and IRF3. The ubiquitin binding protein RNF5 inhibits STING activation by targeting
  it to the proteasome, while TREX1 inhibits/prevents IFNβ production by degrading
  DNA substrate. (C) The receptor for advanced glycated end products (RAGE) and HMGB1
  can bind extracellular CpG-rich DNA and transport it to a TLR9-positive compartment.
  Here, it is recognized by TLR9 and signals via MyD88 and the IKK kinase, IKKα, and
  IRF7 in pDCs to induce IFNα production. The cytosolic DExD/H box helicases DHX9/DHX36
  can recognize cytosolic CpG DNA and initiate signaling to IRF7 via MyD88.
