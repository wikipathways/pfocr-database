caption: 'This is a regulated pathway for axon microtubule restructuring that appears
  to be affected in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, either by virtue of increased Sema3A
  expression in terminal Schwann cells near amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-sensitive
  neuromuscular junctions through aberrant CRMP4a expression, or by sequestration
  of CRMP2 within axonal inclusion bodies.P: Phosphate group.'
