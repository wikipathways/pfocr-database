caption: The distribution of the eight genes in autophagy pathway (map04140). The
  eight genes (indicated as orange oval) were the potential targets of SLC7A11 as
  a ceRNA in 379 ovarian cancers which significantly and positive co-expressed with
  the SLC7A11, and the three genes (indicated in red) were those co-expressed in 90
  drug resistant ovarian cancer tissues.
