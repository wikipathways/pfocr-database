caption: RBP4 synthesized by adipocytes (A) (or possibly arriving from the circulation)
  activates resident adipose tissue macrophages (M) and dendritic/antigen presenting
  cells (APC). Through a JNK-dependent pathway, this induces proinflammatory cytokine
  secretion (TNFα and IL-1β) from macrophages and expression of major histocompatibility
  complex class II (MHCII) molecules as well as costimulatory molecules. The proinflammatory
  molecules and cytokines directly contribute to adipose tissue inflammation and insulin
  resistance. The activated antigen presenting cells induce CD4 T cell proliferation
  and Th1 polarization increasing levels of TNFα and IFN-γ which further stimulate
  adipose tissue macrophages bringing about increased local inflammation and systemic
  insulin resistance. Adapted from .
