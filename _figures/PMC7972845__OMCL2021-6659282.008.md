caption: 'The pathway model of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammation. Under hyperglycemic
  cellular condition, large amounts of ROS are produced in mitochondria and accumulated
  intracellularly. This high concentration of ROS leads to the release of TXNIP from
  oxidized TRX and in turn directly binds to the leucine-rich region of NLRP3 (omitted
  in this figure), Subsequently, NLRP3 oligomerizes and recruits ASC and procaspase
  1 to form the NLRP3 inflammasome complex, which triggers the activation of caspase
  1 and the release of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1β. Finally, inflammatory
  response is induced by abundant proinflammatory cytokines. DX: dextrose; ROS: reactive
  oxygen species; TXNIP: thioredoxin-interacting protein; TRX: thioredoxin; ASC: apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain; IL-1β: interleukin-1β.'
