  Integrin avβ6 interacts with the amino acid sequence RGD, which is located near
  the C-terminus of LAP. TGF-β can be activated after release from LAP. The inhibition
  of avβ6-mediated TGF-β activation prevents RIPF. Both LY2109761, a small molecule
  TGF-β receptor 1 serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, and galunisertib, a highly selective
  inhibitor of TGFβR1, attenuate RIPF by inhibiting TGF-β–associated downstream targets.
  Further, 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) effectively inhibits the action of HIF-1α, reducing
  EndMT, EMT, and concomitant deposition of vascular collagen and eventually attenuating
  the development of RIPF. PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, SU9518,
  and SU11657) markedly attenuated the development of fibroblast foci and subsequent
  remodeling of lung architecture.
