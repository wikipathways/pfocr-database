caption: Molecular mechanisms of azole resistance. In a susceptible cell, azole drugs
  enter the cell through an unknown mechanism, perhaps by passive diffusion. The azoles
  then inhibit Erg11 (pink circle), blocking the formation of ergosterol. Two types
  of efflux pumps are expressed at low levels. The CDR proteins are ABCT with both
  a membrane pore (green tubes) and two ABC domains (green circles). The MDR protein
  is an MF with a membrane pore (red tubes). In a “model” resistant cell, the azoles
  also enter the cell through an unknown mechanism. The azole drugs are less effective
  against Erg11 for two reasons; the enzyme has been modified by specific point mutations
  (dark slices in pink circles) and the enzyme is overexpressed. Modifications in
  other enzymes in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway contribute to azole resistance
  (dark slices in blue spheres). The sterol components of the plasma membrane are
  modified (darker orange of membrane). Finally, the azoles are removed from the cell
  by overexpression of the CDR genes (ABCT) and MDR (MF). The CDR genes are effective
  against many azole drugs, while MDR appears to be specific for fluconazole. Reprinted
