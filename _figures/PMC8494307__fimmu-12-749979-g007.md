caption: Schematic diagram of the present findings. High levels of estrogen in ovarian
  ectopic lesions can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway by promoting ERE mediated
  transcription via ER-α in MCs. Increased expression of NLRP3 and K+ efflux activated
  the recruitment of inflammasomes, leading to the activation of caspase-1 and ultimately
  the production and secretion of functional IL-1β, which may trigger the pathogenesis
  of endometriosis.
