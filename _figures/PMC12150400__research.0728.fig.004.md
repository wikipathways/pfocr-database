caption: 'Interaction between Trp metabolites and OP. Osteoblastogenesis: Kyn inhibited
  osteogenic marker expression including OCN and Runx2. The kyn-AhR axis decreased
  LC3B-II and autophagolysosomal production, with increased p62 levels. Kyn also induced
  a senescent phenotype with up-regulated p21, as well as enhanced aggregation of
  nuclear H3K9me3. KYNA could reduce NF-κB p65 phosphorylation by activating the Gpr35
  receptor to up-regulate Runx2 expression. Melatonin suppressed OB differentiation
  through activation of the PI3K/AKT and BMP/Smad signaling and restrained the autophagy-targeted
  miR-224-5p/SIRT3/AMPK/mTOR axis. Melatonin also enhanced osteogenic differentiation
  and delayed bone loss via the HGF/PTEN/Wnt/β-catenin axis and inhibited the activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Melatonin
  decreased the level of mitochondrial superoxide by activating SIRT1 and its downstream
  SOD2. SIRT1 could also enhance SIRT3 and suppress p66Shc expression. Melatonin promoted
  NSD2 expression, leading to a rebalancing of H3K36me2 and H3K27me3 modifications
  to enhance the expressions of Runx2 and BGLAP. Melatonin reversed oxidation level
  and led to elevated ALP activity, and up-regulated expression of BMP2, Runx2, and
  OPN. Melatonin down-regulated SMURF1 expression, consequently reducing ubiquitination
  and degradation of SMAD1 protein. Melatonin significantly relieved ERS by inhibiting
  the cascade of the PERK–eIF2α–ATF4–CHOP signaling axis. Osteoclastogenesis: KYNA
  could reduce NF-κB p65 phosphorylation by activating the Gpr35 receptor to inhibit
  NFATc1 expression. Melatonin increased BMAL1 expression to inhibit the activation
  of ROS and phosphorylation of MAPK-p38. It also obstructed osteoclastogenesis by
  inhibiting PRMT1 and ADMA expression, as well as TRAF6 and the phosphorylation of
  JNK. Melatonin also restrained the transcriptional activity of NF-κB by disturbing
  the binding of PRMT1 and NF-κB subunit p65. [All original elements used in the schematic
