caption: Figure 2. Gαq-Rho GEF Trio-Rho Signaling and Ras converge on Raf to regulate
  morphology during the immune response to infection. Following pathogen infection
  RHO-1 is activated in the rectal epithelial cells by multiple upstream regulators
  including EGL-30 (Gαq) and UNC-73 (Trio). Together with Ras, Rho signaling converges
  on Raf to activate the MAPK pathway. Activation of these pathways, together with
  at least one other, in the rectal epithelial cells leads to the changes in morphology
  that occur as part of the immune response.
