caption: Distribution of root-specific differentially expressed genes between EV and
  SPL13RNAi plants. Summary of differentially affected metabolites and pathways between
  drought stressed EV and SPL13RNAi root tissues. Transcript fold changes are provided
  in log 2 with red and blue colours representing increased and decreased transcript
  levels relative to EV. Minor CHO corresponds to minor charbohydrate; TCA, Tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; OPP, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. N = 3 biological replicates
  for each genotype and treatment conditions
