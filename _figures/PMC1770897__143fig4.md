caption: 'Model of TRD: The t haplotype encodes several Distorters (only two are shown),
  which are expressed in all sperm cells derived from a t/+ male and act on two opposing
  Rho signaling pathways regulating Smok1. Smok1 is thought to be involved in sperm
  motility control. Tagap1Tcd1a and Fgd2Tcd2 represent hypermorphic alleles expressing
  strongly elevated gene activity as compared with the wild type. Enhanced down-regulation
  of the inhibitory pathway by Tagap1 and stronger up-regulation of the activating
  pathway by Fgd2 additively induce hyperactivation of Smok1 in all sperm, resulting
  in abnormal flagellar function and low fertilization probability. This harmful effect
  of the Distorters is rescued by the dominant-negative action of Tcr, which is restricted
  to t sperm, giving the latter an advantage in fertilizing the egg cells. Neither
  the Rho switch molecules nor their target effector proteins (X, Y) are known. Arrows
  symbolize activation, bars represent inhibition, green arrow indicates normal signaling,
  and purple arrow indicates impaired signaling.'
