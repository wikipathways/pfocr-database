caption: Schematic illustration of EVs interacting with immune cells. Intact EVs are
  released by APEC CT265 and target the immune cells. Both macrophages and neutrophils
  sense EVs through TLR4. EVs cause a proinflammatory response in macrophages by activating
  TLR4 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, triggering the release of proinflammatory cytokines
  and chemokines. Chemokines promote neutrophil infiltration. Cytosolic EVs also induce
  macrophage apoptosis via the mitochondria-dependent pathway. EVs induce neutrophils
  to release NETs via the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway, although the mechanism remains
  unclear
