caption: 'Cellular mechanisms of hormones and their effect on bone maintenance.TGFβ
  signaling pathway (a): Estrogen (E) and androgen (A) favor expression of TGFβ, which
  regulates the expression of BGLAP, OPN, ALPL, COL1A1, RUNX2, and BMP2 [31,54,94,95,97,98].
  TGFβ3 inhibits the production of IL-1 and TNF of T-cells, which increases osteoclast
  differentiation by promoting RANKL expression [93]. TGFβ3 also inhibits RANKL signaling
  by increasing OPG expression [93].OPG/RANKL signaling pathway (b): E and A enhance
  production of OPG from osteoblasts [116]. OPG binds to RANKL, blocking the activation
  of RANKL [107]. Without OPG, activation of RANKL would lead to recruitment of TRAF6,
  which has several downstream effects including activation of the MAPK and NF-κB
  pathways, which enables the expression of the ACP5, CTSK, and MMP9 genes [[233],
  [234], [235]]. TNF augments RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis [236]. The activation
  of RANK by RANKL also leads to the production of ROS by osteoclast precursors via
  a signaling cascade involving TRAF6, [109]. ROS acts as an intracellular signal
  for the differentiation of osteoclast precursors into osteoclasts via MAPK and NF-κB
  pathways [108,115].Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (c): Association of the Wnt molecule
  with FZD and LRP 5/6 leads to the release of β-catenin into the cytosol, which permits
  the transcription of OPG, promoting osteoblast activity [119,120]. E maintains and
  inhibits SOST expression through ERα and ERβ, respectively [123]. A favors the expression
  of SOST through ARs [118]. Sclerostin, the protein encoded by SOST, acts as a negative
  feedback mechanism on the Wnt pathway. Sclerostin increases osteoclast differentiation
  by increasing RANKL expression [121].FasL signaling pathway (d): E induces transcription
  of FasL via ERα activation [125,126], and the soluble FasL stimulates osteoclast
  apoptosis [124,125]. E regulates anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 in osteoblasts [128].
  E also induces the transcription of the ALPL gene via ERα to promote bone mineralization
  [13,130].IGF signaling pathway (e): A and AR signaling increase expression of IGFBP3.
  A also induces the expression of IGF and ALPL; ALPL could promote osteogenesis [135].
  IGF-I activates MAPK signaling, ultimately leading to osteoclast differentiation
  [131]. IGF-I and E also activate PI3K, upregulating Akt, which promotes mTOR gene
  expression and osteoblast formation [132].PTH, CT, and VitD signaling pathway (f):
  A low blood Ca2+ level activates the PTH signaling pathway. PTH1R is implicated
  in the activation of AC-PKA and PLC-PKC signaling pathway [136,137]. Activation
  of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway results in promotion of bone formation or bone
  resorption [80,[138], [139], [140], [141]]. PLC activates PKC and IP3 production,
  subsequently activating calcium mobilization and increasing blood Ca2+ level [145].
  E and A suppresses PTH-stimulated osteoclast-like cell formation by blocking both
  the AC-PKA and PLC-PKC signaling pathways [146,147]. PTH increases 1α(OH)ase synthesis,
  which promotes 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis, in turn suppressing PTH production. 1,25(OH)2D3
  acting via the VDR mediates negative or positive effects in bone [151]. A high blood
  Ca2+ level activates the calcitonin (CT) signaling pathway. The physiological effects
  of CT to decrease circulating Ca2+ levels through the inhibition of bone resorption
  are mediated by CT receptors (CTRs) [159]. E could increase CT secretory capacity
