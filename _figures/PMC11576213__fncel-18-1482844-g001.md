caption: SP/SA is involved in Hebbian long-term potentiation. Presence of SP/SA in
  spines enables the release of Ca2+ from RYR and NMDAR, allowing for the build-up
  of high [Ca2+] in spines to activate CAMKII during NMDAR-LTP and t-LTP. Subsequent
  phosphorylation of AMPAR by CAMKII initiates AMPAR surface insertion (signaling
  pathway shown in black arrow). CAMKII can equally activate signaling pathways to
  induce the long-lasting form of LTP (l-LTP) through ribosome-mediated local de novo
  protein synthesis in WT, as ribosomes are associated with SA (signaling pathway
  shown in brown arrow). In SPKO, NMDAR-LTP and t-LTP are impaired as SA is absent
  in spines. Lack of SA causes insufficient release of Ca2+ in spines to activate
  CaMKII. Loss of SA also lead to removal of ribosome from spines, disabling local
  protein synthesis for l-LTP
