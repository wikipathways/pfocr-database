caption: Differentiation pathways of inducible T‐cell co‐stimulator‐positive (ICOS+)
  and ICOS− recent thymic emigrant (RTE) regulatory T (Treg)/responder T (Tresp) cells
  during renal replacement therapy. The privileged differentiation pathway (red arrows)
  of ICOS+ and ICOS− RTE Treg/Tresp cells into ICOS+ and ICOS− CD31− memory Treg/Tresp
  cells is shown for end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) patients (a), dialysis patients
  (b) and patients who underwent kidney transplantation < 2 years (c) or > 2 years
  (d) previously. Decreasing percentages of CD31+ memory T cells propose an increased
  differentiation via this subset, whereas increasing percentages of mature naive
  (MN) T cells propose an increased differentiation via MNs. Changes in the ratios
  of ICOS+ Treg to ICOS+ Tresp cells or ICOS− Treg to ICOS− Tresp cells are marked
  by (). Over the period from ESRD to long‐term transplantation, the increased differentiation
  of ICOS+ RTE Treg cells ceases, whereas that of ICOS+ Tresp cells is maintained,
  changing the ratio of ICOS+ Treg to ICOS+ Tresp cells in favour of ICOS+ Tresp cells.
  In addition, the differentiation of ICOS− RTE Treg cells via ICOS− CD31+ memory
  Treg cells cannot be maintained over time and switches to a differentiation via
  ICOS− MN Treg cells. Consequently, as ICOS− RTE Tresp cells maintain their differentiation
  via ICOS− MN Tresp cells over the period from ESRD to long‐term transplantation,
  the ratio of ICOS− Treg cells to ICOS− Tresp cells is changed in favour of ICOS−
  Tresp cells.

  description: Differentiation pathways of inducible T‐cell co‐stimulator‐positive

    (Tresp) cells during renal replacement therapy. The privileged differentiation
    pathway (red arrows) of ICOS+ and ICOS− RTE Treg/Tresp cells into ICOS+ and ICOS− CD31−
    memory Treg/Tresp cells is shown for end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) patients (a),

    propose an increased differentiation via this subset, whereas increasing percentages
    of mature naive (MN) T cells propose an increased differentiation via MNs. Changes
    in the ratios of ICOS+ Treg to ICOS+ Tresp cells or ICOS− Treg to ICOS− Tresp
    cells are marked by (). Over the period from ESRD to long‐term transplantation,
    the increased differentiation of ICOS+ RTE Treg cells ceases, whereas that of
