caption: Schematic drawing of the signal transduction pathways involved in human gingival
  fibroblast (HGF) migration including the possible effects of nicotine on these pathways.
  The small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)ase, Rac, becomes activated when a GTP is
  bound to the protein. The GTP-Rac activates p21-activated kinases (PAK 1/2). PAK
  can also be activated by pathways independent of Rac (other kinases). Activated
  PAK1/2 signals through other proteins including myosin light chain kinase (MLCK),
  myosin I heavy chain (MHC), myosin II heavy chain (MIIHC), and desmin to regulate
  actin re-organization and cell migration. Rac can also activate the Wiskott–Aldrich
  syndrome protein (WASP) and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) family.
  Signals from these proteins integrate into the Arp2/3 complex that increases actin
  polymerization. The cell–matrix interactions through integrins are partially regulated
  by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) to regulate actin cytoskeleton and
  cell adhesion and motility. The activated p44/42 MAPK proteins are also named the
  extracellular-regulated kinase (erk 1 and 2). The current data showed that nicotine
  changed Rac activation patterns but increased PAK1/2 and erk1/2. We hypothesize
  that the increased erk1/2 activation may increase cell adhesion and decrease cell
  migration. Nicotine also appears to increase PAK1/2 activation through a Rac-independent
  pathway that has not been identified.
