caption: Transition from AR signaling-dependent to PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway-dependent
  in PCa. PCa as a localized disease and at the early stage of metastatic disease
  is androgen- and castration-sensitive. The tumor at these stages strongly relies
  on systemic/circulating androgens for activating AR signaling to stimulate growth
  and progression (left panel). This makes it easy to suppress the tumor with therapeutic
  approaches that target androgen synthesis and AR signaling. However, after a certain
  period of time, the tumor will eventually develop a resistant stage called castration-resistance
  (middle panel). At this stage, ADT and the first generation of AR antagonists are
  not any more effective due to several hypothesized reasons, including intratumoral
  androgen synthesis, amplification of AR, activation of ligand-independent genomic
  AR signaling (e.g., via PI3K-AKT-mTOR), etc. These mechanisms suggest that the tumor
  at this stage still relies on AR signaling, although via adaptive responses, but
  could still be treated with second generation AR antagonists. Notably, bipolar androgen
  therapy (BAT) with cycling treatment of ADT and supraphysiological androgen levels
  seems to be also effective. Again, after a period of time, the tumor will become
  resistant to AR antagonist (right panel). Presumably, the therapeutic pressure by
  AR antagonists will selectively lead to the accumulation of PCa cells that no longer
  express AR or at least express mutated AR/AR splice variants (e.g., ARv7) lacking
  ligand binding domain. This makes the tumor insensitive to AR antagonists and BAT.
  Independent of AR, the tumor at this stage fully relies on hyperactivation of multiple
  cellular signaling cascades such as PI3K-AKT-mTOR and signaling of other nuclear
  hormone receptors (e.g., GR, PR, and ER). Along with more advance stages of the
  disease, an aggressiveness of the PCa is enhancing, whereas the survival of the
  PCa patient is reducing. AKT, protein kinase B; AR, androgen receptor; ARE, androgen
  response element; ARv7, androgen receptor splice variant 7; ER, estrogen receptor;
