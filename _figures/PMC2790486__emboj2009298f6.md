caption: 'Proposed model for Hsp70-mediated modulation of αSyn aggregation. As Hsp70
  cycles through the different nucleotide states sampling different conformations,
  it is able to inhibit αSyn aggregation by maintaining αSyn in a soluble conformation
  with low cytotoxicity (centre of cartoon). Depending on the nucleotide environment,
  there are different scenarios: (I) nucleotide-free Hsp70/αSyn forms a loose complex,
  which does not affect the solubility of Hsp70, and gives rise to disordered, soluble
  αSyn oligomers of moderate toxicity (left); (II) the compact ADP-Hsp70/αSyn complex,
  on the other hand, may lead to the co-aggregation of Hsp70 with αSyn, depleting
  the chaperone from solution, and allowing αSyn fibrils to form rapidly, a process
  that populates intermediates with high cytotoxicity (right). The co-chaperone Hip,
  on binding to the ATPase domain of Hsp70 in the ADP-state, could stabilize the ADP-Hsp70
  complex and maintain Hsp70 in solution, hence inhibiting the pathway towards αSyn
  fibril formation. The denomination of ‘loose'' and ‘compact'' complex originates
  from the determination of a set of FRET-derived intermolecular distances for the
  Hsp70/αSyn interaction in the absence and presence of ADP, respectively (see  and
  ).'
