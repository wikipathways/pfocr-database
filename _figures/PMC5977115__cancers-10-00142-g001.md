caption: SIAH is the most downstream signaling gatekeeper and a key signaling bottleneck
  in the RAS signaling pathway. This schematic illustration highlights the critical
  role of SIAH, a key signaling bottleneck and the most downstream signaling gatekeeper,
  whose function is indispensable for proper RAS signal transduction. Oncogenic K-RAS
  pathway activation is known to exhibit immense signaling plasticity, heterogeneity,
  complexity, and spatio–temporal context- dependence in vitro and in vivo. A systemic
  view of the multifaceted RAS signaling network activation is depicted as an elastic
  signaling “funnel” that is highly flexible, adaptive, and constantly changing, and
  rapidly evolving. This signaling funnel depicts the dynamic regulation of a multitude
  of compensatory pathway activation, cross talk, signaling bifurcation, feed-forward
  and/or feedback control mechanisms that are commonly observed in response to oncogenic
  K-RAS pathway activation in a cancer cell signaling network. As active RAS signals
  propagate down the EGFR/RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signal transduction cascade, SIAH constitutes
  the most downstream signaling hub. Its critical biological function is indispensable
  for controlling the active EGFR/RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK/ETS signaling output and readout
  in normal development as well as in K-RAS-driven oncogenesis. Supported by key insights
  and molecular principles gleaned from developmental, evolutionary and cancer biology,
  it is not surprising to find that mammalian SIAH serves as an important signaling
  gatekeeper and critical signaling bottleneck in the oncogenic K-RAS signaling pathway
  in human cancers. As such, SIAH is a major PDAC tumor vulnerability that is ideally
  positioned to become a next-generation viable and logical anti-K-RAS drug target
  in oncogenic K-RAS-driven human cancers.
