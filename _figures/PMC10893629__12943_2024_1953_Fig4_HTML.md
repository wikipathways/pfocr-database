caption: Frequently altered signaling pathways in SCLC. a The Hippo signaling pathway
  discriminates between active (ON) and inactive (OFF) states. When Hippo signaling
  is on, the phosphorylation of SAV1 is mediated by MST1/2, both further activating
  MOB1A/B and LATS1/2 via phosphorylation. Ultimately, the YAP/TAZ complex is phosphorylated
  and degraded, resulting in transcriptional repression. Or in contrast, when Hippo
  signaling is off, the phosphorylation cascade does not take place. The YAP/TAZ complex
  translocates into the nucleus and interacts with TEAD, leading to transcriptional
  activation. b The Notch signaling pathway is mediated between signal-sending and
  signal-receiving cells via interaction of the Notch receptor and a Notch ligand
  (DLL or JAG). Consecutively, the Notch receptor is cleaved; NICD translocates into
  the nucleus and activates the transcription of target genes in signal-receiving
  cells (e.g. HES, HEY, and MYC). ASCL1 is categorized as a master regulator of NE
  differentiation via high expression of the non-functional DLL3 at the golgi apparatus.
  DLL3 acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of Notch signaling and orchestrates the
  degradation of other Notch members. HES and HEY family members encode transcriptional
  repressors of ASCL1. Notch negatively regulates NE differentiation in SCLC. High
  ASCL1 expression levels significantly correlate with NE differentiation. c Hedgehog
  signaling is activated by the binding of SHH to PTCH1. This leads to the shift of
  inhibitory activity towards SUFU (green path). Subsequently, the GLI1 monomer translocates
  into the nucleus and promotes gene transcription. When PTCH1 exerts its inhibitory
  effects against SMO, SUFU and GLI1 build a complex which inactivates the expression
  of HH target genes (red path). d Epigenetic reprogramming plays an instrumental
  role in SCLC via methylation / acetylation of DNA/histones. Key chromatin modifiers
  are EZH2, the CREBBP/EP300 complex, and the KMT2 family proteins which each target
  the amino acids K27, K18, or K4 of histone 3, respectively. Created with BioRender.com.
