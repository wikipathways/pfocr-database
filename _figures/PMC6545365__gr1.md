caption: Schematic Representation of the Biogenesis and Secretion of ExosomesExosomes
  are formed as intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). The cargoes (nucleic acids, proteins,
  and lipids) are ingested by the cells through the endocytotic pathway and are then
  transported to early endosomes. The maturation of early endosomes gives rise to
  multivesicular bodies (MVBs), late endosomes containing numerous ILVs. During the
  process of ILV generation, nucleic acids (miRNAs, DNAs, and RNAs), proteins (cytoplasmic
  proteins, tetraspanins, and membrane receptors), and lipids (ceramides and cholesterol)
  are incorporated into exosomes. Several molecules are involved in the biogenesis
  of ILVs, such as ESCRT and ALIX. MVBs can fuse with the cellular membranes to release
  exosomes into the extracellular space. Alternatively, MVBs can fuse with lysosomes,
  which results in the degradation of engulfed contents. MVB fusion with the cellular
  membrane is a fine-tuned multistep process involving MVB trafficking along microtubules,
  docking at the cellular membrane, and fusion to the cellular membrane. Several Rab
  GTPases (Rab27a and Rab27b) are implicated in the transport of MVBs to the cellular
  membrane and in the release of exosomes. Additionally, SNARE complexes may facilitate
  the fusion of MVBs with the cellular membranes. Exosomal cargoes can be delivered
  to the recipient cells via endocytosis, fusion with the cellular membrane, or ligand-receptor
  interaction.
