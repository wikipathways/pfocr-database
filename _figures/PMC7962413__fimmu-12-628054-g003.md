caption: Immune pathway crosstalk. (A) In Drosophila, the DIF-Relish heterodimer activates
  the expression of both Toll and IMD pathway effectors, resulting in a stronger response
  against infection (). (B) In Culex, after recognition of West Nile virus (WNV) dsRNA
  by Dcr-2, TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) stimulates Relish, upregulating
  Vago expression (, ). Vago is then secreted by the infected cell and activates the
  JAK/STAT pathway in adjacent cells, upregulating the expression of antiviral genes.
  (C) In R. microplus, knockdown of Dorsal downregulates both Dorsal and Relish expression
  in salivary glands, while the levels of all the transcription factors remain unaltered
  in the gut. Relish is also downregulated in the gut and salivary glands of STAT-deficient
  ticks. Conversely, knockdown of Relish results in the specific silencing of its
  target gene in both the gut and salivary glands ().
