caption: 'The serine synthesis pathway and downstream anabolic reactions of serine.
  Serine can be imported from the extracellular space by amino acid exchangers that
  trade extracellular serine for an intracellular amino acid (AA). Alternatively,
  serine can be synthesized de novo from glucose via the phosphoserine pathway in
  three reactions: first, PHGDH oxidizes 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) using an NAD+ cofactor
  to give phosphohydroxy pyruvate (P-Pyr); second, phosphoserine aminotransferase
  (PSAT1) transaminates P-Pyr to phosphoserine (P-Ser) using glutamate (Glu) as the
  nitrogen donor; finally, phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH) hydrolyzes P-Ser to serine.
  Serine is directly incorporated into proteins and the head groups of certain lipids.
  Serine hydroxymethyltransferases (SHMTs) catabolize serine to glycine and methylene
  tetrahydrofolate (THF-CH2) thus charging the intracellular folate pool. Both serine-derived
  folate one-carbon units and glycine contribute to nucleotide synthesis. The newly
  identified compound CBR-5884 specifically inhibits PHGDH to abrogate serine synthesis.'
