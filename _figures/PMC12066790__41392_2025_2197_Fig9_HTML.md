caption: 'Oncogenic mechanisms of EBV in lymphoma. a Progression of lymphoma caused
  by EBV. b EBV infection induces high CpG island methylation, frequent gene mutations,
  and increased DNA damage. c LMP1 induces telomere instability through the downregulation
  of TRF2. d EBV activates NF-κB, AKT/PI3K, and JNK signaling pathways to enhance
  cell proliferation. e EBV inhibits cell apoptosis by increasing IL-10 secretion,
  activating NF-κB and JAK-STAT pathways, and suppressing IFN-related apoptotic signaling
  pathways. f EBV promotes immune evasion by reducing antigen presentation and upregulating
  PD-L1, contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment through Treg cell recruitment,
  M2 macrophage infiltration, and enhanced inhibitory receptor expression on CD8+
  T cells, alongside increased oxidative stress. g LMP1 inhibits ROS-induced DNA damage
  by activating the PGC1β/HKDC1/OGG1 signaling pathway. h EBV induces metabolic reprogramming
  by upregulating intracellular MCT1/4 expression and promoting lipid synthesis. Red
