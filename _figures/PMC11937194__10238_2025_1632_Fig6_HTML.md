caption: The related mechanisms of TRPV1, TRPM8, Orai1and KCa3.1 in the process of
  tumor immunity. TRPV1 can regulate tumor immunity by mediating the secretion of
  IL-6. TRPM8 increases the expression levels of CD25 and CD69, as well as the promotion
  of TNF secretion. Orai1 induces the release of sEV and activates PD-L1, and further
  regulates T cell immune function. KCa3.1 may inhibit IL-10-mediated tumor immune
  surveillance evasion, by attenuating their production via the ERK-CREB and JNK-c-Jun
  signaling pathways
