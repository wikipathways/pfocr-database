caption: The different roles of ependyma barrier to control the brain homeostasis
  and neurogenesis. Center, Schematic representation of ependyma epithelium showing
  the position of the stem cells and the astrocytes located in the subventricular
  zone. Ependyma provides metabolic support for the astrocytes and stem cells that
  are in close proximity and will create the proper environment for stem cell function
  by the various mechanisms represented in this figure. Ep, Ependyma; SC, stem cells;
  A, astrocytes. Top left, Ependyma actively controls water transport and ion homeostasis
  by the presence of aquaporins, channels to regulates water flow and osmotic pressure,
  and different types of cotransporters such as KCC or NKCC1. Top Center, Ependyma
  plays an active role in preventing infection by expressing receptors in its surface
  that can activate an immune response against viruses or bacteria. Some representative
  receptors for this purpose are CD55, or CD59. Additionally, ependyma present components
  of the complement pathway. The most representative is TLR4. Ependyma will sense
  and react to infections and will active the nearby microglia. Bottom Left, To control
  without completely blocking paracellular transport, ependymal cells presents adherent
  junctions generated by the interactions of cadherins and catenins in a homotypic
  fashion among apical-lateral surfaces of adjacent ependymal cells; Ependymal cells
  lack complete tight junctions. These associations are crucial to maintain the differentiation
  of the CSF and brain parenchyma environments. Bottom Right, Ependyma controls the
  concentration of surrounding regulatory peptides that are present in the CSF by
  expressing enzymes that break down the molecules that may affects the ependyma itself
  or the germinal matrix/subventricular zone. Therefore, ependyma controls growth
  factors, chemokines, hormones, and neuropeptides on itself and in brain parenchyma.
  Top Right, Ependyma prevents the diffusion of damaging molecules in the ventricular
  zone or in brain parenchyma by the presence of receptors located in their membrane.
  Ependyma presents receptors for drugs, pathological proteins, or enzymatic degradation
  products. If these products persist, the ependyma function is compromised.
