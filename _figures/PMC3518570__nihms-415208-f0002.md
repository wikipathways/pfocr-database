caption: An excitatory synapse is comprised of a presynaptic axon terminal with vesicles
  containing the neurotransmitter glutamate (red) that is released into the synapse
  in response to Ca2+ influx resulting from Na+ influx-mediated depolarization of
  the neuron. Glutamate binds to ionotropic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate
  receptors (AMPAR) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) located at the membrane
  surface of the postsynaptic dendrite. AMPAR flux Na+ resulting in membrane depolarization
  and opening of NMDAR which flux Ca2+, as well as opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+
  channels (VDCC). Within the dendrite, Ca2+ functions as a second messenger to activate
  multiple signal transduction cascades including one involving Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  kinase (CaMK) and the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element-binding protein
  (CREB). Ligands that activate receptors coupled to cyclic AMP (cAMP) production
  (R) also activate CREB; examples include serotonin and glucagon-like peptide 1.
  CREB induces the expression of multiple nuclear genes that encode proteins involved
  in synaptic plasticity and cell survival including brain-derived neurotrophic factor
  (BDNF). BDNF mRNA is then transported to the postsynaptic region of the dendrite
  where it is translated into BDNF protein which is, in turn, released and activates
  BDNF receptors (trkB) located on the surface of both the post- and pre-synaptic
  terminals. One prominent signal transduction pathway activated when BDNF binds trkB
  involves phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt kinase. Glial cells (astrocytes
  and microglia) can modulate synaptic plasticity by producing neurotrophic factors
  such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
  factor (GDNF), and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) and interleukin-1β.
  In the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, a brain region critical for learning and
  memory, resides a population of neural stem cells that are capable of self-renewal
  (promoted by FGF2) and differentiation into neurons (promoted by BDNF) and astrocytes
  (promoted by bone morphogenic protein 2; BMP2).
