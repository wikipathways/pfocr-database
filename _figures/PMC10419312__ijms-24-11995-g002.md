caption: 'Roles of macrophages in CTD-ILD. The figure depicts mechanisms through which
  macrophages modulate CTD-ILD. In DM-ILD, macrophages express resistin. Resistin
  activates the NFκB signaling pathway, increasing the secretion of IL-1, IL-6, and
  TNF-α. This triggers the expression of resistin in macrophages, creating a self-perpetuating
  reaction to mediate the inflammatory pathogenesis of DM-ILD. In MPA-ILD, macrophages
  secrete CCL2, which attracts more macrophages to infiltrate. The recruited macrophages
  produce CCL2, initiating a self-propagating response. Meanwhile, CCL2 stimulates
  fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and generates ECM, leading to exaggerated
  lung fibrosis. In RA-ILD, macrophages are implicated in three ways: (1) Exaggerated
  IL-6 secretion by macrophages triggers the proliferation of GM-CSF-producing T cells,
  and GM-CSF recruits neutrophil infiltration into the lung, leading to RA-ILD progression.
  (2) Macrophage-derived SDC2 interferes with PI3K/Akt signaling, decreases PAD2 in
  fibroblasts, and reduces collagen deposition in the lungs. (3) Macrophages produce
  high levels of TNF, which leads to an inflammatory phase predominated by cellular
  infiltration into the lungs and a subsequent shift to a fibrotic phase with irreversible
  collagen deposition. In SSc-ILD, six pathways are activated by macrophages to drive
  SSc-ILD: (1) Macrophages produce increased CCL18, which facilitates collagen production.
  (2) Macrophages release increased fibronectin, which induces fibroblast proliferation
  and collagen deposition. (3) Immune complexes stimulate the production of M-CSF
  and IL-6, which further induce OPN from monocytes. In turn, OPN triggers fibroblast
  migration, driving fibrosis progression. (4) SSc-ILD shows decreased PLXNC1 expression
  in macrophages, which boosts macrophage migration. (5) RGC32 promotes iNOS/IL-1β-directed
  inflammation through NFκB signaling and subsequently enhances the fibrotic response.
  (6) Macrophage-derived YKL-40, which is increased in SSc-ILD, promotes fibroblast
  proliferation. Red arrow—increase; Blue arrow—decrease; Black arrow—lead to'
