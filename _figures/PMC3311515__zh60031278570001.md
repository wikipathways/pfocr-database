caption: Scheme for the intracellular renal RAS on the nuclear membrane. Renin cleaves
  the precursor angiotensinogen to ANG I, which is subsequently processed to ANG II
  by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ANG II binds to the AT1 receptor (AT1R)
  subtype to stimulate intranuclear Ca2+ and phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and PKC
  that increases reactive oxygen species (O2−, H2O2) by activation of NAD(P)H oxidase.
  ANG II is hydrolyzed by ACE2 to ANG-(1–7) that binds to the AT7/Mas receptor to
  stimulate the formation of nitric oxide (NO) by activation of endothelial NO synthase
  (eNOS). Generation of NO may complex with superoxide (O2−) or stimulates soluble
  guanylate cyclase (sGC) to form cGMP within the nucleus. ANG-(1–7) may potentially
  stimulate a nuclear phosphatase (PTP) to attenuate kinase activation and inhibit
  the ANG II-AT1-reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway. Although not depicted in the
  figure, ANG II also binds to the nuclear AT2 receptor subtype and stimulates NO
  formation.
