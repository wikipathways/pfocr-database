caption: Integrated metabolic and evolutionary engineering of Clostridium cellulovorans
  DSM 743B for n-butanol production from AECC by CBP. A CoA-dependent acetone-butanol-ethanol
  (ABE) pathway composed of adhE1 and ctfA-ctfB-adc (red font) from C. acetobutylicum
  ATCC 824 was constructed in C. cellulovorans. In parallel, C. cellulovorans was
  grown in medium with a serial enrichment of n-butanol to evolve and reinforce its
  butanol tolerance. To maximize butanol production, metabolic and evolutionary engineering
  were combined, using the evolved strain as a host for metabolic engineering.
