caption: 'Schematic representation of the proposed nucleotide sugar biosynthesis related
  to EPS production in K. baliensis. Starting with the phosphorylation of fructose
  to fructose-6-phosphate (6) or glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (1), these intermediates
  can be converted into mannose-6-phosphate (7) or glucose-1-phosphate (2), respectively.
  Mannose-6-phosphate can be further converted into mannose-1-phosphate (8) and finally
  into GDP-mannose. UGP (3) catalyzes the synthesis of UDP-glucose from glucose-1-phosphate.
  UDP-glucose can be further isomerized to UDP-galactose (4) or UDP-glucuronic acid
  (5). The proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of activated nucleotide sugar precursors
  is based on publications from Kornmann et al. [] and Pühler et al. []. The corresponding
