caption: Mechanisms of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Possible mechanisms of the MGB-axis
  are being actively investigated and include neuroimmune pathways, neural communication
  through the vagus nerve, influence of metabolites produced by the microbiota, microbial-derived
  neurotransmitters, and the significant influence the microbiota have on tryptophan,
  kynurenine, and serotonin metabolism. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) can promote
  peripheral T regulatory (Treg) cell expansion as well as influence tight junction
  (TJ) proteins and intestinal barrier function. Microbiota regulate tryptophan (Trp)
  metabolites by degrading Trp to indole-derivatives or through kynurenine and serotonin
  pathways, such as increasing expression of tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph)1 in enterochromaffin
  (EC) cells. Dysbiosis can promote activation of immune cells, including macrophages
  that produce quinolinic acid (QA) through an alternative kynurenine pathway, a known
  excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist. Activated immune cells
  also produce proinflammatory cytokines which can further disrupt microflora and
  impact intestinal barrier function. Neural communication can also occur through
  the vagus nerve via signaling from hormones and neurotransmitters release by gut
  endocrine cells and immune cells. Breech of the intestinal barrier would also allow
  direct pattern recognition sensing due to Toll-like receptor expression on afferent
  fibers
