caption: (A) In response to proliferative signals, cellular levels of Skp2 increase,
  resulting in Skp2 binding to p27 and targeting it for degradation. This degradation
  of p27 relieves p27-mediated inhibition of the cyclin E–CDK2 complex during late
  G1, allowing for phosphorylation and inactivation of pRb and promoting G1 progression
  to S phase. (B) In the absence of proliferative signals, pRb is hypophosphorylated
  and binds to Skp2, preventing it from binding to p27. Skp2 is then complexed with
  APC/CCdh1 and is targeted for proteasomal degradation. Free p27 is then able to
  bind cyclin E–CDK2 and inhibit its activity, resulting in continued pRb activity
  and G1 cell cycle arrest.
