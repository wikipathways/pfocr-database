caption: . Illustration of the dynamic assembly and disassembly of the dhurrin metabolon.
  Metabolon assembly involves recruitment of the soluble UGT to the ER-anchored P450s
  and POR and local accumulation of specific lipids resulting in biosynthesis of the
  insecticide dhurrin. Disassembly of the dhurrin metabolon results in release of
  the antifungal oxime intermediate. Thus, a single pathway confers resistance towards
  specific herbivores and pests governed by the dynamic assembly of enzymes in metabolons.
