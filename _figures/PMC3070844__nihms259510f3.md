caption: 'The top-scoring network created by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. This network
  exhibited metastatic potential associated abundance changes for at least 27 of the
  35 proteins in this network. Shaded genes are those identified in this study with
  color intensities representative of abundance changes in highly metastatic melanoma
  cells as follows: red ≥ 100-fold increase; shades of pink 2- to 100-fold increase;
  dark green ≥ 100-fold decrease; shades of green 2- to 100-fold decrease. The meaning
  of node shapes is defined in the insert. Some networks include metabolites as indicated
  by the symbols legend. The orange outlines on pathway shapes highlight proteins
  (genes) previously implicated in cancer. The software and/or the proteomics data
  did not consistently distinguish between protein family members and therefore in
  a few cases proteins were highlighted if a closely homologous protein was identified
  in the 3-D analysis.'
