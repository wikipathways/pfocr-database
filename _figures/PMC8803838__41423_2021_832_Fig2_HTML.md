caption: 'Neutrophil contributions to chronic disease. In obesity-related diseases,
  adipose tissue is infiltrated by neutrophils, where MPO and NE are released. Neutrophils
  promote macrophage infiltration through the secretion of IL1β by neutrophil-adipocyte
  direct interactions via CD11b-ICAM. In NAFLD, neutrophils infiltrate the liver,
  and ROS production leads to the activation of ASK and p38. The secretion of MPO
  promotes hepatocyte death and fibrosis, and hepatic NE and PR3 levels increase.
  miR-223, which is derived from neutrophils, inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome. NETs
  lead to increased inflammation by recruiting monocytes/macrophages. These diseases
  are characterized by insulin resistance and inflammation. The autoimmune disease
  T1DM is characterized by neutrophil infiltration in the pancreas. β-cells of the
  islets release CXCL1 and 2, promoting neutrophil recruitment and infiltration. CXCL1
  and 2 expression is induced by IL1β, which is secreted by macrophages. Neutrophils
  release NE and PR3 within the pancreas, increasing their levels. In the context
  of IBD, neutrophils can act either as beneficial players promoting pathogen clearance
  and wound healing through IL22 and NETs or as detrimental players enhancing inflammation
  via PAD4, proteases and ROS secretion. Cigarette smoke, the primary cause of COPD,
  inhibits apoptotic cell clearance while enhancing cell apoptosis. Chemokines released
  by alveolar macrophages induce neutrophil recruitment to the lung. NE and NETs trigger
  the transition of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, leading to increased fibrosis.
  In addition, CTSG inhibits the IL22/IL22R pathway, increasing infection propensity.
