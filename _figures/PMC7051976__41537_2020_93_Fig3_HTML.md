caption: 'Schematic representation of immature N-glycoprotein processing in the ER.
  After the N-glycan oligosaccharide precursor is attached to a protein substrate,
  α-glucosidase I (MOGS, red) cleaves the most terminal glucose. Cleavage of the next
  glucose by α-glucosidase II (GANAB, orange) is regulated by glucosidase II subunit
  β (PRCKSH, orange), and this intermediate N-glycan conformation allows the N-glycoprotein
  to interact with chaperone proteins in the calnexin–calreticulin (CNX/CRT) protein
  folding cycle. While interacting with molecules in the CNX/CRT cycle, ER-localized
  α-mannosidase I (MAN1A-C, green) cleaves mannose residues. After N-glycoprotein
  release from the CNX/CRT protein-folding cycle, GANAB/PRCKSH cleaves the final terminal
  glucose to allow interaction with UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferases
  (UGGT1/2, blue). UGGT proteins have two main functions: (1) to act as conformation
  sensors that identify incompletely folded or misfolded proteins and, if the protein
  is improperly folded, (2) to catalyze the re-addition of a terminal glucose to permit
  return to the CNX/CRT protein folding cycle. Correctly folded N-glycoproteins are
  released from the UGGT conformation sensor and can be further modified by MAN1A-C
  prior to forward trafficking to the Golgi apparatus for maturation into a complex
  N-glycan structure. If a protein fails to attain the correct tertiary structure
  and is terminally misfolded, ER degradation-enhancing mannosidases (EDEM1-3, purple)
  interact with the glycoprotein after release from the UGGT conformation sensor and
  remove mannose residues to produce a Man6-8GlcNAc2-polypeptide structure which is
  exported from the ER to be degraded via the ER-associated degradation pathway.'
