caption: 'Interactions of tumor-associated neutrophils with other cells in the tumor
  immune microenvironment. a Immunosuppressive TME. TANs recruit immunosuppressive
  macrophages and Treg cells via chemokines such as CCL4. The mechanisms through which
  TANs impair T cells include cell-cell contact, the generation of ROS (metabolic
  transition from OXPHOS to free fatty acid-dependent OXPHOS), and ferroptosis-induced
  PGE2 release. The Hv1H+ channel on TANs promotes acidification of the TME, enhancing
  tumor cell survival while impairing the antitumor functions of T cells and NK cells.
  TANs with high expression of PANX1 and CD39/CD73 collaboratively construct an immunosuppressive
  TME with exADO. The secretion of ARG1 and ARG2 by TANs can inhibit the activity
  of T cells and NK cells and promote cancer cell metastasis, respectively, suggesting
  the potential therapeutic application of ARG1 inhibitors in tumor treatment. b Immunostimulatory
  TME. TANs stimulate macrophages to produce IL-12, enhancing the antitumor effects
  of UTCαβ. The upregulation of the costimulatory molecules ICAM-1, CD86, OX40L, and
  4-1BBL on TANs also stimulates T-cell responses and proliferation. TANs can modulate
  the IL-17 pathway, limiting bacterial colonization to suppress protumor inflammatory
  responses. NE and ROS released by TANs enhance adaptive antitumor immunity and suppress
  IL-17+ γδT cells, respectively, accompanied by the activation of antitumor γδT cells.
  c Phenotypic transition of TANs. IFN, TNF-α, tumor cell-derived CXCL2, and inhibition
  of TGF-β can induce N1 polarization of TANs. Conversely, TGF-β, IL-17, G-CSF, and
  tumor cell-derived exosomes can induce N2 polarization. Targeting TAN reprogramming
  through strategies such as anti-TGF-β therapy is a promising approach in cancer
  therapy. (Abbreviations: ECM extracellular matrix, OXPHOS oxidative phosphorylation,
