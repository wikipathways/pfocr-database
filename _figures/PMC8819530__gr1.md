caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of anti-cancer activities of phytochemicals from Salvia
  spp. 1) Induction of plasma membrane permeabilization in cancer cells; 2) Reduction
  of anti-oxidant status of cancer cells and suppression of angiogenesis and metastasis
  markers; 3) Elevation of ROS in cancer cells; 4) Induction of MOMP; 5) Suppression
  of ATP production. Phytochemicals from Salvia spp induce plasma membrane permeabilization
  in cancer cells, leading to death by necrosis. They also elevate ROS production,
  leading to activation of p53, which induce cell cycle arrest and senescence via
  p21. P53 also induce the intrinsic apoptotic pathway via upregulation in expression
  of BH3-only molecules (e.g. PUMA and Noxa). BH3-only molecules elevate the levels
  of pro-apoptotic molecules (Bax and Bak) and depress the levels of anti-apoptotic
  molecules (Bcl-2). Induction of MOMP by Bax and/or Bak lead to release of cytochrome
  C, leading to apoptosis. Induction of MOMPS also leads to ATP depletion (suppression
  of ATP production), which can lead to death by necrosis. Salvia spp phytochemicals
  also suppress the levels of anti-oxidant molecules in cancer cells, allowing membrane
  lipids'' peroxidation (which can also activate p53 to bring about cell death). Salvia
  spp phytochemicals also suppress angiogenesis and metastasis markers. Abbreviations:
  ROS = Reactive oxygen species; MOMP = Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization;
  ATP = Adenosine triphosphate; CDK 1 = Cyclin-dependent kinase-1; APAF-1 = Apoptosis
  protein activating factor-1; Bax = Bcl-2-associated X protein; Bak = Bcl-2 homologous
  antagonist/killer; BH-3 = Bcl-2 homology 3; PUMA = p53 upregulated modulator of
  apoptosis.'
