caption: Overexpressed Prx II regulates stemness-associated properties of HCC cells.
  (A) Activation of VEGF/VEGFR2/STAT3 signaling via overexpressed Prx II-mediated
  stimulation of VEGF, to induce stemness gene expression such as SOX2, EpCAM and
  Keratin 19 and maintenance of stem cell properties. (B) Inducing Cyclin D1 by overactivation
  of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/FoxM1 pathway to induce stemness properties of HCC. (C) Additionally,
  the transcriptional activation of Prx II by overexpressed FoxM1 transcription factor.
  (D) Inhibition of oxidative stress and upregulation of stemness-associated properties
  by targeting ROS.
