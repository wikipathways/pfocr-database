caption: Cholesterol is synthesized from acetyl-CoA in the mevalonate pathway in the
  ER. Sequential conversion of acetyl-CoA into farnesyl pyrophosphate (Farnesyl PP)
  branches the pathway into cholesterol synthesis from squalene or the generation
  of ubiquinone, dolichols, heme A or isoprenoids, which are involved in the modification
  of proteins via farnesylation or geranylgeranylation. Squalene metabolism into lanosterol
  ensures cholesterol synthesis through both the Block and Kandutsch-Russell pathways
  from desmosterol or 7-dehydrocholesterol mediated by DHCR24 and DHCR7, respectively.
  Once synthesized, cholesterol can be esterified by ACAT, metabolized into BAs, predominantly
  through the classic pathway catalyzed by CYP7A1 or exported out of cells via cholesterol
  pumps present in plasma membrane, such as ABC1. The rate-limiting step in the cholesterol
  synthesis is the conversion of HMG-CoA into mevalonate catalyzed by HMGCR, which
  is inhibited by statins. Inhibition of squalene synthase or squalene epoxidase ensures
  a more specific approach to block cholesterol synthesis with minor effects in the
  levels of farnesyl PP and hence isoprenylation of proteins.
