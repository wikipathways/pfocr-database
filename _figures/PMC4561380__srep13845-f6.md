caption: 'GH2 hydrolizes β-glycosidic bonds between galactose and its organic functional
  group; GH95 and GH29 are enzymes that hydrolyze Fuc-alpha1-2Gal linkages attached
  to the non-reducing ends of oligosaccharides; GH43 can act directly on xylan and
  release D-xylose and L-arabinose as main products. At the top: two different lignocellulose
  structures and microorganisms involved in their deconstruction (flask pictures were
  taken by the authors). Abbreviations: Acinetobacter (Ac), Klebsiella/Kluyvera (Kl),
  Flavobacterium (Fl), Pseudomonas (Ps) and Sphingobacterium (Sp). Right, partial
  metabolic reconstruction based on a theoretical (hemi)cellulose degradation pathway
  and uptake of sugars (intra - and extracellularly), in Bacteroidetes, using the
  contig_1110 genetic information. Abbreviations: Two-component system proteins (TCSP),
  ABC transporters (ABCT), TonB-dependent receptors (TBR), transketolases (TKT), xylose
  isomerase (XI) and xylulose kinase (XKN) and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Plus
  sign represent the regulation of the GH by the TCSP.'
