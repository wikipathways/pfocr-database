caption: Application of Gal-9 high-expressing ERCs in ConA-induced experimental autoimmune
  hepatitis in mice. ERCs are isolated from menstrual blood and transfected with GFP-Gal-9-LVs
  in vitro. After expansion, in vitro co-culture and in vivo administration, the results
  show that Gal-9 high-expressing ERCs effectively restore the liver function, ameliorate
  liver pathological damage, inhibit CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation and suppress
  Th1 and Th17 cell response in the hepatitis mice. Additionally, Gal-9 high-expressing
  ERCs also markedly enhance the level of IL-10, but reduce the levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α,
  and IL-4 in mouse sera and liver. In addition, it also indicates that Gal-9 high-expressing
  ERCs inhibit CD4+ T cell activation in vitro, and proves that this inhibition is
  associated with the inactivation of Lck/ZAP-70/LAT pathway. These results would
  provide a novel idea for the clinical treatment of AIH. (Created by using www.biorender.com
