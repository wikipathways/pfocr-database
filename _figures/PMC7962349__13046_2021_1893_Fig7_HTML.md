caption: Intervention of combined drugs on the TME. Rapamycin (RapA) is a mTOR inhibitor
  that inhibits tumour proliferation through anti-angiogenesis and can be enhanced
  in combination with cisplatin. Cisplatin combined with paclitaxel inhibits tumour
  invasion. The combination of everolimus and sunitinib can affect stromal cells and
  cancer cells in the TME. Antiangiogenic drugs (AADs) combined with carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  1A (CPT1) inhibitors significantly inhibited fatty acid oxidation (FAO) -induced
  cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Ginsenoside Rg3 combined with cisplatin can
  inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumour cells. Hedgehog (HH) signalling
  pathway inhibitors combined with bufalin can inhibit tumour proliferation. Tranilast
  can dow-regulate CAF activity, promote vascular normalization, and help docetaxel
  micelles (DTX-ms) reach tumour tissue through veins and kill tumour cells. Sorafenib
  combined with bufalin affects the tumour vascular microenvironment through targeting
  the mTOR/VEGF signalling pathway
