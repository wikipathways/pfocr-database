caption: Mechanism of ICI myocarditis. (a) IFN-γ is a pro-inflammatory factor, however,
  exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in the myocardium. Elevated levels of IFN-γ induce
  PD-L1 overexpression in cardiomyocytes when PD-L1 is deficient or when there is
  inflammation. This unique regulatory effect protects cardiomyocytes from T cell
  attack. PD-L1 inhibitors block this negative feedback regulation, leading to ICI
  myocarditis. Treg cells are suppressed by ICI and therefore lose their ability to
  suppress effector T cells. (b) Exosomes from ICI-treated macrophages can induce
  senescence-associated injury in cardiomyocytes by modulating the miR-34a-5p/PNUTS
  signaling pathway. ICI reduces serum 17β-estradiol concentrations, leading to downregulation
  of MANF/HSPA5 in cardiomyocytes. MANF and HSPA5 are essential for attenuating myocardial
  inflammation in ICI myocarditis. ANGPTL2 promotes the expression of chemokines such
  as CCL3/4/5 and CXCL10/11 leading to T cell recruitment. (c) The expansion of Temra
  cells, Th17 cells, etc. Was found on patients with ICI myocarditis, and they cause
  damage to cardiomyocytes through multiple pathways
