caption: G4C2 repeat expansion causes nucleocytoplasmic transport disruption through
  multiple proposed mechanisms including G4C2 RNA binding of RanGAP and stress granule
  recruitment of nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery. Transport disruption leads
  to a blockage in the translocation of autophagy-mediating transcription factors
  such as Mitf/TFEB to the nucleus in response to proteotoxic stress. Failure to induce
  autophagic flux leads to autophagy pathway disruption such as the accumulation of
  large, non-degradative lysosomes and MLBs. Loss of autophagic flux leads to accumulation
  of Ref(2)P/ p62 and ubiquitinated protein aggregates, leading to chronic protein
  stress signaling and eventually neuronal cell death.
