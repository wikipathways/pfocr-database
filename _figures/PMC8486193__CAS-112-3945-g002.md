caption: Schematic representation of cell death induced by ROS. A, Reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) can lead to activation of apoptosis. High levels of mitochondrial
  ROS can release cytochrome c into the cytosol from the mitochondrial intermembrane
  space. In the cytosol, cytochrome c engages apoptotic protease activating factor‐1
  (APAF1) and activates caspase‐9. Furthermore, as the extrinsic pathway, ROS can
  activate transmembrane death receptors, including Fas, tumor necrosis factor‐related
  apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL‐R1/2), Fas‐associated protein with death domain
  (FADD), and procaspase‐8 and ‐10 at the cytoplasmic surface to form death‐inducing
  signaling complexes (DISCs), subsequently triggering caspase‐8 and ‐10 activation,
  and apoptosis. Caspase‐8 and ‐10 also cleave Bid to produce truncated (t)Bid, which
  translocates to mitochondria, blocks Bcl‐2 and Bcl‐XL, and activates Bax and Bak.
  B, ROS can regulate autophagy induction in cells. Increased ROS leads to oxidation
  and inactivation of autophagy‐related (ATG)4. Inactivation of ATG4 results in promoting
  lipidation of ATG8, an essential step in autophagy. ROS also directly activate adenosine
  monophosphate (AMP)‐activated protein kinase (AMPK), upstream of mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR), to suppress its phosphorylation, resulting in the induction
  of autophagy
