caption: Glucose is transported into cells where it is catabolized by glycolysis to
  yield pyruvate. Pyruvate is then either converted into lactate (which can be excreted
  from the cell) or transported into mitochondria and metabolized into acetyl-CoA,
  fueling the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. NADH and FADH2, produced through glycolysis
  and the TCA cycle, are used by the mitochondrial electron transport chain for generating
  an electrochemical proton gradient, which drives oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)
  for ATP production. Since mitochondrial acetyl-CoA cannot enter the cytosol, citrate
  made in the TCA cycle can enter the cytosol and be converted to acetyl-CoA. This
  is then a substrate for protein acetylation. Glucose can also enter the pentose
  phosphate pathway via glucose-6-phosphate. This ultimately produces nucleotides,
  which in addition to being nucleic acid precursors, also generate S-adenosyl-methionine
  (SAM-e), a substrate for protein methylation. Note that shunting glucose to form
  cytosolic acetyl-CoA and SAM-e comes at the expense of oxidative phosphorylation.
