caption: Schematic illustration of exosome biogenesis and component. Differently from
  microvesicular bodies (MVBs) and apoptotic bodies, exosome derive from the endosomal
  pathway by evolution of the early and then late endosomes, and ultimately MVBs fuse
  with plasma membrane to release the exosomes. Exosome surface proteins include characteristic
  markers (CD9, CD81, CD63 and so on). Exosomes encapsulate various sorts of cell
  surface and intracellular proteins, coding and non-coding RNAs, DNA, amino acids,
  and some metabolites.
