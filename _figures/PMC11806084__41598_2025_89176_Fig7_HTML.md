caption: Cellular signal pathway diagram of hypothermia at 2 h after temperature intervention.
  On the one hand, hypothermia promoted the expression of Cleaved PINK1 at first,
  and then recruited Parkin onto the outer mitochondrial membrane, thereby decreasing
  the expression of VDAC3 as well as SQSTM/p62, and then increased the ratio of LC3B
  II/LC3B I and reduced the release of Cyt C via decreasing mPTP opening, subsequently
  reduced the expression of downstream proapoptotic proteins such as cleaved caspase3
  and caspase3 during OGD/R. Finally, hypothermia provided neuroprotective effects
  via alleviating apoptosis and promoting mitophagy. On the other hand, hypothermia
  increased the expression of Bcl-2 and Beclin-1 through disrupting the interaction
  between Bcl-2 and Beclin-1 during OGD/R, alleviating apoptosis and promoting mitophagy
  in the end. Thus, hypothermia provided neuroprotective effects via activating the
  PINK1/Parkin-VDAC3 signaling pathway
