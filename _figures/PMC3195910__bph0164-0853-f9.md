caption: A proposed pathway of the interaction between nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen
  sulphide (H2S) in endothelial cells during angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF) receptor activation increases NO production, leading to soluble guanylyl
  cyclase activation and increased cGMP synthesis. At the same time VEGF receptor
  activation triggers the generation of increased amounts of H2S; H2S inhibits cGMP-degrading
  phosphodiesterases leading to a further elevation of cGMP that in turn activates
  cGMP-dependent protein kinase and promotes angiogenesis. Because H2S increases the
  levels of intracellular calcium, VEGF-stimulated H2S production might enhance NO
  production. The relationship between these pathways and the canonical pathway of
  VEGF receptor activation-induced stimulation of the intracellular signalling axis
  of Raf, MAK and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 remains to be delineated
  in future studies. PDE, phosphodiesterase; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase.
