caption: Schematic representation summarizing the impacts of PEDV ORF3 on NF-κB and
  IFN-β signaling cascades. ORF3 is capable of interacting with IKBKB (IKKβ) with
  no effect on IKBKB and NEMO binding. IKBKB-mediated NF-κB promoter activity is upregulated
  in the presence of ORF3. On the other hand, ORF3 significantly down-regulates IKBKB-
  and Poly I:C-mediated IFN-β promoter activity. Further experiments are still needed
  to verify which signaling intermediates of type I IFN induction pathway are the
  target of ORF3.
