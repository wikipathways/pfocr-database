caption: The lymphotoxin (LT) pathway organizes multicellular interactions in the
  lymph node. B cell-derived LTα1β2 is recognized by the LTβ receptor (LTβR), which
  is expressed on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), and this interaction promotes
  the secretion of chemokines that recruit antigen presenting dendritic cells (DCs)
  and CD4+ T cells to facilitate the development of T helper cell responses,. In the
  germinal centre, miR-155 expression in B cells maintains LT expression. Ligation
  of inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS) on T cells to ICOS ligand (ICOSL) on B
  cells and the CD40–CD40 ligand (CD40L) interaction are also essential for the upregulation
  of LT on B cells that enables a germinal centre response ,. CXCL13, CXC chemokine
  ligand 13; CXCR5, CXC chemokine receptor 5; TCR, T cell receptor.
