caption: Molecular pathogenesis of Epstein-Barr virus-positive NK/T-cell lymphoma.
  EBV latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) activates the downstream signaling pathways,
  one of which is the NF-κB pathway. Together with PI3K/Akt pathways, NF-κB leads
  to the upregulation of survivin, which further inhibits cell apoptosis. Activation
  of JAK/STAT is associated with the upregulation of EZH2, which results in DNA methylation
  and gene transcription, and ultimately induces cell proliferation. Both the NF-κB
  pathway and JAK/STAT pathway upregulates the expression of PD-L1 on the surface
  of lymphoma cells and they escape from the immune surveillance of activated T cells.
  The deletion of chromosome 6q silences many tumor suppressor genes, such as PTPRK
  and PRDMI, which directly result in the activation of JAK/STAT and myc pathways.
  Moreover, gene mutation including P53, ECSIT, DDX3X are also involved in the oncogenesis
  of ENKL through the pathways mentioned above.
