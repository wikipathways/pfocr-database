caption: 'Asbestos is very cytotoxic to human primary mesothelial (HM) cells and causes
  DNA damage, as well as extensive necrotic cell death leading to the release of high-mobility
  group box 1 (HMGB1) into the extra cellular space. Secreted HMGB1 stimulates receptor
  for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and TLR4,
  expressed on neighboring inflammatory cells, mostly macrophages. HMGB1 release elicits
  macrophage accumulation and triggers the inflammatory response, with secretion of
  Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and especially tumor-necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). HMGB1 and
  TNF-α cooperate to promote the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway,
  which increases HM survival after asbestos exposure. This allows HM with asbestos-induced
  DNA damage to divide rather than die and, if key genetic alterations accumulate,
  to eventually develop into malignant mesothelioma (MM). HMGB1 is also highly expressed
  and secreted by MM cells, establishing an autocrine circuit that further influences
  their proliferation and survival. Potential targets and strategies for MM therapy
  that have been proposed based on recent studies are summarized in the figure. Color
  code: drugs that have not been tested (blue), drugs that gave positive results and
  are under further evaluation (green), and drugs that gave negative results (red).'
