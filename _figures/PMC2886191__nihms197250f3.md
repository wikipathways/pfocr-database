caption: Working model for how cholesterol binding to C99/APP is related to the amyloidogenic
  and non-amyloidogenic pathways for processing APP and for how the amyloidogenic
  pathway may be linked to cellular cholesterol reduction. Given that the transmembrane
  product of α-secretase cleavage of APP (C83) contains the sequence motif believed
  to be central to cholesterol binding by C99/APP (see ), C83 probably also binds
  cholesterol. In this case, elevated cholesterol levels would also result in raft
  localization of C83, subsequent γ-secretease cleavage of which would then release
  AICD and an apparently harmless peptide known as p3. Whether C99/APP-cholesterol
  complexes in the bulk (non-raft) membranes can be cleaved by α-secretase is unclear.
  It is known that both full length APP and C99 can serve as substrates for α-secretase
  cleavage in the bulk membrane().
