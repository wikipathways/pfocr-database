  cells were transfected with a vector (pCE-puro 3xFLAG-1) or a plasmid encoding the
  indicated 3xFLAG-tagged human ELOVL protein. (A) Total membrane proteins (0.1 μg
  protein) prepared from the transfected cells were treated with Endo H, separated
  by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies. (B) Total
  membrane proteins (20 μg protein) were incubated with the indicated acyl-CoA (50 μM)
  and 0.075 μCi [14C]malonyl-CoA for 30 min at 37 °C. After termination of the reactions,
  lipids were saponified, acidified, extracted, and separated by normal-phase TLC,
  followed by detection and quantification by a bioimaging analyzer BAS-2500. Values
  presented are FA levels and represent the mean ± SD from three independent experiments.

  for 30 min at 37 °C. After termination of the reactions, lipids were subjected to
