caption: Signaling pathways involved in the actions of the 12 herbs against OvCa.
  The 12 CHM herbs may exert anti-OvCa activity through (1) the regulation of apoptosis-related
  protein expression, which promotes OvCa cell apoptosis and inhibits the development
  of OvCa, (2) the promotion or inhibition of protein expression on the p53 signaling
  pathway, and (3) the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway by directly inhibiting
  NF-κB.
