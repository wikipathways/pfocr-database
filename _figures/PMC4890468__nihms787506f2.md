caption: 'Schematic representation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling
  pathway and crosstalk with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and
  the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. The mTOR protein is present in
  two different complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) that are activated through two different
  signaling cascades. MTORC1 is the principal target of rapamycin analogs (rapalogs),
  including everolimus, while mTORC2 seems not to be sensitive to these agents. Inhibition
  of mTORC1 by everolimus might cause a lack of inactivation of IRS-1, resulting in
  an upregulation by feedback loop mechanisms of the PI3K and MAPK pathways. This
  seems to be one of the main mechanisms that leads to the development of resistance
  against mTOR inhibitors. (#) Genes with germline mutations characterizing inherited
