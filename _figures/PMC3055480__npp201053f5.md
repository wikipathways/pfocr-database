caption: 'Hypothesized GABAergic molecular pathway of acquisition/consolidation, reconsolidation
  and extinction consolidation. After each critical procedural event (conditioning,
  reactivation, and extinction training, respectively; see ), there is a downregulation
  of GABAergic molecules within synapses, possibly in different areas of the amygdala,
  hippocampus and PFC, depending on the phenomenon. This leads to disinhibition of
  noradrenergic neurons, leading to elevated release of norepinephrine (NE). NE then
  binds to and activates β-adrenergic receptors. This triggers the intracellular activation
  of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (by G-proteins), which initiates the formation of
  cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP then triggers upregulation of Protein Kinase A (PKA). PKA
  enhances cell excitability by the phosphorylating of receptors and ion channels
  (such as K+ channels), causing them to close. PKA also facilitates AMPA receptor
  trafficking. In addition, PKA together with MAPK stimulates the phosphorylation
  of various transcription factors such as CREB, which are involved in gene transcription
  and the activation of immediate early genes (IEGs). The products of gene transcription
  are used for protein synthesis. The proteins are then used for the synaptic modifications
  necessary for stabilization of the new memory, reactivated memory or the extinction
  trace. Abbreviations: AMPA=α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate; ATP=adenosine
  triphosphate; cAMP=cyclic AMP; CREB=cAMP response element-binding protein; CS=conditioned
  stimulus; GABA=γ-amino butyric acid; MAPK=mitogen-activated protein kinase; PKA=Protein
  kinase A; US=unconditioned stimulus.'
