caption: Summary of the main metabolic markers’ changes in 3T3-L1 differentiating
  in LG-GAL condition compared to the HG condition. E and L surrounded letters stands,
  respectively, for early and late adipogenic phases. The filled arrow stands for
  a pathway that is higher in the LG-GAL condition compared to the HG condition. A
  discontinued arrow stands for a pathway that is lower in LG-GAL condition compared
  to the HG. Condition. IC and EC stand, respectively, for intracellular and extracellular
  media.
