caption: The renin-angiotensin system and its bypass loops and converging signaling
  pathways can be targeted at different points. The renin-angiotensin system (black)
  regulates blood pressure, stem cell differentiation, and tumor development. Bypass
  loops in the system involving cathepsins and chymase (green) provide redundancy,
  while convergent inflammatory and development signaling pathways (blue) have multiple
  roles and effects. Multiple points of the pathway can be targeted by specific inhibitors
  (red). ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme; ARBs, AT1R blockers; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; NSAIDS, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Adapted from Frontiers in
  Oncology []. Diagram recreated with BioRender.com, accessed on 1 November 2022.
