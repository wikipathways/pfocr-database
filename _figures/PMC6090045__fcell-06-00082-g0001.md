caption: Simplified general overview of glucose, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism
  in healthy endothelial cells. Glucose enters ECs via glucose transporters (GLUTs),
  which is converted to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by hexokinase (HK) at the expense
  of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). G6P can be converted to glycogen for storage or
  used in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The oxidative PPP generates
  reduced glutathione (GSH) and ribose-5-phosphate (R5P), which are used in the anti-oxidant
  defense and nucleotide synthesis, respectively. G6P can be further metabolized to
  fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) which is converted to uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine
  (UDP-GlcNAc), a substrate used for protein glycosylation, in the hexosamine biosynthesis
  pathway (HBP). F6P can also be converted to fructose-2,6-bisphophate (F2,6BP) by
  6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKF3B), the main isoform
  in ECs. F2,6BP is a positive allosteric regulator of phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1),
  which converts F6P to fructose-1,6-bisphophate (F1,6P2), which is further metabolized
  to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). G3P together with F6P can be used in the non-oxidative
  PPP by transketolase (TK) to eventually produce R5P. G3P can also undergo several
  conversion steps leading to the production of ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP)
  and pyruvate, which can be further metabolized to lactate. After being taken up
  by fatty acid (FA) transporters (FATPs) or through passive diffusion, FAs become
  metabolically activated by coupling to coenzyme A (CoA). For FA oxidation (FAO)
  to occur, FAs have to be imported into the mitochondria, which is carried out by
  the acyl-carnitine shuttle system. At the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) converts FA-CoAs into FA-carnitines which facilitates
  the transport of FAs across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) where they are
  converted back to FA-CoA by CPT2 (located in the IMM). FAO generates ATP and acetyl-CoA
  which is used in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). TCA intermediates are used
  for nucleotide synthesis or FA production, facilitated by fatty acid synthase (FAS).
  FAs can be stored in lipid droplets, converted to phospholipids to maintain the
  cell membrane or used for lipid modification of proteins. The amino acid (AA) glutamine
  is the most consumed AA in ECs. Once inside the cell, glutamine is converted to
  glutamate by glutaminase 1 (GLS1), which is further metabolized to α-ketoglutarate
  (αKG), a key intermediate in the TCA cycle. Through several metabolic steps, αKG
  is converted to oxaloacetic acid (OAA), which can be used for the generation of
  the AA aspartate. Aspartate can be used as a precursor for nucleotide synthesis
  or converted to the AA asparagine by asparagine synthetase (ASNS) using an ammonia
  group from glutamine thereby generating glutamate. Another important AA in ECs is
  arginine, which is used for the generation of the anti-atherogenic gaseous molecule
  nitric oxide using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as a cofactor.
