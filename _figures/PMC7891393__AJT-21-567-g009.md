caption: Summary of the mechanism of allograft survival involving the mTOR pathway
  regulated by DNA methylation. DNMT1 inhibits the expression of the mTOR upstream
  negative regulators to cause the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and P70S6K, and ultimately
  influence the immune response. The DNA methylation inhibitor decitabine restrains
  the expression of DNMT1 and the high activity of mTOR pathway, ultimately ameliorating
  T cell–mediated rejection and improving the allograft survival. DNMT, DNA methyltransferase;
  mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin

  renal transplantation by regulating the mTOR pathway.
