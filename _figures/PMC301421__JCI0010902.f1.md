caption: (a) Schematic showing branching in the early steps of the bile acid synthesis
  pathways. Individual enzymes and their catalyzed reactions are indicated. (b) The
  reaction catalyzed by the C27 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isolated in this report
  is shown for the bile acid synthesis pathway involving cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase.
papertitle: The bile acid synthetic gene 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase
  is mutated in progressive intrahepatic cholestasis.
