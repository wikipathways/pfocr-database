caption: 'Sensing of foreign nucleic acids. (A) TLR- and RLR-mediated sensing of foreign
  nucleic acids. Different types of cytoplasmic foreign RNA are recognized by RIG-I
  or MDA5 sensors followed by activation of MAVS and downstream TBK1-IRF signaling.
  In endosomes, RNA and CpG-DNA activate TLRs that result in one of the two signaling
  pathways involving TRIF or MYD88-IRAK. Activation of IRFs induces the expression
  of interferons and mRNA of pro-inflammatory factors. (B) Cytoplasmic and nuclear
  sensors of foreign DNA. Cytoplasmic DNA can be sensed by a number of sensors, including
  IFI16, cGAS, and AIM2. The first two factors activate the STING pathway that ultimately
  induces TBK1/IRF and interferon secretion. Upon recognition of cytoplasmic DNA,
  AIM2 induces caspase-1-dependent maturation of pro-IL-1β (pro-inflammatory response).
  A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1) and IFI16, among other factors, can participate in the sensing
  of foreign DNA in the nuclei of cells. IFI16 interferes with foreign nuclear DNA
  by epigenetic silencing, whereas A2B1 recognizes foreign DNA as well as activates
  and enhances innate antiviral responses. This picture was created in BioRender.
