caption: 'Constitutive low levels of IFN-β that are produced by most cell types “prime”
  type I IFNs producing cells for a robust type I IFNs production upon sensing “danger”
  signals such as cytosolic DNA and TLR ligands. Left panel: The “priming” involves
  (i) binding of the IFN-β to a cell surface type I IFN receptor; (ii) activation
  of the Jak-STAT pathway; (iii) formation of the ISGF3 transcription factor that
  includes the STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 proteins in the cytoplasm and translocation of
  ISGF3 ternary protein complex to the nucleus; and (iv) binding of the nuclear ISGF3
  transcription factor to interferon-stimulated response element(s) (ISREs) that are
  present in type I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These genes include IRF7 and STAT1.
  The binding activates transcription of the IRF7 and STAT1 genes, resulting in increased
  levels of IRF7 and STAT1 proteins. Right panel: Increased levels of IRF7 and STAT1
  proteins in “primed” cells potentiate an increased production of type I IFNs and
  the expression of ISGs such as cGAS and STING in response to sensing cytosolic DNA
  by cGAS, a cytosolic DNA sensor. cGAS activates the STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway to induce
  the expression of IFN-β. Similarly, toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands activate a
  signaling pathway that activates the IRF3 and IRF7. The IRF3 and IRF7 heterodimer
  induces the expression of IFN-β and IFN-α genes. Thus, “primed” cells produce higher
  levels of type I IFNs and activate a robust type I IFN response (express higher
  levels of ISGs).'
