caption: Pausing can serve as a mechanism to integrate multiple signaling events.
  TFs can stimulate initiation, elongation, or both. (A) When a signal responsive
  activator only stimulates elongation, for example, by recruiting P-TEFb, activation
  does not occur since polymerases were not initiated at the promoter prior to the
  TF binding. (B) If a signaling pathway and TF stimulates initiation only, then polymerases
  will pause proximally. Low levels of pause escape, possibly stimulated by Mediator-dependent
  P-TEFb recruitment, establishes a basal level of transcription. (C) When both signals
  are active, high levels of initiation and pause escape lead to robust transcriptional
  activation. By altering the level of input from either signaling pathway, the cell
  can fine tune the transcription levels of genes.
