caption: Metabolic pathways of putrescine degradation and uric acid recycling in strains
  C11 and B02. Green boxes represent EC numbers of enzymes annotated for strains C11,
  B02 and Y. lipolytica. White boxes represent EC numbers of enzymes that are not
  annotated. EC 6.3.4.5* is annotated for strains C11 and B02 but is not present in
  Y. lipolytica. This figure was constructed using information provided by KEGG pathway
  maps 00220, 00230, 00330 and 00410 []
