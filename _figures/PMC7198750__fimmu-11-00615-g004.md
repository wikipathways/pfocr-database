caption: Activation of the cGAS-STING pathway can induce type-I interferonopathies
  or adaptive immune deficiency. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) can be stimulated
  by cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), agonist compounds and mutants. (A) STING activation
  in dendritic cells (DCs). When exposed to type-I interferon (IFN), neutrophils can
  release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). DCs can internalize self-DNA and
  trigger the cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway to secrete type-I IFN,
  which activates DC maturation. Type-I IFN in turn induces mitochondrial stress and
  decreases ATP production that increases the pH of lysosomes. Incomplete degradation
  of mitochondria leads to accumulation of mtDNA in the cytosol and activates STING.
  Mature DCs can present antigen and co-activate signaling to prime T cell-mediated
  adaptive immune responses. (B) STING activation in T cells. IFNα/β enhances differentiation
  of T helper 2 (Th2) cells but suppresses differentiation of Th1 cells. Activation
  of STING can induce mitotic delay and unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to
  reduced proliferation and promotion of apoptosis. All of the actions stated above
  suppress the functions of Th1 cells and lead to suppression of adaptive immune responses
  (Red arrows represent mechanisms limiting cellular immune responses, and black arrows
  represent mechanisms promoting cellular immune responses).
