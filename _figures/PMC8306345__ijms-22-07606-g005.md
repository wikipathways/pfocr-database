caption: Simplified apoptotic and NETosis pathways in neutrophils. Normal apoptotic
  pathway involves neutrophil degranulation and phagocytosis of pathogens, initiating
  neutrophil apoptosis. The apoptotic neutrophil is then phagocytosed by macrophages
  promoting inflammatory resolution. CF neutrophils are biased towards undergoing
  NETosis in response to bacteria and other inflammatory stimuli, rather than the
  apoptotic pathway. In response to infectious stimuli, CF neutrophils expel NETs
  containing DNA, histone fragments and various pro-inflammatory neutrophil contents,
  such as neutrophil elastases which can directly or indirectly, through cell interactions,
  induce inflammation. Macrophages interact with the NETs, resulting in stimulation
  of Th17 cells, leading to neutrophil influx and further inflammation. Progressive
  inflammation triggered by sustained NET formation and release of toxic contents
  can damage the lung architecture.
