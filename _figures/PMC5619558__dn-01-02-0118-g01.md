caption: Proposed signaling pathways associated with the gastrinreleasing peptide
  receptor (GRPR) in the central nervous system. Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) released
  from synaptic terminals binds to the Gq protein-coupled GRPR at postsynaptic sites.
  GRPR activation induces an increase in [Ca2+] and triggers activation of the phospholipase
  C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, which, in turn, can activate mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK). The dopamine D1/D5 receptor (D1R) is coupled to Gs protein
  (Gs) and adenylyl cyclase (AC) activation. The D1R-induced cAMP signal might be
  synergistically potentiated by [Ca2+]-induced stimulation of [Ca2+]-responsive types
  of AC, leading to increased activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Reproduced from
