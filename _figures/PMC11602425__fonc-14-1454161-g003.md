caption: Metabolic reprogramming drives MASLD progression. In MASLD and its more advanced
  form, MASH, lipid toxicity and insulin resistance create a microenvironment conducive
  to HCC development. Activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses, along
  with cytokine release and CD8+ T cell infiltration, promotes the expression of genes
  associated with cell proliferation, migration, and survival. Key regulatory molecules
  such as SOCS3 and PTEN are downregulated, failing to inhibit oncogenic signaling
  pathways in liver cancer. A high-fat diet and excessive carbohydrate intake exacerbate
  pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles and increase DNL in the liver, promoting lipid
  peroxidation and ultimately leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer
