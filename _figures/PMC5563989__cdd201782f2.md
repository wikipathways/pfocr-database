caption: The apoptosis regulatory network under ER stress. Under acute or sustained
  ER stress, the UPR actively promotes apoptosis through the regulation of proapoptotic
  proteins of the BCL-2 family, increased proteotoxicity and ROS. IRE1α activation
  engages the degradation of several ER-localized RNAs through RIDD, having a dual
  role in apoptosis regulation. Degradation of several inhibitory miRNAs leads to
  the activation of caspase-2, which in turn cleaves and activates the BH3-only protein
  BID triggering the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Conversely, degradation of
  the DR5 mRNA results in the inhibition of caspase-8, repressing cell death. JNK
  is also activated downstream of IRE1α, inducing cell death through BCL-2 phosphorylation
  and inhibition. Activation of PERK leads to the phosphorylation of eIF2α and global
  protein synthesis arrest. Under these conditions, ATF4 is selectively translated
  and, together with CHOP, transcriptionally activates several BH3-only proteins,
  engaging the mitochondria. Moreover, the ATF4/CHOP complex resumes protein synthesis
  through the upregulation of the GADD34 phosphatase and other genes, leading to ATP
  depletion, ROS and finally cell death. ATF4, activating transcription factor 4;
  DR5, death receptor 5; GADD34, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34;
  JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; RIDD, regulated IRE1-dependent decay
