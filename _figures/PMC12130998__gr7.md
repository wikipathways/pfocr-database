caption: A supposed mechanism on the dual role of pB318L in viral replication. pB318L
  can function as a typical GGPPS that produces isoprenoids [such as geranyl pyrophosphate
  (GPP), FPP and GGPP] that may act as the isoprenoid tail of the coenzyme Q in mitochondria.
  On the other hand, as a nuclear import protein harboring a unique N-terminal NLS,
  one of its potential functions is the inhibition of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3
  (ISGF3) complex translocation to antagonize JAK-STAT signaling pathway
