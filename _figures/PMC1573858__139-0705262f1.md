caption: AT1 receptor signal transduction pathways that result in transcriptional
  NA neuromodulation (a) and increased firing rate (b) in neuronal cultures. (a) AT1
  receptor activation increases the transcription of TH, D-βH and the NAT via a PLC-dependent
  Ras–Raf–MAP kinase pathway. This induces Fos and Jun by increasing c-fos and c-jun
  gene expression. PKC and PI3K mediate FRK and JNK activity, respectively, which
  in turn phosphorylate Fos and Jun, resulting in transactivation of the AP1 transcription
  complex. Interaction of the AP1 complex with AP1 binding sites in the promotor regions
  of TH, D-βH and the NAT results in transcription of these genes. A PI3K–PKB/Akt
  pathway (highlighted in red) uniquely mediates the augmented transcriptional NA
  neuromodulation in SHR neurons. Increased AP1 nuclear binding in SHR neurons may
  be due to enhanced PI3K-mediated JNK activity, resulting in subsequent increases
  in Jun phosphorylation and AP1 binding. (b) AT1 receptor activation inhibits IKv
  and IA, and stimulates ICa resulting in increased neuronal firing rate via PLC-mediated
  activation of PKC. PLC also activates CaMKII, which contributes to IKv inhibition.
  An additional signaling pathway that utilizes PI3K (pathway highlighted in red)
  mediates the enhanced Ang II-induced neuronal firing response in SHR neurons. Ang,
  angiotensin; AP1, activating protein 1; AT1R, angiotensin type 1 receptor; [Ca2+]i,
  intracellular calcium; CaMKII, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; DAG,
  diacylglycerol; D-βH, dopamine β-hydroxylase; FRK, Fos-regulating kinase; IA, transient
  A type K+ current; ICa, total Ca2+ current; IKv, delayed rectifier K+ current; IP3,
