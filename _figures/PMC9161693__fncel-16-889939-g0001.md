caption: Schematic diagram of astrocytic Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways discussed
  in this review. The action of active GTP-bound Gαi and GTP-bound Gαo stimulates
  or inhibits transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmAC) that produces cAMP. The tmAC may
  also be controlled indirectly via store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). To maintain
  Ca2+ homeostasis in the ER, SOCE is orchestrated through the interaction between
  store-operated plasma membrane calcium channels, called Orai or transient receptor
  potential (TRP) channel, and can stimulate SERCA pump activity once Ca2+ levels
  fall below the threshold levels. In particular, this mechanism is generated when
  Ca2+ stores in the ER are depleted upon activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) receptor via Gαq-phospholipase C (PLC)-IP3 signal transduction pathway. In
  turn, the DAG produced from PIP2 hydrolysis can also catalyze cAMP synthesis. Another
  activator of cAMP is Ca2+ sensitive soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). cAMP itself
  and cAMP-dependent proteins (Epac PKA, and HCN channels) can differently transmit
  Ca2+ signals supporting various astrocytic functions including gliotransmission,
  glycogen metabolism or synaptic homeostasis.
