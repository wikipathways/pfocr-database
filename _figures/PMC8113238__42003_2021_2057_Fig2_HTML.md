caption: 'a Complete, reconstructed metabolism of S. silvanidophilus, as inferred
  from genomic data. Enzymes and arrows in gray were missing in the genome annotation.
  Dashed arrows indicate transport processes without annotated transporters, but which
  are expected to occur based on observed phenotypes. b Schematic diagram of the shikimate
  pathway in S. silvanidophilus. Dashed arrows represent multiple enzymatic steps.
  Red boxes: enzyme present in the genome. White box: enzymes not annotated in the
  genome, but reaction probably catalyzed by another enzyme.'
