caption: Processes involved in generation of the T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment
  phenotype. Innate immune sensing of tumors appears to be dominantly mediated by
  the host STING pathway, which results in type I IFN production and activation of
  Batf3-lineage DCs. This DC subset cross-presents antigens to CD8+ T cells, which
  once activated can be recruited into the inflamed tumor microenvironment and contribute
  to tumor control. The same STING pathway engagement likely leads to production of
  CXCL9 and CXCL10, which are the key chemokines that support effector T cell recruitment.
