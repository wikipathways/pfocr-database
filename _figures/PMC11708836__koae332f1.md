caption: The model demonstrates how sorbitol modulates malate accumulation in apples
  through the linker histone MdH1.1. MdH1.1 functions as a transcription factor that
  responds to sorbitol and activates the expression of the transcription factor MdMYB73.
  Subsequently, MdMYB73 enhances the expression of MdH1.1, further strengthening the
  sorbitol signaling pathway. This positive feedback mechanism promotes the expression
  of Ma1 encoding the aluminum-activated malate transporter MdALMT9 (Ma1), facilitating
  the transport of malate into the vacuole across the tonoplast. This regulatory loop
  also connects Ma1-mediated malate transport with vacuole acidification via P-ATPase
  MdPH5 and the interaction between MdCIbHLH1 and MdMYB73, along with the transcriptional
  activation of MdMYB73. Reprinted from Hu et al. (2024), Figure 11
