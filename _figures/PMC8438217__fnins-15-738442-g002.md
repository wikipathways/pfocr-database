caption: Exosome-mediated physiological cross-talk of neural cells. All major types
  of neural cells including neurons, microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and
  neural stem cells can secrete and take up exosomes. The communication of exosomes
  among neural cells can mediate various physiological processes in the CNS. The solid
  black arrows in the figure represent the direction of exosome transmission, and
  some of the identified functions for the pathway are labeled on the side. The release
  of exosomes is mainly modulated by neurotransmitter signals, pathogen components,
  inflammatory factors, and nutritional stimulation (ATP). These are implied by the
  dotted arrow in the figure. Exosomes secreted by neural cells can cross the BBB
  and mediate the communication between CNS and peripheral tissue, which makes exosomes
  have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment.
