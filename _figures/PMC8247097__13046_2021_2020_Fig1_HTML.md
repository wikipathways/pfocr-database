caption: The canonical inflammasome and non-canonical inflammasome pathway in pyroptosis.
  The canonical inflammasome is assembled in response to exogenous pathogens and endogenous
  damage by intracellular sensor proteins, including NLRP1b, NLRC4, NLRP3, AIM2 and
  Pyrin. The canonical inflammasomes recruit pro-caspase 1 through inflammasome adaptor
  protein ASC, leading self-cleavage and activation of caspase 1. Active caspase 1
  cleaves pro-inflammatory cytokines pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, leading to maturation of
  IL-1β, IL-18. Active caspase 1 cleaves GSDMD protein at the middle linker, liberating
  the cytotoxic N-terminus to form pore on plasma membrane, which allows the release
  of mature IL-1β, IL-18. In non-canonical pathway, LPS directly binds to murine pro-caspase
  11 or its human homologs pro-caspase 4 and 5, leading activation of caspase 11/4/5.
  In non-canonical inflammasome pathway, cleavage of GSDMD is executed by active caspase
  11 or caspase 4 and 5 upon direct binding of cytosolic LPS. Chemotherapy drugs could
  induce pyroptosis in epithelial cells through activating mitochondrial death machinery
  and caspase 3. In this case, GSDME is cleaved by active caspase 3. GSDME-N in turn
  activates NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to activation of caspase 1/GSDMD cascade,
  which promotes maturation of IL-1β, IL-18. Gasdermins could be cleaved by Lymphocyte-derived
  granzymes proteases, unleashing the pore-formation ability to trigger pyroptosis
  of cancer cells
