caption: The mammalian circadian clock. (A) The mammalian circadian clock is comprised
  of circadian input pathways, such as the light input pathway via the retinohypothalamic
  tract (RHT), the central clock located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus
  (SCN), the circadian output pathways including the neuroendocrine and autonomic
  nervous systems (grey arrows) and peripheral clocks in all tissues studied. (B)
  A simplified model of the molecular clock. Solid lines show direct regulation of
  the positive and negative feedback loops by core circadian genes Bmal1, Clock, Ck1δ
  and ε, Cry, Naps2, Per, Rev-erbα and β, as well as Rorα and γ. The dashed lines
  show indirect regulation of Rev-erbα and β by PER. The molecular clock also targets
  clock-controlled genes (CCGs) that regulate diverse cellular processes. The first-order
  CCGs are controlled by the molecular clock directly at the transcriptional level.
