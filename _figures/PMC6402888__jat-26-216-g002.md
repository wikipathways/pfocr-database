caption: Possible intracellular and extracellular functions of FABP4FABP4 is abundant
  in the cytosolic fraction of adipocytes and can bind one long-chain fatty acid (FA),
  including palmitic acid (PA), stearic acid (SA), oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid
  (LA) or α-linolenic acid (ALA). FABP4 facilitates the transport of FAs to specific
  organelles in the cell such as the mitochondrion, peroxisome, endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) and nucleus, regulates enzyme activity, and stores excess FA as lipid droplets
  in adipocytes. LA-bound, but not SA- or OA-bound, FABP4 can be moved into the nucleus
  by unmasking of the nuclear localization signal (NLS). The protein-protein interactions
  of FABP4 with hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and comparative gene identification-58
  (CGI-58), a potent co-activator of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), regulate
  intracellular triglyceride hydrolysis, and FABP4 is secreted from adipocytes in
  a non-classical pathway associated with lipolysis. FABP4 in macrophages inhibits
  the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)-liver X receptor α (LXRα)-ATP-binding
  cassette A1 (ABCA1) pathway and induces inflammatory responses through activation
  of the inhibitor of nuclear kappa B kinase (IKK)-nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)
  and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-activator protein-1 (AP-1) pathways. FABP4 is
  ectopically induced in injured arterial endothelial cells (ECs). Macrophages and
  ECs can also secrete FABP4. Secreted FABP4 may act as a carrier of LA and ALA, essential
  polyunsaturated FAs, to organs because of high affinities for FABP4 under normal
  conditions. Circulating FABP4 may affect several responses in target cells, including
  macrophages, ECs, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), adipocytes and other cells, through
  unidentified receptor-mediated effects in bound FA-dependent and -independent manners
  and/or possible internalization of FABP4 into the cell. Obesity and increased visceral
  fat promote oxidative stress. An oxidative stress condition can induce conformation
  change of the FABP4 structure and decrease affinity of most of the FAs, except for
  PA, for FABP4. Under a specific condition such as obesity-induced oxidative stress,
  PA would have relatively high affinity for FABP4, leading to PA-dependent inflammatory
  responses through unidentified receptors of PA-bound FABP4 and/or delivery of PA
  to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).Receptor*, an unidentified receptor of non-specific
  FA-bound FABP4. Receptor†, an unidentified receptor of specific PA-bound FABP4.
