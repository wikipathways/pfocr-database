caption: A Microtubules (in blue) are dynamic polymers that form a radial cytoskeleton
  (left), a bipolar mitotic spindle (center) and the linear axoneme of cilia (right).B
  Tubulin is a GTPase. The predominant tubulin species in solution has GTP bound to
  the β-subunit. Hydrolysis of GTP by the dimer in solution is slow. Hydrolysis is
  accelerated by incorporation of the GTP-dimer into the microtubule lattice. To enter
  the lattice, the GTP-dimer first associates transiently with the end before becoming
  strongly bound; the dissociation of the strongly bound GTP-dimer is slow and its
  hydrolysis occurs with a delay, resulting in a cap of GTP-tubulin at the end. The
  cap stabilizes the microtubule against depolymerization. If the cap is lost and
  GDP-tubulin is exposed at the end, depolymerization is rapid, thereby completing
  the hydrolysis cycle. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) up- and down-regulate
  all steps in this pathway, thereby allowing cells exquisite control of their microtubule
  cytoskeleton.
