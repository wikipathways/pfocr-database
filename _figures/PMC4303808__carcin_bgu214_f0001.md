caption: 'MPG DNA glycosylase initiated base excision repair pathway. (A) Outline
  of base excision repair subpathways, initiated by MPG DNA glycosylase, acting on
  two different damaged bases in DNA: εA (full circle) and Hx (full triangle). The
  structures of the lesions are presented. (B) Outline of the DNA repair assay. A
  radiolabeled synthetic short double-stranded DNA carrying a site-specific lesion
  (marked by a full square) was incubated with a protein extract. The action of MPG
  followed by alkali treatment caused a nick at the lesion site (Hx or εA), which
  enabled subsequent quantification of reaction products by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
  under denaturing conditions and phosphorimaging. Asterisks represent the radiolabeled
  DNA terminus.'
