caption: Pathways between TAMs and CRC. The interaction between CRC and TAMs relies
  on a complex molecular network. Tumor cells release molecules such as IL10 and Succinate,
  activating STAT3 pathway and PI3K pathway in macrophages. Consequently, pro-tumor
  cytokines, including IL6, CXCL8, and TGFB2, are secreted out of TAMs and targeted
  to their receptor on the surface of CRC cells. Specific inhibitors aiming at essential
  pathway points effectively reverse the pro-tumor process, typically miR-221-3P inhibiting
  STAT3 pathway by silencing JAK3. Besides, WNT5A and NFKB1 contribute to the network,
  and each pathway is not independent but interconnected. The secreted pro-tumor cytokines
  cause the response of JAK2, TNF, and NFKB1, serving CRC. A similar network can be
  seen both in TAMs and CRC, and suppressors inside it may have a dual function.
