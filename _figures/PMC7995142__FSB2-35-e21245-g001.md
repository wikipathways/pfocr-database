caption: 'Mechanism for lymphopenia in SARS and COVID‐19 patients. Decreased amount
  of lymphocytes in circulation causes lymphopenia (central violet rectangle). This
  symptom can be found in SARS and COVID‐19 patients as well as in the patients with
  sepsis, severe trauma, extensive burns, major surgery (top part). These circumstances
  trigger a stress response to stimulate the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis.
  Both an excessive amount of endogenous glucocorticoids (green arrows) and exogenous
  glucocorticoids (orange arrows) cause lymphocytes to move out from the peripheral
  circulation and apoptosis of lymphocytes (central vertical part). Two signaling
  pathways induce apoptosis: mitochondrial pathway and death receptor pathway (left‐hand
  lower part). The activation of p53 can inhibit the replication of SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2,
  and also induce apoptosis in lymphocytes (right‐hand lower part). Consequently,
  lymphocyte apoptosis brings about the damage of the immune system and immune suppression
  (bottom part). ACE2, the angiotensin I‐converting enzyme 2; TACE, the TNF‐α‐converting
  enzyme; TMPRSS2, the cellular serine protease.'
