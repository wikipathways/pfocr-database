caption: The co-expression network between DEGs and DELs in HCC. a The co-expression
  network of metabolic pathway containing 626 connections between 119 DELs and 55
  DEGs with absolute r value larger than 0.8. The orange boxes represent DEGs, and
  the blue hexagons represent the DELs. The edges between DEGs and DELs indicate the
  potential correlation, of which the color and the thickness standing for different
  correlation coefficient were marked within the frame. b The co-expression network
  of cell cycle pathway containing 52 connections between 28 DELs and 12 DEGs. c The
  co-expression network of chemical carcinogenesis pathway containing 113 connections
  between 59 DELs and 11 DEGs. d The co-expression network of complementary and coagulation
  cascades pathway containing 179 connections between 58 DELs and 10 DEGs
