caption: Dysregulation of NCC and TRPM6 common regulatory pathways. Inactivation of
  NCC frequently gives rise to secondary effects such as secondary hyperaldosteronism
  and insulin resistance in Gitelman patients. Under normal conditions, aldosterone
  (top) modulates NCC activation via MR/SGK1/NEDD4‐2 and WNK/SPAK axes. To regulate
  DCT Mg2+ reabsorption, aldosterone potentially acts on TRPM6/7 directly, although
  the mechanisms remain undetermined. Insulin (bottom) orchestrates NCC phosphorylation
  pathway by the PI3K/mTORC2 pathway while it modulates TRPM6 activity through the
  PI3K/Akt pathway. In Na+‐wasting disorders, hormonal disturbances will possibly
  dysregulate these signalling pathways, inhibiting TRPM6/7 activity in the process
  and ultimately resulting in hypomagnesaemia. Akt, protein kinase B; IR, insulin
  receptor; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; mTORC2, mechanistic target of rapamycin
  complex 2; P, phosphorylation; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3‐kinases; SGK1, serum/glucocorticoid‐regulated
  kinase 1; TRPM7, transient receptor potential melastatin 7; Ub, ubiquitination
