caption: Biosynthesis and breakdown of I3M. Indole glucosinolates are derived from
  Trp, with CYP79B2 (At4g39950), CYP79B3 (At2g22330), CYP83B1 (At4g31500), C-S lyase
  (At2g20610), UGT74B1 (At1g24100), and AtST5a (At5g74100) being key enzymes in the
  biosynthetic pathway. Indole glucosinolate hydrolysis depends on myrosinases TGG1
  (At5g26000) and TGG2 (At5g25980), which have redundant function. ESP (At1g54040)
  directs the breakdown of I3M toward IAN rather than I3C.
