caption: The role of MALT1 in antigen receptor-stimulated activation of NF-κB pathway.
  The engagement of antigen receptors results in the activation of protein kinase
  C (PKCβ or PKCΘ), which leads to phosphorylation and a conformational change of
  the scaffold adaptor protein CARMA1. This change allows the formation of a signaling
  complex consisting of CARMA1, Bcl-10, and MALT1, and enables recruitment of TRAF6
  and Nemo, leading to the stimulation of NF-κB and B cell and T cell activation.
