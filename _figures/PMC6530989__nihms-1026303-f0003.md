caption: Potential mechanisms by which consumption of fructose promotes the development
  of metabolic syndrome The initial phosphorylation of dietary fructose in the liver
  is largely catalysed by fructokinase C (a), which is not regulated by hepatic energy
  status (,). This results in unregulated fructose uptake and metabolism by the liver.
  The excess substrate leads to increased de novo lipogenesis (DNL) (b) (,). DNL increases
  the intra-hepatic lipid supply directly (–), via synthesis of fatty acids (c), and
  indirectly by inhibiting fatty acid oxidation (d) (,). Increased intra-hepatic lipid
  content promotes very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production and secretion (e)
  (). This leads to increased levels of circulating triglyceride (TG) and low-density
  lipoprotein particles (dyslipidaemia) (f) (), risk factors for cardiovascular disease
  (CVD) (g). Increased levels of hepatic lipid may also promote hepatic insulin resistance
  () by increasing levels of diacylglycerol, which may activate novel protein kinase
  C and lead to serine phosphorylation (serine P) of the insulin receptor and insulin
  receptor substrate 1 and impaired insulin action (h) (). Because of selective insulin
  resistance, DNL is even more strongly activated in the insulin resistant liver (i)
  (), which has the potential to generate a vicious cycle (circular arrows) that would
  be perpetuated by sustained fructose consumption. This cycle would be expected to
  further exacerbate VLDL production and secretion via increased intrahepatic lipid
  supply (). Hepatic insulin resistance also promotes VLDL production/secretion (j)
  by increasing apolipoprotein B availability (,) and apolipoprotein CIII synthesis
  () and by up-regulating microsomal TG transfer protein expression (MTP) (). This
  exacerbates and sustains exposure to circulating TG, leading to intramyocellular
  lipid accumulation (k) (), impaired insulin signalling and whole-body insulin resistance
  (l) (). The fructokinase-catalysed phosphorylation of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate,
  which results in conversion of adenosine triphosphate to adenosine monophosphate
  and a depletion of inorganic phosphate, leads to uric acid production via the purine
  degradation pathway (m) (,–). High levels of uric acid are associated and may contribute
  to increased risk for development of fatty liver (n) and CVD (o) (–). Fructose exposure
  in the intestine (p) (,) and liver (q) () and fructose-induced increases of visceral
  adipose (r) may promote inflammatory responses (,) that further promote liver lipid
  accumulation (s) and/or impair hepatic insulin signalling (t) ().
