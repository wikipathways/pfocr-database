caption: During preimplantation, the outer blastomeres of the embryo form an outer
  epithelial trophectoderm (TE) that envelopes the remaining blastomeres, the inner
  cell mass (ICM). The Hippo pathway plays important roles in this cell fate specification.
  The outer cells have an outside exposed surface and are composed of plasma membranes
  with apical and basolateral domains, whereas inner cells are completely surrounded
  by outer cells. (A) In the outer cells, the nuclear localization of YAP and TEAD4
  regulates specification of the TE lineage through activation of the TE-specific
  genes such as Gata3, Cdx2, and Eomes. (B) In the inner cells, cell–cell adhesions
  influence Hippo signaling. Activated Hippo pathway impairs YAP nuclear localization
  in the ICM lineage, thereby limiting TEAD4 transcription and abrogating expression
  of other TE-specific genes. Activation of Oct4 and Nanog maintains pluripotency
  and generates the ICM in mouse embryos. The yellow spheres indicate phosphorylation
  of target proteins by kinase.
