caption: Illustrative representation of crosstalk among Ca2+signaling components under
  drought-stressed condition, Drought stress-mediated [Ca2+]cyt fluctuations activate
  Ca2+-interacting partners and provide response against the stress through varying
  mechanisms like CaM- and CAMTA-mediated gene expressions through several TFs conferring
  drought tolerance, CBL-CIPK interaction controls water loss through stomatal closure,
  PYR/PYL/RCAR regulates ABA pathway critical in stress-management. The solid arrow
  represents direct activation; the dotted arrow represents indirect activation via
  some intermediates. CaM, calmodulins; CAMTA, calmodulin-binding transcription activators;
  CIPK, CBL-interacting protein kinases.
