caption: Glucocorticoid hormones, secreted as a result of a stressful event, enhance
  the consolidation of behavioral responses, including memories related to the event.
  Until recently, the underlying mechanisms of these effects were unknown. Recent
  work of the Reul group at the University of Bristol shows that glucocorticoids act
  by binding to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) that interact with the NMDA receptor-activated
  ERK1/2/MSK1-Elk-1 signaling pathway enhancing the formation of epigenetic modifications
  (i.e., the serine10 phosphorylation and lysine14 acetylation in histone H3 (H3S10p-K14ac))
  and the induction of the neuroplasticity-associated immediate-early genes c-Fos
  and Egr-1 in sparsely distributed mature dentate gyrus neurons. Evidence has been
  accumulating that these signaling, epigenetic, and genomic phenomena are of critical
  importance for the consolidation of memories related to the endured stressful event.
