caption: The main metabolic pathways in macrophages. In the cytosol, glucose is converted
  into L-lactate by glycolysis, in which HK, PFK1 and PK are key enzymes. In the progress
  of glycolysis, glucose-6-P can be shunted to PPP pathway sustaining pentose phosphates
  and NADPH production. Pentose phosphates are used for the synthesis of amnio acid
  and nucleotide, while NADPH contributes to the production of ROS and NO. Pyruvate
  is induced to lactate in hypoxic conditions, whereas decarboxylated into acetyl-CoA
  within the mitochondria in normoxic conditions. Here, acetyl-CoA enters into the
  TCA cycle, providing reducing agents to the ETC through OXPHOS to generate energy.
  Citrate, a metabolite in TCA, participates in fatty acid synthesis when exported
  to the cytoplasm. Acetyl-CoA produced from FAS can be transferred into mitochondria
  and take part in the FAO. In M1 macrophages, two breakpoints cause the production
  of itaconate and the accumulation of succinate that induces HIF-1α mediated upregulation
  of glycolysis and IL-1β production.What’s more, the production of NO inhibits ETC.
  M2 macrophages can obtain enough ATP from OXPHOS through the TCA cycle. As for energy
  gain, FAO is essential. HK, hexokinase; Glucose 6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; Fructose
