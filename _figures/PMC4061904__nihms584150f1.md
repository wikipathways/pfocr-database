caption: Shown in schematic format is the pathway leading to glucosylceramide. De
  novo synthesis of ceramide begins with the condensation of palmitate and serine
  to form 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine (not depicted). The latter is reduced to dihydrosphingosine
  followed by acylation to yield dihydroceramide, which in turn generates ceramide
  via the action of desaturases. Ceramide is at the hub of several pathways, as it
  can be transformed into sphingomyelin, sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate,
  ceramide 1-phosphate or glucosylceramide. As noted in the text, glucosylceramide
  (and lactylceramide) foster cellular cholesterol accumulation and reduce cholesterol
  export. D-DMPP inhibits these actions of glucosylceramide, retarding cholesterol
  accumulation and enhancing cholesterol export via transporter molecules such as
  SR-B1, CD36 and ABCA1. CDase, ceramidase; CerS, (dihydro)ceramide synthase; CK,
