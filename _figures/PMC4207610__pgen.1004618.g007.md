caption: A) At the 16-cell stage, when ICM progenitors first arise, HIPPO pathway
  members regulate expression of TE (Cdx2) and ICM (Sox2) genes in parallel. At this
  stage, OCT4 and NANOG are still expressed ubiquitously. B) In the blastocyst, Sox2
  expression is restricted to EPI cells by FGFR/MEK signaling. In EPI cells, SOX2
  helps promote expression of Fgf4, which signals to neighboring cells to induce expression
  of PE genes. In PE cells, MAPK promotes PE gene expression in an Oct4-dependent
  manner , , , and represses expression of Sox2 and Nanog in PE cells either directly
  or indirectly. C) In the late blastocyst, SOX2 helps maintain expression of pluripotency
  genes, and FGF4, or other signals from EPI, maintain expression of PE genes in neighboring
  cells.
