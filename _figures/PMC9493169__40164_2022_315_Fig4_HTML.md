caption: When SARS-CoV2 enters the respiratory tract and causes an infection, alveolar
  macrophages may engulf viral particles or cellular debris. Viral single-stranded
  RNA (ssRNA) binds to Toll-like receptor7/8 (TLR7/8) and then activates Bruton tyrosine
  kinase (BTK) and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88). For one thing,
  activation of the BTK-dependent nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway leads to
  the production of a series of pro-inflammatory factors and chemokines, which are
  called cytokine storms. Among these, IL-8 can recruit more neutrophils in the late
  phase of severe coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19 infection. BTKi can inhibit TLR-dependent
  NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby preventing cytokine production. For another, during
  severe COVID-19, the accumulated NLR family pyrin domain containing 3(NLRP3)inflammasome
  is phosphorylated by BTK, thus promoting its oligomerization and assembly into an
  inflammasome (pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β). BTKis inhibit inflammasome-mediated process
