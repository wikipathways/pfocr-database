caption: Upon DNA viral infection, OASL inhibits type I IFN induction via the cGAS-STING
  pathway by binding to cGAS and inhibiting cGAS enzymatic activity. During the RNA
  virus infection, human OASL promotes the type I IFNs by binding to RIG-I and enhancing
  the sensitivity of RIG-I signaling. On the other hand, mouse OASL1 negatively regulates
  type I IFN production by binding to IRF7 mRNA and repressing the translation of
  IRF7. Oasl1 deficient DCs produce potent amounts of type I IFN in response to IAV
  infection. Increased type I IFN limits the proliferation and activation of ILC2s.
  Especially reduced amphiregulin production from ILC2s impairs tissue repair but
  increases lung inflammation.AHR, airway hyperreactivity; IL, interleukin; IFNAR,
