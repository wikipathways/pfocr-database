caption: During the early metabolic response to sepsis, tubular epithelial cells might
  undergo a metabolic switch from oxidative phospharylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis
  via the Akt/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)/hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) pathway,
  resulting in an early anabolic, proinflammatory stage. This stage is followed by
  a switch back to OXPHOS and entry into a late catabolic, anti-inflammatory stage.
  Dashed lines represent pathways that lead to aerobic glycolysis. Continuous lines
  represent pathways that might coordinate the switch from aerobic glycolysis back
  to OXPHOS during the adaptive catabolic phase. Various agents including 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
  ribonucleotide (AICAR), metformin and resveratrol and rapamycin have been used to
  activate or inactivate key portions of these pathways in experimental studies. ACC,
