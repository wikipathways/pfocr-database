caption: 'Functional profile of main vitamin D target genes. Schematic picture of
  a cell indicating the main location of the proteins encoded by the most responsive
  (cohort: FC > 16, personalized: FC > 8), common vitamin D target genes (A). Information
  based on the integrative database GeneCards (www.genecards.org) and literature allowed
  the classification of the encoded proteins into the functional groups “immune response”,
  “metabolism & transport” and “proliferation, differentiation & apoptosis”. SPIA
  pathway analysis was performed using vitamin D target genes identified based on
  the cohort approach (Fig. ) and the personalized approach (Fig. A). A Venn diagram
  indicates seven common pathways that are primarily based on the indicated supertarget
  genes (B). The orientation of vertical arrows indicates up- and down-regulated genes.'
