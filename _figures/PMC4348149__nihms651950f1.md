caption: A. Regulatory factors involved in nuclear miRNA processing are summarized
  as indicated. Mediator, direct interacting partner; E-X, enhancing factor-X; R-X,
  reducing factor-X. B. The direct upstream regulators for miRNA shuttling have not
  yet been identified. However, the XPO5 function is compromised in human primary
  colorectal tumors with microsatellite instability due to frameshift mutations. C.
  TRBP is phosphorylated and stabilized by activated MAPK-ERK pathway. Phosphorylated
  TRBP stabilizes Dicer and enhances general miRNA processing with the exception of
  pre-let-7, which is inhibited by TRBP phosphorylation. D. Lin28 recognizes and binds
  to the loop of pre-let-7 and subsequently recruits TUT4 and/or TUTase7 to uridylate
  the miRNA precursor at the 3’ terminus. Polyuridylation inhibits Dicer cleavage
  and tags the precursor RNA for rapid degradation by nucleases. E. KSRP interacts
  with Dicer and facilitates miRNA processing by recognizing and anchoring to the
  conserved region of precursor terminal loop. F. The loop structure of pre-miRNAs
  is also recognized by MCPIP1, a Dicer antagonist, which binds to and cleaves the
  loops from precursors for degradation. G. Ago2 is stabilized and functionally potentiated
  by hydroxylation at P700 mediated by type I collagen hydroxylase whose expression
  level is elevated under hypoxia. H. In response to hypoxia, Ago2 is phosphorylated
  by internalized EGFR at Y393 due to enhanced EGFR-Ago2 association in MVBs. Phosphorylation
  of Ago2 decreases its binding to Dicer, which then suppresses the maturation of
  a subclass of miRNAs with long-loop structures in their precursors. This in turn
  reduces the RISC activity due to a decreased loading of mature miRNAs onto RISC
  under hypoxia. EE, early endosome; MVB, multivesicular body.
