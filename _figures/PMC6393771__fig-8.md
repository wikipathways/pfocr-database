caption: Oxidative stress, BACE1, and amyloid beta aggregation. In Alzheimer's disease,
  there is an increased production of amyloid beta 42, Aβ(), which is generated by
  the action of BACE1 on the APP. Aβ() induces oxidative stress, one of the modes
  being reduction of metal ions such as the ferric ion to ferrous ion, which can generate
  hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton chemistry. Aβ() production leads to the activation
  of the JNK pathway, which results in upregulation of BACE1, which further increases
  production of Aβ() and oxidative stress to create a cycle of oxidative stress, Aβ()
  production and aggregation leading to neurodegeneration. Aβ, β-amyloid; APP, amyloid
  precursor protein; BACE1, β-secretase 1; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase. Color images
  are available online.
