caption: 'Protein kinase C (PKC) involvement in cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways
  in the immune system. (a) Protein kinase Cε (PKC ε) is an important player in the
  Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling pathway during macrophage activation. Binding
  of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to the TLR4 initiates the activation of two intracellular
  pathways: myeloid differentiation primary‐response protein 88 (MyD88)‐dependent
  and MyD88‐independent pathways. In the MyD88‐dependent pathway, Toll–interleukin
  (IL)‐1 receptor (TIR) domain‐containing adaptor (TIRAP) links MyD88 to the TLR4
  receptor. PKC ε is then recruited to TLR4 via MyD88 and phosphorylated on serine
  346/368. This phosphorylation leads to binding with 14‐3‐3β and the formation of
  a complex with TLR4, TIRAP, MyD88 and TNF receptor‐associated factor 6 (TRAF6) as
  well. In the MyD88‐independent pathway, TRIF‐related adaptor molecule (TRAM) is
  phosphorylated by PKC ε allowing TLR4 to link with TRIF. TRIF then recruits kinases
  such as transforming‐growth‐factor‐activated kinase 1 (TAK1) (through TRAF6), TANK‐binding
  kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of κB (IkB) kinase epsilon (IKK ε) for activation
  of nuclear factor κB (NF‐κB) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)‐3/7 signalling
  pathways to produce inflammatory cytokines and Type I interferons. (b) In T cell
  receptor (TCR) signalling, activation occurs when an antigen is presented by the
  antigen‐presenting cell (APC) on the MHC is complexed with the TCR together with
  the binding of co‐stimulatory molecules CD28 and B7. This leads to the activation
  of calcium signalling pathways and mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways
  through phospholipase Cγ (PLC γ), GCK‐like kinase (GLK) activation and 3‐phosphoinositide
  dependent protein kinase‐1 (PDK1) activation through phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K).
  Diacylglycerol (DAG) generated through PLC γ1 activation binds to protein kinase
  Cθ (PKC θ), which is also phosphorylated by PDK1 and GLK. Activation of PKC θ leads
  to the activation of NF‐κB signalling pathways. (c) B cells are activated upon antigen
  binding to the B cell receptor (BCR). Similar pathways to TCR are activated but
  the key PKC isoform involved is PKC β. In addition, calcium (Ca2+) generated from
  PLC γ1 activation also acts to activate protein kinase Cβ (PKC β). For both TCR
  and BCR signalling, the signalling pathways activated leads to the recruitment and
  activation of nuclear transcription factors [NF‐κB, activator protein 1 (AP1) and
  nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)] to then produce cytokines.'
