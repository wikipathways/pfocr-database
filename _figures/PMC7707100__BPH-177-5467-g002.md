caption: The NO–cGMP signalling pathway in the vasculature. The figure shows the generator
  cells, for example, vascular endothelial cells, the target cells, for example, vascular
  smooth muscle cells and biochemical processes involved in NO signalling in the vasculature.
  NO is produced through the conversion of the substrate l‐arginine to l‐citrulline
  by endothelial NO synthase (NOS3) in vascular endothelial cells. Subsequently, NO
  diffuses to neighbouring vascular smooth muscle cells where it activates soluble
  GC (sGC), which converts guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cGMP. cGMP is a secondary
  messenger enacting cellular processes through the regulation of protein‐dependent
  kinases, for example, PKG, and cGMP‐gated ion channels. The cellular actions of
  cGMP can be prolonged by PDE type 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is), which prevent its degradation
  by PDE type 5 (PDE5), resulting in vasodilatory, antioxidative and anti‐proliferative
  effects in several organ systems and diseases. Icons with permission from © iStock.com/Alex
