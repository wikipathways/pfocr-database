caption: NPY signals through the Gα subunit, while SST activates the Gβγ complex.
  Model illustrating the known (A, solid lines) and proposed (B, dashed lines) mechanisms
  of action for NPY and SST modulation of insulin release. Y1, NPY receptor; SSTR5,
  SST receptor; VGCC, voltage-gated calcium channel, PLC, phospholipase C; AC, adenylate
  cyclase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. Our data suggest that NPY signals through a
  Gα- and metabolism-dependent pathway that does not modulate the Ca2+response; SST
  inhibits insulin release through a Gβγ- and Ca2+-dependent pathway that increases
  metabolism.
