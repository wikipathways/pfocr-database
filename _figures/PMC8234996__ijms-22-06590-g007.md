caption: Suggested model to counteract VEGF-A secretion in retinal cells with AMD
  phenotype by nutraceuticals. Contrary to the physiopathological mechanism observed
  in retinal cells mimicking AMD, nutraceutical with resveratrol/ω3 fatty acids combination
  promotes (1) VEGF-R2 relocalization into lipid rafts and its binding with Cav-1,
  a constitutive protein of lipid rafts. This VEGF-R2-Cav-1 association, which acts
  as a negative regulator of the VEGF-A signaling cascade, prevents (2) the activation
  of MAP kinase pathway and subsequently decreases (3) phosphorylation of transcriptional
  nuclear factors such as c-Jun. Reduction of phospho-c-Jun level is associated with
  a (4) disruption of c-Jun into the nucleus. Furthermore, nutraceuticals also seemed
  to disrupt and antagonize AP-1 binding sites on the promoters of vegf and vegfr
  genes and contribute to the decrease in their mRNA and protein levels.
