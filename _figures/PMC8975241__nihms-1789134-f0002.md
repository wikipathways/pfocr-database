caption: (A) PD-1 inhibits the effector function of Teff cells which is restored by
  PD-1 genetic ablation or blockade, promoting activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
  and glycolysis. (B) PD-1 blockade or ablation enhances the suppressive function
  of Treg, possibly, by downregulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and glycolysis and
  promoting mitochondrial activity and spare respiratory capacity (SRC). (C) Highly
  glycolytic tumors produce high levels of lactic acid (lactate) in the TME. Lactate
  is uptaken mainly by Treg cells expressing monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)
  and converted into phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) leading to increased calcium (Ca2+)
  in the cytoplasm, NFATc1 translocation into the nucleus and upregulation of PD-1
  expression. PD-1 blockade under conditions leading to this metabolic adaptation
  in Treg cells enhances Treg suppressive function resulting in resistance to PD-1
  blockade therapy.
