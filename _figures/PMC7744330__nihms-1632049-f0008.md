caption: ENPP1 deficiency induces pathways of paradoxical mineralization. (A) ENPP1
  deficiency increases FGF23 gene transcription in bone and intact [FGF23] in plasma.
  Increased [FGF23] is associated with impaired trabecular bone microarchitecture
  in osteoporosis []. ENPP1 deficiency decreases Wnt transcription in bone, increases
  transcription of the Wnt inhibitors Wif1 in kidney and Sfrp1 in liver, and decreases
  the transcription of Wnt ligand Fzd8 in liver, all leading to decreased Wnt signaling,
  contributing to decreased bone mass. Increased FGF23 has also been shown to suppress
  Wnt in animal models of CKD [], further exacerbating low bone mass. (B) ENPP1 deficiency
  directly leads to decreased plasma [PPi] through inefficient hydrolysis of ATP,
  inducing ectopic mineralization. A second pathway of ectopic mineralization from
  Wnt inhibition has been described in animal models of CKD via suppression of Ankh,
  which reduces extracellular PPi [].
