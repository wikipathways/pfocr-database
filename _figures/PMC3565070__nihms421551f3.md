caption: 'PYO produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa enters the cytosol of airway epithelial
  cells and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) by oxidizing its intracellular
  NADPH pool. Primary effects resulting from this are diminished reduced glutathione
  (GSH) and ATP levels, increased cytosolic redox potential (Eredox) and intracellular
  oxidative stress. Reduced GSH levels affect energy metabolism of the cells and inhibit
  ciliary beat frequency, V-ATPase activity and CFTR channel functions. Reduced NADPH
  levels inhibit antibacterial functions (bacterial killing) and PYO inactivation
  (mediated by peroxidases) due to reduced activity of epithelial NADPH oxidases,
  Duox1 and Duox2. Long-term effects of PYO manifest in transcriptional changes. PYO
  inhibits gene expression of the antioxidant and antimicrobial genes catalase and
  Duox. Several genes are induced in response to PYO including: oxidative stress-responsive
  genes, mucins, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The inflammatory changes evoked
  by PYO can be grouped into two major effects. First, PYO induces several genes mediating
  neutrophil recruitment to the airways. Second, PYO also induces mucin production
  in the airway epithelium mainly through activation of the EGFR signaling pathway.
  Abbreviations: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CXCL,
  chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand; Duox, dual oxidase; Eredox, redox potential; EGFR,
  epidermal growth factor receptor; IL, interleukin; LPO, lactoperoxidase; MPO, myeloperoxidase;
  GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione.'
