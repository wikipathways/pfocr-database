caption: PLK-dependent latent TGF-β activation and TGF-β/Smad signaling pathways.
  TGF-β is synthesized as a precursor protein, consisting of an N-terminal region
  called LAP and a C-terminal region that becomes the active TGF-β molecule, and each
  region dimerizes through disulfide bridges. This latent TGF-β complex is secreted
  from liver cells and tethered to the ECM via the LTBP. Several factors, including
  integrins, TSP-1, and proteases, such as PLK and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
  act as activators of latent TGF-β in a specific manner. PLK cleaves LAP between
  R58 and L59, followed by the release of active TGF-β and the generation of two LAP-DPs,
  each of which is recognized by R58 or L59 antibodies (Abs), respectively. Active
  TGF-β activates the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, leading to the induction of liver
  fibrogenesis. N and C represent the N- and C-terminus of the precursor protein,
  respectively.
