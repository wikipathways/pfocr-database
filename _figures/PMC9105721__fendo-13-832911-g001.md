caption: Hypothalamic leptin-melanocortin system. The first in the cascade is the
  anorexigenic hormone leptin, whose blood level corresponds to the mass of white
  adipose tissue and which acts as a leptin receptor (LEPR) agonist. LEPR is further
  linked to differential neuronal involvement of neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related
  neuropeptide (AgRP) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC), with no inhibition by NPY/AgRP,
  POMC, on the other hand, [via its proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1/2
  (PCSK1/2) cleavage activity] stimulates the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) and the
  melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R), ultimately leading to increased energy expenditure
  and decreased satiety.
