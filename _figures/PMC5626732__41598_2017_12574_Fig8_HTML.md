caption: Model of signalling disruptions in Depdc5 FS/FS mice. (a) DEPDC5 inhibition
  of mTORC1 is overcome by the presence of amino acids, while TSC1 inhibition of mTORC1
  is overcome by growth factor signalling including insulin. Negative feedback loops
  exist to limit mTORC1 stimulation in times of chronic insulin stimulation. (b) Genetic
  ablation of Depdc5 disrupts the GATOR1 complex and prevents the mTORC1 pathway from
  sensing amino acid levels. The consequent aberrant mTORC1 activity yields abnormally
  high phospho-S6 and phospho-p70S6k levels that subsequently provide negative feedback
  to reduce the levels of phospho-AKT. We predict that this may promote inhibition
  of mTORC1 by TSC1/2 and establish a tension with mTORC1 upregulation by DEPDC5 deletion.
