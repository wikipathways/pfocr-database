caption: The PI3K–PKCλ–AMPAR signalling pathway. The centre of the figure depicts
  a GluA1/A2 heterotetrameric AMPAR, which accounts for ∼80% of hippocampal AMPARs.
  PI3K binds to residues 833–853 in the cytosolic C terminus of the AMPAR GluA2 subunit
  for localized postsynaptic signalling (). p62 binds with its atypical PKC interaction
  domain (AID) to the N-terminal regulatory region of PKCλ and with its Zn finger
  domain to the second intracellular loop of GluA1 (). Ca2+ influx via the NMDAR during
  high-frequency synaptic transmission can activate PIP3K via calmodulin (CaM) ().
  The consequent production of PIP3,4,5 stimulates PKCλ, which might act in part by
  phosphorylating S818 on GluA1. How high-frequency activity augments the p62/PKCλ–AMPAR
  interaction is unclear.
