caption: (a,b) β-catenin-dependent Wnt cascade. In the absence of a signal (ligand)
  in the intercellular space (the OFF state, (a), the cytoplasmic regions of the Frizzled
  are masked, and the sites at the C-end of the LRP5/6 are not phosphorylated (inactive
  receptors are shown in black). When the ligand binds to the receptors (ON state,
  activated receptors are shown in red; (b), Dishevelled binding sites are opened
  at the C-terminus of Frizzled and ICL3, due to which Dishevelled is attracted to
  the receptor. Dashed arrows show the interaction of Dishevelled domains with different
  parts of Frizzled. Due to the recruitment of bCDC to the receptor, GSK3b phosphorylates
  threonine and serine amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic part of LRP5/6 (dashed
  arrow). As a result, the bCDC molders and the beta-catenin is released into the
  cytoplasm. (c,d) TGF-beta signaling pathway. In the absence of mature TGF-beta dimers,
  constitutively active Type II receptors (active kinase domains are shown in red)
  are separated from the Type I receptors (c). When the TGF dimer binds, the Type
  I and Type II receptors are assembled into a complex, and a chain of sequential
  phosphorylation leads to the phosphorylation of R-SMAD. It forms a dimer with Co-SMAD
  and is translocated into a nucleus.
