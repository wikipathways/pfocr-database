caption: Activation and inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. SFRP5,
  IQGAP2 and TMEM88 are some of key genes in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  The hypermethylation of their promoters leads to the downregulation of their expression,
  which in turn leads to the aberrant expression of β-catenin. This leads to the inhibition
  of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and the development of cancer. SFFRP5, secreted
  frizzled related protein 5; IQGAP2, IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein
  2; TMEM88, transmembrane protein 88
