caption: Mitochondrial proteins and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Following their
  synthesis in the cytosol, mitochondrial precursor proteins follow two pathways.
  The first (bold line) ensures that the precursor protein is efficiently targeted
  to the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM). Some proteins that reside in the
  mitochondrial OM can be ubiquitinated (Ub) by a cascade of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes
  and subsequently turned over in an ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway. It remains
  unclear if mitochondrial OM proteins are first extracted from the OM and delivered
  to the proteasome (indicated by the ?). It is possible that components are recruited
  to the mitochondrial surface to extract the protein or that the proteasome itself
  is recruited to the mitochondrial surface to facilitate protein turnover. The second
  pathway (dashed line) dictates that a fraction of newly synthesized mitochondrial
  precursor proteins will be ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26S proteasome in the
  cytosol before reaching the mitochondria. Precursor proteins that contain mutations
  or have been mistargeted may also be degraded in the cytosol. OM, mitochondrial
  outer membrane; IMS, mitochondrial intermembrane space.
