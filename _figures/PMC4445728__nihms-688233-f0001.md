caption: While the strength of TCR signaling and the quality of co-stimulation have
  been demonstrated to influence naïve CD4+ T cell polarization, the cytokine environment
  largely dictates TH differentiation. The prototypical cytokines and their corresponding
  signaling pathways (STATs, Smads) regulating each TH fate are depicted. Additional
  cytokine and signaling pathways influencing TH differentiation exist but have effects
  on the development of multiple TH subsets. For example, IL-2, through the STAT5
  signaling pathway, is important during TH1, TH2, TH9, and Treg development but inhibits
  TFH and TH17 differentiation.
