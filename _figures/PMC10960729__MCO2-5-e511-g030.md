caption: Activation and inhibition of the cGAS–STING signaling pathway in viral infection.
  The DNA virus (red font) is sensed by cGAS localized to the plasma membrane when
  it releases its DNA into the cytoplasm, and by cGAS localized to the nucleus when
  it is released into the nucleus. SARS‐CoV‐2 (red font) activates the cGAS–STING
  signal by triggering chromatin DNA damage and mtDNA release into the cytoplasm.
  In viral infection, 2′,3′‐cGAMP and STING (red font) are key molecules. In addition
  to activating STING, 2′,3′‐cGAMP can enter into bystanders or adjacent cells via
  VRAC or by be encapsulated into viral particles or exosomes to rapidly activate
  STING‐dependent antiviral immune response. Activation of STING signaling pathway
  leads to the production of IFN‐I and proinflammatory cytokines, which can further
  induce a broad antiviral immune response. In addition, activated STING can also
  be encapsulated into viral particles or exosomes to enter into bystanders or adjacent
  cells. Notably, a variety of viruses can use secreted proteins to inhibit multiple
  molecules or processes of the cGAS–STING signaling pathway (bottom left, light blue),
  such as cGAS and oligomerization, cGAMP, STING, TBK1, and NF‐κB (p65/p50), thus
  suppressing antiviral immune response. SARS‐CoV‐2, severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus 2; VRAC, volume‐regulated anion channel
