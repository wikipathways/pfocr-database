caption: 'Aβ clearance under physiological conditions and after stroke. Under physiological
  conditions, Aβ is drained from the brain through a LRP-1 transcytosis pathway, which
  releases Aβ into the bloodstream; through the interstitial fluid/cerebral blood
  flow, i.e., perivascular (or glymphatic) Aβ clearance; and/or through enzymatic
  degradation and cellular uptake. After an ischemic stroke, these pathways may be
  impaired: (1) Blood–brain barrier leakage and astrocyte end-feet detachment, allowing
  circulating Aβ to enter the brain parenchyma. (2) Oxidation of the LRP-1 receptor,
  leading to an impairment to bind Aβ and to shuttle Aβ from the parenchyma to the
  luminal side of vessels. (3) Disrupted perivascular space circulation. (4) Hypoxia
  leading to an overproduction of Aβ in the vessels’ muscular layer. These processes
  can lead to Aβ deposition within the brain and cerebral vessels, leading to early
  amyloid angiopathy and neurotoxicity involved in dementia and Alzheimer’s disease'
