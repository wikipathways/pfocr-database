caption: In NSCLC cells, FXR binds specifically to the promoters of IL-6ST and IL-6
  genes to upregulate their transcription, which leads to increased activation of
  the Jak2/STAT3 signaling pathway. The activated Jak2/STAT3 signaling regulates downstream
  target genes to promote NSCLC cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. The FXR
  inhibitor Z-GS can decrease FXR/IL-6/IL-6ST/p-STAT3 axis and reduce FXRhigh NSCLC
  metastasis
