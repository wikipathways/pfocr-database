caption: miRNA regulation of miR-155 upon mycobacterial infection and dual role of
  miR-155 in the survival of mycobacteria. (A and B) Upon lipomannan stimulation in
  human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection
  in human macrophages, miR-155 expression decreases. (C) Expression of miR-155 in
  macrophages stimulated with ESAT-6 increases and triggers a series of events to
  increase apoptosis and lead to a reduction of mycobacterial survival. (D) After
  M. tuberculosis infection in mice, miR-155 expression increases in liver and lungs,
  which is relevant to the immune response, since mice lacking miR-155 exhibit higher
  susceptibility and lower survival. (E) Upon Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) infection
  in macrophages, miR-155 expression increases and triggers a series of events to
  increase autophagy to reduce mycobacterial survival. (F to H) M. tuberculosis infection
  of human dendritic cells and murine macrophages or BCG infection of human monocytes
  promotes miR-155 expression that leads to downregulation of transcription factors
  that consequently favors the survival of the intracellular pathogens. (I) In mouse
  experiments, miR-155 expression induced by M. tuberculosis infection or ESAT-6 stimulation
  promotes Toll-like receptor pathway activation, upregulating the expression of certain
  cytokines that leads to renal injuries.
