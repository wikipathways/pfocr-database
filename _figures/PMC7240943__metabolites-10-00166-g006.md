caption: 'Synthetic Pdh bypass to increase the acetyl-CoA yield from sugar. The purple
  arrows indicate the non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG) pathway, which converts sugar
  phosphate to the acetyl-phosphate or further acetyl-CoA in a stoichiometry amount.
  The green arrows indicate the reverse glyoxylate shunt (rGS), leading to two acetyl-CoA
  from one pyruvate. The blue arrows indicate the malyl-CoA-glycerate (MCG) pathway,
  which net converts one phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to two acetyl-CoA. The orange arrows
  indicate the threonine bypass, which is able to convert one PEP into two acetyl-CoA.
  Redox equivalents and energy requirements of each reaction are not shown in this
  scheme. Abbreviations: G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; F1,6P,
  fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; 1,3BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; 2PG, 2-phosphoglycerate;
