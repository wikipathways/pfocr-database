caption: PDE8 regulates Teff cell adhesion. The complex formed between PDE8A and Raf-1
  controls adhesion of activated Teff cells through the establishment of tethers between
  integrin LFA-1 and ICAM-1. PKA becomes activated through the cAMP signaling pathway
  in response to ligand binding to GPCRs or the Tell receptor. PKA phosphorylates
  Raf-1 at S259 (P) which inhibits its function to promote adhesion. PDE8A in complex
  with Raf-1 protects Raf-1 from inhibitory PKA phosphorylation by locally degrading
  cAMP. PDE8 inhibition or complex disruption leads to an increase of cAMP-dependent
  PKA activation and Raf-1 phosphorylation at the inhibitory site S259 (P). Action
  of the PDE8 selective inhibitor PF-04957325 (PDE8i) or disruption of the PDE8A-Raf-1
  complex by a signaling disruptor promotes Raf-1 phosphorylation and subsequently
  inhibits T cell adhesion. This significantly changes Raf-1 activity in T cells.
  Inhibiting PDE8 targets the tethers formed between LFA-1 and ICAM-1, thereby altering
  adhesion, spreading and migration of T cells when tested under shear stress conditions.
  In contrast, PDE4 inhibition (PDE4i) leads to an increase of a pool of cAMP and
  the activation of PKA signaling localized in signaling complexes that inhibit T
  cell receptor (TCR) signaling and subsequent T cell activation, cytokine production
  and proliferation.
