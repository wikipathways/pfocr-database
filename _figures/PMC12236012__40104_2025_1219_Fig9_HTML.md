caption: Schematic diagram of the macrophage proinflammatory shift that drive liver
  fibrosis in dairy cows with ketosis. Excessive mitochondrial fission, along with
  the inhibition of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, increases hepatic reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production. The accumulation of ROS subsequently triggers NF-κB activation,
  promoting a proinflammatory shift in macrophages, which in turn leads to hepatic
  stellate cell (HSC) activation. This cascade results in the deposition of the extracellular
  matrix (ECM) and the progression of liver fibrosis in dairy cows with ketosis. DRP1,
  Dynamin-Related Protein 1; MFF, Mitochondrial Fission Factor; Nrf2, Nuclear Factor
  Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2; HO-1, Heme Oxygenase 1
