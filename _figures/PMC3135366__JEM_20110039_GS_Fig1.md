caption: 'T. gondii is resistant to fosmidomycin. (A) Schematic representation of
  apicoplast fatty acid and isoprene biosynthesis pathways (highlighted in white).
  Both pathways depend on substrates imported from the cytoplasm by the APT. Note
  the structural similarity between DOXP and fosmidomycin. Selected enzymes are italicized:
  PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; DOXPS, DOXP synthase; ACP acyl carrier protein. DOXP
  pathway intermediates: MEP, methylerythritol-phosphate; CDP-ME, cytosine dinucleotide
  phosphate methylerythritol; MEcPP, methylerythritol cyclopyrophosphate; HMBPP, hydroxymethy-but-enyl
  pyrophosphate. Apicoplast is shown bounded by a single membrane for simplicity.
  (B) Growth of T. gondii in the presence or absence of fosmidomycin (Fos). Fluorescence
  data are shown as percent of the highest value of the untreated control. Data points
  reflect the mean of duplicate wells and error bars show standard deviation. Where
  no bar is shown it was smaller than the symbol. All of the subsequent fluorescence
  assays are shown in this way.'
