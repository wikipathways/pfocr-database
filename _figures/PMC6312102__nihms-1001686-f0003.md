caption: Through the process of fermentation, these metabolic pathways culminate with
  the production and release of the major short-chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate
  and butyrate) and phytochemicals from plant cell walls. Note that there are two
  microbial enzymes that are responsible for the final synthesis of butyrate, namely
  butyryl-CoA transferase (dominant, formed by a variety of genera and species) and
  butyrate kinase (favoured in proteolytic fermentation). Also shown is the pathway
  for converting the amino acid lysine into butyrate, which also generates ammonia.
  The main propionate production pathway is the succinate pathway. Bacterial species
  found to use certain pathways are shown but are not exhaustive. The asterix indicates
  species shown to use lactate to form butyrate.
