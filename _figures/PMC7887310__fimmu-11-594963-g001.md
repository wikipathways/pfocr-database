caption: IFN action on cellular metabolism pathways. IFN binds its receptor (IFNAR)
  and induces ISGs, which includes the enzyme CH25H. This enzyme catalyzes the formation
  of 25HC from cholesterol. 25HC has inhibitory action on SREGP and as a consequence
  FAS is reduced. In addition, IFN also stimulates TCA and glycolysis. Stimulation
  of ISGs also increase IDO1 and enhances the kynurenine pathway from tryptophan (ER,
  endoplasmic reticulum; IFN, interferon; IFNAR, IFN-receptor; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; CH25H, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase; ISGs, interferon stimulated genes;
  25HC, 25-hydroxycholesterol; SREGP, sterol regulatory binding protein; IDO1, indoleamine
  2,3 dioxygenase1; FAS, fatty acid synthesis; ROS, reactive oxygen species).
