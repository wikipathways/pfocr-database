caption: In the ovary, two signaling pathways are involved in germ cell fate determination;
  one is an RA-Stra8 pathway that initiates meiosis and the other is a SMAD4 pathway
  that is activated via a currently unknown factor. In the absence of SMAD4, germ
  cells fail to proceed through normal meiosis and fail to make any oocytes. SMAD4
  acts in germ cells cell-autonomously and regulates the fate of female germ cells
  because loss of SMAD4 and STRA8 leads to the upregulation of Nodal and NANOS2 expression
  as well as other male-specific genes. In this situation, somatic cell fate was unchanged
  and germ cells in the DKO may determine their fate in a cell-autonomous manner or
  another common factor (X) from female somatic cells is also required.
