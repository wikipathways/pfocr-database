caption: An overview of the mechanism of sigma-1 receptor modulates oxidative stress
  and inflammatory response in retina through MAPK signaling pathway. Upon oxygen
  and glucose deprivation in cultured RGC, the expression of sigma-1 receptor and
  pERK1/2 was suppressed. The activation of sigma-1 receptor enhanced the expression
  of pERK1/2 and cell survival. While under inflammation condition, the inflammatory
  response was suppressed through downregulating the expression of pERK1/2 and JNK
  by sigma-1 receptor.
