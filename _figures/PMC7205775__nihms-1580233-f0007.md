caption: PP2Acα is essential for the proper termination of liver regeneration after
  partial hepatectomy through dephosphorylation of key molecules in multiple signaling
  pathways. A. Dramatic global phosphorylation changes in PP2Acα−/− mice compared
  to wild type mice in the termination of liver regeneration, as shown by enrichment-based
  clustering on KEGG pathways. B. KEGG pathways with markedly up-regulated phosphorylation
  in PH-KO/PH-WT in the termination of liver regeneration. C-D. In contrary to the
  efficient down-regulation in wild type mice to facilitate the termination of liver
  regeneration (C), glucagon signaling pathway is consistently activated in PP2Acα−/−
  mice at day 5 after PH (D).
