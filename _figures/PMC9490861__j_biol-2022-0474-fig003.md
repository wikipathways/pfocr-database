caption: 'Mechanism of Toll-like receptor TLR 4/nuclear factor NF-κB signaling pathway
  (Description: transmembrane receptor TLR4 can participate in the activation of signal
  pathways under inflammatory conditions. In LPS-mediated environment, TLR4 receptor
  activation decreased the expression of osteogenic markers, such as ALP, Runx, and
  OCN, activated NF-kB pathway, and downregulated the mRNA expression of osteogenic
  marker EphrinB2. All these make the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs inhibited.
  The activation of TLR1,4,6 can inhibit the activation of Akt and osteogenic differentiation
  of PDLSCs through Myd88- or TRIF-dependent signaling pathways. In addition, some
  studies have found that the inhibition of NF-kb pathway can be reversed by rutin,
  extracellular vesicles or astaxanthin).'
