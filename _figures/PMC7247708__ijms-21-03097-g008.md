caption: Schematic figure illustrating the signaling pathway activation with mechanical
  ventilation and endotoxemia. Endotoxin-enhanced augmentation of mechanical stretch-mediated
  cytokine production and lung injury were reduced by the administration of enoxaparin
  and with HIF-1α homozygous knockout. HIF = hypoxia-inducible factor; IL = interleukin;
  LMWH = low-molecular-weight heparin; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; MIP-2 = macrophage
  inflammatory protein-2; ROS = reactive oxygen species; TNF-α = tumor necrosis factor-α;
  VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor; VILI = ventilator-induced lung injury.
