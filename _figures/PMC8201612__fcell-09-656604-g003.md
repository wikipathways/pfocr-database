caption: Translation pathways with or without amino acid availability. Without amino
  acid availability (left image), the heterodimeric Rag protein is loaded with GTP
  on Rag C/D while Rag A/B has the GDP. This conformation localizes the TSC1/2 complex
  to the lysosome to prevent GDP-Rheb conversion to GTP and prevents the recruitment
  of mTORC1 to the lysosome. This renders both S6 and 4E-BP1 unphosphorylated, shutting
  off translation. In addition, the inactive mTORC1 with be further suppressed by
  inhibitors DEPTOR, REDD1 and PRAS. On the eIF2 pathway, the absence of amino acids
  maintains GCN2 and PERK activity, which phosphorylates eIF2, inhibiting guanine
  nucleotide exchange of eIF2 by eIF2B. With eIF2 bound to GDP, it will release from
  the ribosome and stop translation. Upon availability of amino acids (right image),
  RagA/B is now loaded with GTP as it maintains binding to ragulator. This initiates
  removal of TSC1/2 from the lysosome and Rag-induced recruitment of mTORC1 to the
  lysosome via raptor. Once at the lysosome, mTOR kinase activity is activated by
  GTP-bound Rheb and will phosphorylate p70S6K and 4E-BP1 to initiate translation.
  mTORC1 activation will also disassociate inhibitors DEPTOR and PRAS40. Once dissociated,
  DEPTROR is quickly degraded. In relation to eIF2, the availability of amino acids
  will inhibit GCN2 and PERK, reversing phosphorylation on eIF2 and allowing guanine
  nucleotide exchange of eIF2 back to GTP. This will bind the eIF2 complex to the
  40S ribosomal subunit and initiate protein translation.
