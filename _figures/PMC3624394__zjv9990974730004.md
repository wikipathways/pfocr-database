caption: Comparative analysis of NOTCH signaling pathway components in calcium-differentiated
  8E6-iHFKs and GSI-treated C-HFKs by qRT-PCR. 8E6-iHFKs treated with DMSO and C-iHFKs
  treated with either DMSO or CpdE (2 μM) were grown for 6 days in calcium differentiation
  medium, and total RNA was collected and analyzed using the human NOTCH signaling
  pathway PCR array (SABiosciences). Genes corresponding to those identified in the
  KEGG NOTCH pathway are displayed, with relative mRNA levels compared to those for
  differentiated C-iHFKs treated with DMSO indicated using the color scheme shown
  at the bottom. Results represent averages from duplicate PCR arrays.
