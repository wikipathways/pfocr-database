caption: Gene pathway analysis. Pathway analysis of downregulated genes was performed
  using Pathway Miner software from Biorag Web site (http://www.biorag.org). Nodes
  represent genes that were downregulated by CLA. Lines connecting the nodes represent
  a relationship between the genes. Thickness of the lines reflects the number of
  shared pathways between the nodes. The shaded area highlights the genes involved
  in cytoskeletal arrangement and cell–cell communication referred to in the text.
  The bold lines connecting this area to Wnt and Calcium signaling emphasize the relative
  strength of the pathways shared by the selected groups of genes. Other targets of
  gene downregulation in the CLA-fed mice include genes involved in adipocyte signaling
  and energy metabolism, see top, both of which are known targets of CLA, particularly
  of the t10c12 isomer. Complementary DNA microarray hybridization and analysis were
  performed as described in Materials and Methods.
