caption: 'Mechanisms of mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). Mitophagy can proceed
  via PINK1/Parkin-dependent and independent pathways. In the PINK1/Parkin-dependent
  pathway, healthy mitochondria permit PINK1 (a serine/threonine kinase) into the
  IMM via TOM and TIM-23 proteins. The matrix metalloprotease of mitochondria cleaves
  the MTS of PINK1. However, during severe oxidative stress, impaired mitochondria
  with declining mitochondrial membrane potential fail to import PINK1 into the IMM.
  Under these conditions, PINK1 associates with TOM and accumulates on the OMM. PINK1
  promotes the recruitment and activation of Parkin from the cytoplasm to the OMM.
  Parkin ubiquitinates various OMM proteins (e.g., mitofusin 1 and mitofusin 2, VDAC,
  and Miro). Subsequently, p62, a cargo adaptor protein, recognizes and binds to the
  ubiquitinated OMM proteins. Finally, p62 binds with LC3B and promotes autophagosome
  formation. PINK1/Parkin-independent mitophagy involves interaction of LC3B with
  OMM proteins: FUNDC1, Nix/Bnip3L, and Bnip3 through the LIR. This results in removal
  of mitochondria through mitophagy. Bnip3, Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa-interacting
  protein-3; FUNDC1, FUN14 domain containing 1; IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane;
  LIR, LC3-interacting region; MTS, mitochondral targeting signal; Nix/Bnip3L, NIP3-like
  protein X; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; PINK1, phosphatase and tensin homologue
  deleted in chromosome 10 (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1; TIM, translocase of inner
  membrane; TOM, translocase of outer membrane; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel.
