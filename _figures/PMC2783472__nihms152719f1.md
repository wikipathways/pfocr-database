caption: Induction of DSB causes unwinding and relaxation of torsional stress of the
  DNA double helix, which leads to local decondensation of chromatin and recruitment
  of the MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1 proteins (MRN complex), as well as BRCA1 to the DSB
  site. This event activates ATM by triggering its Ser139 auto-phosphorylation which
  causes dissociation of the ATM dimer into two enzymatically active monomers. Activated
  ATM is then recruited to the site of DSB at which point it phosphorylates several
  substrates including NBS1, BRCA1 and SMC1. Phosphorylation of NBS1 targets ATM to
  Chk1, and is also essential for targeting ATM to phosphorylate Chk2. Phosphorylation
  of SMC1 activates the S-phase checkpoint while BRCA1 phosphorylation engages this
  protein in DSB repair. ATM also phosphorylates other substrates such as E2F1, Chk1,
  p53, Mdm2, Chk2, and H2AX. Activated p53 induces transcription of p21 and/or Bax
  p53 genes whose products arrest cells in G1 or promote apoptosis, respectively.
