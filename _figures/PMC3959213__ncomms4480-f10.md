caption: Stress-induced CO production suppresses CBS activity, results in a decrease
  in methylated PFKFB3. Arginine methylation of PFKFB3 (R131/134) stabilizes the enzyme
  to enhance glycolysis through the augmentation of F-2,6-BP, an allosteric activator
  of PFK1. On the other hand, unmethylated PFKFB3 is prone to polyubiquitination (K142),
  leading to the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway-dependent degradation of the enzymes.
  As a result, methylated PFKFB3 is decreased to shift glucose biotransformation towards
  PPP. Acceleration of PPP increases cellular NADPH amounts, providing a reducing
  equivalent for glutathione that benefits enhancement of chemoresistance and/or amelioration
  of oxidative stress during proliferation of cancer cells.
