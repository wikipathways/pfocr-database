caption: Role of SOCS proteins in the regulation of the signaling pathways induced
  by recognition of gram positive bacteria. Recognition of gram positive bacteria
  through their lipopeptide by TLR1 or/and 2. MyD88 and Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1)-receptor
  (TIR)-domain mediates the activation of TLR2 by gram-positive bacteria, leading
  to the activation of the NF-κB pathway; MAPK signaling pathway via JNK, ERK-1, and
  p38 kinase activation; and pro-inflammatory caspase-1 (Schroder et al., ; Draing
  et al., ). The SOCS protein responsible for regulation of TLR signaling is highlighted
  in red.
