caption: The roles of miR-155 in various biological processes. Hypoxia is a common
  feature in cancer; thus, different hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are found to
  be responsible for the induction of miR-155 in hypoxic conditions due to associated
  response elements present in the promoter region of miR-155. Furthermore, miR-155
  is highly correlated with inflammatory processes, particularly in lung cancer. This
  can increase the chances of survival of cancer cells by downregulating the von Hippel–Lindau
  (VHL) tumor suppressor protein—A protein associated with hypoxia, but this can lead
  to increased angiogenesis. The transforming growth factor (TGF-) can facilitate
  metastasis by inducing miR-155 expression via Smad4. By targeting and further reducing
  the Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) protein, miR-155 can lead to the formation
  of disrupted tight junctions contributing to epithelial cell plasticity, thereby
  contributing to invasiveness and migratory processes by TGF- -induced epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT). Inhibition/downregulation of miR-155 is reported to induce cell
  cycle arrest (in the G0/G1 phase) and apoptosis; thus, decreasing cancer cell proliferation
  in both diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRC).
  In a different study, it is found that miR-155 contributes to decreased nasopharyngeal
  carcinoma cells apoptosis via inhibition of the Caspase 3 activity. Moreover, miR-155
  is likely to be involved in glucose metabolism, enhancing insulin sensitivity by
  negatively regulating the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), a negative
  regulator of the insulin signaling pathway, and thereby further enhancing glycolysis.
  Finally, miR-155 expression is found to be responsible for downregulation of the
  suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
  which could further lead to poor survival rates.
