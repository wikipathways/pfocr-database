caption: Schematic of RIP3-dependent necroptosis. Diagram of RIP3-driven necroptosis
  in response to a cell death stimulus, such as radiation. Upon release of pro-necrotic
  cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), various adaptor proteins associate
  with the cytokine receptor and recruit RIP1. Within this signaling complex, RIP1
  is subject to polyubiquitylation, which promotes activation of the nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) pathway. Deubiquitylation allows RIP1 to dissociate from the plasma membrane
  and interact with a cytosolic complex, where it recruits RIP3 to form the necrosome.
  Trans- and autophosphorylation of RIP1 and RIP3 initiate necroptosis by activating
  MLKL.
