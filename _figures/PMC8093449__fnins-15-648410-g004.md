caption: Clearance of acetylcholine from the synapse by acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholine
  (ACh) is delivered to the synapse as a result of vesicle exocytosis from pre-synaptic
  neuronal signaling and a release of the recycled acetylcholine from the postsynaptic
  neuron’s cholinergic receptors. In the synaptic cleft, acetylcholinesterase (ACHE)
  then degrades acetylcholine. Resulting choline is then taken back by the presynaptic
  neuron to be recycled in order to make more acetylcholine for future signaling.
  This figure was extracted from Pathway Studio’s curated pathways and was edited
