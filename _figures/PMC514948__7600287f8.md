caption: Model for the 14-3-3-mediated inhibition of AKAP-Lbc. (A) AKAP-Lbc is activated
  in response to serum or LPA stimulation through a Gα12-mediated signaling pathway.
  (B) Elevation of the cellular concentration of cAMP activates the PKA holoenzyme
  anchored to AKAP-Lbc. The catalytic subunit released from the PKA holoenzyme can
  phosphorylate AKAP-Lbc on serine 1565. This induces the recruitment of 14-3-3, which
  inhibits the Rho-GEF activity of AKAP-Lbc.
papertitle: Anchoring of both PKA and 14-3-3 inhibits the Rho-GEF activity of the
  AKAP-Lbc signaling complex.
