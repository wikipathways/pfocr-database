caption: Overview of biosynthetic and catabolic reactions of different hormones operated
  by dioxygenases. (A) GA20ox and GA3ox dioxygenases lead to the production of bioactive
  GA4 and GA1 molecules. GA2ox mediates their inactivation as well as the inactivation
  of other biosynthetic precursors. (B) The NCED enzyme is required for the production
  of the biosynthetic ABA precursor xanthoxin. (C) The ACO enzyme mediates the final
  step of ethylene biosynthetic pathway. (D) All SLs originates from carlactone, the
  product of CCD7 and CCD8 dioxygenases. (E) Dioxygenation of α-linoleic acid is the
  first step of jasmonic acid biosynthetic pathway. (F) The conversion of bioactive
  IAA into inactive oxidized IAA is mediated by DAO dioxygenase. (G) SA conversion
  to 2,3-DHBA by S3H dioxygenase. GA20ox, GA20-oxydases; GA3ox, GA 3-oxydases; GA2ox,
