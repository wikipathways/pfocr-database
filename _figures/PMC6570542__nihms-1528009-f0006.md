caption: 'Comparative analysis of purine metabolites in rd10 vs. wild type (WT) mice.
  A selected region of the purine pathway from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) demonstrated increases in purines
  in rd10 mice reared in cyclic light and light-adapted (A) and reared in the dark
  (B) compared to WT mice. Compounds in bold and red lettering represent metabolites
  whose fold difference was significant with a VIP ≥ 1. The values in parentheses
  represent fold differences for rd10/WT from . #1, adenylosuccinate lyase.'
