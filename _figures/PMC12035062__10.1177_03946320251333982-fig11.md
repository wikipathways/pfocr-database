caption: Proposed mechanism of FMT in alleviating ARDS-associated lung injury. This
  schematic diagram illustrates the potential mechanisms by which fecal microbiota
  transplantation (FMT) modulates gut microbiota, metabolic pathways, and transcriptional
  regulation, ultimately improving lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome
  (ARDS). The ARDS rat model was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), leading to intestinal
  barrier disruption (dysbiosis), activation of inflammatory signaling, and exacerbation
  of lung injury. FMT intervention restored the gut microbiota composition by regulating
  the gut microbiota composition of Akkermansia and Lactobacillus, restoring Muribaculaceae,
  Clostridia_UCG-014, Prevotella, and Adlercreutzia, while reducing Romboutsia. These
  microbiota alterations were linked to metabolomic changes, including an increase
  in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs, e.g. butyrate and propionate) and the restoration
  of amino acid and lipid metabolism, which contributed to immune modulation and inflammation
  reduction. At the transcriptomic level, FMT up-regulated cytokine signaling, mTOR
  signaling, and viral infection pathways, leading to upregulation of antiviral genes
  and enhancement of T cell receptor signaling, ultimately reducing lung inflammation
  and injury while improving pulmonary function. This study suggests that FMT exerts
  its protective effects on ARDS via the gut microbiota–metabolite–immune regulatory
  axis
