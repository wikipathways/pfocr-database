caption: Simplified diagram of the CBGTC loop in late stage HD. Glu inputs (+) from
  CPNs are reduced onto both direct (D1) and indirect (D2) pathway MSNs. GABA (−)
  outputs from D1 MSNs are reduced onto SNr/GPi neurons, dis-inhibiting these neurons
  and promoting hypokinesia. GABA (−) outputs from D2 MSNs are unchanged or decreased,
  but reduced GABA reuptake disrupts firing patterns of PV-expressing GABAergic neurons
  in the GPe and facilitate bursting activity. This, in conjunction with reduced cortical
  input through the hyperdirect pathway, may reduce STN firing. Question marks indicate
  that alterations of these pathways in HD remain unknown or studies are inconclusive.
