caption: 'CGRP cellular pathway. CGRP transmits signals to the cell using the G protein-coupled
  receptor-CLR-RAMP1 dimer: 1. cAMP signaling pathway: activates the G protein and
  AC to increase the intracellular second messenger. cAMP concentration activates
  PKA and CREB and promotes mRNA transcription in the nucleus. 2. Phosphatidylinositol
  signaling pathway: by activating PLCβ1, hydrolyzing PIP2 to generate second messengers,
  IP3 and DAG. IP3 is gated with the IP3 ligand on the endoplasmic reticulum. Calcium
  channel binding elevates the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and activates various
  calcium ion-dependent proteins. DAG rivets on the cell membrane to activate PKC
  bound to the cell membrane. Moreover, intracellular free PKC can phosphorylate the
  serine/threonine residues of proteins and have a biological effect. AC is adenylate
  cyclase. cAMP is cyclic adenosine monophosphate, PKA is protein kinase A, CREB is
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein, PLCβ1 is the phospholipase
  C, β1, IP3 is inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, DAG is the diacylglycerol, PIP2 is the
  phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, PKC is a protein kinase C, CGRP is a calcitonin
  gene-related peptide, CLR is a calcitonin gene-related Peptide receptor, RAMP1 is
  the receptor activity modifier protein 1, RCP is the receptor component protein,
  and ER is the endoplasmic reticulum'
