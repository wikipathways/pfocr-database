caption: 'Lipidomics schema of significantly altered lipids and pathways between SqCC
  tumor tissues and ANIT. (A) Pathway analysis revealed significant differences in
  five metabolic pathways. In the scatter plot, the X-axis indicates the impact on
  the pathway, whereas the Y-axis indicates significant changes in a pathway, by detected
  lipid (in red). a: Glycerophospholipid metabolism; b: glycosylphosphatidylinositol
  anchor biosynthesis; c: glycerolipid metabolism; d: linoleic acid metabolism; e:
  sphingolipid metabolism. “P” is the value calculated from the enrichment analysis,
  and “impact” is the pathway impact value calculated from the pathway topology analysis.
  (B) Pathway analysis show the interrelation of altered lipids and associated metabolic
  pathways in SqCC tumor tissues and indicates elevated and reduced levels, respectively.'
