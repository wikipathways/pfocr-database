caption: Molecular mechanisms of de novo organogenesis in tissue culture. During the
  process of pluripotent callus formation or de novo root organogenesis (left panel),
  YUC-mediated auxin acts as a key regulator to activate WOX11/12, ARF7/19 and PLT3/5/7
  expression, after which their translated products directly or indirectly promote
  the expression of genes, including WOX5, PLT1/2, SHR, SCR, and RCH1, to induce pluripotent
  callus or root apical meristem formation. During the process of de novo shoot organogenesis
  (right panel), two pathways (WUS-CLV3 and STM-CUC) establish negative-feedback loops
  and play critical regulatory roles. The WUS-CLV3 pathway is mainly regulated by
  DNA methylation, histone modification, and hormone signalling. CK activates the
  expression of type-B ARRs to stimulate WUS expression, whereas type-B ARRs repress
  YUC-mediated auxin biosynthesis. In the STM-CUC pathway, STM expression is promoted
  by CUC1 and CUC2, both of which have their expression upregulated by PLT3/5/7, ESR1,
  ESR2, WIND1, and PIN1. Moreover, WUS and STM interact directly to activate CLV3
  expression, suggesting that the two pathways converge and coordinate to control
  shoot regeneration.
