caption: Metabolic rewiring and redox adaptation induced by BRAFi during melanoma
  progression. (A) Short term treatment with BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib induces
  the selection of pre-existing resistant subpopulation in heterogenous melanoma with
  overexpressed JARID1B demethylase and upregulated OXPHOS. Intrinsic short-term resistance
  helps melanoma cells to survive during the first BRAFi treatment and provides the
  time to establish an acquired long-term resistance. (B) Long-term BRAFi-resistant
  melanoma cells display high dependence on OXPHOS, which is controlled by MITF and
  PGC1α []. It was also proposed that BRAFi-resistant cells show an increase of lncRNA
  SAMMSON that in cooperation with mitochondrial protein p32 increases ROS level by
  upregulating a mitochondrial respiration phenotype []. Interestingly, deleterious
  effect of ROS could be a promising target in melanoma drug-resistant cells, as it
  was demonstrated by HDAC inhibitors treatments and consequent increasing of ROS
  level and cell death []. (C) Metabolic adaptation to BRAFi and consequently antioxidant
  protection is important to support cell survival of drug-resistant melanoma cells.
  Aberrantly activated transcription factors NRF2 upregulates PPP to produce NADPH
  and GSH. Activated transcription factor SREBP1 may elevate DNFA to promote lipid
  peroxidation []. Overexpressed enzymes of serine biosynthesis and 1-CM are important
  for melanoma BRAFi-resistant cells to supply redox equivalents to combat oxidative
  stress []. BRAFi, the v-raf murine sarcoma oncogene homolog B inhibitor; OXPHOS,
  oxidative phsophorilation; MITF, microphtalmia-associated transcription factor;
  PGC1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha; lncRNA
  SAMMSON, long non-coding RNA SAMMSON; HDACi, histone deacetylase inhibitor; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; NRF2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; SREBP-1,
