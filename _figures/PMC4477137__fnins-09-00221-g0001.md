caption: Illustration of vomeronasal neuron signaling pathway. Binding of ligands
  to their cognate receptors trigger the activation of Gαi2/Gαo, which in turn activate
  the phospholipase C (PLC) to produce inositol- 1, 4, 5 - triphosphate (IP3) and
  diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG activates Trpc2 channel, leading to influx of cationic
  ions, including Ca2+, whereas IP3 triggers release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores.
  Elevated intracellular Ca2+ in turn activates calcium-activated chloride conductance
  (CACC) and the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel SK3. Activation
  of G protein also releases βγ subunits, which activate the G-protein activated inward
  rectifier channel (GIRK). Both GIRK and SK3 mediate influx of potassium to depolarize
  the VSN because of a high extracellular [K+] in the vomeronasal lumenal mucus. Elevated
  Ca2+ can also activates the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel
  BK and an unidentified calcium-activated non-selective (CaNS) cationic channel.
  These two conductance may reside in the dendrite or in the cell body.
