caption: Upstream and downstream mTORC1 signaling. mTORC1 can be stimulated by various
  cues. Amino acids activate mTORC1 through GATOR1/GATOR2 complexes and RAGs. Growth
  factors recruits PI3K to the plasma membrane, which results in subsequent AKT activation.
  AKT can stimulate mTORC1 either directly through the phosphorylation of its component
  PRAS40, or via phosphorylation and inhibition of TSC1 from the TSC complex, which
  leads to RHEB and mTORC1 activations. Under hypoxic condition, mTORC1 is repressed
  due to TSC activation via AMPK. TSC can also be stimulated (i.e., mTORC1 repressed)
  via p53 pathway during DNA damage. Viruses can activate mTORC1, especially at the
  late stage of infection, both upstream, via PI3K/AKT, or acting on downstream mTORC1
  target 4E-BP1.
