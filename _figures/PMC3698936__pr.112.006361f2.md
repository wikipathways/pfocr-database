caption: Transmethylation pathway. Adenosine is an obligatory end product of transmethylation
  reactions, including those catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases. If adenosine is
  not constantly removed by adenosine kinase, increased levels of adenosine drive
  the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase reaction toward . SAH synthesis. SAH is a potent
  inhibitor of methyltransferases, which use SAM as methyl group (−CH3) donor.
