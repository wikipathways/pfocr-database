caption: Top, increased cytosolic [Ca2+] often takes place in response to apoptotic
  stimuli in mammalian cells. Mitochondria quickly accumulate Ca2+ via the MCU complex,
  leading to increased matrix [Ca2+] that, together with increased ROS levels, can
  favor PTP opening leading to release of proapoptotic factors including cytochrome
  c. This eventually results in formation of an active Apaf-1 complex leading to procaspase
  9 cleavage and initiation of cell death. Bottom, apoptotic stimuli increase cytosolic
  [Ca2+] in S. cerevisiae. Ca2+ can enter mitochondria through a membrane leak pathway
  (dashed red arrow) or via an unidentified transporter (denoted with a question mark)
  and, under conditions of oxidative stress, trigger PTP opening. The resulting matrix
  swelling and rupture of the OMM may cause release of cytochrome c, which would further
  stabilize the open state because of decreased respiratory activity and increased
  ROS production. The ensuing ATP depletion would add to activation of caspase-like
  pathways (such as Yca1p) in promoting cell death.
