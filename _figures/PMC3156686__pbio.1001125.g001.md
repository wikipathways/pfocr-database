caption: Arrows show the known and predicted steps for GSL biosynthesis with the gene
  name for each biochemical reaction within the arrow. For compounds that are undetected
  intermediates, chemical names only are provided. For detected compounds, both the
  structure and chemical name are provided. The position of known genetic loci controlling
  biosynthetic variation is shown in italics. (A) The pathway and genes responsible
  for the production of the core GSL structure from tryptophan (indolic GSL) and methionine
  (aliphatic GSL). (B) The chain elongation cycle for aliphatic GSL production. Each
  cycle of these reactions adds a single carbon to a 2-oxo-acid, which is then trans-aminated
  to generate homo-methionine for aliphatic GSL biosynthesis. The GSL.Elong QTL alters
  this cycle through variation at the MAM1, MAM2, and MAM3 genes that leads to differential
  GSL structure and content ,. (C) The enzymes and genetic loci controlling aliphatic
  GSL side chain modification within the Bay-0 × Sha RIL population. Side-chain modification
  is controlled by variation at the GSL.ALK QTL via cis-eQTL at the AOP2 and AOP3
  genes. The Cvi and Sha accessions express AOP2 to produce alkenyl GSL. In contrast,
  the Ler and Bay-0 accessions express AOP3 to produce hydroxyl GSL. Col-0 is null
  for both AOP2 and AOP3, producing only the precursor methylsulfinyl GSL ,. The GSL.OX
  QTL appear to be controlled by cis-eQTL regulating flavin-monoxygenase enzymes (GS-OX1
  to 5) that oxygenate a methylthio to methylsulfinyl GSL ,. The GSL.OH QTL is a cis-eQTL
  in the GS-OH gene which encodes the enzyme for the oxygenation reaction .
