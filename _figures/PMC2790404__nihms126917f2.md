caption: Viral infection elicits a variety of antiviral cellular responses. Following
  viral infection, viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns are detected through
  both TLR and RIG pathways as described in the text. Following the activation of
  each pathway, signals are relayed to interferon regulatory factors and NF-κB, leading
  to their translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Upon arrival in the
  nucleus, they activate the transcription of a variety of antiviral mediators that
  limit viral replication and spread.
