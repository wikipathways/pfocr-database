caption: 'Hypothetic model that links GRK5 deficiency to the amyloid and cholinergic
  hypotheses. This hypothetic model schematically illustrates the links of GRK5 deficiency
  to the amyloid and cholinergic hypotheses, with key references cited and abbreviations
  spelled out in this legend. The key pathologic molecule of the amyloid hypothesis,
  Aβ (), is the main cause of GRK5 deficiency (); the latter selectively impairs M2
  receptor desensitization and leads to presynaptic M2 hyperactivity (), which initiates
  cascading pathological events that ultimately result in selective cholinergic dysfunction
  and degeneration (, ), the key event of the cholinergic hypothesis (). In brief,
  the presynaptic M2 hyperactivity has both anterograde and retrograde impact; anterogradely,
  it persistently inhibits ACh release, which causes postsynaptic cholinergic hypofunction,
  and retrogradely, it persistently suppresses cAMP-dependent signaling pathways,
  which, although inhibiting ACh release (), may also promote cholinergic axonopathy
  and apoptosis. The cAMP-dependent signaling pathways have important roles in neuronal
  survival via 1) cAMP/PKA/CREB/Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic signaling (), and 2) PKA also
  phosphorylates GSK3, including GSK3β, and inhibits their activities, cooperating
  with increased glucose hydrolysis for the increased energy consumption during neurite
  outgrowth (). When these important signaling pathways are persistently suppressed
  by the presynaptic M2 hyperactivity, the cholinergic neurons may have disinhibited
  GSK3β, which increases Tau and KLC phosphorylation and contributes to axonopathy
  (). Moreover, the inhibited anti-apoptotic pathway may also lead to increased vulnerability
  for the cholinergic neurons. On the anterograde direction, the postsynaptic cholinergic
  hypofunction, mainly mediated through M1 receptor (postsynaptic M1 hypofunction),
  leads to deficiencies in a number of important functions in cholinoceptive neurons,
  including: 1) memory deficiency (); 2) decreased cAMP/PKA/CREB/Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic
  signaling strength (, ); 3) decreased cAMP/PKA signaling, which leads to decreased
  pGSK3β and increased GSK3β activity, as well as subsequently increased Tau and KLC
  phosphorylation (, , ); and 4) decreased activities of PKC and α-secretase (ADAM17/TACE)
  and increased β-secretase (BACE1) activity, which shifts APP processing in favor
  of β-amyloidogenesis (, , ). This last consequence of the cholinergic dysfunction
  leads to more Aβ production (as we demonstrated in this study), which pushes the
  GRK5 deficiency further and closes the loop of the vicious cycle between Aβ, GRK5
  deficiency, and cholinergic dysfunction. Of course, more Aβ production during aging
  means more Aβ deposits, inflammation, and non-selective toxic effects. All these
  toxic degenerative insults, along with increased free radicals during aging, will
  come back to attack the already vulnerable cholinergic system, eventually leading
  to the cholinergic selective neurodegeneration in AD. Abbreviations used are: acetyl-CoA,
  acetyl-coenzyme A; ADAM17, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 17; BACE1,
  β-site of APP-cleaving enzyme 1; fAβ, fibrillar Aβ; pCREB, phosphorylated cAMP response
