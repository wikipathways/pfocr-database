caption: Schematic diagram of the replicative senescence of cBMSCs and the potential
  mechanisms by which Cur delays cBMSC senescence. cBMSCs (P6) inevitably acquire
  a senescent phenotype after in vitro expansion, such as a hypertrophic and flat
  morphology, the activation of cell cycle kinase inhibitors p16 and p21, a decreased
  expression of pluripotent transcription factors (SOX-2 and Nanog), an enhanced secretion
  of pro-inflammatory molecules (IL-6 and TNF-α), and an enhanced activity of SA-β-gal
  and intraluminal pH in lysosomes. Treatment with curcumin can delay the course of
  cBMSC senescence, while enhancing autophagic activity and promoting lysosomal acidification.
  All in all, Cur-induced autophagy is a potential molecular mechanism for ameliorating
  cBMSC senescence.
