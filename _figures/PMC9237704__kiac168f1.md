caption: The regulatory model controlling brown coloration by the MYB113 transcription
  factor. Light-responsive factor PIF4 binds to the G-Box region in the promoter of
  MYB113 to drive its expression. Afterward, MYB113 forms a protein complex with TT8
  and activates the expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, leading to the accumulation
  of anthocyanin and PA. The increased pigmentation produces red foliated cotton and
  brown fiber. Coding genes are depicted as bars with line and arrow showing promoter
  and transcription direction, respectively. Proteins are represented with circles.
