caption: Pathobiological function of validated MM target antigens commonly used in
  current MM immunotherapies. (A) CD38, a receptor and an ectoenzyme, regulates the
  conversion of NAD+ to ADO, which contributes to the immunocompromised tumor microenvironment.
  IL-6, an important MM growth, survival, and immunosuppressive cytokine, mainly produced
  by non-myeloma BM cells (i.e., BMSCs, MDSC, OC, and TAM), binds to IL-6R, which
  interacts with gp130 to activate the JAK1/2-STAT1/3 signaling pathway and subsequently
  downregulates CD38 expression in MM cells. (B) BCMA is the cognate receptor for
  APRIL and BAFF, which are present in the BM microenvironment. APRIL, an important
  plasma cell factor, preferentially binds to BCMA when compared with BAFF, to induce
  signaling pathways critical to promote survival, proliferation, and drug resistance,
  as well as immunosuppression of MM cells. BCMA expression is induced by BLIMP1,
  a key plasma cell transcriptional regulator, and BCMA protein is cleaved by gamma
  (γ)-secretase, resulting in the soluble form (sBCMA) that is detected in MM patient
  serum and correlated with disease advancement. (C) CD138, the transmembrane heparan
  sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1, is overexpressed in malignant plasma cells and
  its levels are associated with increased proliferation and survival, as well as
  decreased apoptosis in MM cell lines and patient MM cells. Levels of shed CD138
  (sCD138) cleaved by metalloproteinases and heparanase in MM patient serum samples
  are also linked to disease progression and sCD138 acts locally or distally with
  various effector molecules (i.e., IL-6, APRIL, and VEGF) to impact tumor progression.
  (D) SLAMF7, also named CS1, promotes adhesion of MM cells to BMSCs. The expression
  of SLAMF7 is regulated by the transcriptional factor IKZF1 (Ikaros), a MM-related
  target by lenalidomide and pomalidomide, in MM cells. Soluble SLAMF7 (sSLAMF7) is
  detected in patient serum and promotes MM cell growth via homophilic interaction
  with SLAMF7 on MM cells. Among these four MM antigens, BCMA has the most limited
  expression at the transcript and protein levels in plasma cells but no other normal
  tissues except a minute subset of plasmacytoid dendritic cell. ADO, adenosine; ADPR,
  ADP-ribose; APRIL, A proliferation inducing ligand; BAFF, B-cell activating factor;
  BMSC, bone marrow stromal cell; JAK, Janus kinase; MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor
  cell; NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; OC, osteoclast; TAM, tumor-associated
  macrophages; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.
