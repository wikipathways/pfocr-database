caption: Model of EBV reactivation in a plasma cell. BCR signaling and T-cell help
  set the latently infected memory B-cell on the course of plasma cell differentiation
  by downregulating bcl-6, a repressor of the plasma cell specific transcription factor
  Blimp-1. This results in upregulation of Blimp-1, which in turn suppresses Pax5,
  which maintains mature B-cell identity and is a suppressor of the plasma cell-specific
  transcription factor XBP-1s. This allows morphological changes and increased secretory
  capacity to occur. The UPR, particularly the IRE1-XBP-1s pathway, is essential for
  plasma cell differentiation. In response to ER stress, ATF6 and IRE are released,
  which function to increase and splice XBP-1, respectively. Without XBP-1s, the cell
  could neither acquire the plasma cell phenotype nor secrete antibody. Based on the
  finding that XBP-1s can bind to and activate the lytic switch BZLF1, it is likely
  that EBV harnesses the multitasking qualities of XBP-1s, specifically the environment
  it provides and its involvement in continuing translation and inhibiting apoptosis,
  for optimal viral replication.
