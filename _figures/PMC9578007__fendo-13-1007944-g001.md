caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of FGF21 and HMGB1. (A) IPA investigated
  the molecular pathways of FGF21 involved in NAFLD and NASH using the website: www.ingenuity.com.
  Purple lines show these genes and molecules are related to NAFLD. Green lines show
  these genes and molecules are associated with NASH (left). All identified pathways
  of FGF21 were screened individually. Representative canonical pathways of FGF21
  are associated with other related genes (including the transcription regulator and
  enzymes, et al) and molecules of NAFLD and NASH. Functional relationships of these
  genes, molecules and FGF21 are depicted using straight lines with arrows. FGF21
  is functionally related to 1. FXR/RXR signaling; 2. PPARα/RXRα signaling; 3. Adipogenesis
  signaling; 4. AMPK signaling and 5. Hepatic fibrosis signaling (Right). (B) IPA
  investigated the molecular pathways of HMGB1 involved in NAFLD and NASH. All identified
  pathways of HMGB1 were screened individually (left). Representative canonical pathways
  of HMGB1 are associated with other related genes and molecules of NAFLD and NASH.
  Functional relationships of these genes and HMGB1 are depicted using straight lines
  with arrows. HMGB1 is functionally related to: 1. FXR/RXR signaling; 2. PPAR signaling;
  3. NF-κB signaling; 4. Hepatic fibrosis signaling and 5. Toll-like Receptor signaling
  (Right). Solid lines show direct regulation while dotted lines depict indirect interactions.
