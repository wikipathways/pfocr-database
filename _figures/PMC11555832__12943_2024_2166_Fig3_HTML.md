caption: 'Mechanisms of resistance to PD-1 blockade in CRC. Multiple tumor-intrinsic
  and extrinsic resistance mechanisms to immunotherapy have been explored. Herein,
  mechanisms of resistance to PD-1 blockade in CRC are listed as follow: tumor-based
  resistance, T cell-based resistance, and tumor microenvironment-induced resistance.
  Tumor-based resistance is characterized with absence of antigenic proteins and antigen
  presentation, the B2M and HLA genes deletion, mutations and modulations in oncogenic
  signaling pathway, low TMB and PTEN mutations. T cell based resistance includes
  absence of functional T cells and increased expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints.
  Resistance to PD-1 blockade was partly ascribed to the absence of CD8+T cells in
  MSS CRC. Moreover, CD8+CD28- immunosenescent T cells with impaired proliferation
  capacity account for the majority of intratumoral CD8 + T cells. Exhausted CD4+
  and CD8 + T cells expressing PD-1 was observed in MSS CRC tumor, and CD8+ T cells
  also overexpressed other inhibitory immune checkpoints, such as CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIGIT,
  TIM-3 and VISTA. Tumor microenvironment-induced resistance is characterized with
  immunosuppressive cells and factors. Immunosuppressive Tregs, TAMs and MDSCs in
  colon from CRC is significantly higher than healthy control. Besides, Immunosuppressive
  molecular, such as TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4, TGF-β, IL-10 and IL-17A was overexpressed
  in TME'
