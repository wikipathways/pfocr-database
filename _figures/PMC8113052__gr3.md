caption: The antioxidant triad, vitamins C, E and selenium cooperatively terminate
  lipid peroxidation. Oxidation of phospholipids can be initiated by 1-electron oxidants.
  Upon oxygenation, a phospholipid peroxyl radical, PLOO•, is formed. This species
  can be protonated through two pathways to form PLOOH. The first pathway, in green,
  utilizes vitamin C and E as antioxidants thus, protecting adjacent phospholipids
  to form PLOOH. The second pathway abstracts a hydrogen atom of another phospholipid
  to form PLOOH. However, this creates a new lipid radical PL•, and thus propagates
  lipid peroxidation. As shown, both pathways create PLOOH, but the antioxidant pathway
  is preferred, because this does not reinitiate lipid peroxidation reactions. The
  formed PLOOH is a substrate for GPx4 that detoxifies it to an alcohol, terminating
  lipid peroxidation. If GPx4 activity is blunted, PLOOH can initiate chain-branching
  lipid peroxidation reactions when ferrous iron is available. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
