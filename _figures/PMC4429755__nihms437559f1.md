caption: miRNA begins as a long primary transcript (pri-miRNA) with a structure resembling
  mRNA. Pri-miRNAs contain a 5′ cap (m7-G) and a polyA tail at the 3′ end (AAAA).
  Pri-miRNA undergoes two sequential processing steps. First, the Drosha microprocessor
  complex which is composed of Drosha, DGCR8 and DEAD-Box RNA helicases (p68 or p72)
  cleaves pri-miRNA to generate precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). Following cleavage by
  the Drosha microprocessor, the resulting pre-miRNA precursor maintains a stereotypical
  stem-loop structure. Following the export of pre-miRNA from the nucleus by exportin
  5 (EXP5), Dicer processes the pre-miRNA into double stranded mature miRNA. Mature
  miRNA will be loaded into Argonaute proteins (Ago), which separates mature miRNA
  into two single stranded miRNAs. (B) Future miRNAs adopt a stereotypical stem-loop
  structure within the pri-miRNA sequence (shown here for miR-145). The mature sequence
  is encoded on one side of the loop and the degraded * strand on the other. More
  recent nomenclature has moved to calling each strand 5p and 3p according to which
  side of the strand they occupy. Here, the dotted lines indicate the site of future
  cleavage by Dicer and Drosha.
