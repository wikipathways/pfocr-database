caption: Model. Our data are consistent with published reports that the androgen receptor
  and Src form a signaling module that activates MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling in
  response to stimulation with androgen. We show that integrins regulate the formation
  of the androgen receptor-Src complex and the ability of androgen to trigger the
  activation of AKT and ERK. Additionally, our results demonstrate that MEK/ERK signaling
  promotes the centrosomal accumulation of γ-tubulin and microtubule nucleation independent
  of cell type and culture conditions. Inhibiting MEK/ERK signaling with U0126 inhibits
  microtubule nucleation when cells are adhered by wild-type integrins, and expression
  of ca-RAF to activate MEK/ERK signaling is sufficient to rescue microtubule nucleation
  when integrin function is inhibited. Although inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling does
  not effect microtubule nucleation, this pathway may regulate other processes required
  for the assembly of the microtubule cytoskeleton.
