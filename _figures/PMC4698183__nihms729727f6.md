caption: Working model illustrating the putative regulatory pathway in pancreatic
  cancer stem cells that is stimulated by nicotine and inhibited by GABA. Nicotine
  simultaneously suppresses GABA while increasing stress neurotransmitter production,
  resulting in the cAMP-driven hyperactivity of the SHH pathway. Exogenous supplementation
  with GABA reverses these effects of nicotine.
