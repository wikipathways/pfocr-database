caption: A working model for the CRY2–COP–HY5–BBX7/8-CORs cold signaling pathway.
  Under cold stress, phosphorylated CRY2 (induced by blue light) is stabilized and
  interacts with COP1 to compete with HY5, thereby inhibiting the degradation of HY5.
  BBX7 and BBX8 function as direct HY5 targets to positively regulate freezing tolerance
  by modulating the expression of a set of COR genes, including anthocyanin biosynthetic
  genes, mainly independently of the CBF pathway.
