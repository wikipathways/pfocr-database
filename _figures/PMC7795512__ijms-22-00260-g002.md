caption: 'Under stressful conditions, several intracellular signals regulate hemi-channels
  (HCs) opening. Activated HCs enables release of signaling molecules to the extracellular
  environment. Therefore, it acts as a paracrine and autocrine communication pathway.
  HCs mediated ATP release is important in the purinergic signaling which is so important
  in cardiac pathophysiology. It may also be implicated in arrhythmogenesis (see text
  for details). Abbreviations: ICS—intracellular space, ECS—extracellular space, gcx—glycocalyx.'
