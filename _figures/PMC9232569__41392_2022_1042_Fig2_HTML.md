caption: AR signaling pathway and targeted therapeutic approaches in PCa. Androgen
  synthesis is regulated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. When androgens
  such as testosterone (T) and DHT bind to AR, AR releases itself from the heat shock
  protein complex, translocates into the nucleus, and promotes gene transcription
  to accelerate tumor progression. Targeting the androgen-signaling axis includes
  multiple approaches, such as targeting GnRH to prevent luteinizing hormone release,
  targeting CYP17A1 to restrain androgen synthesis, or directly targeting AR to inhibit
  AR transcription activity. Parts of images generated from BioRender (https://biorender.com/)
