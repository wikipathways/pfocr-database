caption: 'Standardized pathway diagram calculated with a structural equation model
  of antepartal hormones in pluriparous dairy cows. The standardized path coefficients
  appear over or next to the respective pathways represented by arrows (p < 0.05).
  Endogenous dependent variables are shown in rectangles (LogIGF-I = logarithmic transformed
  insulin-like growth factor-I, LogGH = logarithmic transformed growth hormone, LogT3
  = logarithmic transformed triiodothyronine, T4 = thyroxine. LogInsulin = logarithmic
  transformed insulin, LogE2 = logarithmic transformed 17β-estradiol, P4 = progesterone,
  HF = Holstein Frisian). The exogenous independent variable appears in the rectangle
  in the middle of the diagram (time = day -43 to 0 calving) while exogenous variables
  errors are shown in circles (e = error: eIGF-I = error of IGF-I, eIn = error of
  insulin, eT3 = error of T3, eP4 = error of P4, eGH = error of GH, eE2 = error of
  E2, eT4 = error of T4). Double-headed errors denoted these covariances. Model of
  squared multiple correlations were calculated and R-square values appear next to
  the rectangles containing the variables.'
