caption: (a) Post-translation processing of Klotho protein. The transmembrane form
  of Klotho protein is thought to be processed by the α-secretases ADAM10 and 17,
  as well as by the β-secretase by BACE1 (β-APP cleaving enzyme-1). The remaining
  membrane-bound fragment is a substrate for regulated intramembrane proteolysis by
  γ-secretase. The cleaved ectodomain is released into the circulation from where
  it is thought to exert its potential humoral effects. (b) Klotho-dependent recruitment
  of the Na+, K+-ATPase to the cell surface in response to hypocalcemic stimuli. In
  alpha-Klotho (a-Klotho) expressing cells, hypocalcemia elicits a rapid response
  to securely restore normal calcium levels. This is achieved by massive Na+, K+-ATPase
  recruitment to the cell surface through a combination of the ‘conventional pathway'
  and the ‘a-Klotho-dependent pathway'. Alpha-Klotho is required for the rapid recruitment
  of Na+, K+-ATPase to the cell surface in response to low calcium levels which occurs
  in conjunction with the a-Klotho cleavage and release. CSF, cerebrospinal fluid.
