caption: Schematic representation of molecular changes from acute to chronic amphetamine
  exposures in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic (DA) neurons. A, Acute exposure
  to amphetamine increases somatodendritic dopamine release in the VTA. Glutamate
  is released via activation of presynaptic D1 receptors. Glutamate activates the
  AMPA receptor and depolarizes the VTA neuron, opening NMDA receptors. The NMDA receptor
  activates the Ca2+ second-messenger pathway via calmodulin (CaM) that leads to activation
  of the CaM kinase (CaMK) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways. The
  CaMK pathway phosphorylates CREB (PCREB), which activates gene expression in the
  nucleus. The CaMK pathway also activates the MAPK pathway that leads to ERK1/2 phosphorylation
  via activation of MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK, also known as Raf) and MAP kinase
  kinase (MEK). Phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (P-ERK1/2)
  phosphorylates P-CREB via activation of ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (Rsk-2). Another route
  of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the VTA is via activation of the neurotrophic factor
  (NT) signaling pathway. Activation of these pathways by amphetamine leads to activation
  of gene expression including the Cav1.2 gene. The upstream transcriptional region
  of Cav1.2 gene contains cyclic AMP and calcium response element (CRE) and Activator
  Protein 1 (AP1) binding sites that bind CREB and the Fos family of transcription
  factors, activated by amphetamine. B, Following chronic exposure to amphetamine,
  the newly expressed Cav1.2 containing L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) activates a phosphatase
  pathway in VTA dopamine neurons. Chronic amphetamine increases calcineurin (PP2B)
  expression that increases levels of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1). PERK1/ 2 also
  induces expression of MKP-1 that directly dephosphorylates P-ERK1/2. The phosphatase
  pathway in turn alters the pattern of downstream gene expression that contributes
  to long-lasting psychostimulant-induced molecular and behavioral changes. GLU =
  glutamate.
