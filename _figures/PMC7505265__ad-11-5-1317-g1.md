caption: A mechanistic model depicting how IFP is involved in OA pathogenesis. It
  is supposed that the IFP may be involved in the local inflammation state and/or
  that it might interact with other periarticular tissues, thus contributing to the
  development of KOA. (A). IFP may interact with cartilage, synovial membrane and
  subchondral bone. IFP may interact with the synovial tissue through affecting the
  inflammatory response and promoting the fibrosis of the synovial cells. In parallel,
  IFP plays either a deleterious or a protective role on cartilage by altering the
  expression of IL-6 or leptin or MMPs. While the influence of IFP on subchondral
  bone has not yet been investigated clear, IFP may interact with subchondral bone
  through Wnt signaling pathway. Reciprocally, these joint tissues could also modulate
  the IFP. (B). Many factors such as obesity, bone fracture, and aging are related
  to abnormal loading or abnormal cartilage, and eventually lead to cartilage injury.
  Then, the immune response of IFP may be activated by the cartilage specific autoantigens.
  The immunophenotype of immune cells of IFP is related to inflammatory phenotype
  of IFP, which is the potential mechanisms of the involvement of IFP in the development
  of OA. Macrophages consist of is type M1 and M2 macrophage. PPARγ-regulated genes
  are upregulated in M2 macrophage. Macrophages can interact with T cells and adipocytes
  to participate in local inflammation state. First, CD4 ?T cell also called Th cells,
  it contains two subtypes named Th1 and Th2. The balance between type Th1 and Th2
  type signals may affect the recruitment and activation of macrophages in the adipose
  tissue, resulting in pathogenic and inflammatory conditions or non-inflammatory
  and protective environments. Then, adipocytes secrete fatty acids and fatty acid
  derivatives which are highly immune-regulated, to modulate the phenotype of macrophages
  and CD4+T cells. Moreover, CD8+ T present a higher level of activation in the IFP,
  and the activated CD8+ T cells in IFP may recruited into the tissues by preactivated
  circulating peripheral blood. In addition, CD8+T cells may modulate matrix turnover,
  and thus contribute to the development of OA by up-regulating TIMP-1. These activated
  immune cells and adipocytes alter the inflammatory phenotype of IFP, participate
  in the local inflammation of the whole joint, and ultimately lead to KOA. Short
  title of the first figure. The figure caption should begin with a title (an overall
  descriptive statement of the figure) followed by additional text. The legends should
  be placed immediately after each figure.
