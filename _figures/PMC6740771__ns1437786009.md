caption: The proposed mechanism by which behavioral information is encoded into serotonergic
  signaling relayed to the SCN (and possibly the IGL). This model is based on the
  present findings that (1) DRN-mediated SCN 5-HT release induced by electrical stimulation,
  GABA antagonist microinjection, or behavioral activation is blocked by intra-DRN
  or intra-MRN administration of 5-HT7 receptor antagonists, indicating that the DRN
  communicates to the SCN via a 5-HT7-sensitive multisynaptic DRN→MRN→SCN pathway.
  DRN-stimulated SCN 5-HT release is blocked by intra-MRN injected 5-HT7 antagonists,
  indicating that the MRN is a critical component of this pathway. (2) Intra-DRN or
  MRN injection of GABAA antagonist bicuculline stimulate SCN 5-HT release, indicating
  that raphe activity is tonically suppressed by GABAA receptor activation. (3) Intra-MRN
  injection of bicuculline and the GABAB antagonist 2-hydroxysaclofen (data not shown)
  equally stimulate SCN 5-HT release, indicating that MRN GABAB and GABAA receptors
  regulate SCN 5-HT release. (4) Electrical DRN stimulation induces 5-HT release in
  the MRN. This model proposes that behavioral activation suppresses the activity
  of GABA (1) neurons that tonically inhibit DRN 5-HT (1) neurons (and may also directly
  activate these 5-HT neurons). The 5-HT (1) neurons, when activated, inhibit DRN
  and MRN GABA (2 and 3) neurons that tonically suppress MRN 5-HT (2) neurons expressing
  both GABAA and GABAB receptors. Output from the stimulated 5-HT (1) neurons may
  also induce release of 5-HT in the IGL. The ensuing activation of the MRN 5-HT (2)
  neurons causes release of 5-HT from SCN terminals, according to the strength of
  the behavioral stimulus. This scheme does not rule out the possibility that behavior
  could also directly stimulate MRN activity. 5-HT7 R, 5-HT7 receptor; GABAA R, GABAA
