caption: Macrophages and their metabolic changes can change their inflammatory status
  to a biofilm infection. In planktonic infections, macrophages encounter pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) that favor aerobic glycolysis to provide tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle intermediates required for proinflammatory effector mechanisms.
  In contrast, macrophages are polarized towards an anti-inflammatory state in biofilm
  infections. Although most of the factors involved in this process are unknown, it
  is predicted that biofilm infections will bias macrophages towards OXPHOS and several
  receptors such as IL-4R, IL-13R, IL-10R, and CD36 which are associated with anti-inflammatory
  cytokines (e.g., IL-10 and TGF-β) might be involved. The metabolic gradients of
  nutrients and oxygen present in the tissue microenvironment also influence macrophages'
  anti- versus pro-inflammatory states (Yamada and Kielian ). G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase
