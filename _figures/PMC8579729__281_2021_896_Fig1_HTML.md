caption: A summary of how complement is activated in IRI and transplantation alongside
  the downstream consequences. IRI causes stressed epithelial tissue to expose fucosylated
  ligands (black triangles) which are bound by lectin pathway pattern recognition
  molecules (PRMs). Antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) is mediated by donor-specific
  antibody (DSA) which binds donor endothelial cells (ECs), at sites of inflammation—DSA
  is then bound by C1q, the PRM of the classical pathway. Both the classical and lectin
  pathway PRMs activate their respective complement pathways, ultimately producing
  C3 convertases that cleave C3 to C3a and C3b. C3a, amongst other roles contributes
  to T cell activation and proliferation. C3b causes activation of the alternative
  pathway which creates more C3 convertase and therefore a further increase in C3a
  and C3b. C3b combines with other complement pathway components to create C5 convertases
  and cleave C5. The resulting products of C5 cleavage are C5a which contributes to
  inflammation, T cell activation and proliferation and antigen presentation, as well
  as contributing to ABMR. Another product C5b, alongside complement components C6
  to 9 form the terminal complement component, membrane attack complex (MAC). Another
  downstream product of C3 cleavage, C3d also contributes to retention of antigen
  in FDCs, and increased stimulation of B cells. Alongside the traditional complement
  pathway activation, the PRMs of the lectin pathway are also able to crosstalk with
  the coagulation pathway through the MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) 1 and
  2 which ultimately results in the attraction of phagocytes, as well as providing
  adhesion points for immune cells. Epithelial and endothelial injury induced by these
  processes drives the cycle of complement activation and coagulation feeding back
  into the pathways described above
