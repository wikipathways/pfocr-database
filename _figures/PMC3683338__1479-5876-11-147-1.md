caption: Immune network in EOC. EOC is immunogenic and expresses tumor-associated
  antigens such as HER2/neu, CA125 and Folate Receptor α. Various immune effectors
  such as CD8+ T-cells, NK-cells and Vγ9Vδ2T-cells can attack tumor cells, but immunosuppressive
  crosstalk counteracts the functions of these effector cells. Treg, tolerogenic DC,
  MDSC, B7-H4+ TAM and non-immune cells such as mesenchymal stem cells and tumor cells
  themselves halt antitumor activities through cell-cell contacts (CA125/siglec pathway,
  PD-1 and CTLA-4 immunosuppressive checkpoints) or the production of soluble factors
  (IL-10, TGF-β, PGE2, MIF, arginase-1, and IDO).
