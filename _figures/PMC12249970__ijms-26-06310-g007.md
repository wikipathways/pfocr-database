caption: AhR and JAK/STAT pathway crosstalk in immune regulation. This figure illustrates
  the critical interaction between the AhR and the JAK/STAT signalling pathway in
  modulating immune responses, particularly through tryptophan metabolism. Upon activation
  by cytokines such as IFN-γ, the JAK/STAT pathway induces the expression of IDO,
  which catalyses the conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine. Kynurenine, in turn,
  activates AhR, forming a feedback loop where AhR modulates the JAK/STAT pathway
  and influences immune function. This loop plays a fundamental role in creating an
  immunosuppressive environment, particularly in the context of cancer, aiding in
  tumor immune evasion. Additionally, Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) signalling interacts
  with this system by activating the JAK/STAT pathway in response to microbial products,
  such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs), expressed by host cells during cellular damage or cell death,
  further enhancing cytokine production and immune regulation. Upon activation, the
  TLR initiates a cascade that activates transcription factors such as NF-κB. TLR
  activation can modulate AhR activity and vice versa
