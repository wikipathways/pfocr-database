caption: Schematic review. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is activated in both autocrine
  and paracrine pathways. Tumor associated stroma cells play a pivotal role in tumor
  progression related to activation of Hh signaling [paracrine pathways (1) and (2)].
  Induction of sonic Hh (Shh) is closely associated with activation of the nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells transcription factor in pancreatic
  cancer. Shh is produced by NF-κB activation in pancreatic cancer cells and tumor
  associated stroma cells. Pathways contributing to Smo and Gli1 activation include
  SDF-1/CXCR4, hypoxia, KRAS and MAP3K. The effects of Hh inhibitors including GDC-0449
  (vismodegib), LDE225 (erismodegib), IPI-926 (saridegib), BMS-663513 and GANT-61
  in clinical trials are under investigation. Dotted arrows show components of the
  Hh signaling pathway in tumor cells focused on in this review.
