caption: Hypotheses for the accumulation of amyloid-β42 and tau pathology linked to
  cognitive impairment and epileptogenesis in TLE. Following seizures, activation
  of surface receptors, including excitatory neurotransmitter receptors, activates
  the mTOR pathway leading to an increase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and
  oxidative stress. Chronic activation of cell stress pathways leads to neuronal death
  and subsequent cognitive impairment. ER stress activates PERK, which in turn phosphorylates
  and activates eIF2α, causing a general inhibition of protein synthesis leading to
  neuronal death. At the same time, phosphorylated (circled P) eIF2α de-represses
  the translation of BACE1 mRNA, increasing the amyloidogenic processing of APP, a
  process further augmented following APP phosphorylation (circled P). The amyloidogenic
  processing of APP (represented by large scissors) by β-secretase BACE1 results in
  the release of soluble APPβ (sAPPβ), while the subsequent cleavage of the remaining
  transmembrane APP portion (represented by small scissors) by γ-secretase generates
  the amyloid-β42 peptide. In a similar fashion, the non-amyloidogenic processing
  of APP by α-secretase ADAM10 and γ-secretase results in the release of soluble APPα
  (sAPPα) and the p3 peptide. While also further inducing mTOR activity, ER stress,
  and oxidative stress, amyloid-β42 peptides increase the expression of neprilysin
  (NEP), a major amyloid-β42-degrading enzyme participating in amyloid-β42 clearance.
  The ribosomal protein kinase p70S6K, a downstream target of activated mTOR, induces
  the synthesis of tau and BACE1 proteins and directly phosphorylates tau (circled
  P). Cellular stress also leads to activation of pro-apoptotic JNK, in addition to
  inhibiting PP2A activity. PP2A is a major tau phosphatase and its activation leads
  to decreased tau phosphorylation. JNK phosphorylates APP and tau protein (circled
  P), and induces BACE1 transcription (not shown).
