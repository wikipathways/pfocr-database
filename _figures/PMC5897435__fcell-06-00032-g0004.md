caption: Schematic illustration of events surrounding pore formation. ROS promote
  the formation of lipid radicals (see insert on the upper right hand side). These
  molecules react with oxygen to form lipid peroxides, which can then react with other
  lipids to form lipid hydroperoxides and reform another lipid radical. This autocatalytic
  cycle can form many lipid hydroperoxides for each radical entering the pathway.
  Downstream products include lysolipids, which are chemotactic factors for monocytes,
  and OTP, which interact with monocytes. As damaged lipids accumulate, their physical
  properties lead to mechanical failures of the plasma membrane. Membrane damage activates
  the NADPH oxidase, which synthesizes ROS thereby creating more damaged lipid species
  and so on. These membrane pores also allow for the entry of calcium from the extracellular
  environment to enter the cell, which stimulate calcium-dependent vesicle-mediated
  endomembrane repair processes. The membrane discontinuity created by membrane pores
  allows PS to traffic to the external leaflet of the plasma membrane, where it can
  be recognized by monocytes to initiate apoptotic processes.
