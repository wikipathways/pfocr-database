caption: 'Figure 6. Cataloguing and functional clustering of DEG human orthologs through
  engagement of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool. (A) Bar-graphs denoting fly-ovary
  DEGs with statistically significant (P < 0.05) homologies to human counterparts
  and their cognate reconstructed protein pathways. Ratio is referred to the number
  of genes from our DEG list [comparison of their transcriptional activities between
  SE (sham exposed) and EXP (truly exposed) fly groups] divided by the total number
  of genes involved in each specific pathway that has been notably affected by flies''
  exposure to mobile-phone radiation. Threshold is determined at P value 0.05 [-log
  (0.05) = 1.30]. To the same direction, RF-radiation exposure proved able to differentially
  perturb the transcriptional-expression profiling of several genes (DEG human orthologs)
  being critically implicated in: (B) “Cell Cycle” - “Cell Signaling,” (C) “Cell Death”
  - “Cell Survival,” (D) “DNA Replication” - “DNA Recombination” - “DNA Repair” and
  (E) “Embryonic Development,” as clearly revealed through suitable application of
  IPA bioinformatics tool. Red color indicates the upregulated gene products, while
  green color specifies the downregulated ones. Figures were automatically produced
  via IPA-software protocols.'
