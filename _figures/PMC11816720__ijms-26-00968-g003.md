caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of kynurenine pathway in liver diseases. (a) In acute
  liver injury, the metabolic migration of kynurenine pathway from kynurenine (Kyn)
  to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation
  of NF-κB signaling pathway to induce hepatocyte apoptosis. (b) In metabolic dysfunction-associated
  steatotic liver disease, the kynurenine pathway activates Gpr35 and RGS to increase
  energy expenditure, regulate fatty acid metabolism, and improve inflammation. (c)
  In liver cirrhosis, IDO-1 can inhibit hepatic stellate cell activation and scavenge
  free radicals to reduce oxidative damage by decreasing nuclear factor E2-related
  factor 2 (Nrf2). (d) The kynurenine pathway activates AHR, thereby inhibiting tumor
  initiation and progression and promoting tumor cell apoptosis. Abbreviations: Trp,
  tryptophan; KYN, kynurenine; KYNA, kynurenic acid; 3-HAA, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid;
