caption: 'Role of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 in autophagy and drug
  resistance induced by transforming growth factor-β. In cancer cells with decreased
  or absent expression of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (Smad4) (Smad4-negative
  cancer cells), Smad4 mutation combined with other autophagy inducing factors (autophagy
  inducers) activates autophagy via the transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway,
  so that cancer cells can obtain nutrition through autophagy, develop resistance
  to chemotherapy, and show enhanced proliferation, metastasis, and stemness. Smad4:
  Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4; TGF-β: Transforming growth factor-β.'
