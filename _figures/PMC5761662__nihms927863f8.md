caption: (Left) KRAS enhances ATF4 mRNA levels through PI3K-AKT mediated NRF2 up-regulation.
  ATF4 translation is stimulated during nutrient deprivation by activation of the
  GCN2-p-eIF2 pathway, resulting in up-regulation of ATF4 protein levels, and ATF4
  target genes. ASNS is an ATF4 target gene responsible for asparagine biosynthesis,
  which contribute to protein synthesis, suppression of apoptosis and up-regulation
  of mTORC1. (Right) When AKT is inhibited, abrogating ATF4 up-regulation during nutrient
  deprivation, and extracellular asparagine is depleted by the chemotherapeutic, L-asparagine,
  cells are asparagine starved, and tumor growth is suppressed.
