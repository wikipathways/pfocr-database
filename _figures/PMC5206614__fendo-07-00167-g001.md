caption: Theoretical mechanisms involved in the crosstalk between insulin-like growth
  factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) pathways. (A) Binding
  of TSH-like agonists to TSHR activates the classical post-receptor pathway by inducing
  cAMP production, resulting in activation of protein kinase A, mitogen-activated
  ERK kinase (MEK), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Phosphorylated MAPK
  translocates to the nucleus where it stimulates several transcription factors regulating
  gene expression. In this scenario, TSHR activation of its post-receptor pathways
  is independent of IGF-IR activation. (B) Binding of IGF-I-like agonists to IGF-IR
  activates the classical post-receptor pathway by inducing receptor autophosphorylation
  leading to activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway and phosphorylation
  of Akt. Phosphorylated Akt increases translocation of glucose and is essential for
  cell survival. Auto-phosphorylated IGF-IR may also activate Ras which stimulates
  RAF kinase activity and that of MEK, leading to stimulation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK). Phosphorylated MAPK translocates to the nucleus where it
  phosphorylates specific transcription factors regulating gene expression. In this
  scenario, stimulation of IGF-IR and its post-receptor pathways is independent of
  TSHR activation. (C) Bidirectional crosstalk between the two receptors can occur.
  IGF-IR agonists can enhance the effects of TSHR agonists. When IGF-IR agonists bind
  to IGF-IR and TSHR agonists bind to TSHR, additive/synergistic effects can result
  in higher amplitude stimulation and phosphorylation of MAPK than that resulting
  from TSHR agonists or IGF-IR agonists acting alone. (D) A specific antibody directly
  targeting IGF-IR might attenuate both IGF-IR- and TSHR-mediated events, thus inhibiting
  additive/synergistic actions of IGF-IR agonists mediated through TSHR. Blocking
  IGF-IR with an IGF-IR-specific antagonist may be equivalent to its knockdown. This
  situation is accompanied by relative TSHR insensitivity (). (E) IGF-IR and TSHR
  appear to form a physical/functional tyrosine kinase/G protein-coupled receptor
  (RTK/GPCR) hybrid (). Such hybrids utilize components of GPCR signaling and can
  thus activate conventional pathways used by both receptors. Importantly, IGF-IR
  stimulation by IGF-IR agonists may lead to non-canonical TSHR signaling. Thus, the
  identical pathways downstream from TSHR may be activated. In this model, signaling
  downstream from TSHR may occur independently of TSHR activation. Thus, functional
  IGF-IR/TSHR hybrids may result in bidirectional receptor crosstalk. (F) Formation
  of IGF-IR/TSHR hybrid receptors may underlie inhibitory anti-IGF-IR antibody attenuation
  of actions initiated at both receptors. Thus, blocking IGF-IR may inhibit both IGF-IR
  and TSHR-mediated effects. This situation may carry functional equivalence to knocking
  down IGF-IR, where relative insensitivity to TSH has been demonstrated ().
