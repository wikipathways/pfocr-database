caption: Hierarchical regulation of carotenoid metabolism. Carotenoid metabolism is
  regulated by many signals including environmental cues, developmental program, and
  phytohormone signaling along with retrograde signaling. These signals converge at
  the level of transcription factors to regulate carotenogenic gene expression. In
  addition, allelic variation, mutations, and feedback and forward regulation affect
  the transcription of pathway genes or the activities of key enzymes. Epigenetic
  regulation also controls carotenogenic gene expression. Differential splicing provides
  a post-transcriptional regulation of key carotenogenic genes. Post-translational
  regulation plays a critical role in the control of metabolic pathway activity and
  fine-tune carotenoid production through mechanisms including protein-protein interaction,
  enzyme complex formation, metabolic channeling, and potential protein modification
