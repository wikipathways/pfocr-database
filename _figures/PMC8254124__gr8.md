caption: A model depicting the gpi7Δ/Δ-induced signaling pathway. Cell-wall damages
  caused by gpi7Δ/Δ are detected by a yet unidentified sensor other than Wsc1 and
  transmitted by an unknown upstream activator to the PKC-MAPK signaling pathway independently
  of Rho1. This leads to the activation of the transcriptional factor Rlm1, which
  up-regulates the expression of multiple chitin synthesis genes, eventually resulting
  in increased chitin content in the cell wall to compensate for the loss of glucan
  synthesis due to caspofungin inhibition.
