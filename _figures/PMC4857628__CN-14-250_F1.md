caption: Counteracting Parkin. The cartoon illustrates the rational behind the potential
  therapeutic advantages of identifying DUBs that oppose Parkin in the ubiquitination
  of its target. In vivo evidences suggest that suppression of specific DUBs is sufficient
  to promote mitophagy in the absence of Parkin or PINK1, via stabilization of the
  ubiquitinated forms of Parkin substrates. Therefore, suppression of specific DUB
  activity might be instrumental for the activation of mitochondria clearance pathway
  downstream PINK1/Parkin and can offer a therapeutic approach to ameliorate PD phenotype.
