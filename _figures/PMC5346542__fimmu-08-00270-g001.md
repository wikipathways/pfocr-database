caption: 'Metabolic reprogramming drives: (A) T-cell fate and function and (B) antitumor-immune
  response. (A) Upon activation through T-cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory signals,
  T cells engage in growth, and differentiation into different cytotoxic, regulatory
  T cells (Treg), helper T (Th), and memory T (Tm) subsets cells. Metabolic reprogramming
  has been shown to intimately support T-cell activation and differentiation. While
  naïve T cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to maintain energy demand;
  activated T cells engage increased aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis consuming
  massive amount of glucose and glutamine, enabling to generate effector cytokines,
  including interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-2. In contrast to cytotoxic and effector Th
  cells, the metabolic profile of Treg and Tm cells rely on OXPHOS and fatty acid
  oxidation (FAO) to support their survival and differentiation. The central energy-monitoring
  system underlying this metabolic remodeling is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein
  kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway that boosts glycolytic
  activity in T cells via activation of transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factor-1α
  (HIF-1α) and Myc pathways. (B) Tumor-specific T cells are often rendered dysfunctional
  due to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Infiltrating T cells are reprogrammed
  by the tumor favoring its survival and immune escape. Cancer cells induce several
  metabolic changes in the microenvironment. Tumor-mediated decreased extracellular
  nutrients levels cause impaired glycolysis capacity and IFN-γ production in T cells.
  Cancer cells also generate a hypoxic microenvironment. Hypoxia stabilizes HIF-1α
  and enhance glycolysis in tumor cells, a phenomenon recognized as “the Warburg effect.”
  HIF-1α also enhances constitutive expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)
  leading to activation of Akt/mTOR pathway. Activating immune checkpoints and PD-L1
  signaling through binding to its receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1) leads to dampening
  of the Akt-mTOR pathway and reduced T-cell glycolysis. Collectively, tumor environment
  affects metabolic fitness of infiltrating immune cells and drives impairment of
  antitumor effector function and increased tumor progression.'
