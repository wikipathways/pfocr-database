caption: (1) Drug efflux is increased by the overexpression of ABC transporters during
  chemotherapy. Curcuminoids and NSC77037 can decrease NF-κB transcription [, ], while
  PSC833 and BVDU can suppress the ABCB1 gene amplification [, ]. VX710, XR9576, PSC833,
  NSC23925, Bexarotene, NS-398, Dexrazoxane, Curcuminoid, and P85 directly inhibit
  the protein expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) [, , , ]. (2) Anticancer drugs can
  become conjugated to glutathione (GSH), leading to their inactivation. This is catalyzed
  by Glutathione S-transferase (GST), through utilization of the energy derived from
  ATP hydrolysis. Ethacrynic acid (EA), P85 and selenium compounds can inhibit GST
  activity [, , ], and selenium compounds even can decrease the level of GSH []. (3)
  Apoptosis can be initiated through two signaling pathways, the intrinsic pathway
  (mitochondrial-mediated) and the extrinsic pathway (death receptor-mediated). NSC23925
  can inhibit the expression of Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic protein, thereby promoting
  apoptosis [].
