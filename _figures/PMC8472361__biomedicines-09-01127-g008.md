caption: 'A putative scheme demonstrating the cross-talk between FcγRIII engagement-induced
  Syk-ERK-NF-κB and PMA-induced PKC-ROS signaling pathways in augmenting dHL-60 NET
  formation. Human monomeric IgG binding to FcγRIII activates Syk-ERK- NF-κB signaling
  pathway, which enhances intracellular ROS generation and IL-8 and TNF-α cytokines
  gene expression. These cytokines can positively feedback the ERK-NF-κB signaling
  and ROS generation. The ROS and high concentration of intracellular [Ca2+] can stimulate
  PAD4 enzyme activity for histone citrullination. On the other side, the PMA-activates
  PKC phosphorylation can potently induce ROS generation and PAD4 activation. It is
  quite possible that the cross-talk between FcγRIII-Syk-ERK and PMA-PKC signaling
  pathways can synergistically augment NET formation. PAD4: peptidylarginine deiminase
