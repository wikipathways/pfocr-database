caption: Canonical ATR signaling pathway and functions of newly identified regulators.(A)
  ATR signaling is activated in response to single-stranded DNA gaps in the genome.
  Independent recruitment of several checkpoint proteins leads to TOPBP1-dependent
  activation of the kinase and phosphorylation of numerous substrates including CHK1
  to regulate cellular responses to DNA damage and replication stress. (B) The table
  lists newly identified regulators of this pathway and, when known, describes their
  position in the pathway. See text for details.
