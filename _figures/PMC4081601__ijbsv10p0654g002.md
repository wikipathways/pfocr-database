caption: Proposed mechanisms of anticancer activity of nelfinavir. Nelfinavir is known
  to have a strong anticancer activity through multiple pathways including induction
  of ER stress, apoptosis and autophagy, and inhibition of AKT pathway and hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1α (HIF-1α)-dependent angiogenesis. Nelfinavir was shown to inhibit the chymotrypsin-
  and trypsin-like activities of 20S human proteasome. However, whether anti-proteasome
  effect is the primary mechanism of nelfinavir for anticancer activity remains elusive
  since nelfinavir causes proteasome-dependent degradation of several proteins. HSP90
  is another proposed molecular target of nelfinavir, of which the inhibition leads
  to a decrease in the levels of its client proteins including HER2, AKT and CDKs
  through proteasome-dependent degradation.
