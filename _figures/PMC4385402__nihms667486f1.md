caption: The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme is the rate-limiting step in the production
  of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from arachidonic acid. PGE2 is exported from the cell
  via multiple drug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4). In an autocrine or paracrine
  manner, extracellular PGE2 binds any of its four cognate EP receptors, EP1-4, and
  initiates diverse signaling pathways via activation of G-proteins. Alternatively,
  PGE2 is imported via the prostaglandin transporter (PGT) and inactivated by 15-hydroxyprostaglandin
  dehydrogenase (15-PGDH). The bold arrows indicate members of this pathway up-regulated
  in cancer while the dotted arrows indicate members of this pathway down-regulated
  in cancer.
