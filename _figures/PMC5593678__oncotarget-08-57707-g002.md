caption: '(A) PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway: Binding of growth factors to the corresponding
  receptors such as EGFR triggers PI3K. Then activated PI3K catalyzes the production
  of PIP3 which phosphorylates and activates the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Subsequently,
  the phosphorylated AKT activates mTORC1 resulting in repression of autophagy. Besides,
  activated AKT causes inactivation of TSC1/TSC2 that eventually leads to the activation
  of Rheb. Rheb subsequently activates mTORC1 which results in the same effect on
  autophagy. In addition to activating mTORC1 directly or indirectly, active AKT can
  also directly regulate transcription factors FOXOs resulting in inhibition of autophagy.
  (B) ERK/MAPK pathway: Extracellular molecules EGF, IGF or the like, bind with cell
  surface receptors EGFR or IGFR which then stimulate Ras. Therefore, Ras switches
  from inactive (GDP-bound) to the active (GTP-bound) form. Activated Ras binds to
  and recruits Raf kinases to the cell membrane for Raf dimerization and activation.
  Subsequently, activated Raf phosphorylates and activates MEK; MEK in turn phosphorylates
  and activates ERK/MAPK. Last, phosphorylated ERK directly activates autophagy or
  phosphorylates a variety of substrates in the membranes, cytoskeletal compartments,
  cytosol, and nucleus which can trigger autophagy by inhibiting mTORC1. (C) PERK
  pathway: Under conditions of accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins, GRP78
  binds to these proteins, permitting the release of PERK, leading to activation of
  PERK. Activated PERK then phosphorylates eIF2α. PERK-eIF2α activation paradoxically
  increases the translation of ATF4, ATF4 activates transcription factor CHOP homologous
  protein. Last, ATF4 and CHOP cooperatively induce autophagy. (D) Wnt/β-catenin pathway:
  In the absence of Wnt signal (Off state), β-catenin is phosphorylated by APC/Axin/GSK-3β
  complex, resulting in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of β-catenin.
  However, in the presence of Wnt ligand (On state), GSK-3β is displaced from the
  APC/Axin/GSK-3β complex which prevents β-catenin from being phosphorylated and subsequent
  proteasomal degradation. Thus, the concentration of β-catenin is increased in cytoplasm.
  A growing number of β-catenin limits autophagy in nutrient rich condition. While
  β-catenin itself is specifically targeted for degradation by autophagy in starvation
  stress.'
