caption: Regulation of apoptosis by sphingolipids. (A) Cer directly binds and activates
  the lysosomal protease cathepsin D to enhance BID cleavage and induction of the
  mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Cer activates PP1 and PP2A to regulate the alternative
  splicing of apoptosis-promoting variants BCL-xS and Caspase-9 and inhibit the antiapoptotic
  effects of BCL-2, respectively. Kinase signaling. Cer directly activates PKC-ζ,
  which mediates the activation of JNK and inhibition of AKT to promote apoptosis.
  S1P suppresses Cer-mediated activation of JNK and activates pro-survival Akt/mTORC1,
  MAPK/ERK, and NF-κB signalling pathways through cell surface receptors; (B) Cer
  assembles channels in the outer membrane of mitochondria to promote the release
  of cytochrome c (cyt c) for caspase-9 activation. Cer promotes BAX activation and
  recruitment to the mitochondria through the PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of
  BAX. Furthermore, mitochondrial Cer is metabolized to S1P which directly activates
  BAX.
