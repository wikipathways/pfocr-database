caption: RLKs mediate ovule development.(A) Diagrams showing the process of ovule
  development. ST1-II is ovule primordium initiation and elongation. At ST2-III, the
  integument initiates to development. At ST2-V, the integument is stretched to the
  top of the nucellus. At ST3-VI, the ovule generates an embryo sac wrapped by the
  inner and outer integuments.(B) RLKs regulate ovule development. ERf members regulate
  initiation patterns of the ovule primordium and development of the integument and
  embryo sac. The BR signaling pathway is involved in the determination of ovule number
  and outer integument development. ACR4 regulates integument development. ALE2 controls
  integument and embryo sac development. SUB regulates outer integument development.
  Colored ovals in the extracellular domains of RLKs represent predicted LRR motifs
  except the CR4-L-RLK ACR4 and the extensin RLK ALE2. Putative ligands and co-receptor
  RLKs are shown in gray.es, embryo sac; i, integument; ii, inner integument; n, nucellus;
  oi, outer integument.
