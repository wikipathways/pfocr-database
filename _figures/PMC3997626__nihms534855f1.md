caption: PAMPs recognition through TLR-4 leads to the activation of NFκB, which is
  translocated to the nucleus and moderately enhances the iNOS promoter activity.
  IFNγ signaling depends on the JAK/STAT pathway. Phosphorylated STAT1α binds to the
  regulatory region of the iNOS gene and also to that of the IFNγ regulatory factor
  (IRF-1), which in turn promotes iNOS transcription as well. When both IFNγ and a
  pathogen motif are present, iNOS expression is maximal.
