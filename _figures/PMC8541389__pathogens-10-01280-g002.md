caption: Effects of hypoxia and inflammation on the vascular network. Panel (A) shows
  hypoxia and inflammation-related angiogenesis in periodontal diseases. Controlling
  biofilm formation in healthy tissues and effective immune modulation prevents tissue
  from being exposed to destructive inflammation. In gingivitis, biofilm formation
  on the tooth surface creates a hypoxic microenvironment in the tissues and increases
  inflammation and angiogenesis. As a result, increased inflammation and angiogenesis
  lead to the formation of dental pockets, increased blood flow, edema, and vascular
  dysfunction. In the periodontitis stage, disrupted angiogenesis, enlarged periodontal
  pocket, and an expanded lesion are observed. As the angiogenesis becomes pathological,
  its effect causes vascular hemostasis dysfunction and uncontrolled inflammation.
  Panel (B) shows the effect of the hypoxic microenvironment in the periodontal pocket
  on the vascular network. The oxygen tension in the periodontal pocket is constantly
  changing. Oral pathogens exist in a gradient with time and changing hypoxic environment
  and undergo a dynamic colonization process. Hypoxia activates its primary mediator,
  the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), which is a transcription factor. VEGF expression
  from the epithelium and periodontal ligaments surrounding the vascular network in
  the periodontal pocket. At the same time, hypoxia induces inflammation via the NF-kB
  pathway. Both pathways lead to increased vascular permeability, increased vascularization,
  and decreased vascular bioavailability.
