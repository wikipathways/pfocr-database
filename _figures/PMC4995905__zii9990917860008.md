caption: Hypothetical inflammasome pathway activated by N. fowleri infection in target
  THP-1 cells, as postulated in this study. The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in
  response to several stimuli from N. fowleri, such as NADPH oxidase, potassium efflux
  from the ion channel, lysosomal phagocytosis, and TLR. Finally, after this activation,
  the NLRP3 inflammasome triggers the processing and secretion of IL-1β in host cells.
