caption: FGF signaling cascades, an example of RTK signaling. The formation of multimeric
  complexes of FGF ligand, FGF receptors (FGFR), and heparin sulphate proteoglycan
  (HSPG) results in the transphosphorylation of FGFRs through the action of tyrosine
  kinase (TK) domains. TK-deficient FGFRL1 molecules may inhibit receptor activation
  through competition. Several cofactors that can enhance FGFR activation such as
  anosmin have been identified. Phosphorylated FGFRs recruit adapter molecules such
  as FRS2 and Shc, which recruits Grb2 and SOS for initiation of the ras/MAPK and
  Gab1 for the initiation of the PI3K pathways, respectively. The guanine exchange
  factor SOS activates ras, which allows the signal to be transmitted to Raf1, MEK,
  and ERK, which translocates to the nucleus where it acts on transcriptional cofactors
  to alter gene expression. Sprouty genes encode feedback inhibitors of the pathway
  (broken lines). A key readout of signal strength is c-fos, which is regulated by
  ERK at both transcriptional and posttranslational levels. Activation of the PI3K
  pathway is associated with the recruitment and activation of AKT through PIP3 production
  and action of PDK1. AKT inhibits cell death pathways mediated by forkhead transcription
  factors (FKHR) and BAD. ERK can also inhibit cell death through the action of p90RSK
  on BAD. PLCγ is activated on recruitment to activated RTKs, resulting in the release
  of second messengers IP3 and DAG. IP3 induces the release of intracellular Ca2+
  and DAG activated-PKC, which can alter gene expression downstream and also feed
  into the ras/MAPK pathway by activating Raf1. Activated ras can activate other small
  GTPases such as rho, rac, and cdc42, which activate the p38MAPK or JNK pathways
  and alter the stability of the cytoskeleton. Noncanonical WNT signaling also feeds
  into this pathway at the level of rac and rho activation (red arrow) to affect the
  cytoskeleton and activate JNK.
