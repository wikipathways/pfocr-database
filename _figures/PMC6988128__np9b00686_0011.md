caption: Mechanisms of formation of dideutero-, monodeutero-, and nondeuterated artemisinin
  isotopologues (24, 35, and 3) from 3,3-dideuterodihydroartemisinic acid (23). Pathway
  (a) is dominated by the conversion promoted by sunlight to form 3,3-dideuteroartemisinin
  (24). Pathway (b) is the minor pathway that occurs both in the light and in the
  dark to result in the formation of the loss of the two C-3 deuterium atoms to form
  nondeuterated artemisinin (3).
