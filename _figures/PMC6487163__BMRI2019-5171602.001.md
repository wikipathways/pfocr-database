caption: Process and regulatory mechanism of autophagy. MTOR inhibits the initiation
  of autophagy by inhibiting the Atg1 (mammalian ULK1). Various substances and stimuli
  can induce autophagy through the mTOR pathway, such as amino acids, energy, and
  oxidative stress. In chondrocytes, when mTOR is activated, it inhibits the expression
  of ULK1 and then affects the formation of ULK1, FIP200, and Atg13 complexes to inhibit
  the assembly of autophagic bodies. The function of beclin-1 in autophagy is regulated
  by Bcl-2, and Bcl-2 inhibits autophagy by combining and isolating beclin-1 under
  nutrient rich conditions. The induction of autophagy requires the dissociation of
  beclin-1 from Bcl-2. The formation of phagophore is driven by the beclin-1 associated
  class III PI3 Kinase with phosphatidylinositol3-phosphate-containing vesicles. The
  phagophore undergoes elongation and completion driven by two ubiquitin-related conjugation
  systems, the LC3-PE and Atg12-Atg5. Then, the autophagosome is fused with the lysosome.
  Finally, the substance degrades in the autolysosome and provides nutrients for the
  cells.
