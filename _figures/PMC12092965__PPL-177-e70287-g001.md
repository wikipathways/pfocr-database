caption: Differentially accumulated proteins in proline biosynthetic and catabolic
  pathways in taproot of Brassica napus between the beginning (T0) and the end (T1)
  of vernalization. The blue to red scale is related to the Log2FC of the down‐ and
  up‐accumulated enzymes (identified by their Uniprot ID), respectively. Amino acids
  experimentally measured to accumulate and over‐accumulate during vernalization are
  indicated in hatched and solid green background, respectively. Metabolic pathways
  were adapted from KEGG database
