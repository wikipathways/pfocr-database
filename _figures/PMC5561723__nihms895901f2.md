caption: To identify coherent networks of genes influenced directly by smoking, we
  examined the potential interconnections of the 310 genes identified in the genome
  wide methylation analysis using PPI information in the STRING database. 302 of the
  310 genes matched with a protein in the database. This network is shown in . In
  this figure, only nodes with edges are shown. Also, only edges with the highest
  confidence interaction score of 0.9 or larger were retained to focus on patterns
  of known significance. The colors of the edges represent interaction types and are
  elaborated in the figure legend. This network consisted of 302 nodes, 84 edges (61
  expected by chance, PPI enrichment p-value=0.00355) with an average node degree
  of 0.556. This suggests that smoking is producing changes relevant to protein expression
  that may have coordinated functions due to their potential to interact with each
  other physically. Using GO miner analyses, the network portrayed in  mapped to 141
  biological process GO pathways at an FDR of 5%. The top 10 pathways are listed are
  listed in . Of those 141 GO pathways, the largest number of proteins, 124 (41%),
  was observed in the regulation of metabolic process pathway (GO:0019222) with an
  FDR p-value of 0.000393.
