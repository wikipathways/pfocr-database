caption: Integration of the CTD, histone tails, and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway.
  The figure illustrates the numerous connections between nutrient inputs and the
  CTD, histones, and HSP. Firstly, levels of ACoA, glucose, glutamine, and uridine,
  as metabolic precursors, may impact synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc by the HBP, which in
  turn is manifested on the levels of O-GlcNAcylation of the CTD. Additionally, ACoA
  and AdoMet (SAM) levels likely affect the levels of methylation and acetylation
  of both the CTD and the histone tails, whereas UDP-GlcNAc levels may be reflected
  in histone H4 O-GlcNAcylation (). Of course, any perturbation of glucose and glycogen
  levels possibly impinges on the extent of CTD phosphorylation (P). Finally, the
  differing CTD modification states then likely affect, for example, the extent of
  H3K4 methylation via recruitment of histone methyltransferases (HMTs) to phosphorylated
  CTD (PCTD) residues. These points illustrate the interconnectivity between RNA pol
  II, histone tails and their epigenetics, and the HBP and other nutrient sources.
