caption: A model for the control of perineural and cortex glia proliferation in the
  Drosophila larval brain. (A) Pyr is expressed by perineural glia to activate FGF
  signalling in adjacent glia and acts in parallel to InR/TOR signalling (activated
  by the expression of Dilp6). These two pathways act synergistically to generate
  the correct complement of perineural glia. (B) Cortex glia proliferation is controlled
  by FGF signalling through FGFR (Htl) and the Ras/MAPK pathway. Pyr expression is
  required from both glia (green) and neurons (blue) and acts non-cell-autonomously.
  Neuronal Pyr expression activates the FGFR on adjacent cortex glia, thereby coordinating
  neurogenesis and glial proliferation. InR is also partially required in cortex glia
  and is likely to signal through the Ras/MAPK pathway.
