caption: Metabolic reprogramming for NADPH production. Integration of transcriptomic,
  hepatic and serum metabolomic, and KEGG pathway data for (A) the PPP, and (B) serine
  and folate metabolism. The color scale represents the log2(fold-change) for genes
  and metabolites. Yellow identifies converging metabolites and gray indicates metabolites
  not measured or detected. Genes are identified as rectangles and metabolites as
  circles. The upper left corner provides the maximum AhR enrichment fold-change and
  upper right corner indicates the highest pDRE MSS. Circles contain the P-value for
  detected metabolites. An expandable and interactive version that provides additional
  complementary information can be viewed at http://dbzach.fst.msu.edu/index.php/supplementarydata.html.
  C, Expression of hepatic Phgdh was confirmed by QRTPCR. Bars represent mean + SEM
  (n = 5). Asterisks (*) indicates P ≤ .05 compared with vehicle determined by 1-way
  ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test.
