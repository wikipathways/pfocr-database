caption: 'Model for EGR1 regulations and functions in the central nervous system in
  the context of synaptic plasticity. In response to various stimuli such as stress
  or learning tasks triggering growth factors release, hormones secretion, or neuronal
  activity, several intracellular signaling pathway including mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MAPK) or AKT are activated. Transcription factors such as serum response
  factor (SRF), cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB), or Ets-like-1
  (ELK1), are thus induced and rapidly regulate Egr1 transcription. EGR1 can in turn
  directly regulate a wide array of transcriptional targets related to multiple biological
  functions related to synaptic plasticity: vesicular release and endocytosis, neurotransmitters
  metabolism, micro-RNA (miRNA), receptors, signaling pathways, actin cytoskeleton,
  as well as component of the proteasome complex. A few validated EGR1 targets are
  depicted under each biological functions. Through such a wide array of direct transcriptional
  targets, EGR1 can thus regulate multiple aspects of synaptic plasticity, and thus
  orchestrate the integration of environmental stimuli at the synaptic plasticity
  level to modulate relevant high order processes such as learning and memory, addiction,
  anxiety, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Finally, several negative feedback mechanisms
  are also engaged, either directly through EGR1 itself, or indirectly through its
  direct targets such as NAB1 or miR-124. Arc, activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated
