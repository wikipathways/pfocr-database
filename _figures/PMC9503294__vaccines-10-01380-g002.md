caption: Langerhans Cells in Inflammatory Skin Diseases. Right panel of the figure
  showed the tolerance induction function of LC in mild allergen induced contact hypersensitivity
  (CHS). RANKL expressed by KC inhibits CHS responses by augmenting the capacity of
  LC to expand Treg. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) on human LC can be activated
  by agonist FICZ, which reduces FcεRI, upregulates Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)
  and reduced inflammation. LC take up Desmoglein-3 (DSG3), a KC associated autoantigen,
  via Langerin (CD207) and present it through MHC-II to induce Treg proliferation.
  The left panel showed the pro-inflammatory role of activated LC under inflammatory
  milieu. In IMQ induced psoriasis dermatitis model, STAT3 activation in KC promotes
  LC IL-23 production via the p38α signaling pathway, the IL-23 produced by LC then
  activate skin gdT and other T cells to express and release IL-17 which in turn enhance
  the KC inflammation. However, in the late phase the IMQ model, LC-specific PDL-1
  can help to ease the skin inflammation via PD1/PDL-1 axis. In a LC-specific inducible
  ovalbumin (OVA) expression mouse model, presentation of endogenous OVA by activated
  LC induces a recallable cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) memory response, whereas OVA
  presentation by steady state LC results in Treg accumulation and CTL tolerance.
