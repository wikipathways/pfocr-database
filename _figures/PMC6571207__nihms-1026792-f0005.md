caption: In Acinetobacter baumannii, colistin resistance manifests either through
  modifications of the lipid anchor of LOS, termed lipid A, or by the complete loss
  of LOS, both of which alter binding affinity of colistin. Most commonly, colistin-resistant
  clinical isolates harbor mutations in the two-component regulatory system PmrA-PmrB,
  which is associated with the addition of phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by PmrC, and
  galactosamine (GalN) to lipid A that presumably alter the binding affinity of colistin.
  The addition of GalN is dependent on the deacetylase activity of NaxD, which is
  regulated by the PmrA-PmrB system. Moreover, the dual activity of the acyltransferase,
  LpxM, leads to the constitutive expression of a predominately hepta-acylated form
  of LOS, which provides increased resistance against colistin. In extreme cases,
  A. baumannii will acquire mutations in the lipid A biosynthetic pathway thereby
  halting its production. In the absence of lipid A, A. baumannii has been shown to
  upregulate lipoproteins, namely A1S_1944, A1S_1945 and A1S_2739, which stabilize
  the outer membrane. The accumulation of the capsular polysaccharide poly-β−1,6-N-Acetylglucosamine
  (PNAG) has also been observed in strains lacking lipid A as a proposed mechanism
  of membrane stabilization.
