caption: Schematic model on the contribution of DUSP3-NPM axis to p53 actions in the
  maintenance of genomic stability. Under conditions of cellular homeostasis, the
  NPM present in the nucleoli is constantly interacting with and being dephosphorylated
  by DUSP3 on residues Y29, Y67, and Y271. In the absence of DUSP3, these three residues
  remain phosphorylated and favor the dissociation equilibrium of NPM homo-oligomerization
  and/or its association with ARF, therefore promoting an early nucleoplasmic translocation
  of monomeric NPM and ARF. Once in the nucleoplasm, these two proteins can induce
  the dissociation of the HDM2-p53 interaction through the individual binding to one
  or the other protein. This mitigates the process of p53 degradation (via proteasome),
  increasing its half-life and, therefore, allowing its phosphorylation in Ser15 (through
  kinases of the PIKK family) that subsequently increase its transcriptional activity.
  Therefore, as previously reported in a DUSP3 deficiency scenario, the greater p53
  activation modulates the downstream pathway to regulate cellular responses to genotoxic
  stress, causing cell cycle arrest associated with the absence or insufficient DNA
  repair, followed by senescence and reduced cell proliferation/survival (; ; ).
