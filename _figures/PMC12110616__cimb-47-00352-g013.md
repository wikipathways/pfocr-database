caption: 'Main signaling pathway activation in (a) treated naïve PC-3, and (b) Bortezomib-resistant
  PC-3 RB40 Cells. The green color is used whenever the activation levels (phosphorylation/accumulation)
  remain similar compared to the baseline conditions (untreated naïve PC-3 cells).
  The red color is used to annotate downregulation: light red is used for mild changes
  and dark red for pronounced decreases. The blue color is used to annotate upregulation:
  light blue is used for mild changes and dark blue for pronounced increases. The
  diagrams are based on the western blot data gathered from the assays. By using arrows,
  all known (major) phosphorylation routes are indicated. The localization of each
  protein is also annotated, as well as events of dimerization, transport inside the
  nucleus, and DNA binding (for transcription factors and cell cycle regulators)'
