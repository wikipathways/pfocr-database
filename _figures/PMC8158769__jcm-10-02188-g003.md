caption: Mannose-binding lectin pathway and downstream effects. Initiation of the
  lectin pathway leads to the activation of MASP-1, which is capable of further autoactivation
  as well as activation of MASP-2. MASP-2 is responsible for the generation of subsequent
  anaphylatoxins and MAC. MASP-1 has much more relaxed substrate specificity, rendering
  additional effects in the coagulation and inflammatory cascades. Adapted from Dobo
  et al. [].
