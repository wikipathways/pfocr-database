caption: 'A schematic overview describing the target pathway and overall metabolic
  strategies for Zn-porphyrin production in C. glutamicum. (a) The heme biosynthesis
  pathway used in this study. Glucose indicates a major sole energy source used in
  this study for cell growth and porphyrin production. Glycolysis starting from glucose
  is a chain of reactions to form pyruvate, which enters tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle with acetyl-CoA. TCA cycle is a series of biochemical reactions providing
  essential biochemical intermediates, such as 2-oxoglutarate, succinyl-CoA, etc.,
  for cellular energy production and amino acid biosynthesis containing l-glutamate
  and l-glycine. Zinc-porphyrin biosynthesis is initiated from l-glutamate. The red
  letter represents the gene overexpression in C. glutamicum. The T-shape and red
  X-shape denote the gene repression by the transcriptional regulator and inactivation
  of the HrrA protein by gene repression by the DtxR protein, respectively. The solid-line
  arrow and dashed-line arrow indicate the general metabolic pathway and abbreviated
  metabolic pathway, respectively. The green arrow denotes enhanced metabolic flux
  by the combinatorial overexpression of hemAM, hemL and dtxR genes. The width of
  each green arrow is proportional to the result of the mRNA expression level of heme
  biosynthesis genes when the DtxR protein was overexpressed with HemAM and HemL protein.
  Purple and black colored chemicals are the target product Zn-CP III and porphyrin
  chassis CP III, respectively. (b) The regulatory mechanism of the transcriptional
  regulator DtxR in C. glutamicum. The DtxR protein and HrrA protein bind in the promoter
  region in front of target genes, respectively, repress the gene expression of those,,.
  Major symbols were described in the dashed black line box. The black line arrow
  shows processing of regulatory mechanisms of the HrrA protein. Abbreviations: GSA,
  l-glutamate 1-semialdehyde; ALA, 5-aminolevulinic acid; PBG, porphobilinogen; HMB,
