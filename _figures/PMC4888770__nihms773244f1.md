caption: a Radiation induced activation of canonical and non-canonical hedgehog (Hh)
  signaling pathway. In non-irradiated tissue, Hh ligands are not present. In this
  setting, patched (PTCH) receptor inhibits a co-receptor, smoothened (SMO), which
  in turn fails to inhibit several intracellular kinases that phosphorylate glioblastoma
  (GLI) family of transcription factors and target it for ubiquitination and proteasome
  degradation. Radiation induces the secretion of hedgehog ligands which binds to
  PTCH receptors, thereby activating SMO induced inhibition of intracellular kinases,
  resulting in stabilization of GLI for its transcription effects, via the canonical
  pathway. In the non-canonical pathway, radiation induces transforming growth factor-β
  (TGF-β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which can independently activate GLI.
  b Activation of Hh signaling promotes radiation induced liver injury and compensatory
  regeneration. Healthy livers express low levels of Hh ligands and relatively high
  levels of Hh interacting protein (Hhip), thereby inactivating Hh signaling. After
  liver irradiation, Hh ligands are secreted by injured liver cells, while Hhip secretion
  is repressed, permitting Hh ligand– PTCH receptor interaction and activation of
  the canonical Hh signaling pathway. This stimulates radiation induced fibrosis by
  inducing quiescent (Q) hepatic stellate cells’ transition to myofibroblastic (MF)
  hepatic stellate cells. Further Hh signaling in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells
  (LSECs) promotes radiation induced liver sinusoidal dysfunction, contributing to
  RILD. Hh signaling could also promote compensatory regeneration of the non-irradiated
  liver as well as cancer progression
