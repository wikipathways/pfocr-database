caption: (A) The Drosophila JAK-STAT pathway consists of three Upd ligands collectively
  referred to as Upd (green). Upd activates the receptor Dome (brown), which results
  in activation of Hop (orange), leading to tyrosine phosphorylation (brown circles)
  on Dome. Stat92E dimers (blue) bind to the phosphorylated receptor. Once bound,
  Stat92E is phosphorylated on tyrosine 711, generating an active Stat92E dimer that
  undergoes nuclear translocation, where it binds to a consensus TTCNNNGAA site and
  alters gene expression. Socs36E is a Stat92E target gene that encodes a negative
  regulator (magenta) of Dome/JAK activity. A second receptor ET/Lat (red) inhibits
  JAK/STAT signaling. dPIAS (gray) inhibits activated Stat92E dimers.(B) Domain structure
  of Hop. Hop contains a bona fide tyrosine kinase domain (JH1, yellow), a pseudokinase
  domain that lacks kinase activity (JH2, green), an atypical SH2 domain (magenta),
  and a FERM domain (blue) that mediates attachment to cytokine receptors. In the
  wild type Hop protein, the JH2 domain prevents the activation of the kinase domain,
  JH1 (top arrow). The E695K (T42) or G341E (Tum-l) mutations lead to activation (bottom
  arrows) of JH1.
