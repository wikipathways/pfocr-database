caption: Model for the role of the GA pathway in regulation of AM symbiosis by phosphate.
  Schematic representation of GA function in AM symbiosis based on gene expression
  patterns and effects of GA3 and Pi on AM symbiosis. Promoting (arrows) and inhibiting
  (blocks) actions of AM fungi, phosphate (Pi) and GA3 are indicated on GA biosynthesis,
  GA inactivation by GA2ox; on the induction of AM-related genes (RAM1, RAM2, STR
  and PT4); and ultimately on functional symbiosis (represented by an arbuscule).
  GA acts by negative feedback onto GA biosynthesis, feed-forward activation of GA2ox,
  and by transient induction of AM-related genes (arrow with asterisk). Inhibitory
  action of GA onto AM symbiosis through the canonical DELLA pathway ultimately counteracts
  the transient induction of AM-related genes and leads to inhibition of AM symbiosis.
  Thick arrows exerted by AM fungi indicate the strong induction of GA2ox genes and
  AM-related genes in the functional symbiosis (see ). Dashed arrows represent multistep
  pathways.
