caption: Cholinergic mechanisms of modulating immune function and controlling inflammation
  (proposed mechanisms). Efferent vagus nerve cholinergic signaling inhibits TNF and
  other pro-inflammatory cytokine levels through α7nAChR-mediated mechanisms. Experimental
  evidence indicates that activation of α7nAChR on immune cells by nicotine can prevent
  NF-κB nuclear translocation. α7nAChR-mediated activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway
  has also been demonstrated in response to nicotine. These signaling pathways play
  a central role in transmitting vagal or nicotine-induced cholinergic anti-inflammatory
  signaling leading to inhibition of immune cell activation and suppression of TNF,
  HMGB1, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and IL-6 synthesis. Brain muscarinic
  acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) signaling mechanisms also modulate vagal immunoregulatory
  and anti-inflammatory output (See text for details).
