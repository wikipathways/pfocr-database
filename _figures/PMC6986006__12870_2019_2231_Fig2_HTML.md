caption: Schematic diagram representing the relative contents of the significantly
  discriminant metabolites in their corresponding biosynthetic pathways across 51
  plant species and across plant spatial parts. The modified pathway was adapted from
  the KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). The heatmap represents the mean
  value of the peak area for the discriminant metabolites detected across spatial
  parts (leaves and stems) for the three plant families (Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and
  Rosaceae). The discriminant metabolites among leaf and stem extracts are indicated
  in red and blue fonts, respectively. The colors of the heat map for metabolite levels
  represent their average fold-change values
