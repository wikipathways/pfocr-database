caption: Potential mechanism of QSG efficacy on HF rats. QSG improved heart function
  and decreased cardiac remodeling by regulating the calcium signaling pathway. QSG
  ameliorated cytoplasmic Ca2+ overload in the cardiac cells, manifested by downregulation
  of CaV1.2 and upregulation of the SERCA2a and further confirmed by inhibition of
  CaMKII and CaN after QSG treatment.
