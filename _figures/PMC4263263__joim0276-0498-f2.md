caption: Metacore analysis of leading edge genes. The pathway map showing the role
  of APC in cell cycle regulation, identified with the Metacore (GeneGo) pathway tool,
  among the leading edge genes from gene set enrichment analyses using the gene set
  collection C2 cgp. The leading edge genes were found to be upregulated after intake
  of fish oil (FO) compared with high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO). The experimental
  data are shown on the maps as ‘thermometer-like’ figures. Upward thermometers (red)
  indicate upregulated gene transcripts in the FO group and downward thermometers
  (blue) indicate downregulated expression levels of the genes in the HOSO group.
