caption: Schematic representation from proteomic analysis of the proposed mechanism
  underlying H. pylori lysate promotes CAFs cells proliferation and migration. Exposure
  of CCA cells to H. pylori lysate induces fibroblast transformation to CAFs, promotes
  integrin activation and subsequently induces FAK activation. FAK is anticipated
  to trigger activation of the PI3K signaling cascade, which subsequently leads to
  the activation β-catenin. Melatonin is postulated to mitigate the induction of proliferation
  and migration of H. pylori lysate-exposed CAFs cells by modulating the FAK signaling
  pathway
