caption: Associations among miR-122-identified targets. Pathway Studio 6 was used
  to establish connections among genes that responded to miR-122. Genes identified
  in the proteomics analysis as direct miR-122 targets containing predicted target
  sites are represented in green, and indirect targets lacking such sites are brown;
  pink indicates targets identified by the luciferase analysis; and blue indicates
  high confidence targets identified by both methods. PXN, paxillin.
