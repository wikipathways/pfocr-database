caption: The Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway and Anti-inflammatory Response
  and HIV-1. The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway is an efferent two-neuron circuit,
  whereby the parasympathetic neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus (DMN) of the vagus
  nerve (gold neuron) inhibits proinflammatory cytokine release by cells of the immune
  system via their innervation of sympathetic neurons (green) in the superior mesenteric-celiac
  ganglion (SMCG). In this diagram, the DMN of the vagus receives and integrates information
  from vagal afferent sensory neurons (pink) that sense damage-associated and pathogen
  molecular patterns (DAMPs and PAMPs, respectively; gray triangle, (1)). The efferent
  arm of the vagal reflex arc arises from the dorsal motor nucleus (DMN) of the vagus
  (2) and terminates onto postganglionic sympathetic neurons in the superior mesenteric-celiac
  ganglion (SMCG, (3)). These vagal nerves modulate the sympathetic nerve activity
  (4) to regulate inflammation. Preganglionic cholinergic sympathetic neurons (orange)
  in the intermediolateral cell column signal noradrenergic postganglionic neurons
  (green). Axons from sympathetic SMCG neurons (green) innervate the spleen via the
  splenic nerve (5) where they form neuroeffector junctions with choline acetyltranserase
  (ChAT)-positive (ChAT+) Th cells (6) that have migrated from the gut into the spleen
  (7). The neurotransmitter, norepinephrine (NE, green circles) release from sympathetic
  nerve terminals binds to β2-adrenergic receptors (β2-AR) expressed on the cell surface
  of gut-derived ChAT+ positive Th cells. NE binding with β2-AR stimulates gut-immigrated
  Th cell secretion of acetylcholine (ACh, orange circles; (8)), which binds to α7-nicotinic
  acetylcholine receptors (α7-nAChRs) expressed on cell surface of macrophages (9)
  to inhibit their tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α secretion (10). HIV-1 and/or its
  viral proteins can disrupt the cholinergic anti-inflammatory response, tampering
  with a major pathway that controls inflammation at multiple sites (virus-red lightning
  bolts; see ref. []). In this way, HIV-1 infection promotes chronic inflammation
  by inhibition of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. The orange neuron represents
  preganglionic cholinergic sympathetic neurons in intermediolateral cell column that
  also converge onto postganglionic noradrenergic SMCG neurons via the splanchnic
  nerve that innervates in the spleen. CNS, central nervous system; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency
  virus-1. Black arrows, directional; red arrows, inhibition.
