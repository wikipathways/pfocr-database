caption: Krzycki and colleagues report that l-pyrrolysine forms from two l-lysine
  molecules in archaea, and propose the following biosynthetic pathway. a, In the
  presence of a cofactor (S-adenosylmethionine, SAM), the protein PylB catalyses the
  conversion of l-lysine to 3-methyl-d-ornithine, a molecular-rearrangement reaction.
  b, PylC then catalyses the ATP-dependent combination of 3-methyl-d-ornithine with
  another l-lysine to make 3-methyl-d-ornithyl-l-lysine (ATP is an energy-carrying
  cofactor). c, d, Finally, PylD catalyses an oxidative deamination reaction (in which
  an NH2 group is eliminated as ammonia, NH3), which is followed by cyclization and
  dehydration steps to yield l-pyrrolysine. It is not currently clear whether PylD
  catalyses the transformation shown in d, or whether this is a spontaneous process.
  Fragments of the molecules are colour-coded to make the reactions easier to follow.
