caption: Network contains downregulated genes and identified around NFKB gene. Top
  functions of the genes were related to cellular assembly and organization, connective
  tissue development and function, neurological disease. Node (gene) and edge (gene
  relationship) symbols were described in the bottom part of the figure. The intensity
  of the node color (green) indicated the degree of downregulation. Genes in uncolored
  notes were not identified as differentially expressed in our experiment and were
  integrated into the computationally generated networks on the basis of the evidence
  stored in the IPA knowledge memory indicating a relevance to this network. The node
  shapes denote enzymes, phosphatases, kinases, peptidases, G-protein coupled receptor,
  transmembrane receptor, cytokines, growth factor, ion channel, transporter, translation
  factor, nuclear receptor, transcription factor and other.
