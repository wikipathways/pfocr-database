caption: 'TLRs signaling pathway and related Th responses. TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5,
  TLR6, and TLR10 are expressed on the cell surface, while TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9
  are expressed on intracellular vesicles. TLRs can recognize different ligands and
  recruit adapter proteins, MyD88, Mal, TRIF, or TRAM, activating the downstream signaling
  pathway. TLR10 is an orphan receptor and lacks a classical downstream signaling
  pathway. Some TLRs promote the differentiation of Th cells. TLR2/6 promotes Treg
  cell differentiation through the JNK pathway. TLR2/1 promotes Th1 and Th17 cell
  differentiation through p38 MAPK pathway. TLR4 eliminates the Th1 response through
  IRF1 and promotes Th17 cell differentiation by STAT3 pathway. TLR5 can stimulate
  the body to induce Th2 response, inhibit Th1 response, and promote DC differentiation
  into Th17 cells. TLR8 induces the expression of IL-12B and IL-23A, promotes the
  differentiation of IL-23-dependent Th17 cells. TLR9 promotes the differentiation
  of Th1 cells. Green lines: TLR signaling pathways; black lines: TLRs related to
  Th cell differentiation; red lines: co-stimulation of TLRs induced to Th1 cell.'
