caption: Irisin (Ir) inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and the transcription factor
  Snail, which is the major downregulator of E-cadherin gene expression. Ir reverses
  the effect of IL-6 by increasing E-cadherin expression. Ir has also an inhibitory
  effect on the STAT3 signaling pathway and transcription factor Snail, which are
  activated by IL-6 and are crucial for EMT. Ir increases the phosphorylation of AMPK
  and decreases the phosphorylation of the downstream molecule of AMPK signaling (mTOR
  pathway), which leads to the inhibition of the expression of transcription factors
  and the inhibition of EMT.
