caption: '| Mechanisms of ferroptosis and ferroptosis inducers in lymphoma. The figure
  shows the regulatory pathways of ferroptosis can be divided into three categories.
  The first one is regulated by GSH/GPX4 pathway. The second one is the iron metabolism
  pathway that regulates the labile iron pool. The third category is the lipid metabolism
  pathways. Ferroptosis inducers that have been studied in lymphoma are listed: RSL-3,
  erastin, SASP and IKE can induce ferroptosis by inhibiting system Xc-; Kayadiol
  and APR-246 induce ferroptosis by both inhibiting system Xc- and promoting P53-P21
  pathway; ART could induce ferroptosis by activating the ATF4-CHOP-CHAC1 pathway
  or by increasing p21 expression. Fin56 induces ferroptosis by promoting degradation
  of GPX4 and depleting endogenous antioxidant coenzyme Q10. Abbreviations: RSL-3,
  RAS-selective-lethal-3; SASP, safasalazine; IKE, Imidazole-ketone-erastin; ART,
  Artesunate.'
