caption: On the left panel is a model depicting crosstalk between the PI3K/AKT pathway
  and the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway with each pathway negatively regulating
  the other. In the middle panel is the consequence of inhibiting AR signaling with
  downregulation of AR causing lower levels of FKBP5 and thus impairing the function
  of the AKT phosphatase PHLPP. The result is that AR inhibition causes an upregulation
  in AKT activity. In the right panel is the consequence of inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling
  with downregulation of AKT causing an induction of RTKs such as HER3 and this causing
  an induction of AR signaling.
