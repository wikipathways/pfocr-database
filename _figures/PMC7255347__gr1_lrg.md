caption: 'Innate Recognition, Interferon Signaling, and Immune Evasion by CoronavirusesUpon
  sensing of coronaviruses by various pathogen recognition receptors, TLRs (TLR3,
  TLR4, TLR7, TLR8; blue) and RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5; purple), transcription factors nuclear
  factor-κΒ (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 and 7 (IRF3, IRF7) stimulate
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I and III interferons (IFNs),
  respectively. IFNs are secreted in an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce expression
  of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. While
  type I and III IFNs induce a similar set of ISGs, type I IFN signaling activates
  a stronger and faster ISG response, in addition to expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines. Many viral proteins encoded by coronaviruses (red: SARS-CoV,
  green: MERS-CoV, black: multiple human coronaviruses) antagonize various steps of
  this antiviral response.'
