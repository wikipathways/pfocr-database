caption: The development of tamoxifen (TAM)-resistant breast cancer and the changing
  role of oestradiol (E2) in the life and death of ER-positive cancer cells. (A) E2-stimulated
  growth is inhibited by the use of an aromatase inhibitor to block oestrogen synthesis
  or TAM to block the ER and prevent oestrogen-stimulated gene transcription. Optimal
  antioestrogenic effects occur in the absence of pre-existing cell surface signalling
  mechanisms. (B) Prolonged use of TAM promotes an increase in HER2/neu cell surface
  signalling that creates a survival pathway phosphorylating the TAM ER complex and
  coactivator proteins. The transcription complex becomes activated to enhance gene
  activation and TAM-stimulated growth. If this is Phase I resistance, then oestrogen
  will also promote growth; so an aromatase inhibitor is an appropriate second-line
  therapy. If it is Phase II resistance, E2 causes apoptosis. (C) In Phase II tamoxifen
  resistance, the E2 ER complex collapses the survival mechanisms by dramatically
  reducing the level of cell surface signalling by preventing HER2/neu mRNA transcription
  and the nuclear level of NFκB, a transcription factor. (D) In Phase II tamoxifen
  resistance, the E2 ER complex also enhances the synthesis of Fas receptor mRNA and
  protein which, in the presence of Fas ligand (FasL) activates caspase 8 and a cascade
  of events resulting in apoptosis. These figures are summaries of the mechanisms
  described in  and .
