caption: Genes of the Tetrapyrrole Signaling Pathway Are Differentially Expressed
  in Different LLM-Domain B-GATA Genotypes.(A) Schematic representation of the tetrapyrrole
  biosynthesis pathway, with detailed view of the chlorophyll and phytochromobilin
  biosynthesis pathways. Genes that are up- or downregulated in Dex-induced Pro35S:GNC:YFP:HA:GR
  lines compared with mock-treated samples are displayed with up- or downward facing
  red arrowheads, respectively. Genes that are up- or downregulated in GNC overexpression
  lines compared with control samples are displayed with up- or downward facing blue
  arrowheads (). Genes that are up- or downregulated in gnc gnl or gnc gnl gata16
  gata17 gata17l (gataq) mutants compared with control samples are displayed with
  up- or downward facing light-green and dark-green arrowheads, respectively (; ).(B)
  Information on gene expression changes for the transcriptional regulators of the
  greening process in the same backgrounds. The respective fold changes are provided
  in Supplemental Figure 1 and Supplemental Data Sets 1 and 2.
