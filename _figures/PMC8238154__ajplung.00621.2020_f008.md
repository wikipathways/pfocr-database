caption: Changes in mRNA expression in response to EV-PA are attenuated in CF MDM.
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of seven cytokines that were detected at the mRNA level
  and their upstream regulators, all of which were differentially expressed (P < 0.05
  and absolute log2 FC > 1) in EV-PA exposed CF MDM compared with EV-PA exposed WT
  MDM. Genes that were reduced at the mRNA level in CF MDM compared with WT MDM are
  shaded in green, whereas those that were expressed at higher levels in CF MDM than
  WT MDM are shaded in red. Expression level fold changes between CF MDM and WT MDM
  are listed below each gene symbol. n = 3 donors each for WT and CF MDM exposed to
  EVs secreted by WT AEC from 4 donors or CF AEC from 3 donors. AEC, airway epithelial
  cell; CF, cystic fibrosis; EV, extracellular vesicles; EV-PA, EVs secreted by P.
  aeruginosa-exposed AEC; FC, fold change; MDM, monocyte-derived macrophages; WT,
  wild type.
