caption: 'Alterations in erythrocyte glutathione (GSH) metabolism in SCD. Normal GSH
  metabolism: GSH is a potent antioxidant responsible for maintaining cellular redox
  balance. GSH is synthesized from the amino acids glutamate, cysteine (the rate-limiting
  substrate), and glycine. Metabolism is catalyzed sequentially by 2 cytosolic enzymes,
  γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GSC) and glutathione synthetase (GS). This pathway
  occurs in virtually all cells, including erythrocytes, although hepatocytes are
  the major producer and exporter of GSH. Glutamate and cysteine are catalyzed by
  γ-GSC to γ-glutamyl-cysteine, which is metabolized to GSH through the actions of
  GS. GSH is directly oxidized to GSSG during scavenging of free radicals. It is also
  enzymatically oxidized by glutathione peroxidase (GPx) during the reduction of hydrogen
  peroxide and other peroxides. GSSG is then reduced and recycled back to GSH by the
  NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase (GR). During NADH and NADPH biosynthesis,
  glutamine is converted to glutamate. Although this is a process independent of GSH
  synthesis, the byproduct of this reaction is used as a substrate for GSH synthesis,
  while providing the essential co-enzyme for the recycling of GSH from GSSG by NADPH-dependent
  glutathione reductase.,, Alterations in GSH metabolism in SCD: Arrows indicate increased
  substrate and decreased GSH concentrations within the erythrocyte of patients with
  SCD. Despite more than adequate substrate, including cysteine, the rate-limiting
  amino acid for GSH production, GSH levels are very low in sickle erythrocytes. Further
  aberrations in GSH metabolism occur in patients with PH. Most notable is the erythrocyte
  glutamine depletion that occurs in patients with PH, compared with healthy volunteers
  and SCD patients without PH, while glutamate levels (significantly higher in SCD
  patients without PH compared with controls) begin to trend down in SCD patients
  with PH. Erythrocyte glutamine concentration and the glutamine:glutamate ratio inversely
  correlate with Doppler echocardiography tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity, a clinical
  marker of early mortality in SCD.'
