caption: Inhibition of innate immunity by arenavirus NP and Z. (A) Diagram of the
  type I interferon (IFN) induction and signaling pathways that play important roles
  as part of innate immunity against arenavirus infection. The IFN induction pathway
  triggered by RIG-I and MDA5 (collectively known as the RIG-I-like receptors or RLRs)
  is an important viral-defense pathway against arenaviruses. This RLR pathway can
  be blocked by arenavirus Z protein when it binds directly to RIG-I and MDA-5 and
  prevents the activation of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein.
  The action of NP in this pathway is more complex, as it exerts important effects
  at multiple steps. It is thought that the exoribonuclease function of NP can destroy
  pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) RNAs to blunt RIG-I and MDA-5 activation.
  At the same time, NP might be able to bind directly to RIG-I to prevent its activation.
  It can also bind to IKKε and prevent the activation of the IFN-responsive factor
  IRF3. NP is also capable of blocking NF-κB activation, a pathway that is thought
  to be activated by arenavirus glycoprotein GP via the Toll-like receptors (TLRs).
  Mouse experiments have also shown that arenaviruses can interfere with the p65 subunit
  of NF-κB, as well as STAT2, via an unknown mechanism.
