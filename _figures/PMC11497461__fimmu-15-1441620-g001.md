caption: Graphical representation of imatinib metabolism and transport. Imatinib uptake
  is facilitated by SLC22A1 transporters, both in the liver and in cancer cells. The
  primary metabolic pathway of imatinib involves demethylation mediated by CYP3A4,
  resulting in the formation of N-desmethylimatinib (norimatinib). While other CYP450
  enzymes, including CYP3A5, CYP2C8, CYP1A1, and CYP1A2, also participate in this
  process, their roles are relatively minor. Norimatinib, which retains similar activity
  to imatinib, undergoes further metabolism either through CYP3A4-mediated hydroxylation
  or through conjugation reactions (glucuronidation or sulfonation). These more hydrophilic
  metabolites are then excreted via urine or feces. Additionally, imatinib can be
  metabolized through minor pathways involving CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9,
  CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 leading to hydroxylated products or the formation of imatinib
  N-oxide metabolites, which are also excreted through urine and feces. In the figure,
  imatinib transporters are represented by red circles, while metabolizing enzymes
  are shown in yellow boxes. Major metabolic pathways are highlighted with thick arrows,
  while minor pathways are depicted with thin arrows. Dashed arrows indicate minor
  metabolic routes not shown in the figure. The primary enzymes involved in each metabolic
  step are indicated in bold text. Created with BioRender.com
