caption: The interplay of common cholesterol efflux factors and their relationship
  with selected chemotherapeutic agents. Cholesterol (C) can be effluxed from the
  cell via a variety of mechanisms including passive diffusion, SR-B1-facilitated
  diffusion, ABCA1 active reflux, and ABCG1-mediated efflux. Apo AI together with
  ABCA1 provides the rate-limiting step of RCT, with ABCG1 assisting in HDL lipidation.
  Both ABCA1 and ABCG1 are regulated by miR-33a. SR-B1 is able to bind HDL molecules
  and remove cholesterol esters from the HDL molecule for intracellular transport.
  Downstream effects of SR-B1 activity shows enhanced cellular proliferation and migration
  through MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, with the latter being shown to downregulate
  the mTORC1 pathway. Cholesterol movement involving cellular endosomes has been shown
  to be regulated by STARD3 and NPC1. STARD3 complexes with VAP on the ER to allow
  for cholesterol movement from the ER into the endosome, and has been shown to further
  move this cholesterol into the mitochondria for steroidogenesis. NPC1 mediates cholesterol
  efflux from the endosome, and has been shown to upregulate the mTORC1 pathway in
  the process. ASM, coded for by the SMPD1 gene, is found on HDL molecules, the plasma
  membrane, and cellular endosomes. ASM serves to convert sphingomyelin (S), formed
  in part by cholesterol, into phosphorylcholine (Phc) and ceramide (Cer).
