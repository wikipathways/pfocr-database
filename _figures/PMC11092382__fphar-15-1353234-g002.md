caption: Antitumor effects of sophocarpine through multiple signaling pathways. The
  antitumor activity of sophocarpine is mainly achieved by interfering with multiple
  signaling pathways in tumor cells. It can inhibit the proliferation and invasion
  of tumor cells, as well as their migration and metastasis. Additionally, sophocarpine
  can regulate the apoptotic signaling pathway in tumor cells, promoting their apoptosis
  and thus inhibiting tumor growth and spread. Furthermore, sophocarpine also exhibited
  immunomodulatory effects on tumors. Overall, as a natural compound, sophocarpine
  has promising potential in the field of cancer treatment
