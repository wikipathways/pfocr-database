caption: RAS regulation by posttranslational modifications. (A) RAS regulation by
  mono-ubiquitination. KRAS mono-ubiquitination at lysine 147 renders KRAS refractory
  to GAPs, while HRAS mono-ubiquitination at lysine 117 stimulates GEF independent
  GTP binding. Both mechanisms lead to the activation of downstream pathways such
  as ERK. (B) The constitutive lysosomal degradation of KRAS mediated by β-TrCP1 is
  impeded by Smurf2 mono-ubiquitinating UBCH5, which in turn poly ubiquinates β-TrCP1
  and marks it for proteasomal degradation. (C) RAS regulation by mono-/di-ubiquitination.
  Rabex-5 can mono/di-ubiquitination NRAS and HRAS inducing endosomal localization
  and inability to activate ERK. (D) HRAS and KRAS degradation can be triggered by
  GSK3β phosphorylation of threonines 144 and 148, which induces poly ubiquitination
  by β-TrCP1. When WNT signaling is activated, stabilized β-catenin can bind to KRAS
  and physically shield the threonines 144/148 from phosphorylation resulting in KRAS
  protein accumulation. (E) Negative RAS regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation. The
  SRC kinase can phosphorylate all three RAS isoforms at tyrosines 32 and 64 leading
  to inhibition of effector binding and enhancement of GAP binding. These phosphorylations
  can be reversed by the SHP-2 phosphatase, which can restore signaling. (F) The RIN1
  effector stimulates ABL mediated phosphorylation of Y137 which promotes RAF kinase
  binding and activation of the ERK pathway. However, RIN1 also stimulates Rabex-5-dependent
  ubiquitination of RAS, which leads to its endosomal sequestration. This ubiquitination
  is facilitated by the phosphorylation of tyrosine 4 by an unknown kinase. (G) PKC
  phosphorylation of KRAS at S181 has two effects. It reduces the interaction with
  GAPs prolonging KRAS signaling and induces the translocation of KRAS to the mitochondria,
  where it can bind to Bcl-XL and induce apoptosis.
