caption: Biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway of ABA. CrtZ, beta-carotene
  3-hydroxylase; ZEP, zeaxanthin epoxidase; PYL, pyrooxalate 1-like; PP2C, 2C protein
  phosphatase; SnRK, serine/threonine protein kinase. The heat map represents the
  expression profile of DEGs. Green represents down-regulation and red represents
  up-regulation. This point indicates the change in compound content in R. chrysanthum
  under UV-B radiation, with red dots being up-regulated and green dots being down-regulated
