caption: (A) The ‘inefficient’ Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle with the ‘slow’ carboxylase
  RubisCO as key enzyme, the cycle has a consumption of seven ATP per pyruvate or
  acetyl‐CoA produced, which does not include additional costs for photorespiration
  in aerobic conditions (Bar‐Even et al., ). (B) An example of a proposed, promising
  synthetic MOG‐pathway, based on the ‘faster’ carboxylase pyruvate carboxylase (Bar‐Even
  et al., ), estimates for its ATP consumption are based on assimilation via the bacterial
  glycerate pathway for pyruvate and the reverse glyoxylate shunt for acetyl‐CoA.
  Catalytic turnover rates indicated for both carboxylases are based on ambient CO
  2 concentrations (Bar‐Even et al., ).
