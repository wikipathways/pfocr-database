caption: 'Regulation of cell death via autophagy during Dengue virus infection: The
  entry of Dengue virus induces autophagy in the infected cell. The mechanisms of
  autophagy post-DENV infection are: A. Induction of ER stress to trigger the UPR
  responses, out of which 2 pathways, involving IRE1α and PERK, respectively, lead
  to the formation of autophagosomes in the cell. B. Autophagosome formation is also
  triggered by the involvement of ATM kinase to trigger the PERK pathway for autophagosome
  formation. C. AMPK, a kinase involved in lipophagy, is also exploited by the DENV
  to modulate the metabolic status of the cell. D. Apart from the common steps of
  autophagy, the DENV employs the proteasomal degradation of p62 to enhance its replication.
  The autophagosome in step 1 fuses with the lysosome to form the 2. Autolysosome
  structures which ultimately lead to 3. Autophagy and 4. Protein degradation.'
