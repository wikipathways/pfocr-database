caption: Effect of SFRP1 on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Wnt proteins (Wnt3a and
  Wnt10a) bind to FZD proteins located on the cell membrane to form a Wnt-FZD complex,
  which further binds to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5/6
  co-receptors, resulting in its cytoplasmic tail phosphorylation. When the pathway
  is not activated, β-catenin binds to the “destruction complex” composed of APC,
  GSK-3β, CK1α and Axin to promote its ubiquitin degradation. Once this pathway is
  activated, Axin dissociates from the destruction complex and binds to the phosphorylation
  site in the cytoplasmic tail of LRP. With the repositioning of Axin on LRP, the
  β-catenin released by the destruction complex is transported to the nucleus in the
  form of phosphorylation and binds to transcription factors, especially TCF and LEF,
  thereby regulating gene transcription and expression of related target genes. SFRP1
  binds Wnt ligands through its CRD, thus preventing it from binding to FZD receptors,
  eliminating the accumulation of β-catenin and blocking the expression of downstream
  genes.
