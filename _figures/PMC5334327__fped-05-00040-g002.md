caption: Mechanisms of protective strategies in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). (A)
  The enterocyte is the predominant cell type of the epithelium and significantly
  contributes to the exaggerated pro-inflammatory response observed in NEC upon activation
  of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) by Gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
  TLR4-mediated activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) results in increased expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. However, this signaling
  pathway can be attenuated through various mechanisms. Epidermal growth factor (EGF),
  which is found in breast milk and amniotic fluid, inhibits this pathway via inhibition
  of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β). The human milk oligosaccharide 2′-fucosyllactose
  (2′FL) also attenuates the TLR4 pro-inflammatory signaling pathway. Finally, intracellular
  pattern recognition receptor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing
  protein 2 upon stimulation by pathogen associated molecular patterns via second
  mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct inhibitor of apoptosis-binding
  protein with low pI (SMAC-diablo). (B) Endothelial cells have an integral role in
  the pathogenesis of NEC. Endothelial cells express TLR4, and upon stimulation by
  LPS following gut barrier dysfunction, decrease the expression of endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase (eNOS), thereby reducing the formation of nitric oxide (NO), an important
  vasodilator. This results in intestinal ischemia and subsequent NEC. However, several
  protective strategies increase the production of NO, including heparin-binding EGF-like
  growth factor (HB-EGF) and 2′FL by increasing expression of eNOS. Nitrates  and
  nitrites  can be found in breast milk and are precursors to NO, thus increasing
  NO production. Finally, l-arginine is required for NOS-dependent formation of NO.
  Supplementation with HB-EGF, nitrates, nitrites, and l-arginine are protective in
  NEC with their ability to improve intestinal blood supply via NO-mediated vasodilation.
