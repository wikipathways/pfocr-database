caption: 'Cerebral CYP enzymes in major exogenous substance metabolism—opioid biotransformation.
  (A) Hydrocodone metabolism: CYP3A4/5 catalyzes N-demethylation of hydrocodone to
  norhydrocodone, while CYP2D6 mediates O-demethylation to form the active metabolite
  hydromorphone. (B) Oxycodone metabolism: Oxycodone undergoes O-demethylation by
  CYP2D6 to produce the active metabolite oxymorphone and N-demethylation by CYP3A4/5
  to form noroxycodone. Noroxycodone and oxymorphone can be further metabolized to
  noroxymorphone through CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5. (C) Morphine metabolism: Morphine is
  converted to normorphine via N-demethylation mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. These
  pathways emphasize the significant role of cerebral CYP enzymes in the metabolism,
  pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of opioid drugs within the central nervous
  system'
