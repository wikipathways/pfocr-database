caption: After spontaneous oligomerizaton or induction by cytoplasmic factors, the
  activation of chimeric ALK triggers transforming events, such as proliferation and
  apoptosis inhibition, cellular immunophenotyping (CD30 upregulation), and abnormal
  morphological changes (anaplasia), migration and invasion. Following ALK activation,
  the recruitment of IRS-1, Src, and Shc and the subsequent stimulation of Shp2-Grb2/SOS,
  Shp2-Src, and PLCγ-DAG/IP3-PKC could synergistically activate the RAS-Erk pathway,
  up-regulating the expression of cyclin A and cyclin D, and down-regulating the expression
  of p21, which could also be a target of the JUK-Jun-AP1 pathway triggered by ALK
  activation. In addition, the PI3K-PIP3-Akt and Jak3-STAT3 pathways also could be
  triggered by the activation of ALK. As a result, cyclin D expression would be abnormally
  regulated, the expression of Bcl2/Bcl-XL, Bim, MCL1, survivin would be up-regulated,
  whereas the expression of p27 and Bad would be down-regulated. Consequently, these
  abnormally regulated cell cycle- and apoptosis-related molecules could stimulate
  cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. Moreover, Ras-Erk and PI3K-PIP3-Akt activation
  could target mTOR to stimulate certain translation-associated factors (such as p70S6K,
  S6RP, and elF4EBP1) and enhance cell proliferation. Stimulating the Ras-Erk and
  Jak3/STAT3 pathways could induce JunB phosphorylation and AP1 up-regulation, and
  STAT3 dimerization in the nucleus, respectively. As a result, the transcriptional
  activity of CD30 gene would increase. The simulation of Src, Shp2, p130Cas, and
  Vav-Rac1 could be induced by ALK activation. As a consequence, cytoskeletal arrangement
  and dynamics would be abnormally regulated, inducing changes in morphology (anaplasia)
  and transformation (migration and invasion). Green arrows represent activation or
  up-regulation; red semi-bars represent inhibition or down-regulation.
