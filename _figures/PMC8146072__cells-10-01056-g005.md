caption: Reprogramming of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in cancer. Upregulation
  of the PPP is achieved primarily through upregulation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PD) by PI3K, mTORC1, KRAS, and NRF2. This shunts glucose into the oxidative branch
  of the PPP instead of into glycolysis. Inhibitors of G6PD, pTEN, p53, and AMPK are
  often found mutated in cancer. Upregulation of the nonoxidative branch of the PPP
  in cancer occurs via NRF2, which increases transketolase (TKT) and transaldolase
  (TALDO) expression. There is also crosstalk between glycolysis and the PPP via KRAS,
  which increases hexokinase (HK) expression to upregulate glycolytic intermediates
  for progression into the PPP. Modulation of the PPP in this manner results in the
  production of energy and substrates necessary for tumor growth. F6P; fructose 6-phosphate,
