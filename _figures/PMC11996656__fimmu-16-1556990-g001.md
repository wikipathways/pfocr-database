caption: Mechanisms of classical, non-classical, and other pathways involved in pyroptosis.
  In the classical pathway, PRRs detect intracellular and extracellular signals, initiating
  the NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling cascade and activating the inflammasome. This activation
  leads to the cleavage of Caspase-1, which cleaved GSDMD. GSDMD then aggregates and
  inserts into the plasma membrane to form a membrane pore. Subsequently, Caspase-1
  facilitates the release of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-18, promoting
  ion flow, water influx, cell swelling, and eventual cell rupture through the GSDMD
  pore, leading to pyroptosis. In the atypical pathway, LPS activates Pro Caspase-4/5/11,
  promoting the production of IL-1β and IL-18, production and inducing pyroptosis.
  Furthermore, Caspase-11 activation leads to intracellular K+ efflux and ATP release
  through the cleavage and modification of Pannexin-1. When ATP binds to P2X7R, it
  opens Ca2+ and Na+ influx channels, leading to rapid depolarization and pyroptosis.
  Additionally, in other pathways, TKA1 enhances Caspase-8 activation, initiating
  the GSDMD pore formation. Similarly, CTLs, NK cells, and the chemotherapeutic agent
  Caspase-3 activate the GSDME pore. These processes promote the production of inflammatory
  factors that ultimately contribute to pyroptosis. (Created with BioGDP.com)
