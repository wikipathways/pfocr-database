caption: 'Electrochemical detection of nucleic acids on the bioelectronic sensor using
  a sandwich assay. A: Schematic diagram of the sandwich assay for electronic detection
  of nucleic acids. The gold electrode is coated with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM)
  that includes (1) DNA-alkanethiols containing the capture probe sequence (one shown
  for simplicity), (2) thiol-terminated oligophenylethynyl molecules, also called
  molecular wires, and (3) alkanethiols terminated in polyethylene glycol insulator.
  The molecular wires provide a pathway for electron transfer between the ferrocenes
  and the gold in response to potential changes at the electrode. The alkanethiols
  terminated in ethylene glycol serve as insulators to block access of redox species
  in solution to the electrode, including free signaling probes. A target nucleic
  acid is shown annealed to a capture probe and a ferrocene-labeled signaling probe.
  B: Scheme depicting electrochemical oxidation of a ferrocene-labeled adenosine derivative
  from Fe(II) to Fe(III). Interfacial electron transfer from ferrocene to the gold
  electrode is detected as faradaic current. C: A representative voltammogram is shown.
  An electrode array was prepared with capture probes complementary to HIV or HCV.
  A 1-μmol/L solution of HIV target mimic and 2.5 μmol/L of both the HIV and HCV signaling
  probes were introduced into the hybridization chamber. After 1 minute of hybridization,
  an electrode modified with HIV capture probes was interrogated by AC voltammetry
  and the output current was recorded (solid line). An electrode modified with HCV
  capture probes was interrogated immediately afterward, and the output current was
  recorded (dashed line). Automated software has been developed to measure the peak
  height of the faradaic current relative to the baseline capacitive current. The
  peak height in the example shown is approximately 120 nA (310 nA peak −190 nA capacitive
  current = 120 nA, at the center). The faradaic current is recorded as a peak with
  a center at approximately 175 mV, coincident with the redox potential of ferrocene
  relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode.'
