caption: The mechanisms of the regulatory network and function of miR-517a in OS in
  melanoma. miR-517a was highly expressed, while CDKN1C was downregulated. H2O2 could
  inhibit the miR-517a expression and the JNK/p38 signaling pathway to affect the
  levels of apoptosis-related factors and OS-related factors, ROS and MDA
papertitle: Silencing of microRNA-517a induces oxidative stress injury in melanoma
  cells via inactivation of the JNK signaling pathway by upregulating CDKN1C.
