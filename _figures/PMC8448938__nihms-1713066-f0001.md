caption: CD73 is a ubiquitously expressed ecto-nucleotidase of the purine metabolism
  pathway. As a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored glycoprotein on the plasma
  membrane, CD73 works in tandem with ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1
  (CD39), which breaks down adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to form adenosine 5’-monophosphate
  (AMP) in a two-step process. Alternatively, AMP can be generated via direct conversion
  from ATP by the enzyme ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (ENPP1).
  CD73 is the major enzyme that dephosphorylates AMP to generate extracellular adenosine
  (Ado), but this reaction can also be carried out by tissue non-specific alkaline
  phosphatase (TNAP) or prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). CD73-generated adenosine
  directly exerts tissue-specific functions by binding to four different types of
  G-coupled adenosine receptors (AdoR), which regulate oxygen supply/demand ratios,
  inflammation and angiogenesis in a receptor-dependent manner. Additionally, adenosine
  is transported into the cytoplasm through equilibrative and concentrative nucleoside
  transporters (ENTs and CNTs). Due to its role in inflammatory responses and tumor
  growth and metastasis, small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies against
  CD73 are currently being tested in clinical trials for cancer immunotherapy and
  COVID-19 therapy.
