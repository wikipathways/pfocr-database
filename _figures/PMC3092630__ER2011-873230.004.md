caption: Biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids in trypanosomatids. This is an
  important pathway that takes place in trypanosomatids and has been recently described
  [, ]. Cytochrome b5 operates as the electron donor for desaturation, both as an
  independent enzyme or as a domain at the N-terminus of the desaturase (wildcards).
  Δ12, Δ15 (ω3) and Δ4-desaturases are absent from mammalian hosts and are potential
  targets for trypanocidal agents.
