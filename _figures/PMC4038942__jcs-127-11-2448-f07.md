caption: Hypothetical tescalcin- and CSN-mediated signaling pathway. Representation
  of the molecular events that are associated with tescalcin and the CSN complex.
  Tescalcin is upregulated in response to MAP–ERK activation (). A direct, Ca2+-mediated
  interaction with CSN4 inhibits the CSN-mediated regulation of the SCF E3 ubiquitin
  ligase. In the process of differentiation, an increase in Cul1 neddylation leads
  to stabilization of p27kip1 and other cell cycle regulators, and cell cycle arrest.
  Tescalcin can also regulate expression of p53, c-Jun and other transcription factors
  through regulation of their transcription and, possibly, other currently unknown
  mechanisms (see text for details).
