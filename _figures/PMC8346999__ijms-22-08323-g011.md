caption: UBR1/2 mediated SDE2’s C-terminal fragment degradation upon replication stress,
  leading to recovering a stalled replication fork. The irradiation of cells with
  ultraviolet C, one of the causes of DNA replication stress, results in DNA lesions
  that block replication. The Arg/N-degron pathway is involved in counteracting DNA
  replication stress. Monoubiquitination of PCNA plays a vital role in coordinating
  DNA repair against replication-blocked lesions by providing a platform to recruit
  factors necessary for DNA repair. To counteract DNA replication stress, the C-terminal
  fragment of SDE2 needs to be degraded (A). Under UV-induced replication stress,
  SDE2 is targeted to the replication fork by interacting with PCNA through the PIP
  box of the UBL domain. After which, a C-terminal fragment of SDE2 (SDECt) is generated
  by the cleavage of the diglycine motif by DUB. Intriguingly, SDECt inhibits UV damage-inducible
  PCNA monoubiquitination by RAD18 ubiquitin E3 ligase. (B) Damage-inducible SDE2
  Ct phosphorylation of Ser266 or Thr319, or both by ATR. (C) SDE2Ct, which has an
  N-terminal lysine, is recognized by UBR1 and UBR2 for polyubiquitination. In addition,
  phosphorylated SDE2Ct facilitates the interaction of p97UFD1-NPL4 and enables the
  extraction of ubiquitinated SDE2Ct from chromatin. (D) Consequently, degradation
  of SDECt by the Arg/N-degron pathway-ATR- p97UFD1-NPL4 axis promotes the monoubiquitination
  of PCNA by RAD18 E3 ligase, leading to DNA damage bypass, stalled fork recovery,
  and S phase progression.
