caption: Two major pathways for tRNA import into mitochondria.One pathway utilizes
  the protein import machinery including the translocases of the outer membrane (TOMs)
  and inner membrane (TIMs). This pathway has thus far only been described in the
  import of tRNALysCUU in yeast and is depicted in the left side of the Figure. In
  this pathway, the imported tRNA is first aminoacylated by its cognate cytoplasmic
  synthetase (cyto-LysRS), bound by the pre-mitochondrial lysyl tRNA synthetase (pre-mitoLysRS)
  and with the aid of enolase is delivered to the mitochondrial surface. The complex
  is then translocated via the protein import machinery, while enolase remains in
  the cytoplasm where it can start a new import cycle. The second and perhaps phylogenetically
  the most widely distributed pathway does not require cytoplasmic factors and it
  is not directly dependent on the protein import machinery. However, various factors
  may play a role in various organisms including the VDAC (plants), tRNA thiolation
  (Leishmania but not in T. brucei), etc. In the specific case of T. brucei, the translation
  elongation factor eEF1a plays a role in delivering the tRNA to the mitochondrial
  import machinery. This role is similar to that of enolase in yeast, but has yet
  to be demonstrated in other organisms. In L. tropica, the RNA import complex (RIC)
  was recently described and is formed by six essential subunits, all are identical
  to subunits of the respiratory complex. In T. brucei, however, at least one of the
  essential RIC subunits is not involved in tRNA import; therefore, the pathway may
  differ between the two organisms despite being evolutionarily closely related.
