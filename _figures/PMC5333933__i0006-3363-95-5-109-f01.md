caption: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) originate through different mechanisms. A) Microvesicles
  (100–1500 nm) are formed by the outward budding and fission of plasma membrane lipid
  microdomains (highlighted blue), controlled by regulatory proteins and cytoskeletal
  elements (highlighted red) that coordinate membrane curvature at ceramide-enriched
  domains, resulting in vesicular protrusion and budding. Not all plasma-membrane
  proteins are incorporated into the shed vesicles, although the topology of membrane
  proteins remains intact. Microvesicles are enriched in some lipids such as cholesterol,
  whereas phosphatidylserine is relocated to the outer membrane leaflet specifically
  at sites of microvesicle shedding. Mechanisms involved in the formation and release
  of microvesicles is still being investigated. B) Exosomes (30–150 nm) initiate as
  intraluminal vesicles during endosomal maturation from the late endosome (multivesicular
  bodies [MVBs]). Following the ubiquitin-dependent interactions with ESCRT complexes,
  MVBs are sorted for lysosomal degradation. Alternatively, ALIX interacts with MVB
  cargo, preventing lysosomal degradation and facilitating an ubiquitin-independent
  pathway. Rab GTPases and various other components regulate MVB sorting to the plasma
  membrane with which the MVB fuse and are released as exosomes. Adapted from Nawaz
