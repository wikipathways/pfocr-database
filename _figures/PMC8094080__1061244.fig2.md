caption: Signaling in JAK2 V617F cells before, during, and after discontinuation of
  ruxolitinib. Schematic representation of JAK-STAT activation in JAK2 V617F myeloproliferative
  neoplastic cells. (A) JAK2 V617F leads to increased signaling through STAT5/STAT3/ERK
  leading to proliferation and inflammation. (B) In the presence of a type 1 JAK2
  inhibitor, such as ruxolitinib, signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway is abrogated,
  but so too is ubiquitination and degradation of JAK2, leading to accumulation of
  p-JAK2. Signaling through MEK/ERK remains activated and contributes to disease persistence.
  (C) Ruxolitinib discontinuation leads to transiently increased signaling through
  the accumulated pool of p-JAK2 with inflammatory symptoms.
