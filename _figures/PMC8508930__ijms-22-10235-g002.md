caption: Influence of gut dysbiosis on serotonergic signaling in pathology of IBS.
  A dysbiotic condition with abundant microbial species that upregulate 5-HT pathway
  and/or diminished microbial groups that downregulate 5-HT signaling results in massive
  synthesis and hyperavailability of 5-HT through activating enterochromaffin (EC)
  cells and tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), and decreasing expression of serotonin
  reuptake transport (SERT). Excessive 5-HT can induce low-grade mucosal inflammation,
  enhance visceral pain sensation, and promote GI motility, potentially leading to
  IBS-D development. In contrast, the other dysbiotic condition with decreased microbial
  species that upregulate 5-HT pathway and/or increased microbial groups that downregulate
  5-HT signaling causes limited production of 5-HT, resulting in impaired GI motility.
  This condition may be associated with IBS-C or chronic constipation. Trp, L-tryptophan;
  IBS-D, diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome; IBS-C, constipation-predominant
  irritable bowel syndrome.
