caption: Ubiquitination in DSB repair pathway choice. Open DNA ends are rapidly recognized
  by the Ku70/80 heterodimer. The choice between NHEJ and HR at the DSB is controlled
  by the competition between 53BP1 and BRCA1. In a NHEJ-permissive environment, 53BP1
  builds a complex via ATM in a phosphorylation-dependent manner with its binding
  partners RIF1 and PTIP. The 53BP1-PTIP-RIF1 complex prevents recruitment of BRCA1
  to the break and, therefore, antagonizes HR. The E3 ubiquitin ligase KEAP1 ubiquitinates
  PALB2 at the BRCA1 binding site and prevents assembling of the BRCA1-BRCA2-PALB2
  complex, thus, promoting NHEJ. This process is balanced by the DUB USP11 and controlled
  by the cell cycle. BRCA1 antagonizes NHEJ by impairing retention of RIF1 at DSB
  sites in a CtIP- or UHRF1-dependent manner. Ubiquitin-dependent degradation of CtIP
  by the APC/C in NHEJ prevents resection process, in contrast to HR, where CtIP is
  not degraded but phosphorylated by the CDKs. The RNF8-RNF168-mediated ubiquitination
  on chromatin provides a binding platform for both 53BP1 and BRCA1. Later RNF8 also
  ubiquitinates Ku70/80 to facilitate its proteasomal degradation and removal from
  the broken DNA ends. In a HR-permissive environment the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF138
  ubiquitinates Ku to remove it from DSB much earlier compared to NHEJ, allowing end-resection
  factors to gain access to the deprotected ends. RNF138 also ubiquitinates CtIP,
  enhancing its retention on damaged chromatin. At the later steps of NHEJ the ligation
  of broken ends promoted by FBXW7 that recognizes phosphorylated XRRC4 and subsequently
  ubiquitinates it. In contrast during the later steps of HR, RPA SUMOylation-guided
  ubiquitination by RNF4 promotes RPA turnover and RAD51 recruitment. Multi-site ubiquitination
  of RPA by the ubiquitin ligases RFWD3 and PRP19 also facilitates HR.
