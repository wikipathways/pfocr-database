caption: Sphingosine kinase (SphK)/sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) inside–outside model.
  SphK1 is primarily located in the cytosol and SphK2 is mainly localised in the inner
  mitochondrial membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nucleus. Sphingosine
  (Sph) is converted to S1P via SphKs and this process can be reversed via S1P phosphatases
  (S1PPase), which dephosphorylate S1P or are hydrolysed by S1P lyase to maintain
  dynamic equilibrium. S1P catalysed by SphK1 is transported outside the cell via
  ABC/Spns2 transporters where S1P binds to S1P transmembrane receptors (S1PR1-5).
  Binding of S1P to its cognate receptors on self and other cells activates intracellular
  signalling pathways. The SphK2/S1P pathway regulates processes in the nucleus such
  as transcription and telomere maintenance, as well as processes in the mitochondria,
  and is involved in mitochondrial respiration [].
