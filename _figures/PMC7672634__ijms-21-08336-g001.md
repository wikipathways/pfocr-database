caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of FGF/FGFR pathway suppressed by cordycepin in
  MA-10 cells. Microarray analysis was performed on MA-10 cells treated with either
  100 μM cordycepin or a vehicle for 3 h. The genes significantly up- and down-regulated
  by cordycepin were overlaid onto the canonical signaling pathways by using an Ingenuity
  Pathways Analysis (IPA) program (IPA, QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis).
  The genes significantly regulated by cordycepin were mapped onto the canonical FGF
  signaling pathway. The activation or inhibition effects of the pathways were predicted
  by the molecule activity predictor (MAP) overlay tools in the IPA program. Red-Green
  color indicates the level of gene expression. Blue color indicates the inhibitory
  effect, whereas an orange color indicates an activating effect. Yellow color means
  that the finding is inconsistent with the state of downstream molecules, and a gray
  color means no prediction on the path.
