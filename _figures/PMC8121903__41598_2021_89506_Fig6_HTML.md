caption: A schematic model for two distinct EA-mediated pro-apoptotic signaling pathways
  in response to DNA damage. Industrial TFAs such as EA and LEA promote cell death
  triggered by Dox (a DSB-inducing agent) and CDDP (an ICL-inducing agent) through
  two distinct pro-apoptotic signaling pathways. Upon Dox exposure, TFAs enforce mitochondrial
  ROS generation via the mitochondrial JNK-Sab (a JNK adaptor protein localized at
  outer membrane of mitochondria) axis, which in turn enhance JNK/p38 MAPK activation,
  and consequently promote apoptosis independently of ASK1 and p53. On the other hand,
  upon CDDP exposure, TFAs drive Nox/RIP1-dependent ROS generation, and thereby enhance
  activation of the ASK1-p38/JNK MAPK pathway, leading to increased p53-dependent
  apoptosis. The latter mechanism possibly accounts for TFA-mediated promoting effect
  on cell death induced by acetaldehyde, a major endogenous source of ICLs that accumulates
  by unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, such as cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking,
  or decreased acetaldehyde metabolism. Through these mechanisms, TFAs may contribute
  to the development and progression of TFA-related diseases, including cardiovascular
  diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, closely related to DNA damage along with
  individual difference in lifestyle factors and acetaldehyde metabolism.
