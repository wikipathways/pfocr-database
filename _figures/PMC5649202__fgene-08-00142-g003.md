caption: 'Gene regulatory network (GRN) inferred for members from the NRF2 pathway.
  Red-colored edges: interactions predicted for carcinogenic group; Blue-colored edges:
  interactions predicted for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) group. Cluster in the
  upper section indicate starting nodes, while clusters in the lower section are comprised
  of target genes specific to each chemical group.'
