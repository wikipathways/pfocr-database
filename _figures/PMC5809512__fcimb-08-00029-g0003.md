caption: Regulation pathways of C. difficile spore germination. This figure was drawn
  based on the references (Paredes-Sabja et al., ; Fimlaid et al., ). Regulation of
  box GerG, GerS, CspA, and SpoVAC texted in red were drawn in this figure based on
  the recent advances in C. difficile spore germination. GerS, GerG, and SpoVAC proteins
  were characterized by Shen group, recently (Fimlaid et al., ; Donnelly et al., ,
  ). CspC-germinant receptor and completion of germination were scheduled in the orange
  boxes. Black arrows indicate the regulatory relationship between the factors has
  been confirmed, dashed arrows indicate the regulatory relationship between the factors
  has not been tested. Thick black/red arrow indicates central signal pathway in germination
  progress. Question marks indicate that there is suggestive, but no conclusive experimental
  evidence.
