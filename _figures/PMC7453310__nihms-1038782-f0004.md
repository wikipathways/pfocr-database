caption: 'Alternative splicing regulation of the oncogenic MYC and RAS-MAPK pathways.
  (a) MYC increases the expression of splicing regulators PTB, SRSF1, and hnRNPA1,
  A2, and H, which in turn change the expression of isoforms of PKM, RAF, MAX, and
  S6K1. hnRNPA1, A2, and PTB promote the expression of PKM2, a variant of PKM that
  promotes aerobic glycolysis. hnRNPA1 has also been found to promote the expression
  of delta MAX, an isoform of MAX that further promotes MYC-dependent transformation
  and glycolytic gene expression. hnRNPH, under a MYC oncogenic background, promotes
  the expression of active oncogenic RAF while repressing the short RAF containing
  only the RBD, which inhibits RAS. The splicing factor SRSF1 can affect the splicing
  of S6K1, inducing oncogenic short isoforms of this kinase (h6A and h6C), which bind
  mTOR and enhance 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and cap-dependent translation.(b) Multiple
  splicing factor regulators change the expression of oncogenic isoforms of proteins
  involved in the RAS-MAPK pathway. Receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR, are alternatively
  spliced to generate truncated isoforms, which act in a dominant-negative manner,
  or constitutively active isoforms (EGFRvIII), which are active regardless of ligand
  binding. RAS can be alternatively spliced to generate RAS4A, an isoform commonly
  found in cancers. RAS activates RAF, which can be alternatively spliced to generate
  a short isoform with RBDs that inhibit RAS or constitutively active isoforms containing
  only the kinase domain. hnRNPH inhibits the production of dominant-negative RAF
  isoforms. RAF phosphorylates MEK, which in turn phosphorylates ERK. ERK can phosphorylate
  MNK2, which is alternatively spliced and regulated by SRSF1. SRSF1 upregulates a
  pro-oncogenic MNK2B isoform and reduces the MNK2A isoform. Figure adapted from .
