caption: In cell types not expressing TASL, PHT1 uses the proton motive force for
  the transport of oligopeptides and other ligands from the lumen of the endolysosome
  to the cytosol, thereby regulating endosomal pH but also enabling NOD1/2 complex
  formation leading to NF-κB activation. In endolysosomal TLR signaling, PHT1 has
  a transport activity-independent function. PHT1 acts as a receptor for the engagement
  of TASL. Once the complex is formed, the adaptor protein TASL can be phosphorylated
  by the IKKβ kinase and in turn can recruit and activate IRF5 and subsequently promote
  the production of type I IFN genes. TASL can only recognize the inward-open conformation
  of PHT1. If the transporter is locked in the outward-open conformation, the signaling
  pathway will be inhibited.
