caption: Proposed signaling pathway underlying the effect of HIF-1α-mediated TRAIL-induced
  neuronal apoptosis after TBI. Microglia increased TRAIL expression after TBI, which
  activated neuronal DR5 receptor and initiated caspase cascade to apoptosis. Meanwhile,
  TBI also upregulated HIF-1α expression and further inhibited DcR1 expression. This
  indirectly increased DR5 function by dismissing the competitive effect of DcR1 to
  DR5 and then promoted TRAIL-induced neuronal apoptosis.
