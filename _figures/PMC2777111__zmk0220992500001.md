caption: Transcriptional regulation of genes mediating sterol uptake. In the presence
  of oxygen, yeast cells synthesize sterols and are unable to take up sterols from
  the extracellular medium. In contrast, under anaerobiosis cells rely on sterol uptake,
  because sterol synthesis requires oxygen. Under these conditions, the transcriptional
  regulators Sut1, Upc2, and Ecm22 promote the expression of AUS1, DAN1, and PDR11
  and less well characterized genes (Y), which mediate sterol import. The underlying
  mechanisms of this transcriptional regulation are largely unknown. Here, we show
  that the PAKs Ste20, Cla4, and Skm1 can translocate into the nucleus, where they
  bind to the transcriptional regulator Sut1. The fact that the PAKs negatively regulate
  expression of AUS1, DAN1, and PDR11, suggests that PAKs inhibit Sut1 and/or Upc2
  and Ecm22 by a novel mechanism. As demonstrated for Ste20, the down-regulation of
  gene expression requires its kinase activity. However, since there is no evidence
  for Sut1 phosphorylation by PAKs, an unknown protein (X), phosphorylated by PAKs,
  may be involved in the control of transcriptional regulators. Because sterol synthesis
  is crucial for cell polarization under aerobic conditions, it seems likely that
  sterol uptake plays an equally important role in the absence of oxygen.
