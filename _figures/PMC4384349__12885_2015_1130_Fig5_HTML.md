caption: Schematic presentation of VEGFR-1 activation in CC tissue and its association
  with metastasis. VEGF produced in the tumor center and PlGF produced intratumorally
  and in tumor budding regions by tumor cells have an autocrine affinity for their
  receptor VEGFR-1. Subsequent PlGF-mediated receptor activation by autophosphorylation
  at Tyr1048 and Tyr1213 is a potential signaling pathway, which in turn seems to
  inhibit distant metastasis and, in regions of tumor budding, additionally lymph
  node metastasis. This autocrine link could be supported by possible formation of
  PlGF-VEGF heterodimers and PlGF-PlGF homodimers, which are known to have anti-metastatic
  properties. In contrast, in order to enhance their potential for distant metastasis,
  tumor cells in the tumor center produce paracrine-acting VEGF-B. Inflammatory cell
  associated VEGFR-1 expression in the invasive front (zone 2) without accompanying
  autophosphorylation could inhibit distant metastasis possibly by acting as a decoy
  and scavenger receptor. In small vessels located intratumorally (zone 1) paracrine-mediated
  receptor autophosphorylation at Tyr1048 and Tyr1213 and paracrine-acting VEGF-B
  production appear to be associated with a non-metastatic phenotype. In small vessels
  located along the invasive front (zone 2) paracrine-mediated receptor autophosphorylation
  at Tyr1213 may cause inhibition of metastasis. Autocrine-acting PlGF production
  by small vessels located extratumorally (zone 3) appears to be associated with a
  non-metastatic phenotype. In contrast, VEGF-B-expressing extratumoral small vessels
  correlate with distant metastasis.
