caption: Lactate is a signaling molecule in cancer and endothelial cells. The cartoon
  depicts on endothelial cell in close proximity of an oxidative cancer cell, and
  a hypoxic/glycolytic cancer cell is further away. Lactate is produced from glucose
  in the hypoxic/glycolytic cancer cell, and intracellular lactate activates a NDRG3-Raf-ERK1/2
  tumor growth-promoting pathway. Once exported (usually a MCT4-dependent process),
  lactate diffuses along its concentration gradient and influences the oxidative cancer
  cell and the endothelial cell. Extracellular lactate can bind to lactate receptor
  GPR81 in the oxidative cancer cell, supporting mitochondrial biogenesis, lactate
  transport and signaling. It can also enter into the cell (usually a MCT1-dependent
  process), where it promotes pro-angiogenic signaling and glutaminolysis. Similarly,
  the endothelial cell expresses MCT1 and can therefore take up lactate. There, lactate
  triggers additional pro-angiogenic pathways. Plain lines and dotted lines represent
  well-established and presumptive cascades, respectively. + refers to stimulation.
