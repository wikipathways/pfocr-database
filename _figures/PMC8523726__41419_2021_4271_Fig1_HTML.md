caption: A Under physiological (nutrient) conditions, phosphorylated TFEB is inactive
  and degradation occurs via the proteasomal pathway. Under starvation or stress,
  TFEB is activated by kinase inactivation or phosphatase activation-mediated dephosphorylation,
  and is subsequently transferred to the nucleus to upregulate the expression of its
  target genes. TFEB acetylation at K274 and K279 blocks TFEB nucleation–,. B Lysosomes
  have several biological functions, including membrane repair, secretion, energy
  metabolism, and signal transduction,–. AMPK, adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated
  protein kinase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; STUB1, STIP1-homologous U-Box containing
  protein 1; TFEB, transcription factor EB.
