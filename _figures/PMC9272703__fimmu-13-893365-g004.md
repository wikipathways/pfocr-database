caption: Overview of altered N-glycosylation pathways regarding T cells during chronic
  inflammation. (A) Differentiation of lymphocytes and thus their surface N-glycome
  is under the direct influence of cytokines and stimulation by antigen presenting
  cells (APCs). Cytokines control differentiation in favor of proinflammatory T cells
  (Th1, Th17, Tfh), thereby altering their N-glycome by dysregulating the expression
  of glycosyltransferases such as MGAT5, ST6GAL1 and FUT8 and abrogating substrate
  availability for the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). The resulting N-glycan
  changes significantly reduce the binding affinity of inhibitory galectins and Siglecs.
  (B) Schematic representation of the relevant cytokines responsible for the T cell
  differentiation. GLUT, glucose transporter; TCR, T cell receptor; Tfh, T follicular
  helper cell; Th, T helper cell; Treg, T regulatory cell.
