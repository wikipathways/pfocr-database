caption: Pantothenate de novo synthesis pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and transcription
  profiles of pantothenate biosynthetic genes under different growth conditions. Pantothenate
  can be imported by the proton symporter Fen2 or synthesized de novo by condensation
  of pantoate (shown in cyan) and β‐alanine (shown in yellow) in an ATP‐dependent
  reaction catalyzed by Pan6. Pantoate is formed in a two‐step pathway from 2‐keto‐isovalerate
  catalyzed by Ecm31 and Pan5 with 2‐dehydropantoate as intermediate. β‐alanine is
  formed starting from spermine by the enzymes Fms1 and Ald2‐3 via 3‐aminopropanal.
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; NADP+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
