caption: Several key molecular components participate in the initiation, execution
  and completion of autophagy. Autophagy inducers such as starvation modulate the
  inhibitory interaction of TORC1 with the ULK1/2 complex. Through phosphorylation
  of Ambra1, and maybe through other putative interactions, ULK1/2 complex (A) also
  regulates the activity of Beclin 1/ class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
  complex (B). Beclin 1 interacts with several enhancing (blue) or inhibitory (grey)
  factors that modulate its binding to Vps34, the catalytic unit of the PI3K, whose
  lipid kinase activity is essential for autophagy. In addition to these two complexes,
  autophagosome formation requires the participation of two ubiquitin-like protein
  (Atg12 and Atg8/LC3) conjugation systems and two transmembrane proteins (Atg9 and
  VMP-1) (C). Whereas the roles of Atg9 and VMP-1 are currently not completely understood,
  both conjugation systems are essential for the biogenesis of the isolation membrane,
  also called ‘phagophore’. In addition, the Atg8/LC3 system is required for autophagosome
  transport and maturation, as well as for the selection of autophagic cargo. Fully
  mature autophagosomes can fuse with Rab7-positive late endosomes to form amphisomes.
  Finally, autophagosomes or amphisomes fuse their external membranes with those from
  acidic lysosomes to acquire hydrolytic activity, degrade their cargo and recycle
  essential biomolecules to the cytoplasm (D).
