caption: Recognition of pro-inflammatory stimuli, presence of microbial cell wall
  components, secreted TNFα or various other cytokines, through their respective receptors
  triggers a pro-inflammatory first response of the IEC. The NFκB pathway is activated
  through the phosphorylation of IκB by the Iκ-kinases α and β. This phosphorylation
  allows for its recognition by the neddylated Skp-Cullin-F-Box (SCF) complex, polyubiquitination
  and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Neddylation of Cullins is achieved through
  a multienzyme process, conjugating a NEDD8 moiety to the target protein. NEDD8,
  in order to be conjugated has to be processed from its pro-form to the mature form
  by the isopeptidase SENP8. The same protein, in addition to the COP9 signalosome
  removes NEDD8 from Cullins. Neddylated Cullins are integrated into SCF complex and
  activate it to enable SCF complex mediated ubiquitination. The NFκB heterodimer
  can then translocate to the nucleus and bind to the promoter regions of various
  pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β and interferon-γ. This
  can further promote inflammation, e.g. by TNFα induced apoptosis through the FADD
  pathway, and barrier breakdown, but also abrogate the incoming stimulus by induction
  of NUB1 through the interferon receptor. Anti-inflammatory mechanisms include the
  induction of deneddylation of Cullin-proteins through adenosine and ROS mediated
  inhibition of the E2 ligase NEDD8/UBC12.
