caption: '(a) The transmembrane network of n-hexadecane. 1: the previous research
  of the transmembrane network of n-hexadecane. It directly traverse the outer membrane
  of bacteria while do not be changed into other substances. 2: the novel insight
  was proposed. The n-hexadecane might be changed into hexadecanoic acid before traverse
  the outer membrane of bacteria. (b) The evidences of the novel insight that n-hexadecane
  might be converted to hexadecanoic acid extracellularly before it was taken up across
  the cell membrane were presented from chemotaxis to uptake of n-hexadecane.'
