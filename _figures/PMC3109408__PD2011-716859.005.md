caption: 'The possible role of Kynurenine pathway involvement in dopaminergic neurodegenerative
  process through microglia activation: Parkinson''s disease is associated with chronic
  activation of microglia, which also can be induced by LPS or Rotenone treatments.
  Classic microglia activation release neurotoxic substances including reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and proinflammatory cytokines as INF-γ, potent activator of Kynurenine
  pathway (KP). KP in activated microglia leads to upregulation of 3HK and QUIN. 3HK
  is toxic primarily as a result of conversion to ROS. The combined effects of ROS
  and NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity by QUIN contribute to the dysfunction
  of neurons and their death. However, picolinic acid (PIC) produced through KP activation
  in neurons, has the ability to protect neurons against QUIN-induced neurotoxicity,
  being NMDA agonist. Microglia can become overactivated, by proinflammatory mediators
  and stimuli from dying neurons and cause perpetuating cycle of further microglia
  activation microgliosis. Excessive microgliosis will cause neurotoxicity to neighbouring
  neurons and resulting in neuronal death, contributing to progression of Parkinson''s
  disease.'
