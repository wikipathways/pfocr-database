caption: Diagram of several molecular mechanisms in skin dermis exposed to external
  stimuli. External stimuli such as UV radiation or air pollutants can cause direct
  damage to the DNA and produce ROS. These can further stimulate many inflammatory
  responses and the MAPK family, which can lead to photoaging through inflammation
  and collagen degradation. The KEAP1-NRF2 stress response pathway is the principal
  inducible defense against oxidative stresses. Under homeostatic conditions, KEAP1
  regulates the activity of NRF2. In response to stress, an intricate molecular mechanism
  facilitated by sensor cysteines within KEAP1 allows NRF2 to escape ubiquitination,
  accumulate within the cell, and translocate to the nucleus, where it can promote
  its antioxidant transcription program. In the diagram, polyphenol chemicals in each
  box are organized into the classification system of polyphenol. UV, Ultraviolet;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species, HO-1; heme oxidase.
