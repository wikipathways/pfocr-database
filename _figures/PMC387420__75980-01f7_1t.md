caption: A model for the activation of Gα9 by cAMP. In unstimulated cells, CAR1 is
  coupled to Gα2βγ and Gα9βγ. Upon ligand binding of CAR1, both heterotrimeric complexes
  become activated, releasing Gβγ, Gα2-GTP, and Gα9-GTP. Gβγ is suggested to activate
  a family of Ras proteins, which initiate down-stream effector signaling of the PI3K,
  GC, and AC pathways (see Kimmel and Parent ,); targets downstream, in turn, are
  required to regulate actin and myosin II dynamics. Released Gβγ will also induce
  cAMP-regulated gene expression (e.g., CAR1) during early development by a separate
  pathway. Current data suggest that Gα2 primarily serves to mediate the release of
  Gβγ from stimulated CAR1. Gα2-GTP has not been directly linked to any downstream
  chemoattractant pathway. Because Gα9 functions to negatively regulate multiple pathways
  activated by Gβγ, we place Gα9 at a signaling junction that is common to the PI3K,
  GC, and AC pathways, and thus, immediately downstream of CAR1/Gαβγ activation. However,
  the immediate effectors of Gβγ or of Gα9-GTP have not yet been identified.
