caption: A hypothetical model summarizing the probable mechanisms of severe inflammation
  in malaria. Parasite molecules like Haemazoin, Pf AT-rich DNA recruited by TLR and
  TLR independent (STING) pathways (, ). High load of Pf AT rich DNA would lead to
  increased levels of TRAF3 and of IFN-α. And IFN-α, in turn, suppresses GATA3 expression
  in Th2 cells resulting in low levels of IL-10 and hence down regulated SOCS3 ().
  In addition, low levels of IL-2 and T-bet fail to mediate switch from IFN-γ+/IL-10−
  to IFN-γ+/IL-10+ Th1 cells that requires T-bet and IL-2 levels, also explain low
  levels of IL-10. Finally, downregulated SOCS3, which is known to mediate the anti-inflammatory
  functions of IL-10, fails to regulate an exaggerated proinflammatory response. Another
  contributory role to severe inflammation in malaria is the high prevalence of IL-8-251T/A,
  which increases IL-8 expression for enhanced recruitment and activation of inflammatory
  cells neutrophils resulting in increased activation of NF-κB via IL-1β-mediated
  pathway.
