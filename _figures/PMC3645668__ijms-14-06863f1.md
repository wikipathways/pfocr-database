caption: Schematic illustration of the canonical Notch signaling pathway. Notch is
  a heterodimeric cell-surface receptor family (Notch 1–4). Notch family members are
  composed of an extracellular ligand-binding domain that is non-covalently associated
  with a single-pass transmembrane domain. There are two distinct families of Notch
  ligands in mammals, known as the Jagged ligands (Jagged1 and Jagged2) and the Delta-like
  ligands (consisting of Dll1, Dll3 and Dll4). Dll and Jagged proteins trigger the
  canonical Notch signaling pathway, wherein binding of a ligand to a Notch receptor
  results in the cleavage of the receptor at a site in the transmembrane domain. Upon
  binding by either Dll or Jagged ligands, Notch undergoes proteolytic cleavages catalyzed
  by A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) proteases and the γ-secretase complex,
  leading to the translocation of the notch intracellular domain (NICD) into the nucleus.
  NICD interacts with the transcriptional repressor, recombination-signal-binding
  protein for immunoglobulin-kJ region (RBP-J) in the CSL complex (CBF1/RBP-j/Su(H)/Lag-1).
  The NICD interaction with RBP-J also recruits Mastermind (MAML) protein. The new
  transcriptional complex of NICD-RBP-J-MAML converts RBP-J from a repressor to a
  transcriptional activator. The Hes (hairy and enhancer of split) proteins subsequently
  regulate the expression of genes involved in Notch-dependent processes, including
  apoptosis, proliferation or differentiation for cell-fate determination.
