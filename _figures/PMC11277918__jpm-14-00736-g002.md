caption: cGAS-STING can transform a cold tumor into a hot tumor and promote tumor
  cell apoptosis. The immunosuppressive microenvironment comprises primarily immature
  dendritic cells, immunosuppressive Treg cells, and M2 tumor-associated macrophages,
  alongside chemical factors such as IL-10 and TGF-β released by tumor cells. These
  immunosuppressive elements collaborate to curtail the efficacy of targeted therapies
  like traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, thereby fostering tumor progression,
  dissemination, and evasion of immune surveillance. Through the release of IFNs and
  NF-κB, the cGAS-STING pathway facilitates the maturation of dendritic cells, the
  recruitment of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, the polarization of M2 tumor-associated macrophages
  toward the M1 phenotype, and the augmentation of inflammatory cytokine secretion.
  Consequently, the immunosuppressive microenvironment undergoes a transition into
  an immune-supportive milieu, thereby enhancing the therapeutic outcomes against
  tumors and prompting tumor cell apoptosis. cGAS cyclic GMP–AMP synthase; STING stimulator
