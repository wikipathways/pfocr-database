caption: 'Overview of TLR and NOD receptor-mediated immune response. Step 1: Pathogen
  Detection: TLRs identify extracellular/endosomal PAMPs and DAMPs, such as lipopolysaccharides
  and heat shock proteins. NOD-1 and NOD-2 detect intracellular peptidoglycan fragments.
  Step 2: Signal Transduction: TLRs activate signaling leading to kinase activation
  (IRAKs, TRAF-6). NOD receptors directly activate RIPK-2 kinase. Step 3: Activation
  of Signaling Complexes, ROS Production, and Response Amplification: 3.1. Activation
  of Signaling Complexes: both receptor types stimulate the TAK-1/TAB complex, which
  then activates the IKK complex essential for NF-κB pathway initiation. 3.2. Activation
  of NOX: Triggered by NOD-2 signaling or TLRs, NOX generates reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). This directly activates the IKK complex. 3.3. Role of TRAF-6 and NOD-2: TRAF-6
  and NOD-2 can enhance the production of mitochondrial ROS (mROS), which further
  activates the IKK complex. 3.4. Dissociation of Trx from TXNIP: the increase in
  ROS causes Trx to dissociate from TXNIP. 3.5. Activation of the IKK Complex: each
  of these steps synergistically contributes to the activation of the IKK complex,
  central to regulating inflammatory responses and immune function. Step 4: NF-κB-Mediated
  Transcription and MAPK Activation: 4.1. NF-κB-Mediated Transcription: IKK complex
  phosphorylates IκB, allowing NF-κB to enter the nucleus and upregulate inflammatory
  genes, including cytokines and chemokines. 4.2. MAPK Activation: ROS and mROS contribute
  to the activation of the MAPK pathway. Step 5: Inflammatory Response and Immune
  Activation: NF-κB facilitates the assembly of the NLRP-3 inflammasome, which promotes
  the production of cytokines and chemokines. Concurrently, the activation of the
  MAPK pathway leads to the release of cytokines and interferons (IFN), thereby driving
  the recruitment of immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. This cascade
  enhances inflammation and pathogen neutralization through phagocytosis and the subsequent
  production of ROS/RNS. (PAMPs: pathogen-associated molecular patterns; PRRs: pattern
