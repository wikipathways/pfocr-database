caption: 'A proposed link between mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance
  in an adipocyte model. The increased intracellular ROS triggered by obesity and
  metabolic challenges (e.g., excess nutrient intake) leads to mt-ROS overproduction,
  exacerbating the total ROS generation and decreasing MMP and ATP production [].
  The impaired mitochondria reflected by the collapse of mt-DNA content and depletion
  of mitochondrial biogenesis alter adiponectin level, resulting in decreased OXPHOS
  caused by reduced activation of AMPK and PGC-1α as its regulator []. In addition,
  the compromised mitochondria function causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites
  because of the reduced β-oxidation and the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines
  leading to the induction of PKC isoforms and Ser/Thr kinases [,]. Consequently,
  the inhibition of the insulin signalling cascade, including the disruption of GLUT-4
  transduction, leads to the defect of the insulin-dependent glucose uptake pathway.
  ROS: reactive oxygen species; mt-ROS: mitochondrial reactive oxygen species; MMP:
  mitochondrial membrane potential; ATP: adenosine 5′-triphosphate; mt-DNA: mitochondrial
  DNA; OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation; AMPK: adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase; PGC-1α: peroxisome proliferator-activated response-γ coactivator-1α;
  PKC: protein kinase C.'
