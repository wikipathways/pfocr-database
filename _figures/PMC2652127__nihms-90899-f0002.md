caption: TLRs/NODs and key intracellular signaling cascades. TLRs recognize distinct
  pathogen patterns and recruit a set of adaptor proteins to form the signalosome
  complex. Following receptor ligation and recruitment of receptor adaptor proteins,
  signaling to IKK proceeds through TRAF/RIP complexes, generally in conjunction with
  TAK1, leading to canonical NF-κB signaling, or through TRAFs and NIK leading to
  the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. NODs recognize intracellular pathogen molecules
  and recruit RIP2 to activate NF-κB. Activation of IKK results in IκB phosphorylation
  and degradation in the canonical pathway or p100 processing to p52 in the noncanonical
  pathway and consequently, nuclear translocation of phophorylated NF-κB dimers. Those
  NF-κB dimmers bind to κB DNA elements and regulate gene expression. TAK1 can also
  trigger activation of MAPKs leading to the activator protein-1-associated gene regulation.
