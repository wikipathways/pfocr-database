caption: Roles of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible beta (Gadd45b) in Parkinson’s
  disease. (A) Gadd45b could prevent LID caused by excessive L-DOPA. (B) Oxidized
  DA and Excess Zn2+ could increase Gadd45b, which induced cell death by inhibiting
  the JNK/P38 signaling pathway and promoting the cell death process. (C) Gadd45b
  may be related to chromatin destructuration, DNA methylation, susceptibility to
  oxidative stress and DNA damage. (D) Increased Gadd45b expression in the brain of
  patients with PD (Figure was created with BioRender.com).
