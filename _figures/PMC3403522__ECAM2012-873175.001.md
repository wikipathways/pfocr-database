caption: Glycolytic pathway and the role of HIF-1α in regulating glycolysis. Glucose
  was uptaken by increased expression of GLUT in hypoxia cancer cells. Through a series
  of enzyme reaction, glucose was finally metabolized into lactate and ATP, NAD+ was
  also regenerated by LDH-A for maintaining continuous glycolysis. Lactate was exhausted
  out of cancer cells by MCT4 and then uptaken by oxygenated cancer cells through
  MCT1. In the presence of oxygen, lactate is oxidized into pyruvate by LDH-B and
  pyruvate enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce ATP. HIF-1α was the
  main regulator of some enzymes expression in the glycolytic pathway, including GLUT-1,
  hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, LDH-A,
  and MCT.
