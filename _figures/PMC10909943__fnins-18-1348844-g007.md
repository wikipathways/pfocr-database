caption: The effect of TUDCA in improving metabolic disorder. Metabolic disorders,
  such as diabetes and obesity, are closely associated with AD. Intracerebroventricular
  (ICV) injection of Streptozotocin (STZ), a chemical used to induce both type 1 and
  type 2 diabetes mellitus in rodents, can be used to create a mouse model of AD,
  which exhibits reduced brain weight, increased levels of amyloid oligomers, impaired
  glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. TUDCA treatment could increase islet mass,
  β-cell area and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, as well as potentiate the
  neuroprotective effect of insulin. Furthermore, TUDCA treatment could restore the
  damaged hypothalamic leptin signaling pathway, alleviate peripheral ER stress and
  improve overall metabolism. The association between AD and metabolism is represented
  by the black dashed triangle, while the influence of TUDCA is highlighted by brown
  arrows. In addition, TUDCA has the potential to alleviate pathological changes induced
  by islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), while effectively stimulating the release of
  glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) by activating the bile acid receptor TGR5 located
  on L-cells. The brown inhibitory arrow represents the potential of TUDCA to alleviate
  IAPP-induced pathological changes. Additionally, the TGR5 arrow, also depicted in
  brown, signifies the activation effect of TUDCA. GLP-1 can not only treat diabetes
  and obesity through a variety of mechanisms, such as stimulating insulin secretion,
  inhibiting glucagon secretion, protecting β cells and decreasing food intake, but
  also affect neurological and cognitive functions. The aforementioned functions of
  GLP-1 are illustrated by purple dashed arrows
