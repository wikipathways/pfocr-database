caption: Potential mechanisms of PD-1-directed immunotherapy. Blockade of PD-1 pathway
  helps to restore T and B cell functions during chronic SIV infection. Type I IFN
  responses are inhibited in the blood and colorectal tissue compartments of SIV-infected
  Rhesus macaques following in vivo PD-1 blockade. Reduced type I IFN signaling was
  associated with enhanced expression of intestinal epithelial tight junction-associated
  genes and with a profound decrease in plasma LPS levels and associated immune activation,
  suggesting a possible gut repair and decreased pathogenic microbial translocation
  from gut into the blood. PD-1 blockade enhanced immunity against gut-resident pathogenic
  bacteria, control of gut-associated pathogenic opportunistic infections, which enhances
  survival of SIV-infected non-human primates.
