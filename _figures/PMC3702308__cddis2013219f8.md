caption: Proposed model of HY-PDT-induced cell death. We propose a mechanism of tumor
  cell killing by HY-PDT. The HY, lipophilic molecule, accumulates specifically in
  the tumor cell membrane and enters into the cells via endocytosis, pinocytosis or
  passive diffusion. The HY binds to mitochondria and become activated following irradiation
  with visible light. These activated HY react with O2 to produce cytotoxic reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), responsible for direct tumor cell killing. The HY-PDT results
  in rapid initiation of an inflammatory response eventually recruiting mediators
  of inflammation and stimulating tumor cells to release secondary inflammatory mediators
  for instance, IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ in treated cells. The treatment could also promote
  the accumulation of DC, macrophages and neutrophils leading to tumor destruction.
  Overall, HY-PDT is considered vital for the activation of antitumor immunity. On
  the other hand, induction of ROS also inclines tumor cell death via the mitochondrial
  apoptotic pathway. First, release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum,  and mitochondria,
  which has a major role in apoptosis followed by loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity
  and release of cytochrome c. The Bid cleavage coincided with translocation of tBid
  from cytoplasm to mitochondria and remarkably activates initiator caspases (caspase-8
  or caspase-9) leads to the activation of effector caspases (caspase-3, -6 and -7).
  The prolonged oxidative stress resulting digestion of nucleosomal DNA into oligonucleosomes
  and visualize as DNA laddering at the late stage of apoptosis. Under certain circumstances,
  PDT-treated tumor cells could also undergo necrosis
