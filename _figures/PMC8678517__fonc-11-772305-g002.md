caption: Endothelial BMP9 and TGFβ signaling via the Alk1 signaling axis. (A) Conventional
  endothelial BMP9 and BMP10 signaling via a receptor complex of Alk1 and BMPR-II
  leads to transient activation of downstream SMAD signaling, endothelial quiescence
  and vascular stability. Previous therapeutic studies have pursued vascular normalization
  by supplementing this pathway with recombinant BMP9. (B) Alk1 can also partner with
  ALK5 and TGFβR2 to form a receptor complex for TGFβ to promote angiogenesis. (C)
  BMPR-II loss causes signaling via alternative type-II receptors, such as ActR-IIa/b,
  which can promote angiogenesis via the chronic activation of canonical SMAD signaling.
  Therapeutic targeting of pre-angiogenic signaling of TGFβ or BMP9 via Alk1 has been
  pursued by receptor blockade with PF-03446962 or the Alk1-Fc ligand trap, Dalantercept.
