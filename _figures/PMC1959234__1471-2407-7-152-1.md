caption: Schematic model for the "error-free" BRCA double strand break repair pathway
  Brief overview of components within the BRCA pathway used here as a working model
  that was tested here. The model is based largely on reference 16. BRCA2 is the same
  as FANCD1 and the interaction between BRCA1 and Fanconi anemia protein J is shown.
  While the gene products shown represent the over-all pathway, "error-free" double
  strand break repair by homologous recombination undoubtedly involves other proteins
  but the discussion is limited to those shown. Not shown are details of the 13 Fanconi
  anemia gene products and additional components including EMSY, a whole family of
  RAD51 related proteins, DCC, cohesins and accessory proteins. Deficiency states
  may be rare or unknown for these additional proteins and large epidemiologic studies
  are uncommon. Other protein kinases related to ATM carry out similar functions in
  response to other genotoxic stresses, and some of them collaborate with ATM. Proteins
  within the pathway also interact with other branches of the DNA damage response
  and with further proteins.
