caption: 'Therapeutic strategies for targeting p53. (A) Viral expression vectors (adenovirus
  and/or lentivirus) that encode the WT p53 protein, hijack host (cancer) cell machinery
  and force them to produce functional p53 protein. This leads to activation of canonical
  p53 signaling, resulting in growth arrest and apoptosis induction. (B) MDM2 and
  MDMX inhibitors function to block the negative regulation of p53 by these proteins,
  resulting in p53 release and activation of tumor suppressive pathways such as growth
  arrest and apoptosis. In addition to small molecule inhibitors of the p53 binding
  site on MDM2 and MDMX, antisense oligonucleotides can be directed against Mdmx mRNA
  by targeting the boundary of exon 6 resulting in downregulation of MDMX. (C) Mutations
  of p53 protein may cause conformational changes in the DNA binding domain. Compounds
  that stabilize the mutant protein so that the WT conformation of the DNA binding
  domain can be restored are able to facilitate the expression of WT p53 target genes
  resulting in growth arrest and apoptosis. These include PRIMA-1/APR-246, which following
  conversion into methylene quinuclidinone (MQ) can covalently attach to cysteine
  residues, which stabilizes the binding of mup53 to the WT proteins DNA response
  elements. Additionally, mutations can create novel binding domains on the mup53
  protein. The Y220C mutation generates a binding pocket on mup53 that when bound
  by the small molecule PK7088 stabilizes the mutant protein in its WT conformation
  enabling binding to DNA response elements. These compounds enable restoration of
  WT p53 transcriptional functions resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. (D)
  Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) functions to stabilize mup53, preventing its degradation.
  Addition of the Hsp90 inhibitor, ganetespib, blocks this interaction and facilitates
  degradation of mup53. This can also be achieved by inhibiting histone deacetylase
  activity with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), which causes Hsp90 to remain
  acetylated, which blocks its chaperone activity. Legend: Arrows represent activation
  pathways, hammers represent inhibition, and faded hammers represent inhibitory pathways
  that are being repressed by the signal pathway.'
