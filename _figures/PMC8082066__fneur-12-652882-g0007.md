caption: The role of SIRT1-TET2-CDKN2A/p16INK4a pathway in dopaminergic neurons. MPP+
  treatment decreased SIRT1 expression and then promotes TET2 hyperacetylation, resulting
  in the increased stability of TET2 protein. Excess TET2 protein induce DNA demethylation
  and TET2 targeted gene expression, including CDKN2A. The elevated protein level
  of p16INK4a (One of the two proteins CDKN2A encodes) inhibit CDK4 and then reduce
  the pRb protein level, which allows cell cycle arrest and induces cell apoptosis
  of PD SH-SY5Y cells. Conversely, activation of endogenous SIRT1 by resveratrol (RV)
  leads to CDKN2A DNA hypermethylation due to the decreased TET2 protein levels, which
  relieves the inhibitory effect on CDK4 and upregulation of pRb, allowing cell proliferation
  and growth. Similar effects are observed for inhibition of endogenous TET2 enzyme
  activity with TET2 inhibitor.
