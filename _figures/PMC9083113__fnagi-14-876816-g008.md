caption: Schematic diagram of muscle atrophy pathway in muscle from 3xTgAD mice. Increased
  expression of APP in the spinal cord and sciatic nerve results in fragmented and
  denervated NMJ. The higher amount of Aβ found in skeletal muscle causes inflammation
  with upregulating TGFβ, excessive amount of TGFβ then activates Smad2/3 through
  phosphorylation. Activated Smad2/3 then upregulates its downstream effector protein
  MuRF1, which is a muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase and sequentially inhibits the
  protein turnover in skeletal muscles and hence causes the decrease of muscle mass.
