caption: Schematic diagram of the complement cascade. The classical pathway begins
  with the binding of the C1 complex to antigen-antibody complexes containing IgG
  or IgM. The lectin pathway is triggered by the binding of mannose-binding lectin
  (MBL), which is bound to proteolytic MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs), to
  carbohydrate moieties. Both of these pathways result in cleavage of C2 and C4 to
  form C3 convertase. The alternative pathway starts with the autoactivation of C3,
  typically via direct binding of C3 to pathogens. This creates a unique version of
  C3 convertase that involves the cleavage of Factor B All complement pathways converge
  with the cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b associates with C3 convertase, which
  cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. The anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a have potent proinflammatory
  effects. C5b deposits on cell surfaces, where it forms the membrane attack complex
  (MAC), which induces cell lysis. Various inhibitory proteins disrupt the complement
  cascade, as labelled within the figure above.
