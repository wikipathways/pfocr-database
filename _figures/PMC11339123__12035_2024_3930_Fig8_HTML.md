caption: Schematic representation of the research strategy. Global cerebral ischemia
  (GCI) in rats can cause an increase in the CaV1.2-CaMKIIα signaling pathway in the
  hippocampus CAl region, resulting in the inhibition of BDE2 biosynthesis and downregulation
  of pro-survival pathways AKT, ERK1/2, and CREB, while also promoting A1-astrocyte
  activity. However, the performance of RIP after GCI significantly reverses these
  damages, increased protein levels of BDNF, synaptic protein PSD95, spinophlin, A2-astrocyte,
  and ultimately mitigated cognitive dysfunction. The research also utilized an aromatase
  specific inhibitor letrozole and an inhibitor peptide TatCN21 of CaMlKllα activity
  to confirm that RIP can induce aromatase-BDE2 through CaV1.2-CaMlKllα signaling
  and has beneficial effects on astrocytes
