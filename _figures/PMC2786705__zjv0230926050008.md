caption: 'Model for continued defect in IRF-3-deficient BMDCs. Postattachment, HSV-1
  infection is recognized through an unknown sensor mechanism that leads to activation
  of IRF-3. The early recognition pathway mediates the production of type I IFN- and
  IRF-3-dependent ISGs, leading to the control of HSV-1 replication via the type I
  IFN cascade. However, pretreatment with IFN does not restore HSV-1 replication in
  IRF-3−/− BMDCs to WT levels. The continued defect is potentially due to three, nonexclusive
  mechanisms outlined in white squares: defective IFN amplification, defective antiviral
  trigger signaling, and IRF-3-dependent gene synergy with the antiviral response.
  One or more of these mechanisms leads to continued defect in the control of HSV-1
  replication in IRF-3−/− BMDCs compared to WT BMDCs after IFN treatment.'
