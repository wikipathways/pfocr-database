caption: Activated macrophages secrete TNFα (and possibly additional cytokines) which
  synergize with IFNγ in fibroblasts to block virus growth by a mechanism that is
  dependent on caspase signaling. M36 blocks the caspase-dependent signaling pathway
  and thus prevents apoptosis and rescues the virus growth.
