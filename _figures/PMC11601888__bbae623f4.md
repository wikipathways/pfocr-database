caption: Function analysis of the high-confidence functional lncRNAs. (A) The distribution
  for the enrichment of important pathways. (B) Detailed information on the enrichment
  of each high-confidence functional lncRNAs for the four hESC-related pathways, where
  the colors represent the significance of the enrichment and the sizes represent
  their number of overlapping genes. (C) Flowchart of processing and the results of
  analysis of HCFun_lncs based on correlations of expressions with important genes
  of the hsa04550 pathway (signaling pathway regulating the pluripotency of stem cells),
  as well as the result of a random control group. Their enrichment scores and normalized
  enrichment scores have been marked. The right side showed the results of the random
  control group
