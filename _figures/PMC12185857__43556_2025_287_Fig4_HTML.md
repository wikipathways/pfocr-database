caption: The dual role of fructose in cancer. The relationship between fructose and
  cancer is complex. Fructose promotes the growth of small intestinal villi, enhancing
  their absorption capacity. Fructose is rapidly converted to fructose 1-phosphate
  by ketohexokinase (KHK), and upregulates the expression of glucose transporter 5
  (GLUT5). In addition, the metabolism of fructose through the liver leads to a large
  increase in circulating nutrients such as lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). These
  processes indirectly provide appropriate substrates for central carbon metabolism
  during tumor proliferation, and fructose also inhibits the polarization of tumor-associated
  macrophages, further promoting tumor growth. Because of the special metabolic process
  of fructose, fructose enhances tumor metabolism through glycolysis, the serine synthesis
  pathway, polyol pathway and so on. fructose also enhances the function of mitochondria
  through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) after absorbed by tumor cells, and
  enhances fatty acid synthesis by up-regulating the expression of glucose transporter
  5 (GLUT5). These processes will directly promote tumor growth. On the contrary,
  fructose can induce adipocytes to secrete leptin, which can act on CD8+ T cells
  and enhance the anti-tumor activity of CD8+ T cells
