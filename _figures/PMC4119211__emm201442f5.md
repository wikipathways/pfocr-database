caption: Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)/redox effector factor-1 (Ref-1)
  has a pivotal role in various human diseases. Owing to its vital role in the BER
  pathway, in balancing intra-cellular redox states and in the reductive activation
  of various transcription factors (TFs) controlling cell survival pathways, alterations
  in APE1/Ref-1 expression and functions have a crucial role in various human diseases
  including cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs).
  The overexpression and enhanced enzymatic activities of APE1/Ref-1 have been linked
  with the conferral of survival advantage and chemoresistance in cancer cells. APE1/Ref-1
  also has an important role in CVD by governing H-Ras-mediated endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase (eNOS) activity and NO bioavailability. In NDs, such as Alzheimer's
  disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS), decreased
  neuronal expression of APE1/Ref-1 after neuronal insult decreases cell viability
  and promotes neurodegeneration. In addition to alterations in the expression of
  APE1/Ref-1 and its subcellular localization and enzymatic functions, single-nucleotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs) in the APE1/Ref-1 gene have been also reported to have a role
  in ALS, AD and cancer. In addition, various post-translational modifications (PTMs),
  such as acetylation, ubiquitination,,  s-nitrosylation, sumoylation and phosphorylation,
  have been demonstrated to regulate APE1/Ref-1 functions in various human diseases.
