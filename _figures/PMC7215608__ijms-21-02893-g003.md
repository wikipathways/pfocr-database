caption: H. pylori may act as an oncogenic factor through several pathways and via
  many secreted proteins. In the above reported example, it is able to induce a chronic
  inflammatory status through the internalization of the CagA protein by gastric epithelial
  cells, which in turn triggers the upregulation of IL-8 via Ras/Raf/ERK or p38 pathway;
  such protein might also stimulate the Ras GTPase SOS, to induce cell proliferation.
  The secreted protein JHP0290 is able to induce TNFα transcription, mediated by ERK
  activation, leading to immunosurveillance escape.
