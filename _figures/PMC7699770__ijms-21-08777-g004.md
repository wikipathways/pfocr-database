caption: 'Metabolic adaptations of sulfate-reducing bacteria to utilize acetate: (a)
  modified citric acid cycle as used by Desulfobacter postgatei; (b) reverse Wool–Ljungdahl
  pathway as employed by organisms like Desulfobacter autotrophicum; arrows indicate
  the preferred direction of reactions. Enzymes are represented by numbers in green
  circles (cf. ). “H2” indicates the generation of two protons and two electrons,
  which may result in the formation of reduced ferredoxin, NADH, or NADPH.'
