caption: Tyrosine kinase pathways leading to CARD9 and TLR signaling responses. The
  central role of the CARD9/Malt1/Bcl10 complex in activating primarily the NF-κB
  pathway and to a lesser extent the MAPK pathway is shown (see ). Engagement of C-type
  lectin receptors, leading to Syk activation, is coupled to the CARD9 complex through
  an unclear pathway, but may involve PKCs. This in turn directly leads to activation
  of IKK, which in turn activates downstream NF-κB pathways (see ). The importance
  of this pathway in innate immune cell recognition has been revealed by the similar
  defect in host defense in mice lacking either the C-type lectin receptors, Syk,
  or CARD9 (). The CARD9 complex may also facilitate the ability of the TLRs to engage
  downstream MAPK pathway activation. Upstream of the TLRs, the major cytoplasmic
  tyrosine kinase involved in this innate immune receptor function is Tec-family members,
  as revealed by poor TLR signaling function in cells derived from either mice or
  humans lacking various Tec kinases. It remains unclear how the Tec kinases operate
  in the TLR pathway, but could involve phosphorylation of signaling adapters MyD88
  or Mal.
