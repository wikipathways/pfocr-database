caption: The biosynthetic pathway of communesins mapped using knockout studies presenting
  in this work. The pathway in the dashed box represents the main pathway leading
  to 1 and 2 in P. expansum. The compounds outside of the box were isolated as shunt
  products using blocked mutants. Three new communesins, 12, 13 and 14 were produced.
