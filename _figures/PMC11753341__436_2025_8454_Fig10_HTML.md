caption: 'A schematic diagram illustrating the proposed signaling pathway involved
  in Angiostrongylus cantonensis-induced COX-2, mPGES-1 and PGE2: COX-2 is an inducible
  enzyme that converts arachidonic acid into PGH2, which is further transformed into
  prostaglandins, including PGE-2. Inflammatory PGE2 is produced from PGH2 by an enzyme
  called microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1). In a murine model of angiostrongyliasis
  meningoencephalitis, inhibition of NLRP3 led to decreased expression of COX-2 and
  mPGES-1. Additionally, treatment with MCC950, NS398 or MF63 suppressed eosinophil
  count by reducing MMP-9 activities by inhibiting the COX-2/mPGES-1/PGE2 pathway.
  These findings reveal the involvement of COX-2/mPGES-1/PGE2-mediated signaling pathways
  in the regulation of MMP-9 activity and subsequent eosinophilic meningoencephalitis'
