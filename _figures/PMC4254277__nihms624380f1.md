caption: 'Left: Yeast nutrient signaling pathway is directly affected by the availability
  of certain amino acids. In addition, production of acetyl-CoA can be modulated by
  branched chain amino acid Leu, together these pathways make up the pro-aging and
  growth pathways affecting longevity. Right: An oversimplified representation of
  the same evolutionary conserved pathway in flies that are affected by restriction
  of proteins and essential amino acids, in particular, Met. These restrictions result
  in reduced signaling activity of the TOR network and decreased activation of the
  IIS pathway.'
