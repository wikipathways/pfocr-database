caption: Metabolism of a resting uninfected cell. In a resting cell, glucose is actively
  imported and used to fuel oxidative phosphorylation. The glycolytic pathway in the
  cytosol converts glucose to pyruvate. Pyruvate is imported into the mitochondria
  where it is used to generate NADH and FADH through the TCA cycle. NADH and FADH
  can be oxidised by the electron transport chain to generate ATP. Citrate generated
  in the mitochondria can be shuttled out to generate cholesterol and fatty acids
  when this is required. Repression arrows indicate specific drug inhibitors. Glucose-6-P
  can also be shuttled to the pentose phosphate pathway where it can be used for generation
  of NADPH, nucleotides and purines. GLUT glucose transporter, TCA cycle tricarboxylic
  acid cycle
