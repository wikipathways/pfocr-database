caption: Growth factors and nutrients by activation of mTOR inhibits autophagy and
  promotes protein synthesis. This may promote cellular stress (protein aggregation,
  organelle dysfunction, and oxidative stress), which might lead to damage accumulation,
  reduction in cell function and induces stem cell exhaustion, which reduces tissue
  repair and promotes tissue dysfunction. Thus, mTor activation pathway promotes the
  development of aging diseases.  (blue and red) indicates activation,  indicates
  inhibition.
