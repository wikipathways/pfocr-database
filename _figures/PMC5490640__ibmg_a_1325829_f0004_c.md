caption: Ubiquitin enzymes in the regulation of T cell-mediated autoimmunity. (a)
  The transcription factor AIRE, crucial for central tolerance, controls expression
  of peripheral tissue antigens, which are required for the negative selection process.
  An involvement of the E3 ligase activity of AIRE has not been clarified. The E3
  ligase TRAF6 indirectly controls AIRE expression via the canonical NF-κB pathway.
  (b) Peripheral tolerance ensures that self-reactive T cells enter an inactive state
  (anergy). The E3 ligases ITCH and CBL-B ubiquitinate PLCγ1 and the regulatory subunit
  of PI3K, p85. Lys 48-linked ubiquitination of PLCγ1 induces proteasomal degradation,
  whereas ubiquitination of PI3K blocks recruitment to CD28, both of which causes
  termination of TCR signaling. The E3 ligase GRAIL induces ubiquitination of the
  co-stimulatory molecule CD40 ligand, which induces its proteasomal degradation.
  The E3 ligases ROQUIN-1 and ROQUIN-2 control levels of ICOS by inducing ICOS mRNA
  decay. (c) Treg generation is controlled by the transcription factor FOXP3. The
  ubiquitin E3 ligase STUB1 directly ubiquitinates FOXP3 with Lys 48-linked ubiquitin
  chains, leading to proteasomal degradation, which can be counteracted by the DUB
  USP7. CBL-B and ITCH indirectly promote Treg generation by positively regulating
  FOXP3 expression. Contrarily, the SKP2-SCF complex as well as the DUB CYLD induce
  loss of FOXP3 expression via indirect effects. E3 ligases are indicated in red,
  DUBs in purple, and transcription factors in green (see color version of this figure
  at www.tandfonline.com/ibmg).
