caption: Natural products downregulating TGF‐β pathway in treatment of leukemia. The
  schematic illustrates the modulation of TGF‐β signaling by various natural compounds
  in different forms of leukemia, specifically histiocytic lymphoma (U937), acute
  myelogenous leukemia (KG‐1), acute promyelocytic leukemia (HL‐60 and NB4‐R2), and
  chronic myeloid leukemia (K562). Natural compounds such as homoharringtonine (HHT),
  ginsenoside Rh2 (Rh2), halofuginone (HF), and epigallocatechin‐3‐gallate (EGCG)
  upregulate TGF‐β signaling pathways, leading to varied effects on cell proliferation,
  apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. The canonical pathway involves Smad2/3 phosphorylation,
  which complexes with Smad4 and translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression.
  The noncanonical pathway involves FOXO3a activation. Key mechanisms include the
  inhibition of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) like p15, p21, and p27, and the activation
  of cell proliferative genes such as c‐myc, CDK4/9, cyclin D1, and CDC25A. The diagram
  also highlights the resulting cellular outcomes such as increased apoptosis, cell
  cycle arrest, and reduced cell proliferation. CDC25A, cell division cycle 25A; CDK,
