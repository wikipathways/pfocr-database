caption: Schematic of important cell envelope biosynthetic pathways in Staphylococcus
  aureus. The S. aureus cell wall is composed of thick layers of peptidoglycan containing
  covalently bound wall teichoic acids (WTA). S. aureus also contains membrane-bound
  lipoteichoic acids (LTA). LTA and WTA are modified with D-alanine esters installed
  by DltABCD. In the schematic, selected WTA enzymes are shown in yellow, Dlt pathway
  enzymes are shown in orange, and LTA pathway enzymes are shown in pink. The targets
  of selected inhibitors mentioned in the text are indicated. Figure adapted from
  Rajagopal and Walker (2016)
