caption: The Kss1 MAPK that regulates Kss1 pathway is responsible for filamentous
  growth contains T-E-Y motif in the activation loop domain. The Fus3 MAPK which responsible
  for mating and cell cycle arrest contains T-E-Y motif in its activation loop domain
  while Mpk1 which is responsible for cell wall remodeling, contains T-E-Y motif in
  the activation loop domain. The Hog1 which is responsible for hyperosmosis mediated
  glycerol synthesis contains T-G-Y motif. The Smk1 which regulates meiosis and sporulation
  pathway contains T-N-Y motif in the activation loop domain. This suggests that,
  different signaling pathways mediated by different fungal MAPKs are may be due to
  presence of different activation loop motifs. The activation loop motif play crucial
  role in mediating different signaling pathways in fungi.
