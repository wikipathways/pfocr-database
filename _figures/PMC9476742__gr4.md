caption: Regulation of apoptosis under activation of TNF-α. The signaling pathway
  triggered by TNF-α can be either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic. The caspase family
  plays a vital role during the process of apoptosis. Activation of caspase proteins
  and subsequent proteins could induce a cascade amplification of apoptosis. The apoptotic
  pathway can be triggered by the activation of Caspase-8, which then activates Caspases
  3, 6, and 7, leading to apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic pathway is triggered through
  recognition of TNF-α and its receptor. Activation of TRAF2, TRADD or CYLD can cause
  subsequent activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), which is responsible for
  the activation of the transcription of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as BCL-2, Fas,
  and Bim under the extracellular stimuli of cytokines.
