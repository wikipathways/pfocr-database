caption: FAE therapy modifies the metabolic-epigenetic interplay in multiple sclerosis
  to reduce pathogenic CCR6+ CD4 and CD8 T cells. (A) CD4 T cells from treatment na誰ve
  patients with multiple sclerosis exhibit low DNA methylation levels at the MIR-21
  locus and high expression of CCR6. CD8 T cells from treatment na誰ve multiple sclerosis
  patients also exhibit high levels of CCR6. (B) FAE therapy epigenetically modulates
  the MIR-21 locus in CD4 and CD8 T cells, which results in hypermethylation and downregulation
  of miR-21 expression in FAE-treated Th17 and Tc17 cells. This in turn allows for
  the upregulation of SMAD7 in both CD4 and CD8 T cells, a miR-21-5p and miR-21-3p
  target with inhibitory feedback on the TGF-b signalling pathway. Finally, FAEs reduce
  CCR6 expression and lower this potentially pathogenic brain-homing CCR6+ CD4 and
  CD8 T cell population in FAE-treated multiple sclerosis patients.
