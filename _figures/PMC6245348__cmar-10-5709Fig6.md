caption: 'Schematic diagram of molecular network and proposed mechanism of activity.Notes:
  (A) The predicted mechanism for the reversal of cell survival, angiogenesis, and
  inhibition of apoptosis. (B) Proposed molecular network of interaction as response
  to treatment. Data supported the activity of 4A3- and 4A4-induced apoptosis, resulting
  from the inhibition of AKT and antiapoptotic proteins (Mcl-1 and Bcl-2) as well
  as the VEGFA known for angiogenesis. This implies a possible role by PTEN tumor
  suppressor against PI3K-AKT pathway. In cervical cancer, PTEN is negatively regulated
  by miR-21 the expression of which is dependent on HPV E6 oncoprotein for the activation
  of cell survival, tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, and diminished apoptosis. The data
  in green and gray shadings indicate the level of expression of genes due to treatment.
  Data determined by RT-qPCR.Abbreviations: HPV, human papillomavirus; PI-3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH
  kinase; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; RT-qPCR, reverse transcriptase quantitative
  PCR.'
