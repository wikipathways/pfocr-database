caption: Graphical presentation of the transformation vectors (pPR1 and pPR2TN) and
  carotenogenic expression vectors (pPR13F, pPR22F, pPR19F, and pPR40F). Depending
  on the orientation of the carotenogenic expression cassette, the vectors were denominated
  F (forward) or R (reverse) when the carotenogenic gene was transcribed in the same
  or opposite direction, respectively, as the G418 marker gene. The Sau3A* (not unique)
  this site was created by the ligation of BamHI and BglII sites. SI, site of insertion
  (the insert was a blunted EcoRI fragment in a blunted BstXI site; details are given
  in Table ).
