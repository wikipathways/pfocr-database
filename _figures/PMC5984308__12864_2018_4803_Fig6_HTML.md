caption: 'Pathway functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (a)
  and pathway of Proximal tubule bicarbonate reclamation (ko04964)(b). A, X axis represents
  enrichment factor. Y axis represents pathway name. The color indicates the q value
  (high: white, low: blue), the lower q value indicates the more significant enrichment.
  Point size indicates DEG number (The larger dots refer to larger amount). Rich Factor
  refers to the value of enrichment factor, which is the quotient of foreground value
  (the number of DEGs) and background value (total Gene amount). The larger the value,
  the more significant the enrichment. b, Pathways were mapped using the KEGG Mapper
  (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/mapper.html). Up-regulated DEGs are boxed in red, DEG
  ID numbers are shown outside the box in blue'
