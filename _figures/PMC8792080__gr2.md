caption: 'Schematic representation of energy metabolism in S. cerevisiae and strategies
  to improve ethanol yield on sugar. A: Alcoholic fermentation of glucose or fructose.
  B: Maintenance energy requirements can be increased by presence of weak organic
  acids in culture medium. C: The net ATP yield (mol ATP/mol glucose equivalent) of
  maltose utilization is lower than that of glucose, since maltose transport is proton
  coupled, whereas glucose is transported via facilitated diffusion. D: Plasma membrane
  ATPase exports protons at the cost of ATP. E: Example of a futile cycle, e.g. a
  set of reactions that leads to net hydrolysis of ATP, that can be introduced in
  order to enforce ‘ATP wasting’. F: The Enter-Doudoroff glycolytic pathway yields
  only 1 ATP per glucose equivalent, instead of 2 ATP. G: Intracellular targeting
  of invertase (iSuc2) combined with uptake of sucrose by proton symport (left) lowers
  the ATP yield compared to wildtype S. cerevisiae, where sucrose is hydrolyzed extracellularly,
  after which the resulting monosaccharides are taken up via facilitated diffusion
  (right).'
