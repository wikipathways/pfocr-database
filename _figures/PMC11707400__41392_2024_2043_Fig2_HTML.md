caption: Mucosal immune system in the upper respiratory tract. The mucosal immune
  system in the airway mainly includes a ciliated epithelial cell layer in which club
  and goblet cells are the main mucosal secretory cells that secrete mucin and mucosal
  lipids. Basal cells are epithelial stem cells that renew and supplement epithelial
  cells. During SARS-CoV-2 invasion, T cells are activated and natural killer cells,
  macrophages, and neutrophils pass through the endothelial cells of the capillaries
  to the lamina propria to perform their immune functions. DCs secrete IL-12 to activate
  Th1 cells, IL-2 and IL-4 to activate Th2 cells respectively. Th1 and Th2 exhibit
  an antagonistic relationship. IFN-γ secreted by NK cells and Th1 cells can promote
  cellular antiviral response. Activated Th2 cells play a more important role in the
  germinal center. IL-6 mainly produced by macrophages and Th2 cells is a significant
  biomarker for severe COVID-19. The cilia can cross the mucosal layer to contact
  SARS-CoV-2, and the cilia surface can express angiotensin converting enzyme-2 and
  transmembrane protease serine 2; thus, they can transport SARS-CoV-2 directly. Ciliary
  dyneins can transfer SARS-CoV-2 to the cell surface and infect the cells through
  receptors on the cell surface. After infection, the PAK 1/4 pathway activates the
  reprogramming of cytoskeletal proteins in the microvilli, making the microvilli
  longer and larger. Reprogrammed microvilli can extend more viral particles to the
  mucus layer, which is prone to viral transmission
