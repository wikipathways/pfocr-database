caption: 'Changes in expression of pattern-recognition receptors and signaling genes
  in a pathway identified by IPA. Green symbols indicate decreased gene expression
  caused by SMD, no color represents no significant effect, and pink to red indicates
  increased expression caused by SMD. However, in some cases, symbols with no color
  did exhibit potentially biologically relevant changes (noted below), but they are
  not shown as green or red because one of the values in the set is below the limits
  of detection or the difference is not statistically significant. The following fold
  changes were observed comparing the LPS and the LPS + SMD at 300mg/kg groups: TLR3,
  −7.9-fold; IRF-7, −13-fold; IRF-3, −2.3-fold; NF-κB (p50), −4.2-fold; RIG-I (DDX58),
  −5.0-fold; MyD88, −2.2-fold; NOD1 (CARD4), −3.5-fold; PKR (EIF2AK2), −11.6-fold;
  RIP-2 (RIPK-2), −2.8-fold; OAS-1a, −5.9-fold; IL-6, +6.9-fold; IFN-α/β, −1.2-fold;
  IL-10, +2.2-fold; IL-12 (p40), −2.2-fold; Dectin-1, +6.4-fold. Abbreviations: IFN,
  interferon; IL, interleukin; IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; IRF, interferon regulatory
  factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; SMD, sodium methyldithiocarbamate; TLR, Toll-like
  receptor.'
