caption: Graphic representation of the hepatic Hepc pathway in conditions of systemic
  iron increase. The iron signaling proteins (Fe2Tf and Bmps) interact with iron sensors
  (Tfr1, Hfe, Tfr2, BmpRs) and their co-activator (mHjv) to promote Hepc production.
  Hepc, secreted by hepatocytes, is transported in plasma and binds iron exporter
  Fpn1 on duodenal and reticuloendothelial cell surfaces causing its internalization
  and intracellular degradation. As a consequence, iron remains entrapped in these
  cells, systemically reducing the metal availability.
