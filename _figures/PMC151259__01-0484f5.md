caption: Model for the Receptor Complex and Its Interaction with the Polypeptide CLV3.A
  model for the receptor complex and its interaction with the polypeptide CLV3, which
  regulates the balance of cell proliferation and organ formation in the shoot and
  flower meristems of Arabidopsis. Upon binding of CLV3 to the CLV1-CLV2 receptor
  complex, the protein kinase domain becomes activated, leading to the autophosphorylation
  of CLV1 and subsequent signaling pathway events. (Adapted from .) s-s, disulfide
  bonds; P, phosphorylation.
