caption: C21 precursors (pregnenolone and progesterone) are converted to C19 adrenal
  androgens, such as dihydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione (A-dione) by
  the sequential hydroxylase and lyase activities of CYP17A1. Circulating adrenal
  androgens enter the prostate and can be converted to testosterone or androstanedione
  by a series of reactions involving the activity of HSD3B (3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase),
  HSD17B (17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), and AKR1C (aldo-keto reductase) enzymes.
  Testosterone or androstanedione is then converted to the potent androgen DHT by
  the activity of SRD5A (steroid 5α-reductase). DHT is reduced by AKR1C2 and AKR1C1
  to 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol (3α-diol) and 5α-androstane-3β, 17β-diol (3β-diol),
  respectively. 3α-diol is conjugated by UDP-glucronosyltransferases (UGT) enzymes
  such as UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 to 3α-diol glucuronide (3α-diol G). 3β-diol is hydroxylated
  by cytochrome P450-7B1 (CYP7B1) to triol.
