caption: Role of IFNs and other innate immunity elements in multi-system CoV diseaseAmong
  innate elements, inflammasomes, ILs, and IFNs are of high importance (). Innate
  immunity helps to prevent the spread of viruses and affects ACE2 − a major entry
  path for SARS-CoV2. Therefore, impairments in these elements may contribute to severe
  clinical disease. COVID-19 similar to its ancestors, may utilize ACE2, which can
  be mediated by IFN secretion. IFN may inhibit the replication chain. Retrograde
  synaptic pathway through which SARS-CoV2 infects the central nervous system (CNS)
  also involves ACE2. Here, dissemination of COVID-19 and its replication have been
  illustrated (indigo, I-IX). Also, the activation of innate pathways that upregulate
  IFNs, inflammasome elements, and cytokines has been illustrated (blue, I-VII). Created
