caption: The width of the arrows is determined by the Bayesian score reflecting the
  level of over representation of that enzyme in sporozoites, e.g. 16 for ACS2 and
  8 for FabB/F (). For PDH that consists of three proteins, the width of the arrow
  was determined by the average of those three. Most of FASII proteins are enriched
  in sporozoites, except PKII, FABZ and LipA. The scheme is a simplification of the
  pathway as depicted by Shears et al.[], to which ACS2 was added as it is highly
  enriched in sporozoites and relevant for fatty acid synthesis.
