caption: While the precise role of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 subtypes in psychostimulant-induced
  molecular signaling is not yet known, both these subtypes have been found to phosphorylate
  CREB and activate CREB-mediated gene expression (; ; ). The functional and regional
  specificity of the intracellular pathways they activate is conferred by their presence
  in multi-protein signaling complexes which consist of an anchoring or scaffolding
  protein that secures a kinase and a phosphatase in close proximity to the channel
  allowing regulation of channel activity via phosphorylation (). In the dorsal striatum,
  LTCC phosphorylation is regulated by D1 and D2 receptors (; ). D1 receptors via
  activation of PKA phosphorylate LTCCs at a PKA specific site thereby increasing
  channel activity (, ). On the other hand, D2 receptors via the phospholipase (PLC)/Ca2+/PP2B
  pathway dephosphorylates LTCCs (; , ).
