caption: Proposed model for a novel p53-independent, promyelocytic leukaemia (PML)-dependent,
  regulatory pathway of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by E1A in head and
  neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. E1A, through the activation of TAp73
  and the induction of PML, suppresses EGFR and consequently induces cell death in
  EGFR-overexpressing HNSCC cells. Alternatively, E1A- and TAp73-induced apoptosis
  occurs through the activation of p73 downstream pro-apoptotic targets such as PUMA,
  Noxa and Bax. Arrow lines indicate inductive activities and dotted lines indicate
  suppressive activity.
