caption: Host type IA PI3K pathway components targeted in the RNAi screen. Invasin-mediated
  entry of Y. enterocolitica or InlB-mediated uptake of L. monocytogenes occurs through
  interaction with host β1 integrin or Met receptors, respectively (, , , ). In both
  of these entry pathways, type IA PI3K is activated downstream of host receptors
  and plays a critical role in bacterial internalization (, , , , ). Type IA PI3K
  uses PI(4,5)P2 as a substrate and produces the lipid second messenger PI(3,4,5)P3
  (, ). PI(3,4)P2 is another second messenger, which is generated from PI(3,4,5)P3
  by phosphatases. The RNAi-based screen performed in this study targeted three categories
  of host genes encoding proteins of the type IA PI3K signaling pathway. Category
  I genes encode 15 proteins that interact with the 85-kDa regulatory and/or 110-kDa
  catalytic subunit of PI3K. Category II genes code for 40 proteins that bind to the
  PI3K lipid product PI(3,4,5)P3 and/or PI(3,4)P2. Category III genes encode 14 products
  that are indirectly controlled by type IA PI3K.
