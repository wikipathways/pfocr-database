caption: The result of Reconstruct Pathway from the entire set of disease genes represented
  by KOs in the KEGG DISEASE database. (a) the result page of mapping against KEGG
  modules, which shows that 40 complete modules are reconstructed. One of them is
  M00868 for heme biosynthesis, where all genes are associated with H01763 for porphyria.
  (b) the pathway module M00868 is shown in pink in the pathway map hsa00860 for porphyrin
  and chlorophyll metabolism. Eight genes in this module correspond to eight disease‐associated
  genes in H01763
