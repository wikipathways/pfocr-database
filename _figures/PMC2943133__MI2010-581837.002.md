caption: Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling is mediated by at least two distinct
  pathways. After recognition of a pathogen-specific molecular pattern, TLRs are capable
  of differentially activating distinct downstream signalling events via different
  cofactors and adaptor proteins mediating diverse immune responses []. The MyD88-dependent
  TLR signalling pathway is activated via the conserved, cytoplasmic TIR domain, which
  provides a scaffold for recruitment of the adaptor molecule MyD88 and serine/threonine
  kinases of the IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) family. Following IRAK autophosphorylation,
  the TRAF6 adaptor protein interacts and induces translocation of the transcription
  factor NF-κB to the nucleus, resulting in transcriptional activation of genes encoding
  cytokines and chemokines (TNF-α, NO, COX-2, SOCS (for “suppressor of cytokine signalling”),
  IP-10, IFN-b and IL-1, 6, 8, 10, 12). In addition, expression of proteins involved
  in apoptosis and production of adherent and costimulative molecules such as ICAM1,
  occur. Moreover, TLRs bridge the signalling pathway via ECSIT (for “evolutionarily
  conserved signalling intermediate in Toll pathways”) to TRAF6 for p42/p44 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MKK), p38, and JNK in response to specific bacterial
  products []. The MyD88-independent TLR signalling pathway is activated via TIRAP
  and results in activation of the dsRNA-binding protein kinase PKR. This protein
  has been proposed to be a central downstream component of both the TIRAP- and MyD88-dependent
  signalling pathways and could mediate potential crosstalk between them. The MyD88-independent
  pathway appears to utilise both IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-κB, and results
  in the expression of IFN-g-inducible genes including IP-10.
