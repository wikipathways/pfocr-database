caption: Degradation pathway of L-phenylalanine adapted from Lapadatescu et al. ().
  The schema illustrates the different biosynthesis pathways of compounds belonging
  to the L-phenylalanine degradation pathway identified in cocoa. Compounds known
  to have a floral taste are noted in purple. Compounds known to have a fruity taste
  are noted in orange. Compounds known to have a spicy note are noted in dark red.
  The blue arrows represent the bridges between the L-phenylalanine degradation pathway
  and other biosynthetic pathways. The names of these other biosynthetic pathways
  are framed in blue. Black arrows represent the enzymatic actions. The names of the
  enzymes are indicated (when identified) around these arrows.
