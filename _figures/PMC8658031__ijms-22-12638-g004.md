caption: Potential mode of action of SARS- CoV-2, illustrated as SARS-CoV-2 attached
  to its target ACE-2. After that, the S1 and S2 molecules are cleaved, and ADAM 17
  sheds ACE-2. As a consequence, the body’s level of Angiotensin II rises, resulting
  in respiratory discomfort. During contact, the virus fuses with the membrane and
  penetrates the cell, where protein synthesis and replication occur. ORF8b, ORF3a,
  and E proteins, and also the pathway of NF-κB, all stimulate the inflammasome path,
  resulting in cytokine stimulation in different ways. A cytokine storm ensues, leading
  in respiratory discomfort. Here, ACE2, angiotensin converting enzyme 2; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor- kappa B; ROS, reactive oxygen species; P65, P105, and P50 are the subunit
  of NF-κB transcription complex; TRAF3, TNF receptor associated factor 3; ATR maintain
  to genome integrity by stabilizing replication forks and by regulating cell cycle
  progression and DNA []. Adapted with permission from ref. []. Copyright 2020 Elsevier
