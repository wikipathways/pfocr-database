caption: 'Reflexive covert orienting: the visual grasp reflex. This figure illustrates
  the postulated pathway for the visual grasp reflex in man. In a macaque, time-locked
  EMG responses recorded in the ipsilateral splenius capitis and deltoid, occur 80–90 ms
  following the sudden appearance of a cue in the visual field in a test of reflexive
  covert orienting (). Responses are most marked when there is a gap of 200 ms between
  the fixation target and onset of the cue. Note that the EMG responses in the contralateral
  muscles diminish at the same time as the ipsilateral muscle activity increases.
  The onset of a saccade is not invariable and, if it does occur, the neck and shoulder
  muscle activity may precede saccade onset. The short latency phasic dopamine response
  is also included indicating the effect of salient events signaled to the substantia
  nigra pars compacta [adapted from Ref. ()]. The postulated basal ganglia and brainstem
  pathway for this time-locked response is discussed in the text. Blue arrows indicated
  inhibition; red arrows indicate excitation. Figure adapted from Ref. () with permission.
