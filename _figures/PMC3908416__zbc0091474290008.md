caption: Panx3 signaling pathways inhibit osteoprogenitor cell proliferation and promote
  cell cycle exit. A, Wnt signaling in the proliferation stage of osteoprogenitor
  cells. Wnt binding to a frizzled receptor and its co-receptors LRP5/6 stabilizes
  the β-catenin protein. The inactivation of GSK-3β by phosphorylation through PKA
  is involved in this β-catenin stabilization process. The stable β-catenin is translocated
  to the nucleus and activates gene expression necessary for cell proliferation. PKA
  also activates CREB by phosphorylation, which induces expression of cell cycle genes
  for proliferation. B, Panx3 signaling in the transition from proliferation to differentiation
  of osteoprogenitor cells. Panx3 is induced by BMP and functions as a hemichannel.
  The Panx3 hemichannel releases intracellular ATP, resulting in a decrease in cAMP/PKA
  signaling, which in turn reduces proliferation. The reduced PKA activity promotes
  GSK3β activation, which phosphorylates β-catenin for its degradation, leading to
  the inhibition of cell growth. An increase in the inactive CREB by the reduced PKA
  activity results in reduced proliferation. In addition, ATP released from the Panx3
  hemichannel binds to ATP receptors (P2Rs) in its own cell and/or in neighboring
  cells and activates PI3K and Akt signaling. Akt activation promotes the Panx3 ER
  Ca2+ channel to increase [Ca2+]i levels, which leads to activation of the CaM/calmodulin
  kinase (CaMK) pathway. The Panx3-mediated CaM kinase activation promotes Smad/p21
  signaling for cell cycle exit. Dotted arrows in the ATP/cAMP/PKA pathways indicate
  reduced signaling by the Panx3 hemichannel. Red crossed bars indicate that the reduced
  PKA activity increases the active form of GSK3β and inactive form of CREB.
