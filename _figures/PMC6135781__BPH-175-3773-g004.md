caption: Schematic representation illustrating the local mechanisms by which NO released
  from nNOS into the BNST modulates the cardiovascular responses to restraint stress.
  (Inhibitory mechanism) The red dotted arrows indicate the pathway related to the
  predominant inhibitory influence of BNST nitrergic neurotransmission in the control
  of cardiovascular responses to restraint. The NO synthesized by nNOS stimulates
  the release of noradrenaline which in turn facilitates local GABA release via activation
  of α1‐adrenoceptors in GABAergic terminals. The GABA evokes inhibitory postsynaptic
  currents (IPSCs) via activation of the GABAA receptor. (Facilitatory mechanism)
  The blue arrows indicate the facilitatory pathway of nitrergic neurotransmission
  in the BNST in controlling the cardiovascular responses to restraint stress. The
  NO synthesized by nNOS is a prominent signalling mechanism involved in the effects
  of NMDA receptor activation (yellow channel). The thickness of the arrows indicates
  the predominance of the pathways (i.e. inhibitory and facilitatory mechanism). See
  text for further details.
