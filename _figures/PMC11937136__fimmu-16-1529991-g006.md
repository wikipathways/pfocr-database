caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism for reproductive damage
  induced by ICIs through testicular inflammation, oxidative stress, and ferroptosis,
  as well as the protective role of RSV against ICIs-induced reproductive toxicity.
  ICIs enhance T cell-mediated immune responses and increase systemic cytokine levels,
  particularly IFN-γ, within the testis. This leads to a localized inflammatory response,
  potentially contributing to the disruption of the BTB and an imbalance between oxidative
  and antioxidant systems, such as the NRF2-KEAP1 pathway and common antioxidant enzymes.
  Consequently, oxidative stress in the testis may result from these imbalances, acting
  as an inducer for iron homeostasis disorder, lipid peroxidation, and the subsequent
  induction of ferroptosis. The purple wireframe on the right illustrates the application
  of ICIs (indicated by red arrows), which induces downregulation of FTH1 and PFN
  expression, and upregulation of PFN expression, leading to iron overload in testicular
  tissue. Furthermore, ICIs exacerbate lipid peroxidation through the upregulation
  of lipid metabolic enzymes (ACSL4 and COX2) (red arrows in the blue wireframe below)
  and the inhibition of SLC7A11, GSH, and GPX4 expression (red arrows in the green
  wireframe on the left). Significantly, RSV can counteract ICIs-induced reproductive
  toxicity by reducing testicular inflammation, activating the NRF2 signaling pathway,
  and maintaining iron and lipid homeostasis (blue arrows)
