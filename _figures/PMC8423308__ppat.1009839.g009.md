caption: In this model, expression of the hyperactive STE11ΔN467 allele (red box)
  induces activation of the canonical Cek1 MAPK pathway (Ste11-Hst7-Cek1) and activates
  the downstream transcription factor Cph1. Cph1 activation in turn induces increased
  ß(1,3)-glucan exposure through regulated expression of genes within its regulon,
  and mediates a positive feedback loop into the pathway to further hyperactivate
  the upstream MAPK Cek1 and increase its transcriptional output. Simultaneously,
  Cph1 activation causes an upregulation in the transcript levels of the cell wall
  sensor DFI1, which is then stimulated as a result of hyperactivation of the Cek1
  MAPK pathway and initiates signaling in a parallel, unidentified, pathway that is
  also necessary to achieve the full levels of unmasking during STE11ΔN467 expression.
