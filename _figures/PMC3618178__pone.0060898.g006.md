caption: In response to various stimulus, transcription factors, STAT1, NFκB, and
  RELA, are activated resulting in the transcription of CXCL10 gene to mRNA –. Atorvastatin
  inhibit activation of RELA (NFκB3/p65) , , NFκB complex ,  and STAT1 . Atorvastatin
  increases expression of HO-1  which inhibit activation of NFκB complex , STAT1  as
  well as expression of CXCL10 . Atorvastatin stimulates production of nitric oxide
  (NO) , which inhibit active NFκB/p65 and NFκB complex –. ATV = atorvastatin; IRBC = infected
  red blood cells; HO-1 = heme oxygenase-1; NO = nitric oxide; RELA = v-rel reticuloendotheliosis
  viral oncogene homolog A (avian); NFκB = nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide
  gene enhancer in B-cells; STAT1 = signal transducer and activator of transcription
  1.
