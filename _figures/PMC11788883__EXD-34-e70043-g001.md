caption: Vitamin D has immunomodulating effects on the adaptive and innate immune
  systems by altering the behaviour, number as well as cytokine/ growth factor expression
  of various immune cells. Through its signalling pathway, seen in all these cells,
  initiated by the binding of vit D3 (1,25(OH)2D) to VDR, the resulting vit 1,25(OH)2D
  /VDR complex interacts with vit D response elements (VDREs) in target gene promoter
  regions, thereby regulating their transcription. This complex, favouring binding
  with retinoid X receptor (RXR), triggers an epigenetic effect, altering the transcription
  of immune and inflammatory genes. Purple dotted arrows indicate activation of the
  specific immune cells, and the solid black lines indicate the epigenetic effects
  of the vit 1,25(OH)2D /VDR complex binding to RXR. Created by Creative Studio and
