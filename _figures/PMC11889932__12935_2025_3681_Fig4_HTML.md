caption: The regulation of ferroptosis through the interaction of iron metabolism
  and the STAT3/NRF2 pathway. In conditions like osteosarcoma and periodontitis, STAT3
  activates NRF2, promoting antioxidant defense and osteogenic differentiation by
  upregulating key genes such as GPX4 and SLC7A11, which protect against ferroptosis.
  IL-6/STAT3 signaling increases hepcidin expression, inhibiting ferroportin and leading
  to iron accumulation and ferroptosis through the Fenton reaction. Additionally,
  STAT3 drives ferritin degradation via NCOA4, releasing iron and exacerbating ferroptosis
  in cardiac injury. In chemotherapy-resistant osteosarcoma, the STAT3/NRF2/GPX4 axis
  enhances resistance to ferroptosis, while targeting this pathway could sensitize
  cancer cells to ferroptosis inducers. The STAT3/HO-1 pathway in liver injury also
  contributes to ferroptosis by promoting iron dysregulation and oxidative stress.
  This integration highlights STAT3’s pivotal role in modulating ferroptosis through
  iron metabolism and antioxidant pathways across different diseases
