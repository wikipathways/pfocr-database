caption: 'The mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer cells. Two pathways are involved.
  The intracellular pathways include drug accumulation and absorption reduction, drug
  target inactivation or alterations, genes involved in apoptosis downregulation,
  and membrane lipid alteration. In the meantime, the extracellular pathways including
  EMT, CSCs, and TME also contribute to the development of drug resistance. Abbreviations:
  P-gP; P-glycoprotein, MRP; multidrug resistance-associated protein, BCRP; breast
  cancer resistance protein, LRP; lung cancer resistance protein, TME; tumor microenvironment,
  EMT; epithelial–mesenchymal transition, CSCs; cancer stem cells, Bcl-2; B-cell lymphoma
  2, Bax; Bcl-2-associated X protein, Bak; Bcl-2 homologous antago-nist/killer, PTEN;
  phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10, PI3K; phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase, AKT; protein kinase B, S1P; sphingosine phosphate, SK-1; sphingosine Kinase-1,
  GCS; glucosylceramide synthase, CTR1/2; copper transport protein 1/2, Topo; topoisomerase'
