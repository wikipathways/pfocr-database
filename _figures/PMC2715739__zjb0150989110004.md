caption: Summary of the reactions of BpsA and BpsB. BpsA catalyzes the synthesis of
  alkylpyrones and alkylresorcinols. The main in vivo products produced by B. subtilis
  carrying bpsA are triketide pyrones, and those produced by B. subtilis carrying
  both bpsA and bpsB are their methyl ethers. This major pathway is highlighted with
  thick arrows and squares. Small amounts of tetraketide pyrones and resorcinols also
  are produced as by-products.
