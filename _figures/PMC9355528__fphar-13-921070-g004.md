caption: The effect and pathway of available therapeutic agents in glioma pertinent
  to ROS. Chidamide increases ROS production through the Hh signaling pathway. Melation
  promotes apoptosis by suppressing ROS production, leading to the reduction of its
  downstream factor NF-κB. Chaetocin promotes ROS production and can promote apoptosis
  through the p53 pathway or the ATM/YAP1 pathway. Celastrol and polyphyllin VI promote
  ROS generation to induce apoptosis via JNK pathway. Osthole and shikonin increase
  ROS by promoting RIP1/3 expression. Increased ROS expression by selenocysteine inhibited
  Akt pathway on one hand and activated p53 pathway on the other hand to promote cell
  apoptosis. Increased ROS expression by polyphyllin VI and cannabidiol activates
  p38 pathway to induce apoptosis. Deoxypodophyllotoxin increases the expression of
  ROS and thus PARP1 expression, causing parthanatos. Silibinin and dicholoroacetate
  can have inhibition of glycolysis and increase ROS expression. ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa enhancer binding protein; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; RIP1/3, receptor interacting protein kinase 1/3; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated; YAP1, Yes-associated protein 1; PARP-1, poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1.
