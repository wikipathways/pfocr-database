caption: 'NAD biosynthetic and recycling pathway of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium
  incorporating conclusions drawn from this study. The oxygen-stimulated pyridine
  nucleotide cycle is the cycle of reactions that take NADP through NMN to NaMN and
  back to NAD. The three routes for assimilation of exogenous NMN are indicated as
  follows: route one, large solid arrows; route 2, dashed arrows; and route 3, arrows
  in boxes. Abbreviations: Asp, aspartic acid; IA, iminoaspartic acid; Qa, quinolinic
  acid; Na, nicotinic acid; NaAD, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide. The known genes
  are indicated for the appropriate reactions. Question marks indicate activities
  that have been assayed or are likely to exist but for which no gene or protein has
  been identified. Proteins in circles are transport proteins, and an asterisk indicates
  that a protein has been mutationally altered to transport either NmR or NMN.'
