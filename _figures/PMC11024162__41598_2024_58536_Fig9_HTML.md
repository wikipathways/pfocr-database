caption: TGFβ signaling pathway. TGFβRI, and TGFβRII are phosphorylate SMAD2 and SMAD3
  after binding to TGFβ ligands. Activated SMAD2 and SMAD3 subsequently form a complex
  with SMAD4. SMAD complex is a nucleoprotein that controls cell proliferation, apoptosis,
  metastasis, and angiogenesis, as well as modulating target gene expression and tumor
  formation. MiRNAs target TGFβ, TGFβRI, TGFβRII, SMAD2/3 and SMAD4 leading to disrupt
  inhibition of growth in TGFβ signaling pathway. Overexpressed miRNAs (red color)
  and downexpressed miRNAs (blue color). Direct regulation is indicated by red dashed
  arrows and lines
