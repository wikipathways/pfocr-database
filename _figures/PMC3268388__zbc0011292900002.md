caption: Viroplasms (virion factories) associate with LDs in RV-infected cells. Upper
  panel, during the RV life cycle, infectious virions (TLPs) enter enterocytes through
  endocytosis, whereby the outer layer is removed within endocytic vesicles. DLPs
  actively transcribe the viral RNA into mRNA, which is released and serves as a template
  for translation and viral RNA replication. Viral RNA replication and the first steps
  of viral assembly occur in inclusion bodies called viroplasms, colocalizing with
  cellular LDs, which might serve as an assembly platform. Two viral proteins, NSP2
  and NSP5, bind to LDs to form viroplasm-like structures. These viroplasm-like structures
  then associate with precore complexes (VP1, VP3, and viral RNA), VP2, and VP6 at
  the surface of LDs (highlighted in the lower panels). Through a yet to be defined
  mechanism, viroplasms form, and DLPs assemble and traffic to the ER, where they
  interact with NSP4 and are processed to become TLPs, which are released through
  the exocytotic pathway.

  description: Viroplasms (virion factories) associate with LDs in RV-infected cells.
    Upper panel, during the RV life cycle, infectious virions (TLPs) enter enterocytes
    through endocytosis, whereby the outer layer is removed within endocytic vesicles.
    DLPs actively transcribe the viral RNA into mRNA, which is released and serves
    as a template for translation and viral RNA replication. Viral RNA replication
    and the first steps of viral assembly occur in inclusion bodies called viroplasms,
    colocalizing with cellular LDs, which might serve as an assembly platform. Two

    These viroplasm-like structures then associate with precore complexes (VP1, VP3,
    and viral RNA), VP2, and VP6 at the surface of LDs (highlighted in the lower panels).
    Through a yet to be defined mechanism, viroplasms form, and DLPs assemble and
