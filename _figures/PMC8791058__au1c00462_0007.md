caption: Without incubation, the reaction goes through three simultaneous pathways,
  which leads to the formation of a mixture of nanoparticles including solid Au stars,
  Au hollow spheres, hollow Ag–Au stars, and solid Au stars with spherical/cubic AgCl
  cores. With 10 min of incubation, the reaction goes through a single pathway, leading
  to the formation of SHAANs.
