caption: The pathogenetic mechanisms of WT1 in AML. WT1 mutations regulate the expression
  of BCL2 and CCNA, promoting leukemic stem cell (LSC) proliferation and accelerating
  the progression of AML. Additionally, WT1 influences the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway, reducing MYC and CCND expression, which leads to cell cycle dysregulation
  and facilitates AML development. WT1 mutations also induce TET2 dysregulation, activating
  MEG3 and causing aberrant expression of the WT1-MEG3 axis, thereby promoting AML.
  Furthermore, heterozygous or haploinsufficient deletions of WT1 contribute to the
  pathogenesis of AML
