caption: 'Proposed de novo 2-phosphoglycolate salvage pathway. Calvin cycle in red,
  photorespiratory pathway in black, de novo 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG) salvage pathway
  in blue fonts, respectively. In the C3 cycle (not all steps shown), Rubisco fixes
  CO2 to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate to generate two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate.
  Approximately 25% of the time, Rubisco oxygenates ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, generating
  2PG and 3-phosphoglycerate. The photorespiratory pathway consumes ATP to regenerate
  3-phosphoglycerate from two molecules of 2PG. Photorespiration is metabolically
  inefficient, requiring eight enzymatic steps (here the amino donor/acceptor is designated
  R), taking place across four different subcellular compartments, and resulting in
  an overall loss of carbon dioxide and ammonia that needs to be refixed at the cost
  of substantial additional energy (3 ATP and 2 NADPH per CO2, and 1 ATP and 1 NADPH
  per NH3). The proposed de novo 2PG salvage pathway would efficiently convert 2PG
  to xylulose-1,5-bisphosphate in three steps in a single compartment using only one
  ATP and one NADPH, without loss of fixed carbon. The three enzymes needed in the
  proposed de novo 2PG salvage pathway are as follows: kinase (step 1), reductase
  (step 2), and aldolase (step 3). Xylulose-1,5-bisphosphate is a stromal metabolite
  that is converted to the C3 cycle intermediate xylulose-5-phosphate by the cbbY
  protein (). The capacity of the cbbY may not be sufficient to sustain the flux and
  may need to be up-regulated.'
