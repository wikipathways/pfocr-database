caption: 'Schematic representation of the canonical microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis pathway
  in humans: The RNA Polymerase II transcribes the nuclear chromosome-encoded miRNA
  gene into primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) that comprises a stem, a terminal loop, and
  single-stranded 5′ and 3′ RNA tails. The nuclear microprocessor complex-resident
  Drosha, in concert with its cofactor DGCR8, recognizes the pri-miRNA and cleaves
  asymmetrically at defined sites in the stem. The released stem-loop structure termed
  precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) is then transported to the cytoplasm by the Exportin
  5-RanGTP protein complex. The cytoplasmic Dicer, in concert with potential cofactors
  like transactivating response RNA-binding protein (TRBP) and protein activator of
  the interferon-induced protein kinase (PACT), recognizes the 2-nucleotide 3′ overhang
  and/or the 5′ phosphorylated end of the pre-miRNA and cleaves at a defined distance
  from those termini. The ensuing asymmetric ~22-nucleotides-long miRNA duplex, marked
  by the 5′ monophosphate and a 2-nt 3′ overhang on both strands, is then loaded onto
  the AGO protein complex in an ATP-dependent process aided by chaperones and co-chaperones.
  The miRNA duplexes are then unwound and one of the strands (passenger strand), selected
  on the basis of 5′ nucleotide composition and thermodynamic stability, concomitantly
  undergoes dissociation or degradation. The resultant mature miRNA (guide strand),
  in the context of the effector nucleoprotein complex called miRNA-induced silencing
  complex (miRISC), then binds the target mRNA leading to translational suppression
  or mRNA deadenylation or mRNA degradation.'
