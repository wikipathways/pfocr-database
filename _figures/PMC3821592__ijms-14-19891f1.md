caption: AGE-RAGE, oxidative stress and amplification loops linked to the pathogenesis
  of chronic disease. We propose that generation and accumulation of AGEs (red triangles)
  may be an important triggering event in a diverse array of stimuli, such as hyperglycemia,
  natural aging, inflammatory mechanisms and oxidative stress (such as via the myeloperoxidase
  pathway), and ischemia-reperfusion. Once AGEs achieve degrees of modification/concentrations
  sufficient to bind to and activate RAGE, RAGE signaling, at least in part through
  the interaction of its cytoplasmic domain with the formin, mDia1, results in activation
  of NADPH oxidase and the generation of ROS. Such ROS, via mitochondrial amplification,
  may generate even further ROS. One consequence of increased NADPH oxidase- and mitochondrial
  ROS generation is the consumption of antioxidant defenses. Together with RAGE-dependent
  suppression of Glo1, AGE formation and accumulation is sustained and amplified.
  Once set in motion, AGEs may stimulate recruitment of RAGE-expressing inflammatory
  cells which, when activated, may result in the release of non-AGE RAGE ligands,
  such as S100/calgranulins and HMGB1 (blue triangles). Such non-AGE + AGE ligands
  of RAGE may stimulate yet an additional amplification loop of RAGE activation, that
  is, cellular stress and activation of gene programs that augur tissue damage and
  reduced activation of repair mechanisms. We posit that such cellular stimulation
  mediated by AGE-RAGE and the indicated amplification loops contribute to the pathogenesis
  of the complications of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity and innate
  aging. Blocking AGE formation, RAGE signaling and the indicated amplification loops
  may be essential for the prevention of these chronic disorders.
