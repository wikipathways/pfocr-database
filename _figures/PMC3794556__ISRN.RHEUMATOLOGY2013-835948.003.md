caption: Signaling pathways involved in EndoMT. The diagram shows the numerous putative
  pathways that may participate in the EndoMT process and may be involved in SSc pathogenesis.
  One central pathway initiated following ligand-binding activation of the Smad-independent
  TGF-β pathway causes phosphorylation of GSK-3β mediated by PKC-δ and the c-Abl nonreceptor
  kinase. Phosphorylation of GSK-3β at serine 9 (ser9) causes its inhibition which
  then allows Snail-1 to enter the nucleus. Nuclear accumulation of Snail-1 results
  in marked stimulation of Snail-1 expression which then leads to acquisition of the
  myofibroblast phenotype with stimulation of α-SMA. The inhibition of GSK-3β ser9
  phosphorylation by specific inhibition of PKC-δ or c-Abl activity allows GSK-3β
  to phosphorylate Snail-1 targeting it for proteosomal degradation and thus effectively
  abolishes the acquisition of the myofibroblastic phenotype and the fibrotic response.
  Other pathways such as those involving ET-1, Wnt, NOTCH, hypoxia, and cellular stress
  responses may also participate although the molecular events have not been fully
  elucidated. Modified from Piera-Velazquez and Jimenez [].
