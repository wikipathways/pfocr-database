caption: PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway. When PD-1 binds to PD-L1 that is expressed
  on the surface of tumor cells, it induced PD-1 phosphorylation of the intracellular
  N-terminal ITIM, thereby recruiting SH2 domain-containing protein tryrosine phosphatase-2
  (SHP-2) to C-terminal ITSM tyrosine. The TCR of T cells binds to the MHC presented
  by APC to complete antigen recognition and can secrete antibodies to tumor cells.
  The above procedure can be reversed by PD-1 inhibitors (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab
  and Atezolizumab). In addition, CD28 and ligands (CD80 and CD86) are exposed to
  the tumor microenvironment, T cells become unreactive or eliminated by programed
  cell death.
