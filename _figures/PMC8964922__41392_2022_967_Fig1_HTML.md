caption: The contributing role of STING in inflammatory responses during the late
  phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. a The late phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection causes mitochondrial
  damage in epithelial cells, resulting in the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
  in the cytosol. Furthermore, large amounts of mtDNA activate the cGAS-STING pathway
  excessively, leading to the death of epithelial cells. When macrophages engulf the
  dead cells debris at the vessel lesions, mtDNA triggers cGAS-STING signaling. As
  a result, macrophages produce a large amount of type 1 interferon (IFN), causing
  a robust inflammatory response. The dysregulated cytokine responses drive immunopathology,
  including tissue damage and acute body harm. b, c STING plays a central role in
  inflammation, and the small-molecule STING inhibitor H-151 exerts great effects
  in relieving the immunopathology response and ameliorating the lung pathology at
  the late stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection
