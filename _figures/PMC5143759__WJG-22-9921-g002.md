caption: PIN1 dysregulation and targets in hepatocellular carcinoma. PIN1 functions
  as an amplifier to augment the oncogenic activities of key phosphoproteins involved
  in HCC tumourigenesis. PIN1 gene expression is up-regulated by various transcription
  factors, including E2F family and activated NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NCID),
  but is down-regulated by miRNAs (miR-200b/c and miR-296). In addition, PIN1 inactivates
  retinoblastoma protein (Rb), resulting in the release of E2F for activation of PIN1
  expression. Through phosphorylation-dependent prolyl isomerization, PIN1 activates
  the β-catenin/cyclin D1 signalling pathway by induction of β-catenin transcriptional
  activity and stabilization of cyclin D1 protein. In parallel, PIN1 increases the
  transcriptional activities of c-Jun and NF-κB, leading to an increase in cyclin
  D1 transcription. Furthermore, PIN1 stabilizes hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx)
  and enhances its transactivating activity on downstream target nuclear factor-kappa
  B (NF-κB), which in turn increases cyclin D1 transcription. Up-regulation of cyclin
  D1 leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumourigenesis. In addition, PIN1
  increases the antiapoptotic function of survivin to inhibit apoptosis and contribute
  to tumourigenesis. Through interaction with Akt and ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K),
  PIN1 also activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to promote tumourigenesis. PIN1 enhances
  the transcriptional activities of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and activator
  protein (AP)-1, resulting in up-regulation of angiogenic factor vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) and promotion of angiogenesis.
