caption: The diagram illustrates the role of PCBP2 in immune evasion in prostate cancer.
  PCBP2 inhibits the enzymatic activity of cGAS, reducing the conversion of ATP and
  GTP into cGAMP. The activation of the downstream cGAS-STING signaling pathway is
  suppressed, leading to decreased phosphorylation and activation of STING, TBK1,
  and IRF3. This results in the attenuation of the immune response against prostate
  cancer cells
