caption: Cisd2 slows down liver aging by maintaining metabolic homeostasis and attenuating
  age‐related pathological damage and its associated functional decline. (a) During
  natural aging, the protein level of Cisd2 is significantly decreased by about 50%
  in the aged livers of old mice, which was associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism
  and fatty liver disease. Elevated levels of ROS/RNS, increased lipid peroxidation,
  and a higher frequency of mitochondrial DNA deletion, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction
  thus form a vicious cycle. Various Nrf2‐mediated mechanisms are then activated to
  deal with the oxidative stress. This Nrf2 pathway is likely to be a compensatory
  effect that occurs in response to the elevated ROS/RNS levels. Subsequently, the
  vicious cycle of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction is likely to lead
  to metabolic stress, and the disruption of various important gene networks, including
  the Hnf4a pathway, which is crucial to hepatocyte function, as well as the activation
  of a range of inflammation responses, such as the IL‐6 pathway. Overall, these changes
  will accelerate the development of steatosis (fatty liver disease), NASH (fatty
  liver disease with inflammation), and fibrosis, thereby triggering liver aging.
  (b) In the Cisd2TG mice, a persistently high level of Cisd2 in the liver throughout
  the mouse lifetime appears to maintain a youthful transcriptomic profile, thus counteracting
  the age‐related structural damage and related functional decline
