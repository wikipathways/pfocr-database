caption: 'Regulation of autophagy by amino acids. Autophagosome formation is regulated
  by two major modulators of autophagy, the MTORC1 and PIK3C3 complexes, which integrate
  amino acid signaling. Under fed conditions, when MTORC1 is fully active, MTORC1
  downregulates autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1 and ATG13, which inhibits the ULK1
  complex. MTORC1 also inhibits the synthesis of ATG proteins and the synthesis of
  proteins involved in the biogenesis of lysosomes at the transcription level, by
  preventing the translocation of TFEB to the nucleus. MTORC1 is activated in two
  ways: first, by insulin/growth factor signaling which involves PIK3C1, PDK1, PKB
  and TSC1/TSC2 as signaling components, and second, by amino acids through the Rag
  GTPases. To be active, MTORC1 has to localize at the lysosomal membrane, where its
  co-activator RhebGTP resides. In response to amino acids, Rag promotes the translocation
  of MTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane and its consecutive activation. Rag proteins
  are heterodimers of two subunits: RagA/B and RagC/D in which RagA/B is linked to
  GTP and RagC/D to GDP in the most active form of the dimer. The Rag GTPases are
  regulated by the v-ATPase, Ragulator and leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LRS). The nucleotide
  status of RagA/B and of RagC/D is regulated by GATOR and folliculin, respectively
  (not shown in the figure, for the purpose of clarity; see main text). In response
  to a rise in the intralysosomal pool of amino acids, the v-ATPase, present in the
  lysosomal membrane, changes its conformation and recruits Ragulator which displays
  a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity toward RagA/B. This results
  in the formation of RagA/BGTP and the activation of MTORC1. In this mechanism, the
  transporter PAT1, responsible for the efflux of amino acids from the lysosome, controls
  the concentration of amino acids in the lysosomal lumen and thus the extent of MTORC1
  activation. In the presence of cytosolic leucine, binding of leucine to LRS reveals
  its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward RagC/D, resulting in the formation
  of RagC/DGDP and activation of MTORC1. The activity of Rag is also promoted by glutamate
  dehydrogenase (GDH). This mitochondrial enzyme, which plays a central role in amino
  acid catabolism, is allosterically activated by leucine. The production of 2-oxoglutarate
  by GDH may stimulate the loading of RagB with GTP. GDH may also activate MTORC1,
  and inhibit autophagy, through other distinct mechanisms. (1) The production of
  NAD(P)H by GDH may lead to the reduction of ROS, a potent activator of autophagy
  which acts through MTORC1-dependent and MTORC1-independent pathways (i.e., by inhibiting
  MTORC1 and PKB and by activating AMPK and ATG4). In addition to NAD(P)H, 2-oxoglutarate
  can also act as a scavenger of ROS, which oxidizes 2-oxoglutarate to succinate non-enzymatically.
  (2) The production of 2-oxoglutarate by GDH replenishes the citric acid cycle intermediates,
  increases the rate of ATP production and inhibits AMPK. The fall in AMPK activity
  may inhibit autophagy by MTORC1-dependent and MTORC1-independent mechanisms (i.e.,
  by inhibition of TSC1/TSC2, stimulation of MTORC1 and inhibition of the ULK1 complex
  and of Beclin1). Probably acting in parallel with the Rag GTPase pathway, MAP4K3
  and IPMK are other proteins involved in the regulation of MTORC1 by amino acids.
  The extracellular pool of amino acids may be sensed by the plasma membrane amino
  acid receptor T1R1/T1R3, which regulates MTORC1 and autophagy. The other major protein
  complexes controlling autophagy contain the Beclin1 protein. The core proteins of
  these two complexes are Beclin1, PIK3C3 and PIK3R4. When associated with ATG14 and
  AMBRA1, Beclin1 stimulates the early steps of autophagosome formation, downstream
  of the ULK1 complex. When associated with UVRAG, Beclin1 is mainly involved in the
  formation and maturation of autophagosomes. In response to amino acids, the protein
  kinase JNK1 becomes inhibited, leading to the formation of a stable complex between
  Beclin1 and Bcl-2 which sequesters Beclin1 and results in inhibition of autophagy.
  Beclin1 is also inhibited by PKB-dependent phosphorylation, which likewise inhibits
  autophagy. Long-term regulation of autophagy by PKB occurs by phosphorylation of
  FoxO3, another transcription factor (in addition to TFEB) responsible for the synthesis
  of ATG proteins. For further details, see main text. For reasons of clarity, the
  control of the inhibitory acetylation of ATG proteins by mitochondrial amino acid
  catabolism, which increases the concentration of acetyl CoA in the cytosol, is not
  indicated in the figure'
