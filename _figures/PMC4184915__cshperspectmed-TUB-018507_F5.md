caption: Nutritional immunity to Mtb. (A) Depletion of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  and potential glyoxylate shunt substrates via a cis-aconitate decarboxylase known
  as immunoresponsive gene-1 (IRG1) that resides in mitochondria. Position at which
  IRG1 blocks anaplerotic substrate production for Mtb is shown. Isocitrate lyases
  1 and 2 (ICL1/2) that serve as important Mtb anaplerotic enzymes in the glycoxylate
  shunt and that are the functional Mtb paralogs of methylcitrate lyases (MCLs) in
  the methylcitrate pathway () are also depicted. (Adapted from data in .) (B) Tryptophan
  depletion by the IFN-γ-induced enzyme, indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), in activated
  macrophages. Mtb genes encoding the enzymes known to be involved in generating precursors
  of tryptophan biosynthesis are shown in blue font.
