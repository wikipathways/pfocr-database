caption: Right hand side of the diagram (Wnt-Frizzled signaling) shows that when epithelial
  cells shift below the lens equator they initiate fiber differentiation in response
  to FGF in the posterior segment. This includes upregulation of Wnt-Fz signaling
  components and pathway activation that plays a key role in fiber elongation and
  differentiation (). This response also involves translocation of Fz (green) and
  centrosome (red spot) to the apical tip of elongating fibers and we propose this
  acts as the key organizer centre for cytoskeletal assembly and dynamics. Early in
  the elongation process the fibers are concave (long blue arrows) as they orient
  towards the overlying epithelium in response to a polarizing cue, possibly a Wnt
  (purple). As elongation progresses the fibers take on convex curvature (short blue
  arrows) as their apical tips migrate towards the pole, possibly in response to a
  Wnt concentration gradient. Left hand side (Notch-Jagged signaling) shows that where
  the Jag-1 expressing cortical fibers (orange arrows) abut the epithelium this determines
  the germinative zone (yellow star).
