caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism by which melatonin protects
  human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells against high glucose-induced fibrosis
  through the upregulation of PrPC. Under high glucose conditions, the production
  of ROS is increased in human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, resulting in
  cell proliferation along with a decrease in cell survival. High glucose conditions
  also inhibit the antioxidant activity and increase the activation of the fibrosis-mediated
  signaling pathway through the TGF-β-Smad2 signaling axis, which increases the level
  of ECM proteins, such as fibronectin, collagen I, and α-SMA. Melatonin suppresses
  the high glucose-induced alteration of the fibrotic phenotype through the upregulation
  of PrPC, leading to the inhibition of renal fibrosis.
