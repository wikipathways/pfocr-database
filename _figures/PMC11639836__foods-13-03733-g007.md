caption: GRP improves the predictive pathways associated with ALD’s effect. Green
  dots represent metabolic pathways, and other dots represent metabolite molecules.
  The size of the metabolic pathway point indicates the number of metabolite molecules
  connected to it, where the higher the number, the larger the point, and the size
  of the metabolite molecular point indicates the log2(FC) value through the gradient
  change. The colors in the figure represent correlations, with green representing
  negative correlations and red representing positive correlations. The red boxes
  are the two main metabolic pathways described below
