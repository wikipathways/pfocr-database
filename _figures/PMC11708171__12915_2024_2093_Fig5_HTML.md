caption: Proposed mechanism of mCRP-driven neutrophil dysfunction. PT triggers a complex
  inflammatory response leading to pCRP dissociation to mCRP. At the site of injury,
  mCRP deposition co-localizes with inflammatory cells, which can exacerbate inflammation
  and can culminate into organ injury. In contrast to pCRP, mCRP alters important
  neutrophil effector functions. Among them, mCRP initiates activation of neutrophils
  by increasing CD11b and by decreasing CD62L expression and induces NET formation
  in neutrophils. Mechanistic pathways involve activation of the p38 MAPK signaling
  pathway and activation of NADPH oxidase by phosphorylation and translocation of
  p47phox to the cellular membrane. Moreover, ROS production and histone H3 modification
  by PAD4 involves the release of dsDNA, MPO, and Elastase, which might contribute
  to an increased inflammatory microenvironment and organ injury. Blockade of pCRP
  dissociation inhibits downstream inflammatory responses. Blockade of PAD4 activity
  by GSK 484 inhibits dsDNA release and thus NET formation
