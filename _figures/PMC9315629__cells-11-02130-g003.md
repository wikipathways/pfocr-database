caption: 'CircRNAs responsible for upregulation of glioblastoma growth: A schematic
  representation of the circRNAs involved in the regulation of glioma cell proliferation,
  migration, and invasion, among other functions. Numerous known circRNAs operate
  as miRNA sponges, subsequently increasing the amount of expression of the appropriate
  target genes. These target genes or proteins further influence downstream factors
  involved in cancer signaling pathways by functioning as transcription factors or
  regulatory proteins, as well as through other mechanisms. CircRNAs such as hsa-circ-0046701,
  circ-UBAP2, circ-PARP4, Hsa-circ-0008344, circ-PITX1, circ-ASAP1, circ-MAPK4, circ-TTBK2,
  circ-0082374, circ- 0001730, circ-0043278, circ-0000177, circ-0000215, circ-0037655,
  circ-PIP5K1A, circ-SHKBP1, circ-NT5E, hsa-circ-0067934, circ-HIPK3, circ-MMP9, hsa-circ-0012129,
  circ-ZNF292, circ-CFH, and circ-NFIX are responsible for the up-regulation of glioblastoma
  growth through different pathways including those of the Mapks, Wnt/β-catenin, TCF12,
  PI3K/AKT, SOX4/PI3KCA, and Notch. For example, circ-TTBK2 activates the Mapks signaling
  pathway through miR-217.'
