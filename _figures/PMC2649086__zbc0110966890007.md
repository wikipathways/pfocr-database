caption: Model of KLF14-mediated TGFβRII silencing. Activation of the  TGFβRII would
  occur via TGFβ1 ligand initiating an up-regulation of  the TGFβRII promoter by Sp1.
  In our model, activation  of the TGFβ pathway also causes an induction of KLF14
  expression  (A), which would, in turn, bind to the TGFβRII  promoter through its
  GC-rich sites (B), competing away Sp1  (C), recruiting the Sin3a/HDAC complex (D),
  and remodeling  chromatin from a transcriptionally “active,” acetylated state to  an
  “inactive” state with silencing methyl marks (E).  Thus, KLF14 mediates a negative
  feedback loop to down-regulate the type II  TGFβ receptor upon TGFβ stimulation.
