caption: (A) Overview of computational algorithms used to identify master transcription
  factors.(B) Network view of “master” transcription factors associated with metabolic
  expression subtype. The line thickness indicates the number of cancer types where
  the connection was identified. Only the connections identified in ≥3 cancer types
  are shown.(C) Network view of “master” miRNA regulators.(D) MiRNA hsa-miR-320a identified
  as a master regulator for expression subtypes of the nucleotide metabolism pathway
  in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). SCNAs of hsa-miR-320a lead to a lower expression
  in the samples of downregulated subtype. Its target genes are significantly enriched
  in genes highly expressed in the downregulated subtype. The middle line in the box
  is the median, and the bottom and top of the box are the first and third quartiles,
  and the whiskers extend to 1.5× interquartile range of the lower quartile and the
  upper quartile, respectively.
