caption: Schematic diagram on the protective role of palmitoleate against inflammation
  and inflammasome activity. Palmitoleate blocks NF-κB p65 subunit nuclear translocation,
  thereby blocking LPS-mediated activation of NF-κB pathway and proinflammatory cytokine
  gene upregulation. Palmitoleate also blocks NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated cleavage
  of procaspase 1 and pro-IL-1β to active caspase 1 p10/p20 subunits and IL-1β, respectively,
  thereby preventing LPS and saturated free fatty acid–induced cellular death and
  inflammation. Further, palmitoleate also prevents LPS + palmitate (PA)-induced cellular
  MAPK and inflammatory responses. Illustration was made using BioRender. IL, interleukin;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NLRP3, NACHT, LRR,
  and PYD domain–containing protein 3
