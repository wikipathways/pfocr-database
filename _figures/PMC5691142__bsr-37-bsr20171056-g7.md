caption: (↑ increase; ↓ decrease; gray blocks represent unaffected proteins; solid
  arrows represent findings in this study and dashed arrows represent findings reported
  previously [–,,]). Excessive GCs stimulated protein degradation through MuRF1, but
  not atrogin-1. Other pathway that is independent of Akt/FoXO1 pathway may account
  for the excessive GC-induced MuRF1 activation. There is a cross-talk between anabolic
  regulator mTOR and catabolic regulator FoXO1-MuRF1.
