caption: The bait proteins are represented by blue nodes. The nodes of interacting
  proteins are represented smaller and in intense orange when they have a well-known
  function in NF-κB and/or cell death signaling, in light orange when they can be
  linked to NF-κB and/or cell death signaling, and in grey when no function or link
  with NF-κB and/or cell death signaling is known so far. Interactions (edges) are
  represented by arrows that point from the bait protein to the identified interacting
  protein. Interactions that are independent of TNF treatment are shown in grey, interactions
  that appear or disappear upon TNF treatment are shown in green and blue respectively.
  Known interactions in the BioGRID database are represented by thicker lines (edges).
  Well-known protein complexes are shown in red boxes.
