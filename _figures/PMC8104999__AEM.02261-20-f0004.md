caption: Metabolic network of cellular pathways impacted by As(V). Metabolites were
  mapped onto KEGG metabolite pathways to show the potential metabolic network based
  on the reference organism A. tumefaciens Ach5. Green text indicates metabolites
  increased in abundance, red text indicates metabolites decreased in concentration,
  and black text indicates intermediate metabolites that were not identified by LC-MS.
  Black dashed arrows indicate pathways that involve more than two intermediates.
  When more than two intermediates are required, the number of reactions is shown
  (e.g., X3). Numbers in parentheses refer to the relevant KEGG pathway maps.
