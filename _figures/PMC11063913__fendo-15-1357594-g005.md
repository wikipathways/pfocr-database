caption: Graphical summary During sex determination in the male embryo, the expression
  of numerous cytokines at specific times and spaces act together to regulate the
  lineage differentiation of Sertoli cells. GATA4 ensures the transition of PGCs to
  meiotic germ cells by promoting the formation of germinal ridges. WT1 influences
  the polarity of Sertoli cells through the regulation of the non-canonical WNT pathway,
  which promotes the lineage differentiation of Sertoli cells. SF1 participates in
  mammalian sex determination through the activation of the promoter of AMH. SOX9
  maintains its expression in Sertoli cells through three pathways mediated by SF1,
  FGF9/FGFR2, and PGDS/PGD2, respectively, thus ensuring that a sufficient number
  of Sertoli cells are available to induce testicular development. GATA4, GATA binding
  protein 4; PGCs, primordial germ cells; SF1, steroidogenic factor-1; AMH, anti-Müllerian
  hormone; SOX9, sex-determining region Y-box 9; FGF9, fibroblast growth factor 9;
  PGD2, prostaglandin D2; PTGDS, prostaglandin D synthase
