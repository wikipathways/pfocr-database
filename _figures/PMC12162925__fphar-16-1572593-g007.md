caption: Integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics data. (A) Bubble diagram of
  the significant KEGG pathway for DEGs and DAMs identified between the experimental
  groups. Color of the dots represents the level of significance, with yellow being
  the least and red being the most significant. Size of the dots represents the pathway
  impact values from the pathway topology analysis, and the range of the impact values
  is 0.00–1.00. (B) Possible mechanisms of TB-KW supplementation preventing from abnormal
  lipids metabolism in zebrafish induced by HFD. Ellipse denotes compound, square
  denotes gene; red indicates upregulation, green indicates downregulation, purple
  indicates upregulation but no significant difference, and gray indicates no data
  support. FC, Cholesterol; PL, Phospholipid; CE, Cholesterol ester
