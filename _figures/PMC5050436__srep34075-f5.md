caption: Red-labeled metabolites are identified in Atg7−/− MEFs, blue-labeled metabolites
  are identified in wild-type MEFs. Orange-labeled metabolites are intersection of
  these compounds. Metabolite relationships were derived from HMDB and KEGG databases.
  Solid arrows represent direct metabolic reactions, and dashed arrows represent multiple
  reactions and indirect connections between two metabolites.
