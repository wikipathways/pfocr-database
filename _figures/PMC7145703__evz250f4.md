caption: —Positively selected genes and parallel genes involved in the osteoclast
  differentiation pathway (ko04380). Genes with positively selected sites, parallel
  sites, and both are shown with pink, blue, and gray rectangles, respectively. Foreground
  branches tested for PSGs and pairwise compared branches tested for parallel genes
  are shown above and below the rectangles with red and blue typeface, respectively.
  Yellow rectangles indicate signaling pathways involved in this pathway, the number
  of PSGs, parallel genes, and genes with both positively selected sites and parallel
  sites are shown in red, blue, and black, respectively. For convenience, CF, FM,
  CL, and WH standing for CF bats, FM bats, click bats, and echolocating toothed whales,
  respectively, are shown in this figure.
