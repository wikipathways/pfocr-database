caption: MAML1, as regulator of canonical Notch signaling. A schematic picture of
  canonical Notch signaling is represented in figure. The MAML1 coactivator is illustrated
  as TAD1/TAD2. The small colored dots correspond to post-trasductional modifications,
  such as phosphorylation (light red), ubiquitination (light gray), acetylation (light
  green) and sumoylation (light blue). The black truncated arrows indicate the negative
  molecular mechanisms on the pathway. The figure is widely discussed in the text.
