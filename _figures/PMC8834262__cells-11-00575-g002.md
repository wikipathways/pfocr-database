caption: Roles of PDPN in the tumor-metastatic cascade. Tumor metastasis is a multistep
  biological process termed the invasion-metastasis cascade. PDPN-mediated induction
  of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) reduces E-cadherin levels and promotes
  the dissemination of cancer cells from primary sites. PDPN recruits CD44 and MMP14
  at filopodia, lamellipodia, and invadopodia and stimulates hyaluronan-binding and
  extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, respectively. The intracellular actin cytoskeleton
  reorganization by PDPN also promotes cell motility. These events confer the migration/invasion
  phenotype and stimulate the intravasation. Note that PDPN expression is observed
  at the invasive front of the tumor’s collective invasion, which implies the importance
  of tumor–stroma interaction. PDPN-mediated platelet aggregation promotes survival
  of shear stress and immune attacks in the circulation. Furthermore, platelet-derived
  factors (PDGFs and TGF-β) also promote the tumor cell survival and plasticity. PDPN
  confers stemness, probably through the Rho-ROCK pathway, and promotes colonization
  in a distant organ. Furthermore, PDPN-positive CAFs construct the immunosuppressive
  TME by producing TGF-β, a potent immunosuppressive cytokine. Furthermore, PDPN is
  expressed in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and acts as a co-inhibitory receptor, which
  could control tumor immunity. Thus, PDPN is involved in multiple steps of the invasion-metastasis
  cascade.
