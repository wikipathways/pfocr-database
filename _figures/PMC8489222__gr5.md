caption: The adiponectin/peroxisome proliferator-activity receptor (PPAR)-γ pathway
  in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), thiazolidinediones (TZDs), synthetic ligands
  of PPAR-γ including roziglitazone, induce adiponectin expression. Secreated adiponectin
  binds AdipoR1 on the cell surface and inhibits mechanistic target of rapamycin complex
  1 (mTORC1) through AMPKα2. This results in AKT2 activation and increased contractile
  gene expression. AMPKα2-mediated mTORC1 inhibition can increase insulin sensitivity.
  PPAR-γ also opposes VSMC phenotypic modulation by promoting PKG transcription and
  opposing prohypertensive actions of angiotensin II (AngII).
