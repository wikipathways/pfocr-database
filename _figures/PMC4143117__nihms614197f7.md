caption: (A) Under wild type conditions, increasing levels of BMP activity over development
  promote differentiation (chondrogenesis) and suppress proliferation. During this
  time, normal levels of FGFs promote proliferation by amplifying Shh and Wnt signaling
  (represented as ‘additional factors’), until their downregulation at the end of
  limb specification. When BMP levels are reduced in RG hindlimbs, there is a delay
  in chondrogenic differentiation. FGF levels persist after they are normally downregulated.
  This maintains the high level of proliferation seen in earlier limb mesoderm and
  inhibits normal apoptotic domains. Maintaining proliferation inhibits Sox9 expression
  and entry into a chondrogenic pathway and independently inhibits later chondrogenic
  differentiation. (B) Gene regulatory network underlying digit chondrogenesis. Threshold
  levels of BMPs activate Sox9 in a dose-dependent fashion through Smads in a direct
  or indirect fashion (dashed lines). SOX9, in turn, activates markers of differentiated
  chondrocytes. Amplified FGFs inhibit chondrogenesis both repressing differentiation
  genes in a parallel pathway by regulating a repressor.
