caption: depicts the dysregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway in small cell lung
  cancer (SCLC) cell lines H146 and H446, showing the overexpression of STAT3, which
  inhibits LATS1 activity. This suppression of LATS1 prevents phosphorylation of YAP
  at S127, allowing unphosphorylated YAP to accumulate and translocate into the nucleus.
  In the nucleus, YAP is associated with TEAD transcription factors to activate the
  expression of target genes, including CTGF and CYR61, which promote EMT, invasion,
  and proliferation.CTGF - Connective Tissue Growth Factor; CYR61 - Cysteine-rich
  Angiogenic Inducer 61; EMT - Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; H146 - Human Small
  Cell Lung Cancer Cell Line H146; H446 - Human Small Cell Lung Cancer Cell Line H446;
  LATS1 - Large Tumor Suppressor Kinase 1; S127 - Serine 127; SCLC - Small Cell Lung
  Cancer; STAT3 - Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3; TEAD - TEA Domain
  Transcription Factor; YAP - Yes-associated Protein
