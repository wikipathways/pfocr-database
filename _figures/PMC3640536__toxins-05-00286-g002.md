caption: 'Role of Cav2.2 in ascending pain pathway: Pain signals originating from
  peripheral C and Aδ afferent fibers evoke Cav2.2-mediated synaptic vesicle release
  of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, substance P, and CGRP which activate spinal
  neurons, altering sensory excitability and leading to pain sensations. Direct block
  of Cav2.2 channels by ω-conotoxins from cone snail venoms stops the link between
  the origin of pain and the transmission of pain sensation to the brain, because
  it decreases excessive calcium signalling during hyperactive excitation. Figure
