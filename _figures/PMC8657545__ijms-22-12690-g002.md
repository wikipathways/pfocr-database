caption: ECM–integrin signaling. The most established transduction pathway for ECM
  interactions to the cell is through integrin signaling. (a) During cell detachment,
  activation of ROCK signaling leads to anoikis []. Thus, inhibition of ROCK has been
  beneficial in tissue engineering to prevent cell death during cell dissociation,
  especially in stem cells []. (b) Integrin signaling not only prevents cell death
  but also activates a plethora of signaling cascades in the cell [,,,]. Some of the
  downstream effects of integrin–ECM interactions include cell cycle progression leading
  to cell survival and proliferation, promotion of cell polarity, migration, adhesion,
  and transcriptional control of key pro-angiogenic factors (such as VEGF).
