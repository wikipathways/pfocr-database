caption: (A) The BRAFV600E oncoprotein is constitutively active kinase and does not
  require Ras signaling to phosphorylate MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 kinases. BRAFV600E elicits
  a strong kinase activity (increased phosphorylation, PO4−) compared with wild type
  (wt) BRAF and activates MEK1/2 to phospho-MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 to phospho-ERK1/2, which
  may be involved in the up-regulation of some ECM remodeling genes (i.e. TSP-1, Fibronectin,
  cathepsins) and ECM receptors (i.e. CD44 and integrin α3, α6, and β1). ECM genes
  may trigger tumor cell migration and invasion, and cause thyroid cancer progression.
  (B) BRAFV600E knockdown down-regulates phospho-MEK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 protein
  levels and might result in inhibition of thyroid cancer progression. (C) Thyroid
  cancer cells harboring BRAFV600E show an increased ECM stiffness (e.g. collagen
  or laminin cross linking) and disrupts thyroid cell morphogenesis and polarity compared
  to normal thyroid tissue. This mechanism contributes to thyroid cancer progression
  by increasing cell adhesion, migration, invasion, and metastasis. (D) BRAFV600E
  knockdown results in decreased ECM stiffness and inhibition of thyroid cancer cell
  migration and invasion.
