caption: 'A: Illustration of the mode by which Ad-FDAP12 and Ad-TREM-1 Ig vectors
  modulate the DAP12-mediated signaling pathway in myeloid lineage cells or monocytes/neutrophils.
  The membrane-anchored protein FDAP12 derived from Ad-FDAP12 is flagged in the diagram
  with circular shapes that distinguish from the endogenous DAP12 molecule. The signal
  through DAP12-associating molecules (TREM family, SIRPβ1, MDL-1) is transmitted
  to both FDAP12 and endogenous DAP12. TREM-1 Ig, the adenoviral-derived extracellular
  domain of TREM-1 that was linked to the human Ig Fc portion (dotted in the diagram),
  serves as an inhibitor of DAP12 signaling pathway by competing with an as yet unidentified
  ligand for binding to the TREM-1 molecule. B: Construction of adenovirus vectors.
  The elements inserted into the adenoviral genome are illustrated in two bars (top)
  for Ad-FDAP12 and Ad-TREM-1 Ig vectors, respectively. The pAxCAwt cosmid vector
  containing the above insert was co-transfected into 293 cells with restriction enzyme-digested
  DNA-TPC (Ad genome tagged with 55-kd terminal protein) to generate recombinant adenoviruses.
  EC, Extracellular domain; CAG promoter, cytomegalovirus enhancer and chicken β-actin
  promoter; G poly A, rabbit β-globin poly A signal; FLAG, 24 nucleotides coding for
  eight defined amino acids (DYKDDDDK) serving as a tag; ApR, ampicillin-resistance
  gene; cos, cos site of λ phage; ori, replication origin.'
