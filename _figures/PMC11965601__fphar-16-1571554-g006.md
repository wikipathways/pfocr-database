caption: Mechanism of autophagy regulation in Lycium barbarum L. LBP mitigates cellular
  damage induced by excessive autophagy through the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway, modulation of autophagy-related gene expression, and facilitation
  of autophagosome formation. Lutein exerts its effects by inhibiting autophagosome
  formation via mTOR activation, thereby reducing cellular apoptosis. Quercetin has
  been demonstrated to significantly elevate phosphorylated Akt protein levels in
  the retina. Moreover, Kaempferol has exhibited efficacy in inhibiting the phosphorylation
  of mTOR and ULK1, thereby facilitating the removal of senescent and damaged cellular
  components By Figdraw
