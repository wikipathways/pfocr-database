caption: Failing cardiomyocytes induce NGF via an endothelin‐1 mediated pathway and
  LIF. NGF leads to hyperinnervation (anatomical modulation) and LIF leads to rejuvenation/cholinergic
  differentiation (functional modulation). This phenomenon shows the expression of
  catecholaminergic marker such as reduced TH and increased cholinergic (CHT, ChAT)
  and juvenile markers (PSA‐NCAM). PSA‐NCAM, polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule;
  TrkA, tropomyosin‐related kinase A; NGF, nerve growth factor; LIF, leukemia inhibitory
  factor; LIFR, LIF receptor; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase.
