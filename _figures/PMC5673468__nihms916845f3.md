caption: 'Proposed biosynthetic pathway of compound 1 to 10. PKS-NRPS domain abbreviations:
  KS: ketosynthase; MAT: malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase; DH: dehydratase; MT: methyltransferase;
  KR: ketoreductase; ACP: acyl carrier protein; C: condensation; A: adenylation; T:
  thiolation; R: reductase; ER: enoylreductase. To determine the biosynthetic origin
  of the C18 substituent, we looked for a blocked mutant that may accumulate a precursor
  to 1 and 9 prior to rearrangement. Among the mutant constructs, we isolated a new
  compound 12 upon knockout of the α/β-hydrolase poxO (). 12 is the trans-decalin
  containing alcohol depicted in Figure 3. The alcohol can be formed from the over-reduction
  of the aldehyde 13. This could occur when the Knoevenagel condensation of 13 to
  form 18 does not take place. Formation of similar over-reduced products from PKS-NRPKS
  has been observed. Hence, this suggests that PoxO is responsible for the Knoevenagel
  condensation. More importantly, the structure of 12, and that inferred for 13, reveal
  that the aliphatic chain may be derived from incorporation of a nonproteinogenic
  amino acid, (S, E)-2-aminodec-4-enoic acid (14), by the NRPS domain of PoxE (Figure
  3). Condensation between the octaketide product of the PKS and the amino group of
  14 yields an aminoacyl product 17, which can be cyclized by the Diels-Alderase PoxQ
  and reductively released by the reductive (R) domain of PoxE to yield 13.'
