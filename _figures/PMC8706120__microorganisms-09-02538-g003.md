caption: Molecular mechanisms of herpesvirus-induced carcinogenesis. Shown is a graphical
  representation of the key mediators of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. The known interactions
  between herpesviruses and proteins of this pathway are indicated by green arrows
  (activation) or red T-bars (inhibition). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been shown to
  bind to and activate tyrosine kinase receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR). While human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 7 inhibit rat sarcoma (RAS) bound
  to guanosine triphosphate (RAS-GTP), herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV1/2), Kaposi
  sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) all activate
  RAS-GTP. In addition, KSHV activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2
  (ERK1/2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK). EBV also activates PI3K as well as meiosis-specific kinases MEK1/2 and HSV1/2
  activate rat fibrosarcoma (RAF). Although an association of varicella zoster virus
  (VZV, also known as HHV3) with cancer is not established, it has been shown to be
  capable of transforming cells in vitro and to activate dual specificity mitogen-activated
  protein kinase 6 (MAP2K6). Through these manipulations of the pathway, the processes
  of apoptosis, cell survival and proliferation are deregulated, contributing to carcinogenesis.
