caption: IL-10 stimulation of renal fibroblasts induces HMW-HA production via STAT3
  pathway. This figure is adapted from our recent publication []. It illustrates how
  IL-10 stimulates renal fibroblasts, activates the STAT3 pathway, and upregulates
  HA synthesis, especially HMW-HA synthesized by HAS2 which ultimately results in
  cytoprotection and less fibrosis. Our data demonstrate reduced fibrosis and better-preserved
  tubules. A. Kidney with UUO treated with IL-10. B. Fibroblast from renal cortex
  with HA MW variants in ECM. This schematic is a broad illustration and is not drawn
  to scale. Created with BioRender.com
