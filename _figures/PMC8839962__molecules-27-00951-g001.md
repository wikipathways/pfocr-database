caption: Overview of glucose metabolism in normal (A), AD (B), and PD (C) brains.
  (A) Glucose is the main energy substrate in the brain, as it is the principal source
  of ATP. In the brain, glucose is taken up from the bloodstream by specific glucose
  transporters, to be metabolized through glycolysis. Pyruvate enters the TCA cycle
  coupled with OXPHOS and ATP synthesis. Glucose transport in the brain occurs via
  GLUT1 in astrocytes and GLUT3 in neurons. Insulin-dependent GLUT4 transport also
  occurs in the brain, and its activation leads to insulin receptor signaling, occurring
  through the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, regulating the brain’s main cellular functions.
  Glucose metabolism is prominent in the brain—especially in astrocytes—and strongly
  interconnected among the different cell types. Glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) can be
  channeled into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to support NADPH synthesis, which
  is necessary to sustain the brain’s antioxidant defense, and this is enhanced by
  the recycling of fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) originating from the PPP back to G6P
  due to high GPI activity. (B) Glucose metabolism is impaired in AD brains. Signs
  of impaired insulin signaling cascade are present in AD brains, with insulin resistance
  and downregulation of insulin receptors, which contribute to brain glucose hypometabolism.
  In AD, decreased glucose metabolism impacts the metabolic crosstalk between astrocytes
  and neurons, as the lactate shuttle is impaired, leading to reduced ATP synthesis.
  GLUT1 and -3 are decreased in AD brains, and this correlates to glucose hypometabolism,
  and is a major pathological sign of AD, whereas GLUT2 increases, indicating prominent
  astroglial activation in AD brains. Glycolysis increases in astrocytes and microglia,
  and this is associated with neurodegeneration. G6P and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
  (F1,6BP) levels are inversely correlated with age. Hexokinase (HK), PK, and PFK
  are downregulated in neurons, whereas GAPDH is upregulated and can promote Aβ amyloidogenesis.
  Aβ plays a role in impairing the PPP, leading to G6P accumulation—which inhibits
  HK activity—and to decreased defense against ROS. Aβ oligomers also reduce the IR
  and promote synaptic spine deterioration. (C) Glucose metabolism is dysfunctional
  in PD brains, and this mirrors a significant loss of IR. Furthermore, IRS phosphorylation
  deactivates insulin signaling, leading to insulin resistance. Moreover, the glucose
  transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3 are downregulated. The decrease in glucose metabolism,
  prominent both in neurons and in astrocytes, is associated with pyruvate and lactate
  accumulation and deleterious ATP depletion. Depletion of the ATP-generating enzyme
  PGK is associated with neuronal deficits with PD-like symptoms. Low glucose promotes
  α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation. α-Syn fibrils interact with GAPDH, aldolase (ALD),
  and enolase (ENO), and their activities are consequently decreased. Furthermore,
  GAPDH directly regulates α-syn aggregation and apoptotic neuronal cell death. Increased
  metabolite levels are reported in green, whereas decreased levels are reported in
  red.
