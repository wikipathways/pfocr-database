caption: Model for GalR1 neuroplasticity within the LC. Galanin binds to GalR1 and
  signals through the Gi/Go pathway to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity. In contrast,
  activation of the cyclic AMP/PKA/CREB pathway upregulates GalR1 expression. Thus,
  GalR1 expression is controlled by a cyclic AMP-dependent, negative-feedback pathway.
  In galanin knockout (KO) mice, galanin is not present to stimulate GalR1, relieving
  a tonic inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, cyclic AMP production and PKA activity.
  Loss of galanin-mediated attenuation of adenylyl cyclase activity results in increased
  cyclic AMP/PKA/CREB activity in the LC and consequent upregulation of GalR1.
papertitle: GalR1, but not GalR2 or GalR3, levels are regulated by galanin signaling
  in the locus coeruleus through a cyclic AMP-dependent mechanism.
