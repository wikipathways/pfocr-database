caption: Several reports implicate a transcriptional competition between several members
  of the MYC superfamily with the circadian clock. MYC/MIZ are involved in regulating
  cell proliferation and nutrient utilization of glucose and glutamine by repressing
  the circadian clock [, , ]. Also, the circadian repressor CRY2 has been reported
  to promote MYC degradation through the FBXL3-containing E3 ligase []. The MondoA/MLX
  transcriptional pathway is involved in nutrient sensing and downstream regulation
  of lipogenesis and glutaminolysis in different cancer types []. To date, the direct
  connection between the circadian clock and the nutrient sensing arm of MondoA remains
  to be defined. The consequences of this transcriptional competition between CLOCK:BMAL1
  and the MYC superfamily result in regulation of gene expression programs involved
  in controlling the cell cycle, proliferation, and cellular metabolism.
