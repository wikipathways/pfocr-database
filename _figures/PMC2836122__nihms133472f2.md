caption: Cytokine signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway. Cytokines, including IFNs
  -α, -β and -γ, IL-6 and LIF, signal through receptor complexes (see inset) that
  activate the JAK/STAT pathway. Activation of STAT transcription factors, particularly
  STAT1 and STAT3, induces SOCS1 and SOCS3 gene expression. Both SOCS1 and SOCS3 inhibit
  JAK activity through their KIR. However, SOCS1 binds primarily to phosphorylated,
  receptor-associated JAK proteins through its SH2 domain, whereas the SH2 domain
  of SOCS3 binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of
  receptors. In some cases, however, SOCS1 can bind to phosphorylated receptors and
  SOCS3 can interact directly with JAKs. All of these interactions terminate STAT
  activation and suppress downstream gene expression.
