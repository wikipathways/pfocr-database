caption: 'Schematic representation of different pathways involved in apoptosis. Extrinsic
  pathway: 1. Ligand-death-receptor pathway (green): death factors such as Fas ligand
  (FasL) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) trigger apoptosis by binding on ''death
  receptors'' such as Fas and Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptor 1 (TNFR1). FasL may
  be solubilized to sFasL by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP''s). The death receptors
  recruit procaspase-8 by means of an adaptor protein, Fas associated death domain
  protein (FADD). After cleavage the mature caspase-8 then directly activates caspase-3
  or cleaves Bid. Truncated Bid (tBid) interacts with Bax and Bak. A pore is formed
  in the outer mitochondrial membrane through which cytochrome c (Cyt C) is released.
  2. Cytolytic effector cell pathway (orange): cytotoxic T cells can release granzyme
  B and perforin, a pore-forming protein. Granzyme B activates caspase-3 through cleavage.
  It can also cleave caspase-8. 3. Growth factor depletion pathway (red): deprivation
  of survival factors triggers Cyt C release through activation of Bax and Bak. Intrinsic
  pathway: 4. Mitochondrial pathway (grey): mitochondria release cytochrome c (Cyt
  C) in response to stress. Together with apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1)
  and procaspase-9, Cyt C will form the apoptosome complex. This results in the proteolytic
  activation of the procaspase. Mature caspase-9 can then proteolytically activate
  caspase-3 and other executioner caspases. 5. Endoplasmatic reticulum pathway (blue):
  the ER can also induce apoptosis as a reaction to stress. It might do so by stimulating
  the mitochondrial pathway or by directly targeting the nucleus. In mice both caspase-7
  and -12 are linked to this pathway. These different initiation pathways converge
  further downstream into activation of caspase-3. The effector caspase-3 cleaves
  ICAD (inhibitor of CAD) and releases it from CAD (caspase-activated DNAase). CAD
  translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and can now act as active endonuclease
  and fragment DNA.'
