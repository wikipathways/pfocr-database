caption: Schematic diagram of proposed phyA signaling. (1) Upon FRc exposure, phyA
  localizes from the cytosol into the nucleus through direct interaction with FHY1/FHL
  (). (2) In the nucleus, the phyA signal is transmitted to two major transcription
  factors (HFR1 and LAF1) through FHY1/FHL to promote photomorphogenesis (). However,
  FHY1/FHL does not directly transmit phyA signal to one of the major transcription
  factors, HY5. The unidentified factor X may be involved in the FHY1/FHL-dependent
  pathway. (3) Direct interaction between HY5 and HFR1 or LAF1 may modulate transcription
  factor abundance and hence signaling strength. Taken together, we proposed here
  that HY5 may share the FHY1/FHL signal through interactions with HFR1 and/or LAF1
  (4). Alternatively, HY5 may transmit phyA signals through a FHY1/FHL-independent
  pathway (5). Gray arrows represent the direction of the phyA signaling pathway.
