caption: Metabolic functions of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in liver. Most peripheral
  5-HTs are derived from enterochromaffin cells of the gut. 5-HT regulates hepatic
  fibrosis in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) by activating HSC-produced transforming
  growth factor (TGF)-signaling. Through the 5-HT2B receptor, 5-HT promotes gluconeogenesis
  in hepatocytes by increasing the activity of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase)
  and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6pase). 5-HT2B receptor signaling also inhibits glucose
  uptake by promoting the breakdown of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2). The activation
  of the sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) signaling pathway by
  the 5-HT2A receptor increases lipogenesis in the liver. ERK1/2, extracellular signal–regulated
  protein kinase.
