caption: 'RIG-I signalling pathway and its interaction with the influenza A virus
  polymerase subunits. Centre left to centre bottom: the RIG-I signalling pathway
  is activated upon binding of an RNA ligand, such as the 5′ppp-dsRNA region of the
  influenza virus promoter, by the CTD of RIG-I. A subsequent ATP-dependent conformational
  change exposes two N-terminal CARDs of RIG-I and promotes RIG-I translocation along
  the RNA and formation of a RIG-I oligomer. One of the host proteins that potentiates
  RIG-I signalling is PKR activating protein (PACT), which binds to the CTD domain
  of RIG-I and enhances ATPase activity. RIG-I filament formation brings RIG-I CARDs
  into close proximity, facilitating formation of a CARD tetramer. The tetramer is
  stabilised by ubiquitin chains that are added by TRIM25. The RIG-I complex then
  migrates towards the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it associates with MAVS.
  The interaction between the CARD domains of RIG-I and MAVS nucleates MAVS filament
  formation. MAVS aggregation induces binding of TRAF family E3 ubiquitin ligases
  to MAVS, which potentiate recruitment of IKKs. Activated IKKε and TBK1 phosphorylate
  transcriptional factors IRF3 and IRF7, while transcriptional factor NF-κB is activated
  by the IKKα/β/γ complex. The activated IRF3, IRF7 and NF-κB translocate into the
  nucleus where they induce transcriptional activation of IFN and pro-inflammatory
  cytokine genes. Top left: the influenza virus RNA polymerase shields viral promoter
  from RIG-I recognition. Polymerase subunits also bind RIG-I in an ‘ESIE’-motif-dependent
  manner and interact with PACT. Middle: PB2 binding to MAVS is associated with inhibition
  of IFN expression and is attributed either to its N-terminal domain or to PB2 amino
  acids 588 and 292. PB1 induces degradation of MAVS by forming a complex with MAVS,
  RNF5 and NBR1. PB1 induces Lys27-linked ubiquitination of MAVS by RNF5, which is
  then recognised by NBR1 that targets ubiquitinated MAVS for autophagic degradation.
  Bottom right: PB2 (residues 490–759) binds to TRAF3 and prevents its Lys63-linked
  polyubiquitination by TRIM35, disrupting the formation of TRAF3-MAVS complex and
  preventing activation of TBK1 and IKKε kinases. TRIM35, in turn, induces Lys48-linked
  polyubiquitination of PB2, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. PB2 is also
  targeted to mitochondria via residues L7, L10 and N9. Bottom left: PA inhibits IFN
  production by binding to IRF3 and precluding its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation'
