caption: Pathway analysis indicated that the network “DNA Replication, Recombination,
  and Repair”, containing fourteen out of the 30 significant proteins, is up-regulated.
  The network itself consists of 35 proteins. The up-regulated proteins in early stage
  cervical cancer are marked red, while those that that were down-regulated were not
  identified in this pathway. The intensity of the color relates to fold-change. Proteins
  indicated with a red asterisk were found by LCM, although not differential. Benjamini-Hochberg
  analysis of the same data resulted in two more proteins (encircled in purple) belonging
  to this network (MCM5 and WDHD1). The symbols shown in the network are explained
