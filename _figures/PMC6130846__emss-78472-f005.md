caption: 'Virion cartoon adapted from . The Orsay virus primarily infects intestinal
  cells in C. elegans. Once entered in the host cell, the virus disassembles in the
  cytoplasm and exposes its RNA genome. The Orsay virus has a bipartite positive-stand
  RNA genome that can be directly translated by the cellular machinery. The Orsay
  RNA1 molecule encodes a viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and the Orsay
  RNA2 molecule encodes the capsid protein. Virus amplification occurs in the cytoplasm
  in two steps: (i) the positive-strand genome serves as a template for the synthesis
  of a negative strand antigenome by the viral RdRP; (ii) the antigenome serves, in
  turn, as a template for further synthesis of genomic RNAs. The C. elegans antiviral
  RNAi response is initiated by DCR-1–DRH-1–RDE-4 (Viral RNA Recognition Complex)
  that recognize replicating double-stranded viral RNAs and process them into virus-derived
  small interfering RNAs (primary viRNAs). Primary viRNAs are loaded into the RDE-1
  Argonaute protein and trigger the synthesis of secondary viRNAs by the host RdRP
  RRF-1, that uses the viral RNA as a template. Secondary viRNAs, loaded into somatic
  Argonaute proteins (SAGOs), target viral RNAs by base complementarity and potently
  reduce virus replication,. Viral RNAs are also targeted by the terminal uridylyltransferase
  CDE-1. CDE-1 marks viral RNAs with a 3′ U-tail to recruit 5′ to 3′ exonucleases
  of the XRN family, and 3′ to 5′ exonucleases of the exosome complex. C. elegans
  may have additional antiviral pathways, for example a set of stress response genes
  is induced by a STAT signaling pathway upon virus infection, that could promote
  virus clearance (not shown in this model) ,.'
