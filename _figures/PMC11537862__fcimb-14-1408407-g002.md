caption: Brucella triggers inflammatory responses. VceC binds to the ER chaperone
  immunoglobulin GRP78 to trigger ER stress, activates the IRE1α, translocates TRAF2
  to the ER membrane, and activates the NF-κB pathway with the support of the signaling
  molecules NOD1, NOD2, and the adaptor protein RIP2, inducing an inflammatory response.
  AIM2 recognizes Brucella DNA in the presence of the guanylate-binding protein GBP
  and activates the inflammatory response of the caspase-1 pathway. During ER stress,
  IRE1α is activated to recruit TXNIP and NLRP3 in mitochondria to participate in
  mitochondrial ROS. At the same time, NLRP3 activates Caspase-2 to make the BH3 protein
  Bid a truncated active form, induces the release of DNA from mitochondria, and DNA
  interacts with NLRP3 to activate the inflammatory response of the Caspase-1 pathway.
  Other pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of Brucella, such as LPS, major
  outer membrane proteins, and lipoproteins, trigger inflammatory responses via the
  TLR pathway
