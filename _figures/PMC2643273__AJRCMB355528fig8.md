caption: Schematic signal pathway by which Pi affects in NHBE cells. Based on our
  studies with the transport inhibitor, Foscarnet, Pi is transported into NHBE cells
  through a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter (NPT) and results in the activation
  of Akt by phosphorylation of Thr308. Such activated Akt phosphorylates Raf, MEK,
  ERK, then facilitates Mnk1 translocation from cytosol into nucleus resulting increased
  cap-dependent protein translation.
