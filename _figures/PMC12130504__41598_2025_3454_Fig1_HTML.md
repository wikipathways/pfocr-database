caption: Metabolic pathway and pyruvate cellular transport. (A), Schematic representation
  of the glucose metabolic pathway and cellular transport of [1-13C]pyruvate. Key
  components include GLUT (glucose transporter), MCT (monocarboxylate transporter),
  LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), ALT (alanine transaminase), and the TCA (tricarboxylic
  acid) cycle. (B), The chemical structure of [1-13C]pyruvate and its associated metabolites,
  along with the corresponding 13C chemical shifts (ppm)
