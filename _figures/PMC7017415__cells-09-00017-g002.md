caption: Cellular functions of mitochondria-derived transcripts. MtDNA may be a source
  and a target for non-coding RNA. Question mark indicates that the process or mechanism
  is currently undefined. Nucleus-encoded miRNAs (mitomiRs) are suggested to enter
  mitochondria and regulate mtDNA expression, nevertheless their exact import pathway
  is currently unexplained. Transcription of mtDNA may result in formation of small
  non-coding RNAs (mitosRNAs) which may interplay with mt-mRNAs stability. Mechanism
  of action of mitochondrial small non-coding RNAs is currently undefined. Long non-coding
  RNAs (mt-lncRNAs) may arise from mtDNA transcription and may regulate stability
  and transcription of mt-mRNAs or may serve as baits for mitochondrial RNA-binding
  proteins (mtRBPs). Convergent transcription of mtDNA may result in formation of
  double-stranded RNA (mt-dsRNA). Under normal conditions, L-strand derived transcripts
  are swiftly degraded which prevents formation of mt-dsRNAs. Dysfunction of PNPase
  causes accumulation of mt-dsRNA and its release into cytoplasm. Once released into
  the cytoplasm, mt-dsRNAs can induce type I interferon response via activation of
  MDA5 receptors.
