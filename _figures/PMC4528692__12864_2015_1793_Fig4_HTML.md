caption: 'ΔNp63 and TAp63 TF networks. (a) Interaction Network for ΔNp63. Green molecules
  denote predicted co-regulators. Red arrows represent TFs that are likely direct
  targets of p63 as determined by overlay with ChIP-Seq information. Molecules with
  blue boundaries are those involved in Hair and Skin development and function. (b)
  Interaction Network of TAp63. Molecules denoted in blue are the predicted co-regulators.
  Molecules with green boundaries are involved in lymphoid tissue structure and development.
  The interaction networks (black lines connecting molecules) were generated by QIAGEN’s
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The specific type of evidence in literature is denoted
  by–PP: Protein-Protein interaction, A: Activation, I: Inhibition, T: Transcription,
  E: Expression, PD: Protein-DNA interaction'
