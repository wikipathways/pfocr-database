caption: In vitro reconstitution of the PDCzm-slr1192 pathway. a Overview of the in
  vitro reconstitution process. b Catalytic process of PDCzm-slr1192 and the mechanisms
  for velocity calculation. Equal moles of NADPH would be consumed by slr1192 during
  the ethanol synthesis process, and NADPH has an absorbance peak at 340 nm, so the
  consumption speed of NADPH could be used to calculate the reaction velocities

  synthesis pathway in cyanobacteria cell factories.
