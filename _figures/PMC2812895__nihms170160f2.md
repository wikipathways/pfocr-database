caption: '(A) Key elements of the reward circuit include dopamine and opioid peptide
  neurons that intersect at both the VTA (ventral tegmental area) and the nucleus
  accumbens that are activated during initial drug use and the early binge/intoxication
  stage of the addiction cycle. Drugs approved for the treatment of this component
  of the addiction cycle include naltrexone, buprenorphine, varenicline and disulfiram.
  (B) Key elements of the stress circuit include CRF (corticotropin-releasing factor)
  and noradrenergic neurons that converge on GABA interneurons in the central nucleus
  of the amygdala that are activated during the development of dependence. Drugs approved
  for the treatment of this component of the addiction cycle include methadone, bupropion,
  acamprosate, varenicline and buprenorphine.DA dopamine, NE norepinephrine(Adapted
