caption: Cellular and molecular interactions between HCL cells and their microenvironment.
  HCL cells express CXCR4 chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules for adhesion
  to MSCs, endothelial cells, and extracellular matrix. These pathways are critical
  for homing and retention within the marrow and possibly also the spleen. In these
  tissues, HCL cells can also interact with other accessory cells, such as T cells,
  and may become activated via the BCR. It is currently unknown whether BCR-related
  kinases (Syk, Btk, PI3K) play a role in BCR signaling in HCL; however, these kinases
  and CXCR4 are currently targeted in first clinical trials in patients with other
  mature B-cell malignancies. Cross-talk between HCL cells and their microenvironment
  leads to activation of downstream pathways in HCs, such as mitogen activated protein
  (MAP) kinases and the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway.
