caption: Overview of the production and action signaling pathways of IL-22. IL-22
  is often, but not always, correlated with IL-17 expression. Subpopulations of CD4+
  T cells, CD8+ T cells, innate T cells, and innate lymphoid cells are sources of
  IL-22, IL-22, and IL-17 or IL-17. The main cytokines driving IL-22 expression are
  IL-23, IL-6, and IL-1β. Certain cell types require IL-12, IL-18, IL-21, and TNF-α
  to produce IL-22. TGF-β inhibits IL-22 production in all T-cell subsets but induces
  IL-17 in these cells; IL-22 signals through its cognate receptor/JAK complex, resulting
  in downstream phosphorylation of STAT (homo- or heterodimer). Translocation of these
  STAT complexes to the nucleus drives transcription of genes involved in processes
  ranging from inflammation to angiogenesis and survival. The control of activity
  of this pathway involves different mechanisms including regulation of the phosphorylation
  state of JAK and STAT by phosphatases, or of the JAK kinase activity by SOCS (suppressor
  of cytokine signaling), for example.
