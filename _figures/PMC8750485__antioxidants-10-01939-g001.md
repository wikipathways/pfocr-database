caption: 'NAD+ precursor metabolism and NAD+-consuming enzymes. Tryptophan, NA, NAM,
  and NR can be used by different pathways to obtain NAD+. NAD+ formation can be obtained
  de novo from tryptophan. The first step relies in the conversion of tryptophan to
  N-formylkynurenine by either indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase
  (TDO). N-formylkynurenine can be converted into quinolinic acid and NAD+ thereafter.
  NAD+ synthesis from NA is initiated by the NA phosphoribosyltransferase (NPRT),
  which uses phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form NAMN prior to NAD+ synthesis
  (Preiss-Handler pathway). Finally, the synthesis of NAD+ can be also possible using
  NAM or NR via the Salvage pathway. This pathway just needs 2 steps for each precursor.
  NAM is converted by the rate-limiting nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)
  to form NMN, also using PRPP as a co-substrate. NMN can be also formed by NR phosphorylation
  through the action of NR kinases (NRK1-2). Finally, the conversion of NMN to NAD+
  is eventually catalyzed by cellular NMN adenylyl transferase (NMNAT1-3) enzymes.
