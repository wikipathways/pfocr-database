caption: Regulatory model of VP4 in antiviral signaling in grass carp. Upon GCRV infection,
  GCRV-II major outer capsid VP4 enters into cytoplasm via early endosome and lysosome.
  VP4 targets RIG-I and GRP78 and results in different responses to suppress antiviral
  immunity and facilitate GCRV replication. VP4 interacts with CARD domain and RD
  domain of RIG-I in cytoplasm. After association with VP4, K48-linked ubiquitination
  of RIG-I is enhanced leading to RIG-I degradation. Consequently, signal transductions
  from RIG-I to downstream adaptors IPS-1 and STING are inhibited. Furthermore, VP4
  restrains expression and phosphorylation of IRF3 and the subsequent signals of IFNs
  and NF-κB. VP4 binds GRP78 to activate ER stress via PERK-eIF2α mediated unfolded
  protein response. Meanwhile, dissociative VP4 protein also triggers MyD88-dependent
  TLR signaling pathway and induces production and phosphorylation of IRF7 and subsequent
  IFN secretion.
