caption: 'Regulation of IGF-2 bioactivity at the surface of an ovarian granulosa cell.
  Regulation of IGF bioactivity includes multiple levels of regulatory proteins. This
  figure depicts some of the most relevant IGF proteins expressed in human ovarian
  follicles and how they are up- or downregulated in granulosa cells (GCs) from four
  stages of folliculogenesis: a preantral follicles (< 60 μm to > 150 μm in diameter),
  b small antral follicles (4–6 mm in diameter), c preovulatory follicles prior to
  ovulation induction (pre-OI), and d preovulatory follicles after ovulation induction
  (post-OI). Arrows indicate upregulation (green) or downregulation (red) when comparing
  the four follicular stages. The following functional statements are based on the
  observed up- and downregulation of IGF genes in the four follicular stages evaluated
  in this study: a at the preantral follicle stage, GCs express less IGF-2, IGF1R/INSR,
  IRS1, PAPP-A, and more IGFBPs that may reflect a limited IGF-2 signaling; b in small
  antral follicles, GCs continue to express high levels of IGFBPs and less IGF-2 and
  PAPP-A. In addition, the IGF2R is upregulated in GCs from small antral follicles,
  which reduces IGF-2 bioactivity. However, small antral follicles also begin to upregulate
  the IGF1R/INSR, and IRS1 genes important for transducing the signal, indicating
  a shift to a more active signaling system; c at the preovulatory stage pre-OI, expression
  of IGF-2, PAPP-A, IGF1R/INSR, and IRS1 increases significantly, whereas IGFBP-2
  expression and intact IGFBP-4 protein decreases. This implies an upregulation of
  IGF bioactivity important for the high rate of GC proliferation and aromatase expression;
  d at the preovulatory stage post-OI, the GCs downregulate IGF-2 expression and upregulate
  STC1 that inactivates and modulates PAPP-A activity, which may imply a strict regulation
  of PAPP-A-mediated IGF signaling after ovulation induction'
