caption: Flowchart of exploring the mechanism of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du decoction (HLJDD)
  in treating pneumonia. The active ingredients of HLJDD and their potential targets
  were predicted from different databases. The relevant targets of pneumonia were
  collected from seven different databases. The intersections of the active ingredient
  targets and the disease targets were regarded as common targets. The pivotal active
  ingredients were obtained through a common targets–active ingredients network analysis.
  The overlapping pathways were obtained through pathway enrichment analysis of the
  disease targets and common targets. We used the Cytohubba plug-in to select hub
  genes in the common targets. Finally, the pivotal active ingredients, overlapping
  pathways, and the hub genes were analyzed to explore the mechanisms of HLJDD in
  treating pneumonia. The one-way arrow indicates the relationship of progressive
  and the two-way arrow indicates the relationship of intersections.
