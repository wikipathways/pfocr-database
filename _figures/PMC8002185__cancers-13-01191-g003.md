caption: Serine/glycine biosynthesis pathway activation in tumor treatment resistance.
  The response to targeted therapies in tumors with abnormal activation of RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK
  pathway has been associated with increased expression of serine/glycine biosynthesis
  genes, which might be induced by oncogenic drivers such as EGFRL858R and KRASG12D
  via ATF4 and NFR2, respectively. In addition, serine/glycine biosynthesis pathway
  hyperactivation has been linked to the resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, e.g.,
  doxorubicin, carboplatin, pemetrexed, or 5-fluorouracil in breast, lung, and colorectal
  cancer (CRC), the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in multiple myeloma, as well as
  HIF2α antagonists in renal cell carcinoma.
