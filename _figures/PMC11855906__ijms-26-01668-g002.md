caption: 'A comprehensive scheme for the complex regulation of cardiac non-selective
  autophagy in STZ-induced metabolic cardiomyopathy. Various studies have indicated
  that autophagy plays both protective and pathogenic roles in the development of
  STZ-induced metabolic cardiomyopathy. The pathways involved in the downregulation
  of autophagy STZ-induced metabolic cardiomyopathy are the LKB1/AMPK/ULK1 signaling
  pathway, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, the axis of CREG1-FBXO27-LAMP2, and
  the AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway. Mst1 suppresses autophagy by increasing interaction
  between Beclin1 and BCL2. FOXO1 (forkhead box protein O1) induced excessive autophagy
  in STZ-induced metabolic cardiomyopathy. The RIPK1/RIPK3 signaling pathway and FOXO1
  was involved in excessive autophagic flux in the heart, which was induced by STZ.
  Hyperactivation of miR-34a promotes autophagy in STZ-induced metabolic cardiomyopathy.
  Solid lines represent proven mechanisms, dotted-line arrows represent unknown mechanisms.
  Targeted agents enclosed in yellow oval boxes are connected to therapeutic targets
  by blue lines. Red dots indicate LC3 II. The rest of diverse color dots indicates
  non-selective components involved. (↓: stimulatory modification, ⫰: inhibitory modification).
