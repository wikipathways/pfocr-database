caption: Signaling pathways that regulate mitophagy in diabetic cardiomyopathy. (A)
  When cardiomyocytes are depleted of energy, mTORC1 dissociates from the ULK1 kinase
  complex, ULK1 autophosphorylation increases, and this kinase phosphorylates Atg13
  and FIP200. In addition, ULK1 is phosphorylated by AMPK, which induces autophagy.
  (B) When insulin binds to the insulin receptor, an IRS is recruited, which permits
  the docking of PI3K and the consequent activation of Akt, resulting in greater transcription
  of FOXO and the upregulation of autophagy. (C) Wnt inhibition prevents its binding
  to FZD, resulting in the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β, which leads to increases
  in the ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin, thereby reducing its nuclear
  translocation and activating autophagy. (D1) High glucose and FFA concentrations
  cause mitochondrial damage and a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential.
  The degradation of PINK is reduced, resulting in the recruitment of parkin to the
  damaged mitochondria and the ubiquitination of mitochondrial membrane proteins.
  This process is recognized by P62, which binds to LC3. As a result, the damaged
  mitochondria are anchored to the autophagic vesicle membrane, which initiates mitophagy.
  (D2) In addition to the PINK/parkin pathway, the direct binding of FUNDC1 and BNIP3/NIX
  proteins to LC3 on the mitochondrial membrane also initiates mitophagy. (E) By binding
  to FZD5, Sfrp2 activates calcineurin to dephosphorylate TFEB. This causes greater
  nuclear translocation of TFEB, resulting in the transcription of autophagy genes
  and an increase in lysosomal activity, which promotes the formation and degradation
  of the autophagosome.
