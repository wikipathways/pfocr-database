caption: Bacterial two-component signal transduction system (TCS) mediated lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) modification pathway leading to polymyxin resistance. The PhoPQ gets activated
  after sensing the environmental cues (low Mg2+, Ca2+, CAMPS, and polymyxin, etc.)
  and in turn, activates the PmrA response regulator of the PmrAB TCS via PmrD protein.
  The PmrA activates several genes and operons that modify the LPS by adding positively
  charged PEtN and L-Ara4N. This modification ultimately restricts the interaction
  of the membrane with the polymyxin thereby avoiding its toxic effects. The PmrB
  sensor kinase also gets activated sensing cations such as Fe3+ and Al3+ as well
  as low pH conditions and can activate the cognate response regulator PmrA. This
  is a general mechanism of LPS modification via bacterial TCS that is reported in
  E. coli and S. Typhimurium. Variations to this general mechanism are observed in
  the case of other Gram-negative pathogens. As shown here in the case of K. pneumoniae,
  the PhoP also modulates the expression (shown as dashed arrows) of a membrane located
  small protein MgrB that can inhibit the activity of PhoQ sensor kinase. This negative
  feedback mechanism helps in the reset process of the whole pathway (see the text
  for details).
