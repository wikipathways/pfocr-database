caption: Molecular mechanism of angiogenesis and multicellular interaction during
  new vessel development. In response to stimulators such as VEGFs, vascular endothelial
  cells sprout from the basement membrane and migrate to the site of new vessel formation.
  The formation of tip and stalk cells is regulated by the VEGF-DLL4/NOTCH signaling
  pathway. The other stimulating molecules, such as PDGF, EGF, FGF, BMPs, and TGF-β,
  also cooperate to regulate pericytes and tip cells. ALK1/5, actin receptor-like
  kinase 1/5; BMP, bone morphogenic protein (yellow dots); DLL4, delta-like protein

  (green dot); PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; TGF-β, transforming
