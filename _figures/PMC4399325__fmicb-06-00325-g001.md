caption: Mode of actions of antifungal drugs commonly used against invasive and systemic
  Aspergillus fumigatus infection (). (A) Polyenes (in this case amphotericin B) bind
  to sterols, forming pores in the cell membrane. The formation of these pores leads
  to increased membrane permeability. Additionally, amphotericin B induces the accumulation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have multiple toxic effects on fungal cells;
  (B) Azoles (in this case voriconazole) inhibit the ERG11 enzyme thereby blocking
  the ergosterol biosynthesis. ERG11 catalyses the formation of 4,4-dimethylcholesta-8,14,24-trienol
  from lanosterol. The lack of ergosterol and the subsequent accumulation of lanosterol,
  results in high toxicity for the cell; (C) Echinocandins (in this case caspofungin)
  inhibit the β-1,3-glucan synthesis. As a response to the reduction of glucan content
  there is an increase in chitin biosynthesis.
