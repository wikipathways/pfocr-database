caption: Working model for AtNUDT7 protein, linking redox and oxidative cell death
  cycles. Biotic and abiotic stresses including suboptimal growing conditions lead
  to alterations in ascorbate, GSH and PNs. Changes in NADH induces AtNUDT7 and maybe
  crucial to restore the balance of NAD+:NADH redox couple. In the absence of AtNUDT7
  protein, NADH levels increase and trigger the accumulation of SA by an unknown mechanism
  and activate the SAR pathway, which in turn can antagonize ABA signaling. SA accumulation
  can trigger cell death via ROS, which in turn can inhibit the cell death promotive
  SA signal. Reduction in ATP levels in Atnudt7-1 may be due to constitutive activation
  of defense/stress signaling that in turn may lead to growth retardation.
