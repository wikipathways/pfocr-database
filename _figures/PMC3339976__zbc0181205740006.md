caption: Activation of NF-κB enhances GRK5 transcription and subsequent expression
  in myocytes. Cardiac hypertrophic agonists activating Gq-coupled receptors activate
  PKC (mimicked by PMA in our study), which can lead to activation of NF-κB through
  ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and degradation of IκBα. Activated NF-κB-p50 and
  NF-κB-p65 proteins in cytoplasm are now free to move into nucleus where they can
  bind to the promoter of GRK5. This activated protein complex may interact with other
  transcription factors and coactivators in the promoter region, thereby enhancing
  the transcription of GRK5. This event can be blocked by inhibition of activation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway, such as by antioxidants.
