caption: Potential pathway regulated by ING3. (A) GeneMANIA analysis revealed interaction
  between ING3 and a core protein of the JAK/STAT pathway, while Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis demonstrated that ING3 may regulate the JAK/STAT
  pathway. (B) The JAK/STAT pathway. (C) The JAK/STAT pathway is involved in ERBB
  signaling. (D) The JAK/STAT pathway is involved in breast cancer. ING3, inhibitor
  of growth 3.
