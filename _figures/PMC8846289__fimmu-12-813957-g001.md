caption: Immune reconstitution in MS after HSCT. Thymus-dependent T cell regeneration
  and immune regulation mediated by T and natural killer (NK) cells constitute the
  major identified pathways influencing immune reconstitution in patients with MS
  after HSCT. Thymus-derived CD4 T cells show a new, diverse repertoire and deletion
  of preexisting CD4 clones. CD8 T cells show an incomplete renewal of TCR repertoire
  suggesting expansion of residual or regenerated virus-specific clones. Increase
  of regulatory CD4+FOXP3+, CD8+CD57+T cells, and NK cells and eradication of pro-inflammatory
  Th17 and Th17-1 cells (MAIT) are observed after HSCT. NK cells induce necrotic cell
  death in Th17 and Th17-1 cells by the NKG2D pathway, while CD8+CD57+ cells suppress
  CD4+ T cell proliferation. Anergy is reported on CD8+ T cells that express high
  levels of CD57, a marker of senescence, and inhibitory effects are exerted by the
  immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-1. HSC, hematopoietic stem cells; CLP, common lymphocyte
  progenitor; NK regs, regulatory natural killer CD3-CD56hi. Figure created with BioRender.com.
