caption: The UNC-93B chaperone protein guides TLR7/8 and TLR9 trafficking from the
  ER to the endosome, where these receptors recognize viral ssRNA and CpG DNA, respectively.
  These TLRs recruit MyD88, IRAK4 and IRAK1, which activate TRAF3 and TRAF6. TRAF6,
  in turn, mediates the activation of NF-κB, leading to the induction of inflammatory
  cytokine genes, whereas TRAF3 activates IKKα, which catalyzes the phosphorylation
  of IRF7 and induces type I IFN genes (the classic MyD88-dependent pathway). After
  recognizing the viral dsRNA, UNC-93B-dependent endosomal TLR3 recruits the adapter
  molecule TRIF for the activation of TBK1 and IKKε, followed by the activation of
  IRF3 and upregulation of IFN production (the alternative TRIF-dependent pathway).
  IRF8 facilitates the activation of NF-κB and IRF7. RLRs, such as MDA5 and RIG-I
  recruit mitochondrial MAVS adapter molecules after the recognition of cytoplasmic
  viral dsRNA. Various cytoplasmic dsDNA sensors signal via the ER-located adapter
  molecule STING. The activation of these RNA and DNA signaling pathways results in
  the production of inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB activation, and IFN production
  via TBK1-IKKε-IRF activation. Secreted type I IFNs interact with their surfaceexpressed
  receptor IFNAR1/2, leading to the recruitment and activation of TYK2 and JAK1, which
  in turn phosphorylate and activate STAT1 and STAT2. STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 form complexes
  that interact with ISRE promoters for the induction of ISGs expression. Intracellular
  ISG15 is type I IFN-inducible and is involved in the USP18-dependent regulation
  47 of type I IFN and the prevention of type I IFN-dependent auto-inflammation. For
  all proteins 48 shadowed in grey mutations have been described.
