caption: 'Metabolic alterations in gastrocnemius muscle from pairwise comparisons
  between groups. Key metabolic pathways affected include glycine, serine, and threonine
  metabolism (blue box); pyruvate metabolism (purple box); taurine and hypotaurine
  metabolism (yellow box); and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism (red box).
  The TCA cycle (green dashed circle) is also included to highlight interconnected
  energy metabolism pathways. Dotted arrows represent multi-step reactions, while
  solid arrows indicate one-step reactions. Metabolic changes are indicated as follows:
  ↑/↓ in red—significant differences between the 7MC and 2MC groups; ↑/↓ in blue—significant
  differences between the 7ME and 7MC groups'
