caption: Proposed life cycle of hepatitis E virus (HEV). (1) Non-enveloped HEV (neHEV)
  particles bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the surface of liver
  cells and enter via an as yet unidentified specific cellular receptor; (2) Quasi-enveloped
  HEV (eHEV) particles enters liver cells via dynamin-dependent, clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis, which requires small GTPases Ras-related proteins Rab5 and Rab7; (3)
  The viral genomic RNA is released to cytosol after uncoating of capsid protein with
  an unknown process; (4) The viral genomic RNA directly serves as mRNA for ORF1 polyprotein
  translation, and also synthesizes a complementary negative-sense RNA to serve as
  a template for HEV replication; (5) The intermediate negative-sense RNA then serves
  as a template for transcription of full-length genomic as well as subgenomic mRNAs
  (sgRNAs); (6) More ORF1 polyproteins are translated from the full-length genomic
  RNA, and the ORF2 capsid protein and ORF3 multifunctional protein are translated
  from the sgRNAs; (7) ORF2 and ORF3 undergoes post-translational modifications such
  as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and palmitoylation; (8) ORF2 capsid protein self-assembles
  into virus-like particles (VLPs) and binds to newly synthesized positive-sense genomic
  RNA to form progeny HEV virions; (9) ORF3 regulates the host environment through
  interaction with a number of cellular proteins to promote viral replication and
  virion secretion. Specifically, ORF3 binds to TSG101 involved in the ESCRT pathway,
  facilitating the budding of nascent virions into multivesicular bodies, which fuse
  with the plasma membrane, and the virions are released from the liver cells either
  into the bloodstream as eHEV or in the bile duct as neHEV. The figure is created
