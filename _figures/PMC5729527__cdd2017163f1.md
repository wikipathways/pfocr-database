caption: Simplified version of the key factors within the Hippo signaling pathway.
  The core of the Hippo pathway consists of MST1 and MST2, members of the Ste20 group
  of protein kinases; LATS1 and LATS2, members of the AGC kinase family, as well as
  their adaptor proteins Salvador (WW45) and MOB1, respectively. Activated LATS1/2
  kinases phosphorylate the transcriptional co-factors YAP and TAZ on different sites,
  leading to their inactivation by cytoplasmic sequestering and proteasome-mediated
  degradation. TF, transcription factor
