caption: Metabolic routes towards biopolyester synthesis. Triangles depict targets
  for inhibitors enabling biopolyester synthesis. The biosynthetic pathway of PHB,
  a scl-PHA starts when two molecules of acetyl-Co-A get condensed to form acetoacetyl-CoA
  with the help of the enzyme 3-ketothiolase. The acetoacetyl-CoA is then reduced
  to (R)-3- hydroxybutyryl-CoA which is catalyzed by (R)-specific acetoacetyl-CoA
  reductase (Rehm )
