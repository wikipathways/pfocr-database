caption: 'The mTOR cascade and its regulators. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  combines with protein binding partners to form mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). The downstream
  substrates of mTORC1 signalling include ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic
  initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1). Rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 signalling
  by binding with FK506 binding protein 1 A 12 kDa (FKBP12). Three pathways converge
  to regulate mTORC1 signalling. Hamartin (TSC1), tuberin (TSC2) and TBC1 domain family
  member 7 (TBC1D7) form a protein complex that indirectly inhibits mTORC1 signalling
  via Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb). (A) Growth factors stimulate phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K) to trigger phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) to phosphorylate
  and activate Akt. TSC2 is repressed by Akt activation, which has a disinhibitory
  effect on mTORC1 signalling. Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is a negative
  regulator of the PI3K-Akt pathway. (B) The energy-sensing arm is regulated by the
  STE20-related kinase adaptor alpha (STRADα) and liver kinase B (LKB) complex. In
  response to depleted ATP, the STRADα/LKB complex inhibits mTORC1 signalling by activating
  TSC2 via phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK). (C)
  The amino acid-sensing pathway is regulated by GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity

  Egl-10, and Pleckstrin domain-containing protein 5 (DEPDC5); nitrogen permease regulator-like
  2 and 3 (NPRL2, NPRL3). The GATOR2 complex inhibits GATOR1 in response to increasing
  amino acid levels, resulting in mTORC1 disinhibition, facilitating pathways for
  cell growth. When amino acid levels are low GATOR1 directly inhibits mTORC1 activity.
