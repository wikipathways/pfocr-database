caption: 'Map of central carbon pathway of glycolysis, TCA cycle, gluconeogenesis,
  glycerol assimilation, Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), and several aminoacids pathways,
  was constructed following EcoCyc Database information including plots with the relativized
  metabolite values of M4∆gnd and M4-∆iclR strains respect to the M4 values at 24
  and 48 h after inoculation with three replicates. In green bars are represented
  the M4-∆gnd respect to M4 values at 24 h (dark green bars) and at 48 h (light green
  bars). In grey bars are represented the M4-∆iclR respect to M4 values at 24 h (dark
  grey bars) and at 48 h (light grey bars) (n = 3). Absence of bars in the graph indicates
  that there are non-statistically significant differences between the M4-∆gnd and
  M4-∆iclR mutants respect to that obtained in M4 strain. The asterisks (*) indicate
  there is statistically significant differences between M4-∆gnd an M4-∆iclR. The
  red cross (X) indicates the blocking of the pathways by the gene deletion in M4
  (1), M4-∆gnd (2), M4-∆iclR (3), M4-∆gnd∆mtlD and M4-∆iclR∆mtlD (4) and M4-∆iclR∆otsA
  (5) mutant strains. The abbreviations for the intermediate metabolites used in this
  figure are described as follows: Glyc, glycerol; DHA, dihydroxyacetone; Glyc-3P,
  glycerol 3-Phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
