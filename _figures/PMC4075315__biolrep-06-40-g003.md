caption: Photosystem I (PSI) receives electrons from photosystem II via plastocyanin
  (PC) and directs them to ferredoxin (Fd), which give them either to the ferredoxin
  NADP+ oxidoreductase (FNR) for NADPH production or directly to the two P450 enzymes
  (P450s). The two membrane-bound P450s hydroxylate the substrate in two consecutive
  steps, and this is followed by glycosylation by a soluble glucosyltransferase (GT)
  to form the final stable product. The novel aspect of this approach is that photosynthetic
  reducing power, in the form of reduced ferredoxin, is used directly by a novel biosynthetic
  pathway to produce the product without the need for numerous energy consuming metabolic
  conversions.
