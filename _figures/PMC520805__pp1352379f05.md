caption: Summary of gene expression analysis with the mini-array system. The tetrapyrrole
  biosynthetic pathway is depicted. Genes investigated in this study are shown by
  blue arrows in the pathway. For each gene, the NE values of 3-d-old etiolated seedlings
  (black bar) and 3-week-old seedlings grown under 12-h light/12-h dark regime (green
  bar) are shown. Results of gene clustering at the onset of greening, and rhythmic
  growth are shown on the right.
