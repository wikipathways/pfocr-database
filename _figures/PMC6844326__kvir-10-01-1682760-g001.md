caption: Overview of leucine biosynthesis in A. fumigatus. As shown in S. cerevisiae
  [], 2-ketoisovalerate, a common step of the biosynthesis of valine and leucine,
  is converted by LeuC (α-IPM synthase) to α-IPM. LeuA (α-IPM isomerase) produces
  β-IPM, which is subsequently converted by Leu2A (dehydrogenase), spontaneous decarboxylation
  and Bat2 (BCAA aminotransferase) to leucine. The biosynthesis is feedback-inhibited
  via blocking of LeuC enzymatic activity by the end-product leucine []. The intermediate
  α-IPM was shown to posttranslationally activate LeuB in S. cerevisiae and A. nidulans
  [,]. The results of this study indicate that α-IPM also activates LeuB in A. fumigatus
  including the regulation of BCAA encoding genes, gdhA, and genes involved in adaptation
  to iron starvation.
