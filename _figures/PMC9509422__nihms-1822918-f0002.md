caption: Carnosic acid (CA), which can be synthesized or extracted from Rosmarinus
  officinalis, is a catechol-type pro-electrophilic drug (PED). Oxidative activation
  of the pro-electrophilic state to the electrophilic state is accomplished by electron
  acceptors, including ROS. The resulting quinone form then reacts with cysteine thiols.
  For this reaction, a cysteine thiol triggers nucleophilic attack of the electrophilic
  compound to form an adduct. Carnosic acid thus transforms from a non-active (pro-electrophilic)
  state to an active (electrophilic) state under oxidative stress. The outcome is
  that carnosic acid is activated only in tissue undergoing oxidative and inflammatory
  stress, and in turn then protects the tissue from such stress, as occurs in neurodegenerative
  disorders such as AD. This protection is achieved by activation of the KEAP1/NRF2
  pathway by the quinone form of carnosic acid. The NRF2/KEAP1 pathway represents
  one of the major cellular defense systems against oxidative stress and inflammatory
  processes. NRF2 is a transcription factor that induces phase II anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory
  enzymes. Under normal conditions, KEAP1 protein binds to NRF2 and functions as an
  adaptor protein for cullin 3 (encoded by Cul3 in humans) E3 ubiquitin ligase, which
  polyubiquitinates NRF2. Consequently, NRF2 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the
  proteasome. Hence, transcriptional activity of NRF2 is potently inhibited under
  normal conditions. KEAP1 contains critical cysteine thiols that react with CA after
  electrophilic conversion, as described above. This reaction prevents KEAP1 from
  inducing ubiquitination and degradation of NRF2. NRF2 thus dissociates from the
  cytoplasmic complex with KEAP1, enters the nucleus, and binds to AREs (anti-oxidant
  response elements) in the promoters of target phase II genes, which encode a coordinated
  system of anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory enzymes. These proteins include enzymes
  that generate the major cellular antioxidant, glutathione (GSH). Thus, NRF2 activators
  protect various cell types including neurons via chemical redox regulation. In the
  brain, activation of NRF2 occurs mainly in astrocytes and microglial cells (adapted
  from ).
