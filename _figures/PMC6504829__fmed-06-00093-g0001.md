caption: Pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia with emphasis on the role of HIF
  isoforms in remodeling. The right upper branch of this vessel depicts vasoconstriction
  in acute hypoxia, occurring due to alterations in redox and NO signaling and release
  of vasoactive mediators. The lower branch indicates remodeling in the context of
  sustained hypoxic exposure and illustrates HIF-dependent processes revealed by tissue-specific
  deletion of HIF-isoforms in endothelial cells (HIF-2α) or smooth muscle cells (HIF-1α).
  Below the vessel, a schematic shows degradation of hydroxylated HIF-α subunits in
  normoxia via the von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) pathway. In hypoxia or following treatment
  with prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (PHDi), HIF-α stabilization and dimerization
  with HIF-β occurs, leading to transcription of target genes. HIF inhibitors (HIFi)
  with specific activity against HIF-2α are in clinical development.
