caption: Integration of c-Abl-p38-p53-Mdm2 signaling in Met-triggered cell survival
  and tumorigenesis. Activated Met, following its overexpression or HGF stimulation,
  acts on c-Abl to trigger cell survival and tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, c-Abl
  leads to p53 phosphorylation on Ser392 by p38-MAPK, leading to Mdm2 upregulation.
  The functional consequence of this mechanism is genetically and pharmacologically
  demonstrated. The arrow indicates a relationship between the identified components
  in the pathway. Additional signaling intermediates and partners remain to be identified
