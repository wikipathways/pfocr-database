caption: αvβ8 integrins regulate TGFβ bioavailability in the immune system. TGFβ is
  produced by cells as an inactive complex and must be activated in order to bind
  to its receptor and signal. (A) Transcription of TGFβ produces a homodimeric propeptide
  containing the active TGFβ molecule (blue) and the Latent Associated Peptide (LAP;
  in red). In the endoplasmic reticulum, association with the LTBP or GARP ‘chaperone’
  proteins (green) enhances proper folding of the latent complex. In the Golgi apparatus,
  LAP-TGFβ is cleaved by Furin-like enzymes, but active TGFβ stays non-covalently
  bound to the LAP and forms the Small Latency Complex or latent TGFβ () (B) Upon
  secretion, latent TGFβ is sequestered to the ECM through binding of the LTBP or
  anchored at the plasma membrane by GARP. (C) Binding of αv integrins to the RGD
  tripeptide motif in the LAP induces the dissociation of TGFβ from the LAP via the
  recruitment of metalloproteases such as MMP14 (). Alternatively, conformational
  changes can allow TGFβ binding to its receptor without the release of active TGFβ
  (). (D) TGFβ binding to the TGFβ receptor induces signaling via the canonical phospho-Smad
  (pSmad) pathway, or through the alternative MAPK, Small GTPases and PIP3K pathways.
