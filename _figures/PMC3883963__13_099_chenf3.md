caption: HMGB1-TLR4 signaling mediates liver I/R injury. HMGB1 is an early mediator
  of injury and inflammation in liver I/R, and TLR4 is the major receptor that is
  involved in the process by which the JNK MAPK/NF-κB pathway is activated. The release
  of HMGB1 in liver I/R requires TLR4 but not CD14. Different strategies of HMGB1-TLR4
  pathway inhibition as indicated have been shown to reduce liver I/R injury.
