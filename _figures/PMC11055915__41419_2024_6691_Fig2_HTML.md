caption: A The HSP family assists the amino acid chain to fold into the correct three-dimensional
  structure. B The core protein Cdc48 of MitoTAD and its adapter Ubx2 continuously
  monitor the TOM channel and remove the precursor proteins that block the channel.
  C In the MAD signaling pathway, the Doa1-Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex and Ubx2 recognize
  and remove ubiquitinated proteins on the mitochondrial surface. D Pdr3 mediates
  mitoCPR, and recognizes and transfers mitochondrial protein precursors on the mitochondrial
  surface to proteasome degradation. E UPRmt maintains protein homeostasis in the
  mitochondrial matrix. F Matrix protease ClpP degrades redundant misfolded proteins,
  and the product is transported into the nucleus to stimulate the transcription of
  the chaperone gene again. G Mitochondrial membranes encapsulate some proteins to
  form MDVs, which are transported to peroxisomes or lysosomes for degradation. The
