caption: Representation of the l-lysine biosynthesis pathway in UniPathway. The l-lysine
  biosynthesis pathway is specialized in two chemically defined pathway variants (the
  DAP and AAA pathways) by an ‘IsA’ relationship. The DAP pathway is composed of seven
  linear subpathways (ULS) and the AAA pathway is composed of three linear subpathways
  (which are ‘PartOf' their respective pathway variants). Colored boxes, using the
  same color code as in the Supplementary figures for comparisons, indicate the subpathways.
  The right part of the figure presents an exploded view of the first linear subpathway
  (ULS) of the AAA pathway, which is composed of four Enzymatic reactions (UERs).
