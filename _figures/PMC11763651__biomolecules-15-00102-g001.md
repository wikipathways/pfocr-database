caption: Biosynthesis of BH4 and genetic diseases due to BH4 deficiency. (Green enclosure)
  De novo or direct pathway of BH4 biosynthesis. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is enzymatically
  converted to BH4 by the successive enzymic actions of GTP cyclohydrolase (GTPCH1),
  6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydrobiopterin synthase (6PTPS or PTPS), and sepiapterin reductase
  (SR). Autosomal dominant (AD) and autosomal recessive (AR) mutations of the gtpch1
  gene cause BH4 deficiency via the de novo biogenesis pathway. PTPS deficiency and
  SR mutations are two other AR traits for BH4 deficiency. HPA = hyperphenylalaninemia,
  PKU = phenylketonuria, HVA = homovanillic acid. (Purple enclosure) Salvage pathway
  of BH4 biosynthesis. In this metabolic pathway, sepiapterin is first converted to
  7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2) by sepiapterin reductase (SR) and then BH2 is converted
  to BH4 by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). BH4 is non-enzymically converted to BH2,
  contributing to the generation of reactive oxygen species. (Orange enclosure) Regenerative
  pathway. In the regenerative pathway, BH4 is regenerated in two reactions. BH4 is
  first oxidized to BH4-hydroperoxide and then converted to pterin-4a-carbinolamine
  during catalysis by aromatic amino acid hydroxylases such as tyrosine, phenylalanine,
  and tryptophan hydroxylases. Pterin-4a-carbinolamine is then converted to q-BH2
  (Quinonoid BH2) by pterin-4a-carbinol- amine dehydratase (PCD) and then re-cycled
  back to BH4 by dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR). PCD deficiency (AR) causes the
  upregulation of the pterin metabolite primapterin and HPA. DHPR deficiency (AR)
  causes the loss of HVA, serotonin, and HPA. The flowchart of the BH4 metabolism
  is illustrated as described in Chapter 6 of the book “Nitric Oxide (2nd edition)”
