caption: After stimulating goblet cells, the bacterial TLR ligand activates the intracellular
  signaling pathway, which in turn activates Myd88, ROS synthesis, and Nlrp6, triggering
  the exocytosis of the complex and the secretion of MUC2 by adjacent goblet cells.
  The goblet cells that undergo non-specific endocytosis are killed and expelled to
  the lumen.
