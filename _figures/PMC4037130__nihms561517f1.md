caption: Active (farnesylated, membrane-bound and GTP-bound) RAS modulates a number
  of signalling pathways. Oncogenic RAS mutations tend to lock RAS in its GTP-bound
  state, resulting in constitutive RAS signalling. The major RAS effector pathways
  are shown. The two best-studied pathways that are activated by RAS are the RAF–MEK–MAPK
  signalling cascade and the PI3K–AKT pathway. The RAF–MEK–MAPK pathway ultimately
  activates the ETS family of transcription factors, which induce multiple genes that
  promote cell cycle progression and cell migration. Likewise, AKT phosphorylates
  multiple cellular proteins, leading to the inhibition of several tumour suppressors
  (such as p27, p53, tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1), TSC2 and BCL-2 antagonist of cell
  death (BAD)) or leading to the activation of several oncogene products. RAS also
  activates other small GTPases such as RALA and RALB, which have recently been shown
  to mediate RAS transformation in human pancreatic tumours, for example. Farnesyltransferase
  inhibitors (FTIs) were originally developed to block the function of RAS. However,
  as numerous studies in vitro and in vivo have shown, their antitumour activity is
  not correlated to the mutation status of KRAS isoforms. This suggests that the antitumour
  activity of FTIs relies on blocking the activity of other prenylated proteins. However,
  the inhibition of RAS protein function may still be important, particularly for
  tumours with mutant HRAS and tumours addicted to wild-type RAS. CDC42, cell division
