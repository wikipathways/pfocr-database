caption: Diagrammatic illustrations of CCN1 signaling involved pancreatic cancer progression
  via CCN1-Notch1-SHh axes. Our studies postulated that CCN1-mediated pancreatic carcinogenesis
  is regulated via integrin-αvβ3-Notch-1-SHh signaling pathway in autocrine-paracrine
  manner. Firstly, Jagged1 is activated by CCN1 which in turn releases an intracellular
  domain of Notch (ICD) from the membrane into the cytoplasm. CCN1 inhibits the proteasomal
  degradation process to keep Notch-1(ICD) stable and active in pancreatic cancer
  cells. CCN1 recruits active ICD into the nucleus to regulate transcriptional complex
  (TC) for the induction of SHh. SHh binds with its receptor 12-span-transmembrane
  protein Patched (Ptch1) and relieves another 7-span-transmembrane protein receptor,
  Smoothened (Smo) inhibition, which in turn induces the signal transduction pathway
  by activating the nuclear translocation of transcription factor Gli1 protein. Finally,
  the SHh-Ptch1-Smo-Gli1 signaling pathway promotes pancreatic cancer growth and progression,
  cell motility, EMT/Stemness and cell proliferation.
