caption: MT-mediated regulation of endothelial barrier function during ALI/ARDS. An
  excessive ROS production in response to injurious stimuli activates HDAC6 by phosphorylation.
  In turn, activated HDAC6 deacetylates tubulin causing the destabilization of MT
  and release of Rho-specific GEF-H1. The activation of Rho signaling pathway induces
  cytoskeletal remodeling with increased actomyosin contractility and stress fibers
  formation that leads to an increase in endothelial permeability, a trigger for ALI
  and ARDS. Anti-oxidants and inhibition of Rho as well as HDAC6 presents points of
  potential therapeutic interventions to prevent endothelial dysfunction-derived lung
  injuries. Dephosphorylation of stathmin by thrombin also contributes to MT destabilization
  and subsequent endothelial dysfunction. Conversely, the formation of a protein complex
  between SOCS and MT plus-end-tracking proteins CLIP-170 and CLASP2 exerts anti-inflammatory
  effects on EC.
