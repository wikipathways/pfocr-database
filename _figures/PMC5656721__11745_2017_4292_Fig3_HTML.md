caption: Interplay in the synthesis and actions of the 2-acylglycerols and ethanolamides
  derived from ARA, DHA and EPA. The major pathway for AEA production begins with
  N-acyltransferase (NAT) transferring ARA from phosphatidylcholine (ARA-PC) to phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) to generate N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NArPE), which is followed
  by hydrolysis by N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine-selective phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD)
  to produce AEA. Further pathways include NAPE deacylation by the α/β-hydrolase domain
  containing 4 (ABHD4) and either the glycerophosphoarachidonoylethanolamide produced
  (GP-NAPE) cleaved by phosphodiesterase (PDE) to produce AEA or lyso-NAPE is hydrolysed
  by lyso-NAPE-phospholipase D (PLD) directly to AEA. NAPE can also be hydrolysed
  by phospholipase C (NAPE-PLC) to generate phospho-anandamide (PAEA), which is dephosphorylated
  to AEA by phosphatases such as protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN22). DHEA and EPEA
  production from phospholipid bound DHA and EPA appears to share the same pathways.
  Synthesis of 2-AG occurs from phosphatidylinositol-bound ARA (ARA-PI) via phospholipase
  C-β (PLCβ) and production of an ARA-diacylglycerol (DAG), which is hydrolysed by
  diacylglycerol lipases-α to produce 2-AG. Further pathways include dephosphorylation
  of 2-AG-lysophosphatidic acid (2-AG-LPA) by LPA phosphatase (2-LPA-P) or via phospholipase
  A1 (PLA1) converting PI to 2-arachidonoyl-lyso PI (2-AG-LPI) and then to 2-AG by
  lyso phospholipase C (lyso-PLC). The pathways of 2-DPG and 2-EPG production are
  currently unknown. 2-AG and AEA act at CB1 and CB2 receptors, GPR55 and PPAR, with
  AEA additionally acting at TRPV-1 (shown in grey). Dietary DHA and EPA enrichment
  decreases phospholipid ARA and increases phospholipid DHA and EPA, and favours production
  of DHA and EPA-derived endocannabinoids, whereas acute DHA and EPA treatment in
  vitro increases 2-AG. DHA and EPA also regulate CB1, CB2 TRPV-1 and PPAR receptor
  activity and levels. For detailed explanations, refer to the text
