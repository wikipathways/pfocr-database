caption: Phenolic metabolic pathways and associated network diagrams. A Modulation
  of phenolic biosynthesis pathway genes during walnut Endopleura. B Co-expression
  analysis of structural genes and metabolites of the phenolic acid biosynthetic pathway
  in walnut at different developmental stages. Blue nodes represent metabolites and
  green nodes represent genes. The solid red line represents a positive correlation
  and the dashed green line shows a negative correlation
