caption: Signaling pathways leading to retinal growth cone collapse by lysophosphatidic
  acid (LPA).Schematic representation of the cell signaling pathways demonstrated
  by Fincher et al. (2014) to lead to growth cone collapse by LPA and S1P on embryonic
  chicken retinal axons. Binding of LPA (or S1P, not shown) to G-protein coupled receptors
  activates the G12/13pathway (bottom) which leads to RhoA and Rho kinase (ROCK) activation
  proceeding to myelin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylation which leads to growth
  cone collapse, a well-established pathway. Furthermore, Fincher et al. (2014) showed
  that growth cone collapse was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin, which blocks
  Gi. Gi is known to activate a variety of cell pathways, including Ras and Rac, as
  well as inhibiting adenlyyl cyclase (AC), lowering cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) levels; cAMP can activate protein kinase A (PKA). Although the pathway of
  growth cone collapse via Gi is not established, the dashed lines from Rac or cAMP
  and PKA indicate probable mechanisms that Gi could effect growth cone collapse.
