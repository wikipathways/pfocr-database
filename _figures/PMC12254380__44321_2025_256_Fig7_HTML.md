caption: Transitory NRF2 activation in OLK tissues upregulates the WNT signaling pathway,
  increasing cell keratinization and countering PDT-induced high oxidative stress,
  thereby reinforcing the epithelial barrier and collectively promoting PDT resistance
  (left panel). Nevertheless, the NRF2 inhibitor brusatol has been demonstrated to
  suppress aberrant NRF2 signaling, block WNT pathway transduction, inhibit cell keratinization
  and restore cellular sensitivity to cytotoxic ROS, thereby increasing susceptibility
  to PDT treatment (right panel)
