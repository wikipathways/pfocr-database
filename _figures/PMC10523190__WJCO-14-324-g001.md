caption: 'Effects of excess copper and copper deficiency in cancer. Four copper-related
  pathways with cancer inhibition effects are described. Elesclomol mediates the entry
  of Cu2+ into the mitochondria and causes reactive oxygen species accumulation. Flavonoids
  interfere with copper ion oxidation and reduction, inducing mitochondrial apoptosis
  pathway activation. Copper diethyldithiocarbamate can inhibit proteasome and result
  in endoplasmic reticulum stress. Copper deficiency can suppress the proliferation
  and migration of endothelial cells and the formation of connexin, bridling tumor
  angiogenesis. TCA: Tricarboxylic acid; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; FDX1: Ferredoxin
  1; MTF1: Metallothionein; CTR1: Consolidation tumor ratio-1.'
