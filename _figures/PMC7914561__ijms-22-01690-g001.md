caption: Methionine cycle. Homocysteine (HCy) is biosynthesized from methionine by
  S- adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAMS), methyltransferase (MT) and S-adenosylhomocysteine
  hydrolase (SAHH) in sequential steps. Methionine is activated by condensation with
  adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to yield the ubiquitous methyl donor SAM, which is
  transformed into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by donating its methyl group to the
  substrates of methylation reactions. SAH gives rise to HCy in a reversible reaction
  that favors SAH over HCy production. SAH is a competitive inhibitor of methylation
  reactions, and rapid elimination of adenosine and HCy is required to prevent its
  accumulation. HCy may be remethylated to methionine by methionine synthase (MS),
  which requires folate and vitamin B12, and betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase
  (BHMT), which requires betaine, a metabolite of choline. Remethylation of HCy via
  MS requires 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), which is derived from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
  (5,10-MTHF) in a reaction catalyzed by MTHFR with vitamin B2 as a cofactor. 5-MTHF
  is converted into tetrahydrofolate (THF) after it donates its methyl group, and
  THF is converted into 5,10-MTHF by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) with vitamin
  B6 as a cofactor to complete the folate cycle. HCy may enter the transsulfuration
  pathway, and adenosine can reach its metabolic process.
