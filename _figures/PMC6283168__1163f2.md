caption: 'Triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis in Drosophila: biochemistry and main regulatory
  pathways. Fatty acids (FAs) derived from the diet or synthesized de novo by Acetyl-CoA-carboxylase
  (ACC) and the FA synthase complex (FASN) are activated to FA-CoA by Acsl, and are
  esterified consecutively by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPATs) (possibly
  Gpat4 or Mino) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and by LPA acyltransferases (possibly
  Agpat3, Agpat2) to phosphatidic acid (PA). Lipin dephosphorylates PA to diacylglycerol
  (DAG), which is further esterified by DAG acyltransferases (Mdy and possibly Dgat2)
  to TAG and stored in lipid droplets (LDs). Acyltransferases show differential localization
  to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or LDs, respectively. Lipin shuttling between
  the cytoplasm and the nucleus is controlled by the Tor kinase, which in turn is
  subject to insulin pathway regulation via Akt under feeding conditions. Lipin is
  also under the inhibitory control of Torsin. The transcription factor sterol regulatory
  element-binding protein (SREBP) promotes FA-CoA synthesis via positive control of
  ACC, FASN, and Acsl expression. The canonical pathway of SREBP activation requires
  its interaction with the escort factor SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP),
  and its proteolytic processing via Golgi-resident S1P and S2P. SREBP activation
  is promoted by target of rapamycin (Tor) kinase and inhibited by the membrane lipid
  PE, which is synthesized from DAG by Pcyt2. Nuclear Lipin may also inhibit SREBP
  activity. Under fasting conditions, mdy expression is suppressed in a Ca2+-dependent
  manner under the control of adipokinetic hormone (Akh) signaling. Akh receptor (AkhR)
  activation by Akh triggers store-operated entry of extracellular Ca2+ via small
  G proteins, IP3 signaling under the control of phospholipase C, and ER Ca2+ store
  depletion, which promotes interaction of Stim with the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel
  Olf186-F to result in extracellular Ca2+ influx until the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum
  Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) restores ER Ca2+ levels. The proximal mechanisms of Ca2+-dependent
  mdy repression are currently unknown. See main text for details and definitions
  of abbreviations. Proteins shown in faded green with gray lettering are based on
  homology-based activity predictions and await experimental validation. Note the
  antagonistic action of the lipoanabolic insulin/Tor pathway (in magenta) under feeding
  vs. the lipocatabolic Akh pathway (in blue) under fasting conditions.'
