caption: Construction and optimization of DMP biosynthetic pathway. A) Designed synthetic
  module for DMP formation. B) Round 1 shows whole‐cell biocatalysis for DMP production
  by strains with different cofactor recycling systems. Reaction mixture contained
  200 × 10−3m l‐threonine and 1 × 10−3 m NAD+ in 0.5 m Tris‐HCl buffer (pH 8.0). 200 ×
  10−3m pyruvate was added for LDH recycling reactions. 200 × 10−3m pyruvate and 300 × 10−3 m
  ammonia were added for AlaDH recycling reactions. C) Round 2 shows the DMP production
  of strains harboring different combinations of Ectdh and nox. Reaction mixture contained
  500 × 10−3m l‐threonine and 2 × 10−3m NAD+ in 0.5 m Tris‐HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The
  bioconversion reactions were performed at 30 °C on 200 rpm shaker for 24 h. All
  plots show mean ± SD for n = 3 replicates.
