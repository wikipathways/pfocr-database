caption: Pathway analysis of the RT2 Profiler Array gene expression data using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. The red colored circles represent relative increases
  in expression of that gene in the infected chicken embryo lung tissues versus control
  and green circles represent downregulation. Dashed lines indicate direct relationships
  and solid lines indicate indirect relationships. The blue lines represent inhibition,
  orange represents activation, and yellow represents inconsistent findings with downstream
  molecules. (A) Networks associated with diseases and functions of the differentially
  expressed genes from the profiler array (Infectious Diseases, Cell-mediated Immune
  Responses, Lymphoid Tissue Development, and Organismal Injury) were mapped together.
  (B) The six highly upregulated and interconnected genes (Mx1, CCL5, TLR3, STAT1,
  IL-8, and IRF1) from the array were selected for future analysis. (C) Filtering
  of the data to include only these six genes revealed diseases and functions relevant
  to NDV infection, including NDV infection, Paramyxovirus replication, RNA virus
  infection and replication, susceptibility to infection, lung infection, Measles
  virus infection and replication, and Influenza A virus infection (all p-values <
  0.0001).
