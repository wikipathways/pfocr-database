caption: The LOX pathway. The dioxygenation of PUFAs by 9- and 13-LOX activity forms
  precursors for important phytooxylipins with functions in plant defense, wound signaling,
  senescence and fruit ripening. The formation of fruit esters from 13-hydroperoxide
  occurs by the HPL pathway and the action of AAT. AAT, alcohol acyl-CoA transferase;
  ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; AOS, allene oxid synthase; DES, divinyl ether synthase;
  HPL, hydroperoxide lyase; POX, peroxygenase, PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid. Adapted
  from Feussner and Wasternack.
