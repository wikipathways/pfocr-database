caption: Mechanical properties of the ECM are sensed by the adipocyte via a range
  of membrane-bound mechanosensors, including integrins, syndecan 4 (SDC4), focal
  adhesion (FA) complex proteins, and Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the principal component
  of caveolae in adipocytes. These mechanosensors dynamically regulate the transfer
  of extracellular/intracellular mechanical signals inside/outside the cell. ECM-mediated
  activation of the FA protein vinculin (Vinc), talin (Tal), and focal adhesion kinase
  (FAK) produces downstream signaling events regulating the activity of Rho family
  member A (RhoA). RhoA activation, which is also mediated by increased cell-level
  stiffness and SDC4-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase,
  leads to activation of the Ras homologous (Rho)/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling
  pathway and a consequent increase in tension of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. This
  promotes the nuclear translocation of the transcriptional factors Yes-associated
  protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) resulting
  in transcriptional control of genes that sustain ECM homeostasis and adipocyte survival.
  The increased cellular tension also induces the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α
  (TNFα), which in turn, stimulates lipolysis through activation of cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase A (PKA) and its phosphorylation of perilipin-1 (PLIN1) and hormone-sensitive
  lipase (HSL). The interaction between phosphorylated PLIN1 and HSL allows HSL to
  translocate from the cytosol to the lipid droplet where it promotes lipolysis. Activation
  of lipolysis may, in turn, counterbalance the adipocyte hypertrophy-induced cellular
  tension.
