caption: Schematic role of HCO4− in the redox regulation of PTEN and cell signaling.
  The stimulation of RTK induces the assembly of PI3K to phosphorylate PIP2 to PIP3,
  subsequently activating the AKT signaling cascade. PTEN can negatively modulate
  this pathway. During this condition, H2O2, produced through the activity of NOXs,
  oxidizes PTEN. In the cellular environment, PTEN oxidation can be impaired and reversed
  by Trx/TrxR/NADPH reducing systems. HCO3− can also be generated through the activity
  of CAs. In the presence of HCO3− together with H2O2, a higher reactive oxidant HCO4−
  is formed. Hence, HCO4− is supposed to accelerate the oxidative inactivation of
  PTEN, consequently increase the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and, as a result, promote
  cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation in physiological processes
