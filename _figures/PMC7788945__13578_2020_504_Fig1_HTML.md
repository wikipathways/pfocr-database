caption: IL-22R downstream signal transduction pathways. IL-22 binds to IL-22R1, then
  IL-10R2 binds to the IL22-IL22R1 complex, which activates a cascade of downstream
  signal transduction pathways. IL-22 stimulation activates JAK1 and TYK2, such as
  the MAPK pathways (i.e., ERK1/2, MEK1/2, JNK, and p38 kinase depending on the cell
  type), STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. Among them, STAT3 is the main activated pathway.
  The above signalling pathways are phosphorylated depending on the IL-22 stimulation.
  Several mediators are produced after STAT3 phosphorylation, including inflammatory
  factors, tissue repair molecules, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides, which are
  involved in many diverse processes in innate immunity and adaptive immunity at barrier
  surfaces (i.e., skin, intestine and lung). Thus, IL-22 can regulate the process
  of inflammation, tissue repair, chemotaxis and antimicrobial peptides production
  depending on the mediators generated and the tissues where it is expressed
