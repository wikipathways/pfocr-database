caption: 'Model of Kreb''s cycle used to determine relative flux rates through acetyl-CoA
  synthetase (ACS), pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH), pyruvate carboxylase (PC),
  and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Labeled substrate originates from exogenous[U-13C6]glucose.
  Unlabeled substratesoriginate from exogenous glutamine, leucine, and from endogenous
  sources feeding the substrate pools designated as “fat”, and “other pyruvate”. Malic
  enzyme (ME) provides one possible pathway for cycling of anaplerotic flux of pyruvate
  via PC. Anaplerotic entry of glutamate (from glutamine) is at the level of α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG) by the action of GDH, calculated asYS by “tcacalc”. Acetyl-CoA is derived
  from either fat via ACS, or pyruvate via the PDH. Pyruvate can be derived from [U-13C]glucose
  (labeled pyr: filled circles), or from endogenous or cycling via Malic enzyme (unlabeled
  pyr: open circles). All fluxes are normalized by“tcacalc”to citrate synthase (CS)
  flux.'
