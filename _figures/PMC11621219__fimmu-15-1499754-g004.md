caption: Immunostimulants regulating adaptive immune responses by activating TLRs.
  Membrane-associated TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, as well as endosomal membrane-type TLRs
  3 and 9, form either homologous or heterodimeric complexes upon interaction with
  specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). With the exception of TLR3,
  which operates through the TRIF signaling pathway, the majority of these receptors
  activate downstream immune responses via the MyD88 pathway. The engagement of PAMPs
  leads to the enhancement of antigen presentation by stimulating the corresponding
  TLRs and their associated signaling pathways, resulting in the production of interferons,
  cytokines, and chemokines, thereby ultimately bolstering the adaptive immune response
