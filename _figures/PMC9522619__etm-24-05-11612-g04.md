caption: 'Flavones including Apigenin, Luteolin, Baicalein, Chrysin, Scutellarin,
  Tangeretin, Nobiletin and Orientin act on BLCA through various mechanisms such as
  apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and ROS activation. Apigenin is found to inhibit GSH
  production and promote ferroptosis. Additionally, Apigenin can inhibit UPAR, AP-1,
  or PI3K/AKT and NF-κB pathways to promote apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and ROS activation.
  Luteolin can inhibit mTOR and promote P21 expression to promote apoptosis and cell
  cycle arrest of BLCA cells. Tangeretin causes mitochondrial dysfunction and promotes
  the expression of apoptosis genes such as cytochrome C and cleaved caspase-3/9.
  Chrysin inhibits oncogenes such as SRC PLK1 HOXB3 and STAT3 expression. Baicalein
  can promote cell cycle arrest by regulating genes such as Cyclin B 1and D1. It also
  promotes the expression of cleaved caspase-3/9 and the occurrence of ferroptosis.
  Scutellarin can inhibit tumor EMT progression by inhibiting PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways.
  Nobiletin has also been found to inhibit the activation of ER stress and apoptosis
  by inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway. Orientin can promote apoptosis of BLCA cells by
  inhibiting Hedgehog and NF-KB pathways. The 2D structures of the compounds were
  obtained from the Pubchem database. Apigenin: PubChemIdentifier: CID 5280443 URL
