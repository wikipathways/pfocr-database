caption: IPA analysis revealed that ivermectin was associated with production of ROS
  and energy metabolism. a Disease and function analysis of ivermectin based on IPA
  software. b Biomolecular networks analysis of ivermectin based on IPA software showed
  that ivermectin regulated PKM. c Biomolecular networks analysis of ivermectin based
  on IPA software showed that ivermectin regulated OGDHL. d Biomolecular networks
  analysis of ivermectin based on IPA software showed that ivermectin regulated ND2.
  e Biomolecular networks analysis of ivermectin based on IPA software showed that
  ivermectin regulated ND5. f Biomolecular networks analysis of ivermectin based on
  IPA software showed that ivermectin regulated UQCRH. IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis;
