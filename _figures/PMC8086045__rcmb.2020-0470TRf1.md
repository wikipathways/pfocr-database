caption: TOLLIP’s (Toll-interacting protein’s) genetic and molecular involvement in
  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) pathophysiology. TOLLIP reduces mitochondrial
  ROS, which suppresses the mitochondrial-apoptosis pathway. TOLLIP increases autophagy,
  which further inhibits apoptosis. TOLLIP levels in IPF vary on the basis of cell
  type and disease stage (alveolar type II and bronchial epithelial cells separated
  by dashed horizontal line), but reduced TOLLIP levels may contribute to early IPF
  development, whereas elevated levels may contribute to late-stage disease progression.
  The minor allele G for reference SNP 5743890 (rs5743890) is associated with reduced
  susceptibility and increased mortality from IPF, whereas rs111521887 and rs5743894
  have the opposite effect on IPF susceptibility. Solid black arrows indicate positive
  effects, red lines with perpendicular bars indicate negative effects, and outlined
  arrows indicate up or down regulation. AT1 = alveolar type 1; AT2 = alveolar type
  2; ECM = extracellular membrane; HBE = human bronchial epithelial; MMP7 = matrix
  metalloproteinase 7; ROS = reactive oxygen species; TGF-β = transforming growth
  factor-β.
