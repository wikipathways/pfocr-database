caption: Telomere structure and maintenance mechanisms. The basic structure of telomere
  DNA (a double-stranded telomere repeat region that terminates in a 3′ single-stranded
  overhang) and the major telomere protection complex (shelterin) are illustrated
  on the left and the two telomere maintenance mechanisms are shown on the right [,
  , ]. Shelterin comprises a network of six proteins that collectively bind to both
  the double-stranded telomere repeats and the 3’-overhangs. This special nucleoprotein
  complex stabilizes chromosome ends by inhibiting DNA damage response and DNA repair
  pathways. Telomere DNA can also adopt the “T-loop” conformation in which the 3’-overhang
  forms base pairs with a more proximal region of telomere repeats. This T-loop structure
  also suppresses the DNA damage response. Telomerase is a special reverse transcriptase
  comprised of a catalytic protein component (TERT) and a template RNA (TERC). ALT
  is a recombination-based telomere elongation pathway that resembles break-induced
  replication. In high-risk neuroblastoma, recurrent genomic aberrations are tightly
  linked to either the up-regulation of telomerase or activation of ALT. The telomerase
  pathway is primarily up-regulated by MYCN amplification or TERT promoter re-arrangement,
  whereas ALT is often activated by alterations in ATRX/DAXX/H3.3 and is associated
  with telomere replication stress, chromatin de-condensation, and elevated levels
  of telomere variant repeats
