caption: Plant small peptides (SPs) regulate abiotic stress responses (A) Small peptides
  regulating drought stress responses. Root‐derived CLE25 acts as a mobile signaling
  molecule that modulates abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and promotes stomatal closure
  through long‐distance root‐to‐shoot signaling in response to water deficit. CLE9,
  specifically expressed in guard cells, serves as a local signal that enhances drought
  resistance by regulating stomatal closure. Additionally, CEP5 positively regulates
  drought tolerance, while PSK enhances osmotic stress tolerance. (B) Salt tolerance
  mechanisms regulated by SPs. This section of the diagram illustrates the signaling
  pathways involving RALF22, RALF23, and PIP3 in modulating plant responses to salt
  stress. Under non‐stress conditions, LRX3 and LRX4 bind to RALF22 and RALF23, inhibiting
  their interaction with the receptor FER and preventing FER internalization. Salt
  stress disrupts the cell wall and activates S1P protease activity, leading to the
  release of RALF22 and RALF23 from LRX proteins, thus allowing FER internalization
  through an endosomal pathway. This internalization alters cell wall integrity, inhibits
  ABA signaling, and inhibits the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby
  enhancing salt tolerance. Furthermore, under salt stress, PIP3 binds to its receptor
  RLK7, initiating a ligand‐receptor cascade that activates the MAPK3/MAPK6 pathway,
  which is crucial for maintaining Na⁺ homeostasis and further supporting salt tolerance.
  (C) CLE45 peptide functionality under heat stress. The CLE45 peptide is recognized
  by the SKM1 and SKM2 receptors. Under heat stress, CLE45 expression expands from
  the stigma to the pistil tract, where pollen tubes develop. Pollen grains express
  receptors for CLE45, facilitating the pollen–pistil interaction. This interaction,
  mediated by the CLE45‐SKM1/2 signaling pathway, enhances pollen viability and promotes
  pollen tube growth, thereby ensuring successful seed production even at elevated
  temperatures. CLE, CLAVATA3/ESR‐related peptide; CEP, C‐terminally encoded peptide;
