caption: 'Spectrum of changes in a senescent cell. DNA damage response (DDR) is one
  of the key inducers of cellular senescence, and if the DNA damage is in the telomere
  sites, this drives the cell towards a senescent state which has several characteristics,
  also acting as sustainers or inducers of the senescent state of the cell. Telomere
  shortening or damage driven DDR initiates the p16Ink4a or p21 driven pathways which
  block the cyclin D, cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)2/4/6, and cyclin E to thereby
  stabilizing the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, allowing the cell to enter the arrest
  phase. Activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-кB) through indirect activation
  of PARP1, GATA4, p38/ mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR), or Janus Kinase/Signal
  Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways activate the transcription
  of senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes. Proteostasis, either
  by impairment in the ubiquitin proteasome system or the autophagy pathway, allows
  aggregation of unwanted proteins, contributing to senescent profile of the cell.
  Mitochondrial dysfunction, including changes in the mitochondrial DNA, increased
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and altered autophagy of the mitochondrial compartments,
  contributing to the overall stressed environment leading to senescence. Chemokines,
  interleukins, and matrix modifying enzymes form the bulk of the proinflammatory
  SASP genes which may work in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner. The list
  of SASP proteins was generated based on their expression in enriched bone cells.
