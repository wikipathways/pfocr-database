caption: Upstream regulators predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) at the
  proteome level. (A) Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion of mTOR (RICTOR) and (B) Caseinolytic
  Peptidase P (CLPP) were the top inhibited upstream regulators predicted in db/db
  mice. Downstream proteins are displayed as networks. Symbol color represents expression
  value, red indicating an upregulation and blue/green indicating downregulation in
  our dataset. RICTOR and CLPP modulates the expression or function of downstream
  proteins listed in figure.
