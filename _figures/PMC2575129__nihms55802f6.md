caption: Demethylation of vanillate or methanol provides pre-formed methyl groups
  to the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Three moles of acetyl-CoA are formed from four moles
  of methanol or vanillate, because oxidation of one methyl group provides six electrons
  that reduce three moles of CO2 to three moles of CO, which can be used in the synthesis
  of three acetyl-CoA molecules. The C-1 units are labeled as in .
