caption: An early step in the initiation of allergic airway inflammation is the activation
  and maturation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells in response to thymic stromal
  lymphopoietin (TSLP), an interleukin-7-like cytokine that is produced by airway
  epithelial cells, fibroblasts and mast cells. Mature dendritic cells induce the
  differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th2 cells, which produce a characteristic
  repertoire of cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, as well as tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF). Th2 cytokines mediate airway eosinophil and mast cell recruitment,
  B cell IgE isotype class switching, and mucus secretion. Dendritic cells also secrete
  IL-6, which plays an important role in the differentiation of both Th2 and Th17
  cells. IL-17, which is produced by Th17 cells, mediates airway neutrophilia by inducing
  the production of CXC chemokines, which are chemoattractant factors, and granulocyte-colony
  stimulating factor (G-CSF), a survival and proliferation factor, by bronchial epithelial
  cells. IL-17 also induces mucin gene expression. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) negatively
  regulate immune responses via the production of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β
  (TGF-β).
