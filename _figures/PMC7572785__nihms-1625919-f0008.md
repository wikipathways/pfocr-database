caption: Presynaptic function is driven by highly energy-dependent processes, including
  assembly and maintenance of synapses, generation of action potentials and ionic
  gradients, trafficking, refilling and recycling of SVs. While local glycolysis provides
  ATP for basal synaptic activity, mitochondria supply the majority of the total ATP
  in synapses, thus supporting intensive synaptic transmission and maintaining long-term
  synaptic efficacy. Anchored presynaptic mitochondria ideally serve as local energy
  sources. Given that only ~33% of presynaptic active zones in hippocampi retain mitochondria,
  energy-sensitive regulation of mitochondrial recruitment ensures that metabolically
  active presynaptic terminals are adequately supplied with ATP during intensive synaptic
  activity. Axonal mitochondria are recruited to and anchored on presynaptic F-actin
  filaments through an anchoring platform-switch which is mediated by the myo6-SNPH
  interplay. Enhanced synaptic activity induces presynaptic energy stress, which activates
  the energy sensing AMPK-PAK signaling pathway and triggers myo6 phosphorylation,
  a cellular process essential for facilitating myo6-driven presynaptic mitochondrial
  recruitment and SNPH-mediated anchoring. Such a mechanistic crosstalk enables neurons
  to capture mitochondria at presynaptic terminals in response to local energy stress
  during sustained synaptic activity, thus fine-tuning synaptic plasticity and prolonged
  synaptic efficacy. (The illustration was adapted with permission from Sheng Trends
