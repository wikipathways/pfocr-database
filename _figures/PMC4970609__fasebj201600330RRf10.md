caption: Roles of hBVR in activating IRK/PI3K/Akt pathway. BVR binds directly to IRK,
  where it functions as platform for interaction with IRS substrates (). Activation
  of MAPK pathway (MAPK layer) is multistep process that leads to activation of MEK1/2.
  Interaction of hBVR with MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 to enhance activation of MEK has been
  defined elsewhere (). Activation of ERK1/2 results in activation of as many as 50
  transcription factors, including those shown (). IRK and BVR together activate PI3K
  (, ), source for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which interacts with PH domain of Akt and recruits
  inactive protein to membrane, where it undergoes conformational change and is phosphorylated
  at T308 by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase PDK1 (, ). Specific sequences in
  hBVR that mediate interactions with proteins in signaling pathways are indicated.
  Akts phosphorylate GSK3α/β, resulting in its inactivation; inactive protein in turn
  cannot phosphorylate and inactivate transcription factors, enabling expression of
  genes including those encoding eNOS, VEGF, and HO-1 (, –). hBVR is also instrumental
  in activating HO-1 (, ); in its capacity as reductase, it also converts biliverdin
  to bilirubin (). Akt phosphorylation of FoxO3 results in its sequestration in cytoplasm
  and thereby prevents transcription of proapoptotic genes ().
