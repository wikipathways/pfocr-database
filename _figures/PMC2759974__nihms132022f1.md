caption: 'HER2/neu is an orphan receptor that can be activated by overexpression or
  mutation of the transactivating domain (rat neu). Overexpression of HER2/neu results
  in enhanced cell survival and mitogenicity and its deregulation can lead to breast
  tumorigenesis. Erk activation by the Ras–Raf pathway leads to cell proliferation
  through the activation of a number of nuclear targets. Activation of the PI3K–Akt
  pathway results in enhanced survival through inhibition of proapoptosis proteins,
  such as Bad, GSK3 and the transcription factor FKHR-L1. A major mitogenic player
  acting downstream of ErbB2 is cyclin D1 []. Once bound by Wnt, the Frizzled/LDL-related
  protein (LRP) coreceptor complex activates the canonical signaling pathway. Frizzled
  interacts with Dsh, a cytoplasmic protein that functions upstream of β-catenin and
  the kinase GSK3β. Wnt signaling controls phosphorylation of Dsh. Wnts are thought
  to induce the phosphorylation of LRP by GSK3β and CK1γ, thus regulating the docking
  of Axin. The recruitment of Axin away from the destruction complex leads to the
  stabilization of β-catenin. In the nucleus, β-catenin displaces Groucho from Tcf/Lef
  to promote the transcription of Wnt target genes, one of which is cyclin D1. As
  indicated, a number of pathways lead from the receptors to enhanced activation of
  cyclin D1, thereby promoting cell cycle progression. c-Myc is one of the direct
  targets of E2Fs. Although both c-Myc and cyclin D1 rescue the CSF-1 response and
  regulate each other [], MMTV-Myc-induced breast cancer development is not dependent
  on cyclin D1 []. Dmp1 is a unique transcription factor that regulates the Arf-Mdm2-p53
  tumor surveillance pathway [–].APC: Adenomatosis polyposis coli; Cdc25: Cell division
