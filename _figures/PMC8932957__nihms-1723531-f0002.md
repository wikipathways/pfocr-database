caption: This model summarizes the conserved nutrient-sensing pathways that regulate
  longevity and stress-response mechanisms in different model organisms. Fasting or
  calorie restriction reduces the activity of amino acids and glucose signaling pathways
  through membrane receptors by reducing circulating ligands such as growth factors
  like mammalian IGF-1. The fasting-inhibited TOR–S6K pathway (labeled in blue) promotes
  the expression of nuclear transcription factors such as the hypoxia-inducible factor-1
  (HIF-1), the FOXA ortholog PHA-4, the nuclear hormone receptors NHR-62 and NHR-49
  and the TFEB ortholog HLH-30 (worms), the FOXA nuclear factor (flies) and the increase
  of the FOXO nuclear factor (mammals). These transcription factors commonly activate
  antiaging systems and processes, including autophagy and ribosomal biogenesis, stress
  response and cellular-protection genes, including antioxidant SODs. The RAS–AC–PKA
  pathway (labeled in green) is also partially conserved between species. Similar
  to what was observed in yeast, glucose in certain mammalian cells can signal through
  the PKA pathway and the transcription factor EGR1, the mammalian ortholog of Msn2/Msn4
  in yeast. In worms, flies and mice, downregulation of TOR–S6K signaling has conserved
  proaging effects. The fasting-dependent effects on longevity in different organisms
  may also involve sirtuin pathway activation (labeled in orange), the increase in
  mitochondria respiration and the activation of autophagy,. Also, fasting in flies
  delays the disruption of tricellular junctions (TCJs), which is linked to improved
  intestinal barrier integrity and therefore longevity (labeled in gray).
