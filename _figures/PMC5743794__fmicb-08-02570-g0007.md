caption: Microcin-PDI regulation model. The proposed regulatory mechanism of mcpM
  through the AI-2 uptake pathway (modified from Li et al., ). The AI-2 molecule produced
  by LuxS is actively transported into the cell by LsrACBD where it is phosphorylated
  by LsrK. The phosphorylated AI-2 interacts with LsrR and the signal is transduced
  via LsrR through (1) an unknown mechanism (?) that influences the two component
  system, EnvZ/OmpR (modified from Delihas and Forst, ; Blain et al., ) and induces
  expression of sRNA micC and/or micF that subsequently bind mcpM mRNA to inhibit
  translation, or (2) via an alternative pathway (?) that regulates transcription
  of micF and/or micC.
