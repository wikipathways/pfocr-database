caption: The EO771 phenotype and their sensitivity to tamoxifen. EO771 cells express
  ERβ, PR and HER2. In presence of estrogens, ERβ are translocated to the nucleus
  where they bind to the estrogen response elements (ERE) inducing transduction of
  target genes. Anti-estrogen treatments, such as tamoxifen, block this effect. On
  the contrary, tamoxifen induces the activation of p38 and JNK pathway, leading to
  apoptosis, but also increases the MMP3 level
