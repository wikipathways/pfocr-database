caption: Interactions of metastatic tumor cells with the brain microenvironment. After
  the tumor cells get into the CNS (central nervous system), according to the “seed
  and soil”, series of interactions happened between the tumor cells and the microenvironment
  in brain. Extensive research has shown that astrocytes play an important role in
  metastasis through matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP9, exosome and gap junction,
  generally supports the growth and invasion. MMP2、MMP9 are associated with tumor
  growth. On the one hand, it could degrade components of the extracellular matrix
  and basement membrane, on the other hand, it helps to activate TGF-β and VEGF. Several
  studies have shown that after fusion of AST-generating exosomes with tumor cells,
  miRNAs contained in the exosomes cause tumor cells to under-express PTEN and further
  activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, leading to more chemokine ligand 2(CCL2), promoting
  the growth of tumor. There are gap junctions composed of connexin 43 (Cx43) between
  tumor cell and astrocyte. Through the gap junction, astrocyte release cytokines
  such as IFNα and TNFα, activating STAT1 and NF-κB pathways, supporting tumor growth.
  At the same time, tumor cell could transfer cGAMP to astrocytes, activate the STAT3
  pathways. Tumor-associated macrophages and microglia (TAMs), including bone marrow-derived
  macrophages (BMDMs) and microglia (MG), secret growth factors (EGF, IL6, TGF-β,
  IL-1β), contribute to the colonization. And the tumor cells release chemokines and
  cytokines (CSF-1, GM-CSF, MCP-1, HGF, SDF-1, CX3CL) to recruit TAMs towards the
  tumor cells. There are immune checkpoints expressed on T-cells, such as PD-1 and
  CTLA-4, which tumor cells could bind and deactivate T-cells, suppressing anti-tumor
  immunity. Checkpoint immunotherapy use antibodies to inhibit immune checkpoint to
  prevent the T-cell from deactivation and control the tumor.

  description: Interactions of metastatic tumor cells with the brain microenvironment.
    After the tumor cells get into the CNS (central nervous system), according to

    an important role in metastasis through matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP9,

    are associated with tumor growth. On the one hand, it could degrade components
