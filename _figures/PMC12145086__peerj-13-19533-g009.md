caption: The relative content of all the metabolite groups except the phenolic group
  was obtained from GC/MS analysis. The relative contents were log10-transformed average
  values and missing values were treated as zeros. The data were then visualized as
  a heatmap using GraphPad Prism version 9 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA,
  USA). The colored squares (blue-to-red) represent the relative content of each metabolite
  (low to high, respectively). The brown, green, purple, blue, and pink characterized
  metabolites represent the class of sugar and sugar alcohol, phenolic acids, organic
  acids, amino acids, and fatty acids, respectively. The intermediates are shown in
  black. Yellow highlighted metabolites have been reported to inhibit melanogenesis
