caption: Overview of SNPs affecting NET formation. (A) KIF26B activates PIK3/Akt signalling
  pathway, resulting in the activation of NADPH oxidase, which, together with the
  influence of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induces neutrophil elastase (NE) activation.
  This results in the upregulation of MPO-DNA complexes and an increase in NETosis
  [177,178,179,180]. The genes TMPRSS13 and OR10H1 have also been found to increase
  the expression of MPO-DNA complexes [177]. (B) TNFAIP3 encodes the protein A20.
  Genetic variants in the A20 de-ubiquitinase (DUB) domain (e.g., rs2230926) result
  in the increased activation of PADI4, facilitating an increase in Peptidyl Arginine
  Deiminase-4 (PAD4) and NETosis [5,163,181,182,183,184]. (C) The DNase complex is
  a negative regulator of NETosis; however, genetic mutations in the DNase genes will
  cause the accumulation of NETs [185,186]. Figure created using BioRender.com (15
