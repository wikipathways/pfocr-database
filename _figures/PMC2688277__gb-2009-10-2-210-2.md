caption: Model for positioning the root transition zone. (a) In the Arabidopsis root,
  basipetal auxin transport generates an auxin maximum at the stem-cell niche (STN)
  where it is required for stem-cell specification [,]. Cell division is confined
  to the proximal meristem (PM), and cells differentiate and elongate in the elongation
  differentiation zone (EDZ). The transition zone (TZ) is the boundary between dividing
  and expanding cells. (b) Meristem size, defined as the number of cells in a cell
  file in the proximal meristem, is determined by rates of cell division in the meristem
  and differentiation at the transition zone. Perturbations favoring cell division
  increase meristem size, whereas those favoring differentiation decrease meristem
  size. Cell division is maintained in the proximal meristem by the presence of high
  auxin concentrations. Auxin activity is antagonized in the transition zone by cytokinin
  synthesized in the vasculature, which induces expression of SHY2 through the AHK3/ARR1,
  ARR12 cytokinin signaling pathway. SHY2 represses auxin responses and represses
  PIN expression, limiting lateral auxin transport and enabling cell differentiation
  and elongation. SHY2 also regulates the cytokinin biosynthesis enzyme IPT5. SHY2
  is itself regulated by auxin; it is marked for proteasome degradation through auxin-dependent
  recognition by the SCFTIR1 complex.
