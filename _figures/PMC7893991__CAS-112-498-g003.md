caption: Diet can directly or indirectly alter glucose metabolism. Insulin activates
  PI3K, which stimulates both glucose uptake and other tumorigenic pathways. Treatment
  with a PI3K inhibitor causes hyperglycemia due to systemic blockade of insulin action,
  leading to hypersecretion of insulin from the pancreas. High levels of circulating
  insulin reactivate PI3K in tumor cells. These feedback mechanisms result in resistance
  of tumor cells to PI3K inhibition. A ketogenic diet suppresses insulin levels and
  antagonizes the resistance to PI3K inhibitors. FMD, fasting‐mimetic diet; IGF‐1,
  Insulin‐like growth factor 1; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3‐kinase. Note that fructose
  is protumorigenic. Mannose accumulates as mannose‐6‐phosphate (M6P) catalyzed by
  hexokinase and then inhibits various metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the
  TCA cycle, and the pentose‐phosphate pathway (see text for details)
