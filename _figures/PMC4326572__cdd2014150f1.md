caption: Main molecular pathways activated in the presence or absence of nutrients.
  (a) The synergic import of leucine (Leu) and glutamine (Gln) (top left) results
  in mTORC1 recruitment to the lysosomal membrane and its subsequent activation by
  at least two distinct pathways. The first one proposes that cytosolic amino acids
  enter the lysosome and signal their presence to RAG-A and RAG-C (or RAG-B and RAG-D,
  not shown in the figure) through the lysosome-located proton pump v-ATPase and the
  multimolecular complex called Ragulator. The second pathway provides for the double
  deamination of Gln catalysed by the enzymes glutaminase (GLN) and glutamate dehydrogenase
  (GDH). This sequence of reactions subsequently generates glutamate (Glu) and α-ketoglutarate
  (αKG) that, by acting as co-substrate for prolyl hydroxylases (PHD), finally leads
  to RAG activation. GTP-bound RAG-A (or B) and GDP-bound RAG-C (or D) can then recruit
  mTORC1 to the lysosome membrane where it is activated by RHEB (middle left). Once
  activated, mTORC1 activates protein synthesis by phosphorylating 4EBP1 and p70S6K,
  and concomitantly inhibits autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1 complex at the level
  of ULK1 and Atg13 (bottom left). Glucose is taken up through specific transporters
  (GLUTs) and phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by hexokinase (the only
  mitochondrial isoform II, HKII, is shown in the top right side of the figure). G6P
  is then isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), oxidized through the glycolytic
  pathway to generate pyruvate (Pyr) and acetyl-CoA that fuels the mitochondrial TCA
  cycle and the respiratory chain for the production of ATP (middle right) through
  the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). G6P can also undergo oxidation via the glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PDH)-mediated catalysis along the pentose phosphate pathway (middle
  right). In this way, electrons required for NADP+-to-NADPH reduction, and sugars
  needed for DNA de novo synthesis (e.g., ribulose-5-phosphate, R5P) are also provided
  (bottom right). (b) Upon amino acid deprivation, RAGs exchange nucleotides located
  in their binding sites (GTP with GDP or vice versa), thus leading to mTORC1 release
  from the lysosome membrane (top left). These 2 events are associated with the inhibitory
  binding of mTORC1 to HKII that takes place upon glucose deficiency and G6P level
  decrease (top right). This condition leads to a decrease of NADPH and ATP levels
  that finally result in a reduced antioxidant capacity of the cell (especially in
  regenerating the reduced thiol pool) (middle right) and in energetic stress that
  the cell attempts to counteract by the adenylate kinase (AK)-mediated conversion
  of ADP into ATP and AMP (centre). AMP increase induces to the activation of AMPK
  that inhibits protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 and mTORC1 and activates
  autophagy by phospho-activating ULK1. Once activated, ULK1 phosphorylates its interactors
  (Atg13 and FIP200) and recruits microtubule-associated PI3K complex by means of
  an AMBRA1-mediated process to initiate the nucleation phase of autophagic vesicles
  from the endoplasmic reticulum (or mitochondria, not shown). Many other factors,
  such as Atg proteins coming from Golgi apparatus (e.g., Atg9) contribute to phagophore
  elongation and autophagosome formation (bottom)
