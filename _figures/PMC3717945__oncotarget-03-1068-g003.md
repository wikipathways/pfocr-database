caption: Activation of this pathway can occur by mutations in upstream growth factor
  receptors (GFR) or by stimulation by the appropriate GF. In addition mutations can
  occur in intrinsic members of the pathway (RAS PIK3CA, AKT or the tumor suppressors
  (NF1, PTEN, TSC1, TSC2). Sites where NF1, PTEN, TSC1, TSC2 are depicted in black
  rectangles as they normally serve to dampen the activity of this pathway. An activated
  growth factor receptor is indicated in blue. Ras and Rheb are indicated in dark
  blue ovals. IRS1, SOS, Shc and Grb2 are indicated in orange ovals. Kinases are indicated
  in green ovals. The p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K is indicated in a red oval. Phosphatases
  are indicated in black octagons. NF1, TSC1 and TSC2 are indicated in black squares.
  PIP2 and PIP3 are indicated in yellow ovals. mTOR interacting proteins which positively
  regulate mTOR activity are indicated in yellor ovals. mTOR interacting proteins
  which negatively regulate mTOR activity are indicated in black ovals. Transcription
  factors activated by either ERK or Akt phosphorylation are indicated in yellow diamonds.
  The Foxo transcription factor that is inactivated by Akt phosphorylation is indicated
  by a black diamond. β-catenin is indicated in an orange rectangle. mRNA initiation
  factors and proteins associated with the ribosome are indicated in purple ovals.
  mTORC1 phosphorylates the unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) which results in the suppression
  of autophagy. ULK1 is indicated in a black oval. The mTORC1 inhibitor prevents phosphorylation
  of ULK1 and autophagy can occur. Sites where various small molecule inhibitors function
  are in black octagons. Representative inhibitors are listed in boxes in yellow next
  to the octagons. Red arrows indicate activating events in pathways. Black arrows
  indicating inactivating events in pathway. Activating phosphorylation events are
  depicted in red circles with Ps with a black outlined circle. Inactivating phosphorylation
  events are depicted in black circles with Ps with a red outlined circle.
