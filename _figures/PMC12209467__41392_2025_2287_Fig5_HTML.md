caption: NF-κB and NLRP3 signaling pathways in PH. a NF-κB signaling pathway and targeted
  therapy in PH. PDGF, hypoxia, MCT and cigarette smoke activate NF-κB in PASMCs and
  PAECs, promoting proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and inflammation via p65
  nuclear translocation, HIF-1α activation, and CaSR upregulation. In hypoxia-PH,
  NLRC3 and PGC-1α are reduced, leading to activation of p65 in PAECs, which drives
  apoptosis, migration, and EndMT. In IPAH, NF-κB is activated in macrophages, promoting
  inflammation. NF-κB inhibition can alleviate PH using agents like IMD-0354, Simvastatin,
  Atorvastatin, Ruscogenin, Prednisolone, ad-A20, BAY11-7082, Nicorandil, and TRE.

  signaling pathway and targeted therapy in PH. Su/Hx-PAH activates NLRP3 in PAECs,
  causing proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and pyroptosis. In macrophages, this
  trigger activates NLRP3, promoting inflammation and IL-1β release. In IPAH and Su/Hx-PAH,
  NLRP3 is activated in PASMCs, inducing pyroptosis and proliferation. In MCT-PH,
  NLRP3 activation in monocytes and cardiomyocytes drives hypertrophy and mitochondrial
  dysfunction. NLRP3 activation contributes to PH progression. PNU-282987 and Astragaloside
