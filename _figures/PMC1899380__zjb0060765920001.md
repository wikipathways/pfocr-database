caption: 'Late steps in corrin ring biosynthesis in serovar Typhimurium. When this
  work was initiated, this was the model of the enzymatic reactions needed for the
  last step in de novo corrin ring synthesis and nucleotide loop assembly in serovar
  Typhimurium. Shown are the enzymes, substrates, and intermediates of the pathway.
  Abbreviations: Cby, cobyric acid; AdoCby, adenosylcobyric acid; Cbi, cobinamide;
  AdoCbi, adenosylcobinamide; AdoCbi-P, adenosylcobinamide phosphate; AdoCbi-GDP,
  adenosylcobinamide GDP; AdoCbl, adenosylcobalamin; l-Thr, l-threonine; l-Thr-P,
  l-threonine phosphate; AP, aminopropanol; AP-P, aminopropanol phosphate; α-RP, α-ribazole-5′-phosphate;
  α-R, α-ribazole; DMB, 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole; α-DAD, 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole
  adenine dinucleotide; Nm, nicotinamide. CbiB, putative AdoCbi-P synthase; CobU,
  AdoCbi kinase and guanylyltransferase; CobT, NaMN:5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase;
  CobS, adenosylcobalamin synthase; CobC, α-ribazole-phosphate phosphatase; CobD,
  l-Thr O-3-phosphate decarboxylase. The boxed reaction, proposed to be catalyzed
  by the CobC enzyme, came into question during the course of this work. The black
  box represents the corrinoid transport system (BtuBFCD) (, , ).'
