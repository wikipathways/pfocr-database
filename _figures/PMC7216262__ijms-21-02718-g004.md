caption: 'This figure illustrates the ways in which activity from the mTOR signaling
  pathway contributes to epidermis (a), gut (b) and liver regeneration (c): (a) mTORC1
  activity is necessary for wound closure and can be enhanced by insulin/insulin-like
  growth factor signaling (IIS). S6K1/2 is a TOR target which helps wound closure.
  mTOR inhibitory signals like rapamycin or an overexpressed PRAS40 delay wound closure
  and promote autophagy. (b) For gut regeneration, mTORC1 activity is required for
  initial cell proliferation but chronic activation leads to intestinal stem cell
  exhaustion. (c) For liver regeneration, mTORC1 activity leads to cell cycle reentry
  and functional recovery. eIF4E (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4E) dependent translation
  is activated with mTORC1 activity and leads to Cyclin D expression. Cyclin D amplifies
  cell proliferation and leads to functional liver recovery.'
