caption: Novel KP/KISS1R signaling pathways in breast cancer cells lacking the estrogen
  receptor, ERα. ERα has been found to negatively regulates KISS1R expression. KISS1R
  activation in these cells leads to epidermal growth factor (EGFR) transactivation
  via β-arrestin 2- and IQGAP1-mediated pathways. KISS1R activation can induce epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT), resulting in a decrease in E-cadherin expression and acquisition
  of a mesenchymal phenotype, characterized by actin cytoskeleton re-organization
  and stress fiber formation. Expression of mesenchymal markers (Snail/slug, N-cadherin,
  Vimentin) also increases. KP/KISS1R pathway can also activate RhoA. Blue solid lines
  represent KISS1R interacting proteins; black dashed lines represent EGFR interacting
  proteins.
