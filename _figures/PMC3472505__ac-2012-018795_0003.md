caption: KEGG global pathway map of identified and putatively annotated metabolites
  labeled by 13C-glucose (red) and unlabeled putative metabolites arising from alternative
  sources (gray). Inferred potentially active biosynthesis pathways are highlighted;
  black routes have not previously been known to be active in Trypanosoma brucei.
  Map generated using IPath tools.
