caption: Proposed model of MAPK/TGF-β/COPB2/NUPR1 axis in control cell proliferation,
  migration and invasion in PCa cells. Vesicles plays a critical role in membrane
  transport between ER and Golgi apparatus. COPI-coated vesicles, which contain seven
  non-clathrin-coated vesicular coat subunits, play its function in the early secretory
  pathway. COPB2 is one of subunits involving in transport between ER and Golgi. After
  many researches have been done, we have identified the differential and functional
  COPB2 protein. On one hand, the COPB2 can be as a molecular to be secreted to serum
  and be considered as a biomarker to detect some potential PCa patients. On the other
  hand, more important, COPB2 can promote cell proliferation, migration and invasion
  via MAPK/TGF-β signaling pathway in PCa. The least but not the last, COPB2 can interaction
  with NUPR1, which is a transcription factor associated with cancer development and
  advancement.
