caption: The GDF‐5 signalling pathway and regulation of GDF‐5 expression. GDF‐5, binding
  to its receptors, activates Smad1/5/8 and subsequently form a complex with Smad
  4. The complex then translocates into the nucleus, regulating the expression of
  target genes, such as COL2A1 and ACAN. In addition, GDF‐5 can induce phosphorylation
  of p38, which promotes nuclear translocation of Trps1, increasing COL2A1 gene expression
  in the chondrogenic cell line (ATDC5). During OA, the activated canonical Wnt signalling
  pathway induces the expression of the ECM‐degrading enzymes MMP13 in human chondrocytes,
  whereas GDF‐5 enhances DKK1 to inhibit this signalling. In addition, transcription
  factors YAP, SOX11, ZEB1 and PITX1 and microRNAs, miR‐449a and miR‐21, regulate
  GDF‐5 expression. Extracellular osmolarity, ranging from 380 to 450 mOsm, improves
  cellular responsiveness to GDF‐5
