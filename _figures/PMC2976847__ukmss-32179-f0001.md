caption: Cytokines, hormones or growth factors that activate Stat5. Cytokines can
  be grouped based on structural homologies, similar signal transduction pathways
  and shared receptor chains. The specific example shown refers to definitive erythropoiesis.
  Self renewal and differentiation of erythroid cells requires functional Epo signaling
  through its receptor EpoR and Jak2, leading to tyrosine-phosphorylated, transcriptionally
  active Stat5a and Stat5b proteins. Stat5 molecules involved were found to be dimers
  and to be attached to the receptor via the N-terminus prior to tyrosine phosphorylation
  (). Efficient nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of Stat5 requires
  tyrosine phosphorylated Stat5 proteins. Unrestrained Stat5 activation is found in
  the presence of many different transforming tyrosine kinases, which can contribute
  to diseases such as cancer. In contrast, too little Stat5 activation causes diseases
  like anemia. Recently, we found that Stat5 molecules also have an important function
  in the cytoplasm to activate the PI3K-Akt pathway. Stat5 molecules can form dimers,
  homo- or hetero-tetramers on DNA (so called oligomers), which can induce the formation
  of DNA loop structures.
