caption: Minimally oxidized LDL induces TLR4-dependent lipoprotein uptake by macrophages.
  Polyoxygenated CE hydroperoxides, with a generic structure shown in the top-center
  portion of the Figure (n = 1 – 4), are responsible for cytoskeletal rearrangements
  induced by mmLDL in macrophages. The TLR4/MD-2 receptor complex is required for
  the cytoskeletal effects of mmLDL and OxCE. The TLR4-dependent signaling pathway
  involves recruitment of Syk, likely via the Syk N-terminal SH2 domain binding to
  a phospho-tyrosine in the C-terminal domain of TLR4, phosphorylation of Syk, with
  subsequent activation of Vav1, Ras, Raf, MEK1 and ERK1/2. Downstream from ERK1/2,
  Cdc42, Rac and paxillin are activated, inducing actin polymerization and robust
  plasma membrane ruffling as shown in the bottom-left image (green, F-actin; blue,
  nucleus). In addition, ERK1/2 mediates Rho activation, and mmLDL activates PI3K
  (in a TLR4-independent manner); both Rho and PI3K regulate ruffles closure into
  large endosomes. In the process of such a liquid phase uptake occurring in lipoprotein-rich
  environments, large quantities of lipoproteins become captured, including mmLDL
  and also native LDL and OxLDL. The result is the formation of lipid-laden macrophage
  foam cells, as the one shown in the bottom-right image (red, Oil Red O staining
  of intracellular neutral lipid). Note that this mechanism combines a specific receptor
  (TLR4) recognition of distinct oxidized lipid moieties in mmLDL and the non-specific
  macropinocytic uptake of a variety of lipoproteins present in the vicinity of a
  macrophage.
