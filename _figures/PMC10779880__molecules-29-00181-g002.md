caption: Signaling pathways acting on neurons and non-neuron cells after TRPV1 activation.
  TRPV1 can be activated by capsaicin, heat, protons, various cytokines, lipids, neurotrophins
  and neurotransmitters. Upon activation of plasma membrane TRPV1, different downstream
  signaling pathways will be induced in various cell types. The most studied cell
  type is neurons. After TRPV1 is activated, inflow of Na+ and Ca2+ can cause trigger
  action potential of nerve signal transmission and then stimulate various physiological
  activities of the body, participating in the generation and transmission of cold
  sensation, pain regulation and the regulation of inflammatory substances. Activation
  of TRPV1 also plays a role in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain, anxiety and
  cognitive dysfunction. In addition, the TRPV1 channel is expressed in the human
  vascular system and affects vascular tension upon activation. In osteoarthritis,
  TRPV1 inhibits M1 macrophage polarization and reduces synovitis via Ca2+. Activating
  TRPV1 also can cause mitochondrial dysfunction and increase the release of ROS
