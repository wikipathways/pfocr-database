caption: A) Predicted interactions of four specific types combined to assemble B)
  (arrows in black representing our final predicted pathway interactions) a pathway
  connecting the transcription factor Adr1 involved in carbon metabolism process to
  its regulatory input Snf1. This generates two concrete hypotheses suggesting, first,
  cross-talk between the calmodulin- and Snf1-dependent pathways via Cmk2 phosphorylating
  Glc7. Second, we also predict coordinated regulation between the glycogen breakdown
  and glucose utilization pathways through a metabolic interaction between Adr1 and
  Gph1. C) Previously known and newly predicted interactions in yeast protein transport
  connecting the plasma membrane, vacuole, golgi and ER. We propose a regulatory competition
  between the Arf1 and Vsp1 GTPases for Bch1 functionality that is likely regulated
  by GTP availability, which itself is known to be regulated by protein sorting events
  in the cell. These predictions also hypothesize that YDL012c may be involved in
  regulating Vps1 activity.
