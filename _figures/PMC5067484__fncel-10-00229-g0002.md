caption: Reelin signaling pathway in the adult brain, which regulates synaptic function.
  Reelin binds to ApoER2 and activates SFKs, which phosphorylate a tyrosine of the
  NR2 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, resulting in the potentiation
  of NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx. ApoER2 binds to PSD-95, a scaffolding protein
  in the post synapse. ApoER2 is proteolytically cleaved by γ-secretase activity,
  which is activated by NMDA receptor signaling. Then, the intracellular domain of
  ApoER2 (ApoER2-ICD) is released from the cell membrane and translocates into the
  nucleus and activates transcriptional factors, including MEF2 and CREB. In the presynapse,
  the Reelin-ApoER2-PI3K pathway promotes Ca2+ influx, which leads to the selective
  mobilization of VAMP7-enriched synaptic vesicles, promoting neurotransmitter release.
