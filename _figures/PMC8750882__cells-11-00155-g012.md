  complex formation []. The other downregulated miRNA mmu-miR-669o-5p interacts with
  the BMP and Activin Membrane Bound Inhibitor (Bambi) which can both up- and downregulate
  the β-catenin signaling [,,]. The upregulated mmu-miR-152-3p targets Wnt10b, which
  promotes the β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling pathway []. Wnt receptors are also
  targeted by upregulated miRNAs: LRP5 by mm-miR-375-3p and FZD5 by mmu-miR-199a-5p.
  Two Wnt inhibitors are targeted by two upregulated miRNAs: GSK-3β by mmu-miR-199a-5p,
  and Ctbp2 by mmu-miR-375-3p. Ctbp2 is originally an inhibitor, but some studies
  indicate that it may also act as an activator of TCF [,]. Thus, it can be seen that

  pathway initiators, which indicate an overall downregulation of the Wnt signaling
