caption: Signaling through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is regulated at multiple nodes
  via negative feedback loops and compensatory mechanisms. Activation of mTORC1 induces
  down-regulation of IRS1/2 (1), thereby inhibiting PI3K activation by the insulin
  and IGF1 receptors (InsR/IGF1R). In addition, mTORC1 directly phosphorylates and
  stabilizes Grb10 (2), which acts to inhibit signaling from the InsR/IGF1R to IRS1/2.
  Signaling via mTORC1 also inhibits mTORC2 through phosphorylation by S6K (3), thus
  inhibiting AKT phosphorylation on S473. Furthermore, activated AKT inhibits FOXO-mediated
  up-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including EGFR, HER3 and InsR/IGF1R
  (4). CDK4/6-Cyclin D complexes inhibit mTORC1 signaling via phosphorylation and
  inhibition of TSC2 (5). Disruption of these negative feedback loops by pharmacological
  inhibitors induces up-regulation of compensatory mechanism that may lead to adaptive
  resistance. Finally, tumor cells can also respond to pharmacological PI3K pathway
  inhibition by stimulating PI3K-independent oncogenic signaling. For example, enhanced
  FOXO-mediated RTK expression resulting from AKT down-regulation can up-regulate
  ERK signaling (6).
