caption: 'Sites of action of analgesics in the nociceptive pathway of parturition.
  During labour, hormonal factors such as increases in the concentrations of relaxin,
  estrogens, and PGs lead to cervical dilation and contractions. In the uterine tissue,
  LUS, myometrium, and cervix, different pro-inflammatory or degrading substances
  (such as collagenases) initiate an inflammatory response for the onset of softening
  and ripening the cervix. All of these factors activate peripheral nociceptors (A-δ
  and C fibers). These transduce the noxious stimulus into an electrical signal that
  is transmitted to the DRG of the spinal cord. Once in this structure, nociception
  modulation occurs, and drugs such as alpha-2 agonists, COX-2 inhibitors, local anesthetics,
  and opioids act at this site. These spinal neurons project to brain areas such as
  the thalamus or the somatosensory cortex, where pain perception occurs. Moreover,
  the activation of thalamic and hypothalamic areas leads to the secretion of other
  hormones such as ACTH or OXT. The adrenal gland contributes to the increase in circulating
  levels of A, NA, and cortisol, due to ACTH (cortisol) or by sympathetic influence
  (A, NA). Local anesthetics, NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, opioids, acetaminophen, NMDA
  antagonist, and other analgesics act in each of the mentioned stages of the nociceptive
  pathway, depending on the nature of the drug. 1. transduction; 2: transmission;
