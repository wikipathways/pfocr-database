caption: FHL1 isoform KyoT2 and Notch signaling. In mouse, the Notch signaling pathway
  is activated by proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor by γ-secretase-like protease,
  releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NIC). NIC translocates into the nucleus
  and transactivates RBP-J. KyoT2 can disrupt this interaction via its RBP-J binding
  domain and subsequently suppress transcription by displacing RBP-J from DNA and/or
  recruiting co-suppressors (i.e. RING1 and/or HPC2). Furthermore, sumoylation by
  PIAS1 antagonizes KyoT2’s repressor activity.
