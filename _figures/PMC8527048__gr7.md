caption: Scheme of the crosstalk of sphingolipid and eicosanoid metabolic pathways.
  The sphingolipid pathway is known to involve the SPT complex, which is negatively
  regulated by ORMDL family proteins. This pathway leads to the production of sphingosines
  and ceramides. The eicosanoid pathway involves PLA2 and 5-LO. When activated, PLA2
  releases arachidonic acid (AA) from ER membranes, which is utilized by 5-LO and
  cyclooxygenases (COX) as a substrate for the production of precursors of leukotrienes
  and prostaglandins, respectively. The connection between eicosanoid and sphingolipid
  pathways is linked to the activity of their mediators. It has been shown that the
  nonvesicular C1P transfer regulates PLA2-dependent release of arachidonic acid ()
  and that second messenger S1P induces expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) ().
  Data in this study indicate that ORMDL3 interacts with 5-LO and that 5-LO interacts
  with SPT complex subunits, SPTLC1 and SPTLC2. The functional consequences of the
  leukotriene and sphingolipid pathway crosstalk are shown (in orange) and involve
  1) inhibitory role of ORMDL3 on the activity of 5-LO and eicosanoid production;
  2) activatory role of SPTLC1 on 5-LO activity; 3) inhibitory effect of 5-LO on ceramide
  levels. Moreover, reduced SPTLC1 levels are followed by decreased expression of
  SPTLC2 and ORMDL3 (dashed lines). Sphingolipid synthesis inhibitors, myriocin and
  fumonisin B1, which block the activity of SPT complex and ceramide synthase, respectively,
  affect the release of AA from membranes and subsequently the formation of LTB4 or
  PGD2. These data are in line with the regulatory roles of ceramides on the PLA2
  activity (, ). Thus, the crosstalk between eicosanoid and sphingolipid pathways
  seems to be mediated via metabolic mediators (ceramides, S1P, and C1P) and physical
  interaction of ORMDL-SPT complex and 5-LO.
