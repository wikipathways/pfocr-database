caption: Schematic modeling of the TcpB inhibition of TLR4 signaling. Oval shapes
  represent TcpB (orange), TLR4 (blue), MAL (yellow), and MyD88 (green). The model
  emphasizes the key findings from our study and is a simplified diagram of the signaling
  system. For example, the exact domains involved in the interactions between these
  proteins have not yet been clearly defined, and thus the model does not show specific
  domain interactions. A, a simplified representation of the TLR4 signaling pathway,
  showing the activation and dimerization of TLR4 creates a platform to form a complex
  with MAL and MyD88. B, the presence of TcpB causes suppression of the TLR4 signaling
  pathway, by forming a complex with TLR4, MAL, and MyD88.
