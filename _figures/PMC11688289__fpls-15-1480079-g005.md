caption: 'Changes in metabolic pathways of major secondary metabolites in the rhizomes
  of P. kingianum after 40 days of treatment with different concentrations of selenium.
  (A) Differential metabolites and genes in the flavonoid metabolic pathway under
  SeNPs treatment (CHS: chalcone synthase; IFS: isoflavonoid synthase; HID: 2-hydroxyisoflavanone
  dehydratase; HMM1: 2,7,4’-trihydroxyisoflavanone 4’-O-methyltransferase; CYP81E9:
  isoflavone 3’-hydroxylase; PBS: pseudobaptigenin synthase; IFR: isoflavone reductase;
  VR: vestitone reductase; F3H: flavanone 3-dioxygenase; F3’5’H: flavanoid 3’,5’-hydroxylase;
  CYP75B1: flavonoid 3’-monooxygenase; DFR: dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS: anthocyanidin
  synthase; FNSI: flavone synthase I; CYP93B16: flavone synthase II; FLS: flavonol
  synthase; LAR: leucoanthocyanidin reductase). (B) Differential metabolites and genes
  in the polysaccharide metabolic pathway under SeNPs treatment (UGPase: UDP glucose
  pyrophosphorylase; CesA: cellulose synthase; GPT: glucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase;
  SUS: sucrose synthase; ISU: inulosucrase; SFT: sucrose 6-fructosyltransferase; 6-FFH:
  beta-2,6-fructan-6-levanbiohydrolase; INU: 2,6-beta-D-fructan fructanohydrolase;
  GCK: glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase; AGS: ADP-glucose starch synthase;
  GBSSI: NDP-glucose-starch glucosyltransferase; BE: 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme).
  Blue ovals represent metabolites with reduced content. Orange rectangles represent
  enzymes that were up-regulated by the differential gene, blue rectangles represent
  enzymes that were down-regulated by the differential gene, and green rectangles
  represent enzymes that underwent both down- and up-regulation by the differential
  gene'
