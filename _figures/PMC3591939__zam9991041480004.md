caption: Proposed gene regulation pathway of oxalate metabolism in response to MCQ.
  The green- and apricot-shaded areas denote the mitochondria and the peroxisome,
  respectively. The double lines represent the cell membrane. Red and blue text colors
  indicate that a gene was more highly expressed before or after the MCQ-treated wood
  showed high strength loss, respectively (FDR < 1E−4). TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle;
  GLOX, glyoxylate cycle; CS, citrate synthase, gene 6899; AH, aconitate hydratase,
  gene 7902; AP, succinate/fumarate antiporter, gene 5088; ICL, gene 415; ODH, 2-oxoglutarate
  dehydrogenase e1 component, gene 4245; GDH, gene 1257; ODC1, gene 7157; ODC2, gene
  6399. Based on reference  (copyright 2001 National Academy of Sciences USA).
