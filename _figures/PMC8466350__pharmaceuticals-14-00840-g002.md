caption: 'JAK-STAT regulation of intestinal permeability: Pore Pathway. During intestinal
  inflammation, proinflammatory cytokines are released and bind to their respective
  receptors on intestinal epithelial cells. The associated cellular tyrosine kinases,
  JAKs, are then brought together and activated. These interactions subsequently lead
  to phosphorylation of the cytokine receptor which act as hubs for STATs. The JAKs
  would then phosphorylate the STATS and the phosphorylated STATs would dimerize,
  enter the nucleus, and serve as transcription factors for genes that express tight
  junction proteins which influence intestinal permeability. In the pore pathway,
  claudin-2 expression is upregulated in response to IL-22, IFN-γ, and IL-6. Expression
  of barrier-sealing claudins is reduced; however, the mechanisms that underlie these
  alterations require further investigation. The JAK inhibitors tofacitinib, AZD1480,
  and JAK inhibitor I, reduce expression of claudin-2 and consequent paracellular
  permeability via the pore pathway. Downregulation of claudin-2 expression has also
  been reported with STAT1 and STAT3 siRNA intervention. Levels of barrier-sealing
  claudins are suggested to return to normal levels during remission of inflammation.
