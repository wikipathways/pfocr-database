caption: 'Potential mechanisms underlying altered CCC expression and function in HD.
  (1) Impaired K + homeostasis in astrocytes leads to local increases in extracellular
  [K+. Since Cl– extrusion via KCC2 is driven by the K+ concentration gradient, small
  changes in extracellular K+ concentration (such as during sustained neuronal activity
  or neuronal excitability due increases in extracellular K+), can therefore (2) lead
  to reversal in the direction of ion transport to mitigate neuronal K+-mediated excitability.
  (3) Inflammatory-mediated upregulation of NKCC1 expression. NKCC1 transcripts are
  upregulated by the release of pro-inflammatory mediators released by activated microglia
  such as pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), which
  mediated by the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)
  pathway. (4) Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity leads to calpain-mediated degradation
  of KCC2. Enhanced glutamate signaling leads to NMDA-mediated excitotoxic effects,
  resulting in increased Ca2+ influx. (5) Calcium-dependent protease, calpain, is
  well-studied in HD and is a strong negative regulator of KCC2 expression via cleavage
  of the C-terminal tail of KCC2 to reduce KCC2 expression. (6) Altered interaction
  between KCC2 and (m)Htt. Htt and KCC2 interaction is altered in either a gain-of-function
  or loss-of-function manner. The former would lead to greater/tighter binding of
  mHtt and KCC2 and as mHtt forms cellular aggregates, enhanced binding would result
  in reduced KCC2 from the surface membrane to reduce KCC2 activity. mHtt sequestering
  KCC2 may occur indirectly, via protein kinase C and casein kinase II substrate in
  neurons (PACSIN1). PACSIN1 is known to be sequestered in mHtt aggregates and also
  forms strong interactions with KCC2, pulling KCC2 from the membrane to restrict
  surface expression. Alternatively, Htt may play some role in stabilizing KCC2 in
  the membrane, a function that may be lost with mHTT protein. (7) Reduced KCC2 function
  due to decrease in Brain-type creatine kinase (CKB) activity. CKB is an important
  player in regenerating of ATP through the phosphocreatine-creatine kinase system.
  The downregulation of CKB is well described as mHtt suppresses the activity of the
  promoter of the CKB gene, lowering somatic CKB expression in HD mice and human patients.
  CKB is a strong positive modulator of KCC2 activity, therefore KCC2 and Cl– dysregulation
  could be a result of the progressive downregulation of CKB in HD. CKB may enhance
  KCC2 in two ways: (i) CKB regenerates ATP required to regenerate the K+ gradients
  that drive KCC2 Cl– extrusion (via Na+/K+ ATPase) and (ii) CKB is known to phosphorylate
  KCC2 through its capacity to autophosphorylate. (8) Reduced transcription of KCC2
  via pathological entry of REST/NRSF into the nucleus. Normal Htt binds to REST/NRSF
  from binding and reducing transcripts containing DNA repressor element (RE1) also
  referred to as neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) sequences, which is recognized
  by the transcriptional silencer RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST), also
  known as neuronal restrictive silencing factor, (NRSF). Normal Htt promotes transcription
  of RE-1-containing transcripts by sequestering REST/NRSF in the cytoplasm. In contrast,
  mHtt allows entry of REST/NRSF into the nucleus, which may reduce KCC2 transcripts.
  (9) Altered BDNF-TrkB signaling leads to altered KCC2 activity. The regulatory effects
  of BDNF on KCC2 expression and function are dependent on activity and developmental
  stage. BDNF-TrkB signaling in immature neurons leads to the upregulation of KCC2
  via ERK1/2 signaling, while in mature neurons BDNF-TrkB- mediated activation of
  the Ras/MAPK pathways leads to downregulation of KCC2. The underlying mechanism
  between BDNF-TrkB signaling on KCC2 expression in the context of HD remain unclear,
  however, it may be possible that there is a reversion to a neuronal immature state
  in order to “reboot” the system, leading to different regulatory effects of BDNF-TrkB
  on KCC2. Created with BioRender.com.'
