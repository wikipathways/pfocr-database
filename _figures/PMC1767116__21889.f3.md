caption: Schematic of mitochondrial death signalling pathways. Anti-apoptotic members
  of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-X, are located on the mitochondrial outer
  membrane. Here they act to prevent the release of apoptogenic factors from the inner
  mitochondrial space. Binding of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bid (after cleavage by
  caspase 8) or Bad (after dephosphorylation) to Bcl-2 mitigates the protective effect
  of Bcl-2 and triggers release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO. Cytochrome c, in
  concert with the adapter protein apaf-1 and caspase 9, activates caspase 3 and the
  downstream caspase cascade. Smac/DIABLO inhibits IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins),
  which in turn inhibit caspase activities, thus propagating apoptosis. Stimuli such
  as growth factor withdrawal or activation of p53 and Fas activation in type II cells
  act through this mitochondrial pathway.
