caption: 'Extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-EVs) modulate liver
  regeneration by regulating pathways involved in liver fibrosis development. EVs’
  content is rich in proteins, lipids, mRNA and microRNA. MSC-EVs may act in two distinct
  ways: Green—Inhibition of: TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, Wnt/β-catenin pathway,
  hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation, hepatocyte apoptosis, inflammatory factors
  secretion, collagen deposition; Red—Activation of: autophagy and hepatocyte proliferation.
