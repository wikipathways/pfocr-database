caption: 'Eosinophilic asthma inflammatory pathways. There are two aetiologies for
  eosinophilic inflammation in asthma: an allergic pathway triggered by allergens
  and a non-allergic mechanism triggered by microbes, pollutants and glycolipids.
  The key mediators in the pathways are depicted below. Eosinophils release cationic
  proteins, which lead to bronchial epithelial tissue damage, thus causing airways
  hyper-responsiveness. Eosinophils also lead to airway smooth muscle cell proliferation
  through increased eosinophils adhesion caused by the release of cationic proteins
  and the eosinophilic effect on transforming growth factor-β1 and gene coding of
  wingless/integrase-1 signaling. IL-13 triggers mucus hyper-secretion. Figure created
