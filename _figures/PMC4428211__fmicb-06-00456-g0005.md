caption: Metabolic pathways potentially involved in the regulation of microcystin
  biosynthesis. Nitrogen metabolism and acquisition, photosynthesis/carbon regulation,
  and iron uptake have been previously implicated as pathways involved in microcystin
  expression. NtcA is a major global regulator that links them together. If there
  is an excess of carbon (either from nitrogen starvation or replete carbon fixation),
  the buildup of 2-oxoglutarate triggers ntcA to turn on nitrogen uptake systems,
  such as nitrate uptake (nrtA) or nitrogen fixation (hetR, dotted line pathway),
  and inhibit carbon fixation. Additionally, NtcA has been shown to bind to the microcystin
  operon at an mcyA/D transcriptional start. Other potential start sites exist in
  the operon for both iron and light regulation.
