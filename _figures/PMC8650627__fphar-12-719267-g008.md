caption: The possible targets/pathways underlying protective effect of ELZC for ARHL.
  Blue diamond nodes represent each herb of the ELZC. The pink nodes represent candidate
  active compound and node size is proportional to their degree. The yellow nodes
  represent target of ELZC acting on ARHL, the red nodes represent key targets. Blue
  triangle nodes represent the main pathway enrichment. Edges represent interaction
  among botanical drugs, target, signaling pathway, and functional modules.
