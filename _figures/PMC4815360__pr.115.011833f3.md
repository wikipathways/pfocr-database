caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrating synthesis of ET peptides and interaction
  with receptors. ET isoforms are synthesized by a three-step process: Messenger RNA
  encodes a prepro-peptide that after a proteolytic cleavage initial of the signal
  peptidase to yield the propeptide is further cleaved by furin to Big ET precursors.
  Synthesis of ET-1 has been studied in the most detail. Transformation to the mature,
  biologically active ET-1 is mainly by the action of ECE-1 at pH 7 but also by ECE-2
  at pH 5.5 within endothelial cells. On release from endothelial cells, about one
  in five molecules of Big ET-1 escape conversion but further processing to ET-1 may
  occur by smooth muscle ECE or via alternative pathways catalyzed by chymase for
  ET-1. It is inferred that ET-2 from endothelial cells is synthesized by a similar
  pathway. ET-3 is not released from human endothelial cells but is also synthesized
  in other cells by ECE-1 with evidence for an additional pathway, KELL. ET-1 is metabolized
  by NEP to inactive metabolites. ETs mediate their actions via two GPCRs ETA or ETB
  and the recommended agonists and antagonists that are most widely used are indicated
  together with ECE inhibitors.'
