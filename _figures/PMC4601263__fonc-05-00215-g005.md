caption: CLN3 and sphingolipid signaling pathway interactions analyzed using Pathway
  Studio. Pathway Studio analysis was used to create a network of biologically relevant
  genes involved in sphingolipid metabolism and CLN3 for comparisons in normal vs.
  tumor samples. The position of the node represents the subcellular localization
  of the gene product. Lines represent type of relations that were automatically extracted
  from the literature. A total of five genes were represented in the network, with
  a number of focus genes with functions relating to sphingolipid metabolism.
