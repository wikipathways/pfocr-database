caption: Downstream signalling of wild-type ALK, mutant active ALK, and NPM–ALK. Wild-type
  ALK activation is dependent on ligand binding, leading to activation and transphosphorylation
  of tyrosine residues in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain. Phosphorylated tyrosines
  (pY) can function as docking sites for downstream targets, e.g., Shc and p55γ. p55γ
  is a regulatory subunit of PI3K and its activation leads to increased phosphorylation
  of AKT. Binding of Shc to pY-ALK leads to activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway and
  increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Both pathways are used as readouts of ALK activity.
  Mutations in the ALK tyrosine kinase domain can lead to constitutively active ALK
  independent of ligand binding. In neuroblastoma cells, mutated ALK may lead to increased
  STAT3 phosphorylation. In addition, in neuroblastoma cell lines with elevated active
  ALK, increased levels of phospho-tyrosine GSK3 have been shown. NPM–ALK fusions
  are found in anaplastic large cell lymphoma. NPM–ALK activity is dependent on the
  dimerisation of the fusion protein NPM. Similar to wild-type ALK, dimerisation leads
  to auto-phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domain. IRS1, Shc, PLC-γ, GBR2, and
  RAS have been shown to directly bind to NPM–ALK, which leads to activation of the
  MAPK/ERK pathway. In addition, NPM–ALK has been shown to directly bind and phosphorylate
  STAT3. In contrast to wild-type ALK, NPM–ALK has been shown to favourably bind to
  p85, a regulatory subunit of PI3K, and thereby activate the PI3K/AKT pathway.

  description: Downstream signalling of wild-type ALK, mutant active ALK, and NPM–ALK.
    Wild-type ALK activation is dependent on ligand binding, leading to activation
    and transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain.
    Phosphorylated tyrosines (pY) can function as docking sites for downstream targets,
    e.g., Shc and p55γ. p55γ is a regulatory subunit of PI3K and its activation leads
    to increased phosphorylation of AKT. Binding of Shc to pY-ALK leads to activation
    of the MAPK/ERK pathway and increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Both pathways
    are used as readouts of ALK activity. Mutations in the ALK tyrosine kinase domain
    can lead to constitutively active ALK independent of ligand binding. In neuroblastoma
    cells, mutated ALK may lead to increased STAT3 phosphorylation. In addition, in
    neuroblastoma cell lines with elevated active ALK, increased levels of phospho-tyrosine
    GSK3 have been shown. NPM–ALK fusions are found in anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
    NPM–ALK activity is dependent on the dimerisation of the fusion protein NPM. Similar
