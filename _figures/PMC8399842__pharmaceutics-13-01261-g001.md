caption: 'Illustration of intestinal CYP3A4 regulation and the effect of its content
  and activity variation on orally administered drugs. Top left: CYP3A4 ligands belong
  to BDDCS Class 1 and Class 2 with varied solubilities and extensive metabolism,
  highlighted by the black rectangle; Bottom panel: intra-enterocytic CYP3A4 regulation
  by endogenous factors under disease conditions and xenobiotics from oral intake
  (e.g., drugs or food constituents). Normally, a PXR ligand enters the enterocyte
  and binds to PXR intracellularly. This then dimerizes with retinoid X receptor (RXR)
  and binds to the xenobiotic response enhancer module (XREM) to upregulate the CYP3A4
  gene. Systemic inflammatory conditions such as cancer, infection and obesity increase
  circulating cytokines, such as IL-6, which activate the STAT3-MAPK pathway to downregulate
  CYP3A4 gene regulation. Intra- and inter-individual CYP3A4 variation can cause varied
  drug clearance, resulting in undesirable toxicity and ineffective therapy of drugs
  with a narrow therapeutic index. Abbreviation: RXR, retinoid X receptor; XREM, xenobiotic
  response enhancer module (XREM); STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription-3;
  MAPK: a family of signaling cascade including Jun N-terminal kinase and mitogen-activated
  protein kinase 1 pathways.'
