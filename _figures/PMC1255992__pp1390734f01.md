caption: Schematic representation of the sterol biosynthesis pathway in plants. Only
  the upper part of the pathway from the first cyclic precursor, cycloartenol, to
  the first branch point represented by 24-methylenelophenol is presented. Sterol
  molecules are labeled with their common names (see sterol nomenclature in “Materials
  and Methods”). Enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway are mentioned, and the
  corresponding genes identified by mutants, when characterized, are shown in italics
  underneath. The sterol C14-demethylation step is boxed.
