caption: The pathogenesis of alcoholic hepatitis involves the interplay of multiple
  complex mechanisms. A. Chronic alcohol use causes changes in the gut microbiome
  composition (dysbiosis) and breakdown of gut barrier function. LPS and other bacterial
  products can potently activate the innate immune system and are collectively called
  Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). Increased gut permeability allows
  for the translocation of bacteria and PAMPs to the liver via splanchnic vasculature.
  Multiple therapeutics, including antibiotics, fecal transplantation, bovine colostrum,
  and hyperimmunized bovine colostrum IMM-124E target dysbiosis and reduce endotoxemia.
  B. Excessive alcohol consumption leads to liver injury by multiple mechanisms. The
  toxic metabolites of ethanol, particularly acetaldehyde, cause direct hepatocyte
  oxidative injury as well as injury via formation of protein/DNA adducts. Ethanol
  metabolites also cause mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid peroxidation which leads
  to steatosis. Activated immune cells induce cell-mediated cytotoxicity by release
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS), further exacerbating oxidative injury. Antioxidants
  have been trialed in alcoholic hepatitis to attenuate oxidative stress. Zinc, in
  addition to being an antioxidant, is also protective against mitochondrial dysfunction
  and apoptosis. Cholestasis is another target for alcoholic hepatitis therapy. Obeticholic
  acid (OCA) is currently in trial as an agonist to the farnesoid X receptor (FXR),
  which has activity against bile synthesis. The injured liver has two different clinical
  outcomes, cell death and organ failure vs. liver regeneration and recovery. Hepatocyte
  injury activates apoptosis and necrosis pathways and releases Damage-Associated
  Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), which are cell derived molecules capable of activating
  the immune system. Emricasan and Selonsertib are two inhibitors to apoptosis signaling
  studied in alcoholic hepatitis. Liver injury also stimulates liver regeneration.
  Many cytokines, including TNFα and Interleukin-6 (IL-6), are potent activators of
  liver regeneration. Another cytokine, IL-22, has also been shown to stimulate liver
  regeneration. Growth colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and its derivative pegylated
  G-CSF have shown promising results in multiple early clinical trials. C. The accumulation
  of DAMPs and PAMPs in the liver activates resident liver immune cells, particularly
  Kupffer cells, by activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs). Receptor activation enhances NFκB
  signaling and results in expression of pro-inflammatory molecules, including IL-1β.
  Pro-IL-1β undergo cleavage by caspase-1, which is activated by the inflammasome
  complex, to become activated IL-1β. An inhibitor to IL-1β, Anakinra, is currently
  studied in clinical trials. TNFα inhibitors, including Infliximab, have been tested
  in clinical trials. Pentoxifylline is another extensively studied compound in the
  treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. It suppresses NFκB signaling and reduces the production
  of cytokines, including TNFα. Chemokine receptors, such as C-C chemokine receptors
  (CCRs), promote inflammatory signaling via stimulation of the NFκB pathway, and
  a CCR2/CCR5 inhibitor, Cenicriviroc, has been proposed as another target for alcoholic
  hepatitis therapy. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released by Kupffer cells
  and other liver cells recruit circulating immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes
  and promote chemotaxis and infiltration into liver parenchyma. Immune cell infiltration
  causes secondary cell-mediated injury to the liver parenchymal cells by oxidative
  injury as described above.
