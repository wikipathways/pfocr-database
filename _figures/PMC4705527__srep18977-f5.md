caption: Four steps are involved in the biosynthesis of xiamenmycin (bottom of the
  panel), and the direct precursors, which are biosynthesized from shikimate biosynthesis
  (orange box), the non-mevalonate pathway (red box) and threonine biosynthesis (blue
  box), are mapped. The central carbon metabolism for S. xiamenensis 318 is illustrated
  in the schematic diagram by arrows and includes glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the
  citric acid cycle (purple box), the pentose phosphate pathway (yellow box), the
  glyoxylate shunt (purple box), ubiquinone biosynthesis (green box), amino acid (i.e.,
  glycine, serine, threonine, methionine, aspartate, alanine) metabolism (blue box),
  purine (GTP) synthesis (light purple box) and one carbon pool (pink box). The other
  multiple reactions involved in the synthesis of pyrimidine, fatty acid, histidine,
  tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, leucine, isoleucine, valine, and arginine
  synthesis, and the synthesis of amino sugars are summarized as one step, which is
  marked by hollow arrows. The details of the reactions and metabolites are presented
  in .
