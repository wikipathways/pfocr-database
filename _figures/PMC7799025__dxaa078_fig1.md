caption: IL-6 receptor and signaling. (A) IL-6 binding induces a hexameric complex
  composed of two molecules of IL-6, IL-6Rα and gp130 each, leading to the activation
  of JAKs associated with gp130 at Box1 and Box2. The phosphorylation of tyrosine
  759 of gp130 is required for the gp130-mediated ERK–MAPK pathway via SHP2 and GAB
  adaptor molecules and essential for the SOCS3-mediated negative feedback loop. The
  distal four tyrosine residues of gp130 (Y767, Y814, Y905 and Y915) form a YXXQ motif,
  which is required for STAT3 activation. The YAP–Notch pathway is triggered by Yes.
  TRAF is associated with gp130 and inhibits the STAT3 signaling pathway. MiR-135a
  and miR-337-3p down-regulate JAK2 and STAT3, respectively. PIAS directly inhibits
  STAT3. All amino acid positions are of human gp130. (B) Three modes of gp130-mediated
  signaling. IL-6 acts on cells expressing both IL-6Rα and gp130 (classical signaling).
  The complex of IL-6 and sIL-6Rα acts like a novel cytokine on cells expressing only
  gp130 (trans-signaling). In the trans-presentation mode, IL-6 bound to IL-6Rα expressed
  on one type of cell acts on another cell type expressing gp130.
