caption: The significance of endothelial cell-derived GABA for brain development.
  (A) Summary schema depicting a novel positive feedback GABA signaling pathway in
  telencephalic endothelial cells. Endothelial GABA activates GABAA receptors, triggering
  Ca2+ influx and endothelial cell proliferation. Endothelial GABAA receptor β3 subunit
  can regulate GABA expression. VGAT is the primary mechanism for GABA release from
  telencephalic endothelial cells. Endothelial GABA release is essential for both
  angiogenesis and GABAergic neuronal migration in the embryonic telencephalon. (B)
  Current concepts depict the source of GABA in the embryonic telencephalon as neuronal.
  (C) Our studies show that the GABA balance in the embryonic telencephalon is maintained
  by both endothelial cells and neurons. Neuronal GABA cannot compensate for the loss
  of endothelial GABA. Tipping the balance to cause partial or complete loss of endothelial
  GABA can result in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric diseases such as autism, epilepsy,
  schizophrenia, anxiety and depression.
