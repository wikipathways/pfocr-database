caption: 'Functions of proteins implicated in cell wall-related signaling and development.
  Receptor-like proteins and extracellular proteins are shown that have a function
  in cell wall sensing and/or signaling. From left to right: FEI1 and FEI2 are LRR-containing
  RLKs that influence cellulose content and act in a linear pathway with the GPI-anchored
  SOS5. A direct interaction, however, has so far not been shown. THE1 senses cellulose
  deficiencies and, under these conditions, induces changes in cell wall structures.
  COBRA is a GPI-anchored membrane-associated protein important for the orientation
  of cellulose microfibrils. WAK1 binds GRP3, a Gly-rich protein, and both WAK1 and
  WAK2 are able to interact with pectin. WAK2 activates MAPK3 and thus possibly other
  MAPKs and induces a vacuolar invertase to modify turgor pressure. The membrane-associated
  PERK4 interacts with pectin and activates Ca2+ channels, leading to increased cytosolic
  Ca2+ content, which can induce changes in intracellular and extracellular pH and
  the NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent production of ROS. The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide
  is a cell-adhesion motif and is bound by at least one LecRK. AGPs are GPI-anchored
  membrane-associated proteins implicated in cell wall-related signaling. LRX1 is
  an extracellular receptor binding an unknown interactor and is insolubilized in
  the cell wall. ANX1 and ANX2 are important for pollen tube rupture involving sudden
  changes in the cell wall. The TOR kinase is central to the TOR pathway that also
  influences cell wall structure, by a so far unknown mechanism. Solid, double-arrowed
  lines indicate experimentally shown interactions or signaling outputs; dashed arrows
  indicate possible, but not experimentally shown, interactions. Wavy lines represent
  GPI anchors. [See online article for color version of this figure.]'
