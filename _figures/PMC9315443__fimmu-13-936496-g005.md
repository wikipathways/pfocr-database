caption: Representative designs of CARs with co-stimulatory domains. Diagrams of CARs
  with co-stimulatory domains. 1) Co-expressing 4-1BBL and CD28 could recruit the
  host immune response against the tumor through the IRF7/IFN-β pathway. 2) TLR could
  combine MyD88 to activate NF-κB. 3) MyD88/CD40 promoted T-cell proliferation. 4)
  ICOS increased the production of IL-17 and enhanced the survival of T cells. 5)
  CD27-based CAR-T cells secreted Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2) and were
  resistant to apoptosis. Figure created using BioRender.com.
