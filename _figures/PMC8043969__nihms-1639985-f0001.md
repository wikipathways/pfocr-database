caption: 'Molecular mechanisms by which germline variants may associate with outcome.(A)
  Germline variants increase the likelihood of a somatic mutation in the wild type
  allele of the same gene: a germline variant in RB1 increases the likelihood of a
  somatic mutation in the other allele of RB1 leading to retinoblastoma (shown here
  by the clinical sign of leukocoria).(B) Germline variants increase specific types
  of genome wide mutations: germline variants in MBD4 are associated with elevated
  C>T somatic mutations at CpG dinucleotides, consistent with the role of MBD4 in
  correcting G:T mismatches.(C) Germline variants are associated with specific transcriptome
  alterations: a germline variant in the Ras signaling gene GRB2 is associated with
  upregulation of Ras target genes.(D) Molecularly, germline variants may alter the
  function of tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes through amino acid changes.(E) Germline
  variants act as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in cis: a germline variant
  in the putative regulatory element of the tumor suppressor gene CTSW is associated
  with increased expression of this tumor suppressor gene.(F) Germline variants increase
  the likelihood of additional somatic mutations in the same pathway: germline variants
  in GNA11, an activator of mTOR signaling, promote the acquisition of somatic mutations
  in PTEN, a tumor suppressor that suppresses mTOR signaling.(G) Germline variants
  perturb splicing machinery: germline variants in RBFOX1, an RNA binding protein
  involved in splicing, are associated with increased somatic mutations in SF3B1,
  another component of the spliceosome, leading to varied splicing patterns.'
