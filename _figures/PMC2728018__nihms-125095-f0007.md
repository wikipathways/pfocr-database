caption: (A) Tumor cells increase their production of GSH to counter mitochondrially
  derived oxidants such as O2•− and H2O2. To sustain GSH production, cancer cells
  divert metabolites away from the methionine cycle into the transsulfuration pathway,
  resulting in decreased SAM production. (B) Aberrant production of oxidants creates
  an atypical redox state by decreasing the GSH/GSSG ratio which affects the activities
  of SAM synthetases, DNMTs and HMTs. (C) The increased Glc (glucose) consumption
  of the Warburg effect decreases the NAD+/NADH ratio and produces Pyr (pyruvate).
  Decreasing this ratio creates an environment that inhibits the activity of sirtuins,
  and liberates genes from their negative regulation. (D) Oxidation of glutamine (Gln),
  and dysfunctional electron transport, alters the flow of α-KG (α-ketoglutarate)
  and Suc (succinate) metabolites within the Krebs cycle. These metabolites can then
  influence transcription in the nucleus by affecting the activity of KDMs (lysine
  demethylases).
