caption: 'TGF-β receptor signals through multiple signaling cascades. TGF-β activates
  Smad and non-Smad pathways. The ligand-activated TGFβRI and TGFβRII receptor complex
  recruits and phosphorylates the receptor specific R-Smads. The R-Smads are presented
  to the TGFβRI by a membrane-bound protein, SARA. R-Smad proteins are cytoplasmic
  molecules which, after receptor activation, associate with Co-Smad. Hetero-oligomeric
  complex of R-Smad-Co-Smad translocates to the nucleus and binds to specific DNA
  sequence and interacts with transcription factors (TF) and Co-factors (CF) to regulate
  transcription. R-Smads and Co-Smad shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. The pathway
  is negatively regulated by the I-Smads which binds activated TGFβRI, thereby preventing
  phosphorylation of R-Smads, or recruits the E3 ubiquitine ligases, Smurf1 and Smurf2
  to induce proteosomal degradation of the R-Smads. STRAP interacts with TGFβRI and
  TGFβRII and with I-Smad, thus stabilizing the interaction of I-Smad with the receptor
  complex. Activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and other tyrosine
  kinase receptors, interferon (IFN)-γ signaling, and activation of NF-κB by tumor-necrosis
  factor (TNF)-α, also induce I-Smad expression, leading to inhibition of TGF-β signaling.
  Although the mechanism of activation of non-Smad pathways by the receptor complex
  remains largely unknown, these pathways are known to be involved in the pro-oncogenic
  responses to TGF-β in cooperation with or without Smad pathway. The activated receptor
  complex activates non-Smad signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt, Rho/Rac GTPases
  and Ras/MAPK and TAK1/MEKK1. TAK1 (TGF-β activated kinase 1) may mediate TGF-β effects
  with respect to the activation of distinct MAP kinase pathways (JNK, p38). TGF-β
  also induces activation of the Cdc42 GTPase which stimulates p21 activated kinase
  (PAK) downstream from Rac and Cdc42. TGF-β activation of PP2A, that inhibits S6K
  activity through the mTOR/FRAPPP2A-S6K pathway, mediates Smad-independent growth
  suppression. SBE: Smad binding element and TBE: Transcription factor binding element.'
