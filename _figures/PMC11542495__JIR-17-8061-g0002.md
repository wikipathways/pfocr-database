caption: 'The schematic diagram of Nrf2 and Keap1 domain structure: Nrf2, is a transcription
  factor characterized by multiple functional domains, including Neh2, Neh4, Neh5,
  Neh6, Neh7, Neh1, and Neh3. Neh2 interacts with the Kelch domain of Keap1 through
  DLG and ETGE motifs, while Neh4, Neh5, and Neh3 engage with co-activators to enhance
  transcriptional activity. Neh7 serves as a negative regulatory domain, and Neh6
  is critical for the recognition of Nrf2 by GSK-3/β-TrCP, facilitating its degradation
  via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Neh1 is responsible for binding to DNA, thereby
  regulating gene expression. Keap1, contains several functional domains, including
  the N-terminal region (NTR), BTB, IVR, Kelch domain, and CTR. Keap1 interacts with
  Nrf2 through its Kelch domain and mediates Nrf2 ubiquitination via CUL3, leading
  to its degradation. The BTB domain binds to CUL3 and promotes the dimerization of
  Keap1, thereby forming an effective ubiquitin ligase complex'
