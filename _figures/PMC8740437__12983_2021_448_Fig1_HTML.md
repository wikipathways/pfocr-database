caption: The multi-directional role of mitochondria during cold stress. The mitochondria
  are both the target of cold stress and the central hub that coordinates the cell
  response to it. During cold stress, the energy metabolism of these organelles changes
  in order to maintain the functionality of the entire cell. Insects faced with cold
  stress change their cellular metabolism, which often results in increased accumulation
  of ROS by mitochondria. Consequently, the mitochondrial antioxidant system during
  cold stress is modulated to counteract the negative effects of cold-associated ROS
  formation []. It is also increasingly obvious that the mitochondrial integrity and
  cellular signaling associated with mitochondria are essential for sustaining ion
  and energetic homeostasis of the cell and its survival []. Tight regulation of apoptosis
  by mitochondrial pathway is essential for survival as the stimulated activity of
  caspases is not solely the indicator of apoptosis but besides, it demonstrates nonapoptotic
  functions i.e., control of a cell shape, cell migration or proliferation. Mitochondria
  may also take part in heat dissipation which is caused by uncoupling of the respiration
  by these organelles []. If these mechanisms fail to adapt the cell to prevail the
  cold stress and the accumulation of cold-injuries is increasing, the mitochondria
  commence the processes leading to the programmed cell death pathway via apoptosis
  to utilize and recycle damaged cells and their components []. Green arrows indicate
  mitochondria regulated processes leading to the cell survival pathway, whereas red
  arrows processes leading to cell death
