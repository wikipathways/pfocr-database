caption: Viral and Cancer RNA vaccine mechanism. (1) The viral Ag, TAA or TSA-encoding
  mRNA enters the APC and then the cytosol following endosomal escape. (2) The mRNA
  is translated by the host ribosomal machinery into the encoded Ag, which is then
  either (3A) degraded by the proteasome and enters the endogenous MHC I pathway;
  (3B) exocytosed from the APC via the secretory pathway; or (3C) enters the autophagic
  pathway and is internalized by an autophagosome. (4A) Proteasome-mediated degradation
  yields fragments (blue), including the epitope (yellow). Following secretion, the
  Ag either (4B) enters an APC via endocytosis and then the exogenous MHC II pathway;
  or (4C) the native antigen will circulate through the lymphatic system to secondary
  lymphoid organs. (5A) The epitope binds MHC I at the rough endoplasmic reticulum
  (RER) and traffics to the cell membrane for surface presentation via the secretory
  pathway. (5B) The Ag, internalized via endocytosis or processed by autophagy, is
  digested into fragments, including the epitope (red), via lysosome-mediated degradation.
  (6) The epitope binds MHC II and displaces class-II associated invariant chain peptide
  (CLIP), and the complex then traffics to the membrane for surface presentation.
  (7) The APCs migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, including the lymph node. The
  APCs present the epitope-loaded MHC I and MHC II complexes to activate naive CD8
  and CD4 T cells, respectively, and follicular DCs and subcapsular sinus (SCS) macrophages
  present the native Ag to activate naive B cells, driving plasma cell differentiation
  and Ab production. This figure was created with BioRender.com.
