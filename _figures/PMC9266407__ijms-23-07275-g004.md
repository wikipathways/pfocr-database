caption: Visualization of the gene expression changes for M0 macrophages derived from
  THP-1 cells exposed to Perfectha® filler extracts on the cell cycle pathway. Cells
  were exposed for 24 h to extracts of the various HA fillers. At 24 h, the cells
  were harvested and RNA isolated for cDNA preparation and microarray gene analysis.
