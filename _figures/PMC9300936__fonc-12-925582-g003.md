caption: Cellular pathways and genes involved in hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma
  (PGL/PCC) syndrome and Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease. Approximately 40% of all
  cases of PGL/PCC cases are associated with germline pathogenic variants in the pseudo-hypoxic
  signaling pathway (Cluster I), kinase signaling (Cluster II), or Wingless and Int-1
  (Wnt) signaling (Cluster III). Pathogenic variants in the SDHx genes (SDHA, SDHB,
  SDHC, and SDHD) and VHL gene are classified under the Cluster I genes. The SDH complex
  plays an important role in energy metabolism through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle. Both VHL and SDHx encode for proteins that target the protein HIF1-α for
  degradation. Pathogenic loss of function variants in VHL and SDHx genes leads to
  abnormal accumulation of HIF1-α and upregulation of downstream pathways, which results
  in increased expression of various proteins and augmentation of the Warburg effect.
  These negative effects may be mitigated by novel therapies such as HIF2-α inhibitors
  (e.g Belzutifan).
