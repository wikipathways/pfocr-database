caption: Working model displaying current knowledge of the influences of metabolism
  in cardiomyocyte proliferation. Conditions of high oxygen tension, high reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) levels, and high rates of fatty acid and succinate oxidation
  impede cardiomyocyte proliferation. Conversely, hypoxia and associated upregulation
  of Hif1α support high rates of glycolysis, which appears to be required for myocyte
  division. Enzymes that can support biosynthetic pathways such as pyruvate kinase
  M2 (Pkm2) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (Pck2) have been shown to augment
  cardiomyocyte proliferative capacity. Other processes related to biosynthesis, such
  as the mevalonate pathway, protein O-GlcNAcylation, and NAD+ biosynthesis also appear
  to support a proliferative cardiomyocyte phenotype.
