caption: Production of acetyl-CoA for acetylation is regulated by ATP-citrate lyase
  (ACL), in a manner dependent on the availability of mitochondria-derived citrate.
  Both N-linked glycosylation and O-GlcNAcylation of proteins relies on production
  of UDP-GlcNAc by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway.
