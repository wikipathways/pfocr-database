caption: Neural stem cells (NSCs) express astrocytic genes in response to several
  signaling molecules, including bone morphogenic protein (BMP) families, the leukemia
  inhibitory factor/ciliary neurotrophic factor (LIF/CNTF), and Notch pathway. BMPs
  signal primarily through SMAD, whereas LIF/CNTF activates the JAK/STAT pathways.
  The active SMAD–STAT complex bridged by p300 goes directly into the nucleus, binds
  to the promoter, and activates astrocytic genes such as GFAP and S100. Another important
  pathway that regulates astrocytogenesis is the Notch pathway. Notch ligands will
  activate Notch receptors and activate the expression of Hes genes, Hes1/5. Hes1,
  Hes5, and activated forms of Notch receptors induce the expression of astrocytic
  genes and glial promoting transcription factor nuclear factor-I A (NFIA). In early
  development, a pre-formed gliogenic loop serves to facilitate the association between
  sex-determining region Y-box 9 (Sox9) and brain-specific homeobox/POU domain protein
  2 (Brn2), which also drives expression of NFIA. NFIA is both necessary and sufficient
  for the induction of astrocytic genes.
