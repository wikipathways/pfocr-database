caption: Inhibition of apoptosis in Drosophila cells by DIAP1 occurs through binding
  to the initiator and effector caspases, Dronc and DrICE. Similarly, direct binding
  and inhibition of caspase-3 in mammalian cells is mediated by XIAP. Mammalian c-IAP1
  and c-IAP2 can directly bind caspases but are poor caspase inhibitors, instead acting
  to regulate apoptosis by indirectly modulating caspase-8 activity. Binding of TNF
  to its receptor results in recruitment of TRADD, RIP, and TRAF2. The cIAPs also
  participate in pro-survival signaling through TNFR by associating with TRAF2. C-IAP1
  and -2 ubiquitinate RIP1, minimizing association with caspase-8 and preventing apoptosis.
  Additionally the association of RIP, TRAF2, and cIAP1/2 leads to the activation
  of TAK and subsequent NF-κB and JNK activation, resulting in enhanced transcription
  of pro-survival genes. C-IAP1 and -2 can also inhibit NIK kinase and downstream
  processing of p100, thereby negatively regulating NF-κB activation. Thus, the effects
  of c-IAP1 and -2-dependent signaling on NF-κB are likely context dependent. A TNFR-like
  pathway regulates immune responses to microbial infection in Drosophila. Peptidoglycan
  from Gram-negative bacteria is recognized by peptidoglycan recognition proteins
  (PGRP), which can activate the IMD signaling pathway. IMD is an insect homolog of
  mammalian RIP1. Genetic studies place IMD, dFADD, Dredd and DIAP2 upstream of or
  parallel to dTAK activation. DTAK activates both the JNK and Relish pathways analogously
  to TAK1 in mammalian cells, promoting induction of anti-microbial peptide genes.
