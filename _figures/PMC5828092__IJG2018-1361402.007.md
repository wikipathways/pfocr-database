caption: The energy perturbed process in response to SD exposure and CGA intervention.
  The levels of changed metabolites in SD group compared to BP group were labeled
  with (↓) downregulated or (↑) upregulated; ∗metabolites or metabolic pathway could
  be regulated by CGA. Solid arrows represent direct connections, and dashed arrows
  represent multiple and indirect connections between two compounds. The contents
  of the blue box represent energy processes or metabolic pathways.
