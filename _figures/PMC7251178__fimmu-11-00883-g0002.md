caption: The inflammasome complex -dependent and -independent pathways involved in
  EMT. The inflammasome complex is activated after two signals (not shown), the first
  one (priming phase) that promotes the transcription of inflammasome-related proteins
  (NLRP3, Pro IL-1β, and Pro IL-18) through NF-κB, and the second one (activating
  phase) that promotes the oligomerization of the complex itself, contributing for
  the maturation of the cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 through caspase-1. Afterwards, the
  mature form of IL-1β reaches its receptor in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine
  way and promotes the transcription of the TGF-β gene. The secreted TGF-β binds to
  its receptor, triggering the pathway dependent of the Smad and promoting the EMT
  process (Left schematic cell). The pathway independent of the inflammasome oligomerization
  (right schematic cell) initiates when TGF-β reaches its receptor and, upon the Smad
  signaling, the nlrp3 expression is enhanced (black arrow). The interaction between
  the NLRP3 and the Smad3 is not fully understood and requires more studies.
