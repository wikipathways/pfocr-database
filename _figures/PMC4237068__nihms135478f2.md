caption: The impact of ketone body metabolism on brain handling of glutamate. Under
  basal conditions, glucose is the sole fuel of brain metabolism (upper half of figure).
  Glucose is converted to pyruvate via glycolysis, and pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA,
  which enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Glutamic acid is formed via transamination
  of α-ketoglutarate with aspartate. When an individual consumes a ketogenic diet
  and blood levels of 3-OH-butyrate and acetoacetate increase, the brain will consume
  these compounds as well as glucose (lower half of figure). Unlike glucose, the metabolism
  of which yields energy during conversion to pyruvate and lactate via glycolysis,
  the ketone bodies must be converted to acetyl-CoA, which is metabolized via citrate
  synthetase (acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate → citrate + CoA), thereby diminishing the
  availability of oxaloacetate for transamination of glutamate to aspartate. More
  glutamate is then available to the glutamate decarboxylase pathway for the synthesis
  of GABA in GABA-ergic neurons. In addition, in ketosis there is increased blood
  acetate (or acetylcarnitine). Astrocytes, the major site of acetate consumption,
  convert this substrate to glutamine, which can be exported to GABA-ergic neurons,
  which convert this precursor to GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter. The
  red lettering indicates pathways that are relatively more intense in ketosis, and
  the blue lettering indicates pathways that become relatively more attenuated.
