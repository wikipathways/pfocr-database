caption: Pathway analysis of genes and enzymes involved in carotenoid metabolism.
  The heat maps represent the transcript (purple-red) and metabolite (green-red) data
  (log2 scaled and mean centered). Reactions that have not been fully elucidated are
  indicated with dotted lines. Enzymes involved in the branch points in carotenoid
  metabolism are indicated with red arrows.
