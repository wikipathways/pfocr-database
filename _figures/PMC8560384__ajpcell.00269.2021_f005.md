caption: A model showing how tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) may regulate
  NFκB activation in macrophages. It is assumed that LRP1 ligands include proteins
  secreted by macrophages, a fraction of which activates cell signaling via the tPA
  cell-signaling receptor assembly, similar to tPA. This autocrine pathway, involving
  endogenously produced LRP1 ligands, suppresses NFκB activation resulting from low
  levels of activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and other proinflammatory
  receptors under basal conditions (top left). When an LRP1 antagonist such as LRP
  receptor-associated protein (RAP) is added, or when Lrp1 is silenced or deleted,
  cell-signaling via the tPA receptor assembly is aborted, eliminating its activity
  in maintaining immune quiescence and increasing NFκB activity (top right). In the
  presence of LRP1, cell-signaling via the tPA receptor assembly, triggered by endogenously
  produced ligands, is insufficient to neutralize cell-signaling activated by high
  levels of PRR agonists such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (bottom left). Under these
  conditions, NFκB activation is observed. However, if tPA is administered exogenously,
  to supplement endogenously produced ligands, even responses triggered by high levels
  of PRR agonists may be neutralized (bottom right).
