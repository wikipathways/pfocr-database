caption: 'The regulation network by ACS on the innate and adaptive immune systems
  of young rabbits. The related six immune signaling were listed as numbers ①: Toll
  and lmd signaling pathway, ②: NOD-like receptor signaling, ③: FcγR-mediated phagocytosis,
  ④: Antigen processing and presentation, ⑤: Th17 cell differentiation, ⑥: IL-17 signaling
  pathway, NOD, NOD-like receptor signaling; APC, Antigen-presenting cell; PAMP, pathogen-associated
  molecular pattern; LPS, Lipopolysaccharide; PGN, peptidoglycan'
