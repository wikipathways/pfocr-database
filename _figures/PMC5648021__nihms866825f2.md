caption: Immune cell function is a product of their metabolic state. Growth factor
  signaling, actin rearrangement, and glucose metabolism are closely intertwined.
  Actin-bound aldolase can be freed from the cytoskeleton downstream of growth factor
  signaling to mediate glycolysis. Engagement of this pathway is central to the activation
  and downstream effector functions of DCs, M1 macrophages, and T cells. T cells can
  dynamically restructure their mitochondria through processes like mitochondrial
  fission and fusion to signal changes in metabolism and to promote their long-term
  survival in the transition to memory cells.
