caption: Schematic illustration of pathways leading to stimulation of extracellular-regulated
  kinase (ERK) and AKT phosphorylation by fluoxetine in astrocytes. Fluoxetine binds
  to 5-HT2B receptors. The activation of the receptors induces protein kinase C (PKC)
  activity and increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) by Ca2+ release
  from intracellular stores. The latter activates Zn-dependent metalloproteinases
  (MMPs) and leads to shedding of growth factor(s). The released epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR) ligand stimulates phosphorylation of the EGFR. The downstream
  target of EGFR, ERK (shown in blue) is phosphorylated via the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway,
  and AKT is phosphorylated via PI3K pathway. PIK3 is also known to catalyze the formation
  of PIP3 from PIP2. During fluoxetine administration, phosphorylation of ERK and
  AKT was prevented after siRNA administration against the 5-HT2B receptor or after
  administration of inhibitors (shown in yellow) of this receptor (SB204741), of PKC
  (GF 109293X), of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (BAPTA/AM, an intracellular Ca2+
  chelator), of Zn-dependent MMPs (GM6001), of the receptor-tyrosine kinase of the
  EGFR (AG1478), of ERK phosphorylation (U0126, a mitogen-activated kinase (MEK) inhibitor)
  or of the AKT pathway (LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor). This inhibition is an indication
  of participation of all the inhibited factors in the normal signaling pathway. (Hertz
  et al., ).
