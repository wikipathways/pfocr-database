caption: The enzymatic SUMO cascade. (A) SENPs cleave off amino acids from precursor
  SUMO to produce a mature SUMO. (B) SAE1/SAE2 forms of a thioester bond between SUMO’s
  GG and catalytic cysteine residue of SAE1/2. (C) Thioester bond is formed between
  SUMO’s GG and catalytic cysteine residue of Ubc9. (D) Ubc9 catalyzes formation of
  an isopeptide bond between GG and target substrate’s lysine residue often with assistance
  of an E3 ligase. (E) SENPs deconjugate SUMO from the substrate.
