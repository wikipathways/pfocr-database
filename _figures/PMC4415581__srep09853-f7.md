caption: TIGAR functions to lower Fru-2,6-P2 levels and upregulate G6PD in cells,
  resulting in an inhibition of glycolysis and enhancement of the PPP to produce NADPH
  and ribose-5-phosphate. TIGAR reduces DNA damage and enhances DNA repair through
  increasing generation of NADPH which decreases intracellular ROS levels and ribose
  which provides materials for synthesis of nucleotides. TIGAR also promotes DNA repair
  by increasing phosphorylation of ATM through Cdk5. Thus TIGAR favors cancer cell
  survival by increasing stability of DNA.
