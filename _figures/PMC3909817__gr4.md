caption: Potential mechanisms of TGF-β-induced upregulation of Nox4 gene expression.
  (A) TGF-β may stimulate Nox4 expression via the classical Smad2/3 pathway and activation
  of the PI3K pathway. (B) A putative Smad binding motif (boxed) is present in the
  Nox4 gene promoter region, which is conserved in human, mouse and rat.
