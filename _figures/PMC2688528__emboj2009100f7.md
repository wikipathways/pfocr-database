caption: 'The model of stress -signalling to PRC1: In the nucleus of resting cells,
  a sub-population of MK2 (and MK3) is associated to PRC1 via specific interaction
  to Edr2 (and/or Edr1). A distinct, probably more abundant sub-population of MK2
  (and MK3) exists in complex with p38α (or p38β). On stimulation of the p38 pathway,
  p38 is phosphorylated by MKK3 or MKK6 and, in turn, phosphorylates MK2 (and MK3).
  As a result of phosphorylation, the p38/MK2 complex becomes unstable (), the nuclear
  export signal of MK2 is unmasked (; ) and the sub-population of MK2 formerly bound
  to p38 is exported to the cytoplasm meeting its substrates such as Hsp25 and mRNA-binding
  proteins as tristetraprolin (TTP) (). Activated p38 may partially leave the nucleus
  (), but also remains in the nucleus to phosphorylate transcription factors, such
  as ATF2 () or MEF2 (), as well as PRC1-bound MK2/3. Activation of PRC-bound MK2/3
  by p38 leads to phosphorylation of components of PRC1, such as Bmi1 (), and contributes
  to chromatin remodelling. Black balls symbolize phosphorylations.'
