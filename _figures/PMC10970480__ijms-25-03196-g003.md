caption: 'The potential mechanisms by which exercise intervenes in insulin resistance
  through mitochondria-associated membranes. Mechanisms of exercise intervention on
  insulin resistance(IR) via mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs)-Ca2+ pathway:
  (1) Exercise stimulation triggers a mechanism that repairs MAMs structure, leading
  to an increase in MAMs-associated Ca2+ channels within cells, promoting mitochondrial
  Ca2+ absorption, and inhibiting cytoplasmic Ca2+ deposition, thereby alleviating
  IR. (2) Exercise directly upregulates the expression of MAMs-associated Ca2+ channel
  proteins (IP3Rs/RyRs/MCU), promoting mitochondrial Ca2+ absorption, decreasing cytoplasmic
  Ca2+ deposition, and alleviating IR. (3) Exercise activates the MAMs-related Ca2+
  signaling pathway (G protein/IP3/IP3R), induces Ca2+ signal transduction, promotes
  GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, and enhances muscle glucose uptake,
  thus alleviating IR. Mechanisms of exercise intervention on IR via MAMs-lipid homeostasis
  pathway: (1) Exercise reduces DAG levels by repairing the MAMs structure, thereby
  alleviating IR. (2) Exercise alleviates IR by promoting the restoration of the MAMs
  structure in obesity or T2DM, inhibiting TG formation. (3) Exercise alleviates IR
  by repairing the MAMs structure, alleviating ectopic deposition of ceramides in
  obese and T2DM.Mechanisms of exercise intervention on IR via MAMs-mitochondrial
  biogenesis pathway: Exercise promotes MAMs structural or functional repair by activating
  mTORC2, thereby increasing mitochondrial biogenesis caused by upregulation of PGC-1α
  expression, ultimately alleviating IR. Mechanisms of exercise intervention on IR
  via MAMs-mitochondrial dynamics pathway: (1) Exercise promotes MAMs structural repair
  by upregulating FUNDC1 expression, leading to increased Fis1 expression, inhibition
  of mitochondrial excessive fusion, and ultimately alleviation of IR. (2) Exercise
  promotes MAMs structural repair by upregulating Mfn2 expression, preventing excessive
  mitochondrial fission-induced IR. (3) Exercise alleviates high-sugar- and high-fat-induced
  IR by activating AMPK, downregulating FUNDC1 expression, inhibiting MAMs enrichment,
  preventing excessive mitochondrial fission. Mechanisms of exercise intervention
  on IR via MAMs-mitophagy path-way: (1) Exercise causes a compensatory increase in
  the formation of MAMs by upregulating the expression of FUNDC1 to obtain higher
  levels of mitophagy, thereby alleviating high-fat diet-induced IR. (2) Exercise
  promotes MAMs formation by upregulating Parkin expression, thereby enhancing mitophagy
  and alleviating IR. Mechanisms of exercise intervention on IR via MAMs-endoplasmic
  reticulum Stress pathway: Exercise alleviates IR by upregulating the expression
  of Mfn2, promoting the repair of MAMs structure to improve ERS'
