caption: Hypothetical diagram of HMGB-1-mediated enhancement of oxidative stress induced
  in late EPCs by AGEs. AGEs induced ROS production via the sirt1/p66shc pathway and
  then promoted HMGB-1 release from the late EPCs. Extracellular HMGB-1 augmented
  ROS production via binding to RAGE and signaling through the sirt1/p66shc pathway.
