caption: Her2 forms a heterodimer with Her3 (bound to its natural ligand, either heregulin
  or NRG-2). Productive dimerization causes transphosphorylation of cytoplasmic domains.
  PI3K binds the cytoplasmic domains and produces phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
  (PIP3), a small molecule that activates 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase
  1 (PDPK1). PDPK1 phosphorylates AKT at Serine 473, leading to apoptotic evasion
  and cell survival. t-Darpp and Darpp-32 activates AKT through a mechanism that is
  not yet clear, likely through PI3K signal strengthening or through another pathway
  that causes S473 phosphorylation on AKT. Another pathway activated by Her2 is the
  KRAS pathway. Here GRB2 adaptor protein activates SOS guanine nucleotide exchange
  protein to replace GDP with GTP on KRAS. KRAS instigates a cascade of phosphorylation
  reactions starting with RAF and ending in ERK, which binds to transcription factors
  and activates proliferation genes.
