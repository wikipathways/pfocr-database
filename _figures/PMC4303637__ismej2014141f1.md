  Double lines surrounding the cell depict cell membrane. Possible catabolic ATP-producing
  pathways are shown in light blue boxes, and sites of ATP production are shown in
  red. Potential substrates are shown in boxes, and include the amino acids alanine,
  valine and aspartate, the 5C-sugar ribose and polyhydroxybutyrate. AcAc, acetoacetate;
  AcAc-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA; Fdx, ferredoxin; 3-OHBut, 3-hydroxybutyrate. Electron
  transport chain components are shown in yellow. ATPase, V-type ATPase pump; CoxII,
  cytochrome oxidase subunit II; DsbD, disulfide bond oxidoreductase D; PlC, plastocyanin;
  PPase, inorganic pyrophosphatase; Thrdx, thioredoxin; Thrdx red, thioredoxin reductase.
  NADPH could potentially act as the electron donor to the ETC. Possible sites of
  NADPH production in the cell include mercuric reductase enzyme (Mer Red). All predicted
  transporters with known functions are shown. (1) Secretory pathways: components
  of the Sec pathway are shown in green, whereas components of type IV pili assembly
  are shown in orange. (2) Transporters: exporters are shown in gray including secondary
  antiporters, ABC transporters, STT3 the oligosaccharide exporter, whereas importers
  are shown in red including the facilitated transporters AmhT and CorA, the channels
  of MscS, MscL and ClC families, ABC transport systems for thiamine and sulfonate/nitrate/bicarbonate
  as well as ferrous iron transporters FeoB and Ftr1 for Fe-S assembly. AmhT, for
  ammonium; ClC, chloride channel families; CorA, for cobalt; MscL, large mechanosensitive;
  MscS, small mechanosensitive. Peptidases are shown in purple.'
