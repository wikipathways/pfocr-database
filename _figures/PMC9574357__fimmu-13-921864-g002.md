caption: 'The production and major regulatory mechanisms of Gd-IgA1. (1) B cells in
  the mucosa differentiate into IgA1-secreting plasma cells and produce IgA1 through
  class switching in a T-cell-dependent or T-cell-independent manner when stimulated
  by pathogens, such as bacterium and virus. Then, the abnormal activation of signaling
  pathways promotes the production of Gd-IgA1 through altering the expression and
  activity of the key glycosyltransferases. Potential signaling pathways involved
  are mainly below: IL-6 activates the STAT3 pathway via binding to its gp130 receptor;
  LIF binds the LIF-R/gp130 receptor and activates the STAT1 pathway; TLRs (TLR7/TLR9)
  activation induce production of IL-6 and APRIL, which function synergistically to
  promote the generation of Gd-IgA1; BAFF or APRIL signaling through the BAFF receptors,
  such as TACI, BAFF-R, BCMA prevents degradation of NF-κB and influence the O-glycosylation
  of IgA1. (2) The structure and O-glycosylation process of IgA1. IgA1 has O-glycans
  located in the unique hinge region, with 3 to 6 O-glycosylation sites consisting
  of serine or threonine residues. The low expression of GALNT2, C1GALT1, and COSMC,
  and upregulation of ST6GalNac2 can hinder the IgA1 glycosylation process, resulting
  in the exposure of terminal GalNac residues and overproduction of Gd-IgA1.'
