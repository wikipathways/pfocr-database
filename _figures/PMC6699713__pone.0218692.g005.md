caption: 'Simulations of the ecological model with 8 species were run in pairs: one
  version with a set of specialists degrading each input and intermediate metabolite
  in turn and one version with generalists with random complementary allocation of
  enzymes for each metabolic step among species (so that each enzyme summed to 1.0
  across the set of species, and enzyme allocation summed to 1 within each species).
  Parameter values were drawn from uniform distributions (between 0.13 to 1 for c,
  v and K parameters, and between 0.01 to 0.05 for D). Values for each enzyme were
  the same within a specialist versus generalist pair of simulations, but varied among
  1000 replicated runs of those pairs. Red = higher steady-state concentrations of
  a metabolite for generalists than specialists, on average across 1000 replicates.
  Blue = lower concentrations for generalists than specialists. The thickness of arrows
  is proportional to the difference in average allocation of enzyme to that step between
  the starting species of generalists and the final surviving species: values ranged
  from 0.008 for starch to malto-oligosaccharides to -0.006 for fructo-oligosaccharide
  to fructose.'
