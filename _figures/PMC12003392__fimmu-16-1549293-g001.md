caption: 'Modulation of bioenergetic pathways by M. tuberculosis: M. tuberculosis
  induces robust glycolysis in myeloid cells by increasing the uptake of glucose via
  TLR signaling. This also promotes accumulation of lactate, which is used by the
  pathogen to generate energy. Lactate also hinders M. tuberculosis growth. In response
  to this, M. tuberculosis induces expression of miR-21, that regulates the expression
  of phosphofructokinase-M (PFK-M). M. tuberculosis regulates host TCA cycle by promoting
  the expression of Irg1, which inhibits SDH. This metabolic control attenuates the
  expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine, such as IL-1β'
