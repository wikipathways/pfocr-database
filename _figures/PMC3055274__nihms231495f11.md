caption: 'UV irradiation triggers three major signaling that are relevant to present
  work: 1. It causes DNA damage and p53 activation; 2. HSF-1 activation and transcription
  of heat shock proteins such as Hsp27; 3. activation of MAP kinases. The UV-induced
  p53 is transactivated to induce its target genes such as Bax, Bcl-2, p21 etc. The
  p21 involves cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase and leads to apoptosis (cell death
  pathway). On the other hand the UV-induced Hsp27 is phosphorylated by p38MAPK/MAPKAP-2
  (also induced by UV). The p-Hsp27 plays multiple roles. It can negatively regulate
  the p53. Also the p-Hsp27 chaperones Akt and stabilizes. The Hsp27 stabilized Akt
  phosphorylates p21 and translocates it to cytoplasm, removing the cell cycle arrest
  so that the cells can actively go through the check points (cell survival pathway).
  Silencing Hsp27 makes the p53 to survive longer and continued presence of p21 in
  the nucleus for longer time, arresting cell cycle and leading to cell death. Thus
  Hsp27 is acting as switch between cell death and survival and indeed removal of
  transiently induced-Hsp27 could be an effective approach in UV-C therapy.'
