caption: Possible interactions between heat stress and defense responses in plant.
  The increased intracellular Ca2+ levels triggered by heat stress activate calmodulin
  (CaM), which is then thought to drive transcriptional reprogramming via the heat
  shock transcription factor (Hsf). Heat stress is thought to shift heat shock proteins
  (Hsps) that chaperone Resistance (R) proteins for effector--triggered immunity (ETI)
  to unfolded protein responses (UPR) in the cytoplasm, resulting in destabilized
  R proteins and impaired ETI (solid lines). The heat stress-activated CaM may also
  disrupt ETI by blocking secretory defense responses via MLO and/or by inhibiting
  transcription of EDS1 via AtSR1 (dotted lines). In the ER, high temperature is also
  thought to shift the BiP/IRE1-mediated protein folding pathway for heat stress responses,
  resulting in reduced PM delivery or secretion of defense-related molecules. The
  cytosolic and ER UPR also triggers transcriptional reprogramming for heat responses.
