caption: 'A chronologically aging culture of yeast cells progresses through at least
  seven consecutive “checkpoints”, each of which defines yeast longevity. Checkpoint
  1: The protein kinase Tor1 mitigates the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA-encoded
  enzymes of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system in mitochondria, thereby
  allowing to set up a certain rate of electron flow through the mitochondrial electron
  transport chain (ETC) and a certain value of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ).
  These two traits of mitochondrial functionality establish a magnitude of cell resistance
  to stresses and, thus, define the chronological lifespan of yeast. Caloric restriction
  extends yeast chronological lifespan by suppressing Tor1; Checkpoint 2: Mitochondria-generated
  NADPH is an electron donor for thioredoxin and glutathione reductase (TRR and GLR,
  respectively) systems outside of mitochondria. Both these systems delay yeast chronological
  aging by reducing the degree of oxidative damage to many proteins in various cellular
  locations; Checkpoint 3: The efficiency of coupled mitochondrial respiration defines
  the cellular concentration of trehalose, which in chronologically “young” yeast
  cells acts as a longevity-extending metabolite by enhancing cellular proteostasis;
  Checkpoint 4: If mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in chronologically
  “young” yeast cells are maintained at a “hormetic” level, ROS extend chronological
  lifespan by: (1) activating the transcription factors Gis1, Msn2 and Msn4, which
  promote expression of many longevity-extending nuclear genes; and (2) stimulating
  the longevity-extending Tel1-Rad53-Rph1 signaling pathway, which reduces the extent
  of damage to telomeric DNA in the nucleus; Checkpoint 5: Amino acids that are synthesized
  in and released from mitochondria activate the TOR signaling pathway; this pathway
  accelerates chronological aging by simulating protein synthesis in the cytosol,
  attenuating transcription of many stress-response genes in the nucleus, and suppressing
  autophagy of dysfunctional organelles and macromolecules; Checkpoint 6: A release
  of cytochrome c, Aif1 and Nuc1 from fragmented mitochondria in chronologically “old”
  yeast cells stimulates caspase-dependent and caspase-independent modes of apoptotic
  cell death, thus limiting yeast chronological lifespan; Checkpoint 7: Yeast chronological
  lifespan is shortened by “liponecrosis”, a mode of cell death that in chronologically
  “old” yeast cells is triggered due to (1) a reduced ability of mitochondria to generate
  ATP for the incorporation of non-esterified (“free”) fatty acids (FFA) into neutral
  lipids (NL); (2) a decline in the efficiency of an autophagic degradation of aged
  and dysfunctional mitochondria; and (3) a rise in the efficiencies with which mitochondria
  generate and release ROS. Activation arrows and inhibition bars denote pro-aging
  processes (displayed in blue color) or anti-aging processes (displayed in red color).
