caption: A long-term function of physiological stimulators such as aging followed
  by mitochondrial dysfunction might accumulate oxidative stress and metabolic stress,
  which both trigger the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling for highly activation
  of cell cycle re-entry in neuronal cells. In contrast with cancer, neuronal cell
  cycle is aborted and going to death instead of cell division. Moreover, a significant
  elevation of CDK2, CDK4, CDK5 and activation of caspases during cell cycle re-entry
  leading to APP phosphorylation, APP proteolysis, and production of Aβ. Furthermore,
  the activation of mTOR pathway results in the inactivation of autophagy, which is
  required for the clearance of Aβ in the neuronal cells. Upon cancer cell proliferation
  in the brain and hijacking energy from neurons, AMPK is stimulated upon this energy
  stress and positively activate FOXO3 to protect neuronal cells in the brain tumor
  microenvironment. FOXO increases the expression of antioxidant enzymes to diminish
  the damage of neuronal cell. Dashed arrow required additional investigation for
  that molecular network in the certain condition.
