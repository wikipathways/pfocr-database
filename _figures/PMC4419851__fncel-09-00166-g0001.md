caption: Modulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore structure. (A)
  The mPTP is mainly formed by the voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDAC, in orange),
  adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT, in purple) and cyclophilin D (CypD, in yellow).
  Under a physiological state, the mPTP presents a reversible conformation and CypD
  is not part of the protein complex and mainly resides into the mitochondrial matrix
  (MM). An interaction of the components, triggered by an apoptotic stimulus, induces
  the formation and opening of the mPTP, generating an irreversible response, that
  allows the entry of water and solutes into the MM. (B) In the context of AD, Aβ
  oligomers induce the translocation of CypD from the MM to the IMM to facilitate
  their interaction with ANT, and therefore the formation and opening of the mPTP.
  This final step induces uncontrolled release of calcium and mitochondrial swelling.
