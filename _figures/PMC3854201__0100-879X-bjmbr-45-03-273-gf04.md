caption: Biological interaction networking of PSME1 and RPS12 in chronic atrophic
  gastritis (CAG). PSME1 and RPS12 were imported into Pathway Studio (USA) and an
  interaction map was generated with information from the Ensembl database, the Pfam
  protein families database, Prosite database, GNF GeneAtlas database, and PDB database.
  Each node represents either a protein or a control mechanism of the interaction.
  The NF-κB and PBP-RAF/MAPK signaling pathways could be major molecular interaction
  pathways. The compendious molecular interaction pathway, which linked PSME1, RPS12
  and PBP, could impact on some cell functions such as cell proliferation and apoptosis,
  and the cell cycle could then promote the formation of CAG.
