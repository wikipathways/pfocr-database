caption: Signaling within the JAK-STAT pathway in bovine monocytes and M. avium subsp.
  paratuberculosis-infected bovine monocytes in response to IFN stimulation. Protein
  members of the JAK-STAT pathway are color coded with respect to fold change in differential
  phosphorylation. Red indicates increased phosphorylation, green indicates decreased
  phosphorylation, and white indicates no change. (A) Differential phosphorylation
  of JAK-STAT intermediates following IFN-γ in bovine monocytes. (B) Relative degrees
  of phosphorylation of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected versus uninfected
  bovine monocytes following IFN-γ stimulation. Diagrams were produced using the cytoscape
  visualization option of InnateDB.
