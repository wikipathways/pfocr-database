caption: (i) Under growth-suppressing conditions, LLPS of the transcriptional regulator
  TAZ is blocked by the upstream kinases Mst1/2 and LATS1/2, which induce TAZ phosphorylation
  and degradation in the cytosol. (ii) Under growth-stimulating conditions, however,
  Mst1/2 and LATS1/2 are inactive, allowing TAZ to enter the nucleus (iii) and undergo
  phase separation via multivalent self-association driven by its WW and coiled-coil
  (CC) domains, as well as intrinsic disorder within its TEAD-binding (TB) and transactivation
  (TA) domains (iv). TAZ condensates recruit TEAD proteins and numerous other transcription
  factors, efficiently inducing target gene transcription.
