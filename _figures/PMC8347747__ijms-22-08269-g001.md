caption: Overview of mitochondria tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and electron transport
  chain (ETC). Coupling of TCA with the ETC is named oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)
  and is the main metabolic source of intracellular energy in the form of ATP. During
  the ETC, pooling of electrons (e−) inside the ETC proteinic complexes, for instance
  due to imbalances between electron feeding and ETC capacity, leads to release of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). To protect the cell from the effects of this oxidative
  stress, mitochondrial existence is coupled with an intrinsic ability of the organelle
  to induce cellular death, when its function is compromised. Ca+2 and/or other stimuli
  activate this intrinsic apoptotic pathway, which leads to increased mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization. Release to the cytoplasm of the normal mitochondrial
  membrane-bound cytochrome c (Cyt c) activates a positive caspase regulatory cascade
  that leads to apoptosis. Pro-survival proteins belonging to the BCL-2 family (BCL-X,
  MCL-1, BCL-2) rescue cells from such events and are a major factor in both normal
  and malignant B cells’ physiology. Detailed analysis of the mechanisms of action
  of such antiapoptotic proteins is beyond the scope of this review and will therefore
  not be discussed further. Adapted from “Electron Transport Chain”, by BioRender.com
