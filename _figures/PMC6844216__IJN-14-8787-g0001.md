caption: Different death mechanisms of liver cells are involved in the pathogenesis
  of liver injury induced by MNPs. Liver damage caused by MNPs is associated with
  oxidative damage, inflammatory response, and liver fibrosis in the liver. Apoptosis,
  autophagy, pyroptosis, and necrosis are all pathways of hepatocyte death. ROS induced
  by MNPs is responsible for the lipid peroxidation injury of the hepatic subcellular
  organelles. Apoptosis is considered as type I programmed cell death and mainly mediated
  by endogenous mitochondrial pathway and exogenous death receptor pathway. Mitochondrial
  ROS inhibited Bcl-2, and Fas-related death domain proteins (FADD) were activated,
  all of which eventually activated caspase 3 or caspase 7. Autophagy cell death is
  a programmed cell death different from apoptosis with initiation, nucleation of
  autophagosomes, phagosome expansion and completion, and autolysosome docking. Mitochondria
  and endoplasmic reticulum oxidative stress cause changes in the upstream molecules
  of autophagy and regulate autophagy-related (Atg) molecules.  Pyroptosis is a form
  of inflammatory cell death that characterized by caspase-1-dependent formation of
  plasma membrane pores, and mainly manifested by lysosome rupture, ROS production
  and the activation of inflammation,  leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and cell lysis. Necrosis is due to the production of ROS or instability of lysosome,
  release of calpain, and decrease of ATP level. The characteristics of necrosis include
  plasma membrane rupture, mitochondrial swelling, lysosome rupture, and intracellular
  contents release. Cell necrosis leads to inflammation that is not related to caspase
  cascade.
