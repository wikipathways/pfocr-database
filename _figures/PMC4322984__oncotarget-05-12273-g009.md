caption: In the model, hypomethylation of Wnt5A probably leads to upregulated expression
  of Wnt5A in MCF7/ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Subsequently, Wnt5A activates PKA and
  PKA phosphorylates and inactivates GSK3β leading to activation of β-catenin and
  β-catenin-targeted genes including ABCB1, cyclin D1 and c-Myc. The upregulation
  of cyclin D1 and c-Myc led to increase cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis in
  MCF7/ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells under chemotherapy treatment. The proposed model,
  based on experimental evidences presented here, suggests that Wnt5A-mediated activation
  of downstream signal transducers is an important mechanism in the development of
  drug resistance in MCF7/ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells.
