caption: 'The activated BMK1 MAPK cascade promotes cell cycle progression of tumor
  cells induced by mitogens and/or oncogenic signals. The BMK1 pathway is activated
  by mitogens and oncogenic signals through a three-level kinase cascade (MEKK2 or
  MEKK3/MEK5/BMK1). Subsequently, activated BMK1 phosphorylates and suppresses the
  activity of its downstream effector PML thereby promoting the S phase entry of tumor
  cells. Some tumor cells upregulate BMK1 activity by overexpression of MEK5, which
  consequently augments their metastatic and chemo-resistant potentials. In mitotic
  tumor cells, it was reported that CDK is involved in phosphorylating and regulating
  BMK1 in a MEK5-independent manner. PML-NB: PML-Nuclear Body.'
