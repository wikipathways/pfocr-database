caption: Possible mechanisms of actions of Rg1 in ER positive cells. Rg1 (1) activates
  the recruitment of ERα to plasma membrane via the formation of signalsome containing
  caveolin, Shc, MNAR, IGFR, and c-Src and induces an increase in intracellular Ca
  mobilization; (2) activates GPER–EGFR cross talk and induces an increase in intracellular
  cAMP; and (3) leads to an increase in MEK1/2 phosphorylation and ERα phosphorylation
  at Ser118, followed by an induction of ERE-dependent transcription and finally the
  exertion of estrogenic effects.
