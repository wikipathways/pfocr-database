caption: 'In each Fig are shown from left to right: normoxic and hypoxic fetus; normoxic
  and hypoxic newborn (NB); and normoxic and hypoxic adult. The Fig also demonstrates
  an overview of mitochondrial metabolism pathway. Upward red arrow means significantly
  (P < 0.05) higher for the noted comparison. Downward green arrow means significantly
  (P < 0.05) lower for the noted comparison. Upward and downward arrows together means
  approach significance (0.05 < P < 0.1). N = 8 in each group.'
