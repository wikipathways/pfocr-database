caption: Protein-protein interaction (PPI), Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, and Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of EGRs. (A) The PPI networks
  of EGR family. Node, proteins; line, predicted interactions. (B) GO enrichment and
  KEGG pathway analyses of EGRs and their interacted protein via DAVID. GO enrichment
  included cellular component, biological process, and molecular function.
