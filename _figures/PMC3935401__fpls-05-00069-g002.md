caption: 'PR pathways in eukaryotes. Accumulation of unfolded proteins inside the
  ER lumen triggers to UPR that, during the first layer of response, leads the cell
  to adaptation. IRE1 is the only identified ER stress sensor in yeast and it is widely
  conserved in metazoan and plants. Moreover, additional ER stress sensors so far
  identified are bZIP28 and AGB1 in plants, and ATF6 and PERK1 in metazoan. Activation
  of PERK leads to phosphorylation of two proteins: Nrf2 that activates the transcription
  of genes involved in redox homeostasis; and eIF2α that decreases the overload of
  newly synthetized proteins into the ER and increases the specific translation of
  the transcription factor ATF4. Subsequently, ATF4 induces the expression of genes
  involved in amino acid metabolism, anti-oxidative stress response, folding, quality
  control and autophagy. The activation of IRE1 leads (1) to the selective degradation
  of mRNAs (RIDD) encoding ER-translocating proteins, decreasing the protein loading
  into the ER, and (2) to the translation of the bZIP transcription factors Xbp1/bZIP60/Hac1
  mRNA in metazoan, plants and yeast, respectively, that upregulate the UPR target
  genes mainly involved in folding, quality control and autophagy. ATF6 in metazoans
  and bZIP28 in Arabidopsis are translocated into the Golgi apparatus and cleaved
  by Site1 and Site2 proteases, releasing the ATF6/bZIP28 transcription factors domain,
  which then translocates to the nucleus where it increases the expression of genes
  involved in folding, quality control and autophagy. Upon excessive and prolonged
  ER stress, all the UPR pathways lead to cell death in yeast, metazoan, and plants.
  In plants, the cell death executioners are still largely unknown, while in metazoan
  they have been partially defined. In detail, IRE1 regulates the cell death through
  the mRNA decay of UPR target genes and of anti-apoptotic protein (anti-Casp2). In
  addition, IRE1 interacting with TRAF2 triggers the ASK1/JNK pathway promoting apoptosis.
  Moreover, PERK/eIF2α/ATF4, IRE1, and ATF6 induce the expression of the transcription
  factor CHOP, involved in the induction of apoptosis. Blue, eukaryotes; black, metazoan;
