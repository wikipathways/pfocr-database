caption: Model of the effect of the rns2-2 mutation on arabidopsis metabolism. Integration
  of transcriptome and metabolome data suggests that carbon flux is shuttled through
  the PPP. Since rns2-2 plants are deficient in rRNA turnover and nucleotide salvage,
  the increased carbon flux through the PPP pathway may be needed to generate ribose-5-phosphate
  for de novo synthesis of nucleotides to maintain cellular homeostasis. Changes in
  metabolism also result in increased NADPH levels. This increase causes accumulation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that in turn signal the activation of the autophagy
  machinery. Green boxes indicate enzymes encoded by a gene downregulated in rns2-2,
  and red boxes upregulated. Green and red arrows indicate metabolites with lower
  and higher levels in rns2-2, respectively. F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;

  description: Model of the effect of the rns2-2 mutation on arabidopsis metabolism.
    Integration of transcriptome and metabolome data suggests that carbon flux is
    shuttled through the PPP. Since rns2-2 plants are deficient in rRNA turnover and
    nucleotide salvage, the increased carbon flux through the PPP pathway may be needed
    to generate ribose-5-phosphate for de novo synthesis of nucleotides to maintain

    This increase causes accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that in turn
    signal the activation of the autophagy machinery. Green boxes indicate enzymes
    encoded by a gene downregulated in rns2-2, and red boxes upregulated. Green and
    red arrows indicate metabolites with lower and higher levels in rns2-2, respectively.
