caption: 'Overview of differential gene expression in M. acetivorans in response to
  methanol versus acetate utilization. A boxed number indicates the fold-increase
  in mRNA levels seen for the indicated gene(s) during acetate versus methanol growth
  conditions. A circled number indicates the fold-increase in mRNA levels during methanol
  versus acetate growth conditions. All data are from this study except for the mcr,
  mtr, mer, mtd, mch, and ftr gene ratio data derived from a prior microarray study
  []. The genes/enzymes are: ack, acetate kinase; pta, phosphotransacetylase; cdh,
  carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; MT1, mtaB2 methyl transferase 1; MT2, mtaA, methyltransferase
  2; mcr, methylcoenzyme M reductase; mtr, methyl -H4 MPT:HSCoM methyltransferase;
  mer, methylene -H4 MPT reductase; hmd, methylene -H4 MPT dehydrogenase; mch, methenyl
  -H4 MPT cyclohydrolyase; ftr, formyl MFR:H4MPT formyl transferase; fmd, formyl methanofuran
  dehydrogenase Mo-type; fwd, formyl methanofuran dehydrogenase W-type; fpo, F420
  H2 dehydrogenase; hdr, heterodisulfide reductase; rnf, Rnf-type complex; mrp, Mrp-type
  complex. The control gene was MA3998. Methanophenazine is represented by MPH. The
  proposed acetate transporter protein is indicated by AceP while the unknown transporter(s)
  for one carbon compounds is indicated by a question mark.'
