caption: Network of differentially expressed genes in HMGA1 transgenics at 2 months
  (parametric approach). Using 36 differentially expressed genes as the focus gene
  set identified by a parametric approach and IPA, the highest-scoring network was
  Immunological Disease, Cell-Mediated Immune Response, and Cellular Development (score
  = 23). Colors, arrows, lines and abbreviations are described under Figure 1.
