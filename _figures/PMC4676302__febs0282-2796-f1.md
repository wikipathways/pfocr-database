caption: 'Methyl and acetyl transfer pathways. The blue pathway depicts one‐carbon
  metabolism and its generation of SAM, which provides a methyl group for histone
  and DNA methylation. Imported folate is reduced to tetrahydrofolate (THF) and subsequently
  methylated to mTHF by the conversion of serine to glycine and the glycine cleavage
  system. The folate cycle is coupled to the methionine cycle by mTHF, donating a
  carbon to homocysteine, converting it to methionine. Adenylation of methionine produces
  SAM, which acts as a cosubstrate for DNMT and HMT, allowing transfer of its methyl
  group to DNA and histone tails respectively. The red pathway depicts acetyl transfer
  from acetyl‐coenzyme A. Acetyl‐coenzyme A, which is derived from pyruvate, links
  glycolysis to the TCA cycle, but is confined to the mitochondria. In the cytoplasm
  and nucleus, acetyl‐coenzyme A has to be derived by two alternative methods: first
  by ACLY, which utilizes citrate from the mitochondrial TCA cycle, and second by
  ACSS2, which ligates acetate to CoA. Acetyl‐coenzyme A can then be utilized as a cosubstrate
  by HAT, allowing transfer of the acetyl group to lysines on histone tails. 3‐PG,
  3‐phosphoglyceric acid; SAH, S‐adenosylhomocysteine.'
