caption: E3 ubiquitin ligases promote asthma pathology. Autocrine motor factor receptor
  (AMFR) can promote Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production
  by targeting Cytokine Inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS) and facilitating its
  ubiquitination degradation. E3 enzyme Midline 1 (MID1) can mediate the ubiquitinating
  degradation of Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to inhibit the secretion of inflammatory
  Cytokines Interleukin-25 (IL-25) and Interleukin-13 (IL-13). E3 enzyme Parkin has
  exerted its function in two pathways. One is mediating the ubiquitinating degradation
  of P53, the other is increasing the production of inflammatory substrate Nuclear
  Factor Kappa-light-chain-enhancer (NF-κB). CBX4 functions as an E3 enzyme but it
  increases the secretion of Interleukin-9 (IL-9) through the SUMOysation of Hypoxia-inducible
  factor alpha (HIF-α). All these reactions promote inflammation, which ultimately
  leads to an increase in the course and progression of asthma
