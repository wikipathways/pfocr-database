caption: Comparison of the metabolic pathway of AA and 2-AG. AA and 2-AG can be metabolized
  by COX-2 to form PGH2 and PGH2-G, respectively. Depending on the downstream enzymes,
  AA and 2-AG can be further metabolized to form various prostaglandins and their
  glycerol esters, respectively. 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14 PGJ2 is a known endogenous agonist
  for PPARγ and it is hypothesized that 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2-G (the glycerol ester
  of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2) may act as an agonist for PPARγ. TX, thromboxane.
