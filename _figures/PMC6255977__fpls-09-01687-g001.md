caption: 'Transcriptome response of Salvia miltiorrhiza to overexpression of AtPAP1.
  (A) Comparison of gene expression between two libraries, with each normalized to
  one million tags. Red dots represent transcripts more prevalent in AtPAP1-14 library;
  green dots, those present at lower frequency in transgenic plants; and blue dots,
  transcript levels with no significant change. Parameters “FDR < 0.001” and “log2Ratio
  ≥ 1” were used as threshold to judge significance of differences in expression.
  (B) Proposed biosynthetic pathway for phenolics, beginning with core phenylpropanoid
  and tyrosine pathways, and leading to three major branch pathways: phenolic acid,
  flavonoid, and lignin (red, upregulated genes; green, downregulated). TAT, tyrosine
  aminotransferase; HPPR, hydroxyl phenylpyruvate reductase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia
  lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, hydroxycinnamate-CoA ligase; RAS, rosmarinic
  acid synthase; CYP, cytochrome P450 enzymes; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone
  isomerase; FLS, flavonol synthase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3’H, flavonoid
  3’-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase;
  ANS, anthocyanin synthase; HCT, hydroxyl cinnamoyl transferase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA
  reductase; C3’ H, coumarate 3’-hydroxylase; COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase;
  CCoAMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase; F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase; GT, glycosyltransferase;
  CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase.'
