caption: Differentially methylated promoter regions of genes in PI3K-Akt and NF-κB
  signaling pathways during acute malaria. Negatively selected monocytes were obtained
  from Kenyan children at presentation with acute uncomplicated malaria and 6 weeks
  following treatment (n = 8). Monocyte genomic DNA was isolated for DNA methylation
  analysis using the MethylationEPIC array, which measures methylation at over 850,000
  sites across the genome (Illumina). Differential methylation between acute malaria
  and recovery samples was analyzed for single nucleotide positions, gene and promoter
  regions, and pathway enrichment using R/Bioconductor and the ChAMP package. UM =
  uncomplicated malaria.
