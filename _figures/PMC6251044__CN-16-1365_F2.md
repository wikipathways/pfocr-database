caption: The inflammatory response and cell death after stroke. DAMPs (damage associated
  molecular pattern) are released from injured/necrotic cells in response to tissue
  damage. Inflammation is triggered in response to DAMPs through PRRs (pattern recognition
  receptors). Pro-inflammatory cytokines act through death receptors (Fas, TNF, TRAIL)
  triggering either caspase-8 apoptotic pathway (extrinsic), or RIP1-RIP3 (receptor-interacting
  protein kinases)-MLKL (mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein) pathway resulting
  in necroptosis. The RIP1-RIP3 pathway may induce apoptosis when MLKL is not present.
  PRRs also contribute to inflammation by induction of inflamasome formation and caspase-1
  activation, resulting in maturation and releasing of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  from the pyroptotic cells.
