caption: Schematic diagram of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism
  pathways in response to salt stress. The heatmap shows the analysis of differences
  in metabolite concentrations. In the heatmap, red indicates up-regulated metabolites,
  blue indicates down-regulated metabolites, and white indicates metabolites with
  no significant differences. (A) The fatty acid metabolism pathway begins with phosphatidylcholine,
  which is converted into Linolenic acid through the action of PL2G/SPLA2 enzymes.
  Linolenic acid is then further processed via LOX2S and 13 (S)-HpOTrE to produce
  12-Oxo-dodecenoic acid. This compound is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis
  of various secondary metabolites. (B) Phenylpropanoids are synthesized from phenylpropanoid
  biosynthesis through the action of COMT/HCT/CCOAmT enzymes, leading to the formation
  of monolignols. These monolignols are then converted into coumarins via CCR/CAD/4CL
  enzymes, which are essential for the production of esculin, a significant secondary
  metabolite in this pathway. The first column of the matrix represents the differences
  in metabolite concentrations between control and 12 h. The second column of the
  matrix represents the differences in metabolite concentrations between control and
  24 h. The third column of the matrix represents the differences in metabolite concentrations
  between control and 48 h
