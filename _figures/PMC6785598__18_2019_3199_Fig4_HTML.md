caption: Epigenetic regulation of stem cells. a Active regulatory elements are typically
  enriched for 5hmC, H3K27ac, H3K4me, and bound Mediator complex. During gene repression,
  the activating histone modifications are eliminated, and repressive marks, such
  as H3K27me3 and nucleosomal compaction, are established. In pluripotent stem cells,
  multiple enhancers combined with master pluripotency transcription factors, such
  as OCT4, SOX2 and KLF4, establish a super-enhancer, which supports the activation
  of pluripotency genes. The absence of master pluripotency factors could induce the
  disassembly of the enhancer–promoter complex in the assembly of repressive inputs.
  The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex induces nucleosome formation
  at the binding region of pluripotency factors and alters the histone modifications
  that correspond to transcriptional activity. Similar disassembly of activating modifications
  occurs in the promoter by PRC2-associated histone demethylases KDM2B and KDM5A.
  Furthermore, H3K9me2 or H3K9me3 is deposited in the enhancer by G9A in complex with
  GLP and SETDB1, and DNA methylation by DNMT3A. Equally, PRC2 deposits H3K27me3 in
  promoters, which initiate chromatin compaction by recruiting the canonical PRC1
  complex and monoubiquitylate H2AK119 (H2AK119ub). K27ac, Lys27 acetylation; Pol
  II, RNA polymerase II. PRC2, Polycomb repressive complex 2. GLP, G9A-like protein.
  DNMT3A, DNA methyltransferase 3A. CCTC-binding factor (CTCF). DNMT, DNA methyltransferase;
  HDAC, histone deacetylase; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; MED, mediator complex;
  MBD, methyl-DNA-binding domain protein; POL II, RNA polymerase II; TET, ten eleven
  translocation dioxygenase; TrxG, trithorax group complex. TF, transcription factor.
  b In differentiated cells, H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub are enriched in CpG island-containing
  promoters of some pluripotency genes. At the initiation of reprogramming, OCT4,
  SOX2 and KLF4 (known as OSK) bind to partial motif sequences of some select enhancers
  to engage pioneer factor-like activity. These OSK binding sites are modified with
  H3K4me1 and H3K4me2. OSK binding also promotes H3K4 methylation at the promoter
  via the MLL component WDR5 and is associated with local erasure of H3K27me3 by the
  histone demethylase UTX. Subsequently, OSK cooperates with unknown factors to establish
  a canonical enhancer architecture, including H3K4me2 and H3K27ac, and stable topological
  cognation to the promoter via the cohesin and Mediator complexes. Embryonic stem
  cell-specific BAF (esBAF) further stabilizes the enhancer-promoter complex, and
  the activating inputs predominate at this stage and direct the expression of the
  target genes. LSD1, Lys-specific demethylase 1; MBD3, methyl CpG-binding domain
  protein 3; MLL, mixed lineage leukemia. Pol II, RNA polymerase II, WDR5, WD repeat-containing
  protein 5. c The mechanisms of DNA methylation and demethylation. Cytosine is converted
  to 5mC by DNMTs. TET1 is responsible for the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC. Three TET
  family proteins could subsequently oxidize 5hmC to 5fC (5-formylcytosine) and then
  to 5caC (5-carboxylcytosine). Moreover, 5hmC can be converted to 5hmU (5-hydroxymethyluracil)
  by deaminase activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing
  enzyme catalytic polypeptides (APOBECs). 5fC, 5caC and 5hmU can be excised by thymine
  DNA glycosylase and replaced by an unmodified cytosine via the base-excision repair
  (BER) pathway. d Key epigenetic regulators that are involved in HSC self-renewal
  and lineage commitment during differentiation, and DNA methylation levels changes
  during hematopoietic lineage commitment. CLP, common lymphoid progenitor; CMP, common
  myeloid progenitor; DNMT, DNA methyltransferase; DNA me, DNA methylation; GLP, G9A-like
  protein. GMP, granulocyte–monocyte progenitor; MPP, multipotent progenitor; PRC,
  polycomb repressive complex; TET, Ten-eleven translocation; TrxG, Trithorax group.
  e In the embryonic neurogenesis of mice, neuroepithelial cells develop into radial
  glial cells (RGCs) around embryonic day 14. RGCs can either produce neurons directly
  or give rise to intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs), which in turn generate neurons.
  During later embryonic development, RGCs also give rise to oligodendrocytes (OligoD)
  and astrocytes
