caption: '[LM18]A cerebral capillary enclosed in astrocyte end-feet. Characteristics
  of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are indicated: (a) tight junctions (TJs) that seal
  the pathway between the capillary (endothelial) cells; (b) the lipid nature of the
  cell membranes of the capillary wall makes it a barrier to water-soluble molecules;
  (c–e) represent some of the carriers and ion channels in the BBB; (f) the ‘enzymatic
  barrier’ that removes molecules from the blood; (g) the efflux pumps that extrude
  fat-soluble molecules that have crossed into the cells.'
