caption: Dry-cured beef metabolic pathway analysis based on the significantly differentially
  expressed metabolites in water-soluble compounds in CG—control group versus FG—fermented
  group (A) and CG versus RG—ripened group (B). Degree of enrichment was analyzed
  using a rich factor, p-value, and the number of dry-cured beef metabolites were
  enriched in each pathway. The size of the bubble indicates the amount of significantly
  differential metabolites in water-soluble compounds which were enriched in this
  pathway, and the point with different gradation of color represents the scope of
  the p-value. The higher value of the rich factor represents the higher degree of
  enrichment, while the lower p-value represents the more significant degree of enrichment.
  The umami taste of dry-cured beef was produced during processing (C). The violin
  plot illustrates the metabolites found in the dry-cured beef meat. Metabolites in
  black font were not detected.
