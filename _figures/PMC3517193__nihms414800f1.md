caption: Graphic illustration of the perturbation of the insulin signal transduction
  pathways by cellular stressors. The binding of insulin to its receptor triggers
  the activation of downstream signaling cascades important for the metabolic and
  mitogenic actions of insulin. The phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates
  on select tyrosine residues leads to the activation of PI-3 kinase with subsequent
  increase in the activity of serine/threonine kinase Akt. Insulin also activates
  the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway and gene transcription. Under stressful conditions,
  the inflammatory pathways are activated, leading to the phosphorylation of IRS-1
  at serine 307 by the kinases IKKβ and JNK1 and subsequent attenuation in insulin
  signal transduction. Activation of the lipid phosphatase PTEN decreases PI-3 kinase
  activity and, therefore, reduces Akt signaling and activation of downstream target
  proteins involved in multiple aspects of cell physiology.
