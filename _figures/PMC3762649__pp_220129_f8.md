caption: Proposed models for the regulation of -responsive pathways by JAMs and MYC2.
  A, After wounding, synthesized  activates jasmonate signaling. JAMs and MYC2 antagonistically
  regulated the jasmonate metabolic pathway in wounded leaves. It should be noted
  that effects on the expression of jasmonate biosynthetic and catabolic genes are
  shown, but those do not correlate with oxylipin levels. B, model of JAM-regulated
  transcription factors and metabolic enzymes during  responses. After the recognition
  of  by the COI1-JAZ complex, MYC2 is activated and regulates other transcription
  factors. JAMs also are targets of MYC2 and function in jasmonate signaling. JAMs
  negatively regulate the targets of MYC2. Note that the arrows show transcriptional
  regulation except for the arrows pointing to “root growth inhibition.” Pink arrows
  and squares represent positive effects shown experimentally in this paper. Pale
  blue arrows and squares represent negative effects shown experimentally in this
  paper. Black thin arrows represent metabolic reactions. Dark gray arrows are drawn
  based on previous reports. White arrows represent the feedback regulation by transcription
  factors. Note that the negative effect of JAMs on ORA59 expression was observed
  in the myc2 background. For abbreviations, see .
