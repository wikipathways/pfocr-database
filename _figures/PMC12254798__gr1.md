caption: The obese adipose tissue (AT) microenvironment interacts with tumor cells
  during cancer progression. During obesity, immune cells including M1 macrophages,
  neutrophils, dendritic cells, and T cells infiltrate the obese AT, leading to chronic
  low-grade inflammation. Obese AT and cancer cells communicate via the cytokine-chemokine
  network, angiogenic factors, and adipokines to create a pro-inflammatory, tumor-promoting
  microenvironment to support cancer growth. The key adipokine leptin activates the
  STAT3 signaling pathway. Obese AT triggers inflammatory signaling pathways such
  as NF-κB, leading to increased production of IL-6, and further activation of STAT3
  signaling. STAT3 also triggers the Pim signaling pathways that promote cancer cell
  survival and proliferation. IL-6/STAT3 signaling also promotes angiogenesis by inducing
  expression of VEGF, which drives cellular proliferation and migration to support
  tumor growth and metastasis. TNF-α produced by M1 macrophages induces production
  of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which further associate with cancer cell metastasis.
  NF-κB activation in the cancer cells also lead to the metastatic cascade. Tumor-associated
  macrophages also produce cytokines that promote angiogenesis and obese adipocytes,
  and cancer cells express FABP4 at their interfaces that support metastasis by promoting
  immune invasion
