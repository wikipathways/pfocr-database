caption: The canonical Wnt signaling pathway. (a) In the absence of Wnt ligand, a
  cytosolic protein complex composed of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), axis inhibition
  (Axin), casein kinase 1 α (CK1α), glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β), and β-transducin
  repeat-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (βTrCP) mediates phosphorylation and
  ubiquitination of β-catenin (β-cat). Phosphorylated β-catenin is subsequently degraded
  by the proteasome. In such a situation, transcription factors from the T-cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) family are held in an inactive state by interaction
  with transcription repressor Groucho that blocks transcription of Wnt signaling
  target genes. (b) Binding of the Wnt ligand to receptor Frizzled and co-receptor
  low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) leads to LRP phosphorylation
  that induces Axin recruitment to the cell membrane. As a result, the destruction
  complex is disassembled and β-catenin translocates to the cell nucleus to activate,
  in cooperation with TCF/LEF factors, transcription of Wnt target genes. R-spondin
  (RSPO) ligand binds the leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor
  (Lgr) 4/5, which results in internalization and subsequent proteasomal degradation
  of transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases zinc and ring finger 3 (ZNRF3) and ring finger
  43 (RNF43). The ligases mediate turnover of the Wnt receptor Frizzled and their
  inhibition enhances Wnt signaling. (c) Truncated APC protein does not retain the
  ability to scaffold the destruction complex, resulting in β-catenin stabilization
  and aberrant expression of Wnt target genes, i.e., even without the presence of
  the Wnt ligand.
