caption: RANKL binds to its receptor RANK, which results in the recruitment of TRAF6
  and activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways. NF-κB pathway induces c-Fos expression
  via IKKs. MAPK pathway results in the activation of the Jun proteins. Together,
  the c-Fos and Jun proteins associate to form the AP-1 complex. AP-1 along with NF-κB,
  NFATc2, and NFATc1 itself drives the expression of NFATc1, the master regulator
  of osteoclastogenesis. Activated NFATc1 binds to NFAT-binding sites on its own promoter,
  stimulating its own expression and leading to autoamplification loop. NFATc1 cooperates
  with other transcription factors, such as AP-1, PU.1, CREB, and MITF to promote
  the expression of various osteoclastogenic genes. On the other hand, NFATc1 expression
  is negatively regulated by transcription factors, such as IRF8, MafB, Bcl6, and
  LRF, some of which are inhibited by Dnmt3a, RBP-J, and Blimp1. IRF8 in turn may
  control these inhibitors.
