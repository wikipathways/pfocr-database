caption: Schematic diagram of RasC-mediated signaling pathways that control chemotaxis.
  The chemoattractant cAMP signals through the G protein–coupled receptor cAR1 to
  RasC, leading to TORC2-mediated activation of PKBR1 and PKBA. The activation of
  PKBA also depends on recruitment to PIP3. Together, the two PKBs phosphorylate a
  series of substrates and play a critical role in ACA activation, actin polymerization,
  and chemotaxis. The graphs to the left schematically illustrate the kinetics of
  G protein α and βγ subunits dissociation, RasC activation, PKB phosphorylation,
  PKB substrate phosphorylation, and chemotactic responses. The red line shows the
  typical wild-type responses that are rapidly shut off during persistent stimulation.
  The green line shows the responses in cells in which the inhibitory signal indicated
  by (⊥) is bypassed by RasCQ62L.
