caption: Regulation of autophagy by ARV. The autophagy process contains several distinct
  steps, including membrane isolation, nucleation, vesicle formation, fusion of autophagosome
  with lysosome, and degradation of the cargo followed by release of the degradation
  products back into the cytosol. The activity of autophagy is regulated by several
  cellular signaling pathways; mTOR-dependent pathway (via mTORC1), and mTOR-independent
  pathways (such as TFEB-mediated pathway and cyclical Ca2+-calpain-Gαs and cAMP-Epac-PLC-ε-IP3
  pathways). Starvation inhibits mTORC1, a downregulator of autophagy, and also induces
  dephosphorylation of TFEB resulting in the activation of autophagy []. Infection
  of ARV promotes autophagy via the action of p17 protein at the various steps of
  PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway and also on activation of PKR/eIF2α signaling []. In the
  case of Beclin-1 regulation, Wirawan et al. demonstrated that caspase activation
  in cells undergoing autophagy has been demonstrated to cleave Beclin-1, thereby
  inducing apoptosis []. The antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2, interacts with Beclin-1
  and inhibits Beclin 1-dependent autophagy []. Autophagy and apoptosis are basic
  cellular pathways that are regulated by JNK-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation []. JNK1-mediated
  Bcl-2 phosphorylation interferes with its binding to Beclin-1, thereby promoting
  autophagy induction []. More recently, a report by Wang et al. demonstrated that
  Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Beclin-1 increased its interactions with 14-3-3
  and vimentin, leading to autophagy inhibition [].
