caption: In AOH eyes, downregulated miR-93 releases the repression of downstream target
  genes of STAT3. Retinal microglial cells markedly activate and overproduce inflammatory
  cytokines, ultimately leading to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death. Supplementation
  with miR-93 can represses STAT3 by binding to the 3′UTR of STAT3, regulating microglia-mediated
  neuro-inflammation and protecting RGCs against AOH. Thus, miR-93 may serve as a
  novel target for neuroprotective therapy in glaucoma.
