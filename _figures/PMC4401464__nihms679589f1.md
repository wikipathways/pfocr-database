caption: This figure presents one mechanism of how v-FLIP assists v-cyclin to bypass
  the cellular senescence response, allowing v-cyclin-mediated cell hyperproliferation
  during latent infection of KSHV. v-cyclin, a latent gene product of KSHV and a homolog
  of cellular D-type cyclin, drives aberrant cell-cycle progression in partnership
  with the cellular cyclin-dependent kinase CDK6, leading to the activation of DNA
  damage response (DDR) and p53 checkpoint control. As a result, autophagy is upregulated
  through p53-dependent negative regulation of the mTOR signaling axis. Activated
  autophagy then enables cellular senescence through currently unknown mechanisms
  (indicated by a question mark), preventing aberrant cellular proliferation. To circumvent
  this antiproliferative barrier, the virus expresses v-FLIP as a “second hit” to
  attenuate autophagy-associated cellular senescence, acting directly on the autophagy
  machinery by inhibiting Atg3. v-FLIP can also activate the NF-κB pathway, extending
  the life span of infected cells. As a result, virally infected cells continue to
  grow and divide in an unregulated manner as genetic errors accumulate, establishing
  favorable conditions for neoplastic transformation.
