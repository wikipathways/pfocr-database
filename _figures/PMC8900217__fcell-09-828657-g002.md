caption: Remodeling of TME induced by DNA damage. DNA damage of tumor cells leads
  to dsDNA, thus activating the cGAS/STING signaling pathway and promotes IFN generation
  in several kinds of cells. The APC activation can be induced through endocytosis
  of tumor-derived dsDNA, cGAMP, or extracellular vesicle. Then, APCs initiate CD8+
  T cells, NK cells, and macrophages to enhance the immune response in TME. The Treg
  cell activation induced by tumor cells performs immune suppression to T-cell proliferation
  and functions through anti-inflammatory factors. The tumor cells also induce IDO1
  expression to enhance amino acid metabolism, thus suppressing T-cell function. STING
  activation promotes normalization of tumor vasculature and increases migration of
  T cells across endothelial barrier and enhances antitumor immunity. In addition,
  cGAS/STING pathway activation in fibroblasts affects the differentiation of fibroblasts
  to CAFs.
