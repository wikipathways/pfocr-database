caption: a | Treg-specific miRNA expression is required to restrain effector T cell
  responses. In the absence of miRNA expression in TReg cells, for example due to
  deletion of essential components of the miRNA biogenesis pathway, such as DICER
  or DROSHA, TReg cells fail to maintain tolerance, which might result in autoimmunity.
  b | Examples of miRNA pathways that contribute to the regulation of TReg cell function
  and plasticity. TEFF, effector T cell; TReg, regulatory T cell.
