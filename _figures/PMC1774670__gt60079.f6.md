caption: The p53 pathway. The p53 tumour suppressor protein plays a central role in
  the cellular response to a range of environmental and intracellular stresses, including
  agents which cause DNA strand breaks, ultraviolet radiation, and oxidative stress.
  These signals are transduced because p53 is a transcription factor that binds to
  the promoters of genes involved in the DNA damage response programme. The biological
  outcomes of p53 induction include growth arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Among
  p53 responsive genes are those involved in growth arrest such as the CDK inhibitor
  protein p21WAF1, which mediates G1/S arrest by blocking cyclin E-Cdk2 mediated phosphorylation
  of pRb. Many proapoptotic genes are also stimulated by p53, particularly those involved
  in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis such as BAX, and APAF1. Under normal circumstances,
  p53 is tightly regulated through its interaction with MDM2, a negative regulatory
  partner. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which mediates both ubiquitination and
  proteasome dependent degradation of p53. Finally, p53 regulates GADD45a, which is
  involved in DNA repair. The GADD45a protein interacts with Cdc2 protein kinase,
  proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and p21WAF1 protein, indicating that
  GADD45a may play a role in cell cycle checkpoint control, DNA repair, and signal
  transduction. GADD45a appears to be an important component in the cellular defence
  network required for maintenance of genomic stability.
