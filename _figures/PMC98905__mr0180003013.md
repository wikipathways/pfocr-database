caption: Model describing fluffy gene interactions in controlling initiation of development.
  As described in the text, we have proposed that the activities of two antagonistic
  signaling pathways determine whether development and secondary metabolism occur
  (, , ). One pathway requires the product of FluG activity, which is proposed to
  work as an extracellular signal to activate a sporulation-specific pathway that
  requires flbB, flbC, flbD, and flbE. When the FadA Gα protein is GTP bound, it regulates
  downstream effectors to enhance proliferation and repress both sporulation and ST
  production. The FluG signal causes inactivation of FadA by activating FlbA, which
  functions as a GTPase-activating protein to turn off the FadA-dependent signaling
  pathway. This inactivation of FadA then allows both sporulation and ST biosynthesis
  to occur.
