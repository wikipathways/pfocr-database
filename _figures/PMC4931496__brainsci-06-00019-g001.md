caption: Diagrams showing signal transduction pathways used by chemokines and the
  proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. A plus sign within a circle indicates activation
  of the target molecule and a minus sign within a circle indicates inhibition of
  the target molecule. (A) Agonist binding to the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR)
  initiates dissociation of the G-protein heterotrimer coupled to the receptor into
  Gα and Gβγ subunits. The Gα and Gβγ subunits then activate or inhibit downstream
  effectors. These effectors include ion channels, such as voltage-gated calcium channels
  (VGCC), and signal transduction molecules including phospholipase C (PLC) and adenylate
  cyclase (Acyc). Activation of PLC leads to the production of other signaling molecules
  including diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3), and downstream
  activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R),
  which regulate the release of calcium from intracellular stores; (B) IL-6 can signal
  through either a membrane bound (classic signaling) or a soluble (trans-signaling)
  IL-6R. The IL-6/IL-6R complex interacts with gp130 to activate the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway. In addition, the IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 complex can activate RAS/mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (p44/42 MAPK, also called ERK1/2; MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3
  kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways. All three signaling pathways activate additional
  downstream signaling molecules and effectors.
