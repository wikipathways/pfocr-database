caption: O-GlcNAcylation and oncogenic transcription factors. Several transcription
  factors have been described to be O-GlcNAcylated by the O-GlcNAc-transferase (OGT)
  among which some that are involved in tumorigenesis. The proto-oncogene MYC has
  been shown to be O-GlcNAcylated on Thr58. This site is normally phosphorylated by
  GSK3β in response to MYC phosphorylation on Ser62 resulting in MYC degradation.
  Proper experimental evidences demonstrating that O-GlcNAcylation promotes MYC stability
  and pro-oncogenic activities remain to be described. NF-κB signaling is known to
  be promoted by O-GlcNAcylation. First, the IKKβ kinase responsible for NF-κB activation
  has been shown to be to O-GlcNAcylated on Ser733. In a p53-null context, it was
  associated with pro-oncogenic activity in a model of colitis-associated cancer.
  Second, NF-κB itself is also O-GlcNAcylated at Thr322 and Thr352 in presence of
  high glucose concentration. In pancreatic cancer cells, Thr322 and Thr352 O-GlcNAcylation
  were shown to be involved in cell anchorage in vitro. In breast and prostatic cancer
  cells, OGT controls the expression of FOXM1, a pro-oncogenic transcriptional factor.
  However, FOXM1, itself, is not O-GlcNAcylated. Through an unknown substrate and
  mechanism, OGT prevents FOXM1 degradation and thus promotes tumor development in
  breast cancer and metastasis in prostate cancer. β-Catenin, involved in cell adherent
  junctions, is also central to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a transcription factor
  in complex notably with LEF/TCF co-factors. Once activated, β-catenin promotes tumorigenesis,
  especially colorectal and liver cancers. Increased O-GlcNAcylation levels of β-catenin
  have been observed in colon carcinoma cells. Furthermore, interaction of OGT with
  β-catenin is stimulated during serum-induced proliferation in HeLa cells. These
  observations support a positive role of O-GlcNAc-modified β-catenin in cell proliferation.
  The well known tumor suppressor p53 is O-GlcNAcylated at Ser149 which prevents the
  phosphorylation at Thr155 by the COP9 signalosome. This results in an inhibition
  of p53 degradation. O-GlcNAcylation of p53 promotes p53 stability and thus its tumor
  suppressor activity in physiological context. In case of pro-oncogenic p53 mutants,
  O-GlcNAc-mediated stability of p53 may favor pro-oncogenic processes. This hypothesis
  has not been addressed experimentally yet.
