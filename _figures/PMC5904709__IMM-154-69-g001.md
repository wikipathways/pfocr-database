caption: Simplified sketch showing the mode of action of statins as immunosuppressive
  strategy. Statins inhibit the rate‐limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway leading
  to reduced levels of its downstream products. The pyrophosphate downstream products
  are critical for geranylgeranylation or farnesylation of GTPases that mediate multiple
  steps in the immune response such as cell migration, activation, signalling and
  cytokine production.
