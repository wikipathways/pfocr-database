caption: Synthesis, metabolism and anticancer mechanism of vitamin D. Sunlight, specifically
  ultraviolet-B radiation, converts 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) into vitamin D3 in
  the skin. Vitamin D3 then enters the blood stream as complexes with vitamin D binding
  protein (DBP) and albumin. Liver mitochondrial and microsomal 25-hydroxylases (25-OHases),
  encoded by the gene CYP27A1, carry out the first hydroxylation of vitamin D to form
  25(OH)D3. 25(OH)D3 is then 1a-hydroxylated by mitochondrial 1a-hydroxylase (1a-OHase)
  encoded by the CYP27B1 gene to form 1a,25(OH)2D3 in the kidneys and other tissues.
  The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the nuclear receptor family that regulates
  gene transcription by forming a hetero-dimer with RXR, which binds to vitamin D-response
  elements (VDRE) in the promoter regions of target genes. Several 1,25(OH)2D3 target
  genes have been reported multiple molecular pathways of anti-tumor actions of 1,25(OH)2D3
  in ovarian cancer. These include (1) the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase(CDK)
  inhibitors P21 and P27 and the subsequent inhibition of G1/S checkpoint; (2) G2/M
  arrest by 1,25(OH)2D3 through the induction of GADD45; (3) the inhibition of tumor
  angiogenesis due to suppressive effects on the expression of HIF-1/VEGFR pathway;
  (4) the suppression of invasion and metastasis via the up-regulation of E-cadherin
  and the down-regulation of β-catenin; (5) the induction of cell apoptosis by the
  suppression of hTERT mRNA transcription which miR-498 was a primary target gene
  of 1,25(OH)2D3; (6) the down-regulation of the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 to
  inhibit the inflammatory process; (7) 1,25(OH)2D3 can induce a slow increase of
  Ca2+ that activates CaMKK-β, a Ca2+-activated kinase that was identified as a direct
  activator of AMPK. DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) played a critical role
  in the cellular response to cell metabolism by the mTOR pathway
