caption: The sketch illustrates the response of Camellia sinensis L. to Tambocerus
  elongatus infestation through secondary metabolism and defense hormone pathways.
  When infested by Tambocerus elongatus, tea plants activate jasmonic acid, a hormone
  significantly associated with pest resistance. This activation triggers the induction
  of flavonoids and lignans, particularly lignin, in the secondary metabolic pathway,
  thereby enhancing the plant’s resilience against the pest. In this model, solid
  lines denote pathways that play a pivotal role, and arrows indicate up-regulation
