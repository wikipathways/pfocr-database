caption: Schematic of the WNT10b and galanin-mediated signaling pathways linked to
  adipogenesis. In HFD model, increased SFRP5 and DKK2 inhibit WNT10b to combine with
  LRP and frizzed receptor. Decreased WNT10b signal transduction increases the phosphorylation
  of β-catenin thus reducing the amount of β-catenin transported to nucleus. In HFD
  model, decreased amount of β-catenin in nucleus cannot inhibit the activity of PPARγ
  resulting in the stimulation of adipogenesis. The HFD also increases gene expression
  in the galanin-mediated signaling pathway. More galanin binds to its receptors,
  resulting in increased phosphorylation of ERK, which further induces Cyc-D. Increased
  Cyc-D promotes more E2F1 to bind to DP that stimulates the expression of PPARγ2,
  C/EBPα, and its target genes.
