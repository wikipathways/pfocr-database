caption: Schematic representation of the potential consequences of either pan-ERBB
  TKIs (such as afatinib, left) or an anti-ERBB3 antibody (such as GSK2849330, right)
  on ERBB2-ERBB3 heterodimerization. In this model, the CD74-NRG1 fusion protein binds
  ERBB3 inducing heterodimerization with ERBB2 and stimulating cell survival and proliferation.
  A pan-ERBB TKI may partially inhibit ERBB2 kinase activity and modestly suppress
  signaling which, in some cases, may elicit anti-tumor effects in patients (, ).
  An anti-ERBB3 antibody may lead to more potent inhibition of ERBB2-ERBB3 signaling
  leading to tumor regression ().
