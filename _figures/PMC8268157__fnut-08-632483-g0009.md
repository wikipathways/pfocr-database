caption: Significantly different metabolites in metabolic pathways in different combinations.
  (A) The major metabolic pathways of significantly different metabolites. (B) Tetrahydrofurandiols
  pathway. (C) Lysine-related pathway. a, b, c, and d represent PBA0 vs. control,
  PBA.1 vs. control, PBA1 vs. control, and PBA5 vs. control, respectively. Solid and
  dashed lines represent direct and indirect procedure, respectively. Red and blue
  colors represent upregulation and downregulation, respectively, and gray color represents
  no significant change. Filled circles with black color represent metabolites in
  the pathway but undetected in the study.
