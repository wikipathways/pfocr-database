caption: A schematic diagram for the role of Glrx1 in regulation of IKKα and IKKβ
  in response to CS. Targeted disruption of Glrx1 leads to increased lung proinflammatory
  response, which is associated with NF-κB activation through the differential regulation
  of IKKs, including glutathionylation and phosphorylation in response to CS exposure.
  Glrx1 deficiency leads to increased IKKα and IKKβ activation in response to CS associated
  with S-glutathionylation. IKKβ-S-glutathionylation leads to its inactivation and
  hence inhibition of NF-κB (dotted lines), whereas posttranslational modifications
  (S-glutathionylation and phosphorylation) on IKKα cause NF-κB activation and chromatin
  modifications (histone acetylation) on proinflammatory genes. IKKα and IKKβ modifications
  are reversible, and the inflammatory pathway is predominantly mediated by IKKβ.
