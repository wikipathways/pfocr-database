caption: 'Reawakening of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) program in prostate
  cancer epithelial cells engages signaling interactions among different growth factor
  pathways and the AR signaling axis. Individual components associated with each signaling
  cascade are color-coordinated. Major signaling pathways are shown, including the
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway (yellow), genomic and nongenomic androgen/AR signaling pathway
  (blue), cytokines grouped for simplicity (pink), and the TGF-β pathway (green).
  EMT-associated transcription factors relevant to prostate tumorigenesis via EMT
  regulation are shown in red. The signaling cascades converge on the EMT-associated
  transcription factors to control their activities. Activation of Twist, Snail and/or
  the ZEB factors leads to the initiation of EMT-associated gene transcription, which
  allows for mesenchymal gene expression. E-cadherin is silenced by the EMT-associated
  transcription factors. The loss of E-cadherin from the cell membrane is a hallmark
  of EMT-induction, which allows β-catenin to relocalize to the cytosol where it interacts
  with AR and key EMT transcription factors. TGF-β signaling produces Smad-mediated
  responses, as well as Smad-independent phosphorylation of Par6. In response to TGF-β
  and/or androgens, Smads can interact with the AR, Snail, ZEB factors and Twist towards
  EMT activation. Other growth factor pathways can crosstalk with the AR and EMT transcription
  factors to trigger a mesenchymal gene-expression pattern.AR: Androgen receptor;
  LEF1: Lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1; P: Phosphorylation; RhoA: Ras homolog
