caption: Mechanoreception associated with Cx43-HCs in osteocytes. FFS is transmitted
  through the ECM and glycocalyx at synapses, acts on integrin αVβ3 located in dendrites,
  and activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through adherent FAK. Activated AKT
  directly phosphorylates Cx43 and the cytoplasmic domain of integrin α5 at the cell
  body membrane, causing integrin α5β1 to change conformation, ultimately leading
  to the opening of HC channels and allowing small bone anabolic factors such as pge2
  and passage of ATP.
