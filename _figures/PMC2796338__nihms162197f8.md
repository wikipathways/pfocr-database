caption: Caspase-6 activation by a cellular stress triggered by staurosporine or the
  natural dopaminergic toxin 6OHDA increases caspase-6-mediated cleavage of wild-type
  DJ-1, thereby generating a C-terminal DJ-1 fragment that activates Akt, reduces
  p53 activity and therefore acts as a protective cellular signal (blue pathway).
  Mutation of DJ-1 at amino-acid 149 prevents its cleavage by caspase-6. A DJ-1 mutation
  at position 166 destabilizes DJ-1 and renders the protein prone to rapid degradation.
  Both mutations trigger a loss of function of DJ-1 and abolish DJ-1 mediated control
  of p53 (red pathway). Therefore, various mutations of DJ-1 can be likely responsible
  for Parkinson’s disease pathology via distinct molecular dysfunctions.
