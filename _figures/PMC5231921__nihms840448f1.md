caption: 'A generalized mechanism for the interactions between immunity and reproduction.
  Reproductive pathways are red, metabolic signaling pathways are blue, and immunity
  pathways are green. A female insect host responds to a pathogen via IMD and Toll
  pathways and cellular immune activation. Activation of the IMD pathway activates
  JNK signaling, which inhibits IIS signaling. The end result is the production of
  AMPs. The receipt of SP during mating alters the typical response to a pathogen.
  SP stimulates JH synthesis, which negatively regulates the cellular immune response
  and the production of AMPs. Abbreviations: 20E, 20-hydroxyecdysone; AMPs, antimicrobial
  peptides; FOXO, forkhead box, subgroup O; IIS, insulin/insulin-like growth factor-like
  signaling; IMD, immune deficiency; JH, juvenile hormone; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase;
  SP, Sex Peptide; YP, yolk protein.'
