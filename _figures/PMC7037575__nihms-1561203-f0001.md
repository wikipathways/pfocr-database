caption: 'Pathophysiology of acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Impaired mitochondrial
  β-oxidation of fatty acids caused by enzyme deficiencies has been implicated in
  the pathogenesis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Homozygous fetal enzymatic deficiencies
  result in increased levels of free fatty acid metabolites that cross into the maternal
  circulation. Pregnant women who are heterozygous for fatty acid oxidation enzyme
  defects may be more susceptible to the increased metabolic demands of pregnancy
  and more susceptible to liver injury from lipotoxic metabolites, inflammatory pathway
  activation, reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis. The fetal fatty acid oxidation
  defects that have been associated with acute fatty liver of pregnancy are deficiencies
  in long-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenases (LCHAD) and mitochondrial trifunctional
  protein (most common), as well as deficiencies in short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenases
  (SCAD) and medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenases (MCAD)., CPT, carnitine palmitoyltransferase;
