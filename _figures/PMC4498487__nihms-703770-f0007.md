caption: Inflammatory blood cells, such as leukocytes and platelets, which are originally
  from hematopoietic cells in bone marrow, can secrete the hematopoietic lineage,
  cell-specific micro-ribonucleic acid (miR)-223 into circulating serum. This miR-223
  can then enter vascular cells (e.g., vascular smooth muscle cells [VSMCs] and vascular
  walls) and work as a novel endocrine genetic signal (like a hormone) in VSMCs to
  regulate their biological functions, such as proliferation, migration, and apoptosis
  via target genes such as insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and the
  P13K-Akt pathway. Under pathological conditions, such as atherosclerosis and vascular
  injury, blood cells release more miR-223, which results in increased levels of miR-223
  in VSMCs and vascular walls. The increased miR-223 helps protect against atherosclerotic
  vascular disease (vascular neointimal formation and atherosclerosis). P = phosphate.
