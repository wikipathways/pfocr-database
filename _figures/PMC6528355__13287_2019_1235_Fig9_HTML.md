caption: Potential mechanism of lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 involved in the biological activity
  of NSCLC CSCs via regulation of TGFBR2. In NSCLC CSCs, lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 sponged
  to miR-301b-3p that negatively regulated TGFBR2, and downregulation of lncRNA MBNL1-AS1
  weakened the adsorption capacity, increased miR-301b-3p expression, and reduced
  TGFBR2 level, thus promoting the proliferation, migration, invasion, drug resistance,
  and sphere formation yet suppressing the activation of TGF-β pathway. By contrast,
  lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 overexpression strengthened the adsorption capacity of miR-301b-3p,
  accompanied by elevated TGFBR2 expression, hence resulting in a decline of the proliferation,
  migration, invasion, drug resistance, and sphere formation yet an increase in activation
  of TGF-β pathway

  non-coding RNA MBNL1-AS1 in non-small cell lung cancer.
