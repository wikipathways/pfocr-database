caption: σE stress response pathway. σE is encoded by the rpoE gene, which is transcribed
  with rseABC from a σ70 promoter. RseA is an IM protein, which binds and inhibits
  σE. When the OMP assembly pathway is compromised, OMPs misfold in the periplasm
  and a YXF motif activates the DegS protease. DegS initiates the proteolytic pathway,
  and RseA is further degraded by the RseP and Clp proteases. σE is released and activates
  expression from σE-dependent promoters, e.g., those of the micA gene and the rpoE-rse
  and rseABC operons.
