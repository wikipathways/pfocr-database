caption: New targets in cancer cell metabolism are shown. The glycolytic enzymes pyruvate
  kinase M2 (PKM2) and phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) as well as the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1/2 have been recently identified
  as new and promising targets for cancer therapy. PKM2 catalyzes the conversion of
  phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate while concurrently producing adenosine triphosphate,
  and has been shown to play a key role in promoting the Warburg effect in tumor cells.
  PGAM1 catalyzes the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) to 2-phosphoglycerate
  (2PG), and is uniquely positioned at the branching point between glycolysis and
  anabolic biosynthesis, making it an attractive anticancer target. PGAM1 activity
  is increased in many cancers, and its gene expression is believed to be upregulated
  due to loss of TP53 in cancer cells, because TP53 negatively regulates the PGAM1
  level. IDH catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, producing α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG) in the citric acid cycle. Both IDH1 and IDH2 produce nicotinamide adenine
  di-nucleotide phosphate (NADPH), and both have been identified as being mutated
  in human cancers, namely glioma and acute myeloid leukemia. G6-P indicates glucose
  6-phosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; F6-P, fructose 6-phosphate; F1,6-BP,
  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; Ac-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A.
