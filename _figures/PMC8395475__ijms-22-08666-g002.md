caption: Potential regulatory mechanisms by adipose tissue dendritic cells (ATDCs)
  in the adipose tissue (AT) environment by interaction with T cells (1), AT macrophages
  (ATMs) (2), and non-immune cells (3). In obese AT, uptake of antigens or lipids
  such as free fatty acids and/or cholesterol by ATDCs induces activation of the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, leading to increased MHC-II expression and induced
  maturation. 1. Obese ATDCs lead the Th1 and Th17 subset proliferation that creates
  the pro-inflammatory environment. Released IFNγ is capable of inducing MHC-II expression
  in antigen-presenting cells, creating a loop to amplify Th1 and exacerbate AT inflammation.
  In obesity, ATDCs have a lower capability to induce Tregs proliferation, while interaction
  with the Th2 subset is unknown. Separately, ATMs can uptake antigens inside the
  AT and induce proliferation of local effector CD4+ T cells into Th1 and/or Th17
  subsets. 2. ATDCs partly regulate monocyte-derived ATM recruitment into AT, yet
  their interaction remains elusive. 3. Obese ATDCs fail to preserve their tolerogenic
  function in steady state to prevent preadipocyte differentiation and hyperplasia.
  Excess nutrition induces adipocyte hyperplasia, which decreases Wnt ligand and healthy
  dietary lipid secretion and leads to decreased Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cDC1s
  and inactive PPARγ in cDC2s, triggering an inflammatory state.
