caption: Quercetin attenuates podocyte apoptosis of diabetic nephropathy through targeting
  EGFR signaling. EGFR was screened from quercetin targets and diabetic nephropathy
  targets by network pharmacology analysis. In diabetic nephropathy, the phosphorylation
  rate of EGFR and ERK were raised, leading to increased podocyte apoptosis, finally
  resulting in podocyte injury and proteinuria formation. By restraining the activation
  of EGFR signaling pathway, quercetin can relieve podocyte apoptosis and ameliorate
  podocyte injury, thus delaying the formation of proteinuria and the progression
  of diabetic nephropathy.
