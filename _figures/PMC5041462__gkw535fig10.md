caption: Overview repair model of MMS-induced DNA damage in budding yeast by BER,
  translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and HR (Adapted from ()). MMS damage leads to base
  lesions excised by the DNA glycosylase Mag1 to create an AP site. Both the MMS-induced
  base lesions and AP sites can lead to a replication fork block, which can either
  be bypassed by the TLS pathway (requiring Rev3) resulting in increased mutation
  frequency and therefore, error-prone repair (). During BER, Apn1/Apn2 further processes
  the AP site leading to 5′-dRPs, which are filled in by DNA polymerase ϵ and the
  5′-dRP flap is cleaved by Rad27. Lig1 ligates the resulting nick. The 5′-dRP and
  flap as well as the nicked DNA can lead to replication fork collapse and DSB formation.
  The resulting DSB can be repaired by the high-fidelity HR pathway via the Shu complex,
  which is important for the critical Rad51 filament formation step of HR.
papertitle: The Shu complex promotes error-free tolerance of alkylation-induced base
  excision repair products.
