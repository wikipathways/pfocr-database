caption: p53 induces several negative regulators of the cell intrinsic Insulin-like
  growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor signaling pathway as well as systemically acting
  IGF-BP3, the major antagonistic IGF-1 carrier in the circulation. IGF-1 signaling
  induces cell proliferation, while reduced IGF-1 signaling is associated with extended
  lifespan in species ranging from nematode worms to mammals. p53-mediated cellular
  senescence, in contrast, promotes cellular aging, while senescent cells modify their
  tissue environment through the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
  resulting in cytokine secretion that activates the innate immune system. The innate
  immune system in turn can act tumor suppressive (blue) by clearing cells that have
  become senescent as result of oncogene activation or chronic DNA damage. However,
  SASP might also have tumor promoting consequences on surrounding cells as cytokine
  signaling and chronic inflammation can promote proliferation of tumor cells. In
  addition, chronic inflammation is also associated with tissue aging.
