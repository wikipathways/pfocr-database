caption: The ULK1 complex integrates upstream mTORC1 and AMPK signaling pathways and
  ultimately activates the PIK3C3 complex to initiate phagophore formation (see text
  for details). (A) ROS reportedly activate and suppress PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling
  through multiple poorly defined mechanisms. (B) ROS activate ATM, which activates
  an LKB1-AMPK pathway that inhibits the mTORC1 complex and induces autophagy. ROS
  may also directly oxidize and activate AMPK. (C) Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members
  suppress autophagy by binding Beclin 1 and inhibiting PIK3C3 complex activity. Oxidation
  of HMGB1 and ASK1 results in disruption of the Bcl-2-Beclin 1 interaction through
  direct displacement or phosphorylation of key residues within the Bcl-2. (D) ROS
  activate Ca2+ channels, triggering Ca2+ influx that leads to translocation of TFEB
  and the expression of ATG and lysosomal genes. Ca2+ may also activate CAMKK2 and
  CAMK2, and in turn, positively or negatively regulate PIK3C3 complex activity. (E)
  Following the activation of the ULK1 and PIK3C3 complexes, LC3/GABARAP proteins
  are cleaved by ATG4 and conjugated to PE on the phagophore, resulting in its elongation
  and closure to form a mature autophagosome. ATG4 then deconjugates LC3/GABARAP proteins
  from the outer autophagosomal membrane for recycling (see text for details). Stress
  reportedly triggers formation of a TXNIP-REDD1 complex, which induces ROS that oxidize
  and inhibit ATG4 activity, thereby activating autophagy presumably by suppressing
  the deconjugation of LC3/GABARAP proteins during phagophore elongation and autophagosome
  maturation.
