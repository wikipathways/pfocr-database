caption: '(A) Enrichment analysis showing that the protein processing in the endoplasmic
  reticulum pathway is greatly deregulated in transfected cells. The KEGG pathway
  depicts the molecules that take part in the protein processing in the ER. The highlighted
  molecules were significantly deregulated in the cells transfected with the mutant
  COL4A3-G1334E or the COL4A3-WT chain versus those transfected with an empty vector.
  Significantly upregulated genes in the pathway are shown in red, whereas significantly
  downregulated genes are green (see also Supplemental Table 3). (B) Unsupervised
  hierarchical cluster based on 118 genes involved directly in the protein processing
  in the endoplasmic reticulum recognizes two main gene clusters. Color saturation
  is directly proportional to the measured expression ratio magnitude. Euclidian distance
  was used as the metric. Rows represent individual probe sets. Columns represent
  the three experimental conditions: empty vector (V), WT, or G1334E. Red bars indicate
  high expression, and green bars indicate low expression.'
