caption: BCAA/BCKA catabolic pathway resulting in TCA cycle intermediates. Complete
  oxidation of all three BCKAs in isolated mitochondria requires a carboxylase reaction.
  This reaction is either carried out by methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (KIC; reaction
  indicated by ‘1’ in the figure) or propionyl-CoA carboxylase (KMV and KIV; reaction
  indicated by ‘2’ in the figure). Both enzymes are biotin-dependent enzymes that
  use bicarbonate to catalyze carboxylation in an ATP-dependent reaction. Unlike biotin,
  which is bound to the matrix enzymes, both ATP and bicarbonate are depleted from
  the mitochondrial matrix during the isolation procedure.
