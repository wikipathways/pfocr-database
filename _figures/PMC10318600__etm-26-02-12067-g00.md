caption: Signaling pathway of ferroptosis. Ferric iron is transferred into cells by
  TfR1, then converted to ferrous iron and released to the cytoplasm by STEAP3 and
  DMT1. Elevated labile iron pool catalyzes formation of phospholipid hydroperoxides
  via Fenton reaction. Free cytosolic PUFAs are converted to PUFA-PLs with catalyzation
  by ACSL4 and LPCAT3, then PUFA-PLs are oxidized by lipoxygenase 12/15, contributing
  to the accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxides. Mitochondrial dysfunction results
  in increased ROS production, which may also contribute to lipid peroxidation. Cystine
  uptake through system xc- is used for synthesis of GSH. Moreover, FSP1/CoQ10 and
  GCH1/BH4/BH2 are two parallel GPX4-independent pathways in suppression of ferroptosis.
