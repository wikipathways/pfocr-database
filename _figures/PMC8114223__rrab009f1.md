caption: Schematic representation showing the involvement of products of cancer susceptibility
  genes in DNA damage response and repair. The products of major high-penetrance cancer
  susceptibility genes are colored in pink and those of other moderate-penetrance
  cancer susceptibility genes are colored in blue. The proteins colored in gray are
  not currently established as products of cancer susceptibility genes, but include
  the products of the genes in which rare hereditary mutations in cancer are reported.
  In response to double-strand breaks (DSBs), the MRN complex initially recognizes
  and binds the DSB sites, and recruits and activates the ATM kinase, which transmits
  the DNA damage signals by phosphorylating a large number of downstream proteins,
  leading to DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. Homologous recombination
  (HR) is the most accurate DNA repair pathway for DSBs, and the Fancony anemia (FA)
  pathway, which plays a key role in the repair of interstrand cross-links (ICLs),
  also contributes to the activation of HR.
