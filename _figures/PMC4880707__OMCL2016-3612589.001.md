caption: Suggested positive feedback loop in SOD3 signal transduction. Phosphorylation
  of RTKs activates the cell membrane associated SRC proto-oncogene family members
  that contribute to RAS GTP loading and stimulation of mitogenic signal transduction
  to BRAF, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 kinases. In vitro transient transfection of RAS, BRAF,
  MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 increases both SOD3 mRNA and protein expression hence suggesting
  mitogen pathway induced SOD3 synthesis. SOD3 production results in increased synthesis
  of growth promoters, such as VEGF and cyclin D1, and increased activation of activator
  protein 1 (AP1) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Importantly, SOD3
  activates cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), increases phosphorylation
  of SRC family members, and regulates the GTP loading to small GTPases, such as RAS.
