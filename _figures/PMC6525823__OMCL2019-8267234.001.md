caption: Oxidative stress and vascular implications in metabolic syndrome. Metabolic
  syndrome (MS) is characterized by risk factors having tissue oxidative stress (OS)
  as hallmark. Indeed, they are characterized by increased release and accumulation
  of proinflammatory mediators, such as free fatty acids (FFAs), high glucose levels,
  advanced glycation end-products (AGE), cytokines, and angiotensin II, as well as
  to the activation proinflammatory signals linked to the stimulation of protein kinase
  C (PKC) and polyol pathways. These conditions boost the increase in reactive oxygen
  (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) formation in tissues and in the vasculature through
  the activation of the related producing enzymes in the cytosol as well as in the
  mitochondria. The cytosolic enzymes include the different isoforms of NADPH oxidase
  (NOXs), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), cyclooxygenase (COX), xanthine oxidase, protein
  kinase C (PKC), uncoupled endothelial NOS (eNOS), and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Other
  potential sources of ROS and RNS are the oxidized RBCs (oxRBCs) and the increased
  NADH amounts. The former, forming in the vasculature under significant OS conditions,
  behave as prooxidant cells able also to release oxidant species. The latter, increased
  at expenses of NADPH under hyperglycemic conditions, can induce mitochondrial deregulation
  and ROS formation. Noteworthy for the MS-associated cardiovascular complications
  is the reduction in •NO bioavailability in the vasculature, notwithstanding the
  NOS upregulation. Indeed, the simultaneous increase in the concentration of •NO
  and O2• allows these radicals to react fast generating the strong oxidant peroxynitrite
  (ONOO−), which deeply affects intracellular redox chemistry. The MS-associated diseases
  are also characterized by the downregulation of the antioxidant systems, including
  the depletion of GSH concentration and the decrease of the activity of the detoxifying
  enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (Cat), glutathione peroxidase
  (Gpx), glutathione reductase (GR), and the couple constituted by thioredoxin (Trx)
  and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). In addition, as in a vicious cycle, the increased
  ROS and RNS formation can further worse MS-related diseases by affecting in turn
  the intracellular pathway generating the proinflammatory mediators, as well as decrease
  the activity of the antioxidant systems. All these conditions result in the irreversible
  accumulation of oxidation products in proteins, lipids, and sugars, which allow
  the impairment of intracellular redox signaling and detrimentally affect vascular
  biology by promoting vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular
  remodeling. These alterations underlie the typical MS-associated cardiovascular
  complications, such as coronary atherosclerotic disease, arterial hypertension,
  left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, coronary microvascular disease,
  and autonomic dysfunction.
