caption: Targeting mitochondria using endogenous cardioprotective strategies. Scheme
  showing the recruitment of signalling pathways by ischaemic conditioning that converge
  on mitochondria to confer cardioprotection. Many of these signaling pathways reduce
  myocardial infarct size by inhibiting MPTP opening at the onset of reperfusion through
  the opening of mitochondrial channels (such as mitoK and Cx43), the activation of
  cytoprotective kinase cascades (MEK1/2-Erk1/2 and PI3K-Akt of the RISK pathway,
  and JAK-STAT3 of the SAFE pathway), or the release of nitric oxide and activation
  of cGMP. In addition, the PINK1-Parkin-Mfn2 mitophagy pathway is also activated
  by these endogenous cardioprotective strategies. Ischaemic preconditioning, IPC;

  description: Targeting mitochondria using endogenous cardioprotective strategies.
    Scheme showing the recruitment of signalling pathways by ischaemic conditioning
    that converge on mitochondria to confer cardioprotection. Many of these signaling
    pathways reduce myocardial infarct size by inhibiting MPTP opening at the onset
    of reperfusion through the opening of mitochondrial channels (such as mitoK and
    Cx43), the activation of cytoprotective kinase cascades (MEK1/2-Erk1/2 and PI3K-Akt
    of the RISK pathway, and JAK-STAT3 of the SAFE pathway), or the release of nitric
    oxide and activation of cGMP. In addition, the PINK1-Parkin-Mfn2 mitophagy pathway
    is also activated by these endogenous cardioprotective strategies. Ischaemic preconditioning,
