caption: Major non-canonical mechanisms derived from CALRMut. CALRMut (depicted in
  red) shows different binding affinities for proteins implicated in the unfolding
  protein response (UPR) (HSPA5, HSPA9, and HSPA8), proteins of the cytoskeleton (MYL9
  and APRC4), and ribosomal proteins (RP17, RSP23, and RPL11), as well as reduced
  binding to MSI2, a transcriptional regulator that target genes mainly involved in
  cell cycle regulation. Additionally, CALRMut seems to reduce the activation of the
  pro-apoptotic pathway of the UPR and increases oxidative stress and DNA damage through
  the downmodulation of oxidation resistance 1 (OXR1). CALRMut also shows decreased
  binding affinities for PDIA3 and has a loss-of-function effect on the peptide loading
  complex (PLC), which mediates the loading of cellular antigens onto major histocompatibility
  complex class I (MHC-I) molecules, favoring immunoevasion. Mutations in CALR increase
  the secretion of the protein and bind to CALR receptors in antigen presenting cells
  (APCs), limiting their ability to phagocytize wild-type CALR-exposing cancer cells.
  The main differences between the phenotypes observed in patients with type 1 (del52)
  and type 2 (ins5) mutations have been attributed to thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR)-independent
  cytosolic calcium fluxes and the binding affinity for the transcription factor FLI1.
