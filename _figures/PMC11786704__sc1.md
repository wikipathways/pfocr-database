caption: 'Preparation and application of PC capsules for promoting wound healing in
  diabetic mice. (A) Schematic representation of the synthesis of PC capsules. (B)
  Application on diabetic mice: PC capsules are applied to the wound to enhance healing.
  (C) Mechanism of action: PC capsules reduce ROS, inhibit inflammation via the p38
  MAPK pathway, prevent apoptosis, and then promote tissue repair'
