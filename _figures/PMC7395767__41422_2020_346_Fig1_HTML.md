caption: Abnormal localization of DNA in the cytosol elicits an immune response through
  the cGAS-STING pathway. Cytosolic DNA derives from exogenous (pathogens and dead
  cells) and endogenous (genome instability or mitochondrial damage) sources. cGAS
  binds to DNA in the cytosol and converts ATP and GTP into 2′3′-cGAMP. cGAMP then
  binds to STING on the ER to trigger STING trafficking to vesicles. cGAMP-bound STING
  activates the downstream kinases TBK1 and IKK to activate the transcription factors
  IRF3 and NF-κB, respectively. These transcription factors induce expression of type
  I IFNs and cytokines, which propagate the immune response in an autocrine and paracrine
  manner.

    cGAS binds to DNA in the cytosol and converts ATP and GTP into 2′3′-cGAMP. cGAMP
    then binds to STING on the ER to trigger STING trafficking to vesicles. cGAMP-bound
    STING activates the downstream kinases TBK1 and IKK to activate the transcription

    of type I IFNs and cytokines, which propagate the immune response in an autocrine
    and paracrine manner.
