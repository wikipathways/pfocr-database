caption: Schematic depicting the migration signaling pathway induced by PM2.5 in HBSMCs.
  Here, we showed that PM2.5 regulated HBSMC migration by activating the Shh signaling
  pathway. PM2.5 increases the expression of Shh. Shh binds to Ptch and inhibits the
  repression of SMO, thereby activating Gli1. Gli1 translocates to the nucleus and
  activates Snail transcription, triggering HBSMC migration to the epithelium

  hedgehog signaling pathway.
