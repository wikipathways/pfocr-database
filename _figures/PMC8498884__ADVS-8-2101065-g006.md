caption: Schematic illustration on the synthetic procedures of such a photocleaved
  O2‐released nanoplatform (i.e., Ce6/PDE5‐i@FHMON‐O2) and the switching from ROS
  to RNS. a) Detailed synthesis process of Ce6/PDE5‐i@FHMON‐O2 and its intermediate
  products such as FHMON, Ce6@FHMON, and Ce6/PDE5‐i@FHMON. b) The schematics for illustrating
  the underlying principle of RNS production arising from ROS fusion with NO and elucidating
  the activated ROS/RNS pathway against tumors.
