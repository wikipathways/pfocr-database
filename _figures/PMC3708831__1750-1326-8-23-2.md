caption: Ca2+ Signaling and synaptic maintenance. A. Synaptic maintenance requires
  continuous trans-synaptic signaling at excitatory synapse. Spontaneous release of
  glutamate triggers activation of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) and Ca2+ elevation in the
  postsynaptic terminal. Low levels of Ca2+ in postsynaptic ER causes Ca2+ influx
  via the nSOC pathway. These Ca2+ signals continuously stimulate activity of CaMKII,
  which is necessary for maintenance of synaptic spine structure. B. Similar Ca2+signaling
  defects are observed at the presynaptic terminal and postsynaptic spines in synapses
  that old, exhibit premature loss of maintenance machinery or in Alzheimer’s Disease
  (AD). The frequency of spontaneous glutamate release is diminished in both aging
  and AD neurons. Ca2+ influx via NMDARs is reduced. Mitochondria are depolarized
  and less effective in Ca2+ uptake. The levels of cytosolic CaBPs are reduced. The
  ER Ca2+ levels are increased and synaptic nSOC is diminished. As a result of these
  changes the activity of CaMKII at the synapse is reduced and activity of CaN is
  elevated, leading to weakening and destabilization of the synapses in aging and
  AD neurons by promoting “LTD-like” signaling pathways. Similar, but more severe,
  processes are observed in PS-FAD neurons. Red arrows indicate increased or decreased
  activity. ER - endoplasmic reticulum; AV - autophagic vacuole; Mito - Mitochondrium;
  EE - early endosome; EV - endocytic vesicle; SV - synaptic vesicle; nSOC - neuronal
  store-operated Ca2+ entry; NMDAR - NMDA receptor; CamK2 - Ca/CaM Kinase 2; CaN -
  Calcineurin; CaBP - Calcium binding protein; PSEN - Presenilin.
