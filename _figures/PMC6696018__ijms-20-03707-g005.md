caption: The significantly expressed common genes assigned into the MAPK signaling
  pathway during the early phases of AR formation in mulberry stem hardwood cuttings.
  The enriched common genes are in red, and the changes of transcriptional expression
  levels in the three comparison groups are illustrated with colored boxes. The boxes
  from the left to right indicate −6 hAP vs. 0 hAP, 0 hAP vs. 54 hAP, and −6 hAP vs.
  54 hAP, respectively. Each row of boxes represents a mulberry homolog gene. The
  color code from blue to red represents the changes of transcriptional expression
  level between –5 and 5. The solid or dashed arrows indicate direct or indirect positive
  effects, and the T type lines indicate inhibitory effects. This figure is redrawn
  based on the KEGG pathways.
