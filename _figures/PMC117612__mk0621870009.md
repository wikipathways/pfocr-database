caption: Schematic diagram of the effects of TSP2 and growth factors on cell cycle
  progression and apoptosis in microvascular ECs. Fibroblast-derived TSP2 binds to
  one or more cellular receptors on microvascular ECs and activates three separate
  pathways. The first results in inhibition of cell cycle progression mediated by
  VEGF-A and FGF2. The second pathway, likely similar to that described for TSP1 (),
  results in activation of caspases. TSP2-mediated activation of caspases is inhibited
  by the cytoprotective functions of VEGF-A and FGF2. However, this pathway is not
  activated by TSP2 to the extent that it causes apoptotic cell death. A third pathway
  results in TSP2-induced, caspase-independent cell death that is inhibited by VEGF-A,
  but not by a combination of bFGF, IGF-1, and EGF.
