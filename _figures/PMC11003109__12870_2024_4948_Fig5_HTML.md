caption: Pathway analysis of DEGs under S-deficiency, in O. sativa and S. viridis.
  A S-methylmethionine cycle and Met degradation II were the most significantly altered
  pathways in the up-regulated DEGs in both species (complete list in Supplemental
  Table 4). Up-regulated genes are shown in magenta. B Regulation by S-deficiency
  of HMT-1 and HMT-2 genes from the S-methylmethionine cycle pathway and MGL from
  Met degradation II in O. sativa and S. viridis, (log2 fold change) separately in
  shoots (S), and roots (R). C The pathway oxygenic photosynthesis was significantly
  down-regulated specifically in S. viridis, where 8 genes were down-regulated (in
  blue). D The pathway glycolysis II was significantly altered only in S. viridis,
  where 5 genes were down-regulated (in blue). Pathways were downloaded from https://plantcyc.org
