caption: Possible evolutionary pathway of the p53 protein as a germline surveillance
  factor and its isoforms. p63/p73 genes evolved first in the early multicellular
  organisms from p53, similar to how the ∆40p53 isoform evolved in primitive vertebrates.
  From this, FLp53 evolved in higher organisms. From FLp53, various mutant p53 isoforms
  as well as the N-terminal truncated isoforms ∆133p53 and ∆160p53 developed.
