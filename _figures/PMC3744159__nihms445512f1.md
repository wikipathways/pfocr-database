caption: Model of Nervous Wreck function. Nwk binds Dap160, dynamin and Thickveins
  to negatively regulate the BMP signaling pathway. Because Nwk specifically localizes
  to Rab11-positive endocytic compartments, we hypothesize that Nwk regulates receptor
  recycling through an RE-dependent pathway. Shunting Thickveins away from the more
  rapid RE-independent recycling route would have the effect of reducing plasma membrane
  receptor concentrations and, thus, neuronal responsiveness to the retrograde BMP
  signal. Early endosome (EE); Recycling endosome (RE); Wishful Thinking Type II BMP
  receptor (Wit).
