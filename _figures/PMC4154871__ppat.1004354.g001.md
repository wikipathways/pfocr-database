caption: 'Following Berg and colleagues, , we considered four scenarios for the fate
  of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) during infection-related processes. Mode 1: More ATP
  than NADPH is required. G6P enters glycolysis through its conversion to fructose
  6-phosphate by phosphoglucose isomerase 1 (Pgi1). Mode 2: M. oryzae cells require
  more ribose 5-phosphate for biosynthetic purposes than NADPH. Fructose 6-phosphate
  and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the glycolytic pathway are converted to ribose
  5-phosphate in the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by the action of
  transaldolase and transketolase (Tkl1). Mode 3: more NADPH than ribose 5-phosphate
  is required. G6P fuels NADPH production by G6P dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in the oxidative
  PPP and is resynthesized in the gluconeogenic pathway by fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase
  (Fbp1) and Pgi1. G6P is completely oxidized to CO2. Mode 4: NADPH and ATP are required.
  G6P fluxes through the PPP and into glycolysis via Tkl1 resulting in the production
  of NADPH and ATP. G6P is converted into pyruvate. Dashed lines indicate steps that
  have been omitted for clarity. Products of genes functionally characterized in the
  text are indicated by black spheres.'
