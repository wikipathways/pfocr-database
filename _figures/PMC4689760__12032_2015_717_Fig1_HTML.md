caption: Cholesterol biosynthesis pathway is altered in CEM/R2 cells. a Outlined cholesterol
  synthesis pathway in which all genes with increased mRNA expression are highlighted
  in green and HMGCR as its mRNA expression level is lower in CEM/R2 cells is highlighted
  in red. Major points of inhibition by cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors are highlighted
  in red. b mRNA expression levels of all genes involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic
  pathway is shown as log2 fold over relative mRNA expression for each gene in CEM
  cells. Significance was assessed using a two-tailed unpaired t test. Data are shown
  as mean ± SEM of six independent experiments. *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01; ***P ≤ 0.001
