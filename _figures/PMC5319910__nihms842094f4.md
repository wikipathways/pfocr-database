caption: After synthesis, histones H3–H4 and H2A–H2B engage with multiple different
  chaperones and enzymes on their way to chromatin. ASF1 is a central chaperone in
  the delivery of newly synthesized H3.1–, H3.2– or H3.3–H4 dimers. Histone-free ASF1
  is phosphorylated by tousled-like kinases (TLKs), promoting histone binding. Histones
  bound by ASF1 are engaged in multiple different co-chaperone complexes, which further
  shields their functional interfaces and facilitates their acetylation, nuclear import
  and storage. Co-chaperoning may be a general paradigm, supporting branching of the
  pathway and the modification of histones ‘on the go’. ASF1 shuttles H3.1/H3.2–H4
  and H3.3–H4 dimers to the CAF1 and HIRA complexes for replication-coupled and replication-independent
  deposition, respectively. H3.3–H4 dimers are also deposited by DAXX–ATRX, whereas
  the H2A–H2B supply is handled by NAP1 and FACT. Histone chaperones also have an
  important role in the feedback regulation of histone supply. Although several histone
  chaperones are implicated in H3–H4 delivery with ASF1, it is still unclear whether
  other chaperones collaborate with DAXX and NAP1 in the delivery of H3.3–H4 and H2A–H2B
  dimers, respectively. See  for definitions of histone chaperone abbreviations.

  description: After synthesis, histones H3–H4 and H2A–H2B engage with multiple different
    chaperones and enzymes on their way to chromatin. ASF1 is a central chaperone
    in the delivery of newly synthesized H3.1–, H3.2– or H3.3–H4 dimers. Histone-free
    ASF1 is phosphorylated by tousled-like kinases (TLKs), promoting histone binding.
    Histones bound by ASF1 are engaged in multiple different co-chaperone complexes,
    which further shields their functional interfaces and facilitates their acetylation,
    nuclear import and storage. Co-chaperoning may be a general paradigm, supporting
    branching of the pathway and the modification of histones ‘on the go’. ASF1 shuttles
    H3.1/H3.2–H4 and H3.3–H4 dimers to the CAF1 and HIRA complexes for replication-coupled
    and replication-independent deposition, respectively. H3.3–H4 dimers are also
    deposited by DAXX–ATRX, whereas the H2A–H2B supply is handled by NAP1 and FACT.
    Histone chaperones also have an important role in the feedback regulation of histone
    supply. Although several histone chaperones are implicated in H3–H4 delivery with
    ASF1, it is still unclear whether other chaperones collaborate with DAXX and NAP1
