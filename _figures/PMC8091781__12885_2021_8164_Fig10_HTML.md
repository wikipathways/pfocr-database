caption: COXIBs and 2,5-DMC counteract the hyperactivated Wnt/β-catenin pathway and
  COX-2/PGE2/EP4 signaling in glioblastoma cells. Arachidonic acid (AA) is released
  from cell membrane via the action of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and converted to prostaglandin
  H2 (PGH2) through the activity of COX-2 enzyme. PGH2 is further transformed to five
  types of prostanoids, including PGE2. Cellular responses of PGE2 are exerted via
  four G-protein coupled receptors, including EP4 receptors. The COX-2/PGE2/EP4 axis
  plays crucial role in GBM development and progression, but it can be counteracted
  by COXIBs and 2,5-DMC. As presented in our study, COXIBs and 2,5-DMC downregulate
  the expression of both COX-2 and PGE2 EP4 (important to note - 2,5-DMC is not indicated
  in this part the Figure for clarity, as it is does not inhibit the enzymatic activity
  of COX-2). Moreover, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is hyperactivated in GBM, mostly
  due to the epigenetic silencing of its extracellular antagonists. In the presence
  of Wnt ligand, the Frizzled receptors make a complex with low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6) and Disheveled (Dvl), resulting in inhibition
  of β-catenin phosphorylation and thus ensuing β-catenin stabilization. The degradation
  complex, consisting of Axin, GSK3β, CK1α and APC is not being formed. Subsequent
  translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus activates TCF/LEF-mediated transcription
  of β-catenin target genes including Axin2, c-MYC, CCND1, BIRC5, and NEDD9. COXIBs
  and 2,5-DMC downregulate their expression, attenuating the Wnt pathway
