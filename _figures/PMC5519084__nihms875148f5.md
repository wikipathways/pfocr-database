caption: Activation of aromatase promoter I.4 and promoters I.3/II in breast adipose
  fibroblasts and promoter I.7 in breast endothelial cells. (A) Glucocorticoid plus
  serum stimulates aromatase promoter I.4. Serum can be substituted with TNFα or one
  of the type I cytokines. Glucocorticoid is obligatory for promoter I.4 stimulation
  by binding to and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which interacts with
  the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) in promoter I.4. TNFα plus glucocorticoid
  induces expression of c-Jun and c-Fos, which heterodimerize and bind to the AP1
  site in promoter I.4. Type I cytokines plus glucocorticoid, on the other hand, activate
  the JAK1/STAT3 pathway, resulting in binding of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 to
  the interferon γ activation site (GAS) in promoter I.4. Sp1 protein binding to its
  binding site is also essential for promoter I.4 stimulation. (B) Promoter I.7 is
  a TATA-less promoter that directs expression of 29–54% of aromatase mRNA species
  in breast cancer. The −299/−35 regulatory region confers maximum basal activity
  in endothelial cells and contains at least three critical endothelial-type motifs,
  including Ets, GATA and E47. The binding of GATA2 protein to the −196/−191 bp site
  is important for baseline promoter activity in endothelial cells. (C) Breast cancer-conditioned
  medium and PGE2 can activate aromatase PI.3/II via the activation and binding of
  various transcription factors to their cis-acting elements, driven by distinct signaling
  pathways. This is accompanied by binding of LRH-1, CREB1, phosphorylated ATF-2 and
  c-Jun, JunB, JunD, and C/EBPβ to the promoter I.3/II regulatory region.
