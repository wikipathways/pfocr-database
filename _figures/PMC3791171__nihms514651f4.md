caption: a | A follicular thyroid cell is shown, which abundantly expresses the molecules
  involved in the uptake and metabolism of iodide (I−), including the sodium–iodide
  symporter (NIS) in the basal membrane, which transports I− coupled with Na+ into
  the cell from the extracellular compartment. I− is then transported into the follicular
  lumen via pendrin in the apical membrane where it is oxidized by thyroid peroxidase
  (TPO) and incorporated into tyrosine amino-acid residues in thyroglobulin (TG) to
  form iodinated TG (TG-I) for the synthesis of thyroid hormone. The whole process
  is upregulated by cyclic AMP (cAMP) signalling that is triggered by the binding
  of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to its receptor (TSHR) in the membrane. With
  normal expression and function of this system, I− is abundantly taken up and accumulated
  in the follicular thyroid cell and in the follicular lumen. b | BRAF-V600E, through
  activating the MAPK pathway in thyroid cancer, causes the silencing of thyroid-specific
  genes and shuts off the iodide-handling machinery. Consequently, I− uptake is reduced
  in the thyroid cell and is sparsely accumulated in the follicular lumen. For simplicity,
  much molecular detail is omitted.
