caption: 'Intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signalling pathways and points of therapeutic
  intervention. Apoptosis can be initiated by signals originating from either the
  plasma membrane via death receptor ligation (extrinsic pathway) or at the mitochondria
  (intrinsic pathway). Stimulation of the extrinsic pathway by tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) results in TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R)
  aggregation and formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), in which
  pro-caspase 8 becomes activated and initiates apoptosis by direct cleavage of downstream
  effector caspases. The addition of either agonistic TRAIL-R1/R2 antibodies or recombinant
  human TRAIL (rhTRAIL) has been used to trigger the extrinsic pathway for therapy.
  The intrinsic pathway is regulated by the B cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 family of proteins,
  which regulate pore formation in the outer mitochondrial membrane and release of
  apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c or second mitochondria-derived activator
  of caspase (SMAC) from the mitochondria. The release of cytochrome c into the cytosol
  triggers caspase-9 activation through the formation of the cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9-containing
  apoptosome complex. SMAC promotes caspase activation through neutralising the inhibitory
  effect of integrin-associated proteins (IAPs). The intrinsic pathway has been targeted
  for therapy either by blocking the inhibitory action of the pro-survival BCL-2 family
  proteins with BH3 mimetics or by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic action of IAPs with
  SMAC mimetics. The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are interconnected, for example,
  by BID, a BH3 domain-containing protein of the BCL-2 family, which, upon cleavage
  by caspase-8, triggers intrinsic apoptosis, thereby further amplifying the signal
  from the extrinsic pathway. Reproduced with the approval of the authors: Fox; MacFarlane.
