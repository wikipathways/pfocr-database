caption: Toxoplasma acquires fatty acids through a complex network of synthesis and
  uptake. A, T. gondii (pink) is an intracellular pathogen capable of fatty acid and
  lipid salvage from the host cell (blue). This process can intersect host cell import
  as well as synthesis routes. B, in addition, the parasite harbors three fatty acid
  synthesis pathways that are localized to different cellular compartments. C, apicoplast
  (green)-localized FASII pathway produces significant amounts of myristic and palmitic
  acid in addition to lipoic acid relying on cytoplasmic glycolysis for precursors.
  E, Toxoplasma also maintains an ER-associated elongase system that synthesizes very
  long chain monounsaturated fatty acids, subsequently using the activity of ELO-B
  and ELO-C. D, T. gondii FASI remains largely uncharacterized. Its stage-specific
  expression pattern and localization are not established. It is also unclear whether
  this megasynthase synthesizes fatty acids de novo like the FASI of humans or acts
  as an elongase for saturated fatty acids, as demonstrated for the FASI of C. parvum.
  Major products are highlighted in red. Des, desaturase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  Mal, malonate; Ac, acetate; vlcFA, very long chain fatty acids.
