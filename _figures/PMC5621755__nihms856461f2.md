caption: 'Schematic illustration of the interaction of AhRR with the canonical and
  non-canonical AhR pathways. AhRR represses the canonical AhR pathway including the
  induction of CYP1A1 via competitive binding with ARNT. AhRR may protect from non-canonical
  AhR-mediated inflammatory responses and inflammation-dependent carcinogenesis via
  interaction of AhRR with RelB in complex with ARNT and/or AhR. Black double arrows
  indicate the interaction of AhRR with ARNT and RelB with AhR. The white double arrow
  indicates the interaction of ARNT with RelB. Abbreviations: Protein kinase A (PKA)'
