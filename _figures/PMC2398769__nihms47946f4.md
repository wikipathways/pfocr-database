caption: Model of progesterone-induced neuroprotective signaling. Progestogen prevents
  synaptic dysfunction associated with aging and neurodegeneration through (1) ligand
  activation of a progesterone receptor, (2) which initiates second messenger signaling
  cascades (3) to promote neuronal survival. These signaling cascades converge on
  mitochondrial function to protect against against toxic insults and include the
  passive prevention signaling pathway and the active protection signaling pathway.
  In the passive prevention signaling pathway, both ERK/CREB/Bcl-2 and Akt pathways
  are simultaneously activated, which (4) enhances mitochondrial function and enables
  neurons to better withstand neurodegenerative insults. The active protection pathway
  acts to block Aβ-induced JNK activation and mitochondrial dysfunction.
