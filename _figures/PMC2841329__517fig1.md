caption: Model for the role of ΔNp73β in the DDR. The data presented by  support a
  model in which ΔNp73β inhibits ATM–p53 signaling. (Left) In normal cells, ΔNp73β
  interacts with 53BP1, and p53 activity is kept in check via MDM2-mediated degradation.
  (Right) In response to dsDNA breaks triggered by DNA damage, the ΔNp73β:53BP1 complex
  is recruited to sites of DNA damage, ATM is activated, and MDM2’s inhibitory effect
  on p53 is alleviated; in the absence of ΔNp73, this pathway is enhanced. Although
  p73 is localized to DNA damage-induced foci under physiological conditions, this
  association is clearly not needed for 53BP1 localization, as 53BP1 localizes to
  sites of DNA damage even in the absence of ΔNp73.
