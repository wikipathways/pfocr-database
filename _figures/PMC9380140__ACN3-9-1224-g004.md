caption: Schematic diagram of enhanced RCAN1.4 by HIF1α in astrocytes under OGD conditions.
  RCAN1.4 inhibits postischemic inflammation in astrocytes via inhibition of the NF‐κB
  signaling pathway. Activation of OGD results in upregulation of HIF1α in the nucleus,
  and HIF1α interacts with the specific HRE in the RCAN1.4 promoter, initiating its
  transcription. By inhibiting the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα protein,
  RCAN1.4 suppresses NF‐κB/p65 nuclear translocation, subsequently alleviating postischemic
  inflammation in astrocytes. OGD, oxygen–glucose deprivation; RCAN1.4, the isoform
  4 of regulator of calcineurin 1.
