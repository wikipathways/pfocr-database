caption: The cloned genes and the major regulatory networks controlling rice size.
  Rice seed size is regulated by multiple signaling pathways, including G protein
  pathways, the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, MAPK signaling pathways, phytohormones,
  and transcription regulatory factors. A dotted line indicates that the genetic relationship
  needs to be further verified. MAPK, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase; AQ, appearance
  quality; MQ, milling quality; ECQ, eating and cooking quality
