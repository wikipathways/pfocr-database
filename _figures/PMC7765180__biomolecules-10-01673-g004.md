caption: (A) Schematic representation of mechanism of VEGFR activation and downstream
  signalling pathways. A covalently linked VEGF dimer (yellow) binds to second and
  third extracellular immunoglobulin (IgG)-like domains of VEGFR that leads to dimerization
  of receptors with homotypic contacts between the fifth and seventh IgG-like domains.
  The complex is also stabilised with additional contacts at transmembrane and juxtamembrane
  regions that leads to phosphorylation of various tyrosine kinase residues that trigger
  downstream pathways such as the Ras-Raf-MEK-Erk pathway, p38-MAPK pathway and PI3K-Akt
  pathway. (B) Location of various tyrosine residues that undergo phosphorylation
  in three different VEGFRs. Domains are juxtamembrane domain, JMD; kinase domain-N-lobe,
  KD-N; kinase domain insert, KD-I; kinase domain-C-lobe, KD-C; and C-terminal tail,
  CT.
