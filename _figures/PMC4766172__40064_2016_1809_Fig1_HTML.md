caption: Schematic representation of lysine degradation pathways in mammals. Lysine
  can be degraded via pipecolate and saccharopine pathways. In the pipecolate pathway,
  that is believed to operate mostly in the brain, lysine is deaminated at the alpha
  nitrogen, and the resulted pipecolic acid is converted to P6C by pipecolate oxidase
  (PIPOX). In the saccharopine pathway that has been demonstrated in several tissues,
  lysine is deaminated at the epsilon nitrogen. In the first reaction step, catalyzed
  by the lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) domain of the aminoadipic semialdehyde
  synthase (AASS), lysine is condensed with α-ketoglutarate to form saccharopine.
  Than the saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH) domain of AASS hydrolyse saccharopine
  into glutamic acid and α-aminoadipic-δ-semialdehyde (AASA). AASA is then oxidized
  to form aminoadipic acid (AAA) by the enzyme aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase
  (AASADH). AASA is in equilibrium with its cyclic form P6C. P6C can be used as substrate
  by the enzyme piperideine-5-carboxilic reductase (P5CR). AAA than proceeds to several
  enzymatic steps catalyzed by the enzymes AADAT (aminoadipate aminotransferase),
  DHTKD1 (dehydrogenase E1 and transketolase domain containing 1), GCDH (glutaryl-CoA
  dehydrogenase), ECHS1 (enoyl-CoA hydratase, short chain, 1), HADH (Hydroxyacyl-coenzyme
  A dehydrogenase) and ACAA2 (acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2) to form acetyl-CoA. Mutations
  in the genes encoding AASADH and GCDH lead to PDE and glutaric aciduria type 1 disease,
  respectively
