caption: (a) Diagrams depict the protein expression levels of SPCH (blue ovals) and
  MUTE (yellow ovals) in stem-cell-like stomatal ACD. The density of ovals represents
  protein amount.(b) Regulatory networks around SPCH. Upstream transcription factors
  responding to developmental or environmental cues can regulate SPCH transcription.
  PIF4 in the high temperature signaling pathway and IDD16 in the organ morphogenesis
  pathway may directly bind to the SPCH promoter and suppress SPCH expression, whilst
  B-GATA in GA signaling promotes SPCH expression. At the protein level, SPCH is tightly
  regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The bHLH transcription factors,
  ICE1 and SCRM2, bring MPK3/6 close to SPCH for phosphorylation. MPK3/6- and BIN2-mediated
  phosphorylation promotes SPCH degradation, whereas the CDKA;1 and KIN10 kinase-mediated
  phosphorylation and the phosphatase PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation promote SPCH
  stabilization. CDKA;1 also phosphorylates SPCH for activation. Downstream of SPCH,
  based on the work from (), SPCH directly regulates the expression of key genes in
  stomatal development, divisional asymmetry, and hormonal signaling, particularly
  BR biosynthesis and signaling (blue box).(c) Regulatory networks around MUTE. MUTE
  (yellow) is expressed in late meristemoids and promotes the cell-fate transition
  to GMC. Based on the work from (), MUTE directly controls the key genes functioning
  in stomatal development and cell-cycle control (green box). An autocrine signaling
  regulation (diagram on the left) was proposed to contribute to the restricted expression
  of MUTE in late meristemoids. MUTE directly induces the expression of ERL1 that
  perceives signaling of the secreted peptide EPF1. Downstream of ERL1, the YDA MAPK
  cascade was suspected to inhibit MUTE function (dashed arrow).
