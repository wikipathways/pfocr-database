caption: 'Structural equation model representing the pathways involved in the association
  between social and lifestyle indicators and cognition. SI, social indicator; LI,
  lifestyle indicator; SVD, small vessel disease; AD, Alzheimer’s disease; CI, confidence
  interval. Each pathway was adjusted for age, sex, and APOE status, yet they were
  not represented here for clarity. Solid arrows represent associations. Dashed bidirectional
  arrows represent correlations. Bolded arrows represent significant associations.
  Estimates presented in the graph are standardized. P values: * < 0.05, ** < 0.01,
  *** < 0.001. Social and lifestyle latent indicators were obtained through a graded
  response model, and circles represent latent variables from SEM. Variables composition:
  early to midlife SI: education, occupational complexity, and salary; latelife LI:
  physical activity, leisure activities, and social network; SVD: white matter hyperintensity
  volume, paraventricular white matter lesions, and deep white matter lesions; AD
  pathology: CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, CSF phosphorylated Tau, and SUVr amyloid-PET; neurodegeneration:
  hippocampal volume, cortical thickness, SUVr FDG-PET, and brain parenchymal fraction;
  cognition: Verbal Fluency, Free and Cued Selective Reminding test, Trail making
  test B, and Rey figure test'
