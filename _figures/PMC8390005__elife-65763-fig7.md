caption: Two possible schemes for protospacer integration are outlined. The pathway
  shown at the left is equivalent to replicative DNA transposition. The pre-spacer
  is nicked at the protospacer 3′-ends, at least one cleavage being adjacent to a
  PAM sequence (shown by the red dash). The 3′-hydroxyls are then transferred to the
  leader-repeat (L–R) and repeat-spacer (R–S) junctions of the target site. Replication
  across L and PS (protospacer) followed by recombination within the duplicated PS
  completes integration. An alternative mode of processing the strand transfer intermediate
  involves removal of the pre-spacer DNA flanking PS, and gap repair by limited DNA
  synthesis and ligation (). The integration pathway shown at the right follows cut-and-paste
  DNA transposition. The steps involve excision of PS from the pre-spacer, strand
  transfer to L-R and R-S junctions, gap repair, and ligation. In either pathway (replicative
  or cut-and-paste), directing the PAM-adjacent 3′-hydroxyl to the L-R junction will
  ensure the functional orientation of the inserted spacer. PAM, protospacer adjacent
  motif.
