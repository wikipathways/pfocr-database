caption: 'Factor H structure and function. (A) Simplified schematic representation
  of Factor H and disease associations. Factor H is composed of 20 homologous complement
  control protein (CCP) domains. The N‐terminal 4 domains bind C3b and contain the
  regulatory functions of Factor H, while the C‐terminal domains 19–20 bind both C3b
  and polyanions to anchor Factor H to cell surfaces. Dense deposit disease (DDD)
  occurs when the N‐terminal domains are impaired or absent (due to Factor H deficiency),
  whereas most mutations in Factor H associated with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome
  (aHUS) are found in the C‐terminus, resulting in defective cell‐surface alternative
  pathway regulation. The Y402H polymorphism in domain 7 is strongly associated with
  the development of age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). (B) Factor H regulatory
  functions. Factor H N‐terminal domains 1–4 regulate the alternative pathway via
  three different mechanisms: (left) competing with Factor B (FB) for binding to C3b;
  (middle) accelerating the decay of the alternative pathway C3 convertase; and (right)
  acting as a cofactor for FI‐mediated cleavage of C3b to iC3b, a C3 fragment that
  cannot bind FB'
