caption: A multi-Rho of plants (ROP) signaling model for secondary cell wall development.
  ROPGEF4 and ROPGAP3 establish the ROP11/MIDD1/kinesin-13A pathway to generate a
  cortical microtubule-absent area by promoting microtubule depolymerization, which
  results in pits of secondary cell walls in metaxylem vessels. Cortical microtubules
  restrict signaling from the ROP11/MIDD1/kinesin-13A pathway and promote local secondary
  cell wall deposition via an unknown ROP pathway and/or an ROP-independent pathway
  that controls targeting of exocytotic vesicles through EXO70A1. An adaptor protein
  such as RIP1/ICR1 might mediate interactions between the putative ROP, exocysts,
  and cortical microtubules. Vesicles from the trans-Golgi network are directly targeted
  to cortical microtubules, and subsequently supply cellulose synthase complexes to
  the cellular sites where microtubules are present.
