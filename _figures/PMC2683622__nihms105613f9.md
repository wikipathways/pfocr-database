caption: Ligand-bound TLR recruits MyD88. TLR-bound MyD88 interacts with several proteins
  including IRFs, TRAF3, IRAK4 and IRAK1. On one hand, activated IRFs and TRAF3 initiates
  signaling cascades that lead to production of type I IFNs. One the other hand, IRAK1
  is activated by IRAK4 in the TLR/MyD88/IRAK receptor complex. Subsequently, PKD1
  is recruited to the TLR/MyD88 receptor complex by interacting with IRAK4 and IRAK1
  and then activated by IRAKs. IRAK1-bound activated PKD1 leaves the TLR/MyD88 receptor
  complex and binds to TRAF6, which allows TRAF6 to interact with IRAK1, and leads
  to the ubiquitination of TRAF6. Ubiquitinated TRAF6 leads to the activation of TAK1,
  which in turn activates signaling cascades that lead to activation of MAPKs and
  NF-κB, and subsequent production of pro- inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

  description: Ligand-bound TLR recruits MyD88. TLR-bound MyD88 interacts with several
    proteins including IRFs, TRAF3, IRAK4 and IRAK1. On one hand, activated IRFs and
    TRAF3 initiates signaling cascades that lead to production of type I IFNs. One
    the other hand, IRAK1 is activated by IRAK4 in the TLR/MyD88/IRAK receptor complex.
    Subsequently, PKD1 is recruited to the TLR/MyD88 receptor complex by interacting
    with IRAK4 and IRAK1 and then activated by IRAKs. IRAK1-bound activated PKD1 leaves
    the TLR/MyD88 receptor complex and binds to TRAF6, which allows TRAF6 to interact
    with IRAK1, and leads to the ubiquitination of TRAF6. Ubiquitinated TRAF6 leads
    to the activation of TAK1, which in turn activates signaling cascades that lead
    to activation of MAPKs and NF-κB, and subsequent production of pro- inflammatory
    cytokines and chemokines.
