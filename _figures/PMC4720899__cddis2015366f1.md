caption: Glucose deprivation (GD) affects c-MYC protein levels in a cell-type-dependent
  manner. GD dephosphorylates and then decreases c-MYC protein stability through PI3K
  signaling pathway and SIRT1 in HeLa cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, c-MYC protein is
  protected by undetermined factors and is not affected by PI3K and SIRT1. Accumulation
  of c-MYC promotes glutamine metabolism through indirectly inducing glutaminase 1
  (GLS1)
