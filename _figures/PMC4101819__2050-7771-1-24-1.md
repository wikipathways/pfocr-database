caption: Key signaling pathways involved in genetic methylation of lymphoid malignancies.
  In WNT pathway, WNT binds to Frizzled and LRP to phosphorylate Dvl and downstream
  degrades complex containing APC, AXIN, CK1α, PPP2R4 and GSK-3β. β-catenin is then
  released and translocated into the nucleus, activating target gene expression. In
  JAK-STAT pathway, cytokines bind to transmembrane receptors and activate JAKs, who
  then activate transcription factors STATs. STATs then translocate into the nucleus
  and initiate target gene transcription. P53 is an important tumor suppressor, and
  functions through both transcription dependent and independent ways. MDM2 is the
  main negative regulator of p53. In lymphoid malignancies, important negative regulatory
  genes (indicated in yellow) are found hypermethylated and down-regulated, resulting
  in aberrantly activated signaling in tumor cells. Targeted therapies for specific
  WNT and JAK-STAT signaling pathways under preclinical and clinical evaluations are
  listed.
