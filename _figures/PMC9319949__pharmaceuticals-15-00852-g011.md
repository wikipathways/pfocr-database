caption: 'An outline of the mechanisms that intercede linagliptin’s amelioration of
  cadmium-evoked testicular impairment. According to the current findings, the proposed
  mechanisms are: (A,A′) Curbing the inflammatory responses, including HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB
  and NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β pathways in the testes of cadmium-intoxicated rats. (B)
  Stimulation of the autophagy response with activation of AMPK/mTOR pathway in the
  testes of cadmium-intoxicated rats. (C) Interference with the pro-apoptotic responses,
  including Bax downregulation, Bcl2 upregulation, and caspase 3 inhibition in the
  testes of cadmium-intoxicated rats. Of note, the beneficial outcomes of linagliptin
  are mainly due to DPP-4 inhibition, which has been linked to marked anti-inflammatory/immune-modulatory
  actions [,]. DPP-4 inhibition triggers several downstream targets, including the
  upregulated protein expression of SDF-1α, which prompts intensified testicular repair
  and regeneration [,]. Moreover, the beheld activation of autophagy may suppress
  the pro-inflammatory responses/NLRP3 inflammasome activation [,] and limit the proapoptotic
  responses [,,] in the testes of cadmium-intoxicated rats. Activation is represented
  by solid arrows, whereas inhibition is depicted by blunt arrows. The question marks
  denote unknown mechanisms.'
