caption: 'During DNA replication, translation and transcription, as well as during
  epigenetic and post-translational modification, DNA is repaired using a number of
  pathways including HR, MMR, NER, BER, NHEJ, and TLS. DNA repair protein expression
  is sensitive to and modulated by hypoxia and oxia. In hypoxic conditions, DNA repair
  pathway protein expression is decreased in many instances, and NER, BER and NHEJ
  proteins involved in the DNA damage response are increased. The primary point of
  action for specific agents and inhibitors are indicated by repair pathways, damage
  response, and as a function of the stage of DNA replication and modification. During
  replication and repair, the hypoxic microenvironment may predispose to a loss of
