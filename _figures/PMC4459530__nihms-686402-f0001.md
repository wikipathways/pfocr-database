caption: NF-κB is a complex signaling cascade that comprises two separate pathways.
  The canonical pathway (left) is activated via signals through a range of cell surface
  receptors, most importantly the B-cell receptor (BCR) and CD40. The activation results
  in the inactivation of IκB, thereby releasing the heterodimers formed by the canonical
  NF-κB subunits RELA, c-REL and p50 to translocate into the nucleus and to activate
  transcription of target genes. The alternative pathway (right) is activated by a
  more limited set of signals, including CD40. Proteasomal degradation of the precursor
  protein p100 results in the generation of the major heterodimer of the alternative
  pathway RELB/p52, which can then enter the nucleus and activate transcription of
  target genes. Only RELA, RELB, and c-REL can drive transcription of target genes
  due to transactivation domains.
