caption: '1Link between O‐linked N‐acetylglucosamine modification (O‐GlcNAcylation)
  and metabolic flux in the regulation of cellular homeostasis. O‐GlcNacylation is
  determined by two key enzymes: O‐GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O‐GlcNAcase (OGA).
  The activities of these two enzymes and substrate availability in each subcellular
  fraction determine the level of O‐GlcNAcylation of target proteins. Although most
  glucose enters the glycolytic or pentose phosphate pathways, approximately 1–5%
  enters the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, which is a branch of glycolysis. Fructose‐6‐phosphate
  and glutamine are converted to glucosamine‐6‐phosphate (GlcN‐6‐P) by glutamine:fructose‐6‐phosphate
  transferase (GFAT). Acetyl coenzyme A (Acetyl‐CoA) then contributes to GlcNAc‐6‐phosphate
  (GlcNAc‐6‐P) synthesis. Uridine diphosphate (UDP)‐GlcNAc is produced using UDP and
  is used by OGT for O‐GlcNAcylation.'
