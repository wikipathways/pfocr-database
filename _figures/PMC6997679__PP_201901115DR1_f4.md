caption: 'Transcriptional regulation of the PAO/phyllobilin pathway during dark-induced
  senescence is mainly affected in pao1. Heat maps represent log2 (FC) of gene expression
  in each of the four studied lines during dark-induced senescence, as indicated in

  ABA insensitive5; COI1, coronatine insensitive1; EEL, enhance em level; EIN, ethylene
  insensitive; ELF3, early flowering3; ERF17, ethylene response factor17; MYC, myelocytomastosis;
  NAC, NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2 domain protein; NAP, NAC-like, activated by PA3/PI;
  ORE1, oresara1; phyB, phytochrome B; PIF, phytochrome interacting factor; PYL9,
  pyrabactin resistance1-like9; SnRK2, Ser/Thr kinase2; SOC1, suppressor of overexpression
  of coi1. WT, wild type.'
