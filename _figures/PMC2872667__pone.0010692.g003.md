caption: Direct interaction network models constructed by Pathway Architect analysis
  of the differentially expressed transcript in the lumbar spine and iliac crest trabecular
  bone. Up-regulated transcripts are indicated red whilst the down-regulated are shown
  in green. Arrows link interacting genes and positive (+) and negative (−) associations
  are marked respectively. Green boxes denote regulation, blue boxes binding and orange
  circles indicating phosphorylation.
