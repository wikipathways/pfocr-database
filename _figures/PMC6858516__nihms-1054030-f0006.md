caption: Lineage plasticity has been increasingly observed in patients with metastatic
  castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with androgen receptor pathway
  inhibitors (ARPIs) to drive prostate cancer from an adenocarcinoma histology towards
  a neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) phenotype. This change is associated with
  loss of androgen receptor (AR) expression, combined loss of RB1 and TP53, and distinct
  epigenetic changes. In preclinical studies, inhibition of the epigenetic regulator
  EZH2 has a potential role in reversing the phenotype back towards an AR+ adenocarcinoma
  to regain responses to enzalutamide (ENZ). adeno, adenocarcinoma; EZH2i, EZH2 inhibition;
  tNEPC, treatment-related NEPC.
