caption: Proposed roles of LDs in P. kessleri cells in response to salt stress. The
  light or dark green membranes imply variations of FA composition or surface of membrane.
  Different colors of LDs suggest diverse roles (yellow LDs are involved in membrane
  remodeling, orange LDs contain chlorophyll, purple LDs are related to cytoplasmic
  component recycling, and blue LDs harbor proteins for future use). The day 0 image
  depicts cells that were just transferred into 350 mm NaCl-containing TAP medium.
  The day 6 image depicts cells that were incubated in 350 mm NaCl-containing medium
  for 6 d. FAS II, Fatty acid synthesis pathway.
