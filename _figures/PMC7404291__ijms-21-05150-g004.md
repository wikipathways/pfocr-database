caption: HSV-1 evasion mechanisms to downregulate the host innate immune response.
  Multiple steps in the downstream signaling pathways following PRR activation are
  targeted by HSV-1 proteins to limit detection by the innate immune system. HSV-1
  can directly inhibit the DNA sensors cGAS and IFI16, and the RNA sensors TLR3, RIG-I
  and MDA5 as well the accumulation of viral DNA in the cytoplasm. HSV-1 also inhibits
  downstream signaling molecules including MyD88, TRAF3, TRAF6, I-κBα, STING, and
  TBK-1 to prevent the nuclear translocation of IRF3/7 and NF-κB, preventing IFN and
  cytokine production. HSV-1 also inhibits IRF3/7 and NF-κB directly. HSV-1 has also
  evolved to inhibit the IFN signaling pathway directly, inhibiting JAK1 phosphorylation
  as well as STAT1 phosphorylation and its translocation to the nucleus, downregulating
  ISG production. Solid lines represent downstream activation, dashed lines represent
  translocation.
