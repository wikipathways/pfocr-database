caption: A) The role of ARs in inflammatory responses in NAFLD. ARs are G protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCRs) that regulate adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity. A3AR stimulation
  triggers increase of AC activity and cAMP production. cAMP activates protein kinase
  B (PKB), which is a negative regulator of inflammatory NF-kB pathway and glycogen
  synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) mediated cell apoptosis. B) There are various AR
  inhibitors. Namodenoson, a potent and selective A3AR agonist was evaluated in Phase
  2 trials for the treatment of NAFLD and NASH. The drug successfully met the endpoints
  with 60 patients and the optimal dosage. The Phase IIb NASH trial of namodenoson
  is currently underway.
