caption: 'A) Bar graph showing the average fold change in gene expression between
  R and NR for CD4 T cells (top), pTfh (middle), and non-pTfh (bottom) using fold
  change cutoff >1.5. Red bars correspond to gene expression that was higher in R
  compared to NR and Green bars indicate higher gene expression in NR compared to
  R. B) Gene networks were generated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software
  and combined DEGs from the 3 cell types in (A) as input. Colors in the network are
  defined as follows: red indicates up-regulation in R vs NR, green indicates up-regulation
  in NR vs R, and white indicates the molecule was added from the Ingenuity Knowledge
  Base. Solid lines indicate direct interaction and dashed lines indicate indirect
  interaction. C) The top 5 upstream regulators were determined using IPA software
  and combined DEGs from the 3 cell types in (A) as input. The overlap p-values show
  statistically significant overlap by Fisher’s exact test between dataset genes and
  the genes that are known to be regulated by a particular molecule.'
