caption: Summary of the effects of inhibiting TGF-β signaling pathways on hCECs in
  vitro. The figure illustrates the main TGF-β signaling pathways. The names of the
  inhibitors are indicated inside rectangles. The pink and blue squares summarize
  the inhibitory effects on ECD or anti-EndMT. “+” indicates a positive effect (significantly
  different from the control) for both tested inhibitors of the same signaling pathway,
  “±” indicates that at least one of the two tested inhibitors did not show a significant
  difference, and “−” indicates a negative effect (significantly different from control)
  for both inhibitors of the same signaling pathway. Supplementary Data S1. Process
  of analyzing the EndMT by cell shape
