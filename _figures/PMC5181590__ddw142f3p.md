caption: Specific intracellular signalling pathways are predicted to be abnormally
  activated in resting HD monocytes. IPA analysis of upstream regulators of gene transcription
  identified numerous signalling pathway components downstream of the TLR4 receptor
  which are predicted to be abnormally activated in resting HD monocytes. Upstream
  regulators with significantly inferred activation are shown in orange (darker colour
  = higher activation z-score). The activation z-score for each component is also
  shown (>2 or < −2 is considered to be significant).
