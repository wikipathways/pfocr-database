caption: 'Pathways for major lipid metabolism. A: cholesterol biosynthesis. B: triglyceride
  biosynthesis and fatty acid oxidation. Major metabolic enzymes and intermediates
  are shown. Genes identified by Affymetrix and confirmed by quantitative real-time
  PCR and/or Western blot analysis are shown in color. Upregulated genes were shown
  in red, and downregulated genes in green. Genes marked with * are under SREBP-1
  regulation. Biological pathway analysis was performed by using GenMAPP Pathway (http://www.genmapp.org/).'
