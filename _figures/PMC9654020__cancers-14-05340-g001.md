caption: Classical signaling pathways of the unfolded protein response, and Ca2+ leakage
  under ERS (endoplasmic reticulum stress). Various adverse factors cause ERS within
  tumor cells, such as chemocytotoxicity, nutrition deprivation, production of ROS
  (reactive oxygen species), etc. Increasing ERS leads to ERAD (ER-associated degradation)
  and arousal of the ERSR. The UPR is the main part of the ERSR. When unfolded or
  misfolded proteins aggregate in the ER lumen, Grp78/BiP dissociates from sensor
  proteins ATF6, IRE1, and PERK on the ER membrane, triggering a downstream signaling
  cascade. Activated ATF6 migrates to the Golgi apparatus, and is cleaved to transform
  into a transcriptional factor, which regulates the transcription of UPR genes including
  XBP1. Activated PERK is able to phosphorylate eIF2α and mobilize ATF4 to promote
  cellular adaptation. Functional transcriptional factors that are mobilized in the
  UPR will translocate to the nucleus, and exert multiple biological effects that
  promote protein synthesis attenuation, ER chaperones expression, cell cycle arrest,
  inflammation, autophagy, or apoptosis. Apart from activating XBP1 and the subsequent
  expression of CHOP, IRE1 is also able to promote pro-inflammatory JNK activation
  through activating TRAF2, which may impact cell fate by regulating BCL-2 family
  proteins or caspase-12 (or caspase-4 in human cells). Under ERS, another important
  alteration that impacts cell fate is Ca2+ leakage from the ER. Ca2+ leaked from
  the ER may induce apoptosis by activating the mitochondria pathway or caspase-12
  (or caspase-4) on the ER membrane, or promote autophagy by activating DAPK1 or by
  inhibiting mTOR through the CAMKK2-AMPK pathway.
