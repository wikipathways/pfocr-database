caption: A simplified metabolic flux map depicting net metabolic fluxes in untreated
  HUVECs. All numbers are given in nmol/cells/hr. Carbon sources in the final model
  are indicated in light blue boxes. To simplify PPP pathway visualization, only the
  unique metabolites formed in each reaction are depicted along with the net PPP-based
  production of F6P and G3P. Full information on reaction schemes, atom transition
  specifications, and fluxes can be found in .
