caption: Proposed mechanism of DSF against renal fibrosis via inhibition of PIK3/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway. TGF-β activates the PI3K pathway, leading to the activation of
  Akt. Activated Akt then stimulates the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling is involved
  in cell growth, proliferation, and survival, and its activation can contribute to
  fibrotic processes. TGF-β binding to its receptors leads to the phosphorylation
  of SMAD proteins. Phosphorylated SMADs form a complex and translocate to the nucleus,
  where they regulate the expression of fibrosis-related genes, contributing directly
  to renal fibrosis. DSF was found to interact stably with both PIK3CA/PIK3R1 and
  mTOR during 100 ns MD simulation
