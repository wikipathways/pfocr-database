caption: 'The vicious cycle of bone metastases in the osteoblastic pathway, in which
  tumor cells secrete other factors (interleukins, prostaglandin e, tumor necrosis
  factor, and macrophage-stimulating factor). Parathyroid hormone-related protein
  induces osteoclastogenesis by upregulating the RANK ligand. The activated osteoclasts
  in turn produce transforming growth factor-beta and insulin growth factor which
  promote cancer cell growth. in the osteoblastic vicious cycle, breast cancer cells
  produce osteoblast-stimulating factors, such as bone morphogenic protein, fibroblast
  growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor. Parathyroid hormone-related protein
  is also overexpressed. it activates endothelin-1, which downregulates Dickkopf-1,
  a negative regulator of osteoblastogenesis. The activated osteoblasts in turn produce
  factors including interleukin-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, vascular endothelial
  growth factor, MIP-2, which facilitate breast cancer cell colonization and survival
  upon arrival in the bone microenvironment. In reality, there is a complex interplay
  between the two cycles.,,,Abbreviations: BMP, bone morphogenic protein; IGF, insulin
