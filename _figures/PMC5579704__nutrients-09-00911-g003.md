caption: 'Proposed mechanisms by which dietary polyphenols inhibit EMT and cancer
  metastasis. The most important extracellular signals are shown, and these promote
  the epithelial to mesenchymal transition by binding to individual membrane receptors,
  eventually activating specific EMT-inducing transcription factors (snail, Zeb, and/or
  twist). The effect of the polyphenols on specific proteins in the signaling pathways
  at different levels remains to be elucidated. TGF-β: transforming growth factor

  Tumor necrosis factor-α; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells; GLI 1: glioma-associated oncogene 1; ERK: extracellular regulated protein
  kinases; AKT: protein kinase B.'
