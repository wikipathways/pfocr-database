caption: Pathway of phagosome biogenesis, maturation, and phagolysosome fusion for
  efficient clearance of Mtb. Ploys of immunoevasion via Mtb virulence factors are
  also shown. (1) Mycobacterium deploys several factors that subvert the phagosome
  biogenesis, maturation and acidification steps that follow its internalisation.
  Pathogenic Mycobacteria reside within compartments devoid of lysosomal contents
  because of blocking of Ca2+ fluxes and receive nutrients through modulation of Rab‐dependent
  vesicular trafficking. LAM and PIM drive these processes. (2) Mycobacterial phagosomes
  (Bottom) through various proteins counter the independent stress factors such as
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS); however, immunological
  activation with TNFα or IFN‐γ results in the maturation of phagosomes by the maturation
  marker expression and lysosomal fusion (Their distinct markers and associated proteins
  are represented with Grey Font). (3) LAM inhibits Ca2+ influx and PI3P‐dependent
  delivery of lysosomal components (V‐ATPase and Cathepsin) from the Trans‐Golgi network
  (TGN) to the phagosome. (4) Mycobacterium, perhaps through secretory acid phosphatase
  (SapM), targets small GTPases – Rabs, Rhos or ARFs – to affect Coronin‐1/TACO‐dependent
  actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and phagosome maturation. (5) The mycobacterial
  protein tyrosine phosphatase (PtpA) inhibits V‐ATPase and phagosomal acidification.
  (6) The nucleotide diphosphate kinase (NDK‐1) of mycobacterium may inactivate small
  GTPase Rac‐1 and attenuate NADPH oxidase‐mediated host protection. (7) Lprl, a mycobacterial
  Lipoprotein, inactivates the lysozyme. (8) The Type‐I NADH dehydrogenase and Eis
  protein inhibit the NADPH oxidase activity limiting the ROS availability. (9) Mycobacterium
  effectively attenuates NO production by interfering with EBP50 and iNOS recruitment.
  (10) The mammalian cell entry protein‐Mce4 scavenges cholesterol from host membranes
  and potentiates lipid body accumulation and mycobacterial survival. (11) Early secretory
  antigenic target‐6 (ESAT‐6), a major virulence factor that controls NF‐κB and interferon‐regulatory
  factors, and CFP‐10 engineer vacuolar escape and intracellular survival of Mycobacterium.
  (12) Mtb hitchhikes intracellular Fe2+ stores a major siderophore mediating this
  process is Carboxymycobactin. (13) ESX‐3 secretion system (composed of EsxG and
  EsxH) leads to impairment of ESCRT‐mediated endomembrane repair. (14) ESX‐1 mediates
  the process of phagosomal to cytosolic translocation. (15) A potent phagosomal maturation
  and intracellular degradation of Mtb by the acquisition of indicated markers (Grey
  fonts). Results in potentiation of APC‐T‐cell antigenic presentation pathway and
  confers T cell‐based protection against the bacterium. (16) In contrast, the association
  between Mtb virulence factors (Factors that are associated with Mtb are shown in
  pink colour) and potent immunosuppression, steps of phagosomal, maturation, acidification,
  neutralisation/detoxification of redox stress and inhibition of autophagic processes
  together induce permissive niches for Mtb replication and dissemination.
