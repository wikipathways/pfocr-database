caption: The miR-204 in MSC-exo directly targeted the Il-6r gene and suppressed the
  activation of IL-6R/Stat3 pathway, resulting in the M1 macrophages in the dry eye
  cornea to reprogram toward immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. MSC-exo, which are enriched
  in miR-204, could restore the ocular surface homeostasis by switching M1 to M2 and
  ameliorate the inflammatory destruction during the GVHD-associated dry eye disease.
