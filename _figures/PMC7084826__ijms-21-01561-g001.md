caption: Schematic overview of the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway highlighting
  newly discovered inputs and outputs. BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) and BRI1-ASSOCIATED
  KINASE1 (BAK1) form the core BR receptor complex, which forms upon ligand binding
  and initiates the canonical BR signalling pathway by phosphorylating BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALLING
  KINASES or CONSTITUTIVE DIFFERENTIAL GROWTH1 (BSKs/CDG1), which, in turn, activate
  the phosphatase BRI1 SUPPRESSOR1 (BSU1). BSU1 deactivates BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE2
  (BIN2), which in the absence of BR phosphorylates BR-responsive transcription factors
  to prevent their nuclear translocation. Activity of the receptor complex can be
  influenced by sugar levels, through an unknown mechanism, and by cell wall state
  through RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN44 (RLP44), which promotes interaction of receptor
  and co-receptor. The canonical BR signalling pathway can also be activated by EXCESS
  MICROSPOROCYTES1 (EMS1), which seems to precede BRI1 in the plant lineage, suggesting
  that responsiveness to BRs was acquired by evolution of BR binding in the BRI1 extracellular
  domain and co-option of the pre-existing signal transduction cascade. Besides the
  canonical BR signalling pathway, BRI1 also acts through the indicated outputs (plasma
  membrane (PM)-ATPase, G-proteins, TGF-β receptor interacting protein/eIF3 eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor subunit homolog (TRIP-1), and BR signalling-independent
  control of RLP44 expression), demonstrating the complexity of BRI1-mediated signalling.
  Scaffolding and pathway component concentration by TETRATRICOPEPTIDE-REPEAT THIOREDOXIN-LIKE
  proteins (TTLs) and BSK3 is indicated as well as receptor clustering and plasma
  membrane subcompartmentalization by remorin proteins (rounded rectangles). Potential
  BRI1-RLK interactors are depicted, whereas the BR and TPD1 ligands are omitted for
  clarity. Black arrows indicate protein–protein interaction and/or post-translational
  modification, red arrow indicates transcriptional regulation, brown arrows indicate
  control through unknown mechanism.
