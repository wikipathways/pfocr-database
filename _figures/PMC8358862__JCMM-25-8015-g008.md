caption: Scheme of the protective effects of PB2 on CS‐induced liver injury. A, Direct
  effects. PB2 induces autophagy activation and inhibits the Shh signalling pathway
  to alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress through inhibition of Txnip/NLRP3
  as well as TLR4/NF‐κB, and activation of Nrf2/Keap1 and AMPK/GSK3β signalling pathways,
  which improves CS‐induced liver injury. B, Compensatory effects. Inhibition of the
  Shh signalling pathway may promote the compensatory effect of autophagy activation,
  thereby reducing the sensitivity of mice to CS. Inhibits the Shh signalling pathway
  and enhances PB2‐induced autophagy activation, thereby enhancing the ability of
  PB2 to protect liver injury in mice
