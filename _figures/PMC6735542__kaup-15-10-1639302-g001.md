caption: The role of SLC3A2 in regulation of autophagy activation and cell radiosensitivity.
  (A) In HNSCC cells, SLC3A2 and its light chain subunit SLC7A5 play an important
  role in transport of essential amino acids (EAA) such as histidine, isoleucine,
  leucine, methionine, valine, tryptophan, phenylalanine and threonine as well as
  conditionally essential ones such as cysteine and tyrosine. This amino acid transport
  is important for biosynthesis, energy production in the tricarboxylic acid cycle
  (TCA cycle), and activation of the MTOR signaling pathway. SLC3A2 is also associated
  with the cystine (CSSC) transporter SLC7A11 which is critical for synthesis of glutathione,
  one of the major scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS). (B) Blocking of the
  SLC3A2-dependent amino acid transport inhibits the MTOR pathway, downregulates the
  TCA cycle and restrains tumor cell proliferation. This results in the activation
  of autophagy as a pro-survival mechanism.
