caption: The effect of omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols in the regulation of the
  inflammatory response. Omega-3 fatty acids inhibit the inflammatory response by
  inhibiting PGE2 which promotes inflammation and NF-κB either directly, via the interaction
  with the transcriptional factors PPARs, or by inhibiting TLR2/4 which normally activates
  NF-κB. Moreover, omega-3 fatty acids regulate inflammation by activating MAPK and
  GPR120 which in turn inhibits inflammation. Polyphenols inhibit the inflammatory
  response by directly inhibiting NF-κB, or via the PPARs. They also promote fatty
  acid b-oxidation and inhibit VCAM-1, ICAM-1, MAPK pathway, PGE2 and COX-2 that all
  promote chronic inflammation (PGE2 –prostaglandin 2; NF-κB – nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; PPARs – peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors; TLR2/4–
  toll-like receptor; MAPK – mitogen-activated protein kinase; GPR120 – G-protein
  coupled receptor 120; VCAM-1 – vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; ICAM-1 – intracellular
  cell adhesion molecule 1; COX-2 – cyclooxygenase 2; TNF-α – tumour necrosis factor
  alpha; MCP-1 – monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; AMPK – AMP kinase).
