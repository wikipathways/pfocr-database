caption: Translation of HIF-1α protein under normoxic conditions is mainly dependent
  on the activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. HIF-1α is hydroxylated by
  PHD under normoxic conditions and subsequently binds to VHL protein to form a complex.
  The complex in turn recruits ubiquitin ligases to target HIF-1α for proteasomal
  degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, H2S induces phosphorylation of eIF2α, thereby
  inhibiting HIF-1α translation. In addition, H2S reverses hypoxia-induced inhibition
  of PHD activity and thus promotes the degradation of HIF-1α. HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1α; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase; VHL, von Hippel-Lindau; H2S, hydrogen sulfide;
  eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α.
