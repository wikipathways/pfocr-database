caption: Summary of the AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways. Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase
  (PI3K) is activated when growth factors bind to their receptors. Phosphatidylinositol
  bisphosphate (PIP2) is converted by PI3K into phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate
  (PIP3). This leads to activation of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1
  (PDK1). PDK1 phosphorylates Akt1 to partially activate it and prime it for further
  activation. Full activation is dependent on an additional phosphorylation of Akt1by
  mTORC2, a complex that includes the kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  and the regulatory subunit Rictor. Akt1 phosphorylates and activates the mTORC1
  complex that contains mTOR and the regulatory subunit Raptor. mTORC1 phosphorylates
  the translation repressor 4EBP and inactivates it. AMPK is known to inhibit mTORC1
  activation at multiple levels. More detail can be found in Refs. , . We propose
  that cordycepin activates AMPK by an unknown mechanism and that active AMPK somehow
  also inhibits mTORC2 activity (interactions shown in red), leading to a double block
  of the mTOR signaling pathway.
