caption: 'Targeting Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway for pancreatic cancer prevention
  and therapy. Several strategies have been proposed to target the Nrf2 signaling
  pathway in human pancreatic cancer: (1) modulating Nrf2 expression at the transcriptional
  level, (2) modulating the Nrf2 activity by targeting its upstream activators and
  stabilizers, (3) affecting the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, (4) targeting the
  Keap1-Nrf2 binding for modulating Nrf2 protein stability, (5) targeting the β-TrCP-Nrf2
  binding or the HRD1-Nrf2 binding and modulating Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation,
  (6) modulating the binding of Nrf2 with its co-activators in the nucleus, and (7)
  modulating the binding of Nrf2 with its downstream target genes. Many small-molecule
  Nrf2 activators and inhibitors have been discovered and shown efficacy in pancreatic
  cancer cells in vitro and in vivo'
