caption: 'The 495 differentially regulated proteins described in  were subjected to
  functional and canonical pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity
  Systems Inc). Shown here is a metabolic map illustrating the dynamic changes in
  host biosynthetic and catabolic pathways occurring during HCV infection. Each horizontal
  row represents a differentially regulated protein identified by its gene symbol
  and each vertical column represents an individual infection condition. Abundance
  ratios for the various samples appear in the following order from left to right:
  infection with HCVcc at 24, 48 and 72 h (columns 1, 2, and 3, respectively) or UV-HCVcc
  at 24, 48 and 72 h (columns 4, 5, and 6, respectively). Protein abundance ratios
  are colored according to the fold changes and the color scale indicates the magnitude
  of fold change. Black squares indicate no change in protein abundance. Gray squares
  indicate missing data. HCV infection induces a unique proteomic profile indicative
  of marked disruptions in cellular metabolic homeostasis. The limited overlap, and
  in some cases magnitude, of protein up-regulation in actively growing cells exposed
  to UV-inactivated virus further suggests that infectious HCVcc specifically institutes
  its own metabolic program by considerably stimulating host biosynthetic activities
  supporting viral growth. See text and Supplementary  for more detail including correlation
  of gene symbol with protein name.'
