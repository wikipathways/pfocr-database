caption: 'Main cellular metabolic pathways modulated by CO: mitochondrial metabolism,
  glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway. Low levels of CO enhance TCA, improve
  mitochondrial OXPHOS, increase oxygen consumption and production of ATP. Accordingly,
  in most of the tested models (cell type and pathophysiological conditions) CO decreases
  glycolysis. Finally CO modulates redox processes: ROS appear as signaling molecules
  for CO mode of action and one of the cytoprotective properties of CO is anti-oxidant.
  Thus it is not surprising that CO also stimulates PPP, a critical pathway responsible
  to maintaining the reducing capacity of the cell, as well as the cellular nucleotides
  pool.'
