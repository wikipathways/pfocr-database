caption: 'Approach to develop, endorse and reuse smaller AOP units for the AOP-KB.
  A, As much as KEs are the modular building blocks of the AOP universe, KERs represent
  the causal knowledge of biological events, and are thus the most critical components
  of any AOP or AOP network. The smallest unit that is of any real value for regulatory
  purposes is 2 KEs connected by one KER (i), the second smallest is 3 KEs linked
  by 2 KERs (ii), with ever-increasing complexity as more KEs and KERs are added in
  a linear or branched manner (iii). B, With fully developed, peer reviewed and endorsed
  units that themselves are smaller than an AOP, the development of new AOPs will
  be fast-tracked by way of adopting and reusing these units when developing new AOPs.
  As exemplified, a small network of well-established biological pathways (left box)
  could form the basis for numerous new AOPs (right box; here exemplified by actual
  AOP-wiki entries pertaining to perturbed androgen signaling). Abbreviations: AOP,
  adverse outcome pathway; KB, knowledge base; KE, key event; KER, key event relationship.'
