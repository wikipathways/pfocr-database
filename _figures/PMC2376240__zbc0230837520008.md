caption: H. pylori stimulates cancer cell motility through the combined CagA-dependent
  and -independent signaling. CagA is injected into the cell via the α5β1 integrin
  and associates with known regulators of cell adhesion and motility. CagA-independent
  activation of the β1 integrin signaling pathway leads to Src-induced JNK stimulation,
  which in combination with FAK causes paxillinTyr-118 phosphorylation. Although both
  CagA-dependent and CagA-independent signaling pathways are necessary, neither pathway
  is sufficient by itself for H. pylori-induced cell motility.
