caption: ECM–cell communication is dictated by focal-adhesion players. Activation
  of integrins by talin induces multiple downstream signaling cascades via formation
  and functional activation of the focal-adhesion complex. The integrity of focal
  adhesions is constitutively maintained by active interaction between the focal-adhesion
  complex players (such as FAK, paxilin, and Src) downstream that regulate phosphorylation
  and activation of the PI3K/AKT survival pathway resulting in anoikis resistance,
  increased angiogenesis, and survival after cell detachment from the ECM. ERK1/2
  and GSK-3β are concurrently activated conferring not only a survival advantage for
  the tumor cells but also promoting the migratory and invasive properties via induction
  of EMT.
