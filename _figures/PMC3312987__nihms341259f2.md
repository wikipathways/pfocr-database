caption: Commonly mutated pathways in glioblastoma. Large-scale integrated genomic
  analyses of human glioblastoma showed that virtually every tumor harbored mutations
  in genes encoding components of the RTK/RAS/PI3K, p53, and RB signaling pathways.
  The RTK/RAS/PI3K pathway transduces extracellular growth factor signals into cellular
  responses of growth, proliferation and survival. Binding of growth factors to the
  extracellular domain of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) induces RTK dimerization
  and autophosphorylation, leading to downstream activation of the small G-protein
  RAS by promoting exchange of GDP for GTP (depicted by color change from white to
  pink), and recruitment and activation of PI3K. PI3K is a lipid kinase that phosphorylates
  PIP2 to generate PIP3. A cascade of effectors are activated downstream of elevated
  PIP3 levels, with activation of the serine/threonine kinase AKT as one of the most
  well-characterized components of PI3K signaling. PTEN is a lipid phosphatase that
  directly reverses the effects of PI3K, thus negatively regulating the pathway. RAS
  activity is negatively regulated by GTPase Activating Proteins (GAPs) including
  NF1, which facilitate the hydrolysis of RAS-GTP to RAS-GDP. In HGG, aberrant activation
  of the RTK/RAS/PI3K pathway is most commonly caused by amplification, overexpression
  or constitutive activation of RTKs, activating mutations in PI3K or its regulatory
  subunits, and loss of function mutations in PTEN and NF1.The CDKN2A locus encodes
  for two separate tumor suppressor proteins, INK4A and ARF, which negatively regulate
  two separate signaling cascades. In response to mitogenic signals, the family of
  Cyclin D proteins binds to CKD4 or CDK6 and phosphorylate RB, driving the transition
  from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle. INK4A is a tumor suppressor
  that binds to and inhibits Cyclin D/CDK4/6 complexes, thus inhibiting cell cycle
  progression. ARF binds to HDM2 and inhibits its E3 ubiquitinase activities, resulting
  in p53 stabilization. p53 is a tumor suppressor involved in maintenance of genomic
  stability, cell cycle checkpoints, senescence and cell death. In HGG, frequent loss
  of function mutations occur in the tumor suppressors p53, ARF, INK4A and at lower
  frequency, RB. The pathways may also be disrupted by amplification of Cyclin D,
  CDK4 or 6, or HDM2, resulting in misregulation of cell cycle progression, apoptosis
  and senescence programs.
