caption: Multiple oxidative stress factors induce pneumonia and AMPK-Nrf2 pathway
  inhibits pulmonary ROS accumulation. Pulmonary ROS accumulation mainly caused by
  pulmonary lesions and endocrine/metabolic disorders. Trigger factors include chronic
  inflammation response induced by damage of pulmonary cells (alveolar epithelial
  cells, alveolar cells, lung fibroblasts, and others) and infiltration of immune
  cells in the lungs, as well as the impaired redox homeostasis induced by metabolic
  disease-related insulin resistance, adipocytes accumulation, and mitochondrial dysfunction.
  Accumulated ROS can cause damage to the immune system and colonization of pathogens,
  both of which increase pulmonary susceptibility and cause pneumonia. Meanwhile,
  ROS can also trigger several antioxidant pathways regulated by AMPK. Among them,
  the antioxidant effect of AMPK-Nrf2-AREs plays a key role. The activation of this
  pathway can inhibit the accumulation of ROS in the lungs to prevent or alleviate
  pneumonia.
