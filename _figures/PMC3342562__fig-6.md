caption: Schematic representation of the role of H2S in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis
  is manifested by vascular inflammation, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, and
  endothelial damage. An increase in H2S inhibits proliferation of smooth muscle cells
  via up-regulation of ERK1/2 and p21Cip/WAF-1 phosphorylation and down-regulation
  of cyclin D1. H2S can attenuate inflammatory cytokine–induced endothelial dysfunction.
  Meanwhile, H2S also suppresses foam cell formation. (To see this illustration in
  color the reader is referred to the web version of this article at www.liebertonline.com/ars).
  VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme.
