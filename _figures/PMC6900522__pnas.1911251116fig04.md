caption: Model for GUN1 function in tetrapyrrole metabolism. (A) In the dark GUN1
  represses flow through the tetrapyrrole pathway (as observed under conditions in
  which flow is artificially increased via feeding of 5-aminolevulinic acid [ALA]),
  but promotes FC1 activity to ensure a sufficient supply of heme to cellular locations
  outside of the plastids. It may also prevent release of the retrograde signal through
  heme binding. (B) In the light GUN1 is degraded by the ClpC protease promoting total
  tetrapyrrole synthesis required for chloroplast development. Under these conditions,
  FC1 activity is no longer promoted, but the increased tetrapyrrole flux ensures
  a sufficient supply of substrate to FC1 to supply heme to cellular locations outside
  of the plastids. The absence of GUN1 also permits release of the retrograde signal.
  (C) After inhibition of chloroplast function (for example with norflurazon that
  causes an inhibition of tetrapyrrole synthesis) the presence of GUN1 prevents a
  retrograde signal. (D) Under these dysfunctional conditions the absence of GUN1
  promotes tetrapyrrole synthesis and retrograde signal release. I, CHLI; D, CHLD;
  H/GUN5, CHLH; and FC, ferrochelatase.
