caption: Mechanisms that may result in perturbed neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis in Alzheimer’s
  disease. Sequential cleavages of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase
  (β) and γ-secretase (γ) generates the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). Aβ forms oligomers
  which can insert into the plasma membrane and form pores through which Ca2+ passes
  into the cytoplasm. The interaction of Aβ with the plasma membrane may be facilitated
  by binding to phosphatidylserine (PtdS); age/AD-related mitochondrial impairment
  (ATP depletion) may trigger flipping of PtdS from the inner portion of the plasma
  membrane to the cell surface. The PtdS flipping may also result from Ca2+ influx
  or release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria which can activate
  a phospholipid scramblase (PLSCR1). Aβ can also interact with Fe2+ and Cu+ to generate
  hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical (OH.) resulting in membrane lipid peroxidation
  which generates toxic aldehydes that impair the function of membrane ion-motive
  ATPases (Na+ and Ca2+ pumps). As a result the membrane becomes depolarized and glutamate
  receptor channels (NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) and voltage-dependent Ca2+
  channels (VDCC) open and flux toxic amounts of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. In addition,
  Aβ acts on mitochondria (either directly or indirectly by causing elevated cytoplasmic
  Ca2+ levels and oxidative stress) to cause increased free radical (superoxide anion
  radical; O2−) production, Ca2+ overload and decreased ATP production. Amyloidogenic
  processing also generates an intracellular APP domain (AICD) which can translocate
  to the nucleus and modify gene transcription in ways that perturb Ca2+ homeostasis.
  Studies of the presenilins (PS) have implicated ER Ca2+ mishandling in AD. PS functions
  as an ER Ca2+ leak channel and FAD PS mutations impair this Ca2+ leak channel function
  resulting in excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in the ER and, as a consequence, enhances
  Ca2+ release through ryanodine receptor (RyR) and IP3 receptor (IP3R) channels.
  There is also evidence that PS can interact directly or indirectly with RyR and
  SERCA (smooth endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase) to alter ER Ca2+ release and uptake.
  Interaction of the protein reelin with the apolipoprotein E receptor (ApoER2) enhances
  Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptor channels by a mechanism involving a src family
  tyrosine kinsase (SFk); ApoE can block this effect of reelin. Finally, amyloidogenic
  APP processing may prevent α-secretase (α) cleavage of APP which would otherwise
  generate a secreted form of APP (sAPPα). sAPPα is normally produced in response
  to synaptic activity and is known to activate a signaling pathway involving cyclic
  guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) that activates K+ channels, thereby hyperpolarizing
  the membrane and reducing Ca2+ influx. The mechanisms illustrated here include abundant
  targets for therapeutic intervention (see also ) and one drug that targets the NMDA
  receptor (memantine) is currently used to treat AD patients.
