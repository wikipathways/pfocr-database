caption: This model schematically illustrates the various molecular mechanisms that
  can contribute to negative regulation of SMAD signaling and thereby to a loss of
  transforming growth factor (TGF)β-induced growth inhibition. Inactivating mutations
  or loss of expression of components of the TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway are not depicted
  here but may also be important. For details, see text.
