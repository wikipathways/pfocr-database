caption: The schematic of PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. T lymphocyte (T cell) plays an
  important role in killing cancer cells when surface T cell receptors (TCR) recognize
  and bind to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Programmed death
  ligand 1 (PD-L1, CD274) is a kind of immune checkpoint protein, which is highly
  expressed in part of tumor cells and promotes tumor cell escape from being killed
  by T-cell. Programmed death 1 (PD-1) expressed on T-lymphocytes can bind to PD-L1
  and inhibits T cell proliferation and activity. When anti-PD-L1 drugs antagonized
  PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 drugs antagonized PD-1, the anti-tumor immune function of T cells
  recovered.
