caption: The NGF pathway and its dysregulation in Alzheimer’s and Down syndrome pathology.
  In the healthy brain (left), upon neuronal stimulation, proNGF is secreted into
  the synaptic cleft along with the zymogens and convertases involved in its maturation
  and degradation. proNGF is converted to mNGF by plasmin, itself produced from the
  cleavage of plasminogen by tPA, under the control of neuroserpin. mNGF then dimerizes
  and binds to p75/TrkA receptor complexes on presynaptic terminals of BFCNs, to be
  internalized and retrogradely transported to their neuronal soma in the basal forebrain
  to fulfill its trophic functions. These include the control of the expression of
  housekeeping proteins, transcription factors, ribosomal proteins, and cytoskeletal
  proteins responsible for axonal transport. Receptor-unbound mNGF is rapidly degraded
  by metalloproteinases, produced under the control of TIMP-1. In the brain of individuals
  with Alzheimer’s pathology (right), including those with Down syndrome, increased
  neuroserpin and decreased tPA limit the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin.
  As plasmin is responsible for the maturation of proNGF to mNGF, this results in
  a build-up of proNGF. In parallel, increased MMP-9 and MMP-3 and decreased TIMP-1,
  their natural inhibitor, resulted in the excessive degradation of free, receptor-unbound
  mNGF. This two-pronged attack on the NGF metabolic cascade, driven by AD pathology,
  leads to a substantial decrease in mNGF bioavailability, and thus a substantial
  decrease in the trophic support of BFCNs, leading to their atrophy. Arrows indicate
  the direction of the alterations for each important member of the NGF pathway. Red
  represents a reduction in the protein levels and green an elevation.
