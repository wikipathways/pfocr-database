caption: Role of Fbln7 and its C-terminal fragment in the modulation of cellular functions
  under physiological and pathological conditions. a Under physiological conditions,
  the Fbln7 protein plays an essential role in the modulation of blood vessel formation,
  development, cell adhesion in multiple tissues such as placenta, eye, and cartilages.
  b One of the C-terminal fragment of Fbln7, Fbln7-C binds to immune cells such as
  monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils via integrin β1 and regulate their migration
  and functions via binding to surface integrins and modulation of ERK1/2 and MAPK
  signaling pathway. Similarly, in tumor microenvironment interaction of cell surface
  integrin expressed on cancer cells, endothelium or TAMs inhibits the angiogenesis
  and progression of cancers via modulation of STAT and ERK pathways. Binding to VEGFR2
  sustained activation of Rac1, and inhibition of VEGFR2 and ERK1/2 are possible mechanisms
  involved in the suppression of angiogenesis. Additionally, overexpression of Fbln7
  also results in its binding to Ang1, thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation of Tie2
  expressed in the endothelial cells
