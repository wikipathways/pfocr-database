caption: The SMAD and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways
  are the main known regulators of transcription of the gene encoding hepcidin (HAMP)
  in response to iron-related and inflammatory signals. The SMAD pathway is activated
  by the interaction of bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) and other BMPs with a
  heterodimeric BMP receptor (BMPR) containing type 1 and type 2 subunits. Haemojuvelin
  (HJV) is an iron pathway-specific ligand of the BMPR and BMPs that increases BMPR
  signalling. Transmembrane protease serine 6 (TMPRSS6) is a negative regulator of
  iron-related BMPR signalling and acts by cleaving HJV. Neogenin may facilitate the
  interaction of HJV with TMPRSS6 and also perhaps with other components of the BMPR
  complex. The concentration of extracellular iron–transferrin is sensed by transferrin
  receptor 1 (TFR1) and TFR2 assisted by HFE, and HFE and TFR2 convey a stimulatory
  signal to the BMPR complex through interactions that have not yet been characterized.
  The BMPR phosphorylates regulatory SMADs (R-SMADs), which complex with SMAD4 to
  enter the nucleus and stimulate the transcription of HAMP. Inflammation increases
  HAMP transcription through increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), activin B and
  other cytokines. IL-6 binds to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and signals through Janus
  kinase 1 (JAK1)-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 and the binding of phosphorylated
  STAT3 to cognate motifs in the HAMP promoter. Activin B probably signals through
  the BMPR pathway. ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase.
