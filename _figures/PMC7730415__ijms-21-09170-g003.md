caption: Schematic depiction of the possible role of HGF/c-MET pathway in pancreatic
  cancer. HGF secreted by PSCs in a precursor form is activated by proteolytic cleavage,
  mediated by proteases such as urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). Upon binding
  of HGF to its receptor c-MET, downstream intracellular signalling cascades are activated
  which regulate cancer cell functions that influence tumour progression. This binding
  also increases production of uPA by cancer cells that further activates HGF from
  PSCs, thus forming a feed-forward loop. Adapted from Pothula et al. [].
