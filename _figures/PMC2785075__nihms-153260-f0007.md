caption: A) In normal conditions, SIRT1 and FXR are associated with promoters of FXR
  target genes, such as the SHP gene. When FXR is activated by agonists, p300 is recruited
  and SIRT1 is dissociated, which results in increased acetylation of histone H3 and
  subsequently transcriptional activation. At the same time, the process for limiting
  the stimulated activity is initiated by acetylation of FXR by p300, which impairs
  FXR interaction with RXRα and DNA binding, resulting in dissociation of FXR from
  the promoter. SIRT1 deacetylates FXR, which decreases FXR acetylation levels. The
  deacetylated FXR is either degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway or heterodimerizes
  with RXRα and re-binds to the target gene promoter with SIRT1, resulting in deacetylation
  of histones and low basal levels of gene expression. The activity of FXR is tightly
  balanced by the opposing actions of p300 and SIRT1 via FXR and histone acetylation.
  B) In contrast, in metabolic disease states, FXR acetylation levels are constitutively
  highly elevated, probably due to abnormally high p300 activity and low SIRT1 activity.
  Constitutively elevated acetylation of FXR inhibits FXR activity, at least in part,
  by inhibiting FXR interaction with RXRα and subsequently binding of FXR/RXR to the
  DNA. Deacetylation of the acetylated FXR may be required for its further activity
  in normal mice, but does not occur in the diseased mice because of low expression
  and activity of SIRT1.
