caption: 'Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks are recognized by the MRE11 complex,
  which catalyses the activation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) in conjunction
  with other proteins such as the tat-interactive protein 60 kDa (TIP60; also known
  as KAT5) acetyltransferase and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1),. ATM activation promotes
  cell-cycle checkpoint induction, influences DNA repair, and can activate apoptosis
  and senescence in certain cellular contexts. Depending on the cell-cycle phase and
  end-binding complexes or end modifications, breaks can be directed into two major
  repair pathways: homology-directed repair (HDR) or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ;
  also known as classical (C)-NHEJ). a | HDR requires the 5′–3′ resection of dsDNA
  to generate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)–dsDNA junctions. This is initiated by the
  MRE11 complex and CtBP-interacting protein (CtIP) and further bulk resection is
  carried out by exonuclease 1 (EXO1), BLM and DNA2 (,,–). 3′ ssDNA tails generated
  by resection are bound by replication protein A (RPA), which activates ATR via ATR-interacting
  protein (ATRIP) binding to influence the checkpoint response. RPA on these 3′ tails
  is exchanged for RAD51 to promote strand invasion, HDR repair and resolution of
  repair intermediates. b | Ends bound by the Ku70–Ku80 heterodimer can be repaired
  by NHEJ in conjunction with the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs),
  Artemis nuclease and DNA ligase 4, with the help of additional factors involved
  in end-modifications, gap filling and ligation. This NHEJ pathway is independent
  of the MRE11 complex. c | The MRE11 complex, in conjunction with CtIP, also regulates
  the poorly defined alternative NHEJ (A-NHEJ) pathway, which is characterized by
  large deletions and the frequent use of short microhomologies–,–. This pathway is
  resection-dependent and requires several enzymatic activities for resection, flap
  trimming, synthesis and ligation. CDK, cell division protein kinase; DSB, double-strand
  break.'
