caption: The role of GM-CSF in MS pathogenesis. In a GM-CSF dependent pathway, CD11b+CD62L+Ly6Chi
  monocytes are released and move toward the blood-brain barrier, which induces pro-inflammatory
  mediators and differentiation of central nervous system dendritic cells and macrophages.
  GM-CSF induces the expression of CCR2 on monocytes which bind to CCL-2, resulting
  in the migration of inflammatory cells across the BBB and into the CNS. Moreover,
  the proliferation and activation of microglia cells induced by GM-CSF are necessary
  for initiation of the disease. These cells secrete many mediators such as ROS, TNF-α,
  and Interleukin-1β. TNF-α influences BBB permeability, which leads to further destruction.
  Also, GM-CSF can boost the differentiation of M1-like macrophages and causes the
  production of higher levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF
  α, all of which cooperate in the destruction of the myelin sheath. GM-CSF-induced
  expansion of CD11c+MHC+CD11b+CCR2+ myeloid cells (MdCs) population is accompanied
  by migration of MdCs into the CNS. GM-CSF secreted by Th17 cells is the main cytokine
  contributing to encephalitogenicity. IL-23 secreted by Th17 cells is necessary for
  the production of GM-CSF, and this cytokine causes an increase in pro-inflammatory
  myeloid cells. In addition, exTh17 cells produce GM-CSF, IFN-γ, and IL 17 simultaneously
  and play an important role in neuroinflammation. CD8+ T cells can also produce GM-CSF,
  and IL-17-producing CD8+ T cells (Tc17 cells) are a known source of GM-CSF. ThG
  cells, a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells, produce only GM-CSF and play an important
  role in neuroinflammation. Additionally, GM-CSF–expressing B cells play a significant
  role in inducing a pro-inflammatory phenotype of myeloid cells and in initiating
  an inflammatory response by producing GM-CSF. MS, Multiple Sclerosis Disease; BBB,
  Blood Brain Barrier; ROS, Reactive oxygen species.
