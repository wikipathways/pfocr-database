caption: In the IFN-I innate immune pathway, viral RNA released in infected cells
  is recognized by RIG-I and MDA5 in the cytosol or TLRs in endosome, leading to activation
  and phosphorylation of both IRF3/7 by TBK1 or IKKε.IRF3/7 forms homo- or hetero-dimers
  and translocate into the nucleus to induce IFN-I expression. The DNA sensor cGAS
  in cytoplasm recognizes dsDNA and activates IFN- signaling. IFI16 is expressed in
  both cytoplasm and nucleus and activates innate immune responses. For retroviruses,
  SAMHD1 tetramers inhibit viral reverse transcription (RT) by hydrolyzing the intracellular
  dNTPs, blocking virus replication and preventing subsequent viral DNA-induced innate
  immune responses. For RNA viruses, SAMHD1 down-regulates RNA sensor-triggered innate
  immune response by interacting with IRF7 and decreasing IKKε- mediated phosphorylation
  of IRF7. IRF3 binds to the promoter of SAMHD1 and enhances SAMHD1 mRNA transcription
  and protein expression. The decreased provirus by SAMHD1 may induce less intensive
  innate immune response. The circled letter P of IRF3 and IRF7 indicates their phosphorylation.
