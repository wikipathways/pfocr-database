caption: Molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis. The figure shows the molecular mechanisms
  of ferroptosis, which can be simply divided into four categories. (A) The first
  one is regulated by the system Xc; (B) Then, the second molecular regulatory mechanism
  is mainly the GSH/GPX4 pathway, which is currently one of the most important antioxidant
  systems; (C) Third, the molecular mechanisms of iron metabolism, such as IREB2 and
  Prominin 2, are related to ferritin metabolism, and both Ferroportin and TFR1 such
  as ACSL4 and LPCAT3, regulatory pathways have an impact on iron transport; (D) The
  fourth category is the lipid metabolism-related pathway, such as ACSL4, LPCAT3,
  which have an impact on lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis.
