caption: Summary of yeast strain engineering underlying fermentative production of
  artemisinic acid and subsequent conversion to artemisinin. (A) Biosynthetic pathway
  engineered in yeast for production of amorphadiene, its oxidation to artemisinic
  acid, and subsequent chemical conversion to artemisinin. (B) A. annua enzymes expressed
  in yeast for oxidation of amorphadiene to artemisinic acid. MVA, mevalonate; FPP,
  farnesyl diphosphate; AaADH1, alcohol dehydrogenase; AaALDH1, aldehyde dehydrogenase.
