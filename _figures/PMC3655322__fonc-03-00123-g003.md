caption: Diagram showing some of the upstream elements of the proposed Hippo pathway.
  Melanocytes are strongly polarized and receive signals on the one hand from the
  epidermis through adherens junctions with keratinocytes, and on the other hand from
  the basement membrane through integrins. They also receive signals through receptor
  tyrosine kinases such as Axl and through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). All
  are likely to signal through kinases to Lats1/2; arrows indicate signaling events.
