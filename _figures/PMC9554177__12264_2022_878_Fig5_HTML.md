caption: RAGE and its role in CNS diseases. Schematic of RAGE signal transduction
  and its role in CNS diseases. The presence of RAGE has been detected in many nervous
  system disorders (1) RAGE on the surface of microglia acts as a receptor for the
  Ca2+-binding protein S100A8/A9 to activate NF-kB via the JNK/ERK pathway to enhance
  the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL-6, and IL-1β. Neuroinflammatory
  diseases of the CNS are characterized by the presence of inflammatory infiltrates
  in the brain and/or spinal cord parenchyma; simultaneously, the S100B-RAGE interaction
  may enhance the axonal demyelination in neuroinflammatory disorders such as ALS,
  Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, and depression. Not only
  microglia, but also astrocytes may produce excessive AGEs. (2) Evidence suggests
  that these astrocyte-secreted AGEs act in a paracrine manner to activate microglial
  RAGE. AGE-RAGE interaction may impact NF-kB via the JNK/ERK pathway and enhance
  the production of inflammatory cytokines resulting in demyelination. (3) HMGB1,
  another ligand of RAGE, may be involved in ROS sensing by huntingtin and its nuclear
  transport. (4) Moreover, RAGE plays a critical role in transport of the hormone
  oxytocin that is important for physiological behaviors like maternal bonding. Overall,
  RAGE may participate in a large number of neurodegenerative and mental health conditions.
