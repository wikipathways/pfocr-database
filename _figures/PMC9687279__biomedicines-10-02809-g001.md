caption: Cellular metabolism in different states of cell-mediated responses. Naive
  T cells utilize glucose and generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS). During the transition from naïve to effector cells, glucose
  transporter 1 (GLUT1) receptors are increased, followed by elevated glucose uptake.
  The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway assists in the increased
  glycolytic and lactate pathway activities to sustain cell proliferation, differentiation,
  and effector functions. Pyruvate, in the absence of glucose, enters the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle and mediates OXPHOS. These result in increased mitochondrial biogenesis
  and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which are important for interleukin-2
  (IL-2) production. In an exhausted T cell, glucose metabolism is decreased, as shown
  by the reduction of the GLUT1 receptor, glycolysis, OXPHOS, and ATP production.
  Excessive mTOR signaling in exhausted T cells results in terminal differentiation
  of T cells, depolarized mitochondrial membrane, and cell death. Accumulation of
  a high ROS level leads to oxidative stress and negatively impacts OXPHOS efficiency
  as well as other metabolisms that depend on ATP. In memory T cells, metabolism is
  shifted back to OXPHOS and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). IL-15 plays a role in enhancing
  the mitochondrial biogenesis and the carnitine palmitoyl transferase IA (CPT1A)
  enzyme to facilitate FAO. The supply of fatty acids (FA) for FAO is acquired from
  intrinsic lipolysis by lysosomal acid lipase (LAL).
