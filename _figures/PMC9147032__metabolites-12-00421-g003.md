caption: 'Main pathways targeted by NU at low doses: The main discriminating metabolites
  identified in urine and plasma are in white boxes. They show that tryptophan and
  nicotinate–nicotinamide metabolism (https://smpdb.ca; 2021) represent the main targets
  of acute NU exposure: (a) the kynurenine pathway leading to nicotinate–nicotinamide
  metabolism and NAD+ synthesis and (b) the serotonin pathway are both highlighted
  by the metabolomic analysis of urine and plasma samples collected at different times
  following the exposure of rats. The heat maps associated with each discriminating
  metabolite show both their relative levels change (green decrease and red increase)
  and the corresponding time for it was identified as the most discriminating (black
  if not significantly discriminating).'
