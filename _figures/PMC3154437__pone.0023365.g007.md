caption: The reduction of fatty acid oxidation and the induction of lipogenesis both
  contribute to the accumulation of lipids in the livers of n-3 PUFA-depleted mice.
  The reduced fatty acid degradation could result from the inhibition of the PPARα
  pathway. De novo lipogenesis is promoted through SREBP-1c activation. Data suggest
  that SREBP-1c activation could result from both increased hepatic 2-AG content and
  LXR activation. The lower n-3 PUFA content in hepatic phospholipids can lead to
  higher 2-AG production, which could therefore stimulate CB1 and then SREBP-1c expression.
  Both hepatic n-3 PUFA depletion and higher cholesterol content contribute to LXR
  activation. Increased SREBP-2 activation, occurring by an unknown mechanism, could
  play a role in the increased cholesterol synthesis observed in the n-3 PUFA-depleted
  livers.
