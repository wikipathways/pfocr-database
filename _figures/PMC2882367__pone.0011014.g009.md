caption: The first pathway is mediated by Kremen. In the presence of Kremen, LRP6
  antagonist Dkk1 serves as a bridge between LRP6 and Kremen and induces LRP6 internalization
  and degradation, terminating Wnt signaling. Furthermore, Kremen might directly bind
  to LRP6 and induce LRP6 degradation. The second pathway is mediated by Wnt/Frizzled.
  While Wnt binding to its receptors LRP6 and Frizzled (Fz) induces LRP6-Wnt-Fz complex
  formation, the endocytosis and Wnt/LRP6 signaling decay of this complex occur after
  Wnt signaling activation. Dkk1 blocks Wnt binding to LRP6 and then inhibits LRP6
  turnover mediated by Wnt/Fz.
