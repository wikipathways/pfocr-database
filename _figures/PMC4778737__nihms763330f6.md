caption: PE:PC ratio in liver disease. (A) MDR2 is a PC-specific flippase that mediates
  the secretion of PC into bile. (B) Depletion of PC levels by ablating its synthesis
  via the PEMT pathway leads to an increase in the PE:PC ratio in hepatocyte membranes
  due to both a decrease in its synthesis as well as continued secretion by MDR2.
  A decrease in the levels of PC relative to PE results in leaky hepatocyte membranes
  causing cell lysis and subsequent tissue damage. (C) CDP-ethanolamine pathway in
  hepatocytes. (D) Upon deletion of CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase in
  the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, the DAG that is normally used to generate CDP-ethanolamine
  accumulates and is instead consumed to form triglyceride (TG). Increased accumulation
  of triglycerides leads to the development of steatosis. EK, ethanolamine kinase.
