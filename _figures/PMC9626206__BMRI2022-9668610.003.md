caption: The different effect of nickel ions on oral mucosa/gingiva and skin. (a)
  Keratinocyte. (b) Fibroblast. (c) B cell. (d) Treg. (e) T cell. (f) APC. (g) KGF
  receptor. (h) ICAM-1. (i) TLR4. (j) MHC II. In oral mucosa/gingiva, intercellular
  adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) on keratinocyte is elevated by nickel, which facilitates
  lymphocyte adhesion and chronic inflammation. Nickel ions also increase keratinocyte's
  proliferation by autocrine pathway to cause gingival hyperplasia. An IL-1α/KGF/KGF
  receptor positive feedback loop is formed between keratinocyte and fibroblast to
  further stimulate proliferation. On the other hand, fibroblast is irritated to express
  anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 via TLR4, which dampens immune response. Another
  pathway of forming immune tolerance is dependent on B cell apoptosis, and nickel
  ions cause DNA strand breaks of B cell to induce splenic apoptosis. APCs capture
  the apoptotic bodies and cross-present their peptides to the regulatory T cells
  which is vital immune cells for systemic tolerance. In skin, keratinocyte suffering
  nickel exposure secretes higher levels of IL-1β and TNF-α which upregulate MHC II,
  E-cadherin, and chemokines in APCs. Those APCs present nickel by MHC II molecule
  to naïve T cells in lymph node to induce allergic contact dermatitis. Another two
  pathways of dermatitis include that nickel stimulates fibroblast to express HIF-1α,
  VEGF, and CCL20, and that nickel activates elTh1/Th17 and Th22 cells.
