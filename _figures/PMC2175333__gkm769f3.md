caption: Example models for presenting how to use the new notation. (A) Phosphorylation
  reactions at the domain level. The protein of Pro is expanded into the domains of
  A and B. 〈1〉 The virtual node indicates the state that Pro is phosphorylated on
  the B domain. 〈2〉 The virtual node indicates the state that Pro is phosphorylated
  on the A domain. 〈3〉 The real node of phosphorylated Pro (Pro-P) is produced. The
  InnerLink arrow (green) shows that the A domain is phosphorylated. 〈4〉 The real
  node of Pro-P-P is produced. The InnerLink arrow shows both the A and B domains
  are phosphorylated. 〈5〉 The real node of Pro-P is produced by dephosphorylation
  of Pro-P-P. The InnerLink arrow indicates the B domain is phosphorylated. (B) A
  phosphorus exchange reaction (Pro1 + Pro2-P -> Pro1-P + Pro2). 〈1〉 The virtual node
  indicates the state that Pro1 is phosphorylated. 〈2〉 The real node of Pro2-P is
  produced. 〈3〉 The InnerLink arrow indicates that the real node is Pro1-P. (C) Synthesis
  of the protein complex of Pro1:Pro2:Pro3. 〈1〉 The virtual node indicates the state
  that the B domain of Pro1 is bound to the E domain of Pro2. 〈2〉 The virtual node
  indicates the state that the D domain of Pro2 is bound to the F domain of Pro3.
  〈3〉 The real node of Pro1:Pro2 is produced. The InnerLink arrow indicates that the
  B domain of Pro1 is bound to the E domain of Pro2. 〈4〉 The real node of Pro1:Pro2:Pro3
  is produced. The InnerLinik arrow indicates that the D domain of Pro2 is bound to
  the F domain of Pro3.
