caption: Pathways for NAD biosynthesis in yeast cell. NAD is synthesis through three
  basic pathways a tryptophan de novo synthesis, b NA/NAM salvage pathways and c NR-mediated
  synthesis. In tryptophan de novo synthesis, biosynthesis of nicotinic acid proteins
  (Bna 2, 7, 4, 5, 1) participate in the spontaneous cyclization leading to the formation
  of QA and subsequently NaMN by biosynthesis of nicotinic acid 6. On sufficient abundance
  of NAD, this pathway ostensibly remains inactivated. In the NA/NAM salvage pathway,
  NaMN is also produced upon conversion of NA; this leads to the formation of NaAD,
  which metabolizes to NAD using Nma1, Nma2 and Qns1, respectively. The NR-mediated
  NAD biosynthesis converts NR to NMN by Nrk1, which helps to synthesize NAD using
  Nma1, Nma2 and Pof1. In other words, NR are assimilated through the Nrk1-dependent
  and Urh1/Pnp1-mediated routes responsible for the utilization of exogenous NR generated
  from NMN by the nucleotidase activities of Isn1 and Sdt1 in the cytosol. The thick
  dark arrow illustrates exogenous uptake of NA from yeast growth media. Light purple
  arrow shows transporters of QA and NA using the Tna1 transporter and that of NR
  by Nrt11. The light red arrows represent some of the poorly understood mechanisms
  involving the leakage of molecules into the extracellular space. The left panel
  demonstrates the initialization of de no synthesis from tryptophan, the middle is
  the NA/NAM salvage pathways while the left panel illustrates NAD synthesis through
  NR salvage pathways. These panels are also demarcated by broken lines. White background
  shows the intracellular space while the pink shaded part stands for the extracellular
  space
