caption: AMPK, HIF-1, and Myc serve as the master regulators of cancer metabolism
  and regulate both catabolic processes (glycolysis, glucose oxidation, glutamine
  oxidation, and fatty acid oxidation) and anabolic processes. The intracellular glucose
  can be used for glycolysis, glucose oxidation, and anabolic processes. The intracellular
  fatty acids can be used for oxidation and anabolic processes. The intracellular
  glutamine can be metabolized via glutamine oxidation, synthesis of glutathione (GSH),
  or reductive carboxylation. The metabolites generated in the metabolic pathways,
  mtROS, noxROS acetyl-CoA, and ATP, can in turn regulate AMPK and HIF-1. The black
  arrows/bar-headed arrows represent excitatory/inhibitory regulatory links. The purple
  dotted lines represent metabolic pathways. The magenta arrows represent the distribution
  of glucose, fatty acid, and glutamine into different metabolic pathways. The magenta
  dashed lines represent fatty acid biosynthesis from glucose or glutamine
