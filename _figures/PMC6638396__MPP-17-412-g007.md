caption: Proposed model of lipid transfer protein 3 (LTP3) modulation of abscisic
  acid (ABA) in the Arabidopsis–P seudomonas syringae pv. tomato interaction. Pathogen‐associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) induce PAMP‐triggered immunity (PTI) in the plant; specific
  avirulent effectors are recognized by immune receptors (R proteins) to induce effector‐triggered
  immunity (ETI). Salicylic acid (SA) plays an important role in the activation of
  plant general defence; pathogen‐modulated ABA signalling antagonizes SA‐mediated
  defences. LTP3 might be targeted by virulent effectors to promote ABA biosynthesis
  through AAO3, and thus down‐regulate the SA pathway. A positive regulatory loop
  exists between ABA and LTP3. LTP3 also negatively modulates SA through an ABA‐independent
  way.
