caption: The domain specific functions of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) in pulmonary
  microvascular endothelial cell (PMVEC) integrity and repair. CA IX is critical to
  PMVEC repair, but the specific function of each CA IX domain is unknown. CA IX is
  composed of four domains known as the proteoglycan-like domain (PG), catalytic domain
  (CA), transmembrane domain (TM), and the intracellular domain (IC). The PG domain
  mediates intracellular pH homeostasis, cell migration, and network formation. The
  CA and IC domains promote the PI3k/Akt signaling pathway, but negatively regulate
  aerobic glycolysis. In addition, the IC domain inhibits network formation while
  supporting cell migration. Acidosis suppresses aerobic glycolysis and migration
  independent of intracellular pH homeostasis.
