caption: 'Position-dependent regulation of cell fate in the preimplantation embryo:
  known and hypothetical mechanisms. Regulation of the Hippo pathway is central to
  the first cell fate decision. In inside cells, a junctional complex comprised of
  NF2 and AMOT phosphorylated at S176 activates the Hippo pathway. This leads in turn
  to the phosphorylation of YAP and TAZ and their exclusion from nuclei, rendering
  them transcriptionally inactive. In outside cells, apicobasal polarity leads to
  the sequestration of AMOT dephosphorylated at S176 to the apical domain, resulting
  in the inactivation of the Hippo pathway. Unphosphorylated YAP is therefore able
  to go to the nucleus where it can bind to TEAD4 to activate CDX2 transcription and
  drive TE fate. Other factors, such as mechanical forces, GPCR and PCP signalling
  may act as cell shape and position sensors and lead to the activation of YAP and
  TAZ in outside cells principally via modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Notch
  signalling, activated in outside cells only via an unknown mechanism, contributes
  to the transcription of Cdx2 to establish TE fate. TJ: tight junctions. Actin filaments
  are represented in red. The apical domain of TE cells is outlined in purple and
  cell–cell junctions are delineated in blue.'
