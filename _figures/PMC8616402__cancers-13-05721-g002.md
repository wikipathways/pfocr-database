caption: SARS-CoV-2 infects enterocytes through ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2 expressed
  on their surface. The release of the viral genome and production of viral proteins
  (simplified in this schema) will lead to the interaction of various SARS-CoV-2 antigens
  with the host cell autophagy machinery. Overall, this will induce the blockage of
  the autophagic flux. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species, damaged cellular
  proteins and organelles, and acquired genetic defects due to various stressors can
  lead to the development of malignancies. Furthermore, infection can also interfere
  with the cellular MHC-I antigen-presentation pathway, blunting the ability of host
  cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to recognize potential oncogenic antigens.
