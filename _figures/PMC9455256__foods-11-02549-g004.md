  plantarum lowering glucose level through gut microbiota, which can regulate the
  expression of Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and Glucose-6-phosphatase
  (G6Pase), as well the Adenosine 5‘-monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK)/protein
  kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway, meanwhile reducing the level of transporter SGLT2,
  GLUT5, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and fasting glucose. Immune cell function is
  regarded as a possible mechanism but still needs further study. (“+” means upregulation,
