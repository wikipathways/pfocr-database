caption: Relationship between MetS and skin diseases. MetS is associated with various
  skin diseases through multiple pathways. These pathways include oxidative stress
  leading to DNA and protein damage, IR contributing to hyperinsulinemia, lipid metabolism
  abnormalities affecting steroid synthesis, chronic inflammation mediated by cytokines,
  including TNF-α and IL-1, and genetic factors influencing susceptibility to conditions
  such as psoriasis and vitiligo. The interconnected mechanisms highlight the complexity
  of managing skin diseases in patients with MetS
