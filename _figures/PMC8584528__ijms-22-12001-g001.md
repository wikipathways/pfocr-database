caption: 'Mammalian UPR pathway: Upon ER stress, BiP dissociates from the ER membrane
  sensors IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, allowing activation of their downstream signalling
  cascades, including the unfolded protein response (UPR). (a) IRE1 dimerisation and
  autophosphorylation result in activation of an endoribonuclease activity that removes
  an intron in the mRNA encoding XBP1 transcription factor (TF). This reaction is
  essential for the translation of the active XBP1s TF, which induces UPR (i.e., chaperones)
  and non-UPR (ERAD) target genes. (b) PERK phosphorylates eIF2α (p-eIF2α), leading
  to decreased protein synthesis (translation attenuation). Paradoxically, lower levels
  of eIF2α promote translation of ATF4, a selective TF that drives expression of UPR
  target genes (e.g., CHOP). (c) ATF6 translocates from the ER to the Golgi apparatus,
  where it undergoes cleavage and results in the release of the active p50 fragment
  in the cytosol. The p50 translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to and activates
  the ERSE consensus sequence CCAAT-N9-CCACG found in the promoter of several UPR-target
  genes, including BiP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein
  (CHOP), and XBP1.'
