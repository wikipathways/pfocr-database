caption: Cellular unfolded protein response mechanisms. The accumulation of misfolded
  proteins activates organelle-specific complex mechanisms that modulate gene expression
  in an attempt to restore proteostasis. Upon accumulation of misfolded proteins within
  the cytosol, heat-shock factor 1 (HSF-1) trimerizes, enters the nucleus, and activates
  the expression of various genes, including the subset of chaperones of the heat-shock
  protein group. Protein misfolding in the mitochondria activates the mitochondrial
  unfolded protein response (UPRmt), which activates the expression of genes that
  encode for mitochondrial chaperones. This expression is promoted by transcription
  factors such as CHOP. Similarly, at least three signaling cascades can respond to
  the accrual of unfolded proteins within the ER. The ER unfolded protein response
  (UPRER) mechanisms are based on the sensing of folding stress membrane proteins
  (ATF, IRE1, and PERK), the migration of transcription factors into the nucleus (such
  as ATF6[N] and XBP1), and the induction of chaperone-encoding genes. Lysosomes also
  signal to activate gene expression in the nucleus of Caenorhabditis elegans. The
  lysosomal acid lipase LIPL-4 signals to confer the nuclear localization of the lipid
  chaperone LBP-8, which induces gene expression. This pathway was shown to promote
  longevity; however, its possible roles in the maintenance of protein quality control
  are yet to be explored.
