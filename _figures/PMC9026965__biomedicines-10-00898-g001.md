caption: 'Chronic hypoxemia contributes to inflammation, which generates mitochondrial
  dysfunction, impairments in mitochondrial turnover, and oxidant–antioxidant imbalance.
  Reduced respiration causes insufficient oxygenation and mitochondrial dysfunction,
  which in turn leads to alteration of mitochondrial OXPHOS and increases ROS levels.
  A disproportionate stimulation of fission induces mitochondrial dysfunction. Reduction
  in the mitochondrial fusion factor OPA1 impairs the mitochondrial network and promotes
  apoptosis. Blockade of fission Fis1 or Drp1 inhibits mitochondrial fragmentation.
  Oxidative stress triggers the TGF-β signaling pathway, which induces inhibitory
  effect on Nrf2, which in turn inhibits endogenous antioxidants. Oxidative stress
  induces cellular senescence via FOXO transcription factors and decreases SIRT-1
  expression and enzyme activity; ROS activate the PI3K-mTOR pathway. Vitamin D supplementation
  prevents the mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress by setting MFN1/2, OPA1,
  and Drp1 expression. Oxidative stress activates NF-κB and FOXO pathways which influences
  muscle wasting in COPD patients. Vitamin D and VDR represses NF-κB and modulates
  the post-translational modification and function of FoxO proteins. The beneficial
  effects of SIRT-1 on mitochondrial function are regulated by vitamin D, which acts
  by increasing SIRT-1 formation. Abbreviations: CPR = C-reactive protein; Drp1 =
  dynamin-related protein 1; 1,25(OH)2D3 = 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; Fis1 = fission
  protein 1; FOXO = forkhead box O; IL-6 = interleukin-6; MFN1/2 = mitofusin-1/2;
  mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin; MuRF1 = muscle-specific RING finger protein
