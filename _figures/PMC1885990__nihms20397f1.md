caption: Scheme depicting a molecular pathway by which cell-cycle-related molecules
  promote cell death in neurons in development and disease. A. Survival conditions.
  Under conditions of neuron survival, p130 forms complexes with E2F4 on the promoters
  of genes including those encoding B- and C-Myb. p130 tethers chromatin-modifying
  proteins such as Suv39H1 and HDAC1 to the promoter and represses their transcription.
  Cdk4 is inactive and consequently p130 is hypo-phosphorylated and binds tightly
  to E2F4. B. Apoptotic conditions. Under apoptotic conditions, Cdk4 associates with
  Cyclin D and is active. This leads to hyper-phosphorylation of p130 which in turn
  causes it and its bound chromatin modifiers to dissociate from E2F4 and from promoters
  of genes including B- and C-Myb. This results in gene de-repression and elevation
  of cellular levels of B- and C-Myb. The Mybs bind to the promoter of the gene encoding
  the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bim. The levels of intracellular Bim rise and
  it engages the core cell death machinery, promoting caspase activation and apoptosis.
