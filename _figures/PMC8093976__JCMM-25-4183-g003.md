caption: Regulatory roles of PLXND1 in cardiac development. PLXND1 is involved in
  the angiogenesis of the cardiogenesis; SEMA3C‐PLXND1/NRP1 signalling attracts neural
  crest cells (NCCs) to the cardiac outflow tract and plays a role in truncus arteriosus
  septation; SEMA3E‐PLXND1 signalling plays a critical role in ventricular chamber
  development by modulating extracellular cell matrix (ECM) dynamics and the Notch
  signalling pathway in ECs
