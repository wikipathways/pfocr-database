caption: Schematic diagram of a bilateral model of the VOR derived from behavioral
  data obtained in squirrel monkeys and macaques. During simulations of a unilateral
  labyrinthectomy the input from the lesioned side is removed. A tonic pathway (represented
  by a transfer function that resembles regular afferent dynamics, Tr = 6.5 × 10−3
  s) and a phasic pathway (represented by a transfer function that resembles irregular
  afferent dynamics, Ti = 0.05 s) transduce head velocity. A cutoff block in the phasic
  pathway represents the inhibitory cutoff that occurs for neuronal elements in this
  pathway (irregular afferents are highly susceptible to inhibitory cutoff). Both
  pathways have separate gain elements GT and GP. GP is nonlinear (represented by
  a cubic term) in squirrel monkeys but is linear in macaques. The values of these
  gain elements increase after a unilateral labyrinthectomy in order to represent
  the increase in gain due to compensation. However, GP (x2.5) is more modifiable
  than GT (x1.6). In addition, a first-order band-pass filter, represented by a single
  pole (TP) and a single zero (TZ), is added to the tonic pathway (not shown in the
  figure). This low-pass filter accounts for the observation that low frequency responses
  adapt better than high frequency responses in this pathway []. Similar changes in
  these pathways occur in response to adaptation to magnifying spectacles [] and in
  response to vergence-induced changes in the VOR [].
