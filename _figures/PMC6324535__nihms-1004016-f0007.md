caption: Working model. CREPT is highly expressed in tumors and functions to promote
  tumorigenesis. miR-383 targets the 3′UTR of CREPT mRNA to un-stabilize it thereafter
  to inhibit the activity of CREPT. As CREPT interacts with both β-catenin and TCF4
  to enhance the association of β-catenin with TCF4, in response to Wnt signaling
  for the expression of targeted mRNA, cylinD1, CDK4, and CDK6, miR383 also inhibit
  these gene expression. We proposed that miR-383 could act as a tumor suppressive
  microRNA, in part by negatively regulating CREPT expression and subsequently Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway
