caption: The α-ketoacid pathway (inner green arrows) resembles transformations within
  the r-TCA (black) and glyoxylate (purple) cycles. Starting from pyruvate (I) or
  oxaloacetate (VIII), under mild aqueous conditions, the α-ketoacid pathway requires
  only the addition of glyoxylate (II), acting as both the carbon source and reductant,
  to progress through a series of α-ketoacid analogs of metabolic carboxylate intermediates.
  The glyoxylate cycle in modern biology similarly uses acetyl-CoA (in place of pyruvate)
  and glyoxylate as building blocks. Although likely a later evolutionary invention,
  intermediates of the α-ketoacid pathway can be transformed into their respective
  TCA cycle intermediates via oxidative decarboxylation in the presence of an appropriate
  oxidant (peach arrows).
