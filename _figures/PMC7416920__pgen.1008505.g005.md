caption: A schematic describing the current model for the sensory transduction pathway
  in the ASJ neurons resulting in fast neuronal gene transcription in response to
  P. aeruginosa metabolite phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN). The model highlights the
  role of canonical signal transduction pathway molecules as well the added role of
  the cGMP-dependent kinase EGL-4 as one of the two parallel pathways required for
  the induction of daf-7. Note that the activation of both pathways are required for
  the full induction of daf-7.
