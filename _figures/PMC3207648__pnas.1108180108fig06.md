caption: The proposed signaling pathway to preterm birth. Uterine deletion of p53
  in mice results in increased PI3K-Akt signaling, which suppresses TSC activity by
  phosphorylating TSC2. Thus, TSC's inhibition on mTORC1 signaling is released, reflecting
  higher levels of pS6, as well as p21 levels. These changes give rise to heightened
  cellular senescence associated with increased PGF2α generation via the COX2-PGFS
  pathway, driving preterm birth.
