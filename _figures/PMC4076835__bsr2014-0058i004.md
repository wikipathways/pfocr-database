caption: During ER stress, misfolded proteins arising in the ER is assisted with chaperones
  for refolding, and failure to be refolded to their native state would result in
  their degradation via the ERAD pathway. The UPR is activated with the accumulation
  of unfolded or misfolded proteins, which would then halt protein translation and
  induce stress-response genes. Under prolonged ER stress, apoptosis is initiated
  by the UPR. Diseased states often arise from the failure of the UPR to respond well
  under ER stress, or from an accumulation of unfolded proteins. Inadequate response
  of the UPR could result when elements in the UPR signalling cascade is down-regulated
  and hence, a sufficient response could not be mounted to alleviate ER stress. Diseases
  such as NAFLD, T2D (type II diabetes) and cancer are implicated in this model. Mutations
  in protein coding genes could cause proteins synthesized to be misfolded and form
  aggregates rapidly. This could be severe that the ERAD fails to degrade the proteins
  adequately and the UPR is unable to compensate for the ER stress. This model often
  includes degenerative diseases such as PD, HD and AD.
