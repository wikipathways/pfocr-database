caption: 'The vitamin K cycle. Vitamin K acts as a coenzyme. The enzyme involved in
  this reaction is Gamma-Glutamyl-CarboXylase (GGCX) (a). The catalyzed reaction is
  the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues (Glu) which are transformed into gamma-carboxyglutamic
  acid (Gla). Warfarin acts as a vitamin K antagonist by blocking two important reactions:
  vitamin K quinone reductase (b1) and Vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) (b2), resulting
  in a consequent functional vitamin K deficiency. NADPH dependent quinone reductase
  (c) is relatively insensitive to the inhibiting action of warfarin and represent
  an escape pathway for the transformation of vitamin K quinone into vitamin K hydroquinone.
