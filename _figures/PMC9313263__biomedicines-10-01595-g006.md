caption: EGF-mediated signal transduction involving the oxytocin receptor in promoting
  metastasis. Normal OT/OTR signalling via Gq or Gs was compromised in MDA-MB-231
  cells. Involvement of the V1aR/V1bR-mediated Gqpathway and V2R-mediated Gspathway
  were excluded. In OTR-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells, EGF induced ERK1/2-RSK activation
  via both EGFR and OTR. The mTOR pathway was also involved in EGF-stimulated rpS6
  activation, independent of ERK1/2 activation.
