caption: Drosophila NF-κB pathway, a simplified schematic representation. The Imd
  and Toll pathways are shown on the left and right, respectively. Upon infection
  with Gram-negative bacteria, the Imd pathway is activated through direct recognition
  of Gram-negative bacterial PGN by PGRP-LC at the cell surface. This creates a transient
  signaling platform resulting also in the transcription activation of genes encoding
  AMPs. 1, 2, and 3 indicate successive stages of the Imd pathway activation. In response
  to both Gram-positive cocci and fungi, Spz (Spatzle) is processed into a biologically
  active ligand and binds to the Toll receptor. This interaction initiates a proteolytic
  cascade that results in the transcription activation of genes encoding AMPs. AP-1,
