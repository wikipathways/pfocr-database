caption: Model based on studies of the activation of JNK pathway upon generation of
  H2O2 in rat alveolar macrophages () and in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE1)
  exposed to HNE (). Several stimuli are able to induce the assembly of the membrane
  NADPH oxidase (NOX2) in macrphages resulting in the generation of extracellular
  superoxide that dismutes to H2O2. ASK1, in its inactive form, is bound to the reduced
  Trx. Oxidation of the bound Trx to the disulfide form by H2O2, which is catalyzed
  by a peroxiredoxin, causes dissociation of Trx from ASK1. ASK1 then can undergo
  dimerization and auto-phosphorylation that initiates the sequential phosphorylation
  of MKK4, JNK and cJun. Phospho- cJun, as part of the AP-1 transcription factor complex,
  can then bind to the TRE cis element resulting in the transcription of several genes.HNE
  generated from the peroxidation of ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids under physiologic
  or pathologic conditions, can react with SHP-1 leading to its inactivation and degradation.
  As a consequence, the inhibitory effect of SHP-1 on an unknown protein upstream
  of MKK4 (currently under investigation), is released allowing the signal to be transmitted
  along the same pathway as above.
