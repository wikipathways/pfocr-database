caption: 'Regulation of cardiac remodeling by microRNAs and the functions of their
  target mRNAs. MAPK/ERK pathway plays a crucial impact on signal transduction for
  myosin growth. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation, metabolism,
  survival, and angiogenesis and controls the development and transformation of left
  ventricular hypertrophy. The ERK signaling pathway, a member of the MAPK family,
  comprises a cascade of a series of successively acting kinases. (a) The role of
  miR-21 in cardiac remodeling. Regulation of ERK is mediated by miR-21 via inhibiting
  PTEN and SMAD7 gene expression. (b) The role of miR-133 in cardiac remodeling. MicroRNA-133
  plays a role in determining cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by targeting PP2AC. Abbreviations:
  miR, microRNA; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; NF-κB,
  nuclear factor-κB; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PP2AC, protein phosphatase 2A; Raf-1,
  Raf-1 proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase.'
