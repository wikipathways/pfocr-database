caption: 'The autophagic process and some of its major regulators. The phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is triggered by the binding of insulin or growth factors
  to the insulin receptor, activating PI3K. Activated PI3K converts PIP2 to PIP3 which
  then recruits PDK1 and Akt to the plasma membrane. Activated Akt then phosphorylates
  and inactivates TSC 1/2, leading to the activation of Rheb and mammalian target
  of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 suppresses
  autophagy by phosphorylating and inhibiting the ULK1 complex. Under starvation conditions
  or rapamycin treatment, mTOR dissociates from the ULK1 complex and autophagy gets
  activated. ULK1 is also directly phosphorylated and activated by the AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) in response to energy restriction. The autophagic process
  involves the degradation of cytosolic proteins and organelles in the lysosomes via
  autophagosomal delivery. Two complexes regulate the formation of the phagophore,
  the ULK1 complex and the beclin 1-VPS34 (class III PI3K) complex. The elongation
  of the autophagosomal membrane is mediated by two ubiquitin-like protein conjugation
  systems: ATG12-ATG5 and ATG8/LC3. LC3 can additionally recruit adaptor proteins
  such as p62 to autophagosomes mediating selective autophagy of cellular structures,
  protein aggregates and microorganisms. LC3II (LC3 bound to phosphatidylethanolamine)
  is recruited to both the inner and outer autophagosomal membrane. Autophagosomes
  fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes where they are degraded together with
  their luminal content. Pharmacological modulators of autophagy are labeled according
  to their effect on autophagy. Red: Inhibits autophagy; Green: Induces autophagy.'
