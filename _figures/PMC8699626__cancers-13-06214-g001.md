caption: The Hippo pathway in Drosophila and Mammals. (A) The Drosophila Hippo pathway.
  The core kinase cascade of the Drosophila Hippo pathway consists of Hpo, Sav, Wts,
  Mats, and Yki. When the Hippo pathway is activated, Yki is phosphorylated and sequestered
  in the cytoplasm. Otherwise, Yki localizes to the nucleus and binds Sd to stimulate
  gene transcription. Many elements are involved in the direct interaction with the
  core components to regulate the Drosophila Hippo pathway, including Tao, dRASSF,
  Kibra–Ex–Mer complex, Hppy/Msn, dJub, Zyx, and Fry–Trc complex. (B) The mammalian
  Hippo pathway. The core of the mammalian Hippo pathway is comprised of MST1/2, SAV1,
  LATS1/2, MOB1, and YAP/TAZ. When the mammalian Hippo pathway is on, YAP/TAZ are
  phosphorylated and are either retained in the cytosol or targeted for degradation.
  When the mammalian Hippo pathway is off, YAP/TAZ translocate to the nucleus to activate
  TEAD for gene transcription. The extended elements in the mammalian Hippo pathway
  include TAOKs, RASSF1A, KIBRA–FRMD–NF2 complex, MAP4Ks, Ajuba, Zyxin, and Furry-NDR1/2
  complex.
