caption: Dietary choline is converted to phosphocholine by the actions of choline
  kinase (CHK), and then reacted with cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to form cytidine
  diphosphocholine (CDP-choline). Choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase (CEPT) catalyzes
  the final step in PC biosynthesis by reacting sn-1,2-diacylglycerols (DAGs) with
  CDP-choline to form PCs. The second major pathway for PC biosynthesis involves three
  sequential methylation reactions of phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) with S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM) by the actions of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT). The
  acyl distribution and composition of fatty acids (FAs) within each PC is continually
  modified by the actions of multiple phospholipases (primarily A1 and A2 isoforms)
  and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferases (LPCAT1-4). The PCs synthesized by
  either pathway are readily converted into TAG.
