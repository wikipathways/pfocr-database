caption: Mechanism of resistance and SCC development. BRAFV600E inhibition via vemurafenib
  induces paradoxical activation of MAPK through increased CRAF activity and acquired
  NRAS mutation. In addition, increased PDGFRb expression with subsequent activation
  of PI3K/AKT pathway for increased resistance. It is hypothesized that these reported
  mechanisms are shared in drug resistance as well as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
  development.
