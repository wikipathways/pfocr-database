caption: . Immunomodulation of macrophages through miRs. A schematic diagram represents
  different miRs and their target genes, which allows M. tuberculosis to mitigate
  the immune response through modulation of TLR and IFN-γ pathway. The ligation of
  mycobacterial ligands to TLRs leads to the interaction of MyD88 with IRAK4 and IRAK1.
  IRAK4 auto-phosphorylates and activates IRAK1. This promotes the activation of TRAF6,
  which further activates TAK1. TAK1 gives rise to canonical IKK complex by phosphorylating
  IKKα and IKKβ, which phosphorylates components of the transcription factor NF-κB
  such as IκBα, p50, and p65. TAK1-mediated activation of NF-κB transcription factors
  drives the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 and TNF-α. In
  another pathway, IFN-γ acts as a principal mediator of macrophage activation, which
  modulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production and induces production of anti-inflammatory
  molecules. Upon ligand binding, oligomerization and transphosphorylation of IFN-γ
  receptors (IFNR1 and IFNR2) activate JAK1 and JAK2, which creates a docking site
  for STAT1. STAT1 homodimerizes upon phosphorylation (P) in an antiparallel configuration,
  forming a complex γ-activated factor, which translocates to the nucleus and binds
  to the γ-activated site, located at the promoters of primary response genes, increasing
  their transcription, like IL-1Ra and IL-18BP. SOCS proteins negatively regulate
  the IFN-γ pathway by inhibiting JAKs and STAT1 phosphorylation.
