caption: Schematic model of gene regulation by auxin, CK, ABA, and sucrose during
  bulbil growth. The localized auxin in the bulbil is transiently produced by stimulation
  of auxin synthesis (TAR3 and YUCCA1), and activates bulbil initiation. Further,
  the excess auxin is depleted and transported to maintain bulbil outgrowth by up-regulation
  of auxin-conjugated genes (GH3.5 and GH3.6) and auxin efflux proteins (PIN1B, LAX2,
  and the ABC transporter B family). CKs promote its growth through rapid activation
  of the CK transporter (ENT3) gene, together with suppression of CK degradative genes
  (CKX1/3/9/11). ABA contributes to bulbil growth through repression of ABA synthesis
  genes (NECDs and ZEPs) at the early stage of bulbil formation. Sucrose probably
  acts as a signal, and promotes bulbil growth through up-regulation of genes involved
  in the T6P pathway (TPS1 and TPS5). The integration of these hormones and sucrose
  provides a forward signaling to activate genes associated with cell division, proliferation,
  and expansion, which contributes key roles in maintaining cell enlargement during
  bulbil growth.
