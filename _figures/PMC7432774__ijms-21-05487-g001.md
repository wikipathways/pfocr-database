caption: 'Schematic representation of the biology of tumor hypoxia. (A) The severe
  structural and functional abnormality of the tumor vasculature and the increase
  in diffusion distances between tumor cells and blood vessels (100–200 µm) lead to
  intratumoral hypoxia (oxygen tension 0.02–35 mmHg). (B) HIF-1α is the molecular
  determinant that is upregulated in the adaptive responses to alterations in tissue
  oxygenation. Moreover, tumor hypoxia induces adaptive responses through enhancing
  unfolded protein response (UPR)-mediated upregulation of ATF6, XBP1, and ATF4 and
  inactivating the mTOR pathway. Abbreviations: ATF, activating transcription factor;
  HIFs, hypoxia-inducible factors; IRE1, inositol-requiring protein 1; mmHg, millimeter
  of mercury; mTOR, kinase mammalian target of rapamycin; O2, oxygen; PERK, protein
  kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase; XBP1, X-box binding protein.'
