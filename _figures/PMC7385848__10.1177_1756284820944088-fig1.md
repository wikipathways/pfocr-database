caption: Bile acid metabolism pathway.Two major pathways are involved in bile acid
  synthesis. The classic pathway is controlled by CYP7A1 in the endoplasmic reticulum.
  CYP8B1 is required to synthesize cholic acid and CYP27A1 is able to form chenodeoxycholic
  acid. Patients with loss of bile acids, as in ileal disease or resection, develop
  compensatory increases in the synthesis of bile acids precursors, specifically the
  intermediate in the classical synthetic pathway, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4).AKR1C4,
  aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C4; AKR1D1, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member
  D1; CYP7A1, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1; CYP8B1, cytochrome P450
  family 8 subfamily B member 1; CYP27A1, cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily A member
