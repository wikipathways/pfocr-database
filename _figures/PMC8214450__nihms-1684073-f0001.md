caption: Highly simplified diagram of nuclear-organellar communication in an epidermal
  pavement cell in plants. An example of retrograde regulation involving epidermal
  sensory plastids and mitochondria is shown in the SAL1–3′-phosphoadenisine-5′-phosphate
  (SAL1-PAP) pathway. Anterograde signaling is depicted by red dashed arrows, emanating
  from components linked to the growth-stress network represented by TARGET of RAPAMYCIN
  (TOR), SnRK1/2 and associated components. MSH1, shown within the sensory plastid,
  is suppressed by environmental stress and its depletion can induce organellar genome
  changes that are postulated to trigger plastid-nuclear signaling. ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.
