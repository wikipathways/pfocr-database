caption: Tissue ischemia arises from a decreased blood flow. As blood flow decreases
  tissue perfusion and oxygen drop and pH increases. In this microenvironment nitrite
  acts as an NO prodrug being converted by endogenous reductase activity to NO. Thus
  exogenous nitrite selectively delivers exogenous NO to areas where it is most needed.
  NO activates sGC to increase cGMP synthesis. cGMP acts on several downstream targets
  in endothelial cells to stimulate pro-angiogenic responses and in vascular smooth
  muscle cells to dilate blood vessels. At physiological concentrations, TSP1 acts
  primarily through its receptor CD47 to limit sGC activation []. At nM concentrations,
  TSP1 also signals through CD36 to inhibit the same responses [], but CD47 is also
  necessary for these signals to inhibit cGMP signaling. Blockade of TSP1-CD47 signaling
  with monoclonal antibodies to TSP1 () and CD47 or gene silencing of CD47 () increases
  the pro-survival activities of NO and enhances angiogenesis, tissue perfusion and
  blood flow and survival from ischemia.
