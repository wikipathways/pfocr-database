caption: Scheme of the interactions of NO synthesis and endothelin-1 with CDH3 in
  the context of vascular and sympathetic abnormalities in cardiovascular diseases.
  Tissue hypoxia increases the production of endothelin-1, leading to an increase
  in the tissue and plasma levels of endothelin-1. The activation of the endothelin
  receptor B (ETB) leads to the activation of the pathway, resulting in the release
  of NO that causes vascular smooth muscle relaxation and the activation of the L-arginine/NO
  pathway. The overexpression of cadherin-P is linked to the oncogenic signaling of
  NO in human breast tumors. This mechanism involves the activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK
  signaling pathway by NO, in turn leading to the activation of Ets-1, which is a
  transcription factor implicated in metastasis and tumor progression and causes cadherin-P
  upregulation. The cadherin-P signaling pathway in malignant tumors influences the
  invasion, motility, stemness, and metastastic potential of various tissues. ET-1,
  endothelin-1; ETB, endothelin-1 receptor type B; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase;
