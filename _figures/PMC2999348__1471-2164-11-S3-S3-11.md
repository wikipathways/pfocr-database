caption: PhoPQ gene regulatory pathway Manually-curated comprehensive gene regulatory
  pathway network for the phoPQ system. The two component pathway involves transcriptional
  regulation of 44 genes, 5 of which are involved in another cascading two component
  system (pmrBA). A positive feedback loop exists in this pathway, in the form of
  up regulation of phoPQ gene by the system. The figure shows the complete pathway,
  with the positive feedback loop marked in dark color. The pathways have been constructed
  using the Cell Designer 3.0 software which presents a structured (Extensible Markup
  Language (XML)) format data that can be easily rendered into the discrete event
  simulation framework. The process involved 112 experimental reports of this system
  extracted from PubMed [], development of the pathway graphs for each experiment
  and then concatenating those graphs to get the complete pathway graph.
