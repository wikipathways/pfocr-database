caption: Proposed model based on current knowledge on the role of tetrapyrroles in
  drought stress signalling. Drought stress induces secondary stress events including
  chloroplast‐localized oxidative stress, which in turn favours heme production. This
  enhances accumulation of unbound free heme, the plastid signal, for chloroplast‐to‐nuclear
  communication. Because free heme is insoluble and cytotoxic, its mobility is likely
  to be dependent upon both membrane and cytosolic localized heme carrier proteins
  (HCP) and transporters such as TSPO. Upon arrival in the nucleus, heme would post‐translationally
  activate heme‐activated transcription factors (HA‐TFs) including the nuclear factor
  Y (NF‐Y) class of transcription factors. We propose GluTR, encoding the first rate‐limiting
  enzyme of the tetrapyrrole pathway, along with a suite of drought‐responsive and
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification genes to be targets for this transcriptional
  activation. Heme‐induced transcriptional activation would initiate and reinforce
  ROS detoxification, an important mechanism allowing plants to adapt to the prevailing
  drought stress. Dashed arrows indicate ROS transcriptionally induce genes encoding
  tetrapyrrole enzymes. Red question marks denote mechanistic points warranting further
  investigations.
