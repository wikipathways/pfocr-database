caption: (A) Schematic describing inter-cellular ET-1 signaling in the early postnatal
  mouse subventricular zone (SVZ) and subcortical white matter (SCWM). Radial glial
  cells (RGC) in the SVZ secrete ET-1 which binds to Ednrb receptors on OPCs to promote
  their proliferation. Astrocytes in the SCWM secrete ET-1 which binds to Ednrb receptors
  on OPCs to block their differentiation. LV = lateral ventricle. (B) Schematic describing
  inter-cellular ET-1 signaling in the adult mouse following focal demyelination of
  the SCWM. Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the SVZ upregulate ET-1 which binds to Ednrb
  receptors on OPCs to promote their proliferation. Reactive astrocytes in the SCWM
  lesion secrete high levels of ET-1, which indirectly activates Notch signaling in
  OPCs and blocks their differentiation. LV = lateral ventricle. (C) Proposed intracellular
  signaling pathways activated by ET-1 signaling in OPCs. ET-1 binding to the Ednrb
  receptor primarily activates the MAPK/Erk pathway, leading to CREB phosphorylation
  and transcriptional changes that promote proliferation and progenitor maintenance.
  Black arrows indicate well-established protein interactions in OPCs, while gray
  arrows indicate protein interactions that have been described in other cell types,
  but remain uncharacterized in OPCs. Asterisks denote proteins that still require
  confirmation of activation upon ET-1 signaling in OPCs.
