caption: The heme biosynthetic pathway and AIP pathophysiology. Heme biosynthesis
  begins in mitochondria with the conversion of glycine and succinyl-CoA to δ-aminolevulinic
  acid (ALA) through the δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase-1 (ALAS1) enzyme. In the cytoplasm,
  ALA is metabolized to porphobilinogen (PBG) and then to COPROgen III. The latter
  is then transported into mitochondria for the synthesis of heme, which in turn downregulates
  ALAS1. The deficiency of HMBS genes causes a reduction in hepatic heme synthesis,
  leading to the stopping of its negative feedback on ALAS1. Thereby, the levels of
  porphyrin precursors (ALA and PBG), mainly in response to precipitating factors,
  may accumulate in the liver, systemic circulation, and urine, triggering neurological
  damage.
