caption: 'General hypothesis of AVP synthesis and possible mechanism of action in
  insects. (A) Immune recognition of insect viruses. The PAMPs of insect RNA and DNA
  viruses are recognized by specific PRRs located in the cell membrane or cytoplasm
  of hemocytes, epithelia or fat body. (B) Potential downstream signaling cascade
  reactions including JAK-STAT, Toll, Imd, and other pathway to produce AVPs. (C)
  The mechanism of action of AVPs covers stages in almost the entire life cycle of
  the virus: virion inhibition; adsorption; viral entry; endosomal escape; viral uncoating;
  viral genome transcription and translation, and release of mature virions. Additionally,
  AVPs may inhibit viral infection by regulating the host immune system. As a counterdefense,
  insect viruses may employ several strategies to escape the antiviral effect of AVPs.'
