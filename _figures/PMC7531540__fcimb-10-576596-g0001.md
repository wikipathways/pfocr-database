caption: Roles of aerobic glycolysis. Aerobic glycolysis generates metabolic intermediates
  that are used in other biosynthetic pathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway,
  synthesis of hexosamines, glycerol-3-phosphate for fatty acid synthesis, amino acid
  synthesis, and one carbon metabolism. Aerobic glycolysis is also involved in maintaining
  redox balance (NAD+/NADH) in the cell. Inhibition of hexokinase (HK) in the first
  step of glycolysis by 2-DG will additionally inhibit these pathways and redox homeostasis.
  Thus, inhibitors reducing the glycolytic flux by acting on enzymes near the end
  of glycolytic pathway, such as OXA, on LDH, or LDHA knock-out mice will enable a
  more accurate assessment of the contribution of glycolysis to effector functions
  of the cell. This figure also demonstrates how both lactate from glycolysis and
  carbon dioxide generated from mitochondrial metabolism contribute to the acidification
  of the extracellular environment (ECAR). HK, hexokinase; 2-DG, 2-deoxyglucose; Glc-6-P,
