caption: 'Metabolism of glutamine between normal cells and cancer cells. The glutamine
  transporters (SLC1A5, SLC38A1/SLC38A2, and SLC6A14) expressed on the cell membrane
  facilitate the transport of glutamine into the cytoplasm. Subsequently, SLC1A5 variants
  transport glutamine into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is converted to glutamate
  by GLS. Then, mitochondrial glutamate is converted to α-KG by GLUD1 or various mitochondrial
  transaminases (including GPT2 and GOT2). Glutamine-derived α-KG provides metabolites
  for the tricarboxylic acid cycle and can also support OXPHOS or reductive carboxylation
  pathways. Cancer cells uptake a significant amount of glutamine from plasma through
  protein transporters. The first and rate-limiting step of glutamine breakdown is
  catalyzed by GLS in the mitochondria, converting glutamine to glutamate. This enzyme
  exists in two forms: GLS1 and GLS2, both of which convert it into glutamate. Glutamate
  is further converted to α-KG by mitochondrial GLUD1 and releases ammonia. α-KG enters
  the TCA cycle in cancer cells and is converted back to glutamate. In cancer cells,
  the production of NAAG, derived from glutamine, is significantly increased, and
  high levels of NAAG are observed in advanced cancer. The NAAG storage cycle provides
  a mechanism for cancer cells to store this important metabolic product by converting
  glutamate generated from glutamine into NAAG and then back to glutamate. c-Myc promotes
  glutamine uptake by targeting the expression of glutamine transporters SLC1A5, SLC38A1,
  and SLC7A5. Glutamine activates mTORC1 through the SLC7A5/SLC3A2 antiporter system,
  leading to the efflux of glutamine out of the cell in exchange for leucine influx,
  a potent Rag-dependent mTORC1 activator. GLS, glutaminase; αKG, α-ketoglutarate;
