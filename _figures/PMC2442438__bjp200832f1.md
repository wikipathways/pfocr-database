caption: Alcohol metabolism and alcohol metabolites are to a large extent responsible
  for toxicity of alcohols (ethanol (EtOH), methanol and ethylene glycol). (a) The
  constitutive alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) pathway produces acetaldehyde that is further
  metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Decreased ALDH activity in individuals
  with low-activity version of ALDH, as well as block of ALDH by drugs such as disulphiram
  is associated with acetaldehyde accumulation and aversive reactions to EtOH ingestion.
  The competitive blocker of the most abundant forms of ADH, fomepizole, is now used
  (instead of EtOH) to aid in the management of methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning
  by slowing the conversion of methanol and ethylene glycol into their highly toxic
  metabolites. (b) The inducible microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS) utilizes
  the cytochrome P450 system to convert EtOH into acetaldehyde. After chronic alcohol
  consumption, the activity of this system increases due to a rise in, especially,
  the CYP2E1 isoform, of cytochrome P450. The upregulation of this system contributes
  to alcohol tolerance, and it is likely that oxidative stress associated with the
  activation of the MEOS makes an important contribution to alcohol-induced liver
  damage.
