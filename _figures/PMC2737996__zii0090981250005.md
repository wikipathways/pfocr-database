caption: Summary of environmentally responsive signaling pathways and Streptococcus
  interactive mechanisms in C. albicans. (A) Pathways associated with hyphal development
  or biofilm formation, based on information from references , , , , and . Various
  environmental cues (top) interact with cell surface receptors to activate intracellular
  signaling pathways, leading to transcription factor modulation. cAMP, cyclic AMP;
  MAPKKK, MAP kinase kinase kinase; MAPKK, MAP kinase kinase; MAPK, MAP kinase; AC,
  adenylate cyclase; PM, plasma membrane. (B) Proposed interactions of S. gordonii
  with C. albicans resulting in stimulation of hyphal development and biofilm formation.
  Streptococcus cells produce diffusible signals (DS) mediated in part through activity
  of luxS, which might include metabolic by-products, such as H2O2. The effects of
  these diffusible signals may be intensified by contact signals (CS) generated through
  attachment of S. gordonii to C. albicans receptors expressed on mother cells or
  hyphae. Streptococci also appear to suppress the inhibitory effects of farnesol
  (Fnl) on hyphal formation, which does not involve farnesol inactivation. This may
  suggest that an alternative signal response generated through recognition of S.
  gordonii overcomes the repression of morphogenesis as a result of the farnesol-responsive
  signaling pathway.
