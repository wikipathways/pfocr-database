caption: Model of the tumorigenic role of cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (Cdk16). In normal
  tissue (left), Cdk16 is required for spermatogenesis and neuron differentiation.
  In cancer cells, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells (right),
  Cdk16 phosphorylates p27 at Ser10, thereby promoting p27 ubiquitination/degradation,
  which leads to cell cycle progression and decreased levels of apoptosis. An unknown
  mechanism may also exist in the Cdk16–apoptosis pathway. Lipid nanoparticle-mediated
  siRNA (LNP-siRNA) therapy against Cdk16 recently succeeded in a murine xenograft
  model.
