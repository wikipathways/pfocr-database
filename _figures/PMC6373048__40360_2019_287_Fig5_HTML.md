caption: Schematic representation mechanism of APs inducing OB cells apoptosis. The
  Aps inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway, as a result, Bcl-2, Mcl-1 (antiapoptotic
  protein) transcript reduced and Bax, (proapoptotic protein) transcripted elevated.
  Then, Caspase-3 was activated. Eventually, this led to OB cells apoptosis. On the
  contrary, resevratrol could reverse the above effects
