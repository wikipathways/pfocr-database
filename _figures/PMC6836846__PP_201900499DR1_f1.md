caption: The biosynthetic pathway of pyrethrins as presently known, and proposed step(s)
  for the synthesis of pyrethrolone in T. cinerariifolium. The synthesis of JA from
  linolenic acid is catalyzed by lipoxygenase (TcLOX), allene oxidase synthase (TcAOS),
  allene oxide cyclase (TcAOC), cis (+)-12-oxo-phytodienenic acid reductase (TcOPR),
  and three rounds of β-oxidation. JA is metabolized to jasmone in a set of as-yet
  unidentified reactions. Jasmone is converted to jasmolone in a reaction catalyzed
  by TcJMH (). Pyrethrolone differs from jasmolone by the presence of a double bond
  between ω1-carbon and the penultimate carbon of the side chain in the former. The
  introduction of this double bond in jasmolone could be accomplished by a single
  reaction or by first hydroxylation and then dehydration. Chrysanthemic acid is generated
  from two molecules of DMAPP in sequential reactions catalyzed by TcCDS, TcADH, and
  TcALDH (). Pyrethric acid is generated from two molecules of DMAPP by the action
  of these three enzymes plus TcCHH and TcCCMT (). The pyrethrin esters are formed
  in a reaction catalyzed by the GDSL lipase-like protein (TcGLIP), which links the
  acid moiety to the alcohol moiety (). Pyrethrins with chrysanthemic acid as the
  acid moiety are called “type-I” pyrethrins; pyrethrins with pyrethric acid as the
  acid moiety are called “type-II” pyrethrins.
