caption: DNA damage secondary to radiation, chemical agents or accumulation of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) is the main cause of cellular senescence-inducing stress. Proliferation-induced
  telomere shortening can also activate the DNA damage response, which in turn leads
  to activation of the p53–p21 pathway, inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)–cyclin
  complexes and formation of the DREAM complex, which represses cell-cycle genes,
  leading to cell-cycle arrest and senescence. Activated p21 can also induce further
  ROS production, forming a vicious circle. In addition, impaired mitophagy can lead
  to mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive ROS production. ROS can induce senescence
  independently of the DNA damage response by activating the p16–RB pathway via activation
  of ERK, which inhibits BMI1 and thereby enables activation of p16, and by activating
  p38MAPK signalling, which upregulates ETS2 and in turn activates p16, and by inhibiting
  NAD+, which leads to reduced expression of sirtuin 1 and activation of FOXO3, which
  activates p53. P16 inhibits the formation of CDK4/6–cyclin D complexes and thereby
  promotes formation of the RB–2F complex, which inhibits the transcription of cell-cycle
  genes. Oncogene activation can activate the p53–p21 pathway not only via the DNA
  damage response, but also via the ARF–MDM2 signalling. In addition, oncogene activation
  can activate the p16–RB pathway via p38MAPK signalling. Loss of tumour suppressor
  genes induces senescence via Akt–mTOR signalling, which activates p53. Other factors
  that regulate the p53–p21 pathway include α-Klotho, MBP1 and p300. Epigenetic alterations
  such as methylation (Me) and acetylation (Ac) can induce senescence through the
  p16–RB pathway. NF-κB signalling regulates the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
  (SASP) and together with the transcription factor C/EBPβ, co-activates promoters
  of SASP genes, such as those that encode pro-inflammatory cytokines. The DNA damage
  response protein ATM together with NEMO activates the NF-κB–C/EBPβ signalling pathway.
  ROS can activate the SASP not only by promoting nuclear translocation of NEMO and
  activation of ATM, but also by inhibiting sirtuin 1 and activating p38MAPK and TGFβ,
  which in turn activate NF-κB. Heat shock, metabolic disorders, mechanical damage
  and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can also activate the NF-κB–C/EBPβ pathway
  via p38MAPK signalling. Cytoplasmic DNA accumulation can trigger aberrant activation
  of cGAS-STING cytoplasmic DNA sensors and promote the SASP via activation of NF-κB.
  Impairment of autophagy hampers degradation of the transcription factor GATA4, which
  activates NF-κB and leads to initiation of the SASP. Notably, oncogenic Ras can
  activate C/EBPβ via ERK–p90 signalling and histone epigenetic changes can regulate
  the SASP independently of the NF-κB–C/EBPβ pathway. ARF, ADP-ribosylation factor;
