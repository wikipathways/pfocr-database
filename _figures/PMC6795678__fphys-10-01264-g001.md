caption: Scheme of the parietal cell of a gastric gland. The scheme explains receptors,
  ion transporters, and the neuroendocrine regulation of gastric acid secretion ().
  The components of concentrated hydrochloric acid are secreted by proton pumps (H+,
  K+ ATPases) and chloride channels. Aspirin enters the parietal cell from the bloodside
  (basolateral) and leads to an intracellular increase of the signaling molecule NO,
  converted by NOS (; ; ). The increase of NO leads to an increase of sGC, which increases
  intracellular cGMP levels and ultimately leads to the insertion of the H+, K+ ATPase
  on the apical membrane of the parietal cell. The conversion of NO can be inhibited
  by L-NAME, an analog of arginine, which inhibits NO production. Moreover, the intracellular
  NO/sGC/cGMP pathway can be inhibited by the sGC-inhibitor ODQ. Intracellular rise
  in cAMP (by histamine) or Ca2+ (by histamine, acetylcholine, Ca2+, or gastrin) following
  the stimulation of the basolateral receptors has a similar effect on the H+, K+
  ATPases like cGMP. The direct neuronal stimulation appears by acetylcholine from
  the ENS, whereas the hormonal regulation of the parietal cell is dependent on neighboring,
  histamine-secreting ECL-cells and on G-cells, which secrete gastrin. Gastrin also
  influences histamine secretion in ECL-cells and leads to an increase of histamine
  secretion, which is described as the “histamine-gastrin-axis.” Somatostatin, secreted
  by D-cells, decreases intracellular cAMP levels and will stop the insertion and
  activation of H+, K+ ATPases.
