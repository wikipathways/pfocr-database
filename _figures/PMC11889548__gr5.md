caption: Abnormal Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction caused by EFCAB7 mutation.A, mechanism
  of Hedgehog Signaling Activity. Hedgehog signaling activity is primarily directed
  through the activated membrane protein receptor SMO, which, upon activation, stimulates
  the nuclear transcription factor GLI gene family. These GLI proteins then enter
  the nucleus and initiate the expression of downstream target genes. Notably, both
  the SMO receptor and GLI transcription factors are localized on the ciliary membrane
  or within the cilia. B, effect of EFCAB7 Mutation on Hh Signaling. Mutation in EFCAB7
  leads to a decrease in the number and length of cilia, which subsequently impairs
  the cilia-mediated Hedgehog signaling pathway. The absence of EFCAB7 protein may
  hinder the transport of SMO within primary cilia, resulting in a significant reduction
  in the expression of the GLI transcription factor. Consequently, the decreased expression
  of GLI-binding target genes, such as Myh6, Zfpm1, and Nkx2-5, leads to outflow tract
  dysplasia and congenital heart defects, including TOF
