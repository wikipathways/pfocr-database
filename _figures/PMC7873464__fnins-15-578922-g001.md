caption: Urea Cycle. This pathway takes place in the periportal hepatocytes. Urea
  synthesis proceeds via a sequence of six enzymatic reactions, the first three located
  in the mitochondrion and the last three in the cytosol. The continuity of this process
  also requires transport proteins in the mitochondrial membrane, such as ORNT1, which
  enables ornithine (Orn) import, and citrulline, carbamoyl phosphate synthase; and
  OTC, ornithine transcarbamylase.
