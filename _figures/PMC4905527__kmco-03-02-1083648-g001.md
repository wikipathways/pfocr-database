caption: hMENA11a delivers survival signals and promotes resistance to PI3K inhibition.
  (A) Overexpression of hMENA11a participates in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and
  survival pathway activation. Specific silencing of hMENA11a inhibits RTK activation
  (i.e., P-HER3), favoring cell apoptosis. (B) Treatment of HER2+ breast cancer cell
  lines with PI3K inhibitors determines FOXO3a nuclear translocation and HER3 upregulation,
  a mechanism involved in therapy resistance. PI3K inhibitors induce phosphorylation
  of hMENA11a. In cells that are specifically silenced for hMENA11a and treated with
  PI3K inhibitors, FOXO3a is sequestered in the cytoplasm and does not shuttle into
  the nucleus and HER3 is not upregulated, rendering cells sensitive to therapy. BIM,
  Bcl2-interacting mediator of cell death; CASP9, caspase 9; FOXO3a, Forkhead box
  O3a; hMENA, human MENA; P-HER3, phospho-human epidermal growth factor receptor 3;
