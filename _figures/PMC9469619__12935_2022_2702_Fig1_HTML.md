caption: A schematic diagram of the role of several ncRNAs in triggering the Sonic
  Hedgehog signaling cascade in Breast Cancer. Mounting researches suggest that dysregulation
  of sonic hedgehog signaling pathway can play a key role in tumorigenesis in breast
  cancer cells. As an illustration, the recent study has detected that overexpression
  of lncRNA-Hh can activate Shh-GLI1 signaling and promote the expression levels of
  SOX2 and OCT4, thereby enhancing cancer stem cells generation in Twist-positive
  breast cancer cells []. Further experiment has validated that lncRNA LOC101930370
  can significantly elevate SHH and Gli-1 expression via sponging miR-1471, therefore
  promoting cell proliferation and metastasis in breast cancer cells by modulating
  the hedgehog cascade []. Moreover, another research has pointed out that miR-26a
  has a remarkable part in suppressing breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion
  via downregulating the expression levels of FAM98A, SHH, SMO and GlI1, thereby inactivating
  the sonic hedgehog pathway in tumor cells []
