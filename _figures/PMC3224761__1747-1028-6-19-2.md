caption: A dual role for the SIN in MOR pathway regulation. The SIN mediated regulation
  of MOR during mitosis appears to have two distinct cell cycle dependent effects
  on MOR function. While the SIN inhibits MOR activity during mitosis to keep MOR
  from interfering with cytokinesis, it may also play a role in enhancing MOR activity
  during the following interphase in order promote polarized growth.
