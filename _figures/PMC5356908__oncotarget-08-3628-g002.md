caption: 'In response to partial hepatectomy, the liver shows an acute phase response,
  during which the liver is enriched in several chemotaxis mediators for macrophages,
  such as osteopontin (mainly secreted by biliary epithelial cells []), MCP-1 (mainly
  secreted by hepatic stellate cells and biliary epithelial cells [, ] ), and ICAM-1
  (mainly secreted by sinusoidal endothelial cells []). In the liver, the increased
  levels of LPS as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate the complement system
  and the TLR/MyD88 pathway in macrophages. This leads to the activation of NFκB and
  results in the release of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. TNF-α could function
  in an autocrine manner and further activate NFκB. IL-6 binds to its receptors on
  hepatocytes and activate STAT3 signaling, thus promote the proliferation of hepatocytes.
  Abbreviations: MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; ICAM-1, intercellular
  adhesion molecule 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α;
  IL-6, interlukin-6; STAT3, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.'
