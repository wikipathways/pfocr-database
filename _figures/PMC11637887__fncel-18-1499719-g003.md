caption: 'Comparison of changes in the eye among normal, non-proliferative diabetic
  retinopathy (NPDR), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), and the signaling
  pathways of DNA methylation alterations associated with DR development. (A) Schematic
  diagram illustrating changes in the eye under normal, NPDR, and PDR conditions.
  Normal eye: The retinal vascular network is well-organized and intact, with no signs
  of abnormal proliferation or damage. The vascular barrier is fully functional. NPDR
  eye: Shows microvascular abnormalities, including tortuosity, dilation, and microaneurysms.
  The vascular barrier is compromised, potentially accompanied by mild edema or exudates.
  PDR eye: Displays significant retinal damage with severe compromise of the vascular
  barrier, resulting in extensive exudation and hemorrhage. Notable features include
  extensive neovascularization. BM: basement membrane. (B) Mechanisms of DNA methylation
  changes and cellular function alterations in a hyperglycemic environment. High Glucose
  induces oxidative stress and epigenetically modulates the expression of TET2 and
  DNMT1. Elevated TET2 levels decrease methylation of the matrix metalloproteinase-9
  (MMP-9) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) promoters, enhancing
  their expression and disrupting mitochondrial homeostasis and signaling pathways.
  Concurrently, increased DNMT1 activity leads to hypermethylation of the Timp1 and
  proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) promoters, suppressing their expression.
  These changes result in increased MMP-9 activity, compromised antioxidant defenses,
  and elevated apoptosis. Additionally, high Glucose levels correlate with increased
  methylation in the mitochondrial D-loop and base mismatches, impairing mitochondrial
  biogenesis and function, thereby affecting cellular energy metabolism and survival'
