caption: A schematic of the Gp1 mGluR/FMRP pathway. Depicted is the Gp1 mGluR receptor
  coupled to the Gq-mediated signaling cascade. Gq signaling liberates DAG and IP3
  through phospholipase C. G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 2/3 is known to
  antagonize this signaling pathway (), and at least one GRK, GRK 4 mRNA, is a known
  FMRP cargo and is localized to dendrites (). FMRP modulation of activity-dependent
  translation is downstream of PKC activation. The black box represents the unknown
  intermediates in this step. FMRP directly interacts with polyribosomes, and phosphorylation
  is thought to be one requirement in this step (, ). FMRP, in a messenger ribonucleoprotein
  complex containing FXR1P among other RNA-binding proteins, is known to bind a large
  number of mRNA cargoes where it may inhibit the translation of some or enhance the
  translation of others. One complicating factor at the synapse is that a number of
  receptor systems are known to modulate production of PKC, suggesting that multiple
  neuromodulatory receptors may be impacted by FMRP activity in a manner analogous
  to the Gp1 mGluR system.
