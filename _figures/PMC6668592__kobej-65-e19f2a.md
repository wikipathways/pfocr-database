caption: 'Comparison between CRC and normal tissue samples.(A) Differences in the
  levels of metabolites related to glycolysis, the TCA cycle, or the surrounding pathways
  between CRC and normal tissue samples. (B) Differences in the levels of metabolites
  related to nucleotide de novo synthesis or salvage pathways between CRC and normal
  tissue samples. The values indicate the mean relative levels of metabolites in the
  CRC or normal tissue samples divided by tissue weight and adjusted for the level
  of the relevant internal standard. In this figure, the differences in the levels
  of some metabolites related to glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the TCA
  cycle, glutathione biosynthesis, or amino acid pathways between the CRC and normal
  tissue samples are shown. Adenine, Uracil, Thymine, Hypoxanthine, Hypotaurine, β-Alanine,
  Taurine, Tryptophan, Glutamine, Glutamic acid, and Putrescine are the results of
  GC/MS analysis. L-Cystathionine, L-Cysteine, Glycine, L-Ornithine, L-Kynurenine,
  L-Asparate, L-Asparagine, L-Phenylalanine, L-Serine, L-Threonine, L-Tyrosine, L-Proline,
  L-Arginine, L-Valine, L-Lysine, L-Leucine, L-Isoleucine, Guanine, Guanosine, Uric
  acid, Uridine, Adenosine, and Xanthine are the results of LC/MS-based cation analysis.

  2-Phosohogleceric acid, PEP, Pyruvic acid, DHAP, Quinolinic acid, NAD, Malic acid,
  Oxalic acid, Fumaric acid, and Succinic acid are the results of LC/MS-based anion
  analysis. The p-values were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test (*p <0.05;
  **p <0.01; ***p <0.005). The white and black bars show the results for the normal
  and CRC tissue samples, respectively. Ketogenic amino acids, glucogenic amino acids,
  and ketoglucogenic amino acids are indicated in blue, red, and green, respectively.
