caption: 'The roles of miR-30c family members in drug resistance. Note: miR-30c promotes
  the paclitaxel- and doxorubicin-resistance by blocking the TWF1-IL-11 pathway.Meanwhile,YWHAZ
  (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/Tryptophan 5-Monooxygenase Activation Protein Zeta) was
  down-regulated by the specific binding with miR-30c, followed bythe activation of
  MAPK pathway andthe enhanced doxorubicin-resistance. In addition, miR-30c facilitates
  the tamoxifen resistance through the reduction of EGFR expression.'
