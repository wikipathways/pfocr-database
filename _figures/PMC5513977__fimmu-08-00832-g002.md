caption: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I antigen-processing and presentation pathway.
  (A) This model depicting how a pathogen (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) is
  taken up and processed into small peptides (8–16aa) before binding to HLA-I molecule.
  (B) HLA-I is assembled in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and consists of heavy chain
  and β-2 microglobulin (β2M). Proteins and antigen are degraded/processed by cytosolic
  and nuclear proteasomes resulting in short peptides called epitopes. Epitopes are
  translocated into the ER via transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP).
  These peptides may require additional trimming in the ER prior to binding to HLA-I
  molecules. Eventually, epitope:HLA complex will be transported via the Golgi and
  presented on the cell surface of CD8+ T cell. (C) Recognition of the epitope:HLA-I
  complex via T cell receptor (TCR) activates cytotoxic T cell (CTL) that releases
  perforin and granzyme B (GzmB) to eliminate the infected cell.
