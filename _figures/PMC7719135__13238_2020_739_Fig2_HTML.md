caption: The mechanism how MCPIP1 and cytokines mutually regulated in macrophages.
  The upper green part indicates the mechanism how cytokines and LPS regulate MCPIP1
  expression. Activation of TLR4 by LPS, or IL-1R by IL-1, subsequently activates
  the inhibitor of NF-κβ kinase (IKK) complex, leading to the phosphorylation and
  degradation of IκBα. Then NF-κβ is released and translocate to the nucleus to induce
  the transcription of MCPIP1 gene. MAPkinase pathway is also activated and phosphorylated
  Elk-1 promotes MCPIP1 transcription. Post-transcriptional regulation happened in
  cytoplasm, MCPIP1 mRNAs interact with miR-9 or MCPIP1 protein and undergo degradation.
  Those translated MCPIP1 protein can be phosphorylated by NF-κβ signaling and then
  degraded by proteasome machinery. The blue triangle indicates a different mechanism
  of MCPIP1 protein degradation in T cells. It’s mediated by protease Malt1. The Lower
  yellow part indicates the mechanism how MCPIP1 protein regulates cytokines production.
  MCPIP1 interacts with USP10 and TANK to inhibit NF-κβ signaling by deubiquitinating
  the activated TRAF6. In cytoplasm, MCPIP1 interacts with cytokines transcripts to
  induce mRNA decay. In addition, its anti-Dicer RNase activity inhibits miRNAs maturation.
  In nucleus, MCPIP1 directly inhibits translocated NF-κβ and AP-1 bind to the target
  proinflammatory cytokines genes, then suppresses proinflammatory cytokines transcription
