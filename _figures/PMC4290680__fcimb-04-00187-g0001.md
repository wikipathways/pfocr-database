caption: 'Structural model of and cell signaling pathways triggered by ManLAM and
  its biosynthetic precursors LM and PIMs. (A) ManLAM is a 17 kDa heterogenous macromolecule
  exhibiting a tripartite structure: (i) a MPI anchor, which can be mono- to tetra-acylated,
  (ii) a polysaccharide backbone composed of D-Mannan and D-Arabinan, and (iii) mannose
  caps, which are mono-, (α1→2)-di- and (α1→2)-tri-mannoside units. PIMs and LM are
  biosynthetic precursors of LAM. Their structure is based on the MPI anchor, glycosylated
  by one to six mannose units (PIMs) or the full mannan domain (LM). To our present
  knowledge, the MPI anchor and the Mannose caps are the main structural determinants
  of ManLAM biological properties. (B) LM, and to a much lesser extent PIMs, PILAM
  and ManLAM, induce pro-inflammatory cytokines production in DCs and macrophages
  via the recognition of tri- or tetra-acylated MPI anchor by TLR2/TLR1 heterodimer.
  ManLAM elicits cytokines in bone marrow-derived DCs via mannose caps binding to
  Dectin-2. But it also inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12,
  TNF-α, and IL-6, and induces IL-10 by LPS-stimulated human DCs through DC-SIGN ligation.
  The signaling pathway involves activation of Raf-1, which results in the phosphorylation
  of the p65 subunit of NF-κB at Ser276, leading to the acetylation of p65 by two
  histone acetyltransferases. Translocation of NF-κB in response to TLR activation,
  and initially dedicated to the transcription of the pro-inflammatory cytokine-coding
  genes, is reoriented on anti-inflammatory promoter targets, resulting in the decrease
  of these cytokines to the benefit of IL-10. ManLAM also inhibits IL-12 and TNF-α
  in macrophages independently of IL-10 production, by directly acting on the TLR4
  signaling cascade through induced expression of IRAK-M, which can compete with IRAK1
  for binding to TRAF6 and thus inhibit NF-κB activation. ManLAM also promotes tyrosine
  dephosphorylation of multiple proteins including MAPK, an effect that might be explained
  by an increased activity of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. MR is likely to mediate
  ManLAM immunosuppressive activities in macrophages, although it has no signaling
  motif in its cytoplasmic domain, raising the intriguing question as to whether it
  associates with adapter molecules to transduce signals. The ability of ManLAM to
  bind MR might in part determine its other inhibitory properties as detailed in Figure
  .'
