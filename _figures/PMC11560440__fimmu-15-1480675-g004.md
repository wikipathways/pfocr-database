caption: Schematic model of the pathogenesis of SjD. Stimulation by antigens, such
  as self-derived RNA and viruses, triggers and activates the TLR8 signaling pathway
  in TLR8+ monocytes/macrophages. These TLR8+ monocytes/macrophages strongly express
  CD86 and induce T cell activation by binding CD28 on T cells. CD4+ Th cells are
  activated by antigen presentation through the MHC II pathway, whereas Naïve CD8+
  T cells become effector CD8+ CTLs by antigen cross-presentation through the MHC
  I pathway. CD8+ CTLs cause apoptosis of salivary gland cells via their cytotoxicity.
  Some of the effector CD4+ T cells may help in the differentiation of B cells to
  plasma cells, which produce antibodies to the autoantigens, resulting in irreversible
  secretory dysfunction. TLR, Toll-like receptor; CD, cluster of differentiation;
  CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocytes; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Th, T helper
  cells. Figure created with BioRender.com
