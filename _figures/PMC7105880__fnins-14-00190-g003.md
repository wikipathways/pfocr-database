caption: Glucose metabolism. Glucose is first phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate
  (glucose-6-P), which has three fates that correspond to the three main functions
  of glucose. First, energy can be stored as glycogen. Glycogen can later be mobilized
  and subsequently metabolized to pyruvate. Second, energy in the form of ATP can
  be produced by glucose-6-P entering glycolysis, supplying pyruvate for the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle in the mitochondria and the associated oxidative phosphorylation.
  Glycolysis produces ATP and NADH. Depending on the cell type, pyruvate can also
  be converted into lactate through the action of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Third,
  reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH are produced in the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP).
