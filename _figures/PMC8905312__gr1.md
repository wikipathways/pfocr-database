caption: Cellular stress responses important for mediating cell wall and cell membrane
  integrity upon antifungal treatmentThe azoles and polyenes target the biosynthesis
  of ergosterol, or ergosterol directly, leading to cell membrane stress. The echinocandins
  inhibit the biosynthesis of β-glucan leading to cell wall stress. A central cellular
  regulator modulating antifungal tolerance and resistance is the molecular chaperone
  Hsp90, which is post-translationally regulated by the protein kinase complex CK2
  as well as lysine deacetylases (KDACs). Hsp90 also interacts with its co-chaperone
  Sgt1 and with the kinase Tor1. Two important client proteins of Hsp90 are the protein
  phosphatase calcineurin (composed of Cna1, Cnb1, and its immunophilins FKBP12 and
  cyclophilin A (CaM)) and components of the PKC cell wall integrity pathway (Pkc1,
  Bck1, Mkk1, and Mkc1). These two cascades activate the transcription factors Crz1
  and Swi4, respectively, as well as additional regulators that remain to be identified.
  Additional cellular factors include the transcription factors Cas5 and Rim101, the
  eukaryotic chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex, and the protein kinase Yck2.
  Finally, the cyclic AMP (cAMP) protein kinase A (composed of Tpk1, Tpk2, and Bcy1
  subunits) cascade has also been implicated in drug-induced cell membrane stress.
  Notably, there are many other factors which contribute to the cellular response
  to antifungal stress that remain to be identified. Pharmacological inhibitors that
  target these regulators are depicted in blue font.
