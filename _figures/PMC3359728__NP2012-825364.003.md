caption: Regulation of homeostatic AMPAR trafficking and turnover. Multiple functional
  molecules and signaling cascades are involved in the homeostatic up- or downregulation
  induced by prolonged activitydeprivation or overactivation, respectively. Elevated
  synaptic activation stimulates the expression of an immediate-early gene product,
  Arc, which, together with endophilin and dynamin, promotes AMPAR internalization.
  This process also requires the association of AMPARs with PICK1, and Nedd4-mediated
  receptor ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (left panel). Under activity
  deprivation, varied signaling cascades are implicated in AMPAR trafficking and synaptic
  localization. Activation of TNFR1 by glia-derived TNFα, or PI3K pathway by BDNF/TrKBR
  and TNFR1 signaling, significantly enhances the postsynaptic AMPAR levels. β3 integrin
  signaling inhibits the activity of RAP1, which is known to enhance AMPAR degradation.
  Also, calcium influx through the inactivity-induced GluA2-lacking AMPARs (Cp-AMPAR)
  activates the CaMKII pathway, causing AMPAR phosphorylation and insertion. In addition,
  retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) and FMRP mediate AMPAR local synthesis in postsynaptic
  domain during activity deprivation-induced upscaling (right panel).
