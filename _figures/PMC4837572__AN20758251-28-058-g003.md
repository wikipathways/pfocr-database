caption: 'Synaptic transmission: lipid-protein interactions. The neurotransmitter
  is released from the synaptic vesicles upon fusion (exocytosis) with the presynaptic
  membrane at a specific site (termed active zone) in response to Ca2+ influx via
  potential-gated Ca-channels. The vesicle fusion is governed by proteins forming
  a SNARE complex (synaptobrevin, syntaxin, SNAP-25) and is dictated by numerous cholesterol-binding
  proteins (synaptotagmin, Munc-18, NCS-1) and signaling molecules (protein kinases,
  NADPH-oxidase/Nox). After fusion, the protein and lipid components of the vesicles
  undergo clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The vast majority of synaptic vesicles form
  the reserve pool, which maintains neurotransmission during prolonged synaptic activity.
  These vesicles are translocated into the active zone through an actin-and synapsin-dependent
  pathway. Glutamate released from the synaptic vesicles changes the Na+/Ca2+ conductivity
  of the postsynaptic membrane by activating AMPA/NMDA receptors. The surface expression
  of the postsynaptic receptors is dependent on the exo-and endocytotic trafficking
  of these receptors, which is regulated by small GTPase (Rab11) and protein kinase
  (Cdc42, GSK3β, phosphoinositol-3-kinase/PI-3-K). The receptor-dependent signaling
  is associated with many proteins (Src, ERC, Cav-1). As illustrated in Fig.2. Cholesterol
  molecules and its clusters are shown in black, phosphoinositol-4,5-biphosphates
  (PI-4,5-P2,) in red, and cholesterol/PI-4,5-P2-binding proteins. See text for a
  detailed explanation.'
