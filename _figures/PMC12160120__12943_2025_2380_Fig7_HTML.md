caption: 'Synergistic Mechanisms and Translational Potential of cGAS-STING Pathway
  Combined with Other Therapies. (A) Combination with Conventional Therapies: Radiotherapy
  and chemotherapy enhance antitumor immunity by indirectly activating the cGAS-STING
  pathway via DNA damage induction. For instance, radiotherapy combined with STING
  agonists promotes IFN-I secretion and T cell responses, suppresses metastasis, and
  mitigates adverse effects; Chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cisplatin, 5-FU) synergize
  with STING activation to improve antigen presentation efficiency. (B) Combination
  with Cancer Vaccines: STING agonists serve as vaccine adjuvants by activating dual
  innate and adaptive immune responses, reshaping the TIME, enhancing vaccine-primed
  T cell infiltration, and overcoming resistance to PD-1 inhibitors. (C) Combination
  with ICIs: cGAS-STING signaling converts “cold tumors” into “hot tumors” by upregulating
  CXCL9/10 and PD-L1 expression, thereby promoting T cell infiltration and synergizing
  with PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibitors to amplify therapeutic efficacy. (D) Combination with
  CAR-T cell Therapy: STING activation recruits CAR-T cells to tumors via CXCL9/10
  secretion, reverses the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and enhances CAR-T cell
  expansion and cytotoxicity'
