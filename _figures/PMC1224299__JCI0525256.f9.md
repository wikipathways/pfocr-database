caption: Inhibitory effect of PUFAs on ChREBP activation and translocation. Under
  basal conditions of low glucose and insulin concentrations, ChREBP is phosphorylated
  and localized in the cytosol of hepatocytes. Its nuclear translocation is rapidly
  induced under high glucose and insulin concentrations. The nuclear translocation
  of ChREBP is controlled by a mechanism of dephosphorylation and phosphorylation.
  While the dephosphorylation of serine residue 196 (Ser196) allows ChREBP translocation
  into the nucleus, the dephosphorylation of threonine residue 666 (Thr666) alleviates
  DNA-binding inhibition. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), selectively activated by
  X5P, is believed to be responsible for both cytosolic and nuclear dephosphorylation
  of ChREBP. Then ChREBP binds its response element (ChoRE) to activate glycolytic
  and lipogenic gene expression. In the presence of PUFAs, ChREBP is retained in the
  cytosol through the specific inhibition of GK and G6PDH activities, key enzymes
  of glycolysis and of the pentose phosphate pathway, respectively.
