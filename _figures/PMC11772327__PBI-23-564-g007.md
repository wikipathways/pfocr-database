caption: 'The proposed biosynthetic pathway of LC‐alkanes pentadecane and heptadecane
  in Pogostemon cablin. The schematic view of the proposed biosynthetic pathway of
  LC‐alkanes pentadecane and heptadecane in Pogostemon cablin is based on the fatty
  acid and VLC‐alkane biosynthetic pathways in Arabidopsis (Bernard et al., 2012;
  Bernard and Joubès, 2013; Lee and Suh, 2015; Pascal et al., 2019). The C16 and C18
  free fatty acids (FFAs) that are synthesized through the plastidial de novo synthesis
  pathway are exported by fatty acid exporters (FAX) (Bonaventure et al., 2003) from
  plastid into cytosol and activated to C16 acyl‐CoA (palmitoyl‐CoA) and C18 acyl‐CoA
  (stearyl‐CoA) by long‐chain acyl‐CoA synthetase (LACS) (Schnurr et al., 2004; Weng
  et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2019), respectively. The enzymatic alkane‐forming complex
  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that contains ECERIFERUM1 (CER1) homologue, CER3
  and CYTB5s from P. cablin catalyses the conversion of palmitoyl‐CoA and stearyl‐CoA
  to long‐chain alkanes pentadecane and heptadecane, respectively. Meanwhile C16 acyl‐CoA
  and C18 acyl‐CoA are elongated to very‐long‐chain (VLC) acyl‐CoAs by ER‐associated
  multienzyme fatty acyl‐CoA elongase (FAE) complexes. The VLC‐acyl‐CoAs are converted
  to VLC‐alkanes (C29 and C31) by the alkane‐forming complex formed by CER1, CER3
  and CYTB5s from P. cablin. The dashed arrow represents proposed steps remaining
  to be elucidated in this study. Enzymes catalysing each step are indicated in blue.
