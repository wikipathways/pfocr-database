caption: 'Oxygen-dependent transcriptional regulation of HIFs. Under normoxic conditions,
  HIF-α protein is continually transcribed and rapidly degraded owing to the posttranslational
  hydroxylation of highly conserved proline residues by PHDs. Oxygen, Fe2+, and α-KG
  are substrates in this reaction. HIF-α, with hydroxyl group tags, subsequently interacts
  with the Von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex for degradation
  via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Under hypoxia, the activities of factor inhibiting
  HIFs (FIHs) and PHDs are suppressed, and thus HIF-α is stabilized and translocated
  into the nucleus to bind with HIF-β. Inhibition of PHDs and activation of p38 MAPK
  mediated by ROS are involved in HIF-α stabilization. With the help of transcriptional
  coactivators such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein
  (CBP) and acetyltransferase (p300), the resultant heterodimeric HIF-α/β dimer binds
  to HREs and transcriptionally activates the targeted genes involved in malignant
  phenotypes and protumor mechanisms of PC. Abbreviations: Asn, asparagine; Pro, proline'
