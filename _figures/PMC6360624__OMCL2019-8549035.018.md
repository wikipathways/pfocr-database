caption: 'The action mechanism of GSPE on oxidative stress induced by arsenic and
  methylation of arsenic. Arsenic can cause oxidative injuries by reducing the activity
  of antioxidative enzymes and increasing the amount of peroxide products. GSPE contains
  many phenolic hydroxyl groups and release H+, which can bind active oxygen radicals
  and competitively block the reaction chains of free radicals, reducing the consumption
  of antioxidants and increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes. In addition,
  GSPE promotes the dissociation of Nrf2 and Keap1 proteins, allowing Nrf2 to enter
  the nucleus from the cytoplasm, thus promoting the expression of downstream genes
  of Nrf2 and increasing the antioxidant capacity. The Nrf2 pathway activation increases
  the level of GSH, which promotes the methylation of arsenic (arrows: promotion;
  blunt arrows: inhibition).'
