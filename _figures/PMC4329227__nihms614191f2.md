caption: 'By transcriptional upregulation of TIGAR, p53 increases the flux of glucose
  to the PPP. By contrast, p53 was shown to inhibit G6PDH activity through protein-protein
  interaction. Oxidation and glycosylation, two post-translational modifications,
  inhibit the glycolytic enzymes PKM2 and PFK1, respectively, and re-route the glycolytic
  flux towards oxidative PPP. ATM, Ras, PI3K/Akt and Src positively influence G6PDH
  activity through several mechanisms. In addition, several oncoproteins modulate
  the PPP by transcriptional up-regulation of several enzymes that affect the PPP
  directly or indirectly (Inset) (Transcriptional regulations are showed by red arrows.
