caption: Mechanisms by which natural products ameliorate renal fibrosis. Fibrotic
  progression is driven by the interplay of multiple signaling pathways. The TGF-β/Smad
  pathway is initiated when TGF-β binds to TβRI and TβRII receptors, leading to the
  phosphorylation of Smad2/3. These molecules form a complex with Smad4, which translocates
  to the nucleus to regulate fibrogenic gene expression. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
  is activated by upstream signals such as CD28, resulting in the phosphorylation
  of PIP3 and Akt, which subsequently activate mTOR and Erk1/2, promoting fibrosis.
  The AMPK pathway mitigates fibrosis by enhancing autophagy, regulating oxidative
  stress through Sirt1 and SOD2 activation, and promoting apoptosis via Beclin-1.
  In the JAK/STAT6 pathway, IL-4 binding to cell surface receptors activates JAK1/3
  kinases, leading to STAT6 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, where it regulates
  target gene transcription. The cGAS/STING pathway mediates DNA-induced immune responses;
  cGAS recognizes cytosolic DNA and synthesizes cGAMP, which activates STING and downstream
  IRF3/7 and NF-κB pathways, inducing type I interferons (IFN-I) and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (e.g., CCL4, TNF-α, IL-1β). Additionally, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, when
  activated, stabilizes β-catenin, allowing its nuclear translocation to regulate
  genes involved in fibrosis. Natural products attenuate renal fibrosis by targeting
  these pathways, modulating inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy
