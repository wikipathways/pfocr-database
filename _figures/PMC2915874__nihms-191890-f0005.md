caption: Effect of estrogen on the mechanisms of VSM contraction. An agonist (A) activates
  a specific receptor (R), stimulates membrane phospholipase (PLC), and increases
  the production of IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 stimulates Ca2+ release from
  the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Also, the agonist stimulates Ca2+ entry through
  Ca+2 channels. Ca2+ binds CAM, activates myosin light chain (MLC) kinase, causes
  MLC phosphorylation, and initiates VSM contraction. DAG causes activation of PKC.
  PKC phosphorylates calponin (CaP) and/or activate a protein kinase cascade involving
  Raf, MAPK kinase (MEK), and MAPK, leading to phosphorylation of caldesmon (CaD)
  and an increase in the myofilament force sensitivity to Ca2+. Estrogen binds to
  plasma membrane ER, leading to inhibition of agonist-activated mechanisms of VSM
  contraction. Possible nongenomic effects of estrogen include activation of K+ channels,
  leading to membrane hyperpolarization, inhibition of Ca2+ entry through Ca2+ channels,
  and thereby inhibition of Ca2+-dependent MLC phosphorylation and VSM contraction.
  Estrogen may also inhibit PKC and/or the MAPK pathway through activation of plasma
  membrane ERs and thereby further inhibit VSM contraction. Estrogen-induced NO release
  from the endothelium activates guanylate cyclase in VSM leading to increased cGMP
  and stimulation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). PKG decreases [Ca2+]i by
  stimulating Ca2+ extrusion pumps in the plasma membrane and Ca+2 uptake pumps in
  the sarcoplasmic reticulum and/or decrease the sensitivity of the contractile myofilaments
  to [Ca2+]i and thereby promote VSM relaxation. Estrogen also induces the release
  of PGI2 from the endothelium to activate the PGI2-cAMP pathway, or EDHF to activate
  Ca2+-activated K+ channels and to cause hyperpolarization and relaxation of VSM.
