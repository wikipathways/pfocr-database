caption: 'Metabolic plasticity in melanoma. In normal melanocyte, the energetic metabolism,
  in the presence of oxygen (O2), starts from the consumption of glucose via glycolysis
  to the final production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) mainly via oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS). During the development of the tumor, the metabolic pathways drastically
  change. In melanoma cells, the BRAF-mutated oncogenic pathway, leading to the over-activation
  of MAPK, sustains mainly aerobic glycolysis/Warburg phenotype with secretion of
  lactate. Inhibition of MAPK pathway decreases glycolysis, leading to a dependence
  on mitochondrial metabolism with increased production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). This phenotype switch is a metabolic adaptation mechanism developed by cells
  to survive under drug’s pressure and is a common feature of melanoma cells resistant
  to targeted-therapy. Intrinsic (mutations, intracellular pathways) and extrinsic
  factors (nutrients, O2 levels, acidity, and soluble factors) can contribute to increase
  the metabolic plasticity of melanoma cells selecting subclones with a different
  metabolic phenotype. The progressive metabolic reprogramming in melanoma is accompanied
  by a drastic increase in tumor aggressiveness. +: positive regulation; −: negative
  regulation.'
