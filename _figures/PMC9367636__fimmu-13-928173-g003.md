caption: Mechanism of action of the immunosuppressants commonly used in xenotransplantation.
  GCs exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting macrophages,
  eosinophils, T cells, and to a lesser extent, B cells, by binding to GC receptors
  in cytoplasm. Cyclosporin binds to cyclophilin, then this drug-immunophilin complex
  binds to calcineurin, which subsequently prevents Th cell activation and IL-2 production,
  which eventually inhibits T cell clonal proliferation. Tacrolimus inhibits T cells
  proliferation by binding to FKBP, which inhibits several transcription factors involved
  in the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Cyclophosphamide blocks DNA alkylation
  in various cell types, leading to programmed cell death induction and preventing
  cell division. Leflunomide inhibits the synthesis of pyrimidines, thus arresting
  cell cycle in S phase. Mycophenolate mofetil prevents T and B cell proliferation
  by specifically inhibiting a purine pathway required for lymphocyte division. Polyclonal
  anti-thymocyte globulins are mainly directed against T cells. However, other immune
  cells sharing common surface antigens with T cells can also be affected to a lesser
  extent. Monoclonal antibodies target specific cytokine pathways (e.g., IL-6Rα) or
  cell surface markers, such as CD3, for anti-C3 IT, or CD20, for rituximab. The IL-6
  receptor inhibitor tocilizumab reduces systemic inflammation and inhibits of CD8+
  T cell and B cell differentiation. Anti-CD3 IT can deplete CD3+ T cells transiently
  and reduces the number of T cells in circulation and in lymph nodes. Rituximab is
  a B cell-depleting drug that targets CD20. Rapamycin exerts immunosuppressive and
  anti-proliferative effects of T cells by inhibiting the activation of S6K1 and PI3
  kinase signalling. CTLA-4Ig and anti-CD40mAb target the costimulatory pathways CD80/86:CD28
  and CD154:CD40, respectively, thereby dampening T cell activation. The compstatin
  analogue Cp40 and Tesidolumab inhibits complement C3 and C5 respectively, thereby
  reducing complement activities. FKBP, FK506 binding protein; GCs, glucocorticoids;
  IT, immunotoxin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MMF, mycophenolate mofetil, pECs, porcine
  endothelial cells.
