caption: Schema of the anti-HIV mechanism of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling
  of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Stimulation of IECs with double-stranded
  RNA (Poly I:C) activates TLR3 pathway, which facilitates phosphorylation and translocation
  of IRF3 and IRF7, initiating the transcription of interferon (IFN)-β, IFN-λ, and
  CC chemokine and releasing exosomes in the IECs. CC chemokines bind to HIV entry
  co-receptor CCR5 and block HIV entry. In addition, IFN-β and IFN-λ released from
  IECs can bind to their receptors in macrophages, inducing anti-HIV IFN-stimulated
  genes (ISGs) (ISG15, ISG56, MxA, MxB, OAS-1, OAS-2, GPB5, Tetherin, and APOBEC3G/3F),
  and exosome delivery of ISGs and miRNA to HIV-infected macrophages, which inhibit
  HIV at different steps of viral replication.
