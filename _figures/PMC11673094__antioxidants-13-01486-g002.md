caption: Targeting to attenuate the programmed cell death is illustrated and summarized.
  Salvianolic acid B (SAB) upregulates the expression of Sirt-1 to reduce apoptosis
  through the BCL-2 pathway. Honokiol suppressed PTX3 expression through the NF-kB
  pathway to attenuate apoptosis. Dihydromyricetin (DHM) enhances the Nrf-2 signaling
  pathway to reduce ROS production, subsequently inhibiting NLRP3-related pyroptosis.
  Clopidogrel inhibited long non-coding RNA HIF1A-AS1 to reduce apoptosis by BCL-2/caspase-9/caspase-3
  pathway. Isopropyl 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxypropionate (IDHP) reduced ROS
  to decrease intracellular ferrous ion levels, which are involved in ferroptosis;
  meanwhile, IDHP promoted xCT/SLC7A11 expression to suppress ferroptosis of endothelial
  cells
