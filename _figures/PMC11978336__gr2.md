caption: Pathway whereby ceramides promote atherosclerosis (AS) development① Tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF)-α stimulates ceramide formation by activating neutral and
  acidic sphingomyelinase, and C2-ceramide, in turn, stimulates the expression of
  TNF-α by venous endothelial cells. TNF-α and ceramide may form a vicious cycle;
  ② ceramides exacerbate AS lesions by increasing cholesterol levels by downregulating
  the expression of the cholesterol elimination genes Cyp7a1, Abcg5, and Abcg8; ③
  promoting foam cell formation by inhibiting macrophage digestion of oxidized low-density
  lipoprotein (ox-LDL), exacerbating AS; ④ by promoting trans-intimal transport of
  ox-LDL, ox-LDL is retained in the vascular endothelium, exacerbating AS; ⑤ by promoting
  the production of interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), it exerts a pro-inflammatory
  effect and aggravates AS
