caption: 'Top left: Wnt binds to the Frizzled receptor (Fz) and the LRP5/6 co-receptor.
  LRP5/6 and Fz deactivate the β-catenin destruction complex, which leads to accumulation
  of β-catenin. β-catenin translocates into the nucleus, where it regulates transcription
  of Wnt target genes with TCF/LEF. Sclerostin inhibits binding of Wnt to LRP5/6.
  PTH binds to LRP6 and causes an Wnt-independent deactivation of the β-catenin destruction
  complex. bottom: Wnt promotes the osteoblastic lineage and inhibits osteoclastogenesis
  and apoptosis. BMP is a strong promoter of osteoblastic differentiation. PTH acts
  through the PTH1R receptor in the osteoblastic lineage and has an inhibiting effect
  on sclerostin expression. APT and TPT work through selective activation of PTH1R
  activation. ROMO binds sclerostin. DENO binds RANKL and prevents RANK activation.
