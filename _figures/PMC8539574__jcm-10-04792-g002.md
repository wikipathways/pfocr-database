caption: 'The Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) and dynamic interplay between
  O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate. Once in the cells, glucose is enzymatically metabolized
  by Hexokinase (HK) to Glucose-6-Phosphate (Glc-6-P), which is then converted by
  Glc-6-P isomerase (GPI) into Glc-6-P to Fructose-6-phosphate (Fruc-6-P). About 3–5%
  of Fruc-6-P is metabolized to Glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) by Glutamine Fructose-6-phosphate
  AmidoTransferase (GFAT). Glucosamine-6-Phosphate N-Acetyltransferase 1 (GNPNAT1)
  utilizes acetyl-CoA to convert GlcN-6-P into N-Acetylglucosamine-6-Phosphate (GlcNAc-6-P),
  which is then converted by Phospho-Acetyl Glucosamine Mutase 1 (AGM1) into N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate
  (GlcNAc-1-P). By utilizing Uridine Triphosphate (UTP), UDP-N-Acetylglucosamine Pyrophosphorylase
  (UAP) converts GlcNAc-1-P to Uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc).
  O-GlcNac modification and phosphorylation are reciprocal events because the site
  of attachment is the same or is adjacent to Ser/Thr residues. Two highly conserved
  enzymes mediate the addition and removal of the UDP-GlcNAc: OGlcNAc transferase
  (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), respectively.'
