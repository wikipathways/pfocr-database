caption: Schematic model of RELMα mediated mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction.
  Rodent isoform of resistin RELMα, also known as hypoxia induced mitogenic factor
  (HIMF), attenuates adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-linked OCR, fatty acid oxidation
  (FAO) and partially increases glycolytic oxidation as compensatory mechanism in
  NRCMs. Mechanistically, RELMα attenuates PGC1α/PPARα/ERRα signaling axis which leads
  to down regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis genes (TFAM, TOP1MT, POLG2, and POLRMT),
  FAO metabolic genes (LCAD, VLCAD, ACADM, ACADS) as well as mitochondrial fatty acid
  (FA) transporter genes (Cpt-1a, Cpt-1b). Etomoxir (inhibitor of long chain FA) also
  limits FA availability to mitochondria, thus, less FAO (β-oxidation) further limits
  Acetyl-CoA production (substrate for TCA cycle). Slowdown of TCA cycle also impairs
  reduced NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) i.e., NADH production utilized by
  oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway for ATP production through electron transport
  chain. RELMα partially increases glycolytic oxidation and increases pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase (PDK-1, 4) gene expression which also inhibits conversion of pyruvate to
  acetyl-CoA for TCA cycle. Persistent decrease in FAO and ATP-linked OCR leads to
  mitochondrial dysfunction which affects cardiac bioenergetics, thus, cardiac dysfunction.
