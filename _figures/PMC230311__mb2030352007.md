caption: Degradation of c-Fos in asynchronous cells and cells undergoing a G0/G1transition.
  c-Fos shows unusual properties with regard to its destruction. First, in spite of
  being a ubiquitinylatable protein in vivo, its prior ubiquitinylation is dispensable
  for proteasomal degradation. Second, it possesses at least two destabilizing elements
  which are used differently depending on the situation. One destabilizer (C-dest.)
  is located within the C-terminal part of the protein. It constitutes the only active
  destabilizer of c-Fos in asynchronous cells. It is also active during the G0/G1transition,
  although phosphorylation of serines 362 and 374 limits its activity. It does not
  necessitate an active ubiquitin pathway for functioning in asynchronous or in serum-stimulated
  cells. The other destabilizer (N-dest.) is located at the N terminus of the molecule.
  It is conditionally active during the G0/G1transition, and its activity is dependent
  on a functional ubiquitin cycle, presumably through ubiquitinylation of an upstream
  effector of c-Fos degradation. Discontinuous lines indicate that the precise limits
  of the N- and C-terminal destabilizers are not known. In G0/G1, c-Fos molecules
  are probably recognized via either the C or N terminus. Whether cooperation between
  N- and C-terminal destabilizers occurs after recognition for further processing
  of c-Fos by the proteasome cannot be ruled out. Discontinuous arrows indicate that
  upstream effectors are (N-terminal destabilizer-mediated degradation) or may be
  (C-terminal destabilizer-mediated degradation) involved in c-Fos being addressed
  to the proteasome.
