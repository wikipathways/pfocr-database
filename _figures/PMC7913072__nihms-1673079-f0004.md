caption: a | Myofibroblast activation is jointly promoted by biomechanical and biochemical
  cues. Biomechanical signalling induced by extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness activates
  mechanotransduction pathways that directly control α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)
  transcription. These pathways involve β1 integrin, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and
  RHO-associated protein kinase (ROCK), together with increasing traction forces in
  fibroblasts. Increased actomyosin activity causes the nuclear translocation of myocardin-related
  transcription factor (MRTF), as well as the transcriptional co-activators yes-associated
  protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), which
  regulate α-SMA expression by binding and activating other transcription factors,
  such as serum response factor (SRF), TEA domain family member (TEAD), T cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) and β-catenin. ECM stiffness and mechanical forces
  also regulate force-dependent activation of latent transforming growth factor-β1
  (TGFβ1) by increasing resistance to traction forces generated by fibroblasts. In
  this mechanism, extracellular latent TGFβ1 (TGFβ1 with its latency-associated peptide
  (L AP)) is released from latent TGFβ1 binding protein stores when αv integrins respond
  to mechanical pulling forces. Once activated, TGFβ1 binds to TGFβ receptors and
  promotes canonical mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (SMAD3) activation.
  Activated SMAD3 binds to SMAD4 and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to
  SMAD-binding elements in the promoters of fibrogenic genes, such as ACTA2 (encoding
  α-SMA). Together, myofibroblast activation is controlled by both the TGFβ–SMAD pathway,
  as well as biomechanical pathways such as integrin–FAK–ROCK–MRTF–YAP–TAZ signalling.
  b | Mitochondria in activated myofibroblasts contain large amounts of pro-apoptotic
  factors, which force these cells to activate pro-survival mechanisms to ensure survival.
  The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is directly inhibited by TGFβ1 via activation
  of ABL signalling, which increases the amount of the pro-survival proteins BCL-2
  and BCL-XL. TGFβ1 also blocks the intrinsic pathway by inhibiting the pro-apoptotic
  protein BCL-2-associated death promoter (BAD) via the FAK–PI3K–AKT signalling pathway,
  and TGFβ1-mediated FAK signalling blocks the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis by inhibiting
  sphingomyelinase (ASMase), an enzyme that controls FAS-mediated apoptosis by generating
  ceramide from sphingomyelin. Biomechanical signalling similarly inhibits the intrinsic
  pathway via the biomechanically regulated TGFβ–FAK–YAP1–TAZ–BCL-XL and TGFβ–ROCK–MRTF–BCL-2
  pathways. Moreover, ECM stiffness induces expression of the microRNAs miR-21 and
  miR-29a, which promote the survival of myofibroblasts by increasing the expression
  of pro-survival BCL-2 proteins. Both ECM stiffness and TGFβ1 can also block apoptosis
  by increasing amounts of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), a direct
  caspase inhibitor. AKT, pro-survival protein kinase B; BAK, BCL-2 homologous antagonist/killer;
  BAX, BCL-associated X protein; BID, BH3-interacting domain death agonist; BIM, BCL-2-interacting
  mediator of cell death (also known as BCL2L11); PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
  TGFβRII, transforming growth factor-β receptor II.
