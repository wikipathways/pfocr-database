caption: Miniprotein involvement in major cancer signaling pathways. Miniproteins
  can suppress or promote pro‐oncogenic signaling pathways in diverse manners. At
  the plasma membrane, AKT3‐174aa—encoded by a circular RNA isoform of AKT3—competes
  with p‐PDK‐1 to inhibit AKT activation. Consistent with this tumor‐suppressive function,
  circAKT3 is downregulated in glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Xia et al., ). Also overexpressed
  in GBM, C‐E‐Cad is a secreted miniprotein encoded by a circular isoform of E‐cadherin
  that binds the CR2 domain of EGFR to activate it (Gao et al., ). The 59aa SMIM30
  miniprotein mediates the SRC/YES1 complex anchoring to the cytoplasmic surface of
  the plasma membrane. SRC/YES1 membrane‐anchoring enables phosphorylation and subsequent
  activation of the complex, which induces downstream MAPK signaling (Pang et al., ).
  SMIM30 is regulated by c‐MYC and overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma. In the
  cytoplasm, the tumor‐suppressive FBXW7‐185aa promotes c‐myc degradation by suppressing
  USP28 inhibition of the canonical FBXW7 protein (Yeh et al., ). Further, CIP2A‐BP
  competes with PP2A for binding to CIP2A (Guo et al., ) which prevents CIP2A stabilization,
  thereby inhibiting downstream AKT/NFkB pathway activation. Localized to the lysosome,
  the lncRNA‐encoded SPAR miniprotein interacts with v‐ATPase to prevent mTORC1 recruitment
  to the complex, attenuating growth‐factor‐independent mTORC1 activation (Matsumoto
  et al., ). Nuclear‐localized miniproteins are implicated in transcriptional regulation.
  For instance, SEHBP tightly binds histone H2B and interacts with scaffolding proteins
  that modulate chromatin accessibility, strongly suggesting a role in transcriptional
  regulation (Koh et al., ). Figure created with biorender.com.
