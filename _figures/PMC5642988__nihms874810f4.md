caption: In normal homeostasis, the Hippo pathway is constitutively active to keep
  YAP1 activity at low levels. Mice lacking YAP1 in intestinal epithelial cells (Villin-YAPf/f
  mice) have no observable phenotype. During tissue regeneration induced by damage
  caused by DSS, YAP1 is activated by gp130 signalling to stimulate cell proliferation.
  Mice with Yap1 deficiency in intestinal epithelial cells have higher mortality and
  greater loss of crypt compartments than wild-type mice. Whole-body irradiation of
  mice causes YAP1 activation, which transiently inhibits Wnt and stimulates EGFR
  signalling to promote regeneration. Loss of YAP1 in intestinal epithelial cells
  leads to Wnt hyperactivation, impairing crypt regeneration shortly after injury
  but inducing tissue hyperplasia in the long term. DSS, dextran sulfate sodium; EGFR,
  epidermal growth factor receptor; gp130, interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta; SAV1,
  salvador family WW domain-containing protein 1; SFK, Src family kinases; YAP1, Yes-associated
  protein 1.
