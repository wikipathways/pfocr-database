caption: 'Purinergic signaling cascade: Intracellular ATP is externalized by the PNX1
  channel and activates P2 receptors. P2Rs are divided into two major categories:
  P2X1-7 and P2Y1,2,4,6,11–14. ATP is hydrolyzed by E-NTPDase1/CD39 to ADP, which
  also binds to P2YR and is further hydrolyzed by CD39 to AMP. AMP is also formed
  through an alternative pathway that involves the enzymes NAD+-glycohydrolase/CD38,
  which converts NAD+ to ADP-ribose, and NPP1/CD203a, which metabolizes ADP-ribose
  to AMP. Once AMP is formed by the canonical and/or non-canonical pathway, it is
  hydrolyzed by ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 to ADO, thus connecting both adenosinergic
  pathways. ADO binds to the P1 receptors, which are divided into A1, A2A, A2B and
  A3, each with different ligand affinities. ADO is internalized into the cell through
  ENTs or CNTs and/or it is deaminated to INO by ADA. Abbreviations: ATP (adenosine
  triphosphate); ADP (adenosine diphosphate); AMP (adenosine monophosphate); ADO (adenosine);
  INO (inosine); NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide); PNX1 (Pannexin-1); P2X
  (ionotropic purinergic receptors); P2Y (metabotropic purinergic receptors); P1 (adenosine
  metabotropic receptors); E-NTPDase1/CD39 (ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase
  1); ENTs (nucleoside equilibrative transporters); CNTs (concentrative nucleoside
  transporters); ADA (adenosine deaminase).'
