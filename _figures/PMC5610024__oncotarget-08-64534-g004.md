caption: (A) Inhibitors of HMGB1 protein. Extracellular HMGB1 can be blocked by administration
  of anti-HMGB1 antibodies (binds to HMGB1), HMGB1 box A (antagonizes the B box functional
  activity of HMGB1), and glycyrrhizin (binds to HMGB1). (B) Targeting receptors.
  Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) acts as a decoy to block HMGB1-RAGE signaling pathway. (C)
  Inhibition of HMGB1 secretion. The secretion of HMGB1 can be inhibited by ethyl
  pyruvate, glycyrrhizin and other agents (such as quercetin and nicotine).
