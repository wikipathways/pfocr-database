caption: 'Correlation between stress-mediated inflammation and major depression. This
  figure illustrates the complex interplay between stress-mediated inflammation and
  major depression (MDD). DEGs: Represents sex-specific differences in gene expression
  related to MDD, highlighting variations between males and females. Regions: Denotes
  specific genetic variations and their associations with MDD, as discussed in the
  text. Pathways: Represents the biological pathways implicated in MDD, including
  those involved in stress and inflammation. Center: Depicts the phenotypic manifestations
  of MDD, such as sleep disturbances, low mood, and other behavioral and psychological
  symptoms'
