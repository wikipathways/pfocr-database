caption: Metformin's effects on melanoma cells. Metformin induces melanoma cell death
  by both AMPK-dependent and -independent pathways. By an unknown mechanism, metformin
  induces cell cycle arrest in melanoma cells, which is responsible for the activation
  of autophagy, and in turn, for the activation of apoptosis, leading to melanoma
  cell death. In initiating melanoma cells, metformin decreased cell transformation
  and proliferation by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway and the inflammatory pathway.
