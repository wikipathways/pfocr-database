caption: Hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis pathway gene expression is globally overexpressed
  in the Chga knockout mouse. Hepatic expression patterns of genes involved in cholesterol
  biosynthesis were mapped onto a biochemical pathway diagram with GenMAPP. The statistically
  significant and global overexpression of the pathway, including 1.56-fold overexpression
  of HMG-CoA reductase (Hmgcr), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis,
  suggests an increase in de novo cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver of the Chga
  knockout mouse. Genes overexpressed in the Chga knockout are colored red, genes
  underexpressed in the Chga knockout are colored blue, genes lacking a statistically
  significant change are colored gray, and genes without expression data (i.e., the
  gene lacked a probe on the microarray) are shown in white. Numbers adjacent to genes
  indicate the fold change of differential expression. A positive number indicates
  a gene that is overexpressed in the knockout (Chga KO mean signal/wild-type mean
  signal), and a negative number refers to a gene that is underexpressed in the knockout
  (−wild-type mean signal/Chga KO mean signal).
