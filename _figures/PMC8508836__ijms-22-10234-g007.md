caption: Expected pathway of calcium-mediated SMN splicing regulation. BFA, thapsigargin
  (TG) and calcium ionophore commonly increase the cytosolic calcium concentration,
  which is critical for the rescue of the SMN2 exon 7 splicing defect. In this pathway,
  CaMK4 may relay the stimulatory signal of the calcium to splicing factors, such
  as hnRNP M, PSF, Tra2-β and hnRNP A1, and consequently promote exon 7 inclusion
  in SMN splicing (black fold in the bottom). Thin and short arrows (upward and downward)
  indicate the increase or the decrease of RNA-binding or protein amount of trans-acting
  factors. The numbers (6, 7, and 8) indicate exon 6, 7, and 8 of SMN2 pre-mRNA, respectively.
