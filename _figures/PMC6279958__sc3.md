caption: Schematic representation of the synthesis pathway of riboflavin (adapted
  from  in Sung, Lee, J. Photosci., []). Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is converted
  to 2,5-diamino-6-(5′-phosphoribosylamino)-4-pyrimidineone (DAPO) by RibA, which
  is further converted in three steps to 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil (APDO).
  Another route starts from ribulose 5-phosphate, which is converted to 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone
  4-phosphate (DHBP) by RibB. The enzyme RibH produces the product 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine
  (lumazine) from DHBP and APDO. Lumazine is converted to riboflavin by RibE, which
  is subsequently transformed into flavin mononucleotide (FMN) by a riboflavin kinase.
