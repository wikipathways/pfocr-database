caption: 'Apoptosis pathways affected by rocaglamides. Apoptotic cell death is regulated
  by two main pathways: extrinsic (receptor-mediated) and intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated)
  pathways. The extrinsic pathway involves ligation of death receptors (e.g. CD95
  and TRAIL-R) with their ligands (e.g. CD95L and TRAIL) resulting in a sequential
  activation of caspase-8 and -3, which cleave target proteins leading to apoptosis.
  This pathway is negatively regulated by the anti-apoptotic protein c-FLIP. Intrinsic
  stimuli (e.g. anticancer drugs) directly or indirectly activate the mitochondrial
  pathway by inducing release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9,
  in turn, activates caspase-3. This death pathway is largely controlled by the pro-apoptotic
  (e.g. Bax and Bak) and anti-apoptotic (e.g. Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) proteins. Activated
  caspase-8 may induce cleavage of Bid, which induces translocation of Bax and/or
  Bak to the mitochondrial membrane and amplifies the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.
  Bid cleavage can be also induced by activated p38 and JNK. Several rocaglamides
  can activate p38 and JNK leading to Bid cleavage. Rocaglamides can also directly
  inhibit protein synthesis by interfering with eIF4A (see ) or indirectly through
  inhibition of the MEK-ERK-eIF4E pathway. Protein synthesis inhibition will lead
  to down-regulation of short-lived anti-apoptotic proteins such as c-FLIP and Mcl-1.
  Furthermore, rocaglamides may further increase T-cell-receptor (TCR)-mediated activation
  of p38 and JNK leading to down-regulation of NF-AT activity and up-regulation of
  AP-1 activity. This event results in up-regulation of CD95L promoter activity and
  suppression of c-FLIP promoter activity leading to enhancing activation-induced-cell-death'
