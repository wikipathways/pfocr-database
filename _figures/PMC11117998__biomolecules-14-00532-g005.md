caption: 'Diagram of the integrated metabolic pathways of the 14 differential metabolites
  in myocardial infarction discovered from this study. The metabolic pathway integration
  map contains 11 metabolic pathways of 13 differential metabolites (metabolic pathway
  of ferulic acid related biological system was not found in the database), including
  the following 10 modified KEGG maps: “hsa00470 D-Amino acid metabolism”, “hsa00020
  Citrate cycle (TCA cycle)”, “hsa00061 Fatty acid biosynthesis”, “hsa00250 Alanine,
  aspartate, and glutamate metabolism”, “hsa00260 Glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism”,
  “hsa01100 Metabolic pathways”, “hsa01040 Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids”,
  “hsa01212 Fatty acid metabolism”, “hsa00564 Glycerophospholipid metabolism”, “hsa00590
  Arachidonic acid metabolism” and 1 pathway obtained from the literature review,
  “Microbial metabolism of tyrosine. (Dots represent metabolites, red is upregulated
  and blue is downregulated. The line represents the metabolic pathway, the straight
  line is quoted by KEGG, and the dotted line is quoted by literature review)'
