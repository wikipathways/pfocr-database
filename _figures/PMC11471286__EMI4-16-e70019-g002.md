caption: Interactions of acidophilic sulphate‐reducing bacteria (aSRB) with different
  microbial groups. (1) Heterotrophic bacteria (HB) metabolize acetate that is released
  after lactate/glycerol oxidation of aSRB, thus decreasing its concentration. In
  return, the former bacteria produce H2, which is a suitable electron donor for aSRB.
  (2) Sulphur‐oxidizing bacteria (SOB) oxidize H2S with O2, thus generating sulphate
  and low O2 conditions that are suitable for the development and activity of aSRB.
  (3) aSRB could develop a collaborative behaviour with methanogenic archaea (MA).
  The former bacteria produce acetate after incomplete ethanol oxidation, which is
  a suitable carbon source for MA. (4) Anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) transfer
  electrons from methane oxidation to aSRB for sulphate reduction. (5) Biodegradation
  of complex organic matter could be performed in a direct and indirect way; the former
  requires that aSRB have the metabolic pathway for polymeric material degradation
  and the latter involves a multi‐step process carried out by other microbial guilds
  such as acidophilic lignocellulose‐degrading bacteria (aLDB). (6) Acidophilic Fe(III)‐reducing
  bacteria (aFeRB) and aSRB could compete for specific carbon sources and Fe3+ as
  terminal electron acceptor. MA and aSRB can compete for electron donors (e.g. H2)
  under high sulphate conditions. Interactions 1, 3, 5, and 6 were corroborated by
  culture experiments and interactions 2 and 4 by molecular‐based data (Created with
