caption: Role of GDE3 in 2-AG synthesis and as a switch between GPR55 and the cannabinoid
  receptor. A, the three major phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol (PI), PI 4-phosphate
  (PIP), and PI-bisphosphate are in permanent interconversion through four steps of
  phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. The canonical pathway of 2-AG synthesis involves
  PIP2 cleavage by PLCβ, followed by removal of stearic acid from the sn-1 position
  of diacylglycerol (DAG) by DAG lipase α (DAGLα). The alternative pathway requires
  PI hydrolysis by a phospholipase A1 (PLA1), either DDHD1 for an intracellular reaction
  or an extracellular lipase. GDE3 then produces 2-AG from the 2-arachidonoyl LPI
  species. B, as shown by data from , GDE3 is able to convert GPR55 signaling evoked
  by LPI into CB2 activation by 2-AG. The three proteins are not represented in the
  same membrane because the depicted exchanges might involve membranes from the same
  or from neighboring cells. Although not shown in this study, CB1 could also be emphasized
  in the switching event.
