caption: Late signaling events in de novo cytokine/chemokine production. Stimulation
  of different membrane receptors lead to the activation of transcription factors,
  modulators of mRNA turnover, and effectors of ribosome activity that provoke long-lasting
  secretion of lymphokines in mast cells. After FcεRI triggering with IgE/antigen
  (Ag) complexes, Lyn and Fyn tyrosine kinases become activated and phosphorylate
  ITAMs from β and γ chains of the receptor. Further activation of Syk kinase leads
  to the phosphorylation of a number of adapters (such as LAT and NTAL) and enzymes
  (such as BTK and PLCγ). Enzymes and adapters form different macromolecular aggregates
  leading to the activation of different signaling pathways. PLCγ activation is connected
  with PKCα/β-dependent events through the generation of DAG and IP3. PKCα/β connect
  FcεRI triggering with IKK activation and IκB degradation, leading to nuclear translocation
  of NFκB. IP3-sensitive calcium release from intracellular stores lead to the activation
  of a store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). IgE/Ag stimulation initiates also a receptor-operated
  Ca2+ entry (ROCE). Calcium increase allows calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation
  and nuclear translocation of NFAT. On the other hand, Fyn-PI3K pathway leads to
  the activation of IKK and NFκB-dependent transcription but also triggers AKT, which
  controls mTor kinase and the initiation of protein translation by S6K and 4E-BP1.
  Activation of MAPK provokes the activation of AP-1 transcription factor but also
  modifies cytokine mRNA turnover through the modulation of mRNA-binding proteins
  such as HUR and Tristetraprolin (TTP). Binding of monomeric IgE to FcεRI induces
  mTor-dependent changes on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation leading to modifications on cap-dependent
  protein translation. Stimulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) leads to NFκB-mediated
  transcription by the MyD88/Mal-dependent pathway, which renders IKK activation after
  the TRAF-6/TAK1 axis. IKK, either activated by FcεRI or TLR4 receptors, phosphorylates
  SNAP-23 facilitating secretion. Also, IKK triggering (together with some calcium-dependent
  signals) modulates HIF1-α-dependent transcription. Once translated, cytokines and
  angiogenic factors are secreted for variable periods of time utilizing specific
  vesicle carriers. See text for details.
