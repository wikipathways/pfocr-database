caption: Ligation of PD-1 with its ligands results in recruitment of SHPs to the phosphorylated
  ITSM domain where they become functionally active. ZAP70 associates with the CD3-zeta
  chain and PI3K associates with the CD28 cytoplasmic tail upon TCR stimulation and
  CD28 ligation. ZAP70 is an adaptor protein that recruits and stabilizes a kinase
  complex to initiate the ERK/MAPK pathway. PI3K serves as the initial kinase in the
  AKT pathway. Active SHP-1/2 dephosphorylate ZAP70 and PI3K; thus, inhibiting these
  kinase pathways and preventing T cell activity, proper metabolic activity, T cell
  survival, and proliferation.
