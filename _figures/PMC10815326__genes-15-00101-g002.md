caption: Merged network of IFN-γ- and IFN-α-responsive DEGs involved in microglial
  activation, anti-viral response, activation of T-lymphocytes, and chemotaxis of
  T-lymphocytes. (A,C) Interferon-mediated neuroinflammation pathways display lower
  levels in the cerebral cortex (CTX) when compared to the cerebellum (CRB), both
  in Npc1−/− (A) and wildtype mice (C). (B,D) The same pathways were upregulated in
  Npc1−/− mice, both in cerebellum, and cerebral cortex (D), indicating that, while
  pathway activation differences in these tissues are not disease-specific, they are
  upregulated in both tissues in NPC
