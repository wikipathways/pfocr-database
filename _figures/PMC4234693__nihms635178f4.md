caption: Influence of non-canonical Wnt signals on the MAPK pathway. In mouse F9 teratocarcinoma
  embryonal cells, a strong activation of p38 MAPK was observed in response to Wnt5a
  and treatment with SB203580 effectively abolished the ability of Wnt5a’s stimulatory
  effects (). Wnt5a was also found to promote ERK1/2 phosphorylation, enhancing endothelial
  cell survival and proliferation (), and the expression of Wnt5a blocked canonical
  Wnt signaling in endothelial cells () and other cell types (). However, non-canonical
  Wnt signaling more commonly functions through the Wnt-JNK pathway. Activation of
  Wnt5a signaling by IL-1β induced the expression of MMPs via the JNK pathway in rabbit
  temporomandibular joint (TMJ) condylar chondrocytes, whereas blockage of JNK signaling
  impaired the Wnt5a-induced up-regulation of MMPs (). Wnt5a increased chondrocyte
  differentiation at an early stage through CaMK/NFAT-dependent induction of Sox9
  while repressing chondrocyte hypertrophy via NF-κB-dependent inhibition of Runx2
  expression (). Wnt5b activated JNK, a component of the planar cell polarity pathway,
  contributed to an increase in cellular migration while Wnt5b also decreased cell-cell
  adhesion through an activation of Src and subsequent cadherin receptor turnover
  ().
