caption: Common signaling pathways of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition based on
  Albrecht et al. []. Snail and Slug regulate “cadherin switch” by downregulating
  E-cadherin (E-cad) and inducing the expression of mesenchymal neuronal-cadherin
  (N-cad). Signaling pathways such as Wnt and TGF-β activate SNAIL and SLUG. N-cad
  stimulates cell proliferation through mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.
  The loss of E-cad can also result in the mislocalization of α-catenin and p120 catenin,
  which leads to the activation of MAPK pathways. Somatic mutations of E-cad leading
  to its downregulation disrupt normal signaling to Rho GTPases (Rac1 and RhoA), which
  leads to tumor cell migration and invasion. Upregulated placental-cadherin (P-cad)
  induces the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling pathway, which
  also leads to Rho GTPase signaling that promotes migration and invasion.
