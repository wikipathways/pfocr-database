caption: Schematic representation of the interactions involved in the alteration of
  DC function following exposure to F. prausnitzii. IL-27 secretion induced by F.
  prausnitzii in a JNK dependent manner up-regulates CD39 expression. The ENTPDase
  activity of CD39 then contributes to IL-10 and IL-27 induction and up-regulates
  IDO1, in a feed-forward loop. IL-10 secretion also induced via the TLR2/6/JNK pathway
  limits the LPS-induced expression of CD83, which is affected by TLR2/6 triggering
  but not JNK blocking. Finally, PDL-1 expression relies on IDO1 enzymatic activity
  and, partly, on JNK and IL-27 signaling.
