caption: Synaptic activity at distal synapses can induce action potentials, which
  leads to Ca2+ influx in the soma to engage signaling cascades to the nucleus. Within
  the nucleus, genes respond to these incoming signals in two ways. The delayed IEGs
  undergo transcription initiation, which includes recruitment of general transcription
  factors (GTFs), Pol II and acquisition of histone modifications. Thus, they manifest
  relatively slower expression kinetics. The rapid IEGs are poised for rapid transcription
  within 2–5 minutes of activity due to the NELF-mediated Pol II stalling near their
  promoters. The presence of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) promotes
  the entry of stalled Pol II into the productive elongation phase. Moreover, the
  stalling of the pioneer Pol II facilitates the recruitment of additional Pol II
  to these promoters pre-loaded with GTFs and active histone marks. Newly recruited
  Pol II can then re-initiate successive rounds of transcription resulting in a quick
  burst of the gene product. The exact signaling pathway leading up to Pol II productive
  elongation remains unknown. Also note that, upon transcription initiation, transient
  polymerase stalling can occur in all genes, including delayed IEGs. However, rapid
  IEGs are ‘armed’ to prolong this natural pause and utilize it to respond rapidly.
