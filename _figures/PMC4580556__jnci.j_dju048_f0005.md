caption: Pathway analysis of the debulking signature. Using the Pathway Studio 7.1
  (Ariadne Genomics) software and a novel signature of 200 debulking-associated genes,
  we identified pathways statistically significantly associated with suboptimal debulking
  surgery. A gene is labeled in red when it is overexpressed in tumors that were subsequently
  suboptimally debulked. Conversely, genes overexpressed in tumors with optimal cytoreduction
  are labeled in blue. Genes with predictive power toward poor prognosis based on
  the meta-analysis are highlighted with pink borders. Red broken arrows indicate
  direct stimulatory modification. Green arrows indicate EGR-1–based transcriptional
  regulations. Orange arrows indicate TGF-β/Smad–based transcriptional regulations.
  Blue solid arrows indicate other direct regulations. Blue broken arrows indicate
  other indirect regulations. Purple sticks indicate binding.
