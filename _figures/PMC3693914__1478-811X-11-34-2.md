caption: DA biosynthesis and degradation. The major pathway for DA biosynthesis starts
  at tyrosine or phenylalanine which can be hydroxylated by phenylalanine hydroxylase.
  Tyrosine is hydroxylated to form DOPA, now bearing the catechol moiety, by BH4-dependent
  tyrosine hydroxylase or alternatively by tyrosinase. Decarboxylation of DOPA by
  AADC leads then to DA. In another pathway for DA synthesis AADC action occurs before
  the hydroxylation at the aromatic ring. Tyramine is then oxidized by Cyp2D. Besides
  being a neurotransmitter itself, DA is also the precursor of epinephrine and norepinephrine.
  DA degradation is performed by COMT, MAO, ADH, ALDH and AR in variable order leading
  to DOPAC and HVA as the main endproducts. Phenolsulfotransferases and uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferases
  catalyze conjugation reactions with phosphate and glucuronic acid respectively.
  The relative contributions of the different enzymes are strongly species-, tissue-
  and celltype-dependent. The depicted reactions may occur in distinct compartments.
