caption: Threonine biosynthesis pathway. The chemical reactions are catalysed by aspartate
  kinase (AK), aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASD), homoserine dehydrogenase
  (HDH), homoserine kinase (HK), and threonine synthase (TSY). Metabolites with fixed
  and variable concentrations are shown as grey and white boxes, respectively. Solid
  arrows denote production and consumption of metabolites, red dashed arrows denote
  enzyme inhibition.
