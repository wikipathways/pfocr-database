caption: Representative picture of the canonical GR signalling pathway. After binding
  to GC, GR undergoes a FKBP51-FKBP52 mediated conformational change, becomes hyper-phosphorylated,
  dissociates from accessory proteins (chaperone complex) and finally translocates
  into the nucleus. Here, after dimerization with other GRs, it regulates the transcription
  of target genes by binding to DNA. Interestingly, GR may enhance or repress transcription
  of target genes by directly binding to palindromic GC response elements (GRE), or
  by tethering itself to other transcription factors apart from DNA binding, or in
  a composite manner by both directly binding GRE and interacting with transcription
  factors bound to neighbouring sites. Created with BioRender.com.
