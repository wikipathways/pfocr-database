caption: Network analysis. (a) Nine major networks were then identified by 6 hours,
  and by 24 hours, more than 25 networks were identified utilizing involved genes
  at each time point. (b) Top network at 6 hours postinfection. The top network at
  6 hours postinfection included genes with functions related to Cell Death and Cellular
  Development and involved mostly downregulated genes such as Il8, hmox1, bcl3, BIRC3,
  cxcl2, IRF1, cx3cl1, cdkna (26 genes). (c) Top network at 24 hours postinfection
  which demonstrated mostly downregulation of gene expression. At 24 hours postinfection,
  the top network functions involved gene expression, infection mechanism, and tumor
  morphology and involved up- and downregulated genes such as TP53, GSR, TRIO, HSPA1L,
  PLK2, ABL2 (35 genes).
