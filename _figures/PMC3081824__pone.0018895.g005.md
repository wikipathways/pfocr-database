caption: Genes encoding enzymes in fucose synthesis, conjugation and breakdown are
  depicted in the boxes. The two pathways of fucose synthesis occur in the cytosol.
  The synthesized GDP-L-fucose is transported to Golgi where they are conjugated with
  carbohydrates and modified in the Golgi apparatus. These fucosylated conjugates
  are cleaved by fucosidases. The genes expressed in Holstein milk are underlined.
  Among the expressed genes only TSTA3, GMDS and FUT5 (marked with an asterisk) had
  a higher expression in the transition milk. The expression of FUK was similar in
  the two stages. All other genes had higher expression in late lactation.
