caption: Overview of the metabolomic profile of the Brucella anthropi MAPB-9 exposed
  to biphenyl. The red-colored compounds shown in the image represent metabolites
  formed or upregulated during the biphenyl degradation pathway. The red arrow indicates
  the high level of metabolite in the extract of MAPB-9 supplemented with biphenyl.
  In the presence of biphenyl, the induction of biphenyl degrading enzyme leads to
  the accumulation and identification of metabolites that are converted to pyruvic
  acid via 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase. The pyruvic acid leads to the formation
  of acetyl CoA, which enters the TCA cycle and glyoxylate cycle. Glyoxylate pathway
  metabolites such as oxalate and glycolic acid were identified to be upregulated
  to conserve energy. The presence of lactic acid, malonic, 2,3 butanediol, and acetoin
  indicated the occurrence of the fermentation. Some metabolites found in the composition
  of exopolysaccharide and biosurfactant were also identified, showing the biphenyl-induced
  cell’s adaptive behavior
