  strategies targeting arginine metabolism. ADI-PEG20, an arginine consumer, decomposes
  arginine in the TME, and induces upregulation of NOS2 expression and downregulation
  of Arg1 to promote M1-like polarization. In addition, ADI-PEG20 enhances the phagocytic
  ability of GAMs, and promotes the M1-like factors secretion. b Therapeutic strategies
