caption: The involvement of mast cell mediators in the coagulation and kallikrein–kinin
  system. The figure illustrates the effects that mast cells mediators released upon
  activation during anaphylaxis exert in the kallikrein–kinin, coagulation, and fibrinolytic
  systems. Solid lines represent activated pathways. Dashed lines are inhibitory pathways.
  Kinin-forming system factors are represented in blue; the fibrinolytic system is
  represented in red; the common coagulation pathway in dark purple; the extrinsic
  coagulation pathway in medium purple; the intrinsic coagulation pathway in light
  purple. PolyP, polyphosphates; TF, tissue factor; PK, prekallikrein; KK, Kallikrein;
  BK, bradykinin; HK, high molecular-weight kininogen; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator;
  uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; FDP, fibrin degradation products; PAF, platelet-activating
  factor. (Legend and figure adapted from []).
