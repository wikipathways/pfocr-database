caption: The pathways converge to IL-2 transcription, which determines T cell clonal
  expansion and subsequent immune response. TCRs functions together with other structures,
  with which forms the T-cell receptor complex. After the TCR binds the peptide-MHC
  complex, the TCR undergoes conformational changes that determine the phosphorylation
  of the ITAMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) located on CD247
  and the CD3 polypeptides. ITAM phosphorylation creates binding sites for proteins
  presenting Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, one of the more important ones being the
  zeta associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP-70). After binding and activation, ZAP-70
  recruits linker of activation of T cells (LAT). After the binding and activation
  of LAT, other signaling molecules are recruited. Such is the case of SH2-binding
  leukocyte phosphoprotein of 76-kDa (SLP-76) and Grb2. Grb2 activates SOS, which
  catalyzes the exchange of GDP to GTP linked to Ras, activating the MAPK pathway,
  phosphorylating the extracellular receptor-activated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), which
  in turn, phosphorylates Elk. Thus determines the transcription of Fos, important
  for the transcription of interleukin-2 (IL-2). Other pathway that branches off the
  TCR and phosphorylated proteins complex determine the activation of Vav, which determines
  the GDP/GTP exchange on Rac, which in turn activates p38. This action determines,
  in the end, the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates
  c-Jun, representing the second molecule implicated in the transcription of IL-2.
