caption: 'Multigene signature-based network displaying AID as a key gene was created
  using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software (IPA; http://www.ingenuity.com). The
  color code of transcripts indicates up- (red) and down-regulation (green) of genes
  in the NP disease group in comparison to rhinosinusitis without polyps. Solid lines
  in grey display the IPA-identified direct associations between transcripts; solid
  lines in red or in blue reflect the IPA-identified associations overlapping with
  the 25-gene-identified molecular interactions. The multigene approach including
  the analysis of co-regularities can be extended to find not-yet-identified functional
  links between the genes under investigation; statistically significant, study-based
  biological associations (SYSTAT program; ) are displayed by dashed lines; color
  code: red for correlation coefficient ≥0.6, p<0.0001; blue for correlation coefficient
  <0.6, p<0.05.'
