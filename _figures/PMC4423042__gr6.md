caption: Cartoon representing LPA-activated signaling cascades that regulate OHC motility,
  as suggested by our results and previous studies (in black font), as well as potential
  mediators and interactions that require confirmation (gray font). LPA activation
  of the RhoA/ROCK/LIMK1/cofilin pathway would target actin-filament dynamics, enhancing
  actin depolymerization. In turn, activation of the RhoA/ROCK/PKCα/ adducin pathway
  would phosphorylate adducin at Ser-726, inhibiting actin-spectrin binding. However,
  these two signaling cascades would be working in parallel, with PKCα facilitating
  cofilin phosphorylation by a still unknown mechanism. The final result of the activation
  of these two signaling pathways would be the same, i.e., a decrease in the integrity
  of the OHC actin/spectrin-based cortical cytoskeletal network.
