caption: The signaling pathway of sacubitril/valsartan inhibiting VSMCs proliferation.
  Sacubitril/valsartan can inhibit the migration and proliferation of VSMCs induced
  by Ang II, which may be through Notch1/Jagged-1 and ERK1/2 pathways. On the one
  hand, Ang II increases the expression of Notch1 and Jagged-1, causing the proliferation
  and migration of VSMCs. On the other hand, it activates the ERK1/2 pathway, in which
  Ras is an upstream activator protein, Raf and MEK1/2 are activated in turn, resulting
  in increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2. In addition, sacubitril/valsartan also inhibits
  the decomposition of NPs, thereby inhibiting the proliferation and migration of
  VSMCs
