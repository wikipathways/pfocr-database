caption: Model of thrombin and p38 regulation of ERK1/2 and α-catenin phosphorylation.
  A, thrombin induces p38 activation via a noncanonical ubiquitin-driven TAB1/TAB2-dependent
  pathway, whereas thrombin-activated PAR1 stimulates ERK1/2 activation through a
  canonical three-tiered kinase cased mediated by G protein-stimulated Ras-Raf-MEK
  induced ERK1/2 activation. The p38 MAPK negatively regulates ERK1/2 signaling, resulting
  in amplified ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by thrombin. However, the mechanism
  p38 and ERK1/2 of convergence is not known. B, inhibition of p38 by SB203580 blocks
  α-catenin basal phosphorylation at S652. However, depletion of p38α by siRNA fails
  to affect basal phosphorylation of α-catenin, suggesting that another kinase may
  function redundantly to phosphorylation α-catenin in the absence of p38α expression.
  ERK, extracellular signal–regulated protein kinase; PAR1, protease-activated receptor-1;
  TAB1, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1-binding protein 1.
