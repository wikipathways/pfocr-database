caption: Integration of the AinS-AinR and LuxI-LuxR quorum sensory pathways. Sequential
  integration of these two pathways allows cells to sense and respond to three distinct
  population densities. The signal synthase AinS (S) produces a constant supply of
  C8-HSL (C8, black circle), which freely diffuses in both directions across the cytoplasmic
  membrane (CM) and the outer membrane (OM). At low cell density (LO), the concentration
  of C8-HSL remains too low to efficiently bind to its receptor AinR (A), which functions
  as a kinase to autophosphorylate a conserved histidine residue (H). The phosphoryl
  group is passed sequentially from this histidine to a conserved aspartyl residue
  (D) within the C-terminal domain of AinR and then to a conserved histidine (H) in
  LuxU (U) and finally to a conserved aspartyl residue in the response regulator LuxO
  (O). Phospho-LuxO then activates transcription of at least one sRNA. In complex
  with Hfq, the sRNA(s) destabilizes the litR transcript. Because LitR is absent,
  acs transcription remains low; thus, acetate (ace; red diamond) produced by glycolysis
  and the Pta-AckA pathway (not shown) begins to accumulate. At medium cell density
  (MED), the acetate has accumulated to a high concentration. However, C8-HSL has
  also accumulated to a concentration large enough to efficiently bind to AinR, switching
  it from a kinase to a phosphatase. The AinR phosphatase activity drains phosphoryl
  groups from LuxO. In the absence of LuxO and hence the inhibitory sRNA(s), LitR
  can become translated and, via a currently unknown mechanism, can activate acs transcription.
  The resultant Acs can begin to assimilate the acetate, converting it to acetyl-CoA.
  Simultaneously, LitR can directly activate luxR transcription. LuxR possesses a
  low affinity for C8-HSL; thus, the lux operon becomes weakly activated. The result
  is low-level luminescence (small yellow star) and low-level expression of luxI,
  which encodes the signal synthase LuxI (I). LuxI produces 3OC6-HSL (C6; yellow circle)
  which, like C8-HSL, freely diffuses in both directions across the CM and OM. At
  high cell density (HI), 3OC6-HSL has attained a large enough concentration to efficiently
  bind to LuxR. The resultant complex can activate lux transcription efficiently;
  thus, stronger luminescence ensues (large yellow star). Because Acs has been expressed
  since the cells were at medium density, the acetate concentration has dramatically
  diminished.
