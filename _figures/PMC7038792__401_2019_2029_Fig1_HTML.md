caption: NF2/merlin signaling and potential therapeutic targets in NF2. A schematic
  diagram depicts major intracellular pathways regulated by merlin, the protein product
  of the NF2 gene. Merlin is associated with the plasma membrane via its N-terminal
  FERM domain, where it interacts with adherens junctions and numerous cell surface
  receptors including integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), and CD44. The C-terminal
  domain of merlin interacts with cytoskeletal actin filaments. Merlin has a predominantly
  inhibitory activity on downstream effectors including RAS, PI3K, RAC, and SRC, which
  may result in reduced downstream RAF/MEF/ERK, AKT/JNK/JUN, mTORC1, FAK, and RAC
  signaling. Merlin may inhibit translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus, reducing
  the output of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Merlin also interacts with the
  Hippo pathway by promoting MST1/2-mediated translocation of LATS1/2 to the nucleus
  as well as through inhibition of CRL4DCAF1, resulting in reduced transcriptional
  output of YAP/TAZ and TEA domain transcription factors (TEADs). In the nucleus,
  merlin may also inhibit the activity of LIN28A, thereby relieving inhibition of
  the let-7 miRNA cluster leading to downregulation of proto-oncogenic proteins such
  as MYC and RAS. Loss of function of merlin via pathogenic mutations in NF2 patients
  results in alteration of downstream activity in each of these pathways (red arrows
  indicate steps with possible increased activity following loss of merlin function,
  as in NF2-associated tumors), potentially leading to increased cell growth, protein
  and fatty acid synthesis, proliferation, and survival. A variety of therapeutic
  avenues have been explored in NF2 patients, including inhibition of proteins regulated
  by merlin as well as other cellular receptors. Inhibition of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway
  via small molecule MEK inhibitors is currently being explored in clinical trials
  for NF2-associated tumors (NCT02639546, NCT03095248). A phase 2 clinical trial is
  exploring small molecule inhibition of FAK by GSK2256098 (NCT02523014/A071401) in
  NF2 mutant meningiomas. Small molecule mTOR inhibitors including everolimus and
  sirolimus have shown therapeutic promise in NF2-associated schwannomas and meningiomas,
  and additional compounds including RAD001 and AZD2014 are in clinical trials for
  the treatment of progressive/symptomatic NF2-associated meningiomas (NCT02831257)
  and recurrent high-grade (WHO grade II/III) meningiomas (NCT03071874), respectively.
  The VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab has shown clinical utility in NF2-associated schwannomas,
  meningiomas, and ependymomas. Inhibition of the tyrosine kinase receptors cMET and
  EGFR may provide additional therapeutic opportunities in NF2-associated meningiomas.
  Additional therapeutic targets have been proposed, including the immunomodulatory
  PD-1/PD-L1 axis, the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and Ephrin receptor A2 (EphA2)
