caption: Cell cycle regulation of p27Kip1 and related signaling pathways. p27Kip1
  can promote cell cycle arrest or proliferation, depending on the cellular location.
  Nuclear p27Kip1 will bind cyclin E and CDK2, inhibiting its kinase activity and
  leaving the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) protein unphosphorylated. In this state,
  the E2F transcription factor is inhibited from transcribing genes necessary to enter
  the cell cycle. With proper stimuli and/or growth factors, p27Kip1 is phosphorylated
  by CDK2 at Thr187, and is quickly ubiquitinated by SKP for subsequent proteasomal
  degradation. Without the inhibitor effects of p27Kip1, the cyclin E/CDK2 complex
  can phosphorylate, and inactivate Rb, allowing E2F to transcribe cell cycle genes.
  p27Kip1 can also be phosphorylated by hKIS at Ser10, which promotes sequestration
  to the cytosol. Cytosolic p27Kip1 can promote cell proliferation by importing cyclin
  D/CDK4/6 into the nuclei to further target Rb inhibition. Both Akt and AMPK will
  phosphorylate p27Kip1 on Thr157 and Thr198, respectively, to stabilize p27Kip1 in
  the cytosol and prevent reentry into the nucleus.
