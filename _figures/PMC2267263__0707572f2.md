caption: Schematic representation of the neurotransmitters involved in LOS smooth
  muscle contraction. ACh and tachykinins (substance P, neurokinin A and B) released
  by nerve varicosities induce LOS contraction by activation of M3 and NK2 receptors
  respectively. Nitric oxide (NO) can also participate in the LOS contraction by a
  cGMP pathway. LOS, lower oesophageal sphincter.
