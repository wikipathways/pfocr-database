caption: Schematic view of sex determination. In the undifferentiated gonad both Wnt4
  and RSPO1 (R-spondin 1) are important regulators in particular for the proliferation
  of the coelomic epithelium. In XX gonads, expression of Wnt4, and RSPO1 leads to
  ovarian differentiation and oogenesis as they suppress Sox9 expression, stimulate
  granulosa cell differentiation, and promote female sexual development by sustaining
  Müllerian duct differentiation. In XY gonads male reproductive organs are determined
  by the expression of sex-determining region Y (SRY) together with Splicing factor
  1 (SF1) leading to upregulation of Sox9 gene expression. In addition, Fibroblast
  Growth Factor 9 (FGF9), Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1), and Zinc Finger 3 (ZNFR3) inhibit the
  pro-ovarian Wnt signaling pathway. Also, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) prevents the
  development of the Müllerian duct into female reproductive organs.
