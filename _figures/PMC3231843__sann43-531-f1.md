caption: Platelet activation pathways and drug molecular targets. Thrombin binds to
  PAR-1 receptor, which leads to shape change, phospholipase C (PLC) activation, thromboxane
  A2 (T×A2) generation, and activation of the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor,
  resulting in sustained platelet aggregation. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-l catalyzes the
  production of T×A2, a potent platelet aggregator, generated by platelets activated
  by thrombin and other agonists. Adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) binds to its 7-transmembrane
  domain receptors, P2Y1 and P2Y12, to activate platelets. P2Y1 is coupled to Gαq
  and G12. Gαq is linked to a signaling pathway involving PLC activation, resulting
  in a rise in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca+2]i) and protein kinase
  C (PKC) activation, leading to GP IIb/IIIa activation and transient platelet aggregation.
  G12 mediates platelet shape change. P2Y12 is linked to Gai-coupled signaling cascades
  associated with adenylcyclase (Ac) down-regulation and decreased cyclic-3',5'-monophosphate
  (cAMP) production, which mediates GP IIb/IIIa receptor activation, leading to sustained
  platelet aggregation.
