caption: 'Three possible ways of therapeutic effects of catalase-transfected macrophages
  in PD mouse model: Pathway I: macrophages transfected with catalase encoding pDNA
  cross the BBB and release catalase and its genetic material in SNpc; Pathway II:
  catalase and its genetic material are released from transfected macrophages in exosomes
  to the blood stream and bypass the BBB independently of the cell-carriers; Pathway
  III: gene and drug-incorporating exosomes released in the periphegral organs (liver,
  spleen, etc.) or in the blood are taken by residential macrophages, monocytes, T-cells,
  or dendritic cells suppressing peripheral leukocyte activation that may result in
  decrease of inflammation in the brain.'
