caption: Nrf2 signaling in Alzheimer's Disease. An overview of Nrf2 signaling pathway
  in controls and AD brain. In normal cells, Nrf2 is tightly regulated by KEAP1 (Kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein 1), which forms a complex with Nrf2 and facilitates its ubiquitination
  via the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CUL3-RBX1), targeting it for degradation by
  the 26S proteasome. Modifications to KEAP1's cysteine residues disrupt the Nrf2-KEAP1
  interaction, allowing Nrf2 to accumulate, translocate into the nucleus, and bind
  to antioxidant response elements (ARE) as a heterodimer with small MAF proteins.
  This nuclear Nrf2 binding induces the transcription of genes involved in redox regulation,
  mitochondrial functions, anti-inflammatory responses, and anti-ferroptosis mechanisms,
  which promote cellular resilience. In Alzheimer's disease, however, this regulatory
  mechanism is impaired. Nrf2 is unable to effectively dissociate from KEAP1, leading
  to its decreased nuclear translocation and reduced activation of cytoprotective
  genes. This results in a downregulation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses,
  contributing to AD pathology. AD-related changes include increased amyloid-β plaque
  formation (via elevated BACE1), tau protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, impaired
  mitochondrial function, and a compromised anti-ferroptosis response. Created with
