caption: Following stroke, the stability of NICD is increased by its interaction with
  Pin1, and the NICD-Pin1 complex then translocates to the nucleus. Simultaneously,
  the reduced oxygen level leads to activation of HIF-1α, which then translocates
  to the nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor. Cell surface receptors
  elicit phosphorylation of IκBα, the Inhibitor protein of the NF-complex (p65 and
  p50), making it ubiquitinated and resulting in activation of the NF-κB pathway where
  the complex also functions as a transcription factor after nuclear translocation.
  The MAPK pathway is also elicited during activation of cell surface receptors and
  downstream kinases of the MAPK pathway, p38 and JNK, which then phosphorylate key
  residues of p53 to facilitate its nuclear translocation once stabilized by its interaction
  with Pin1. The nuclear proteins, HIF-1α, p65/p50, p53/Pin1 and NICD/Pin1. along
  with the NICD-binding protein RBP-J/MAML, and co-activator proteins p300, CREB and
  AP-1, form the ‘multi-protein complex’, a proposed transcriptional complex assembled
  during ischemic stroke.
