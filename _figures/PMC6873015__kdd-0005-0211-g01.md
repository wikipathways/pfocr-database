caption: Triggers and routes of B-cell development. Immature B cells derived from
  LSCs leave the bone marrow and differentiate into mature B1 and B2 cells, then plasma
  cells are developed via TI and (or) TD mechanisms. The former one is non-BCR or
  T-cell dependent. However, the TD pathway requires the assistance from activated
  CD4+ Th cells. First, following an extra-follicular response the SLPCs are generated.
  Next, some of the SLPCs reenter the B-cell follicle receiving the help of Th cell,
  forming a GC, and then migrate to the bone marrow becoming LLPCs. LSC, lymphoid
  stem cells; LLPC, long-lived plasma cell; TI, T cell-independent; TD, T cell-dependent;
  GC, germinal center; Th, T helper; SLPC; short-lived plasma cell.
