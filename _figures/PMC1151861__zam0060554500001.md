  AHAS, acetohydroxy acid synthase; AHAIR, acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase; DHAD,
  dihydroxy acid dehydratase; BCAT, branched-chain amino acid transaminase; KPHMT,
  ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase; PS, pantothenate synthetase; PK, pantothenate
  kinase; ADC, aspartate-α-decarboxylase; IPMS, isopropylmalate synthase.'
