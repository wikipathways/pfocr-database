caption: Increased extracellular pressure appears to activate FAK through a complex
  dual pathway requiring an intact cytoskeleton and paxillin as well as cytoskeleton-independent
  activation of Src and PI3K. FAK is activated through phosphorylation at its Y397
  and Y576 residues and in turn supports pressure-induced Akt S473 phosphorylation.
  Phosphorylated FAK localizes to β1-integrin heterodimers in an Akt-dependent manner,
  resulting in integrin activation and increased substrate binding affinity.
