caption: GRK2 interactome involved in the modulation of cell cycle progression. GRK2
  is linked to diverse regulatory networks acting at specific stages of the cell cycle.
  In response to both extrinsic and intrinsic cues, GRK2 protein plays a critical
  role in driving cell progression through G1/S and G2/M transitions in a kinase-dependent
  and independent manner. GRK2 is part of an intrinsic pathway that ensures timely
  progression of cell cycle at G2/M by means of its functional interaction with CDK2/cyclinA
  and Pin1 (). Such pathway is disrupted upon DNA damage, when GRK2 appears to turn
  into a pro-arresting factor that promotes increased cell survival and to dampen
  p53-dependent responses by mechanisms that remain to be established (dotted lines/question
  mark). On the other hand, GRK2 contributes to the Hedgehog/Smoothened-triggered
  control of cell proliferation by promoting Smo activity and relieving the Patched-dependent
  inhibition of cyclin B (). CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; GRK, G protein-coupled
  receptor kinase.
