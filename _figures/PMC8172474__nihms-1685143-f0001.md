caption: Potential pharmacologic targets in metastatic uveal melanoma. Most uveal
  melanomas containing initiating mutation in a member of the Gαq/11pathway (GNAQ,
  GNA11, CYSLTR2, and PLCB4), which trigger oncogenic signaling through multiple effectors,
  including PKC-MEK, PI3K-AKT, and FAK-YAP. The data presented by Paradis and colleagues
  () identifies dual inhibition of MEK and FAK as a synergistic combination in preclinical
  models of uveal melanoma. Other work has shown that HDAC inhibitors may also increase
  the efficacy of MEK inhibitors by blocking AKT and YAP signaling (). Gαq/11 mutations
  result in benign melanocytic lesions unless additional genetic and genomic events
  occur. The mutations most strongly associated with metastasis in uveal melanoma
  occur in the metastasis suppressor BAP1, which are associated with extensive epigenetic
  and transcriptional rewiring that can be at least partly reversed by inhibition
  of HDAC activity. BAP1-mutant uveal melanomas are also enriched for exhausted cytotoxic
  T cells, alternatively activated macrophages, and other cells associated with immune
  dysfunction that likely contribute to metastatic competence and therapeutic resistance.
  LAG3 was recently shown to be a predominant checkpoint marker in uveal melanoma
  and its inhibition is currently the subject of a clinical trial in patients with
  metastatic uveal melanoma.
