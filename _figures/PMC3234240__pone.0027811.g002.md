caption: All deregulated proteins (0.2 Gy and 2 Gy ICPL and 2D-DIGE; ,  and ) were
  imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis as described in . The proteins marked
  in red represent the upregulated proteins and in green the downregulated proteins.
  The complex III proteins formed a clearly defined cluster of functionally related
  proteins. The solid arrows represent direct interactions and the dotted arrows indirect
  interactions.
