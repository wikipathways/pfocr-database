caption: Schematic mechanism of Aβ oligomer-mediated aberrant PAK activation and translocation
  in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. Both Ephrin B and NMDA receptors are rapidly
  down-regulated by Aβ oligomers () and also activate a Tiam1> Rac > PAK pathway that
  regulates dendritic spine stability and formation through control of actin dynamics,
  including suppression of the actin-severing protein cofilin reported to mediate
  oligomer-induced spine loss (, ). Tiam1 activation is also required for acute Aβ
  aggregate-induced Rac activation and translocation () that we show accompanies PAK
  translocation. Tiam1 activation can be achieved by phosphorylation from elevated
  calcium acting through CaMKII, but PAK is eventually inhibited by calcium-induced
  calpain activation of Cdk5 (). PAK could also be activated through direct interaction
  with candidate Aβ receptors (X), for example, the amyloid precursor protein () or
  indirectly via Src/Fyn activation of Tiam1. Although the Aβ receptors are not clearly
  established, Aβ-mediated in vivo synaptotoxicity and in vitro LTP deficits are both
  Fyn kinase-(, ) and NMDA receptor-dependent (, ). The Src family kinase Fyn is also
  physically associated with at least two candidate Aβ receptors (X), notably integrin
  receptors (, ) and α7-nicotinic receptors (), suggesting they could activate Fyn
  to mediate deranged downstream Rac/PAK translocation and signaling caused by Aβ
  oligomers, which we find blocked by the anti-oligomer drug curcumin. This hypothetical
  scheme is supported by our data showing that the Src/Fyn inhibitor PP2 blocks the
  Rac/PAK translocation and loss of dendritic spine F-actin.
