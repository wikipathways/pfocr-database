caption: A hypothetical model for NAA-induced young fruit abscission in apple. NAA,
  like shading, imposes a stress signal on leaf, or globally on any other photosynthetically-active
  tissues within the tree, causing photosynthesis repression and associated nutrient
  stress. As the nutrient stress is perceived at the fruit level, its growth is inhibited
  by a sugar transport block, resulting in a lower sink strength of the fruitlet.
  Meanwhile, ethylene and/or ABA are produced in response to photosynthesis inhibition
  and through sugar signaling. The elevated ethylene level decreases auxin transport
  to the FAZ and increases its sensitivity to ethylene, causing the differentiation
  of the FAZ and the execution of fruit abscission.

  (Malus domestica) reveals a shared pathway involving reduced photosynthesis, alterations
  in carbohydrate transport and signaling and hormone crosstalk.
