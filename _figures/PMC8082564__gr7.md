caption: Schematic of octanoate oxidation in liver and muscles. Speculative metabolic
  pathway for octanoate oxidation in liver and muscles (cardiac and skeletal). Dietary-free
  octanoate reaches the liver through the portal circulation where liver, but not
  muscle, can activate free octanoate within the mitochondria via medium-chain acyl-CoA
  synthetases (ACSM). Muscles and liver mitochondria metabolize octanoylcarnitine
  as a product of peroxisomal oxidation. The enzyme that converts octanoylcarnitine
  back to octanoyl-CoA in the mitochondria is not CPT2 but could be carnitine O-octanoyltransferase
  (CrOT). Octanoyl-CoA enters mitochondrial oxidation through medium-chain acyl-CoA
  dehydrogenase (MCAD) and can be oxidized for energy production in liver and muscles
  or can be used for ketone body production in liver. β-Oxi, beta-oxidation; Carn,

    Dietary-free octanoate reaches the liver through the portal circulation where
    liver, but not muscle, can activate free octanoate within the mitochondria via
    medium-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSM). Muscles and liver mitochondria metabolize
    octanoylcarnitine as a product of peroxisomal oxidation. The enzyme that converts
    octanoylcarnitine back to octanoyl-CoA in the mitochondria is not CPT2 but could
    be carnitine O-octanoyltransferase (CrOT). Octanoyl-CoA enters mitochondrial oxidation
    through medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and can be oxidized for energy
    production in liver and muscles or can be used for ketone body production in liver.
