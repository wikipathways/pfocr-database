caption: Change in metabolites of the metabolic pathways in shoots of JD8 and JD17
  after 15 days of drought treatment, metabolic changes for wheat plants upon drought
  stress obtained from OPLS-DA analysis. The proposed metabolic pathways were based
  on web-based metabolic pathway database MetaCyc (http://www.metacyc.org) and the
  literature. Metabolites with red boxes denote significant increases while with green
  ones denote significant decreases. The bold-lettered metabolites were detected in
  this study. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05.
