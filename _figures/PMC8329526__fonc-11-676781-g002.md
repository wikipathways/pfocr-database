caption: Protumor role of claudins. The mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis due to
  claudins have also not been well established. Studies mainly support the hypothesis
  that claudins activate various signaling pathways or proteases to promote tumorigenesis
  directly and indirectly. One direct pathway involves association with other molecules,
  such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), membrane type-matrix metalloproteinases
  (MT-MMPs), disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) and integrins, which activate
  claudins to participate in signal transduction, extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation
  and receptor cleavage. Another direct way involves association with transcription
  factors (TFs) such as YAP/TAZ and β-catenin to induce the nuclear accumulation of
  these TFs, although the exact mechanisms through which claudins induce gene transcription
  are not clear. An indirect way in which claudins activate oncogenic pathways is
  proposed to require two kinds of molecules. One kind is proteases such as MMPs,
  which cleave the ECM to release GFs to activate the RTK/PI3K, MAPK, TGF-β/SMAD,
  and JAK/STAT pathways. Another indirect way is through protein kinases, such as
  SFK, ABL and Tyk2, which can phosphorylate downstream molecules involved in oncogenic
  pathways, although the mechanisms through which claudins activate these kinases
  are not clear. In addition, these signaling pathways are extensively interconnected
  at various levels, which integrate signaling from claudins to promote tumorigenesis.
  Although there have been studies that reported the effect of claudins on some of
  the molecules shown, the exact mechanisms involved are not known (represented by
  dashed line arrows in the figure).
