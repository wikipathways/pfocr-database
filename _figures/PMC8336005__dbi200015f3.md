caption: 'β-catenin is the central player in the canonical Wnt pathway. A: β-catenin
  is comprised of a central 12-unit Armadillo repeat domain (ARM) flanked on either
  side by distinct N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain (CTD). The N-terminal region
  consists of conserved serine (S33, S47, S45) and threonine (Thr41) residues that
  are sequentially phosphorylated by CK1α and GSK3β; phosphorylation of these sites
  promotes binding to β-TrCP, subsequent ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation.
  The ARM region forms a superhelix featuring a positively charged groove that serves
  as a platform for interactions with various β-catenin binding partners, including
  E-cadherin, Axin, APC, and TCF/LEF proteins. These partners share overlapping binding
  sites in the ARM groove and thus typically cannot bind simultaneously. DIX domain,
  Dishevelled/Axin domain; HMG box domain: high-mobility group box domain; RGS domain:
  regulator of G-protein signaling domain; TMD, transmembrane domain. B: In the absence
  of extracellular Wnts (inactive [left panel]), β-catenin is bound by a destruction
  complex comprised of Axin, APC, GSK3β, CK1α, and PP2A. CK1α and GSK3β sequentially
  phosphorylate (P) free cytosolic β-catenin, targeting it for ubiquitination (Ub)
  by β-TrCP and subsequent proteasomal degradation. When canonical Wnts bind to their
  frizzled receptors and LRP coreceptors (active [right panel]), they trigger an intracellular
  signaling cascade that leads to hypophosphorylation, stabilization, and accumulation
  of cytosolic β-catenin. β-catenin can then translocate to the nucleus, displace
  Groucho/TLE repressors, and coactivate TCF/LEF transcription factors to mediate
  Wnt target gene expression.'
