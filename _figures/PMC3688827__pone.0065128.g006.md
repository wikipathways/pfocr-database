caption: Shown are AhR signaling, the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, and
  the NLRP3 inflammasome activation pathway regulated by ITGA5/ITGAV and SRC axis.
  Up-regulated genes downstream of ITGA5/ITGAV and SRC were linked to these three
  identified signaling pathways with data only displayed from BCG infection. For details
  on gene abbreviations and fold changes compared with control, see . The network
  is graphically represented as nodes (gene products) and edges (the biological relationship
  between nodes). Red-shaded nodes represent up-regulated genes.
