caption: 'Association between the biochemistry of lactate production and metformin
  use. Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate in
  the cytoplasm. Pyruvate is the only precursor of lactate. (1) When oxygen is available,
  pyruvate enters the mitochondria, and is converted to Acetyl CoA and oxidized in
  the Krebs cycle, delivering nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), flavin adenine
  dinucleotide (FADH2), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). NADH and FADH2 feed the
  electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane to eventually generate
  the bulk of ATP by chemiosmosis. (2) Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is reduced
  to lactate. However, in the liver and kidney, lactate can be converted to pyruvate
  again by the Cori cycle. (3) Pyruvate, the first designated substrate of the gluconeogenic
  pathway, can be used to generate glucose. Metformin inhibits gluconeogenesis, leading
  to pyruvate accumulation and subsequent increased lactate production. It also inhibits
  the electron transport chain, resulting in elevated levels of NADH, a reduced Krebs
  cycle flow and, hence, further contributing to increased pyruvate levels. Figure
