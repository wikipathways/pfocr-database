caption: 'Schematic representation of established and potential interactions between
  the DMG and neuronal microenvironments. (A) DMGs form a complex network involving
  direct communication with neurons and glioma cells. (B) Typically, synaptic neuron
  interaction occurs through the NLG3/NRXN axis. Metalloproteinase ADAM10 cleaves
  NLG3 and is subsequently directed towards an unidentified receptor, leading to glioma
  cell proliferation through the activation of FAK and subsequently the PI3K/AKT pathway.
  (C) A rapid action potential is propagated from presynaptic neurons to DMG cells
  through calcium-permeable (GluA2) AMPA receptors, leading to glioma proliferation.
  Other synaptic receptors might be also involved in the propagation of neuron activity
  as well as downstream calcium signalling pathways mediated by CAMKIIA. Polyamines,
  short, positively charged molecules recently found to be upregulated in DMGs may
  also modulate the activity of GLUA2-AMPARs. (D) DMGs and HGGs can communicate with
  each other through gap junctions, promoting proliferation and resistance to radiotherapy.
  Long potentials were found to be mediated in DMGs through gap junctions. (E) Gliomas
  exhibiting specific PI3K mutations such as a C240R variant may increase synaptogenesis
  in neurons through the release of GPC3. Abbreviations: neuroligin 3 (NRLG3), neurexin
  (NRXN), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10),
  focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B
  (AKT), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II A (CAMKIIα), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic
  subunit alpha (PIK3CA) and glypican 3 (GPC3).'
