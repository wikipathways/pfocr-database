caption: Amyloidogenic vs. nonamyloidogenic APP processing, Aβ aggregation and intracellular
  vs. extracellular Aβ toxicity. a Non-amyloidogenic processing of APP (left) requires
  the dual proteolysis, first by members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease
  domain-containing) protein family (mainly, ADAM10 and ADAM17, also called α-secretases) followed
  by γ-secretase, resulting in release of soluble sAPPα ectodomain, a non-amyloidogenic
  p3 fragment and APP intracellular domain (AICD). In the amyloidogenic pathway (right),
  APP is first cleaved by β-secretase BACE1 releasing the sAPPβ ectodomain, followed
  by γ-secretase processing of the remaining β-CTF giving rise to AICD and Aβ peptide
  species of slightly different lengths. b Monomeric Aβ species, particularly Aβ42
  and Aβ43, have a tendency to aggregate and form structures of higher order. These
  include toxic soluble Aβ dimers, trimers, oligomers and protofibrils, found both
  inside and outside of the cells/neurons, as well as more inert insoluble amyloid
  fibrils, which comprise extracellular APs. c In AD, in addition to their direct
  effects on synaptic transmission/integrity via binding to synaptic membranes/receptors,
  toxic Aβ species may also accumulate within dystrophic neurites and aberrant synaptic
  regions in intracellular compartments, including late endosomal multivesicular bodies
  (MVB) and autophagic vacuoles (AVs) [, ]. Indicated as well is the hypothesized
  self-propelling exacerbating influence of excessive Aβ/cholesterol accumulation,
  disturbed endolysosomal trafficking regulation and/or defective turnover of autophagic
  vacuoles (AV) in this context. All together, this could lead to aberrant cellular
  signaling that in turn may induce and propagate excessive tau phosphorylation, accumulation
  of toxic tau species and related synapto/neurotoxic effects
