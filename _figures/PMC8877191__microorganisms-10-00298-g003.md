caption: Metabolism of trehalose. Ensifer aridi predicted encoding genes (PEGs) involved
  in the metabolism and transport of trehalose are shown in the metabolic pathway.
  The presence of putative ThuR and RpoE2 binding sites upstream of genes (shown in
  the right boxes) are indicated by “#” and “σ”, respectively, on the left of genes
  when identified, and the position of conserved residues are bolded and colored accordingly
  in boxes. The salt response refers to fold change previously found by RNAseq [].
  Positive fold changes indicating upregulation (green) and negative ones showing
  repression (red) in salt containing medium are bolded when above 2.
