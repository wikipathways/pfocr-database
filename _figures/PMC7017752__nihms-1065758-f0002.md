caption: 'RAS proteins function as fundamental signaling switches controlling a multitude
  of cellular processes including normal cell growth and differentiation. RAS proteins
  exist in two cellular states: an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound
  form. Although RAS has a low intrinsic GTPase-activity, RAS-GTPase activating proteins
  (GAPs) stimulate this activity and consequently help to hydrolyze bound GTP back
  to GDP. Conversely, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), e.g. SOS, convert
  RAS to its active GTP-bound form. NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a RAS-GAP, which is
  able to negatively regulate HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, MRAS, RRAS, and RRAS2 (TC21). Neurofibromin
  deficiency therefore results in elevated RAS signaling. RAS signaling transduces
  extracellular signals from ligand-activated receptors, both receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs) and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) at the cell surface through multiple
  pathways. RAS-GTP proteins activate a multitude of effector proteins, including
  RAF proteins (ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF) and the MEK–ERK signaling cascade, RalGDS, and
  the PI3 kinase family. The molecular and cellular events controlled by normal and
  aberrantly regulated RAS signaling are cell-type specific, depending on the expression
  of different RAS isoforms and their relative engagement of particular RAS effector
  proteins. Small molecule inhibitors to upstream regulators of RAS and its downstream
  effectors in NF1 clinical trials are shown in red. Abbreviations: Growth factor
  receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), src homology 2 domain (SHC), adenyl cyclase (AC),
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), α, β and γ represent the subunits of a heterotrimeric
  G protein complex.'
