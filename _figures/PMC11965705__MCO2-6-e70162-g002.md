  EGFR is expressed on the surface of normal epithelial cells and is frequently overexpressed
  in pancreatic cancer cells, contributing to tumor progression. EGFR signaling primarily
  activates two major downstream pathways: the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, which regulates
  cell proliferation and survival, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which controls cell
  growth and metabolism. The TGF‐β pathway mediates its effects through both canonical
  (SMAD‐dependent) and noncanonical (SMAD‐independent) mechanisms. Upon TGF‐β binding
  to its receptor TGFβR, receptor‐associated kinases phosphorylate and activate SMAD2/3.
  Activated SMAD2/3 then forms a complex with SMAD4, which translocates to the nucleus
  to regulate the transcription of target genes. Additionally, TGF‐β signaling can
  activate non‐SMAD pathways, including PI3K/AKT, RAS/ERK, JNK/p38, and NF‐κB, which
  collectively modulate diverse cellular processes. In the Wnt signaling pathway,
  the binding of Wnt ligands to Frizzled receptors activates DVL. Activated DVL induces
  the dissociation of GSK‐3β from the AXIN complex, thereby inhibiting GSK‐3β activity.
  This inhibition prevents β‐catenin phosphorylation, leading to its cytoplasmic accumulation.
  Subsequently, stabilized β‐catenin translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to
  TCF/LEF transcription factors to activate the transcription of Wnt target genes
  involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. The NOTCH signaling pathway
  is initiated when NOTCH ligands bind to NOTCH receptors, triggering sequential proteolytic
  cleavage mediated by ADAM and γ‐Secretase. This process releases the NICD, which
  translocates to the nucleus and binds to the CSL transcription factor. NICD recruits
  MAML proteins, displacing transcriptional corepressors and recruiting Co‐A to promote
  the transcription of NOTCH target genes. Abbreviations: DVL, disheveled; GSK‐3β,
