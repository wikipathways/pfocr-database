caption: Biological process enriched for T25 up-regulated VuPKs showing the interaction
  network (colored lines) of the associated elements (proteins). The colored dots
  (green, black, and red) in the protein Uniprot ID correspond to the fold-change
  log (log2FC) found in the present study and are according to the presented scale.
  The colors of the lines are associated with the colors of the central nodes that
  contain the abbreviation of the enriched biological process. Different colored lines
  connected to a given protein (colored dots—red, black, or green) indicate that this
  protein participates in different enriched processes. Central nodes with the border
  highlighted in black represent GO terms associated with the biotic stress response.
  T25, ‘RD25 vs. Cont.25’; GO terms enriched (AT, auxin transport; CC, cellular response
  to chitin; CA, cold acclimation; DR, defense response; DB, defense response to bacterium;
  DO, defense response to oomycetes; PA, positive regulation of abscisic acid-activated
  signaling pathway; PS, positive regulation of response to salt stress; PH, potassium
  ion homeostasis; RC, response to cold; RM, response to mannitol; RO, response to
  osmotic stress; RW, response to wounding; RD, root dehydration; Cont., control).
