caption: Pathways between Gpa1 to Prp39 predicted by our method. Two pathways are
  inferred. Pathway 1 is the pheromone signaling pathway identified by both Tu et
  al.'s method and the information flow model. Pathway 2 is identified only by the
  information flow model. It regulates the recovery from the pheromone arrest.
