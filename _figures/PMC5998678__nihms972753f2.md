caption: The normal oesophageal squamous epithelial proliferative basal cells (p63+
  and SRY-box 2 (SOX2)+) undergo early and terminal differentiation as they migrate
  towards the luminal surface. In concert with acid or bile reflux and pro-inflammatory
  stimuli (for example, interleukin 6 (IL-6)–signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3)), incomplete intestinal metaplasia (presence of columnar cells and goblet
  cells and absence of Paneth cells and enteroendocrine cells) appears. Goblet cells
  produce mucins, which are cytoprotective. Mesenchymal homeobox protein BarH-like
  1 (BARX1) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) (induced by epithelial sonic hedgehog
  (SHH)) are critical for the transition from the squamous cell lineage to the intestinal
  (columnar) cell lineage. Caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) is critical for the induction
  of columnar cells, and Notch signalling is a key pathway for the maintenance of
  the columnar cell lineage. Genomic studies have revealed thatTP53 mutation is important
  in the earliest dysplastic clones. In this figure, the underlying premise is on
  the morphological and molecular changes that occur, but the cell of origin is not
  implied.
