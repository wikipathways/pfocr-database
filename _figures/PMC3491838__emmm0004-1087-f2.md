caption: 'Metabolites are shown in plain text and enzymes in blue boxes. Abbreviations
  for enzymes are as follows: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; NAMPT, nicotinamide
  phosphoribosyl transferase; NMNAT, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase;
  NAPRT, nicotinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase; NADS, NAD synthase. PARP reactions
  require β-NAD+ as a substrate and generate nicotinamide as a by-product of the PARSylation
  of proteins. In cells where PARPs are highly active, β-NAD+ is largely provided
  by a salvage pathway that utilizes nicotinamide. Nicotinamide is processed back
  to β-NAD+ by two enzymes, NAMPT and NMNAT, with NAMPT catalysis representing the
  rate limiting step in this process. Alternatively, β-NAD+ can be synthesized de
  novo from either nutritional tryptophan (via the kynurenine pathway) or via NA,
  which is processed by NAPRT, NMNAT and NADS.'
