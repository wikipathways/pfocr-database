caption: N- and C-terminal cleavage of the PC1 protein. The N terminus of PC1 is cleaved
  at the G protein–coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS), but the extracellular
  domain remains noncovalently attached to the membrane-bound portion of the protein.
  Either of two different cleavages can release C-terminal tail fragments that translocate
  to the nucleus with components of the Wnt pathway, STAT6/p100, and perhaps with
  other regulators of transcription. At least one of the C-terminal tail cleavages
  is stimulated by the presence of PC2, and this stimulation requires that PC2 be
  capable of functioning as an ion channel.
