caption: Schematic representation of the phenylpropanoid pathway, showing the key
  intermediates and enzymes associated with isoflavone biosynthesis, and partial regulation
  pathway. Isoflavones are biosynthesized via a phenylalanine-dependent pathway in
  the presence of a wide range of enzymes. Regarding regulation, GmMYB29 activates
  chalcone synthase (CHS) expression, whereas GmMYB176 inhibits CHS expression. Furthermore,
  Gma-miRNA26, Gma-miRNA269, and Gma-miRNA28 suppress the gene expression or enzymatic
  activity of 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), isoflavone synthase (IFS), and glucosyltransferase
  (GT), respectively. Dotted lines represent the unclear role of miRNA in the pathway
  [,]. This isoflavone biosynthetic pathway is adapted from “USDA Database for the
  Isoflavone Content of Selected Foods Release 2.0 (http://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata;
