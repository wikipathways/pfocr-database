caption: A proposed regulatory loop of BMP9 enhanced osteogenesis and angiogenesis
  of hAMSCs cocultured with HUVECs. BMP9 upregulates the osteogenic relative factors
  such as OPN, OCN, Runx2, BSP, and COL-I in hAMSCs, and increases the expression
  of angiogenic factors VEGF, vWF, CD31, and ANT-1 in HUVECs. Hence, BMP9 potentiates
  only osteogenic also angiogenic differentiation by coculturing hAMSCs with HUVECs.
  This coupling effect of osteogenesis and angiogenesis may lead to efficient bone
  matrix formation and ossification, and BMP9 exerts its osteogenic and angiogenic
  functions via BMP/Smad1/5/8 and PI3K/AKT/m-TOR signaling pathways.
