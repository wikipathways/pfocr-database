caption: Graphical representation of organohalogen exposure to mitochondrial disease
  AOP. Key events at the molecular and cellular levels lead to AOs at the tissue/organ
  and individual levels. Exposure to organohalogens cause increased ROS production
  (Molecular Initiating Event, MIE), triggering the key events (KEs) that result in
  the adverse outcome (AO), defined as the onset of mitochondrial disease and the
  associated symptoms of organ symptom dysfunction. This AOP depicts 2 distinct pathways
  from MIE to AO.
