caption: The nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling pathway.
  NRF2 strongly binds to its cytoplasmic inhibitor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
  1 (KEAP1) under homeostatic conditions and only low levels of NRF2 are present in
  the nucleus. In response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or electrophiles,
  the NRF2-KEAP1 interaction is weakened and newly formed NRF2 accumulates in the
  nucleus. Here, NRF2 dimerizes with small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (MAF) proteins
  and binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoters or enhancers
  of its target genes, of which many encode ROS detoxifying enzymes and other antioxidant
  proteins, thereby initiating a cytoprotective response.
