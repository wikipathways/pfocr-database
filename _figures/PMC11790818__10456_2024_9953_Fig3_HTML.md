caption: The Notch signaling pathway. The Notch receptor is transcribed and translated
  and the polypeptide exported from the cell, where serine and threonine residues
  within the epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats of the extracellular domain are
  O-fucosylated and/or O-glucosylated by the enzymes Pofut and Poglut, respectively,
  two essential modifications for generating a fully functional receptor. The receptor
  is further modified by the glycosyltransferase Fringe, as well as xylotransferases,
  and this “sugar code” on the EGF repeats of the extracellular domain of Notch alters
  the affinity of the receptor for different ligands. While in the golgi, the polypeptide
  is proteolytically cleaved by Furin (S1). The cleaved heterodimer is assembled and
  held together via non-covalent interactions and trafficked to the cell surface.
  Binding to one of the Delta, Serrate, or Jagged (DSL) ligands on an adjacent cell
  leads to receptor activation via juxtacrine signaling. Briefly, ligand tension and
  subsequent endocytosis generate the force necessary to induce a conformational change
  in the bound receptor that exposes site 2 (S2) for cleavage by ADAM metalloproteases.
  This cleavage generates the membrane anchored Notch extracellular truncation (NEXT)
  fragment, a substrate for the γ-secretase complex. γ-secretase cleavage at site
  3 (S3) and (S4) results in release of the Nβ peptide and the Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD). In the absence of Notch signaling, RBPjκ (CBF1/CSL/Su(H)/Lag-1) associates
  with corepressor proteins and histone deacetylases to repress transcription of target
  genes. Following ligand activation and receptor cleavage, the NICD translocates
  to the nucleus and binds to RBPjκ to displace the repressors and recruit the coactivator
  Mastermind (MAML), which in turn recruits additional coactivators to stimulate transcription.Adapted
