caption: Regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by MALT1 and BIRC3-MALT1. a Overview
  of MALT1-dependent activation and regulation of the NF-κB pathway via its adaptor
  and protease functions. Through its adaptor functions, it recruits the CARD11/BCL10/TRAF6
  complex, which results in polyubiquitination and degradation of NEMO, thereby activating
  the IKK complex, which phosphorylates IκB and activates NF-κB. MALT1 protease activity
  controls NF-κB activation by promoting the degradation of both positive (HOIL1,
  RelB, BCL10) and negative (TNFAIP3, CYLD) regulators of this pathway. b The chimeric
  fusion protein BIRC3-MALT1 is created by the chromosomal translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21)
  in extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. The oncogenic potential of BIRC3-MALT1 relies
  on its ability to activate both the canonical and non-canonical pathways through
  multiple mechanisms. BIRC3-MALT1 is activated through auto-oligomerization, which
  results in the recruitment of TRAF2/RIP1 via the BIRC3 moiety that triggers RIP1
  ubiquitination and canonical NF-κB activation. In addition, recruitment of TRAF6/TAB/TAK1
  induces NEMO ubiquitination and also canonical NF-κB signaling. In parallel, BIRC3-MALT1
  causes deregulated MALT1 paracaspase activity, which results in proteolytic cleavage
  of NIK, creating a constitutively active NIK fragment that stimulates IKKα and the
  non-canonical NF-κB pathway
