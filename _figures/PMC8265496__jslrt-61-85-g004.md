caption: Representative signaling pathways of TLR7 and TLR9 in PDCs in NEL. TLR7 and
  TLR9 present in the ER of PDCs under normal conditions, but when pathogens invade
  the host, TLR7 and TLR9 migrate to endolysosomes and recognize them quickly. Overexpression
  of TRL7 recruits adaptor molecular complexes such as MyD88 and other proteins. Later,
  it induces the production of IFN-α. This signaling pathway is important for host
  defense against pathogens such as viruses. *PAMP; pathogen-associated molecular
  pattern. TLR7(9); Toll-like receptor 7(9).
