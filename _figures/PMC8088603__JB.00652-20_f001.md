caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of polyamines in E. coli K-12. Putrescine is synthesized
  through two pathways: generated from ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase (SpeC
  and SpeF) or from arginine by the sequential reactions of arginine decarboxylase
  (SpeA and AdiA) and agmatinase (SpeB). Since SpeB is the only agmatinase in E. coli,
  ΔspeB strains cannot make putrescine even when AdiA is present. Both SpeF and AdiA
  are activated only at low pH. In fact, we did not observe agmatine accumulation
  in the cells in this study. Spermidine is synthesized from putrescine through a
  SpeD-SpeE-dependent mechanism, and cadaverine is synthesized from lysine by lysine
  decarboxylase (CadA and LdcC) or SpeC. Spermidine acetyltransferase (SpeG) and glutathionylspermidine
  synthetase/amidase (Gss) convert spermidine to acetylspermidine and glutathionylspermidine,
  respectively. The AdiC antiporter takes up extracellular arginine and excretes intracellular
  agmatine into the medium. Spermidine is excreted by the MdtJI transporter and imported
  by the PotABCD spermidine-preferential ATP-binding cassette transporter.'
