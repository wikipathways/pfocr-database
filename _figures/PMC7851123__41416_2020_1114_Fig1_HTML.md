caption: a DNA damage response is coordinated by different proteins which functions
  may be categorised in a simplified way as DNA damage sensors, transducers and effectors.
  DNA damage can be detected by γ-H2AX and MRN complex (sensors), which activate ATM
  and ATR. ATM and ATR are key signal transducers of downstream DDR pathways. They
  activate cell-cycle regulators CHK1 and CHK2 (encoded by CHEK1 and CHEK2, respectively),
  which in turn signal downstream checkpoints that finally induce the activation of
  p53. This tumour suppressor determines if the cell initiates cell cycle, DNA repair
  mechanisms or undergoes apoptosis, depending on the DNA damage and/or DNA repair
  efficacy. b DNA-damaging agents may cause a range of different DNA lesions, which
  are repaired by a specific mechanism. ATR, ATM and CHK1/2 are kinases involved in
  the response to several types of DNA damage. Therefore, the inhibition of these
  kinases may be effective in certain tumours with DDR alterations or increase the
  activity or other agents causing DNA damage (i.e. platin salts). Similarly, DNA-PKc
  is a kinase involved in the NHEJ pathway, which inhibition by targeted drugs is
  also being tested in multiple tumours including prostate cancer. Platin salts (i.e.
  cisplatin or carboplatin) induce intra- and interstrand DNA crosslinks. These alterations
  require the coordinated action of HR, NHEJ and NER pathways to be repaired. When
  the function of genes involved in DNA repair pathway are altered (either in the
  somatic or in the germline), the cytotoxic effect of platinum chemotherapy could
  not be repaired, resulting in apoptotic cell death. PARP inhibitors interact with
  PARP, inhibiting its function. This result in the accumulation of single-strand
  breaks, which in turn leads to double-strand breaks (DSBs) formation. “Normal” cells
  have the ability to repair DSBs; however, these cannot be repaired in the presence
  of alterations in the function of genes involved in HR pathway (BRCA1/2, PALB2,
  FA family) (synthetic lethality). MMR deficiency leads to the accumulation of somatic
  mutations, and hence, more potential neoantigens. Higher somatic mutations and neoantigens
  have been correlated with better responses to immunotherapy.
