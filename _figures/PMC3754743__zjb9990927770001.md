caption: Biotin synthesis and uptake in E. coli wild-type and ΔbioH ΔyigM::Km strains.
  (A) Wild type. BioC targets a portion of malonyl-ACP to biotin synthesis by converting
  it to malonyl-ACP methyl ester (). Two rounds (condensation with malonyl-ACP and
  decarboxylation, reduction, dehydration, and reduction) of the fatty acid biosynthesis
  pathway result in pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester. The latter compound is converted into
  pimeloyl-ACP by the BioH methyl esterase. Biotin is produced from that intermediate
  in a universal four-step path via 7-oxo-8-aminononanic acid (7-keto-8-aminopelargonic
  acid [KAPA]), 7,8-diaminononanic acid (7,8-diaminopelargonic acid [DAPA]) and dethiobiotin.
  See reference  for a review of biotin biosynthesis. YigM has recently been identified
  as the long-sought-after high-affinity biotin transporter (). (B) The ΔbioH ΔyigM::Km
  strain can neither produce nor take up biotin since bioH and yigM are deleted. PimA-producing
  recombinants are predicted to grow on pimelic acid provided that this compound enters
  the cells and pimeloyl-CoA (the product of the PimA-catalyzed pimelic acid:coenzyme
  A ligase reaction) serves as a substrate for BioF.
