  UPF1, which leads to a decreased NMD activity resulting in the upregulation of an
  NMD target encoding the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase 14 (MAP 3 K14)

  example in the middle illustrates lower NMD activity due to the downregulation of
  UPF1, which causes the upregulation of several factors of the transforming growth
  factor beta (TGF-β) pathway. This favors the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  and consequently, the number of metastatic events. The example on the right shows
  the interaction between three oncoproteins, STAT3, GLI1 and tGL1, to induce higher

  of the tumor. b Tumor suppressor genes can completely loss their function by PTC
  acquisition and subsequent NMD degradation, combined with either deletion of the
  wild-type allele, or haploinsufficiency of the remaining allele. On the other hand,

  NMD in order to overcome different types of cellular stresses associated with the
  unconstrained growth of the tumor. Stresses such as hypoxia, production of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), or nutrient deprivation promote, eIF2α phosphorylation, which

  stabilized, allowing tumor progression and adaptation. WT: wild type; PTC: premature
