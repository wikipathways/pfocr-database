caption: (A) Biosynthetic pathway of tococromonals-tocopherols and tocotrienols are
  formed from the combination of MEP (methylerythritol phosphate) and shikimate pathways.
  The shikimate pathway gives rise to a chromanol ring from HGA (homogentisate). MEP
  pathway provides the prenyl tail from GGDP (geranylgeranyl diphosphate) and PDP
  (phytyl diphosphate) for the synthesis of tocotrienol and tocopherol, respectively
  (Muñoz and Munne-Bosch, 2019). VTE2 (a homogentisate phytyltransferase) condenses
  PDP and HGA to produce MPBQ (methylphytyl benzoquinol) (Sattler et al., 2004). In
  monocot lineage, HGA can also be condensed with GGDP by HGGT1 (homogentisate geranylgeranyl
  transferase) to generate MGGBQ (methyl geranylgeranyl benzoquinol), the committed
  step for tocotrienol synthesis. MPBQ and MGGBQ are substrates for a series of methylations
  by MPBQ/MGGBQ methyltransferase (VTE3) and γ-tocopherol methyltransferase (VTE4)
  and cyclization by tocopherol cyclase (VTE1) whose sequence and numbers of reactions
  generate the α, β, δ, and γ isoforms of tocopherols and tocotrienols (Muñoz and
  Munne-Bosch, 2019). At the same time, GGDP for tocotrienol synthesis comes directly
  from the isoprenoid pathway. The generation of PDP for tocopherol synthesis is more
  complex and still not completely resolved. Differences in leaf tocopherol synthesis
  exist between monocots and dicots; tocopherol synthesized in seeds requires chlorophyll
  biosynthesis (Diepenbrock et al., 2017; Zhan et al., 2019), and the activity of
  VTE7, an alpha/beta hydrolase that interfaces with chlorophyll synthesis to release
  phytol (Albert et al., 2022). Phytol is then sequentially phosphorylated to PDP
  through the action of phytol kinase (VTE5) and phytol phosphate kinase (VTE6) (Valentin
  et al., 2006; Vom Dorp et al., 2015) (B) Tocopherol contains fully saturated aliphatic
  side chain, while the side chain of tocotrienol contains three extra trans double
  bonds. PC-8 has a similar unsaturated as tocotrienol but a longer side chain, whereas
  tocomonoenol has only one double bond on its side chain (Tian et al., 2007; Sadre
  et al., 2010; Stacey et al., 2016). (C) Tocopherol chemical structures feature a
  chromanol head and a prenyl tail. DMGGBQ, dimethylgeranylgeranylbenzoquinol; DMPBQ,
