caption: 'Interaction of LPS- and virus-induced signalling pathways. Modified according
  to Randall et al. (). Following uptake and replication of RV double stranded RNA
  (dsRNA) is generated. Recognition of dsRNA by cytosolic receptors MDA5 (melanoma
  differentiation-associated protein 5) and RIG-1 (retinoic acid-inducible gene I)
  results in activation of TRIF, followed by activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1),
  an enzyme that catalyses the phosphorylation of IRF-3 (interferon regulatory factor
  3). Phosphorylated IRF-3 then forms dimers, which translocate to the nucleus and
  activate transcription of type I interferon genes (, ). Type I IFN production can
  be amplified by a positive feedback loop (). Secreted IFNs bind and activate the
  type I IFN receptor IFNAR (interferon-alpha/beta IFN-receptor) leading to Stat1
  (signal transducer and activator of transcription) and Stat2 phosphorylation via
  JAK protein kinase JAK1 and Tyk2. After dimerization Stat1 and Stat2 together with
  IRF9 forms the transcription factor complex ISGF3 (interferon-stimulated gene factor
  3) which by binding to ISRE (IFN-stimulated response elements) induces expression
  of IFN-inducible genes (ISGs) (, ). Double stranded RV RNA can also enter endocytotic
  compartments where it is potentially recognized by TLR3. Upon ligand recognition
  TLR3 can recruit TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β) and
  TRAM (TRIF- related adaptor molecule) () which signal for IRF3 activation and IFN-β
  production. IRF3 becomes phosphorylated by TBK1 or IKK1 (IκB kinase 1) (, , ). After
  binding of LPS to the TLR4 complex, signalling occurs via two pathways: the MyD88
  (myeloid differentiation factor 88) -TIRAP (TIR domain containing adaptor protein)
  and the TRAM-TRIF pathway (). The MyD88-TIRAP pathway which is mainly but not entirely
  responsible for induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines involves activation of NFκB
  and AP1 and MAPKs such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase (JNK) () while TRAM and TRIF after internalization of the LPS-TLR4
  complex signal to TBK1 for IRF3 activation and primary IFN production ().'
