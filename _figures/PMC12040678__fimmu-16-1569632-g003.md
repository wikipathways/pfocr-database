caption: Pathogenesis of HMGB1 in psoriasis. When the normal epidermis of patients
  with psoriasis is subjected to external stimuli, such as infection, injury and drug
  stimulation, human high mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1), produced by keratinocytes
  (KCs), is released into the extracellular space via autosecretion, after which it
  activates the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 signalling pathway. The KC inflammasome
  is activated to promote the secretion of interleukin-18 (IL-18) by KCs. Simultaneously,
  the translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm activates the receptor
  for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and the
  phospho- extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (p-ERK1/2) pathways, as well as
  the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6
  (IL-6), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).HMGB1 and IL-18 bind to RAGE and
  interleukin-18 receptor (IL-18R) located on the surface of T cells, respectively,
  which promotes the secretion of interferon-γ (IFNγ) and TNF-α by T helper 1 (Th1)
  cells and that of IL-17 by T helper 17 (Th17) cells. The binding of HMGB1 to TLR4
  on the surface of Th17 cells promotes the transcription of retinoid-associated orphan
  receptor γt (RORγt) and the expression of interleukin-23 (IL-23). Additionally,
  HMGB1 interacts with TLR4 on monocytes, which stimulates the secretion of IL-1β
  and IL-6. IL-1β and IL-6 further enhance Th17 cell differentiation, thereby sustaining
  the inflammatory response. Various cytokines lead to the aggregation of neutrophils,
  gamma delta (γδ) T cells and dendritic cells (DCs), which forms a positive feedback
  loop that accelerates epidermal thickness and disease progression
