caption: 'Schematic representation of ICLs repair by the Fanconi Anemia pathway. The
  protein complex composed of FANCM-MHF1-MHF2 is recruited to the chromatin upon recognition
  of ICL damage. Then, FANCM is activated and allows the recruitment of the core complex
  of the FA pathway composed of: FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL,
  FAAP100, FAAP20 and FAAP24. The core complex contains an ubiquitin E3 ligase activity
  and is responsible for the monoubiquitylation of the ID2 complex composed of FANCI
  and FANCD2 proteins. Monoubiquitinylation of ID2 complex promotes the recruitment
  of the nucleases FANP, FANCQ and FAN1 and end resection at the DNA damage site.
  Depending on the cellular context, recruitment of downstream factors belonging to
  either Homologous Recombination (HR) or to Non-homologous End Joining (NHEJ) will
  finalize the repair.'
