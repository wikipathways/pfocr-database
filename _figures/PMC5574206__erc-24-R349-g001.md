caption: BMP signalling utilises canonical Smad dependant pathways and non-canonical
  Smad-independent pathways. According to combination and sequence of receptor complex
  formation or recruitment if the BMP ligand (two tone sphere) binds to a preformed
  heteromeric receptor complex this results in Smad dependant signalling. The Smad
  1/5/8 complex binds to Smad 4 and translocates to the nucleus whereby they interact
  with transcription factors, or directly binding to DNA to regulate gene transcription.
  If the BMP binds to a type I receptor and recruits the type 2 receptor to the complex,
  Smad-independent signalling results. There are multiple levels of regulation, including
  inhibitory Smads 6 and 7 (I-Smads), pseudoreceptors lacking the serine/threonine
  kinase domain (BAMBI), ubiquitination and degradation (Smurf/Nedd4/RNF11) and target
  gene transcription of negative regulators (such as the BMP antagonists) functioning
  as negative feedback. There are myriad other BMP target genes in breast cancer such
  as ID1, Snail, Zeb1, p21, PTEN, MMPs and ER that affect cancer cell functions. The
  figure was made with pathway builder tools from www.proteinlounge.com. A full colour
  version of the figure is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1530/ERC-17-0139
