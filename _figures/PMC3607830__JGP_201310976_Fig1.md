caption: Hierarchical thermodynamic linkage analysis is used to study ion channel
  gating. (A) A unified thermodynamic linkage cycle for assessing the magnitude and
  sign of interaction between any X and Y protein (P) components. The cycle comprises
  four protein states, one in which no changes occurred in components X and Y (PXY),
  two states in which one of the components has undergone a change (PXY and PXY),
  and a fourth state in which changes occurred in both components (PXY). ΔG1 and ΔG2
  correspond to the free-energy changes for a change in component X to occur, in the
  absence and presence of a change in the second Y component, respectively. The nonadditive
  component of the two changes, as given by ΔG1 − ΔG2 (=Δ2GXY), determines the magnitude
  and sign of the interaction between the X and Y components. (B) An obligatory (subunit)
  channel gating scheme characteristic of the Shaker Kv channel. In this scheme, only
  after all four voltage sensors undergo two transitions (K1(V) and K2(V)) does late
  concerted pore opening (L) occur. C and O denote the closed and open states, respectively.
  (C) Combination of sequential mutant interaction cycles to evaluate changes in the
  interaction free energy between the XY residue pair along the gating pathway described
  in B. In each cycle, the different wild-type (wt) and mutant (m) chemical equilibrium
  constants are indicated above the appropriate channel protein. In the left cycle,
  Δ2GXY(C1→C2) denotes the interaction energy between the XY residue pair in the C2
  channel state relative to the C1 state and is calculated according to −RTln((K1wtK1m1m2)/(K1m1K1m2)).
  The other residue interaction energies are calculated in a similar manner. In all
  schemes, arrows represent equilibrium between the states connected.
