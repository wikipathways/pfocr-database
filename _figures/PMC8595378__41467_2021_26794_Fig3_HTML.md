caption: Key steps include oxidative addition of Ar–Br to Ni(0), radical generation
  by SET from nickel to the alkyl bromide, Giese addition of the alkyl radical to
  the acrylate, trapping of the α-carbonyl radical by Ni(II) to give Ni(III), which
  undergoes reductive elimination to give the product. The photocatalytic cycle involves
  reduction of 4CzIPN to 4CzIPN–, which is proposed to reduce the Ni catalyst to Ni(0).
