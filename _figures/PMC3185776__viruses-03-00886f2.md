caption: Tax targets the NFκB pathway. A simplified schematic of NFκB signaling pathways
  highlighting regulatory proteins commonly targeted by viruses [,,]. HTLV-1 Tax targets
  the pathway at several points. (a) Tax leads to the activation of receptor-associated
  kinases that signal through the NFκB pathway [,]. (b) Tax directly binds to IKKγ
  (NEMO) which leads to constitutive phosphorylation and degradation of the NFκB repressor
  IκB []. (c) Tax activates and recruits IKKα to p100 stimulating phosphorylation,
  ubiquitination, and processing to p52 leading to nuclear translocation []. (d) Tax
  alters binding or recognition of a variety of transcription factors and DNA binding
  proteins increasing the number of genes regulated by the NFκB pathway [].
