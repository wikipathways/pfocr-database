caption: The canonical pathway is activated by cytokines such as TNF-α. When TNF-α
  binds to the its receptor 1 (TNFR1), a signaling complex is formed to recruit and
  activate IKK, which leads to phosphorylation on IκB. IκB is subsequently ubiquitinated
  and degradated in the proteasome, resulting in NF-κB complex (p65/p50) translocation
  to the nucleus and activates gene transcription. The noncanonical pathway is activated
  by cytokines such as CD40L and lymphotoxin β. This pathway involves NIK-mediated
  IKKα activation and cleavage of p100 to create p52. The NF-κB complex (p52/RelB)
  moves to the nucleus to activate gene transcription. The atypical pathway is activated
  by a variety of stimuli such as UV. In this parhway, IKK-independent mechanisms
  are involved in IκB phosphorylation. Representative antiapoptotic factors induced
  by NF-κB are shown.
