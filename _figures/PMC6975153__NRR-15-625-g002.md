caption: 'Multiple pathways for oxidative stress in diabetes.During diabetes, there
  is an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production due to cytosolic increased
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity, dysfunctional mitochondrial
  electron transport chain and a reduction of cellular antioxidant capacity, such
  as glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), leading to oxidative stress.
  Oxidative stress leads to DNA damage, which activates DNA repair enzymes, such as
  poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP). This results in ADP increase
  and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) inhibition. The impairment of GAPDH
  results in glycolytic intermediates accumulation. Consequently, these molecules
  are used in other biochemical pathways, such pollyol and hexosamine pathways, advanced
  glycation end product (AGE) formation and also increase protein kinase C (PKC) activation.
  All these pathways are associated with an increase in oxidative stress, leading
  to a positive-feedback of ROS production. Nrf2 is a transcriptional factor that
  is associated to an antioxidative response. In that way, activation of Nrf2 pathway
  could be a possible mechanism to break the vicious cycle of ROS production in diabetic
  retinopathy development. ETC: Electron transport chain.'
