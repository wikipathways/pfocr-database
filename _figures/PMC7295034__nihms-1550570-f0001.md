caption: 'NO signaling microdomains can be found either on the luminal side of the
  EC cell membrane, or between cells as junctional complexes and MEJs. Mechanical
  forces or receptor activating substrates lead to the activation of NO signaling
  at those signaling microdomains. As demonstrated in this figure, eNOS is activated
  downstream of extracellular signals ,channel activation, or shear stress, which
  all ultimately either increase intracellular Ca2+, alter eNOS phosphorylation, or
  provide more substrate . On the luminal surface of EC membranes, shear stress activated
  ion channels, the glycocalyx, GPCR and Cav-1 can lead to an influx of calcium, activating
  eNOS by the Ca2+/CAM-pathway. The direct association of Cav-1 to eNOS in contrast
  inhibits the enzyme activity. Heat shock proteins (HSP) are binding partners of
  eNOS, increasing the activity (HSP90) or downregulating activity (HSP70) via CHIP
  and trafficking eNOS into the Golgi complex. Integrins bind to collagen and laminin,
  activating eNOS via the PI3-aktkinase pathway. Moreover, influences the polymerization
  state of actin filaments the eNOS activity. Between EC are junctional complexes,
  regulating eNOS via PYK-2 or PI3-akt-kinase pathway. In resistance vessels, MEJ
  are a heterocellular communication microdomain between EC and SMC. Hemoglobin α,
  enriched in MEJ, forms a complex with eNOS and the reductase CytB5R3. The diffusion
  of eNOS generated NO is tightly dependent of the redox state of Hbα. When Hbα resides
  in the Fe3+ state, NO is able to diffuse to the smooth muscle cell layer; however,
  if it is reduced to Fe2+ by CytB5R3, NO will be scavenged by Hbα. CAT-1 is sensitive
  to shear stress, increasing the transport velocity of L-Arginine, the substrate
  for eNOS. GPCR: G-protein coupled receptor, PKA: protein kinase a, PKB: protein
  kinase B, CaM:Calmodulin, PYK2: proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, HSP: heat shock
  protein, CHIP: C-terminal Hsp70-interacting protein, CAT-1: cationic amino acid
  transporter, CytB5R3: cytochrome b 5 reductase 3, MEJ: MEJs, NO: nitric oxide.'
