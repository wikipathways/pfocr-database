caption: '(A) TCRs and Lck molecules in resting T cells constantly traffic through
  early endosomes during normal physiological conditions. At the time of activation
  of T cells by antigen, TCR and Lck molecules are trafficked to the immunological
  synapse through polarized reprocessing. (B) When the cells are infected with HIV-1,
  Nef mediates alteration of intracellular trafficking of Lck and TCR–CD3. TCRs accumulate
  in recycling endosomes and their expression is slightly increased at the cell surface
  due to the slowing down of trafficking at both the recycling and endocytic steps.
  Nef stimulates the intracellular accumulation of Lck, inhibiting the process of
  Lck translocation from recycling endosomes to the immunological synapse to prolong
  signal transduction. HIV-1 particles represent all stages of the viral replicative
  cycle.TCR: T-cell receptor.'
