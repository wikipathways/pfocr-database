caption: Delayed cell death signalling pathways mediate the effects of hypoxia-ischaemia
  in the brain. The extrinsic pathway mirrors the cells’ external environment and
  begins when inflammatory cytokines (to the right of the figure at the cell surface)
  bind to and activate Fas-cell death receptors, whereas the intrinisic pathway is
  activated when signals released from within stressed mitochondria activate caspase
  and non-caspase-mediated-cell-death pathways within the nucleus. These two cell-death
  pathways activate common signalling networks within the mitochondria and the nucleus.
  Mitochondria exposed to caspase-induced stress can release cytochrome C through
  channels formed by the Bax and Bak proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane
  (caspase-mediated cell death) or can release apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), which
  activates DNA fragmentation directly (non-caspase pathway). Cytochrome C can combine
  with Apaf1 and caspase 9 to form the apoptosome, which triggers activation of caspase
  3. DNA breaks mediated by free radicals such as nitric oxide (NO·) and peroxynitrite
  activate poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1), which consumes NAD+ and worsens the
  energy shortage for mitochondria (shown within the nucleus). Convergence of signalling
  for the extrinsic (Fas) and intrinsic cell-death pathways are responsible for the
  interaction between infection (endotoxin) and hypoxia-ischaemia that increases cell
  death. Vm=membrane potential. VSSC=voltage sensitive calcium channel. Fas=death
  receptor in tumour necrosis factor family. FADD=fas adaptor death domain protein.
  BclXL=antiapoptotic proteins in the Bcl2 family of proteins. Bax and Bak=proapoptotic
  proteins that form channels in outer mitochondrial membrane releasing cytochorome
  C to trigger apoptosis. tBid=truncated BH3-only proapoptotic protein. Apaf1=apoptotic
  protein activating factor 1. SMAC=antagonist of inhibitor of apoptosis. IAP=inhibitor
  of apoptosis. CAD=caspase activating DNAse. Cyt C=cytochrome C. nNOS=neuronal nitric
  oxide synthase. NO=nitric oxide. ROS=reactive oxygen species. PARP1=poly-ADP-ribose

  an antioxidant. AIF=apoptosis-inducing factor. Bid=BH3 interacting domain proapoptotic
  protein. NAD=nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. FASL=Fas death receptor ligand.
