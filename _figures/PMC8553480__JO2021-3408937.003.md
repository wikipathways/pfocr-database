caption: This schematic figure represents the main miRNAs and gene targets involved
  in the biological processes of ovarian cancer. miR-200 family are abundantly expressed
  in epithelial tissues. This miRNA induces the expression of CD44, which plays a
  key role in cell-to-cell interactions, adhesion, and migration. The cluster of the
  miR-23a is involved in the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer through
  affecting transcription factors like NF-κB and WNT pathway, regulating the transcription
  of various genes involved in cytokine production, cell survival, proliferation,
  and differentiation. miR-205 targets many biological processes like proliferation,
  differentiation, and migration and facilitates apoptosis in some ovarian cancer
  cells.
