caption: A working model for the mechanism of quercetin on HCC. Quercetin induces
  caspase‐dependent cell apoptosis and inhibits the proliferation of HCC cells. Furthermore,
  Quercetin can significantly reduce the expression of P4HA2, and downregulating P4HA2
  expression significantly enhances the anti‐tumor effect of quercetin. In addition,
  inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a crucial role in quercetin‐induced
  apoptosis. In the upstream, quercetin‐induced upregulation of P4HA2 inhibits the
  activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Altogether, quercetin induces HCC cell
  apoptosis by downregulating P4HA2 and inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR, suggesting that
  Quercetin has excellent potential as a new strategy for treating HCC
