caption: A model for the role of CREB and ICER in the regulation of  GABRA1 expression.
  Activation of the PKC pathway leads to  phosphorylation of CREB without induction
  of ICER. Phosphorylated CREB at  Ser-133 forms homodimers to increase GABRA1 expression  (left).
  Activation of the PKA pathway induces synthesis of ICER and  phosphorylation of
  CREB. Homodimers of ICER or ICER and CREB heterodimers  repress transcription of
  GABRA1 (right) and alter the number  of α1 containing GABAARs (α1-GABAR) at the
  cell  surface. None α1 subunit containing receptors are as indicated by  “αx” key.
