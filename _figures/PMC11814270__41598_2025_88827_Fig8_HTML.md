caption: 'Working-hypothesis: Schematic diagram of the metabolic pathways altered
  by a shift from S-HD to E-HD. Relatively enhanced metabolic pathways, i.e., glycolysis,
  and fatty acid metabolism in S-HD, are suppressed in E-HD, while relatively suppressed
  citric acid cycle in S-HD, is ameliorated in E-HD (a). Glutathion synsethis is facilitated
  in E-HD as compared to S-HD (b). S-HD: standard hemodialysis, E-HD: electrolyzed
  water hemodialysis'
