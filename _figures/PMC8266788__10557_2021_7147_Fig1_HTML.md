caption: Mechanism of action and physiologic sites of bempedoic acid metabolism, activation,
  biologic activity, and clearance. Following oral administration, bempedoic acid
  is converted to its active metabolite bempedoyl-CoA by ASCVL1 in the liver. Bempedoyl-CoA
  inhibits the cytoplasmic ACL enzyme, which converts citrate to acetyl-CoA in the
  cholesterol synthesis pathway, leading to upregulation of LDLR. ASCVL1 is not present
  in the muscle so is not converted to bempedoyl-CoA. Clearance of bempedoic acid
  and bempedoyl-CoA is primarily enacted by glucuronidation and subsequent renal elimination.
  Bempedoic acid is a weak inhibitor of OAT2, resulting in minor increases in plasma
  uric acid and creatinine. ACL ATP-citrate lyase, ASCVL1 very long-chain acyl-CoA
  syntheasae-1, HMGR 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate-CoA reductase, LDL-C low-density
  lipoprotein cholesterol, LDLR low-density lipoprotein receptor, OAT2 organic anion
  transporter-2
