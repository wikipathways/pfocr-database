caption: CD44 interferes with apoptosis resistance in HSC/LIC. (A) Four major pathways
  of RTK-promoted apoptosis protection are shown. (i) CD44–HA binding is accompanied
  by activation of CD44-associated src, ezrin phosphorylation, and PI3K activation,
  and assembly of a complex that includes, in addition, HSP70 and the co-chaperone
  CDC37, which promotes phosphorylation and activation of the ERBB2/ERBB3 RTK. (ii)
  The CD44–ERBB2/ERBB3 complex also provides a strong stimulus for Cox-2 transcription,
  which interferes with caspase3 activation. (iii) CD44v6 binds HGF and presents it
  to MET. Activation of the latter and the downstream signaling cascades require concomitant
  activation of CD44 associated pERM and src. Importantly, joining of signaling via
  the Ras/MAPK and the PI3K/Akt pathway that rely on the CD44 cytoplasmic tail can
  be initiated without any additional stimuli by a CD44v6-assembled matrix. (iv) CD44v3
  binds proHBEGF, which becomes cleaved via CD44-associated MMP7. HBEGF binds and
  activates ERBB4. All of these CD44–RTK associations strongly promote activation
  of signaling cascades that block apoptosis and upregulate anti-apoptotic proteins.
  (B) Oxidative stress promotes merlin phosphorylation and dissociation from CD44.
  Merlin plays an important role in controlling the Hippo pathway. In CD44v expressing
  LIC, merlin is replaced by pERM, such that cIAP becomes increased and caspase3 activation
  does not take place, forcing LIC resistance toward cytotoxic drugs. (C) Particularly
  in HSC residing in the osteogenic niche, it has been observed that CD44-attached
  highMW HA can become internalized together with CD44, where HA acts as a catcher
  of ROI, which protects DNA from damage. (D) MDR proteins are associated with activated
  CD44 (highMW HA-ligated and associated with pERM). Instead, lowMW HA promotes CD44
  and concomitantly MDR internalization, which is accompanied by a significant increase
  in cytotoxic drug sensitivity. Maintenance of the complex between CD44, pERM, actin,
  and MDR-1, as well as the recovery of the S100A/AnnexinII complex indicates internalization
  within caveolae and/or GEM. As far as LIC compete with HSC for the osteogenic niche,
  they will profit from the highMW HA matrix that via CD44 stabilizes MDR proteins
  within the cell membrane contributing to drug resistance.
