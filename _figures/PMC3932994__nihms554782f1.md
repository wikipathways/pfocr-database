caption: The mating response pathway is initiated when the pheromone α factor binds
  to the GPCR Ste2 at the plasma membrane. Ligand binding stimulates the exchange
  of GDP for GTP by Gpa1 and the dissociation of Gpa1 from the Ste4-Ste18 dimer of
  the G protein. Ste4-Ste18 interacts with Ste20 to stimulate the MAPK signaling cascade,
  culminating in the activation of Fus3 and the mating response. During conditions
  of glucose abundance, the Ras and Gpa2 pathways activate PKA, which promotes the
  Glc7-Reg1–dependent dephosphorylation of Gpa1 to maintain an efficient mating response.
  However, when glucose concentrations are limiting, PKA and the Glc7-Reg1 phosphatase
  complex are inactivated. Thus, the kinase Sak1 phosphorylates both Snf1 (the AMPK
  homolog), to initiate metabolic adaptation, and the Gpa1 protein, to reduce mating
  efficiency. The exact consequences of Gpa1 phosphorylation on G protein signaling
  remain to be determined.
