caption: Targeted Therapeutic Strategies for PDAC. Recent research has led to the
  development of a range of therapeutic agents, including ARHGAP25, Berberine, Shikonin,
  DX3-21B, and Phenformin, which specifically target key enzymes and pathways within
  the glycolytic pathway, as well as mitochondrial complexes, offering promising avenues
  for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treatment. Created in https://BioRender.com
