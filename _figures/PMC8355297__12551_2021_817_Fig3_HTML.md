caption: Active, oncogenic Ras forms nanocluster at the membrane microdomain that
  can serve as a signaling platform. Ras nanocluster recruits Raf kinases to the membrane
  microdomain, promoting Raf kinase domain dimerization, activation, leading to signaling
  via the MAPK (Raf/MEK/ERK) phosphorylation pathway. Monomeric Raf is mainly autoinhibited
  in the cytosol. Ras releases the autoinhibition via the high-affinity interaction
  of Ras with Raf RBD. Inactive, wild-type Ras dilutes the oncogenic Ras nanoclusters.
  The wild type normally exists in the cell in its GDP-bound form. Its intrinsic orientation
  on the membrane surface occludes its effector binding site, which is buried by the
  membrane, abrogating effector binding and suppressing Raf’s activation. The cartoon
  was inspired by previous publication of MAPK suppression by Rap1 (Nussinov et al.
  )
