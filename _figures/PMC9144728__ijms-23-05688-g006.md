caption: 'The Different Outcomes of DSB Repair. When a DSB forms, one of two things
  can occur, (A) DNA end resection can dictate pathway choice. If DNA ends are resected,
  one of three pathways can be used to repair the lesion: Homologous Recombination
  (HR), Single-Strand Annealing (SSA), or Microhomology-mediated End Joining (MMEJ).
  (B) HR repair will continue if the cells are in S/G2 phase and will result in high-fidelity
  and template dependent DSB repair. If there is no sister chromatid available in
  the cell, one of two pathways can be used for repair: MMEJ or SSA. (C) MMEJ involves
  microhomology, ranging from 2 to 20 nucleotides in length and can ultimately result
  in genomic instability in the form of deletions and insertions in chromosomes or
  hypermutagenesis. (D) SSA requires end resection and complementary sequences more
  than 25 nucleotides in length and can generate interchromosomal deletions or translocations.
  (E) If the DNA ends are protected, canonical NHEJ (c-NHEJ) will dominate where Ku70/80
  heterodimer will bind, resulting in minimal end processing, synthesis, and ligation.'
