caption: 'Systemic inflammation through the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway between
  macrophage and microglia. In macrophages, the formation and binding of PAMPs and
  DAMPs to TLRs initiate inflammasome signaling. This pathway comprises two major
  stages: priming and activation. During the priming stage, ligand binding to TLR
  leads to the assembly and phosphorylation of MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6. TRAF6 then
  undergoes K63‐type polyubiquitination, activating TAK1 and the IKK complex through
  phosphorylation. The phosphorylated IKK complex phosphorylates IκB, promoting its
  degradation and enabling the nuclear localization of NF‐κB. This activation of NF‐κB
  triggers the transcription of pro‐IL‐1β, pro‐IL‐18, pro‐CASP‐1, and NLRP3. After
  priming, the connection between NLRP3 and pro‐CASP‐1 is established using the ASC
  adaptor protein to assemble the inflammasome complex, facilitated by ion fluxes
  and/or the binding of PAMPs and DAMPs, along with ROS production. This complex converts
  pro‐CASP‐1 into CASP‐1, which then cleaves GSDMD, pro‐IL‐1β, and pro‐IL‐18, producing
  N‐GSDMD, IL‐1β, and IL‐18. IL‐1β and IL‐18, the key type 1 pro‐inflammatory cytokines,
  are transported through N‐GSDMD and contribute to activating the inflammasome signaling
  pathway in other cells. This signaling cascade is able to transfer from peripheral
  macrophages into the microglia. Secreted IL‐1β and IL‐18 from macrophages stimulate
  the priming signal in microglia by crossing the BBB. Activated microglia then also
  produce IL‐1β and IL‐18, through identical processes, resulting in autocrine signaling
  that enhances microglial activation, promotes neuroinflammation, and contributes
  to the progression of AD. Purple and red * represent the indirect and direct effects
