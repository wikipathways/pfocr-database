caption: Relationship between KNDy neurons, GnRH neurons, and the heat-defence pathway.
  KNDy neurones in the infundibular nucleus secrete the neuropeptides Kiss (encoded
  by the KISS1 gene), NKB (encoded by the TAC3 gene) and Dyn (encoded by the PDYN
  gene). NKB and Dyn act autosynaptically, stimulating and inhibiting further Kiss
  release, respectively. Kiss acts on GnRH neurones. GnRH stimulates LH and FSH release
  from the anterior pituitary which stimulates ovarian sex steroid production. During
  menopause, lack of oestradiol (E2) negative feedback results in increased expression
  of KISS1 and TAC3 mRNA but decreased expression of PDYN mRNA. Consequently, KNDy
  neurones become hypertrophied, as seen by increased size of nuclei/nucleoli and
  increased Nissl substance. KNDy neurones project to the hypothalamic thermoregulatory
  centre (the median POA and adjacent MnPO). During menopause, the increase in NKB
  signalling and overstimulation of KNDy neurons increases activity in the thermoregulatory
  centre which then becomes hypersensitive to external cues from peripheral sensors,
  leading to activation of heat dissipation effectors. KNDy kisspeptin–neurokinin
