caption: A current model for the regulation of BES1/BZR1 degradation by ubiquitination.
  The diagram illustrates that different ubiquitin ligases are induced by various
  conditions, leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of different states of
  BES1/BZR1 through distinct pathways. Under dark conditions, COP1 ubiquitinates the
  phosphorylated BES1/BZR1 for degradation, while under light conditions, SINATs ubiquitinate
  the dephosphorylated BES1/BZR1 for degradation. SL induces MAX2 to ubiquitinate
  BES1/BZR1, and BL in Arabidopsis induces PUB40 to specifically ubiquitinate BES1/BZR1
  in roots, while in rice, it induces OsPUB24 to ubiquitinate BES1/BZR1. Ethylene
  induces EBF1 to ubiquitinate BES1/BZR1. Deubiquitination of BES1/BZR1 is mediated
  by UBP12/UBP13. Under sugar starvation, BAF1 ubiquitinates BES1, specifically binding
  to the autophagy receptor DSK2, leading to degradation within the vacuole through
  selective autophagy. Under sugar starvation conditions, UPL3 affects BZR1 ubiquitination
  and autophagy degradation. In the picture, “U” means ubiquitination
