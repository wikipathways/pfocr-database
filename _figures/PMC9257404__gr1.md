caption: Compartmentalization of sphingolipid metabolism.A, Cer is initially synthesized
  in the ER via the de novo synthesis pathway catalyzed by enzymes including SPT and
  CerS. After transport to the Golgi complex, it is further converted to SM and GlcCer
  by the enzymes SMS and GCS, respectively. GlcCer is then converted to other complex
  GSLs by adding additional carbohydrate groups. SM and GSLs are delivered to plasma
  membranes via vesicular transport. For breakdown, SM and GSLs are transported to
  lysosomes, where they are degraded to Cer by the actions of enzymes such as SMase
  and GCase. Cer is further degraded to Sph that is released to the cytoplasm for
  producing Cer and S1P. B, the structures of the sphingolipid subclasses. CDase,
  ceramidase; Cer, ceramide; CERT, ceramide transfer protein; CerS, ceramide synthase;
