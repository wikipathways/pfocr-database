caption: Lactate metabolism and lactylation in cells. Lactate is produced from the
  decomposition of glycolysis in the cytoplasm. In one pathway, pyruvate, produced
  during glycolysis, enters the mitochondria and is metabolized through the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle. In the other pathway, pyruvate produced by glycolysis is converted to
  lactate by the action of lactate dehydrogenase. Lactate is also the precursor of
  gluconeogenesis. Histones and nonhistone proteins are lactylated by lactyl-CoA,
  which is derived from lactate. In septic conditions, an increase in lactate is associated
  with mitochondrial dysfunction, systemic inflammation, decreased tissue perfusion,
  and liver dysfunction. (by figdraw.com)
