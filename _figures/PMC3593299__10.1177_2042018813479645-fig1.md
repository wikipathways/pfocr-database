caption: 'Potential ghrelin neuroprotective pathways in Parkinson’s disease. MPTP
  (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) is a model of Parkinson’s disease
  (PD) and recapitulates the disease via inhibition of complex I in the mitochondria
  resulting in increased oxygen free radicals and reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
  production. It also acts on microglia by stimulating pro-inflammatory cytokines
  to enhance the removal of damaged neurons. MPTP crosses the blood–brain barrier
  and is converted into its toxic form MPP+, which enters the dopamine (DA) neuron
  via the dopamine transporter (DAT), making it selective for DA neurons. Ghrelin
  reduces the inflammatory component of microglial activation observed in PD and also
  binds to the GHSR receptor to ultimately enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and reduce
  oxidative stress via UCP2. Ghrelin increases the activity of UCP2 thus reducing
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress. Ghrelin may also
  act via pAMPK to inhibit mTOR and phosphorylate Ulk1 and enhance autophagy. Dysfunction
  autophagy, as seen in Atg-7 deficient DA neurons, accelerates a PD phenotype in
  mice. Other downstream actions of pAMPK involve enhanced SIRT1 activity, to elevate
  the activity of its downstream target PGC-1α and increase mitochondrial biogenesis.
  There are many known genetic mutations linked to PD highlighted in red. Many of
  these are involved in removal of damaged mitochondria, for example the PINK1/Parkin
  pathway. Damaged mitochondria (depicted with a lightning bolt) attract PINK1 around
  the damaged organelle. This recruits Parkin from the cytosol and initiates mitophagy.
  Parkin is involved in reducing mtDNA mutations by enhancing the actions of TFAM
  and also responsible for maintaining mitochondrial biogenesis by reducing the amount
  of PARIS in dopaminergic cells. PARIS represses PGC-1α leading to a reduction in
  mitochondrial biogenesis. Another known gene mutation that results in repression
  of PGC-1a is alpha synuclein, this is the main pathological hallmark of PD. Any
  agent that enhances the removal of alpha synuclein is protective in PD, one such
  example is Atg-7. Another genetic mutation linked to PD is LRRK2 which is responsible
  for an increase in autophagy and may also interact with AMPK via CaMKKβ. Together
  this picture illustrates that ghrelin has two main functions: (1) a reduction in
  oxidative stress via enhanced UCP2 activation and (2) enhanced autophagy; however,
  it is unknown whether ghrelin, via the action of pAMPK, is connected to enhanced
  mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin pathway. Further research will be required to determine
  whether there is a link.'
