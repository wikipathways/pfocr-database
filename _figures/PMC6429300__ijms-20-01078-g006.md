caption: Leptin increased the expression of cPLA2/COX-2 together with accumulation
  of leukocytes via the NADPH oxidase/ROS/AP-1 pathway. According to the results and
  literature surveys, leptin promoted the activation of NADPH oxidase, resulting in
  the accumulation of intracellular ROS. The increase of oxidative stress contributed
  to the phosphorylation of c-Jun in leptin-stimulated lung tissue. In response to
  the leptin stimulation, activated AP-1 upregulated the expression of cPLA2 and COX-2
  genes, contributing to leukocyte recruitment and lung inflammation. The solid arrows
  represented a step in an activating pathway. Dashed arrows represented the uncertain
  mechanism that needs to be evaluated in the future.
