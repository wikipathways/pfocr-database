caption: 'A. Soma: E-L system proteins that form structural and functional components
  are synthesized in the neuronal soma. Following production in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) and post-translational modifications in the Golgi apparatus, proteins (e.g.
  lysosomal hydrolases) are packed into vesicles and delivered to the trans-Golgi
  network (TGN). In the TGN, based on the nature of post-translational modification,
  the vesicles are diverted either towards lysosomes (black arrows) or to the secretory
  pathway (red arrows). Vesicles that are destined for lysosomes bud off from the
  TGN to form early endosomes. Simultaneously, early endosomes carrying nutrients
  and surface receptors for recycling are also derived from the plasma membrane through
  clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME, purple arrows). These early endosomes, with
  the help of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), pass through
  highly dynamic tubulovesicular structures like multivesicular bodies (MVB) and/or
  late endosomes before fusing with lysosomes. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)
  plays a significant role in this sorting, whereas Glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA) and
  ATPase cation transporting 13A2 (ATP13A2) are crucial for normal lysosomal function.
  Early endosomes from the cell surface that are not sorted follow the recycling pathway
  back to the plasma membrane (blue arrows). Retrograde transport of receptors that
  are used for sorting from early endosomes to TGN occurs through the retromer complex
  where Vacuolar Protein Sorting 35 (VPS35) and VPS13C take part (yellow arrows).
  An expanding membrane sac called a phagophore sequesters malfunctioning organelles
  (e.g. sick mitochondria) and misfolded proteins to form a double-membraned autophagosomes.
  These later fuses with lysosomes and releases its contents for degradation and recycling
  of components; the complete process is called autophagy (green arrows). PTEN Induced
  Putative Kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin are important in identifying sick mitochondria
  and diverting them to a specialized form of autophagy called mitophagy.B. Axon:
  Axons form a crucial bridge for retrograde transport of endosomes/autophagosomes
  from presynaptic terminals to soma for lysosomal degradation. A gradual development
  of phagophore to full-fledged autophagosome happens within the axon (green arrows)
  as the encapsulated cargo arrives towards proximal end.C. Synapse: Neurotransmitter
  release in the presynaptic terminal is regulated principally by the synaptic vesicle
  cycle, an integral part of the neuronal E-L system. Initially, endosomes derived
  from the soma forms synaptic vesicles (SV) in the nerve terminal where RME-8 plays
  a role in association with clathrin (yellow arrow). Neurotransmitters are loaded
  into these SVs through specialized transporters. Upon arrival of an action potential
  in the synaptic terminal, these SVs fuse with the plasma membrane at active sites
  and release neurotransmitters via exocytosis (black arrows). Empty SVs are then
  recycled through CME (Purple arrows). α-Synuclein and endophilin A play roles here
  in membrane bending and SV curvature formation. Clathrin forms a layer on these
  invaginations with the help of adaptors, and in conjunction with dynamin leads to
  membrane fission forming clathrin coated vesicles (CCV). Clathrin uncoating is a
  prerequisite for SV recycling, which is performed by coordinated action of auxilin,
  Hsc70, endothelin A1, and synaptojanin 1. Phosphorylation by LRRK2 is necessary
  for activation of these proteins. Synaptic autophagy and mitophagy are also crucial
  in maintaining the health of the presynaptic terminal (green arrows), where PINK1/Parkin
  are crucial.'
