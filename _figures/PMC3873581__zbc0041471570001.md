  pathway. A, organization of the roquefortine/meleagrin biosynthetic gene cluster.
  B, proposed roquefortine/meleagrin pathway. Numbers between brackets are compound
  identifiers used throughout this study. Enzymatic catalyzed reactions are indicated
  by solid arrows, whereas chemical reactions are indicated by dashed arrows. Structures
  shown in brackets could not be detected, whereas gray reactions and compounds were
  previously proposed for various Penicillium species (, , ).
