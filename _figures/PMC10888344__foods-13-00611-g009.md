caption: Potential molecular mechanism that drives the positive impact of CSE in OVA-induced
  AR mouse model. Allergen exposure stimulates the release of IL-33 from the nucleus
  of necrotic cells and its subsequent accumulation in extracellular space. Here,
  IL-33 interacts with membrane-bound ST2 receptor via its cytokine domain in response
  to cellular injury. This triggers Th2 immune responses and stimulates the differentiation
  of Th0 cells to Th2 cells. This cascade enhances the recruitment of immune cells
  such as eosinophils and mast cells to the airways. Moreover, Th2 cells suppress
  the transcription of tight junction proteins such as E-cadherin, occludin, and ZO-1.
  In conjunction with the cytokines secreted by Th2 cells, leukocytes are recruited
  and activated, thus resulting in allergic inflammatory symptoms. However, CSE can
  significantly inhibit IL-33 levels and subsequent ST2 in OVA-induced AR mice, indicating
  that CSE can provide a protective effect against OVA-induced AR by regulating the
  infiltration of inflammatory cells, accumulation of mucus, and OVA-specific immunoglobulins.
  These multiple forms of interference by CSE modulate the IL-33/ST2/Th2 signaling
  pathway
