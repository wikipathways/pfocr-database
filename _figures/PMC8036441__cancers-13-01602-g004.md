caption: Quercetin targeting via phase II enzyme pathway mediated through Nrf-2. When
  the cells are unstimulated under stress conditions, Keap-1 isolates Nrf-2 and exposes
  it to cul-e dependent ubiquitin ligase. This enzyme leads to the proteasomal cleavage
  of Nrf-2. In the meantime, quercetin degrades the Nrf-2 keap-1 complex and shifts
  the Nrf2 to the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, Nrf-2 binds to ARE, resulting in the
  production of phase II enzymes via Nrf-2 associated expression. NrF-2, nuclear factor
  erythroid 2 related factor-2; Ub, ubiquitin; ARE, anti-oxidant response element.
  Human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and duodenal adenocarcinoma HuTu 80 cells
  were further identified as receiving a quercetin triggered boost in phase II oxidative
  stress (detoxification enzymes). Additionally, the time-dependent influence of quercetin
  on the transcriptional regulation of Nrf2 and its increased mRNA and protein expression
  was consistently observed in HepG2 and malignant mesothelioma cells [].
