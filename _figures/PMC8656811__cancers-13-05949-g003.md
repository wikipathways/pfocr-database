caption: A simplified scheme of B-cell development based on studies in humans and
  mice. The scheme illustrates the principal stages of B-cell development (predominantly
  of the B2 lineage) based on studies in mice and humans. Commitment to the B-cell
  lineage requires the action of several transcription factors (some of them are illustrated
  in the figure). PAX5, BACH2, PU.1, and IRF8 are expressed throughout B-cell development
  and are silenced in antibody-secreting cells [,,]. Surrogate light chains, SLC (VpreB,
  and λ14.1), and Igα production are the hallmarks of the pro-B-cell stage. V(D)J
  rearrangement results in the synthesis of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (µH) with
  Cµ constant domain chain. The µH together with SLC and Igαβ form a pre-BCR receptor,
  which is required to pass the first essential quality control during B-cell development,
  after which a rearrangement at the IGL or IGK loci encoding the λ or κ light chains
  is initiated. IRF4, along with IRF8, interacts with PU.1 and binds to Ig κ 3′ enhancer
  and λ enhancers to modulate rearrangement of Ig light chains at the pre-B cell stage
  [,]. This permits the production of the conventional IgM molecules on the cell surface,
  which corresponds to the “Immature B-cell” stage. The IgM BCR passes rounds of controls
  to eliminate self-reactive molecules. Dual expression of the IgM BCR and IgD BCR
  on the cell surface identifies the “Mature B-cell” stage. The mature naïve B-cells
  migrate to the periphery into the secondary lymphoid organs, where they are subjected
  to antigen presentation and selection. Upon antigen stimulation, they might form
  special structures called Germinal Centers (GC), where the antigen-binding sites
  of the antibodies may be further adaptively altered in the course of SHM, allowing
  the production of high-affinity antibodies. Starting from this stage, the B-cell
  may become either a memory cell or the antibody-secreting plasma cell [,]. Another
  type of antibody-secreting cell is plasmablast, plasmablasts are cycling cells that
  are produced early in the immune response. IRF4, along with BLIMP1(PRDM1) and XBP1,
  are expressed in antibody-secreting plasma cells and play a role in plasma cell
  commitment. IRF4, BLIMP1, and XBP1 are often found mutated or dysregulated in MM
  (see  and ). IRF4 is induced by BCR signaling and upregulates BLIMP1, which has
  positive feedback on IRF4 []. BLIMP1 is a master-regulator that represses PAX5 and
  BCL6 programs, induces the expression of XBP1, and turns the program toward plasma
  cell development []. IRF4 upregulates AICDA, encoding AID, and is essential for
  CSR. CSR is ceased through the BLIMP1-mediated pathway upon B-cell differentiation
  into plasmablasts or plasma cells [,].
