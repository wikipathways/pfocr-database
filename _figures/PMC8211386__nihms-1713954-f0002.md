caption: 'Death receptors 4 and 5 (DR4, DR5) can be activated by agonist antibodies
  such as mapatumumab, conatumumab, Apo2L/TRAIL, ABBV-621 and GEN1029, fusion protein
  of recombinant TRAIL with IgG1 (MM-201) or pegylated recombinant TRAIL (TLY012).
  BH3 mimetics bind to anti-apoptosis BCL-2 family members (BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL1) leading
  to activation of BAX and BAK that form pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane
  resulting in release of cytochrome C. Selective inhibitors of BCL-2 (venetoclax,
  S55746, APG-2575), BCL-XL (ABBV-155) and MCL1 (AMG-176, S64315, AZD5991) have reached
  clinical trials. Modulation of growth signaling pathways also induces apoptosis
  and combinations of MEK inhibitors with navitoclax (BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitor) are
  being investigated in clinical trials. Pro-survival pathways such as AKT and MEK
  inhibit apoptosis by phosphorylation of proapoptotic proteins such as BAD (BCL-2-associated
  agonist of cell death) and BIM (BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death). Strategies
  targeting the p53 pathway to induce apoptosis include MDM2 inhibitors (i.e., idasanutlin,
  AMG-232, APG-115, DS-302b, BI-907828, ALRN-6924). The ONC201 which has a three-ring
  imipridone structure has been found to bind to dopamine receptors DRD2 and DRD3  as
  well as the mitochondrial caseinolytic protease P (CIpP) leading to activation of
  integrated stress response protein ATF4 ,. ATF4 activation by ONC201 leads to CHOP-dependent
  DR5 upregulation and cell death ,. The relationship between ClpP and the other pathways
  engaged by ONC201 remains under study although the binding appears to be upstream
  of ATF4 activation (Lanlan Zhou and W.S.E-D., unpublished observations). SMAC (second
  mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) is released from mitochondria together
  with cytochrome c. Cytochrome s forms the apoptosome complex with caspase 9 and
  APAF-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor 1). Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins
  (IAP) prevent caspase activation and this is blocked by SMAC or Omi/HtrA2 which
  is also released from mitochondria. SMAC mimetics and inhibitors of IAP (i.e., LCL161,
  birinapant, Debio 1143) have transitioned to clinical trials. tBid: truncated BH-3
  interacting domain death agonist; BCL-XL: B cell lymphoma extra-large; MCL1: myeloid
