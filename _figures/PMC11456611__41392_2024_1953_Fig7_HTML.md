caption: 'Colorectal cancer: therapeutic targeting of oncogenic signaling cascades.
  This figure illustrates key oncogenic signaling pathways in colorectal cancer, focusing
  on receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR and HER2/HER3, and their downstream
  cascades. It highlights the targeted therapies Cetuximab and Osimertinib for EGFR,
  Trastuzumab and Neratinib for HER2/HER3, AMG510 for KRAS, Binimetinib for MEK1/2,
  as well as Alpelisib and Copanlisib, which target the PI3K pathway by inhibiting
  the PI3K p110α subunit. These inhibitors disrupt critical signaling cascades (Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
  and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways) involved in cell proliferation, growth, and survival,
  demonstrating their potential effectiveness in treating colorectal cancer'
