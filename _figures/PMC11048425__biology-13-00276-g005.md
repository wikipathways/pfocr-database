caption: The proposed metabolic routes associated with lipid and β-carotene biosynthetic
  pathways in ΔcarRP WJ11 in comparison with the WJ11 strain. The abbreviations of
  all metabolite names are in Supplementary Table S8. The abbreviations of all gene
  IDs are in Supplementary Table S3. A red metabolite name represents a reporter metabolite.
  Red EC numbers are associated with upregulated genes. The red arrows indicate upregulation
  routes associated with amino acid metabolism. The green arrows indicate downregulation
  routes associated with carotenoid and fatty acid biosynthesis. Green EC numbers
  are associated with downregulated genes
