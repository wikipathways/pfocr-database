caption: Key decision points in the repair of DSBs by HR. (1) The DNA ends are bound
  by either MRN or the Ku70/80 heterodimer. Binding and retention of MRN will shift
  repair toward HR and the binding of Ku shifts repair toward to NHEJ. (2) Short range
  resection by MRN. (3) Long-range resection of the DNA and RPA binding. (4) RPA is
  exchanged for RAD51, which facilitates strand invasion, DNA synthesis and HR repair.
