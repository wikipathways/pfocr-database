caption: RNA granules and caprin-1-associated tumorigenesis. Caprin-1 mRNA is produced
  in the nucleus and transported into mRNP or the SG through the transport granule,
  and finally degraded in the P-body. Caprin-1-associated tumorigenesis takes place
  primarily through affecting SG-mediated tumorigenic characteristics and the MYC-mediated
  immune checkpoint. eIF2α can be activated by various stress stimuli and induces
  SG formation, thereby leading to tumorigenic characteristics, such as increased
  transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle, increased Ras signaling
  pathway, EMT and decreased apoptosis. Caprin-1 can also indirectly enhance the expression
  of immune checkpoint proteins, such as CD47 and PD-L1, through MYC, which is one
  of the regulatory targets of caprin-1. Caprin-1, cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated
  protein-1; mRNP, mRNA protein complexes; SG, stress granule; P-body, processing
  body; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α; EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal
  transition; PD-L1, programmed death-ligand 1; TIA-1, T-cell-restricted intracellular
  antigen-1; TTP, tristetraprolin; mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1;
  DCP, decapping enzyme; Ago2, argonaute 2; G3BP, GTPase-activating protein (Src homology
  3 domain) binding protein; FMRP, fragile X mental retardation 1.
