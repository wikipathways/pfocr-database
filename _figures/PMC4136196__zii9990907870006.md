caption: Coinfection of Filifactor alocis with P. gingivalis showing upregulation
  of proteins involved in cancer and cell death pathways. HeLa cells were infected
  with F. alocis ATCC 35896 and D-62D strains (MOI of 1:100 [105 epithelial cells])
  in monoculture or coculture with P. gingivalis strains as previously reported ().
  Tandem isobaric mass tagging analysis of cocultures and monocultures was carried
  out using Orbitrap. The eukaryotic proteins were analyzed using MASCOT, and functional
  analysis was carried out using Ingenuity pathway analysis software. The gene ontology
  classification was used for referencing the proteome. Proteins such as prohibitins,
  Ras-related protein Rab 10, and the Ras-related protein Rab 7 SET translocation
  protein that are involved in apoptosis and histone binding were upregulated. Also,
  the SRSF1 protein encoded by a proto-oncogene, NACA protein (transcriptional coactivator),
  NPM1 (nucleophosmin; involved in apoptosis and tumorigenesis), and CALR (calreticulin;
  involved in calcium binding and storage) were highly upregulated. Green, downregulation;
  red, upregulation.
