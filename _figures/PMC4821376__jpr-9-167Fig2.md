caption: 'Altered arginine metabolism in hemolysis.Notes: Dietary glutamine serves
  as a precursor for the de novo production of arginine through the citrulline–arginine
  pathway. Arginine is synthesized endogenously from citrulline primarily via the
  intestinal–renal axis. Arginase and NO synthases (NOS) compete for arginine, their
  common substrate. In SCD, bioavailability of arginine and NO is decreased by several
  mechanisms linked to hemolysis and oxidative stress. Endothelial dysfunction resulting
  from NO depletion and increased levels of the downstream products of ornithine metabolism
  (polyamines and proline) likely contribute to the pathogenesis of lung injury, fibrosis,
  and pulmonary hypertension. This disease paradigm has implications for all hemolytic
  processes. “X” means kidney dysfunction, or a block in the conversion of citrulline
  to arginine in the kidney. Copyright © 2008 by the American Republished with permission
