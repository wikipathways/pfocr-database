caption: A variety of molecular and cellular pathways contribute to liver inflammation
  in HBV/HDV co-infection, causing liver cirrhosis. (A) L-HDAg can interact with different
  signaling pathways in a direct or indirect manner, resulting in amplified cytokine
  responses. This results in an increased activation of the transcription factors
  STAT-3, c-Jun, and NF-κB and transcription of genes contributing to inflammation.
  (B) HDV induces ISGs, including proteins involved in the antigen presentation pathway.
  In consequence, compared to HBV mono-infection, more HBV epitopes are presented
  on the cell surface, resulting in an increased activation of HBV-specific CD8+ T
  cells and general lymphocyte recruitment. (C) Increased numbers of NK and MAIT cells
  are detected in HBV/HDV co-infected livers, as well as increased numbers of HDV-specific
  CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells have a tissue resident phenotype. MAIT, NK, and CD8+
  T cells are in an effector state indicated by degranulation and activation molecule
  expression, among them NKG2D, which recognizes its ligand MIC-A/B on infected hepatocytes.
