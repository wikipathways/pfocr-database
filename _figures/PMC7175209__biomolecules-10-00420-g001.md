caption: Induction and initiation of cellular growth control and senescence via p53
  or P16INK4A pathways. Various internal or external stress factors trigger the DNA-damage
  response (DDR) pathway, which in turn activates the p53 and/or the p16INK4A pathways.
  p16INK4A inactivates Cdk4/6, results in accumulation of phosphorylated pRb, stops
  the regulation of E2F transcription factors, and drives cell cycle arrest or senescence.
  These stressors also trigger DNA damage (cellular responses to such damages are
  regulated by either ATM-Chk2 or ATR-Chk1 pathways) and transactivate p53 and p21CIP1.
  Moreover, p21CIP1 protein levels may lead to the inhibition of Cdk4/6 activity,
  which contribute to the G1 arrest or senescence [,].
