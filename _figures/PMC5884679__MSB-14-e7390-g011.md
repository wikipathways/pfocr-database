caption: Our work suggests that disruption of microtubule plus‐end function near the
  signaling site by perturbations such as the Δbim1 mutation causes variability in
  Ste5 recruitment or Fus3 signaling. Figure shows stimulatory reactions at the signaling
  site by which irregularities in Ste5 recruitment or Fus3 signaling could be amplified.
  (1) Fus3 is phosphorylated and activated due to the operation of the PRS. Some phosphorylated
  Fus3 binds to the Gpa1 subunit of the dissociated G‐protein. (2) Gpa1‐bound Fus3
  activates a protein, Bni1, which nucleates formation of actin cables. (3) Additional
  proteins involved in signaling, cell polarization, and cell fusion, including Cdc42
  and Fus2 (Paterson et al, , not shown) are then trafficked to the membrane as cargo
  carried along the actin cables. Activated Cdc42 stimulates its own activation (Kozubowski
  et al, ; Johnson et al, ). (4) Microtubule plus ends are captured by Kar3/Cik1 associated
  with Gpa1 (not shown) and Kar9/Bim1‐complexed plus ends can be walked down the actin
  cables to the signaling site by motor proteins including Myo2 (not shown). Microtubules,
  actin cables, and cargo proteins are larger than the approximate scale used here
  would suggest.  and  describe additional stimulatory reactions and positive feedbacks
  that might contribute to irregular signaling at the site.
