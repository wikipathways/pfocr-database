caption: Telomere attrition and mitochondrial dysfunction drive cellular senescence
  in lung fibrosis.Telomere attrition due to mutations in telomere genes (TERC, TERT)
  leads to the activation of the DNA-Damage Response (DDR) pathway, which drives p53-mediated
  cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2).
  In addition, PINK1 deficiency in AEC2 cells leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and
  in these cells. Senescent AEC2 cells are characterized by a senescence-associated
  secretory phenotype (SASP), which can spread cellular senescence to other AEC2 cells
  and myofibroblasts. In addition, the SASP has pro-fibrotic factors such as TGFβ1
  and mitoDAMPs (such as IL6, mtDNA), which promote the activation of scar-forming
  myofibroblasts and the development of lung fibrosis. In addition, mitochondrial
  dysfunction can also drive cellular senescence in myofibroblasts in a NAPDH oxidase
  4 (NOX4)/reactive oxygen species (ROS)- and p16-dependent manner by preventing mitophagy
  and promoting metabolic reprogramming in these cells. Damaged mitochondria in senescent
  myofibroblasts are characterized by increased levels of pro-apoptotic factors, thus
  increasing their apoptotic priming. Accordingly, senescent myofibroblasts upregulate
  expression of pro-survival mitochondrial proteins such as BCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-W,
  which block pro-apoptotic signaling and ensure survival of senescent myofibroblasts.
