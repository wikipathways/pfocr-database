caption: 'Signal transduction pathways of epithelial cells involved in the recognition
  of pathogenic bacteria. Epithelial cells are part of the innate immune system, which
  senses the presence of microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
  present in bacteria. These elements activate inflammatory pathways mainly through
  the activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLR proteins are coupled to the scaffold
  proteins, myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), or TIR domain-containing
  adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), which are associated with interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase 1/4 (IRAK1/4). This kinase is coupled to TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)
  []. TLR signaling results in the downstream activation of the following three major
  families of proteins important in activating inflammatory gene expression: interferon
  regulatory factors (IRFs); mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, such
  as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), protein 38 (P38), and extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases (ERKs); and the canonical inflammatory pathway, namely, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB). However, other transcriptional factors, such as activator
  protein 1 (AP-1), can also be activated. Bacteria induces the expression of many
  inflammatory genes and cytokine secretion, such as interleukin 1-beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6
  (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) []. Intracellular bacteria can be
  recognized in epithelial cells by TLRs (endosome) or Nod-like receptors (NODs),
  which can activate the inflammasome. This is a multiprotein complex activated by
  caspases, and its activation and composition depend on the activator, which initiates
  inflammasome assembly, resulting in the processing of inflammatory cytokines such
  as IL-1β and interleukin 18 (IL-18) [].'
