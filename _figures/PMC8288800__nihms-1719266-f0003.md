caption: Shown are long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with their associated pathways (left)
  and the biological processes in metastasis that they regulate (right) linked by
  lines to show lncRNAs interacting with specific pathways to regulate certain biological
  processes. LncRNAs are grouped from left to right by their downstream mechanism
  shown on the top panel. For each downstream mechanism, an example detailed mechanism
  of a lncRNA is presented. LncRNAs in grey boxes are those for which consensus pathway
  involvement has not been characterized. An asterisk (*) indicates lncRNAs that are
  involved in multiple pathways or that regulate multiple biological processes in
  metastasis. In the top panel downstream mechanisms are shown by which representative
  lncRNAs regulate epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB.
