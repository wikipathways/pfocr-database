caption: The Insulin signalling pathway and Insulin resistance in COVID-19 and Diabetes
  infection.Adapted from Jung & Choi (2014), Finucane and Davenport (2020), Rajpal
  et al. (2020) and Santos et al. (2021). Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR)
  to produce the activated insulin receptor substrate (IRS1). This leads activates
  phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), which binds to its receptor phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate
  (PIP2) to form a second messenger, phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-triphosphate (PIP3).
  This activates Protein kinase B (AKT/PBK) which binds to the membrane, and is phosporylated
  by protein kinase-1(PDK1). Protein kinase B is essential for glucose transport activation,
  glycogenesis and lipogenesis. A dysregulation of the insulin signalling pathway
  due to viral infection disrupts the function of AKT/PKB and may lead to commodities
  such as hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, chronic cardiovascular
  disease, and hypertension. The binding of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in patients
  with commobidities and advanced age results in a hyperactive immune response and
  increases the severity of the virus after infection. Insulin resistance together
  with the hyperinflammation exacerbates the onset of all commodities and increase
  the pancreatic ACE2 expression. Increased pancreatic ACE2 expression creates a higher
  binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2. This predisposes patients with diabetes mellitus
  to suffer from a more aggressive pathology of COVID-19 infection.
