caption: Signaling by EGF and PDGF in the regulation of β-cell proliferation. Schematic
  representation of the signaling pathways activated by EGF family of proteins and
  PDGF in rodent (A) and human (B) β-cells. Multiple members of the EGF family of
  proteins, including BTC, EGF, HB-EGF, TGF-α, and epiregulin, have been shown to
  act in β-cells. ErbB family of receptors is expressed in β-cells and BTC binding
  to ErbB1, also called EGFR, and ErbB2 has been reported to activate the IRS2/PI3K
  pathway, which in turn signals via PDK-1 to modulate Akt and PKCζ. EGF binding to
  ErbB receptors in β-cells leads to activation of Akt and ERK signaling pathways.
  GLP-1 through activation of ADAM proteins can lead to the secretion of BTC from
  β-cells that act upon ErbB receptors. Activation of these pathways leads to enhanced
  rodent β-cell proliferation, an aspect unknown in human β-cells. PDGF receptors
  are expressed in β-cells but their expression is attenuated during aging. PDGF binding
  to PDGFR leads to activation of ERK1/2, increased expression of the histone methyltransferase,
  Ezh2, repression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p16INK4, and increased β-cell proliferation.
  This pathway is preserved in juvenile human β-cells and leads to enhanced replication.
  Gray lines are molecules and pathways that are known to exist in rodents but are
  unknown in human β-cells. (A high-quality color representation of this figure is
  available in the online issue.)
