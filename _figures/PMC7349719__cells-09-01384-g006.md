caption: 'The effects of IGF-1 on mitochondria-mediated apoptosis: Cellular stress
  leads to permeability transition pore (PTP) opening, reduction in OXPHOS function,
  membrane potential, and ATP production, while ROS production is increased, altogether
  leading to cyt c release. Cytosolic Cyt c activates the apoptosome, leading to cell
  death. IGF-1R-mediated inhibition of apoptosis occurs via activation of two major
  signaling pathways that trigger phosphorylation cascade of cytosolic and nuclear
  proteins regulating transcription and activation of proteins involved in protection
  from apoptosis. The AKT pathway leads to phosphorylation of Forkhead box transcription
  factors of the class O (FOXO) proteins and subsequent inhibition of their transcriptional
  activity. The MAPK pathway, stimulated by IGF-1 binding, activates the Bcl antiapoptotic
  family of proteins.'
