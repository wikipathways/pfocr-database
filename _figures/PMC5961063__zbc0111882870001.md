caption: Summary of ROS modulation during ECM detachment. As shown in the upper left
  panel, it has been revealed in detached, nontransformed cells that glucose uptake
  via GLUT1 is diminished during ECM detachment. This deficiency in glucose uptake
  leads to a low level of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) and limited flux through the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP). Subsequently, the diminished PPP flux causes a decrease
  in NADPH leading to an increase in ROS levels, ultimately resulting in cell death.
  Upon expression of the oncogene ERBB2 in these cells, defective glucose uptake is
  restored, leading to abundant glucose 6-phosphate production, rescue of PPP flux,
  and subsequent NADPH generation to fortify ROS defenses. Continuing in the upper
  left panel, it has been shown that when the PPP is antagonized during ECM detachment,
  AMPK activation blocks cell death by maintaining NADPH levels through fatty acid
  oxidation-induced NADPH production and by inhibiting NADPH consumption during fatty-acid
  synthesis (FAS) (via antagonizing ACC1 and ACC2). Progressing to the upper right
  panel, it has been discovered that synthesis of GSH, driven by the glutamate cysteine
  ligase modifier (GCLM), is necessary for primary tumor formation. Loss of GCLM prevented
  a tumor's ability to drive the metastatic cascade, where survival in the absence
  of ECM attachment is imperative. These data indicate that at the later stages of
  the metastatic cascade, GSH becomes dispensable due to compensation from alternative
  antioxidant pathways. Indeed, thioredoxin (TXN) levels were increased when GSH synthesis
  was blocked. Combinatorial inhibition of TXN and GSH leads to a synergistic block
  on cancer cell survival, leading to their ultimate death both in vitro and in vivo.
  Other studies have discovered that high doses of vitamin C, which has well-documented
  antioxidant activity, can lead to an elevation in intracellular ROS levels in cells
  with activating mutations in K-Ras or B-Raf. The increase in ROS is first initiated
  by cellular uptake of oxidized vitamin C (dehydroascorbate (DHA)) via the glucose
  transporter, GLUT1. This uptake of DHA leads to a significant increase in ROS levels
  as intracellular DHA is reduced back to vitamin C at the expense of GSH. Additional
  studies have explored the role of catalase, SOD1, and SOD2 in mitigating ROS levels
  to enhance the survival of ECM-detached cells. It was discovered that antagonizing
  catalase or SOD2 did not impact the viability of ECM-attached cells but specifically
  compromised the survival of ECM-detached cells. Expanding upon this further, antagonizing
  catalase or SOD2 attenuated tumor burden in the lungs of immunocompromised mice
  following tail vein injection. Additional studies demonstrated that SOD2 expression
  is elevated in human breast cancer metastases compared with primary tumors, a finding
  consistent with a role for SOD2 in facilitating the survival of ECM-detached cancer
  cells. Finally, proceeding to the middle panel, it was recently discovered that
  ECM-detached lung carcinoma cells utilized IDH1 to reductively decarboxylate glutamine
  to citrate in the cytosol. The newly derived citrate subsequently enters the mitochondria
  via the citrate transporter protein (CTP) where it participates in oxidative metabolism.
  The activity of mitochondrion-located IDH2 functions to synthesize NADPH and neutralize
  mitochondrial ROS in a fashion that promotes survival. Other research has found
  that proline catabolism via proline dehydrogenase (Prodh) supports growth of breast
  cancer cells grown in 3D culture but not in 2D culture. The breakdown of proline
  by Prodh supports mitochondrial ATP production by feeding electrons, in the form
  of FADH2, into the electron transport chain to ultimately balance redox homeostasis
  in favor of metastasis formation. Finally, the particular contributions of serine
  and glycine metabolism to balancing redox homeostasis during ECM detachment remain
  an interesting topic for future exploration.
