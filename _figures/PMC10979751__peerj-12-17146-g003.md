caption: Macrophages and their exosomes regulate tumor cell growth by regulating the
  tumor microenvironment. T cells secrete TNF-α to kill osteosarcoma cells. However,
  TAM secretes EGF and TGF-α to promote the metastasis of tumor cells to other organs,
  and tumor cells recruit additional macroph ages to gather at the tumor site by secreting
  M-CSF. In addition, IL-34 recruits more macrophages to accumulate in tumor tissues
  by binding to the macrophage M-CSF receptor and promotes angiogenesis and tumor
  cell metastasis by targeting the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in vascular
  endothelial cells. The M2-like macrophage exosome miR-221-3p promotes the migration
  and invasion of tumor cells by activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway of tumor
  cells. Exosome LNCR-LIR-AS1 targets the miR-29a/NIFA axis of tumor cells to promote
  their proliferation and growth. iL-1β/10/34, interleukin-1β/10/34; TGF-α, transforming
  growth factor-α; M-CSF, Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor
