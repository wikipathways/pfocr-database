caption: The pathogenic roles of NLRP3 inflammasome in liver diseases. Gut-derived
  PAMPs, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)
  signaling pathway, promoting the expression of pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18. The NLRP3
  inflammasome in the liver is activated by serious danger signals, such as cholesterol
  crystals, ethanol, and REO nanoparticles. Excessive alcohol consumption stimulates
  the generation of ROS, which facilitates the cleavage of TXNIP and contributes to
  assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in response
  to HCV infection requires the recognition by Toll-like receptor-7 (TLR-7) and clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis. Pyroptosis features GSDMD pores on the membrane, allowing the release
  of IL-1β and IL-18 into the extracellular space. NLRP3 inflammasome cooperates with
  TNF-α and IL-17 contributing to the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis.
