caption: Signaling abnormalities and impairment of neurotrophic cascades that underlie
  the neurobiological basis of bipolar disorder. Lithium increases their expression
  and/or levels, thus inducing neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects. Activation
  of brain neurotransmitter-coupled G-proteins induces PLC hydrolysis of PIP2 to IP3
  and DAG (not shown), which activates PKC. IP3 binds to the IP3R, thus inducing the
  release of ER calcium stores. Elevated intracellular calcium levels have been described
  in bipolar disorder and may increase the risk of apoptosis. The neuroprotective
  protein Bcl-2 downregulates ER calcium release through an IP3R–dependent mechanism.
  The same effect is induced by lithium treatment, which also increases Bcl-2 levels.
  IP3 is recycled by IMPase, another of lithium’s targets. Cellular signaling through
  Wnt glycoproteins and frizzled receptors result in GSK-3β inhibition, a critical
  cellular target and effector for diverse proteins. Inhibition of GSK-3β prevents
  β-catenin phosphorylation and stimulates its translocation to the nucleus, thus
  targeting transcription of specific genes activating neurotrophic effects and synaptogenesis.
  Activation of the BDNF receptor (Trk-B) activates the ERK/MAPK pathway, which inhibits
  GSK-3β and BAD. Activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mitogen-
  activated protein kinase pathway by BDNF increases the expression of nuclear CREB,
  which facilitates the expression of neurotrophic/neuroprotective proteins such as
  Bcl-2 and BDNF. BDNF also activates the PI3K pathway, which indirectly inhibits
  GSK-3β and BAD. Mitochondrial Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl also inhibit pro-apoptotic activation
  of BAD, as well as consequent mitochondrial increase in calcium influx and cytochrome
  C release. Bcl-2 = B-cell lymphoma-2; BDNF = brain-derived neurotrophic factor;
  CREB = cAMP response element binding protein; DAG = diacylglycerol; ERK = extracellular
  regulated kinase; GSK = glycogen synthase kinase; IMPase = inositol monophosphatase;
