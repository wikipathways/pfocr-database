caption: 'A. Top ten most significant pathways predicted by GeneGo pathway analysis.
  The results were ordered by -log10 of the p value of the hypergeometric distribution.
  B–D. Pathways related to Rheb-mTORC1 signaling axis within the top ten most significant
  pathways. Thermometers with blueorred next to symbols show proteins identified in
  LC-MS/MS detection: red color represents the proteins that increased in FADD knockdown
  MCF-7 cells compared to control group; blue color represents the decreased proteins.'
