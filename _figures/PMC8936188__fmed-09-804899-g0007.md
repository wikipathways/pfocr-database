caption: A schematic diagram depicts the molecular mechanism underlying the protective
  effect of Sal A, the active ingredient of Salvia miltiorrhiza, on peritoneal fibrosis,
  inflammation, and oxidative injury in murine models of peritoneal dialysis. As a
  key active component of Salvia miltiorrhiza, Sal A is able to directly bind to and
  inhibit GSK3β (). GSK3β is a convergent point of myriad pathways modifying the severity
  of peritoneal fibrosis, including the NFκB directed inflammatory response pathway
  and the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway. Inhibition of GSK3β by Sal A mitigates NFκB phosphorylation
  and activation and reinforces Nrf2 antioxidant self-defense in peritoneal mesothelial
  cells and thereby attenuates inflammation, maladaptive angiogenesis and oxidative
  damage in peritoneum exposed to the hypertonic PDF, resulting in an improved peritoneal
  fibrosis.
