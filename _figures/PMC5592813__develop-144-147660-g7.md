caption: A working model for the regulation of late larval DTC-expressed lag-2. (Top)
  Under favorable conditions, DAF-7/TGFβ pathway activity inhibits repressor activity
  of the DAF-3/DAF-5 complex, possibly by interfering with complex formation or stability.
  lag-2 expression is driven by positive regulators, including HLH-2, which binds
  the E-box (green), and unknown regulators that bind other conserved sequences (yellow)
  shown in Fig. S7. DAF-3 may bind both the DBS (blue) and the Cons (red) sequences
  under favorable conditions, but it is not active. (Bottom) Under unfavorable conditions,
  the DAF-3/DAF-5 complex is active and represses lag-2 expression, possibly by interfering
  with non-HLH-2 activators. See Discussion for details.
