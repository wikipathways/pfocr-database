caption: 'Possible actions of these compounds are shown as numbered red crosses in
  the figure. 1. AMG102 neutralizes active HGF, reducing HGF/c-MET binding. 2. c-MET
  inhibitor works by preventing binding of ligand HGF to the receptor c-MET directly
  by inhibiting the pathway. Additionally, c-MET inhibitor acts by: 2a) Reducing uPA
  production by cancer cells. 2b) Inhibiting further HGF activation. 2c) Preventing
  transactivation of c-MET by other pathways such as EGFR. 3. Gemcitabine causes cancer
  cell death. 4. Overall the bidirectional interactions between PSCs and cancer cells
  are significantly reduced.'
