caption: The accumulating data suggest that DCs are necessary, but not always sufficient,
  to initiate the priming of naive CD4 T cells and the initial commitment of the primed
  T cells to the Th2 developmental pathway. Antigen-specific activated B cells can
  play an integral and cooperative role in this DC-dependent process by producing
  LT, which induces increased CXCL13 production by the LN stromal cells. Nematode
  infection induced activation of the LT:CXCL13 positive feedback loop facilitates
  the recruitment and retention of antigen-bearing, CXCR5-expressing DCs and CXCR5-expressing
  CD4 T cells near the B cell follicles. Localization of the DCs, T cells and B cells
  in this LN microenvironment allows for exchange of cytokine and co-stimulatory signals
  between these three cell types and with other cells, such as the CXCL13-producing
  stromal cells that are present in this specialized niche. These location-dependent
  signals favor development of IL-4 producing TFH and Th2 cells and prevent the initiation
  of alternate effector fates.
