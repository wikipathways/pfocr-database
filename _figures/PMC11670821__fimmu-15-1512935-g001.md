caption: Generation and release of exosomes in response to bacterial infection. (A)
  Bacterial infections in various cell types can induce the release of exosomes. (B)
  Various bacterial-infected cell types, including cancer cells, epithelial cells,
  fibroblasts, and immune cells, can induce the release of exosomes. (C) Microvesicles
  arise from the outward budding of the plasma membrane, while apoptotic vesicles
  are lipid bilayer structures generated during programmed cell death. The process
  of exosome formation begins with the invagination of the plasma membrane to create
  early endosomes, which then mature into late endosomes. These endosomes produce
  intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) and utilize biogenesis proteins (e.g., ESCRTs, ALIX,
  syntaxin, and Rabs) to form multivesicular bodies (MVBs). MVBs can either merge
  with lysosomes for degradation or fuse with the cell membrane to release their enclosed
  vesicles into the extracellular space, resulting in exosome release. Exosomal cargo
  can include various molecules such as DNA, mRNA, small RNAs (miRNA, lncRNA, circRNA),
  proteins (e.g., heat shock proteins (HSP), ALIX/TSG101), metabolites, and bacterial
  components. Exosomes are composed of major histocompatibility complexes (MHC), specific
  cell receptors, lipid rafts, integrin adhesion molecules, Rabs, Ago proteins, tetraspanin
  proteins, and ESCRT proteins (e.g., ALIX/TSG101). These surface molecules may facilitate
  the uptake of exosomes by recipient cells. (D) Exosomes can exert their effects
  through various mechanisms, including endocytosis (a), direct fusion with the recipient
  cell membrane (b), ligand- and receptor-mediated signaling pathways (c), and antigen
  presentation (d), which release active molecules such as non-coding RNAs and proteins
  into target cells

    (A) Bacterial infections in various cell types can induce the release of exosomes.
    (B) Various bacterial-infected cell types, including cancer cells, epithelial
