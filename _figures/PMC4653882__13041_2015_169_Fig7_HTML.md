caption: A model showing the molecular mechanism for the upregulation of AMPA receptors
  in the ACC of IBS animal model. Visceral injuries trigger the release of glutamate
  in the ACC via ascending visceral pathways. Activation of NMDA receptors lead to
  calcium fluxes into the postsynaptic membrane. These cause the activation of Ca2+/CaM
  dependent AC1. Activation of AC1 catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP and activates
  PKA and downstream signaling pathway, which in turn produces the phosphorylation
  of the GluA1-containing AMPA receptor at Ser845 site, GluN2B and PKMζ. The phosphorylation
  of the GluA1 at Ser845 site promotes AMPA receptor trafficking to membrane. Increases
  in postsynaptic AMPA receptors as well as the enhancement of glutamate release significantly
  enhance excitatory synaptic transmission in the ACC, and then lead to amplification
  of chronic visceral pain
