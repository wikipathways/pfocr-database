caption: Proposed scheme of senescence acceleration by IS in ciPTEC-OAT1. Downregulation
  of SV40T and p53 (at 37 °C) leads to transcriptional upregulation of p21, thus inducing
  cell cycle arrest and eventually causing senescence []. After being taken up by
  the proximal tubule cells via the OAT1 transporter, IS promotes the expression of
  p21, which results in cell cycle arrest. Moreover, IS specifically upregulates various
  SASP factors, further accelerating senescence through the TNF-α/NF-ĸB pathway. The
  senescence process is potentiated by SASP subsequent promotion of fibrosis through
  the EMT process. Senescent cells show typical SA-β-gal activity and downregulation
  of LaminB1, characterizing senescence. Red arrows indicate the senescence process
  accelerated by IS; ↑ upregulation; ↓ downregulation.
