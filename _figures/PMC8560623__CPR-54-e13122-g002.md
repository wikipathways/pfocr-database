caption: Concise schematic diagram of Ca2+/CaN/NFAT signalling pathway involved in
  the process of osteoblast differentiation. The combination of Wnt and the N‐terminal
  of Frizzled causes the activation of PLCγ and increases the level of IP3, which
  in turn activates the IP3 receptor to promote the release of Ca2+ from ER into the
  cytoplasm, and activates CaN by CaM to promote the nuclear translocation of NFAT.
  CaSR activates PLCγ in response to an increase in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration
  to cause an elevation in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In addition, the
  storage depletion of Ca2+ in ER can also lead to Ca2+ influx through Orai1/STIM1.
  L‐VGCC and NCX all regulate Ca2+ influx, which further results in the activation
  of the Ca2+/CaN/NFAT signalling pathway. NFAT and Osterix form transcription complexes,
  which in turn, trigger the transcription of osteoblast‐related genes
