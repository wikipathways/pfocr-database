caption: Postulated differences in the CXCR4-LASP1-AKT1 signaling between breast cancer
  and CML. In solid breast cancer (left panel), PKA is over-expressed and active,
  leading to phosphorylation of LASP1 at S146 and binding of the protein to CXCR4.
  In addition, LASP1 binds to AKT1 and, as a scaffolding protein, allows correct binding
  of AKT1 to the membrane (and potentially the mTORC2 complex) for efficient S473
  phosphorylation. A quantity of AKT1-pLASP1-S146 is present perinuclear. Low levels
  of AKT1 and LASP1 are also detected in the nucleus to favor transcriptional activity.
  Stimulation of CXCR4 by CXCL12 leads to activation of downstream phosphotyrosine
  kinases (PTKs) and increases LASP1-Y171 phosphorylation. Simultaneously, released
  Gαi inhibits the PKA pathway and LASP1 becomes dephosphorylated at S146, detaches
  from the receptor tail, and renders CXCR4 more sensitive for degradation. In CML
  (right panel), constitutively active tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL results in predominant
  pLASP-Y171 phosphorylation, impeded CRKL-LASP1 binding, and down-regulation/degradation
  of CXCR4 receptor. No LASP1 is detected in the expanded nucleus. After inhibition
  of BCR-ABL by TKI like nilotinib, CXCR4 is restored in the plasma membrane, LASP1-Y171
  phosphorylation decreases, while pLASP1-S146 increases and allows binding to and
  stabilizing of the chemokine receptor for homing.
