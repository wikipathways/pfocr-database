caption: Paracrine effects of the ASC secretome and involved pathways. ASCs secrete
  IGF-1, SOD-3, miRNA-301a, and exosomes for improving the effect of anti-apoptosis
  or pro-survival through regulating cell cycle, N-Cadherin/ERK/Nrf2, ASK-1 and NFγB/p38/JNK,
  Wnt/β-Catenin, cyclin D1, Bcl-2 and Bax, respectively. ASC-derived microvesicles
  perform the pro-angiogenesis effect via delivery of miRNA-126 and miRNA-31 through
  ERK1/2/MAPK and FIH-1 pathways, respectively. The conditioned medium of ASCs exerts
  the anti-inflammation effect through IFN-γ/IDO and PGE2/EP2/4 signaling pathways,
  which also can recruit circulating EPCs through CXCL12/SDF-1α pathway. The anti-cardiac
  remodeling effect is mediated by exosomes through MAPK/PI3K pathway and HGF released
  from ASCs
