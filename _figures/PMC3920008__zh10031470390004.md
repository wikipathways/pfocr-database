caption: Novel regulatory pathway of intracellular lipid homeostasis. Diet and synthesized
  cholesterol using acetate as substrate are two sources for intracellular cholesterol.
  There are two pathways, neutral and acidic, for cholesterol degradation and bile
  acid synthesis. The neutral pathway is dominant for bile acid biosynthesis; the
  acidic serves as a regulatory pathway involved in lipid metabolism and cell proliferation.
  When cholesterol levels increase by exogenous diet or endogenous biosynthesis in
  the cells, 1) StarD1 delivers cholesterol into mitochondria where CYP27A1 is located;
  2) cholesterol is 25-hydroxylated by CYP27A1 to 25-hydroxycholesterol and sulfated
  at its 3β-position to form 25HC3S by SULT2B1b; 3) the sulfated oxysterol modulates
  nuclear receptors by activating PPARs and inactivating LXRs through forming a complex
  that goes to nuclei; and 4) the complexes play important roles in maintenance of
  lipid homeostasis, inflammatory responses, antiapoptosis, and cell proliferation.
