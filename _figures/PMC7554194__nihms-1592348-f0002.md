caption: (A) Immature Schwann cells. WNT signalling through the receptor frizzled
  has been shown to affect Schwann cell development, but the extent of its effects
  vary depending on the investigative approach used (see text for details), possibly
  as a consequence of different dosage and timing. When activated by a currently unknown
  ligand, GPR56/ADGRG1 promotes radial sorting and myelin formation/organization through
  RHOA in a mechanism that may involve interaction with plectin. The most obvious
  role for GPR56 in vivo is in myelin maintenance. LPA secreted by neurons binds to
  LPA1 receptors in Schwann cells and stimulates Schwann cell migration, radial sorting
  and myelination in a pathway involving Gαi and RAC1. Other neurotransmitters and
  neuromodulators may also signal to Schwann cells, although much of the evidence
  for this comes from in vitro investigation. ATP may stimulate translation of myelin
  proteins through P2X7 receptors, inhibit Schwann cell proliferation and differentiation
  through P2Y1 receptors, or induce myelin expansion in a pathway involving IP3, the
  endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria through P2Y2 receptors. Adenosine binds to
  A2A receptors and inhibits SC proliferation by upregulating cAMP and ERK/MAPK. Acetylcholine
  (ACh) is thought to modulate the expression of myelin genes by acting on M2/M4 receptors
  (B) Myelinating Schwann cell. LGI4 is secreted by Schwann cells to act on the axonal
  receptor ADAM22; both are essential for myelination. Neurotrophins released by both
  Schwann cells and axons may act through neurotrophin receptors including the p75
  neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Cell adhesion molecules such as nectin-like (necl)
  proteins are required for proper myelination, while N- and E-cadherin may promote
  Schwann cell-axon interactions. Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) likely acts
  through multiple binding partners including sialic-acid containing oligosaccharides.
  L1 forms homophilic and heterophilic interactions, possibly with integrins. (C)
  Remak Schwann cell. GABA released from axons is thought to signal through GABA-B
  receptors in Remak Schwann cells to inhibit the expression of myelin genes. The
  expression of molecules represented by this figure may not be strictly limited to
  the developmental or differentiation stage depicted.
