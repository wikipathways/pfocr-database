caption: Roles of extracellular Tat in HIV in virus life cycle and in the latent virus
  reservoir. A Stochastic oscillations of HIV-1 Tat protein expression (the Tat stochastic
  switch) determine the fate of HIV infection []; B Membrane-bond extracellular Tat
  induces CTL apoptosis []; C Extracellular Tat binds Env to form a HIV entry complex
  [] that increases virus infectivity and the HIV basic reproduction number (R0),
  thus increasing the chances of infection in tissue compartments with low-drug penetration;
  at the same time, extracellular Tat induces in naïve CD4+ T cells a non-classical
  activation pathway rendering these cells susceptible to HIV infection []; D Extracellular
  Tat enhances the expansion and differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into effector-memory
  cells [], thus increasing the number of cells transitioning from the activated to
  the resting state, a cell state that favors latent infection []; E Extracellular
  Tat forms chemotactic gradients [; , ] recruiting monocytes/macrophages and dendritic
  cells to the site of infection (51), induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  [–] and the maturation of dendritic cells with a Th-1 polarization []; F Tat upregulates
  BCL2 in CD4+ T cells, leading to increased reservoir cell survival [] while rendering
  these cells resistant to CTL killing []
