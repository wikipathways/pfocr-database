caption: 'Concept of ex vivo complement deposition on endothelial cells. An ex vivo
  endothelial assay was developed to reproduce human pathological conditions and their
  complexity. The assay consists of the detection and quantification of complement
  component deposition on the cultured endothelial cells (EC) surface after incubation
  with human serum. The EC surface was used as the regulatory surface. (A) In serum
  from healthy individuals, the alternative pathway is active at low levels but tightly
  regulated in the fluid phase by regulators, resulting in a very low level of complement
  activation product deposition on the EC surface. The detection of an increased complement
  deposition when incubation is performed with pathological serum (B) could result
  in either i) complement overactivation that overwhelms EC capacity of regulation
  (orange) or ii) defect in complement regulation in fluid or solid phase. Both are
  induced by tested human serum incubated with EC. Orange arrows represent some mechanisms
  involved in complement overactivation in serum (1): the participation of a coactivation
  of classical/alternative pathway due to pathological immunoglobins, immune complexes,
  or lectin pathway activation by polymeric IgA in IgA nephropathy (2), an increase
  in the formation of fluid phase C3 convertases in the presence of heme or fluid
  phase activating surface, and the stabilization of C3 (3) or C5 (4) convertases
  by pathological immunoglobulins, such as C3 and C5 nephritic factors. Red crosses
  represent potential defects in alternative complement pathway regulation in the
  fluid phase (1) and on the cell surface (2, 3). These defects in complement regulation
  could be the consequence of inhibition of the main alternative pathway regulator
  FH due to anti-factor H antibodies (such as in aHUS), a lack of function, or a quantitative
  deficiency of FH and FI due to pathological genetic variants. *CR1: weak expression
