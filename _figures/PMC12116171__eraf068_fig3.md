caption: 'Up-regulated circadian rhythm pathway and phenological effects of cul4 mutant.
  (A) Significantly up-regulated circadian rhythm pathway in cul4.5 compared with
  Bonus based on pathway enrichment analysis on RNA-seq conducted on seedlings (Z10).
  Orange: up-regulated in seedling; the green and white boxes are rice-specific and
  reference pathway, respectively. (Circadian rhythm—plant KEGG pathway identifier
  04712; abbreviations list found at https://www.genome.jp/pathway/ath04712.) (B)
  Awn tipping and Heading date in cul4.5 NIL compared with Bowman. Data presented
  as box plot with individual data (n≥7) shown by coloured dots. The box extends from
  25th to 75th percentiles and the horizontal line represents the median. Significant
  differences are shown: **P<0.01, according to Student’s t-test'
