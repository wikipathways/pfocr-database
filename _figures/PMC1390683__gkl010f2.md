caption: A model illustrating a role of BRCA1 in the C2/M cell cycle checkpoint. BRCA1
  can be phosphorylated by ATR, ATM and Chk2. BRCA1 regulates expression and cellular
  localization of Chk1, although it is not clear whether Chk1 can phosphorylates BRCA1.
  Both Chk1 and Chk2 inactivate Cdc25 by phosphorylate it at Ser-216. The phosphorylation
  of Cdc25 at Ser-126 not only inactivates this protein but also allows it to bind
  to 14-3-3α, leading to its exporting from the nucleus. This results in the decrease
  of the active form of Cdc25, which is a phosphatase involved in dephosphorylation
  of Cdc2. The dephosphorylated form of Cdc2 is the active form that promotes cell
  progression from G2 to M phase. Therefore, the reduced amount of Cdc25 results in
  the decrease of active form of Cdc2, which prevents G2 to M transition. Another
  two factors are also involved in this pathway. One is Cyclin B1, which forms an
  active complex with Cdc2 to promote cell progression from G2 to M phase, and the
  other is Wee1, a kinase that puts phosphate on an inhibitory site of Cdc2, thereby
  inhibiting function of Cdc2. Thus, expression changes of these genes could theoretically
  affect G2/M cell cycle checkpoint.
