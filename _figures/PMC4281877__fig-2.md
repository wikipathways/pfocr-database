caption: Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) proinflammatory signaling pathway and regulation
  by miR-181. NF-κB, a dimer often consisting of p50/p65 subunits, is normally resident
  in the cytosol and is maintained in an inactive form by its inhibitor IκB. Stroke
  stimulates mitochondria to release ROS that activate the IκB kinase (IKK) complex.
  The activated IKK complex phosphorylates IκB and initiates its ubiquitination and
  degradation, freeing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus, and binds the promoters
  of genes expressing proinflammatory cytokines, IκB, and other targets. miR-181 interacts
  with this pathway at multiple points. To see this illustration in color, the reader
