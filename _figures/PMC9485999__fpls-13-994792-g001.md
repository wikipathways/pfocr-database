caption: A schematic illustrating the assembly of multigene constructs based on the
  GGC. (A) Recognition sequence, cleavage site, and post-cleavage overhangs of two
  type IIS restriction enzymes (BsaI and BpiI). (B) The BsaI recognition sites (GGTCTC)
  and specific fusion sites (e.g., GGAG and ACAA) on both sides of each Level-0 module
  (e.g., promoter, UTR, ORF, 2A, and terminator) were introduced by primers. (C) Level-1
  module digestion-ligation process. Each expression cassette was assembled into Level-1
  destination vectors. (D) The final Level-2 modules construction process. Multiple
  Level-1 modules formed the final vector via a one-step digestion-ligation reaction
  of BpiI and T4 ligase. (E) Schematic diagram of T-DNA regions containing pathway
  genes involved in the synthesis of genistein and scutellarin. Part A, genistein;
  Part B, scutellarin; NPTII, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase from Tn5; Ω, tobacco
  mosaic virus 5′-leader sequence. 2A, Thosea asigna virus 2A.
