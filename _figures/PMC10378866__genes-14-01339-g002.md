caption: (A). Cobalamin-dependent enzymes, enclosed in red squares, with their corresponding
  reactions. (B). Cobalamin-independent counterparts, enclosed in green squares, with
  their corresponding reactions. (C). Adenosylcobalamin synthesis pathway; the anaerobic
  pathway represented by orange squares, the aerobic pathway by blue squares, and
  the rest of the proteins by light blue squares. Squares with black borders represent
  proteins that are essential for the synthesis of B12 and the dashed lines indicate
  which proteins are orthologs based on their sequence [].
