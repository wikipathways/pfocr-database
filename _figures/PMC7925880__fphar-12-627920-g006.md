caption: LREE regulates bile acid metabolism through intestinal flora. Red arrows
  and blue arrows indicate up-regulation and down-regulation after LREE treatment.
  Normally, most of the primary bile acids are produced by cholesterol through the
  classical metabolic pathway involving CYP7A1 and CYP8B1. Primary bile acids form
  conjugated bile acids through the bile duct and are discharged into the intestine.
  Most of the conjugated bile acids are reabsorbed by the ASBT/OST system and participate
  in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. A small proportion of conjugated
  bile acids are deconjugated and dehydroxylated by microbiota, converting to secondary
  bile acids. Different secondary bile acids can activate or inhibit FXR and lead
  to the release of FGF15. Subsequently, FGF15 entered the liver via the hepatic portal
  vein to inhibit the expression of CYP7A1 and maintain bile acid levels together
  with the reabsorbed bile acids. LREE can restore the expression of ASBT, OST-α,
  FXR, CYP7A1 affected by hyperlipidemia, restore the reabsorption of bile acids,
  and promote the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids. Meanwhile, LREE increases
  the synthesis of secondary bile acids and accelerates their excretion through intestinal
  flora. Increased bile acid metabolism will increase the rate of lipid metabolism
  and maintain lipid homeostasis in the body.
