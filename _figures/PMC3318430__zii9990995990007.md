caption: 'Hypothetical model for H. pylori Le antigen synthesis, based on galT and
  jhp0562 mutagenesis studies. In this model of Le antigen synthesis, we propose that
  the glycosyltransferases GalT and Jhp0562 contribute to both type 1 and type 2 antigen
  production, while the glycosyltransferase encoded by β-(1,3)galT is essential only
  for type 1 antigen production. galT is responsible for synthesis of N-acetyl-lactosamine,
  which is the precursor for type 2 antigens. As reported previously (), some type
  2 chains can be capped with a type 1 antigen, and thus galT also is essential for
  the expression of type 1 antigens in these instances. Jhp0562 has two functions:
  it acts as a reservoir for recombination with β-(1,3)galT (type 1 pathway), and
  in those strains in which it is present, it is an essential gene in type 2 Le antigen
  synthesis. The fact that wild-type H. pylori strains without jhp0562 are able to
  produce type 2 antigens but not type 1 antigens indicates that galT in those strains
  is sufficient for the type 2 pathway ().'
