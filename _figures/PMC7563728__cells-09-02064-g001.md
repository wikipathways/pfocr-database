caption: 'Metabolic pathways and Snail target enzymes of catabolic metabolism. Representative
  metabolic intermediates and enzymes of PPP, FAO, and the glycolytic pathway that
  constitute cancer cell catabolic metabolism in glucose-derived conditions are illustrated.
  Key metabolic enzymes (PFK-1, FBP1, and ACC2) targeted by EMT transcription factor
  Snail during catabolism are highlighted. Metabolic interaction between PPP, FAO,
  and the glycolytic pathway via key enzyme regulation induces the overall carbon
  flux toward catabolism and promotes cell survival via ATP and NADPH production.
