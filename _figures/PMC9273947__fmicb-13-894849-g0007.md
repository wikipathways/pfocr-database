caption: 'Model for utilization of extracellular DNA as a nutrient by Escherichia
  coli. DNA is caught by proteins on the outer membrane and ingested to the periplasm,
  where DNase digests DNA into small molecules. The expressed DNase is secreted from
  the cytoplasm to the periplasm. Small DNA molecules (~7 nt) and monomers are ingested
  into the cytoplasm by some specific proteins on the inner membrane. After digested
  to deoxyribonucleosides and even bases and deoxyribose, these small molecules enter
  the cycles of TCA (tricarboxylic acid cycle), PPP (pentose phosphate pathway), and
  GNG (gluconeogenesis). The small molecules can also be ingested from the environment
  directly to the cytoplasm. PDE: E. coli phosphodiesterase which hydrolyzes deoxyribonucleic
  acid only in the single-stranded form to yield mono- and dinucleotides; NupC: nucleoside
  transporter C; CFP: channel-forming protein; NS: nucleoside; NB: nucleobase; R5P:
  ribose 5-phosphate; F6P: fructose 6-phosphate; AC: acetyl-CoA; FA: fatty acid; OM:
  outer membrane; PS: periplasm; IM: inner membrane. Proteins of PII series are in
  charge of uptake of dsDNA.'
