caption: 'The de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway including 10 steps from
  phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP) is shown. Folate-dependent
  reactions (steps 3 and 9) in which 10-formyl THF (10-CHO-THF) serves as the one-carbon
  donor are catalyzed by GARFTase and AICARFTase. Undefined abbreviations: FAICAR,
  5-formamidoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide; FGAR, formyl glycinamide ribonucleotide;
  GAR, glycinamide ribonucleotide; PRPP, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate.'
