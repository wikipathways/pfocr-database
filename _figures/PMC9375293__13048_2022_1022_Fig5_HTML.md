caption: 'Role of DHFR and MTHFR in OC. DHFR and MTHFR are involved in the formation
  of important one-carbon units for purine metabolism. DHFR promotes drug resistance
  and inhibits omentum metastasis, while resisting apoptosis caused by TMZ through
  AMPK pathway activation and mTOR pathway inhibition. Berberine, PTX, MTX, and some
  quinoxalines (453R&311S) have been found to act as DHFR inhibitors. MTHFR inhibits
  FBP expression and enhances drug sensitivity, which is inhibited by HOTAIR. TMZ:
  temozolomide; PTX: pemetrexed; MTX: methotrexate; 453R: 3-methyl-7-trifluoromethyl-2(R)-[3,4,5-trimethoxyanilino]-quinoxaline;
  311S: 3-piperazinilmethyl-2[4(oxymethyl)-phenoxy]-quinoxaline; FBP: folate binding
  protein'
