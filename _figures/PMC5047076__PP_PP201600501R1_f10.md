caption: A working model on SH1-regulated hypocotyl elongation through modulating
  of the CsUVR8-mediated signaling pathway. Under UVB-free white light or monochromic
  lights, the plants will undergo photomorphogenesis mediated by phytochromes (Pr)
  or cryptochromes (Cry) via the CSCOP1/CsHY5 pathway. In -sensitive plants, the Sh1
  gene has high level of expression. The abundant SH1 chromatin remodeler protein
  alters the accessibility of CsHY5 transcription factor to activate cell-elongation-related
  genes for hypocotyl elongation.  inhibits Sh1 expression, reduces its abundance,
  and thus SH1 protein level, which allows increased CsHY5 expression and more binding
  to the promoter of cell-elongation-related genes to inactivate their expression,
  therefore hypocotyl elongation. In UVB-insensitive plants, the expression of sh1
  is always low regardless of the light conditions resulting in a similar outcome
  as Sh1 under .
