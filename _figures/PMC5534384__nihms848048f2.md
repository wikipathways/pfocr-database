caption: 'Resident adult hepatic/stem cells are activated from their niche after receiving
  certain factors and signals or transitioned from hepatocytes or myofibroblasts by
  ductal metaplasia or MET (Left column); and proliferated (Central column); then
  differentiated towards hepatocytes by the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  and the up-regulation of Wnt2 and Wnt9b, differentiated towards cholangiocytes by
  the activation of Notch signaling pathway, trans-differentiated into hepatic stellate
  cells by the up-regulation of TGF-β and CTGF, trans-differentiated into myofibroblasts
  by the up-regulation of Fox1 and TGF-β and the activation of non-canonial Wnt signaling
  pathway, and transformed into tumor-initiating cells by the up-regulation of TGF-β
  and Bmil and the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Right column). Abbreviations:
  MET, mesenchymal-epithelial transitions; HGF: hepatocyte growth factor; TGF-β: transforming
  growth factor-β; EGF, epidermal growth factor; aFGF, acidic fibroblast growth factor;
  TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL-6: interleukin-6; LT-β: lymphotoxin β; LT-α: lymphotoxin
  α: IFN-α: interferon α; IFN-γ: interferon γ; TWEAK: TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis;
  CTGF: connective tissue growth factor.'
