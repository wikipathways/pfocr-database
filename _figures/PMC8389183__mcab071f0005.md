caption: Biochemistry of prey decomposition in the digestive glands in the Dionaea
  trap. (A) In the resting gland, no enzyme production occurs and free ribosomes are
  only visible (black dots). (B) In the early phase, prey stimulates mechano-sensitive,
  chloride-permeable channels (FLYC) by touching the sensory trigger hairs that, with
  other, possibly Ca2+-permeable channels, mediate membrane depolarization. The generated
  action potentials and Ca2+ wave are propagated through plasmodesmata along the outer
  cell layers and lead to trap closure and activation of the JA signalling pathway
  in the digestive glands. Similar to non-CPs, jasmonic acid (JA) conjugates with
  isoleucine (JA-Ile), mediates degradation of JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) repressors
  and soon activates gene expression in the nucleus (N) to produce hydrolases (red
  dots). (C) In the later phase, substances (stimulants) derived from captured prey
  (*) penetrate the cuticular gaps. Ammonium ions released by deamination in traps
  induce H+ secretion into the fluid, and extremely low amounts of low molecular weight
  nitrogenous elicitors (amino acids and amines) enter the gland cell. Specific prey-derived
  molecules (e.g. chitin) activate receptors with a LysM domain and different kinases
  (Rec/Kin, blue membrane proteins, respectively), which mediate Ca2+-dependent and
  JA-mediated activation of further downstream responses. Zymogens are also gradually
  released from the vacuole (V). Enzymes (red dots) released from the cutinized wall
  directly elicit gap formation in the cuticle and secretion of digestive enzymes.
  Enzymes stored in the wall of the secretory cells may release active residues from
  prey proteins that further stimulate the gland. With progressing digestion, hydrolases
  and various transporters (green membrane channels) are intensively produced. The
  prey is decomposed in the fluid, which becomes strongly acidic and contains autoactivated
  proteases and oxidases (red dots). The digestive gland readily absorbs the released
  nutrients either by transporters or by endocytosis, and polysomes utilize them to
  synthetize novel proteins on membranes of the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). By the
  end of prey decomposition, the digestive gland cells are rich in exporting vesicules
  from the ER or Golgi apparatus (GA), and absorbed nutrients are also transported
  symplastically. The time course and overlap (in any) of the individual steps of
  mechanically (B) and chemically activated processes (C) are not fully imaged, and
  only the most typical components are indicated in both panels.
