caption: Model for lipid utilization during EV-A71 infection. The fatty acid biosynthesis
  pathway is used to generate ATP. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) converts acetyl-CoA
  to malonyl-CoA; Fatty acid synthase (FASN) catalyzes the continuous condensation
  reaction of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA to generate triglycerides. Triglycerides
  are then transported into mitochondria by carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1).
  In mitochondria, triglycerides undergo β-oxidation to acetyl-CoA, which drives the
  TCA cycle to generate ATP. ATP production supports DNA replication and protein synthesis
  of EV-A71. EV-A71 replication induces ER stress.
