caption: 'Aerobic phenylacetate catabolic pathway. A, reactions and intermediates
  of the pathway and proposed enzyme names are shown. 1, phenylacetate-CoA ligase
  (AMP forming); 2, ring-1,2-phenylacetyl-CoA epoxidase (NADPH); 3, ring-1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA
  isomerase (oxepin-CoA forming), postulated 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA isomerase; 4, oxepin-CoA
  hydrolase/3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+); 5, 3-oxoadipyl-CoA/3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA
  thiolase; 6, 2,3-dehydroadipyl-CoA hydratase; 7, 3-hydroxyadipyl-CoA dehydrogenase
  (NAD+) (probably (S)-3-specific). Later steps resemble β-oxidation and lead to acetyl-CoA
  and succinyl-CoA. Compounds: I, phenylacetate; II, phenylacetyl-CoA; III, ring-1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA;
  IV, 2-oxepin-2(3H)-ylideneacetyl-CoA (oxepin-CoA); V, 3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA
  semialdehyde, VI, 3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA. B, shown is the mechanism of hydrolytic
  ring fission by PaaZ-ECH or ECH-Aa. Proposed hydrolytic ring-cleavage of oxepin-CoA
  (IV) by PaaZ-ECH is via an acid-base mechanism. A conserved histidine and an aspartic
  acid (His-566 and Asp-561 in E. coli) may function as catalytic residues, whereas
  a conserved glycine (Gly-584) may form an oxyanion hole. This step is also catalyzed
  by ECH-Aa from A. aromaticum.'
