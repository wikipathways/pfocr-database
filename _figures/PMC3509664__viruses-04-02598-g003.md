caption: PKR and the Insulin signaling pathway. After binding of the insulin receptor
  to its different ligands, its intracytosolic chains autophosphorylate on tyrosine
  residues and phosphorylate the two substrates IRS1 and IRS2 on tyrosine residues
  to recruit the SH2‑containing Phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K). Lipid products generated
  by PI3K bind and activate Akt, which in turn activates mTORC1. The latter phosphorylates
  4EBP1 and RSK (Ribosomal S6 kinase). As a result, 4EBP1 dissociates from the cap-binding
  eIF4E protein and RSK phosphorylates the S6 ribosomal protein. The outcome of this
  is an increase in translation. Activation of the insulin receptor triggers also
  the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade (reviewed in []) leading to
  the transcription of factors required for cell proliferation and cycle. Akt also
  negatively regulates the Forkhead BoxO transcription factor FOXO1 by phosphorylation.
  This maintains FOXO1 in the cytosol in a complex with the 14-3-3 protein and prevents
  gluconeogenesis or transcription of IRS2 when not needed. Retro-control of the insulin
  pathway occurs through phosphorylation of IRS1 on serine residues by Akt, mTOR,
  RSK and by PKR, the latter acting through the intermediate IKKβ or JNK kinases.
  This prevents its interaction with the insulin receptor. However, PKR can also positively
  activate the insulin signaling by triggering FOXO1 dephosphorylation through the
  phosphorylation of B56α, the regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase PP2A.
