caption: Schematic diagram modeling the role of the Sp1–p11–TASK1 triad in neurodegeneration.
  a Physiological expression of the transcription factor Sp1 maintains baseline levels
  of p11, which regulates IME by controlling TASK1 trafficking from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane. p11–TASK1 complex dissociation is required
  to overcome ER retention and normal recycling of TASK1 to the surface. Under healthy
  conditions, when neuronal IME is fine-tuned, moderated Ca2+ influx, through GluRs
  and/or VSCCs, leads to physiological responses, which are controlled by mechanisms
  of intracellular Ca2+ buffering and extrusion. b In neurological conditions, over-expression
  and/or de novo expression of nNOS could be the switch on (star) to initiate a positive
  feedback loop that contributes to the degeneration and death of sick neurons. Usually,
  NO production in the nervous system is directed by Ca2+ influx driven by NMDA receptors.
  The calmodulin (CaM)–Ca2+ interaction, which is now enabled to activate nNOS, allows
  for the coupling of pathological NO synthesis to Ca2+ entry. NO reacts rapidly with
  the superoxide anion (O2−) to form the highly toxic product peroxynitrite (ONOO−)
  and/or promotes S-nitrosylation, triggering protein misfolding and aggregation,
  thus leading to neurotoxicity (omitted for simplicity). In addition, a persistent
  pathological concentration of NO, involving the sGC/PKG-RhoA/ROCK pathway (omitted
  for simplicity), induces Sp1 and stimulates the human p11 promoter depending on,
  at least, a Sp1-binding site (GC-box). Subsequent p11 upregulation sequesters TASK1
  to the ER, thus disrupting the normal recycling of this subunit to the surface.
  This TASK1 uptake/replenishment unbalance enhances IME, which, in turn, increases
  the opening probability of VSCCs and, GluRs in the presence of glutamate, thereby
  exacerbating Ca2+ entry into the cell. Ca2+ overload might contribute to neurodegeneration
  and, finally, to neuron death. Whether NO of glial origin and/or other unidentified
  factors promote Sp1 expression/binding and/or p11 expression are not discarded and
  merit for further investigation
