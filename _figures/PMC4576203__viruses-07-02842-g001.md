caption: Wnt/β-catenin cell signaling pathway. (A) In the absence of stimuli (OFF-STATE),
  the Fz receptors are regulated by a group of antagonist proteins, such as SFRP,
  which prevent further receptor-ligand interaction. In the cytoplasm, a degradation
  complex is formed, to which β-catenin is recruited and phosphorylated at specific
  residues by the GSK3β and CK1 kinases. These phosphorylated sites are recognized
  by βTrCP ubiquitin ligase, which mediates β-catenin proteosomal degradation. In
  the nucleus, the Groucho/TLE repressor binds to TCF/LEF, avoiding its transcriptional
  activation; (B) In the presence of Wnt ligands (ON-STATE), LRP5/6 and Fz dimerize;
  subsequently, Axin binds to LRP5/6, whereas Disheveled (Dvl) interacts with Fz,
  allowing Axin-Dvl binding and the disassembly of the β-catenin degradation complex.
  Finally, β-catenin is released in the cytoplasm and translocated to the nucleus,
  aided by its binding partner FOXM1, where it binds to TCF/LEF and detaches the Groucho/TLE
  repressor.
