caption: Signaling in T‐cell activation and PD‐1–mediated suppression. T‐cell activation
  through the TCR/CD3 complex leads to the phosphorylation of proximal signaling molecules
  that trigger downstream activation of NFAT, CREB, and p38 pathways. In the absence
  of a costimulatory signaling through CD28, TCR activation of T cells leads to a
  hyporesponsive, anergic state. Signaling through the CD28 costimulatory receptor
  enhances activation of the PI3K/AKT/NFκB pathways that support T‐cell proliferation
  and reduce apoptosis. Interaction of PD‐1 with PDL‐1 during T‐cell activation recruits
  the PD‐1/SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase complex into the vicinity of TCR/CD3 and the
  CD28 co‐receptor. This recruitment results in the dephosphorylation of membrane
  proximal PI3K, ZAP‐70 and the intracellular domains of CD28 and the CD3ζ chain,
  which suppresses T‐cell activation. In PD‐1 high exhausted T cells from chronically
  infected HIV donors, the ligation of PD‐1 with PDL‐1 results in reduced phosphorylation
  of TCR proximal Lck and Zap‐70 and downstream Erk1/2 in the Ras‐MEK1/2‐Erk1/2 pathway.
  PD‐1 suppression of T‐cell activation also results in reduced calcium mobilization
  that is upstream of CREB and NFAT transcription factors. In the CD28 costimulatory
  receptor pathway, ligation of PD‐1 with PDL‐1 significantly inhibits the PI3K/AKT/NFκB
  pathway with reduced phosphorylation of PDK1 and AKT
