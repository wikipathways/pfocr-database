caption: Proposed metabolic pathway of 3‐OH‐GA formation. Glutaryl‐CoA is formed within
  the catabolic pathway of lysine, tryptohan, and hydroxylysine. Deficient activity
  of glutaryl‐CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) results in elevated levels of glutaryl‐CoA.
  Glutaryl‐CoA can be degraded by MCAD (and lower activity of SCAD or LCAD), and the
  subsequent conversion of glutaconyl‐CoA to 3‐hydroxyglutaryl‐CoA (3‐OH‐GA‐CoA) is
  catalyzed by 3‐methylglutaconyl‐CoA hydratase (3‐MGH)
