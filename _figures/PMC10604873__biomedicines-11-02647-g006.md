caption: Possible mechanistic pathways of PIC, Vit D, or PIC-Vit D in protection against
  BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. BLM increased the expression of TGF-β and
  MDA and decreased the expression of GSH. TGF-β increased the expressions of HDAC2
  and HDAC4 and activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, resulting in an increase
  in the expression of ECM proteins such as α-SMA and collagen type I, as well as
  the proliferation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. BLM may also increase HDAC2
  and HDAC4 expression levels independently of TGF-β. HDAC2 and HDAC4 aided TGF-β
  in the activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. PIC, Vit D, or PIC-Vit D inhibited
  the expressions of TGF-β, HDAC2, and HDAC4 and inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway, resulting in lower levels of α-SMA and collagen type I. Image created with
