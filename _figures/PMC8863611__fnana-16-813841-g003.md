caption: Biosynthesis pathway of brain keratan sulfate. R-10G-positive (R-10G +) brain
  keratan sulfate (KS) is extended from the variable underlying the core glycans (R).
  The sequence of biosynthesis is C-6 sulfation (S) of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)
  residue exposed at the non-reducing terminal by GlcNAc6ST3 or GlcNAc6ST1 (), transfer
  of galactose (Gal) by a β1,4-galactosyltransferase, and then the transfer of GlcNAc
  by β1,3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 7 (Beta3Gn-T7; shown in this study). GlcNAc6ST3
  is a major KS GlcNAc6ST in the adult brain () and its contribution to KS synthesis
  in the developing brain is partially complemented by GlcNAc6ST1 (). β1,4-galactosyltransferase
  for KS synthesis in adult brains has not yet been identified. The KS structure extending
  from the R-10G + epitope can be additionally sulfated at some Gal residues by KSGal6ST
  (). The length and degree of sulfation of cerebral KS vary during brain development,
  maturation, and physiopathology.
