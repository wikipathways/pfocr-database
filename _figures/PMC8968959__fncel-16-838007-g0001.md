caption: 'EGF receptor signaling and resolving its dysregulation in aged oligodendroglial
  via protein-protein network analysis. (A) EGFR is a member of ERBB receptors that
  belong to the superfamily of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs). The binding of ligands
  to EGFR induces conformational changes resulting in the receptor homo- or heterodimerization
  at the cell surface. Dimerization of the extracellular regions of EGFR cascades
  results in further conformational change at the cytoplasmic region of the receptor,
  leading to the activation of the catalytic domain. EGFR dimers trans-autophosphorylate
  on tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail becoming binding sites for the recruitment
  of intracellular modulator for downstream signaling cascades. Recruitment of complexes
  containing GRB2 and SOS1 directly through GRB2 or indirectly through SHC1 promotes
  the activation of RAS/RAF/MAP kinase signaling. The binding of GRB2 and GAB1 to
  phosphorylated EGFR leads to the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling cascade. Finally,
  PLCγcan be recruited to the phosphorylated EGFR which, in turn, activates IP3/PKC
  signaling. Image generated from REACTOME “Signaling by EGFR” (https://reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#/R-HSA-177929).

  of genes expressed by myelinating OLs (MOL) and 251 genes were identified as significantly
  altered in aging (Rivera et al., ). (B) Functional protein-protein network analysis
  identified EGFR as centrally connected with ERBB3, NRAS, VCL, GSN, CLDN11, and the
