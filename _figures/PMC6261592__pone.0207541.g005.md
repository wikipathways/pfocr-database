caption: Primary and secondary metabolite data derived from GC-TOF-MS and UPLC-Q-TOF-MS,
  respectively. Data were normalized based on the growth rates () of S. coelicolor
  A3(2) in R2YE medium and were scaled to internal standards using methyl nonadecanoate
  (for GC-TOF-MS analysis) and adenosine 5′-monophosphate monohydrate (for UPLC-Q-TOF-MS).
  Metabolite data was selected by VIP values (> 0.7). The pathway map was modified
  from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).
  Fold change was normalized to an average of all values and is shown as blue (0)
  to red (2).
