caption: Cell network model of CD8Treg mediated regulation within the ARTIMMUS EAE
  simulator. Computer simulations commence following immunization with MBP, which
  DCs subsequently engulf and present on MHC class II molecules to facilitate activation
  of MBP-specific encephalitogenic CD4Th1 cells. Effector CD4Th1 cells migrate to
  the CNS and initiate the autoimmune pathway (red solid arrows) through microglia
  induced killing of neurons (our computational abstraction of demyelination within
  EAE). Effector CD4Th1 cells undergo activation-induced cell death at the end of
  the cell lifecycle. Apoptotic CD4Th1 cells migrate out of the CNS, and are efferocytosed
  by CLN and spleen-resident DCs. They may also be efferocytosed in the CNS by DCs
  that migrate to the CLN upon maturation. These DCs present TCR peptides, which initiate
  the down-regulatory pathway (blue dashed arrows) through activation of CD4Treg cells
  and CD8Treg cells [], and subsequent killing of the encephalitogenic CD4Th1 cells.
  On a population level, regulation of CD4Th1 cells leads to a type2 deviation [],
  resulting in down-regulation of the autoimmune response. Adapted from [].
