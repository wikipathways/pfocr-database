caption: In the absence of Wnt, β-catenin is regulated by the combination of binding
  to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin at the adherens junctions or degraded in
  the cytoplasm by the destruction complex (adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC), Axin,
  GSK3β). When Wnt signaling is activated, the destruction complex is inhibited, β-catenin
  is stabilized in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus for activation of
  target gene expression. Loss of E-cadherin expression can thus free up β-catenin
  bound at the cell junctions which in the absence of Wnt signaling would likely be
  degraded by the destruction complex, or in the presence of Wnt enhance nuclear accumulation
  and target gene expression.
