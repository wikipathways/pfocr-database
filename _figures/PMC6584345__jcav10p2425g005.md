caption: Regulation of NF-кB signaling pathway by bioactive peptides. As a member
  of the NF-кB/Rel family, NF-кB is a heterologous dimer composed of p50 and Rel A
  (p65). SP can transform the external information obtained from the binding of molecules
  to receptors into a signal that can be recognized inside tumor cells, which can
  then promote the expression of p65 in tumor cells and activate the nuclear transcription
  factor NF-кB.
