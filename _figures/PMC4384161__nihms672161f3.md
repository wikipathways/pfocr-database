caption: A. In the absence of amino acids and growth factors, mTORC1 is inactive.
  This is controlled by two separate signaling pathways. First, in the absence of
  amino acids GATOR1 is an active GAP towards RagA, causing it to become GDP bound.
  In this state, mTORC1 does not localize to the lysosomal surface. Secondly, in the
  absence of insulin or growth factors, TSC is an active GAP towards Rheb and stimulates
  it to be GDP bound. B. In the presence of amino acids and growth factors, mTORC1
  is active. Amino acids within the lysosome signal through SLC38A9 to activate the
  amino acid sensing branch. Ragulator is active, causing RagA to be GTP bound. This
  binding state is reinforced by the fact that GATOR1 in inactive in the presence
  of amino acids, as GATOR2 inhibits it. The Rag heterodimer in this nucleotide conformation
  state recruits mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface. In addition, the presence of insulin
  or growth factors activates a pathway that inhibits TSC, leaving Rheb GTP bound.
  In this state, Rheb activates mTORC1 when it translocates to the lysosomal surface.
