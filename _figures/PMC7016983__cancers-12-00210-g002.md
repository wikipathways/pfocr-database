caption: 'Metformin (MET) AMPK dependent signaling. An increase of AMP/ATP ratio activates
  AMPK/TSC2 signaling. TSC2 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2) activation results in RHEB-
  mTORC 1 complex inhibition (Ras homologue enriched in the brain). Another signaling
  pathway causing mTORC 1 inhibition is stimulated by hypoxia and DNA damage as a
  result of MET + Temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation synergistic effect. Hypoxia also
  inhibits indirectly mTORC1 by PML (promielocitic leukemia protein) activation. The
  right side of the scheme presents the effects of mTORC1 inhibition in the glioma
  cell. Inactivated mTORC1 reduces p70S6K (Ribosomal protein S6 kinase) activity resulting
  in the decrease of CAD (trifunctional multi-domain: carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase
  2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase). Reduced CAD limits pirimidine
  synthesis in GBM cells. Collaterally, the reduction of p70S6K activity has a negative
  influence on EF2 (Elongation factor 2) andeIF4B (Eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 4B) leading to limited protein synthesis. Contrary, the deactivation of mTORC1
  promotes ULK-1(autophagy activating kinase) and TFEB (Transcription factor EB) proautophagic
  factors supporting new lysosomes formation. The left side of scheme presents AMPK’s
  direct effect on lipids and glucose metabolism in GBM. Concerning lipids, AMPK promotes
  ATGL (Adipose triglyceride lipase) activity resulting in fatty acids’ catabolism,
  and regulates ACC’s (Acetyl-CoA carboxylase) activity in fatty acids synthesis.
  Additionally, it reduces HMG-CoA’s (HMG-CoA reductase) activity resulting in the
  reduction of cholesterol synthesis. As far as glucose metabolism is concerned, AMPK
  inhibits glycogen formation limiting GS (glycogenesis), promoting TBC1D1 (TBC1 domain
  family member 1) and it increases glucose uptake and glycolysis. To sum up, AMPK
  inhibits mTOR and improves metabolic reprogramming, which consequently suppresses
  tumor growth.'
