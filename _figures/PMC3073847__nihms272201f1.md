caption: 'TGF-β signaling pathway TGF-β is secreted in a latent form and activation
  is mediated by several molecules including furin and emilin. Active TGF-β peptides
  (TGFB1, 2, 3) bind to the Type II receptor (TGFBR2), which recruits and activates
  Type I receptors such as TGFBR1 or ACVRL1. The activated Type I receptor phosphorylates
  receptor-specific SMAD molecules: TGFBR1 phosphorylates SMAD2 and 3, and ACVRL1
  phosphorylates SMAD1, 5 and 8. These activated SMADs form a larger complex with
  Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus where they regulate gene transcription. Accessory
  receptors such as ENG have a role in the balance of ACVRL1 and TGFBR1 signaling
  to regulate endothelial cell proliferation. In addition to the classical SMAD signaling
  pathway, a SMAD-independent pathway using alternative molecules such as MAP3K7 can
  also mediate TGF-β signaling. TGFB: Transforming growth factor-β, TGFBR: Transforming
  growth factor-β receptor, EMILIN1: Elastin microfibril interfacer 1, SMAD: SMAD
  family member, MAP3K7: Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7, ENG: Endoglin,
  ACVRL1: Activin A receptor type II-like 1, FURIN: Furin'
