caption: BMP signaling in bone. BMP activity is antagonized by cognate binding proteins,
  including Noggin, Grem1, Chordin, CHL, and Fellistatin. BMPs bind to homomeric type
  II receptors, which transphosphorylases homomeric type I receptor to induce Smad-dependent
  and non-Smad-dependent signaling. In the Smad-dependent signaling, phosphorylated
  R-Smad (Smad1, 5, or 8) complexes with Smad4 and co-translocates into the nuclei,
  where they recruit co-factors and Runx2 to regulate osteogenic gene expression,
  for example, Runx2, Dlx5, and Osx. In the non-Smad-dependent pathway, phosphorylated
  TAK1 recruit TAB1 to initiate the MKK-p38 MAPK or MKK–ERK1/2 signaling cascade.
  MAPK phosphorylates Runx2, Dlx5, and Osx to promote their transcriptional activity.
  MAPK also phosphorylates Runx2 to promote the formation of Smad–Runx2 complex. I-Smad
  (Smad6 or 7) negatively regulates Smad signaling by preventing R-Smad phosphorylation,
  targeting R-Smad or type I receptor for ubiquitin–proteasome degradation with Smurf1
  and inhibiting R-smad/co-Smad complex nuclei translocation. Arkadia positively regulates
  Smad signaling by targeting I-Smads for ubiquitin–proteasome degradation. Ubc9/SUMO
  complex negatively regulates Smad signaling by targeting Smad4 for ubiquitin–proteasome
  degradation. BMP–Smad signaling promotes almost every step during osteoblast differentiation
  and maturation. BMP, bone morphogenetic protein.
