caption: For clarity, proteins and metabolites are presented with different geometric
  shapes in the relevant network in cortex (A) or hippocampus (B). Metabolite symbols
  with red were up-regulated while green were down-regulated. Proteins and treatment
  unrelated metabolites are shown as clear. Dotted lines show indirect interactions
  or regulations between the two parties, while solid lines show direct physical interactions
  (such as binding) of the two parties.
