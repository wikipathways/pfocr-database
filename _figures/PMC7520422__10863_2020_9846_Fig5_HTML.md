caption: Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is being synthesized by the induction of PC
  N-methyltransferase, PS decarboxylase and CDP-ethanolamine pathway. The increased
  PE content in cell membrane leads to the activation of PEBP, which desensitizes
  the cell from the proapoptotic signals. Conversely, PE directly modulates the chaperone
  functions of the membrane-associated proteins. PC - phosphatidylcholine, PS - phosphatidylserine,
  PEBP – phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein.
