caption: Hedgehog signaling pathway. In healthy livers, the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway
  is inactivated in response to the low-expression of the Hh ligands (a), and to the
  inhibition of the Hh ligands and the receptor Patched (Ptc) interaction by the over-expressed
  Hh-interacting protein (Hhip) (b). Thus, the Glioblastoma (Gli) proteins are phosphorylated,
  ubiquitinated, and degraded (c). Under chronic liver disease environment, hepatic
  cells are able to secrete Hh ligands (d) that through the interaction with Ptc liberate
  the protein Smoothened (Smo) (e). Smo inhibits Gli degradation allowing its translocation
  into the nucleus where regulates target genes involved in the transdifferentiation
  of HSC and in the liver sinusoidal endothelial cell capillarization (f).
