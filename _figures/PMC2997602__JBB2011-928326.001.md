caption: The signaling cascade of class I and IIa HDACs in the development of cardiac
  hypertrophy. Class I HDACs can be regulated by the Hopx/HDAC2/HSP70/KLF4 pathway.
  Cardiac hypertrophy is induced in Hopx transgenic mice through the recruitment of
  HDAC2. Hypertrophic stresses including pressure overload or agonist-induced HSP70
  expression are followed by its association with HDAC2. The resultant increase in
  HDAC2 activity decreases the expression of anti-hypertrophic mediators including
  KLF4 and Inpp5f. This diagram is adapted from the works of Kook et al. [] and Kee
  et al. [, ] (JCI, 2003; Circulation Research, 2008; JMCC, 2009). Class II HDACs
  can be activated by PKD or CaMK. They interact with MEF2. MEF2 also associates with
  GATA4 and NFAT transcription factor. NFAT can be triggered by calcineurin. Class
  IIa HDACs can repress cardiac hypertrophy through MEF2 either directly or indirectly.
