caption: The signaling network formed by the σB gene cluster is shown []. Environmental
  stress is received by the stressosome, whereas energy stress is sensed by a different
  branch of the pathway. Quorum sensing pathways from Pseudomonas aeruginosa [] are
  shown with their synthetic use to build pattern-forming programs in E. coli [].
