caption: A) Activity verified by HPLC-MS. The 3-oxo-group of the autoinducer is reduced
  to a 3-hydroxy-group. B) Proposed additional activity in the synthesis pathway of
  homoserine lactones. Due to the similarity of the verified substrate 3-oxo-C12-HSL
  to intermediates of the fatty acid cycle we propose the depicted additional activity.
