caption: Connective tissue associated signalling network common to various cardiac
  hypertrophy animal models and human cardiac disease. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  software was used to identify a signalling network associated with connective tissue
  disease, overlaid with average expression data common to various animal models of
  cardiac hypertrophy and human cardiac diseases. Pathway Builder was then used to
  create a signalling pathway, based on the Ingenuity signalling network, Biocarta's
  pathway database, and literature-based associations. TGF-β, which was not identified
  using microarrays but might nonetheless play a non-transcriptional role in heart
  disease, is shown as a plausible commonly activated pathway in the human failing
  heart and various animal models of cardiac hypertrophy. Also shown are the various
  extracellular matrix proteins that were transcriptionally up-regulated in animal
  models and human disease, based on microarrays. Signalling pathways associated with
  commonly down-regulated transcripts (e.g., AT1-R and EGFR) are also shown.
