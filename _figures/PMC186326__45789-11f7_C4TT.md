caption: Model for Fgf18 regulation of long bone growth. In a linear model of chondrogenesis,
  chondrocytes sequentially develop through reserve (R), proliferating (P), prehypertrophic
  (PH), and hypertrophic (H) stages. The rectangles indicate the relative expression
  domains of signaling molecules in the growth plate. Previous studies show that FGFR3
  inhibits (1) chondrocyte proliferation, (2) chondrocyte differentiation, and (3)
  Ihh expression in prehypertrophic chondrocytes (). Fgf18 is expressed in the perichondrium
  and is proposed to activate FGFR3 signaling in proliferating and prehypertrophic
  chondrocytes (green arrow). FGF18 may also signal to FGFR1 in hypertrophic chondrocytes
  and FGFR2 in the perichondrium and in trabecular bone. Decreased IHH signaling through
  Patched (PTC) and Smoothened (SMO) results in decreased PTHrP expression in the
  periarticular perichondrium and signaling to the PTHrP receptor (PTHrP-R) in prehypertrophic
  chondrocytes. PTHrP-R signaling delays chondrocyte maturation. FGF18 could inhibit
  chondrocyte proliferation either directly through the action of FGFR3 in proliferating
  chondrocytes or indirectly by repressing the Ihh–Patched–PTHrP signaling pathway.
  Contrary to its function in chondrogenesis, FGF18 positively regulates osteogenesis.
  In a linear model of osteogenesis, mesenchymal cells (MC) develop into osteogenic
  progenitor cells (OP), which express Cbfa1. OP cells then differentiate into mature
  osteoblasts (OB) which eventually become entrapped in bone as osteocytes (OC). In
  cortical bone, FGF18 promotes osteoblast maturation/proliferation, but has no effect
  on the formation of the osteoprogenitor cell population. This suggests that FGF
  signaling affects differentiation of the committed osteoprogenitor cell. The delayed
  formation of trabecular bone suggests that FGF18 signals directly through FGFR1
  or indirectly through other factors to regulate ossification of hypertrophic chondrocytes.
  FGF18 signaling to FGFR3 in proliferating chondrocytes and potentially to FGFR2
  in the perichondrium/periosteum or FGFR1 in hypertrophic chondrocytes places FGF18
  in a position to coordinate rates of growth and differentiation in developing bone.
