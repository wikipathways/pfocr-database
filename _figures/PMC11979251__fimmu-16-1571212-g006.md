caption: The crosstalk between immunogenic cell death (ICD) and different intracellular
  signaling pathways of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), stimulator of interferon genes
  (STING), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). MALT1 can suppress the NF-κB
  signaling pathway and induce ICD in myeloma. HN-1 treatment induces the release
  of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and triggers ICD by activating the STING pathway.
  IRE induces ICD in tumor cells by increasing the synthesis and secretion of damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs). Additionally, IRE can increase the release of HMGB1
  by binding to RAGE. HMGB1 activates the MAPK p38 pathway and upregulates the phosphorylation
  levels of MAPK-p38 and MAPK-ERK
