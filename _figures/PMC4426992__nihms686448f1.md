caption: 'Danger signals and host defense mechanisms. Danger signals are detected
  via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to prepare defensive responses. PRRs can
  be classified into two main groups, membrane associated and cytosolic. NOD-like
  receptors (NLRs) are cytosolic PRRs, and can detect diverse ligands including ATP,
  fatty acids and amyloid β. NLRP3, one of the best characterized NLRs, forms large
  multiprotein complexes termed inflammasomes. However, the mechanism by which the
  NLRP3 inflammasome detects such diverse ligands is unclear. Shown in this figure
  is the pathway for regulation of IL-1β. Danger signals such as PAMPs are detected
  by TLRs and induce the synthesis of pro-IL-1β. Pro-IL-1β is processed by the oligomerized
  NLRP3 complex leading to secretion of IL-1β. Although psychological stress is known
  to increase plasma levels of IL-1β, the mechanism by which psychological stress
  is detected by the innate immune system is not known. Abbreviations: AIM, absent
  in melanoma; DAI, DNA-dependent activator of interferon (IFN)-regulatory factors;
  IPAF, ICE-protease activating factor; NLRP, NLR family, pyrin domain-containing;
  NOD, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain.'
