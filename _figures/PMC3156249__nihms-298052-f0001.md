caption: Activation of the Rb pathway during senescence restricts B-sMyb action at
  multiple levels. At the DNA level, activating E2F complexes at the B-Myb promoter
  are replaced by inhibitory complexes between E2F4 and p107 and p130. At the RNA
  level, elevated levels of miR-29 and miR-30 base-pair to the 3′UTR of B-Myb mRNA,
  reducing its abundance. At the protein level, reduced expression of B-Myb-responsive
  genes lowers cyclin/cdk activity and the extent of activating phosphorylation of
  B-Myb. In addition, ubiquitylation and degradation of B-Myb, as well as preferential
  association with co-repressors, may further inhibit its ability to activate target
  genes.
