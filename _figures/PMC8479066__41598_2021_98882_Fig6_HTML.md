caption: 'Graphical Abstract: Cartoon representation of the molecular events cascade
  on exposure to Aβ1–42 in neuronal cells. Aβ1–42 has multifaceted effects on cells-1.
  Extracellular Aβ1–42 inhibits the levels of microtubule associated RTK ROR1, both
  at the transcript and protein levels thereby affecting the planar cell polarity
  pathway leading to the alteration of F:G actin dynamics. 2. Cytosolic Aβ1–42 affects
  microtubule dynamics by deregulation of MAP2. 3. Nuclear translocated Aβ1–42 up
  regulates the precursor miRNAs and NEAT1. Up regulated NEAT1 in the nucleus exerts
  a protective role by repressing miRNAs and stabilising p53. 4. The compounded effect
  of cytosolic and nuclear Aβ1–42 affects the mature miRNA pool, which targets and
  co-represses ROR1 and Vimentin.'
