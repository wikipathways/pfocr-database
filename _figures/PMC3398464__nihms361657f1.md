caption: 'Key branches of the insulin signaling cascade. Hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic
  pathways that are normally triggered by insulin are indicated in blue, whereas insulin-stimulated
  pathways that activate lipogenesis and MAP kinases are shown in red. Solid lines
  represent recognized pathways; dotted lines are less well-characterized or putative.
  Pointed arrowheads indicate stimulation of the immediately downstream molecule or
  process; flat arrowheads indicate inhibition. Thus, endpoints that receive signals
  from the insulin receptor via pathways with an even number of flat arrowheads (0
  or 2) are activated by insulin (Gluc uptake, TG-rich lipoprotein clearance, both
  mechanisms for Lipogenesis, Remnant lipoprotein clearance, and phosphorylations
  of ERK). Pathways with an odd number of flat arrowheads are inhibited by insulin
  (PTEN, PTPases, and Gluconeogenesis). Specific sites that become phosphorylated
  (p) upon insulin stimulation are indicated within yellow ovals, and numbers indicate
  residues in human sequences. Lipogenesis-I refers to lipogenesis that becomes activated
  independently from new protein synthesis; Lipogenesis-D depends on new protein synthesis.Abbreviations:
