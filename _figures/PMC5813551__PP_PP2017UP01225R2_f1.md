caption: 'Overview of the regulation of group-VII ERF factor stability in Arabidopsis.
  The stability of plant ERF-VII proteins is controlled by intracellular O2 and NO
  levels by means of the Arg-Cys/N-end rule pathway (NERP). The N-terminal Cys, exposed
  upon Met cleavage by MAP (Met aminopeptidase) enzymes, is susceptible to oxidation.
  Arginyl transferase (ATE) enzymes conjugate oxidized Cys (*Cys) to Arg, which in
  turn recruits the Arg-specific N-recognin PRT6 (), an N-end rule pathway-specialized
  E3 ubiquitin ligase that labels the substrate for degradation through the 26S proteasome
  (see Box 1 for additional details of the pathway). Cys oxidation can be promoted
  by specific thiol oxygenases called plant Cys oxidases (PCOs): In the presence of
  oxygen, PCOs convert Cys into Cys-sulfinic acid, which acts as an ATE substrate
  (). Therefore, PCOs target ERF-VII proteins to the proteasome in an oxygen-dependent
  fashion. Besides oxygen, nitric oxide (NO) also promotes ERF-VII turnover via the
  Arg-Cys/NERP, through a still-undetermined Cys-dependent mechanism (; ). Finally,
  although N-terminal Cys reactivity to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has not been assessed
  in ERF-VII proteins, *Cys forms generated in relation to H2O2 concentration () could
  in principle play a role in the pathway, by either working as an alternative ATE
  substrate or interfering with Cys-sulfinic acid catalysis. Plasma membrane localization
  has been observed for RAP2.3 () and RAP2.12 (; ). As the latter has been found to
  be associated with peripheral membrane proteins belonging to the ACBP (Acyl-CoA
  binding protein) family, it has been proposed that this interaction is useful to
  maintain an inactive pool of RAP2.12 factor at the plasma membrane (). ERF-VIIs
  have a primary role as master activators of the hypoxic metabolism. ERF-VII transcription
  factors (represented in this figure by the five subfamily members from Arabidopsis,
  AtRAP2.2/2.3/2.12 and AtHRE1/2) exert direct control on the hypoxia-inducible expression
  of plant anaerobic genes by binding an HRPE (hypoxia response promoter element)
  motif present in their promoters (e.g. ADH, PDC, LBD41, HRE1 and HRE2, and HRA1;
  ). The hypoxia-inducible factors HRE1 and HRE2 are further controlled at the posttranscriptional
  level through the Arg-Cys/NERP (). During hypoxic regulation, HRA1 acts as a feedback
  repressor of anaerobic gene expression, by interaction with RAP2.12 (). The SINAT
  pathway, which is an N-end rule pathway-independent proteolysis, is also shown.
  RAP2.12 can be ubiquitinated by the E3 ligases SINAT1/2 (). These proteins modulate
  the autophagy pathway and thereby enhance Arabidopsis tolerance to nutrient starvation
  (). In fact, autophagy responses are also activated during hypoxia and contribute
  to plant submergence tolerance (,  and ). This evidence suggests that an additional
  tier of regulation might connect the ERF-VIIs to submergence responses, through
  the SINAT factors. Solid lines refer to experimentally established reactions or
