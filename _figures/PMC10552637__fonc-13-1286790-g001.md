caption: Schematic diagram of the metabolic cycle of tetrahydrofolate (THF) and the
  one-carbon (C1) metabolic pathway. The representation depicts the different reactions
  involved in the metabolic cycle of THF and the different sources and sinks of one-carbon
  units. THF is a coenzyme that is involved in the transfer of one-carbon units in
  many metabolic reactions. The C1 metabolic pathway is responsible for the generation
  and utilization of one-carbon units.
