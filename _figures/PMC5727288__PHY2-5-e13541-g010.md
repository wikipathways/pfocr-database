caption: JAM‐A Barrier Promoting Signaling Pathway and Perturbations Induced by Ethanol.
  JAM‐A associates directly with ZO‐2, which forms a complex with Afadin and the guanine‐nucleotide
  exchange factor PDZ‐GEF1. This complex activates Rap2c by promoting GTP binding.
  Active Rap2c inhibits RhoA‐mediated activation of MLCK and downstream MLC phosphorylation
  which promotes barrier function. Ethanol exposure disrupts upstream targets, disinhibiting
  RhoA, and resulting in enhanced MLC phosphorylation. Contraction of the apical actomyosin
  ring follows, leading to an expanded paracellular space and increased solute flux.
  Perturbations induced by ethanol depicted as red lightning bolts. Arrows indicate
  activation, whereas bar‐headed lines indicate inhibition.
