caption: PA can be generated de novo,, by sequential enzyme-catalyzed acylations of
  glycerol-3-phosphate, or in response to cell signaling pathways (). Every glycerophospholipid
  generated in eukaryotic membranes transitions through PA, a pathway characterized
  by Eugene Kennedy and his colleagues more than half a century ago., Signal generated
  PA is formed by enzymes that modify existing lipids. These enzymes include lysophosphatidic
  acid acyltransferase (LPAAT) which acylates LPA, DAG kinase which phosphorylates
  DAG at the sn-3 position, and phospholipase D (PLD) which hydrolyzes the headgroup
  of a phospholipid, generally phosphatidylcholine (PC), triggering the release of
  choline.
