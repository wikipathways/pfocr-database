caption: 'The TRPM7 ion channel is involved in: (1) the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT); and (2) cell migration/invasion in breast carcinoma. Cells must convert their
  epithelial-like phenotype to mesenchymal-like phenotype in order to acquire a more
  invasive profile. This involves the loss of cell contacts, modification of the cytoskeleton
  and increased cell migration and invasion. Breast cancer cells overexpress the TRPM7
  channel, a chanzyme. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) allows an increase in the
  influx of calcium via the EGFR-phospholipase C (PLC) signaling pathway allowing
  the activation of the channel activity of TRPM7. The elevation of cytosolic calcium
  induces activation of ERK1/2 and the signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3), participating in the expression of vimentin, markers of EMT. The kinase
  activity of TRPM7 allows phosphorylation (P) of the heavy chain of myosin II (MHC)
  on the domain responsible for the assembly of myosin filaments, inducing decoupling
  of the cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton relaxation. Relaxation is associated inversely
  with regulation by cytoskeletal tension of SRY-Box Transcription Factor 4 (SOX4)
  expression, participating in the transcription of mesenchymal markers such as Snail1,
  FOXC2, GSC, SIX1, Twist1, HOXB7 and ZEB1. In addition, MHC phosphorylation by TRPM7
  promotes local relaxation of cortical tension and leads to the control of cell-cell
  adhesion and the transformation of focal adhesions into podosomes, participating
  in polarized cell movement. The association of TRPM7 with the actomyosin cytoskeleton
  is Ca2+-dependent, which means that the ion influx partly regulates the kinase domain
  via the interaction with its substrates. TRPM7 is also involved in the phosphorylation
  of Src and the downstream recruitment of signal molecules such as p38, ERK, JNK,
  involved in the migration, invasion and metastasis development of breast cancer
  cells. Created using source BioRender.com source, accessed on 5 October 2021.'
