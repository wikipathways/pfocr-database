caption: 'Diagram summarizing the mode of action of spray-dried plasma (SDP). Food
  antigens and products from commensal bacteria can enter into the intestinal lamina
  propria across M cells (in Peyer’s patches), by dendritic cells (DC), or by paracellular
  pathway. This results in activation of the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT),
  which induces an inflammatory response that can alter different intestinal functions
  such as intestinal barrier or nutrient absorption. GALT is interconnected to other
  mucosal surfaces like the Broncoalveolar-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (BALT) or the
  Genito Urinary-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GUALT) by the common mucosal immune system
  (CMIS). Plasma supplementation can modulate the immune response at the luminal level
  (e.g.: modifying the microbiota profile, reducing antigen and pathogen concentration
  by luminal binding). Moreover, biologically active compounds present in plasma supplements
  can also interact directly with mucosal immune cells. The plasma-induced changes
  in mucosal cytokine profile can prevent or reverse deleterious effects resulting
  from immune system activation'
