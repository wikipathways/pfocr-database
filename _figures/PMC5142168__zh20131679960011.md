caption: Model for inhibition of HCO3− absorption by HMGB1 in the MTAL. Extracellular
  HMGB1 activates a basolateral RAGE-RhoA-ROCK1 signaling pathway coupled to inhibition
  of the basolateral Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1. Inhibition of NHE1 results secondarily
  in inhibition of apical NHE3 through actin cytoskeleton remodeling, thereby decreasing
  HCO3− absorption (, , , ). Arrows do not necessarily imply direct relationships;
  regulatory steps may involve additional signaling components. See text for details.
