caption: 'Hypothesised triggers and drivers in diet-induced dysbiosis. Progression
  from homeostasis to clinical manifestation of metabolic dysfunction may emerge from
  shifts in microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs; green) and metabolites (blue),
  initiated by long-term consumption of diets with reduced amount of dietary fibre
  but high saturated fat. A: Reduction in the availability of fermenting substrates
  in conjunction with excess secretion of anti-bacterial bile acids can alter the
  competition dynamics of commensal organisms and pathobionts. Consequent depletion
  of polysaccharide A and butyrate promotes immune dysfunction by altering the balance
  of regulatory T cells (TReg) and helper T cells (THelper); B and C: Shifts in microbial
  products contribute to the impairment of gut barrier function and the leakage of
  MAMPs; D: Dietary factors, microbial signals and host responses act in concert to
  drive inflammation, which provides a positive feedback pathway in favour of chronic
  disease development.'
