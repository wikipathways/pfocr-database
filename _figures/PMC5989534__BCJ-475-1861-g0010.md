caption: The mechanism by which LRRK2 is activated in vivo has not been elucidated.
  It is also not known what maximal activation of LRRK2 kinase activity is achievable.
  It is thought that the LRRK2 pathogenic mutations cause only a partial activation
  of LRRK2. Mutations in the kinase domain, such as G2019S, induce a moderate ∼2-fold
  activation of LRRK2, perhaps by stabilising the active confirmation of the kinase
  fold. Pathogenic mutations in the ROC/COR domain of LRRK2, such as R1441G/C, increase
  LRRK2 kinase activity ∼3–4-fold. Three recent papers [–] indicate that the ROC/COR
  mutations, promote recruitment of LRRK2 to the Rab29 protein that is located at
  the Golgi, which leads LRRK2 activation through an as yet unknown mechanism. VPS35
  and Rab29 could operate in the same pathway with LRRK2 []. Our work shows that the
  VPS35[D620N] mutation through an unknown pathway is inducing a higher 5–6-fold activation
  of LRRK2 than achieved with the known pathogenic mutations. Indeed, this is supported
  by age-of-onset data shown in  that suggest that Parkinson's patients with VPS35[D620N]
  develop the disease at a younger age than those with LRRK2 mutations. In future
  work, it would therefore be vital to define the mechanism by which VPS35[D620N]
  is activating LRRK2 and explain why VPS35[D620N] mutations induce a greater activation
  of LRRK2 than observed with the LRRK2 pathogenic mutants. We propose that by understanding
  this mechanism it might be possible to develop compounds that target the retromer
  complex that suppress activation of LRRK2.
