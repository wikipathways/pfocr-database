caption: L-Glutamate, an excitatory amino acid, is synthesized from L-glutamine by
  glutaminase, and metabolized to L-glutamine by glutamine synthetase. In addition,
  L-glutamate is metabolized to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory amino acid,
  by glutamic acid decarboxylase. D-Serine is synthesized from L-serine by serine
  racemase (SRR), and is metabolized by D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO). L-Serine is converted
  to glycine by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). Phencyclidine (PCP) is an
  ion-channel blocker of the NMDA receptor. Glycine and D-serine are endogenous co-agonists
  of the glycine modulatory site on the GluN1 subunit. Glutamate is an endogenous
  agonist at glutamate sites on the GluN2 subunit. Thus, glutamine-glutamate-GABA
  cycle plays a key role in the NMDA receptor neurotransmission. (A slight modification
  with ref. ).
