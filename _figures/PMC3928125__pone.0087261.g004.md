caption: The cBRs encoding G-proteins and 14-3-3 proteins (4A), proteins in ubiquitin
  dependent degradation pathways (4B), cysteine and serine proteases (4C), and alpha
  and beta amylases (4D) with diverse expression patterns were shown. Log2 of average
  fold changes in reference to dry seeds over the course of germination for each cBR
  was graphed. Dry, middle (Mid) and end (End) points of germination were indicated
  X-axis. The diagram of ubiquitin dependent degradation pathway was displayed in
  4B.
