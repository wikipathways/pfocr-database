caption: 'Illustration of proposed mechanisms of stem cell therapy in rescuing ischemia-reperfusion
  induced acute kidney injury. The therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells,
  induced pluripotent stem cells, and their conditioned medium containing soluble
  factors and extracellular vesicles include: (1) Anti-oxidation, which may act through
  activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway and, subsequently, upregulation of antioxidative
  enzymes against oxidative stress; (2) anti-inflammation, via immunosuppressive effects
  on immune cells and inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity; and (3) anti-apoptosis,
  possibly through decreased tumor necrosis factor-induced intrinsic apoptosis signaling.
  Abbreviations: Nrf2, NF-E2-related factor 2; ARE, antioxidant responsive element;
  TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; TRAIL, TNF-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand; TEC, tubular epithelial cell; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;
  MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; IFN-γ, Interferon-γ.'
