caption: 'Sphingolipids and complement components signaling in glioblastoma. A zoomed
  coronal plane view of a glioblastoma tumor and its microenvironment. (A) In glioblastoma
  tumor, the US28 receptor stimulates SPHK1 in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway
  to release S1P, which exits the cell through an S1P transporter, like SPNS2, to
  engage with S1PR1. S1P/S1PR1 signaling activates AKT, JAK2, STAT3, and cMYC pathways
  to promote glioblastoma pro-survival phenotype. A study has shown that the S1P-S1PR1
  signaling pathway activates AKT, which in turn triggers intracellular C3 cleavage
  into biologically active C3a and C3b via CTSL protease [56]. This activation enables
  PPIL1-C3b binding that induces NLRP3 inflammasome. The result of this process is
  the development of metastatic phenotype in melanoma, breast, and head and neck cancers.
  This mechanism may also be applicable to glioblastoma. The mitochondria-associated
  protein, Bcl2L13, is upregulated in glioblastoma and binds CerS2 and CerS6, inhibiting
  apoptosis by blocking ceramide synthesis. (B) Exposing glioblastoma to TGF-β increases
  mRNA expression levels for C3aR, C3, CTSL, and growth factors. (C) In the tumor
  microenvironment, mesenchymal stem-like cells (MSLCs) secrete the C5a anaphylatoxin,
  which binds to the C5aR expressed on glioblastoma tumors. C5a–C5aR1 signaling stimulates
  a metastatic phenotype on glioblastoma by increasing ZEB1 expression via the p38
  MAPK pathway. FTY720 treatment internalizes CXCR4 on glioma-associated microglia
  to inhibit the metastatic phenotype of glioblastoma cells. In tumor-associated macrophages
  (TAMs), the nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 (NFAT1) stimulates C3 transcriptional
  activity and increases C3a secretion, which binds C3aR in an autocrine manner. In
  a positive feedback loop, C3a-C3aR signaling activates the Ca2+-NFAT1 pathway, which
  induces M2-like TAMs and promotes glioma stem cells (GSCs) malignant phenotype.
