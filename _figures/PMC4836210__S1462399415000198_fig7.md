caption: Graphic representation of apoptosis and viral replication. Viral infection,
  in general, can induce both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Viruses
  like CHIKV, CCHFV and RVFV initiate extrinsic signals through cell death ligands
  (e.g. FasL, APO-2L, TRAIL, TNF), causing caspases-8 activation which then triggers
  caspases-3, -6 and -7). AHSV and WNV directly trigger caspase 3; however, CHIKV
  targets caspase 9. DENV and WNV affect the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis through
  stimulation of P53. Once P53 is activated, mitochondria-dependent apoptosis can
  be activated. Viral infection can also induce PKR and this kinase can affect eIF2a,
  resulting in activation of effector caspases and initiation of apoptosis. Viruses
  can also have anti-apoptotic activity. DENV, WNV and JEV trigger survival signalling
  through PI3K-AKT signalling pathway. PKR can be initiated by Sindbis virus which
  leads to inhibition of cellular translation through eIF2a phosphorylation, suppressing
  Mcl-1 biosynthesis. Sindbis virus can regulate 14-3-3 through activation of JNK
  followed by induction of PKR (for other details see text). AHSV, African horse sickness
  virus; CHIKV, Chikungunya virus; CCHF, Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever virus; DENV,
  Dengue virus; FasL, Fas (Apo-1/CD95) ligand; JEV, Japanese encephalitis virus; JNK,
  c-Jun N-terminal kinases; TNF, tumour necrosis factor receptor; TRAIL, TNF-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand; PKR, (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase; RVFV, Rift valley
  fever virus; WNV, West Nile virus.
