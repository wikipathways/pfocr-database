caption: 'Glycosylation pathway for CDG with liver involvement, in three stages: (1)
  Synthesis of nucleotide‐linked sugars (GDP‐mannose and others) from glucose‐1‐phosphate
  in the cytosol. In PGM1‐CDG, MPI‐CDG, and PMM2‐CDG, these first steps are interrupted.
  GDP‐mannose and other sugar units are attached to dolichol phosphate to form glycan
  chains on the outside of the ER. (2) The resulting oligosaccharide is flipped into
  the ER lumen, where further sugar units are added. (3) The glycan chain is transferred
  to a protein and transported to the Golgi, where different factors are responsible
  for accurate final processing (such as homeostasis factors, transporters for the
  influx of ions and metabolites, and trafficking proteins). Transferrin is one of
  the resulting N‐glycosylated proteins and normally has two glycan chains with four
  sialic acid residues (tetrasialo‐transferrin). In type I CDG, one whole glycan chain
  is missing (disialo‐transferrin). In type II CDG, individual sugar units are missing
  (possibly resulting in mono‐ and/or trisialo‐transferrin isoforms).'
