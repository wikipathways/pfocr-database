caption: Migraine‐associated mutation led to reduced expression of the Na,K‐ATPase
  α2 isoform that, in turn, increased the expression of the α1 isoform. This was associated
  with unbalanced signaling of the Src/Ras/Erk1/2 pathway, leading to uncoupling of
  the electron transport chain. Mitochondrial uncoupling in combination with heart
  failure–associated metabolic shift toward fetal programming accompanied by increased
  level of lactic acid and H+ leak through the inner mitochondrial membrane led to
  oxidative stress. Oxidative stress further increases H+ leak across the inner mitochondrial
  membrane and thus establishes a positive feedback loop. This was associated with
  ventricular dilation and reduced cardiac performance. Pathological conditions are
  identified in red font, red arrows, and red text boxes. LDH indicates lactate dehydrogenase;
  PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; and TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
