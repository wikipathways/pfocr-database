caption: The TGF-β signaling pathway. Binding of TGF-β to TGF-β receptor II recruits
  TGF-β receptor I (TGF-βR-I). The kinase domain of TGF-βR-I phosphorylates Smad2
  and 3, which form a heteromeric complex with Smad4 that translocates into the nucleus
  where it activates transcription of target genes. Numbers indicate points in the
  pathway where PPARγ ligands have been demonstrated to interfere with TGF-β signaling.
  (1) GW7845, a PPARγ ligand, inhibited Smad3 phosphorylation in human hepatic stellate
  cells []. (2) 15d-PGJ2 inhibited nuclear translocation of Smad2/3 in rat kidney
  fibroblasts []. (3) In human renal mesangial cells, 15d-PGJ2 induced hepatocyte
  growth factor (HGF), which upregulates the Smad corepressor TG-interacting factor
  (TGIF) []. (4) In mouse L929 fibroblasts, 15d-PGJ2 or retinoic acid upregulated
  the phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), leading to
  repression of TGF-β1 transcription [].
