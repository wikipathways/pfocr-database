caption: An example of PSCP files in which multiple microarray datasets were analyzed
  simultaneously. When the pathway tag labeled as 'Cholesterol Synthesis' in Fig.
  3 is clicked, the PSCP file is accessed. The numbers displayed proximal to the gene
  tags (or divided boxes) are the fold changes of the specific genes.
