caption: Schematic diagram of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway mechanism. The cGAS-STING
  pathway serves as the central regulatory network for cytoplasmic DNA-triggered immune
  responses. The cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS recognizes aberrant dsDNA, such as nuclear
  or mitochondrial DNA leakage caused by DNA viral infection, genomic instability,
  or radiotherapy-/chemotherapy-induced damage. This recognition induces conformational
  changes and activates cGAS. Activated cGAS synthesizes the second messenger molecule
  cGAMP from ATP and GTP. cGAMP binds to STING on the ER, triggering its conformational
  rearrangement and subsequent translocation from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Following
  palmitoylation at the Golgi, STING recruits TBK1. TBK1 phosphorylates the C-terminal
  domain of STING and facilitates the recruitment of IRF3. Phosphorylated IRF3 dimerizes,
  translocates to the nucleus, and initiates the transcription of IFN-I, thereby activating
  downstream immune responses. Concurrently, the STING-TBK1 signaling axis activates
  IRF3 and NF-κB, respectively, to induce the expression of IFN-I and pro-inflammatory
  factors. Subsequently, IFN-I synergistically enhances immune responses through downstream
  signaling pathways. This cascade enhances immune processes such as antigen presentation,
  T cell activation, NK cell cytotoxicity, and antibody production. By bridging innate
  immunity and adaptive immunity, the cGAS-STING pathway reshapes the TIME into an
  immunostimulatory niche, offering a promising therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy
