caption: Molecular pathways affected by panobinostat and sorafenib. Besides the classical
  effects of HDACi on transcriptional regulators (e.g. p53, miRNAs, HDAC) and the
  regulation of p21cip1/waf1 expression, panobinostat is also capable to induce canonical
  (death-receptor and mitochondria related) and alternative cell death pathways (e.g.
  ER stress, unfolded protein response and autophagy). Although the effects of deacetylase
  inhibitors on protein folding and function are not completely understood, the inhibition
  of non-nuclear HDAC enzymes influences protein stability and enzymatic activity
  of various cellular proteins, including the destabilization of the hypoxia sensor
  Hif-1α and the function of different protein kinases. In addition, the expression
  of these proteins can also be affected via the shown influence on transcriptional
  control processes. The multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib is predominantly inhibiting
  the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway and thus inhibits processes related to angiogenesis, proliferation
  and survival. Together, both compounds synergize at the level of protein kinases
  and their downstream effectors leading to inhibition of tumor growth.
