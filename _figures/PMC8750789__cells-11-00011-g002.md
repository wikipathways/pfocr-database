caption: 'Summary of the molecular and cellular functions of AUTS2 in neurodevelopment:
  (A) Cytoplasmic AUTS2 activates the Rac1 signaling pathway via P-Rex1 and Elmo2/Dock180
  complex, promoting neuronal migration and neurite extension. In contrast, AUTS2
  inhibits Cdc42 activities to suppress filopodia formation. (B–D) In cell nuclei,
  AUTS2 activates gene transcription through histone modification by interacting with
  the PRC1 complex (B). AUTS2 represses the monoubiquitylation activity of RING1B
  by recruiting CK2 while promoting histone acetylation via P300. (C) AUTS2 controls
  neuronal differentiation from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) through transcriptional
  activation of the sphingolipid-producing enzyme gene, St3gal5. In mESC, AUTS2 expression
  is repressed by globo-series glycosphingolipids generated from Gb3 synthase, Gb3S.
  (D) AUTS2 modulates the E/I balance by limiting the number of excitatory synapses.
  Loss of Auts2 leads to increased dendritic spine formation, disturbing the E/I balance
  within neural circuits. AUTS2 regulates the expression of the gene related to synapse
  development and functions. Moreover, Auts2 mutant mice display behavioral abnormalities
  in social interaction, vocal communication, cognition, and motor skills. Illustration
