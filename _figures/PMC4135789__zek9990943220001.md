caption: Glucose and glutamine utilization by Toxoplasma gondii. Glucose (Glc) is
  scavenged from the host cell by the GT1 glucose transporter and metabolized by either
  the apicoplast pathway or the cytosolic pathway. Glutamine (Gln) is scavenged by
  an unknown transporter, where it is converted to glutamate that can be utilized
  by the mitochondrial Krebs cycle as either α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) or succinate (via
  the GABA shunt).
