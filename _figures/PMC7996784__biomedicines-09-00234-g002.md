caption: An overview of the mevalonate and methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathways in
  Cannabis sativa. The MEP (A) and MVA (B) pathways both produce terpenoid precursors,
  as well as the substrate for cannabinoid production, GPP. (A) The MEP pathway begins
  in the plastid with the condensation of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  by DXS to produce DXP, prior to a series of enzymatic reactions to produce HDMPP.
  HDR then converts HDMPP to IPP and DMAPP, serving as the precursor to GPP, GGPP,
  and subsequently monoterpene and diterpene production. (B) The cytosolic MVA pathway
  is initiated by the conversion of acetyl-CoA to HMG-CoA and then to MVA, catalysed
  by the regulated, and rate-limiting enzyme, HMGR. MVA undergoes phosphorylation
  and then is decarboxylated to produce IPP, which is then converted to FPP as the
  basis for sesquiterpene and triterpene synthesis, or for GPP production for use
  in the cannabinoid biosynthesis pathway.
