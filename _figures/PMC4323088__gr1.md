caption: FGF-FGFR signaling pathway. The signaling cascade commences upon the formation
  of an FGF binding complex, consisting of two FGF ligands, two heparin sulfate chains,
  and two FGFRs. Signal transduction largely follows one of three pathways. The RAS/MAP
  kinase pathway, initiated upon the formation of an FRS2 complex, controls cell proliferation
  and differentiation. The PI3/AKT pathway is also initiated by the formation of an
  FRS2 complex, and regulates cell survival and fate determination. Finally, upon
  binding of PLCγ to the activated FGFR, DAG and IP3 are formed, activating PKC. The
  PLCγ pathway influences cell morphology, migration, and adhesion.
