caption: A model for Rac1 involvement in TGF-β1–driven renal fibrosis. Rac1 is rapidly
  activated in response to TGF-β1 stimulation and likely facilitates the assembly
  of NOX1 and NOX2 signaling complexes in the renal cellular plasma membrane. NADP(H)-mediated
  generation of free radicals in response to TGF-β1 induces ATM and p53 phosphorylation
  as well as EGFR and c-Src activation. The resulting accumulation of p-p53Ser15 and
  pSMAD3 transcriptional complexes on the promoter of TGF-β1 target genes mediates
  fibrotic reprogramming and PAI-1–dependent cell cycle arrest. Rac1b and NOX subunit
  expression is dramatically increased in UUO-driven renal injury. Chemical blockade
  of Rac attenuated progressive renal fibrosis and Rac1b, NOX, YAP/TAZ, p53, and EGFR
  activation in the kidney. Therefore, Rac1 is a new non-SMAD control element of the
  TGF-β1 pathway and a novel therapeutic target against CKD.
