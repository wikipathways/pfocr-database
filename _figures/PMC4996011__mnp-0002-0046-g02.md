caption: Altered enzyme and metabolite levels of the citric acid cycle in NAc and
  ACC in shocked mice. In NAc (a) and ACC (b), enzymes and metabolites involved in
  the citric acid cycle were downregulated in the shocked mice. Oval- and rectangle-shaped
  boxes represent enzymes and metabolites of the citric acid cycle, respectively.
  Red and blue boxes indicate increased and decreased levels, respectively, in the
  shocked mice compared to control mice. Red and blue box shade intensities represent
  the level of fold change expressed by log2 ratio (colors refer to the online version
  only).
