caption: 'Synthetic pathway of gangliosides, and the RCAS/Gtv-a system used to generate
  gliomas in miceFig. 1a: The majority of glycosphingolipids are generated from glucosylceramide
  (GlcCer). In the normal brain, major gangliosides consist of GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and
  GT1b. Gangliosides deleted in GD3S-KO mice are indicated by a square.Fig. 1b: The
  RCAS/Gtv-a system used to generate gliomas in mice is shown. To clarify the roles
  of GD3S in gliomas, we used GD3-expressing (WT) and GD3S-KO mice. By injecting DF1
  chicken fibroblast cells producing RCAS virus with PDGFB cDNA into newborn transgenic
  mice of Tv-a, astrocyte-lineage gliomas can be found at 1–2 weeks after injection,
  when p53-KO-background mice are used.'
