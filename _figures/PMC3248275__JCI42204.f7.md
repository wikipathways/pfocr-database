caption: In prepubertal glands, when E2 levels are low and ERα levels are relatively
  high, IGF-1 stimulates the formation of ERα/IRS-1 complexes and activation of IRS-1,
  which directs signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway
  induces cyclin D1 expression and mammary epithelial proliferation. Cyclin D1 levels
  are regulated at the level of protein stability, through inhibition of Thr286 phosphorylation
  and ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Activation of the Akt pathway also induces phosphorylation
  of c-Raf, which inhibits transduction via the MAPK pathway. In postpubertal glands,
  ERα expression is downregulated in response to elevated E2. In postpubertal Tg glands,
  the combination of IGF-1 and E2 further reduces ERα levels. Due to this downregulation,
  ERα/IRS-1 complexes do not form, and the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathway is not activated.
  However, Shc activation is maintained, allowing signal transduction via the MAPK
  pathway, which does not result in increased cyclin D1 expression or epithelial proliferation.
