caption: The abundance of features assigned to Glycolysis, Pentose Phosphate pathway,
  Amino acid metabolism, the TCA cycle and the Urea cycle, in RE (red) and AM (blue).
  The bars represent the mean values with the S.D. and black asterisks indicate statistically
  significant differences (p < 0.05) between RE and AM. Metabolites that were not
  detected in these pathways are shown as crossed circles.
