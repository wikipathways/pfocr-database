caption: i NCT-58 targets the C-terminal domain of HSP90 independent of the HSR and
  effectively induces apoptosis via the activation of cleaved caspase-3/7. ii NCT-58
  downregulates the expression and phosphorylation of HER2, HER3, and EGFR as well
  as suppresses truncated p95HER2 accumulation and Akt activation, concomitant with
  downregulation of the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk signaling pathway. iii NCT-58 kills not only
  proliferating tumor cells, but also eliminates BCSC-like cells. The latter responses
  are accompanied by the reduction of stem/progenitor markers CD44/ALDH1 and expression
  of the pluripotent transcription factors Nanog/Oct4/Sox2 as well as downregulation
  of HSF-1/HSF70/HSP90. [Heat shock response, HSR; Heat shock factor-1, HSF-1, Heat
  shock element, HSE].
