caption: 'miR-122 in NAFLD/NASH. Expression levels of miR-122 were found to increase
  during early NAFLD development but decline with progression towards NASH and cirrhosis.
  miR-122 expression is controlled by pathways involving the transcription factors
  RORA and C/EBPα and the pro-fibrogenic factors TGF-β and NEAT1. Data regarding the
  role of miR-122 in early NAFLD are conflicting: miR-122 was shown to target both
  positive (AGPAT1 and DGAT1) and negative (SIRT1, HCBP6, YY1 and Insig1) regulators/effectors
  of lipogenesis and to affect hepatic lipid metabolic pathways (cholesterol synthesis,
  VLDL export and fatty acid (FA) oxidation) in both a pro- (lower part of figure)
  and anti-steatotic (upper left part of figure) direction. miR-122 was found to contribute
  to maintaining insulin sensitivity by targeting PTP1B, a negative regulator of insulin
  signalling. Loss of miR-122 has been implicated in fibrosis development by de-repression
  of the targets FN1 (a fibrosis constituent) and SRF and KLF6 (pro-fibrogenic transcription
  factors), P4HA1 (a collagen maturation enzyme) and GLS/SLC1A5 (effectors in the
  glutaminolytic pathway, a process progressively deregulated with NASH fibrosis).
  miR-122 was shown to protect against hepatic inflammation by targeting RELB, a member
  of the NF-κB family of transcription factors. Finally, miR-122 was found to target
  CIDEC, a factor associated with NAFLD to NASH progression. Grey arrows: Regulation
  of upstream factors found to control miR-122 expression in NAFLD/NASH. Blue/red
  arrows: Increased or decreased activities in pathways/processes as a result of miR-122
  actions, leading to favourable (blue) or unfavourable (red) effects on liver metabolic
  function. Note that the downregulation of miR-122 levels with NAFLD progression
  leads to opposite effects of those illustrated.'
