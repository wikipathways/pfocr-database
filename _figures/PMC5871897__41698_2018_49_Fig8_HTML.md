caption: 'KYA1797K as a potential strategy to overcome resistance to EGFR targeting
  drugs in CRC. a A schematic representation of several therapeutic agents targeting
  the EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway including EGFR antibody drug cetuximab, FTase (farnesyl
  transferase) inhibitor SCH66336, KRAS-G12C specific inhibitor ARS-853 and those
  targeting Wnt/β-catenin pathways, including the IWR-1 and XAV939 TNKS (tankyrase)
  inhibitors and KYA1797K targeting RGS-Axin. b Differences in the mode of actions
  of TNKS inhibitors and KYA1797K. Left: TNKS inhibitors indirectly target the destruction
  complex by inhibiting the TNKS-mediated Axin destabilization which may change the
  balance of the β-catenin destruction complex components. Right: KYA1797K directly
  targets the destruction complex by binding to Axin-RGS which enhances the formation
  of the β-catenin destruction complex leading to increased GSK3β activity without
  changing the stoichiometry of the β-catenin destruction complex. F, farnesylation;
  PAR, poly-ADP-ribosylation; Dotted line, not experimentally confirmed'
