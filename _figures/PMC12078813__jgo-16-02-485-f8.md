caption: Mechanism of TD formation. Tumor cell-secreted TGF-β induces fibroblast activation
  and their transformation into CAFs, and CAFs exhibit the expression of TWIST transcription
  factor, which is activated by various pathways including TGF-β, Wnt, and RTK signaling.
  This activation downregulates several epithelial markers to facilitate the formation
  of EMT-TB-TD; EGF derived from tumor cells leads to immature CAFs, which reconstitute
  ECM to form immature DR, and activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to promote
  the formation of EMT-TB-TD. CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts; DR, desmoplastic
  reaction; ECM, extracellular matrix; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinases; TB, tumor budding; TD, tumor deposit;
  TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; ZO-1, zonula occludens-1
