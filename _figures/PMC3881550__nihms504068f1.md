caption: 'During respiration, glucose is oxidized to pyruvate down the glycolytic
  pathway in the cytoplasm. Pyruvate enters the mitochondria and the Krebs cycle.
  Each time the fuel molecule is oxidized, the released electrons are collected by
  electron carriers and then delivered to the electron transport chain (ETC). The
  electrons are transferred from protein to protein down the ETC chain (oxidative
  phosphorylation), which results in production of CO2, water and ATP: C6H12O6 + 6O2
  ⇒ 6CO2 + 6H2O + 30ATP'
