caption: Putative mechanisms of acute AMPK activation, with AICAR or A769662, in inhibiting
  EDH‐like relaxations in rat superior mesenteric arteries. AICAR and A769662, two
  AMPK activators with different chemical structures and binding sites on the enzyme,
  act at different locations in the arteries to inhibit EDH‐like relaxations; AICAR
  inhibits the endothelial KCasignalling pathway, while A769662 in addition inhibits
  signalling downstream of the hyperpolarization of the vascular smooth muscle cells,
  probably through inhibition of calcium mobilization from intracellular stores and/or
  depression of the contractile machinery of the vascular smooth muscle. When eNOS
  is operative, NO, produced by eNOS, curtails the EDH component; in addition, it
  activates AMPK, which in turn, leads to phosphorylation of eNOS at the inhibitory
  Thr495 site and thus reduces the generation of endogenous endothelium‐derived NO
  by eNOS, forming a feedback loop between AMPK and eNOS. AMPK, AMP‐activated protein
  kinase; EDH, endothelium‐dependent hyperpolarization; eNOS, endothelial NOS; IKCa,
  KCa3.1 channel; KIR (Kir), inwardly rectifying potassium channel; M3, muscarinic
  M3 receptor; MLC, myosin light chain; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; P, phosphorylation;
  SKCa, KCa2 channel; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum
