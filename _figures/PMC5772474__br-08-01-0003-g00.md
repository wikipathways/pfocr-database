caption: Glucose metabolism. Glycolysis is the catabolic process in which glucose
  is broken down to pyruvate via these 10 enzymatic steps. Numerous glycolytic enzymes
  are altered in cancer cells (purple ovals). GLUT, glucose transporter; HK, hexokinase;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; PFKFB, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase;
  GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGAM, phosphoglycerate mutase;
  PK, pyruvate kinase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
