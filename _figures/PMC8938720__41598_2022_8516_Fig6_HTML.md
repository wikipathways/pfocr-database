caption: IL-6-dependent induction of LRG1 and proposed downstream angiopathic effector
  mechanisms. IL-6 induces LRG1 in endothelial cells, but not mural cells. LRG1 may
  then act in an autocrine loop on endothelial cells through the TGFβ receptor complex
  to activate canonical and non-canonical signalling that will modify endothelial
  cell function and induce vascular destabilising genes. In turn, the LRG1-mediated
  induction of angiocrine factors may result in indirect angiopathic effects on endothelial
  cells and mural cells. Alternatively, LRG1 may signal in a paracrine fashion directly
  on mural cells to drive destabilisation. Dashed lines with question marks represent
  speculative pathways. Created with Biorender.com.
