caption: 'Schematic representation of the As cycle in the environment and plants.
  Equilibrium between arsenate [As(V)] and arsenite [As(III)] in soil solutions is
  mainly dependent on the redox conditions. Arsenate is taken up by roots by phosphate
  transporters (P), and arsenite is taken up by a subclass of aquaporins (NIP), some
  of them also transporting silicon (Si). Methylated forms of As (MetAs) are also
  taken up by NIP and Si transporters. Inside plants, these types of transporters
  are also involved in the distribution of As between organs and tissues. As(V) is
  enzymatically reduced into As(III) in plant cells by arsenate reductase (AR), leading
  to the conversion of glutathione (GSH) to its oxidized form (GSSG). Arsenite can
  be effluxed to the environment by a root Si transporter or methylated. A cascade
  of methylation can then transform As into a gaseous form that is volatilized. Another
  pathway of detoxification occurs by the synthesis of phytochelatins (PCs) corresponding
  to a three enzymatic step condensation of three amino acids: cysteine (Cys), glutamate
  (Glu), and glycine (Gly). PC synthesis and their complexation to As(III) are coordinated
  to the transport of the PC–As(III) complex to the vacuole subcellular compartment
  through the activity of two members of a subclass of ATP binding cassette (ABC)
  transporters: ABCC1 and -2.'
