caption: Perturbations in metabolic pathways as demonstrated in patient and animal
  studies. Neuroimaging studies in patients have exhibited disturbances in the ATP-PCR
  pathway which indicate a low free energy availability coupled with an increased
  metabolic rate. Glucose hypometabolism has been noted in migraine patients in addition
  to increased lactate, a product of anaerobic glycolysis. In animal studies however
  glycolysis is increased due to the rapid increase in ATP demand following headache
  mechanisms. This rapid incline also results in rapid NADH oxidation, which may lead
  to tissue hypoxia and anaerobic respiration.
