caption: LKB1, the upstream kinase for AMPK, is the tumor suppressor gene mutated
  in Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (PJS), as well a significant fraction of sporadic lung
  cancers and cervical cancers. PJS patients share a number of clinical features with
  patients inheriting defective PTEN or TSC tumor suppressors, perhaps due to their
  control of common biochemical pathways, best understood currently being the mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. Extensive cross-regulation of the
  LKB1/AMPK pathway by the oncogenic Ras and PI3K pathways has been discovered, which
  may explain how these commonly mutated oncogenes also try to circumvent this endogenous
  tumor suppressor pathway. The ULK1/hATG1 kinase complex has emerged recently as
  a central node receiving inputs from both AMPK and mTORC1. A number of kinases that
  can phosphorylate specific residues in LKB1 or AMPK have been identified (upper
  inset), though the contexts in which most of these regulatory events occur is poorly
  defined at present, as is the functional impact of these phosphorylation events
  on AMPK signaling. The BHD tumor suppressor and its partner FNIP1, as well as the
  sestrin family of proteins, have also been implicated as being upstream or downstream
  of AMPK and mTOR depending on the context.
