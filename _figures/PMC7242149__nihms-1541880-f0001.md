caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of corticostriatal synaptic plasticity. Accumulating
  evidence suggests that LTP and LTD can be induced in both dSPNs and iSPNs, and that
  signaling interplays in this opposite synaptic plasticity. Note that lines that
  end with arrowheads indicate signaling activation whereas lines that end with perpendicular
  bars indicate inhibition. In dSPNs, stimulation of D1Rs results in activation of
  the AC5-cAMP-PKA pathway via Gs/olf, which in turn activates RGS4 that is involved
  in LTP. LTP involves NMDAR activity, which can be induced by M1Rs and PKA. LTP can
  be repressed by activation of postsynaptic M4Rs via Gi/o and presynaptic M2Rs. LTD
  was also found to be induced by mGluR5 activation in dSPNs, which is likely involved
  in eCB synthesis and release, and presynaptic activation of CB1Rs. In iSPNs, LTP
  involves the same signaling pathway as in dSPNs, but it is initiated by A2AR stimulation.
  LTD in iSPNs is well known to be involved in eCB signaling that is initiated by
  mGluR5 via Gq. eCB can be synthesized by two pathways: PLD catalyzes AEA to eCB,
  and PLCβ and DGLα catalyze DAG to eCB. PLCβ activation is controlled by VGCC activity
  in addition to mGluR5. Additionally, D2R activity is responsible for LTD by inhibiting
  the AC5-cAMP-PKA pathway via Gi/o. LTD can be prevented by activation of this pathway
  via RSG4.'
