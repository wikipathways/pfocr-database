caption: Kijanimicin (1) contains five deoxysugars, of which four are L-digitoxose
  (2) and one is D-kijanose (3). On the basis of protein sequence alignments to known
  deoxysugar biosynthetic enzymes, the genes involved in the formation of these sugars
  can be identified and the overall biosynthetic pathways can be proposed. Since sequences
  of the sugar biosynthesis enzymes in the kij cluster closely resemble those of known
  TDP-sugar enzymes, all sugar biosynthesis enzymes in the kijanimicin pathway are
  expected to use TDP-activated substrates. The proposed biosynthetic pathways for
  L-digitoxose (2) and D-kijanose (3) are shown respectively in  and . The kijD5 and
  kijD4 genes encode D-glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase (Ep) and TDP-D-glucose
  4,6-dehydratase (Eod), which catalyze the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate (11)
  to TDP-D-glucose (12), and 12 to TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose (13), respectively.
  Subsequent conversion of 13 to TDP-2,6-dideoxy-3,4-diketo-D-glucose (14) is catalyzed
  by KijB1, which is a sugar 2,3-dehydratase. In the TDP-L-digitoxose (19) pathway,
  the C-3 reduction of 14 is expected to be the next step and is catalyzed by the
  3-ketoreductase KijD10. Since KijD10 shares high sequence identity with other TDP-sugar
  3-ketoreductases such as SpnN (47%), Gra26 (52%), and OleW (55%), which generate
  products with an equatorial C-3 hydroxyl group, the product of KijD10 is predicted
  to be TDP-4-keto-2,6-dideoxy-D-glucose (16). The kjD11 gene encodes an epimerase,
  which likely catalyzes the conversion of 16 to TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-L-allose (17).
  The final reduction of 17, catalyzed by the 4-reductase KijC2, completes the biosynthesis
  of TDP-L-digitoxose (19).
