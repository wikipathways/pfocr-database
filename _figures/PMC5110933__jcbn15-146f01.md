caption: 'Mitochondrial reversible reaction between AcCT and CT and between CoA and
  AcCoA in skeletal muscles. Mitochondrial AcCoA is produced from the conversion of
  acetyl-group of AcCT or from acyl-CoA in β-oxidation. Exogenous AcCT is transported
  from extracellular fluids in cell and mitochondria through OCTN2 and CACT, respectively.
  The excess acetyl group of AcCT can be transferred to free CoA by the reverse CrAT
  reaction in mitochondria, with consequent production of AcCoA and free CT. On the
  other hand, in β-oxidation, excess acetyl groups of AcCoA are transferred to CT
  by the forward CrAT reaction, with formation of free CoA and AcCT. Excess accumulation
  of AcCoA in mitochondria would cause stagnation of glycolytic pathway through allosteric
  inhibition of PDH. Abbreviations: AcCoA, acetyl-CoA; AcCT, acetylcarnitine; Acyl-CT,
  acylcarnitine; CACT, carnitine acylcarnitine translocase; CrAT, carnitine acetyltransferase;
  CoA, coenzyme A; CT, carnitine; FFA, free fatty acid; GLUT 4, glucose transporter
  4; IR, insulin receptor; OCTN2, organic anion transporter type-2; PDH, pyruvate
  dehydrogenase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.'
