caption: A simplified representation of the type I IFN signal transduction pathway.
  A. IFN induction. Viral PAMPS are detected by host PRRs, such as RLRs and TLRs,
  which lead to the production of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. B. IFN
  response. IFNα/β binding to IFNAR1/2 activates the Jak/STAT pathway leading to the
  expression of ISGs. Different steps of the pathway targeted by NNSV proteins are
  highlighted in red.
