  (PFK1), a critical regulatory glycolytic enzyme catalyzing the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate
  to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, is modified by O-GlcNAc at Ser529. O-GlcNAcylation
  inhibits PFK1 activity and redirects glucose flux through the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), thereby promoting cancer cell survival and proliferation. Glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP, is O-GlcNAcylated at
  Ser84. O-GlcNAcylation activates G6PD activity and increases glucose flux through
  the PPP, leading to increased precursor accumulation for nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis.
  Pyruvate kinases (PKs) are the final rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis. The O-GlcNAcylation
  of pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) at Thr405 and Ser406 destabilizes its active
  tetrameric structure, resulting in increased glucose consumption and lactate production
  and enhanced level of lipid and DNA synthesis in cancer cells
