caption: MHC class I complex synthesis and assembly. MHC class I heavy chains are
  cotranslationally inserted into the ER. Proper folding, association with the β2m
  light chain, and peptide loading are assisted by chaperones such as calnexin, calreticulin,
  tapasin, and ERp57. E1, E2, and E3 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes tag proteins in
  the cytosol for destruction by the proteasome. Peptides are pumped into the ER by
  the TAP transporters. Properly folded, peptide-loaded MHC class I complexes progress
  through the secretory pathway for display on the cell surface. TAP, transporter
  associated with antigen processing.
