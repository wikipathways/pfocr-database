caption: 'DJ-1’s mechanisms involved in the modulation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
  A) Schematic representation of the biomolecules, their connections, and the outcomes.
  (1) DJ-1 is able to bind to c-raf, promoting its self-phosphorylation at Ser338
  and activating subsequent pathway components MEK1/2 []. In oxidative conditions,
  phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 is also increased by a dual-mechanism that
  includes: (2) the direct action of DJ-1 on these proteins; and (3) the DJ-1 suppression
  of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) expression, a known inhibitor of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2
  family kinases []. (4) Upon oxidative stress, DJ-1 can promote pro-survival ERK-dependent
  mitophagy []. (5) DJ-1 interacts directly with ERK1/2, enhancing its nuclear translocation.
  As a result, phosphorylation of downstream transcription factor Elk1 occurs, and
  the expression of its target protein, superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), is increased
  []. (6) DJ-1 enhances nuclear receptor-related 1 (Nurr1) transcription factor activity
  through activation of the ERK1/2 pathway, triggering the expression of tyrosine
  hydroxylase (TH), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and dopamine decarboxylase
  (DDC), which are involved in the synthesis and transport of dopamine [,]. (7) DJ-1-mediated
  activation of ERK1/2 signaling promotes miRNA-22 neuroprotective function by enhancing
  its expression, in turn downregulating the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins,
  such as bcl-2-like protein 11 (Bim), bcl2 modifying factor (BMF), forkhead box O3
  (Foxo3a) and bcl2 interacting protein 3-like (BNPL3L) []. (8) Finally, ERK1/2 pathway
  can also be responsible for upregulating DJ-1 upon stress stimuli, generating a
  loop regulatory mechanism [] (Adapted from reference []). B) The influence of DJ-1
  mutations and the importance of DJ-1 cysteine residues in the protein’s signaling
  regulation mechanisms.'
