caption: Cellular pathways connecting inflammation and oxidative stress (OS) in the
  pathogenesis of male infertility. (A) Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in testicular
  and epididymal cells are activated by inflammatory stimuli. The activated PRRs trigger
  downstream signalling via the Myeloid differentiation primary response (MYD88) and
  mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases pathways (IRF3); (B) These cascades activate
  transcription factors such as the nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated
  B cells (NF-kB), activator protein 1 (AP-1), and interferon regulatory factor 3
  (IRF3); (C) Excess ROS production, on the other hand, can cause oxidation of membrane
  phospholipids and intracellular proteins, which can activate the PRRs-inflammatory
  pathway. Furthermore, ROS can activate the transcription factors nuclear respiratory
  factor (NRF) 1 and 2 via AKT (Protein Kinase B) and estrogen receptor (ESR) 1. These
  activated transcription factors induce the expression of inflammatory mediators
  such as tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), interferons (IFNs), interleukin (IL) 1,
  nitric oxide (NO), and tumour growth factor (TGF) B3, which cause exaggerated inflammation
  and can also act as OS stimuli, creating a feedback loop. OS can also initiate apoptotic
  cascades by assisting the release of cytochrome-c (Cyt-c) from mitochondria.
