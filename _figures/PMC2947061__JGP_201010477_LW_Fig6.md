caption: Proposed mGluR6-signaling cascade in rod bipolar cells. mGluR6 receptors
  activated upon binding glutamate released from rods exchange GTP for GDP on both
  Gαo1 and Gαo2, which leads to the closure of nonselective cation channels (TRPM1)
  through an unknown downstream cascade. The efficiency of the Gαo2pathway is lower
  than that of the Gαo1pathway, as represented by the thin arrow leading to the putative
  effector (E?). While a single effector is shown, this work does not exclude the
  possibility that Gαo1 and Gαo2 act on separate effectors that lead to the coordinated
  closure of TRPM1 gating. Arrows show that nonlinearity in the signaling cascade
  might reside at several locations.
