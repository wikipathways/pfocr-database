caption: Schematic overview of the role of NNMT in glioma cells. Overexpression of
  NNMT leads to excessive consumption of SAM and NAM in glioma cells. Methyl donor
  SAM drain leads to comprehensive DNA/histone demethylation, which affects the expression
  of a variety of tumor-associated genes such as GAP-43, Sirt1, etc. GAP43 can inhibit
  the formation of microtubules in glioma cell and intertumor cell network connections.
  In addition, NAM drain decreases NAD+, a coenzyme of various glucose metabolism
  enzymes, which is also deeply involved in histone deacetylation. NNMT modulates
  the NAD-related signaling pathway and downregulates SIRT1, which induces glioma
  cell apoptosis.
