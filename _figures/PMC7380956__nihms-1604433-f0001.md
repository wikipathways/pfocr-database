caption: Glucose is converted to glucose-6-phosphate once it enters the cell via glucose
  transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT4). Glucose can be oxidized via glycolysis to pyruvate
  which enters TCA cycle in mitochondria to complete glucose oxidation. Alternatively,
  glucose can enter into polyol pathway and converted to sorbitol via rate-limiting
  aldose reductase (ALDR) enzyme. Glucose-6-P can be channeled into Pentose Phosphate
  pathway by rate-limiting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), generating pentose
  sugars for nucleotide synthesis and NADPH. Pentose sugar, ribose generated from
  the pentose phosphate pathway is converted to ribitol and subsequently to CDP-ribitol
  by ribitol-5-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (ISPD), and is conjugated with α-dystroglycan
  (DAG1) as a glycosylation motif by fukutin-related protein (FKRP) enzyme. Fructose-6-phophate,
  a glycolytic intermediate can be channeled into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
  by rate-limiting glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) and converted
  to UDP-GlcNAc used for glycosylation of proteins. Additionally, glycolytic intermediate
  3-phosphoglycerate enters one-carbon metabolism pathway by the rate-limiting, phosphoglycerate
  dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and among other steps, interconversion of glycine and serine
  by serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT), thereby generating one-carbon units
  for nucleotide and NADPH synthesis.
