caption: (A) Cell autonomous signaling in XXX. A schematic of one XXX cell is shown.
  EAK proteins function in parallel with AKT-1 and in the same pathway as AKT-2 to
  promote nondauer development by potentiating DAF-9/CYP27A1 function either directly
  or indirectly. DAF-9/CYP27A1 synthesizes 3-keto-7(5α)-cholestenoic acid, a ligand
  that promotes reproductive development by inhibiting the nuclear hormone receptor
  DAF-12 []. DAF-16/FoxO is denoted with dashed lines, since DAF-16A does not appear
  to be expressed in XXX. It is not known whether other DAF-16/FoxO isoforms or DAF-2/InsR
  are expressed in XXX.(B) Nonautonomous signaling from XXX. A schematic of the anterior
  portion of an animal is shown with the head pointing left. The pharynx is also shown.
  XXX cells are denoted by red ovals, and DAF-16/FoxO-expressing cells are denoted
  by green ovals. EAK proteins in the XXX cells generate signals that regulate the
  synthesis or secretion of a hormone that inhibits DAF-16/FoxO function in other
  cells.
