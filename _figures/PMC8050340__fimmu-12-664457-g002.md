caption: Pathways of metabolic reprogramming in immune cells. Activation of mTOR during
  hypoxia and stimulation of PRR by DAMPs or antigen receptors on T- and B-lymphocytes
  by antigens leads to the sustained stimulation of HIF-1α, which in turn activates
  glycolysis and pentose-phosphate pathway, breaking down tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle. All of the above mentioned metabolic pathways are associated with high rate
  of ATP production, generation of biosynthetic precursors (nucleotides, fatty acids,
  ribose, amino acids), diversion of immune suppressive factors such as phosphoenolpyruvate
  into glycolytic pathway and production of cofactors (such as NADH). As a consequence
  cells of the immune system are activated and acquire inflammatory phenotype. Restoration
  of the normal oxygen supply or anti-inflammatory signaling, sometimes combined with
  checkpoint (PD-1) activation, stimulates AMPK, characterized by the suppressive
  activity towards mTOR. AMPK supports integrity of TCA, stimulates OXPHOS and fatty
  acid oxidation, minimizing ATP consumption and inhibiting cell cycle and biosynthesis.
  Switching from catabolism to anabolism represents a stimulus for the development
  of anti-inflammatory and memory cells. AMPK, AMP activated protein kinase; ATP,
