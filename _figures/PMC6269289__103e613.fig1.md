caption: A simplified diagram of sialic acid metabolism in human. Biosynthesis of
  sialic acid (SA) mostly takes place in the cytoplasm, although the CMP–sialic acid
  synthase (CMAS) reaction occurs in the nucleus. The synthesis of ManNAc (N-acetylmannosamine)
  is carried out in two steps by UDP-GLcNAc–2 epimerase (GNE). NeuNAc synthase (NANS)
  generates phosphorylated forms of sialic acid, which must be dephosphorylated by
  a specific phosphatase (Neu5Ac-9-P-phosphatase, NANP) to yield free sialic acid
  in the cytoplasm. The free sialic acid can then reenter the biosynthesis pathway
  (indicated as “salvage” in the diagram). The CMP-SA (produced in the nucleus) is
  transferred by SLC35A1 into the Golgi apparatus, where it is used as a substrate
  for sialylation by sialyltransferases.

  is required for platelet life span but not proplatelet formation.
