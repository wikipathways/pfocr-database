caption: Upon NO3− treatment, the NRT1.1 and NLP7 regulatory module induces rapid
  HRS1 transcript and protein accumulation. The prolonged P deficiency condition negatively
  affects the accumulation of HRS1 and modifies its regulatory activity. Furthermore,
  the P limitation signal seems to control the NO3− sensor (NRT1.1) protein half-life.
  This delineates a working model to understand several points of NO3− and PO43− signal
  interactions via the HRS1 pathway.
