caption: (Left panel) Wild type signaling. NGF (green cartoon) promotes TrkA (blue
  cartoon) signaling mediated by phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues
  (dark blue boxes). Phosphorylated Y496 forms an adaptor binding site that couple
  mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling
  pathways, activating transcription of genes related to neuronal differentiation
  and survival, respectively. Phosphorylation of Y791 activates phospholipase Cγ1
  (PLCγ1) pathway, that mediates neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity
  via PKC and Ca+2 cytosolic release, respectively. Autophosphorylation of residues
  Y676, Y680 and Y681 mediates TrKA kinase activity and modulates Y496 and Y791 signaling.
  (Right panel) R221W mutant signaling. R221W mutation (orange spheres in NGF cartoon)
  incapacitates the induction of Y791 signaling pathway, impairing neuronal differentiation
  and synaptic plasticity, that results in the insensitivity to pain, heat and cold
  in HSAN5.
