caption: Receptor occupancy by GLP-1 leads to activation of Gsα proteins and stimulation
  of adenylyl cyclase. This step results in cAMP production and requires extracellular
  Na+. The cAMP activates Ca-NS channels that are also activated by cytosolic Ca2+
  and which fail to respond to cAMP when [Ca2+]i is very low. The opening of these
  channels generates IcAMP, an inward Na+ current. IcAMP results in membrane depolarization
  (ΔVm) and raises [Ca2+]i by activation of VDCCs. IcAMP may also promote a rise of
  [Na+]i which slows or reverses Na+/Ca2+ exchange. The rise of [Ca2+]i which is secondary
  to the slowing of Na+/Ca2+ exchange may then, in turn, promote Ca2+-induced Ca2+
  release (CICR) from intracellular Ca2+ stores. Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release may also
  result from the initial rise of [Ca2+]i due to the opening of VDCCs. Release of
  Ca2+ from intracellular stores may also be favored by a more direct effect of cAMP
  on them.
