caption: PRDM proteins participation in signal transduction pathways, proliferation,
  and gene expression regulation. PRDM proteins play a pivotal role in the transduction
  of signals that control cell proliferation and differentiation. (A) PRDM1 and PRDM5
  antagonize the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. PRDM1 reduces the expression of DKK1 while
  PRDM5 forms a chromatin complex with CBP, TCF, and β-catenin that prevents Wnt target
  gene expression. (B) PRDM2/RIZ1 counteracts the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)
  receptor and the downstream signaling component ERK1/2 and AKT. PRDM8 suppresses
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade through the regulation of nucleosome assembly
  protein 1-like 1 (NAP1L1). (C) The PRDM2 gene product, PRDM2a/RIZ1, is a downstream
  effector of estrogen action and is related to estrogen-regulated cancer cell proliferation.
  ERα modulates the PRDM2/RIZ isoforms intracellular concentration ratio, by an indirect
  and selective decrease of RIZ1 expression and a transcriptional activation of RIZ2.
  (D) TGF-β signaling plays important roles in cytostasis and normal epithelium differentiation,
  and alterations in TGF-β signaling have been identified in many malignancies. MEL1/PRDM16
  interacts with SKI and inhibits TGF-β signaling by stabilizing the inactive Smad3-SKI
  complex on the promoter of TGF-β target genes. PRDM3 negatively regulates TGF-β
  signaling through binding and inactivating SMAD3 proteins. (E) PRDM14 binds an intron
  of NOTCH1 gene and modifies the chromatin structure (H3K4me3) allowing access of
  the RAG recombinase complex. RAG deletes part of the NOTCH1 promoter and consequently
  a truncated, ligand-independent Notch1 protein is produced. (F) PRDM3 through its
  first zinc finger domain, associates and inhibits JNK activity, thus protecting
  cells from stress-induced cell death that is dependent on JNK activation. Otherwise,
  PRDM5 upregulates JNK expression. (G) PRDM11 represses the oncogenes Fos and Jun
  that are frequently induced by aberrant growth factor signaling or oncogenic activation
  of MAP kinase signaling, such as constitutively active RAS. PRDM3 downregulates
  SERPIN-B2 gene that might play an important role in enhancing cell proliferation
  by preventing protection of Rb proteolysis and/or in the suppression of cell differentiation.
  PRDM13 inhibits cell proliferation by upregulating INCA1, a CDK inhibitor and ADAMTS12,
  a novel antitumor protease that modulates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  signaling pathway. (H) Hypoxia-induced miR-214 inhibits PRDM16 expression, thus
  promoting both cell proliferation and migration and enhancing the Warburg effect.
