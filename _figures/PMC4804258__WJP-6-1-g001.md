caption: 'Brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway. The binding of proBDNF
  to the p75NTR up-regulates c-Jun N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor κB, triggering
  apoptosis, axonal retraction, or the pruning of dendritic spines. The proBDNF is
  cleaved to generate mature BDNF via tPA/plasminogen. When BDNF binding to its receptors,
  the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB becomes phosphorylated, leading to phosphorylation
  at various sites or activation of downstream pathways. Such activation shows at
  PI3K sites, which activates AKT, regulating cell survival. The activation of MAPK/ERK
  leads to cell growth and differentiation. The activation of PLC-γ pathway regulates
  IP3 receptor to release intracellular calcium stores, in turn to enhance CamK activity,
  regulating synaptic plasticity. All three pathways converge on transcription factor
  CREB, binging to certain DNA sequences called CRE, playing a key role in BDNF-induced
  gene expression. BDNF: Brain derived neurotrophic factor; PTSD: Post-traumatic stress
  disorder; tPA: Tissue-type plasminogen activator; CamK: Calmodulin kinase; CAMP:
  Cyclic adenosine monophosphate; CREB: CAMP response elements; CRE: CAMP response
  elements; AKT: Protein kinase B; IP3: Inositol trisphosphate.'
