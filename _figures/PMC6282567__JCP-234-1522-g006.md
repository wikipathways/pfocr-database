caption: 'MiR‐24‐3p regulates cell proliferation and milk protein synthesis in mammary
  epithelial cells through cooperatively acting with MEN1/menin. MiR‐24‐3p positively
  regulates the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells, promoting the G1/S cell
  phase progression. While, MEN1/menin was found, in our previous study (Li et al.,
  ), negatively control the proliferation of at G1/S phase progression, causing cell
  growth arrest. This is contributed to the negative feedback controlling model between
  miR‐24‐3p and MEN1/menin. The dynamic balance model between miR‐24‐3p and MEN1/menin
  also make an opposite impacts on milk protein synthesis of mammary epithelial cells
  through PI3K/AKT/mTOR and/or JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The solid line represents
  fluxes found in the current study; the dotted line represents previously found effects
  or fluxes (Li et al., ). The arrows indicate the positive regulation, and the blunt‐ended
  ones indicate the negative regulation. AKT: protein kinase B; JAK: Janus kinase;
  MEN1: multiple endocrine tumor type 1; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K:
  phosphatidylinositol‐3‐kinase; STAT: signal transducer and activators of transcription
