caption: Schema of the proposed mechanisms by which acetylcholine dilates the retinal
  arteriole in diabetic rats (A) and in diabetic rats treated with L-citrulline (B).
  Acetylcholine dilates rat retinal arterioles through NO-dependent and NO-independent
  mechanisms. NO stimulates the arachidonic acid cascade/prostaglandin I2/cAMP signaling
  pathway and activates 4-aminopyridine-sensitive KV channels. Epoxyeicosatrienoic
  acids activates BKCa channels (; , , , ). These pathways contribute to the relaxation
  of vascular smooth muscle cells. The function of BKCa channels but not eNOS is impaired
  in the retinal arteriole of diabetic rat, so that acetylcholine and BMS-191011-induced
  retinal vasodilation responses in diabetic rats attenuated as compared with those
  in non-diabetic rats (, ). The activity and the expression of arginase, which metabolizes
  L-Arginine to L-ornithine, may be increased in diabetic rats, and the augmentation
  of arginase may be involve in dysfunction of retinal vasodilation in diabetes ()
  (A). Long-term administration of L-citrulline suppresses the dysfunction of retinal
  vasodilation via activation of BKCa channels. L-Citrulline inhibits arginase activity
  (). And L-citrulline protects the high glucose-induced endothelial damages in human
  umbilical vein endothelial cells (). Therefore, decrease in arginase activity or
  protection of endothelial cells by L-citrulline may inhibit attenuation of retinal
  vasodilation response through BKCa channels activation in diabetic rats. And L-citrulline
  may protect BKCa channels directly, however the mechanisms are still unknown (B).
