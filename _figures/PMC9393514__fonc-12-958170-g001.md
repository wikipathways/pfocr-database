caption: Biological mechanisms linking diabetes and intraocular malignancy. Tumor
  cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet their energy needs for rapid proliferation.
  Warburg effect and anaerobic glycolysis are involved in the formation and development
  of intraocular malignancies in the early stage and advanced stage, respectively.
  Insulin resistance improves carcinogenesis by developing an adiponectin-deficient
  environment, direct insulin/insulin receptor pathway, and indirect IGF-1/IGF-1R
  signaling pathway. Both IGF-1/IGF-1R axis and insulin/insulin receptor are involved
  in the occurrence and development of intraocular malignancy through PI3K/AKT and
  Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways. →, activation; ⊥, inhibition.
