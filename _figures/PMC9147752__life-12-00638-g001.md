caption: 'Schematic representation of the retinal network and its different pathways
  for the processing of visual information. Visual information is processed by the
  ‘columnar unit’, which includes photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and retinal ganglion
  cells. Müller glia ensheath the entire ‘columnar unit’ of neurons providing fundamental
  metabolic and functional support. Horizontal cells and amacrine cells modulate the
  synaptic signalling between photoreceptors and bipolar cells and between bipolar
  cells and retinal ganglion cells, respectively. The retinal neuronal layers can
  be distinguished based on the location of the main cell bodies (photoreceptor layer,
  PL; inner nuclear layer, INL; ganglion cell layer, GCL) and of the synaptic connections
  between neurons (outer plexiform layer, OPL; inner plexiform layer, IPL). Retinal
  ganglion cell axons initially form bundles of unmyelinated fibres at the retinal
  nerve fibre layer (RNFL), which will then exit the eye and form the myelinated optic
  nerve. Rod and cone photoreceptors mediate two distinct pathways of light responses:
  scotopic and photopic vision. In particular, the cone pathway can be additionally
  distinguished according to ON and OFF, which are interconnected and differentially
  modulated by glutamate neurotransmission. While the mGluR6 (a metabotropic glutamate
  receptor) mediates the sign-inverting synapse resulting in rod and ON cone bipolar
  cell hyperpolarisation in response to glutamate release, the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole
  propionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptor mediates the sign-conserving synapse in OFF
  cone bipolar cells, which depolarise in response to glutamate release under dark
  conditions.'
