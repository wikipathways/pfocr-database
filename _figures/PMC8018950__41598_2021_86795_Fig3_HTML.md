caption: Top regulatory effect predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis within Fayoumis
  at 6 dpi comparison. Blue (inhibited) and orange (activated) lines represent relationships
  with upstream regulators at the top of the figure with differentially expressed
  genes at center, and diseases/functions. Genes in green indicated down-regulation,
  while red signifies up-regulation.
