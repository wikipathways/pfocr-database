caption: Metformin and CR act in a similar manner to curtail ovarian cancer growth,
  while HED aggravates ovarian cancer. Both metformin and CR result in activation
  of AMPK and SIRT1. SIRT1 activation could occur independently or as a consequence
  of AMPK activation. Activation of these metabolic enzymes is linked to reduction
  in growth factors and hormones like insulin, IGF-1 and leptin, which leads to inhibition
  in the protein kinase B-mammalian target of rapamycin (Akt-mTOR) pathway activation
  resulting in decreased ovarian tumor growth. Inhibition of cytokines like MCP-1
  and IL-6 and the angiogenic factor VEGF reduces inflammation and angiogenesis, which
  also leads to limited ovarian tumor growth. Overall, metformin and CR have very
  similar effects in modulating the deranged tumor environment milieu and in effect
  restricts ovarian cancer progression. AMPK, adenosine monophosphate activated kinase;
  CR, caloric restriction; HED, high energy diet; IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1;
  IL-6, interleukin 6; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; SIRT1, sirtuin 1;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.
