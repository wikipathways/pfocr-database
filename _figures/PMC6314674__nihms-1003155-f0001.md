caption: Glycolysis involves the conversion of glucose molecules into various metabolic
  byproducts, culminating in the end product pyruvate as well as 2 net ATP. In macrophages
  treated with interleukin (IL)-4, (M[IL-4], left side of the cell) pyruvate (and
  fatty acids) enters the intact tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as acetyl coenzyme
  A (Acetyl-CoA), resulting in sustained ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) and leading to the upregulation of genes associated with tissue repair.
  Conversely, in macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma
  (IFN-γ) (M[LPS+IFN-γ] right side of the cell) the majority of pyruvate is converted
  into lactate and secreted. Furthermore, the enzyme carbohydrate kinase-like protein
  (CARKL) is downregulated, and as a result, glycolysis also feeds the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) generating nucleotides, amino acids and NADPH. The TCA cycle is broken
  in two places in M[LPS+IFN-γ] macrophages resulting in the accumulation of citrate
  that is used to drive fatty acid synthesis (FAS) and succinate that stabilizes the
  transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha (HIF-1α). HIF-1α enters the
  nucleus and promotes the expression of hypoxia response element (HRE) containing
  genes, which include both glycolytic and pro-inflammatory genes such as interleukin-1beta
  (IL-1β). The disturbed TCA cycle and reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
  also result in increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further
  stabilize HIF-1α to drive glycolysis and inflammatory gene expression. Glut-1, glucose
  transporter-1; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; OAA, oxaloacetate;
  NADPH, Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.
