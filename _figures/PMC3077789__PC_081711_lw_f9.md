caption: The Indole Glucosinolate Modification Pathway in Arabidopsis.Enzyme functions
  inferred from a combination of Arabidopsis T-DNA insertions and biochemical assays
  are shown above arrows, and further gene products that may catalyze the same reaction
  are shown below arrows. I3M is the product of the indole glucosinolate core pathway
  and acts as the substrate for hydroxylation reactions performed by members of the
  CYP81F subfamily of cytochrome P450s. Hydroxy intermediates are further converted
  to 1MO-I3M and 4MO-I3M, respectively, by IGMTs, which belong to family 2 plant O-MTs.
