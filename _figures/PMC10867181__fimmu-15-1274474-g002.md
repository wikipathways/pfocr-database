caption: Effect of extracellular matrix (ECM) in promoting metastasis. ECM influences
  several hallmarks of cancer at different stages, including initiation and metastasis.
  With the increase in TGFβ, ECM molecules undergo remodeling, which leads to the
  stiffness of the ECM. Stiffens ECM binds to receptors, e.g., syndecans, DDRs, and
  integrins, located on the surface of tumor cells to induce intracellular pathways.
  Crosstalk between ECM ligands and integrins potentiates the Talin, which subsequently
  activates the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to induce the adhesion complexes’ assembly,
  e.g., PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which plays vital roles in the tumor cell proliferation,
  differentiation, migration, invasion, survival, and metastasis. Meanwhile, the crosstalk
  of integrin and growth factor receptors also activates the Rho GTPase. Rho GTPase
  consequently induces the ROCK, elevating the phosphorylation of MLCK and promoting
  actomyosin contraction. Furthermore, ECM ligand interaction with DDRs and syndecans
  induces cell migration and contraction by shortlisting numerous molecules, including
  myosin IIA. Additionally, ECM stiffness promotes the adhesion signaling integrin
  clustering and translocates Twist1 and YAP into the nucleus to induce EMT. Similarly,
  TGFβ encourages the level of Tenascin C in the CAFs, which is involved in cell invasion.
  These CAFs excrete HGFs to establish the niches in tumor cells. CAF, cancer-associated
  fibroblasts; TGFβ, transforming growth factor-β; ECM, extracellular matrix; HGF,
  hepatocyte growth factor; DDR, discoidin domain receptor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase;
