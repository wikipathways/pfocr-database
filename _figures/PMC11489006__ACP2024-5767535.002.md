caption: Upstream regulators of Hippo signaling pathway in CRC. The Hippo can be activated
  by diverse stimuli including cell polarity, mechanotransduction, cell density, soluble
  factors, and oxidative stress. Upstream regulators of Hippo signaling pathway in
  CRC. The Hippo can be activated by diverse stimuli including cell polarity, mechanotransduction,
  cell density, soluble factors, and oxidative stress. Cell polarity proteins like
  AMOT and scribble complexes regulate Hippo pathway components such as LATS1/2 and
  YAP/TAZ. Mechanical cues from the tumor microenvironment are transduced to the Hippo
  pathway via actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and activation of transcription factors.
  High cell density activates the tumor suppressor NF2 to inhibit YAP. Soluble factors
  like EGF, TGF-β, and IGF-1 modulate Hippo pathway kinases and transcriptional coactivators.
  Oxidative stress can both activate and inhibit the Hippo pathway through redox signaling.
  Dysregulation of these upstream signals leads to aberrant Hippo pathway activity
  and CRC progression
