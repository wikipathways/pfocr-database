caption: Distinct functions of BAG3 and BAG6. Upon stress, newly synthesized proteins
  and DRiPs are released by disassembling polysomes. mRNAs and RBPs are compartmentalized
  inside stress granules. The VCP, HSPB8, and HSP70 chaperones bind to newly synthesized
  polyubiquitinated (Ub) proteins, including DRiPs. HSPB8 and HSP70 form a multiprotein
  complex with BAG3, p62/SQSTM1, and the motor protein dynein that targets DRiPs and
  polyubiquitinated proteins to LC3-positive autophagosomes for degradation. As such,
  DRiPs do not accumulate inside stress granules, which maintain their liquid-like
  properties (Ganassi et al. ). BAG6 also binds to HSP70 and polyubiquitinated proteins.
  However, in contrast to BAG3 (Fig. ), BAG6 can directly bind to polyubiquitinated
  proteins and 26S proteasomes (as previously shown by Minami et al. ). BAG6 bound
  to HSP70 and 26S proteasomes is not involved in granulostasis (red cross). Instead,
  BAG6 targets proteins of the secretory pathway that have failed to insert into the
  ER to degradation via ERAD and ERpQC, in cooperation with VCP (see Kadowaki et al.
  ; Wang et al. ). BAG6 has also been implicated in the processing of antigens that
  are generated via the degradation of newly synthesized proteins and in the presentation
  of antigens at the cell surface, thereby participating in the immune response (see
  Bitzer et al. ).
