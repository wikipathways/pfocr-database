caption: Progranulin has been described as a secreted protein that undergoes endocytosis
  and intracellular trafficking to reach the lysosomes in microglia, neurons and tumour
  cells. a | In wild-type cells, progranulin is present in the Golgi apparatus and
  is secreted probably via the secretory pathway. Another structurally related protein,
  prosaposin, heterodimerizes with progranulin, and regulates the transport and secretion
  of progranulin. Once released in the extracellular space, progranulin undergoes
  sortilin-mediated endocytosis to reach the lysosome via a mechanism that is poorly
  understood. Another alternative and highly plausible mechanism for progranulin to
  reach the lysosome is through the recycling endosome, multivesicular body (MVB),
  late endosome and eventually to early lysosome. The transcription of GRN (which
  encodes progranulin) and of many lysosomal genes is under the control of the transcription
  factor TFEB. b | In the absence of progranulin, mouse Grn−/−microglia show an expansion
  in the size of the late endosome and early lysosome but no defect in the expression
  of sortilin. Consistent with these findings, transcriptomic profiling in different
  regions of Grn−/−mouse brain, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum,
  shows age-dependent increases in the expression of genes related to lysosomal functions
  and to the innate immune system, including a marked increase the production of complement
  proteins, C1qa and C3 products, by microglia. For reasons that are not entirely
  clear, loss of progranulin increases the transcriptional activity of TFEB, which
  promotes a marked upregulation of lysosomal genes. As a consequence, Grn−/−microglia
  and neurons exhibit features of lysosomal storage disease. Interestingly, over-expression
  of granulins can also lead to similar lysosomal defects. These results support the
  idea that a delicate balance of progranulin and granulin is crucial for the proper
  formation and function of lysosomes. ER, endoplasmic reticulum.
