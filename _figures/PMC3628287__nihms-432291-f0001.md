caption: A. A schematic of the hippocampus in horizontal section is shown. The area
  outlined by the red box is shown at higher magnification in B.B. The mossy fiber
  (MF) projection from DG granule cells to area CA3 pyramidal cells is shown. MFs
  provide a major glutamatergic input to area CA3, with “giant boutons” that innervate
  complex spines on the proximal apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells called “thorny
  excrescences” (; ). Filamentous extensions of the giant boutons innervate GABAergic
  interneurons (; ).C. Estrogen receptors (ERs, blue rectangles) are localized to
  nuclear compartments in DG granule cells, CA3 pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons
  (; ). ERs are also located in MF axons and axon terminals and on the plasma membrane
  of pyramidal cell dendrites, GABAergic interneurons, and glia (; ; ). proBDNF (red
  and black rectangle) is synthesized in the granule cells (1) and can be cleaved
  to form mature BDNF (black rectangle; 2); BDNF (3) can be anterogradely transported
  to the terminal, where it is packaged in dense core vesicles (large presynaptic
  circle in D) like other neuropeptides (; ; ; ). proBDNF can also be packaged in
  dense core vesicles. Due to the overlap in sites containing ERs, BDNF, trkB and
  p75NTR, ERs can influence BDNF and trkB expression and actions via transcriptional
  and non-transcriptional mechanisms and vice-versa. The area outlined by the red
  box is shown at higher magnification in D.D. Signaling at the MF synaps e includes
  potential sites of action for estrogen at pre or postsynaptic ERs. proBDNF and mature
  BDNF also have pre and postsynaptic receptors; in addition, truncated trkB on astrocytes
  could regulate the concentrations of mature BDNF at the synapse (). Adapted from
