caption: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-associated lipids promote atherosclerotic lesions①
  Main constituent of LDL, phosphatidylcholine (PC), is oxidized and converted to
  lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which regulates the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 through
  activation of GPR4, inducing apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells, and promoting
  atherosclerosis; ② LPC is hydrolyzed to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by autotaxin
  (ATX). LPA activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ½ (ERK1/2) pathway
  by stimulating lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPA1), promoting the proliferation
  and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, and contributing to atherosclerosis
