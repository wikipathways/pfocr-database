caption: Schematic representation of the potential interaction between KIM-1 and the
  Rho signaling pathway in RCC cells. KIM-1 expression on RCC cells constrictively
  binds and inhibits Gα12 activation by blocking GTP-exchange. Inactivation of Gα12
  results in downstream inhibition of the small GTPase Rho which has been implicated
  in promoting the progression and migration of a variety of cancer cells,. Schematic
  representation of proposed effects how KIM-1 expression inhibits transcription of
  pro-metastatic Rab27b, possibly inhibiting protein effects such as invasion and
  metastasis of RCC cells.
