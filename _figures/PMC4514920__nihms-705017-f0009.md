caption: Radiation is known to induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines such
  as TNFα by hematopoietic cells into the blood which could upregulate ATX production
  through NF-κB in the endothelial lining of blood vessels and other yet to be identified
  target cells. This results in increased ATX enzyme activity and subsequent LPA content
  of plasma. In intestinal stem cell like cells, modeled by the IEC-6 cell line, the
  LPA2 receptor is upregulated in response to radiation induced DNA damage via an
  ATM- NF-κB dependent pathway. At the same time, ATX production is upregulated by
  the radiation-induced release of TNFα into the circulation. The elevated LPA content
  and receptor upregulation drives the enhanced DNA damage repair.
