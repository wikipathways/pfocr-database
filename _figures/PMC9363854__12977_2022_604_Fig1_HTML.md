caption: 'Cell and embryo based genome editing approaches. To introduce a mutation
  associated with human disease (orange nucleotide pair) into monkey iPSCs and embryos,
  a Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) with or without a single-strand oligodeoxynucleotide
  (ssODN) template containing the desired mutation may be delivered via cell electroporation
  or microinjection into one-cell embryos. The double-stranded DNA break incurred
  upon Cas9 cleavage may be repaired preferentially by non-homologous end joining
  (NHEJ) or alternatively, by homology directed repair (HDR). Repair by canonical
  NHEJ or an alternative NHEJ pathway via microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ)
  are the cellular default repair mechanisms which often introduce insertions or deletions
  resulting in gene disruption due to frameshift, nonsense or missense mutations.
  When provided an ssODN template, repair may occur by HDR to create more precise
  edits by utilizing the provided template to introduce the desired mutation. Of note,
  despite co-delivery of an ssODN template, repair by NHEJ will predominate. Upon
  introducing edits, iPSCs can be differentiated into immune cells and subjected to
  experimental infection to assess phenotypic and functional responses to validate
  gene editing strategy and targeted embryos may be transferred to a surrogate to
  produce edited offspring containing the desired mutation. Abbreviations: iPSC induced
  pluripotent stem cells, WT wild-type.'
