caption: 'Bioenergetic and biosynthetic pathways of glycolysis. (a) Glycolysis breaks
  down glucose into two molecules of pyruvate accompanied by a net production of two
  molecules of ATP and 2 NADH + 2 H+. Metabolic intermediates derived from glycolysis
  serve as precursors in the biosynthesis of non-essential amino acids including serine,
  glycine, cysteine, and alanine. (b) The pentose phosphate pathway consists of two
  phases: oxidative and non-oxidative phases. Oxidation of G-6-P to pentose phosphates
  leads to the production of NADPH and five-carbon sugars, which are critical for
  reductive biosynthesis, antioxidant defense, and RNA/DNA synthesis. PPP is interconnected
  by transketolase and transaldolase with glycolysis. (c) Fructose-6-phosphate produced
  from G-6-P serves as the starting point that diverts 2–3% glucose to the hexosamine
  biosynthesis pathway, a branch derived from glycolysis, which generates the “sensing
  molecule” UDP-N-Acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), the substrate of the enzymes involved
  in protein N- and O-glycosylation. The rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway is glutamine:
  fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT).'
