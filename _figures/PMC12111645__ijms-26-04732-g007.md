caption: Mechanism of THC-induced neurotoxicity Via MCU. The psychoactive compound
  THC in cannabis binds to the cannabinoid receptor CB1, activating the PI3K-AKT pathway,
  which phosphorylates MICU1 on MCU, leading to MCU channel opening and Ca2+ influx
  into the IMM. This results in mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, oxidative stress, mPTP
  opening, Cyt c release, and apoptosis, contributing to THC-induced neurotoxicity.
