caption: Prediction map of the protein–protein interactions among the identified cell
  wall proteins in the fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strain. The map was constructed
  using STRING database (version 11.0) with a minimum confidence score of 0.4 where
  line thickness reflects the strength of data support. Joint proteins function in
  interconnected pathways. Colored nodes refer to proteins with biological process
  related to drug metabolic process (green), cellular response to drug (yellow), response
  to fungicide (red), and/or ergosterol biosynthetic pathway (blue). Filled nodes
  refer to proteins with known or predicted structures whereas empty nodes refer to
  proteins with unknown structures.
