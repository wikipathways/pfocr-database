caption: 'MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent TLR signaling pathways. Ligand binding
  of TLRs by their respective ligands induces dimerization of TLRs and initiates MyD88-dependent
  or TRIF-dependent signaling cascades. The presence of coreceptors, such as CD14
  for TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9, CD36 for TLR2 and TLR6, and CD44 for TLR4,
  promotes ligand binding efficiency to TLRs. MD2 is a receptor component associated
  with TLR4 and enables TLR4 to respond to LPS. Activation of TLR1-TLR2 by the lipopeptide
  Pam3CSK, TLR2-TLR6 by the lipopeptide Malp2, TLR5 by flagellin, or TLR4 by LPS recruits
  MyD88 through the adaptor molecule TIRAP. MyD88 then recruits and activates the
  IRAK complex, which in turn activates TRAF6, which serves as a platform to recruit
  and activate TAK1 in cooperation with TAB1-3. Once activated, TAK1 activates the
  IKK-NFκB pathway and the MAPK- (including P38, ERK1/2, and JNK) AP1 pathway. Activated
  NFκB or AP1 translocates to the nucleus, driving the transcription of genes encoding
  proinflammatory cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and costimulatory molecules.
  Activation of endosomal TLR7 by ssRNA or guanosine, TLR8 by ssRNA, or TLR9 by CpG-DNA
  not only initiates the MyD88-TRAF6-dependent activation of AP1 and NFκB but also
  triggers the IRAK-, TRAF6-, TRAF3-, and IKKα-dependent activation of IRF7, translocation
  of which induces the transcription of type1 interferon genes including IFNα and
  IFNβ. In contrast, activation of TLR3 by dsRNA initiates the TRIF-dependent pathway,
  whereas TLR4 activation induces both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways. Once recruited
  to the intracellular domain of TLRs by TRAM, TRIF initiates a TRAF3-dependent activation
  of the TBK1-type 1 IFN pathway and/or a TRAF6-dependent activation of the TAK1-proinflammatory
  cytokine pathway. The TRAF3-dependent activation of TBK1 and IKKε and TBK1-mediated
  activation of AKT result in the coordinate activation of the transcription factor
  IRF3, which translocates to the nucleus and induces the transcription of type 1
  interferon genes upon activation. Pam3CSK4: tripalmitoyl-S-glycero-Cys-(Lys)4; Malp2:
