caption: 'Model of molecular mechanisms of phytosiderophore (PS)-mediated Fe and Zn
  uptake in dicotyledonous plants (Strategy I, e.g. peanut) intercropped with graminaceous
  plants (Strategy II, e.g. maize). Maize plants secrete PS or deoxymugineic acid
  (DMA) into the rhizopshere via the transporter of mugineic acid 1 (TOM1) or PS.
  In soil, otherwise insoluble Fe and Zn are desorbed and incorporated into Fe(III)–PS
  and Zn–PS complexes. The Fe–PS and Zn–PS are taken up by maize via the yellow stripe
  1 (YS1) plasma membrane transporter of maize roots. Three molecules of S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM) supplied from the methionine cycle combine to form nicotianamine (NA) which
  is converted to DMA for a continuous supply. The Fe(III)–DMA may be utilized by
  peanut via two pathways: reduction- or transporter-mediated uptake. In the reduction-based
  pathway, peanut roots release H+ through H+-ATPase 2 (HA2) and reduce Fe3+ via the
  ferric reduction oxidase 1 (AhFRO1) to Fe2+, which is then taken up via iron-regulated
  transporter 1 (AhIRT1), natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (AhNRAMP1)
  or divalent metal-ion transporter 1 (AhDMT1). In the transporter-mediated pathway,
  the Fe(III)–DMA is taken up directly via the yellow stripe1-like 1 (AhYSL1) transporter
  in the root epidermis. Free Zn2+ and Zn–PS may be taken up like Fe. Root–shoot translocation
  of Fe and Zn is mediated by Fe/Zn–NA or Fe/Zn–citrate complexes (). ‘?’ indicates
