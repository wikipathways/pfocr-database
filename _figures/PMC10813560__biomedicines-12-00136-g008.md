caption: (A) Heatmaps were generated to visualise the notable pathways identified
  as significant by DIANA-miRPath (v.3.0) for the specific miRNA signature for cPTC.
  These heatmaps utilised clustering to arrange the pathways based on their significance
  levels, with paths displayed along the x-axis and miRNAs along the y-axis. A colour
  code was applied to indicate the logarithmic (log) values of p-values. The most
  relevant interactions between predicted miRNAs and pathways were highlighted in
  red, (B) a graphical representation of the main target related to MAPK signalling
  and (C) a Thyroid hormone signalling pathway for the selected miRNA panel
