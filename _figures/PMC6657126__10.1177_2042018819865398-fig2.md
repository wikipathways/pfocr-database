caption: Hypothesized renal vascular and tubular effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists
  in diabetes.Numerous vascular and tubular pathways are involved in fasting and postprandial
  renal hemodynamics in the setting of diabetes (indicated by the black lines). These
  pathways result in a net reduction in afferent renal arteriolar resistance (afferent
  vasodilation) or a net increase in efferent renal arteriolar resistance (efferent
  vasoconstriction), thus increasing glomerular hydraulic pressure and single-nephron
  glomerular filtration rate, leading to glomerular hyperfiltration. GLP-1RAs are
  associated with direct GLP-1R-mediated vasodilation and at least partly with indirect
  nitric-oxide-dependent afferent vasodilation (indicated by the red lines), which
  might enhance glomerular hyperfiltration. In contrast, GLP-1RAs inhibit several
  pathways (indicated by the green lines) that might underlie the glomerular hyperfiltration
  in diabetes., GLP-1 RAs induce natriuresis, possibly by inhibiting NHE3 activity,
  either directly or indirectly through a (postprandial) vasopressor response. NHE3
  could also be inhibited through reduced levels of postprandial (a) glucagon, leading
  to inhibition of NHE3 in thick ascending limb, and potentially in the proximal tubule;,
  (b) insulin, leading to inhibition of NHE3 in the distal convoluted tubule; or (c)
  glucose, leading to downregulation and inhibition of NHE3 and SGLTs 1 and 2., Inhibition
  of sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule increases the sodium concentration
  at the level of the macula densa, which consequently restores the impaired TGF.–
  GLP-1RAs might reduce circulating levels and postreceptor actions of components
  of the RAS,,, although these findings could not be confirmed by others.,,,, GLP-1RAs
  might also suppress endothelin-1 expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of
  nuclear factor-kB. Finally, GLP-1RAs activate several anti-inflammatory pathways,
  including reductions in oxidative stress via reactive oxygen species.The net effect
  of GLP-1RAs on renal hemodynamics is thus the result of a balance between stimulation
  of afferent vasodilation and inhibition of pathways that cause efferent vasoconstriction,
  leading to mostly neutral effects on renal hemodynamics.ANG-I, angiotensin I; ANG-II,
