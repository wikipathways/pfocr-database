caption: 'Metabolite excretion of safrole in the rat is reported to be 93% within
  72 h, and most of this material (86%; []) would consist of metabolites formed via
  demethylenation of the methylenedioxy moiety to yield carbon monoxide or formate
  and the dihydroxy-benzene moiety []. The other metabolic routes observed were allylic
  hydroxylation and the epoxide-diol pathway [,]. Oxidations of the allylic side chain
  of safrole may proceed (i) via an epoxide resulting in side chain propane diols
  during different stages of the metabolic steps [], or (ii) via 1′-hydroxylation
  followed by sulfonation that might lead to a reactive carbocation intermediate [].
  Other possible steps of metabolic ways of safrole are (iii) the subsequent oxidation
  of the 1′-hydroxysafrole to the 1′-oxo-safrole [], (iv) oxidation at the 3′-position
  to yield 3′-hydroxy-isosafrole, and (v) the demethylenation of safrole to 4-allylcatechol
  that may isomerize to its quinone-methide [,,]. The occurrence of glutathione conjugates
  at the 1′-position may be indicative of the intermediate formation of para-quinone
  methide tautomers [], whereas glutathione conjugates at the benzene ring point to
  reactions with ortho-quinone intermediates []. CYP: cytochrome P450 monooxygenases;
  SULT: sulfotransferases; EH: epoxide hydrolases; nuc: nucleophilic structures such
  as DNA or proteins.'
