caption: Downstream products of ROS promote endothelial cells (ECs) dysfunction in
  atherosclerosis. Ox-LDL induces ECs apoptosis via caspase dependent or independent
  pathway, and induces ECs autophage by repressing the Rheb-mediated mTOR/P70S6kinase/4EBP
  signaling pathway through increased miR-155 expression. Furthermore, ox-LDL induces
  oxidative stress in ECs through agumented NADPH oxidase and uncoupled eNOS. ERK5
  SUMOylation induced by ROS leads to transrepression of atheroprotective genes PPARγ
  and KLF2/4-mediated eNOS expression, both of which increase NF-κB activation. Decreased
  adiponectin increase NF-κB activation, and decreased AMPK increase ER stress induced
  by ox-LDL via enhanced SERCA oxidation.
