caption: Overview of the different functions of TNFR1 and TNFR2. TNFR1 is activated
  by sTNF and mTNF whereas TNFR2 is preferentially activated by mTNF. TNFR1 contains
  a death domain and can therefore execute cell death signals. TNFR1 signalling that
  leads to the activation of NFκB (cf. Fig. ) mediates inflammation as well as cell
  survival and proliferation. TNFR2 does not contain a death domain. Recruitment of
  TRAF1 and 2 as well as cIAP1 and 2 to the intracellular domain of TNFR2 results
  in canonical and, via activation of NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK), to non-canonical
  NFκB activation. Besides induction of inflammation, cell survival, and proliferation,
  TNFR2 was supposed to cooperate with TNFR1 to induce cell death by down-modulation
  of TRAF2 and cIAPs, thereby inhibiting the anti-apoptotic NFκB signalling pathway
  (not shown, see text). Moreover, it has been assumed that mTNF might function as
  receptor for an activating antibody, thereby inducing apoptosis by reverse signalling
