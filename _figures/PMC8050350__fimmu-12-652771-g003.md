caption: Mitochondrial Defects in T cells in rheumatoid arthritis. RA CD4+ T cells
  fail to maintain mitochondrial DNA due to the transcriptional repression of the
  nuclease MRE11A, a limiting factor in DNA double-strand break repair and replication
  fork protection. Instability of mtDNA causes leakage of mtDNA fragments into the
  cytosol, triggering activation of the inflammasome and eventually T cell pyroptotic
  death. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is further impaired by the disruption
  of the TCA cycle. Transcriptional repression of succinyl-CoA ligase (SUCLG2) prevents
  the conversion of a-ketoglutarate into succinate and forces the TCA cycle to change
  direction. In a cataploretic reaction, mitochondria of RA T cells produce and export
  excess citrate, creating an acetyl-CoA-rich environment in the cytoplasm. Together
  with NADPH generated in the hyperactive pentose phosphate pathway surplus acetyl-CoA
  enters biosynthesis, specifically lipogenesis. Also, excess acetyl-CoA drives protein
  acetylation, including the acetylation of microtubules. α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; mtDNA,
  mitochondrial DNA; SUCLG2, Succinate-CoA Ligase GDP-Forming Subunit Beta.

    cells fail to maintain mitochondrial DNA due to the transcriptional repression
    of the nuclease MRE11A, a limiting factor in DNA double-strand break repair and
    replication fork protection. Instability of mtDNA causes leakage of mtDNA fragments
    into the cytosol, triggering activation of the inflammasome and eventually T cell
    pyroptotic death. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is further impaired
    by the disruption of the TCA cycle. Transcriptional repression of succinyl-CoA
    ligase (SUCLG2) prevents the conversion of a-ketoglutarate into succinate and
    forces the TCA cycle to change direction. In a cataploretic reaction, mitochondria
    of RA T cells produce and export excess citrate, creating an acetyl-CoA-rich environment
    in the cytoplasm. Together with NADPH generated in the hyperactive pentose phosphate
    pathway surplus acetyl-CoA enters biosynthesis, specifically lipogenesis. Also,
    excess acetyl-CoA drives protein acetylation, including the acetylation of microtubules.
