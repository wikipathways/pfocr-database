caption: RAP1 and its regulation and role in cancer cell. RAP1 can be regulated at
  transcription level by alternative splicing or post-transcriptional level by miRNAs,
  lncRNAs or post-translational, such as enzymatic or non-enzymatic modifications.
  At telomeric regions, RAP1 associates with TRF2 protein, whereas TRF2–RAP1 complex
  represses homology-directed repair (HDR) by inhibiting PARP1 and SLX4. RAP1 regulates
  the expression of TERRA and in consequence influences telomere length. At non-telomeric
  regions, RAP1 acts as an adaptor promoting association of XRCC4/Ligase IV with DNA-PK,
  thus activating the non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ). RAP1 acts as a transcription
  factor and regulates gene expression involved in cell metabolism, inflammation,
  and cancer. Under extreme conditions, RAP1 shuttles from nucleus to cytoplasm, where
  it acts as an essential modulator of NF-kB Notch-mediated pathways. Created with
