caption: 'Schematic representation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt Off:
  in the absence of the Wnt ligand, β-catenin stability is controlled by the complex
  formed by GSK-3β, AXIN, CK1α, and APC (destruction complex). β-catenin is then phosphorylated
  and ubiquitinated for proteasomal degradation. Wnt On: In the presence of Wnt ligands,
  multimerization of Frizzled (Fz) receptors and LRP (lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein) co-receptors occur on the cell surface. The Dvl protein is recruited to
  the cell membrane to interact with Frizzled receptors, leading to interaction with
  the destruction complex. Wnt signaling is activated by binding to its receptor,
  which induces AXIN binding to phosphorylated LRP. β-catenin is then stabilized and
  binds to TCF in the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes. GSK-3β (glycogen
