caption: Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as IGF-IR and EGFR, integrins, and G-protein
  coupled receptors (GPCR) can all stimulate PI3K. PI3K phosphorylates PI(4)P and
  PI(4,5)P2 at the 3′-position to generate PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, respectively.
  PTEN opposes the function of PI3K by removing 3′-phosphate groups. LY294002 is a
  reversible small molecule inhibitor of PI3K, while wortmannin and its analogue,
  PX-866, are irreversible inhibitors. Generation of 3′-phosphoinositides activates
  both Akt and PDK-1, which phosphorylates Akt at T308. Akt propagates its signal
  to affect transcription, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression. Perifosine and phosphatidylinositol
  ether lipid analogues (PIAs) are lipid-based Akt inhibitors that interact with the
  PH domain of Akt and prevent its translocation to the membrane, while API-2, also
  known as triciribine, is a small molecule that inhibits the kinase activity of Akt.
  Akt can activate mTOR directly by phosphorylation at S2448 or indirectly, by phosphorylation
  and inactivation of TSC2. When TSC2 is inactivated, the GTPase Rheb is maintained
  in its GTP-bound state, allowing for increased activation of mTOR. mTOR (TORC1)
  activates S6 kinase 1, which activates ribosomal protein S6 and leads to increased
  protein translation. TORC1 also phosphorylates 4EBP-1, causing it to dissociate
  from eIF4E, and freeing eIF4E to participate in formation of the translation initiation
  complex. Inhibitors of mTOR include rapamycin and its analogues, RAD-001 and CCI-779,
  all of which bind to the FK506-binding protein, FKBP-12, which then binds and inhibits
  mTOR.
