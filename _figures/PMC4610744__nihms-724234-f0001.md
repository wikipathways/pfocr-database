caption: 'Genes and pathways identified from GWAS and/or studies of monogenic allergy-related
  diseases. Genes identified from GWAS are in bold while genes identified from studies
  of monogenic diseases are in normal font. A generic cell as well as the skin/mucosal
  barrier are depicted in order to illustrate the cellular location of gene products.
  For loci with multiple associated genes where one or more genes have a demonstrated
  function relevant for atopic disease, only these well-established genes are shown
  for clarity. It should be noted that the genes and pathways named in this figure
  might not represent the true causal gene or pathway associated with a given locus
  since these have not been definitively established for many GWAS findings.GWAS results
  have been aggregated from the most powerful GWAS (>3 genome-wide significant loci)
