caption: 'Lignin pathway genes differentially expressed in stem tissues of two alfalfa
  genotypes. Pair-wise comparisons were made between stem tissues (ES, PES) of genotypes
  708 and 773. Columns in each heatmap from left to right: Log2(708ES/773ES), Log2(708PES/773PES),
  Log2(708PES/708ES), and Log2(773PES/773ES). The rows in each heatmap represent lignin
  gene sequences identified in MSGI 1.0. The Log2 expression ratio values were false
  color-coded using a scale of -3 to 3. The intensity of blue and red indicates the
  degree of up- and down-regulation of the corresponding lignin gene in the denominator
  in each column mentioned above. The red and blue color saturates at -3 and 3, respectively.
  See Methods for details. The heatmaps generated were inserted next to the corresponding
  lignin gene in the lignin biosynthetic pathway diagram downloaded from the KEGG
