caption: Various signaling pathways modulated by the primary cilium. (a) Platelet-derived
  growth factor (PDGF) signaling through PDGF receptor αα requires ciliary localization
  of the receptor to activate downstream targets mediated by the MAP kinase kinase
  (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. (b) Canonical Wnt signaling
  through LRP5/6 and Frizzled (Fzd) is probably inhibited by the primary cilium, whereas
  the planar cell polarity (PCP) non-canonical pathway requires factors essential
  for ciliogenesis for activity, probably by mediating cellular polarity and polarized
  basal body localization, and is then activated by Dishevelled (Dvl) interacting
  with either Fzd or other PCP components. (c) Binding of Shh to patched 1 (Ptc1)
  activates Shh signaling by releasing inhibition of smoothened (Smo)-Gli-mediated
  downstream target gene transcription.
