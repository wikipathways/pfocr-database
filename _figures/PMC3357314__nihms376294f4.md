caption: Regulation of CTGF Expression by TGF-β1 in OsteoblastsTGF-β1 induction of
  CTGF in osteoblasts requires Src, Smad and ERK signaling. The canonical TGF-β1/Smad
  signaling pathway involves TGF-β1 activation of transmembrane serine/threonine TGF-β1
  receptors (TβRI and TβRII) that in turn phosphorylate receptor Smads (Smad 2 and
  Smad 3). Following activation, Smad 2 and 3 form a trimeric complex with Smad 4,
  and this complex subsequently translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to Smad
  binding elements (SBE) in DNA through association with other transcriptional co-activators
  and/or co-repressors to regulate CTGF. Smad 2 is dispensable for CTGF induction
  by TGF-β1 in osteoblasts. Src plays a central role in TGF-β1 signaling in osteoblasts
  by regulating the activation of both Erk and Smad 2 and 3. ERK functions in a combinatorial
  manner with Smad signaling and facilitates SBE transactivation. In addition, the
  TRE and SBE are also required for basal and TGF-β1 induced CTGF expression. Future
  studies are needed to identify other CTGF regulatory mechanisms in osteoblasts.
