caption: Simplified schematic of the S. aureus WTA biosynthetic pathway. Tunicamycin
  inhibits TarO and targocil inhibits the transmembrane component (TarG) of the ABC
  transporter (TarGH) responsible for WTA export. Nonessential early steps in the
  WTA pathway are indicated by green arrows; essential late steps are indicated by
  red arrows. Nonessential tailoring steps are omitted for clarity.
