caption: 'Metabolic access points of synthetic and native methylotrophic pathways
  into glycolytic yeast metabolism. Shown is the metabolic overlap of named methylotrophic
  and glycolytic pathway architectures to funnel C1 substrates like methanol into
  central carbon metabolism as main target of synthetic methylotrophy. Depicted methylotrophic
  pathways are limited to the main important variants. Orange diamond marks the connection
  of RuMP cycle with formaldehyde assimilation via the regenerated pentose. Metabolite
  abbreviations are: G6P: glucose 6-phosphate; 6PGL: 6-phosphogluconolactone; RU5P:
  ribulose 5-phosphate; HU6P: hexulose 6-phosphate; R5P: ribose 5-phosphate; XU5P:
  xylulose 5-phosphate; S7P: sedoheptulose 7-phosphate; E4P: erythrose 4-phosphate;
  F6P: fructose 6-phosphate; F1,6BP: fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; G3P: glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; DHA: dihydroxyacetone; DHAP: dihydroxyacetonephosphate; O2: molecular
  oxygen; CO2: molecular carbon dioxide; H2O: molecular water; H2O2: molecular hydrogen
  peroxide; NAD(P)+: oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate); NAD(P)H:
  reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate); ADP: adenosine diphosphate;
  ATP: adenosine triphosphate; NH3: molecular ammonia; Pi: inorganic phosphate'
