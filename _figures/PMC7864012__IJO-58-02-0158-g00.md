caption: The Serine-glycine biosynthesis pathway. The glycolysis pathway and glutamine
  catabolism provide an intermediate metabolite, 3-PG, which is gradually catalyzed
  into serine by PHGDH, PSAT1 and PSPH. Finally, serine is converted into glycine
  by SHMT1/2. Yellow ovals represent metabolic enzymes. 3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate;
  3-PHP, 3-phosphate hydroxypyruvate; 3-Pser, 3-phosphoserine; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PSAT, phosphoserine aminotransferase;
  PSPH, phosphoserine phosphatase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid.
