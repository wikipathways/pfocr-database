caption: Main metabolic pathway (classical) for Trp in cancer cells and new route
  proposed in this project. Trp is mostly metabolized by the kynurenine pathway (KP),
  originating quinolinic acid and kynurenic acid as the main metabolites (a). Trp
  is also the main precursor of serotonin (5-HT) (b). In this study, we propose the
  existence of a new alternative route (c) of Trp metabolism leading to the production
  of IAN.
