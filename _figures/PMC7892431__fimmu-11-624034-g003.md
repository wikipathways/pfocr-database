caption: Dysregulation of nucleic acid-induced signaling during HCC development. Altered
  nucleic acid-sensing pathways associated with HCC pathogenesis include cGAS/STING,
  RIG-I, TLR3, AIM2 and PKR. Impairment of RIG-I expression favors STAT1 interaction
  with its negative regulator SHP1, thus altering STAT1-mediated proapoptotic signaling.
  Similarly, the suppression of IFN signaling via the cGAS/STING pathway leads to
  an altered STAT1 activation. Downregulation of TLR3 in the context of HCC leads
  to an impaired attraction/activation of immune cells to the tumor microenvironment,
  the failure to induce a gene expression pattern that mediates cytotoxicity (e.g.,
  GrB, IFN-γ) and the subsequent clearance of cancer cells. AIM2 downregulation alters
  normal formation of the AIM2 inflammasome and favors expression of HIF-1α, leading
  to the development of malignant cellular characteristics such as vascular invasion
  and lymph node metastasis. Activation of PKR in tumor lesions favors the expression
  of growth factors such as VEGF, PDGF, FGF, and EGF, which favor angiogenesis and
  potentially the development of vascular invasion and metastasis.
