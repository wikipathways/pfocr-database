caption: Molecular mechanism of proinsulin and insulin relation with autophagy in
  ER-Golgi pathway. The degradation mechanism of insulin and proinsulin by lysosomes
  seem to be different. Proinsulin is mainly degraded via macroautophagy, while insulin
  granule degradation is through microautophagy and crinophagy. Induction of autophagy
  by pharmacological stimulators (rapamycin and trehalose) and genetic interference
  using Tat-beclin-1 exhibited reduced proinsulin content in β cells without affecting
  the insulin amount.
