caption: The role of OTUB2 in the Hh pathway. When Hh protein bound to the patched
  (Ptch) receptor, the original inhibition of Ptch on the smoothened (Smo) co-receptor
  was released, and the Hh pathway was activated. Suppressor of fused (Sufu) protein
  separated from Gli2, thus Gli2 entered the nucleus as a transcription factor to
  maintain the expression of related bone differentiation genes such as BMP2, Runt-related
  transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). The overactivation of the Hh signaling pathway resulted
  from direct deubiquitination of Gli2 by OTUB2 (i.e. cleavage of the K48 polyubiquitin
  chain as a degradation signal marker) and was closely related to the indirect blockage
  of Gli2 degradation by Akt. Therefore, OTUB2 may promote the occurrence of cancer
  effect.
