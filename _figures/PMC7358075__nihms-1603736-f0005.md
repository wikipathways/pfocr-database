caption: A hypothetical representation of two states of the MYC network and their
  impact on gene expression programs that influence growth, proliferation, differentiation,
  apoptosis and metabolism. (A) A balanced network in which gene expression is controlled
  through normal endogenous regulation of the MYC network. Transcriptional effects
  of MYC-MAX are balanced by MNT (heterodimerized with either MAX or MLX), MGA-MAX,
  and, under conditions of stress, by MLXIP-MLX or MLXIPL-MLX. (B) An unbalanced network
  due to deregulation of MYC expression. In this state MYC-MAX suppresses differentiation,
  reprograms metabolism, and triggers the apoptotic pathway. The suppressive effects
  of MGA-MAX and MNT-MAX/MLX on proliferation are overwhelmed by MYC-MAX which contributes
  to suppression of MYC-induced apoptosis. Increased nuclear accumulation of MLXIP-MLX
  (in response to deregulated MYC and/or metabolic stress) adjusts metabolic reprogramming
  by MYC-MAX and further reduces apoptosis. The effects on gene expression are presumed
  to occur through genomic binding and co-occupancy by network members. Green arrows,
  transcriptional activation; red arrows, transcriptional repression. Arrow width
  proportional to estimated transcriptional effect. Diagram adapted from [].

    Transcriptional effects of MYC-MAX are balanced by MNT (heterodimerized with either

    overwhelmed by MYC-MAX which contributes to suppression of MYC-induced apoptosis.
    Increased nuclear accumulation of MLXIP-MLX (in response to deregulated MYC and/or
    metabolic stress) adjusts metabolic reprogramming by MYC-MAX and further reduces
    apoptosis. The effects on gene expression are presumed to occur through genomic
