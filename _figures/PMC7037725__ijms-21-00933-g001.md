caption: Molecular mechanisms underlying GOLPH3 function in human cancer. (a) Altered
  Golgi-to-PM trafficking. Recruitment of the PI(4)P-binding protein GOLPH3 at the
  trans-Golgi network (TGN), requires the PITPNC1/RAB1B network. Overactivation of
  the GOLPH3/MYO18A pathway leads to Golgi extension and enhanced vesicle release,
  resulting in the massive secretion of growth factors and matrix metalloproteases,
  which are responsible for cancer malignancy. (b) GOLPH3 role in Golgi-protein glycosylation.
  GOLPH3 is involved in COPI-mediated retrograde trafficking of several Golgi glycosyltransferases
  (GT). GOLPH3 protein binds to sialyltransferases (Sia T); its overexpression results
  in enhanced α2,6-sialylation of β1-integrins. Altered glycosylation affects integrin-mediated
  signaling pathway, leading to activation of FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and RhoA-dependent
  actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell migration. (c) GOLPH3 is required for
  Golgi ribbon reorganization in response to DNA damage. DNA damage, induced by treatment
  with drugs and ionizing radiation, leads to activation of the DNA damage protein
  kinase (DNA-PK) that phosphorylates GOLPH3 on T143 and T148 residues. In turn, phosphorylation
  of GOLPH3 increases its interaction with MYO18A and its tensile force on the Golgi,
  leading to fragmentation of Golgi membranes and their dispersal throughout the cytoplasm.
  Massive Golgi fragmentation has been correlated to tumor development and maintenance
  since it is linked to cell survival and resistance to killing by DNA-damaging agents.
  (d) Relationship between GOLPH3 oncogenic activity and endocytic trafficking. GOLPH3
  associates with the retromer complex subunit Vps35 to regulate recycling of several
  transmembrane receptors including the Wnt chaperone Wntless (Wls). In glioma cell
  lines, GOLPH3 overexpression increases Wls recycling and Wnt secretion, leading
  to abnormal Wnt/β-catenin signaling. GOLPH3 oncogenic activity in endocytic trafficking
  is responsible for a prolonged EGFR signaling. GOLPH3 binds to Rab5 and inhibits
  its activation on early endosome. High levels of GOLPH3 protein impair Rab5-mediated
  endocytosis and degradation of EGFR. As a result, overactivation of downstream signaling
  pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK2/STAT3 promote cell proliferation and tumor
  transformation.
