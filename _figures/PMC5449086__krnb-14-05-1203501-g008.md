caption: A schematic model of the regulatory role of ADAR1 in liver homeostasis. Under
  homeostatic conditions, ADAR1 catalyzes the promiscuous A-to-I editing of duplex-forming
  repetitive elements within mRNAs to reduce their potential to serve as ligands for
  the cytosolic dsRNA sensor, MDA5 (* refer to ). In addition, as we now show, ADAR1
  interacts with IKKβ to regulate the activity of the canonical NFκB pathway. Thus,
  lack of ADAR1 in hepatocyte induces aberrant signaling downstream of MDA5 leading
  to MAVS-dependent activation of IRF3 and NFκB transcriptional activity (** refer
  to. ). Low ADAR1 levels are strongly associated with enhanced degradation of IκBα
  and the nuclear translocation of p65/p50 dimers to induce IL6 transcription. Moreover,
  the reciprocal activation/nuclear translocation of IRF3 promotes transcription of
  type-I interferons and multiple ISGs. This aberrant synergistic activation of the
  NFκB and type-I interferons pathways in hepatocytes, upon ADAR1 depletion, results
  in IL6-dependent paracrine activation of stellate cells to display a fibrogenic
  phenotype (Col1A+/aSMA+) alongside the recruitment of CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes
  and CD11B+ Ly6G+ granulocytes, further mediating multifocal liver damage and fibrosis.
