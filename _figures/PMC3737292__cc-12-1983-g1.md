caption: Figure 1. By targeting multiple pathways, microRNA networks such as miR-17-associated
  pathway play a key role in regulating stress response of cancer cells. These stresses
  may come from chemotherapy treatment, lack of blood supply, cell apoptosis and immune
  attack. To respond to these stresses, miR-17 could mediate drug resistance, angiogenesis,
  cell survival and immune evasion.
