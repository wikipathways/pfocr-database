caption: Schematic illustration of the effects of colchicine on the sympathoadrenal
  medullar axis and postneuronal inflammatory pathways. Paraventricular nuclei (PVN)
  and the locus coeruleus (LC) receive dense catecholaminergic innervation originating
  from noradrenergic and adrenergic cell groups in the lower brain stem. Following
  exposure to stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathoadrenal
  medullar axis (SAM) are activated. In the SAM axis, preganglionic sympathetic neurons
  secrete acetylcholine in the adrenal medulla, which stimulates the release of catecholamines,
  predominantly epinephrine (EPI) and, to a much lesser extent, norepinephrine (NE),
  into the circulation. Postganglionic sympathetic neurons also predominantly secrete
  NE. It is well known that sympathetic noradrenergic nerves innervate primary and
  secondary lymphoid organs. Circulating NE/EPI can potentiate the actions of sympathetic
  nerves acting at adrenergic receptors in immune organs. These stress mediators may
  activate the inflammasome and other inflammation pathways by binding to adrenergic
  receptors expressed on immune cells in a synapse-like fashion or following diffusion
  through the parenchyma of the innervated tissue. Colchicine (Col), at the neuronal
  level, inhibits catecholamine transportation through the CNS and PNS and prevents
  the release of EPI from the adrenal glands (neuronal effect). At the postneuronal
  level, Col keeps the pyrin inflammasome in an inactive form by activating RhoA.
  Thus, it inhibits caspase-1 activation and IL-1β release. Col inhibits the NF-kB
  inflammation pathway and neutrophil adhesion, extravasation, and recruitment by
  altering neutrophil L-selectin expression and endothelial cell E-selectin distribution.
  Hypothalamic-hypophyseal-adrenal axis response to stress and its mediators are not
  presented in this figure. GPCR, G protein-coupled receptors; CNS, Central nervous
