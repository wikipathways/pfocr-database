caption: Targeting glutamine metabolic reprogramming in cancers. Glutamine and its
  involvement in glutaminolysis are critical in the metabolic network regulating cancer
  growth. To suppress cancer growth. strategies include using glutamine mimetics to
  target transporters and metabolic pathways like glutaminolysis, lipid synthesis,
  and autophagy. Enzymes involved in glutamine catabolism (GLS1, GLUD1. GDH1, and
  GOT2/GPT) and regulators of glutamine transport (KRAS. HIFO, mTOR) are targeted
  to inhibit glutamine breakdown and transport. Inhibiting glutamine synthesis from
  glutamine (by GLUL) reduces glutamine anabolism and nucleotide synthesis. EGFR and
  Akt/PI3K are targeted to inhibit mTOR. Tumor suppressor genes Myc and p53, which
  regulate glutamine metabolism and transport, are potential targets. miRNA mimics
  and anti‐miRs can inhibit circular RNAs that activate GLUD1. Glutamine‐driven oxidative
  phosphorylation, supporting ATP production, is inhibited by IASCS‐010759
