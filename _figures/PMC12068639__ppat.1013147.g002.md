caption: Upon recognition of viral DNAs or RNAs, pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs)
  such as TLR3, cGas/STING and RLRs (RIG-I and MDA5) are activated by TRIM proteins
  [12,15–20,26,28]. Except for TLR3, this positive regulation is dependent on polyubiquitination
  or SUMOylation catalyzed by TRIM proteins. TRIM proteins actions on immune signaling
  pathways result in the promotion of type I interferon production, which in turn
  activates the expression of many TRIM proteins, through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.
  TRIM21 itself detects intracellular opsonized viruses and initiates the NF-κB pathway
