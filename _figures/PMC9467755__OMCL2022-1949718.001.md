caption: The signal pathway of SIRT1-mediated antioxidation in stroke. The picture
  shows the signal pathway of SIRT1-mediated antioxidation in stroke. In response
  to oxidative stress after stroke, SIRT1 mainly mediates four molecular modifications,
  including Nrf2, FOXO, PGC-1α, and MAPT. By deacetylating the major acetylation sites,
  the level of FOXO, PGC-1α, and Nrf2 is upregulated by SIRT1, while MAPT is downregulated.
  When the level of FOXO, PGC-1α, and Nrf2 increases, several kinds of antioxidant
  proteins also correspondingly increase, which further suppress oxidative stress.
  In addition, the accumulation of abnormal MAPT will be reduced through deacetylating
  MAPT, thus reducing the damaging effect on cells. Therefore, some drugs or upstream
  regulators can inhibit oxidative stress by acting on SIRT1, which further exerts
  neuroprotective effects.
