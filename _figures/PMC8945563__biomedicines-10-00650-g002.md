caption: 'Interplay between SMARCB1 deficiency and immune modulation in SMARCB1-deficient
  MRT and RMC. Bottom right part of the tumor cell: in MRT, ERVs de-repression contributes
  to the accumulation of the cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) which are recognized
  by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and MDA5 sensors. MDA5 binds to MAVS resulting
  in a signaling cascade which promotes the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation
  of IRF3, and subsequent induction of type I/III interferon-stimulated genes (ISG).
  This overall results in cytokine production which favors the recruitment of TILs.
  Aberrantly expressed ERV may also contribute to the development of an adaptive immune
  response through the production of tumor associated neoantigens (TAA). Upper left
  part of the tumor cell: in RMC and within a context of MYC-induced replication stress,
  dsDNA is released in the cytoplasm, which activates the cGAS/STING DNA-sensing pathway.
  The DNA sensor cGAS binds to dsDNA, which triggers the formation of cyclic G-AMP
  (cGAMP), and subsequently activates STING. cGAMP-bound STING recruits TBK1 and phosphotylates
  IRF3, which translocates to the nucleus where it triggers the expression of ISG.'
