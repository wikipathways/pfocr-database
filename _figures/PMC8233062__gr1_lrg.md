caption: A visual representation of the mechanisms of complement activation by SARS-CoV-2,
  and the routes by which this may directly lead to symptoms and ultimately hospitalisation.
  Also highlighted are areas of the pathway which are currently showing promise in
  the development of treatments for those suffering with infection.
