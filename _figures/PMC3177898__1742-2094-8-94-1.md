caption: 'modified from []: Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and a precursor
  for the synthesis of serotonin. Alternatively, tryptophan can be metabolized in
  glial cells via the kynurenine pathway to create kynurenic acid (synthesized by
  kynurenine aminotransferase, KAT) or quinolinic acid (QUIN). These substances are
  endogenous modulators of NMDA glutamate receptors. A key enzyme of the kynurenine
  pathway, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and the enzyme that catalyses the production
  of 3-OH-kynurenine, kynurenine monoxygenase (KMO), are activated by proinflammatory
  cytokines, including interleukin-1 and -6 (IL-1, IL-6), tumor necrosis factor a
  (TNFa), or interferon g (IFNg). These enzymes are inhibited by anti-inflammatory
  cytokines, including IL-4. Serotonin is normally broken down into 5-hydroxyindoleacetic
  acid (5-HIAA), but the indole ring of serotonin can also be cleaved by IDO to form
  formyl-5-hydroxykynurenamine (f-5-KYM). Annotation: grey arrows: activation; dotted
  grey lines with bar at the end: inhibition; black font: potentially neurotoxic;
  purple font: neutral or not known; bright blue: potentially neuroprotective.'
