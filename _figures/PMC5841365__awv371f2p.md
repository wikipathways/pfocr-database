caption: 'Macroautophagy: an overview of the molecular pathway and mutations associated
  with congenital disorders of autophagy. Macroautophagy is a step-wise process resulting
  in the formation of double-membrane-bound autophagic vesicles that engulf their
  cargo before fusing with lysosomes. The principle stages of macroautophagy include:
  (I) initiation; (II) nucleation of an isolation membrane (also called phagophore);
  (III) elongation of evolving autophagic vesicles; (IV) engulfment of cargo and closure
  of the autophagosomal membrane; (V) autophagosome maturation; (VI) fusion with late
  endosomes or lysosomes; and finally (VII) degradation of cargo through lysosomal
  hydrolases. The last step yields basic metabolites that are then recycled. Mutations
  in congenital disorders of autophagy and single gene disorders associated with deficits
  in the regulation of autophagy impair different stages of the pathway. Through interfering
  with the beclin 1 complex, hereditary spastic paraplegia-associated recessive mutations
  in ZFYVE26 (SPG15) impair early stages such as the formation of the isolation membrane.
  Mutations in TECPR2 (SPG49) were recently shown to be critically involved in maintaining
  endoplasmic reticulum exit sites that may serve as scaffolds for the formation of
  early autophagosome intermediates. X-linked WDR45 mutations cause beta-propeller
  protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) and have been found to potentially interfere
  with the elongation of nascent autophagic vesicles. Autosomal-recessive EPG5 mutations
  in Vici syndrome as well as SNX14 mutations in SNX14-associated autosomal-recessive
  cerebellar ataxia and intellectual disability syndrome impact the late stages of
  the autophagy pathway through impairing autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Mutations
  in SPG11 (SPG11) lead to a defect in autophagic lysosome reformation. Autophagy-associated
  diseases also affect different stages of autophagy regulation. An example for mTOR-associated
  neurodevelopmental diseases, loss-of-function mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 in tuberous
  sclerosis complex lead to constitutive activation of mTORC1 and thus block autophagic
  flux at multiple stages. Locating the defect to the late stages of the pathway,
  lysosomal storage diseases impact lysosomal metabolism and thus block upstream steps
  in the autophagy pathway. Impaired crosstalk between the lysosomal pathway and autophagosome
  biogenesis might also impact the coordinated regulation of both compartments. AR-CAID
  = autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxia and intellectual disability syndrome; LSD
  = lysosomal storage disease; TSC = tuberous sclerosis complex.'
