caption: UPR mechanism. Upon the aggregation of the unfolded proteins, binding-immunoglobulin
  protein (BiP) dissociates from inositol requiring protein-1 (IRE1), protein kinase
  RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), allowing
  their activation. Activated IRE1 splices X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1) mRNA, producing
  spliced XBP-1 (sXBP-1) that translocates to the nucleus and regulates the expression
  of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) transcription factor. IRE1 can recruit tumor
  necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor-2 (TRAF2) and apoptosis-signaling-kinase
  1 (ASK1), resulting in the downstream activation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase
  (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activation protein kinase (MAPK). Activated p38 MAPK phosphorylates
  and activates CHOP, whereas JNK translocates to the mitochondrial membrane, inhibiting
  B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and activating Bcl-2 interacting protein (Bim). IRE1 can
  activate Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer
  protein (Bak) that induce inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) to initiate
  the release of Ca2+ from the ER. Activated PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation
  factor 2 (eIF2), which allows the translation of ATF4 through an eIF2-independent
  pathway, and ATF4 translocates to the nucleus and stimulates the transcription of
  proteins required to regain ER homeostasis. ATF6 is activated by the Golgi resident
  enzymes through a limited proteolysis, and it regulates the expression of CHOP.
  During the ER stress, all three UPR pathways result in the initiation of CHOP transcription.
