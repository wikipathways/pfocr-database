caption: 'Mechanisms underlying the essential role of mitochondria in yeast replicative
  aging. (A) A decline in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and the
  resulting reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) delay replicative aging
  in yeast by: (1) stimulating Rtg2-dependent nuclear import of the Rtg1-Rtg3 heterodimeric
  transcription factor, thereby activating the mitochondrial retrograde signaling
  pathway; (2) promoting the import of Rtg2 into the nucleus, where it increases genome
  stability; and (3) reducing a protein kinase activity of the target of rapamycin
  protein 1 (Tor1). The reduction of ΔΨ also attenuates mitochondrial synthesis and/or
  export of iron-sulfur clusters (ISC), which are needed for maintaining genome stability
  and inhibiting the Aft1-driven transcription of nuclear genes involved in iron entry
  into the cell; (B) A transition from the early-age stage to the intermediate-age
  stage of replicative aging coincides with a rise of mitochondrial reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and fragmentation of mitochondria in the mother cell; these fragmented
  mitochondria produce more ROS, aggregate and lose mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) during
  the subsequent late-age stage of replicative aging. The dysfunctional mitochondria
  formed during the intermediate-age and late-age stages of replicative aging are
  so-called “aging factors”. They limit the replicative lifespan of the mother cell;
  their Sir2- and Myo2-driven movement to the daughter cell occurs slower than that
  of fully functional mitochondria; (C) A reduction in the quantity of the Afo1 protein
  component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome delays replicative
  aging in yeast by: (1) stimulating Sfp1-driven transcription of nuclear genes encoding
  protein components of cytoplasmic ribosomes; and (2) attenuating the TOR signaling
  pathway, which accelerates the pro-aging process of protein synthesis in the cytosol
  and also slows down the anti-aging processes of autophagy and transcription of stress-response
  genes in the nucleus; (D) Mitochondrial translation control (MTC) proteins assist
  in processing, stabilization and translation of mRNAs encoded by mtDNA. A reduction
  in the quantity of MTC proteins slows down replicative aging in yeast by: (1) triggering
  the Pnc1- and Sir2-dependent inhibition of the synthesis of extrachromosomal rDNA
  circles; and (2) reducing the cellular concentration of cAMP and thus attenuating
  the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which decelerates the anti-aging
  processes of autophagy and transcription of stress-response genes in the nucleus
  and also accelerates the pro-aging process of protein synthesis in the cytosol;
  (E) Afg3 is a mitochondrial protease involved in maintaining protein homeostasis
  (proteostasis) in mitochondria. The Afg3-driven processes in mitochondria include
  degradation of misfolded proteins, assembly of ETC protein complexes and processing
  of a protein component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome; these
  proteostatic processes within mitochondria stimulate such pro-aging processes outside
  of these organelles as protein synthesis in the cytosol and the accumulation of
  unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); (F) The Uth1 protein in the
  mitochondrial outer membrane is a pro-aging factor that accelerates replicative
  aging in yeast by concurrently weakening macromitophagic degradation of dysfunctional
  mitochondria and enhancing micromitophagic degradation of functional mitochondria.
  Activation arrows and inhibition bars denote pro-aging processes (displayed in blue
  color) or anti-aging processes (displayed in red color). See the text for additional
  details.'
