caption: 'a The Spearman correlation coefficient revealed the association between
  the changes of fermentation parameters and the expression of these eight growth-related
  genes (SCC > 0.85 and p < 0.01). The lines’ colour represents two kinds of correlation:
  blue, negative correction and red, positive correction. b The co-regulation network
  of these eight genes is related to rumen epithelium growth. The arrow represents
  the activation of the signalling pathway, and the horizontal line represents the
  inhibition of the signalling pathway. The signalling pathways and functions involved
  in the network were predicted by the KEGG pathway analysis. The different colour
  lines represent different functions that these pathways regulated. Abbreviations:
