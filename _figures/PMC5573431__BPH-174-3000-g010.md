caption: Proposed mode for the protection against intrahepatic cholestasis induced
  by fenofibrate. The protection involves inhibition of the JNK pathway and is dependent
  on both PPARα and the dose of the PPARα agonist. Solid lines denote biological responses,
  toxicological or pharmacological actions. Broken lines denote the responses or actions
  that contribute little to the indicated pathways or endpoints. Bold arrow of JNK
  pathway inhibition denotes that it is critically involved in the protective effects
  of fenofibrate.
