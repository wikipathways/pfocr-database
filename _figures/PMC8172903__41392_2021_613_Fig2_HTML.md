caption: Crosstalk between STING1 and autophagy. a The activation of STING1 by bacterial
  CDNs triggers autophagy through ER stress or the MTOR-ULK1-BECN1 pathway. b cGAMP
  binds to STING1, causing it to be translocated from the ER to the ERGIC and Golgi.
  The ERGIC serves as a membrane source for the recruitment and lipidation of MAP1LC3
  through an ATG5-, ATG7-, and WIPI2-dependent mechanism, leading to autophagosome
  formation. Autophagosomes engulfing DNA and pathogens target STING1 in an SQSTM1-dependent
  or -independent manner. c Activated STING1 can translocate to endosomes through
  the trans-Golgi network. Both the endosomes and autophagosomes fused with lysosomes
  require RAB7A GTPase. d STING1-mediated IFN response is also negatively regulated
  by autophagic degradation or ATGs (including ULK1, BECN1, and ATG9a). AMPK AMP-activated
