caption: Regulation of Cbk1 and Ace2 in mitosis integrates signals from FEAR and MEN
  to ensure the proper timing of septum destruction. (A) In early anaphase, Mob2/Cbk1
  and Ace2 are inhibited by mitotic CDK phosphorylation. Activation of the FEAR pathway
  triggers activation of the RAM network, leading to phosphorylation of Cbk1 at the
  HM site. Upon MEN activation in late anaphase/telophase, Cdc14 is released to the
  cytoplasm, where it dephosphorylates and activates Cbk1 and removes inhibitory phosphates
  on Ace2. Active Cbk1 phosphorylates the NES of Ace2, trapping Ace2 in the nucleus,
  where it drives transcription of the enzymes required for septum degradation. (B)
  Simultaneous activation of Cbk1 and Ace2 by Cdc14 constitutes a coherent feed-forward
  loop to activate the transcription of cell separation enzymes. Dephosphorylation
  of both Cbk1 and Ace2 by Cdc14 and activation of Ace2 by Cbk1 create a regulatory
  organization that may delay the output of Ace2 target gene activation.
