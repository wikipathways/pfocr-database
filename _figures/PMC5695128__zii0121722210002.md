caption: 'Chemical signaling by Epi/NE, AI-3, fucose, and ethanolamine (EA) in EHEC
  interacts with transmembrane sensor kinase receptors and activates a TCS via response
  regulators, which may activate or repress the signal transduction. The QseC sensor
  kinase has a central role in the activation of the QseB response regulator by Epi,
  NE, or AI-3; QseB regulates the expression of flagella and represses the expression
  of fusK/-R. QseC can also phosphorylate KdpE, which together with Cra, activates
  the pathway responsible for LEE activation. QseC also may activate the response
  regulator QseF, which stimulates the production of Shiga toxin, but it is able to
  repress the expression of fusK/-R. The cognate sensor FusK is activated by fucose
  and phosphorylates FusR to inhibit LEE expression (, , , ). The regulation of the
  eut operon is also implicated: eut encodes the EutR transcription factor, which
  recognizes the presence of ethanolamine (EA) and vitamin B12 to modulate virulence
  gene expression. EutR can bind in the LEE in the absence of EA or B12, but transcription
  occurs only in the presence of both. In the presence of EA and B12, eut expression
  promotes EA metabolism, providing an advantage in the competition for nutrients,
  and also promotes host colonization ().'
