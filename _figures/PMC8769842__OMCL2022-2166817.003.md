caption: (1) NF-κB signalling pathway. First, ROS/RNS regulates NF-κB activity, including
  activating the NF-κB signalling pathway and promoting inflammatory gene transcription.
  In addition, ROS/RNS plays an indispensable role in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
  and its oxidation of TRX causes TRX-interacting protein to bind to NLRP3, eventually
  producing IL-β. (2) MAPK signalling pathway. ROS/RNS triggers oxidation of TRX-interacting
  protein, leading to apoptosis signal-regulating kinase dissociation and activation
  of JNK and p38 pathways through multimerization of the apoptosis signal-regulating
  kinase, and activates the ERK1/2 pathway. Ultimately, ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 promote
  gene transcription, ultimately inducing IL-β production.
