caption: Mechanisms of homologous recombination. A and B Double-strand break repair;
  C. Double-strand end repair. A. Double Holliday junction recombinational double-strand
  break repair. At the break (a), 5′ ends are resected (b) to leave 3′ overhanging
  tails (half arrow heads). These are coated with RecA/Rad51 that catalyzes invasion
  by one or both ends into homologous sequence forming a D-loop (c). The 3′ end then
  primes DNA synthesis (dotted lines) that extends it past the position of the original
  break (d). The second end is incorporated into the D-loop by annealing, and is also
  extended (e). Following ligation, which forms a double Holliday junction (f), the
  junctions are resolved by endonuclease (g). The overall effect will be either a
  non-crossover or a crossover, depending upon whether the two junctions are resolved
  in the same or different orientations. An alternative resolution pathway is mediated
  by a helicase and a topoisomerase to converge and undo the double Holliday junction
  generating only a non-crossover outcome (h). B. Synthesis-dependent strand annealing
  follows the same pathway as in A through polymerase extension (d). At this point
  the invading end, together with the newly synthesized DNA is separated from the
  template by a helicase (e). It now encounters the second end from the double-strand
  break, and anneals with it by complementary base pairing (f) (dotted arrow). The
  second end is extended by DNA synthesis (g), and ligated, thus completing repair.
  C. Break -induced replication occurs at collapsed (broken) replication forks that
  occur when the replicative helicase at a replication fork encounters a nick in a
  template strand (solid arrowhead) (a and b). Break induced replication can be understood
  as a modification of SDSA. As before, a 3′ tail invades a homologue (d), usually
  the sister from which it broke, and is extended by low processivity polymerization
  that includes both leading and lagging strands (e). However, the separated extended
  3′ end fails to find a complementary second end to which to anneal (f). The end
  then reinvades (g), and is extended further by a low processivity replication fork.
  This process of invasion, extension and separation might be repeated several times
  until a more processive replication fork is formed (h). The fork can now complete
  replication to the end of the molecule (i). In (g) and (h) we show the Holliday
  junction following the replication fork, giving conservative segregation of old
  and new DNA. It is also possible that the Holliday junction is cleaved by an endonuclease,
  in which case segregation will be semi-conservative. In all parts of the figure,
  each line shows a single nucleotide chain. Polarity is indicated by half arrows
  on 3′ ends. New synthesis is shown by dotted lines. The broken DNA molecule is shown
  in red, a homologue or sister molecule is shown in green.
