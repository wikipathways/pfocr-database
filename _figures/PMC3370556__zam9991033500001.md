caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway for alanine. Endogenous gapA, pyk, pfk, and pgi genes
  (in black boxes) were chromosomally integrated. Alanine dehydrogenase gene, alaD,
  from L. sphaericus was overexpressed via expression plasmid (white box). The genes
  ldhA and ppc were deleted (crossed bars) from chromosomal DNA of C. glutamicum.
  Relevant reactions are represented by the names of the genes coding for the enzymes
  as follows: pts, phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system; glk,
  glucokinase; pgi, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; pfk, phosphofructokinase; ald,
  fructose-1,6-biphosphate aldolase; gapA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;

  mutase; eno, enolase; pyk, pyruvate kinase; alaD, alanine dehydrogenase; ldhA, lactate
