caption: Pathways and protein–protein interaction network analysis of downregulated
  differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in LMC. (A) KEGG pathway analysis of the
  LMC-specific downregulated DEPs. (B) The LMC-specific downregulated DEPs in the
  protein–protein interaction networks are shown as nodes (MS data presented as 128/130
  ratios were matched to STRING networks). The depth of the green color indicates
  the ratio of protein abundance in LMC/LNMC. (C) The downregulated hub genes identified
  by the MCODE plug-in. (D) Functional analysis of the seven hub DEPs using the ClueGO
  plug-in by Cytoscape.
