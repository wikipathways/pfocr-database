caption: Significant pathway nodes are shaded according to size of fold change (red
  >1; green <1), with white nodes indicating genes that were not detected in the samples
  and gray indicating genes that were detected, but not significant. Nodes with multicolor
  gradients denote nodes with significant genes with fold changes in different directions
  (see  for more details). Fold change is defined as KO/CTL (RNA-Seq) or IP/CTL (RIP-Seq).
  Colored double borders indicate that the molecule is a complex.
