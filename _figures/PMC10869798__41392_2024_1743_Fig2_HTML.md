caption: Microglial activation and neurodegeneration. Aging induces microglial activation
  by activating the cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes
  (STING) signaling pathway. Misfolded proteins and protein aggregates induce microglial
  activation by impairing microglial autophagy. Stage-1 DAM represents a transitory
  and functional subtype with a higher capacity of phagocytosis initiated by a TREM2-independent
  mechanism, whereas stage-2 DAM represents a dysfunctional state initiated by a TREM2-dependent
  mechanism. The microglial spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) signaling provides metabolic
  support to facilitate microglial transition into stage-2 DAM. Maladaptive microglial-T-cell
  signaling drives neurodegeneration by releasing neurotoxic factors. Microglial activation
  creates a feed-forward vicious cycle that aggravates neurodegeneration as activated
  microglia contribute to the propagation of protein aggregates into unaffected brain
  regions. This figure was created with BioRender (https://biorender.com/)
