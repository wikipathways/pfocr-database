caption: In the allergic sensitization phase, environmental or mechanical triggers
  (or both) may induce skin keratinocytes to produce thymic stromal lymphopoietin
  (TSLP), which recruits and activates dendritic cells (DCs) or basophils. Injured
  epithelial cells may also release interleukin-33 (IL-33) to activate ST2-expressing
  skin DCs. TSLP-activated DCs migrate to draining lymph nodes to induce naïve CD4
  +T cells to differentiate into CD4 +TH2 cells and maintain CD4 +TH2 effector/memory
  pools. In the allergy propagation phase, these CD4 +TH2 cells migrate to the intestine
  and interact with resident type-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) to produce large
  amounts of IL-13 in response to intestinal IL-25 stimulation. In the amplification-of-mastocytosis
  phase, IL-4 signals provided by CD4 +TH2 cells induce emigrated mast cell progenitors
  (MCPs) to become multi-functional IL-9-producing mucosal mast cells (MMC9s), which
  then expand greatly after ingested antigens cross-link with MMC9 surface IgE/FcεR
  complex. The inflammatory cytokine IL-33 enhances IL-9 production by MMC9s, resulting
  in MMC9 maturation and the amplification of intestinal mastocytosis in an autocrine
  loop. Thus, MMC9 induction may serve as a key cellular checkpoint to amplify and
  propagate allergic inflammation, resulting in the development of IgE-mediated food
  allergy. MMC, mucosal mast cell; STAT6, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  6; TH2, T helper type 2 cell.
