caption: If the system is dysbalanced this may result in a rising formation of Ang
  II and a higher renin synthesis which at least increases inflammatory responses.
  This is important in cases of a poor vitamin D status because vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D)
  can counteract the disbalance via negative expression of the renin gen which results
  in lower renin synthesis independent from Ang II. An increase of aldosterone will
  block the activities of the ACE2 and as a consequence attenuate the counter regulatory
  balance. If the counter regulatory circle is disrupted via ACE2 dysfunction due
  to SARS-CoV2 infection an uncontrolled classical pathway will run out of control
  and increase proinflammatory reactions and blood pressure and contribute to a couple
  of problems (e.g. cardiovascular, ARDS, Kawasaki disease). Ang II activates NFκB
  through AT1 receptors []. This and further interactions of the RAS with inflammatory
  stimuli results in an increasing and less controlled inflammatory reaction. Beside
  its effect on renin expression vitamin D can effectively inhibit NFκB activation
  []. This is especially efficient when the VDR is upregulated, which also plays an
  important role in other processes in the immune system through vitamin D activity.
