caption: Possible pro-oncogenic effect of tirzepatide (TRZD) on the pancreas, breast,
  colorectal, and liver cancers. TRZD, possibly via GLP-1R or GIPR activation, leads
  to intracellular Ca2+-dependent release of insulin from the pancreatic β-cells.
  The GLP-1R activation can also lead to protein kinase A-dependent gene transcription
  leading to the synthesis and release of insulin-like growth factor 1 or 2 (IGF 1/2)
  and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGF-BP3). Insulin and IGF 1/2
  via the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF receptor 1 (IGF-1R) in turn activate the
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Ras-Raf-ERK, MAPK, and JAK-STAT pathway, which supports several oncogenic
  and cancer progression traits such as resisting cell death, induction of angiogenesis,
  sustained proliferative signals, tumor inflammation, and activation of invasion
  and metastasis in target tissues (pancreas, breast, colorectum and liver). The black
  arrows indicate the pathway and flow of components involved in the pathway. The
  green upward arrow indicates an increase, while the red downward arrow indicates
  a decrease. Created with Biorender.com (accessed on 15 September 2022).
