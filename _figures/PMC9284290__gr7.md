caption: Putative cuticle pathway predicted in V. darrowii based on transcriptome
  expression data.The genes in this pathway were identified based on BLASTP alignment
  with corresponding Arabidopsis amino acid sequences. Transcript levels from RNA-seq
  data are visualized as heatmaps and normalized with log2(TPM + 1).
