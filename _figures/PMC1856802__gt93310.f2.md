caption: 'The Wnt pathway in the “off and on” states. Off: signalling is kept in an
  off state either in the absence of Wnt or when Wnt factors are prevented to bind
  to the membrane‐bound receptors Frizzled (Frz) and coreceptors low‐density lipoprotein
  receptor‐related protein (LRP). This is achieved either by the extracellular Wnt‐titrating
  inhibitors SFRPs (secreted Frz‐related peptides), WIF‐1 (Wnt inhibitory factor‐1)
  and Cerberus‐1(CER1), or by specific members of the Dickkopf (Dkk) family that stimulate
  the Kremen‐dependent endocytosis of LRP. In the cytoplasm, β‐catenin is tagged by
  phosphorylation (P) in the destruction complex containing the core components adenomatous
  polyposis coli (APC), axin/conductin and the kinases casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). β‐Transducin repeat‐containing protein (βTrCP) targets
  phosphorylated β‐catenin to the proteasome where it is degraded. In the nucleus,
  the Wnt target genes are kept silent by the repressor Groucho interacting with DNA‐bound
  T cell factor (TCF). APC is thought to actively export β‐catenin. The inhibitors,
  inhibitor of β‐catenin (ICAT) and Chibby, can also repress β‐catenin activity in
  the nucleus. The occupancy of Frz and LRP by Wnt triggers the phosphorylation of
  the cytoplasmic tail of LRP by CK1 and GSK3β and the dishevelled (Dsh)‐dependent
  recruitment of axin on to phosphorylated LRP. In the nucleus, transcription of Wnt
  target genes is initiated by the displacement of Groucho, the interaction of β‐catenin
  with TCF and the recruitment of B cell lymphoma 9 (Bcl9), Pygopus, the mixed‐lineage
  leukaemia (MLL) methyltransferases, APC, C‐terminal‐binding protein (CtBP) and βTrCP.'
