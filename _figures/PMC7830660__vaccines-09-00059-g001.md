caption: Immune evasion by NSVs. The IFN response is the primary antiviral pathway
  activated following virus infection. NSVs are detected by intracellular PRRs such
  as RIG-1 and mda5 in the cytoplasm or TLR3/7/8 in the endosomal compartment via
  interactions with viral RNA []. Signalling cascades involving MAVS (for RIG-I and
  mda5) or TRIF/MyD88 (for TLRs) result in the activation of the kinases IKKα/β/ε
  and TBK1 that subsequently activate the latent transcription factors IRF3, IRF7,
  and NFκB via phosphorylation []. These transcription factors promote the expression
  and secretion of proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, and IFNα/β)
  []. IFNs signal in an autocrine and paracrine manner by binding to the IFNα/β receptor
  (IFNAR), resulting in the activation of the ISGF3 complex (STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9)
  through phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 by IFNAR-associated kinases JAK1 and
  TYK2 []. ISGF3 then promotes the expression of antiviral genes []. Innate and adaptive
  immune cells, as well as inflammation and autophagy, which additionally contribute
  to viral clearance, are also depicted. Targeting of the antiviral immune response
  by NSVs, and the viral proteins involved if known, are indicated [,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,].
