caption: The mechanisms involved in DNA damage repair that cause radiation tolerance
  in cervical cancer (A) MTDH gene knockout decreased the expression of Ku70 and Bcl2
  and enhanced the radiosensitivity of NHEJ. (B) After the overexpression of hNF1α
  bound to YTHDF3, YTHDF3 enhanced the radiation resistance of cervical cancer by
  increasing the expression of RAD51D in an m6A-dependent manner and thereby involved
  in DNA damage repair through the HR pathway. (C) NEK2 activates WNT/β-catenin signaling
  pathway by up-regulating WNT1 to enhance HR repair and promote radiation resistance.
  (D) PIK3CA-E545K negatively regulates SIRT4 expression by regulating the downstream
  effector P300 level, while SIRT4 inhibition leads to up-regulation of GPT1 expression,
  which enhances glutamine uptake and utilization, and ultimately promotes DNA damage
  repair. (E) The transcription factor HMGB3 binds to the hTERT promoter region and
  upregulates the expression of hTERT at the transcriptional level, which activates
  the DNA damage repair signaling pathway and promotes the radiation resistance of
  cervical cancer. (F) TRIP4 promotes radiation resistance of cervical cancer by targeting
  hTERT signal transduction and activating DNA damage repair signaling pathway by
  regulating its binding to the hTERT promoter.
