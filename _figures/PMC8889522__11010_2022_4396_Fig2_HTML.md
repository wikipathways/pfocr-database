caption: Pathogenesis of Covid-19 in heart and β-cells through ACE-2 receptor in diabetic
  patients. ACE receptor converts Ang-I to Ang-II, which has detrimental effects through
  the RAS pathway, thereby increasing systemic oxidative stress and apoptosis leading
  to decrease in proliferation and insulin secretion by β-cells along with an increase
  in the risk of cardiovascular complications. Whereas, ACE-2 receptor has protective
  effect on β-cells by converting the Ang-II to Ang-(1–7) which through Mas receptor
  stimulates vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic signaling and decreases
  oxidative stress, provides antiviral defences, increases β-cell proliferation and
  insulin secretion. However, Covid-19 infection reduces ACE-2 receptors on the cell
  surface by directly binding ACE-2 and its endocytosis, which releases suppression
  of RAS and in turn further reduces ACE-2 expression. Further, the cytokine storm
  caused due to the hyper-inflammation of the Covid-19 infection release the pro-inflammatory
  cytokines that activate ADAM-17 and cleave the ACE-2 receptors from the membrane
  surface. The cytokine storm along with the immune cell imbalance not only adversely
  affects the cardiac tissue and β-cells but it will cause organ dysfunction at systemic
  level
