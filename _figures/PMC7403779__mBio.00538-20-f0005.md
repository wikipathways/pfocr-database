caption: Loss of cell pole stabilization by TipN sensitizes cells to vancomycin- and
  detergent-induced cell wall stress. (A) Summary graphical model of the relative
  effects of loss of TipN and/or ChvT on sensitivity to vancomycin and sodium deoxycholate
  in Caulobacter crescentus. The physical interaction between TipN and the Tol-Pal
  complex is known from previous work (). For the purposes of this figure, ChvT is
  illustrated at the lateral side of the cell, but it is likely to be distributed
  in multiple locations around the outer membrane (). (B) The ChvIG-ChvR-ChvT signaling
  pathway of C. crescentus and its response to cell envelope stress. The biochemical
  details of the ChvR-chvT interaction and its dependence on ChvIG induced transcription
  of ChvR were characterized by Fröhlich et al. ().
