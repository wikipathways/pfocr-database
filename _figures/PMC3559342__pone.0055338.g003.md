caption: Highest confidence network of genes displaying altered expression levels
  in response to secreted sLF in HEK293 cells. According to IPA, the network is relevant
  to ‘Genetic Disorder, Hematological Disease, Metabolic Disease’. Genes that were
  upregulated are presented in red, whereas those that were downregulated are presented
  in green, where the intensity of the color reflects the magnitude of the expression
  change, as indicated in the scale bar. Each interaction is supported by at least
  one literature reference, with solid lines representing direct interactions and
  dashed lines representing indirect interactions.
