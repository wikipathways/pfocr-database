caption: Activated Signaling Pathways in Endometrial Cancer Stem Cells and possible
  Target Sites. Activated Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling leads to the expression of stemness
  genes Oct-4, Sox-2 and Nanog as well as activates NF-κB. NF-κB is also activated
  by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, whose activation is mediated by tyrosine receptor
  kinases like HER2 and leads to the expression of genes like c-Myc and Snail. Another
  receptor contributing to cancer stem cell characteristics is Notch. Possible target
  sites affecting these pathways as well as stemness, resistance and invasiveness
  of CSCs are pictured in the black boxes. PI3K = phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; HER2
  = human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; EGF = epidermal growth factor; ECM =
  extracellular matrix; mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin.
