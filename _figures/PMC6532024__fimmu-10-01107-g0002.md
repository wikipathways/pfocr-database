caption: 'Receptor signaling pathways upstream of TRAF6. (A) TLR/IL-1 family pathways.
  Receptor–ligand bindings cause the association between IRAK4/1 and TRAF6 and subsequent
  activation of TRAF6 in a MyD88-dependent manner. TRAF6 E3 activity mediates K63-linked
  ubiquitination of IRAK1, NEMO/IKKγ, and TRAF6 itself, resulting in the activation
  of NF-κB and MAPKs. (B) An NLR pathway. The binding of bacterial MDP or viral RNAs
  to NOD2 results in the association between RIPK2 and TRAF6, and subsequent activation
  of TRAF6. K63-linked ubiquitination of RIPK2 is expected to be mediated by another
  E3 ligase XIAP. (C) An RLR pathway. The binding of viral RNAs to RIG-I or MDA5 mediates
  MAVS polymerization at mitochondria and subsequent binding and activation of TRAF6.
  mtROS is also involved in the MAVS polymerization. TLR signaling mediates mtROS
  production via TRAF6 mitochondrial translocation and subsequent binding and polyubiquitination
  of ECSIT. (D) CBM signalosome complex-dependent pathways. The formation of a CBM
  complex is triggered by activation of CARD proteins: CARD11 (CARMA1) in the TCR/BCR
  pathway in T/B cells, respectively; CARD9 in the CLR pathway in DCs; and CARD14/CARMA2
  in keratinocytes although its upstream receptor remains unidentified. TRAF6 is associated
  with the CBM complex, and TRAF6 E3 ligase activity mediates K63-linked ubiquitination
  of MALT1, NEMO/IKKγ, and TRAF6 itself. (E) An IL-17 pathway. The ligation of IL-17
  cytokines to IL-17R recruits ACT1, which bridges the IL-17R and TRAF6 and promotes
  the E3 ligase activity of TRAF6. ACT1 also associates with BAFFR in B and T cells
  and CD40 in B cells and phagocytes, and is expected to regulate these receptor signaling
  pathways. (F) Other TRAF6-dependent pathways. A CD40 pathway in B cells, phagocytes
  and other cells; an OX40 pathway in T cells; a RANKL pathway in osteoclasts; and
  a TGFβRI pathway in various cells. ACT1, NF-κB activator 1; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating
  kinase 1; BCL10, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10; CARD, caspase recruitment domain-containing
