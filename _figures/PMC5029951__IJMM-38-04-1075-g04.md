caption: Diagram of novel molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-senescent effect
  of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in H2O2-exposed human mesenchymal stem cells
  (hMSCs). EGCG prevents H2O2-induced oxidative stress by upregulating nuclear factor-erythroid
  2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and downregulating the p53/p21 signaling pathway. Nrf2
  activation by EGCG pre-treatment suppresses H2O2-induced cellular senescence and
  the expression of acetyl-p53 and p21 in hMSCs, which suggests a potential role for
  Nrf2 in p53/p21 regulation to thereby prevent oxidative stress-induced cellular
  senescence in hMSCs.
