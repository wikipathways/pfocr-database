caption: Model Integrating the Roles of the Different BAM Proteins into the Pathway
  of Starch Degradation.This model places BAM3 at the heart of starch degradation.
  BAM1 plays an overlapping role with BAM3. Our data indicate that additional α- or
  β-amylases may also contribute to starch degradation. Linear malto-oligosaccharides
  released by the combination of α-amylase and the debranching enzymes ISA3 and LDA
  (), or through the action of disproportionating enzyme (D-enzyme DPE1; ), may also
  provide substrates for the β-amylases. The model proposes that BAM4 acts in a regulatory
  capacity, upstream of BAM1 and BAM3. A possible target area for regulation could
  be the process of glucan phosphorylation, mediated by glucan, water dikinase (GWD;
  ) and phosphoglucan, water dikinase (PWD; ; ). GWD activity, like that of BAM1,
  is reported to be redox-regulated (; ). We speculate that maltose levels might modulate
  the action of BAM4, although this remains to be tested experimentally.
