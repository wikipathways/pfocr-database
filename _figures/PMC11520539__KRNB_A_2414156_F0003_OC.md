caption: The diagram illustrates the immune exchange pathway mediated by ADAR1, a
  dsRNA A-to-I editing transformation modulating enzyme. In blast crisis CML, progenitors
  exhibit elevated levels of IFNγR1 and IL-3 Rα that can be activated by the JAK2
  signalling pathway. Furthermore, the JAK2/STAT signalling pathway enhances ADAR1-mediated
  dsRNA editing. Amplification of BCR-ABL1 serves as a biomarker for blast crisis
  transformation simulating JAK2 activation, promoting self-renewal of progenitors
  through upregulation of LIN28B expression while impairing let-7 miRNA biogenesis.
  There exists a mechanistic relationship between oncogenic signalling pathways driven
  by inflammatory cytokines and malignant reprogramming of progenitors driven by dsRNA
  editing
