caption: 'Potential mechanisms linking lipid rafts to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.In
  this scenario, SARS-CoV-2 may enter target cells via binding of ACE2, which is located
  in lipid rafts, or via caveolae-mediated endocytosis, which also occurs in raft
  compartments of the plasma membrane. The lipid and protein composition of rafts
  is critical for the subsequent transport of viruses to endosomes and lysosomes.
  The raft-associated protein cav-1 can inhibit eNOS in endothelial cells and the
  subsequent production of NO, which plays an important role in inflammation. Lipid
  rafts and cholesterol in the endosomal membrane may enhance TLR7 activity and promote
  nuclear translocation of NF-kB via the MYD88 pathway. This event leads to transcription
  of genes encoding the pro-inflammatory cytokines pro-IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Importantly,
  cav-1 may bind miR-138, which suppresses the NF-kB-mediated pathway. Moreover, lipid
  rafts in the mitochondrial membrane may contribute to autophagy and oxidative stress,
  both of which occur in infected cells. Lipid rafts in the plasma membrane of immune
  cells also harbor important protein complexes involved in the immune response, such
  as receptors for pathogens, antigens or cytokines or costimulatory molecules. Rafts
  also regulate the activity of TACE, a transmembrane enzyme that generates truncated
  forms of cytokine receptors. Cholesterol depletion in the immune synapse may profoundly
  alter the ability of cells to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection and promote the improper
  generation of a dysfunctional immune response, characteristics of the most severe
  outcomes of COVID-19.Abbreviations: ACE2: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; BCR:
