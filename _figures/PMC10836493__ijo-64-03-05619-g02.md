caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism by which GPX3 is involved in maintaining
  the stemness of OCSCs in the TME. (A) GPX3 is implicated in signaling pathways that
  are pertinent to the initiation and progression of cancer. Additionally, GPX3 plays
  a protective role in ovarian cancer cells by mitigating the detrimental effects
  of exogenous oxidant damage through the scavenging of ROS. (B) Ovarian cancer cells
  establish interactions with the peritoneal mesothelium by means of specific markers,
  which are recognized by HA receptors located on the mesothelial membrane. This recognition
  leads to the adhesion of the cancer cells to the mesothelium, promoting tumor cell
  metastasis. (C) GPX3 can support the survival of OCSCs within the intricate TME
  by protecting them from cell death induced by iron transport through the provision
  of exogenous fatty acids such as palmitoleic and oleic acids. Additionally, the
  self-renewal capacity of OCSCs is influenced by the degree of unsaturated fatty
  acids, which modulate their stemness via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (D)
  Ascites from patients with ovarian cancer induce the differentiation of monocytes
  into TAMs through the action of LIF and IL-6 factors, which stimulate the release
  of EGF, which in turn activates the EGFR-ERK pathway. Activation of this pathway
  leads to the upregulation of VEGF, which promotes angiogenesis and maintains the
  stemness of OCSCs. ROS, reactive oxygen species; mRNA, messenger RNA; GPX3, glutathione
