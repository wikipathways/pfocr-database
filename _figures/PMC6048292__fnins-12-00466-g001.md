caption: Ferroptosis and its molecular regulation by Nrf2. Glutathione peroxidase
  4 (Gpx4) utilizes the major cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) as a substrate
  to reduce lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH). Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) generated by
  Gpx4 is reduced back to glutathione by glutathione reductase (GR) in a reaction
  requiring NADPH, which can be regenerated by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
  and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) of the pentose-phosphate pathway, and malic
  enzyme (ME). The tripeptide glutathione is synthesized by the consecutive action
  of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) and glutathione synthetase (GSS), where the ligation
  of cysteine (Cys) and glutamate (Glu) by glutamate-cysteine ligase is the rate-limiting
  step of glutathione synthesis. The cellular import of cystine by the glutamate-cystine
  antiporter system xc- constitutes an significant route of cysteine supply for glutathione
  synthesis. Cysteine is also required for other important cellular antioxidants including
  thioredoxin (Trx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Ferroptosis occurs when the
  Gpx4-catalyzed reduction of lipid hydroperoxides is insufficient to prevent the
  iron-mediated generation of lipid radicals (LO∙). This leads to the propagation
  of lipid peroxidation and culminates in ferroptosis. Ferroptosis can be experimentally
  induced by inhibiting Gpx4 via the small molecule inhibitor RSL3, or by limiting
  glutathione supply to Gpx4. The latter is induced by direct [e.g., buthionine sulfoximine
  (BSO)] or indirect (e.g., by limiting cysteine availability) inhibition of glutathione
  synthesis. Cysteine supply is disrupted by inhibitors of system xc- including erastin,
  sulfasalazine, and sorafenib. Ferroptosis can also be inhibited by iron chelators
  such as deferoxamine and deferiprone, and lipid radical scavengers such as ferrostatin-1,
  liproxstatin-1, and vitamin E. Factors transcriptionally regulated by Nrf2 are indicated
  in blue italics, whereas factors promoting ferroptosis are indicated in red. Clearly
  Nrf2 signaling is likely to have an integral and pervasive impact on the manifestation
  of ferroptosis.
