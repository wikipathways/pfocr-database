caption: Intermittent activation of rat RVLM mimics AIH, mediated by PACAP in a cAMP-dependent
  manner. (A) Intermittent injections of 5 nmol glutamate in the RVLM cause a persistent
  increase in sympathetic nerve activity, which does not occur after intermittent
  injection of the vehicle control, PBS. The sympathetic response following intermittent
  glutamate injections is abolished by prior intrathecal infusion of the PACAP antagonist,
  10 nmol PACAP(6–38). (B) An illustration of the intracellular signaling pathway
  used by PACAP. When PACAP binds to the PAC1 G-protein coupled receptor, the α-subunit
  of the G-protein is phosphorylated (“P”), adenylyl cyclase is then activated causing
  the conversion of ATP into cAMP. cAMP acts at 3 downstream effector proteins, Protein
  Kinase A (PKA), Exchange Protein Activated by cAMP (EPAC) and hyperpolarization-activated
  cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. The activity of cAMP can be blocked by using
  a cocktail of 1μmol Rp-Diastereomer of Adenosine 3′,5-Cyclic Monophosphorothioate
  (Rp-cAMP), 10 nmol Brefeldin A (BFA) and 30 nmol 4-(N-Ethyl-N-phenylamino)-1,2 dimethyl-6-(methylamino)pyrimidium
  chloride (ZD-7288) to block the three downstream effector proteins. (C) When PKA
  alone is blocked using 1 μmol Rp-cAMP (small box in B) there is no significant reduction
  in the response to AIH. When cAMP is blocked with 1 μmol Rp-cAMP, 10 nmol BFA and
  30 nmol ZD-7288 (large box in B), the sympathetic response to AIH is abolished.
