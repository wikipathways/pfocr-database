caption: Cellular oxidative and genotoxic stress responses converge on the AMPK/mTORC1
  pathway. A major pathway regulating cellular homeostasis decisions after various
  stress situations involves the mTORC1 complex. Activation of the ATM kinase in the
  cytoplasm in response to oxidative stress leads to phosphorylation of the LKB1 tumor
  suppressor protein and engagement of the AMPK pathway. AMPK in turn activates the
  TSC2 protein and thereby negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling, thus inhibiting
  cell growth while promoting autophagy (). AMPK also inhibits mTORC1 by phosphorylating
  the raptor protein. This cytoplasm-derived AMPK-mTORC1 response does not require
  p53 function. Activation of ATM in response to genotoxic stress also engages the
  AMPK pathway, although this activation is p53-dependent and redox-independent and
  is mediated by the p53-regulated sestrins 1/2, but again results in the inhibition
  of mTORC1 (, ,). AMPK also regulates cytoplasmic stress granule formation after
  oxidative stress (). AMPK = AMP-activated protein kinase; ATM = ataxia-telangiectasia
  mutated; LKB1 = liver kinase B1; mTORC1 = mammalian target of rapamycin complex
  1; TSC1/2 = tuberous sclerosis complex 1, 2; DSB = DNA double-strand break; Rheb
  = Ras homolog enriched in brain; raptor = regulatory-associated protein of mTOR.
