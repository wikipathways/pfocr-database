caption: 'Model for the role of hnRNP H/F in regulating mRNA translation in GBM. Increased
  expression of hnRNP H/F in GBM [] indirectly (i) and/or directly (ii) regulates
  mRNA translation through different overlapping mechanisms, including: (i) A-Raf
  mRNA splicing that in turn modulates the MEK-ERK/MAPK pathway to control the phosphorylation
  of eIF4E (this work) known to impact on translation, and (ii) the direct involvement
  of hnRNP H/F in translation of specific mRNAs []. The underlying regulatory mechanisms
  involve modulation of RG4 folding by hnRNP H/F and result in both global and selective
  control of translation impacting key functional cellular pathways, such as cell
  migration, proliferation and DNA repair, involved in GBM tumor growth and resistance
  to treatments.'
