caption: Intervention of natural products from traditional Chinese medicine on the
  TME. Curcumin inhibits VEGF, IL-6 and cancer stem cells in vivo and in vitro. Ginsenoside
  Rh2 (G-Rh2) can regulate the phenotype of TAMs to improve the TME. Dihydrodiosgenin
  (DYDIO) can inhibit platelet activation and reduce endothelial cell-derived factor
  VIII (FVIII). Cordycepin can target CSCs and upregulate the apoptosis of cancer
  cells. Shikonin reduces cancer-derived exosomes to inhibit the spread of breast
  cancer cell lines. Wogonin inhibits the transformation of EMT into the epithelial
  stroma by interfering with the IL-6/STAT3 signalling pathway. Sophoridine can inhibit
  macrophage-mediated immunosuppression through the TLR4/IRF3 pathway and then upregulate
  the killing effect of CD8+ T cells on gastric cancer. Salvianolic acid A can block
  the secretion of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and inhibit angiogenesis.
  Triptolide (TP) inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells. Berberine can mediate
  the transforming growth factor-β signalling pathway, thus inhibiting EMT and promoting
  apoptosis
