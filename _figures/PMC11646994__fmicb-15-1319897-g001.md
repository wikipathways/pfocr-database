caption: Downstream signaling events in opioid-related liver toxicity. First of all,
  it should be stressed that fentanyl contextually impacts on three levels, which
  are intertwined and bidirectional, i.e., CNS, gut flora, and liver. The complex
  ecosystem known as the gut microbiota, encompassing bacteria, viruses, and fungi
  living in the gastrointestinal system, plays a fundamental role in the control of
  the host energy metabolism. The liver–gut axis, mediated by intestinal microbiota,
  could be the link between co-existing liver disease, such as NAFLD and ALD, and
  the drug addiction. Acetaldehyde, a major toxic metabolite, is one of the principal
  culprits mediating fibrogenic of alcohol in the liver. Mechanistically, acetaldehyde
  promotes adduct formation, leading to functional impairments of key proteins, including
  enzymes. Indeed, gut microbiota of individuals with NAFLD produce enough ethanol
  to be a driving force in the development and progression of this disease. Gut microbial
  dysbioses are linked to aberrant immune responses, which are often accompanied by
  abnormal production of inflammatory cytokines (Il-6 and Il-17). The toxicity of
  opioids could be mediated also by CYP3A4, key enzyme involved in the fentanyl metabolism.
  MCH, a neuropeptide primarily transcribed in the lateral hypothalamus, displays
  multiple functions, mostly controlling feeding behavior and energy homeostasis and
  regulating the stress axis and emotion. MCH signaling pathway is a potential target
  to treat obesity, and also anxiety and depression that are at the basis of addiction.
  NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; ALD, alcoholic liver disease; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; TRL, toll-like receptor; IL, interleukin; CYP, cytochrome P450 enzyme;
  SNC, central nervous system; MCH, melanin-concentrating hormone
