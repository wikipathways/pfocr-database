caption: Effects of N starvation and disruption of cyto-nuclear coadaptation on allantoin
  synthesis and degradation. Simplified pathway of allantoin biosynthesis and degradation
  []. The symbols indicate the results of the ANOVA tests. Squares are for DEGs, circles
  for differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs); grey, not significant; green,
  responsive to N starvation; yellow, responsive to disruption of cytonuclear coadaptation;
  orange, significant Cyt × Nuc × N interaction; the direction of the arrow indicates
  the direction of the effect. None of the other metabolites was quantified. None
  of the quantified proteins was affected by the relevant effects.
