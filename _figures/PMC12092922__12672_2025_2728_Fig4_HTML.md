caption: MXRAs is involved in chemotherapy resistance. MXRA2, by disrupting adhesion
  signaling in tumors, leads to chemotherapy drug resistance; conversely, MXRA3 downregulation
  increases chemotherapy drug sensitivity through altered microtubule dynamics. Furthermore,
  MXRA4 inhibition enhances drug delivery by normalizing tumor vessels, improving
  the response to chemotherapy drugs. In tumors, MXRA7 influences chemotherapy drug-induced
  apoptosis via the caspase pathway, while MXRA8 inhibition sensitizes tumor cells
  to chemotherapy drug treatment
