caption: The crosstalk between tumor cells and non-immune stromal cells and the TME
  conditions. Cellular interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding microenvironment
  influence tumor initiation, malignant progression, therapy resistance, and metastasis.
  This figure focuses on the heterogeneity of non-immune stromal cells and biochemical
  interactions. Fibroblasts have several key subtypes that interact with tumor cells,
  CSCs, and other stromal cells differentially. By secreting TGF-β and IL-1α, the
  tumor regulates CAF precursors’ differentiation into myofibroblastic CAFs and inflammatory
  CAFs, respectively. In addition to promoting tumor cell invasion, myofibroblastic
  CAFs contribute to immunosuppression by elevating OX40L and PD-L2 expression in
  CD4+ T cells and promoting differentiation of FoxP3+regulatory T cells (Treg). In
  contrast, inflammatory CAFs induced by LIF-JAK/STAT signaling recruit myeloid cells
  and Treg. By secreting IL-6/8, CD10+CPR77+ CAFs generated by a self-reinforced C5a
  and NF-kB loop promote stemness and chemoresistance of CSCs. Ptgs2+ fibroblasts
  secrete metabolites, such as PGE2, induce the expansion of Sca1+ quiescent stem
  cells and tumor initiation through the Hippo-YAP pathway. Endothelial cells have
  more than 30 different states based on expression profiling. The tip and breach
  subtypes are predictive of poor prognosis and sensitive to VEGF-A blockade. Endothelial
  cells and CSCs form a feedback VEGF-A-Jagged1 loop through Notch signaling. The
  ECM produced by fibroblasts, tumor cells, and other stromal cells, provides the
  framework of the TME. CAFs and tumor cells secrete MMPs, such as MMP-2/9, to remodel
  the ECM. Some specific ECM proteins, including periostin, type I collagen, laminin-332,
  the 200 kDa hyaluronic acid (HA), and tenascin C (TNC), maintain and promote CSC
  phenotypes through activating various signaling pathways, such as Wnt, integrin/focal
  adhesion kinase (FAK), and NF-kB pathways.
