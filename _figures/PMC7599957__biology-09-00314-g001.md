caption: Network diagram of the model. The systems biology graphical notation network
  (SBGN) diagram comprises of key elements of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway,
  and includes reactions which represent the synthesis, degradation, and regulation
  of hepatic LDL receptors (LDLrs). Finally, it incorporates reactions which depict
  the effects of aging on cholesterol homeostasis. Round arrow heads represent the
  target of a catalytic enzyme. Arrows represent flux. The mathematical symbol for
  an empty set represents a synthesis or sink reaction. All of these reactions are
  described in detail in the main body of the text. Hatched process nodes represent
  omitted processes.
