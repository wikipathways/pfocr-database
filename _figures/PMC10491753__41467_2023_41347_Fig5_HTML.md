caption: a Multiple nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD+/NADH or nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate NADP + /NADPH-dependent metabolic reactions are present in
  the cytosol or compartmentalized within organelles, such as peroxisomes (P) and
  mitochondria (M). Peroxisome biogenesis consists of two pathways, de novo biogenesis
  from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the fission of pre-existing peroxisomes mediated
  by Pex11. b Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Gpd2 produces NAD+ for histidine
  and lysine biosynthesis in peroxisomes. c Lysine and histidine production decrease
  in densely packed large peroxisomes in pex11Δ cells. d Relieving competition between
  compartmentalized reactions restores biosynthetic capability in enlarged peroxisomes
  of pex11Δ cells.
