caption: Process Diagram. The diagram illustrates the mechanism by which BPIFB4 mediates
  macrophage polarization through the regulation of the PI3K/AKT1 signaling pathway
  under CS and LPS stimulation. In the mouse model treated with CS and LPS, BPIFB4
  expression is downregulated, leading to the activation of the PI3K/AKT1 signaling
  pathway, which increases the phosphorylation levels of PI3K and AKT1, resulting
  in an imbalance of M1/M2 macrophage polarization and exacerbating COPD inflammation.
  This mechanism highlights the important role of BPIFB4 in regulating M1/M2 balance
  through the PI3K/AKT1 pathway
