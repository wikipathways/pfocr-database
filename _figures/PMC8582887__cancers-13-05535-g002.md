caption: PI3K pathway in Tregs regulating anti-cancer immunity. Activated AKT pathway
  through PI3Kδ signaling, the dominant isoform in Tregs, leads to the phosphorylation
  of the BACH2 and FOXO1 transcription factors and in this form they are sequestrated
  in the cytoplasm. BACH2 and FOXO1 are regulators of genes involved in Treg differentiation
  and function, such as FOXP3, L-selectin (SELL), CCR7 and IFNγ. PI3Kδ inhibition
  suppress Tregs functionality; they are not able to suppress any more anti-tumor
  responses. Proteins belonging to downstream TCR signaling are also regulated by
  PI3Kδ, as pS6 phosphorylation and GSK-3β activation, controlling proliferation,
  survival pathway and downstream degradation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1.
