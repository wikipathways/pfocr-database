caption: This was modified from the pathways presented in the KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).
  ANOVA was performed to assess the statistical significance of differences between
  samples (p-value < 0.05). Data are presented as mean values and error bars represent
  the standard deviation. Different letters represent the statistical significance
  of metabolite levels.
