caption: Differentially expressed proteins of the glutamine metabolic pathway in ovarian
  cancer. Schematic representation of the glutamine metabolic pathway in ovarian cancer
  that highlights the differentially regulated genes (LAT1; overexpressed, ASCT2;
  overexpressed, BCAT1; overexpressed, GLS; overexpressed, ASS1; overexpressed, ASL;
  underexpressed; CAT1; overexpressed). Boxplot derived from TGCA ex-pression datasets
  with tumor (red) and control (gray). * Represents statistical significance of p
  < 0.05.
