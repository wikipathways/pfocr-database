caption: A schematic representation of the early steps of the calcification process
  in CKD. Deregulation of calcium (Ca2+, in red) and phosphate (P, in green) are key
  events initiating and promoting vascular calcification. Various genes and proteins
  involved in the endothelium mineralization are reported in the left part of the
  figure, where active and inactive genes are underscored in a green or red color,
  respectively. The dashed green lines represent a secondary pathway involved in gene
  activation. With various contributions from uremic toxins, inflammation and oxidative
  stress, as well as the loss of local inhibitors, the system evolves toward calcification,
  according to mechanisms which are still unclear and partly related to the scope
  of the present work. On the right half of the Figure, a schematic structure of a
  blood vessel and the role of the endothelium modifications are reported. Calcium,
  Ca2+; Phosphate, P; Inorganic Pyrophosphate Transport Regulator, ANKH; Bone Morphogenetic
  Protein 2, BMP2; tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, ALPL; RUNX Family Transcription
  Factor 2, RUNX2; Dickkopf WNT Signaling Pathway Inhibitor 1, DKK1; Extracellular
  signal-regulated 1/2, ERK1/2.
