caption: Using the canonical pathway from IPA depicting the ‘Role of Pattern Recognition
  Receptors in Recognition of Bacteria and Viruses’, expression values from RNAseq
  data was overlaid where red molecules indicate upregulation and green molecules
  indicate downregulation. Uncoloured molecules indicate no expression. Tlr1, 2 and
  6 are stimulated by M.tb infection, whereas Tlr5 and 9 expression is downregulated.
  We included Fpr1, as it is highly stimulated upon infection with R179NT M.tb. Under
  infection conditions, it indirectly activates a number of proinflammatory cytokines
  as well as ERK1/2 and JNK. Cxcl14 was also included in the pathway as it was observed
  to be downregulated by M.tb infection. It has anti-microbial properties and was
  observed that infection by other pathogens decreases its expression. Solid lines
  indicate direct activation, broken lines indicate indirect activation.
