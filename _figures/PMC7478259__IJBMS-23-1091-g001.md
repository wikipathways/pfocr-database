caption: Schema showing non-genomic actions of thyroid hormones started at the plasma
  membrane receptors on integrin αvβ3, or 3, 5, 3’ triiodo-L-thyronine receptors localized
  in the cytoplasm, entailed in their cardiovascular effects. (I) Through integrin
  αvβ3, T4, and T3 stimulate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, producing TR-β1 and STAT-1α
  phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus where its transcriptional activity
  is heightened (5, 6). (II) Thyroid hormone-stimulated ERK1/2 can also move to the
  nucleus to phosphorylate nuclear TRβ1. Complex cellular events induced by the cell
  surface receptor include angiogenesis and cell proliferation (5, 6). (III) T3 may
  also activate cytoplasmic PI3K and initiate downstream transcription of specific
  genes, such as ZAKI-4, a calcineurin inhibitor, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α
  (HIF1α) (5, 6). (IV) In the cytoplasm, T3 binding to TRα1 and TRβ1 activates the
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal transduction pathway, increasing protein synthesis and causing
  activation of a hypertrophic gene program (3).
