caption: IL13Rα1/IL4Rα JAK-STAT6 pathway, IL13Rα2, and single-domain vNAR coupled
  to IL13Rα2. In normal cells, IL-13 binds with low affinity to IL13Rα1, and then
  IL13Rα1 forms the IL13Rα1/IL4Rα heterodimer with IL4Rα. IL13Rα1/IL-4Rα binding to
  the IL-13 cytokine stimulates STAT-6 intracellular signaling, resulting in receptor-mediated
  endocytosis (RME) and STAT6 translocation to the nucleus. IL-13Rα2 is a monomeric,
  high-affinity interleukin-13 (IL-13) receptor overexpressed in ~78% of GBM. IL-13Rα2
  is absent or expressed at minimal levels in normal brain tissues. Anti-IL13Rα2 vNAR
  binds to IL13Rα2 on the GBM cell surface, then IL13Rα2 undergoes receptor-mediated
  endocytosis and hampers IL-13 binding to IL13Rα2. Consequently, IL-13 can normally
  bind to IL13Rα1/IL4Rα, further initiating the JAK-STAT6 pathway; this leads to the
  restoration of this signaling pathway that inhibits the abnormal unlimited proliferation
  of GBM cells and finally culminates in the apoptosis of these cells. Green dashed
  and green solid lines depict indirect and direct effects of IL13Rα2 impairment by
  targeted binding of vNAR, respectively. Red lines and the red cross depict IL13Rα2
  inhibition of the JAK-STAT6 signaling pathway through IL-13 binding
