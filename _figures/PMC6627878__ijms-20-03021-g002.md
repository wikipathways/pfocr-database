caption: Kinase signalling pathway. In normal cells IL7 binds to its receptor IL7R.
  This interaction induces phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK3 and activation
  of signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT5) proteins. Phosphorylated
  STAT5, dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus and regulates the transcription
  of several genes, including the antiapoptotic BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL1. Growth factors
  bind to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), which trigger the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3
  kinase (PI3K). PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3,4 bisphosphate (PIP2)
  into phosphatidylinositol-3,4, 5 trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 recruits the phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase-1 (PDK-1) and the serine/threonine kinase (AKT) to the cell membrane, where
  they activate downstream effectors including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).
  Among its activities, mTOR induces the expression of the antiapoptotic protein MCL1.
  Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) are responsible for PIP3 dephosphorilation.
  In leukemic cells activating mutations in the IL7R-JAK-STAT pathway mediate steroid
  resistance, thus JAK1/2 inhibitors (ruxolitinib) could reverse glucocorticoid resistance.
  Activating mutations of PI3K and AKT are rare, while loss of PTEN is frequent in
  T-ALL. This leads to loss of negative control and persistent “on” status of AKT-mTOR
  signaling. Selective PI3K inhibitor (AS605240), dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor (BEZ235),
  panPI3K inhibitor (BKM12), AKT inhibitor (MK2206), and mTOR inhibitors (PP242, AZD8055
  and OSI027) act at different stages of this signaling pathway and may restore apoptosis
  in T-ALL cells. Hyperexpression (+++) of the antiapoptotic proteins BCL2 and MCL1
  is counteracted by venetoclax or Mcl-1 inhibitors S63845, respectively. Black arrows
  show signal transduction. Red arrows show inhibition.
