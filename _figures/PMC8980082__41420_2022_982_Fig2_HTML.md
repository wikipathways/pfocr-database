caption: 'A Apoptosis can be initiated through two fundamental pathways: the death-receptor–mediated
  extrinsic pathway or the intracellular organelle-based intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic
  pathway can be activated by multiple extra-cellular death ligands, such as Fas ligand
  (FasL), TNF-α and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). The binding of
  ligands and their corresponding membrane death receptors then recruits death adaptor
  proteins, such as Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and TNF receptor-associated
  death domain (TRADD), to the death receptors. Subsequently, the oligomerized receptors
  and recruited adaptor proteins form the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC),
  which binds to pro-caspase-8 and triggers its activation. Active caspase-8 further
  proteolytically cleaves and promotes the activation of downstream apoptotic effector
  proteins caspase-3/6/7, and ultimately apoptosis. Various cytotoxic stimuli and
  cellular stresses activate the intrinsic pathway by inducing increased expression
  of BH3-only proteins (BIM, BAD, etc.) and inhibiting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins
  (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, etc.). Activation of the pro-apoptotic effectors Bax and Bak ultimately
  causes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which induces the release
  of cytochrome C. Cytochrome C engages apoptotic peptidase-activating factor 1 (APAF-1),
  subsequently triggers the activation of caspase-9 and in turn downstream effectors
  caspase-3/6/7, eventually contributing to apoptosis. In addition, active caspase-8
  also engages the intrinsic apoptotic pathway indirectly through proteolytic activation
  of the pro-apoptotic protein BID into tBID. Moreover, the inhibitors of apoptosis
  proteins (IAPs), such as X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and survivin,
  play a negative role in modulating both the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic
  pathway by potently inhibiting key executioner caspase-3/7 activation and suppressing
  the initiator caspase-9 activity. B Various lncRNAs, including oncogenic lncRNAs
  (red box, high expression in NSCLC) and tumour-suppressive lncRNAs (blue box, low
  expression in NSCLC), participate in lung cancer-associated apoptosis by regulating
  apoptosis-related proteins.'
