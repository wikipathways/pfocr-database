caption: DNA repair pathways and cisplatin resistance. The dark blue border represents
  the cell membrane, with the light blue interior being the cytosol and the white
  oval being the nucleus. The grey rectangles represent the mechanisms of DNA damage
  repair (DDR). The DDR pathways act on damaged DNA to repair the molecule and restore
  genome integrity. DNA with an intrastrand crosslink is represented in the nucleus
  by the DNA molecule with a red bar linking two adjacent bases. The repaired DNA
  lacks the red bar representing the intrastrand crosslink. Each orange oval represents
  a protein involved in DDR that has been implicated in cisplatin resistance. Arrows
  point from groups of these DDR proteins to their associated DDR pathway. Enhanced
  DDR activity in cancer allows for restoration of cisplatin-induced DNA damage and
  resistance to treatment.
