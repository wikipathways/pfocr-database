caption: Different lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases
  (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), acute lung injury (ALI), ventilator‐induced
  lung injury (VILI), silica‐induced lung inflammation, and lung cancer (LC) have
  effects on mitochondria, leading to changes of cell biological function such as
  cell death, inflammation, senescence, proliferation. A, In COPD, deletion of mitogen‐activated
  protein kinase 3 (MKK3) could promote mitophagy and oxidative phosphorylation to
  activate the IL‐10 signaling pathway and inhibit inflammation. B, In other inflammatory
  pulmonary diseases, mtDNA release was identified to activate downstream signaling
  pathway including cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), stimulator of interferon genes
  (STING), NOD‐like receptors (NLRP3) inflammasome, and Yes‐associated protein 1 (YAP1)
  and exert effects on cell senescence, proliferation, and inflammation. C, In lung
  cancer, genes including mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase (DGUOK), Fascin, serine
  hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) and potential medications
  including mtROS inhibitor, phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase (PDK) inhibitor,
  isoflavone ME‐344 could affect mitochondrial function such as metabolism, mtDNA
  stability, and integration, ROS generation and mitochondrial dynamics
