caption: 'Macrophages with high expression of PD-1 inhibit their anti-tumor immune
  function. (A) Tumor progression is closely related to the expression of PD-1 in
  macrophages, and macrophages with high PD-1 expression generally show M2 polarization,
  phagocytosis damage, and IFN-γ signaling protein synthesis block. Meanwhile, JAK2-STAT3
  signaling pathway is considered to be a key signaling pathway for macrophage dysfunction.
  Macrophages can regulate macrophage polarization and signal protein synthesis through
  this pathway to promote tumor progression. The images are drawn by Adobe Illustrator
  software. IFN-γ: Interferon-γ; PD-1: Programmed Death-1'
