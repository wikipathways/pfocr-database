caption: 'Endogenous and exogenous metabolic pathways for butanol production in S.
  cerevisiae. A schematic diagram of the exogenous acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) pathway
  enzymes, and the endogenous threonine-based ketoacid (TBK) and glycine-butanol (GB)
  pathways. Gene cassettes expressing components of the ABE fermentation pathway and
  upstream enzymes that have been inserted into the yeast genome are depicted: Hbd
  (3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase), Crt (3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase), Bcd
  (crotonyl-CoA reductase) and Adhe2 (alcohol dehydrogenase) from Clostridium beijerinckii,
  and Erg10p (thiolase), Ald6p (aldehyde dehydrogenase) and Acs2p (acetyl-CoA synthetase)
  from S. cerevisiae. The deletion of the yeast ADH1 gene is also depicted as a red
  cross, and relevant components of the endogenous pathways are highlighted, Leu1p
  (Isopropylmalate isomerase), Leu2p (β-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase) and Leu4p/Leu9p
  (α-isopropylmalate synthase)'
