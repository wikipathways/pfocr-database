caption: 'Model summarizing Che2 protein interactions and phosphotransfer reactions
  consistent with the results of this study. In the presence of O2 (left), Aer2 signaling
  increases the autophosphorylation of bound CheA2. CheY2 then dephosphorylates CheA2,
  but does not stably retain phosphate. CheY2 activity enhances CheY2/CheD interactions.
  Phosphotransfer from CheA2 to CheB2 enhances CheB2 phosphatase activity so that
  Aer2 is demethylated to terminate signaling. In the absence of O2 (right), Aer2
  does not signal, and CheY2/CheD interactions attenuate. This frees CheD to augment
  CheR2-mediated methylation of Aer2, enhancing the probability of Aer2 signaling.
  Since CheY2 does not stably retain phosphate, CheA2 possibly transfers a phosphoryl
  group to an alternative response regulator (Rec) to modulate the cellular response.
  Abbreviation: SAM, S-adenosylmethionine.'
