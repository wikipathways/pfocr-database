caption: RA Metabolic pathways affected by DEAB and TTNPB treatments. Pathway names
  are indicated in bold and boxed, and the specific reactions and metabolites are
  enclosed in blue. Gene names are indicated in green. Arrows near the genes indicate
  up- or down-regulation, respectively, in DEAB (blue) or TTNPB (red) with respect
  to CTRL. Arrows and names in grey refer to non-modified pathways. Dashed lines indicate
  that the action could be in different pathways or metabolic steps. Drawing prepared
  by authors using Microsoft PowerPoint.
