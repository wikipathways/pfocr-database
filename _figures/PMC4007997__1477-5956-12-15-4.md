caption: Molecular pathway analysis of regulated membrane protein changes in RLSCs
  as they undergo hepatocytic differentiation. The shown network (Network 1) reveals
  protein interactions involved in cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, tissue
  development and cellular movement processes. Red represents an increase in protein
  expression, whereas green represents a decrease in expression level; the color intensity
  represents the degree of abundance change. A solid line indicates a direct interaction,
  and a dashed line indicates an indirect interaction.
papertitle: SILAC labeling coupled to shotgun proteomics analysis of membrane proteins
  of liver stem/hepatocyte allows to candidate the inhibition of TGF-beta pathway
  as causal to differentiation.
