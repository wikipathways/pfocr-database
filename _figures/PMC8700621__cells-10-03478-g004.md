caption: Interaction network of DEG NPC, associated with significantly enriched GO
  BP terms from groups I and II and diseases and metabolic processes, identified using
  key words “Parkinson”, “neurodegeneration”, “transport”, “vesicular”, “mitochondria”,
  “lysosome”, “oxidative stress”, “apoptosis” and “autophagy” based on Pathway Studio
  data. Genes, overexpressed in NPC derived from twins with PD, as compared to NPC
  derived from healthy twins are highlighted red. Genes, underexpressed in NPC derived
  from twins with PD, as compared to NPC derived from healthy twins are highlighted
  green.
