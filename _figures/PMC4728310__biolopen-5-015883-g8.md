caption: PTP1B regulates cell contractility and spreading. (A) In WT cells, PTP1B
  cooperate with β3 integrin to activate Src/FAK signaling and repress RhoA-myosin
  activation (dotted lines and boxes). These events modulate negatively acto-myosin
  contractility at the cell cortex, facilitating the assembly of a lamellipodium (LP)
  and peripheral adhesions required for cell spreading. Impairing Src/FAK signaling
  pathway by dominant negative Src (SrcDN) and FRNK expression, or increasing RhoA
  function by expression of RhoA L63, induces a KO cell phenotype. In WT cells, phosphorylation
  of paxillin promotes Rac1 activity. (B) In KO cells, early integrin-dependent Src/FAK
  activation is impaired (dotted box). RhoA/myosin-dependent contractility is enhanced
  (↑), and as a consequence, filamin and FilGAP availability likely undermine integrin
  function and lamellipodium assembly, respectively. This condition facilitates cell
  contraction. Expression of constitutive active Src (SrcYF), or incubation with blebbistatin,
  restores peripheral adhesions and the lamellipodium. In KO cells Rac1 activity is
  not induced efficiently, likely by reduced phosphorylation of paxillin and other
  adaptors, and by negative regulation imposed by enhanced RhoA/myosin signaling.
  Expression of constitutively active Rac1 L61 rescues lamellipodium formation. Expression
  of the phosphomimetic paxillin Y31E/Y118E is not enough for adhesion assembly.
