caption: Summary of metabolic pathways of the DFC involved in glucose lipid metabolism
  and amino acid metabolism. Pyruvate and glycolysis/glycolysis pathways are the main
  pathways regulating glucose metabolism and energy metabolism, and the lactate produced
  by this pathway can be converted to other short-chain fatty acids such as propionic
  acid and butyric acid. The alanine, aspartate, and glutamate pathways produce pyruvate
  and gibberellic acid, respectively, which participate in the citric acid cycle for
  energy production, with gibberellic acid, citric acid, and succinic acid being intermediates
  of the TCA cycle. Note Red = upregulated metabolites; Blue = downregulated metabolites
