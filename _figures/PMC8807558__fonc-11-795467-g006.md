caption: IGF2BP3 represses p27, thereby affecting the downstream pathway and finally
  causing G1 arrest. (A) IGF2BP3 activates the CDK2/Cyclin E complex by repressing
  p27, which leads to the phosphorylation of RB and the release of the transcription
  factor E2F from RB, leading to the progression from G1 to S phase in the cell cycle.
  (B)Transfection with IGF2BP3 siRNA alone results in inhibition of cell proliferation
  with G1 phase arrest by increasing the expression of p27. Simultaneous transfection
  with IGF2BP3 and p27 siRNA prevents p27 upregulation by IGF2BP3 siRNA, leading to
  alleviation of G1 phase arrest and restoration of cell proliferation.
