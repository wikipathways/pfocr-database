caption: 'To facilitate clarity, a contemporary model of the pheromone pathway is
  shown here, which is inferred from prior studies described in the text. The mating
  pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisae is triggered in response to pheromone-dependent
  activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor, Ste2, and subsequent recruitment of
  Ste5 to the plasma membrane (PM), mediated by Ste5PM and Ste5PH domains as well
  as the Ste5RING domain that binds directly to free Gβ/Ste4. Under resting conditions,
  Ste5/PM association and MAPK activation is disfavored due to hyper-phosphorylation
  at positions surrounding Ste5PM (sites marked as sticks), auto-inhibition of the
  Ste5PH domain through a competitive interaction with Ste5VWA, and the lack of free
  Gβ/Ste4 that is sequestered by GDP-bound Gα/Gpa1. Pathway activation is also inhibited
  by the Ste5FBD, which allosterically activates Fus3 to promote phosphorylation of
  Ste5T287 and three other phosphosites proximal to Ste5FBD and Ste5RING (P-lollipops).
  Upon pheromone stimulation, cascade activation of MAP kinases relies on PM recruitment
  and stable association of Ste5 that is concomitant with several state changes, including
  (but not limited to): (1) upregulated expression of the phosphatase Ptc1, which
  competes with Fus3 for binding to Ste5FBD and promotes Ste5 de-phosphorylation;
  (2) a large conformational change in Ste5 accompanied by de-inhibition of Ste5VWA;
  and (3) MAPK cascade activation of Fus3 and Kss1. For simplicity, interactions involving
  proteins such as Ste20, Far1, Cdc42, Cdc24, and many more involved in shmoo formation
  are not shown. Central components of the model discussed extensively here as a framework
  for this work include the Ste5FBD and phosphoregulatory control by Fus3 and Ptc1,
  captured in part by , , and ; conformational dynamics and PM association of Ste5,
  captured in part by  and ; and the role of Gβγ/Ste5RING as an essential feature
