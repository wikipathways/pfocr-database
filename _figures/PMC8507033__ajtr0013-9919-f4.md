caption: Inflammation regulatory network in NPCs with miRNAs. Both NF-κB and MAPK
  are classical inflammatory pathways, and most miRNAs in this regulatory network
  also indirectly regulate inflammatory response through these two pathways. miR-223-3p
  and miR-155 inhibit the activity of NF-κB by inhibiting p65 phosphorylation and
  TCF7L2 expression, respectively. miR-27a and miR-148a-3p can promote and inhibit
  p38 phosphorylation, respectively, and further regulate MAPK pathway activity. At
  the same time, both miR-34a and miR-132 can promote the phosphorylation of ERK1/2
  by inhibiting GDF5, and finally promote the activity of MAPK pathway. miR-194-5p
  can inhibit the activity of the above two pathways by targeting TRAF6, while miR-155
  can directly target inhibition of C/EBPβ, and then enhance the inhibition ability
  of miR-194-5p on TRAF6-C/EBPβ-inflammation axis. miR-140-5p can inhibit the expression
  of TLR4, and then reduce the severity of inflammation. miR-146a-5p activates the
  Jak/STAT3 through the unknown pathway, thereby promoting inflammation.
