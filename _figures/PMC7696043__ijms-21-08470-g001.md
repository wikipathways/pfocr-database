caption: Nuclear factor-kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathways.
  NF-κB pathways are stimulated by various cytokines, bacteria, or viruses on different
  receptors. Activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway leads to various kinases, including
  transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), phosphorylating the inhibitor
  of kappa B kinase (IKK) complex preferentially activating IKKβ. Inhibitory kappa
  B kinase beta (IKKβ) then phosphorylates p105 bound to RelA targeting p105 for partial
  proteasomal degradation into p50. Additionally, IKKβ phosphorylates IκBα targeting
  it for proteasomal degradation allowing p50-RelA to translocate to the nucleus.
  Activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway leads to NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK)
  activation and subsequent phosphorylation of IKKα. Inhibitory kappa B kinase alpha
  (IKKα) then phosphorylates p100 marking it for partial proteasomal degradation into
  p52. RelB bound p52 is then translocated to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription.
  NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) is also able to facilitate canonical NF-κB pathway activation
  through phosphorylation of the IKKα subunit.
