caption: Proteome-metabolome correlation analysis. The metabolites and the enzymes
  present in pericarp extracts of control and salt-treated B. juncea plants involved
  in the glycolysis pathway, TCA cycle, and amino acids synthesis are shown. Green
  arrows pointing upward indicate the up-accumulation of enzymes in salt-treated pericarps.
  Brown arrows pointing upward and downward indicate up-accumulation and down-accumulation
  of metabolites, respectively. Numbers at the arrow head indicate fold change compared
  to control pericarps. P5CSA, Delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase A; PSAT, phosphoserine
  aminotransferase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyl transferase; AGXT, Alanine glyoxylate
  aminotransferase; TA, transaminase.
