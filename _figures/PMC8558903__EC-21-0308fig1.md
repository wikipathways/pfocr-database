caption: The cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D and path to its measured and active
  forms. UV radiation (specifically UVB), naturally present in sunlight, falling on
  unprotected skin, initiates vitamin D synthesis when it causes 7-dehydrocholesterol
  to photoisomerise to previtamin D. This is a rapid reaction. Thereafter, a slow
  heat isomerisation taking several hours results in the change from previtamin D
  to vitamin D. The vitamin D binds to a vitamin D binding protein and enters the
  circulation, from whence it is hydroxylated in the liver to form 25-hydroxyvitamin
  D, the measure of which is used to define vitamin D status. There are therefore
  several steps between the delivery of a dose of UVB to the skin, and the measurement
  of the response quantified as a change in the circulating 25OHD. The basic pathway
  is represented by black text in boxes. Photoproducts in orange are biologically
  inert and limit the supply of vitamin D despite prolonged exposure to UV radiation.
