caption: Summary on Scenedesmus-induced metabolic effects and its potential role in
  modulating metabolic system. Variety of components in Scenedesmus exert different
  functions in the body, which contribute to the metabolic changes after Scenedesmus
  feeding. Overall, Scenedesmus feeding targets multiple metabolic system, including
  urea cycle, purine metabolism, methionine metabolism, nuclear receptor PPARα metabolic
  pathway, redox balance, and microbial metabolism. Metabolic effects only induced
  by 5% are presented in red color, whereas 20% are in green color. Blue color indicate
  the metabolic effects induced by both 5% and 20% feeding. (AA, amino acid; Met,
  methionine; Hcy, homocysteine; Cys, cysteine; Tau, taurine; SAM, s-adenosylmethionine;
  SAH, s-adenosylhomocysteine; DMG, dimethylglycine; Asp, aspartic acid; ADP, adenosine
  diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate).
