caption: Schematic of activation and inhibition pathways for ILC2s. IL-1 family cytokines,
  IL-25, and TNFSFs weakly induce IL-5 and IL-13 via activation of NF-κB and AP-1.
  Activation of NFAT by lipid mediators and NMU is required for induction of IL-4.
  IL-2 and IL-7 family cytokines and ICOS-L act as costimulators and potently enhance
  cytokine- and lipid mediator-mediated induction of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 via the
  activation of STAT5 in ILC2s. Although C3a, VIP, and CGRP activate ILC2s, at least
  in mice, their signaling pathways in ILC2s have not been elucidated. Testosterone
  and glucocorticoids suppress NF-κB-mediated induction of type 2 cytokines via activation
  of nuclear receptors, AR and GR, respectively. IFN- and IL-27-mediated inhibition
  of ILC2s occurs via the STAT1 pathway. The activation of cAMP and PKA is involved
  in ADRB2 agonist-, PGE2-, and PGI2-mediated inhibition. IL-10 and TGF-β also suppress
  functions of ILC2s. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies and receptor antagonists
  against activation pathways of ILC2s are commercially available or in clinical trials.
  ADRB2 = β2-adrenergic receptor; AR = androgen receptor; cAMP = cyclic AMP; CRTH2 =
  chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells; CysLT1R = cysteinyl
  leukotriene receptor 1; GITR-L = glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein ligand;
  GR = glucocorticoid receptor; ICOS-L = inducible T-cell costimulatory ligand; IFN = interferon;
  IL-1RA = IL-1 receptor antagonist; IL-33R = IL-33 receptor; LTC4, LTD2 = leukotrienes
  C4 and D2; NF-κB = nuclear factor-κB; NFAT = nuclear factor of activated T cells;
  PGD2, PGE2, PGI2 = prostaglandins D2, E2, and I2; PKA = protein kinase A; STAT1,
  STAT5 = signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 5; TL1A = TNF-like
  cytokine 1A; TNFSF = TNF superfamily; TSLPR = thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor.
