caption: Control of AICD by ROS. T cell activation via TCRs leads to rapid generation
  of both superoxide and H2O2. TCR activation also leads to FasL induction. This occurs
  because TCR activation raises intracellular Ca2+ levels, thus activating the phosphatase
  calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT, and the now activated NFAT can migrate
  to the nucleus and contribute to FasL transcription directly via the NFAT-binding
  sites upstream of the gene. NFAT can also stimulate FasL transcription indirectly,
  by increasing transcription of the genes for the early growth response proteins
  Egr2 and Egr3, which in turn can themselves induce transcription of FasL. Another
  pathway that may be involved in FasL induction by ROS may involve signaling through
  NF-κB, via activation of IκB by H2O2. NFATp, phosphorylated NFAT.
