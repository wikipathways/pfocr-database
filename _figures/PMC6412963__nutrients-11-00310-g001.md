caption: 'Overview of cholesterol trafficking in enterocytes. (A) Components associated
  with cholesterol absorption in enterocytes. Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) is the
  major cholesterol transporter. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) G5/G8 is an efflux transporter
  of sterols in the brush border membrane (BBM). Liver X receptor (LXR) modulates
  gene expression, the products of which are associated with the fluxes. Enterocytes
  take up cholesterol as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) via LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis
  from the basolateral side []. Cholesterol in enterocytes exists mainly as chylomicrons
  or very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) []. These lipoproteins carry triacylglycerol
  predominantly and other lipids as well, but the figures do not show them for simplicity.

  via ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1). Arrows indicate up-regulation. Gene expression
