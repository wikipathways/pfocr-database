caption: Controlled and pathological formation of ssDNA at stalled forks. When cells
  are exposed to RS, ssDNA forms at stalled forks through the uncoupling of replicative
  helicase and polymerase activities and/or the controlled degradation of nascent
  DNA by MRE11 and other nucleases. The ssDNA exposed is covered by the ssDNA-binding
  protein RPA, which serves as platform to recruit and activate ATR-CHK1 signaling.
  (i) In BRCA2-deficient cells, large ssDNA gaps form as the result of uncontrolled
  MRE11-mediated nascent DNA degradation (hyperresection). DNA pol α and PrimPol could
  either fill these gaps or promote lesion bypass while creating additional gaps in
  the process. (ii) The ATR-CHK1 pathway represses initiation when cells are exposed
  to acute RS conditions (high doses of APH or HU). In the presence of ATRi, the increased
  number of stalled forks depletes RPA and cells suffer from replication catastrophe,
  an event characterized by increased ssDNA exposure and massive fork collapse. Fork
  breakage may also result from uncontrolled nuclease activities, such as MUS81, SLX4-1.
