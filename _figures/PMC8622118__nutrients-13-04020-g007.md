caption: Integrated hypothesis describing observed and predicted metabolic response
  to vinegar supplementation. The conceptual schema was constructed using results
  of univariate significance testing, pathway enrichment analysis, and enzyme enrichment
  analysis. Green lettering with downward green arrows denote decreases in the VIN
  group, while red lettering and upward red arrows denote increases in the VIN group.
