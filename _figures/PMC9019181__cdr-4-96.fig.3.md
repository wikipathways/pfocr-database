caption: 'Multiple signaling cascades are activated following IL-6 binding to its
  receptor (GP130). Ligand binding causes GP130 dimerization and activation (phosphorylation)
  of the associated JAK kinase, which then activates downstream STAT transcription
  factor. GP130 activation can also transduce second messenger signaling via the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
  pathway to activate MAP kinase (MAPK). In addition, this inflammatory cytokine can
  also initiate the PI3K signaling at the membrane, which can either activate IκB
  kinase (IKK) and thus enhance NF-κB transcription factor function or PI3K may activate
  the downstream protein kinase B (AKT) which suppress NF-κB activation. Therefore,
  IL-6 signaling activates multiple redox signaling networks that may crosstalk with
  AR and activate it in a ligand-independent manner. IL-6: interleukin-6; JAK: Janus
  associated kinase; STAT: signal transducers and activators of transcription; NF-κB:
  nuclear factor kappa B'
