caption: 'Visual summary of processes discussed in this review. The SCN, entrained
  by the ambient light, drives the daily variation of steroids from gonads and adrenal
  glands, chiefly but not exclusively through the hypothalamus-pituitary-axis. Within
  each gland, circadian clocks modulate steroid biosynthesis at several steps in the
  pathway, and these are unique to each gland. The steroids circulate in the systemic
  blood supply and reach the SCN where they act on their cognate receptors, thereby
  fine-tuning the SCN output. At multiple points, ultradian oscillation is necessary
  for circadian oscillation. These oscillations at different temporal scales are synchronized
  from one level to the next. Other entraining signals, such as age, ovulatory cycle,
  food, exercise and stress, may not act on SCN directly, but can modulate hormone
  synthesis from gonads and adrenals, with the consequence that circulating steroids
  reach the SCN and modulate its output. Symbols: red waves = ultradian oscillation,
  black waves = circadian oscillation. The ultradian rhythm of CRH is not included
  as it is not required for generating ACTH and CORT pulsatility (). The ultradian
  oscillations are not drawn for SCN, melatonin and ANS as their ultradian rhythms
  are not covered in the current article.'
