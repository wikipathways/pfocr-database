caption: The quantitative change in the levels of phosphopeptides in the BCR signalosome
  after anti-IgM treatment is indicated on the left half of the circle for each protein;
  the change from pretreatment with TG is shown on the right half. The colours red,
  green and grey represent overexpression (ratio >2), downregulation (ratio <0.5)
  or no change in the phosphorylation site of each protein, respectively. Sample A
  represents B cells without treatment. Sample B represents activated B cells on treatment
  with anti-IgM (10 μg ml−1) for 10 min; sample C was also pretreated with TG (0.1 μM)
  for 8 h. Circles with solid lines represent known molecules in BCR signalling, while
  those depicted in dashed lines have not been reported in this pathway but are added
  through using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis and literature mining (CD45 is PTPRC,
  BCAP is Pik3ap1, SHIP is Inpp5D, PKC is PRKC and Bam32 is DAPP1).
