  catalyzes the conversion of cinnamyl aldehydes to alcohols using NADPH as its cofactor.

  and R2 = OH; coniferyl aldehyde and alcohol, R1 = H and R2 = OCH3; sinapyl aldehyde
  and alcohol, R1 and R2 = OCH3. B, A simplified model of the lignin biosynthetic
  pathway where CAD catalyzes the final step in monolignol biosynthesis.
