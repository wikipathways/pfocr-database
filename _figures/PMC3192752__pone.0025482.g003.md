caption: 'The map has been constructed using the correlation of pretreatment metabolites
  with change of LDL-C in GPR. Enzymes are represented by circles; metabolites by
  squares. Metabolites in grey squares were not quantified. White squares were not
  significantly different. The metabolites with significant p-values are colored according
  to the correlation relationship with blue negative and red positive. Red: Better
  response, more reduction of the metabolite. Blue: Better response, less reduction
  or increase of the metabolite. Correlations to changes in LDL-C are given in the
  first row and column. The metabolites have been rescaled (divided by the largest
  absolute value of them) to be clearer on the map. * Correlations significant by
  p-value, but not significant after controlling for q-value. ** Correlations significant
  by p-value and significant after controlling for q-value.'
