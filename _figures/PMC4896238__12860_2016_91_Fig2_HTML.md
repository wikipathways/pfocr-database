caption: Signaling pathways that control coupling in two types of retinal neuron.
  Coupling through Cx36 gap junctions is regulated by Cx36 phosphorylation through
  an order of magnitude dynamic range. Phosphorylation enhances coupling and pathways
  that promote Cx36 phosphorylation are colored green in this diagram while those
  that reduce phosphorylation are colored red. Elements colored blue are hypothesized
  to play a role but have not been specifically demonstrated. a Retinal AII amacrine
  cell coupling is increased by Cam Kinase II phosphorylation driven by Ca2+ influx
  through non-synaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors. This process depends on spillover
  glutamate derived from bipolar cells and is enhanced by activation of synaptic AMPA-type
  glutamate receptors that depolarize the cell. Reduction of Cx36 phosphorylation
  is driven by an independent pathway in which activation of D1 dopamine receptors
  increases adenylyl cyclase activity, activating protein kinase A, which in turn
  activates protein phosphatase 2A. Protein phosphatase 1 suppresses this pathway.
  Both pathways are activated by light, but with different thresholds, leading to
  an inverted U-shaped light adaptation curve. b Photoreceptor coupling is enhanced
  by Cx36 phosphorylation driven directly by protein kinase A activity under control
  of adenylyl cyclase (AC). AC activity is in turn controlled by an intricate set
  of G-protein coupled receptors regulated by circadian time and light adaptation.
  Darkness during the night phase increases extracellular adenosine such that activation
  of A2a adenosine receptors dominates signaling and activates AC. Light adaptation
  or subjective daytime result in reduced extracellular adenosine and increased dopamine
  secretion such that activation of dopamine D4 receptors dominates signaling to suppress
  AC activity. A1 adenosine receptors supplement this effect. The opposing signaling
  pathways routed through a common effector impart a steep monophasic character to
  the light adaptation and circadian control of coupling in this neural network
