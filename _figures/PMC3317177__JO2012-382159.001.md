caption: New therapeutic approaches based on targeted biologic agents have generated
  great interest and are currently being investigated in several clinical trials focused
  on treatments for recurrent ovarian cancer (). As is the case for other cancers,
  angiogenesis is a key process implicated in the metastatization of ovarian cancer.
  Several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA),
  lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 8 (IL8), and fibroblast
  growth factor 1 (FGF1) and 2 (FGF2) are involved in this process [, ]. To date,
  agents that target the VEGF pathway have proven the most effective against the disease.
