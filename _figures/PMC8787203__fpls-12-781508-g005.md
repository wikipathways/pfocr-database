caption: 'PTMs modulate carbon flow through glycolysis. Glycolysis is a highly conserved
  linear sugar catabolic pathway leading to the generation of ATP, NADPH, pyruvate,
  and metabolic intermediates for macromolecules biosynthesis. Thus, the elucidation
  of the PTMs targeting glycolytic enzymes is pivotal to understanding carbon and
  energy allocation in plants. HXK1, a hexose-phosphorylating enzyme mediating glucose
  entry in the glycolysis catabolic pathway, is phosphorylated near its active site,
  which could impact its glucose-sensing or catalytic activities. It is still unclear
  if the phosphorylation results from the activity of an upstream kinase targeting
  HXK1 or autophosphorylation. HXK1 also has a predicted SUMOylation site and interacts
  with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme SCE1, further supporting its putative SUMOylation.
  FINS1 redirect F1,6P from glycolysis to sucrose synthesis, possibly integrating
  metabolic information through acetyl-CoA mediated acetylation. FINS1 is ubiquitinated
  in vivo and possibly targeted for degradation to direct carbon toward glycolytic
  catabolism. The reduction of GAPDH mediated by reduced Trx increases its activity.
  Additionally, oxidative stress increases NO accumulation and triggers GAPDH S-glutathionylation
  and S-nitrosylation to promote the upregulation of glycolytic genes over GAPDH glycolytic
  activity. PGK is phosphorylated in vivo, but the upstream kinase and the physiological
  consequences of the phosphorylation are still unknown. The iPGAM phosphorylation
  relies on ABA signaling and SnRK2.2/3/6 action, which could promote growth arrest
  by diminishing glycolytic flux. The ENO2 transcript can be translated to ENO2, which
  converts 2PG to PEP, or to MBP-1, lacking the ENO2 N-terminal region. MBP-1 inhibits
  the ZAT10 transcription to repress the ZAT10-mediated cold responses. SCF1 and SAP5
  might ubiquitinate ENO2 and MBP-1, respectively, to control their accumulation.
  ENO2 interacts with bZIP75 to regulate carbon reserves during seed development.
  Here again, phosphorylation and ubiquitination seem to have a crucial role in regulating
  glycolysis to distribute C accordingly to metabolic and stress signals efficiently.
  The transcription factor WRI1, which modulates the transcription of PKβ1/2, is destabilized
  by SnRK1 direct phosphorylation, which may trigger the ubiquitination and degradation
  of WRI1 to regulate lipid biosynthesis. Ellipses and other rounded shapes = proteins
