caption: Schematic model illustrating the mechanism of combined treatment of VEN and
  C-82. When AML cells are exposed to lone-term VEN, the MCL-1 protein is upregulated,
  leading to the resistance to apoptosis. C-82 inhibits the binding of β-catenin with
  TCF/LEF, and indirectly promotes the degradation of MCL-1 protein by proteasome
  pathway. Subsequently, the combination of C-82 and VEN promotes the degradation
  of MCL-1 protein by destroying the phosphorylation of MCL-1 protein mediated by
  ERK axis and GSK3β axis, which significantly enhances the killing effect of drug
  combination in AML cells. This picture is drawn by Figdraw
