caption: Expected intracellular signal pathways of LPA-induced contraction in esophageal
  smooth muscle cell. LPA-induced contraction seems to be mediated by LPA receptor
  (1/3), coupled to PTX-sensitive G protein, resulting in the activation of PLC, PKC-ε
  pathway, which subsequently mediates the activation of ERK and JNK. The data also
  suggest that RhoA/ROCK is involved in the LPA-induced contraction.
