caption: 'Proposed B. pseudomallei tetrahydrofolate and tetrahydromonopterate synthesis
  pathways. The pathways are based on tetrahydrofolate (H4-Folate) and tetrahydromonopterate
  (H4-MPt) biosynthetic pathways that have been either established (H4-Folate) or
  proposed (H4-MPt) () in other bacteria. Genes for all indicated enzymes are present
  in annotated B. pseudomallei genomes. The folQ question mark indicates that the
  Burkholderia homolog is not known. The enzymatic steps of the H4-Folate pathway
  that are inhibited by either sulfamethoxazole (SMX) or trimethoprim (TMP) are indicated.

  aldolase/epimerase; FolC, dihydrofolate synthetase; FolE, GTP cyclohydrolase I;
  FolK, hydroxymethyl-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase; FolM, dihydromonapterin reductase;
  FolP, dihydropteroate synthase; FolQ, dihydroneopterin triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase;
