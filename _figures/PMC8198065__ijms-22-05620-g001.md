caption: Demonstrates the schematic diagram of pLysRS-Ap4A signaling in mast cell
  activation. Our pioneering work demonstrated, following physiological stimulation
  in the mast cell, the activated ERK-mediated phosphorylation of 207 serine lysyl-tRNA
  synthetase (LysRS), which is one of the components of the multi-synthetase–cytosolic
  complex. This confirmational change in the LysRS enzyme causes its dissociation
  from its complex and catalysis in the synthesis of Ap4A. This Ap4A acts as a 2nd
  messenger and binds specifically to Hint1 in the nucleus. This change in confirmation
  causes its dissociation from the transcription factor MITF, which is now able to
  activate its target genes of MITF that are involved in cell proliferation, migration,
  allergic inducer, etc.
