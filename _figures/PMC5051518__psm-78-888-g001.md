caption: 'A simplified diagram of the adaptive and apoptotic pathways of ERS. The
  initial phase of ERS is an adaptive response: the activated cytosolic domain of
  PERK phosphorylates the eIF2α, inhibiting translation and resulting in cell cycle
  arrest; the activated cytosolic domain of IRE1α cleaves the 252-bp intron from its
  substrate XBP1, facilitating its translation to form the transcription factor XBP1;
  the activated ATF6 translocates to the Golgi, cleaved by proteases to form an active
  50-kDa fragment (ATF6 p50). ATF6 p50 and XBP1 produce up-regulation of the proteins
  involved in the adaptive response. In conditions of prolonged stress, proteins downstream
  of all three transmembrane protein pathways have been identified as having proapoptotic
  roles. All the three transmembrane proteins could induce expression of CHOP protein
  ultimately. And CHOP represses the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2
  and up-regulates the proapoptotic protein Bax. By binding with the protein TRAF,
  IRE1 activates a JNK signaling pathway and the downstream caspases to cause apoptosis.
  ERS = endoplasmic reticulum stress; PERK = protein kinase RNA–like ER kinase; ATF6
  = activating transcription factor 6; CHOP = CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous
  protein; TRAF = tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; JNK = c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; ER = endoplasmic reticulum. Color image is available only in online version
