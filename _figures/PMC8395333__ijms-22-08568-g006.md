caption: 'Jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated drought, salt, and cold stress responses in
  plants. Under drought, salt, and cold stresses, the JA signaling pathway can be
  activated. When Oryza sativa encounters drought, expression of OsDREB1 is induced.
  The interaction of OsbHLH148 with OsJAZ1, along with JA-mediated root hydraulic
  conductivity and stomatal closure, improves drought tolerance in rice. Induced by
  the stimulus of salt stress, OsbHLH062 interacts with OsJAZ9, resulting in ion homeostasis
  and improved salt tolerance. In A. thaliana, cold stress induces the expression
  of AOS1, AOS2, AOC, and LOX2, which cause JA-Ile epimerization from JA. Furthermore,
  JA-Ile facilitates the interaction of JAZ with the F-box protein COI1 through ubiquitination
  to regulate the expression of downstream genes, thereby achieving cold tolerance.
