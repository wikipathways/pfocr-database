caption: Cellular metabolism in replicating INS 832/13. Schematic of the metabolic
  changes in INS 832/13 cells synchronized at G1/S, S and G2/M. At G1/S fused-to-intermediate
  mitochondria dominate and coincide with a peak in the pyruvate anaplerosis; this
  is alternated in the S phase by a higher involvement of pyruvate dehydrogenase branch
  of the TCA cycle and more prominent diversion of glucose into the pentose phosphate
  pathway while at G2/M more fatty acids are synthesized important for securing membrane
  formation in mitosis and there is another rise in Ca2+ necessary for mitosis. Mitochondria
  are more fragmented in the S phase and at G2/M phase of the cell cycle to secure
  mitochondrial inheritance during division.
