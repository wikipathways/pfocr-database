caption: Nf is a negative regulator of TGF-β1 signaling pathway. Inhibition of Nf
  activity was associated with p21-Ras-dependent hyperactivation of the canonical
  TGFβ1-Smad pathway that resulted in increased expression of TGF-β1 potentiating
  osteoclastic activation (red arrows) and inhibiting osteoblastic differentiation
  (green arrow) via MMP-2/MMP-9 proteolytic activation of the latent TGF-β1 (prodomain
  structure of TGF-β1). The model has been proposed by Rhodes et al. [] describing
  the NF1-associated skeletal deformities mediated by the pathological cycle of increased
  TGFβ1-Smad signaling. HSC, Hematopoietic stem cells; MMP-2, -9, Matrix metalloproteinases
  2, 9; NF1, Neurofibromatosis type 1; TGF-β1, Transforming growth factor beta 1.
