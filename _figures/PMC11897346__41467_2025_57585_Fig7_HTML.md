caption: SR-A3 effectively blocks XIAP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of
  PTEN by promoting protein degradation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase XIAP. Mechanistically,
  PTEN can significantly improve metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, impaired
  glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia and MAFLD by inhibiting the overactivation of AKT
  and lipid synthesis pathway regulated by its downstream transcription factor SREBP1c.
  In contrast, in the SR-A3-deficient state, XIAP protein stability is significantly
  enhanced and its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity can promote the ubiquitination and
  degradation of PTEN, which in turn leads to aberrant activation of the AKT pathway
  and increased SREBP1c-mediated de novo lipid synthesis. This cascade ultimately
  exacerbates pathological processes such as insulin resistance, abnormal glucose
  metabolism, dyslipidemia and MAFLD
