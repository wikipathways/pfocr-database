caption: 'A TRAF2 forms a complex downstream of TNFR1 with RIPK1, TRADD, and cIAP1/2,
  which inhibits apoptosis and activates NF-kB, JNK and p38. NF-kB, in turn, increases
  the expression of VEGF, thus sustaining angiogenesis. Also, both VEGF and NF-kB
  promote the differentiation of Tregs, thus sustaining immune escape. VEGF contributes
  to immune suppression by stimulating the proliferation of MDSCs. p38 and JNK promotes
  cell survival, and, in addition, JNK sustains EMT and, therefore, cancer aggressiveness.
  By promoting NIK degradation, the TRAF2-mediated TNFR1 signaling seems to play a
  role in the polarization of macrophages towards an M2 pro-tumoral phenotype. B TRAF2
  stimulates cancer aggressiveness by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
  downstream of TNFR2. This pathway inhibits autophagy and, by suppressing TRAF2 degradation,
  promotes the M2 macrophage polarization. C TRAF2 sustains the noncanonical Wnt signaling
  mediated by Wnt5a, which activates NF-kB and triggers inflammation. The dotted squares
  indicate the molecules or cellular events activated by each of the three receptors
  (purple dotted squares: TNFR1 pathway; green dotted squares: TNFR2 pathway; red
  dotted squares: Wnt5a pathway). DVL Disheveled, EMT epithelial–mesenchymal transition,
