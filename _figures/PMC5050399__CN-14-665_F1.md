caption: The interaction between stress, the autonomic nervous system, the immune
  system and the kynurenine pathway in the etiology of depression. The hypothalamus
  secretes CRH in response to stress, and from the paraventricular nucleus of the
  hypothalamus, CRH-containing neurons have projections to the locus coeruleus. The
  locus coeruleus sends direct projections to the sympathetic and parasympathetic
  preganglionic neurons, increasing sympathetic activity and decreasing parasympathetic
  activity through the activation of adrenoceptors. In turn, the activation of the
  sympathetic nervous system stimulates the release of CRH. When stress is prolonged,
  as in major depressive disorder, the sympathetic nervous system continues to be
  activated, with a lack of parasympathetic counter activity. As a result, NE and
  E levels are increased and ACh levels are decreased, which lead to an increased
  release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from immune cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  such as TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and interferons can induce IDO activity, which increases
  the KYN/tryptophan ratio. As a result, downstream metabolites, such as 3-hydroxykynurenine,
  3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and quinolinic acid are increased, which all have neurotoxic
  effects on the brain. 3-hydroxykynurenine generates free-radicals and causes neuronal
  apoptosis. 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid generates highly reactive hydrogen peroxide
  and hydroxyl radicals. Quinolinic acid selectively activates N-methyl-d-aspartate
  (NMDA) receptors, and high concentrations of extracellular glutamate and persistent
  activation of excitatory neurons cause excitotoxicity. Therefore, the accumulation
  of quinolinic acid can result in neuronal excitotoxicity and the selective apoptosis
  of astrocytes. This can ultimately lead to neurodegenerative changes, which may
  render the brain susceptible to depression.
