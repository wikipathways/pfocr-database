caption: Schematic illustration of possible interaction between inflammatory IDO activation
  and AhR-mediated effects. IDO1 plays a crucial role in the generation of LPS-induced
  endotoxin tolerance whereas combined effects of AhR, IDO1, and TGF-β are required.
  L-kynurenine alone failed to restore tolerance in the absence of IDO1 indicating
  nonenzymatic functions as intracellular signaling. It was found that IDO1 specific
  phosphorylation by AhR triggered kinase activity induces reprograming of gene expression
  leading to TGF-β in response to TLR signaling. Studies on human cancer cells showed
  that IDO induced KYN activates the AhR-ARNT associated transcription of IL-6 which
  promotes autocrine activation of IDO1 via STAT3 supporting the theory that IDO-mediated
  immunosuppression enables effectively immune escape of tumor cells.
