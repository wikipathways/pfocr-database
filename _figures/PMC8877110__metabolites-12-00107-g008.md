caption: Elementary flux modes (EFMs) of the metabolic subnetwork of the reaction
  network in . The dark gray flux mode show that inflow Pyr can be used to produce
  outflowing Leu. The black flux mode shows that Pyr can also be used to produce outflowing
  Val. Furthermore, the yellow flux mode shows that inflowing Pyr contributes to the
  production of Ile but only concomitantly with inflowing Thr.
