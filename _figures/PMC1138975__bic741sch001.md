caption: We generated a MCF derivatization metabolite library, covering much of central
  carbon metabolism and nearly all of amino acid biosynthesis pathways. We show the
  metabolic network of amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae during aerobic growth,
  highlighting (in grey) metabolites in our library. Continuous arrows indicate a
  one-step reaction, and broken arrows indicate a series of biochemical reactions
  where the numbers indicate the reaction steps in the pathway. This illustrative
  figure does not include all metabolites present in the library.
