caption: Schematic comparison between glucose (orange) and xylose (blue) metabolisms
  in engineered S. cerevisiae. Colored distinction of arrows indicates which sugar
  induce each metabolic pathway to be predominant. Xylose-derived weaker glycolysis
  metabolic activity and dysregulation of glucose repressions on cytosolic acetyl-coA
  synthetic pathway and mitochondrial development (green) allowed S. cerevisiae to
  more efficiently produce derivatives of pyruvate and cytosolic acetyl-CoA
