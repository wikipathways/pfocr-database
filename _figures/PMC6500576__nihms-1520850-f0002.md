caption: A) In the fed state, leptin bound to LepR expressed by POMC neurons in the
  arcuate nucleus and release of α-MSH hormone by multiple pathways initiated by activation
  of JAK2, a process that involves LepR-dependent activation of ROCK1. In one pathway
  initiated by JAK2, the kinase phosphorylates STAT3 to function as transcription
  factor. STAT3 promotes expression of the polypeptide POMC and processing of the
  pro-hormone to α-MSH. Binding of leptin to LepR induces another JAK2-dependent pathway
  where SH2-Bβ and IRS1 are recruited to activate the PI3K pathway. PI3K generates
  PIP3 from PIP2 at the plasma membrane. PIP3 recruits and activates of PKC including
  the atypical PKCλ. PI3K signaling leads to opening of TrpC5 to allow inward flux
  of Na+ and neuronal firing. PI3K pathway also promotes phosphorylation and translocation
  of FOXO1 from the nucleus to the cytosol to promote transcription of POMC, increased
  processing of POMC to α-MSH, and suppression of food intake B). Stat3 induces expression
  of factors involved in feed-back inhibitory pathways, such as that of Socs-3, which
  binds to LepR to inhibit receptor signaling. Stat 3 also induces expression of protein
  phosphatases such as TCPTP to terminate LepR to inhibit receptor signaling. C) In
  other populations of POMC neurons, the insulin receptor signals through PI3 kinase
  pathway to induce flux of Na+ into the cell through TrpC5 and neuronal firing. D)
  A population of POMC neurons expresses the GPCR 5-HT2CR. Binding of serotonin to
  HT2CR induces Gq-dependent activation of PLC, generation of increased intracellular
  IP3 and Ca2+, and opening of TrpC5 to allow Na+ into the cell and neuronal firing.
  Heterogeneity of POMC neurons expressing insulin, leptin and serotonin receptor
  is indicated by drawing cells expressing these receptors with different colors.
