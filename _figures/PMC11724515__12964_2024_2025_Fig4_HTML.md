caption: 'Effects of vitamin D on obesity and bone. Low vitamin D levels, which are
  common in obese people, reduce the activity of AMPK and SIRT1 in obese adipose tissue,
  and weaken the ability of AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway to promote white adipose
  tissue “browning”. Treatment with 1,25 (OH) 2D prevented hepatic TG accumulation,
  lipid peroxidation, and cell death, inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome, and increased
  phosphorylation of SIRT1 and AMPK. SIRT1/FOXO3a signaling pathway improves bone
  loss induced by 1,25 (OH) 2D deficiency. Vitamin D3 stimulated the proliferation
  and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs partly through SIRT1. Abbreviation: 1,25
  (OH) 2D, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D; TG, triglyceride; BMSCs, bone marrow mesenchymal
  stem cells'
