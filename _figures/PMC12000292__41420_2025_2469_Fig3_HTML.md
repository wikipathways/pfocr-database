caption: Under aerobic conditions, tumour cells rapidly generate ATP through glycolysis,
  enhancing their anti-apoptotic characteristics. Specifically, ANXA2, upon phosphorylation
  by Src, promotes the phosphorylation of the AKT/mTOR signalling pathway, thereby
  regulating aerobic glycolysis. This action reduces the production of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and modulates the transcription of apoptosis-related genes. Moreover,
  the lactate produced from aerobic glycolysis can enter the mitochondria, activating
  the electron transport chain and promoting oxidative phosphorylation, which increases
  the generation of NAD+. This process helps sustain oxidative phosphorylation, further
  supporting the survival of tumour cells
