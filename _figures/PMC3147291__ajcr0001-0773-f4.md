caption: A model for cell death induced by Rb and TSC2 inactivation. Rb-deficient
  cancer cells are sensitive to death in part due to impairments in the responses
  to various forms of stress, including the accumulation of ROS and misfolded protein.
  These cells therefore are particularly sensitive to deregulation of TORC1 activity,
  which is an inherently energy-intensive and stress-inducing signaling pathway. Because
  the TSC proteins play a central role in mediating TORC1 inhibition by various signaling
  cues, their inactivation can cause catastrophic metabolic deregulation in the absence
  of compensatory stress responses.
