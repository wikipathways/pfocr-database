caption: Model for the interplay between c-di-GMP, HapR, and RpoS in the regulation
  of HA/protease expression. The second messenger c-di-GMP negatively affects the
  expression of HapR. This regulation is independent of LuxO but requires the c-di-GMP
  binding protein VpsT and VqmA. At a high cell density, HapR enhances RpoS (pathway
  A) and both regulators diminish the c-di-GMP pool, generating a double-negative
  regulatory loop that further enhances the expression of HapR, HA/protease production,
  and motility (see the text for details). We propose that in the absence of quorum
  sensing, c-di-GMP also inhibits the expression of RpoS (pathway B).
