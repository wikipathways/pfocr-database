caption: Diagram of the plastidial isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway detailing the level
  of co-expression that PSY shares with individual interrelated isoprenoid biosynthesis
  pathway genes. The pathways represented include the Calvin Cycle, MEP, Carotenoid,
  Chlorophyll, Phylloqinone, Plastoquinone, ABA and Gibberellins and are collectively
  referred to as the PSY-correlated isoprenoid interrelated genes (PSY-CIIG). Reaction
  substrates and products are represented in bold black letters while genes that encode
  pathway enzymes are in black italic letters. Numbers in red parentheses represent
  expression correlation r-values and numbers in square brackets indicate the number
  of paralog genes that are annotated to encode the respective enzymes. All r-values
  > 0.5 had p-values and e-values <1.0-15. Non-significant r-values are indicated
  as n.s. Only the highest correlated member of the paralog gene family and those
  that have a co-expression value > 0.6 are listed. See Additional File  for list
  of corresponding gene IDs, details of statistics for individual genes and an extended
  list including additional paralog gene family members.
