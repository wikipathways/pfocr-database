caption: 'Somatic Activating PIK3CA Mutations in CLOVES Syndrome(A) Demonstration
  of the PIK3CA c.1624G>A somatic mosaic mutation in participant CL4. Massively parallel
  sequencing of this individual''s lesional tissue identified a c.1624G>A mutation
  in 2 of 16 reads (). With blood DNA and lesional-tissue DNA as templates, PCR amplimers
  encompassing the candidate mutation were generated and Sanger sequenced. On the
  top left is an electropherogram of blood-DNA amplimers showing only a wild-type
  sequence. On the top right is an electropherogram of lesional-tissue amplimers showing
  wild-type and mutant sequences. Blood and lesional-tissue amplimers were subcloned,
  and 48 individual colonies were sequenced. In the middle on the left, all subclones
  from blood-DNA amplimers contain a wild-type sequence; a representative electropherogram
  of a wild-type sequence from a single clone is shown. In the middle on the right,
  3 of 48 subclones from lesional-DNA amplimers contain a mutant sequence; a representative
  electropherogram of a mutant sequence from a single clone is shown. With mRNA recovered
  from lesional tissue as a template, RT-PCR was performed with primers in exons flanking
  the exon containing the candidate mutation. On the bottom left, a Sanger-sequence
  electropherogram of the RT-PCR amplimers shows wild-type and mutant sequences. Five
  of the 48 subclones from the RT-PCR amplimers contain a mutant sequence, one of
  which is shown at the bottom right.(B) A schematic of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway
  indicates the overgrowth syndromes currently associated with mutations in this pathway.
  Binding of a growth factor to a receptor-tyrosine kinase activates a PI3K family
  member, including PIK3CA, which converts phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  to the −3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) in a reaction that is antagonized by PTEN. Membrane-associated
  PIP3 facilitates the localization and phosphorylation of PDK1, which then activates
  AKT by phosphorylation at Thr308. AKT is further activated by Ser742 phosphorylation
  by the PDK2 complex including mTOR (FRAP1 [MIM 601231]). The following abbreviation
  is used: PTEN-HTS, PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome.(C) PIK3CA mutations constitutively
  activate the PI3K-AKT pathway. In the first column are immunoblot luminescence images
  of protein lysates prepared from normal subcutaneous adipose tissue. In the second
  column is hamartomatous tissue from an individual with a known PTEN mutation. In
  the right columns is lipomatous tissue from CLOVES-affected participants CL5 and
  CL6 (the blank lane between samples was removed). Lysates were separated by 4%–8%
  SDS-PAGE, transferred to immobilon P, and immunodetected with antibodies (Cell Signaling,
  Cambridge, MA, USA) that recognize total AKT, phosphorylated forms of PDK1 and AKT1,
  and beta-actin (as a loading control). Compared to lysates from adipose tissue from
  an unaffected individual or lysates from lesional tissue from an individual with
  a heterozygous PTEN mutation, lysates from the CLOVES lipomatous tissue show marked
  increases in the activated forms of PDK1 and AKT1.'
