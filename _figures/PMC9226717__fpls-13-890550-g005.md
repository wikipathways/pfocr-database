caption: DEGs and DEMs involved in glutathione biosynthesis (A), amino acid biosynthesis
  (B), and shikimic acid (C) metabolism pathway in response to atrazine stress. The
  rectangles are divided into two equal parts, the left part represents DEGs or DEMs
  in GA2, whereas the right part represents DEGs or DEMs in LG31. The colors in the
  rectangles represent the genes or metabolites that were regulated under atrazine
  stress (red indicates upregulation; black indicates no changes; and green indicates
  downregulation). GCLC, glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit; GSS, glutathione
  synthase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GGT, γ-glutamyltranspeptidase; G6PDH,
  glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase; ToGT1, scopoletin glucosyltransferase; C3′H,
  5-o-(4-coumaroyl)-D-quinate 3′-monooxygenase; NAGS2, N-acetyl-L-glutamate synthetase;
  ArgC, N-acetyl-gamma-glutamyl-phosphate reductase; P5CS, delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  synthetase; P5CR, pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase.
