caption: Ferroptosis in cancer progression. Erianin can inhibit cancer cell proliferation
  by G2/M phase arresting, and trigger ferroptosis. Enhanced expression of EMT-TFs
  reverses the ferroptosis sensitivity of cancer cells. Both the high tendency of
  ferroptosis and EMT suggest a poor prognosis of cancer. Processes characteristic
  of ferroptosis, such as ferritinophagy and ROS accumulation, are also found in drug
  induced EMT inhibition. MMPs can alter the tumor microenvironment and promote the
  absence of the basement membrane barrier, which makes the primary tumor more likely
  to enter the stroma and interact with tumor-associated stromal cells. Cytokines
  and growth factors are secreted by stromal cells and enhance the malignant traits
  of cancer cells. Cancer cells stimulate the formation of new blood vessels, which
  are more tortuous and prone to leakiness, and liable for cancer cells to enter the
  circulation. CTCs are coated by platelets to form an immune escape layer, which
  protects cancer cells from killing by NK cells. After reaching distant tissues,
  cancer cells penetrate the endothelial and pericyte layers to enter the target organ.
  To adapt to the new microenvironment, BMDCs are recruited and help to form the “premetastatic
  niche”. Hypoxia induces angiogenesis, which is controlled by HIFs, while the HIF
  pathway promotes ferroptosis susceptibility in several tumors. Exosomes and integrins
  both play roles in promoting angiogenesis and inhibiting ferroptosis. Higher levels
  of GSH and oleic acid and a lower level of free iron in lymph help reduce the ferroptosis
  of cancer cells, and that is why cancer cells in the lymph form more metastasis
  than those in blood.
