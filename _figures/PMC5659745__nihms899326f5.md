caption: In glucose medium, yeast cells preferentially perform glycolysis and reduce
  mitochondrial TCA cycle activity. When starved for amino acids (SD medium), WT cells
  are able to sense the lack of amino acids and regulate TORC1 activity through Npr2p
  and the GATOR1/SEACIT complex. As a result, WT cells boost TCA cycle activity as
  well as the retrograde response pathway for the production of nitrogen-containing
  glutamine and aspartate from α-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate (cataplerotic reactions).
  Glutamine and aspartate are then consumed for nucleotide and protein synthesis,
  which have a high nitrogen demand. In npr2Δ mutants, cells inappropriately perceive
  themselves to be amino acid-replete. Constitutively active TORC1 inhibits the replenishment
  of α-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate (anaplerotic reactions) due to dysregulation
  of the retrograde response pathway, and thus utilization of the mitochondria for
  synthesis of aspartate and glutamine is reduced due to the perception that cells
  are already amino acid-replete. Therefore, the GATOR1/SEACIT complex regulates TORC1
  to balance cataplerotic and anaplerotic reactions of the TCA cycle in tune with
  the amino acid and nitrogen status of cells. Since glutamine and particularly aspartate
  rescue the consequences of loss of GATOR1/SEACIT, high TORC1 activity signifies
  that cells have the appropriate capacity for biosynthetic demands requiring these
  amino acids.
