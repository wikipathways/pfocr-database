caption: Ingenuity pathway analyses of the PPAR signaling pathway in IPAMs treated
  with Apx toxins. (a) ApxIA Ct, (b) ApxIIA Nt, (c) ApxIVA C1, and (d) ApxIVA C2.
  Genes shown in red indicates up-regulation, green indicates down-regulation, orange
  indicates predicted activation, blue indicates predicted inhibition, and an uncolored
  node indicates that the genes were not differentially expressed in this pathway.
  The Ingenuity pathway analyses were generated through the use of IPA (QIAGEN Inc.,
  https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis).
