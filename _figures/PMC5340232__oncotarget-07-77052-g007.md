caption: 'Newly synthesized β-catenin is immobilized by E-cadherin at adherens junctions
  []. β-catenin can be released from the adherens junctions by downregulation of E-cadherin
  or by the activity of protein kinases. Free excess β-catenin is immediately phosphorylated
  by the destruction complex and thus marked for subsequent degradation. Canonical
  WNT signaling blocks the activity of the destruction complex resulting in increased
  levels of cytolasmic β-catenin, which is translocated to the nucleus. In the nucleus,
  β-catenin induces the expression of WNT target genes: 1) the transcription factors
  that repress the expression of E-cadherin; 2) MMPs that cleave E-cadherin as well
  as extracellular matrix (ECM); 3) the ECM and integrin molecules that favor cell-ECM
  adhesion. These events lead to induction of EMT. FILIP1L enhances β-catenin degradation
  in centrosomes possibly through: 1) inactivating the component(s) of β-catenin destruction
  complex, i.e. inactivating kinase activity of CK1 or GSK3β; 2) facilitating phospho-β-catenin
  recruitment into centrosomes; 3) facilitating polyubiquitination of phospho-β-catenin;
  4) facilitating proteasome-mediated phospho-β-catenin degradation downstream of
  polyubiquitination. Downstream signaling of active β-catenin (via transcriptional
  regulation) is thus decreased.'
