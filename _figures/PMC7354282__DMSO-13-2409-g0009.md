caption: '(A–D) Biological networks. The top four networks are showing interactions
  between dysregulated genes, functions, diseases, and upstream regulators in T2DM.
  Details are displayed in each figure. (A) NW1: The network displays cellular components,
  inflammatory responses, and neurological diseases. The network displays the canonical
  pathway and cellular components regulated by the DRGs. The upregulated (red) and
  downregulated (green) associated with dementia as a neurological complication of
  T2DM. (B) NW2: The network displays lipid metabolism, molecular transport, and small
  molecular biochemistry. The network displays the cellular functions and process
  (fatty acid metabolism, efflux of cholesterol) and inflammatory responses (IR) regulated
  by the DRGs. The upregulated (red) and downregulated (green) associated with dyslipidemia
  and glucose metabolic disorders and Alzheimer’s as neurological complications of
  T2DM. (C) NW3: The network displays developmental disorders, humoral immune response,
  and inflammatory responses. The network displays the canonical pathway and cellular
  process regulated by the DRGs. The upregulated (red) and downregulated (green) associated
  with immunodeficiency and rheumatoid arthritis as connective tissue disorders as
  a complication of T2DM. (D) NW4: The network displays cell to cell signaling and
  interaction cellular movements and inflammatory responses. The network displays
  the canonical pathway and cellular process regulated by the DRGs. The upregulated
  (red) and downregulated (green) associated with severe renal, hepatic, and cardiac
  injuries as complication of T2DM.'
