caption: 'Potential for using mTOR in PD treatment. (a) Inhibition of mTOR signaling,
  through pharmacological blockade of mTOR or reduction of Rhes, provides a better
  stage for the L-DOPA therapy of PD. (b) The induction of autophagy by either mTOR-dependent
  or -independent pathway, enhances the degradation of toxic α-synuclein to alleviate
  the symptoms of PD. (c) Activation of Akt or Rheb, specific ablation of PTEN or
  overexpression of miR-7 and miR-153 could increase mTOR signaling to prevent neuron
  cell death. Furthermore, a balance between activation of mTOR signaling and enhancement
  of autophagy needs to be accurately managed in the treatment of PD. Abbreviations:
  PD, Parkinson''s disease; Rhes, Ras homolog enriched in striatum; Rheb, Ras homolog
  enriched in brain; miR, MicroRNA.'
