caption: a | Domain structure of the MRE11 complex. The Nijmegen breakage syndrome
  1 (NBS1; also known as nibrin), meiotic recombination 11 (MRE11) and RAD50 components
  of the human MRE11 complex are illustrated. Domains are indicated by name with the
  corresponding amino acid numbers shown. Human disease mutations are indicated in
  green. Mouse alleles are indicated in red and `humanized' mouse alleles in blue.
  This figure is drawn to scale. b | The MRE11 complex has multiple roles in activating
  apoptosis after double-strand break (DSB) exposure. The complex activates ataxia-telangiectasia
  mutated (ATM) and facilitates the phosphorylation of select ATM substrates, including
  CHK2 and BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID), to promote p53-dependent apoptosis
  through the carboxyl terminus of NBS1. CHK2 signals in parallel, and is possibly
  activated by the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). Mouse
  alleles affecting various steps in the signalling pathway are indicated. Alleles
  in red impair apoptosis in both the haematopoietic and nervous system and alleles
  in green affect the haematopoietic but not the nervous system. c | Genetic interactions
  between mouse MRE11 complex alleles. MRE11 complex alleles used for genetic analyses
  are shown in green, components of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ; also known
  as classical (C)-NHEJ) machinery are shown in blue and other DNA damage or cell-cycle
  regulators are shown in red. Connecting lines indicate that genetic crosses have
  been analysed. Blue lines indicate that no synthetic interactions were identified,
  green lines indicate that synthetic interactions were identified, and red lines
  indicate synthetic lethality. Dashed lines indicate incomplete penetrance of synthetic
  lethality. Interacting alleles are classified by their major functions of the DNA
  damage response, although they may affect other aspects of the response. ATLD, ataxia-telangiectasia-like
  disease; BRCT, BRCA1 C-terminal; FHA, Forkhead-associated; h, humanized; m, mouse;
  NBSLD, NBS-like disorder; PIKK, PI3K-related protein kinase.
