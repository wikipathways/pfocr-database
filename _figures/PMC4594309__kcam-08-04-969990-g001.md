caption: 'Neurogenic niches and Eph:ephrin signaling. (A) In the developing neocortex,
  radial glial (RG) cells are self-renewing neural progenitors. They may self-renew
  or give rise directly to neurons or to intermediate progenitors (oRG cells and BP).
  Bi-directional EphA4:ephrinB1 signaling is required to maintain self-renewal of
  RG cells. (B) Neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (B cells) are in contact
  with the ventricle and blood vessels (in red). They give rise to intermediate progenitors
  (C cells) which differentiate into neuroblasts. Several members of the Eph:ephrin
  pathway have been shown to limit proliferation of C cells. (C) Two types of neural
  stem cells (NSC) are present in the subgranular zone (radial NSC and non radial
  NSC). Both give rise to intermediate progenitors. Eph:ephrin family members play
  distinct roles along that neurogenesis pathway. BP: basal progenitors; CP: cortical
  plate; GCL: granule cell layer; IP: intermediate progenitors; IZ: intermediate zone;
  SGZ: subgranular zone; VZ: ventricular zone. Adapted from Miller and Gauthier-Fisher.'
