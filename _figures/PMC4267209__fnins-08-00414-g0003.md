caption: Septate junction formation and maintenance in the invertebrate BBB. Components
  of the core septate junction (green) and the associated proteins that maintain BBB
  integrity (black) were identified from loss of function mutants that led to a porous
  BBB phenotype. Discs large (Dlg) mutants showed delayed assembly of the core septate
  junction components, whereas mutants of Gliotactin, and the endocytic proteins Clathrin-heavy
  chain (Chc) and Shibire, showed a mislocalization of the septate junction core.
  The Moody GPCR signaling pathway (Moody, Gαo/Gαi, loco) was shown to genetically
  interact with actin and non-muscle myosin components [actin-rich structures (ARS),
  Zipper, Spaghetti squash (Sqh)] to maintain septate junction integrity. Kinesin
  heavy chain (Khc) may regulate septate junction integrity by transporting Neurexin
  IV as a cargo protein. Loss of septate junction integrity by disrupting the function
  of wunen, the lipid phosphate phosphatase, suggests a role for bioactive lipids
  in paracellular barrier function. NL, neural lamella; PG, perineurial glia; SPG,
  subperineurial glia; CNS, central nervous system; kune (kune-kune).
