caption: The hypoxia-induced mechanism of NF-κB activation. In hypoxia, NF-κB is an
  important factor in the increase in HIF-1 mRNA expression, which is activated when
  oxygen concentration is decreased. This process occurs through multiple pathways.
  Like HIF-1α, IKKβ activation is inhibited by hydroxylation by PHD1. In hypoxia,
  PHD1 activity is reduced, which enables IKKβ activation. NF-κB activation during
  hypoxia also involves ROS and calcium ion mobilization into the cytoplasm. These
  factors cause the ubiquitination of IKKγ/NEMO, which increases IKK activity. IκBα
  is SUMOylated, which decreases the activity of this inhibitor of the NF-κB activation
  pathway. Chronic hypoxia is also associated with the activation of kinases such
  as p38 MAPK, ERK MAPK, and Akt/PKB, which phosphorylate NF-κB and IKKβ, thus activating
  this transcription factor.
