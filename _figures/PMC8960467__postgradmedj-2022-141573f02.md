caption: Proposed mechanism for COVID-19 infection in severe cases, leading to multiple
  organ failure. SARS-CoV-2 enters the bloodstream after binding with ACE2 receptor
  present on an endothelial cell of a blood vessel. The virus causes endothelial dysfunction,
  which results in vasoconstriction and induces ischaemia, the first step in IR injury,
  presented as number 1. Oxygen supply to an organ is restricted, which causes anaerobic
  respiration. This involves conversion of pyruvate into lactate by LDH. This results
  in low ATP levels and reduced pH levels, which cause Na+/K+–ATPase pumps and Ca2+–ATPase
  pumps to fail. Consequently, sodium ions, calcium ions and water molecules are retained
  within the tissue, which leads to swelling. In response to ischaemia, reperfusion
  occurs, which is indicated as number 2, the second step of IR injury. In this process,
  excessive ROS are generated. A cytokine storm is initiated, which includes proinflammatory
  cytokines like IL-6. The JAK–STAT pathway is involved in the cytokine storm because
  STAT3 increases the levels of IL-6 and vice versa. IL-6 also signals the release
  of CRP to the site of inflammation. CRP binds with FcγRI on antibody IgG for opsonisation.
  Monocytes present in the bloodstream enter the injured tissue as macrophages to
  start the process of phagocytosis. However, due to oxidative stress, the macrophages
  are unable to perform their function properly. The great intensity of inflammation
  results in systemic changes. Ca2+, calcium; CRP, C reactive protein; FcγRI, Fc gamma
  receptor I; IL, interleukin; IR, ischaemia–reperfusion; JAK–STAT, Janus kinase–signal
  transducer and activator of transcription; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; Na+/K+, sodium/potassium;
  RBC, red blood cell; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
