caption: A pipeline for Nb production, including dry spore storage, inoculation of
  spores into medium to allow for spore germination and outgrowth, bacterial growth,
  and protein secretion and purification. Vegetative cells of B. subtilis are transformed
  with plasmids that encode genes of interest (GOI), such as a particular Nb, and
  the Nb is fused with a cellulose binding domain (CBD) to allow for cellulose-based
  immobilization or with a 6×Histidine tag (His-tag) to enable metal affinity purification
  on a cobalt nitriloacetic acid (NTA) resin. The column-bound protein can then be
  used to purify the Nb’s antigen (e.g., small molecules), or the Nb can be eluted
  for use in antigen detection via conjugation of fluorescent dyes or radioisotope
  labeling. For long-term storage, B. subtilis is induced to form spores, and when
  the Nb is needed, the spores can be inoculated in culture medium to enable spore
  germination, outgrowth, and subsequent vegetative growth and then synthesis and
  secretion of the Nb via the Sec-dependent protein secretion pathway. amyQ, protein
  secretion signal peptide; groE, a strong promoter from the B. subtilis groE operon,
  which has been converted into an IPTG-inducible promoter by addition of the lac
  operator from E. coli.
