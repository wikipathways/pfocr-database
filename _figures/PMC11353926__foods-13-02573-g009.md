caption: Metabolic pathways related to the inhibition and reduction in L. monocytogenes
  biofilm by plantaricin Q7. The red text boxes indicate up-regulation and the blue
  text boxes indicate down-regulation. The orange dashed circles represent the two
  metabolites with the largest difference in fold in the inhibition groups, and the
  green dashed circles represent the two metabolites with the largest difference in
  fold in the reduction groups. The remaining dashed lines indicate direct or indirect
  connections between metabolic pathways. The green background indicates purine metabolism,
  the gray background indicates arginine biosynthesis, the pink background indicates
  glycerol phospholipid metabolism, and the light orange background indicates plantaricin
  Q7 acting on the L. monocytogenes biofilm
