caption: Based on this study, we believe that HAM1 acts as a negative regulator in
  the mating cycle of C. neoformans. Upon activation of the pheromone response pathway,
  HAM1 is repressed in a Cpk1-dependent manner. However, under non-mating conditions,
  HAM1 is induced by unknown signals. When induced, HAM1 regulates mating by inhibiting
  pheromone and pheromone response genes directly, or somehow inhibiting hyphal formation
  directly. During pathogenic conditions, we believe that HAM1 is highly expressed
  to prevent mating from occurring due to the low nutrient environment of a mammalian
  host. The changes we see in capsule could be a direct effect of HAM1, or an indirect
  result of altered mating signaling in the absence of HAM1 (dashed lines). This figure
  was created with BioRender.com.
