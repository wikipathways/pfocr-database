caption: The Core Metabolic Pathways of Immune Cells. Glucose is the primary energy
  supply substance. It can produce ATP through glycolysis, or tricarboxylic acid cycle,
  and oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, glucose 6-phosphate, the product of
  the first step of glycolysis, can participate in the production of pentose phosphate
  and NADPH by PPP, and participate in nucleotide metabolism and glutathione reduction,
  respectively (not shown in the figure). The TCA cycle is the hub of sugar, fat,
  and amino acid metabolism, and the three major nutrients can be transformed into
  each other through this cycle. Citrate can be used as a carrier to transport acetyl-CoA
  to the cytoplasm. Acetyl-CoA is the raw material for the synthesis of fatty acids
  and cholesterol. Many amino acids can be synthesized from intermediate products
  of the TCA cycle, and amino acids and fatty acids can also be used as alternative
  substrates for the process. For example, acetyl-CoA produced by β-oxidation of fatty
  acids and α-ketoglutarate produced by the deamination of glutamate, can enter the
  TCA cycle and drive OXPHOS. Glu, glucose; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; OXPHOS, oxidative
