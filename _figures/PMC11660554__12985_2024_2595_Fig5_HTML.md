caption: Alterations in the HSV-1-associated host antiviral signaling pathway in HGFs.
  A The pathway modules were modified from the KEGG pathway maps according to map05168
  (HSV-1 infection), and these modules were created through BioRender.com. The symbols
  in red font present the viral proteins of HSV-1. B The relative abundance changes
  of genes in the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. C The relative abundance changes
  of genes in the retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor signaling pathway.
  D The relative abundance changes of genes in the antigen processing and presentation
  signaling pathway. E The relative abundance changes of genes in the IFNAR-JAK-STAT
  signaling pathway. The relative gene abundance was evaluated for significant elevation
  or depletion at different time points, post-infection (12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h)
  vs. non-infected cells via the LDA score [log10] > 1 and the significant p-value < 0.05.
  The bar plots present the FPKM values averaged over the samples of DEGs with Z score
  normalization. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
