caption: The cross-talk between BMP and Shh signaling pathways in neural differentiation.
  (1) The complex of Shh ligands and Patch receptors trigger Shh signaling pathway
  by preventing inhibitory effects on Smo protein located within the membrane. (2)
  Smo activates the members of zinc-finger transcription factors called the Gli family.
  (3) The translocation of Gli proteins into the nucleus increases the transcription
  of genes that participate in the specification of neural cells. (4) BMPs can prevent
  the effects of Shh signaling by activating Smad5, which inhibits downstream agents
  of Shh such as Smo and Gli1. (5) TIEG-1, a BMP2 target gene, can suppress Gli-mediated
  transcription of N-myc, a critical Shh target gene, that prevents proliferation
  and promotes differentiation of granule cell precursors. (6) Smad1 interacts with
  C-terminally truncated Gli proteins and form a protein complex that contains Gli
  proteins which lead to neural differentiation.
