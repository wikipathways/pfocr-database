caption: Scheme of differentiation of M cells in PP. (A) RANKL expressed on M-cell
  inducer (MCi) cells initiate the differentiation of M cells. RANK signaling induces
  the transcription factor Spi-B and Sox8 parallelly. Spi-B+Sox8+GP2− cells are immature
  M cells that have low uptake activity. Sox8 directly induces the expression of GP2.
  GP2+ cells are mature M cells that have high uptake activity. (B) Signaling pathway
  of M-cell differentiation. RANKL signaling activates canonical NF-κB (p50/RelA)
  through TRAF6. Canonical NF-κB signaling is required for the activation of non-canonical
  NF-κB (p52/RelB), which regulates early M-cell marker genes. p52/RelB directly upregulates
  the expression of transcription factors Spi-B and Sox8. Sox8 directly binds to the
  Gp2 promoter. Both Spi-B and Sox8 are required for Gp2 expression and M-cell maturation.
