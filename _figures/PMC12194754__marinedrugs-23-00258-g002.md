caption: Iron metabolism and the interaction of antioxidant defense mechanisms and
  their regulatory network. Figure 2 illustrates the interaction mechanisms of iron
  metabolism, antioxidant defense, and related signaling pathways. It involves the
  uptake, storage, and metabolism of iron ions as well as their relationship with
  the antioxidant enzyme GPX4, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)
  signaling pathway, and the ACSL4(1) signaling pathway. Additionally, it demonstrates
  the potential effects of bioactive compounds derived from deep-sea hydrothermal
  vent organisms, red algae, brown algae, and other sources of iron metabolism and
  antioxidant defense
