caption: Possible biological interpretations of the allele length effect α (a). The
  figure shows a schematic of the repeated region (narrow lines) and the immediate
  flanking DNA (thick lines) and possible mutational pathways. A primary step in the
  mutation mechanism is assumed to be the transition from duplex DNA (i) to mis-aligned
  structures containing loop-outs or hairpins (ii). α Might represent the propensity
  for such structures to form, possible interference from the flanking DNA (ii) or
  interference between nearby loop-outs (iii). Once formed, complimentary loop-outs
  may be able to diffuse along the duplex. Loop-outs that diffuse towards each other
  may meet, regenerating the original duplex without length change (iv). Alternatively,
  complementary loop-outs may diffuse apart from each other (x). Loop-outs are expected
  to be recognized by components of the DNA mismatch repair pathway (shaded circles)
  (vi,xi). Repair may then proceed by excision of the loop-out (not shown, see []
  for more detail) or excision of DNA opposite the loop-out (vii,xii) and gap filling
  (viii,xiii). If α is small, then complementary loop-outs may interfere with each
  other [] (iii) or be encompassed within the same repair domain, resulting in no
  net change in repeat length (v–ix). If α is large, then complementary loop-outs
  may be repaired as separate events and depending on whether individual loop-outs
  are incorporated or deleted (deletions not shown, see [] for more detail) leading
  to net expansions (xi–xvii), no change events (xviii) or net contractions (xix).
  Please note that how excision domains are defined in replication-independent mismatch
  repair is not known and that excision domains extending only 5′ from site of the
  mismatch are shown for illustrative purposes only. Possible biological interpretations

  (white boxes), then the effective allele may be reduced by length β effectively
  increasing any flanking DNA effect (i) and/or reducing the possibilities for expanding

  description: Possible biological interpretations of the allele length effect α (a).
    The figure shows a schematic of the repeated region (narrow lines) and the immediate
    flanking DNA (thick lines) and possible mutational pathways. A primary step in
    the mutation mechanism is assumed to be the transition from duplex DNA (i) to
    mis-aligned structures containing loop-outs or hairpins (ii). α Might represent
    the propensity for such structures to form, possible interference from the flanking
    DNA (ii) or interference between nearby loop-outs (iii). Once formed, complimentary
    loop-outs may be able to diffuse along the duplex. Loop-outs that diffuse towards
    each other may meet, regenerating the original duplex without length change (iv).
    Alternatively, complementary loop-outs may diffuse apart from each other (x).
    Loop-outs are expected to be recognized by components of the DNA mismatch repair
    pathway (shaded circles) (vi,xi). Repair may then proceed by excision of the loop-out
    (not shown, see [] for more detail) or excision of DNA opposite the loop-out (vii,xii)
    and gap filling (viii,xiii). If α is small, then complementary loop-outs may interfere
    with each other [] (iii) or be encompassed within the same repair domain, resulting
    in no net change in repeat length (v–ix). If α is large, then complementary loop-outs
    may be repaired as separate events and depending on whether individual loop-outs
    are incorporated or deleted (deletions not shown, see [] for more detail) leading
    to net expansions (xi–xvii), no change events (xviii) or net contractions (xix).
    Please note that how excision domains are defined in replication-independent mismatch
