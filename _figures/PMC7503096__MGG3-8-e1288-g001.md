caption: Two common pathways implicated in thyroid cancer. The MAPK and the PI3K pathways
  are activated by the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) or by a fusion RTK. RTKs may
  include VEGFR, RET, FGFR, while fusion RTKs include RET/PTC, NTRK, and ALK. Increased
  activity of either of these RTKs (orange or red bars) by growth factors or increased
  expression by these sites, as well as mutations along the pathway, results in oncogenic
  activation of these pathways. Either pathway activation leads to tumor progression,
  differentiation, and decreased cell death. The MAPK pathway may be activated by
  mutations within RAS (H‐,N‐,K‐) or RAF, most specifically BRAFV600E. The PI3K pathway
  is negatively regulated by PTEN and may be activated by mutations in RAS, PIK3CA,
  PTEN, AKT, and mTOR. TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene and plays a role in regulating
  cell death, hence mutations within this gene lead to increased cell proliferation.
  TERT is a gene encoding the enzyme telomerase, and a mutation within the promoter
  region allows cells to overcome senescence, therefore increasing tumorigenesis.
  Patients with TERT promotor mutations that coexist with BRAF or RAS mutations have
  a worse prognosis
