caption: 'Combined miRNAs and transcription factor regulation of inflammation in wound
  healing. (a) The “seed” miRNA regulatory network built with data from  of Roy and
  Sen.(b) Integrated regulatory network built by using Pathway Studio 9.0 software,
  which added three more miRNAs (highlighted in yellow), 13 transcription factors,
  7 receptor proteins, and 5 other proteins and their relations. The proteins highlighted
  in blue and the miRNA in red represent the seed set. Relation colors: red, miRNA
  regulation; green, promoter binding; black, direct regulation; dotted line, indirect
  regulation. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred to the web
  article at www.liebertpub.com/wound'
