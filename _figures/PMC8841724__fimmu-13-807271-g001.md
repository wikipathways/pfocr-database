caption: 'The tryptophan catabolic pathway in cancer. (A) Provided by dietary intake,
  the essential amino acid Trp is catabolized into Kyn through three rate-limiting
  enzymes: TDO in the liver and IDO1/IDO2 in peripheral tissues. In tumor, IDO1 transforms
  Trp to Kyn by cleaving the 2,3-double bond of the indole ring, producing N-formyl
  kynurenine (NFK) that becomes rapidly and spontaneously converted into Kyn. The
  latter catabolite is further converted into downstream active intermediates, including
  hydroxykynurenine, anthranilic acid, 3-HAA, quinolinic acid and picolinic acid.
  The end-products of the pathway are NAD+ and others molecules that fuel cellular
  metabolism. (B) Depletion of Trp in T cells suppresses activity in the mTORC1 signaling
  pathway and activates GCN2, inducing T cell dysfunction and leading to tumor-associated
  immunosuppression. Increase Kyn level in the TME leads to AhR in multiple tumor-associated
  immune cells, promoting immunosuppression functions. 3-HAA, 3-hydroxyanthranililic
