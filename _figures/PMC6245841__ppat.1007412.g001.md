caption: 'Panel A shows a schematic representation of the glucose metabolism in BSF
  trypanosomes grown in glucose-rich medium (CMM_Glc), while panel B shows their glycerol
  metabolism in the absence of glucose (CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc). The approximately 10-fold
  higher metabolic flux in glycolysis (down to pyruvate) compared to that of pathways
  leading to succinate, acetate and alanine is illustrated by a proportional arrow
  thickness. End products excreted from metabolism of glucose and glycerol are shown
  in a grey rectangle. In Panel A, the GK step involved in glycerol production from
  glucose mainly under anaerobiosis is represented by dotted lines. The boxed number
  corresponds to the enzyme under investigation (GK) and the boxed ATP highlights
  the enzymatic step providing most of the cellular ATP. The circled glycosomal ATP,
  NAD+ and NADH highlight the main enzymatic steps involved in the maintenance of
  the glycosomal redox and ATP/ADP balances. The pathway used to maintain the glycosomal
  redox balance is highlighted by blue arrows, while the same pathway also used for
  conversion of glycerol-derived Gly3P into DHAP is shown with black arrows in panel
  B. The target of the SHAM metabolic drug (alternative oxidase) is indicated and
  the gluconeogenesis from glycerol-derived DHAP and G3P is shown in red. Abbreviations:
