caption: Potential flowering time regulatory networks in cabbage. Genes in blue represent
  flowering repressors, and genes in black represent flowering promoters. The genes
  in the black box have regulatory interactions that have been reported before, and
  the genes in the pink box are candidates. The arrows indicate transcriptional activation,
  whereas the bars indicate transcriptional repression. The dashed line represents
  the putative regulatory pathway.
