caption: 'Scheme illustrating the ASARM-model and the FAM20C kinase link to the FAP
  pathway: The numbers highlighted in the circles refer to the explanations in the
  following text. The interactions depicted on the osteocyte cell-surface between
  DMP1, PHEX, integrin and ASARM-peptides are dynamic and competitive occurring on
  the extracellular cell-surface. Arrows linking other factors represented in the
  cartoon illustrate positive and negative effector relationships (paracrine, autocrine,
  allosteric, signal transduction or gene expression): (1) FAM20C kinase phosphorylates
  the DMP1 C-terminal ASARM-motif; (2) Phosphorylation of the DMP1-ASARM motif is
  required for binding to PHEX and the RGD motif of DMP1 binds to α5β3 integrin to
  form a [PHEX-DMP1-α5β3-integrin] trimeric complex. This interaction occurs on the
  cell surface of the osteocyte where PHEX and α5β3-integrin have an intramembranous,
  domain a short intracellular domain and a large extracellular domain; (3 & 4) Formation
  of the [PHEX-DMP1-α5β3 integrin] trimeric complex initiates a signaling pathway
  (MAPK/Erk) that suppresses FGF23 expression; (5) FAM20C kinase also phosphorylates
  FGF23 (Ser180); (6 & 7) FAM20C phosphorylation of Ser180 inhibits O-glycosylation
  of FGF23 by polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GalNT3); (8, 9 & 10)
  The under-glycosylated and phosphorylated FGF23 is targeted for Furin degradation
  and proteolysis; (6 & 11) In contrast, non-phosphorylated FGF23 is O-glycosylated
  by GalNT3; (12 & 13) O-Glycosylation of FGF23 increases resistance to Furin degradation
  and increases ½ life of full length active FGF23. Of relevance, mutations in GalNT3
  are responsible for reduced circulating full-length FGF23 resulting in hyperphosphatemia
  and tumoral calcinosis [,,]. This is the opposite phenotype to high FGF23 or hypophosphatemia.
  In summary FAM20C is responsible for suppressing FGF23 expression via the [PHEX-DMP1-α5β3-integrin]
  trimeric complex and decreasing full-length active FGF23 by targeting the hormone
  for furin degradation. This is consistent with the high circulating active FGF23,
  increased FGF23 mRNA expression, rickets and hypophosphatemia (ARHR 2) reported
  in mice that are null for bone expressed FAM20C [,]; (14 & 15) The binding of PHEX
  to the DMP1-ASARM-motif is also competitively regulated by free ASARM-peptide. Specifically,
  free ASARM-peptide can directly bind to PHEX preventing the binding to DMP1 and
  thereby disrupting the [PHEX-DMP1-α5β3-integrin] trimeric complex; (16) This in
  turn results in increased expression of FGF23; (17 & 18) Also, free ASARM-peptide
  inhibits mineralization and renal phosphate uptake. In X-linked and autosomal recessive
  rickets there are high levels of circulating ASARM-peptides. Both in vitro and in
  vivo (bolus and infusion) administration of ASARM-peptides and transgenic mice over
  expressing ASARM-peptides causes mineralization defects and hypophosphatemia [,-,-,,].
  The bimodal effects of SPR4-peptide administration are not shown in the scheme but
  are discussed in detail in recent publications [,,]. The dual pharmacological effects
  depend on phosphate diet and mode of administration (bolus or continuous fusion).
  Briefly, SPR4-peptide binds to either the DMP1-ASARM motif or free ASARM-peptide.
  Binding to the DMP1-ASARM motif results in increased expression of FGF23 whereas
  binding to ASARM-peptides decreased FGF23 expression.'
