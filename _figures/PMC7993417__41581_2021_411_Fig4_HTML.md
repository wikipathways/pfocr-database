caption: a | The kidney is exposed to hypoxia under both physiological and pathological
  circumstances, such as in acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
  b | Endothelial cells (ECs) adapt to hypoxia by stabilizing and activating the transcription
  factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) through the direct effects of low O2 levels,
  the release of ATP and downstream activation of the adenosine A2a receptors, the
  production of NADPH-derived and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-derived reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), and as a consequence of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) activation and the
  upregulation or activation of fatty acid synthase (FAS) (left panel). Exposure to
  hypoxia affects the metabolism of ECs by enhancing anaerobic metabolism and fatty
  acid biosynthesis while repressing aerobic metabolism (OXPHOS). Levels of the metalloenzyme
  arginase II are increased whereas arginine uptake is repressed, leading to low intracellular
  arginine availability, which results in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
  uncoupling and the production of ROS (central panel). ECs counteract ROS produced
  as a result of the exposure to hypoxia by activating a SIRT3–forkhead box 3 (FOXO3)-dependent
  antioxidant gene expression pathway (right panel). CAT, cationic amino acid transporter;
  endoMT, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition; GLUT, glucose transporter; LAT, large
  neutral amino acid transporter.

  description: a | The kidney is exposed to hypoxia under both physiological and pathological
    circumstances, such as in acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease
    (CKD). b | Endothelial cells (ECs) adapt to hypoxia by stabilizing and activating

    Exposure to hypoxia affects the metabolism of ECs by enhancing anaerobic metabolism
    and fatty acid biosynthesis while repressing aerobic metabolism (OXPHOS). Levels
    of the metalloenzyme arginase II are increased whereas arginine uptake is repressed,
    leading to low intracellular arginine availability, which results in endothelial
    nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling and the production of ROS (central panel).
    ECs counteract ROS produced as a result of the exposure to hypoxia by activating
    a SIRT3–forkhead box 3 (FOXO3)-dependent antioxidant gene expression pathway (right
    panel). CAT, cationic amino acid transporter; endoMT, endothelial-to-mesenchymal
