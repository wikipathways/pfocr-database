caption: 'Intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway function as RORγagonists.
  Acetyl CoA is converted to mevalonate by HMGCR and then into farnesyl pyrophosphate
  and squalene via several steps, which are subsequently converted into cholesterol
  via multiple steps. Statins reduce cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the formation
  of mevalonate. Zymosterol, desmosterol, zymosterone, 4ACD8, 25OHC, and 7-dehydrocholesterol
  are among the most effective endogenous RORγagonists. Deficiency in CYP51A1, or
  its inhibition by azoles, and deficiency in FDFT1 inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis
  and limit the availability of RORγagonists. Abbreviations: ACAT1, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase
  1; CH25H, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase; CYP51A1, cytochrome P450 family 51 subfamily
  A1; DHCR24, 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase; DHCR7, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase;
