caption: KEGG pathway analysis of starch and sucrose metabolism in B. coli based on
  the DEGs of the set TS vs. NS. The red and green colors represent the up- and downregulations
  of genes involved in the pathways of starch and sucrose metabolism, respectively.
  The genes related to alpha amylase, maltogenic alpha-amylase, and 4-alpha-glucanotransferase
  were upregulated in expression in the hydrolyzation of starch in B. coli
