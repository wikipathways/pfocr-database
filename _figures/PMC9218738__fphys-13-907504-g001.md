caption: A schematic highlighting the priming and various activation pathways of the
  NLRP3 inflammasome. A priming signal (e.g., ATP), activates NFkB, which is translocated
  to the nucleus, to upregulate the expression of NLRP3, pro-IL1ß and pro-IL18. Via
  either canonical, non-canonical or alternative pathways, caspase-1 mediated cleavage
  of pro-IL1ß and pro-IL18 produces mature IL1ß and IL18, ahead of release from the
  cell, through membrane bound channels, including Gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores. In canonical
  signalling, stimulation of receptors including TLR4 and P2X7R evokes potassium efflux
  and calcium influx, stimulating the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Gasdermin
  D is cleaved via caspase-1, leading to pore formation (). In non-canonical signalling,
  activation of caspase-4/5 stimulates GSDMD cleavage. The resulting amino-terminal
  fragment (GSDMD-NT) initiates pyroptosis and NLRP3 activation, stimulating release
  of DAMPs including ATP which can then activate the canonical pathway via P2X7R.
  In the alternative pathway, Toll or interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing
  adaptor inducing interferon-β (TRIFF) and TLR4-receptor-interacting protein kinase
  1 (RIPK1) interaction leads to the formation of a RIPK1-Fas-associated with death
  domain protein (FADD)-pro-caspase-8 complex. Pro-caspase-8 is cleaved, allowing
  mature caspase-8 to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, ahead of IL1ß and IL18 excretion.
