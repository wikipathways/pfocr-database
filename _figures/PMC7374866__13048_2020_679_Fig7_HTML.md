caption: 'B.coccineus ethanol leaf extract induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
  via the p53 dependent pathway. As illustrated in model, p53 acts as transcription
  factor to regulate both apoptosis and cell cycle signalling cascade. The cell cycle
  progression is controlled by four phases: G1 or gap 1 phase , S or synthesis phase,
  G2 or gap2 phase and M or mitosis phase. Altogether, treating ovarian cancer cells
  with B.coccineus ethanol leaf extract could inhibit the cell proliferation, and
  increase an overall survival of patients'
