caption: The IGF-1R is activated by its ligand IGF-1 and by mechanical loading. Its
  activation is further regulated by a number of factors including the estrogen receptor-alpha
  (ER) and certain integrins, as well as its interaction with the Wnt signaling pathway.
  Downstream effectors of the IGF-1R include the P13K/Akt/mTOR pathway, the Ras/Raf/MAPK
  pathway, and in association with Wnt the β-catenin pathway. In addition to stimulating
  the expression of a number of proliferation and differentiation genes involved with
  osteogenesis, expression of IGF-1 is also increased in osteocytes, and this serves
  to enhance the stimulation by mechanical loading as well as to activate cells such
  as osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells that may not be directly activated by
  mechanical loading.
