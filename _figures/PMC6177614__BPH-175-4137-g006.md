caption: The SIRT1‐dependent mechanism involved in the cardioprotective effects of
  icariin against the mitochondrial oxidative stress induced by I/R injury. Icariin
  treatment reduces cardiac injury and improves myocardial function during I/R injury.
  Icariin attenuates ROS overproduction and maintains mitochondrial homeostasis by
  regulating the SIRT1/FOXO1 signalling pathway, which subsequently relieves myocardial
  cell apoptosis after I/R injury.
