caption: Modulation of host immune response by ZIKV NS5. Virus infection leads to
  the activation of host signaling cascades in response to the recognition of virus
  components such as RNA and protein. The type I IFN signaling pathway is one of the
  many pathways that mediate the host antiviral response. Type I IFN induces the phosphorylation
  of STAT2 and activation of interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)-regulated
  genes, and this signaling cascade is targeted by ZIKV NS5 through the degradation
  of STAT2. Type II IFN and other pro-inflammatory molecules induces the pro-inflammatory
  responses through STAT1 phosphorylation and activation of interferon-gamma activated
  site (GAS)-regulated and other pro-inflammatory genes. ZIKV NS5 can activate the
  transcription of pro-inflammatory genes in a cell type-specific manner, but the
  mechanism is not known.
