caption: Schematic diagram of the heme biosynthesis pathway (left) and the principle
  of HAL mediated PpIX production enhancement with dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) or deferoxamine
  mesylate salt (DFO) (right). DMSO favours the formation of pores in the cell and
  mitochondrion membranes, which increase the uptake of hexaminolevulinate 5-aminolevulinic
  acid (HAL (5-ALA)) and in turn boosts intracellular protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis
  (green arrow). In contrast, DFO inhibits the conversion of PpIX to heme by chelating
  iron (red arrow). The administration of both prodrugs attempts to enhance PpIX accumulation.
  The number [1 to 4] corresponds to the factors why preferentially accumulates in
  cancer cells when compared with normal cells.
