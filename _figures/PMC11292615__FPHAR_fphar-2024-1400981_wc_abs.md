caption: This review seeks to offer a comprehensive look at how salidroside impacts
  gut microbiota and its potential therapeutic role in treating atherosclerosis. (A)
  Salidroside has been shown to have a positive impact on atherosclerosis by promoting
  the growth of beneficial bacteria and decreasing the levels of harmful bacteria
  in the body. (B) Salidroside has been shown to enhance the integrity and function
  of the intestinal mucosal barrier through its ability to suppress NF-κB and p38
  MAPK signaling pathways, modulate the NF-κB/MAPK/JAK-STAT3 signaling pathways and
  increase the expression of antimicrobial peptides HD-5 and HD-6. (C) Salidroside
  can reduce TMAO production through reducing the abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria.
  (D) Salidroside can improve the expression of SCFAs, through increasing the abundance
  of some special bacteria. (E) Salidroside can reduce LPS-induced inflammation, which
  is associated with the inhibition of the ROS-mediated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway,
  the downregulation of exosome miR-199a-5p, and the attenuation of the Notch-Hes
  signaling pathway. (F) Salidroside can inhibit NLRP3-associated gut-coronary axis,
  including TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway, AMPK/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway,
  and P2X7/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway
