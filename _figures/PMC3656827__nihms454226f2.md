caption: The IL-4 receptor is formed by the two side chains IL-4Rα as well as the
  IL-2Rγ chain []. IL-4 engagement induces tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1, which
  is associated with the IL-4Rα chain, as well as JAK3 phosphorylation, which is associated
  with the IL-2Rγ chain. STAT6 will bind to the phosphyorylated receptor allowing
  its phosphorylation by JAK1. The phosphorylated STAT6 dislodges from the receptor
  and forms homodimers. STAT6 homodimers translocate to the cell nucleus where the
  homodimers are disrupted through enzymatic action by STAT6 proteases. STAT6 then
  binds to DNA and promotes transcription of MHC II, IL-4 and IL-4Rα.
