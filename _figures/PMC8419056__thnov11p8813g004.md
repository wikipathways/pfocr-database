caption: Correlation between pyroptosis and the tumor immune microenvironment. (A)
  Downregulation of perforin and granzyme B and reduced infiltration of NK cells and
  CTLs were observed in the GSDME-/-cancer cell line microenvironment. (B) Caspase-3-mediated
  pyroptosis in cancer cells is induced through perforin and granzyme B secreted by
  CAR-T cells. (C) The administration of NP-GSDMA3 and Phe-BF3 can induce GSMDA3-mediated
  pyroptosis in cancer cells and contribute to increased infiltration of immune cells,
  including CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and M1 macrophages, and reduced infiltration
  of CD4+regulatory T lymphocytes.
