caption: Curcumin actions on the WNT pathway in cancer therapy. Curcumin modulates
  cancer progression through the regulation of several signaling pathways. Attachment
  of ligands to their corresponding receptors leads to the activation of downstream
  pathways, including PI3K, STAT, caspase. These signaling pathways have a major role
  in cell survival, proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, migration and metastasis.
  The decrease of Akt pathway by curcumin leads to the activation of p53 signaling
  and Bad-mediated apoptotic pathway contributing to cancer cell survival. Moreover,
  the downregulation of Akt pathway is associated with the inhibition of NF-ϰB signaling
  pathway, responsible for the inflammation. By decreasing WNT pathway, curcumin leads
  to the activate GSK-3β activity which induces β-catenin phosphorylation and then
  its degradation. The inhibition of the WNT pathway is associated with the control
  of proliferation and angiogenesis. The increase of caspase pathway by curcumin leads
  to apoptosis whereas curcumin decreases the STAT3 signaling pathway to counteract
  migration and proliferation. The activation of PPARγ by curcumin leads to the downregulation
  of the WNT pathway and the control of inflammation. WNT pathway downregulation results
  in the decrease of PI3K and STAT3 signaling pathways but the increase of caspase
