caption: A) Heatmap schematic illustrating fold change in expression of all genes
  associated with NF-κB signaling that were identified as being significantly up-
  or down-regulated in the brain following TBI in Nlrx1−/− mice compared to the TBI
  wild type animals. Analysis was based on the ΔΔCt method, where all data was standardized
  to the average gene expression for a panel of 8 housekeeping genes and normalized
  to the respective non-lesion, contralateral region of each respective animal. Greater
  than a 2-fold change in gene expression was considered significant. Three randomly
  selected brains from each genotype and treatment group were selected and pooled
  for profiling studies. Pathway assessments were based on Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
  (n=3 per group).
