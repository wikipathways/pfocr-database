caption: Model of TNF-α–induced telomere shortening. (A) Schematic showing the release
  of ATF7 and telomerase from telomeres following TNF-α treatment. (Left) ATF7 and
  telomerase localize to telomeres by binding to the Ku complex under unstressed conditions.
  In response to TNF-α treatment, ATF7 is phosphorylated and released from telomeres
  together with telomerase. (Right) In addition, telomerase is mainly recruited to
  telomeres through TPP1 (). Therefore, the role of ATF7-Ku pathway may be a relatively
  minor to recruit telomerase to telomeres. (B) Schematic view of the effect of TNF-α
  on telomere length and H3K9me3. (Left) The TNF-α treatment induces telomere shortening
  by a release of ATF7-telomerase. (Right) The TNF-α treatment induces a release of
  the ATF7-Suv39h1 complex, leading to a decrease in H3K9me3 on telomeres. This may
  cause telomere lengthening, because Suv39h1/2 mutations induce telomere lengthening
  (). These two mechanisms may work competitively.
