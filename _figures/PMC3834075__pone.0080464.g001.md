caption: 'The solid arrows denote known steps and the dashed arrows denote hypothetical
  steps. Modified from Ma et al. and Gao et al. [,]. Enzymes of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  4- phosphate (MEP) pathway are follows: 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase
  (DXS), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (MCT), 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-Cmethyl-D-erythritol
  kinase (CMK), 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MDS), 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl
  diphosphate synthase (HDS), 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (HDR);
  and enzymes of mevalonate (MVA) pathway are acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AACT),
  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase
  (HMGR), mevalonate kinase (MVK), 5-phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) and 5-diphosphomevalonate
  decarboxylase (PMD). Isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPPI) catalyzes the isomerisation
  of dimethylallyl dihosphate (DMAPP) to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) whereas conversion
  of IPP to geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) is catalysed by geranylgeranyl diphosphate
  synthase (GGPPS). Hypothetical tanshinones biosynthetic pathway was deduced by the
  consideration of identified diterpenoid natural products from S. miltiorrhiza [,].
  These steps involve series hydroxylation, dehydrogenation and reduction reactions
  catalysed by cytochrome P450s, dehydrogenases and reductases.'
