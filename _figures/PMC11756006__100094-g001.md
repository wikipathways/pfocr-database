caption: 'Molecular signaling of nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat, and
  pyrin domain-containing protein 3 priming and activation. Pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs) recognized by pattern recognition receptors [such as toll-like
  receptors (TLRs)) can activate the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling
  pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which both
  initiate the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing
  protein 3 (NLRP3) priming process, including the upregulation of NLRP3 and pro-interleukin
  (IL)-1β protein expression. Meanwhile, the assembled NLRP3 inflammasome also cleaves
  the gasdermin D (GSDMD) by disconnecting the C-terminal to produce GSDMD-N, leading
  to cell pyroptosis. Additionally, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced Ca2+
  efflux, the imbalance of Ca2+ and K+-associated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) stress, and lysosome damage-produced cathepsin B can serve as triggers for
  NLRP3 activation to accelerate the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The cartoons
  in this figure were prepared using Biorender (https://biorender.com). ASC: Apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain; NEK7: Never in mitosis
