caption: Metabolic pathways of E. coli a) under normal growth conditions and b) after
  deletion of the gene pgi. The major flux during normal growth is through the glycolysis
  pathway, with no flux through either the Entner-Doudoroff pathway or the glyoxylate
  shunt. Both of these pathways get activated immediately after the deletion of pgi,
  and major flux diversion from glycolysis to the PPP takes place. The thickness of
  the arrows indicating fluxes is for illustrative purpose only, and not to scale.
